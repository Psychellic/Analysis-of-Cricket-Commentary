### Analyzing Cricket Commentary Using NLP: Identifying Key Overs and Highlights

Cricket is a game of momentsâ€”those crucial overs that can turn the tide of the match. In this blog, I will walk you through an NLP project designed to analyze cricket commentary and extract key insights. By inputting the overs and runs of a match, the program identifies the top 10 overs with the highest wickets and highlights interesting events that occurred in those overs. This can be a powerful tool for cricket analysts, commentators, and fans who want to delve deeper into the game's intricacies.

### 4. Problem Statement

Cricket matches are filled with critical moments that can drastically influence the outcome of the game. Identifying these moments from ball-by-ball commentary can provide valuable insights. The problem we aim to solve is to analyze cricket commentary to identify the top 10 overs with the highest number of wickets and highlight interesting points that occurred during these overs.

### 5. Motivation

Cricket analysts, commentators, and fans often miss out on the finer details of a match's turning points. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), we can extract these moments from the commentary, providing a deeper understanding of the game. This project aims to enhance the viewing experience and offer a tool for in-depth match analysis.

### 6. Approach

#### Data Collection and Preparation

We use the [Cricket Scorecard and Commentary Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raghuvansht/cricket-scorecard-and-commentary-dataset) from Kaggle, which includes detailed ball-by-ball commentary for various cricket matches.

#### NLP Techniques for Commentary Analysis

- **Text Preprocessing:** Tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization to clean and prepare the commentary text.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** To gauge the excitement level of each commentary line.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** To extract players' names, actions, and other important entities from the commentary.

        LSTM(64),
        Dropout(0.2),
        Dense(64, activation="relu"),
        Dense(32, activation="relu"),
        Dense(2, activation="linear"),
    ]
)

### Explanation

In our cricket commentary RNN code, we utilize Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which excel at understanding sequential data, akin to reading a story or watching a video. The RNN learns from the order of events, much like recalling earlier parts of a story to understand new information. Applied to cricket commentary, the RNN analyzes each line, discerning patterns to predict outcomes which are runs and wickets. By training the model with organized data, we enable it to interpret and anticipate cricket events accurately, providing valuable insights into match dynamics and serving as a predictive tool for future outcomes.

#### Identifying Key Overs

1. Aggregate the number of wickets per over.
2. Sort the overs by the number of wickets in descending order.
3. Select the top 10 overs.

#### Highlighting Interesting Points

1. Filter the commentary data for the top 10 overs.
2. Apply sentiment analysis to identify lines with high excitement levels.
3. Use NER to extract and highlight key events.

### 7. Results/Discussion

By analyzing the commentary data, we successfully identified the top 10 overs with the highest number of wickets. For each of these overs, we highlighted the most exciting moments, providing insights into how the match unfolded. This analysis not only helps in understanding past matches but also serves as a valuable resource for live commentary and strategic planning.

Example Output:

Sample Data:

| Over | Ball | Commentary                                       | Wickets | Runs |
|------|------|--------------------------------------------------|---------|------|
| 1    | 1.1  | "Bowler X to Batsman Y, no run, good length ball"| 0       | 0    |
| 1    | 1.2  | "Bowler X to Batsman Y, OUT! Caught by Z!"       | 1       | 0    |
| ...  | ...  | ...                                              | ...     | ...  |

### 8. Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of NLP in sports analytics. By analyzing cricket commentary, we can identify key moments and gain deeper insights into the game. This tool is beneficial for analysts, commentators, and fans who wish to enhance their understanding and enjoyment of cricket.
