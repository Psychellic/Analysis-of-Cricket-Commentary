"speared down the leg side at 89pmh/143kph, given wide"
"length in the channel, Finch <strong>hammers it through the covers with minimal foot movement</strong>, smiting it out the middle of the bat and through the ring. So much power in the shot!"

"back of a length, skids on, Finch defends back down the track"
"length in the channel, fenced out to cover and they set off straight away, Klaasen <strong>has a shy at the striker's end</strong> but his throw flies over on the bounce! Might have been in, regardless"
"cramped for room, back of a length on the hip, defended awkwardly and it drops at his feet"
"fullish outside off, looks to go over the top but it's chipped down towards long-off via the toe. Looks to be dribbling away for four, but du Plessis claws it back"
"slightly full of a length, flicked off the pads down to long leg. 86mph/139kph"
"offcutter, Finch doesn't pick it looking to make some room, dabs it into his foot and it <strong>squirts just past the off stump</strong>! Nortje has his head in his hands!"

"back of a length in the channel, stabbed out to deep cover"
"fullish, angling down leg, looks to whip to the leg side but can't get bat on it"
"back of a length slower ball, heaved away but straight to the fielder at short midwicket. Miller tries to throw down the stumps at the non-striker's, Pretorius misfields backing up, and they <em>just about make it </em>through for an overthrow with Warner diving at full stretch to make his ground!"
"legcutter, flicked round the corner past Nortje in the ring"

"short and down the leg side, <strong>pulled hard</strong> through the vacant midwicket region and it rolls away to the rope! Not timed, but enough on it to beat deep backward square running round"
"flashes at a wide one outside the off stump, Finch opens the face and square drives for four through backward point! Beats the diving backward point, <strong>stand-and-deliver stuff</strong>"

"gets his man this time! <b>Great catch by Miller running back from short midwicket!</b> Bouncer, pushed across the left-hander, and Warner was late on the pull. Heaved high into the leg side, and Miller gets back to hold onto a difficult chance, falling onto his back as he takes it. Warner departs, SA finally get their breakthrough"
"length outside off, carved straight to backward point on the back foot. 'Awh, come on!' exclaims Finch"
"length outside off, no foot movement from Finch as he throws his hands at it and only meets fresh air... <strong>91mph/147kph, Nortje cranking it up!</strong>"
"steps back, pulls a back of a length ball down to backward square from deep in his crease"
"flat, down the leg side, skews out to square leg via de Kock's gloves. Given as a leg-bye, must have flicked the pad on the way through"
"length in the channel, not much turn but Wade can only prod back to the bowler"
rocks back and carves this out to wide long-off
"Finch gets down and across looking to lap this over short fine leg, but Shamsi sees him coming. He's struck on the inner thigh, down on one knee, Shamsi belts out an appeal <strong>and it's given!</strong> Looked pretty adjacent, and Finch trudges off after an imperious 55. EDIT: Hawk-Eye confirms that would have smacked into the off stump, halfway up."

"slower ball again, slashed out to deep point with a cross-batted shot, Marsh grunting as he throws his hands at it"
"slower ball, very nearly played on, and then not far away from a calamitous run-out! Length on leg stump, looked to slog through midwicket, struck on the back of the bat, it dribbled to de Kock... Wade set off looking for a run, was sent back, and was scrambling back into his crease as QdK tried to kick the stumps down but dragged it wide! <b>Drama!</b>"

"back of a length, dragged down the ground to long-on, only one"
"length ball, pushed across him, skied <i>miles up into the air</i> towards short fine leg... de Kock runs round, gets underneath it, it comes down with snow on it, and de Kock <b>dives forward to take the catch</b> on the edge of the ring!

"short ball, pulled elegantly in front of square for four! Full extension of the arms, and out the middle"
"slower ball, guided to short point on the back foot"
"<strong>given lbw!</strong> And <strong>reviewed </strong>almost immediately. Low full toss, looked like it might have been sliding down the leg slide on first viewing. Struck on the shin, no bat involved. Aaaaand....<b>missing leg stump</b> according to ball-tracking!"
"length in the channel, driven to long-off to keep the strike"
"hangs a slower ball outside off, Marsh gets across to the off side looking to mow this over midwicket, but only connects with thin air! <em>Harshly given as a wide</em>"

"slower ball on fifth stump, whipped to deep midwicket with quick wrists, Miller fields well to prevent a second"

"punched out to deep extra cover on the back foot, Klaasen <strong>gets round brilliantly</strong>, diving to his left to cut it off. Great running though, as Carey dives to make his ground for the third"

"<strong>bowled 'im!</strong> 79mph/127kph, full and straight... hang on a minute, <strong>has he overstepped? Yes he has!</strong> Nightmare for Rabada, timber went flying as Smith got across to the off side and couldn't get bat on a slower yorker which burst through his legs!"
"nails his yorker, Smith chips it into the off side looking to go down the ground, and it lands in no-man's-land"
clipped out to deep backward square
"low full toss, short-arm jabbed out to midwicket, Nortje is running in off the fence but <strong>shells the chance!</strong> Never looked comfortable under the high ball, similar chance to the one Lockie Ferguson took in the World Cup final - difficult, but gettable"
"<strong>timber this time!</strong> Offcutter on a length, Carey clears the front leg, is through the shot early, and it pings back the top of middle! No overstep this time, much to Rabada's relief"

"full outside off, something of a half-volley, full extension of the arms... high in the air, but over du Plessis at long-on and into the crowd!"
"slower ball, flies miles up into the air but into no-man's-land... there's a man diving underneath it, but <b>he can't hold on!</b> Looks like it was Klaasen running in from deep midwicket, burst through his hands as he dived forwards"
"shifts across to scoop, doesn't get all of it, and fine leg catches up with it"

"very full length, tailing in, and <B>what a sumptuous strike!</B> Perfectly vertical bat, oozing with timing, and patted through a very straight mid-on"
"<B>ping!</B> That's perfection from Starc, an identikit dismissal to de Kock's Joburg castling, aiming to clip to leg, but beaten by late outswing, and the top of middle stump takes a pounding! He ends up staring forlornly towards midwicket, and well, is that the game there and then?"
"swinging past the leg stump this time, but must have flicked pad along the way as there's no wide called"
"banged in short, that's a fizzing lifter, and <B>it raps the gloves hard! </B>Well, that's a lively first over!"

zips over the top of middle as van der Dussen pulls at thin air
"a wide, wild outswinger, wide outside the tramlines"
"<B>clouted back through the line!</B> Broad-shouldered biffage from Rassie, picking the cross-seamer and flinging his arms into a lofted drive"
"width, and <strong>clattered up and over the covers!</strong> Freeing the arms, with glee! That's more like it for South Africa!"
"yorker, tailing in, but well watched from Rassie, sensing the likelihood of a danger ball and tapping it for the single to cover"
"<B>reaching for the slash over third man, and Zampa clings onto a blinder!</B> Another huge breakthrough, full length, wide line, Faf was nowhere near the ball but had a go anyway, his spiralling outside edge almost had enough toe-end on it to reach the rope, but Zampa somehow located the ball in the wind, and clung on with both hands, flinging himself backwards"
"lifting down the leg side, Carey can't gather cleanly"
"zipping past the outside edge on a tighter line, well bowled, and well beaten. Australia look in the mood to dominate"

"quicker delivery on a full length, poked to cover on the front foot"
"<B>flogged into the building site!</B> Wow, that was just a fraction short, Klaasen was loitering on the back foot like a mugger in the shadows, and utterly slotted his pull through the line over wide long-on!"
"chopped down into the off side, hopping onto the back foot for the point sweeper to gather"

"cracked in front of point this time, and the sweeper has an easier time intercepting this one. Taking the pace off once again, outside off stump"
"cutter, on a back of a length, straightened after pitching as Klaasen sized up the flick to leg. Good running as midwicket runs in to gather"

flogged out to deep cover
"back of a length, hauled to the on-side with a cross-batted swipe"
"<B>reverse-hoick, and back goes the middle stump!</B> Well, something had to give, Klaasen climbed into a pre-meditated switch-hit, and did everything right except connect with the ball! Too early through the swing, and Zampa pulls out a chainsaw-esque celebration that looked uncannily like something Dale Steyn might come up with..."

"wafted out to point, lovely elusive flight allied to a tight line"
"can't nudge this one off the pads, and Forecaster slumps to 7.2%"
"out comes the ramp, no pace to work with, but played with impressive perpendicularity, clean over the keeper's head"
"quicker ball, outside off, fenced off the legs to backward square"
"another ramp, and <strong>a brilliant catch from Zampa!</strong> He saw the angles early, sprinting from short third man the moment that Rassie shaped for the shot, and flung himself full-stretch to scoop it off the turf! This could get messy ..."
"whittled to wide mid-on, flicking from outside off"
"full face of the bat, patted to short cover"
"flicked into space on the leg side once more, just the five runs and a wicket in another constrictive over"
"advancing out of the crease, rapped on the shin by a well-flighted googly, but struck outside leg"
"compact sweep, out to deep square, and good running to get back for the second"
"dipping into the toes, flicked with intent to square leg. Singles ain't going to cut it, but I think South Africa know that..."
"back of a length, another googly, fenced to cover off the back foot"
"well bowled, skidding on, but sliding down the leg side as van Biljon is rapped on the shin"
"<B>through him like a dose of the pox!</B> Tossed up on off stump, skids straight on as van Biljon turns his wrists into a clip to leg, but can only grimace as the ball crashes through the gate and into the timbers!"

"a shimmy to the pitch, tucked to midwicket"
"<B>a dirty great wipe across the line, so nearly bowled, so nearly stumped!</B> Pretorius uses the momentum of his violent followthrough to propel him with a complete lack of dignity, safely back into the crease. Eww..."
nudged to the leg side
"reverse sweep, that's actually very well played, but a fine tumbling stop at what was point and is now backward square"
poked out to cover point
"clipped from a leg-stump line, on the up out to midwicket. Zampa's spell is zapping all resistance"
a battered pull out to deep midwicket. A slight fumble on the boundary's edge lets them get back for two
rocking back for a cut into the covers
"<strong>a monstrous pick-up over midwicket!</strong> The perfect length to treat with utter contempt, hoisting high with a skiddy seam, clean into the stands!"
"banged in short, Pretorius pokes at it with a vertical bat, like a slightly off-balanced gun on a partridge shoot. And misses"
"slower ball, off line, maybe South Africa can do it in extras?"
cracked out to the off side
"slower ball, <B>slapped straight to cover</B>. That will be that then! That all happened in slo-mo, a yawning, telegraphed drive, reaching for the wide ball, finding no timing, and skidding a low chance to the edge of the ring. It's not Miller time no more..."
"back of a length, slower ball, cautiously pointed towards point"
"slower ball, a massive yahoo across the line! <strong>And up goes the finger!</strong> A slight suspicion of under-edge as <strong>Pretorius reviews</strong> ... but err ... no. He's seen the initial replay, and knows it's curtains! Thumping off stump and South Africa slide deeper into the soup"
"worked to the on side, nothing doing there"
"slower ball, back of a length, flapped to deep cover"
"opens the face, nurdled to third man. <strong>A direct hit would have been out!</strong>"

"slower ball, tight to off stump, worked with stiff wrists to midwicket"
pressed out to point
"reverse-sweep, and <B>that's plumb too!</B> Nortje gets in a tangle to a regulation length ball, and Agar's evening just gets better. This is turning into the most one-sided 2-1 series loss of all time..."
"<B>bowled him!</B> Agar is on a hat-trick once again, with No. 11 in his sights! A revolting hack towards some distant point in the Antarctic, the ball scuds on with the arm, into the timbers... crumbs!"
"<B>cripes, that's close!</B> A quicker ball, zeroing in on the top of off, and fenced away with a frantic inside-edge!"
swished to point off the back foot
"on the toes, clipped hard to the leg side, to ironic cheers"
"fired into the legs, and pops behind square for another single"
"whoops, that's a freebie to any quality of batsman, a half-volley on the toes, and chipped sweetly through fine leg"
"full length, dipping into the pads, a massive appeal, and <strong>up goes the finger! It's all over!</strong> Faint hints of an inside-edge, but South Africa have no reviews, and they've been thumped by 97 runs ..."
