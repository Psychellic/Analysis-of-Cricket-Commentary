and it all begins with a leave outside the off stump. Apparently there's room for that in a T20 final
"goes back to his favourite cutters, and this one grips the pitch on a good length and darts past the right-handed Simmons' poke."
"nice and tight on middle, and Simmons is only able to block it to short cover."
"shuffles across onto off stump, because he suspects the bowler will be targeting it, and so is able to nudge the good length ball towards midwicket"
taps a back of a length delivery on off stump to the left of mid-on
"gets a little squared up as he steers a shortish delivery, the offcutter again, towards short third man. Only three runs off the first over."
"tosses it up on off stump, comes forward to block"
"senses Simmons would come down the pitch, and so fires it flat and into leg stump. Simmons can only lift it over the top of midwicket, but there is protection in the deep"
"shortish and outside off, backs away and carves it to cover"
"stays back on leg stump to try and push a flatter, good length delivery on off stump to cover"
"another quick delivery aimed at off stump, but Parthiv makes his own room and cuts it through cover point and short extra cover"
"lovely bowling. He is drifting the ball into middle and off, from around the wicket, as he has been doing all over to the left-handed Parthiv. This is tossed up a bit more, so the batsman can't back away and cut. He has to go for the cover drive, and gets an inside edge"
"he has been spurring Pune on and he does it again in the final. It's the offcutter again, pitching back of a length, and giving no room to swing the arms. Might just have got a touch more bounce than Parthiv thought as he pulls and finds mid-on waiting for the catch."
"gets width, but doesn't do much more than slap it straight to point"
"shortish delivery, meant to slip across the right-hander. Rayudu blocks awkwardly, getting squared up, but manages a single to cover nonetheless"
"what a catch! Two wickets in two overs and he's racing towards the top of the charts! Dives to his left, even as the ball is dying. Sticks out his strong hand, his left hand, and it sticks! He also makes sure his elbow doesn't hit the ground. That could have made the ball pop out. What a night he's already having.  And it all comes from the offcutter again. The ball he backs to the hilt. The ball he said he would bowl despite his captain's instructions sometimes. Sticks in the pitch and Simmons, set up to play the flick because the ball was on the pads, pops out a leading edge"
"good length ball, defends towards cover point"
"full on middle and off, taps it to the right of mid-on"
stays back to a good length delivery on off stump and turns it to short midwicket
"tosses it up a bit more, to draw Rohit forward and clip it towards short midwicket"
punches a flatter delivery on off stump past short midwicket's left
"<b>drift</b>, lovely, testing drift beats Rayudu and Dhoni calls for a stumping. When he does so, the third umpire has to get to work. The replays show the batsman was coming forward to block, coming forward a long way, because of the flight. But it's the drift away from the bat that does him in. Credit to Rayudu though to keep his back foot back in the crease"
pins him to his crease with a good length delivery on off stump - he really doesn't turn the ball much - but the batsmen aren't quite prepared for that. Rayudu is waiting for it before sliding the ball towards point
"clips a good length ball on middle past midwicket. Only two runs off the over, from a 17-year old, in his first final, inside the Powerplay"
"goes for the on-the-up drive outside off, and gets a single to the left of mid-off"
picks the shortish delivery on middle and leg towards deep square leg
slides a good length ball down the leg side and is penalised for doing so
"nice, tight, wicket-to-wicket line. Rayudu blocks with an angled bat and takes the single to point"
waits on the back of a length delivery on off stump and taps it towards the left of short midwicket. No run there
"glides the shortish delivery towards short third man, but Ferguson dives to his right and prevents it getting past him"
"<b>gets big on him</b>. This is not the belter everyone expected. The slower balls., the cutters are gripping and misbehaving. Here, Rayudu has to get up on his tiptoes to dab the shortish delivery outside off to point"
"there's the first one to the fence. Such sweet timing. Such minimal fuss. Ferguson has all the pace in the world, so Rohit just uses it, opening the face of the bat and slicing the full delivery outside off past backward point's left"
"shortish on off stump, Rohit blocks in front of off stump, Rayudu thinks about a single, he's halfway down, and has to be sent back"
"past short fine leg. Good placement. Again, Rohit just uses the pace, and preys on the bowler's mistake. Ferguson bowls on the pads and the Mumbai captain just glances it away"
"<b>crisp</b> but straight to mid-on. Rohit looks in prime form, playing the ball late, and getting his timing perfect"
"outside edge and that's the third boundary of the over. Lovely, Test-match length, hitting the deck, just outside off. Draws Rohit to play the on-the-up cover drive and he gets lucky thereafter"
"smashed! This is again a top pace delivery, on a good length, but with a bit of width. That's enough to earn Rohit's ire. Clatters it through the covers off the front foot, getting a bit taller in his crease to get on top of the bounce"
"hello, hello! He beats him with lack of turn. Rayudu was expecting it, hanging back to cut, but is beaten on the inside edge"
"this one sits up to cut, and the legspin gives him all the room he needs to pick the gap past point"
"another short, quick, wide delivery and Rayudu carves it to the right of point."
"loops it up over the batsman's eyeline on off stump, Rayudu is reaching for the sweep, and he connects too early. Inside edge to long leg"
stays back to the flatter delivery on off stump and punches it through to the sweeper
"pulls out the sweep again, he's playing the shot on line, the moment it is outside off, and loopy, out it comes. Mistimes it to deep square leg. Might have been the googly too, so he hits with the turn"
"full on middle, Rayudu charges out, and yorks himself. The ball wanders to short midwicket"
"low full toss, rather Rayudu makes that length happen by shimmying down the pitch. But wait, they go for a single, they chance Steven Smith's arm, and that's a terrible thing to do. The Pune captain runs to his left from mid-off, then turns to face the bowler's end stumps and nails them. Rayudu is so far short. The Hyderabad boy walks back as the crowd around him - his home city - goes wild"
"back of a length and outside off, glides it past point"
"and he strikes the ball so well that it travels almost all the way to the midwicket boundary. But despite all that, there might have been a run-out off this delivery. Unadkar and Thakur are the men chasing the ball, and then send the the throw to the wrong end, even as their captain Smith yells and points to the batsman's. Rohit had stopped with the second but Krunal raced 3/4th of the pitch down for the third and yet makes his ground"
"shortish on leg stump, nudges it to long leg"
"back of a length, wanders down leg"
"shortish and outside off, Rohit reaches out for it, but it's a bit too wide for him to time it properly. His feet, as most batsmen's in T20s, are on leg stump, wanting the room to free the arms. That's why skirting the wide line is good in this format. Inside edge on the bounce to the wicketkeeper"
"gives it a good rip and Pandya, wary of the turn, defends the good length ball in front of off and middle"
"comes down the track, but gives his intentions away too early. Allows Zampa to adjust his length, bowl slower and shorter. Krunal can only flick it towards short midwicket"
"drifts a good length ball down leg, perhaps perceiving Krunal would come down the track again"
leans in and drives a fuller delivery on leg stump to long-on
"opens the face for a good length delivery on off stump, Rohit thinks about a single, but Unadkat  running in from point, haring in, spurs second thoughts"
"flatter delivery on off stump, Rohit camps deep in his crease and pulls, untidily to long-on"
"googly, pitching on leg stump and bouncing ab it more than Krunal expects. He just about turns it to short fine leg. That's the time out"
"tossed up and comes in with the angle, Krunal plays all around his front pad, but this clearly heading down leg"
"fast slider, aiming off stump, Krunal chops his bat down in time and gets it past lone slip"
"flat offbreak on off, not much turn, Rohit hangs back and nurdles a single towards square leg"
"another flat dart on middle and leg, nearly 100ks, no room to work with at all. Nice and simple. Glanced to long leg"
"non-turner, short on top of off stump, punched back to Sundar with a straight bat"
"pushed through outside off, 101ks, Krunal backs away slightly and goes inside out over extra cover. Not a full-blooded loft. Just a gentle, little chip. Deliberately chipped in the air, beats Dan Christian running desperately to his right from long-off"
"superbly-judged catch from Shardul Thakur at deep midwicket. The soft signal is out. They go to the TV umpire. Zampa's foot is okay, as is Thakur's at the edge of the boundary. Mumbai's mini-recovery has been halted. The TV umpire sends Rohit on his way. This was dropped short on middle, Rohit skips back for a pull. Hits it in the air, Thakur pouches it at deep midwicket, but the momentum carries him back. He is pushed back, but holds his balance, and bolts at the last moment"
"floated up outside off, driven through the line to long-off"
"first-ball six for Pollard. Zampa gives this some air outside off, Pollard gets forward, gets under it and launches it effortlessly over the long-off boundary. The man was in the deep, but Pollard cleared him nonchalantly"
"flatter and outside off, push-driven to long-off"
"flatter legbreak, breaks in, chipped in the air to the left of short midwicket"
"A very, very straight long-on moves to his left and pouches it. This is all part of a plan. Pollard is a very good straight hitter, so keep a man there and tempt him. Two in the over for Zampa. Flighted, full and outside off, Pollard gets under it and lifts it in the air. Does not get the desired distance. Tiwary has enough time to move to his left and snap it up"
"good length ball on middle, blocks"
"tosses it up on middle and off, defends"
"goes back and flicks a flatter delivery on off stump, past midwicket"
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
targets the stumps with a fullish delivery on off stump. Blocks
"looks for a single, but after nudging the ball three feet in front of short midwicket, that's just not on"
"a low full toss on leg stump, Krunal would normally biff those over square leg, but now he has to nudge it through to long-on"
"gorgeous hit! He makes fine connection, but even if he doesn't he also makes sure to place it well to the left of the long-off fielder. Proper cricket."
"low full toss on off stump, crunches the drive to Smith at short cover"
slows it down and makes the tossed up legspinner drift into Pandya's middle and leg stump. Clip past midwicket
"goes wide of the crease for the googly, pitching outside leg. Krunal sweeps to long leg"
"another low full toss, this on off stump, Pandya drives to long-on"
shortish on middle and leg - it's the slower ball again - Hardik moves across and flicks it past square leg's right
"this is quick, it nips back in and it's gone! Pune are running rampant. This from Christian is great thinking. He pitches it on a good length, gets it to jag into the right-hander. Pandya is not ready for the delivery to be at top pace. He flicks across the line and is plumb in front."
"swing, away from the left-hander. Karn, standing rooted to the crease, fishes at it with his hands and is beaten"
"with the lower order in the middle, Christian is going for his quick deliveries. He's going to hustle them out. Back of a length and outside off, Karn, his feet not working, cuts and misses"
"that's number three for those keeping count. Three balls beaten. Three dots. Shortish and outside off, Karn flashes and misses"
"goes on the bounce to mid-on! And then there was even a run-out chance. Pune are minting gold. All of it happens of a shortish  delivery that Karn pulls and mistimes. Unadkat moves to his left, gets his body behind the ball even as it bounces right in front of him. Gets hit on the wrist, but makes sure to get the throw away to the right end - the batsman's - to force Krunal back into his crease"
"<B>dropped</b> but he's run-out anyway! If there is one sign that this is meant to be. Shardul, you beauty. First you bowl a lovely ball, moving in off the deck, hitting a good length, and getting the outside edge as Karn flicks. It flies to the left of Christan at first slip, a seriously tough catch. He can't pull it off, but he does have the sense to throw at the keeper's end with a panic-stricken Karn looking to steal a run. He doesn't hit the target, but it doesn't matter because Thakur has run up to wait for the throw, and not just ball-watch. Such good awareness"
"back of a length on off stump, the new batsman Johnson, who has two slips, blocks"
nudges a shortish delivery on off stump through midwicket
"full and outside off, Krunal drives uppishly through cover"
"137kph, full on off stump, Johnson defends with a straight bat"
"cramps him, on middle and off, with some inward movement. Ensures Johnson gets nothing off the block by running up and fielding the ball himself. Pune are so switched on."
"back of a length and just outside off, Krunal steers it towards cover"
"full and outside off, drives to the sweeper on the off side"
"fuller delivery outside off, moving further away from the left-hander. Johnson pushes and misses"
"swings a back of a length delivery from outside off stump to the right of mid-on. Good work from Unadkat, putting in the dive"
"looks for the flick, across the line of the offcutter. It pitches just in front of Krunal and darts away from him to take the leading edge to deep point"
"shortish and outside off, pulls off a little late cut to deep third man"
"shortish on middle and leg, Krunal swings it away towards long leg. No bat involved"
"big sound as the offcutter passes the bat, but since it doesn't have the pace, it <b>doesn't carry</b> to Dhoni behind the wicket. Pull shot goes awry"
"this one's at top pace and Krunal isn't ready for this either. Goes for the pull, and it comes off the splice of the bat. Could almost have been caught and bowled"
keeps back and flicks a shortish delivery to long leg
"pulls off that deceptive offcutter again. And it's a dot again. Such good execution. He sees the left-hander thinking about moving away outside leg, and so delivers the off-pace delivery well outside off stump. Play and miss"
picks the shortsh offcutter outside off and whips it to long-on
"walks across his crease early, and so Christian bowls the offcutter well outside off. Johnson, premeditating the lap sweep, plays and misses"
"back of a length and outside off, Johnson has the room he needs to swing the arms, and he heaves it down the  ground. Gets just enough distance to clear Rahane at long-on"
"full and outside off, swipes it away to long-on"
"shortish and on off stump, Krunal slashes it to point"
"slower bouncer, gripping in the pitch and darting away past Johnson's intended upper cut. They pinch a bye as Dhoni gets a bad bounce and Unadkat at short third man has to clean up. Could have had Johnson run-out at the non-strikers with a direct hit"
poor ball. It's length and it's quick and it's outside off. All Krunal needs to do is slash as hard as he can. Four to the left of the sweeper
"slower, short ball, and it's perfectly executed. He chooses it because he sees Johnson scurrying away outside off. He lines it up outside off to make sure the batsman struggles to reach it. A gentle dab to point gets only a single"
"back of a length, along the tramlines outside off, Krunal looks for the cut, but gets an inside edge to the wicketkeeper"
muscles a slower short ball to deep midwicket. Pull for a single
drags a shortish delivery from well outside off to deep square leg. Slower ball again.
launches a length ball high and into the crowd over long-on. He is ready for the slower ball. He gets under it and simply pummels it over the ropes
"full and outside off, squeezes it out to cover. Finishes the final with a spell of 4-0-19-2. Finishes the IPL as the second-highest wicket-taker"
"intent to keep the ball out of the reach of the bowler, Christian bowls a short and wide slower ball that goes too far past the tram lines"
"tries to slug a slower, length ball, outside off to deep square leg and misses it altogether"
"picks the gap between square leg and deep midwicket. He gets a half-volley on off stump, and heaves it into an unmanned part of the ground. Mumbai owe him a lot today"
"another wide, well outside off, with Christian trying to prevent Krunal from getting bat to ball"
"bang! He's giving himself and Mumbai's bowlers a total to bowl at. Takes a length ball on off stump and with that big wind up, he launches it straight over the top"
moves over the wicket for a fuller delivery on off stump and Krunal slogs it to deep midwicket
"times the pants off this short delivery outside off, but he picks out deep midwicket with equal precision"
"he's top-edged a short ball, angled across him, in an attempt to pull it over the ropes. But he's trying to drag it. And the ball has gone well over his shoulder as well. Bad signs and they are realised when Rahane runs in from deep midwicket and takes the catch. Nevertheless, a gutsy innings."
"full and floated in at off stump, he gets to the pitch and pushes it to extra cover"
"good length at off stump, leans in, opens the face on his forward block and steals a single on the off side"
"good length, arm ball at off stump. Goes forward and chops it off the outside half to short third man"
"good length, wider outside off, steps out and slices straight to backward point"
"drops it short at off stump, he goes deep in the crease and tries to pull this past mid-on, but he's late on it and finds Rayudu there"
"good shot. This is back of a length outside off, and it climbs up at a nice height for Rahane's back foot punch. He's in position quickly and times this nicely past extra cover. Pollard runs a long way to his left from long-off, seems to have gotten there too, but his dive is just a tad too late and it beats him"
"full, slight tail away from off stump, he drives off the outside half of the bat to extra cover"
"overpitched at middle stump, no movement. Stands his ground and finds deep square leg with a flick"
"back of a length at the hips, gets on his toes and takes the bottom hand off as he drops this glance to short fine's left. Malinga makes his first effort of the night, gets low to his left and stops it"
"full, fast, swinging in at off stump. Tripathi brings down an axe on this, good timing. It bounces to Rohit's right at mid-off and he puts in a full length dive and holds on to it"
"back of a length, angling away from him outside off. He uses the angle to dab it to third man"
"good length, down leg side. Tickles it fine for a four off his pad. Malinga wasn't anywhere close to it this time"
"classy, traditional drive down the ground from Rahane. Superb pull-back from Pollard near the boundary. This was full and angled in at leg stump. Rahane didn't put a stride forward, just offered the full face to get it past mid-on. Pollard gave chase from mid-off to pull it back"
"<b>gone!</b> Traps him in front of off stump with a good length ball. Tripathi put in a stride to try and defend this. Bat and pad were very close together and the umpire, S Ravi, had to rule which it hit first. He got the connection part right - it was pad first. But tracking shows that would have gone over the stumps"
"good length at off stump. This one slides through low, at knee height. Smith walks across the stumps and just about gets bat on this to flick it to deep square's left"
"oh what a shot. This chase is tailor-made for Rahane. Looks at ease as he gets behind this back of a length delivery outside off, stands tall and pushes it between cover point and extra cover to pick up three"
"slower ball, full outside off stump, stabs at this with no feet movement, into the point region"
"slower ball, full outside off stump. Seemed to anticipate this slower ball. Shuffles across, throws his bat at this to drive on the up. Finds point on the bounce"
"good length, middle stump. Keeps low as he goes deep in the crease to flick this to deep square"
"slower ball, attempted yorker. Smith shuffles across, takes it on the full and bunts it to mid-on"
"back of a length, angled in at the hips. He whips it from there, finds deep square"
"<b>dropped!</b> Krunal has put down a sitter at short extra! First signs of a catching fielder. It goes straight to him and he's up in the air with hard hands as this comes to him. It might have been because of how Rahane shaped up. This was short and wide, so he was looking to cut. Except, it was a slower ball and he had to check his shot. Hit it straight o Krunal, who was having such a good game until now. He was side on as it came to him and in the air as he put it down"
"good length at off stump, defended into the off side off the front foot"
"slower ball, good length, defended off the back foot to mid-on"
"good length, middle stump. Goes on the back foot and pushed this to deep midwicket"
"back of a length at middle stump. Shapes to pull, gets hurried, adjusts to punch it to mid-on's right"
"back of a length outside off stump, chops into the off side off the underedge"
"slider, good length, down the leg side. Past the attempted glance"
"good length at middle stump, pushed off the back foot to deep midwicket"
"goes for the slider, drops it short at middle stump. He camps deep in the crease and whips this uppishly, just wide of mid-on, and just past deep midwicket's dive to his left. Great placement"
"full outside off stump, gets to the pitch and pushes it to long-off"
"slower ball, length at middle stump. Waits for this and glances it straight to short fine"
"a mix-up, but they get away. This is good length outside off stump, he dabs it to Hardik Pandya at backward point who runs in quickly to pick up and throw. Would have had Smith with a direct hit. Could've literally hit him too as he dived"
"slower ball, back of a length at off stump. Punched off the back foot to long-on"
"<b>glorious.</b> Full outside off stump. He puts in a half-stride, gets his head over the line of the ball and creams this through the covers"
"good length, slower ball at off stump. Gets nicely behind this, offers the full face and a high elbow as he defends"
he's in no hurry at all. Gets behind this slower ball too. It's at middle stump on a good length. Defends solidly to mid-on
"back of a length at off stump, waits on it, gets behind the line, punches off the back foot to long-off's right"
"good length, tossed up at off stump, stops on him as he pushes on the up to extra cover"
"tossed up at off stump, opens up his stance, then opens the face, squeezes this drive to deep cover"
short and spinning away from off stump. Transfers the weight quickly and cuts it to sweeper cover
"good length, drifted in at off stump. Sits in the pitch and turns away. He goes at it with only his hands and pushes with an open face to backward point"
"quicker one, fired down the leg side at a good length"
"good ball. Googly. Back of a length and spinning in from outside off. Smith was looking for a full-blooded back foot punch, but got it off the inside half of the bat, back down the pitch"
"slower ball, short and wide outside off. Rahane checks yet another cut shot. This one takes the toe and rolls along the floor to third man"
"slower ball, back of a length outside off stump. Waits for it before poking it to third man"
"good length, regular pace, angled in at off stump. Hurries him. He shuffled across and wanted to whip this to deep square, but he couldn't close the face quickly enough. A gentle push to mid-on in the end"
"back of a length, angled in from the corridor. He arches back and runs this down to third man"
"good length at off stump, walks across the stump and pushes this to deep square off his thigh"
"offcutter, back of a length outside off stump, follows the low bounce and opens the face on it, runs it down to third man"
tossed up at middle stump. He takes his front leg out of the way as he meets this on the full. Flicks without fuss to long-on
"overpitched outside off stump, mistimed drive, straight to extra cover"
"<b>nearly chips back to the bowler.</b> Good length at off stump. Smith wants to push against the turn, to take a single to long-on. But this stops on him. It goes towards the bowler, but falls just short"
"tossed up at off stump. Wants to drive through the off side this time, gets it off the inside edge down to long-on"
"good length at middle stump, defended off the back foot"
"good length at middle stump, tries to extend the back foot defence to try and get a single on the off side, can't do it, not enough pace"
"offcutter, back of a length outside off stump. Pushes to sweeper cover off the back foot"
"slower ball, full and down leg side. He plonks his foot across and plays around his pad but this is slow enough and wide enough for him to flick and get two, to fine leg's left"
"back of a length at off stump, wants to pull this past midwicket. Hurried on it, bunts it straight to mid-on"
"misses his line on the bouncer, and that's the required runs out of the way. Angles this down leg side. Rahane gets inside the line and helps it along, one bounce and into the Mumbai dugout"
"good length, wide outside off stump. Gets low, reaches out, finds sweeper cover with a drive on the up"
"nails the yorker, just outside off stump. Smith wants to squeeze this past point, but he's beaten. And that's the token over-the-top appeal from Parthiv out of the way for the night"
"good length, arm ball. Slides straight through. Rahane looks to flick this, he's struck in front of leg stump. Appeal turned down, going down leg"
woeful fielding at long leg from Simmons. This is full and down leg side. Rahane gets all of the sweep shot and Simmons runs to his left and seems to get behind it...before he takes a few extra steps and is forced to put a lazy right hand out in his recovery. It ends embarrassingly for him
"full at off stump, pushed back down the pitch off the front foot"
"good length, leg stump, swept straight to Simmons at long leg"
"good length at leg stump, gets behind it and pokes it behind square on the leg side"
"short and wide outside off stump, thumped off the back foot, straight to sweeper cover"
"slower ball, full and wide outside off stump. Watches it closely and drills it to sweeper cover"
"short and wide outside off stump, shuffles across but still has enough room to get some power on this cut. Backward point is really close, so he does well to get this to his left and well wide of Bumrah at third man"
"full and angled in at off stump, gets the front leg away and punches straight to extra cover"
"back of a length at middle stump, behind it to punch it to long-on off the back foot"
"<b>what a catch!</b> This is a slower ball at off stump. He looks to drive through the line. He isn't to the pitch and lifts this gently in the direction of long-on. Pollard runs in some 15 yards and leaps forward to take it just as it is about to hit the floor. Superb. Stands up calmly after, and signals that it's out. Not that there was ever a doubt."
"yorker outside off stump. Looks to squeeze this past backward point, and just like the last ball of Mitch's last over, he is beaten. This lands awkwardly in front of Parthiv and strikes his knee"
"tossed up at off stump. Skips down the track and flicks it to midwicket's left. He dives, put can only parry it to long-on"
"full outside off stump, looks to drive this inside-out and yet again, gets it off the inside half. This time to midwicket"
"full at off stump, squeezes it out with a drive, but extra cover leaps to his right to save the single"
"good length at middle stump, goes deep in the crease, whips it to deep backward square"
"turn. Pitches outside leg, spins and climbs steeply. Dhoni defends this watchfully, in front of off stump"
"<b>loud appeal</b> is turned down. This is good length, drifted in at middle stump. Dhoni goes down the track and looks to poke this into the leg side. He's struck in front of the stumps, but the umpire says no. Wouldn't even have seen an appeal for that some five years ago, but this looks close because of how much tech we have. The tech, however, shows it was going over"
"good length at leg stump, hangs back, pushes to deep square leg"
"good length, flat at middle stump. Defended into the off side off the front foot"
"arm ball, back of a length at off stump. Watchfully pushed to extra cover off the back foot"
"uff. He isn't comfortably at the moment. Arm ball, good length at off stump. Steps down the track and pushes it to deep square leg off the thick inside edge"
"good length, just outside leg stump. He shuffles across and looks to tap this on the head to find the fine boundary. Parthiv collects and does an impression of the crowd when Dhoni came in. Absolutely bonkers with his appeal. It is turned down. Smith is annoyed it wasn't called wide. <b>Replay shows a spike as the ball passes his glove.</b>"
"back of a length at off stump, doesn't get to the pitch after stepping out, but he uses his wrists to smother the turn and places it beautifully to tease deep square and deep midwicket, before coming back for the second"
"slower ball, good length at leg stump. Waits for it to arrive, flicks it to fine leg"
"slower ball, full at off stump. Steps out, looks to bludgeon it through extra cover, gets a thick inside edge to deep midwicket"
"full and wide outside off stump, reaches out for it and yorks himself. Gets an inside edge that goes through to the keeper"
"yorker down the leg side. Uses the angle to flick it, straight to Simmons who has his eyes on this till the last moment at long leg as he fields"
"<b>someone check the physics on this.</b> You couldn't draw a path for that to miss the leg stump if you tried. Yorker at his front toe. He looks to flick this, but edges it on to his pad. It then rolls past the leg stump, pitches, and spins as it goes through to the keeper"
"and the next ball is wide, well wide off the wide marker outside off stump, good length"
"full and wide outside off stump, slices it to sweeper's left and comes back for the second...Parthiv is livid as he collects this"
"fires it flat, back of a length at off stump. Steps out and thumps this on the up, very hard, straight to long-off"
"back of a length at off stump, steps out and slices on the up, straight to sweeper cover"
"wasn't quite in control, but Dhoni has managed to squeeze it past backward point. This was back of a length at off stump, and he was looking to hit this to sweeper cover's right. Adjusted his wrists last minute and got it square"
"back of a length at off stump, pushed to extra cover's right off the back foot"
"<b>oh what a shot.</b> He's hit a left-arm spinner for six over the third man area. He's done this by hopping into a left-handed stance, and dragging it over the boundary without changing his grip. A proper swat across the line, a proper connection"
"good length at middle stump, pushed on the up to long-on"
"full at middle stump, walks across the stumps and flicks it to deep midwicket"
"hang on! He's got Dhoni! This is good length outside off stump. Dhoni wants to make room and slap it on the up past point, but his bat is under this and he gets a healthy outside edge through to Parthiv"
"good length, angled sharply in at off stump, but Tiwary gets behind it nicely to defend off the front foot"
"slower ball, good length at off stump. Shuffles across and taps it on the up to deep midwicket"
"<b>oh this is close!</b> Loud lbw appeal. S Ravi has two things to think about - whether it was pad first and whether it was outside the line. This is a good length ball headed for off stump. Tiwary late on the forward defence. The appeal is turned down and it's a brilliant decision. This was pad first, but it struck about two inches outside the line"
"another one thuds his pad. He plays around this quick, inswinging full ball. Can't connect on the flick. This was surely going down though, no doubt"
"backs away, makes too much room, and as a result he can't connect this drive well. This was in the slot outside off for a cover drive, but he could only push it to extra cover"
"yorker at off stump. shuffles across and taps it on the full, just in time like he does, straight to long-on"
"good bowling. This is just short of a yorker length, aimed for off stump. Tiwary has the front foot out of the way as this dips quickly on him as he looks to drive past mid-off. Gets it straight to that fielder off the toe-end"
"<b>perfect!</b> This is vintage Malinga. Full, fast, swinging in at the pads and moving just enough to slide under his flick and bisect both his legs before carrying through to the keeper"
"what quality cricket this is. This is pretty much the exact same delivery as the last one, full and tailing into the pads. But this time, he doesn't just shuffle across. He goes a fraction deeper into the crease too. Just deep enough to bring the bat down on this with perfect timing and flick it to long leg's left"
"full at leg stump, watches this one onto his bat and squeezes it out to fine leg to take a single and keep the strike"
"<b>nearly holes out to deep midwicket.</b> This is a full toss, angling in at off stump. Smith is back and across, and wants to lift this with the angle over square leg. But this is slightly faster and highest than he anticipates and he lifts it gently in the direction of deep midwicket. It lands safely in front of the fielder"
"oh what a ball. Slower ball, overpitched outside off stump. Shapes to drive this through the off side, has to check his shot and push it along the floor into the off side"
"yorker, middle stump. Smith has to regain balance after flicking this to deep midwicket. Such was the precision. They can't come back for a second"
"full and angling down leg side. Looks to flick this with the angle, but it thuds into his pads and floats into the leg side"
"another masterful adjustment from Smith. Waits very very deep inside the crease, converts it into a driving length ball and then lifts it flat over the long-off boundary from just outside off stump"
"another high full toss angled in at off stump. Smith swivels and gets it over square leg this time, but again the connection isn't ideal. It's off the high pat of the bat and clears the fielders in the circle. He's annoyed, thinks that should be a no-ball on height. He's brought up his fifty by the way"
<b>finds the boundary first ball!</b> Walks across the stumps and picks this offcutter from outside off stump and lifts it over square leg. Picked the gap nicely and it's pressure on the bowler straight away
"<b>Pollard takes it at long-on.</b> Tiwary backs away this time and shows all the stumps. Expects the offcutter and gets it. Wants to hit it on the up over extra cover, there's no deep fielder there. But this is a slow pitch. He mistimes and the bat turns in his hands. It is straight to Pollard who is calm."
"<b>hits it straight to sweeper cover!</b> Everyone in a blue jersey is rushing towards the fielder there, even the people on the bench! It's Rayudu. He was in some discomfort, but he's held on to it somehow. This was full outside off stump. Smith was deep in the crease and looked to lift this over extra cover. Opened the face too much and hit a very flat, swerving ball towards Rayudu who had his hands awkwardly positioned - perhaps he was confused which way his fingers should face - but closed hem just at the right time"
"yorker outside off stump. Goes straight through, so it misses the stumps. He was looking to slice this through third man but was beaten. Christian was off the blocks quickly and completed the run as Parthiv's underarm flick missed"
"<b>dropped!</b> Hardik Pandya puts down a tough one at deep midwicket. He follows Christian down the leg side, but the length is not great. It's overpitched, and in his arc. Christian is slightly off balance and gets bat on this flick, but can't get elevation. It's flat and it's fast and it dips on Hardik who gets down quickly but can't hold on. Christian comes back for the second"
"<b>Mumbai have won the IPL!</b> J Suchith fumbles at deep square leg but recovers quickly to get a throw in and run them out before they can take a third. Mitch bowled down the leg side again, bowled it short of yorker length again. Christian swatted across the line but it wasn't off the middle. It went between deep square and deep midwicket. Suchith ran to his left, fumbled the pick up, pushed it a few yards in front and forced himself to recover. Gave Pune a slight sniff at taking this to the Super Over, but the batsmen couldn't come back quickly enough. The throw was already in as Christian finished the second run. They stood no chance as they took off for the third. The throw was perfect, on the bounce, on top of the stumps."
