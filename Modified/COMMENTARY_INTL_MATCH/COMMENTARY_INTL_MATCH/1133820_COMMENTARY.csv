"oh, dear. Four overthrows first up. What a start. This was gently defended with soft hands into the off side. KL Rahul with a throw at the striker's end, an unnecessary one, that ricochets off the bat to the boundary. Unintentional, can't blame the batsman."
"full outside off, Mendis gets to the pitch of the ball and smokes this over deep extra cover. The bottom-hand came off the blade, so he ended up slicing it but it still had enough to clear the ropes."
"slants a length ball across the right-hander, dabbed towards the slip fielder."
gets on top of the bounce and runs this short of length delivery to third man

This was short on middle, Gunathilaka, who was waiting to pull, absolutely hammers this and could've well mistaken into believing that was screaming to the fence.

"skiddy length ball on middle and leg, he gets on top of the bounce and turns this to the leg side"

hurried for pace but he manages to turn this towards square leg for a quick single
"slashed to the third man boundary. Vijay Shankar was slightly fine, and had a lot of ground to cover. He couldn't get there. This was a poor ball from Thakur, too much width. Playing to the batsman's strengths there."

"floats this full on the stumps from wide of the crease, Tharanga looks to go big again but misses it completely as this comes back in to cannon into the middle stump. It was an ugly attempted hoick and he's paid the price. Vijay is pumped."
"off the mark in style! Can't bowl too short at 125 clicks. Thisara muscles this pull behind square, sails all the way"
belted over long-off. Vijay overcompensates by bowling this too full. This was right down Thisara's hitting alley. Too much bottom hand. Magnificent
