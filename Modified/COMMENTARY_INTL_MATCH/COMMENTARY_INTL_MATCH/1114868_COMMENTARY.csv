"on the pads to start, short, should have been put away for one, but he misses a simple flick. Struck on the pad"
"fullish but outside off, driven towards cover point"
"good single, but two balls too late. Full outside off, driven to mid-off for a run to get Hurricanes off and running, literally"
"93 kph, on the pads, nudged away towards deep backward square leg for a couple"
"on the pads, whipped to square leg"
"full and straight, driven down to long-on. Tidy first over from Chris Green. Hurricanes rightly cautious to begin."
"overpitched flight outside off, thrashed between cover and mid-off for four. Drilled away."
"that's beautifully timed, but picks out the fielder. Full outside off, driven away towards cover"
"swept away fiercely through square leg. Flight down leg, poor line. Short nails his sweep, finds the gap."
"full legbreak outside off, pushed to mid-off"
"full again, straight-ish. Pushed back to the bowler. Not bad bowling or batting"
"tries to protect the over with a short googly outside off, worked to long-on"
"flat and straight, pushed to midwicket with soft hands."
chips down and works the ball through square leg for a couple
"full and quick outside off, drilled to cover. Many shots along the ground"
"shortish down leg, nudged away to deep square leg. Keeping everything along the ground, assessing conditions"
"quick outside off, no turn, 98 kph, a thick inside edge through the legs of Buttler. Slow outfield"
"a yorker, quick and straight, nudged towards midwicket"
"shortish on the pads, worked away to deep square leg. Still cautious. With the form they are in, this is not a bad strategy at all"
"full and wide outside off, absolutely hammered to mid-off. <strong>Still ground shots</strong>"
"lovely channel. Full, or just shorter than full, around off. Doolan doesn't move his feet, thick inside edge into the pad"
"a slower ball around off, 114 kph, clears his front leg and mis-times a swat to midwicket"
"one of the first airy shots of the day. A full toss around off, that's the ball to attack if ever there was one, lofted straight over the bowler's head. Bad timing but enough power"
"a slower, wide delivery outside off, chopped to cover for nothing. It's a platform for the Hurricanes, will they attack the last two overs of the Powerplay?"
"good length delivery around off, 130 kph. Doolan runs down and misses a pull. He has struggled for fluency today"
"that's just the worst result for Doolan and the Hurricanes. He took his time, stayed cautious, played shots along the ground, and all that resulted in was additional pressure. He wants to go over the top now, but the ball skews off the inside half to mid-on. It's not a good shot for several reasons, but more so because there is no failsafe if you mis-time it."
"fullish delivery outside off, 131 kph, defended into the off side"
"134 kph, full delivery outside off, punched away towards extra cover"
"shuffles right across, full delivery outside off, can only nudge the ball to midwicket. Nothing happening for the Canes"
"<strong>a wicket maiden.</strong> 130 kph, full outside off, dabbed to point"
"overpitched and straight, drilled to long-on"
"90 kph, really full, preventing the sweep, hit back to Green"
"looks for the slog sweep again, an awkward sweep past midwicket for one"
"fantastic timing from Short. A low full toss on the pads, clipped away past square leg for a couple"
"crashed through cover. That's much better than Doolan because he tries to hit the gap between cover and mid-off, even if he mis-timed it, the catch would have been good. But he connects beautifully"
"around off, pushed through, inside-edged to short fine leg"
"too full to start, clipped to deep midwicket"
"90 kph, fullish and slightly wide, carved to backward point"
nicely sliced away to deep point. <strong>Slightly lower point of release</strong>
"loads of flight on that around off, driven to long-off"
"strays down leg, extra"
"and again. More flight but the line is wrong, two extras"
"85 kph, full and straight, whipped to long-on"
"he has smashed that. Gives himself room, gets some flight, lots of it actually, nicely underneath the length and the swing through the line results in a lovely parabola for batsmen, over long-off. Sweet timing"
"a low full toss around off, thwacked down past Wade to long-off. But they only get through for one. Should have been two"
"the googly outside off, a leading edge to long-off, looking for one to midwicket"
"that's another boundary! Some flight outside off, Short unwinds and swats the ball through the line, with an attempt to hit the ball as straight as possible. Good timing again. Wide of long-on"
"full and straight, hit back fiercely again, off the hand of Ahmed towards long-on"
"slightly shorter, spins back in, chopped towards point"
"a low full toss, 82 kph, gets low and places the sweep into the gap at midwicket for two. Nicely done"
"good length around off, swatted away to midwicket"
"good length around off, chopped to point. Wanted one to third man, lots of premeditated shots"
"a slower cutter and straight, shovelled to deep midwicket. Strong bottom hand"
"picks his area and executes. Fine batting. Slightly short and straight, he knows midwicket is up so slapped over the fielder and the boundary"
"slower delivery outside off, 114 kph, chipped away to deep cover"
"six more. They're just picking the length and hitting 'em cleanly. Slightly short, Wade goes right back and nails his lofted pull. In the air intentionally and enough power"
"drifts down leg, wide."
"full and straight, a good ball so he places it in front of point for one. The point fielder's throw hits Short on the foot."
"a legcutter outside off, jabbed away to midwicket"
"a yorker around off, 134 kph, jammed out, back to the bowler"
"short around off, 126 kph, slight <strong>change-down in pace</strong>, pulled to deep square leg"
"another legcutter around off, just bunted into the gap at midwicket for a couple. Lovely batting"
"another legcutter outside off, carved away to the sweeper cover to end the over"
"a slower delivery on the pads, worked away to deep midwicket. Pace off the ball seems to be the commonality during these middle overs"
"another short slow ball, 126 kph, short-arm stabbed to deep square leg"
"a good wide yorker outside off, inside-edged to deep midwicket"
"well bowled, another wide yorker, enough pace and accuracy to creep under the bat"
"this is experience. All the change-ups, the perfect areas. A lovely bouncer around off, Short bails out of a stroke. Wily"
"135 kph, full and wide outside off, hit away to cover"
"four straight dot balls. Lots of flight outside off, driven to cover again"
"slightly short outside off, Wade waits and waits, and waits before cutting past point for a couple"
"the slog sweep and taken on the boundary. The googly (more revolutions on the ball means more bounce) down leg, Wade looks for the sweep, gets a thick top edge due to that bounce, and the ball carries low to McClenaghan at deep backward square leg. Very clever bowling, if that was his aim"
"googly outside off, driven to long-off with the spin <b>for fifty</b>, fine effort but Hurricanes need him to double it, or come close."
"another googly, quick on middle and leg, nudged to midwicket"
"yet another googly, shortish and wide outside off, carved away to backward point. Another tidy over"
"full delivery outside off, outside-edged down to third man for one"
picks the slower ball and wallops it over midwicket with some incredible power. Clears the front leg and goes BOOM
"Short's timing today has been incredulous. Full and wide, he is slightly late on the ball but times it perfectly, nails the lofted drive past cover for four"
"oh yes. He is winning this over for sure. The short delivery outside off, Short gets underneath the bouncer and ramps it over short third man. Deft touch"
"the best of the lot. Full and wide outside off, just a chip, very intentionally over cover. Sublime timing again, races away"
"a low full toss around off, 137 kph, pushed to long-on. 20 off the over."
"the sweep again, but he gets on top of the bounce, the googly again, swept to deep backward square leg"
"lots of flight around off, driven with the spin to cover"
"the googly this time, hit to cover again, against the spin"
and now he hits the ball back to the bowler. Needs to hit a gap
"short around off, didn't panic after three dots, goes back and punches to the sweeper cover"
"keeps low, the straight googly, swatted to deep midwicket. A three-run over"
"keeps very low again, but it's so short that Short (not intended) has enough time to go back and just swat a pull over midwicket"
""
"looks for that shot again, shortish on off, the offbreak, shovelled to deep midwicket"
"the other one, carrom? knuckle? Cut away to deep point from the wide-outside-off line"
"full and straight, hit back to the bowler"
"Short is on here. Runs away to 82. Short and straight, enough time for Short to go back, pick the length and place his pull through midwicket"
"short delivery around off, bunted back towards the bowler"
"full and wide, sliced past point for a couple. Well placed"
"big! Powerfully smashed. Full outside off, clears his front leg and bludgeons the ball straight, easily over mid and long-off"
"122 kph, slower delivery outside off, carved to point, he dives to his right, stops the ball and hits the stumps at the batsman's end direct does Ben Rohrer"
"shortish and wide, powered to the sweeper cover. Not well-timed there"
"the short-arm jab for four. Lovely timing, short around middle and leg, swatted away in the gap. Hurricanes' best batting performance of the tournament"
"full outside off, looking for the wide yorker, hit away to long-off"
"132 kph, a low full toss, outside the tramline but McDermott goes fetching, sliced to deep backward point"
"glove or helmet? 129 kph, aimed at the badge and McClenaghan hits. Lobs off the helmet, over the keeper"
"wide yorker, shovelled away to long-on"
"short down leg, a hit-me delivery, and McDermott says kay. Swatted behind square for four. Too easy"
"full and wide outside off, 134 kph, hit back to the bowler"
"a low full toss, looking to go through long-on but the ball skews off the outside half towards point for two"
"bludgeoned back! Full and wide outside off. With mid-off up, is that the best option? Short certainly thinks so as he nails a drive past his partner, and mid-off"
"full outside off, 132 kph, shovelled away to deep midwicket, on the bounce"
"full and wide outside off, carved away past point, just the one more"
"a nice short bouncer outside off, 133 kph, goes over the bat"

"132 kph, full and wide and called. Just outside the tramline"

"full and wide, squeezed away to long-on"
another wide. A wide yorker that is far too wide
"that will take him close, just the one though. Full and wide outside off, Short throws his hands at it, the ball takes the outside edge down to third man"
"full and wide outside off, 133 kph, gets underneath the length, picks the right area and lofts the ball with enough power and timing. Four more. The Canes running now"
"into the gap, four more. Full around off, McDermott tries to hit the ball straight, over the bowler, but the ball skews off the inside half, and finds a gap at midwicket"
"taken at deep square leg but it's a no-ball, over the waist. Too high a full toss, Short swats it away to the fielder, who is aware that it may be over the waist, gets the ball back in. On 96, but off strike"
"boundary. 124 kph, a slower delivery around middle and leg, pulled away into the gap in front of square leg. Lands just inside the boundary"
"131 kph, four more runs. Yikes, brute force. Full and wide outside off, clears his front leg and nails a lofted drive over mid-off. Panic in the Thunder"
"<strong>is he out of the attack?</strong> It's his second over-the-waist no-ball. Pulled away to deep square leg. Off he goes, can't bowl more than one in your spell"
"it's a low full toss around middle and leg, chipped away to deep midwicket, on the bounce. Just one"
"it's short and wide outside off, carved to the sweeper cover for one"
"holes out on 97! Three runs will separate him from a maiden BBL hundred, but he's done exceptionally well to put the Hurricanes in prime position today. It's in the slot, on middle and leg, and I'd say if it was the third over of the innings, that would have gone for six. But he is slightly fatigued, so the ball lands in deep midwicket's hands"
"short and wide outside off, carved away to the sweeper cover for just one to finish the innings."
"flat and straight, worked away to deep midwicket to kick off the chase"
"some flight, drift around off, driven to long-on"
"flat and straight, on middle and leg, drilled past the bowler for a run to long-on"

clipped away to midwicket
"driven to long-on, quick and straight there from Rose"
"full and wide from Mills, 146 kph, thrashed through cover point. Just hitting through the line"
"strays down leg, wide called"
"short down leg, 144 kph, nudged away towards backward square leg for a run. That's the right area, aiming at the ribs with that pace"
"terrific timing. Full and wide outside off, leans into the stroke and caresses the ball into the gap at cover."
"into the gap again. Short and wide outside off, slapped through cover for a couple. Slightly back of a length"
"good length outside off, defended to cover"
"good length around off, worked away to deep square leg"
"90 kph, four more. Full and wide outside off, Patterson gives himself room and nails a drive past cover for four. Not great timing, but he found the gap"
"91 kph, full and straight, nudged away to midwicket"
"the inside edge. Flat and straight, a thick edge on the sweep earns Patterson more runs"
chips down the wicket and works the ball to midwicket
"94 kph, on the pads, off it for a leg bye to short fine leg"

"141 kph, short delivery outside off, punched to cover off the back foot"
"short, hustles Patterson for pace, pulled to midwicket with awkward timing"
"short again, quick too, pulled to deep square leg. Generating appreciable bounce"
this is neatly tucked away behind square for a couple more. Sticking to that back of a length
"somehow he finds a gap through cover for two. Nowhere near the middle. Short and wide outside off, wanted to pull that, but the ball kept coming at him, swatted through cover"
"143 kph, shortish outside off, looking for the pull, goes underneath the bat this time"
"the Buttler scoop for six. That's audacious batting, actually that's just Buttler. Walks right across, gets a full delivery and scooped away over short fine leg"
"good length outside off, defended to cover for one"
"142 kph, full outside off, worked away to mid-on for one. Good batting, scoring off every ball"
"the slower ball and Buttler picks it, waits and waits before chipping a six over long-on with considerable ease. Superb shot"
looking to go through cover but the ball hits the inside half towards midwicket for a run
"another slower ball, 98 kph, back of the hand, just punched into the gap at cover for three. Laboured after that the fielder, allowing one more."
"short again, too predictable, swatted away over midwicket for a couple"
"it's short again, easy to pick when you bowl everything there. It's wide and slapped through cover for four. Superb batting"
"SHORT AGAIN. This is not clever from Archer, Patterson stays back and pulls in the gap at midwicket for two"
oh my word. It's too short once more and smashed through square leg for one.
"oh wow, it's the slower ball outside off, Buttler races across, gets underneath the length and scoops the ball over short fine leg for four. Not much Archer did wrong there"
"and again. He tries at least but can't connect. A short delivery on middle, Buttler would have backed his ability to take six from that, but fails to connect"
"some flight outside off, 81 kph, goes past the bat. Wade takes off the bails, but Patterson is back."
"it's short and wide outside off, hit away to cover. 'Here comes the big shot,' says Wade"
"full around off, worked to deep midwicket. Good loop"
"full, too much flight, overpitched, drilled to long-on"
"nudged away to deep midwicket, just the one more. Good over so far, can he finish?"
"good end. Short and down leg, worked away to deep midwicket"
"oh no. Short thinks he has his man. And he's walking off. It's overpitched, Buttler can't get underneath it, but can get plenty of power behind it, drills it low to Short's left, who drops an uncatchable chance. He does get a bit of hand on it and the ball hits the stumps at the bowler's end. That's unfortunate."
"flight outside off, looking for the scoop but it's too wide outside off, a thick edge to third man"
"102 kph, very quick through the air, around off, defended by Watson"
"a low full toss outside off, 89 kph, driven to long-off for a run"
"that's pummeled away. Full and wide outside off, Buttler leans forward and thrashes a drive past cover"
"97 kph, full and wide outside off, carved away towards backward point"
"short outside off, Watson goes back and punches a drive back to the bowler"
"it's a tad too short again outside off, hit to long-off from the back foot"
"nice and slow through the air, around off, sliced to the sweeper cover"
"oh wow, fantastic work from Christian. Some flight from Boyce, Watson comes down and hits the ball with the spin over long-off. Or that's what Watson thinks. Christian times his jump, leaps at the right time, and throws the ball back in as his body is in the air and falling over the boundary."
hit away into the off side
"pushed through, on middle and leg, Watson beaten on the inside edge, struck on the pad, sliding down"
walks right across and works the ball down to fine leg for one
"short and wide, poor delivery. Watson gets on top of the bounce and carves a cut behind point for four"
"good length outside off, 134 kph, dabbed to point from the back foot"
"shortish and wide, glided off the open face down to third man"
"a nice slower delivery outside off, dabbed to point"
"another defensive dab into the off side, another tidy over for the Thunder"
"on the pads, worked away down to fine leg. Just setting this up these two"
"Archer drops a clanger. Has he dropped the match? Flight on middle and leg, Buttler clears his front leg and shovels a catch <strong>straight to long-on</strong>. But it bursts out."
played away towards point
"pushed through, quick around middle and leg, nudged away to midwicket"
"95 kph, darted in around middle and off, blocked"
"92 kph, fine over from Rose. Quick on middle and off, hit away to cover from the crease."
"shortish and a tad wide, sliced behind point for a couple as third man cleans up"
"smashed. The England bowlers have been bowling too short today, sits up for Watson who smashes his pull into the gap at midwicket"
"gloved but falls short. That's actually a poor ball, short down leg, Watson is hurried on his pull. Pings off the glove towards short fine leg"
"on the pads, worked away to deep midwicket"
"a short, slower ball is helped along to deep square leg for one"
"a nice slower delivery to finish. Back of the hand outside off, carved down to third man. 10 off the over. I think the Thunder will take that"
"quick, pushed through on middle and leg, pushed back to the bowler"
"looking for the paddle sweep but Rose fires this quick and wide outside off, can't improvise a shot"
"that is maaaaasive. Flight on middle and leg, in the slot and Watson goes straight, way over long-on. The line for that length isn't good, has to be much wider outside off"
"in the slot again, but Watson doesn't get enough of it. Full and straight, skewed into the gap at square leg. Big gaps there"
"that is wider outside off, but Watson hits another gap in the field. Full and wide outside off, lofted over cover for four"
"quick down leg, wanted to clip that through square leg for two but is distraught he didn't make contact"
"118 kph, short down leg, helped along to deep backward square leg."
"131 kph, short around off, miscued pull to long-on. Hurried him for pace"
"another six. It's short around off, Buttler goes back and swats a straight six. Was waiting for that length on the back foot"
<strong>fifty for Buttler.</strong> Two on the bounce. A short slow delivery is forehand pulled through square leg for a couple.
"a slower ball down leg, off the thigh pad towards third man"
"another slower delivery, 122 kph, pulled away to deep midwicket for a run"
"excellently bowled, some loop but short outside off, chopped away towards cover"
"this is pushed through, quick around off. Watson is hanging back, pushed back"
"taken this time. Some flight around middle, maybe too much, but it was so full that Watson couldn't get underneath the length. He skews a catch to long-on, like how Buttler did earlier. The difference here is the catch is taken"
"two in two for Boyce. More flight outside off, Ferguson gets across, looking for the sweep through square leg but he gets it much better than he desired. Hit straight to Archer at deep midwicket, who takes a low catch"
"flight outside off, driven to cover"
"not going to get it. More flight outside off, a tad greedy? Buttler clears his front leg and nails a lofted swat over long-on"
"good length outside off, sliced behind point for a couple. Third man cleans up"
"full and straight, driven to deep cover."
"good length on middle and leg, sliced towards point"
"short around middle and leg, pulled in front of square leg for a couple."
"another one caught on the boundary! A bouncer around off, Rohrer has to drag a pull, but with Christian's pace, the ball slices off the top edge to fine leg, who steadies himself and takes a simple catch"
"a low full toss down leg, nudged down to fine leg"
thrashed back with Buttler-like power. Clears his front leg and smashes the ball straight back. That's Archer's 12th short ball in 13!
"big. They're still in it. Another slower ball on middle and leg, Buttler backs away, picks the variation and hits the ball over long-on."
"142 kph, full outside off, driven to long-off. Good result for the Hurricanes"
"138 kph, bowls it full and strikes! Full on off, Nair is beaten for pace and by that length. It skids on, beats the outside edge and knocks back off stump."
"short outside off, chopped towards third man"
"superb batting. A low full toss, he opens the bat face and guides the ball point for four. Very intentional"
"a slower ball on the pads, 106 kph, nudged to square leg. Good result for the Thunder"
"another slower ball, on middle and leg, pulled to deep midwicket"
"another slower ball, completely deceives Gibson. Slow down leg, Gibson is through his shot too early, struck on the pad"
"short and wide outside off, 138 kph, too quick, goes past the cut. Valuable dots"
"another stunning slower ball. Different release, different trajectory, different result. It looked like an offcutting dipping full toss that crept underneath Gibson's swat and hit the base of middle and leg. Fantastic bowling"
"lovely shot to finish. It's another slower delivery, Green watches the ball onto his bat and lofts the ball over mid-off"
"what hands. That's exceptional. 141 yorker around off. The reason he is so good at the scoops is the same reason he can flay straight yorkers through points: the speed of his hands through the line of the ball. Opened the bat face to find the gap, that's skill"
"full and straight again, hammered back towards long-off. Archer may have got some body behind it"
"a slower ball outside off, 115 kph, driven into the cover region"
"138 kph, good change-up, the bouncer down leg, Buttler gets underneath it. Marginal call, but legal"
"smashed but picks out cover. Overpitched and wide, nailed away to cover. Just the one"
"finds long-off. Did they cross? Overpitched and wide outside off, hit away nicely but can't get enough elevation, picks out long-off"
"is that the game? That may be, but there is also a send-off from Wade. Buttler's short and the Thunder are gone. A short slower delivery outside off, creeps underneath Sandhu's bat. Wade picks up cleanly and hits the stumps direct to find Buttler a few inches short. Loud celebration right in Buttler's face. End of a terrific innings."
"short around off, swatted to deep midwicket on the bounce"
"still in it! Not over just yet. Full and straight from Christian, lofted over long-on. Just clears the boundary"
"that simplifies the equation. Full down leg, a thick inside edge through fine leg for four."
"133 kph, on the pads, worked away to deep square leg for one"
"on the pads, hits the pads and ricochets to fine leg for one leg bye"
