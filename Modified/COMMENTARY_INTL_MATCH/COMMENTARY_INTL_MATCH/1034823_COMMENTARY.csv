"127 kph, back of a length and outside off stump. No love from Roy"
"good length ball, aimed wider outside off stump, Roy ignores it again."
"spots the inswinger and blocks with the full face of the bat. The 131 kph delivery begins moving in the air, then goes off the pitch too. Bhuvneshwar can extract a lot from a grassy pitch"
"<b>extra bounce</b>! Hits the deck properly this time, just outside off stump. It seems like a good ball to force through the covers off the back foot, but the kick does Roy. Lucky not to edge it"
"too far outside off stump for the batsman to have any say in matters, though Roy does try, going for a half-hearted, lead-footed cut"
"that's lovely. He pitches it up on and around off stump, doesn't quite get the amount of swing he would like, and Roy drives carefully to mid-off"
"<b>top stuff to end the over</B>. He pitches it on fourth stump, gets it to straighten off the deck and Roy, who is pushing hard while camped on the back foot, is beaten on the outside edge"
"fuller delivery outside off, Billings begins as openers should. Not playing when he doesn't need to"
"shortish and outside off, Billings moves back and across and avoids it"
"good shape away from the bat and Billings, who steps forward, in accordance to the fuller length, lets it go through to the wicketkeeper. Pitched on fifth stump and snaked towards slip"
"flirts at a fuller delivery outside off and is <b>lucky not to nick off</b>. Half a stride forward, all hands as he looks to drive through mid-off's left. Outswing does him"
"good move from Billings. Shows you how he thinks as a batsman. Sees the swing on offer and combats it by walking down the pitch. Then realising the line was wide of off stump and still moving away, he leaves the dangerous delivery"
"back of a length and outside off, carry on, says Billings again. Seems like the openers have to pay their dues to cash in today"
lovely batting. First Roy is outside his crease to negate the swing. Then he comes out towards the off side to exploit the thin legside field. There's only two there. And he flicks it over the vacant midwicket
steers a good length ball towards third man to get off strike
"walks at the bowler again, so Bhuvneshwar floats a fuller ball away from his reach, toeing the wide line with his away swing. Beaten on the drive by the outswing"
"good length ball outside off, allowed through to the keeper"
"fuller delivery, coming in through the air, Billings spots it and blocks with soft hands"
"spears a full and wide delivery to point by not necessarily moving his front leg, but bending his back leg to get into position. Has good still head and doesn't overhit the ball"
thought about reaching for this back of a length delivery veering away off the deck. Pulls his bat back just in time. This isn't an unplayable pitch. Just need to wait. The batsman just need to be patient
"strays a bit too straight, and with only two men on the leg side, Roy basically drives it wide of mid-on. On impact, the bat was very straight. Then comes a flick of the wrist during the followthrough"
"shortish on off stump, Roy hangs back and flicks it through to deep square leg"
"superb shot through extra cover. The man at mid-off could maybe have put in a better effort, was it Rahane? It's a fuller delivery just outside off stump and Billings takes a strong stride forward and hits with the swing."
beaten on the drive this time. Good on Pandya to keep pitching the ball up. He can swing it away. He has three slips encouraging him to do so.
"a touch too straight again and Billings comes forward, takes a straight ball on middle and off stump and whips it through vacant midwicket. Pandya wears a grimace. Not sure he has the control to bowl to a 7-2 off side field"
"<b>beats him</b> with a shortish delivery pitching just outside off stump. Roy is trying to defend, but the ball moves away and gets big on him"
"short and wide, and it doesn't matter how many people are there, Roy's power can deal with them. Carves it over point. That's a pretty terrible ball on this pitch"
"good length ball on middle, Roy is squared up as he defends. He's worried about the ball straightening off the pitch, and it does. Just enough"
"on the pads and Roy clips it between mid-on and midwicket. Excellent timing. Is the swing fading already? Or is this a one-off? Because Bhuvneshwar's seam position is towards slip, as he pitches on middle stump, looking for the magic delivery"
"shortish on middle, nudged to midwicket"
"fuller on off stump, pushes to mid-off."
"short of a length and outside off, Billings shoulders arms"
"<b>lovely bowling</b>. This is at 137 kph, just outside off. Billings is pinned to the crease, not knowing which way to move because the fullish length is tying him down. Then the seam movement off the pitch defeats him"
"angles the ball into middle and leg, Billings is cramped up, but he is still able to flick the ball to the left of deep backward square leg"
takes a length ball on the up and drives to cover. Makes contact off the bottom of the bat.
"<b>excellent length</b>. It's full, it's asking for the drive, and there is just enough movement in the air and off the pitch to beat Roy's nervy cover drive"
"stands and delivers, crunches this off drive past mid-off's right. Skillful cricket from Roy. Again, all he did was step forward to a fuller delivery and present the full face."
"shortish and outside off, Billings sets up for the cut, but this time the ball misbehaves by <b>staying low</B>"
"back of a length, on fifth stump, coming in towards the off stump. Billings moves across to protect it and then leaves. Dhoni takes that at chest high this time. Spungy bounce"
"back of a length and outside off, Billings pushes at the ball, with only his hands, and he is beaten by the seam movement away. England hanging on in tough conditions"
walks across and at the bowler so the good length ball outside off is slid to point
"goes wide of the crease to see if the ball can straighten down the line. It does, but with the length short, the batsman, though it seems like he has edged it, is still in control of it. Single to third man"
"this shortish delivery comes in off the pitch and Roy, aiming to cut, adjusts his shot just in time. And because he softens his hands, the inside edge doesn't go anywhere close to his stumps"
"there's another that <b>flies past the edge</b>. Billings wafts at a length ball, aiming to flat bat it through cover."
"back of a length and outside off, Billings tries to cut, but he seems to play under the ball and is beaten again"
"on the up drive, no connection again. <b>Third consecutive play and miss</B>. Good length from Bumrah. It's not his usual yorkers. it's not the short ball either. Just a good length on and around the off stump"
"<b>edged</B>, but Billings hasn't pushed hard at this ball. It falls short of Rahul at second slip. Good length, and just outside off stump"
walks at the bowler and a length ball well wide of off stump allows him to free the arms. Slashed to point
"<b>extra bounce</b> this time. Whoa. Seems like the honeymoon's over, boys. Time to face real life. And it is holding grudges. This good length ball outside off just kicks up off the deck like a cobra. Beats the front-foot slap"
"shortish and aims it at the body, Roy keeps it out"
just a little room and Roy sets up with a cut. Doesn't quite pick the gap at point though
lets this come on and glides the shortish delivery towards backward point
"shortish and outside off, cut to point"
just beats Rahane running back and to his left from mid-off. Roy wants release. He looks for it by haring down the track. Gets under a length ball on off stump and having made room for himself he is able to slash it away. No control. Just enough power
"lovely hit through straight midwicket. Roy walks at the bowler, he judges this to be the one that moves away, so he moves across to get in line with it and then works his wrists to find the gap past mid-on's right"
"continues to have the batsman in a tangle. His action is generating a lot more bounce than his team-mates. So he tries digging in a short ball, aims it at Billings' head, cramping him. The batsman goes for a hook and is beaten for pace"
hammered through extra cover. His spell of seven dots is broken as Bumrah gives room to the batsman. Flays the bat through the line of a fuller ball and picks the gap to the left of mid-off
"<b>cuts him in half</b>. This is the indipper. Comes in off the pitch, and there is so much movement too. Billings seems to be accounting for the ball's change in direction but it just does so much"
moves forward and across and flicks a length ball towards midwicket
blocks with an open face towards point
"<b>unplayable</B>. Downright trickery, really. Bumrah's action and his angle means the ball is always coming into the right-hander. Billings counts on that as he walks down the pitch, but the ball hits the deck, just short of a good length straightens past the defensive bat and goes through to the keeper."
"<b>keeps low</b> having beaten the bat. This is on a good length, just outside off. Roy tries to defend but it moves off the seam"
"on the pads and Roy, playing as late as he can, flicks it to long leg. More of the inside edge, I suspect"
"driven back past the bowler. Shows there is value for runs here. Any time the batsman have even remotely timed the ball into a gap, it hurries away. This is a good length ball and Billings just hit through the line. The impact was more off the inside half of the bat"
"good length and outside off, pushes it into the covers"
"shortish and outside of, steers it to point and pinches a quick single. That's excellent work. They beat Jadeja's arm"
"that's the worst ball on this pitch. Short, afforing all the room the batsman needs to do his dirty business. And this is gloriously dirty. A pull, standing tall on the front foot to the left of midwicket"
"good length ball at off stump, Billings defends with an open face through the covers"
"drives a length ball on off stump to mid-off with a wristy flourish. It's a difficult shot to pull off when there's sideways movement on offer, but Roy is succeeding by connecting with a straight bat and then doing the extra bit"
"back of a length and outside off, steers it to deep third man"
defends a back of a length ball on off stump into the covers
angled into the middle and leg stump and Billings flicks it through to deep midwicket
"moves across outside off to pull a short delivery to the right of mid-on. Mistimes it. It's almost as it the ball didn't come on the way he expected. What the heck's going on, Kolkata? Where have you been? The game's on."
"short and wide outside off, cut to deep point"
"pushes it through on leg stump, flicks it through midwicket"
stands up tall against a short delivery outside off and pats it to long-on
"steps down the track, trying to play for turn, but it just comes on with the angle. Billings just about manages to flick it behind square leg. They think about a single, but Roy says no just in time to send his partner back before the throw"
cramps him for room and he blocks down the pitch
"good footwork, this is just a bit short and just a bit wide. Billings jumps back in his crease and carves the ball behind point, meaning the man in the deep has to run a distance to his left"
"forces the ball away to the right of mid-on. Roy has to get up on his toes to get on top of the bounce, and then his bottom-handed power comes through with the shot. Pandya moves quickly to his right and stops the pull shot from beating him"
"that's got too much heat for the batsman and Dhoni. Short and angled into middle and leg, cramping the batsman, the ball coming up to his chin. He goes for an instinctive hook and is beaten. Wicketkeeper moves to his left, but only parries the ball away. One bouncer for the over"
"<B>inside edge</b> as the ball coming back in has the batsman, whose backlift comes from gully, in trouble. he has quick hands and his ability to play with a straight bat masks this weakness. But an indipper, pitched a touch short outside off can get him chopping on"
"shortish and outside off, steers it off the open face to deep third man, where Bhuvneshwar puts in the dive to stop a boundary"
umpire Chaudhary calls it a wide as Bumrah digs this short ball into the deck and it soars over the batsman's head
"hits him in the gut. This is a back of a length delivery, moving in at the batsman and rising more than he expects"
comes forward and taps the short delivery to deep third man. Let it come on nicely
comes down the pitch to try and work the length ball from outside off through midwicket and is struck on the pad. He plays outside the line of the ball
"nicely done. He takes a length ball, coming into middle and off, and since he has moved across as well, he is able to get the pad outside the line and sweep the ball to the long leg boundary"
steps forward and blocks a fuller delivery into the covers
"appeal for lbw, but the impact is well outside the line of off stump. Billings goes for the sweep again, and he does so by taking a good stride, and making sure to go across"
backs away and cuts a shortish delivery over the covers
"flighted delivery outside off, drives sweetly to long-off"
comes down the track and flicks the ball through midwicket. Pandya at long-on runs to his right and saves the boundary
"flighted on off stump, drives to long-off as he advances as well"
that's hoisted straight over the top! What a way to get to fifty. That's his third in three matches. It takes skill to get down the track to Jadeja and he does so effortlessly to get under a length ball and powering it over the bowler's head
"good length ball on middle, defends"
"fires it through, a flatter delivery kicking up off the pitch, Roy goes deep in his crease to negotiate it, and with a whip of his wrists he sends the ball through midwicket"
"moves back and flicks a length ball on off stump through midwicket. You might say they are hitting across the line, but that's not as much of a risk when there is <b>no spin</b> on offer"
Yuvraj pulls his length back as he sees Billings coming at him and then gets a hand on Billings' forward push to keep it to a dot ball
"shortish and outside off, Billings backs away and cuts to the man in the deep"
"waits just enough to pick the gap to the right of the sweeper. Flatter and quicker and though the ball doesn't offer much room, Roy makes a little bit for himself, waits ages and then his fast hands and a powerful late cut comes through"
goes back to a length delivery on middle and leg and pushes it to long-on
"steps down the pitch but he is beaten in flight. It's a lot slower than Yuvraj's previous deliveries. Hangs in the air, and so Billings thinks he can drill it through extra cover. But then it starts to dip and does so quickly enough that the batsman ends up almost inside edging the ball back where it came from"
stays back to a fuller delivery and he tries to slide it to point. Inside edge results. <b>That's drinks</b>
gets back to a flat delivery outside off and punches it to long-off
"he's reverse swept straight to the only man anywhere in the vicinity. The shot is perhaps on because it is a fuller delivery and there is plenty of room and Billings is excellent with this shot. This time though he can't get enough power into the shot. And Bumrah, on the edge of the circle at short third man, leaps up and takes it reverse-cup over his head. Jadeja, without looking especially threatening, strikes"
"tosses it up on middle, nudges it through square leg"
"works it through the leg side, mid-on region, although he seems a bit squared up doing so"
drives through the line of the ball outside off to long-off
"pushes it through on middle and leg, flicks it behind square leg. And that ends the Jadeja over, with him taking his 150th ODI wicket"
"pushes it through down the leg side from over the wicket, Roy ignores it"
"shortish and outside off, cut to point"
"misfield from Yuvraj at short fine leg, and he seems to be clutching his left wrist, which has a bandage on it. Flick off leg stump for a single"
pushes it through on off stump and Bairstow goes deep in his crease to flick behind square leg
"a little bit of drift leaves Roy in a bad position. Roy is camped on leg stump, driving hard with his hands, and the outside edge wanders through the vacant slip region"
works it off the stumps to midwicket
"fuller delivery on off stump, nudges to midwicket again"
"flighted onto leg stump, Bairstow clips it to backward square leg on the boundary"
"another tossed up delivery on middle, Roy pushes it back whence it came"
"that's the dart, aims it at leg stump, Roy moves back, is squared up by the ball straightening a touch and gets a little leading edge"
"does him again! The trajectory. It's all about the trajectory. This is flat, so Roy goes back, making room to cut. But the length is full. And as such the moment he chooses the shot he chooses, he is a sitting duck. The ball pitches, hurries off the pitch and crashes into middle and leg. Good innings from Roy, but a familiar end. Goes off muttering to himself. Once again he gets set and gets out"
"tosses it up on off stump, defends off the front foot"
opens the face as he reaches for a flighted delivery that seems to drift away from the batsman in the air.
"moves back, wondering if the good length ball will turn. It doesn't and he defends with soft hands, inside the line and gets an outside edge"
"looks like England are going by the when in doubt, sweep strategy. Misses the shot, struck on the pads, but it is outside off stump"
"good length ball on off stump, doesn't quite turn. Morgan gingerly defends"
"directs it into the pads and Morgan, worried about the ball turning and getting a leading edge, plays gently and gets nothing"
a lot more assured is Morgan as he pushes to long-on
"tosses it up on off stump, drives to long-on"
comes forward to a flighted delivery and nudges it to midwicket
uses the full face of the bat to send the tossed up delivery to long-off
picks up the short ball and punches it to long-on. Morgan knows the danger of cutting Jadeja against the turn
"drives to long-off, Bairstow moving forward confidently"
"leans into a flick to a flighted delivery on off stump, but he sends it back to the bowler"
"magnificent bowling. It's slower through the air. And its wider as well to draw Morgan into a shot. The defence is what he opts for and is beaten on the outside edge. That means he is playing for turn that isn't there. Certainly a lot of bounce though. That hit Dhoni on his chest. Kohli wanted a review, but Dhoni shot it down. Just dismissed it"
"that's the one that goes straight through and Bairstow, backing away to cut, is beaten right on top of off stump"
comes forward to a flighted delivery on middle and defends
hits a good length with his offbreak and Bairstow plays with the turn towards midwicket
"goes for a reverse sweep, these are desperate measures from England. Ashwin goes for an lbw appeal, but that hit him on the glove"
drives to long-on
moves back and away to leg stump to punch a flatter delivery through to Jadeja at sweeper cover
"shortish and outside off, Morgan goes deep in his crease and cuts to point"
"comes down the track to try and work a length ball from outside off square on the leg side, but he is beaten and hit on the pads"
goes back and is able to pick the gap at square leg a lot better with the extra time he has given himself
"loops it up outside off, Bairstow drives to mid-off"
"defends a flatter delivery, but pitched full on off stump. Defends"
"holds it back and with the extra action he has put on this ball, it grips the pitch and bounces up to hit Bairstow's glove as he tries to defend"
pushes it down to long-on
picks up a length ball on off stump and sweeps it strongly to deep square leg. Excellent shot. He reads the length so well. Knows he can get under the ball. And knows that it is outside off stump so he won't be out lbw. What's more he has the room he wants to free the arms
makes him play away from the body with a flighted delivery outside off. Drives to cover
comes down the track and flicks to short midwicket
"flatter delivery, but it seems to hold in the pitch and Bairstow, trying to work it from outside off stump into the leg side, finds short midwicket"
stays back to tap a flatter delivery in front of point
strides down the pitch at the slightest sign of Jadeja tossing the ball up and Bairstow lofts it over mid-off. Absolutely no risk there. England clearly want to upset his rhythm
pushes it to the left of mid-off and they scamper across for a single
pushes it through at a shortish length outside off. Morgan blocks
works a fuller delivery from outside off to a straight midwicket
paddles it over his right shoulder. Took the length ball from wide of off stump and helps it on its way. Good batting from Morgan. It's these shots that make him difficult to bowl to. It's these shots that can throw a bowler off his game
"good length ball outside off, defends"
"back of a length on off stump, Bairstow stays beside it and chops it to the right of first slip"
"back of a length and outside off, guides it to deep third man, where Ashwin keeps it to a single"
"<b>slower ball</B> defeats Morgan. He is coming down the track, looking for a heave over midwicket. But the offcutter dupes him. Could easily have been bowled, even off that inside edge he gets"
"short delivery wandering down leg, Morgan goes for a pull but he can't connect"
"shortish and outside off, cut smartly to deep point."
"goes for the yorker, which seems to dart away from Bairstow's pat as he tries to chop down on it. Beaten for pace too"
"almost a yorker on middle and leg, and Bairstow is almost falling away as he tries to dig it out. He's flicking the ball, and ends up with a leading edge to point"
goes back and pushes the flatter delivery outside off to long-on
"opens the face just a touch to try and beat the bowler, but Jadeja sprints to his left to stop the single"
realises Bairstow was coming down and pulls the length back. He also slides the ball in to reduce the room the batsman would have. So a defensive shot the result
"goes for a big sweep to a length ball on middle, mistimes it for a single to deep square leg"
nicely driven to long-on. Comes forward to the pitch of the ball on leg stump
"width offered and he slashes the ball to the left of the sweeper cover. Gorgeous shot. There wasn't much footwork, but he is so superbly balanced. And just that little opening of the face does the trick"
"that's good bouncer! It's from over the wicket, angling across the left-hander, and Morgan, going for the hook, is trying to take the ball from over the left shoulder into the leg side. Beaten"
"appeal for caught behind, but I think this is off the thigh pad. Umpire Dharmasena says no, but Kohli goes for <b>a review</b>. This is back of a length, on middle and leg. Morgan is cramped as he brings a straight bat down across the line from second slip towards mid-on. <b>Nothing on Ultra Edge as the ball passes the bat</b>. There's a spike though as it hits the thigh pad. The lbw is also checked, and there the ball is pitching outside leg. <b>India have lost their review</b>"
"tucked up by a short ball on leg stump again and here it hits his pads and wanders into the off side towards point. Bairstow, alert, picks up a single. Excellent work"
"laser-guided precision, all the way <b>down the throat of deep third man</b>. But it seems like Bumrah's bowled a <b>no-ball</b>! Oh, a veritable comedy of errors here. This is a short and wide delivery that Bairstow gleefully uppercuts to the fielder. But even as he was walking off, the umpires asked him to wait. They checked with the third umpire and down came the confirmation. There was nothing behind the line and Bumrah, who couldn't even celebrate his wicket before he heard the umpire asking the batsman to stick around, now has to bowl a free hit delivery"
"away she goes over long leg. Bumrah was going for a yorker, but it ends up a waist-high full toss which Morgan shovel pulls into the crowd"
"back of a length and outside off, taps it to point"
"comes down the track, but Bumrah does well to follow the batsman. Morgan pushes it into the covers and sets off for a risky single. Rahul is the man there, but as quickly as he did come in, he doesn't pick the ball up cleanly"
"comes down the track to a good length ball outside off, blocks it back to the bowler"
pushes it down to long-on. That's the fifty partnership
"goes for the sweep, taking the ball from outside off stump, reducing the chance of lbw and giving himself the freedom to power his hands through the ball"
"well adjusted as Morgan, aiming to come down the track, is trumped by Jadeja firing it flat. The batsman one-ups him again by opening the face and slicing it through point"
"what timing! This is a lash behind point and the Eden outfield carries it like a vicious current would a boat. Bumrah does well, moving to his left from deep point"
"unsure of which shot to play because it is on a full length and right at the stumps. Would there be turn, is Bairstow's worry. Ends up playing across the line and I think he got an inside edge onto pad"
"pushes it through on middle and off, Morgan works it to square leg"
"flatter delivery again, it's the slider, coming into the left-hander. Morgan goes for a sweep, is in a tangle by the ball not coming on as quickly as he hopes and gets an inside edge to long leg"
stays back and works the length ball off to long leg. I wonder if he's flicking it through the front of the hand
"that's the offbreak, tossed up on middle and leg, Morgan charges it, meaning he picked it early, gets it on the full and smashes it down the ground. Beautiful shot"
stands up tall against the short delivery on off stump and pushes it to long-off
"sees the batsman coming down and pushes it off the front of the bat, into the pads. Works it to short fine leg"
"excellent hit, as are most shots inside out over extra cover. Comes down the track, making sure to have the room to let his hands flow through the line"
pushes through cover to take the single. Lovely batting from Bairstow
"flights it on off stump, Morgan works his wrists over the ball for a single to long-on"
pulls his length back just enough that Bairstow coming down the track can't get to the pitch. Works it through square leg
"lashes him into the sightscreen. It's a length ball, with just enough width, and Morgan hacks the ball with those strong wrists over the Jadeja's head"
"nudges the ball into the midwicket region. A needless throw almost caused an overthrow, but Jadhav is alert backing up"
stays back to pick a flatter delivery from outside off to the right of midwicket
drags it short and Morgan pumps him over wide long-on. Has all the time in the world to swing his arms through the line. Gets under the ball and makes no bones about keeping it down
pushes it through into the pads and it's worked through midwicket
taps a flighted delivery outside off towards midwicket
"punches a flat delivery down to mid-on. He seems to be flicking the ball through with his forefinger, the sliders, with the seam pointing towards the slip"
"goes for a late but, but it's such a late decision that Bairstow's beaten"
starts with a poor ball down the leg side. He'll have to suffer a do-over
"back of a length, cramping Morgan up on middle, defends"
"tries to make his own room, but Pandya follows him with a shortish delivery, tucking him up at the hip. Chops into the covers"
waits on the back of a length ball and runs it off the open face to point
"that's awful. Much like Billings, Morgan has picked the only man in the pincode. This is a silly old ball, way down leg and he looks for some easy runs by flicking it away off his hips. Doesn't mind Bumrah who is stationed there inside the circle, like he was for Billings, and he completes a simple catch. <b>That's drinks</B>"
"beaten first ball as he wanders forward with a waft at a back of a length delivery. Think there is just a bit of seam away from the bat, and some extra bounce too"
rises with the short ball and cuts it in the air and on the bounce to deep third man
"good length ball outside off, pushes it into the covers"
"<b>some turn</B> as he fires a length ball on middle, and Bairstow, while getting forward to block, is suddenly met with a ball that veers away while also kicking up to take his glove"
opens the face to ease it into the covers
"more turn as Buttler, staying leg side of the ball, pushes at it with hard hands. Ends up helping him really as it sends the ball well wide of Kohli at slip"
"shortish and outside off, cut to cover"
beaten on the outside edge as Jadeja gets a flatter good length delivery to rip away from Bairstow's block
"trumps him with a short ball, that rises well above Buttler thinks it would. He tries to drag it from over his right shoulder as well, with the hook"
blocks a back of a length delivery at 135 kph to the right of cover
firm push to cover as he connects with a back of a length ball outside off with the full face
"ripper of a short ball at 130 kph, and it's called one for the over by umpire Chaudhary. Dug in on middle, angled into the right-hander. Buttler thinks about a hook, but bails out of it having picked up on the height Pandya generated. Well over shoulder"
"shortish and outside off, pushes it through the covers"
"length ball outside off, slaps it to point."
"and almost strikes first ball. Tosses it up, and it's the orthodox offbreak as well, on middle and leg stump. Buttler lifts it over midwicket and Jadeja on the boundary prefers to take it on the bounce, knowing that he might not have reached it"
"swept away. Excellent shot from Bairstow, moving across his stumps, picking a ball on and outside leg stump to smack it so powerfully. Places it past short fine leg too"
"it's the slider again, he's bowled so many of this this match. And Bairstow, well aware that Ashwin is not turning the ball at all, flicks it through midwicket"
"shortish and outside off, cuts it through point"
""
"attempts to sweep a flighted offbreak from outside off stump and gets hit on the pads. Appeal for lbw, but the umpire shakes his head"
"138 kph, seam movement away gets the better of Buttler. He looks to stand on leg stump and flick a ball on off stump through midwicket. As the ball wanders through to Dhoni, he just looks silly"
"back of a length and outside off, Buttler opens the face, looking for runs to third man. Kohli dives to his right from slip and parries the ball"
"appeal from Dhoni for caught behind off the inside edge and up comes umpire Chaudhary's finger. But Bairstow's gone for <b>a review</b>. It's a short ball, cramping him for room, goes for a pull despite that and it seems like he has missed it. The sound Dhoni heard was the ball hitting the pocket."
pulls a short ball from outside off to mid-on
"good work from Jadeja at point, flinging himself to his left, picking up the ball one-handed, getting up as quickly as he could and sending down a throw to the keeper's end"
"no timing at all in his on-the-up drive. It's a fuller, wider delivery. Innocuous really. Buttler goes through with his shot taking on a well-populated offside field and picks out the man at cover"
"flighted outside off, drives it to long-on"
"tosses it up on middle, Stokes is down the track with a drive to long-off"
"tosses it up, doens't look like the offbreak, so Bairstow is happy to go with a reverse sweep. Times it superbly, past short third man to get to his half-century in his first match of the ODI series. The ball is just wide enough to free his arms, but just close enough to have control over it"
comes down the track and works it to midwicket
nudges it through to deep midwicket
Kohli dives over the ball at extra cover and Stokes will be on strike in the next over... Hmm..
beats the outside edge as he pitches the ball up against the new batsman. Some movement away off the pitch does Stokes as he tries to drive on the up
"back of a length and outside off, steers it to point"
"picks the gap between point and cover point. Just enough width and once Stokes gets on top of the bounce of this shortish delivery, his power takes over"
"inside edge wanders towards the keeper. Change of pace from Pandya. Good bowling, on a good length around the off stump. Foils the glide to third man"
"fuller delivery outside off, slaps it to cover"
"good length ball on middle and off, Stokes manages to squeeze it out to deep midwicket"
"comes down the track and lifts the flighted delivery over long-on. Takes risks with a man back, and hitting against the turn, but reduces both by getting to the pitch of the ball"
"flighted onto leg stump, whips it through to deep midwicket. England don't chance Pandya's arm"
backs away from a spitting offbreak and slices a ball on leg stump with the open face of a straight bat through to deep point
"that's the arm ball, outside off, Stokes cuts it through to deep point"
"slider on middle, flicks it through midwicket"
backs away and hammers a flat delivery to Kohli at extra cover
"shortish and outside off, inside edges a pull to midwicket"
"fuller delivery outside off, drives it serenely to long-off"
"he's cut it straight to backward point, and Jadeja diving forward collects it gleefully. Pandya's showing off his tricks at the Eden. This is a little short, a little wide, but oddly Bairstow does't carve it as powerfully as he perhaps should have. Is he surprised by the ball holding in the pitch a bit. Is this a little change of pace? Nope. Replays show it's got nothing mysterious about it. But whatever it is, England lose a set batsman"
"<b>takes his eyes off a bouncer</b>. This is at his full pace, and the accuracy is superb. Right on middle stump, coming up at Moeen's badge. And he is basically taking evasive action with his bat propped up as a periscope. the ball pings off it to long leg"
""
"back of a length, darting back in off the seam to cramp Moeen, who gets an inside edge back down the pitch"
"shortish and outside off, Stokes is on the back foot, trying to push at the ball, but it straightens to take the outside edge and pop up towards point"
short-arm jabs a back of a length ball from outside off to mid-on
"gets a top-edge on the bouncer and it soars over Dhoni. Good short ball from Bumrah, climbing above Moeen's shoulder. Umpire Dharmasena says legbyes though. Kohli breaks into laughter at slip"
"that's the change of pace now, good length ball on middle and off, dabs it into the covers"
"short and outside off, nails a pull to deep midwicket"
"top-edge, onto helmet and taken at backward point. Moeen's bounced out. He looks extremely suspect against this line of attack. The umpires ask the batsman to wait to check the no-ball, but this time Bumrah's fine. He cramps the batsman for room, makes sure the ball was rising up over his shoulder, up at his nose. And in such cases, the hook, with no room to work with, is a poor shot. Although usually it sails over the keeper's head..."
"good length ball outside off, defended"
belts a back of a length delivery into the covers
"outstanding shot from Woakes, he brings up the 250 with a well controlled pull, getting on top of the short delivery on middle stump and placing it to the right of deep square leg"
"good length ball on off stump, hit back to the bowler"
"shortish and outside off, dabs it past the slip fielder and Ashwin, I think, on the third man boundary does well moving to his left and picking the ball up wit hone hand"
"short and outside off, slaps it through to deep cover and that ends a top effort from Pandya. 10-0-49-3"
"shortish and into the body from Bumrah, Stokes tucks him to long leg"
"shortish and outside off, dabs it to deep third man"
"slower ball, pitched short on middle, Stokes spots it and clips it into the acres and acres of space at midwicket"
"makes room outside leg, Bumrah follows him with a short ball, but strays a touch too far down leg. Gee, small margins"
"short, down leg and Stokes gets enough on the pull shot to beat Dhoni behind the wicket. Gloves it away"
"full toss outside off, Stokes seems to think this should come a lot quicker than it does. Skews it off the inside half of the bat to long-on"
"back of a length and outside off, Woakes tries to drive on the up and through the line, but is beaten by the bounce"
"length ball, ample width too, and Stokes, comes down the track and thumps it over long-on. Seems like he picks the slower ball. I'm not sure it matters. He looks like he is always going to go"
"lands a yorker outside off stump, and Stokes looking to slice the ball behind point, ends up with nothing. Lovely comeback"
"comes down the track, premeditating the yorker, he gets to it on the full on leg stump and drills it down to the long-on boundary. Pandey's subbing there, he can't stop it"
"gets an edge, but I think it bounced before the keeper took it. The umpires walk to each other. The soft signal is not out. So umpire Dharmasena at square leg thinks it did not carry. This is an intended wide yorker, Stokes reaches for it to try and smear it to third man. Gets a bottom edge and it clearly bounces into the keeper's gloves"
"full and on the pads, flicks it through to deep midwicket"
excellent placement from Stokes as he runs down the track to a length ball on off stump and smacks it between midwicket and long-on on the boundary. Rahul has to put in the dive to save the boundary
"bangs it in short and wide outside off, Woakes tries the upper cut but he isn't quite tall enough"
"thick edge flying away to the third man boundary and Bhuvneshwar, placed very fine on the third man boundary, does extremely well moving to his left quickly and reaching with both hands in front of his chest to pull the ball back"
"yorker ends up a low full toss outside off, Woakes slices it to the left of Jadeja at sweeper cover. Woakes puts pressure on Jadeja and he feels it. Fumbles. and allows the second"
jams down on a yorker on middle and gets a single towards point
takes a full toss outside off and whips it to the right of deep midwicket. Jadeja mops up
"tries an upper cut against a short ball angled across him and fails to make connection. Throws his head up, angry at himself"
"goes short on middle, Woakes flat bats it to Kohli at long-on"
"moves to the off side, then comes back to leg and Bhuvi almost nails Stokes' boots with a leg-stump yorker. Inside edge sends the ball to long leg"
"goes for the yorker on middle, Woakes makes room and slices it to deep point"
"beats point and third man up inside the circle. Fifty for Stokes in his 50th ODI, off only 34 balls. This is a yorker. But it's wide and all Stokes has to do is get bat on it"
"hits the blockhole on middle, and Stokes nudges it through midwicket and sets off, always looking for two. He's putting so much pressure on the fielders in the deep."
"strides down for a whip through straight midwicket and long-on running to his left fields the ball, pops it over the midwicket who sends the throw in. But by then Stokes has already collected two. Eleven off the over then"
"goes short, Woakes gets a top edge as he goes for a pull and it flies away to the long-leg boundary. England have their 300. The batsman has no control of the shot, with the ball coming up at his shoulder, cramping him outside leg. But still..."
"mid-off tries, but he can't reach that far. Rahane is the man moving to his left. Woakes knows this is going to be at the blockhole on leg stump, so he moves away, goes for a lofted drive and places it sublimely"
outstanding cricket. Scythes a low full toss on fifth stump to the point boundary. Beautiful hitting. So well balanced. So clear of mind. He knew point is up. He knew that's where he would get the most runs and so stays leg side of the ball to pull it off
"that's the slower ball. Good work from Bumrah, but Woakes is in such a zone out there that he picks it. Perhaps he anticipates it. Slams it to the right of long-on. Kohli does well to stop the boundary"
"nails a wide yorker and  gets it under Woakes' bat. With him staying leg side of the ball, Bumrah is trying to toe the wide line, with third man and point back"
"full and wide outside off, Woakes tries a square drive, but he can't connect"
"looks for the wide yorker, it's a full toss though and Stokes lashes it to deep backward point"
"lands it in the blockhole on middle and leg, Woakes pushes it into the covers"
"he is making room for himself and is surprised by the wide yorker well outside off, still ends up with good timing through the covers."
"that's outstanding. he shimmies down the track to a very full delivery on leg stump, and somehow slices it to the point boundary. How is he timing them"
"he's run out at the non-strikers' end. Stokes wants to pinch a single with the ball wandering down leg. Woakes has no chance of making his ground, considering Dhoni had tossed the ball to Bhuvi, to the righ tend and Woakes sacrifices his wicket"
"wide yorker, might well have been a wide had he missed it. Only a single to deep third man"
"shimmies down the pitch and hammers a full toss to long-off. Plunkett goes for a second run, what does he have to lose, it's the last ball and the single is already in the book. This is good scampering from England. He dives in desperation but the throw from long-off beats him"
"<b>lifter</b>, first up and Rahane is emphatically beaten. A simple, searching forward press becomes a treacherous mission as the ball veers off the straight and into the keeper's gloves."
"back of a length and outside off, dabs it behind point"
avoids playing at a back of a length delivery that kicks up off the deck
"shortish and outside off, Rahul tries to block, is squared up by the away movement and the ball bouncing awkwardly as well"
"backs away and thwacks a shortish ball on middle and leg stump over point. All the way over. And with a straight bat, not a horizontal one. What the heck?! England's openers did much the same. Taking chances, trusting the hard new ball and it coming into the bat."
"full on middle and leg, Rahul whips it handsomely through the vacant midwicket period. This is a poor ball, with only two men on this side of the wicket"
shortish and sliding down leg. Rahane tries to glance it fine but it is too poorly directed
goes very full on middle and it curls in through the air. Rahane gets his toes out of the way and plants a straight bat down on it
pitches full on leg stump and swings further down in that direction. Second stray of the over
"this seems to stop on Rahane, he is into the back foot punch to cover very early and has to check his shot to avoid being caught by the man there"
"full and wide outside off, Rahane looks for the on-the-up drive over cover and is comfortably beaten"
"late swing, beautiful late, glorious swing and Rahane is out cheaply. His feet are shackled to the crease. He is driving down the wrong line. He is not ready for this full delivery to scythe through the air, through his gap between bat and pad and take the off stump. So England's cost for their non-appeal is one mere run"
"shortish on leg stump, turns it through square leg"
"might have moved across in front of his stumps for a flick and is hit on the front pad. Both of them are on the crease though, but with the umpire Dharmasena saying no, England do well not to ask. Impact was on leg stump and so it might be umpires call on hitting leg with Willey's inswing"
"<b>beats him</b>! Spectacular delivery form Woakes. The only issue perhaps was its length, a touch short which means the ball, when it straightens, goes well past the closed face of Kohli's bat"
"poor line, and Kohli makes him pay. It's length, it's down leg and with only two men there, Kohli basically has a free hit. Four to long leg"
"full on off stump, Kohli moves across onto off stump and takes a ball from there and taps it through midwicket. Mid-on gives chase but once it hits the practice wickets..."
"good length ball outside off, shoulders arms."
"back of a length and on fifth stump, Kohli is comfortable avoiding this as well. England's seamers finally have a ball decking around in their hands against India's best batsman. Will they make use of it?"
"another short delivery, and it travels straight lines at Kohli, who moves back and pats it down to cove quite comfortably. Assume England are trying to push him back before the fuller one. Otherwise if this is plan A, it doesn't look good"
"full on middle, moving in, Rahul stays beside the ball and squirts it to cover with an angled bat"
"shortish and down leg, Rahul can just stand there and collect the extra"
"back of a length and angled across the right-hander, Rahul is unsure about it, he is worried about Willey's ability to cut it back into him. Dabs it to third man, although I think in the end he is trying to leave it"
"oooh, that's the inswing and Kohli was playing around it! Perhaps it pitched outside leg stump, and Kohli is hit on the back pad. Rahul asks for a single but is sent back"
"another wayward delivery, the worst of them all perhaps, wandering a good two sets of stumps down leg"
"shortish and outside off, Kohli goes for the lash behind point, but he hasn't moved his feet enough to make the connection."
gets a leading edge as a fuller delivery on middle stump doesn't come into him as he is set up for. The flick shot ends up at third man
another good length ball pitching on leg stump and swinging further down. Willey's radar still hasn't set itself.
"that's excellently. He lines a good length ball on off stump, makes it move in, and Rahul respects it with a straight bat."
"good length ball just outside off, defends to cover"
"gorgeous! It's the cover drive. It's the cover drive to a perfectly good ball. <i>That's</i> the Kohli cover drive. Straight bat, strong stride, picks the gap past mid-off"
"shortish on middle and off, nudges it to midwicket"
"blunts a fuller delivery on off stump with soft hands and looks for a quick single, but Rahul, rightly, says no. Woakes and short cover were too alert"
"shortish and outside off, eased to deep third man off the open face. I wonder if the swing is fading..."
backs away to try and lift a shortish ball angled into leg stump and further down - Woakes adjusts to Rahul making room - with a straight bat over cover. Hit a six in exactly this fashion in the first over. Not this time. Beaten
meets a shortish delivery just outside off with the bat face straight and pointing down
"just a shade short and Kohli, despite being on the front foot, slaps it over point. He has to do a lot of work to get on top of the ball, but is helped by the fact that the riskfree option was to hit the ball in the air, with no one in the deep"
"shortish and on the body, nudges towards midwicket"
"opens the face as he secures a single to third man. That's 1000 runs as ODI captain, in 17 innings. Fastest, they say. Beating AB de Villiers by one innings"
"back of a length on middle and leg, blocks"
"that's straight up. This will take some catching and the man with the gloves calls for it. Sensible. Ball strikes in his first over. And he does so with Rahul trying to take the game on quite unnecessarily. He is on the front foot, looking to pull a back of a length delivery on middle. The bat comes down under the ball as it bounces more than Rahul expects. India repaying the favours Billings and Morgan did them."
"back of a length and outside off, eased to deep third man"
"<b>beats him</b> extravagantly. It's just back of a length on middle, decks away off the seam. Yuvraj is caught on the crease, playing inside the line. He was sponsor-less a few days ago. Now he has one"
well left. He trusts the bounce on this good length ball on off stump
"<b>unplayable</b>. There's movement, so much that it seems like a 140 kph offbreak. And it's bouncing as well. Yuvraj is twisted up like a pretzel, playing towards midwicket and the ball going so far past the outside edge"
"full and on leg stump, Woakes looking for magic, but he is clipped to midwicket"
"neat defence on and around off stump, plays it late, and with this on a shortish length he is given that liberty"
short and onto the pads and Kohli works it behind square leg
gets behind the shortish delivery on off stump and defuses it to long leg. So will England use the new ball for a bouncer barrage against Yuvraj? When it's decking around like Headingley?
"shortish on off stump, stays back, plays close to the body and pats it down"
"flirts at a back of a length delivery, aiming to get a single towards third man, when there are two slips in place. Considering the bounce on this pitch, that is not such a good idea. Edges and falls short of Roy at second"
"full on off stump, from around the wicket, looking for swing, Yuvraj just blocks it with a closed face and it hurries through midwicket"
"back of a length and outside off, avoids it"
"full on middle and off stump, Kohli defends with a straight bat and Kolkata roars his name"
"just a whip of the wrists. He says he is strong on the leg side, but still, taking a good length ball on off stump, pretty much the same ball he defended earlier and to send it to the square leg boundary...."
"good length ball outside off, left alone"
"just waited a millisecond longer to beat backward point on his right. It's short, it's not entirely wide, but Kohli picks length so early and he has learnt to play so late that this disappears off the cut shot"
"back of a length, straightening down the line, squaring Kohli up, but he blocks it with soft hands"
"shortish and outside off, defends"
gets up on his toes against the shortish ball outside off and keeps it down
"back of a length and outside off, ignores it. Good discipline from Yuvraj"
"<b>kicks up off a length and hits him in the chest</b>! Yuvraj is stunned. He has no protection there. And he has no reason to expect this ball to come up that high. It was only back of a length. It should have thudded into the middle of his bat, which is raised at his stomach. Yuvraj takes his time to get himself ready. Kohli comes up to him, slaps hands with him and smiles, presumably saying, 'Come on, winning it from here is what will be fun'"
"good length ball on off stump, defends. Good to see Yuvraj getting forward. Even if it is but a short stride"
"fuller delivery outside off, coaxing the drive, and this is a batsman worried about the short ball, and with good reason on this bouncy pitch. Inside edges as he plays away from the body to midwicket"
"again, kicks up off the deck, Yuvraj is on the back foot, defusing it behind square leg as he takes his bottom hand off the bat immediately. Gutsy batting from the veteran. Can he hold on though?"
good stride forward from Yuvraj as he scythes a fuller delivery outside off to point. Roy can't quite save the single. England doing well testing Yuvraj on the front foot too
"fuller delivery on off stump, Kohli goes for a punch down the ground, seems to be into the shot too early and gets an inside edge onto pad"
"back of a length and outside off, no shot offered."
"opens the face and steers a full delivery through to point. Mild appeal for a catch, but this is a bump ball"
"sublime timing and it takes an outstanding effort from Billings at midwicket, moving to his left and diving to stop the boundary. Kohli makes this happen by moving forward and onto off stump, allowing him to take a full ball and flick it with those powerful wrists. Kohli going at a run-a-ball on a seaming pitch"
"pushes at a fuller ball outside off and gets an inside edge through midwicket. Signals he thinks it is the inswinger as he runs down to the other end, a huge smile on his face"
gets up off his toes to blunt a short ball from outside off into midwicket
works it away through midwicket
waits on the shortish delivery on off stump and steers it towards third man
"takes on a short ball from outside off stump, coming in at him from around the wicket, and pulls to mid-on. Comes off the bottom of the bat"
defends a back of a length delivery on off stump and it goes to the right of gully
steps forward to a fuller delivery and guides it to point. Still almost going at a-run-a-ball
"shortish on leg stump, Yuvraj shuffles inside the line and pulls down to long leg. Good connection"
"goes for a stroke a touch too expansive as he stands tall and tries to scythe through point, but the back of a length delivery cuts in too sharply. Cuts him in half, in fact"
"that's a top edge and it's <b>dropped</b> at long leg by Ball. Eden Gardens roars its approval while the fielder himself is the definition of disconsolate. Kohli goes for the pull, but the bounce  does him, the pace does him. It seems a comfortable chance. And Ball does get under it, he gets two hands to it but it pops out"
"back of a length on off stump, inside edge wanders into the leg side"
"<b>inside edge</b> past leg stump for four. Plunkett should find something to kick to get rid of his frustration. Maybe the ball. This is in the off stump corridor, has Kohli worrying about the inswing, makes him play late and he survives again"
"good length ball outside off, leaves it"
"<b>beats the outside edge</b> as Yuvraj plays a nothing shot outside off. His feet are stuck one place, his hands reaching into the other place and the bounce and away seam does him"
"shortish on off stump, nudges it through midwicket"
that's outrageous. Ball delivers an indipper so fierce it looks like a rapid offbreak. Pitching on a good length outside off to draw Kohli into a drive and then cutting through him like bike messengers in peak NYC traffic
"back of a length on off stump, Kohli defends with soft hands and sneaks a single to point"
"shortish on off stump, blocks to point"
covers the line of a shortish delivery on off stump and defends
"shortish delivery outside off, Kohli makes conscious efforts to get on top of it, wants to whip it into the leg side too but that's not happening"
there's only a gully in place and this short delivery has enough width for him to pick up an easy four to third man. Just gives it direction with the open face
"goes for a pull against a bouncer that soars well over his head, and outside off as well. Kohli is taking a risk in terms of trying to control the ball. Beaten"
"good length ball on off stump, defends to point"
"fuller ball on off stump, defends"
"back of a length on off stump, turns it through midwicket"
"shortish and outside off, pulls it down to long leg. Plunkett misfields but not too badly"
"shortish on off stump, pushes it back down to mid-off"
"flat-bats it to the long-on boundary. That's Yuvraj at his majestic best. Standing tall and belting the ball with impunity. Too short, too much width."
stands up on his toes and pushes the shortish delivery to mid-off
"fuller delivery outside off, Yuvraj looks for a front-foot punch through cover, but is into the shot a touch too early, and doesn't account for the slight inward movement either. Gets an inside edge down the pitch"
"defends a good length ball into the covers, looking for a single but his captain says no."
gets up off his toes to flick a shortish delivery on middle through to deep midwicket
"shortish on off stump, flicks it to mid-on. He's moving a little easier at the crease. Looking for runs."
"one-bounce four over midwicket. The usual, emphatic Yuvraj there. The short ball doesn't rise. Barely waist high. And he stands and wallops it so hard it's almost a let down that it didn't travel all the way"
"properly banged in, so much that it soars over Yuvraj's face. He looks like a birdwatcher, that's how far the ball was away from him"
"around the wicket now, for a good length ball outside off, ignores it"
"another pull for a one-bounce four. Plunkett is straying into the leg side, and the angle from around the wicket helps the batsman further. All Yuvraj has to do is swivel around and help it on its way"
"good length ball, back over the wicket, for a block to cover"
skirts a shortish ball down and Kohli cannot connect with his flick towards long leg. He's on 49 off 53 now
"<b>fifty for the India captain</b>. He raises his bat and clenches his fist. He's past the days of demonstrative celebrations so the clenched fist means something. Raises the landmark with a straight drive, that I think Stokes was trying to flick back onto the stumps and run Yuvraj out at the non-strikers'"
""
"good length ball on off stump, defends with soft hands and an open face to third slip"
"hit on the thigh pad in front of leg stump, as the ball seems to have kept a touch lower than Kohli expects. He's buckled over a bit after playing a flick. Seems the legcutter that deceives Kohli for the lack of pace. Stokes appeals for lbw, he checks with Morgan about a review, but this is never going to be out. Not after the umpire shook his head no"
"shortish on middle and leg, clipped away through square leg"
"shortish and outside off, lets it go"
"full and down leg, Yuvraj tries a glance but he can't reach it"
on the pads and Yuvraj flicks it through to deep square leg. Another nine-ball over from England
"flights it on off stump, Yuvraj defends inside the line a bit and gets an outside edge"
"pushes it through on leg stump, Yuvraj tries to flick, but the ball is a bit too quick for him, hits his pad and wanders to square leg"
goes deep in his crease to punch a flatter delivery outside off to long-on. Wonder how many times England have made Kohli come forward in this innings
stays back to work the shortish delivery on off stump through to long-on
leans over the flighted offbreak outside off and works it through to midwicket. Moeen wiping the ball with a big old towel. <b>Dew settling in at Eden</b>
goes back to whip a flatter delivery on leg stump through to deep midwicket to bring up India's 100
"full and outside off, Kohli opens the face and drives through the covers. There's protection in the deep"
flicks a length ball on middle and off through to deep midwicket
"goes for a hammer drive through mid-off, ends up with an inside edge. Over-eager there. Throws his head back in disappointment"
"they get him outside off! With just enough nibble, keeping the ball up, tempting Kohli to play on the up, play an expansive shot and the cover drive becomes a thick edge, so much that Buttler has to jump up and take the catch almost above his shoulder. The umpires check the no-ball, Stokes is safe and India lose their captain"
"fuller delivery outside off, watches carefully but does little else"
"back of a length and along a fifth-sixth stump line, Dhoni moves back and across and leaves"
"pushes it through on off stump, clips it to midwicket"
"good length ball on middle and off stump, blocks"
"tries to make too much of a quicker delivery on off stump but only gets an inside edge. He is on the back foot, but this is a fuller than that"
"flowing cover drive from Yuvraj, takes full toll of a poor ball, getting to the pitch of it and exploiting the room he has on offer"
"fullish on middle, Yuvraj keeps it out"
drills it to long-on as he meets a flighted delivery angled into him with the full face of the bat. Made sure to keep that front leg out of the way for the backlift to flow
"hammered to the straight midwicket boundary. This is ferocious hitting from Yuvraj. Not short enough, well wide enough, he frees the arms, stands back and watches the ball disappear"
"shortish and outside off, chops it to deep third man. The feet are moving, the swagger is there, to me this looks a better innings than the 150 the other day"
"ooh, pitch the ball up and the batsman looks uncomfortable. Dhoni shuffles across, but is pinned to his crease. Uses his hands to adjust and keeps his bat straight to save himself some blushes"
waits on the ball on middle and leg and flicks it behind square leg
"full on off stump, flicks it through midwicket"
"back of a length and outside off, left alone"
"flatter delivery outside off, punched to long-on"
"flighted outside off, works it through to midwicket"
"nudges it behind square leg, but there's a man there, England doing well to keep the new batsman on strike"
a little bit of turn and withe these leg byes <b>this series becomes the leader on the list for most runs made in an ODI series of three or lesser matches</b>
nudges it through the leg side
"goes all the way, too short, sits up, smacked over midwicket. The runs continue to flow. Yuvraj looking amazing. India looking okay."
"back of a length and outside off, no shot needed"
moves across in front of off stump and works it towards mid-on. This is a pretty full delivery but Dhoni still keeps back. His hands are quick enough and the eye is good enough to help him adjust
works it off his pads towards midwicket
"keeps a touch low, which is why Yuvraj, having picked the short ball, gets an inside edge to long leg as he pulls"
"fuller delivery outside off, pushes it to mid-off, still reluctant to come forward"
gets in line with a short delivery on off stump and blocks it
"comes down the track, Moeen slides the ball down leg in an attempt to stump him, Yuvraj flicks hurriedly and gets hit on the pads. Dhoni hustles through for a single as the ball wanders to square leg"
"comes down the track and drives down the ground, Moeen can't field it"

"flighted delivery on off stump, drives through to long-off"
nudged through square leg
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
"shortish on off stump, turns it away behind square leg. The usual start to Dhoni innings. Nudges and nurdles"
"leaps up off the deck, and this pitches on a good length only. Yuvraj is trying to defend off the front foot, and comes up to hit the splice of the bat"
"he's found the man at deep midwicket. India making the same errors England did earlier. And we're even now. Takes a length ball on middle, flicks it in the air, despite the man in the deep, and pays the price for the carelessness"
"fuller delivery on off stump, defends to cover point"
"fuller delivery outside off, he comes forward and drives sweetly to cover"
"back of a length on off stump, defends"

"tossed up outside off, digs it out to mid-off"
defends a good length ball on middle. Only a single off the over and the asking rate has tipped over eight.
"short and outside off, Dhoni goes for the pull, he gets a top edge and he clears the long leg boundary. Pace and bounce can work against the bowler too"
"fuller delivery and Dhoni, preferring to keep back, nearly pops a catch to point. When he needs to come forward, he ends up doing so very late and his balance is all awry. The hands react quicker the foot not so much"
wanders down the leg side and Dhoni helps India collect the extra
"good length ball on off stump, defends to cover"
short and wide and Dhoni is extremely good with the cut. The ball practically screams away to the man in the deep
"full and outside off, Jadhav pats it to the left of mid-on and sprints across to the other end"
"looks for a quick run after defusing a short ball into the leg side, but Jadhav, rightly, says no. Plunkett gets there too quickly"
"flighted delivery outside off, defends"
"good length ball outside off, keeps it out"
<b>sharp turn</b> as Jadhav takes a step back to cut a flatter delivery. Ends up being surprised and is luck not to chop onto his stumps
nudges the ball behind square leg
"top edge lobs over the short fine leg and then it runs away for four. Such a fast outfield. Good bowling from Moeen, pitching on middle and leg, making the batsman take risks"
gorgeous late cut and it hurries away on this outfield. Brings up the 150 for India. Just a hint of width from Moeen. And the length is a touch too short. All of that is picked up by Jadhav in a fraction of a second and he is there with the perfect shot
"thumped to the midwicket boundary. Too short, barely at waist height and Dhoni swivels on his back foot and puts it away with disdain"
moves across outside off and then nudges it through square leg
"opens the face and runs the shortish delivery to the right of deep third man, who moved fine all of a sudden without no one seeing it. Jordan the man there is moving squarer"

jumps outside the line of off stump and works it through square leg
whip of the wrists to send the full delivery on off stump through midwicket

"shortish, on the body, Jadhav moves across and clips it through square leg"
"back of a length and outside off, no shot offered"
"edged and taken by Buttler, another sharp catch, well above his shoulder to his right. Ball has had a fine night, coming back after putting Kohli down earlier. This one's on a good length, outside off, draws the big shot from Dhoni and a little extra bounce takes the top edge through to the wicketkeeper. Odd sort of shot from Dhoni, considering there is so much time left in the game, driving away from the body when all innings he hid on the back foot"
pushes at a good length ball outside off and gets a thick edge that goes past Stokes at slip
"a 143 kph indipper. Brings Pandya forward with a good length ball, then scythes through his defences like some super ninja. The stumps still stand, cowering"
"shortish and outside off, Jadhav stays leg side of the ball and dabs it to third man"

"comes forward to a good length ball on off stump, keeps it out, with considerable wristwork"
"nudges the fuller, quicker ball through midwicket"
"toses it up outside off and Pandya takes it on, hitting against the turn through extra cover. Plunkett chases after it from mid-off, dives to stop the ball on the rough practice pitches"
comes down the track for a wild hack over the covers. His lack of timing means it doesn't carry to the man in the deep
"shortish and outside off, Jadhav swivels on his back foot, waiting and waiting and then pulling it to the fine leg boundary. Good shot, controlled shot"

"good length ball outside off, brings Jadhav forward and cuts him in half with an indipper"
"fine shot, and excellent effort from Moeen at mid-off, diving to his left. An on the up extra cover drive screams away until the fielder put in a desperate effort"
"shortish and outside off, Pandya goes for an upper cut, over the keeper and two slips, but is comfortably beaten"
lots of power in this cut as Ball goes just a touch short and wide. Sweeper cover mops up

sprays it down the leg side
pitched up and he hoicks that over cover point for a couple to end the over
"beats him with a bouncer at 134 kph. Good ball, rising above his back shoulder, and with Jadhav going for a pull, he is trying to drag the ball from outside off stump. Always a risk"
"that's a whip-pull! He sits back in his crease, takes a shortish delivery outside off and lifts it over midwicket with a flourish"
"too good for Pandya. It's back of a length, outside off, straightens down the angle. <b>Plenty of help still there in this grassy pitch</b>. Any time the seam hits it, things happen"
"waits on the back foot and ramps a short ball over the slips, but Jordan, as the sub, is there to save face"
"looks to cut a shortish delivery, but without the room, he comes up short"
"good length ball outside off, Jadhav eases it behind point, having waited the appropriate amount of time to place it past the diving fielder"
"short ball, gets struck in the gut by it as he tries to pull. Pandya pulls him through for a leg bye"
"looks for an expansive drive over mid-off, and ends up playing well inside the line. Fuller delivery outside off sashays past the outside edge"
"back of a length on middle, defends it to the leg side near the midwicket region"
"superb shot. It's on the up, and it's to a very good ball, pitched up and outside off. So the cover drive skipping away makes an even prettier sight. There is a man in the deep though"
"slower ball outside off, Pandya picks it and drives along the ground to sweeper cover. Played a sensible finishing role in Pune. He'll need to stay there with Jadhav tonight"
"moves his back foot across on off stump, premeditating a pull shot. Stokes sees the movement and goes wider with his short ball and Jadhav comes up with just air"
"shortish and outside off, Pandya makes even more room and as a result he cuts and meets nothing but the cool Kolkata air"
"back of a length and outside off, Pandya rides the bounce as he cuts to third man. Jordan keeps it to a single. High-tension cricket but no one wants to be the first to break"
"looks for the late dab to a shortish delivery on fifth stump, but only chops it down to the wicketkeeper. A little inward movement off the seam spoils it"
comes down the track for a wild swipe and Woakes' good length ball only just misses off stump as it passes Jadhav's bat
"carves it over mid-off. Width offered by Woakes and Jadhav, always camping back, has all the time he needs to flat-bats it to the boundary"
"low full toss on middle, whips it to the long leg boundary. Nine off the over, good one for India. The kind that helps a flailing batsman feel a lot better. Woakes walks off with his head in his hands."
flies over third man! Pandya was looking to smack a six over cow corner. But he doesn't care. So long as the outside edge is thick enough to beat Jordan in the deep and it does so comfortably. Brings up the fifty partnership
"good length ball on the pads, works it to midwicket and looks for the run! There is no run there. Moeen has to hit direct, one stump to aim at, misses and Pandya's safe"
pulls it to deep square leg. He's good off the back foot. He's good in waiting for the ball. And years and years of domestic cricket should help him stay composed as well
"looks for the yorker, ends up with a low full toss on off stump, Pandya slices it to deep point."
"goes for the slower short ball, which Jadhav helps around the corner to long leg"
"low full toss on leg stump, whips it, in the air for a distance, to midwicket"

"fuller delivery outside off, but Jadhav prefers to keep back and push it through to sweeper cover"
flicks a good length delivery through midwicket
"moves leg side of the ball, which is aimed at leg stump, pats it to mid-off gently for a single. Calm work. Good work. Tension building"

"pulls it to deep midwicket, loads of power in the shot, but didn't place it properly"
"what connection! Brings up his fifty! This is length, and outside off. Jadhav stands deep in his crease, and yet he plays a shot that should be played off the front foot and still times the pants off it. Long-on had little chance"
"full, into the pads, works it to long leg"
"pure power from Pandya. He has the room he wants. He has the length he wants - more than that, this is a half-volley and with the mid-off up, Pandya has a free hit. Another change of bat for him"
clears point running back as he walks at Stokes to a length ball on off stump and swings into the leg side. Leading edge into safety
"shortish and outside off, Jadhav pulls to the left of long leg. He is cramped, and his bottom hand flies off the bat, indicating he didn't control it. But that's 12 off the over"
"short ball, coming into the right-hander, Jadhav is making room to slide the ball to third man, but is cut in half"
"what a shot. The ball hasn't been hit this hard all night. He knows England will be bowling short. He is deep in his crease, he has a high backlift, he pulls and the ball goes behind square before the fielder in the deep could blink"
"fuller delivery outside off, swipes it to deep midwicket"
"one-bounce four to third man. Pandya's living a charmed life today. This is his highest score in ODIs. Just back of a length on middle, cramping the batsman up. He swings, gets a leading edge and it just flies away"
"clears the front leg and heaves at a fuller delivery down leg and misses. Trying to hit it too hard. Jadhav comes up to have a chat with his partner, to calm him down"
"short on middle and leg, Pandya does well to pull it, he was quite cramped by the line, but the connection is strong enough that without a dive from the man in the deep, it would have been four"
"beautiful batting. He moves outside off, takes a short ball on middle and leg and shovel pulls it to the fine leg boundary. He knows this is the length England will bowl. It's as if he is in the team meetings with Morgan."
"shortish and outside off, dabs it to third man"
"big appeal for caught behind, Ball is sure this is out and he makes Morgan call for a review. <b>What a brute of a ball</b>. It hits the deck just outside off and just rears up massively. So much that it leaps past the bat, its handle and takes the shoulder of the man to the wicketkeeper"
"short and wide outside off, but it is slow as well. Pandya who has made room to cut, and he could easily have cut it, if not for his being duped by the lack of pace"
"short and goes down leg, it's wide"
"lifts a waist high full toss over mid-on. But there is a man in the deep. He should play more like that. He has the strength to play like that. Also, this might be the doing of a wet ball, yorker turns full toss"
"fuller delivery outside off, and because the line is that wide, Jadhav, making his own room, expecting a short ball, is nowhere near the ball to make a connection with his cut"
"India surge as Pandya has his maiden ODI fifty! it's short, its at the body, but doesn't quite rise high enough to worry the batsman. Woakes is there in the deep on the long leg boundary but the pull goes over him"
"full and down leg, Pandya flicks it to deep square leg"
"shortish and outside off, Jadhav positions himself with both feet apart in front of his stumps, opening himself up to slog to deep midwicket"
"goes full on middle and leg, Pandya slogs and gets an inside edge to long leg"
plants his back leg on off stump and swings free and the length ball is dragged to deep midwicket
"shortish and on off stump, carves it to mid-off. Misfield by Ball, because of the dew, Pandya wants a second, but Jadhav, cool, calm, collected Jadhav says no. He's in control here."
"its the slower ball, off the back of the hand, brave option, and he pitches it right at the base of off stump. Pandya guns it to mid-off. Loads of dew now. They are wiping the ball at every chance"
"full and outside off, Jadhav slugs it to mid-on"
"he's bowled him. Stokes, the talisman. England's gun player. He does it again. It's all quite simple really. Just a good length ball aimed at the stumps. You miss I hit territory and Pandya misses with an almighty slog. Walks off with a grimace"
goes for a yorker on leg stump and it clips the pads along the way to the wicketkeper
"good length ball on off stump, Jadeje taps and runs to cover. Woakes moving to his left, picks it up with his left hand and underarms it with his left hand. The wrong hand."
"digs it in on middle and off, Jadhav is unable to do much with it. Gets it on the body and has to settle for a single. Top over from Stokes, pitched the ball on a good length, at the stumps, and preyed on the batsman's mistakes. Only five off it."
slips from his hand and the yorker becomes a full toss over waist high. Jadhav skews it off the top edge to deep third man. <b>The next one is going to be a free hit</b>. Woakes has his first warning for an unintended beamer
"looks for the blockhole outside off, Jadeja spears it to deep point"
nails the yorker on middle and Jadhav digs it out just in time. Single to the wicketkeeper. England holding their disciplines in high-pressure situation. With dew around
mid-off is up and the yorker that becomes a full toss is smacked over the top to the boundary. Simple cricket. Good presence of mind. No slogging. This game keeps see-sawing
"another full toss bashed down the ground! Eden erupts! and Jaddu is at the dead centre of it all. Clears his front leg and smokes the ball without a care in the world. Without feeling the pressure. Gee, umpire Chaudhary did well there"
"picks out deep midwicket and Bairstow turns around to the crowd and exults. The game turns again! This is the back of a length delivery outside off, Jadeja hammers it right off the middle, but he fails to pick the gap."
hits down the ground again and its a boundary! Sixteen runs off the over and there was precious little slogging. This is a tad overpitched on middle as Woakes goes searching for the yorker. Jadhav stands and delivers with a straight bat. Such composure. Such skill
"back of a length on off stump, defends towards point"
opens the face to the slower ball on a good length on off stump and gets a single to third man
"fuller delivery veers it into the pads, Jadhav is looking to make room and slog it over midwicket, but the ball sneaks through, clipping the pad through to the keeper. Great ball"
takes a fuller delivery on off stump and flicks it to deep square leg
hits it straight up and Woakes takes a pressure catch at mid-on. Stokes exorcising the demons from the World T20. he goes for the length ball. He threatens the stumps. He makes the batsman make the play and Ashwin panics. Swings blind and mistimes badly
"shortish, slow as well, Jadhav is making room, trying to pull, he is scuppered by the lack of pace, he is completely befuddled. But Stokes turns around and sees Dharmasena call a wide. That's harsh!"
flicks it through to deep square leg to retain strike
"full and wide, Jadhav tries to slash it through to deep point but can't make a connection"
"goes full Chanderpaul, back foot on off stump, front foot out of the way, which prompts the bowler to put the ball outside his reach. Wonder why this isn't a wide"
"inside edge past the keeper to bring up the sixth 300 total out of six innings in this series. Dhoni is up on his feet, clapping"
plants his bat on a low full toss on the wide line. Refuses the single
"whips it to deep midwicket, it was a full toss, it could have been taken better toll of. But he premeditates, moving back and onto off stump, limiting the areas he could target. Could have swung it straight down the ground"
"low full toss on off stump, squeaks it through to square leg."
"he's hit it over the extra cover boundary! Camps deep in his crease, waits for the full ball to come to him and the power of his forearms takes it all the way. Massive hit"
"and another! Eden roars. Kohli is pumped. Dhoni has such a big smile on his face. He is watching his successor in the finisher's role. This is full, outside off, but Jadhav drums it over extra cover. Power. Forearm power"
"back of a length on leg stump, Jadhav pushes into the covers having made room. Dot ball"
"lands a yorker just outside off and Jadhav, who is camped deep in his crease, looking to hit it through the leg side, misses. Wants a change of bat"
"taken at deep point. Woakes does it. Billings does it. England edge ahead. This is a fuller ball outside off, Jadhav goes for a slice, he hasn't timed it. It's because the ball was wider, away from his reach. Robs him of his timing and off he walks having smashed 90 off 75! Top innings. Standing ovation from his team-mates. But will it be enough for India?"
"length outside off, Bhuvi swings, misses and England win. Morgan has a smile on his face. Woakes punches the air in triumph. He's held up under pressure. He's given his team something to cheer about after a wretched series"
