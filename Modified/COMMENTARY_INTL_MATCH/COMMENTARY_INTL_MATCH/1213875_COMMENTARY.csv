"slower ball I think, again on the toes, and once again clipped away square of leg for a single"
"change up. Nice from Bravo, who has dug this in very short and bowled a bouncer outside off stump. Could have been called wide actually, tbh. Was over his head as Mathews swings at it and misses"
"<strong>he's out. </strong> Mathews tried to run himself out earlier in the over, and this time he's managed it. He squirted this to short third man and set off down the track. Shanaka is not interested though, and Mathews has to scramble back into his crease. Bad luck for Mathews though, because Fabian Allen is the fielder, and unlike Cottrell he hits the stumps with his throw, and Mathews is a few centimetres out."

yorker just outside off stump. Run off the face of the bat to third man.
"Hasaranga can't make a difference with the bat today. This is a slower one from Cottrell, who's bowling from around the wicket. It's fullish, on the pads, and Hasaranga is through the shot too early as he tries to lift this over square leg for six.

"length ball on the pads, Perera clubs this away to deep midwicket to get a single"
"that's the first aggressive shot that SHanaka has managed to get away. It's another slower one from Cotttrell, from round the wicket.

"Bravo saw him coming. SHanaka ran down the track but Bravo followed him down leg, and all Shanaka can do is knock it behind square for a single"
"Fullish ball, which Thisara drills to wide long on. Pollard should have kept that to one, but misfields. This allows a second run."
"bam! This low full toss is hit very hard and very straight by Thisara, and neither long on or long off can cut that off. Good over for Sri Lanka, finally."
"Yorker on the stumps, just dug out back down the pitch, but with enough power to beat the bowler in his follow through and they can run one"

"a play and a miss and a bye! Shanaka tries the over-the-shoulder scoop again, and this is too full for that shot. It skims along the ground to Pooran, who can't collect cleanly, and they run through as it ricochets away to short fine leg"
"Shanaka's not middling them, but Thisara is! This is a low full toss, Thisara gets his front leg cleared, swings through the line and launches that high over long on for six."
"goes short now, and Thisara Perera doesn't like this as much. Still, he swings, and gets this aerially into space behind midwicket, without a lot of control, it has to be said. Fetches him two though."
"short slower ball outside off, which Perera tries to fend away behind square on the offside and misses"
"there is a middle on SHanaka's bat! This is a low full toss on the stumps, which Shanaka clears his leg to and sends absolutely scorching wide of long on for four, all along the ground."

"another low full toss, wide of off stump now, and Thisara drives this hard to Pollard at long off"
"slower ball, length, but it's quite far down leg and that's an easy wide call"
Shanaka's finally coming good! Low full toss on leg stump from around the wicket. He's cleared that front leg and swung that flat and hard over deep square leg for six.
"slower ball on the legs, slightly overpitched. Shanaka gets low and almost sweeps this, but there's no pace on that ball and fine leg can cut it off"
"almost a yorker, and wide of off stump. Perera swungs big again and tries to bash that over cow corner, but doesn't connects as well as he wants. He gets it into the gap between the legside sweeper and long on, though, and they finish the innings with a two."
"tries to get the yorker in first ball, with a touch of outswing. But he's started too far down leg and it passes behind the batsman's feet. Wide to start."
"that's a bad ball, but Lahiru Kumara's got around quickly from fine leg to prevent a boundary. That's a knee-high full toss on the toes. Simmons flicks that away behind square, but doesn't get enough power behind it to get it all the way to the rope"
"another wide behind the batsman's feet. Malinga's taking a little while to get his radar right. That took off off the pitch, and Dickwella has to climb very high to collect that one."

"this is an inauspicious start to the innings from Malinga. Length ball, but again down the legside"

"shortish again, and wide of off stump. King absolutely thumps that one square, but again Avishka is quick enough to leap to his right this time and stop it"
"length but on the pads, and Simmons goes back and flicks this nicely behind square on the legside. Deep square has to run around to clean that up, and the batsmen take two."
"down the track and tries to absolutely launch this one. It's a length ball outside off, but it's on to him a little quicker than he expects, I think, and he can only club that on the bounce to long on"
"makes room and tries to bash that through the offside, but only manages to inside edge that to short fine leg, who gets across quickly to stop it"
another big heave. This is fuller and on the stumps. A thick inside edge sends the ball skimming to deep square
"there's been a lot of big swings this over, and this is no exception. Length outside off, but seaming in just a little, and Simmons collects only fresh air with his booming off drive."
"length on the pads, and Simmons clips this backward of square on the legside again, and gets it fine enough of the deep square leg fielder to sprint two"
"oh dear. And he starts badly. Actually, that was not that wide tbh. It's a little short and a little wide of off stump. King frees the shoulders and slaps that through the covers for four."
length ball on the stumps. Worked to midwicket for a single
"slower ball does it. I mean, all Mathews balls are slower balls. But this is exceptionally slow at 104kph. Simmons tries to swing this one high over the legside, almost with a slog sweep. This full-length ball arrives too late to meet his bat though, but keeps its appointment with middle and off stump. Mathews is pretty chuffed."
"back of a length ball outside off to start. Hetmyer bashes that to mid on, where Malinga runs a little way to his left and fields it. Easy single."
"short of a length outside off again. Brandon King opens the face and tries to get this fine of short third man, but he hits the fielder"
"places it beautifully this time though. This is a length ball on the pads, and King shuffles across to flick this behind square on the legside. He hits it too square for the short fine leg to get across, and gets it fine of the deep square leg running around."
"fired in on the stumps, straightening on about leg. KNocked into space on the legside infield for a single"

"length ball, straightening on the stumps from around the wicket, clipped towards midwicket for one"
"have Sri Lanka got a little lucky break here? This is driven powerfully very straight from King, and Jayasuriya has got a finger to it before it hits the non-striker's stumps. But Hetmyer has got a foot planted just inside the crease, so he's safe."

"Sri Lanka are fielding beautifully, if nothing else. This is wide from Mathews and Hetmyer lays into a powerful cut. Shehan Jayasuriya puts in a terrific dive at point, though, and prevents a certain boundary. They can take a single, however."

"length again, offcutter, slightly wide of off stump. Hetmyer shuffles across to off and turns that towards midwicket. They think about a second but decide against."
"edged and four. This is a 115kph slower ball wide of off stump, which King tires to slam over over mid off. Gets a thick outside edge that beats the keeper and skips away to the fence. All West Indies' boundaries so far have been from King."
"low full toss, looking for the yorker, King gets under it and hits it back over the bowler, without a lot of power. They can take two as long off runs around to cut it off"

"top edge and gone! Kumara's pace has done the trick. This is a short ball, about chest high, flying over middle stump. King makes room and tries to club this down the ground I think but only gets a top edge to it. It goes straight up, and Malinga moves in from mid on to take it above his head."

"back of a length on the thigh pad, just clipped to fine leg"
"<strong>Nasty</strong>. The hellmet comes flying off. A bouncer from Kumara, ant decent clip. Powell is in no position to play this, and he hits Powell's helmet flush on the grill. The strap of the helmet is not on, and the impact of the blow pushes the helmet off Powell's head and it bounces away by his feet. Powell seems not to be shaken too badly though."
