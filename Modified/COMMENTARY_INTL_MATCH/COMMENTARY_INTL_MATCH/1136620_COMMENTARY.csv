"<b>no-ball first up</b>! That's nerves, that's jitters. The ball slips out, a high full toss outside off is over the waist. Carved to third man. Dhoni thinks it's below the waist."
"swings in from around the wicket, full and straight. Smashed to long-on, on the bounce!"
"back of a length down leg, some swing yes. Worked away down to fine leg for a run."
"good length delivery outside off, punched away to backward point"
"back of a length outside off, moving away. Tapped to backward point for a good single. The kind of single Dhawan likes to take with Rohit for India."
"shortish and wide, a bit of width. Cut down to third man for a single."
"good length outside off, 134 kph, carved to backward point. Decent comeback from Chahar."
"some pace? 137 kph, back of a length down leg, hurries Goswami. A thick inside edge onto the thigh and then towards point."
"that's wayward. Back of a length down leg, nudged down towards fine leg for two. Karn gets across to his left and cuts the ball off, but was his back leg touching the boundary? Looks like that. Yep, that's four. Good call."
"142 kph. <strong>A LEAVE!</strong> I saw that earlier today at Lord's, didn't think I would tonight. Back of a length outside off, Dhawan lets that go."
"full on leg, 143 kph. Beaten for pace again. Struck on the pad, the ball then ricochets away for one towards point."
"that same line and length. <b>And a terribly-judged second from Goswami</b>! CSK's first wicket. Worked away towards backward square leg. Fine leg gets across quickly, he's holding the ball by the time Goswami turns around. Dhawan looks at his partner mid-way through and knows that's an iffy call, but trusts his partner. Maybe, he shouldn't have. Dhoni takes off the bails with Goswami well short."
"full on middle and leg, pushed to mid-on for a tight, but well-judged single."
"too short! Back of a length outside off, Williamson drags a pull to midwicket"
"lovely shot. Backward point takes some pace off the ball by getting a hand on it. Short and wide, slashed towards backward point's left. Third man cleans up."
"nicely bowled. Full and swinging in, worked to midwicket. Absolutely no room for Dhawan. Surely a plan?"
"shortish, but on leg. Worked down to fine leg for a run"
"fuller than a good length outside off. Some swing. But it's very well played, soft hands, a dab to point for one"
"126 kph, just about medium pace but it's very tight. Back of a length on off, pushed back."
"full on off, Williamson has shuffled across so far, like he usually does in white-ball cricket. Pushed to mid-on"
"full outside off, no swing. Skewed away off the outside half to point. Two dots."
"THREE DOTS! Full again outside off, pushed to cover. Not exactly the T20 way, to bat so cautiously in the Powerplay."
"139 kph, excellent bowling. Now using the width of the crease, goes wider, full and moving back in. Pushed to mid-on for nothing."
"142 kph. Now five dots! Back of a length and wider outside off, Williamson now goes cutting but misses. Pressure now on KW and Sunrisers."
"maiden over! In the fourth over! That's a very unusual result for Williamson and T20s, at this point of an innings. An overpitched delivery is caressed to cover for nothing."
"now comes the ugly slog. Good length on middle and leg, a wild swing from Dhawan. Inside-edged into the pad for one."
"the top-edged pull waaaay over fine leg. Short on middle and leg, Williamson looks to pull, but gets a thick leading edge which flies over the fielder."
"good length outside off, dabbed towards cover for nothing"
"that's tripe. What was that? 114 kph, a slower ball, that's okay. But it's short too. Williamson waits and waits and pulls through square leg."
"thinks of carving the ball over the keeper, but withdraws from the shot late and wisely. A bouncer is way over the head of Williamson."
"smashed on the midriff! Back of a length on middle and leg, Williamson misses a pull, and winces almost as the ball makes contact with his body"
"charges down but gets a slower ball outside off, chopped to mid-off"
starts with a wide down leg.
"another typical single from KW. 135 kph, full on off, tapped with soft hands into the off side. That's such an important T20 stroke, converts a good ball into a single."
"nicely driven but finds Jadeja at cover. Full and wide, driven elegantly"
"in the slot and outta here! Full and straight, Dhawan sees that early and whacks the ball easily over long-on. That's not a bad line, but awful length with a batsman under pressure."
"too straight this time, down leg and flicked away nonchalantly through square leg for two. Good stop by Karn, running to his right from fine leg."
"much much better. Good length on off, but because he's got all those runs, this is a good result for Sunrisers. Tip and run to cover"
"well played, well bowled. Short and wide, a dab to third man for a run"
"flat and straight, worked away to wide long-on, but for one. Faf is too quick."
"short and wide outside off, cut away to backward point for a run. A good start from Karn"
"83 kph, misfield from Raina. Full outside off, KW comes down and pushes to Raina's left. He lets the ball through, slightly hurried by the pace of the ball"
"strays down leg, wide."
"the googly, lots of flight on that. Driven back to the bowler"
"slog-swept into the gap at square leg. Some flight but the line isn't great. Heaved away to deep square leg, finds the gap"
"looked for six, didn't get it. Some flight on middle and leg, swivel-heaved away to long-on"
"a slower ball outside off, drilled to cover"
"excellent bowling. The wide yorker outside off, the ball creeps under Dhawan's shot."
"132 kph, another good delivery. Using the bouncer well this time, short and down leg. Dhawan looks to pull,  but misses. Bravo and Dhoni appeal, Bravo more vociferously. No glove."
"a very slow slower ball on off, pushed in front of point for one"
"picks the slower ball outside off, full and wide. Williamson gets underneath the length and lofts the ball cleanly over cover for four."
"that's filth from Bravo. A slower ball down leg, a full toss as well. Williamson just swivels on a sweep and clears short fine leg. The catch is taken, but by a ballboy outside the boundary."
"slow outside off, pushed to long-on for one."
"some flight on middle, Williamson makes room and chips the ball to long-off for one"
"the wild slog and Jadeja strikes! Flat and straight, as anticipated, Dhawan looks to slog sweep that over midwicket but he doesn't make contact. The ball beats the slog, clips the thigh pad and then knocks into the stumps. That'll slow Sunrisers down. Again, the first over after a time-out."
"excellently played. Short and wide, spinning in. Shakib cuts towards short third man. Watson labours down, in slow motion, to his left. Allows the ball to go through"
"shortish and wide again, cut to the deep point fielder"
"flat and straight, worked to square leg for one"
"short outside off, pulled to midwicket. Mostly toe-ended."
"a slower ball down leg, worked to deep midwicket, 109 kph"
"good length outside off, comes back in with that around-the-wicket angle. Chopped to Bravo at backward point."
"good length on off, worked to square leg, 133 kph"
"a short and wide delivery outside off, Williamson misses an attempted upper cut."
"full and straight, flicked away towards long-on. Jadeja prevents two. 4-0-25-0, very tidy."
"full on leg stump, and defended towards cover point with the bat's open face"
"good length on off stump, and he smothers it with the turn. Played off his pads to square leg"
"<b>drops just short of gully!</b> And the ball then goes through for a boundary. Heart-in-mouth stuff. Flights it just a bit extra this time, and KW tries to drive. Comes off the bat's outside half, and slices it to the off side"
"quicker ball on leg stump and going down leg. KW tries to sweep, but changes his shot late. Hits his front leg, but impact outside leg"
"<b>massive!</b> Is this Shakib's night? Tossed up outside off, and Shakib's quick to get down on one knee, and thumps it over cow corner. Uff"
"full outside off again, and Shakib goes for the leg-side slog once again. Not timed as well, but still has behind this shot to send it to the wide long-on boundary. <B>Seventeen off the over</b>"
"length ball on off, and angling into his body. Tucks it towards midwicket off the back foot"
"full on off, and that's been creamed! Gets his front leg out of the way, and drives it beautifully. Finds the gap between deep point and extra cover"
"slower ball outside off, but way too slow. KW goes deep into his crease, winds up big, and then smashes this pull through the midwicket region"
"full outside off, and Williamson connects with the drive once again. But Faf's on the 30-yard circle, prepared for that very shot"
"slipped? Full toss on middle, but not of the pace that would worry the batsman. Nudged off his pads to the vacant midwicket region for a single"
"good length on off, and KW taps it off the back foot. Plays it past Shakib's left to long on, and he calls early for the run"
"<b>legspinner's dream ball!</b> Sweeeet. Full, but wide outside off, and KW couldn't pick the line. He came shimmying down the wicket trying to play it big, but the ball drifts away from the batsman, lands near the tramlines, and then Dhoni does the rest. A rare pre-meditated shot attempted by Williamson"
"length ball outside off, and zipping straight through. Pathan rocks back, and cuts this from very close to his body"
"steered past first slip! Nice effort by Ngidi in the deep, but he just failed to parry it back. It was a length ball outside off, and Yusuf used Karn's pace to place it well"
"short on middle, but spinning across Yusuf's body. He pulls it - along the ground - to the region near deep midwicket. Big strides allow him to come back for the second"
"tries the cut, but it's too full for it. Was wide outside off, but Yusuf can't connect"
"full on middle, and turning away from Yusuf. He taps it off the front foot towards short cover and calls for a quick single"
"full outside off, and he drives this straight over the umpire. Hit well, but too well. That means it's only a single as long on cuts it off"
"back of a length on middle, and Shakib chops this cut to third man. It was too close to his body for that shot to be played perfectly"
"wide outside off, and that's been slapped past point! Deep point huffs and puffs, but has no chance in cutting it off. Allows Yusuf to free his arms, and the big man doesn't disappoint"
"slower ball, and pitching on middle. Tapped off the back foot past the non-striker to long on for a walking single"
"slashed away to third man this time. Length ball on middle, and Shakib attempted that cut once again. Came off the bat's thick edge"
"short, but Yusuf manages to pull this over midwicket. Comfortably played infact, and he'll keep the strike"
"full outside off, and turning further away. Yusuf checks his shot thinking it'll be a wide, but the umpire says that's fine"
"wide outside off again, but this time Yusuf's done waiting. Big stride forward, and then extends his arms to lift it over extra cover! Ridiculous"
"full on leg stump, and Yusuf whips it down the ground to wide long-on"
"big heave, but Shakib misses it completely! Flighted outside leg, and it's the topspinner this time"
"width offered outside off, and that's been comfortably cut to deep point. They jog back for the second run. Bad throw from the deep, so the batsmen contemplate taking a third, but eventually choose not to"
"<b>sliding defense</b> from Shakib! Full on off, and he came down the ground to drive at it. Checks his shot at the last moment, but his feet go sliding. Looked rather uncomfortable. Hope he hasn't overstretched his hamstring"
"short and wide outside off, but Yusuf stands tall, rides the bounce, and then cuts it in front of cover! Slapped with disdain"
"full on off, and angling into his pads. Yusuf loses his balance as he tries to clip it off his pads. Mistimed to square leg this time"
"lands on middle, and Shakib wants to send this to deep midwicket. Slogs hard at it, but mistimes it to the sweeper on the leg side"
"offcutter outside off, and Yusuf punches it to the vacant short cover region. He calls nice and early for the single"
"full toss outside off, and that's been struck straight to Raina at cover! Bravo's going to feel very lucky. Shakib did hit it well, but Raina's a beast in the field. <b>Time out as Hooda makes his way out</b>"
"full on leg stump, and that's been whipped off his pads to deep backward square. Off the mark"
"chipped over midwicket! Lands safe. It was a short-ish ball on off, and the batsman was rather surprised. Checks his leg-side clip, and eventually lifts it towards the leg side"
"full outside off, and he tries to drive it over cover. Comes off the bat's outside edge, and flies down to third man"
"short outside off, and he attempts to steer it fine. Plays it fine, but can't beat Bravo at third man"
"<b>muscled over long on!</b> Sheer power. Back of a length outside off, and Yusuf simple pulls it over the non-striker's head. Stand-and-deliver stuff"
"length ball on of, and angling into the batsman. Turned off his pads to square leg and gets Hooda back on strike"
"full outside off, and he tries to slog it towards midwicket. He's through his shot too early and the shot's been dragged to deep square leg. Deceived completely by the (lack of) pace. Taken by Shorey"
"slower ball, but going down the leg side. The batsman did move towards the off side, but Bravo was just a bit too wide"
"full on off, and that's been driven past the bowler's left. Man at long off though"
"brilliant yorker on leg stump, but oh that's cruel! It goes down the leg side as Brathwaite skips his toes out of the way. Wide called by umpire Erasmus"
"full outside off, and that's been <b>walloped!</b> In Brathwaite's arc, and he smashes it over Bravo's head"
"deft, but well stopped by backward point. It was a yorker on off, and Brathwaite did well to steer it behind square. Good effort inside the circle"
"length ball outside off, and Yusuf slaps it to point. They need to hurry for the single, but the fielder chooses not to throw at the stumps"
"short on off, and Brathwaite mistimes his pull. It's in the air for ages, but the ball lands between deep midwicket and long on. Bravo's not happy. I think he had started celebrating as soon as the ball went in the air..."
"ends his spell with the offcutter, but Yusuf flat-bats it over the umpire for four! Rayudu at long on tries his best to cut it off, but he's just a bit too slow. <b>Dhoni's not pleased</b>"
"first strike! Back of a length on middle, and angling into Ricky. He tries to drive it straight over Ngidi, but plays it down the wrong line. The ball goes over the top of leg stump and through to Dhoni"
"in the air for a long time once again, but lands safe! Full on middle stump, and Brathwaite's leg-side slog comes off the bat's toe end. It falls just in front of long on"
"back of a length on off, and Yusuf's cramped for space. All he can do is punch it towards short cover for a single"
"tries to be cheeky, but that doesn't come off! Length ball on off, and Brathwaite walks inside the delivery's line to paddle it over short fine leg. Can't connect at all though"
"swing and a miss! It's the slower ball, but he drops the length short. Brathwaite attempts a leg-side slog, but he's through his shot way too early"
"finally connects, and that's a biggie! Loopy delivery wide outside off, and Brathwaite waits for this delivery. Gets his front leg out of the way, and then smashes it over Rayudu at long on. A good way for SRH to end the over"
"low full toss on leg stump, and that's been nudged to deep midwicket. Brathwaite pushes his partner to return for the second"
"that's all over the place! Short on middle, and angling down the leg side. Signs of frustration on Dhoni's face"
"back of a length outside off, and Yusuf tries to pull it square. It comes off the bat's toe end, so the delivery goes nowhere. Brathwaite, however, wants to steal a run, but Yusuf's not interested. Shardul chooses not to have an aim at the stumps"
"low full toss on off stump, and that's been mistimed to long off. Was in his arc, but just couldn't get his bat under the delivery"
"slower ball on the fourth-stump line, and Brathwaite misses! Gold dust. Brathwaite swings blindly towards the leg side, but he's through with his shot way too early"
"<b>flat-batted over long on!</b> He's not even hit it well, but Brathwaite's so powerful that the ball soars over Rayudu. It was short, and Brathwaite clearly hadn't timed it well, but hey, welcome to T20 cricket"
"<b>Holes out but Sunrisers finish on 178 for 6.</b> Short outside off again, and he tries to pull it towards the leg side. off the bat's toe end, and caught easily by Rayudu. Who's got the momentum at the break?"
"<b>beauty to start!</b> Back of a length outside off, the ball pitches and moves away like a snake. Beats the bat."
"full and wide outside off, more away movement. Left alone"
"well bowled. Back of a length outside off, the ball comes back in this time. That's Bhuvi's strength. Defended awkwardly."
"<strong>good stop</strong>. 133 kph, full and wide outside off. Dabbed towards backward point. Hooda runs to his left and stops a run with a dive."
"short and wide outside off, slashed away to backward point. Five dots. Pressure on Watson."
"<strong>maiden to start</strong>! Second of the match! Another beauty, back of a length, pitches and deviates away to leave Watson hanging."
"a gentle loosener to stand. Full and swinging back in, defended by Faf"
"that's width and CSK's first runs of the chase. Back of a length and a tad wide, carved away through cover. A slapped carve"
"full outside off, 129 kph, a leaden-footed drive to cover"
"full and straight, wobbly through the air, pushed to mid-off for a single."
"full and straight, 129 kph. Excellent delivery because it keeps the pressure on Watson. Defended"
"full and straight, 126 kph. Another push to mid-on. <b>Watson is now 0 off 8</b>"
"good length outside off, away movement. Guided to point"
"back of a length on middle and leg, 129 kph, pushed back to the bowler. SOOO many dots to begin."
"awesome bowling. Some nervous cheers from the crowd. Good length and straight, defended back. NINE DOTS."
"<strong>make that 10!</strong> Back of a length outside off, 119 kph, pushed to cover"
"breaks that streak! And it's five. Bhuvneshwar has the right to be seething. Good length outside off, dabbed to backward point for a run. Hooda runs in and throws unnecessarily at the batsman's end. No back-up. FIVE."
"good length outside off, 140 kph. Another slapped punch to point. <strong>Watson is 0 off 9</strong>"
"a slower ball down leg, off the pad towards backward point. A big appeal as the ball misses bat and strikes pad, but not out."
"<strong>that's closer!</strong> But still sliding. A knuckle ball down leg, Watson looks to slog sweep but misses. Struck on the pad, but going down. 0 off 10"
"131 kph, smashed for four. Overpitched around off, and drilled past the bowler. Can't bowl that length"
"back to normalcy. Back of a length outside off, guided to backward point. Hooda doesn't throw this time."
"slogged away with bad timing to deep midwicket. Full and straight, heaved away"
"beautiful bowling. Watson's pressure results in the wicket of du Plessis. He charges down, but it's the slower knuckle ball. Faf does not pick that. As a result, he goes through with the lofted drive and the ball goes straight up instead of far back. Sandeep says I got this to his team-mates. He's got it."
"full and straight, worked down to backward square leg"
"drifts down leg, worked to square leg for a run. Now 6 off 14"
"on a length outside off, 139 kph, inside-edged into the pad. Raina wants one. Watson says he can't make it."
"131 kph, good length on off, blocked back. This has been special from  Bhuvneshwar. Interesting move from KW to keep him going too."
flicked away uppishly to deep square leg for a run.
"full on off and middle, worked to deep midwicket. 3-1-9-0 for Bhuvi. He'll be back later."
the knuckle ball goes wrong. Full and waaaay down leg
"picks that length, rocks back and pulls on the bounce to deep midwicket. Rashid 'can do anything' Khan just plucks the ball with one hand. And says so what? Watson lets out an expletive. Can't quite say what was here."
"a slower ball outside off, 113 kph, sliced to point. A diving save again"
"catch that Rashid, says Watson. Full and straight, it's like Watson was waiting for that. Not even that short but he heaves it away, T20 style over midwicket. Way into the stands."
"130 kph, too straight and Watson smashes it right back. Full and in the arc. Watson can't quite get underneath it but can get enough power. Thwack past mid-off"
"a slower ball down leg, Watson misses a slog. Raina steals a leg bye, but Sandeep kicks the ball onto the stumps. Raina's full-length dive saves him. That's the commitment you want to see in an IPL final"
"back of a length outside off, pushed to Hooda at point."
"full outside off, driven to long-on with a wristy whip. Some pressure on CSK."
"it's Watson's bread and butter. On the pads and Kaul just nonchalantly flicks that over square leg. That's just a flick, people. Wow."
"lands safe! Full outside off, Watson wants to hit straight, his preferred hitting range against seam. But the ball skews over point. Rashid runs in from sweeper cover and can only collect on the bounce"
"poor bowling. Drops short down leg, pulled down to the fine leg boundary. The fielder is far too square, which means that's a terrible delivery."
"good length on middle and leg, worked to midwicket"
"that's rubbish. Short and waaay down leg, flicked away down to the fine leg boundary again. Almost went for six. His lines were awful. 16 off that."
"the legbreak to start outside off, punched back to the bowler"
"the wide legbreak outside off, drilled down to long-off for one"
"a googly down leg, worked down to short fine leg for a quick single"
"92 kph, the googly on middle and leg. Watson misses a flick, going down? A muted appeal is rejected."
"the flat legbreak, worked to midwicket"
"a wide googly outside off, turning in. Pushed to cover."
"a nice slower ball on middle, a knuckle ball. Chipped to long-on for a run. Should have been two there."
"good length on middle and leg, a wristy flick to deep square leg, on the bounce."
"clears long-on. Another knuckle ball outside off, Watson looks to muscle that over midwicket but he can only splice it. Such is the power of Watson that it clears the fielder easily."
"he goes for the catch! Good effort. A low full toss is hit away to the sweeper cover. Rashid runs in, decides to go for the catch and nearly gets there. He gets body behind ball, as my cricket coach used to say, and stops it from going past."
"knew that was his area. 115 kph, a knuckle ball outside off. Watson knows the fielder is up so just slaps the ball over the fielder. Lands just inside."
"<strong>just over cover</strong>! Wanted to always go over but didn't quite time that. A slower ball outside off, chipped over the fielder"
"flat and straight, worked to deep midwicket for a run"
"a googly outside off, driven to long-off"
"the googly around off, pushed to Rashid's left. He gets across acrobatically and throws back to the keeper too."
"another googly, punched to deep midwicket. CSK very happy with this."
"picks the googly, maybe on line. Short and wide, he goes back and pulls to deep midwicket"
"flat down leg, errant line. Just a bit of bat on Raina's sweep and the ball races away to the fine leg boundary."
"flat outside leg stump, and Watson goes down on one knee and thumps it over deep backward square leg! What a classy way to get to your <b>fifty</b>. A freebie to start his spell"
"wide outside off, and that's been cut off the back foot. Goes to the sweeper at deep point"
"length ball on off, and Raina has the luxury to go onto the back foot. Punched to mid on"
muscles this pull down the ground. Was a length ball outside off. Long on cleans up
"wide outside off, and allows Watson to free his arms. Slaps a cut to Rashid Khan at sweeper cover"
"full on middle, and that's been <b>lifted over long on!</b> Leans into this, and times it beautifully over the fielder on the boundary"
"angling into his pads, and clipped away to deep midwicket. Gets Raina back on strike"
"back of a length on off stump, but he's taken the pace off the ball. Raina walks inside the line of the ball, and nudges it to the vacant area on the leg side"
"attempts to cut it late, but he can only steer it to short third man. Watson's halfway down the wicket, so the fielder has a shy at the stumps. He misses, and now that allows CSK to take the run after all. Bhuvi the guilty man, and Brathwaite's not pleased one bit"
"back of a length on middle, but angling into Raina. He backs away to make some room, but can only chop it down to short third man"
"slower ball on off, but it's always angling into Watson. He attempts to pull, and despite it not coming off the bat's middle, the shot has enough behind it for the ball to race away to the square-leg boundary"
"slower ball to end the over. It's wide outside off, so Watson is forced to reach at it. Flat-bats it past the bowler's left, and takes a single to keep the strike"
"wide yorker outside off. Watson tries to steer it square, but can't get bat to ball. An excellent start for the bowling side"
"low full toss outside off, and this time Watson drives it over extra cover. Off the bat's toe end, but still finds the gap past wide long off. Sharma misses the yorker-length, and is punished by Watto on this occasion"
"goes short outside off, and Watson simply checks his pull shot. Doesn't matter. It comes off the bat's bottom half, but the shot soars over long on! How powerful is this man. Replays show that the knuckle ball just didn't come off"
"misses the yorker again, and Watson sends this over cow corner! Low full toss on middle, but Watson gets his front leg out of the way and deposits this into the stands. Delightful hitting"
"<b>hat-trick of sixes!</b> Length ball outside off, and Watson opens his stance to go towards the leg side. Drags this from outside off and slaps it over long on once again"
"wide outside off, but he's got to bowl this again. Over the tramlines..."
"overpitched just outside off, but luck's going Watto's way! Steers it between gully and point, and the over ends with a boundary. <b>Twenty-seven runs off the over!</b>"
"back of a length on middle, and cramps Raina for space. But still he manages to clip it off his hips to deep backward square"
"length ball on middle, but Watson mistimes his pull. Played along the ground to sweeper on the leg side"
"goes short! Brathwaite's appealing for the caught behind, and Williamson reviews. It was a quick delivery that rose onto Raina. Raina misses the pull, and the ball brushes his top glove. Raina's walking even before the third umpire gives his decision. <b>Rayudu's already made his way out</b>"
"good length outside off, and Rayudu opens his bat's face to run this down to Bhuvi at third man"
"chops it past short third man for another boundary! <b>Moves on to the nineties</b> It was angling into the batsman, but he did really well to open his bat's face"
"yorker on leg stump, and going down the leg side. Watson does well to skip away from the ball's line"
"slower ball outside off, and that's in Watto's arc. Stands tall and pulls this over deep midwicket. What a show from Watto. <b>Ninety-seven runs</b>"
"full on off, and defended towards the leg side. Goswami scampers across to stop the single"
"edged to first slip! But goes to the fielder on the bounce. Pitches outside off, and spins into Rayudu"
"extra bounce! Short on off, and turning into the batsman again. Whipped off his hips to short fine leg"
full on off and zipping straight through. Fended off the back foot on this occasion
"ripper! Full outisde off and it's the wrong'un once again. Hits his front pad, but looks like impact is outside off. The appeal for lbw is turned down as well but Rashid has convinced his captain to review. Missing everything"
"length ball on middle, and he glances it fine down the leg side. Work for the man at short fine leg. <B>Final time out of the season</b>"
"length ball on middle, and angling into his body. Cramped for space, so fended towards the leg side"
"back of a length outside off, and punched off the back foot to cover. Starts the over with two dot balls"
"short ball, and it's the offcutter too, but Rayudu picks the length early. Comes dancing down the wicket and then slaps it inside out over long off. Ambati's done waiting"
"slower ball again. Fuller outside off, and driven away from his body to KW at cover"
"back of a length outside off, and slapped to deep point. Well stopped by the man in the deep"
"back of a length on off, and Watson fends it off the back foot. Comes off the bat's outside edge and runs down to third man"
"full on off, but it's not spinning. Watson drives it past the non-striker to long on. <b>Moves to 99</b>"
"full just outside off, and driven with the turn to long off. Gets Watson back on strike and <b>the crowd's gone ballistic</b>"
"full outside off, and defended with soft hands to cover. They take the single and <b>that's an IPL hundred for Watson</b> The first IPL finals hundred while chasing, the second in all IPL finals. Take a bow, legend. Also his second of the season"
"full on leg stump, and worked off the front foot to the leg side. Calls early for the single"
"full on off, but Watson's picked the wrong'un. Goes down on one knee, and then ramps it past the keeper's left. He's doing this in style!"
<b>dropped just in front of Hooda at deep backward square!</b> And then it bounces away to the boundary. A horror evening for Hooda. It was a full ball on middle that Watson had slog swept to the leg side
