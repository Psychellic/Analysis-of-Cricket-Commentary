"good ball, good shot, good fielding - it's on a good length on off stump again, but McCollum sends it between cover and point. Might have rolled away for a four, but Rashid Khan chases it down, dives, and pulls it back."

works this off his pads to deep square
beauty! Stifled appeal but he's been given. Played for the one that nips away but this cuts in to cramp him for room and possibly tickle the inside edge through to the keeper. Balbirnie doesn't exude the body language of someone hard done by.

"<b>beauty, and caught behind</b>. Another one that is back of a length and moving across him, but he pitched this on off, altered the line a bit, he was pitching them on middle and leg and going across. The change in line meant the batsman found himself reaching for the ball more and ended up nicking it while it was rising, straight to the keeper."

eased down to long-off
"massive appeal as he plays all around the full ball drifting in, umpire George reckons he may have been struck outside off. He was also down the pitch to meet the ball, may have been saved by that."
"lifter that raps him on the glove as he hops back o defend. <b> Nabi wincing in pain and immediately calls for attention. </b> Some damage to the right index finger. Stinging blow, in this cold, it must hurt him even more. Seems like we're going to be in for a lengthy delay."
"beaten as he shapes to play a big booming cover drive, didn't get to the pitch"

"chipped to long-on, will keep strike"
"<b>caught by mid-off</b>. Rashid's cameo ends! Rankin dug it in short and outside off, the toughest length and line to try and pull, but Rashid tried to fetch it anyway, gets a top edge that goes in the air to mid-off, and Ireland are firmly on top now"
"back of a length outside off, he's moved well across to get behind the line and defend it into the offside"
"fuller and slower ball, but he waits for it and defends it back with a straight bat"
"<b>caught by the keeper off a top edge</b>. Dug this in short again, Dawlat was moving across once again, and tried to pull it fine, but only got a top edge. Looped straight behind for a dolly of a catch. This could all end quickly"

"well Alam was expecting the short one, backed away a long way, but Rankin bowled a length ball nipping into him, and he jabs it towards point"

"good length on the stumps, he gets nicely behind it and blocks it back to the bowler"
"<b>taken at long-on</b>. Good length ball outside off, and Naib wanted to go straight down the ground, but got it off the inside half and it flew straight down long-on's throat. Ireland a wicket away now"
"full ball on the stumps, Mujeeb drives firmly from the crease to mid-on, who makes an athletic tumbling stop"
"<b>brilliant return catch to end the game</b>. Backed away, this was a yorker on middle stump and Mujeeb made the room to drill this back, but Adair was in the way and got his hands up to take a reflex catch very smartly. Ireland have wrapped this up very quickly, and won by 72 runs."
