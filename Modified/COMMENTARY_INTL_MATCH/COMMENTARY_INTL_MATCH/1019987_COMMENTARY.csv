"good length ball outside off, waits for it to come on before opening the face of his bat and steering it to gully"
late movement into the left-hander and that is perilously close to the off-stump. The batsman was playing for the angle and was sticking his bat out looking to play into the off side. Not much feet and the ball nips back in to beat the inside edge and misses the off stump by a whisker
"similar delivery again, misses the off-stump by inches as it shoots back in from the good length region and beats the inside edge"
defended back to the bowler
New Zealand have gone for an appeal here after making a very confident appeal for caught behind. Not out is the decision. Looks like that has brushed the shoulder on its way to the keeper. Nothing on snicko or zoomer as the ball passes the bat. It was a short ball and comes in a little bit and climbs on the batsman as he awkwardly looks to get out of its way and the on-field call remains

"fuller ball, nipping in late, gets an inside edge to midwicket for a single"

goes for a drive at this fullish ball that is angled in towards off. But there is late away movement and beats the batsman. Mahmudullah is going hard after the ball and needs to be careful

"fuller ball, comes forward and squeezes it out to backward point"
good delivery but Shakib is equal to the task. It was full and swinging away. There was a big risk in chasing that but Shakib is forward and across and just eases it through the covers. DId not try to hit it hard and he finds the middle of the bat

"sprayed down the leg side, tries to glance it and does not make contact"

full and wide and Shakib drillls a drive through cover-point. That was punched hard and he did well to keep it along the ground. Bangladesh punishing any width that New Zealand are offering here
"and again, sees width and frees his arms. Only that it is shorter in length this time and Shakib lays into a square cut"

"hits him full on the boot and there is an appeal for lbw. Not out says umpire Paul Reiffel and New Zealand have opted for the review. Seems like the impact may be outside off. There is not bat involved, HotSpot confirms. As does snicko. Ball-tracking shows that the impact is outside off and the on-field call stays  so the batsman survives.

"back of a length outside off, swing and a miss"
"Rubel has copped a painful blow below his elbow. And it's on his bowling arm. He's down, in some pain and is being attended to. That was one nasty blow.

Yes-and-no situation and the throw misses the stumps at the striker's end. It was Latham's call and he shuts his eyes after that but Raval assures him all's well"
"<b>put down at second slip</b>. That's a regulation catch and Sabbir is the culprit. Great bowling by Taskin as he fires a tempter, pitches it right up and does the batsman in with the angle as well as late movement. Goes at a comfortable height to the fielder off the outside edge and he makes a mess of it. Got to feel for Taskin, he's bowled superbly"

"drags it on and Raval is on his way. Short ball, tries to pull it away and drags it back on to the stumps. Not much room to pull this away really though it was short and that means he cannot find the middle of the bat. So the bowling change has worked. Bangladesh have their first breakthrough of the morning and drinks are on the field"
"back of a length on off and middle, worked away off the back foot through square leg"
"what a delivery to get the New Zealand captain! That was an unplayable ball. Full, pitched right up and gets it to prodigiously move away and it takes the outside edge of Williamson at around the sixth-stump channel which is taken by the wicketkeeper. Double blow for New Zealand. And that is also the <b>first Test dismissal for Nurul Hasan</b>"
some excitement from Bangladesh. Angling in and straightening at around middle stump line and Taylor just manages to flick it away to midwicket
poor delivery to end the over but an excellent over nonetheless. Short and down the leg side and Taylor does not bother going after it
defended to the leg side after shuffling across to this length ball on middle and leg
"short ball, ducked under"
"short of a length and angling away, pretty quick, comes on at 139 clicks, Latham drops it just wide of point and rejects the single"
"short ball, down the leg side, lifts his bat and lets it go"
"back of a length, pitching outside leg, tucks it away behind square on the leg side"
flashes his blade outside off and nearly edges it. Bangladesh make an excited appeal but it is not given. And they decide not to go for the review. But that was mighty slog. Ill-advised shot from Taylor as he goes after a very wide delivery outside off with an angled bat
"comes neatly forward and a long way across to this length ball and tries to push off the front foot, gets it off the splice towards point"
"short of a length, comes on straight and on the stumps, shuffles across and gets on top of the bounce before bunting it with a dead straight bat down the pitch"
"fullish and very wide outside off, not close enough to make the batsman play"
"short ball, gets up steeply, so much that the batsman barely has to duck. Good take by the wicketkeeper as he leaps up a long way to get his hands on it. It's too high and called a wide"
"back of a length and outside off, defended off the backfoot to covers"
"short ball, swivels around with the pull and the ball goes to the right of the square leg umpire and comfortably beats the fielder giving it a chase"
"good length, angling across, very close to off but Latham has covered the line and knows his off-stump and do does not bother playing it"
"fuller ball, comes forward and pushes it into covers"
"short ball outside off, gets his head out of the way as he arches back and sways out its line"
"length ball, tries to tuck it with the angle to the leg side but misses it and gets hit high on the pad, so it takes the lbw out of the equation as Bangladesh make an appeal. And in any case, the angle seemed like it would have missed leg. Taylor was probably done in by the extra bounce there"
"short ball outside off, arches back to sway out of the line of the delivery as the ball goes through to the wicketkepeer"
"Taylor again pokes at one outside off and gets beaten for his troubles. And it is again very close. Actually, he withdraws his bat but makes the decision late as he sees the width on this length ball. Could have edged it but safe in the end"

"short of a length, no movement, jumps up to ride the bounce and drops it in front of the vacant covers region for an easy single"
"<b>nasty short ball</b>, probably did not bounce as much as he expected. Kind of comes back in as well. Latham was arching back and has to do so a long way as it does not bounce as much as he expects it to. Still not enough as it hits him flush on the grill and the back protection of the helmet comes flying off. That looked nasty"
"short ball again, good bouncer again, well-directed but he plays it equally well into the off side as he keeps it down after getting on top of the bounce"
persists with the short ball and Latham gets under it

"full, straight, eased back towards the bowler"
"sprayed on the pads at pace - 136.9 kph, Taylor clips it through square leg and there are some oohs and aahs as the ball stays in the air. But it gets past the fielder diving with outstretched hands to his right and they take three by the time it is cut off before the boundary"
good length on leg and middle and Latham quietly comes forward and defends to the leg side
"short and wide outside off, he has enough time to get in position and punches it off the backfoot to the square third man boundary. It is vacant there and the ball goes to the boundary"

"good length, holding its line on the fourth-stump channel, Taylor shoulders arms"

"fullish, angled in outside off, comes forward and drives it into the covers firmly but cannot find the gap"
"short ball, uses the inward angle to rock back and swivel around with the pull past deep backward square leg"
"between the bowler and mid-off. Angles it in on the boots from around the wicket and Latham crunches a straight drive. Glorious. Did not hit it too hard, just eased into it and caressed it along the carpet"
"seems like Bangladesh have gone for a review for an lbw. And guess what! That has come bang off the middle of the bat. Pad is nowhere in the picture. Bizarre review. Taylor was playing a late cut and he was so late on the shot it could have hit him on the pad. Only that he has played it off the middle of the bat. It was sliding in with the arm and continues with the angle after landing, does not turn and Taylor is cramped for room on the cut shot"
turned away to fine leg and that is the <b>fifty of the partnership</b>
gives it a little flight and pitches it up on middle and leg and it is clipped away to the leg side
backs away to make room for himself and punches it through the region between extra cover and mid-off. There is no one inside the circle and they get a brace. And <b>Latham's</b> purple patch continues with <b>another fifty</b>

"short of a length and pushed across, punched off the backfoot wide of extra cover"
"short ball, does not control the pull shot but the ball bounces in front of the deep midwicket fielder and they charge back for the second even as the bowler gathers the ball. Risky second run but the throw at the striker's end is not the best"

"short and wide, tries to slap it away but does not make contact. Rubel is kind of losing his rhythm here. Bowling all over the place"

"and leaves again. This one's shorter, along that fifth-stump line"
"gone! Short, it's there for the cut, you'd think, but maybe not quite as much width as he'd like. Is forced to hit it with an angled bat rather than a fully horizontal bat, and only manages a top-edge through to Nurul"

left alone outside off
"flighted on the stumps, draws the batsman forward and it dips late but the batsman flicks it to the leg side"

top-edge on the pull or is it? There was definitely a noise. Nigel Llong says not out and Bangladesh have asked for a review. HotSpot does not seem to show anything.

Santner is on the backfoot to a delivery he should have probably been playing forward to. Gets rapped on the back pad as he shifts across and ends up exposing the stumps. Does not spin as much as he anticipates and he does not make contact as he tries to work it through the on side. Ball-tracking is not available and the third umpire asks Paul Reiffel to stay with his on-field call
"back of a length, goes with the angle towards leg stump. Watling goes on the back foot to work it through square leg"
"a touch short outside off, goes back to poke into the cover point region"
"back of a length on middle stump, goes on the back foot for a straight-bat push to midwicket"
"length ball angling across to off stump, gets forward to defend to midwicket"
"fullish, slanting into the fourth-stump channel, left alone"
"back of a length, too close to off stump for the back-foot punch. Ends up inside-edging into his back pad. Came back in a bit"
"length ball, this one moves away just a touch towards off stump. Nicholls plays nice and late with a soft bat, just lets ball hit bat, basically, to ride the ball into the point region"
"length ball on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
tossed up and Nicholls uses his feet to step out and clip with the turn to long-on
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"bowled 'im! Watling goes for the cut but this doesn't turn. There's a bit of width on it but not too much, and his bat comes down at an angle and bottom-edges into the stumps. Shakib hasn't bowled all that much today, but sudden;y he's taken two in two overs"
"goes forward to drive, but Shakib cleverly held that back. Ended up reaching out for it, and it dipped, didn't turn, and it goes off the inside-edge onto pad and bounces down in front of short leg"
chips down the track now and again fails to get to the pitch. Pokes at it and it rolls off the inner half of the bat into the leg side
"three in two overs! Shakib is all over New Zealand here, and again it's that non-turning ball slanted in with that clever low arm. Loose drive from de Grandhomme, looking to hit through the covers, reaching out without getting a proper stride forward, ends up leaving a big gap for the ball to sneak through"
"short of a length, punched off the backfoot to the leg side"
"wide delivery, angle takes it further outside off, left alone"
"short of a length on the fourth-stump channel, Nicholls shuffles across to protect off-stump and stabs it down the pitch"
similar length but closer to off-stump this time and Nicholls again shuffles across before bunting it into the off side
"fuller and shaping away from the fifth-stump channel, Nicholls shoulders arms"
"good length, shaping away, moves across to protect off-stump and lets the ball go"
"pitched up on the stumps, comes forward and pushes into the off side"
stays rooted to the crease and keeps this one out to the off side without feet
"defended down the pitch, playing for the turn but it does not spin as much and he inside-edges it"
"tossed up generously on off, driven off the front foot"
"gets it to drift on leg, flicks it to fine leg. Soumya Sarkar and Nazmul Hasan give it a chase and Sarkar beats him, slides and pulls the ball back to Nazmul but Nazmul slips and ends up kicking the ball back towards the boundary. Comedy of errors"

swing and a miss. Was shaping up to slap it square of the wicket but there is not enough room and it bounces more than he would have liked as well so the ball goes past the upper edge to the wicketkeeper

"full and wide, slanted across, left alone outside off"
"short ball, tries to lean back and duck but it does not get up as much as he expects it to and kind of follows him as well. Pops up to the left of a diving third slip. Seems like he got a bit of glove on it, given as runs"
"full and wide, right in the slot and enough width to open up his arms, drills a drive through cover-point"

shapes up for a cut shot but he was walking across the stumps so does not get as much room as he would have liked and is forced to dab it with soft hands and a half-angled bat to cover
"short of a length outside off, worked off the backfoot through backward point. Call is for two and they run hard even as two fielders get around the ball in the deep. Good running"
"uses his feet to get to the pitch of the ball, takes it on the full and drags it from outside off to mid-on with a closed bat face. Does not time it as well as he would have liked as the bat turns in his hand, but despite all the rain it has copped, the outfield is very quick"
tries to flick it away to the leg side and gets rapped on the pads. Appeal for lbw but the umpire is not interested. Would have gone down leg and it probably pitched outside leg as well

"length ball, down the leg side, tries to flick it but gets it off the thigh pad to backward square leg"
<b>edged and dropped</b>. That's the ninth dropped catch of this match. That's a regulation catch and the fielder spills it. It was back of a length and Wagner was trying to open the bat face. Cannot ride the bounce well as it gets big on him and the ball takes the outside edge and balloons to Nazmul Hossain at gully
"full and outside off, gets beaten on the drive"
"Appeal for lbw, given by umpire Reiffel. And Wagner has reviewed it. It was pitched outside leg and the decision has to be overturned. That was so marginal, just a matter of millimetres. It was a length ball that straightened and Wagner was not looking to flick but the late movement means he is hurried and forced to change his shot"

turned to midwicket from the crease
"short ball, tries to pull but he gets hurried and gets a glove on it towards fine leg"

driven very hard back to the bowler who gathers it but has hurt himself badly. Seems like the finger got jammed between the boot and the ball. That seems quite painful and he is down and being attended to

"sliding in with the arm on leg stump, short of a length, stays back and defends towards the bowler"
"oh, dear, chops this floated up delivery on to the stumps and Nicholls has to walk back two short of a maiden ton. Came charging down the track and tries to drill it through the off side.

""
punched off the backfoot to the bowler
defends of the outer part of the bat to the off side
"flat ball, pushed through quicker at 91.8kph, clipped through square leg. They have gone upstairs for a run out and guess what, this is a bizarre run out. Wagner cannot believe his luck. Wagner was charging back for the second run and he does well to make it into the crease. But he does not ground his bat. Nurul Hasan shows good presence of mind and flicks the ball back to the stumps after collecting it. Does not even look at the stumps as he does so, just throws it back after collecting the throw. And though he has crossed the crease and is well inside it, the feet are in the air at the point when the bails come off and the third umpire gives it out. Wagner is dazed as he walks off but he pays the price for not dragging his bat along the crease"

"short ball outside off, and it's a loose shot for Shakib. <b>200 Test wickets for Tim Southee</b>. It's not that wide also and Shakib steers it, making no attempt to keep it down. Does not find the gap and hits it straight into the hands of de Grandhomme at backward point"

wants nothing to do with the width on offer this time and shoulders arms
"yes, indeed. Short on leg stump and bouncing high. There is not much ducking to do. Could have been a wide"
this one sits up nicely after being banged in and Mahmudullah was ready for it and gets into position before laying into a pull shot and the ball goes into the deep backward square leg fence
not in control of this one at all. Goes for the hook and swivels around and gets a top-edge for his troubles. But there is no one in the fine leg region and the ball crosses the boundary after a couple of bounces
"bouncer, too high and again Mahmudullah barely has to duck"
"superb line and length. Short of good length, Mahmudullah shuffles across and lets it go and the ball goes from periliously close to off-stump. Ended up being a good leave though as Mahmudullah trusted the bounce and angle on that one"
presses forward to this good length ball and defends into the off side
"length ball, shaping away, left alone"
blocked to short cover off the front foot as he leans forward
comes down a step or two and the bowler adjusts as he fires it wide outside off and the batsman does not go after it in the end
moving away off the seam from the good length region and it is defended
"length ball, jabs it to the left of the bowler who moves across on the follow-through"
comes down a step and uses the width to steer this one through point to finally get off the mark. Took its time coming - 20 balls
"short ball, just outside off, arches back and drops his wrists to let it go"
"short of a length, angling in, waits for it before turning it away to forward short leg"
"short of a length, jumps up to ride the bounce before dropping it in front of short leg"
"short ball, makes a late decision to leave it and lifts the bat up. But the ball hits something before going into the hands of Latham at short leg but that one has gone off the chest"
flicked away from outside off to backward square leg
"short ball, does not get hold of the pull shot. Not short enough and he does not time it too well as the ball goes away to the left of the bowler"
"beaten outside off. Walks across a step before pressing forward to this length ball, Moves away off the seam and the ball beats the bat on its way to the keeper"
"good length outside off, comes forward and defends"
walks down a step but the bowler takes it further away from him by firing it full and wide

"back of a length and angling away outside off, left alone"
tries to flick it to the leg side and makes no contact as he sprays it down the leg side
pushes at it without conviction. Is stuck back to a fuller ball and gets beaten

comes forward and blocks into the off side
"short ball, banged in, gets the front leg out of the way before pulling it away to deep backward square leg"
"full and angled away in the corridor of uncertainty, left alone"
"good length ball on the stumps, moving across from over the wicket to the left-hander and it is defended"
beatne outside off. It's full and the angle takes it away outside off. Hossain sticks his bat out and gets beaten
left alone outside off
"comes down the track and goes for an ill-advised swipe across the line, trying to go big over the leg side. Can't get anywhere near the ball. Really don't understand why he would attempt that kind of a shot"
shuffles across to protect off-stump before defending down the pitch
comes charging down and the bowler takes it full and wide outside off. Can't make any contact as he is forced to reach out for it as the bowler fires it wide outside off
slanted across on a length and Mahmudullah waits for it at the crease before cutting it square of the wicket. Timed and placed to perfection
ill-advised attempt at a drive away from the body. It's swinging away late and there was no need to go after it. Gets promptly beaten for his troubles
"this had to happen at some point. Goes for another drive away from the body. It moves away late from a fullish length and does not come on to him too well either. Mahmudullah is forced to reach out for it and he tries to force it, ends up dragging it on to the stumps. Angrily swipes at the stumps as he sees the bails getting dislodged but the damage has been done. Bangladesh in serious trouble here. They are effectively 27 for 4"
"lovely delivery, swinging away from that tempting line in the fourth-stump channel again. Again it's a wild attempt at a drive at a delivey that is probably best left alone and he gets beaten"
"no movement this time, holding its line on the fourth-stump channel and it is crunched off the front foot to mid-off"
"short ball, manages to keep it out to the off side but not in the most convincing fashion. Takes the eyes off the ball and it grazes the glove"
worked into the off side
"full ball, comes forward and pushes it towards mid-off"
"slanting across around a set of stumps outside off, the batsman is walking down again and he bowler takes it away from him, left alone"
"fullish length, driven firmly off the front foot but straight to the bowler"
driven to mid-off
comes down the track and chips this one in the air and over mid-on. But he did not look assured playing that shot at all. Gets it well past the fielder inside the circle but that is not a pretty shot
tries to force a cut off the backfoot but is severely cramped for room. Gets a thick inside edge and it misses the stumps but not by much
"full, wide, way, way outside off, gets beaten as he chases it with absolutely no feet looking to drive"
"length ball, tries to carve it through the off side, bat comes out of the hand and comes back down to rap him on the head as the ball goes to cover"
"good length and on the stumps, walks across and pushes it to the left of the bowler who runs across and fields it"
rides the bounce on this short of a length ball by shuffling across and jumping up before dropping it into the off side
"short ball, ducked under easily"
"fuller ball on off, driven to the right of the bowler and de Grandhomme gets a hand to it before deflecting it to mid-off"
"length ball, pushed across, left alone"
fired wide outside off and it is not bothered with
"very full ball on the stumps, jams the bat down and jabs it to the left of the bowler"
over mid-off but only just. This one is pitched up outside off and he tempts the batsman to go for the drive. He makes no effort to keep it along the ground as he chips it over the outstretched hands of the fielder
left alone outside off
"fullish ball, slanted across on the fifth-stump channel, moves across to cover for any late movement before crunching it to covers"
"<b>edged and the keeper snaffles it</b>. Wagner snuffs him out with a well-directed short ball. bangs it in on middle-stump line and the ball gets big on the batsman. He jumps up, awkwardly looking to ride the bounce. Does not manage to keep it down as he tries to fend it off. Gets a healthy outside edge that is taken by the wicketkeeper"
comes half forward to this short of a length ball and stabs it to covers
Wagner strikes second ball after the break. Strangles him down the leg side with a short ball and Nurul initially thinks of flicking it but changes his mind late and tries to keep the bat inside the line. But it's too late and he gets just a feather as the ball goes to the wicketkeeper. Appeal for caught behind and Nigel Llong needs little time to raise his finger
"fullish length ball, slanting across the right-hander and holding its line on the fifth-stump channel, left alone outside off"
"bouncer, banged in on leg stump channel, Mehedi ducks to bring an end to a double-wicket maiden"
fires one wide outside off at 131.9 kph and it is left alone

"bouncer on the stumps, Hossain ducks under it"
"yorker on the stumps, Hossain jams the bat down in the nick of time and digs it out"
"good length ball at 135 clicks and holding its line outside off, comes forward and pushes it into the covers. Packed field there, so no run"
"<b>edged and dropped</b> Another drive away from the body and it is Jeet Raval again at second slip. Have long lost count of the number of dropped catches in this match. Bangladesh just don't seem to be learning. Another wide ball and Mehedi chases it, reaching out a long way, gets a healthy edge that goes straight to the fielder and he makes a mess of a straightforward chance"
"full and tailing away, left alone"
"full and wide, another wide drive, gets an outside edge and this time it goes away between gully and point to the square third man fence"
"short ball, ducked under"
shifts back and across to this length ball on middle and leg and dabs it into the leg side
short ball that stands up and Mehedi tries to block and does not make contact
thinks of going after it and pokes his bat outside off and withdraws it late. Gets big on him as well as it kicks up from the length region
wide outside off and not bothered with this time
"short of a length and some width on offer, punched gloriously off the backfoot square of the wicket, through cover-point"
that's a brilliant yorker from Boult. And he gets reverse swing as well. Nazmul jams the bat down but cannot make contact with the ball as it tails back in late and takes out off and middle stumps. Not much that you can do there. A wicket off a good ball for a change
bowls it very full but messes up the line and fires it down the leg side
"fullish and tailing in, defended into the off side"
flashes at this short and wide ball outside off and does not make contact
"short of a length, outside off, cannot make up his mind if he wants to go after it or leave it and tentatively pokes before withdrawing his bat as the ball goes to the keeper"
jumps up to ride the bounce and gets on top of the bounce before solidly defending into the off side
"fuller ball on off, driven to covers"
"short of good length and slanted across, sticks his bat out and gets opened up slightly as the ball goes to the wicketkeeper after beating the outside edge"
"length ball outside off, late away movement after the batsman shoulders arms"

"short of a length ball, stands tall and defends"
"now he sprays it full and the ball is driven towards mid-on, not great timing and they will only get a single"

comes on to the front foot and blocks this into covers
"tempter, full and swinging away on the fourth-stump channel, left alone"
"fuller ball, angling in on middle and it is pushed gently down the ground, past mid-on for a brace"
"short of a length on the stumps, gets up to ride the bounce before tucking it off the pads behind square on the leg side"
"good length, shaping away, defended off the front foot to point"
"short of a length outside off, does well after getting on top of it to keep it down as he stabs it into the off side"
"fullish and moving away late from just around off, susses out the movement and shoulders arms"
"short ball on leg stump and not really threatening the batsman from that line. Besides, the bounce is steep and he ducks under"
"good length just outside off, gets on top of the bounce before jabbing it towards the point region"
"short ball, banged in and angling in and it is ducked under"
"fuller and angling in, lifts it over mid-on. The ball goes well wide of him and goes all the way to the boundary"
"yorker on the stumps, brings the bat down and digs it out"
short ball does the trick again. Good variation in length from Boult. Cleverly follows up the yorker with a short ball and Mehedi gets a glove as he tries to keep it down. Only that he can't keep it down and sends it straight into the hands of short leg who is waiting with his hands out. That's catching practice
"back of a length, tailing away from leg and middle and it is defended off the front foot into the off side"
"length ball, picks it up from outside off, enough width to free his arms and he lofts it over deep midwicket. Not the prettiest of strokes but it's six and Bangladesh will take anything that comes their way at this point"
goes for another slog but this time the connection isn't quite there. Does not get hold of it and gets it just past Williamson at mid-on. He runs back to field it and they scamper back for the second.
goes for a slog again but this time he can only flat-bat it to mid-on
"short of good length, wide outside off and not bothered with"
"short ball, banged in on leg and ducked under"
"chases a wide delivery and looks to drive it. Not much feet and he was not trying to get close to it, so he gets beaten"
"short ball, hits him on the back of a head. That's a scary blow. Goes through with the pull shot early and it hits him flush on the back of the helmet even as the back protection comes out"
runs it to backward point. Taskin's bat almost got stuck in the turf and it would have been a repeat of the Wagner run out had there been a direct throw. But there is no direct hit and he has managed to drag his bat through as well
"short of a length outside off, stabs it into the off side"
"Taskin has asked for a review for a caught decision. It was a short ball and Taskin was looking to pull. Seemed like he got a leading edge to point and umpire Reiffel gives it out. Watching the replays, it initially seems as though there was no bat or glove and the ball has in fact gone off the shoulder to helmet grill, near the ear and gone to the fielder at backward point. But snicko shows a slight disturbance as the ball passes the back of the bat. The TV umpire has a long hard look at it and the disturbance is very mild. And there is nothing conclusive to suggest that there was a definite edge. The decision is overturned. There were two noises but it was shoulder and helmet"
"bouncer, tries to pull and misses"
""
"fuller ball, comes forward and opens the face of his bat to carve it square of the wicket"
"short ball, banged in and Taskin looks for the pull but he skews it off the top edge after being cramped for room and the ball balloons over behind the stumps. BJ Watling runs back while Ross Taylor runs in from third man. Neither man ends up taking it. But that was probably more Taylor's catch"
"short ball outside off, swings and does not make contact"
"short of a length, sits up nicely outside off and it is pulled nicely off the backfoot through deep midwicket"
left alone in the channel outside off
"short ball, comes on at a nice height outside off again and Rabbi rocks on to the backfoot before laying into a pull shot as the ball screams past the deep midwicket boundary"
"shorter ball outside off, rides the bounce well before opening the face of his bat to steer it wide of gully"
"full, swinging away from outside off, Kamrul picks up the movement well and leaves it alone after getting the front foot across to cover off-stump"
"short ball, angling away but well-directed, forces the batsman to hurriedly arch back and let it go"
wild swing and the ball goes a couple of bounces and into the third man boundary. Tries to pick this length ball from outside off as he tries to shovel it over the leg side with a half-angled bat. But it does not quite et up and he gets a top edge that goes over the keeper and the fielders running back
looks to slog and gets hit on the pad but it pitched outside leg
"short and angling away, arches back and lets it go"
"short of a length, from around the stumps, stays leg side of the ball before deftly manoeuvring it with an open bat face wide of fine gully and backward point"
"short ball, arches back and sways out of the line"
"short of a length, jumps back to ride the bounce and fends it off"

stays on the backfoot an bunts this to the right of the bowler
"short of a length, banged in on the body, blocked"
"backs away and tries to pull it, ends up swinging wildly and misses as the ball gets big on him and bounces sharply"
backs away to this short ball and steers it to gully. They think of a run but decide against it. Direct throw at the keeper's end but the batsman has made it back and the ball deflects away from the stumps and they take the overthrow
"short of a length and down the leg side, lifts his bat up and lets it go"
makes good connection on the slog and that one sails over the deep midwicket boundary. It was a slower length ball and he had all the time in the world to get in position and pummel that
"yorker outside off, squeezed out into the off side"
"bouncer on the stumps to end the over, ducked under"
backs away and flays this short ball over the mid-off region. Flat-batted heave and the ball does not carry all the way to the boundary as there is some under-spin on it and it is fielded in front of the long-off boundary
backs away and looks to pull and gets it off the toe end making ti like a half slice as the ball goes through backward point
"short ball, swivels around and pull to deep square leg and the ball soars over the boundary and into the grassbanks"
"looks to back away and it was a length ball outside off, slapped towards mid-off"
"short of a length and on the stumps, drops it into the off side, to the covers region, off the backfoot"
"short ball, tries to pull but gets rushed by the pace and it hits him on the flush on the chest before hitting him on the helmet and the ball goes into the leg side"
"good length, keeps it out into the leg side, in front of short leg"
"short ball, brings out the pull, gets it off the top part of the bat and the ball goes to deep backward square leg on the bounce"
"very full and tails in on the pads from outside off, tries to flick and misses, wears it on the pad. Heading down leg"
"short of a length, pulls it off the backfoot to deep midwicket. Absolutely pummels it"
and the yorker does the trick. Goes through the defence. Gets it to tail in which means the ball beats the inside edge and crashes into the stumps. Ends a frustrating stand but how many valuable runs have these two added? That partnership was 51 and the lead is now 101. Another 50-60 for the last wicket could make this game interesting again
backs away a long way to give himself room and it's a wide yorker. Jams the bat down and squeezes it out to third man
backs away to make room but the bowler follows him with a length ball and Rubel is forced to stick out a straight bat and the ball beats the outside edge on its way to the wicketkeeper
stays leg side of the ball and swings wildly as he looks to force it across the line and gets beaten
backs away and Southee follows him with a yorker on leg stump. Rubel pushes it gently down past mid-on and they get back for a brace. Good late adjustment
"slower full ball on leg stump, picks it up late and waits for it to come on before shovelling it through wide mid-on. That was just 104kph"
brilliant catch from BJ Watling. He was backtracking and judges it to perfection as the ball stays in the air and goes back some distance after Rubel gets a top-edge on the pull shot

"full and slanting away outside off, left alone"

full and holding its line outside off and it is left alone

"yes, it will. This one is lofted clean over long-on. The move to send de Grandhomme up the order has worked as New Zealand have comfortably won on the fourth day. Seals the game with back-to-back sixes"
