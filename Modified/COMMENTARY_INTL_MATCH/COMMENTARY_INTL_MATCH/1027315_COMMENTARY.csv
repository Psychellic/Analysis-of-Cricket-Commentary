"Holder glides in, hits a 'heavy' length, rising over the top of off stump, Roy shows it a straight bat in defence"
"some decent carry here for Holder, slightly back of a length in the channel and left alone this time"
"short and wide, not the most demanding delivery... but Roy is happy to let a few through at this stage"
"attacks the stumps, fuller length and homing in on the front pad, Roy clips it neatly down to fine leg for the first run of the day"
"pitched up, hung out in the channel, trying to tempt Billings, who leans out and shoulders arms"
"slightly full, comes forward and dabs it defensively into the off side to end a tidy first over"
"shout for lbw first up, Gabriel is on the money and raps Roy on the knee roll, it squirts towards gully as Ruchira Palliyaguruge shakes his head. Maybe a touch high?"
"ooh, that's a jaffa, too, on a length outside off and it jacknifes away from Billings' loose waft"
"fired in full, thuds the pads once again, another exuberant appeal from Gabriel - but that one was heading down leg"
"pitched up around off stump and Roy doesn't bother to move his feet much, slaps the ball back at the bowler, Gabriel takes it on the shin and there's no run"
"beats the outside edge again! Gabriel gets just a hint of seam movement away from Roy, wasn't quite full enough to drive as he swings unsuccessfully"
"straighter line, back of a length, Roy closes the face and nudges a couple through square leg. Certainly looks as if the batsmen won't have it all their own way to start with in Antigua"
"short and slightly leg side as Billings comes walking down, doesn't get anything on it"
"shortish, around off stump, Billing plays it softly down into the covers and they pinch one"
"dug in short, Roy whips his bottom-hand through this, a real conductor's whip and it beats midwicket to run away for the first boundary of the innings"
"pitched up, Roy moves across again and clips this firmly in front of the man in the deep, lovely timing and that will be four more"
"hangs it out on a length, fifth-sixth stump, steered through gully for one"
"length around off stump, 132kph/81mph and Billings taps it defensively into the off side"
"seam and late swing for Gabriel, 135kph/83mph and Roy dabs at it off the back foot, watches the ball zip through past the edge"
"good length in the channel, Roy again aims a buccaneering blow down the ground... and is beaten!"
"done him again, that's the best of the lot! Full and straightening a fraction outside off, does Roy like the proverbial kipper. Gabriel's the avenging angel this morning"
"shortish, good pace, turned through backward point off the back foot"
"dug in, this clocks 147kph/91mph and Billings rides the bounce from the crease in defence"
"another whizzes through to Hope behind the stumps, Billings tries to hit on the up this time, a booming drive beaten on the inside"
"back of a length outside off, Roy attempts to pull but it stays a fraction low"
"short ball, this time he connects but doesn't time the pull and it dribbles towards midwicket"
"back of a length, around 130kph/80mph from Holder, defended"
"length ball around the line of off, Roy is a little more circumspect in tapping towards cover"
"135kph over off stumps, another watchful block on the back foot"
"<b>dropped!</b> First clear chance of the day and it goes to the captain, who is unable to hold on as Roy pops the ball back at him, through his shot early and it looked a takeable chance to Holder's - but he couldn't grab it"
"pitched up and Billings blocks it firmly back down the ground, a decent connection at last and it outruns the chasing fielders, despite two valiant diving attempts out towards the rope"
"shortish and pinged through point this time, nicely played with an open face, this time the man does get there to flick it back in front of the boundary"
"gone, pinned in front! Gabriel strikes, the ball stayed low and Roy looks a bit miffed... but that's a straightforward decision for the umpire to make, would have clattered into middle and off. Reward for the dangerous Gabriel"
"length ball, Root works it off his front pad into the leg side and is up and running"
"good pace, arrowing in on middle stump, Billing shows it a straight bat in defence"

"short of a length, Root goes back and across to defend"
"in the channel, slightly back of a length, lets this one fly through"
"pitched up and that's some Test-match timing from Root, flicked adroitly off his pads out towards deep midwicket for three"
"length ball in the channel, 134kph/82mph and Billings defends on the move down towards his toes"
"short of a length, Billings is on the walk again, tapped down behind square but there's no room for a cheeky single"
"short again, Billings drops this even closer to the cut strip and Root calls him through for one as backward point hares across in vain"
"wide of the stumps, 146kph and keeps low as Billings jabs it through point for one"
"bowled him, stumps akimbo! Gabriel goes straight through Root, maybe low bounce again but that was quick, it hit the seam and hurtled back to kersplat the stumps with Root stuck in the crease... That's a big blow, England rocking, Gabriel rolling"
"short of a length, angled across the left-hander, who draws his bat inside the line"
"puts this on a length, around off stump, Morgan blocks coming forwards"
"short of a length, Gabriel packing heat still, beats the bat on the inside"

"tighter to the stumps, this time Morgan defends"
"short of a length, dabbed down into the leg side"
"back of a length outisde off, defended towards point"
"short ball from Gabriel and that is clubbed for four! A bold show of power from Billings, shuffled across and then gave it maximum welly, sending the ball flying away through square leg"
"pitched up outside off, gets on the front foot this time and drills the ball towards mid-off"
full length and again Billings tucks into the front-foot drive but sends it to Holder at mid-off
"fullish and thumped even more sweetly, Holder has to dive to his left but does well and Morgan didn't fancy trying to steal one"
"good length, stays a touch low and Billings loses his footing as he works to midwicket"
"<b>dropped at first slip!</b> Morgan gets a life... Brathwaite's first ball was a full tempter, Morgan had a slash at it, got a thick edge and it flew to the left of Hope, who dived across slip - Kieran Powell, I think - but it should have been taken. Went in and then out"
"pitched up, tapped back defensively"
skips down the pitch and swings and misses this time
""
angled across and this flies through to the keeper

"full and flighted, uses the feet and nurdles one through the leg side"
"stays over the wicket to Morgan, who drops back to block on off stump"
"gets down early and attempts to lap a length ball from Nurse, hit on the pad and they ask the question... Palliyaguruge shakes his head, probably skidding on past off stump"
"goes for the lap sweep again, this time he manages to dink it wide of the keeper for a couple as slip gives chase"
"pushed through flat outside off, Morgan swats it towards point"
"Brathwaite puts the ball on a length around off stump, Billings defends"

"and again, this time a more powerful connection, reverse-swiping through backward point for back-to-back fours"
tossed up and worked in more orthodox fashion through midwicket for one more to finish a good over for England
"shortish, tapped down off the splice and Carter misfields twice at backward point as they hustle through for one"
slanted across outside off stump and steered towards point
"short, slightly too close to cut and Morgan is tucked up, dabbed straight to backward point"
"short and wide, Morgan connects well but again picks out the man"
stays back and forces the ball in front of square this time for one to the sweeper
"Billings starts to move down the pitch, Brathwaite takes a little pace off and he can only work it off his hip to the square leg fielder"

"another slapped pull-sweep, much straighter this time, and finds its way down to long on"
"round the wicket, that's a better length, long stride to defend"

forward and defended back to the bowler
"faster and flatter, dabbed into the off side"
defended
"outside off, and battered hard and with a distinct lack of decorum straight back past the bowler. Was it a slower ball? Either way, Billings just bullied it through the line"
"outside off, poked into the point region"
"too short, and that's a swivel-pull into space on the leg side. Doesn't make perfect contact, but up comes the fifty stand"

"attempted reverse wallop, but doesn't make contact"

"attempted wipe over the covers, comes off a leading edge and plops just short of backward point. Decent introduction"
banged in short and hauled through the leg side

"outside off, beats a tentative poke"
an open-stanced slap to long-off
"on the hip, worked to square leg"

"on the pads, tucked delicately to the leg side and excellent running as the sweeper hurtles in"
"on the pads again, another measured clip"

tries to work one to leg but can't connect properly
"pounded on the up through the leg side again, but this time long-on is in situ. Still, 10 off the over in these conditions is healthy"

"short and too short. Stokes declines to have a go, and the umpire sympathises"

tossed up and pushed back down the track
"some turn and bounce and that results in a <b>missed stumping!</b> Morgan was well out of his ground, having skipped down the pitch... In fact, looks like he got a thin top edge on it, so that's a <b>drop</b> from Hope, instead. Either way, a life for Morgan"

"short again, Stokes slugs to the leg side, with the wind... will it carry? Kraigg Brathwaite is underneath it at deep midwicket... but he drops the catch as he stepped back over the rope, the ball then hit him on the knee with his foot grounded... so that will be six more!"

"full and wide, Morgan cloths one more down the ground"
"Gabriel finishes with a full toss that Stokes manages to awkwardly splice back over the bowler's head for one more - and that's a no-ball on height, too"

"full and wide and chipped over the off side, wide of long-off for a couple"
"pitched up and Moeen lofts a couple more without timing, over extra cover running back, and that's the end of that - England just shy of 300 but with a handy total in their pocket"
"a promising full length from Finn, targeting the base of middle, and clipped to square leg"
"outside off, just the wrong side of the tramlines"

"that's a woeful waft, and Windies are three-down! Back of a length, Brathwaite sized up the pull but never committed to the stroke. A toe-ended gimme to Rashid, who gathers with a tumble at mid-on. Now they are in the mire"
forward and defended into the covers

"drawn forward once more, no way through there"

"driven inside out, through the leg side as a bit of extra lift foxes the intended stroke"
through to the keeper with a loose waft

nurdled into the leg side
tapped into the off side
flicked to leg
"hauled through the leg side, Plunkett's unsettling bounce disrupting West Indies' attacking intentions"
"firmly punched to cover. Solid connection, and a threat of overthrows but the batsmen had followed through too far"

forward and pushed into the covers
clipped into the leg side
"settling for the singles, this time to deep midwicket"
forward and pushed to cover

"flat on the stumps, goes back to clip into the leg side for one more"
"length ball on the stumps, tapped to the leg side"
fizzed down but too straight and Mohammed just has to get a tickle of bat on it and the ball races fine

dragged down a touch short and pulled back past the bowler off the back foot
tossed up on the stumps and worked behind square on the leg side
"lands the offbreak and it straightens a touch, thudding into the front pad... Moeen goes up in appeal but umpire Palliyaguruge shakes his head. After a moment's consultation, England decide to <b>review</b>. This is an easy one for Chris Gaffaney, spinning too much despite pitching in line: would have missed leg stump, according to Hawk-Eye"
"gives this some air, drifting across outside off, lashed on the drive but Morgan dives to cut it off at cover"
"pushed through and cut off the back foot, beats Woakes' rather lame dive at backward point and skips away for four"
"Moeen drags this down and Mohammed rocks back to slam it over the leg side, in the air and into the breeze but he gets it in front of deep square leg and it bounces away - consecutive fours, a tonic for the Windies"
shuffles across and steers the ball into the untended acres at deep extra cover for a couple more
"tossed up outside off, mistimed into the covers"
"flighted, in the channel, again Hope doesn't get hold of his drive"
"short and wide, ugly slash, top edge... and Hope's gone! Finn utilised all of his 6ft 6ins, diving forward at backward point to scoop up a catch and break an encouraging stand. Not a great shot from Hope, the ball was there to be hit but he rather butchered it, straight off the top edge. Maybe didn't pick the googly"

"too full from Moeen, in the slot and Mohammed cashes that with a meaty slug over cover into an untended part of the field"

"flighted, Carter closes the face and pops a leading edge into the on side"
"tossed up, gets on to the front foot and cracks a drive back at the bowler... Root juggles a catch at the second attempt. Is that out? Root sort of half-appeals and the umpires go up to check it if was a bump ball; replays show it clearly was, so on we go"
"dollied up on off stump, crunched in front of extra cover and long-off has to jog around to keep them to two"
"hello, is that <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU5trjpFus0 target=new>the Manics</a> I can hear? Carter dances out and <i>absolutely belts</i> Root several miles back over long-on for the first six of the innings!"

"short of a length around off stump, chopped down into the off side"
"dug in short... and he's bazooka-ed this into the carpark! Murderous connection from Carter, rocking back to pull and he has middled it several times over. It's gone, they're going to need a replacement ball! EVERYTHING MUST GO!!!"
"length outside off, chopped of the back foot toward point"

"on the pads, and deflected out to the leg side"
"strikes the pad, but too high to be of interest as the batsman hops across his crease"
round the wicket and down the leg side. They all help
"that is a stunning catch! Carter takes on the pull again, the ball gets caught in the wind, which both prevents it from reaching the boundary, but also from reaching the tumbling Jason Roy at deep square leg. Except... he flings himself headlong and scoops it millimetres from the turf!"
tight line
"whipped into the leg side, gathered at short midwicket"
"outside off, crashed on the up through the covers. Mohammed hasn't given this up yet"
"hoisted into the leg side, a good stop on the fine leg boundary, and nearly a mix-up as Holder refuses the second. He was rather put off by the quality of the stop as Rashid did well there"

worked into the gap
"down the leg side again, up comes the 200"

"on the back foot, tapped to short third man"
dabbed defence
"on the back foot, tapped to short cover for a quick single"
settling for singles
"on the back foot, and that is some nifty footwork from the galumphing Finn! Tapped down into the crease, Brathwaite looks round to see where's it's gone and is called through, and it's a race between the big men... Finn wins it with a side-foot into the bottom right corner, and Mohammed is an inch short! Finn wheels away and gives it the full Alan Shearer, one arm in the air. That's bought him early selection for Sunday's footie warm-up"
chiselled into the leg side for another single
"solidly forward, and pushed to cover"
attempted thrash through the off side
winding it up but can't beat the field
"forward, and defended"
"back of a length, hoisted out to the leg side"

"up on the toes, tapped to third man to take the single"
"very full length, attempted yorker, and good enough for this situation. Dug out to mid-off"
another single as Finn keeps his line nice and tight
"on the back foot, wafted down to long on"
"punched into the covers, and Finn recovers well to limit the damage after a boundary first ball"
"swivel-pull, again not fully nailed, but another single to the cause"
"striding onto the front foot, and wafted to the leg side"
"slower ball, massive wind-up, a spiralling outside edge, Root calls early on the edge of the circle and pouches what could be the killer catch!"
"another slower ball, and there's no mercy for this one! Down on one knee, and utterly battered through cow corner"
"big wind-up, high in the air, who wants it, Moeen calls, and it plugs safe, just behind the bowler! Woakes himself was probably closest, but he would have had to pivot in his followthrough to get there"
"round the wicket, targeting the stumps, pushed to mid-on"
"width outside off, and jabbed down to third man"
"an inside-out lofted drive down to third man, bounces just short of the man as they cross for a single"
"full length, and punched into the covers"
"banged in short, hoisted out to deep midwicket"
"banged over cow corner, clearing the front foot and letting the bat do the rest"
"another mown boundary through the leg side, it's still improbable, but those two balls meant the runs briefly flowed at twice the required rate ..."
"outside off, hauled into the leg side as Woakes goes too wide to allow a conventional drive"
"high and mighty! Seized on the width this time, and capitalised on a fractionally fuller length. Throws his hands through the line and that is clean into the stands at long-off!"
"great riposte! Wider on the crease, a much fuller length, and pinned plumb in front! A long pause for thought from the umpire, and rightly, West Indies use the <B>review</B>, but hard to see how he'll be saved here... the angle was a touch deceptive, to be fair, but it is clipping leg, and off he goes"
tight line to welcome the new batsman
"low full toss,  but can't cash in"
"lovely slower ball! Beaten all ends up, as it hops past the edge, stumps, and dribbles to the keeper. The full-blown back-of-the-hander"
"full length, outside off, pushed to third man"
"short, pulled, lobs to the keeper, and that's the end of that! No reviews left, so Gabriel has no second opinion, so it is England who draw first blood in this best-of-three rubber!"
