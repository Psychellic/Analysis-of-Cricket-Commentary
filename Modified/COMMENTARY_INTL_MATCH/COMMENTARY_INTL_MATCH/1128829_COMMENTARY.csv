Impact is in front of middle stump, but the ball slides across. <b>Would've missed leg stump.</b> Islamabad lose the review inside the first three balls"
"<b>strikes this time! But Akmal reviews.</b> Full on middle stump, and Akmal misses the straight drive. Hits his back pad, and this time the lbw appeal is given. Hit him in front of middle stump but was there any inside edge? We wait for the replays. It may be sliding down leg once again as well. Yes, it's crashing into leg stump. Akmal has to go, but Lahore get their review back"
