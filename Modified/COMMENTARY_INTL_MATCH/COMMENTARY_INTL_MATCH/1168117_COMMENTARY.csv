"pulled to long-on's right. Short ball at middle stump, cramped on the shot but manages to drag it with the bounce"
"<b>finds fine leg.</b> Short ball angled into the hips, there for some punishment, but Asghar's initial movement down leg side means he's cramped on the ramp. Finds KOB there. A superb innings nonetheless. This innings was in danger of ending a lot earlier if it wasn't for the captain"

<b>clears long-on!</b> A short-arm punch and he holds the pose. More full toss action from Murtagh and he lines up to club across the angle this time
"low full toss outside off, sliced to deep extra cover"
slower short ball at off stump. Nails the connection on this pull but finds deep square
"overpitched outside off, dug out to deep extra"
<b>leading edge</b> lands safely to fine leg's left. Short ball and he's wafting with no control under it. No shape either. Comes back for the second

"slower yorker, it appears. At a leg stump line. Can't get under it. It gets under his bat, in fact. And bounces over leg stump"
mistimed pull lands safely in front of deep square. Slower bouncer this time and he gets no timing on this
"low full toss outside off, slaps it off the toe-end to long-off"
<b>taken by sweeper cover</b> running in from the boundary. Seems like yet another slower ball. It's overpitched at a middle stump line and he wants to pump it into the leg side. But he's through it early and is forced to open the face in the end. Simi takes a good running catch
<b>over long-off!</b> Knee high full toss and he uses quick wrists to whip at this. Lots of width too. Easy hitting
short of a length and angled in at off stump. Looks to run it down to third man and is beaten
"length on off stump, defended towards point to get Najib back on strike"
"<b>dropped!</b> And a run-out chance missed! Is that the sign he's destined for this hundred?! Terrible from Ireland. Short of a length ball at off stump, looks to pull it and gets a top edge that lobs up for McBrine at point. He is nowhere near being underneath that by the end. Lunging to his left as he drops it and then throwing at the striker's end. Where there's no one to receive the throw."
<b>good bouncer</b> and he's not happy it's been called wide. Got steep on the batsman as he evaded it from a middle stump line

"yorker at off stump, jammed out into the covers"

<b>inside edge</b> onto pad and trickling behind square as Simi is late on the forward defence. This was angled in at off stump on a length
"oh lovely shot, but extra cover sticks out a hand and keeps it to one. Short of a length and he was right behind the line to punch this with a high elbow. A dive to the left from the fielder to take pace off it"
"<b>given!</b> Simi is late on the ball yet again. Late enough to not even get an inside edge this time. It's a close call because he's stuck in front of leg stump on the knee roll, but that could be hitting the top of leg. Dawlat getting another one to skid in from a length"

"short of a length and in at off stump, runs the defence into his foot. They steal a single pitch side"
"<b>past extra cover</b> and past sweeper cover! Low full toss just outside off, backs away and drives into the gap. Zazai with the most laboured sprint at this. His despair is a picture of Afghanistan's despair. Run and run and run, but can't catch Balbirnie at the moment"
"<b>finds cover point!</b> That was an exquisite square drive but he couldn't pierce the infield on the off side, with all fielders in the circle"
<b>he's done it!</b> Balbirnie backs away and slices this full ball over short third to clinch the most unlikely of wins for Ireland. What an absolute monster of a knock.
