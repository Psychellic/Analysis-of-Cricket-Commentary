"drifting down leg stump, flicks it to short fine leg and runs a quick single"
drives down to long on by Sarfaraz - hello! - I had forgotten he was opening!
<strong>and that's the first four</strong>. Banton dances down and deposits the Kings' skipper to cow corner. Was in the slot and sat up for him
"<strong>and it's an early night for Tom Banton</strong>! Tried to loft him over square leg, it flies up into the air instead. Joe Clarke didn't have to move as it came right back down into his gloves, and Banton's struggles in the PSL continue"
"check out the timing on that from Chris Gayle! Just leaned into a drive that pierced the gap in the extra cover region, and gets off the mark with a boundary"
and he leaves that alone. Who'd have thought? Eventful little over to get us underway
brings the ball in sharply to his former Pakistan captain. Sarfaraz defends solidly
nicely timed into the onside from Sarfaraz for a single
"a bit of width outside off stump, tempting Gayle, who leaves it alone"
opens the face of the bat and guides it to third man
"tucked away to the onside. Tidy start from Amir, this"
"driven to mid-off, excellent over from Amir"
Sarfaraz leans into a lovely off drive. Bit too much width and all Sarfaraz had to do was time it through the vacant cover-point region. Easy pickings
took the pace off that ball. Didn't get any timing on that one
"crisp drive through the offside but finds the fielder. That was in the slot to put away, he'll feel"
"and Sarfaraz falls. Tried to open the face of the bat and run it down behind the wicket. Gets a faint tickle on it instead, and that's a soft dismissal for Quetta. Karachi have started brightly"
"pushes him on the back foot, and Saim Ayub defends. Excellent comeback from Yamin after that loosener first up"
dragged down the legside
defended. Five off the over and the wicket of the Quetta captain
"square Gayle up and a thick edge, second slip would have gobbled that up! As it is, it races past first slip and beats third man, who was fairly square, on the boundary"
"raps him on the pads, and Gayle shows a level of sprightliness you don't associate with him, and gets Ayub on strike"
"angling back into him, thick inside edge onto the pad"
opens the face and runs it down to third man
"Amir continues to target the stumps, not many scoring opportunities on offer here. Gayle drives it to mid-off"
tickles it away to the onside for a single.
"thick inside edge from Gayle, who went for an expansive drive. Doesn't quite get to the fence, but Gayle comes back for a couple"
"tucked him up nicely, Gayle drives it back to the bowler"
"And Gayle really unleashes for the first time. Clears the front leg and absolutely biffs the bowler over mid-off. Not quite off the middle, but it's gone for a boundary on the bounce."
"<strong>what an exquisite shot that is</strong>. Showcasing both timing and power. Was a full delivery, and Gayle just flicked it over mid-on, and it absolutely sails over the boundary. That's the first six of the PSL, and you'd be hard pressed to find a more sweetly timed one."
<strong>six more! SIX MORE</strong>! Gayle is beginning to unleash. Classic Gayle shot. Languid clearing of the front leg and just swings through the line. Long-on can only watch as it sails over his head
"slower ball, driven back to the bowler. 18 off that one, and Quetta are away"
cleverly flicks it to fine leg and gives Gayle the strike. Intelligent cricket from the teenager
"slower ball, swiped away by Gayle but no timing on it. Just the single to square leg"
"pace off, just 111 kph, that. Cut to the in-fielder on the offside"
"this time Ayub lay in wait for the slower one, and finds the gap in the cover region. Gave him a bit of width and Ayub slashes it away"
"flicked to fine leg, this time Gayle decided against taking a swift run"
"slightly short, pulled by Ayub without finding the timing. And that's the end of the Powerplay"
kept a little low. Gayle swung and missed at it. Looks at the pitch accusingly. Arshad Iqbal got away with it
rolls his wrists and gets Ayub back on strike
"looked like it came back in to Ayub, nearly dragged it onto the stumps."
once more he pushes him on the back foot. Sliced to short third. Ayub might want to get a move on now.
"expansive drive from Ayub that got a thick outside edge on it. Gets off strike, but just two of the over so far"
"just about beats mid-off. Hit the splice of Gayle's bat as he tried to deposit it into the stands. Chase on for mid-off, and he does well to prevent the boundary"
gets a single to short fine. This might be an eventful over
"clever bowling, just 110.7 kph, that. Just a single once more"
"<strong>and the pressure finally tells</strong>. Ayub picks it up nicely off his hips and times it nicely, but there's nowhere near enough power on it and square leg barely has to move. Ayub falls after a stuttering innings."
"the faintest feather from Azam Khan and the ball races down to fine leg for four. Couldn't ask for a looser ball to start off against, and makes full use of it"
poked to short third man
"timed to mid-off, where a bit of sloppy work from Dan Christian allows the batsmen to come back for two"
Christian is welcomed with a tennis forehand back down the ground that had both the bowler and the umpire scarpering! Another boundary from Gayle
slower ball wide outside off stump. Much too wide for the umpire's liking
"That was lobbed into the air so high you could probably see the the Perseverance Rover if you were perched on it. And yet, while it stayed in the air ages, it drops down safely with no fielder managing to get anywhere near"
""
"<strong>and Gayle finally meets his downfall</strong>! Christian outfoxes him with a slower ball that put Gayle in two minds, checking his shot at a pivotal moment. Mohammad Amir at third man has a fairly simple catch"
bit of extra pace and bounce first up to Nawaz. Slashes and misses
finishes strongly with a couple of dot balls. Karachi sitting pretty right now
"lots of panic there! Wide delivery, and with the keeper fumbling, there was a quick run on. Nawaz nearly ended up run out"
nurdled into the onside for a single
"carried straight on, driven back to the bowler"
"fuller and flighted, driven back to Imad once more"
angled away to long-off
driven to the offside for another single
"and at the halfway stage, Quetta are 72 for four, and I'll hand you over to Hemant."
"length ball on the pads, looked like a slower ball. A leg-bye to short fine leg as Azam misses the flick"
"length ball on the pads, flicked towards fine leg. Nawaz wanted the second but Azam sends him back"
"slower length ball outside off, dabbed towards backward point"
"short of length, pulled just to the left of short midwicket. Was in the air but safe"
"<b>brilliant from Dan Christian.</b> Was a length around fourth stump, Azam steers it towards short third man. It went straight to Waqas Maqsood but Nawaz wanted a run, and was halfway down before realising Azam hasn't moved. Christian stops himself in the run-up, collects the one-bounce throw, dives towards the stumps and flicks the ball on to them to find Nawaz short"
a bouncer this time but it's too high
"length ball around off, pushes it towards long-off for a single"
<b>biggie!</b> Goes down the ground and smashed over the bowler's head. Quetta need many more of those from him
"length ball on the stumps, tucked away towards square leg"
"arm ball, swerving in. Defended from the crease"
"another one angling, pushes back after coming on the front foot"
"some width on offer and Cutting shows his power, goes back and butchers it between deep extra cover and long-off"
"length ball on the stumps, defended back towards the bowler"
"length ball on the pads, misses the swipe and gets a leg-bye to the left of the wicketkeeper"
"some extra bounce from short of length outside off, Cutting was looking to pull it away but misses and gets hit in the rib cage"
"length ball on the stumps, moves across and looks to flick. Misses and Quetta get another leg-bye"
"only 129.4kph but that took off from a length outside off, Azam went for the cut but got beaten by extra bounce"
"<b>gone!</b> Length outside off, Azam looks to swat it on the leg side but cannot middle it and an easy catch for Christian at short midwicket"
"short of length outside off, gets on his toes and defends it towards backward point"
backs away exposing the stumps but Imad follows him. Pushed down the ground for one
"on the stumps, pushed toward short midwicket"
"tossed up outside off, comes forward and pushes it towards extra cover"
gives himself room by moving towards the leg side and crashes this length ball past the diving extra cover for four
"looks to repeat the shot but Imad slowed it down this time, chopped into the ground"
"flatter around off, Cutting was once again looking to go for a cut but had to defend in the end as he hadn't created any room this time"
length ball on the pads and tucked away fine. The fielder at fine leg is a bit squarer and it beats him easily
"length ball at the stumps, defended"
"short of length around off, a half-pull in front of square leg"
"short outside off, Cutting moves away and goes for the cut but finds thin air. He would think he missed out there"
"length ball outside off, swatted towards long-on where Babar keeps it to one but his throw hits the stumps direct at the bowler's end and ricochets away for an overthrow"
"<b>the leg stump goes for a walk</b>. A 140.9kph length ball at the stumps, Cutting was looking to create room once again and aims to go down the ground but misses it completely. Quetta are in a real danger of being bowled out here"
"length ball at the stumps, tucked away towards square leg"
"length ball around off, pushed towards mid-off. Qais isn't interested in a single but Shinwari is. But does the wise thing by retracing his steps in time"
"a bounce from Amir, on middle and leg. Shinwari does well to get under it"
"length ball around off, pushed tamely towards extra cover"
short but down the leg side. Aleem Dar stretches his arms
"<b>Caught at mid-off.</b> Looked like a slower one from Amir. Fuller outside off, Shinwari looked to go over mid-off but got it from the toe end off the bat and Imad takes a simple catch"
"<s>off the mark as he works it towards square leg for a single</s>. No, in fact, they didn't take the run on offer"
"short and Qais looks to go big. Ends up top-edging it but luckily for him, it falls safe at square leg"
"length ball around off. Hasnain swings the bat, looking to go towards the leg side but it hits the outer half and speeds to the deep cover boundary"
"short of length at the batsman who fends it on the leg side. Qais wants a single but short midwicket moves across swiftly, collects and aims at the bowler's end. Qais dives but a direct-hit would have been interesting"
a bouncer this time and Hasnain bails out at the last moment
"<b>Arshad gets another</b>. Was a length ball outside off, Hasnain looked to run it towards third man but ended up playing too fine. Into the wicketkeeper's gloves off the face of the bat"
"fuller around off, Naseem Shah does well to defend it"
short and pulled away. Didn't get the timing right. A single to deep square leg
"length ball outside off, pushes it towards backward point"
"short from Amir, and it hit the batsman on the helmet. Right on the badge. Amir is making an enquiry if Qais is alright. The physio is out, and, I guess, is carrying out the concussion protocols. Think the umpires are saying the helmet needs to be replaced but looks like he will continue in the same one"
"fuller down the leg side, goes for the flick but ends up skying it towards midwicket. The fielder runs in from the deep but it lands well short"
"a yorker from around the wicket, pushed towards extra cover"
"Amir showing his full repertoire here. A slower length ball outside off, Naseem was late to spot it and ends up pushing it towards cover-point"
"slower one down the leg side, swings and misses"
slower again and this time Qais almost goes down on one knee and slogs it over long-on
"a think edge to the wicketkeeper as Qais looks to swing it over deep midwicket. Was a length ball angling across and a good catch by Clarke, tumbling forward"
what a start. Poor delivery from Hasnain. Short and wide and he absolutely leathers it to the backward point boundary
"well that was a brave leave. Sharjeel shouldered arms but the ball nipped back in, only missing the stumps on length. Good comeback"
"crisply struck through the offside, but straight to the main at backward point this time"
"comes back again, rapped him on the pads, and <strong>Hasnain strikes!</strong> Sharjeel reviews, though that did look dead in front to the naked eye. The review's in vain, with ball tracking showing it crunching into middle and leg. Fairly ordinary use of the DRS system, that."
Gorgeous delivery first up. Clarke could only hang his bat out and hope to miss it. Could easily have had two in two
"pushes him on the back foot, bowling in excess of 145. Brilliant first over from Hasnain"
Babar opens the face and opens his account with a single to third man
kept low and slashed through the covers. Past the man at point and goes to third man on the bounce
blocks it to mid-on and the pair exchange ends
Clarke moved across but Naseem followed him outside off stump. Clarke poked at it and was lucky the ball swung enough to miss the outside edge
"Clarke's struggling at the moment. Rapped on the thigh, no real foot movement. Naseem all over him at the moment"
sends this a bit too far down the off side
"had a hoick at that, huge appeal from Naseem Shah, who's convinced he got a tickle on it. Sarfaraz is convinced, and <strong>Quetta review</strong>. Nope, nothing on UltraEdge, so Clarke survives"
dabbled down to third man. Clarke will not fancy facing Hasnain right now I expect
"clears the front leg and has an almighty heave. Never really close to it, in all honesty"
"dragged it down legside slightly, clipped to short fine leg. Unlucky not to get four for that, a foot either side of the man and that was four"
"tucked Clarke up, who scampers to the non-striker's end"
knocked down to midwicket for a single
aimed for the yorker as Clarke moved across to the offside. The Englishman does well to dig it out and get a single
that was in the slot and Clarke had a whack at it. Didn't time it but got it in the gap between mid-on and midwicket and picks up a boundary for himself
"knee high full toss, gets away with it"
"that's a brilliant shot, and Clarke is beginning to settle now. A touch short even though it was bowled at full tilt. Clarke pounced and got it over the long-on boundary; that was all bottom hand"
"poor delivery, sat up for Clarke who was onto the length in a flash. Pulled him in front of square, smack out of the middle of the bat. That was majestic"
"one bounce for four over point this time, Clarke is spanking the youngster at the moment. Growing in confidence, he picks up the length early, sets himself up and lofts him over cover-point"
"took the pace of that one, and Clarke keeps the strike with a nudge to third man. 19 off the over"
nice shape on that delivery. Clarke strides forward and defends
"no defence this time. It was slightly fuller, in the slot and<strong> Clarke slaps that over extra cover for six</strong>"
"crunches this through the cover region, taking advantage of the vacant outfield and helps himself to another boundary. That wasn't even that short but Clarke was onto it"
"<strong>six more</strong>! This was a googly, but a tad short. Clarke got himself into position and bludgeoned that over long-off for another half dozen"
"another boundary, this is carnage. The 50's up for Karachi Kings with a delightful drive that beats a diving mid-on"
"Quetta losing the plot here a little but. That was a wide down leg side that the keeper couldn't hold onto, and the batsman come across for another couple"
and finishes that over with another gorgeous drive over the top of mid-off. <strong>27(!) off that first Qais Ahmed over</strong>
"good start from Shinwari. Angling it in from around the wicket and doubled Babar Azam over. Big appeal, but looks like the opener got an inside edge. He didn't, actually, according to replays"
"<strong>and the Clarke blitz finally comes to an end</strong>! It looked like it might be in the slot, and Clarke latched on to it, but long-on was in position and completes a straightforward catch. Not before Clarke smashes 46 off 23, and likely wins Karachi the game"
poked into the offside
gets in line and defends
rolls his wrists over it and tucks it into the onside to get off the mark
"driven back to the bowler. Excellent over from Shinwari. Babar, amazingly, has faced just six balls all Powerplay"
tucked away to short fine leg
"driven down to long-on for a single. That's all Karachi need, really"
"good ball, beats the outside edge"
"a bit more flight and fuller, driven to long-on"
"skidded this one through. Babar laps it fine, races away to the fine leg boundary. Costly error, that"
cut away to backward point
moved across the stumps and nudged it to midwicket
"carved to backward point, where Chris Gayle puts in what I suppose you could call a dive and saves the boundary. They still manage two, though"
"short ball, Babar gets underneath it and uppercuts him <strong>nearly all the way for six</strong>! Beautiful shot, all he needed to do was use Shinwari's own pace against him. Classy batting"
"off-stump line from Shinwari, drops it dead into the offside and takes a single"
"banged in short, Ingram gets a single to third man"
"no timing on that one, frustrating Babar. 76 for 2"
sliced down to cover-point
gets on the back foot and bunts it down to long-on
"fuller, skidded on, driven back to Nawaz"
driven to extra cover
"gave it a bit of air, Ingram gets a single"
driven down to long-off
drops it short again and Babar leans back and smashes him through cow corner for a boundary. This is poor bowling
"better ball, defended to the offside"
leans into a drive to long-off
"wrong'un, slapped to extra cover"
"slightly fuller, guided to long-off."
"a wrong'un that gets a single, and Hemant's back to knock off the winning runs"
"<b>An excellent catch by Sarfaraz</b>. Babar departs but you would believe there are not enough runs left. Coming to the delivery, it was a length ball around off, Babar looked to run it down to third man but the ball kept a bit low and he ended up edging it behind. It went fast and low to Sarfaraz's right and he did well to get low and pouch it with one hand"
a bouncer to welcome him to the crease. Nabi sways away
tries for the yorker but ends up bowling a full toss. pushed back towards the bowler
goes for the yorker again but ends up bowling a low full toss. Nabi flicks it through midwicket to get off the mark with a boundary
tailing into the batsman. Nabi goes for the drive but gets an inside edge on to the pads
"fuller on the stumps and flicked away this time, uppishly towards deep square leg for second boundary off the over"
pushes it towards long-off for a walking single
"length ball, pitching around middle and leg and spinning away, flicked towards midwicket. The bowler fields himself"
"fuller on the pads, turns it towards backward square leg"
"looks to launch it over long-on but fails to middle. Off the inner half, it dribbles towards deep midwicket"
brings out the reverse sweep and hits it behind point to bring up the 100 for Karachi
"fuller around off, defends it towards cover-point for a single"
"yorker length outside off, squeezes it out square of the wicket on the off side"
short and pulled towards deep-backward square leg
"a bouncer outside off, Nabi gets down and sways away. One for the over, says the umpire"
"<b>beaten</b>. Short of length outside off, looks to steer it towards third man and misses"
"goes for the yorker, just outside off. Nabi squeezes it out towards cover"
"slower one this time. A length ball around off, Ingram waits before opening the face to guide it towards backward point"
"<b>Nabi is in hurry.</b> A length ball around off, Nabi goes deep and smashes it over long-on"
"<b>another one!</b> This was short from Cutting, and for a moment it looked like Nabi was cramped but in fact he has smashed it flat over deep midwicket"
"he could have finished it off here. Was a high full toss around off, and Nabi cannot get the room and ends up mistiming it towards long-on"
"fuller outside off, comes forward and drives it towards sweeper cover"
<b>And it's all over.</b> A full toss and Nabi doesn't miss out this time. Smashes it over deep square leg for the third six of the over
