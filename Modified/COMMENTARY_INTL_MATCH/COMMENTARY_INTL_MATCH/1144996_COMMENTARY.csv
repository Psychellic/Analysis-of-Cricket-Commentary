"<b>keeps low</b>! The moment he gets his radar right, he has the breakthrough. Shami and his big heart get the luck they need. India get the early wicket they want.

Pitches short of a length and scoots through under his bat even as he tries desperately to bring it down quickly enough in front of off stump"

"back of a length, at the pads of Starc, he deflects it away to long leg"
there it is. Short and angled down leg. Handscomb won't have to play those. At least not in this format
"creams it down the ground! He responds to the pitched-up delivery with his hands, an instinctive push from Starc without his feet moving too much. Somehow he manages to time the pants off it"
"and the next ball, is of course, the short ball. Climbing up towards the peak of Starc's helmet. The batsman gets up on his toes and blunts it towards cover"

"<b>strikes him</b> on the body, somewhere near the hip, as Starc is slow to bring his bat around to meet the shortish delivery cramping him on leg stump. That's the problem left-handers face against Bumrah. They think the ball will always go across and then this happens..."

"floats it up there, seeing if he'll be willing to drive away from the body. Nope, says Handscomb. Not today"
"<b>keeps low again</b>! Shami's banging it into the pitch and it's responding to all his wiles. Handscomb is jumping back in his crease, expecting it to come up around his hips, but instead it sneaks down towards his shins. Just about makes contact"
"well, there we go. That's normal. The short ball coming up above stump height and being defended with no trouble"
"pitches it up outside off, Starc drives to mid-off"
<B>falls short of Bumrah</b> as he moves to his left in his followthrough. The back of a length delivery holds up just a touch - enough to secure a bit of leading edge from Starc as he tries to flick the ball off his thighs
waits a fraction of a second more on this short ball at his hips and puts it away behind square leg
goes round the wicket and immediately looks more of a threat. The ball is homing in on the stumps - and Starc's pads - pitched up and menacing. A straight bat comes down just in time
"bouncer, angled into the left-hander, searching for his ribs. Starc ducks out of danger"
"short of a length and outside off, no shot"
"comes round the wicket for a good length ball spinning into Handscomb. The batsman moves back, clears the front leg and flicks to midwicket"
"reads the flight on this early, lunges forward, head over the ball, hands on top of it as he sweeps behind square leg. Solid shot. And that forces India to put a man back to prevent the shot"
"steps out of his crease but Kuldeep makes it dip, and sharply at that. With short leg and leg slip waiting, Handscomb has to be careful to keep it down"
"this is too short and on this slow pitch, Handscomb has all the time he needs to rock back and whip it through midwicket. It does turn, perhaps a little more than he expects, but he's able to adjust because he's watching the ball so closely"
comes down the pitch to the googly on off stump and hits it back at the bowler
quicker and shorter and on leg stump as well. Handscomb nudges it to long leg
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go"
"shortish and outside off, no interest from Handscomb again"
rises with the bounce on this delivery outside off and runs it to point
"<b>drags it on</b>! Handscomb swipes at the air. Bumrah screams with joy. Australia fading away. This is that nagging line, on and around the off stump, trapping the batsman in his crease. It might have kept low a touch too. Certainly has him playing a little later than he should have and the inside edge knocks over the stumps. <b>Joint-highest wicket-taker for the series</b>"
<b>beats the outside edge</b> with a short ball that hits the deck and zips through past Lyon
"good length on middle and off, Lyon pushes it down the ground"
tosses it up from over the wicket outside off. Starc leaves it
"drifts into middle, which is to Starc's liking as he gets forward and flicks through to deep midwicket"
"<b>googly</B> which Lyon doesn't pick. He comes forward to block, looking for it to spin into him, and is comfortably beaten"
another wrong 'un but this time Lyon's prepared. He plants his front leg across his stumps and lets it go outside off
"<b>traps him</b>! It's a full toss. Lyon plays all around it. The sweep shot doesn't connect and Lyon knows he's plumb. This is the orthodox legbreak. It lands flush on the big toe. In such cases the umpires project a straight line from the point of impact to the stumps. Will this ball hit it? Yes, says Ian Gould."

"flighted outside off, looks to go big down the ground, ends up slicing it over cover"
"fuller around off, pushed towards the left of cover fielder for one"
"fuller on the pads, looks to flick it away but misses, rapped on the pads"
"drives this full ball on the front foot, Kuldeep moves across to his left to stop"
"length ball, around off, Hazlewood goes for the sweep but straight to square leg"
"length outside off, comes forward and defends"
"fuller on the stumps, clears his front leg and just clears the mid-on fielder"
"fuller again, driven along the ground this time, Pujara makes a tumbling stop at mid-on"
"length outside off, defended on the off side"
"length again, comes forward and blocks"
"flighted outside off, on a length and spinning away, left alone"
"flighted again, fuller outside off, driven hard, Kohli at extra cover intercepts and manages to deflect it towards mid-off"
"length outside off, lobbed in the air, over extra cover, lands safe"
"length outside off, pushed towards covers from the crease"
"goes aerial again, this time straight back over mid-on, the fielder puts in the chase and stops it just inside"
flighted outside off and driven nicely but the cover fielder moves to his left and cuts it
"starts with a length ball but way down the leg side, Pant makes a good diving stop"
"back of length outside off, punched towards mid-off"
"length ball, swatted through midwicket, Agarwal runs all the way and puts in the dive, not very elegant but effective"
"length, just around off and middle, Hazlewood was on the back foot but gets his bat in the line to keep it out"
"short one, angling in, Hazlewood tries to back away but the ball follows him, gets hit on the arm guard as he takes his eyes off"
"a fuller one, on the stumps, Hazlewood stands in his crease and blocks"
"short of length around off, slow turn, punched towards mid-off from the back foot"
"googly, length ball around off, defended back"
"tossed up around off, lobs it towards mid-off but the fielder is a bit deep, <strong>300 comes up with that single</strong>"
"flighted outside off, length ball and spinning away, left alone"
"<strong>that's five-for for Kuldeep</strong>, done with the wrong'un. Length ball, pitching just outside off and spinning back to beat the forward defence, rapped on the pad and up goes the finger. <b>Hazlewood decides to review it.</b> Impact is in the line, no bat involved. And it's just clipping the top of leg stump, umpire's call there and that remains out"
gets it to straighten after hitting back of a length. A squared-up Khawaja blocks towards point
"lovely bowling. It's nice and full. It's searching for off stump. Or lbw. Khawaja just about reacts early enough, getting the bat to intervene"
<b>outside edge</b> as Khawaja molds his body into the shape of an S as the ball nips away off the seam. No run to point
"shortish on off stump, defends towards cover"
lets go the back of a length delivery outside off
<b>brilliantly done</b>! That's what Test-quality batsmen should do. Read the bad ball early. Be ready to put it away. This is angled too steeply into Khawaja's pads and he whips it away to the long leg boundary quite imperiously
<b>too good</b>! Pitches it up. Gets just a hint of movement off the pitch. Harris doesn't feel like moving his feet just yet. No such qualms about going for the on-the-up drive though and ends up beaten
"good length on middle stump, Harris is right behind this one"
"good length, outside off, no shot"
"lifter, going across the left-hander. Harris does well to read the line early and let it go"
leans into the cover drive - although there is a bit of risk in here since he isn't to the pitch of the ball.
"back of a length and outside off, allows it through to the keeper"
"blocks a shortish delivery on off stump. It appears almost as if he gets squared up every ball from Shami. This angle from round the wicket, and the ball straightening isn't really to his liking"
works a full delivery on middle away to mid-on
moves across in front of off stump and then legs the back of a length ball go outside his eyeline
"good length, outside off, good leave"
"lovely bowling. The line is perfect. Nagging away in that corridor outside off. Khawaja does well too, picking it up early and avoiding the danger altogether"
"spears it into middle, looking for lbw, especially with Khawaja stuck in the crease. He does well despite that, bringing down a straight bat"
nudges it off his pads through midwicket. Good balance. Lovely wristwork
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go"
"good length, outside off, shoulders arms"
"hangs on his back foot, and this ball is perfect for it, back of a length and offering him the room he needs to crunch it to point"
"<b>ducks straight into the line of a short ball</b> and it balloons of his glove over to gully. This one is really meant to sail over the batsman, but a fourth-day pitch throws its own challenges to the batsmen. Harris is lucky that it hasn't carried"
"shortish and outside off, defends"
