"back of a length on off, stands tall and forces a single down to long-on"

backs away to a short one and picks backward point as he slaps it. Straight to the fielder but they do well take the run
"<b>Manish Pandey with a brilliant effort to save a six</b>. A wide fuller one that Lomror lofts over the in-field. Pandey at long-off snaffles it reverse-cupped, leans back as he does so, and is right in front of the boundary. He's falling over with the momentum and releases the ball as he's falling away. Top effort. Just about lets the ball go as he falls over the boundary line"

gone. Gowtham has picked out long-off and that's the game. Fails to get hold of this fullish ball. Doesn't help that it's curving into him and he doesn't get the room he's looking for as a result. Chips it straight into the hands of long-off
all over. A fuller one that curves in and Archer whips it away off the pads to deep midwicket
