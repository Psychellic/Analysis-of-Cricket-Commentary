"full, slanting away into a wide-ish line outside off. Stirling chases after it with no feet, and can't make contact"
"back of a length, some swing back in towards leg stump to cramp up Stirling, who's looking to stay leg-side of the ball and give himself some room. Punched to short cover"
"length ball slanting away from off stump, and Stirling gets off the mark with a streaky stroke. Looks to carve it through point, gets a thick outside edge that flies to the right of the lone wide slip in the cordon"
"ooh, nearly. Now Stirling shuffles across, looking to go leg-side, and Cottrell goes full, at leg stump. Stirling has exposed two of his stumps, and he misses the flick, but this ball swings juuust a hint and <b>misses leg stump by inches</b>"
"back of a length close to off stump, lets it come on and steers to third man"
"full, some swing in towards the pads, clipped towards midwicket, where the fielder dives to his right to stop the ball"
"sashays away from leg stump to make himself room, and Pierre follows him with a back of a length ball at the body. Chopped down towards backward point"
"full, fired down the leg side. O'Brien misses the sweep"
"he's very wary of giving away width. Fired into the pads, and O'Brien misses another sweep. doesn't have the time to get a proper swing in, and he's hit on the pad. No turn, so this is going down leg"
"again, a flat length ball angled into the pads, with no turn. Swept along the ground to long leg"
"once again, angling into that slightly-outside-leg line, expecting Stirling to want to make room. Swings at it and drags a sweep wide of mid-on, without really middling it"
"bam. The last one was a little too full to get any real elevation. This one's the perfect length, and it's on the stumps. Stirling moves away from leg stump, makes a little more hitting room, and launches it high over the long-on boundary"
"fired into the pads again, and Stirling swipes, a little ungainly but quite effectlve, manages to hit it flat and still clear Kieron Pollard at midwicket, hitting to his left"
"ooh, that's not even a half-chance. Length ball angling across the stumps, maybe a cutter. Looks to make room and hit over cover, ends up slicing airily to the left of point, where Walsh dives but can't reach the ball. Was a fair distance from him, and was dipping too"
"wallop. That's back of a length, on middle stump or thereabouts, and he's in position nice and early, hips opened up, to hit a short-arm pull high over the square leg boundary"
"back of a length on leg stump, tucked away through midwicket"
"full slower ball, angling away into the fifth-stump channel. Slashes hard and slices to third man, mostly along the ground"
"full outside off, and O'Brien does very well to slice that in the air, quite deliberately, with an open face, to lift it over backward point"
"fullish on off stump. Sticks in the pitch slightly as O'Brien drives, and it's in the air briefly but lands safely enough to the right of deep point"
"back of a length on off stump, and for the second time O'Brien is in position extremely early to pull a not-particularly-short ball up and over the forward square leg boundary. Picked the length so early"
"length ball on middle and off, shows the full face to push down to long-on. Unusual fielding position for a fast bowler in the powerplay, but Williams bowls a lot of slower balls"
"sees Stirling shaping to make room and follows him with a back-of-a-length ball. Punches firmly with a straight bat, and the ball rolls to long-on off the inner half of the bat"
"lovely shot, for just a single. Back of a length, angling into the stumps. Steps across and flicks with his front leg in the air, to the right of deep square leg"
"this is some start. Williams has two options with Stirling always looking to make himself room. He can follow him, or make him reach for the ball. Goes for option B, with a full slower one, but it isn't far enough from Stirling's reach, and he lofts it up and over cover, and it carries all the way for six"
"back of a length on off stump, lets it come on and dabs gently into the point region"
"starts with a slower ball, but the line is all wrong. Full, at the pads, and fine leg is in the circle. Clips it away neatly and finds the gap to the right of the fielder"
"another slower ball. This one's full on off stump, but not full enough to deny Stirling elevation. He spots it early, keeps his shape, and launches it in muscular fashion over the long-on boundary"
"has this carried all the way too? Length ball on off stump, and Stirling makes a bit of room and frees his arms through a lovely lofted drive, over long-off this time, and it's just cleared the boundary"
"goes for the full-pace yorker this time, and he gets his line all wrong again, fires it down the leg side. Too quick for Stirling to connect with the flick"
low full-toss on leg stump. Shows the full face to block it out to midwicket
"looks to give himself room and Bravo bowls a slower ball, back of a length, at leg stump. Looks to slap through point, plays too early, and drags it back to the bowler"
"full slower ball on middle and leg, driven down to long-on, showing the full face again"
"plenty, it looks like. Full, angling into leg stump. Stirling makes himself room, and launches the ball clean and high over the long-off boundary, to bring up a half-century off 20 balls. Brilliant"
"Change of angle, no change in outcome. Bowls it flat at leg stump, and again he makes some room, this time by clearing his front leg, and hoicks it away over wide long-on"
"flat again, and he's so concerned about denying him swinging room that he bowls it down th eleg side. Stirling can't connect with his sweep"
"sees him trying to make room again, and this time bowls it shorter and wider outside off stump. Reaches for the ball, looking to slap it through point, ends up top-edging loopily, but away from the reach of short third man, to his left"
"four more. Length ball outside leg stump, and he gets down on his back knee and sweeps firmly to the right of the fielder at deep backward square leg"
"deep backward square leg moved a little finer after the previous ball, and the other fielder in that area is a short fine leg. Neither of them is anywhere near the direction of this sweep shot. A full ball on leg stump, swept firmly along the ground to the forward square leg boundary"
"back of a length on leg stump, goes on the back foot and punches to deep midwicket"
"full on leg stump, clipped down to long-on"
"poor bowling. Full, angling down leg, and fine leg is inside the circle. O'Brien flicks it away gleefully to the right of the fielder"
"slower ball, and again he slides down leg. Can't put bat on this, though. Was a length ball, and he was playing a half-flick, half-sweep kind of shot. He's overstepped too..."
"full-toss. Fairly high too - was it over the waist? Seems to be, but isn't called. Swats it away dismissively to the backward square leg boundary"
"slower ball, full on off stump. Clipped down the ground to long-on"
"slower ball, full and wide of off stump. Can't get any power on his drive, and extra-cover can move to his left to cut it off"
"slower length ball on off stump, clipped down to long-on"
"back of a length, spinning into the stumps from just outside leg. Goes back to punch to long-on"
"good ball. Quickish length ball pitching on leg stump. Looks to flick and sends a leading edge back to the bowler, on the bounce"
"wham. That's some super-quick footwork from Stirling. Flat length ball, pitching just outside leg, and he clears his front leg, gets down on his back knee, and slog-sweeps high over wide long-on"
"back of a length close to off stump, opens his bat face to dab towards short third man. Should have only been one, but a slightly wayward throw at the keeper's end concedes an overthrow"
"wrong'un on off stump, fairly full. Presses forward and defends - yup, that's right - into the covers"
"good ball again. Hits a nice length on off stump and it's another wrong'un. Looks to flick off the front foot, plays too early, and nearly offers a return catch but the ball drops short of the bowler, diving forward"
"slower length ball wide of off stump, and O'Brien reaches out and slices it deliberately over backward point. The fielder at third man runs quickly to his right, and slaps the ball back into play mid-dive, with is feet in the air. Hayden Walsh with that bit of athleticism"
"again that wide line, and O'Brien carves it to deep backward point on the bounce, off the outside half of the bat"
"full outside off, driven straight to extra-cover, who just came in off the rope to allow square leg to move back"
"back of a length close to off, dabs it nice and fine but short third man is pretty fine too, and he moves quickly to his left to cut it off"
"big shout for lbw, but Gregory Brathwaite shakes his head. Back of a length offcutter, looks to shuffle across and whip it through short fine leg. Impact is outside off. Interesting, a belated call for no-ball too!"
"slower length ball on off stump. Goes for the big slog, but swings too early, and toe-ends it down the ground, mostly along the ground, to long-on"
"back of a length wide of off, the line is quite deliberate, but the margin for error is small and he ends up bowling it wide of the tramline"
"digs this slower ball into the pitch, back of a length, fifth-stump line. Looks to punch through the covers, plays too early, and the ball rolls into the leg side off the inside edge"
"he's bowled pretty well so far, and this is a wrong'un that O'Brien fails to pick. Clears his front leg to slog over long-on, but misses completely, and it spins past the leg stump and the keeper as well"
"length ball, opens his bat face and stabs through point"
"he's beaten the bat with the googly once. Now a flat legbreak, on a length, spinning away from off stump. Looks to make room and hit over the covers, and it spins away to beat the outside edge"
"now he beats him with lack of pace. Dangled up slow on the stumps, and he goes for the big sweep, swings too early and misses, and the ball hits him on the body"
"flat, down the leg side. Swipes at it and gets a bit of bat on it to send it running away towards the fine leg boundary. Williams chases back from short fine, slides, and just about manages to pull it back in time"
"shortish, fairly wide, and Stirling misses out with the cut, hitting it straight to backward point on the edge of the circle"
"flat length ball spinning from leg to middle. Looks to flick off the front foot, gets a leading edge into the point region"
"short, wide slower ball. Sits up nicely, and O'Brien slaps it away well in front of the man at deep point"
"Pollard is finding a way to create something off this surface. Digs another slower offcutter into the pitch, back of a length, and O'Brien swings too early into an attempted loft over mid-off. Goes high over the off side, not far from the pitch, and Pollard himself chases after it, dives to his left, but <b>can't get his hands to the ball</b>"
"back of a length outside off, another slower ball, carved to the sweeper at deep cover point"
"that wide line again, but this time not a slower ball, and it's a risky ball to bowl with backward point and short third man in the circle. Throws his hands at it, opens his face, and carves it into the gap between the two fielders, up and over"
"slower ball, full and wide of off stump. Steps across and flat-bats to deep point"
"another slower ball, fairly full and fairly wide. O'Brien plays a checked drive that he ends up chipping in the air, half-deliberately, on the bounce to deep point"
"length ball spinning away from off stump, goes deep in his crease and punches to deep point"
"wham. He's bowled pretty well, but this one was flighted and landed right in the slot on off stump. Clears his front leg, and slog-sweeps high and hard over the deep midwicket boundary to bring up Ireland's 150"
"back of a length on off stump, stays leg-side of the ball and chops to the left of backward point"
"tossed up on middle and off, driven inside-out to the cover sweeper"
"shortish outside off, chopped to backward point"
"flat, back of a length, on off stump, makes room and punches to deep point"
"full on off stump, punched to the left of extra-cover"
in the blockhole fairly wide of off. Beaten as he tries to reach out and carve it away
"bowled him. This has been an excellent over from Bravo, a demonstration of what he brings to the T20 table. He's known for the slower balls, but they didn't work in his first over, and he's gone full pace for the first three balls of this over, all of them in and around the blockhole. This ball is the best of the lot, dipping late, under the bat of O'Brien, and crashing into off stump"
"full, on middle and leg, jams his bat down to dig it out, back to the bowler"
"length ball on off stump, punched towards mid-off and Balbirnie takes off for a non-existent single. But Simmons misfields, and they sneak the single. Then they go for a non-existent second run, and Simmons, having moved to his left to retrieve the ball from an extra-cover-ish position, misses the stumps with his throw, with Stirling a long way from his crease"
"length ball on off stump, makes a bit of room to punch, but can't find the gap past extra-cover"
pushed into the covers
"got him, and Stirling falls short of a century. Tossed up slow, and Stirling, who's played the slog-sweep brilliantly all day, goes too early at this one, top-edges it, and offers a simple catch to the man at deep midwicket. The end of an outstanding innings from the Ireland opener"
"flat and full on leg stump, driven inside-out and extra-cover dives right to stop it"
"flat legbreak spinning away from off stump. Looks to drive inside-out, isn't to the pitch, and the ball spins past his outside edge"
"fuller now, driven with an open face to sweeper cover"
flighted wrong'un outside off. Driven straight to extra-cover. A brilliant over to end a brilliant spell in the context of this match. 1 for 25 when Ireland seemed to be hitting a boundary a ball at one stage
"appeal for lbw as Balbirnie stretches forward and across to sweep, and misses an inward-slanted full ball from Bravo. Hit the back leg in front of leg stump, but the ball was sliding down leg"
"slower ball, back of a length, no real width. Chopped towards backward point"
"in the blockhole on off stump, jabbed with an open face to the left of cover"
"dipping slower yorker on off stump. Makes a lot of room and jabs it straight to cover and sets off for a single. Delany was slow taking off, and Rutherford had all the time in the world to aim at the keeper's end stumps, but he misses"
"very full, angling down leg. Looks to flick but can only get a tickle of his leg down to the keeper"
dipping middle-stump yorker. Keeps it out and blocks to midwicket
"full on off stump, makes room and slices over the point region. A bit of bad bounce makes Walsh misfield as he runs in off the point boundary"
"gone, one follows another follows another. Flat length ball speared into the pitch, outside off. Looks to make room and hit over the covers, but he ends up too far from the ball as this spins away sharply, and he slices it in the air, off the outside half of the bat, straight to the man at short third man"
"shortish, a bit of width, and he cuts it away to the left of Walsh at deep point"
"another. Again, quite deliberately short and wide, speared flat into the pitch, using that sweeper as a defensive fielder to keep Ireland down to singles. He was happy giving away the single, but Tector cuts in the air, and not far enough to the right of backward point, who completes a fairly simple catch"
"full outside off, driven with an open face to deep point"
"full on leg stump, clipped to long-on"
"full, at the stumps. Makes room to drive but finds Pollard in the way, diving to his right at extra-cover"
"length ball slanting across to off stump, and that's neatly done. Lets it come on and opens his face to guide it extremely fine, to the left of third man"
"Length ball on off stump. Looks to make room and steer it away, but it's too close to backward point. They run anyway, even as Khary Pierre spins and throws to the bowler's end, and it runs away for an overthrow"
"four more. Gary Wilson is finding ways to score quickly here. Full, on off stump, and he uses his wrists very nicely to drill this drive between mid-off and extra-cover"
"appeal for lbw as Wilson misses a sweep, but it's not given. <b>West Indies have reviewed</b>, though. Looked at first glance that it pitched outside leg. There's an edge onto the pad as well, and it stays not-out"
"in the blockhole on middle stump. Stays leg-side of the ball, can't place his drive past cover point"
back of a length on off stump. Pulled firmly to the left of deep midwicket
"slower length ball spinning down leg like an offbreak. Looks to swipe it down to long-on, misses and is hit on the back leg"
"shortish offcutter spinning towards leg stump, and Delany opens up at the hips and swats it away powerfully enough to beat deep backward square leg to his left. Fielder didn't have to go a long way, but he had no chance"
"full, angling into leg stump, and Delany hits it hard and flat, straight over the non-striker's head. Didn't miss the yorker by that much, but he cleared his front leg and made just enough swinging room, with a bit of bottom-hand shovel to give it impetus"
"looks for the slower ball wide of off stump, ends up bowling it far too wide for the umpire's liking. No stroke attempted"
"shot. Full on off stump, and he gets his front leg out of the way and brings down a straight bat to shovel this over extra-cover, and times it so well that it easily clears the rope"
"back of a length on off stump, makes room and stabs to backward point"
"slower ball outside off, and the length is so good. It's almost flighted, it looks like it can be driven easily through the covers, but it dips and bounces to beat Wilson's angled bat"
"full now, outside off, flat-batted to deep point"
"bowled him. What a comeback this has been for Bravo. Again that dipping off-stump yorker, and Delany jams his bat down in a desperate hurry but can't keep it out. There's a bit of late swerve in too, to help it past the inside edge"
"in the blockhole on off stump, clipped down to long-on to bring up Ireland's 200"
"full outside off, flat-batted to the cover sweeper"
"another yorker, on middle and leg, driven inside-out to long-off. End of a fantastic spell from Bravo. He gave away 18 in his first over, and he's taken 2 for 10 in his next three."
"full on the pads, clipped to the right of deep midwicket"
"length ball down leg, too far from Dockrell to connect with the sweep"
"again a length ball pitching outside leg, but closer to the stumps. Slower ball too. Swings too early at a leg-side swipe, only manages to get a bit of pad on it. Maybe some inside edge too"
"slower ball, back of a length, leg-stumpish. Pulled to the right of deep backward square leg"
"good over, this. He's making sure he's only letting Ireland hit to one side of the field. Knows Dockrell is looking to make room, so he can afford to pitch outside leg. Slower ball, back of a length, and he misses his swipe, and it rolls towards short fine leg off thigh pad"
"gone. This one's on middle stump, length ball aiming to hit the top of middle, and Wilson swings across the line and misses"
"and Cottrell finishes with two wickets in two balls. Full, pitched right up at Simi's feet. Flicks it and times it very well. Almost hits it all the way for six, but he finds Lewis in the way, moving to his left from deep backward square leg. The momentum nearly causes him to step over the rope, but he manages to steady himself inches from the rope"
"slides in with the angle at off stump, Simmons presses forward and blocks it back to the bowler"
"shorter and comes on just outside off, Simmons hangs back and punches a single to the right of the bowler, down towards long-on"
"shorter and darted on a fourth-stump line, punched down towards long-off for one"
"back of a length and holds its line outside off, Simmons stands up tall and punches to cover"
"flatter and slower outside off, nurdled away to the midwicket region"
"liberally tossed on middle, tip and run to the covers for one. Tight first over from Simi"
"short and heading down leg, loose ball from McCarthy first-up. Leg-side wide"
"shorter and angling across off stump, Lewis sizes it up and pulls it off the back foot over mid-on. Not middled, but he still fetches a four"
"back of a length on the hips, tucked around the corner for a single"
"back of a length and nibbling away slightly outside off, Simmons shoulders arms"
"slower ball, on a length, on off stump, Simmons sits back and just drops the ball to the off side"
"a touch too full on middle, Simmons gloriously drives with a straight bat down to long-on"
"110ks slower, short ball outside off, Lewis delays his pull and smacks it over midwicket for six. Bam!"
"Pow! Shortish, pitches outside off and sits up, and Simmons rocks back and smacks it straight back, making the umpire flinch as it flies past him, to his right, at about chest height"
"full now, no difference, hits it with quick hands, flat and back over the bowler's head"
"whack. Drops a little shorter on off stump, and Simmons clears his front leg and swats it away cleanly, all the way over the deep midwicket boundary"
"looks to make him reach for the ball with a wide one outside off, ends up bowling far too wide"
"slowish full-toss, goes too hard at the lofted drive and drags it to wide long-on, all along the ground"
"full outside off, driven to cover point"
"in the blockhole on off stump, squeezes a drive out with an open face, can't beat cover point once more"
"Gorgeous. Full, angling across to off stump, and Simmons just leans into a drive with the straightest of bats, easing it into the gap to the left of mid-off"
"full again, a little wider. Goes hard at the square drive, and Tector dives to his right to make a good stop at backward point"
"and the change of angle pays immediate dividends, but it needs a lot of help from George Dockrell, who takes a sensational diving catch after running to his right from deep point. Length ball angling into off stump, and Simmons, clearing his front leg, ends up slicing over the covers rather than lofting over mid-off as intended. The cover fielder runs back, and he's also in Dockrell's line of sight as he sprints to his right on the boundary, but he has eyes only for one thing, the ball, and he grabs it with both hands while falling to his right"
"full, angling into leg stump, and Lewis puts it away easily, flicking to the left of short fine leg"
"length ball angling into middle and off, defended back to the bowler"
"short, dug into the pitch on an off-stump line. Lewis swivels to pull, but doesn't middle it. The ball hurries onto him, cramping him for room, and he ends up skewing it in the air, but it drops safely in front of midwicket running in from the edge of the circle"
"looks for the slower-ball yorker, ends up bowling a half-volley on off stump. Clears his front leg and hits cleanly over mid-off"
"another slower one, fullish, but this time Lewis gets a little too much underneath the ball rather than behind it with his lofted hit. Kevin O'Brien, running back and to his right from mid-off, can't get to it, though"
"nothing wrong with this hit. Length ball, slanting across to off stump, and Lewis makes a bit of room and clatters it away over the covers, with a full follow-through finishing over his right shoulder"
back of a length on leg stump. Stays leg-side of the ball and pushes to mid-off
"wide-ish yorker, reaches out and jabs to cover point, who dives left to make a good stop"
"makes a lot of room, and Young responds with a shortish slower ball on off stump. Absolutely throws everything he has into an attempted carve over point, and ends up slicing it over short third man instead. He won't mind it as long as he gets four runs for it"
"back of a length, angling into the hip, tucked away to deep square leg"
"short on off stump, and Lewis swivels to pull well in front of square, leaving deep square leg no chance"
"back of a length close to off stump, stabbed towards backward point"
"back of a length, angling in towards off stump, defended to mid-off"
"shortish on off stump, skids on to cramp Hetmyer a little on the pull, which he plays along the ground to the right of midwicket"
"back of a length outside off, stands tall and looks to steer it past backward point, but the fielder dives right to cut it off"
"slower ball, angling into middle and leg, clipped into the midwicket region"
"length ball slanting across to off stump, eased to cover point off the front foot"
"full, aiming towards middle and leg. Looks to step across and paddle past short fine, but misses. Not much of an lbw appeal - that clearly pitched outside leg"
"full, angling into off stump, clipped to deep square leg"
"back of a length, slanting across to off stump. Makes some room and carves to deep point"
"length ball angling into the pads, clipped to long leg"
"left-arm spinner, to left-hand batsman. Dangled up on off stump, and he clears his front leg and sinks down low for a slog-sweep over the square leg boundary"
"short outside off, cut away to deep point"
"short, sits up on middle stump, and he opens up at the hips and pulls high and a long, long way beyond the square leg boundary"
"six more, and Lewis continues to feast on Ireland's bowling with his third 50-plus score of the limited-overs series. Tossed up full outside off, and he launches it cleanly over the long-off boundary"
"clearly under pressure now, he wants to make Lewis reach for the ball and bowls a wide outside off"
"this is better execution. Wide line again, very full, but just within the limits of legality by the umpire's reckoning. No stroke offered"
"full outside off, swept along the ground to deep midwicket"
"full on the stumps, stays leg-side of the ball for a push into the covers"
"shortish on middle stump, whipped off the hip to deep square leg"
"length ball on leg stump, stays leg-side of the ball and jabs to the right of extra-cover with an open face"
"big shout for lbw as Hetmyer looks to work this across the line. Seemed to pitch outside leg, but Balbirnie belatedly gestures to take a review. The replay suggests it actually straightened a little, from just back of a length. No inside edge, and he's playing from the crease. Pitches a couple of inches outside leg, so it'll stay not-out"
"full, leg-stumpish, clipped away to deep square leg"
"slower length ball on leg stump, makes a lot of room to carve over the covers, and West Indies lose another wicket to an excellent running catch on the boundary. This time it's Tector sprinting left from deep point, grabbing it safely with both hands, and completing his effort with a tumble"
shuffles out of his crease and McCarthy bowls a slower ball on an off-stumpish line. Clipped away through square leg
"back of a length close to off stump, punched past the diving extra-cover fielder to long-off"
"wow. That's a glorious hit. Fullish, angling across to off stump, and he clears his front leg and clatters it over the wide long-on boundary with the purest, smoothest swing of a bat imaginable"
"slower ball slanting away from off stump, gets on the front foot to dab towards point"
"full outside off, gets forward to ease this through point"
"bouncer over leg stump, goes well over Pollard's head as he ducks perfunctorily while it passes him"
"on the pads now, can't get his bat across in time to flick, gets a bit of pad on it into the square leg region"
"back of a length on off stump, goes deep in his crease to punch to long-on"
"tossed up on off stump, and Hetmyer clears his front leg and easily clears long-off. The fielder on the rope doesn't bother him"
"flatter and quicker now, on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"tossed up a little wider outside off, Hetmyer reaches out to try and clear long-off again, but he doesn't get the desired elevation, and it nearly carries to Balbirnie on the rope. He's a little late to react and move forward. Could have been a catch if he had"
"shorter now, worked away to deep midwicket"
"oh no. He nearly gave away his wicket attempting the same shot a couple of balls ago. Dockrell floats it up in that wide line again, inviting him to reach out and take on long-off. Goes for it again, doesn't catch it as well as he'd like, and this time Balbirnie is in position to move towards the ball and complete the low catch with a dive forward and to his right"
"length ball angled into the stumps. Looks to make room to punch through cover, can't. Ends up playing it back to the bowler"
"similar ball, similar shot attempted, similar result. Does well not to offer any room, and the ball skids on rather than turning away from the left-hander"
"slides this on towards leg stump and Pooran manages to punch it away down the ground, to long-on"
"yikes, that's a bad ball. Drags it down short on off stump, and Pollard moves quickly, back foot back, left foot sliding away to make himself open at the hips, and from there it's just a powerful swat over the midwicket boundary"
"a full ball, right in the slot on off stump, to follow the long-hop. Pollard drills it incredibly hard, all along the ground and back past the bowler"
"tossed up a little slower now, on off and middle, clipped gently into the midwicket region"
"sees Pollard look to make room, bowls wide of off stump to make him reach out. Too far out of his reach, and it's called wide"
"another wide one outside off. Pollard is not sure whether to leave or reach out and drive, and all the movement in front of him causes Wilson to lose sight of the ball and fumble it"
"tossed up outside off, driven into the covers"
"back of a length on off stump, whipped down the ground to long-on"
"flighted ball on off stump, clipped with the turn through square leg"
"that's almost over the roof. Tossed up wide of off, but it isn't wide enough to make Pollard reach for the ball. All it does it give him ample room to free his arms and launch a monster hit over long-on"
"this one's hit flatter, over long-off, and it's just as clean. Flatter delivery on off stump, and he gets his front leg out of the way to drill it inside-out"
"length ball on off stump, swiped along the ground to long-on"
"back of a length, slanting away from off stump, punched to deep point"
"short, angling into Pooran's chest, and he swivels to pull powerfully, beating the leftward dive of the man at deep backward square leg"
"back of a length, nips back in a little to cramp Pooran for room. Blocked back towards the bowler"
"slower ball close to off stump. Fails to pick the change of pace, goes down on his knee and looks to sweep, swings too early and is hit on the stomach"
"slower ball, back of a length, not far outside off. Swings too early through his pull, and the ball sneaks past his bat and bounces again before reaching the keeper"
"back of a length, fourth-stump line, opens his bat face and stabs to backward point"
"flat length ball on leg stump, punched back to the bowler"
"got him. Brave call to bowl Simi at Pollard, but it's paid off. Both these balls seem to have straightened off the pitch, and replays show this one - and probably the first ball too - was a legbreak. A skiddy, back-of-a-length legbreak straightening from leg stump, and Pollard is a little unbalanced as he tries to get his front leg out of the way and launch it over long-on. Ends up skewing it high off the outer half of the bat, and long-on moves a few steps to his left and takes a good catch"
"shortish on off stump, makes room to carve to deep point"
"back of a length on off stump, punched to long-off"
"full on off stump. Gets forward, moves his front leg away from the line, and defends gently to the right of extra-cover to pick up one"
"back of a length on off stump, makes a bit of room and punches past the diving extra-cover fielder to long-off"
"and here's Rutherford. Short ball at the hips, and he's just swivelled and whipped this up and over deep backward square leg"
"shortish on leg stump, pulled along the ground to long leg"
"and it's a slower one too, full and slanting away from off stump. Looks to drive with an angled bat through cover, can't connect"
"full on leg stump, clipped to the left of long-on"
"back of a length on off and middle, goes back and clips towards deep midwicket"
"fullish on the pads, clipped to deep square leg"
"tossed up wide of off stump, driven along the ground to the right of long-off"
"full, in the blockhole wide of off. Looks to slog over the on side, can't connect"
"once again that wide-ish line, driven to long-off once again"
"this is great control from Dockrell. Pooran skips across just before he delivers, and he shifts his line slightly wider still. Not full enough to drive, and the ball bounces past his edge"
"beaten once more from that wide line. Looks to drive through the covers but he doesn't read the pace or the length well, ends up grabbing at the ball"
"and again, beaten three times in a row! He's just bowling regulation left-arm spin wide of off stump, and Pooran can't get bat to ball, while trying to muscle it over the covers. It's what pressure does"
"make that 37 off 17. Full, slanting away from off stump, and Rutherford clears his front leg and launches that over the wide long-off boundary"
"wow. How. That's a short ball angling away from him. It's about chest high, and in the attempt to reach it and pull over midwicket, he ends up meeting it well in front of his body, and the bottom hand comes off the handle. Even so, he times it so well that it sails easily over the rope"
"full, slanting into a wide line outside off, driven past the extra-cover fielder diving to his right"
"shot. This has been a struggle of an innings, but Pooran finds an important boundary here. Jumps across his stumps, expecting the wide line, and gets it. It's fullish, not quite a half-volley, and he flat-bats it over the head of the leaping extra-cover fielder"
"wow. This is a length ball wide of off stump, and he jumps across again, and gets down low to slog-sweep straight back down the ground, high over the non-striker's head"
"it's all coming apart for Ireland. High full-toss wide of off stump - not sure how high - and Pooran slaps it away to find the gap between deep point and deep backward point. Third man was inside the circle, and the line was deliberate, but the length was surely not"
"full on leg stump, almost a yorker. Looks to flick, closes his bat face early, and the ball rolls into the covers off the leading edge"
"shortish on leg stump, here's another late twist. Opens up for a half-sweep, half-pull, but he hits it in the air and too close to the man at deep backward square leg"
"full outside off, driven firmly but too close to extra-cover"
"length ball outside off, driven firmly again, on the up, but straight to extra-cover once more"
"shortish slower ball outside off, whip-pulled in typical DJB fashion to deep square leg"
"full on off stump, driven along the ground, hard, to long-off, and Rutherford keeps the strike"
"The field was set for a wide line, but he bowls this fairly close to off stump, back of a length. It wasn't necessarily a great delivery, but Rutherford didn't quite middle his leg-side slog. Clears his front leg, connects only halfway cleanly, and long-on, moving to his left, takes a fairly straightforward catch"
"wow. Length ball, angling  into off stump, and he barely moves. Just stands there, keeps a steady base, and half-pulls, half-whips over the midwicket boundary. Incredible shot under pressure"
"goes full now, on middle and leg, driven firmly towards long-on, along the ground, and they were always going to run the second, just to keep Bravo on strike. Stirling's throw to the keeper's end was pretty decent, but Little can't collect cleanly, and a run-out is missed with Walsh quite a bit out of his crease"
"back of a length, shuffles across to flick and misses. Hits his thigh pad and rolls into the square leg region, but he declines the leg-bye"
"Back of a length, angling into off stump, and Little has got his man! Bravo looks to whip over deep midwicket, hits it reasonably well, but not well enough, and Delany takes the catch a few yards in front of the rope"
"is this a wicket? Does it matter? It's full, angling in and close to off stump, and Walsh has a big slog across the line but he can't find the desired connection, and the ball is past his bat and into the keeper's gloves, low. Josh Little has done just enough in the last over, and Ireland have held on for a narrow, yet massive win"
