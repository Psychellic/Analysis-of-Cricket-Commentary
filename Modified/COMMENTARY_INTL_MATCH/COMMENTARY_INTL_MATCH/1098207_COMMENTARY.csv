"appeal for leg before, Gaffaney says not out and India have asked for a review. Front foot is fine. Nicely flighted and dips extremely late. Hope gets down for a sweep but is done in by the last-minute dip. Lands just in front of the pad, sneaks from beneath the willow as the batsman misses the sweep and spins in. Looks pretty close, he could be gone here. No bat involved, certainly. Hitting middle and leg, so the on-field call will be reversed"
"good length ball, pitching outside leg, moves outside the line and tucks it to square leg"
"fuller, on middle, gets down and sweeps to square leg"
huge appeal for leg before and turned down.Could it have been too high? They get together for amid-pitch conference and decide against the review. Not full enough to be sweeping and Holder gets down nonetheless. On a length and gets up slightly to beat the bat and hit him on the pad.Height definitely a factor there

"length on middle and leg, turned away towards backward square leg"
appeal for lbw and given by umpire Gaffaney. Seemed pretty high at first glance and Carter does not opt for the review. Gets down for a sweep but it's a length ball and hits him quite high. Comes on straight so no question of it being outside the trajectory of the stumps. But height seemed a bit close as it hit him high
