"inswinger from Bhuvneshwar, on a good length, Roy flicks and falls over. He wears it on the pad but this is heading down the leg side. Sharp first over from Bhuvneshwar"
"floats it full outside off, Shaw mistimes an off drive to long on. Thick inside edge on that"

"steps out, doesn't get to the pitch but goes through and manages to absolutely blast this wide of Shakib. <strong>Mid-on had no chance</strong>"
swept fiercely but straight to square leg

"<b> another ball, another inside edge </b> and Pant is involved in a run out again. This rolled just wide of the keeper, Iyer was more than halfway down the pitch when he had to turn back. By that time, Goswami had lobbed the ball to Sandeep, who broke the bails at the bowler's end."

"short and sliding in, Pant swivels back and wallops this pull to the fine leg boundary"
dabs this gently into the off side for a quick single

"beaten! Picked the googly, looked to run it down but is beaten by sharp turn"
"<b> comedy of errors. </b> Another mix-up with Rishabh Pant. Harshal Patel is three quarters of the way down the pitch for the second, but the throw from deep midwicket is fumbled by Shreevats, but he recovers quickly to get to the ball and then comes up with an underarm flick to beat Harshal's dive. Surely someone's got to have a word with Pant about his running, very very poor. <b> Fourth time now that Pant is involved in a run out this season.</b> He's run his partner out on three of those occasions"

"high and super handsome. Rashid goes full and Pant was waiting for it, muscled over the bowler's head, deep into the long-off boundary. This is some hitting."
works this with the spin to deep square leg
"cleverly works this down to long on, they hare back for the second. Very risky, you have to say. <strong>Thankfully a positive response from Pant</strong>"
"leading edge to backward point, <strong>loud call of noooooooooo from Maxwell</strong>"
caught in a tangle as he looks to work that googly. Spun back in sharply to hit the thigh pad

"angles it full and wide, Pant can't reach out. Wide called, however. Bhuvi is frustrated at that call, asks the umpire furiously why he called it a wide. Correct call, I have to say"

"full toss, smacked towards deep cover where Shakib throws in a dive to cut that off"
"full, wide and just inside the wide line this time. Pant reaches out to beat point but can't lay bat to it"

"time for Maxwell to join the show. Waist-high full toss, and he flat-bats this straight over the bowler's head. No chance for long on and long off."
belts this full toss to sweeper cover
slices this slog to long off. Hales makes no mistake. Wonder if this was a little too ambitious from Maxwell? Was he better off giving strike to Pant? Looked to go straight but got no timing.
the scoop over short third man. Gives you the impression he's going leg side but then spots the full and wide delivery and at the last moment opens the bat face to hit this up and over
"another scoop, another one that beats short third man. He's toying with the bowlers now. Excellent awareness, knows exactly where Bhuvi will go. Full and wide outside off, brings out that back flick. Wow"
"pulled into the fine leg boundary. Bhuvi does short, this didn't have much pace so Pant picked the length early and helped it along"
"<strong>one-handed six over long-on.</strong> He can walk on water tonight? Bhuvi shortens his length, Pant holds his shape and then wallops this"

"slightly slow in the mid-120s, just around off and he blocks it back"

"another short ball, this time towards leg and he knows fine leg is in. Waits for it and pulls it to the long leg boundary for four more"
"in the block hole, <strong>that's plumb</strong>! What a reply from Harshal. Hales went back and across early to cover the stumps and steer it to the leg side, and Harshal sends down a slow offcutter with some revs, Hales misjudges the pace completely and is trapped right in front"

"he loses his line with that slower one, it's gone well outside off"

"similar to the first delivery, with flight and turn outside off. Williamson connects the drive this time and gets one to long off"
"he charges down to take it on the full and drills it back along the ground, absolutely straight and gets four. That makes it eight from the over, Mishra won't be happy"

"lofted over the covers as he gets some room, two more in the gap"
"that angle is not working either! Too full outside off, Williamson shows his class by driving that nice and square for four more. Spectacular batting"
"<b>almost run out</b>! He tapped the ball to point and hesitated for a fraction of a second before responding for the single. Iyer went for a direct hit from point but missed it, Williamson had given up on the attempt to make it"
