"full toss, waist-high, de Kock does well to get bat on it but that's going to be a <b>free hit</b>"

"back of a length, he swivells and whips it powerfully through the area backward of square leg"
"length ball, he guides it towards midwicket and they press for two here, good running"
worked towards mid-on but they'll settle for just one this time
and that's a <b>free hit!</b> Stokes over-stepped and is called.
"that was interesting. It was going way outside off, he steps across his wicket, swings but fails to connect"
"full, outisde off, he dabs to extra cover and they set off"
"outside -off line, the batsman can't do anything with that, and it sails through to the keeper"
"defended to the off-side, Jordan looking to contain the batsmen here"
"back of a length, he give that an almighty heave over deep midwicket, great timing, great power ... no containment there"
"yorker ball, it sails past leg stump"
fuller ball and he cracks it back over the bowlers head towards long-on  but there's a fielder running in to cut it off
"outside off, looked sharp but only 84mph / 136kph, a swing and a miss as Buttler collects behind the stumps"
"back of a length, another slower one, another swing, another miss, it goes over the stumps to the keeper"
"full toss, on middle, hammered towards the sweeper on the off side"
"full toss, straight and he's sent that <b>down the throat of Ben Stokes at mid-off!</b>"
"outside off, he thumps it hard back into the ground and it bounces towards mid-off"
"back of a length, he steps across his stumps and guides it towards the covers"
"wow, <b>beautiful death bowling from Jordan!</b> Very full, he tempts Pretorious into a hearty swing, he misses and the ball uproots off-stump!"
"what?! <b>And another!</b> Full, moving slightly away onto off-stump, and the woodwork is pegged back again. <b>Jordan on a hat-trick!</b>"
"full, on middle stump, Steyn, facing his first ball in international cricket for nearly a year, he calmly guide it fine of squre leg and it's going <b>all the way</b>"
driven with poise towards cover. Like he hasn't been away
worked back towards the bowler in defence
"yorker, on middle stump, he sends it back to the bowler, and Steyn is off. Jordan gathers and effects <b>the run-out</b> at the non-striker's end. Phehlukwayo is out on the last ball of the innings"
"on the back foot, jabbed down to third man, Roy is off the mark"
"back of a length, tight line, that's at 137kph/84mph. Tucked to midwicket and both men are off the mark"
"rising from just back of a length, a solid stab to mid-on. Steyn nudges up to 87mph ... that purring rhythm through the crease is all in good working order"
"wider line and <B>that's sublime</B>. A block-drive through point, just an open face and effortless timing. Clean through the gap"
"width again, and <B>that's a nonsensical pick-up from outside off!</B> Shuffling outside the line of off, spring-loaded wrists, pumped through midwicket!"
"a flat-batted flog into the covers, a superb dive to intercept, and Roy is put off by the deflection to the other fielder. Buttler has to rush back ... and makes it"
"angling into the hips from wide on the crease, clipped with the angle behind square"
"tapped to cover, and looking for the single. Deceived by the slower ball"
"back of a length, slower ball, and pace off is proving useful already. 74mph as Buttler can't pierce the offside ring"
"wider line, Buttler flings his hands at the ball but can't connect outside off. Slightly quicker at 82mph but not bending his back..."
"slow again, Buttler this time is equal to it with a whip through the leg side, using the angle into the pads"
"<B>utterly powered through midwicket!</B> Just a touch too short at that pace, no subtlety at 82mph, and flame-grilled for four!"
Roy shuffles across the pitch to tuck another single to midwicket
"<B>toe-ended to wide mid-off, and it's Steyn 1 Buttler 0!</B> Back of a length from Steyn, Buttler was drawn into the launch over the covers, but he couldn't connect properly, and with that Steyn draws level at the top of South Africa's T20I wickets list!"
"<B>that's one hell of a slower ball!</B> A dipping offcutter, looped so high above the eyeline that Bairstow was braced for the beamer. But then the motor switched off, 74mph, dips at the toes, and all he could do was dig it out and grin!"
probed cautiously into the covers
"flicked to the leg side, tight line once more outside off"
"leg-sided, and flicked behind square for four. Just a touch off-centre from Steyn, and he pays the price"
pushed into the covers from round the wicket
"<B>hammered with the spin, is that going to be out ... no!</B> A wild swipe, Miller on the long-on rope back-pedals, catches, flings as he topples into the rope, and flings it over his own head for six!"
"<B>dumped inside-out</B>, over long-on!"
"<B>high and mighty, clean into the commentary box balcony!</B> That's in the slot and slotted!"
"<B>crashed with murderous intent, over long-on!</B> Off the bottom of the bat maybe, but that's straight enough to elude Miller, for a one-bounce four"
"back of a length, Roy slides into his crease, taps with a calculated lack of power to the leg side, and sprints back for two"
"<strong>a wide outswinger</strong>, can't bowl there, even if you're a legend! The sort of ball that Greg Chappell might have dragged onto his stumps from Ian Botham. Bairstow, on the other hand, rifles through point!"
"too wide once more, and slammed behind point! <B>Width will travel tonight!</B>"
"tighter line, fuller length, a respectful block"
"back of a length, Bairstow pirouettes into a pull but the ball sneaks under his intentions"
"another cheeky late-dipping slower ball, but Bairstow is equal to this one, tucking it to leg"
"slow again, outside off, worked to the leg side. England are cooking nicely now"
"<B>Howitzered over the sightscreen!</B> Out comes the driver, Happy Gilmoured over the bowler's head!"
"fuller length, a touch wider, pushed to the off side"
"<strong>clipped with pace, through the leg side!</strong> 87mph on that occasion, and Roy just places bat on ball, eases it through the diving midwicket"
"slower ball, well watched with a jab of the hands to midwicket"
"back of a length, tapped to point, a scampered single and the throw from Pretorius gets stuck in transition."
"slower ball, back of a length, Roy rocks back for the pull but the ball barely arrives. Hauled round the corner. and that's the end of the Powerplay"
"width on a full length, pumped with an urgent drive to long-off"
"slower ball, outside off, chopped to deep point, urgent calls for the second and Bairstow is so quick. It's a brilliant throw, right over the bails, and QDK whips them off... the umpires take a look, but that's fine"
"short-arm pull out to deep midwicket, that's travelling hard, but straight to the fielder"
"back of a length, flashed to backward point, another instant call for the single"
"slower ball, very tight angle into the stumps, defended to cover. Another single. Decent bowling but England are content to tick over for now"
"<B>pounded behind square, down on one knee!</B> Roy picks the lack of pace, seizes on the angle into his legs, and flogs it for yet another boundary. He's on one today!"
"twirled onto a good length, from over the wicket, flat-batted out to midwicket"
"<B>reverses the hands, a top-edge over the keeper!</B> Sweeping with intent, but can't middle that one"
"back of a length, a measured clip to square leg"
"on the pads, tapped to midwicket, this has been tight work, a very teasing length, neither one thing nor the other"
"Bairstow gives himself room, but ends up reaching for the ball with an under-edged mow to backward square. Probing..."
"<B>dragged down, and battered!</B> Roy's fifty comes up from 22 balls, and helps to dent an otherwise fine Shamsi over. Give him an inch, and he'll pummel you a mile!"
"width, cut down into the crease, and a skitter to the non-striker's end"
"turned inside out, and poked to point"
"half a shout for lbw, but nothing much doing as Bairstow runs for the deflection"
"slower ball outside off, crashed with intent to extra cover, but straight at the man"
"<B>thumps the back leg, and up goes the finger!</B> It looked leg-sided, but he was a long way back... probably clipping leg at worst... England opt not to review... Jonny might regret that when he gets back to the dressing room. But it's a timely breakthrough. EDIT: Bairstow's was <I>just </I> clipping... the verdict would have stood regardless"

chopped out to point
"nudged into the off side, this time there is a single on offer"
"sharp turn from outside leg, to follow Roy as he made room to cut. Thumps the pad in front of a fifth set of stumps"

"turn once more, away from a late cut from Morgan who almost topples across his stumps in his eagerness to reach it"
"tidy finish, flicked down to mid-on, and that's just three runs off the over"
"punched into the covers, Roy is interested in the second but nope, not this time"
"slower ball, outside off, pounded with a big followthrough out to extra cover"
"cracked into the covers, calm accumulation, even if SA are 12 ahead on the comparison"
"into position for the scoop, doesn't pull it off, but gets enough of a deflection behind square to scamper the single"
"<B>flashed past Bavuma at backward point!</B> Short and wide, and slammed in the air... if there's any pair of hands likely to hold onto that, it's Bavuma, if there's any frame on the field unlikely to reach that, it's Bavuma... excellent hang-time all the same!"
"banged in short, down the leg side,<B> helped on its way!</B> That'll settle the skipper after a sluggish start..."
"excellently placed into the gap at wide mid-on, eased with the angle for two more runs"

pressed with a full face to mid-on
"shuffling at the crease, slapped hard to cover"

"tight line to the body, flashed behind point with a cramped cut"
"too full, width outside off, Roy pummels that with steel-sprung wrists through the slenderest of gaps at midwicket"
"slower ball again, that sat up for the pull, but died under the stroke at 77mph"
"full once more, a bottom-handed pump into the covers, another single to the cause"
"slower ball, that dipping full-lengther, at 65mph, which is barely fast enough to stay airborne. Morgan is wise to it, and pushed to cover. That's Steyn done. He had his moments, but was collared when it mattered"
"outside off, big leftie's leggie. Beats the leftie's cut"
"pushed into the covers, rotating the strike"
"<B>crashes into the pad, a huge appeal!</B> Shamsi wants this but QDK rightly reckons that's leg-sided. Beaten by flight and dip once more though. Canny bowling, he stuttered in his run-up to throw Roy off his trigger movement"
flicked to the leg side
"big wind-up for the mow to leg, can't connect"
"back of a length, and <B>pumped through wide long-on!</B> Wrists and timing from Morgan, right back on his stumps and manipulating the leg-side field. A duff note to finish a fine spell from Shamsi"
"banged in short, <B>exoceted through midwicket!</B> A rusty half-tracker to get his juices flowing. Unfortunately, Roy's have been flowing for 14 overs already!"
"<B>round the wicket, a monstrously telegraphed slower ball!</B> That was such a caricature dismissal, Roy had time to flap that ball in four or five different directions, instead he chose a toe-end to short fine leg! A fine innings, and ignominious end!"
"open-faced flash through third man, can't argue with that"
"short and tight to the body, Morgan bails out of a pull. Only 83mph, but the line was excellent, rising from over the wicket"

"round the wicket, wide line, cut down to backward point"
"back of a length, 112kph, Stokes can't do much with that as he takes a moment to find his range. If it works for Chris Gayle..."
"back of a length again, nudged along the turf to deep midwicket. We've got a grandstand finish coming up!"
"over the wicket, shaping into the legs, an excellent pick-up cuts off the second run"
"short and wide, Morgan waits and waits on a 65mph back-of-the-hander, and<strong> belts it with a flat bat over long-off!</strong>"
"banged in short, chasing the left-hander with the angle into the body, as he limbos out of line"
"fuller length, straighter line, chipped on the up to long-off"
"pulled round the corner, so nearly scutters past fine leg, but just too much bat on the stroke"
"short, hauled over the leg side, <B>that's found the gap at fine leg!</B> A flurry of bat, sufficient connection, and England are on the move again"

"reverses the hands for a pull to backward point, into position early  but couldn't quite nail the angle"
"hauled to the leg side, picked up from outside off"
"<B>slapped to wide long-on, and Stokes is gone!</B> Ngidi lands the big fish with a very cunning slower ball, 115kph, offcutter, on a very wide line, forcing Stokes to fetch it and he can't connect properly!"
"back of a length, outside off, another cramped cut to point. Just the single. This is a pivotal over if he can finish it off..."
"enough width to free the hands, but the sweeper is set back at deep point and limits the damage to a couple. South Africa steal a march ..."
"right up to the toes, clipped to long-on. Just the single. England need something and quickly..."
"in the blockhole, Moeen pounds a drive to long-on ... well bowled again. The rate is over two a ball now..."
"<strong>too short, put away behind square! </strong>There's the hugely needed boundary! Dragged down, and Morgan bisects the fielders behind square"
"<B>Morgan pounds the drive!</B> That's a huge strike, and completely turns the tables. Attempted yorker, misses the slot, flogged through the covers!"
"<B>full again, pace on this time, pelted over deep cover for six!</B> Wow, Morgan rushes to a 32-ball fifty, and has broken this game in two!"
"<B>holes out to wide long-on, but is it too late?</B> Morgan curses, he didn't need the big shot, but was lured by the full length... cripes,<strong> that's close to a no-ball,</strong> but I think he's okay... Just!"
"on the legs, flicked with intent behind square, and they hustle back for the second. An important two to steady the nerves..."
"<B>in the slot, Curran takes on the midwicket fence, but the wind, the wind!</B> That's gone high, high, high into the floodlights, but sticks in the breeze, and plops into Miller's hands in front of the scoreboard! Ngidi flings his hands high... he's still got a chance to be the hero!"
"<B>offcutter, and dribbles past a wild swing to leg!</B> A priceless dot! It's 5 from 3!"
"the cheeky quicker ball, Moeen is beaten on the flick to leg, but it's worked out well for him, he's got no pace on his whip, and that's dribbled slowly enough for them to come back for two. But <B>de Kock reviews!</B> Was that adjacent, nope, inside edge onto the knee-roll"
"<strong>bowled him!</strong> A pinpoint off-stump yorker! Moeen plays all round it! The ball dips beneath his loose wafty nothing stroke, in fact he turned it<I> into </I>a yorker with a gallop to the pitch. He hadn't bargained on the offcutter, which perhaps he should have seen coming. And now it's all on Rashid!"
"inside-edged drive, into the leg-side ... it's one run, can it be two for the Super Over? <B>No, it can't!</B> The shy comes in, Rashid is dead in the water, and Lungi Ngidi's offcutter pays rich dividends! South Africa defend seven off the final over, <B>to win by one run!</B>"
