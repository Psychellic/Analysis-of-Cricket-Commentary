"Rohit opens the face to knock a length ball outside off to the right of short cover, towards mid-off"

"shorter and outside off, punched firmly to Morgan"
"dug in shorter and angling into off, Kohli swivels on the back foot and controls a hook to deep square leg"

"slower and loopier outside off, driven down to long-on off the front foot"
"<strong>another wrong'un from Rashid, 118.6ks, thumps the front pad</strong>, rushing Rohit for pace. Not given out lbw, England challenge the on-field not-out decision. Rohit is a bit late to bring his bat down, misses it altogether, and is struck below the knee-roll, but this is sliding down leg. Umpire Chaudhary gets it right"

"<strong>Rashid pounds it into a hard length</strong> outside off, Kohli goes back and forces it down to long-on"

"short of a length and slanting down the leg side, Kohli, having shuffled across off, can't touch it. Leg-side wide"
"pitched up and outside off, driven so straight that it hits the stumps at the non-striker's end. They take a single thanks to the ricochet"

"Wood slams the hard length once again, 147ks outside off, crunnnnnnnched straight to point"
"147ks back-of-a-length delivery outside off, Wood seems to have just one gear, forced on the up between point and covers. <b>India have aced the powerplay in the decider: 60 for 0</b>"

"another slower ball, on a length and outside off, <strong>only 106ks</strong>, Rohit is early into a drive and spoons it just wide of short cover"
"<strong>slower ball, slower ball, yorker.</strong> Jordan cranks it up to 141ks, and hits the blockhole. Rohit does well to keep it out"
"Jordan takes pace off the ball once again, 106.8ks, shortish and outside off, Rohit delays the cut and slashes it late through point"

"slower bouncer outside off, hauled away through square leg. Kohli can't get on top of it and pull it away"
"<strong>Wood's evening gets worse. He misjudges a skier running back</strong> - and then around - from short third man. Should Buttler have gone for this? In the end, Wood doesn't even get his fingertips to it. Top-edged in the air and over short third man"
"<strong>dumped over backward square leg to raise a 30-ball half-century</strong>. Rohit shuffles across and picks it away in nonchalant fashion. He moved outside leg, Curran followed him, but no problem for Rohit"

"<strong>swatted away over Rashid with more force</strong>. Length ball on middle, Suryakumar ventures across off, goes low, and lifts it away over short fine leg once again"
Jordan cranks it up to 140ks and <em>just</em> misses the yorker. But it's still a hard-to-hit low full-toss. Suryakumar opens the bat-face and <strong>squirts it away between point and short third man</strong>. There's no stopping Suryakumar. Sensational batting

"back of a length and skidding into middle and leg, forced to deep midwicket"
"<strong>It needed something special to stop Suryakumar, and it is Jordan who conjures it up</strong>. The soft signal is out - and it will stay out. CJ sprints to his right from long-on,  plucks the ball out of thin air with his right hand. But then again realises that the momentum will propel him beyond the boundary. He has the presence of mind to toss it back to deep midwicket running to his left before going out of play. Good awareness from Roy as well although he can't quite believe what has happened. Belting tag-team work in the outfield. CJ: one of the best fielders in the world"

"wide of the crease, banged in short and angling into the body, flapped away weakly into the leg side"
Kohli shuffles across and clips a double through square leg to <strong>bring up his 28th T20I fifty</strong> and third this series. He raises his bat and soaks in the applause from the Indian dugout
"back of a length and slanting into off and middle, seems like a slower offcutter, worked away to the right of midwicket"
"Wood goes wide of the crease. Lets rip a 142ks short ball outside off. Pandya aims to haul it over midwicket, instead he sends a top-edge flying past Buttler. Stokes has his hands on his head, summing up the mood in the England camp"
"pumped away to the long-off fence. Dug in short and outside off, Pandya camps so deep in the crease again. Splices it over Stokes running back from the infield. He slides, but can't pull the ball back into play"

back of a length and skidding in at 141.3ks to thump the pad as Kohli can't put it away. But it's surely heading down leg
"looks like a short legcutter outside off, Pandya manages to flap it away to Roy's right at long-on"
"shortish and a hint of width outside off, Pandya frees his arms and smashes it tennis-style between mid-off and cover. Flat-batted away with immense authority. It is Pandya who is whipping up magic at the death today"

"Kohli pre-meditates a reverse-sweep...and misses. Back of a length and outside off, actually flicked back to the keeper off the glove"
"four men in the deep on the leg side, but Kohli still finds a gap. Shortish offcutter, finishes on the hips, pulled away between fine leg and deep square leg. Expertly done"
"banged in short, Kohli dashes out of the crease. He doesn't quite middle the pull this time, but hauls it away between fine leg and deep square leg again"
"yorker, speared into leg stump at 147ks, squirted away through midwicket. It has been a rough evening for Wood. He <strong>ends with 4-0-53-0</strong>"
"shortish and angling into the hips at 139ks, Pandya picks it up and launches a pull over backward square leg six"
"back of a length and outside off, 143.4ks, Pandya pulls and clears the midwicket boundary this time. He sits deep in the crease, opens up his hips, and slugs it away. Kohli enjoys all of this from the other end"
"back of a length and outside off, Pandya hangs back in the crease again. Flayed through the line to sweeper cover"
Kohli backs a long way outside leg. Jordan digs it on a back of a length and shifts his line well wide of off. Kohli can't reach out and touch it
"Jordan searches for the wide yorker, but misses his length again. Fullish and outside off, Kohli opens the bat-face and carves a four between point and third man"

"very full on middle at 145ks, shovelled away to the right of long-on"
"back of a length on leg, 111ks, slower variation following the batsman who was moving away to the leg side. Flashed away to sweeper cover, YJB slides to his left in the outfield but he seems to be in contact with the rope while aiming to flick it back into play"
"legcutter, short and slow, Kohli is way too early into a hook as he cops a glancing blow on his body and gets across for a leg bye. Okay, the umpire reckons he has nicked it"
"back of a length outside off, punched crisply to point"
"<b>stumps clattered</b>. England had to go hard at the start and Roy's not connected with this. Down the track to swat it over midwicket, but Bhuvneshwar has kept it on a length, swinging in from outside off. Too close to Roy for that shot, he can't connect. The ball crashes into the stumps."
"rapped on the pads and Bhuvneshwar's interested, but the umpire not so much. They won't take a review. Swinging into the left-hander, pitched on middle and Malan was moving a long way across. Struck in front but perhaps going over the stumps. Replays confirm that would have gone just over the stumps"
"tapped to cover, length ball outside off"
"brings it into the left-hander again, this time from off, and he's jabbed that to cover"
"length outside off, cut to third man"

"back of a length but strays down leg, far enough from leg stump even though Malan was moving across. Wide."
"swatted with authority to the deep midwicket boundary. Hardik tried the slower bouncer, it just sat up for Malan to rock back and pull powerfully"
"<b>clears the man at deep square leg</b>. Hardik executes the quicker bouncer well, gets it to rise sharply and to the helmet. Malan swivels and hooks, doesn't get it off the middle but meaty enough to clear Shardul Thakur there."
"and this one is hit with much more surety. Another short ball by Hardik, and Malan pulls to the deep backward square leg fence. The short balls not working out for Hardik so far in this over."
"goes fuller now and Malan was expecting that, flicked off his pads through square leg"
"another bouncer to finish - but it's down leg again so it won't be the finish for the over. Square leg umpire indicates it's wide and it's the right call, well above the batsman"
"full swinging away from him outside off, goes down on a knee to cover drive but doesn't connect."
length outside off and punched to cover. That's the first ball Buttler's faced
"back of a length outside off, pulled it back because Buttler was walking down the track. He ends up without enough space to do anything other than jab it to mid-off"
"back of a length outside off, pushed to extra cover and they take a quick single"
"good length nipping across him from leg stump, tucked to midwicket"
<b>lovely</b>. Full outside off and he leans into an absolutely peachy looking cover drive that has left all fielders standing. Beautifully timed and placed
length ball on leg stump and it's tickled fine off the pads. Pant puts in a dive to his right but can't get there so a good end to the over from England
clips - and smartly at that - a fullish delivery on middle and leg to deep midwicket
pushes it through from around the wicket and Malan is able to work it off his pads through midwicket
<b>smoked it</b>! There are so many shots in his locker and every one of them looks pristine. For this one - a length ball in line with the stumps - he charges out and pumps it down the ground
<b>breathtaking power!</b>. Sundar is trying to cramp the right-hander. But Buttler and his footwork trump him. Moves outside leg stump - way outside - and launches it over cover with aplomb. Bottom hand and forearm power to the max!
"shifts around the wicket for a spear into the pads, Buttler turns it through midwicket"
another academic nudge through the leg side to keep the strike
<b>magnificent</b>! He's given the ball of his dreams. A long hop with width. The only thing missing is the bow on top. And Buttler rocks back and pulls it to smithereens.
"back of a length and outside off, he cuts into the covers"
straying in line and Malan is able to dink it away to the fine leg boundary. Thakur hasn't got his radar right now that the left-hander got back on strike
"shortish and outside off, dabs to deep third man"
"wide slower ball, Buttler, who likes staying leg side, is only able to bunt it off the bottom of the bat to cover"
"<b>caaaaaattch it!</b> is the cry but the slice off Buttler's bat, as he looks to thump a full ball on off stump over cover, falls well short of the sweeper behind square on the off side"
"back of a length and slanting into middle and leg at 135ks, Malan hangs back and blocks it towards short midwicket"

"dragged down and spinning into middle and leg, Malan jumps back and pulls it along the ground to deep square leg"
"Buttler takes on Chahar and thrashes him over long-on for six. He dashes out of the crease, Chahar pulls his length back, the batsman didn't get close enough to the pitch, but manufactures enough power to clear the fence"
"Chahar responds with a 96ks wrong'un, even fuller, and skidding in to beat the advancing Buttler and hit his pad"
"on a length and turning into the pads, Malan dinks it towards midwicket and gets across to the other end"
"skidding into the pads from an <strong>angular run-up</strong>, something that Chahar often does in the IPL. Buttler can't put it away"
Chahar goes shorter and wider of of. This legbreak spins away from Buttler. But he still manages to muscle it over long-off for six

"length-ball offcutter from Pandya, Malan aims to run it down to third man, but is <strong>beaten on the outside edge</strong>"

"overpitched and outside off as Natarajan misses his yorker, Malan moves forward and drills it away to the left of extra-cover and right of wide long-off. Malan is repaying the faith shown in him by Morgan & co."

"Buttler moves a long way outside the leg stump, Chahar chases him with a flat dart. Buttler swings to the leg side...and misses. <b>Pant thinks Buttler has tickled it behind to him</b>. Neat, low take from Pant. But did Buttler really snick this? Replays indicate that it brushed the pad on the way to Pant. It pitched way outside leg, taking lbw out of the equation"
"Buttler backs a long way outside leg again, Chahar follows him with another short, flat dart. Swatted to deep midwicket as <strong>Buttler notches up a half-century of his own</strong>, off 30 balls"
