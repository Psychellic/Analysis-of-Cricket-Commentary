length ball. He's trying to cramp Fakhar for room. Thick inside edge to fine leg gets Multan underway
"lovely shape. He's pitch it on a length and seam, swing and bounce beat Sohail all ends up. He dabs at it, but ultimately he'll be grateful he's not good enough to get near that"
hanging his bat out at one that starts wide and moves wider. Very close to the outside edge once more
"carries straight through, strikes him on the pads. excellent start from the bowler"
keeps the strike with a fudged single. Multan have begun brightly
"short of a length, pushes Sohail back, driven back to the bowler"
"this really is ordinary batting. No footwork, and he tried to loft it over the top. Nowhere near the middle of the bat, just dropped short of an onrushing mid-off fielder"
"similar shot, really, no movement again, but that's flat-batted over the bowler's head. The connection is clean on this occasion, and <strong>he picks up four</strong>"
"short and wide, brilliant work from Afridi and third man to keep it down to one. That was racing like [deep Ravi Shastri voice] a tracer bullet"
"back of a length, punched to deep point"
opens the face and driven to extra cover
good-looking leave. Bit of a collector's item. Just opened his arms up and watched it go by. How quaint
"angling back in, Fakhar can only take a single through the offside"
"strays down legside. Sounded like there might have been pad on that, but the umpire disagrees"
"opens the face and guides to short third, and the pair scramble thorugh"
"driven back to the bowler, who collects and knocks Fakhar's stumps back with a direct hit. The opener's hurried back though"
"wide and full, and it gets the treatment it deserves. They bring the point fielder in, and that's just an invitation for Fakhar to smash it through the infield and pick up an easy four. Sohail lets out a cry of anguish"
full and wide again. Opened the face of the bat and angled it to deep point. Third man was square enough to come around and cut it off
tucks him up nicely first up. Bowls from slightly wider of the crease
"and that's the end of the captain's innings. Strode across and looked to chip him over midwicket, but the Rossouw stationed there had the easiest catch after Sohail's miscue. Multan pick up the first wicket"
confident stride out to mid-off
solid forward defence once more
nudged into the offside. <strong>Brathwaite on track for a wicket maiden in his first over</strong>
"and he does! What an outstanding start this is for Multan. At this rate, <strong>Lahore are on track for the lowest PP score this PSL</strong>"
"clears the front leg and tries to hit a home run. It's strike one, instead"
"excellent line. Aside from those two balls where Fakhar had width, he's managed just one run in eight balls. I know that's unfairly selective, but this is a plan that's worked so far"
"<strong>and the strategy brings a wicket. Excellent bowling from Dahani</strong>. Multan continued to cramp him for room, and while Fakhar tried to punch that through the offside, he only manages a faint edge to the keeper"
gets off the mark with a nurdle to backward point
backfoot punch through the offside. Denly still to get off the mark
"gets a single to open his account. Just one over left in the PP, and Lahore are going at under four an over"

"leaps out, so the West Indian pulls his length back. No timing on the pull"
"length delivery again, and Hafeez squeezes it to mid-on for one"
"poked to Dahani at short fine; he is standing really, really fine"
"gets it away, finally. Steps out and across and squeezes it past fine leg for a much needed boundary"
"takes the pace off and Denly can't find the bat. <strong>This is the lowest score for Lahore Qalandars in a Powerplay in PSL history</strong>. Yes, even worse than when they were dismissed for 59 a few years ago"

flatter delivery that Afridi nudges to short third

a single down the ground

"swing and a miss. Multan felt the pull made contact with something, but it wasn't the bat"

poked into the offside
"more flight, driven back to the bowler"
nudged into the onside and the pair get a single
"<strong>You wanted Denly to tee off and tee off he does</strong>! Dances down the ground and had to reach for it, but gets enough bottom hand on the short to clear extra cover."
"googly, Denly cuts it away for a single"
driven down the ground for one
""
"short and wide and gets the treatment it deserves. Sliced away to point, where the deep fielder can't cut it off"
"<strong>this time he upgrades to a six</strong>. Set himself, planted one knee on the ground, read the googly and cleared - just, mind you - cow corner. Lahore getting some momentum now"
nudged away to fine leg
swing and a miss. A bit too much spin and Denly's shot strikes thin air
long hop. Lucky that he isn't punished with a four
"good length ball on fourth stump, backs away to cut through cover to the sweeper."
"short and wide at 89 kph, late cuts this to backward point and sets off for a run, but Denly isn't interested so Hafeez has to scamper back to beat the relay to the keeper."
"short and wide, diving stop on the ring by Brathwaite at point but he's a big unit and takes awhile to get back onto his feet, allowing Denly to come through for a run."
"short and wide again, cuts this to the sweeper."

"Dahani continues the short ball method of attack, bangs it in on middle stump at 142 kph, Denly cramped for the pull shot and flicks this one-handed looping gently over square leg."
"<strong>elegant way to bring up a half-century!</strong> In the slot on fifth stump, Hafeez winds up and strikes this cleanly over long-off, sailing 25 yards over the rope. If he was on a golf course, he'd be shouting 'Fore!' But inside the 22 yards that's Siiiiiiiiiix! <strong>50 up off 27 balls. </strong>"

"full and wide, beaten trying to punch this down the ground."
"shuffles well outside off, goes to heave a length ball over the leg side and is beaten again."
"Denly's stubbornness to slog for down the ground brings about his downfall. Brathwaite kept on sucking him wider outside off, bowls this on a fullish length on about eighth stump, Denly reaches out a long way for a mighty swipe but only manages to edge this behind to the keeper."

"full and wide, swings over the top of this."
"<strong>instead of a slam-dunk, Dunk is slammed!</strong> Full and wide, tempts Dunk into the drive but doesn't pick the googly and spins away to produce a thick edge looping over backward point.

"full on off, driven in the air down the ground for one."
"<strong>chaos! Samit had to sacrifice himself but instead Hafeez is left stewing as he walks off. </strong> Short ball outside off, chops this into the covers. In the 17th over, Hafeez was in run on contact mode. Samit is taking a long time to get the wheels turning in his innings and after tapping that ball into the off side, did take a few steps down the pitch before ball-watching got the better of him. Hafeez was almost at the striker's end before trying to turn back. Samit really should have just fallen on his sword but instead steps back into his crease as the relay from Brathwaite to Qadir is done without panic and he whips the bails off. Horrendous sequence to lose the incredibly devastating Hafeez in his current form."

"another picture perfect yorker at 147 kph on off stump, jammed out but trickles to the keeper."
"in the slot on fifth stump, gets the yorker length wrong for the first time and Samit makes him pay swatting this flat over long-off."
"<strong>dropped! Ghastly effort by Sohail Khan at deep third man!</strong> Short ball outside off, Samit went to uppercut this but it's basically catching practice for Sohail placed perfectly on the boundary. He gets overexcited charging in too much though and snatches at this with very hard hands at head height, it clangs off and goes over his head bouncing once over the rope. Dreadful. That was 3/10 on difficulty but Sohail struggled like a clubbie on that effort."

"swinging back into middle stump, Lynn defends to mid-off. Sweetly timed, mind you"
"<strong>he's got him!</strong>This is perfect bowling. The ideal yorker, the kind you only bowl in your dreams, but he's done Lynn with one. Wobbling in the air, pitching on middle, seaming away to knock back the off stump. Shaheen celebrates, and Lahore have made the perfect start"

"<strong>that's so good from Rizwan, and that's his half-century off 27 balls.</strong> What a cricketer he is. Slower delivery tailing down the leg side, and he waits for it to come to him, and uppercuts it over the keeper's head for four"
"<strong>beamer</strong>. Rizwan did well to work it into the onside and still scampered back for two, Instant apology from Daniyal, that could have been really nasty if it struck his fingers or ribs"

Came at a moderate pace, but he was very very lethargic moving a few steps left. 2/10 on difficulty but he got into a bind having to reach far across his body instead of getting into a more centered position.

"good length ball on middle, defended back to the bowler."
