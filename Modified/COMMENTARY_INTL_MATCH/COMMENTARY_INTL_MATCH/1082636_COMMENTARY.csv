"first ball duck for Gayle, Umesh has struck and the crowd is making plenty of noise, I don't know why! Movement off the pitch for Umesh as he pitches it on good length around middle, Gayle looks to defend it with soft hands but the ball moves away and a leading edge lobs like a balloon to short cover"
"142kph, nice outswing from outside the off stump, he lets it go"
"moves it away nicely again from good length outside off, he leaves again"
"129kph, bangs it in now for back of length and much straighter towards off, Kohli waits and tucks it to midwicket"
"137kph, just outside off and no movement, Kohli stays back again and punches it down to mid on"
"stays a bit low as Umesh goes wider outside off, Kohli runs it to third man to get off the mark"
"not much room outside off, looked like a legcutter on good length, Kohli defends towards point for a quick single"
"accurate stuff on the off stump, much fuller, and Mandeep defends towards cover"
"touch shorter around off, pushed down to mid on off the back foot"
"angling in towards middle now, Mandeep waits and defends it on off"
"makes room and chips the short ball over the point region for a one-bounce four. The crowd loves it. Whether he anticipated a short ball or not, he adjusted well to loft it high and beat the fielders"
"full ball to follow the short ball, Mandeep stays still and slams it straight down the ground for the first six! It was a half-volley, he didn't have to do much apart from connecting it from the middle with good timing."
some extra bounce outside off surprises Kohli a bit as he defends it to off
"shortish and angling in, he pivots on the back foot and pulls it late well behind square to dispatch it for four. He's looking in really good touch"
"on length outside off, hint of room and he runs it down to third man"
"<strong>dropped at mid-off</strong> off a full toss by Piyush Chawla! It was a slow, low and dipping full toss from Umesh, Kohli wanted to clear mid off but didn't time it rightly. Chawla ran back, jumped to get his hands to the ball well over his head bu the ball bounced off and he couldn't get it on second attempt too"
"Piyush is smiling, he sticks his tongue out because Umesh's change of pace has beaten Kohli again, struck on the back foot and he's plumb! From the back of the hand, it pitches in front of the stumps and Kohli is already through with his shot when the ball reaches him, he was looking to whip it to leg, and was struck on the back leg in front of middle and leg"
"waits for the good-length ball on the back foot and defends it on off, no time for a run"
angling in a bit and Mandeep clips it to leg for one easily
"comes in a little bit, he tucks it behind square on the leg side for one"
"really good short ball, no room, AB waits to get some bat around head height ad nearly gloves it to the keeper. Woakes banged in the bouncer, it came in with the angle and stifled AB for room"
"comes in towards the batsman again, wants to put it away to leg but takes it on the pad"
comes down the pitch and runs the ball wide of third man with soft hands and he comes back in time for the second
"advances down again, this is a short ball and he pulls it away from the middle of the bat, wide of deep midwicket for four. Was looking like a good over from Woakes again but his last ball spoils it"
he leans forward into the ball to negate the spin and helps it to leg with the turn
"makes plenty of room early, ball turns in and he cuts it dangerously to point"
"shuffles across the other side this time, Narine pitches it wide outside off and AB lofts it over the cover-point region in the vacant area"
"shuffles across again, misses it completely and the stumps are gone! Narine keeps his cool to bowl an offspinner in front of off and middle, AB is a long way across, tries to sweep but it's pretty full and he doesn't connect at all"
"not much turn outside off, Head defends tentatively into the off side"
"there's an <b>appeal for a stumping</b>. Narine turned it away from the batsman, who looked to drive and missed, Jackson whipped the bails off immediately but Head's back toe never left the crease"
"pretty full outside off, driven firmly into off by Mandeep"
"tries the slower one again, compromises on the accuracy and it's a wide down leg"
"comes down to slam it, it's back of length and he gets an inner edge to the keeper after the bounce"
"144kph, full on the stumps, Mandeep drives it down to long on easily"
"on good length outside off, he stays back and punches it to cover"
"too full on the pads with the angle and he clips it away nicely, wide of deep square leg for a four in the gap"
"really slow ball at 104kph, looked even slower though, it's very short too. Head waits a lifetime on the back foot and then cuts it to point"
"loops it nicely around off, Mandeep drives it down to mid on"
"direct hit and Mandeep was gone! Head tucked the ball to the leg side against the turn, wide of deep midwicket, and they come back for the second. A sharp throw fired in but doesn't hits the stumps"
"around good length on leg, he whips it to leg against the turn for one"
"pretty tight line on off stump, he defends it back"
"short and flat outside off, sees a poor delivery and cashes in by cutting it nicely wide of point for four"
"much fuller and tighter now, leans forward to drive it down to long off"
"starts with a full delivery into the pads, it's clipped away for one"
"pretty wide outside off and angling away further, Head wants to slam it to leg but misses"
"slower one at 118kph, it's pretty full and driven straight down to hit the stumps at the other end, the ball ricochets off for one run towards mid off"
"just short of length delivery angling in, helped to deep midwicket for one more"
"tries the back of length short ball, it's a bit too short and worked to long leg for one"
"pretty tight now on off stump, Mandeep defends nicely from the middle and sets off for one"
"slightly short, not too much, Mandeep looks to get under and pull but mistimes it to long on"
"nicely flighted around off stump, driven down to long on easily"
"flighted and full again on off, worked against the spin to leg for one"
"slower through the air around off and middle, pushed down to long on with the spin"
"shorter and a tad quicker at 90kph, wide outside off, and steered to sweeper cover"
"no turn, going away with the angle outside off, and Head mistimes it to cover"
"nice and tight towards the off stump, Mandeep defends it back"
"touch more towards the leg stump, Mandeep tucks it square of the wicket to leg for one"
"142kph, good pace to angle it away well outside off, keeps a bit low, Head swings and misses"
"much fuller and closer to off, driven firmly down to mid off for a quick single"
brings it into the batsman who helps it behind square for one
"<b>loud appeal</b> for lbw from Ankit, looks like he was struck in front but it might have pitched outside leg. Good length ball headed towards the stumps, Head wanted to whip it to leg but missed before scampering for a leg bye. Replays confirm it pitched outside and the angle would have made it miss off stump too"
"nicely flighted but towards leg, pretty slow and he waits to help it to leg"
"much shorter, giving Mandeep the time to pull it with a cross bat to wide long on"
"some room outside off, he cuts fiercely off the back foot to sweeper cover"
"some flight and drift, it's pretty full, and driven down to long on"
"turns in from middle stump, keeps a bit low, Head goes back and works it square"
tad shorter outside off and it's short enough for Head to go back and cut it on the off side
"short and slightly wide, Mandeep gets room and cuts but straight to point"
"takes a step or two down to make some room, the ball angles into him but he drives to mid off for a quick single"
"slower ball at 117kph, pretty wide outside off, making it out of Head's reach as it cuts awa. Head swings and misses"
"wants to pull the back of length ball to leg, but he mistimes it and gets one with a bottom edge"
"nice offcutter from Rajpoot, nips in towards the stumps and Mandeep directs it towards point for one"
"short ball, Head knows where the gap is and he pulls it late behind square leg for four"
"good length ball outside off stump, gives him the charge, makes too much room and ends up bunting this into the cover region"
"back of a length outside off, doesn't climb at all, pulled off the toe to deep midwicket"
"back of a length at off stump, makes room and cuts it straight to backward point"
"back of a length at middle stump, gets behind the line and flicks it to deep square"
"some width, and he hammers this length ball on the up, to sweeper's left"
"back of a length outside off, looks to swat across the line, once again misses the connection on the angled bat. It's dragged to long-on"
"an offspinner outside the leg stump, Head defends carefully to leg for one"
"appeal for run out. It was turning in from off stump, Mandeep attempts a slog to the leg side but doesn't middle it and wants to come back for the second. The slightly inaccurate throw from de Grandhomme helped Mandeep as he put in a dive before Jackson deflected the ball to the stumps"
"turning in from just outside off, Mandeep cuts to extra cover"
"pitched up, Head slams it to his favoured leg side and he clears deep midwicket. Nearly a half volley and was about to turn away but he connected well and swung hard"
"hint of room, it's slightly shorter and Head cuts for one"
"clips the ball from around off to leg with the spin and soft hands, no time for the second"
"fairly innocuous medium pace just outside off, Mandeep cleverly makes some room and opens the face late to direct it wide of backward point in the gap"
"pushed towards mid off, Gambhir throws it back in a hurry"
"pitched up slightly, not as quick and Mandeep drives towards Gambhir again and manages a single this time"
"104kph, hardly any pace on the ball which means Head's pull lands once before Yusuf at deep midwicket"
tucks the ball from middle stump towards deep midwicket and they come back for the second for <b>Mandeep's fifty</b>. At least some hope for RCB
"doesn't nip in as much as he expects, it's slowish too and a thick outside edge goes towards point"
"slog swept with the turn and Umesh times his jump to perfection at deep backward square leg to pouch that. It was pitched up slightly, Mandeep made some room and then swept in the air, Umesh went a bit to his left and then jumped to take it around head height"
"turning away from middle and leg, worked to leg for one"
"pretty full on middle, pushed down tentatively to long on"
"short and flat around off, cross-bats it towards wide long on"
"sharp turn into the batsman, Jadhav as a habit of not using his feet and is cramped for room, manages some bat on it just in time"
"not as vicious, but there's turn again, Jadhav doesn't move his feet again and wants to cut but is struck on the pad"
"131kph, starts with a cutter well outside off, Head still pulls it towards square leg for one"
"133kph, bangs in the short ball, Jadhav doesn't connect with the pull at all and the ball deflects off his right shoulder towards the keeper. Jackson dives to his right"
"wants to slam it away, misitmes it slightly to long on for one"
"full and wide, it's a low full toss and Head steers it straight to backward point"
"looks like a cutter at 115kph, it was wide outside off again, an inner edge from Head gets them one"
"finally Jadhav connects nicely and finds the gap too. Woakes had been taking the pace off the ball, Jadhav waits on the back foot for the shortish ball and then pulls it late to beat deep backward square leg for four"
"starts with a yorker well outside off, Head chases and misses"
"sees a good length ball at 125kmh, he swings big but manages only an edge onto his shoe for a single"
"shuffles back and across in the crease, pulls the short of length ball to deep midwicket"
"slow offcutter at 120kph, in the block hole, Head digs it out to long off"
"puts in some pace now - 132kph - it's still hard to time the ball properly, Jadhav finds long on with his flat-bat pull"
"too full on the pads, Head is pretty strong on the leg side and he lofts that nicely with a big swing over the wide long-on boundary for a clean six"
"it's full, wide and quick at 139kph, Jadhav lofts that high and Umesh runs to his left from long off to pouch it. It's been tough to time the ball properly today and Jadhav's eyes properly lit up seeing some pace on he ball, he sent that a bit too high though, giving long off enough time"
"slower at 119kph, full and wide, Head swings outside off to drive along the ground and Chawla is quick in the deep to keep it to one"
"not much room, Negi still cuts it away for one to get off the mark"
"tries a wide yorker, it's a bit too wide and called a wide"
"full and closer to stumps now, driven down pretty straight but long off cuts it off and they come back for two for <strong>Head's fifty</strong>"
"gets a full delivery again, this one at 135kph outside off and he slams it down the ground, over long off for a big one"
"swings hard again, doesn't connect with the full delivery well this time and gets an inside edge to short fine leg. Keeps strike"
"full on middle stump, dangerous territory to Head, but he keeps it along the ground and sends that to deep midwicket"
"full and wide outside off for Negi, he connects well to find the gap and it's a big, wide gap. Chawla runs to his right from long off but can't even get close to it"
"slow cutter at 121kph, fullish again outside off, Negi swings and sends that really high not far from the pitch, Lynn calls for it and pouches it around short cover"
"don't pitch it up to him on middle or leg, Head has dispatched it really high and so far from the pitch, it nearly hits the roof. He's strong on the leg side and sent it exactly there, over long on"
"slightly slower, pitched up again and this time it's gone over long off, almost a straight six. Head is connecting really well now and middling all of those. The big swings are working now"
"almost finishes off with a four. It was a really slow delivery, pretty short too, Head swivelled on the back foot, waited for some time and then pulled it away behind square for a four after a couple of bounces"
"good length, swinging in at off stump, poked into the off side with no feet"
"shot. Fractionally wide outside off, no movement this time and he throws his hands at this length ball, punches it firmly in front of sweeper cover on this little ground"
"smoked. Full and just outside off stump, clears the front leg and thumps it to the left of mid-off"
"he's back, folks! Back of a length at off stump, makes room and swings at this, sends it way over the long-on boundary. A hundred metres!"
"the offcutter, full at middle stump, gets the front foot out of the way again and drives to mid-off"
"good ball. Offcutter, slightly outside off at a length, he's through the shot early and gets an inside edge past the stumps and to short fine"
"full at off stump, driven nicely after reaching the pitch, but Kohli stops at extra cover with a dive to his left"
"back of a length outside off, goes past the outside edge as he pokes away from the body"
"<b>outside edge clears short third man</b>. Gives the charge and looks to hit this on the up over long-off, but he's not to the pitch and it turns away from him. Get's the outside edge and has Aniket interested briefly, albeit awkwardly. In the end, his jump is not sufficient"
"back of a length at off stump, punched off the back foot to long-on"
"good length, keeps low at middle stump, flicked to square leg"
"short and just outside off stump, the cut shot is stopped by point, diving to his left"

"back of a length at off stump, skids through nicely, backs away and slaps it through the covers"
"good length at middle stump, defended back to the bowler"

"back of a length at off stump, punched to covers off the back foot"
"short outside off, back quickly to spank this past extra cover"
"ohhhh naaaaice! Googly, tossed up at off stump, half a stride, sufficiently leg side of it, golf-swing to lift this over the long-off boundary"
"and another! Tossed up at off stump, same shape, same connection, same boundary - another one over the long-off region"
"<b>and another!</b> Another repeat! Narine is top dog in this Caribbean spin battle - with his bat! Another googly at off stump, this time it's flatter from Narine, but just as clean. Clears long-off once more"
"a woeful ball, short and down the leg side, swivels and lifts this over short fine"
"good length at off stump, tries to drive through the line, gets it off the bottom as this spins away from him. It goes past mid-off, but long-on comes around the stop it"
"good length at middle stump, hangs deep and pushes it to deep midwicket"
"full outside off, looks to climb into this but he can't connect. Toe-ends it, but gets it over the infield, over extra cover, mid-off cleans up"
"oh dear. Surely you know by now not to bowl him there? Good length, outside off stump, clears the front leg and bludgeons this on the up, flat over mid-off"
"back of a length outside off stump this time, he goes back, not across, and then improvises the pull shot to slap it past mid-off"
"remove the stumps, give up, and go home. This is a full toss at middle stump now and Narine slogs it over midwicket"
"bowls an offcutter, it's at a length and it just about goes past the wide marker"
"good length, well past the wide marker this time. Narine walked across and heaved at this, missed by a long way"
"<b>Narine has the fastest IPL fifty!</b> He's done it. In Gayle's home ground. Good length at off stump, stands tall and lifts this over the long-on boundary on the up"
ridiculous. A full toss outside off. Narine's hit better balls than this for four <strike>in his life</strike> today. Frees his arms and uses his wrists to lift if over the covers
"this is classy. Tossed up at middle stump, steps out, gets to the pitch, contorts to get leg side of it and lifts it inside-out over long-off"
"short ball outside off stump, makes away, slaps it over cover point"
"full ball at leg stump, steps out, doesn't quite have the room, so he ends up dragging this past square leg, deep midwicket runs to his right"

"back of a length at middle stump, backs away and gets the cut off the sticker, it lands in front of cover point"
"<b>the highest Powerplay score in IPL history.</b> Good length at middle stump, backs away slightly but is down quickly on one knee to nail this slog sweep, over the square leg boundary"
"ah, that's why. Bouncer first up, just outside off stump. Too good for Narine, who is cramped by pace and line as he looks to hook, gets a top edge that Jadhav pouches with a leap"
"back of a length, angling away outside off stump, beaten on the outside edge as he cuts"
"short ball, wide outside off stump, misses out on the cut again, beaten"
"and again. Ultimate moral victory for Aniket. It's the only one he'll get tonight. Beats the bat thrice, again outside off as he looks to punch this away from the body"
"offcutter, back of a length outside off, cuts it this time, but straight to backward point"
"beats him again. This would've been wide if Grandhomme had stayed back. As it turned out, he gave it the charge and looked to slash through the off side, only to be beaten by angle"
"good length at off stump. <b>Doesn't hit it for six.</b> Incredible. Instead, goes forward, dabs it into the off side and brings up his <b>fifty</b>"
"tossed up at off stump, driven firmly to long-off, who was slightly wide"
"and that's the end. Arm ball doesn't rise from back of a length, skids through and into middle-n-leg as Lynn is tall while attempting to pull this"

"back of a length at middle stump, stays deep in the crease and taps it to long-on"

"short ball at leg stump, swivels and manages to pull this, aerially. But it lands on the bounce in front of fine leg"

"googly, short and just outside off stump, cuts it to sweeper cover"

"back of a length at middle stump, punched to long-on off the back foot"
"back of a length at off stump, chopped into the off side with an open face...of course"
"shot. This is very short ball outside off stump, but Grandhomme steps out and goes through with the shot. It's a pull, flat over the midwicket boundary"

"good length at middle stump, steps out, doesn't get to the pitch, chips it to long-on"
"short and wide outside off, cut nicely past point....oh and superb diving effort to his left, Mandeep at sweeper cover. Stops the ball nicely but he lands his ribs on top of the ball as it is stuck under him. Clutches his chest immediately and as a result, the ball rolls into the rope"
"good length at off stump, forward defence"
"arm ball at middle stump, it has no business going to backward point's left. But that's where he has managed to squeeze it. Chahal gives chase and pulls it back with a slide"

"full and down the leg side, steps out and flicks it to long leg's left"
"back of a length at off, flicks against the turn in the direction of long-on...Negi pulls off an exquisite dive to his left and flicks it back quickly. Gambhir would've been caught short with a direct hit"
"good length at off stump, looks to sweep, inside edge onto boot"
"back of a length at middle stump, misses the flick, it thuds his pads and rolls into the leg side....and Gambhir is nearly run out at the strikers this time. Throw doesn't hit"

"good length at middle stump, drags a mistimed sweep to deep midwicket"
"good length, arm ball at middle stump, whipped off the back foot to midwicket"
"oh good ball. Very good ball. Good length, drifting in at off stump, but also dipping fast. He's down the pitch and realises soon he won't get bat on this. Offers a flick across the line anyway, but it spins past him and the keeper makes no mistake"

"tossed up full at middle stump, gets his front leg out of the way and squeezes it out to mid-on"
"good length outside off stump, teases him in for the slog sweep, then turns it away rapidly past his outside edge"
"good length outside off stump, wide. There's a <b>loud</b> noise as Pathan pokes at this off the back and Jadhav takes it. Umpire says not out. Replays show a huge under-edge. Everyone, angry."
"good length at off stump, forward defence into the off side"
"teases him outside off again, he goes for the sweep again, he misses again. But this spins past the wide marker"
"and once more. Good length, pitching outside off, he throws the sweep at it and misses as it turns away"
"there you go. Gets behind this good length ball at off stump, pokes it through the gap at covers and completes a crushing victory for KKR on what is otherwise his home ground"
