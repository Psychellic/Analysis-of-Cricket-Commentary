"loosener down legside to start with, wide ball. Swung a fair way down too"
"gets it fuller and outside off now, thick inside edge to cover off an attempted flat drive"
"oooh, nice. Slanting it across him and the angle takes it away, defeats an ambitious drive. Not so far from the outside edge that one"
"good length on the stumps, nudged through square leg and he's off the mark"
"good length in the channel, left alone"
stump to stump on a length defended back with a straight bat
"and slips in the yorker, but the batsman does well to jam his bat down in time. Swung in late too, into the blockhole"
"nice looking shot to greet Topley, transfers weight on the front foot and leans into the off-drive to find the first boundary of the innings"
"pulls the length back and gets it on the leg stump, bunted towards cover"
"<b>gorgeous</b> Driven through extra cover for a beautiful four. Slightly overpitched, and Stirling gets a nice stride out to drive it"
"this time he opens the face of the bat rather more to beat point to his left, carving the ball to third man"
"better length and gets some movement across the batsman too, beats the outside edge. Feet rooted in place as he attempted to punch on the up"
"fuller on the stumps, defended solidly"
"slants it wide of Stirling, who has a go at the drive from around the 7th stump, gets an inside edge to midwicket"
"and mixing it up nicely, this one had the length pulled back from the full one and was on middle and leg, ends up tucking him up as he tries to clip it square"
"down the track, but Willey perhaps spotted him and the batsman ends up almost yorking himself outside legstump. The ball trickles into the gully region"
"lovely line and length, kissing the offstump almost, and whistles past the outside edge of his defensive prod"
"slightly wider outside off, left alone"
"not giving him any room, on leg and middle and he jams it towards mid-off"
"length outside off, driven to cover"
"length outside off and travelling further away, he shoulders arms to it"
"<b>beaten</b>. Off-cutter perhaps, jags away from a length to beat the outside edge as he was coming forward to defend it"
"slightly back of a length, pushes him on the back foot and he defends towards point with an angled bat"
"back of a length on off, goes back in his crease and taps it down softly towards point"
back of a length angling away from him outside off and left alone. Good comeback by Topley. <b>Maiden over</b>
"superb lines by Willey, consistently beating the bat outside off, upright seam that pitches on middle and moves slightly across to be within touching distance of the outside edge"
"a bit fuller, he mis-times his drive to mid-off"
"length on leg stump, tucked to midwicket"
"<b>got him with the one that nips back</b> Willey has given England an early breakthrough again, that looked pretty close and they decide not to review. Good call too, because that was smashing into middle. Length ball that jags in and beats the inside edge as he plays an uncertain push and is rapped in front."
"back of a length outside off, punched through mid-off to get off the mark"
"lovely delivery to end, snakes past the outside edge from a length outside off"
"length outside off, tapped to cover off the back foot"
"fuller outside off, fluid drive on the front foot but straight to point"
"pulls the length back a wee bit, and gets it to move across the right-hander to defeat his attempted punch"
"length on middle and leg, pushed through midwicket"
"another one that goes past the outside edge, jags away after pitching on middle and Stirling is left with bat hanging trying to punch"
this time the line is more leg stump so he's able to go back and tap it through square
"<b>brilliant catch by Banton at backward point</b> Stirling has been frustrated outside off by Willey, sees one enticingly wide and full and has a go at it, but the ball's moving away and he ends up with a sliced outside edge. Banton flings himself to his left and plucks the ball in the air. Superb."
"length on leg stump, tries to flick it off his pads but doesn't connect"
"fuller and wider, again entices a drive but the batsman connects with air only"
"slants it wide of off stump again, but left alone this time"
"fuller on off stump this time and driven smoothly from the crease, but straight to cover"
"strays on the pads and is flicked fine, to a diving short fine leg's left. He's off the mark in international cricket"
"back of a length on leg stump, raps him on the thigh pad as he tries to punch to mid-off"
"fuller, opens the face to drive, but can't beat backward point"
"good length outside off and moving away a touch, left alone"
"fuller on off, taps it gently on the front foot to mid-off. Hit softly enough to steal a single and more importantly, the batsmen were alive to the possibility of a single and ran through quickly"
"full outside off and hint of swing away, once again a batsman is beaten on the drive to that line and length."
"fuller on the stumps, driven to mid-on"
"<b>beauty</b> Beats him on the inside edge this time, because the batsman thought it'll be another one that moves away. Leaves him split in half"
"fullish outside off, driven to mid-off"
"fuller outside off, he was already moving forward and gets to the pitch of the ball to tap it softly into the covers and get a quick single"
"another one goes past. Hits the seam and moves away, past the outside edge as he's shaping to play it straight back"
"fuller on the stumps, driven firmly to mid-off"
jags away sharply form a fullish length on off to finish well wide of off. Shouldered arms
"fullish on the stumps, blocked back down the pitch"
"fullish on the pads, flicked but straight to midwicket."
"fuller again, driven back but not timed well. Topley fields it to his right"
"length outside off, cuts from close to his body to point"
finally gets one into the gap. Nice confident stride to drive between cover and extra cover.
"full on the stumps, drives it to mid-on"
"whoa what was that. Wide ball way down the legside. Might have been wide for a right-handed batsman too, so far down"
"<b>shot</b>. Full ball on the stumps, he leans into the drive and times it beautifully straight back down the ground. The most confident shot hit off Willey today"
"length ball on the stumps, jams it back to the bowler"
"full on the stumps, driven very straight again, mid-on has to run around to his left to collect it"
"good length, comes on the front foot and taps a drive between cover and a wide mid-off"
"yorker on off stump, blocked"
"full on the stumps, shows the full face of the bat to drive to mid-on"
"fuller, stroked to cover"
"length outside off, he moves across and uses wrists to flick to midwicket"
"length spinning into him from just outside off, tapped to midwicket"
"length more outside off, steered towards point"
"good length and spinning a bit from outside off, defended"
<b>nails the sweep beautifully</b>. Had to fetch it a tad outside off but the length was right for the shot and Balbirnie used his long arms to good effect to send it crashing into the square leg fence
"too full and straying on the pads, flicked to fine leg's left where Adil Rashid does the fielding."
"better line, outside off, still a bit full and driven straight but gently enough for the bowler to field"
punches on the up from outside off but can't beat cover
"back of a length, nice carry from Vince, gets up to rib height. But easily enough negotiated to third man"
"back of a length on a sixth stump line, left alone"
"fuller on off, pushed to short cover"
goes back and across and flicks this off his pads to deep midwicket
"sweeps it fine, full enough to do it and not wide enough outside off. Nicely executed"
"quicker outside off, chopped back to the bowler"
"length outside off, tries to steer it fine but Roy at slip dives to his right and stops it on the bounce"
"length ball, played it back to the bowler"
"fuller, clipped to long-on"
"fuller, clipped to square leg"
<b>James Vince has his first international wicket!</b> Balbirnie will be filthy with himself for this. Was banged in short well outside off. Balbirnie thought about cutting it then thought he'd leave it alone but that decision came too late and the ball pings off the toe-end of the bat into the Bairstow's gloves.
"length outside off, punched to cover"
driven to cover off the back foot
"fuller, check-drives it to mid-off"
"too short, rocks back and pulls to deep midwicket, who has to run to his left to field. Billings the man"
"oooh, beaten first up. Pitches outside off and he's expecting it to spin a lot more than it does, goes past his inside edge"
taps this to mid-on and they take a quick single
"tossed up on the stumps, he stays legside of the ball and drives to cover"
"fuller, tapped to mid-on's left and another quick single. Direct hit from the fielder but KOB was in"
"fuller, driven to deep cover"
"<b>googly goes through him</b>. Completely foxed. Nice loop and on a perfect length, drawing him on the front foot. KOB was looking to push what he thought was a legspinner into the offside, left a gap consequently and the wrong 'un whizzed through it and onto the stumps."
"angled bat, leaning forward on the off stump. Vince is having more fun in an international than, well, since he was well set at Brisbane all those years ago..."
patted into the covers and they jog through the single
"big stride, on the off stump again, firm shout of 'no!' as Vince presses away with a well-presented seam"
"<B>nibble and bounce!</B> That's a very fine delivery, rising past a tentative edge through to the keeper"
"cautiously patted out to point, just back of a length"
"full length, tight line, absolutely nothing wrong with that delivery. He's in danger of earning himself another here!"
"<strong>clattered off the umpire's head!</strong> A glancing blow as David Milns ducks, and that is properly travelling, all the way to the rope. He's fine.. on we go..."
"firmly into line, and solidly blocked"
"huge appeal, but sliding past the leg stump as Tector plays for the wrong'un but underestimates it"
"blocked on the back foot, into the off side"
"blotted into the leg side, tight lines at an aggressive pace"
"inside-edged defence into the leg side, finds the gap for the second run"
"firm in defence, on the front foot and into the covers"
"short, urgently pulled around the corner, but straight to Rashid on the backward square rope"
"flogged in the air, but safe, several feet over the head of short midwicket as Ireland try to up the ante against England's surprise weapon"
"full toss, down the leg side, I think Vince's surprise factor may have elapsed now..."
"slower ball, outside off, jabbed down into the gully but a poor throw means the run is safe enough"
"fenced down to third man once more, an open face to steer the wider line"
"<B>mown through the line!</B> And with that, I suspect Vince's day with the ball is done. A planted front foot, a wild wallop, more height than distance, but there's no-one back there, right behind the bowler"
whirring onto a good length and blocked
"wrong'un, not entirely read, jammed into the leg side for the single"
"legbreak, drawing Tucker onto the front foot to defend"
"zipped through a touch sharper, on a leg stump line, flinched to the on-side"
"another googly, dragged from outside off with a full arc of the bat, to mid-on"
"another wrong'un to finish, blocked on the front foot, head over the ball to defend"
"full length, decent wheels, thumped to cover"
"patted out to the off side, head over the ball"
"open face once more, steered out to backward point"
"that's a sharp bouncer, sizzling over the batsman's head as he flinches in his stance"
"driven offf a full length, out to mid-off"
"nurdled to the on-side, another sharp single to the cause"
"head over the ball, a planted front foot in defence"
"lots of air, a firm drive into the covers and an even firmer 'no!'"
"squeezing the line on middle and off, bat and pad thrust forward in cagey defence"
"pushed onto the back foot by the leggie, blocked on middle and off"
"cracked hard past a diving Vince in the covers, can't claw it in as they snaffle the single"
"lots of flight and bite on the legspinner to finish, defended in a kneeling stance on off stump"
poked into the covers once more
"tight line and a very full length, short midwicket gathers"
"banged in short, but leg-sided, a well-placed pull, very fine behind square, rolling the wrists to send it rattling to the rope"
"outside off, tapped to third man with an open face"
back of a length and blocked
on the front foot this time to finish off a tidy over
forward and blocked
"a cautious push into the covers, on the front foot"
"speared down the leg side, fenced to square leg for another single"
"cheeky bowling, dragging the batsman out of the crease with a teasing length, dipping and biting on the googly, and patted away"
"<B>plonked to mid-on.</B> And that was tame. 'Catch that ... get in...' deadpans Jonny Bairstow from behind the stumps. A woolly waft through the line, no placement, no elevation, no power. No ... nothing really"
"<B>Oof, nearly chops on first ball!</B> A fat inside edge on a half-cock drive, down to fine leg. Still, they all count"
"tight line and length, bursting past the edge. Well bowled..."
"firm in defence, on the front foot"
pressed into the covers
shoulders arms to a lifter outside off
outside-edged drive down to third man
"<B>edged and so nearly the sixth!</B> A blistering lifter outside off, took an involuntary splice, and Bairstow leapt like a salmon to his right, but there's no slip to do the delivery justice! A blot in Moeen's temporary captaincy copybook ..."
played off the pitch out to the off side
"aggressive full length, pushed back to the bowler"
"soft hands, blocking the legbreak into the off side"
"flogged to mid-off, but with no timing"
"googly, blocked on the front foot"
"a wafty drive on the front foot, can't connect properly, Rashid rushes through another set"
"rushing onto the bat, on the back foot, open-faced poke to the off side"
"firm in defence again, leaning forward to push back to the bowler"
"outside off, dangling the bat, and beaten on the inside edge. Good wheels from Mahmood..."
"pelted into the covers, and Morgan pounces beautifully. No issue with the skipper, now back on the field"
"uses the pace beautifully to thrash the wide line through backward point, lovely wristwork"
"shoulders arms with intent, almost Test-match in outlook"
"<B>that's abject batting!</B> Tucker telegraphed his intent with an early shimmy, Rashid responded by dragging his length back and firing it out wide, but he went through with the stroke all the same, a off-balance, hopeless heave of a sweep, and a steepling top-edge behind square. Ireland's slide isn't done yet..."
drawn forward and blocked
"off-stump line, leaning over the ball"
tucked to the on-side
"on the back foot, and stoutly blocked"
left alone with a very tightly judged non-shot. There are two types of leave...
pushed to the off side
"on the back foot, stabbed to backward point"
"leaning out of the crease, firm in defence"
"back-cut to deep point, a touch of width on offer"
"good areas from Moeen, outside off and biting hard into a back-foot steer"
"cracked hard to point with a wild scything cut, but well intercepted with a dive. Ireland are going nowhere fast right now"
"huge turn from a moon ball, plopping and biting"
"urgh... Rashid's over-complicating it in this over, a scuttler past the keeper. And a <B>free hit</B> coming up..."
"bouncer from Rashid! Or at least an energetic half-tracker! A fair enough delivery in the circumstances, flogged to cover"
"turned off the back foot, out past point"
"right up to the blockhole, chiselled to midwicket"
"on the back foot, waiting for the wrong'un, and blocked"
"crashed to midwicket, just about there for the shot, a round-house pull to a shorter ball, but too eager onto the shot"
"tucked to short cover, a good finish to a slightly wild over"
eased to mid-on
pushed back and across to defend the shorter ball
"full length on the legs, clipped to the on side"
"skidding through outside off, attempted cut but can't make contact"
"forward, pressed back to the bowler, off a good length and tight line"
"back of a length, straight enough, nurdled to long-on to keep the strike"
"flogged hard across the line, a slight misfield at midwicket gifts the single"
"swept hard, swept well. Miss that and it's plumb, but instead it whistles past backward square for a welcome boundary"
"<B>huge appeal!</B> This one skids straight on and raps the knee-roll... a touch high maybe, inside edge potentially..."
eased into the covers
"<B>massive appeal again!</B> So early on the sweep that the bat could have reached it on the followthrough. Thumped on the back leg, but was it outside the line? Umpire Milns reckons so, but England <B>review</B>. That was flattening off stump, surely... but yes, looks wide, and in fact going over too. Good decision"
"firm in defence, into the off side"
clobbered with lots of bottom hand into the covers. Well intercepted
"more bottom hand to the fore, flick-driven to long-on"
leaning down the pitch to defend
skidding onto a back-foot push to long-on
"on the back foot, pumped to extra cover"
"tucked off the hip, more compact strike rotation as Ireland continue their rebuild mission"
"lots of air outside off, flat-batted to point"
"back foot, blocked off the pitch as Rashid straightens it on off stump"
"<strong>big legbreak!</strong> Drift, dip, and huge bite past the outside edge. You'll do well to touch that"
"another leggie, more gentle through the air and off the pitch"
"<B>tossed up and pongo-ed through the line!</B> That's the way to treat the leggie, committing to the front foot, a big wipe through the line, Rashid leaps in vain to intercept"
chopped out to point off the back foot to complete Rashid's day
"a yawning cut to deep cover, a long chase and a one-handed stop on the boundary's edge from Vince"
"a roundhouse pull, on the back foot, and suddenly Campher is putting his foot down. Through midwicket this time"
"firm in defence, leaning onto the front foot"
"solid in defence again, no way through as Moeen probes on and around off stump"
"hurried on the back foot, on off stump again, skidding a touch lower"
a bottom-handed thump to mid-off
"length outside off, pushed to cover"
digs it in short but doesn't rise threateningly enough and Simi is able to get on the back foot and tap it behind square
"fuller on off, driven with force but straight to cover"
"full on off, tapped to cover and an early call of 'NO' for the quick single"
"short one, quicker this time and he goes for the hook but <s>gets a top edge</s> - it actually hit his helmet, and rather hard at that - and loops over the keeper and bounces to fine leg"
"back of a length outside off, nipping in a touch, punched through cover"
"length on off, goes back and pushes this to long-on"
"fuller on the stumps, goes on the front foot and turns it to midwicket"
"this time he takes it from outside off and flicks, but again can't go past midwicket"
goes right back and shows a straight bat in defence
"tossed up fuller, takes it almost on the full and drives to long-on"
stays back and cuts this from outside off to deep point
crunched off the back foot to deep point.
"short ball again, but he has enough time to rock back and pull through midwicket. Not very well timed though"
"<b>loud shout</b> but not given. England aren't reviewing. That one cut back in and caught the batsman by surprise, but clearly going down leg, hit him almost outside leg. Don't think he read the off-cutter and was playing all around it"
stays beside the ball and pushes it through point
"angling in again, and he didn't look like he read this one either but had taken a big stride forward and wears it on his pad"
"full outside off, driven hard into the ground but straight to cover"
"fuller, driven gently to long-on"
flatter and angling across him flat-batted drive to mid-off
"full and flat again, driven back straight, Moeen goes low to his left to field"
not able to get underneath the balls is Campher with Moeen keeping it flat. Driven back to the bowler
waits in his crease this time and tries to steer it fine but Bairstow is quickly across to prevent thoughts of a single
manages to push this between the bowler and mid-on to get that elusive single
"back of a length outside off, he has a waft at it but doesn't connect. Bairstow is appealing loudly, Saqib joins him late. And wait a minute, they've convinced Morgan to have a <b>review</b>. Daylight between bat and ball, and there's clearly no edge there. Dunno what Bairstow heard. Not out."
"back of a length outside off, takes the shoulder of the bat to third man"
"nicely done, length outside off and he nibbles it fine to the third man boundary. Feet were rooted to the spot but that was mostly intentionally done."
"on the stumps, turns this square"
"angling into him, tucks him up and he pushes it to the legside"
crisp looking drive but mid-off is able to cut it off to his left
"length on the stumps, paddle pulls this backward of square"
"floats up a yorker length ball on the stumps, which is patted back straight"
spotted him coming down the track and bowled it full and wide outside off. Simi had no option but to let it go
"back of a length on leg stump, hops and pats it down towards midwicket"
"full on the stumps, driven hard and there's a mis-field by short cover. But the ball goes to mid-off and there's no single"
back of a length outside off he goes to cut but the ball goes over the bat
"that's smartly done. Full straying down leg, and he tickled it very fine to find the fine-leg boundary"
"<b>edged it behind</b>. No doubt about that one. Back of a length outside off, and Simi was making room to glide it fine but it just took a feather - but an audible one - of a top edge for a straightforward catch to Bairstow. Important partnership for Ireland but it's ended now."
"full on the stumps, flicked to midwicket and they take the quick single but McBrine has to dive to make his crease. If Willey at mid-on had hit direct, the batsman was a goner"
"back of a length on off, bunted to mid-off. A bit too early into the shot"
"good length on the fourth stump, nicely cut to third man's right from close to his body"
"<b>brilliantly done</b>. Short outside off and he just upper-cuts it fine, cool as you please, finds the boundary."
"length ball on leg stump, worked it to square leg with soft hands. The man there is deep so they run well to pick up two"
<b>smacked</b> Short ball and he got stuck in to pull this very square. Billings is at the boundary but had come in and this was to his left. Ran for it but couldn't get there
"length on the stumps, steered to short third man for a quick single"
"full on off, nicely flicked to deep midwicket"
another ramp shot but by Campher this time. Short ball outside off and the Irish are quite adept at upper-cutting those. Bounces down to third man
"angling into him, he moves across and clips to fine leg"
"length outside off, cuts it hard to deep point"
strays on the pads and is turned to deep square leg
"past the outside edge. This was banged in a bit shorter and with more force, and it hissed up in the channel"
"another quick one, a bouncer this time and McBrine is late on the pull, misses it"
"fuller on the stumps, maybe he was hoping to catch him hanging on the back foot, but he comes half forward and flicks to fine leg"
"<b>inside edge goes past the stumps</b>. Slower ball and he was too early into his drive, but is fortunate that the ball misses the stumps and goes to fine leg"
"fires in a yorker from around the wicket, which he keeps out, nudging to midwicket"
"was backing away to give himself room but the bowler follows and ends up on the pads, tucked into the legside"
"<b>smoked</b>. Shimmies down and smacks this straight over the bowler's head, completely disdainful. Two bounces and into the straight boundary"
"length ball on the stumps, flicked off his hips to fine leg"
banged in short and it goes over the bat as he tries to pull.
"another short one outside off, but he flays this over point. No fielder there so it's safe. Not well timed so the man from deep cover has time to run around and cut it off"
"length on middle and leg, whipped to deep square"
"superbly bowled yorker, as he was going across, and all he can do is jam it into the ground back towards the bowler. Topley leaps up in his follow through and fields it"
"wide yorker this time, he stays in his crease and tries to flay it through the offside down on one knee, gets an inside edge that bounces onto his thigh pad"
<b>brilliant shot</b> and he raises <b>back to back fifties</b> against the World Champions. Goes low and scoops this from outside off to the backward square leg boundary
moves across and mows a drive to deep point this time
"quick bouncer to finish, outside off and defeats the attempted pull shot"
"<b>walloped</b>. Short ball, he goes deep and unleashes a fierce pull to square leg"
<b>magnificent</b> Almost read the bowler's mind there. Moved away to give himself room expecting the full one and he goes inside out over extra cover. Gorgeous shot
stays still this time and steers this length ball to third man
full outside off and he absolutely lays into that drive but straight to extra cover
<b>stunning</b>. Reverse scooped him to the third man fence. Third man had come up and he knew it and executed the shot to perfection.
"length straying on the pads, glanced to fine leg. Also raises 200 for Ireland."
"back of a length outside off, fetches a pull through midwicket. That's also the <b>fifty run partnership</b> and it's come in just 35 balls."
"giving himself room and lifts this over extra cover but it came off the toe end, so won't reach the boundary"
moves across and Topley bowls it back of a length on leg stump. The batsman misses the pull
"<b>through him</b>. Yorker length on leg stump, he was looking to whack that over midwicket but doesn't connect and the ball misses leg stump by an inch"
"slower bouncer, well disguised. He was too early into the shot, tried to adjust to tap the pull down but can't connect."
tapped into the legside where everyone is well back so they run a quick two to midwicket
gives himself room and square drives this full one outside off to deep cover
"bluff from the bowler with that field placing with an attempted wide yorker. A bit too full and he lashes it hard, but mid-off does well to tumble to his left and field"
"<b>caught at third man</b>. Full outside off and he has a big swipe at it, but it takes the leading edge and is swirling towards Adil Rashid, who does really well to come in and take it tumbling forward. End of a fabulous knock, and Campher now has an ODI average."
"going down the track and giving himself room, Mahmood follows him. Tucks it away through midwicket off his pads"
"<b>dropped by Bairstow running to his left</b>. Dug in a short ball to the tailender, who went for the pull and got a top edge. Went high up and towards square leg, Bairstow ran and got his gloves to it but couldn't hold on"
"good finish with a yorker that goes through his legs, outside leg"
"yorker on the fifth stump, he tries to steer it more in hope than anything but doesn't make contact"
"back of a length outside off, gets an under-edge on the pull that bounces to the keeper"
"slower ball yorker, too early into the shot and it balloons up in the air. Willey sprints in from mid-off and puts in a dive. Again a fielder gets hands on the ball only for it to pop out. Will go down as a <b>drop</b> even though he did really well to get to it in the first place"
""
"length ball outside off, but slower one. Doesn't get hold of the pull but heaves it into the midwicket region"
"quick bouncer to finish and he gets a wicket with the last ball of the innings, his first! 1597 days between international wickets for him as per the commentators on air. The batsman gets into a tangle trying to evade this but gets a glove through to Bairstow"
tight line on off stump and blocked
"drops the hands outside off, good carry through to the keeper"
"<strong>slammed to extra cover!</strong> A wide half-volley, Roy's eyes light up, he flings the kitchen sink through the line, and picks out the man! Goodness... Roy flings his bat in the air in frustration. What a start for Ireland!"
"fired past the hips, trying to swing the ball but that one shapes down the leg side"
"back of a length, a compact punch to extra cover"
"shoulders arms outside off, like a man with all the time in the world"
"blocked down into the crease, head over the ball on the back foot. Tight line and length once more"
fizzing past the hip. Good carry but slightly off line with his left-arm livelies
"blocked on the back foot, sightly hurried once again by a burly action"
"angled across the right hander, Bairstow lets it fly by to the keeper. That early wicket has demanded England take a look and show respect"
"pumped through the covers, well placed into the gap and hoovered up on the edge of the rope, Bairstow climbing into the fuller length and wider line"
"<B>flogged high and majestically over cover!</B> Bairstow has now, officially, Had A Look. Width again, and sumptuous hands through the ball. All about the hands..."
"<B>that was all about the spawniness!</B> Threw the hands at more width, but Bairstow got the absolutely perfect inside edge, nutmegging the keeper and fizzing to the rope. You can't set a field for that!"
"short-arm pull, out to deep square leg, that's a better over from England's point of view. Just the 200 to get now..."
"too full, too straight, <B>pinged over deep midwicket!</B> Bairstow is in one of his moods, you sense. And it's a very good mood. Waiting for the ball but timing it so sweetly off the toes"
pumped back to the bowler off the back foot
"oof, that's a shot at thin air! Back of a length, outside off, greedily into the short-arm pull and missing out entirely"
"too short, and <B>pounded gloriously through midwicket!</B> Bairstow clears the front leg and lets his bat and eye do the rest..."
"over-pitched, thumped with authority but straight to mid-on"
"speared into the toes, and <B>that's glorious from Bairstow!</B> Another thumping dump of a shot, broad beam of willow arcing through the line, lifting the ball high over the ring and away to wide long-on"
"a wafty drive, on the back foot, not quite timed"
"<strong>poor ball, but well played.</strong> Back of a length on the hip, rising into an easy gliding pull, not putting any extra power through the shot, but timing it supremely behind square"
"fired across the right-hander, but too wide. You know which shot he's trying to lure though..."
"squared up on the back foot, an open-faced push to point"
"trapped on the crease and thumped on the pad, but no appeal, hopping over the top"
"blotted down into the crease, on the back foot. Cautious in defence"
"over the wicket, tight line, respectfully blocked on the back foot"
pressed to mid-on as Young probes on a full length

"solidly blocked back to the bowler, very full length"
"tucked off the legs, down to backward square"

"very full, wide line again, decent defensive areas as Banton scuffs a drive to point"

short again and Bairstow can't time his pull

"<b>through him!</b> Cuts back in sharply and goes between bat and body, beats the keeper too"
