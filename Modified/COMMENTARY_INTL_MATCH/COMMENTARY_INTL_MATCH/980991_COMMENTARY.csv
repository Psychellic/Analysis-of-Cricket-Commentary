"gentle inswinger on middle and off, Amla gets forward and defends it to point"
"width and crunched! Amla's eyes lights up as he cracks that past Karn Sharma at point. Poor effort, he underestimated the bounce there"
punched to Yuvraj at mid-off for a quick single
"shapes away a touch after pitching at length on middle, Vijay negates the late movement by offering a straight bat to defend it"
hint of width and he's flayed that down to third man
"straying onto the pads, deflects off the pad to short fine as he looks to tickle it. Scoring opportunity misse"
"early into a lofted hit, just falls short of mid-off. The ball didn't arrive at all, Amla opened the bat face a little too early"
he's hammered that between cover and point. Standing tall and hitting through the line without the fear of any demons on the surface. Pure hand-eye coordination
"more width, and the result isn't different. Angles it past Amla, who frees his arms and crashes that behind point. Third man had no chance. Nehra's looking for some inward movement, but there hasn't been any so far"
walks across the stumps and turns it to short fine leg
beaten by the zip off the surface this time. Looks to run it down to third man but was late on the shot
"he's picked the gap with precision. There were two cover fielders no more than a couple of metres away, and he still managed to pierce that gap. Length ball on off stump and he punched that beautifully"
"length ball on middle and leg, wristed to deep square leg"
"this time there's a man at sweeper cover, Amla punches it to the man there"
"steps out to hit through the line over cover, but was cramped for room, the slice lands short of point"
the flat-batted pull rolls off the toe end of the bat to mid-on
"moves away late from middle, Vijay was squared up but adjusted well to defend that to point., Yuvraj's rocket throw from point had Vijay scampering back, looks like he was just in"
fetches the whip from outside off to midwicket
squeezed off a thick outside edge to Fizz at third man
"dangerously hops across to whip it behind square, misses and is hit on the thigh pad. Nehra appeals, but the ball pitched outside leg stump"
"gets hold of the pull, but straight to Henriques at deep square leg"
"he's picked the bones out of that one. Too full and Amla just gets to the pitch of the ball and lofts it nice and clean, hitting through the line and the ball flew off the dead center"
walks across the stumps and works it to midwicket for a quick single
"opens the face of the bat and works it towards cover point, where a misfield gives them a single."
"starts off with a cutter that angles away, Vijay chops it tentatively to the off side"
"the slower ball has done the trick. This is floated full across Vijay, who looks to flick, but the ball lobs off the leading edge to Warner who takes a dolly running in from mid-off."
worked towards midwicket for an easy single. There was no one there
"looked like he checked his drive, the ball takes the edge but falls short of a widish slip fielder"
"this time he angles his bat to ease it past the diving slip fielder, good work by Ben Cutting at third man to save a couple of runs. Ran across to his right before dishing in a full length drive to stop that"
lovely wrist work to get it towards Dhawan at deep square leg
how lucky is Saha there? Nearly chopped a length ball onto his leg stump. The ball flies off the inside edge into the fine leg boundary
"looks to run it down to third man, cramped for room. Dabs it to the keeper instead"
"crunched to Dhawan who gets an awkward bounce at point, they pinch a single"
"wow, simply wow. This was a leg cutter but he landed it too short, and Amla rocked back, waited and waited on it before punching it behind point. Superb placement"
"looks to play the short-arm jab, cramped for room and is beaten"
pushed wide of cover for a quick single
leans forward and works it against the turn to deep midwicket
"flatter one that breaks away from off stump, pushed to cover"
steps out and drives the full toss to long-off
"skids back into Amla, who makes a bit of room and bunts it past the bowler for a single"
skips out and drives it with the spin to long-off
stays inside the crease and squeezes a full ball to Yuvraj at point
"gentle off cutter outside off, dabbed to third man"
"walks across the stumps and whips it towards deep square, called two the moment he hit it"
"looks to squeeze that behind point, but the ball flies off a thick outside edge past short third man. It was too full, there was plenty of width there and Amla went hard at that"
uses the angle to nurdle that to fine leg
"not much room to work with, he defends it with soft hands behind the wicket and scampers through. It was Amla's call"
"cuts it to Yuvraj, who moves to his right from point to keep that to a single"
steps out and works it across the line to deep midwicket
"walks out but can't get underneath the flight, squeezed to cover"
"deceived in flight as he skips down the pitch again, pushed back to the bowler"
"tucked towards deep midwicket, there was a boundary rider at deep square who had to run it to stop that"
"gets to the pitch of the ball and whips it wide of Warner at deep midwicket, sensible cricket this"
once again he gets a little too close to the ball and ends up jamming his bat down in the end to keep that out
"nicely tossed up, Amla squeezes it wide of point for a quick single"
"lucky to get away with that short one, there was width and he cracked that well, but straight to point. A metre to his right and it was four"
steps out and works it to long-off
"gets underneath the flight and smears that into the extra cover boundary. This was gently thrown up, Amla cleared his front leg to make room and unfurled those wrists to pick the gap"
driven with the spin to sweeper cover again
"sweet timing, even better placement. This time he does well to adjust to the flight and then loft that cleanly over the infield. Picks the huge gap between deep point and long-off"
"flat delivery on middle and leg, tucked to short fine for a quick single, <b> first IPL fifty for Amla </b>"
steps out and nudges it to Mustafizur at short fine leg
"this one pitches on middle and leg and straightens, Amla accounts for that and then whips it between deep square and deep midwicket"
driven down to Bhuvneshwar at long-off
"it's the delicate little reverse dab this time. He was playing it with the turn and got enough bat on it to generate speed. Nehra was giving it chase from short third man, and wasn't sure whether to dive or not"
gets to the pitch of the ball and drives it with the spin to long-off
"the breakthrough has been achieved. It was a nothing shot from Saha. Skips down the pitch to play the flat-batted pull, he was done in by the extra bounce perhaps and ends up skewing the ball towards Deepak Hooda who makes no mistake running in from deep midwicket."
"angles a length ball on middle and leg, tucked to fine leg"
"looks to cut, not much room to work with as he chops it towards the keeper"
"the off cutter gone wrong. It was too full and had enough width for Gurkeerat to lean forward and then angle his bat to get that behind point, the ball pinged the middle of the bat, third man had no chance"
whipped from outside off to deep backward square leg
mistimes the pull to midwicket
"starts off with a slider on middle and leg, tucked towards square leg"
"steps out and works it towards midwicket, it was no more than a gentle push, Henriques has plenty of ground to cover from the boundary there"
makes some room and crunches it to sweeper cover
"flatter one on middle, there's a hint of turn, Gurkeerat cuts it to deep point"
"sees Amla giving him the charge and fires it wide, but he does well to make the adjustment by lofting it over the infield. Sweet timing, he was also helped by Ben Cutting, who didn't pick the ball immediately at deep cover"
"hit hard, but straight to Yuvraj at point"
"length ball on middle and leg, worked uppishly towards deep midwicket"
"improvisation at its best! This was too short and sliding back in, Amla walks outside the stumps, uses the pace and ramps it over short fine leg, one bounce into the boundary. Must admit I haven't seen him play this shot before."
"misses out a scoring opportunity, it was a full toss, Amla struck that well but hit it straight to the cover fielder at the edge of the circle, a misfield allowed the single"
"cracking shot. Whips the length ball uppishly towards deep backward square leg, excellent wrist work to get the elevation and placement"
"well-directed bouncer on middle, but Gurkeerat goes through with the hook and top-edges it over the keeper. Can't set fields for such strokes. That was bowled at 137 clicks, so had enough pace on it anyway"
"length ball on middle, tucked to deep square leg"
"he's cleared the infield. It was too full, Gurkeerat makes room and muscles it over mid-off, clean strike"
"spears in an excellent yorker-length delivery outside off, Gurkeerat can't squeeze that behind point"
"another low full toss on off, Gurkeerat looks to go leg side but can only toe end it back to the bowler"
"completely foxed by the slow off-cutter that angles away from middle. It was a touch short, Gurkeerat looked to whip it over square but was through with the stroke even before it go to him, Naman Ojha takes it on the bounce"
"squeezed to Bhuvneshwar, who misfields at sweeper cover to give away an extra run"
"gets some fizz off the deck this time, this one is landed a little too full and on middle, he isn't sure whether to swing or defend, in the end the ball beats the outside edge through to Naman Ojha"
"for a while, it didn't look like he had hit it well enough to clear mid-off, but boy, he has a lovely bat. Cramped for room but went through with the flat-batted pull, just cleared the fielder"
eased to point for a quick single
"looks to slog across the line, but changes his stroke and defends it to cover instead"
backs away and drills the full ball on middle to Warner at long off
"he's swung that across the line and has enough to carry that over long-on. Length ball on middle, he clears his front leg, opens up the leg side field and flat- bats that"
"this time, he's smeared that to deep cover"
"he's into that 80s with that paddle. Full ball, he shuffled across the stumps and then uses the pace to deflect that past short fine leg. Delicate, but mighty effective"
exceptional batting this! Pulls that into the gap between deep midwicket and long on. Picking the length early was the key there
"looks to pull but is cramped for room this time, kept a touch low as well, through to Naman Ojha"
backs away and squeezes the full ball on off stump to cover
angles it down to third man for an easy single
"wow, he's gone into overdrive. This was a yorker-length delivery angling away, Amla walked across, and got underneath the ball to take it on the full and scoop it wide of short fine leg. Boy, he got enough bat on it to get that a couple of bounces into the boundary. Outstanding!"
"third man up, and Gurkeerat places the ball into that region. It was a length ball outside off, Gurkeerat uses the pace to angle the bat to pick the gap between the keeper and short third man"
goes for a wild swing but was way too early as the slow leg cutter gripped the surface and deviated a touch to beat the swing and hit the stumps
whipped to short fine leg to get off the mark
"hoisted into the deep midwicket boundary. The man there was a touch inside, and not at the ropes. I wonder why. Amla got enough bat on it to clear the man"
"another flat-batted pull towards Vijay Shankar at deep midwicket, the ball was dipping on him and he did well to stop it on the bounce"
"worked into the gap at deep midwicket, excellent running between the wickets"
"backs away and carves it towards Vijay Shankar, who was running in from the sweeper cover boundary. Don't think he picked it, but the ball was dipping on him. Tough chance, really. The Fizz applauds the effort"
"slogged down the ground to long-on, won't get the second"
"high full toss outside off, smashed straight to Henriques at cover, scampers through for a run, had to stretch full length to get back into the crease"
"the change of pace allows Miller to line himself up and clobber that one bounce into the deep cover boundary. It was too full, and he simply teed off like a golfer to get the elevation"
"searching for a yorker, ends up bowling a full toss on middle and leg, whipped to deep midwicket"
"looks to scoop it over short fine, but Mustafizur saw him shuffle across and speared it wider and fuller outside off on a sixth-stump line, Amla misses"
"he's swatted that literally, bisects long-off and long-on. Too full and he generated enough power despite not hitting it off the centre"
"reaches out to a delivery angling away, gets some bat on it and they're off for a single"
"shaped to pull, but was too early into the stroke. It was the slower ball as well. The idea was good, execution, not so good"
"and no, he won't get the hundred. Amla looks to drill that over long-off, but can't get enough bat on it as he holes out to Warner at long-off. It was a tired stroke, he knew he didn't strike that well the moment he hit it. The dug out stands up to applaud, the owner is happy too! Super knock"
"swings too early, the ball deflects off the back pad to the keeper"
"he's cleared the ropes comfortably at wide long-on. This one was full and angling away, but it was in Miller's swinging arc as he got the elevation and the distance. He's got a superb bat too. That would have cleared any boundary in the world."
"width on offer first up, Warner reaches out to play that one but can only hit it feebly to cover"
"yorker-length delivery on off, Warner gets a thick inside edge as the ball bounces over the stumps, they scamper through for a run though"
"hint of swing in the air for Sandeep, Dhawan plays away from the body and gets a thick edge down to third man"
"crunched that past mid-off, sensational timing. Makes a bit of room and then lends a straight bat to that half-volley to generate the timing"
a misfield at mid-on allows him to complete an easy single
"slip fielder was moved to gully, now the ball flies past the slip cordon to Anureet at third man"
"driven to cover as they pinch a quick single, Maxwell's rocket throw hits the umpire who was trying to take evasive action. It deflected off Vijay's hands"
"width and hammered. Warner gets underneath the delivery and drills it into the cover boundary. Once it beat the infield, there was no chance of that being stopped"
"rocket hit, straight to Maxwell at extra cover. Brave from Vijay to give it some flight again"
"another chance to Maxwell, who picks the ball and fires a throw at the bowler's end, Warner was just in"
"steps out but can't get to the pitch of the ball, defends"
"fires it full and wide outside off, Dhawan lets that go"
"drifting into middle, driven to mid-on, a half-stop keeps that down to a single"
"cuts it straight to point, boy, the ball flew off the middle"
"cuts, and sets off for a run that his partner wasn't interested in, Maxwell fires another throw at the bowler's end from point. Dhawan had given up and would have been gone had that hit"
"angles a back of length delivery across Warner, who looks to cut but misses. Lack of bounce did him in there"
cramped for room but he still manages to punch that across the line to mid-on
"goes through with the drive, but toe-ends it wide of mid-off"
"he's deceived by the change in pace, Warner was shaping to biff that over midwicket but changed his stroke, the ball lobbed off the face but just landed short of Vijay at mid-off"
"not an auspicious welcome for Anureet Singh. Sprays it at length on off stump, Warner makes a bit of room and then opens the bat face to ease that behind point. Maxwell gave it chase but had no chance"
"punched on the up, straight to Behardien at cover point"
chopped towards short third man for a quick single
sashays down the pitch and plays a half-pull over midwicket. Not off the middle but there's enough bat on it to clear the infield. Anureet doesn't have enough pace to trouble the batsmen with those deliveries
"pulls and misses, they get a run off the deflection to short fine leg"
"dabbed wide of point, they make eye contact and off they go for the single"
"floats a short delivery outside off, Warner uses the depth of the crease to pick his spot. Thumped that between cover and point. What timing and placement!"
"whipped towards Maxwell at deep midwicket, it was hit towards the longer part of the boundary"
"width outside off, crunched to Axar Patel at sweeper cover"
"stays inside the crease and bludgeons the drive, straight to the cover fielder though. He packs a punch when he strikes them with that big broad bat of his"
"the left hand came off the handle when he made contact, but he still managed to generate enough power for the ball to clear long-off. It was a length ball, and boy, he clobbered that or what"
"mistimes a flat-batted pull to mid-on, gets across for a quick single"
fetches the sweep from outside off towards short fine leg
"driven through the line to long-off, Miller was caught napping there, Warner called two the moment he hit it, and got it"
"this one is short and drift back into middle from around the stumps, Warner cuts it straight to point"
drops it with soft hands towards short third man
"time for Dhawan to come to the party. This was once again drifting into the leg stump, Dhawan got down on one knee and picked the gap between square leg and short fine leg. Got enough elevation as well. It was fired in and he used the pace nicely"
"solid punch! Steps out and hits through the line over mid-off, one bounce into the boundary."
slapped off the backfoot into the gap at sweeper cover
"this one's fired into middle from around the stumps, tucked with the angle towards the man running in from deep fine leg"
"appeal for lbw as Dhawan misses the sweep, but the ball pitched way outside leg. Can't be out even if it would have gone on to hit"
"flatter one delivered on middle, pushed back to the bowler"
bunts it down to long-off
"shuffles across a touch and punches it into the gap between deep midwicket and long-on, excellent running again"
"looks to slog sweep that length ball angling across, but misses"
"firm punch, but straight to Vijay at cover"
"looks to hit that across the line over long-on, but swung inside the line of the ball, good take by Saha. There was a puff of dust that came off the surface as the ball landed slightly ahead of the length area"
"oversteps in his quest for extra pace, delivers a full toss as well and it has been thumped into the extra cover boundary. <b> Free-hit coming up </b>"
"struck firmly, but on the bounce to Maxwell at mid-off. Lucky to get away with that half-volley"
"pulled, not off the middle, Stoinis does the mopping up at deep midwicket"
"floats it full, the ball tails away a touch on middle, Warner pushes it down to long-on and chances Mohit's arm for a second run, but Dhawan, who was slow to turn around for the second, wasn't ready and has to make the long walk back as the rocket throw hits the stumps direct at the bowler's end. Mohit had to run fairly a long way from the boundary, and he managed a clean pick up and throw from long-on. Dhawan was miles outside the crease. Boy, doesn't Mohit love these direct hits? Not quite in the same league as the one that got AB de Villiers at the 2015 World Cup, but an outstanding effort nonetheless. Has given KXIP a breakthrough they were desperately searching for. Dhawan didn't even wait for the third umpire's decision. The moment that hit the stumps, he was off"
"pushed through quicker on middle and leg, paddled past short fine leg"
"tossed up on middle, he steps out and works it with the angle to long-on"
makes some room and cracks it to sweeper cover
"drifts into middle and leg, punched to long on"
"swung across the line, gets it off the bottom of the bat towards Miller at long on. The ball hurried onto him a touch as well"
"slows it down nicely this time, Hooda checks his shot at the last minute, Axar dives to his left to stop that"
"looks to cut but there wasn't much room to work it, it was an off cutter as well, Warner gets a thin edge that rolls to Saha"
slower and fuller on wide of the crease - he's working up the angles well - driven to long-off
moves across the stumps and plays the half-pull off the slower delivery to deep square leg
"chops it straight to backward point, Maxwell slips as he runs in"
"how slow was that? Warner could have had a cup of tea and then played the shot he wanted to. Hops back to cut, but is deceived by the change in pace, the ball grips the surface and takes ages to get to Warner who is beaten as he looks to defend"
"slower bouncer once again, Warner looks to play the upper cut but the ball keeps swerving away from him"
cuts it wide of point for an easy single this time
"Sandeep nearly received a blow to his legs. He swats the length ball back down the ground, Sandeep had a split-second to either look to stop that or get out of the way, phew! I wouldn't want to be the bowler"
"misses out. It was short outside off, through with the pull way too early and the ball deflects off his right thigh to the off side"
"low full toss outside off, he makes a bit of room and drills it into the gap at sweeper cover. Exquisite timing!"
"dishes a slower bouncer on middle and leg, Warner ducks under that one thinking it would be called wide, umpire thinks that was fine, harsh maybe"
punched to long-off to bring up his sixth fifty this season
whips the full length delivery to Axar at deep midwicket
"whipped towards Miller, who hares in from deep midwicket to keep that down to a single"
"too short, and is lucky to get away as Warner pulls it straight to deep square leg"
"slower bounce, the ball sticks onto the surface again, he is into the pull but has to adjust late to keep it down the ground"
"full and tailing away from middle and off, Warner gives himself a bit of room and crunches it to sweeper cover"
"another no-ball, flicked into the gap at wide long-on. <b> Another free-hit. Cardinal sin for someone who is military medium </b>"
"walks across the stumps to help that slower bouncer over short fine leg, but the spongy bounce got him there. Hooda isn't happy with the umpire's call"
"sweet timing, top class placement. Just a hint of width and he cracks that past a diving Maxwell at backward point. Sweeper cover had no chance"
"big wicket, and a big moment in this match. Third Sunrisers batsman who is out in this fashion. It was fired into middle, Warner goes far too deep inside his crease to whip it away but the backfoot slips as he disturbs the stumps and has to walk back. Lets out a huge cry of anguish. First Yuvraj, then Hooda. Now Warner."
"spinning back into middle and leg, flicked to short fine leg"
"delicately done, there was just a hint of width, Yuvraj stayed inside the crease and then delicately dabbed it past short third man. Playing it late was the key, superb execution"
punched down to long-on
advances down the track and flicks it uppishly towards deep midwicket
"he's struck that superbly. Had to reach for it, but executed the lofted hit to perfection. Hooda made his intentions clear by stepping out, Axar saw that and fired it full and wide, Hooda quickly adjusted and went through with the swing to clear long-off"
"vintage Yuvraj! This one was floated full on leg stump, Yuvraj wallked inside the line to make room and then swung through the line to bludgeon that between cover and mid-off. Majestic!"
hops across and whips it to deep backward square leg
"sees the batsman move outside leg and floats it at length to tuck the batsman up, but Hooda does well to bring his wrists into play to ease it towards deep midwicket"
"slower delivery on leg stump, nurdled to square leg, Yuvraj wanted the second, Hooda didn't"
"yorker-length delivery outside off, squeezed to point"
"slow off cutter again, punched to long-off"
"can't generate enough power to pick the gap on that slower delivery, hit straight to point"
"looks to walk across to scoop over short fine, but changes his stroke at the end and runs it down to third man"
"streaky boundary, but it doesn't matter for the Sunrisers. It was a slower delivery at 90kph, he walks across to fetch the sweep from outside off but can only get a top edge that flies over the keeper's head, the short third man fielder was in business briefly, but the ball kept gathering pace as he neared the boundary"
"gets underneath the slower one and drills it own to long-off, Maxwell does well to stop that rocket hit. Stoinis did well to pull out of the catch"
"scooped, but just short of Mohit at short fine leg. Risky from Yuvraj"
"waited, waited and then helped it along over short fine leg. Too short outside off, Hooda's left leg was facing fine leg when he made contact. That shows how much he had to adjust to make proper contact. He was getting too predictable with that short ball, anyway. Duly punished. Sunrisers are cruising here"
"looks to drive, gets a thick inside edge towards long on"
"gives away his intentions of walking across to scoop too early, Sandeep slows it down by bowling an off cutter outside off, Hooda couldn't get his bat on it"
"width outside off, slapped to cover. They chance the single, but is Yuvraj caught short of the crease? He's just made it in the nick of time. M Vijay came running in from cover before firing the throw at the striker's end. A flatter throw may have saved him a split second. The Sunrisers breathe a sign of relief"
"typical Yuvraj Singh shot! This was slower and fuller,  he was waiting outside leg, almost as if to say come and get me, and when the full ball arrived, he simply swung through to clear the ropes at long-on. The swagger is back"
angles it between short third man and point for an easy single
"is there another twist? Hooda's party is over. This was a short ball outside off, Hooda looks to pull but he was always up against it as it was hit towards the longer boundary, Miller at deep midwicket did well to run in and then hold his composure before taking a regulation catch."
"fires it into middle, Cutting steps out and bunts it back down the pitch"
"drifting into middle and leg, pulled to deep square"
"punched, but straight to Vijay at cover"
pushed through quicker and across Yuvraj who can only play it back to the bowler. Bowled at 103 kph
"looks to heave it into the gap at cow corner, but the ball deflects off the pad to the off side, it pitched miles outside leg"
"he steps out to work it to the on side but Axar tucks him up by firing it dead straight on middle, bunted back to the bowler. Top over"
"he's muscled that 20 rows back over deep midwicket. Picks his spot, waits for the slower one to slide into him and then generates tremendous power in the swing to clear the ropes. The flow on that stroke was simply out of this world. Shades of the past, surely"
"he's picked the gap between short third man and backward point to perfection. It wasn't all that bad a delivery, Yuvraj made most of the little bit of width on offer to play the fierce cut. The opened bat face at the last moment allowed him to pick the gap."
"too full on leg stump, whipped to deep midwicket"
"the slower one, but it was bowled outside off to give Cutting enough time to generate power through that swing of his, clears wide long-on comfortably. The ball was sitting up nicely for him to play the shot. Poor bowling this. They are running away with the game"
"floats a full length delivery on middle and leg, looks to flick but misses, the ball deflects to square leg"
"excellent yorker on the base of off stump, Yuvraj stays nice and low as he directs it wide of point to retain the strike"
"poor ball but gets away with it. Too full and angling down leg from around the stumps, Yuvraj sweeps it to Behardien at deep square leg. A metre on either side and it was four"
"swings and misses, he looked to fetch that length ball from outside off"
"into the blockhole, Cutting squeezes it between long-on and long-off, they somehow scamper back for the second. Third umpire summoned, but Yuvraj was comfortably back in"
three good balls would amount to nothing if the fourth one is a full and wide half-volley outside off. Cutting clears his front leg and then reaches out to get underneath the swing and clobber that over long-off. The roar in the SRH dugout tells you the story
"swing and a miss, he looked to slog that across towards the longer boundary at deep midwicket, but missed. It was a slower one as well"
"was it the helicopter shot? Drilled to wide long-off, where Maxwell is patrolling the boundary"
"will have to rebowl that one, full but down leg, Yuvraj misses the faint tickle. Scoring opportunity missed"
"bye bye ball. He's hit that into neighboring Chandigarh. Length ball, right in the slot for Yuvraj's trademark swing that sends the ball soaring over deep midwicket. Generates tremendous power off the bottom hand, and this was another example of that. What a knock he's played here tonight."
"angles it full and back into the stumps, Yuvraj looks to jam his bat down to keep that out, but is late on the stroke"
"full toss on middle, he walks across the stumps and flicks it straight to fine leg, squeezes a single. A direct hit from Miller at the bowler's end and Yuvraj was gone"
"can you ask for a better delivery than a high full toss on middle when the entire field is in? No, you can't. This one is a juicy one, Cutting swipes that across the line towards deep midwicket boundary."
