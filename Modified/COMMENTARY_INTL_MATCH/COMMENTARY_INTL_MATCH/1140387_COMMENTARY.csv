"Stokes gets forward to the stock ball, smothers it"

"chopped into a gap at deep backward point and they put pressure on the fielder, coming back for two"
"tossed up full and YJB sweeps, <b>skids into the front pad</b>, SL go up for lbw again... Umpire Ravi demurs! Maybe outside the line of off? Bairstow looks like man who's just fallen off a treadmill, heaves himself up off his haunches"

"back of a length, worked away through backward square for a couple"
"skidding on past the bat, hits the front pad - given by umpire Ravi! But Moeen <b>reviews</b> again! This is close to a front-foot no-ball, before we even get into the mechanics of the dismissal; Marais Erasmus gives Dilruwan the benefit of the doubt, so on to the lbw... Looks like a chunk of inside edge on this, which would explain Moeen's swift review. <b>Yep, another one overturned!</b> Moeen isn't for budging"
<strong>Moeen immediately goes dancing!</strong> Down the pitch and pushes to long on
"round the wicket to Rashid, solidly defended off the back foot outside off"
fuller from Dilruwan. Rashid prods forward
"more on middle, defended to short leg"

short of a length and Moeen defends to short leg
"a shimmy down and defended. When will Moeen launch this over, if at all?"
"back of a length, defended through cover and no run taken"
"<strong>here he goes, and there he goes!</strong> Not the greatest shot from Moeen, as he dances down the pitch. Was looking to get on with the game, but hits it straight to long off. And by straight to long off, I mean that Mathews has had to move about one and a half steps"
hint of turn and Broad defends back
"tossed up outside off, Rashid pushes to deep mid off for an easy single"
"who can take a five-fer? The Sandakan can, that's who! Broad bowled round his legs! Immediately tries to sweep to a very full ball and beaten. This is so full it should have been a full toss. England collapsing quickly, and no Sammy Gunnar Solskjaer to bail them out this time"

"misses everything! Fired outside leg, Leach tries to Mr Tickle this round the corner, beats everyone and awy for four byes"
"oh hello matron! <strong>What on earth was Leach doing?!</strong> I did not expect that! Dances down the track looking to go over long off. Miscues it and that's a terrific catch from Mathews. Running South East, he keeps his eyes on the ball and takes a great catch"
"very wide from Broad first up, left well alone"
left alone once more. Athers comments that Broad is running off a shorter run
"finally goes straighter, on the pads, and defended. Broad definitely off a shorter run up"
"tight line outside off, left alone"

"full on off, Karunaratne pushes it to mid on and they take a quick single"
"on leg again from back of a length, worked to short leg"

encouragement for Broad. Bit of extra bounce outside off and Karunaratne fiddles at this. Carries through to Foakes
"<strong>dropped!</strong> Flew to Root at slip, he moves to his right and he can't hold on. Worse for England, it's away for four. Root din't get a hand on it, as that hit him on the wrist. That flew quickly"
on middle and Karunaratne is back to being solid
Broad into one of <em>those</em> spells. Beats the outside edge once more
on off and defended this time. A great contest between these two
"solid defence this time, but that's a great over from Broad"
"stifled appeal for LBW as Leach goes full, but two sounds, so probably an inside edge. Indeed, a big olde edge"
"back of a length, Gunathilaka doesn't play a shot and they try to sneak a couple of leg byes. No shot offered, so dead ball called"
full on middle. Defended back
full toss as Gunathilaka wanders down the track. Worked down to long on for a single

"reverse-swept, and <B>superbly so</b>. Oodles on bat into the stroke, whistling through the now-vacant backward point"

clipped off the toes to midwicket
"another fine bit of bowling, less menace than the first ripper, but probing away outside off with appreciable turn"
stabbed tentatively from deep in the crease. That's an encouraging first foray
"on the pads, tucked square"
chiselled to short midwicket where it is half-stopped
"<B>swept high and hard out to the leg side!</B> Brief shouts of a catch, but Broad at square leg can't pick it up, and Burns at midwicket is sent floundering"
"<B>Jennings bags another blinder!</b> Absolutely roasted into the leg side as Gunathilaka galloped down the pitch, but Keaton, under the lid, shimmied along the intended line of the shot, like a well-trained goalkeeper, then somehow absorbed the wallop into his midriff, toppling backwards to cushion the blow and secure the breakthrough for England!

stoutly prodded into the covers
cracked on the pad as Moeen deceives him in flight with a cunning bit of loop

"attempted pull as de Silva takes on the googly, and Foakes can't grasp the deflection as the ball seems to brush glove, bat, something ..."

jabbed down to third man once more. That will be <B>lunch</b>

"good line on off, over the wicket, and defended"
full from Broad and Karunaratne carefully drives to Moeen at mid off
"on middle, defended through the leg side and they briefly think of a single. Plenty of scurried 'no's"
"<strong>finds the edge</strong>, but doesn't carry! Karunaratne is looking to drive, gets a thick edge which doesn't carry and it's away for four"
on off and Karunaratne returns to being Mr Blockington. No run
too short first up and pulled with the imperiousness of a mollusc. Smashed through backward square leg to bring up the <strong>50 partnership</strong>

"good length on off, Dhananjaya carefully plods his bat in front of this"

"back of a length, pushed out to short cover"
"bit of turn, but nice and slow so Karunaratne can cut out to cover for a single"
forward then back from Dhananjaya and defended to point
"<strong>class in a biscuit tin!</strong> Lovely shot from Dhananjaya, who gets down the track and drives sweetly through mid off. Gorgeous"
back of a length and worked to short leg
tossed up and driven down to long on. Dhananjaya looking in fine fettle
"<strong>edged, and Root's put down another! </strong>That should have been taken! Indecisive foot movement, takes the edge and that seems to stay in the hands for an age. It somehow squirts out and Foakes can't save the blushes of the skipper"
worked through the leg side and they get a single
too much on the pads and it's clipped down to fine leg. Fine work in the deep from Leach means they only get a couple
"outside off, solid defence"
"full on off, driven to mid on. Broad's keeping a very probing line on the whole"

"very full on leg, clipped out to the boundary rider at deep mid-wicket"
"<strong>slog sweep goes wrong, but it lands safe.</strong> Dhananjaya having a few moments and he nearly perishes. Lands in square leg region. Denly as a sub fielder can't get there from mid-wicket"

"again keeping it outside off, Karunaratne watchfully defends"
"oh that's sexy! A sumptuous straight drive. I genuinely gasped after that, that's how gorgeous that was"

"shorter this time and straighter, defended back"
"slider down leg. Hits the pads, but going down leg. Something for Leach to work with"
"full on middle, defended"
too short and cut comfortably out to deep point
tossed up and very full. Dhananjaya's to it and defends
bit of a hack across the line and it's out to deep mid-wicket for a single
on the pads but too far down leg. Takes a smattering of the pad and rumbles away for four leg byes
back on to the outside off line. Karunaratne defends once more
driven gracefully to short cover
"shortish, Dhanajaya waits for the turn and cuts out to deep cover"
"dancing shoes from Karunaratne, who meets this and pushed down to long on"
"full and flighted, defended back to Leach"
Dhananjaya pushes forward as Leach sticks this on off. England trying to build some pressure here
slightly short so Dhananjaya can rock back and milk this down to long off
"hey hey, skip to the loo, skip to mid-wicket my darling. Lovely shot by Karunaratne, getting down the track and clipping it nicely through mid-wicket for four"
"tossed up, driven through deep cover and <strong>that's Dhananjaya's 50</strong>. A couple of strokes of fortune, but he's been resolute"
"full from Moeen, driven to short cover"
"just a whiff of drift, driven down the ground for a single"

"shorter of a length, defended back through the leg side but they trot through for a single to bring up the Sri Lanka 200"
again turn on offer and played very late by Mendis. Encouraging signs for the Rashmeister 3000
"has that carried to Foakes? A superb catch if he's got that. Mathews isn't moving, as he awkwardly attempts a pull. They're going upstairs. Soft signal is out. Front foot is fine, now to spin vision. It's off the toe end of the bat.<strong> That's a blinding catch by Foakes</strong>. Wonderful foot movement and dives forward to get his massive mitts under it. A huge wicket and the plan has worked"

bit of width and Roshen guides it down to third man. Broad saunters after it
tossed up very full on middle. Plinked into the off side and they take a single
a touch too short and an easy single out to deep cover
"Jennings is the jolly green giant of short leg! More fantastic work.<strong> Oh that is epic! What a catch.</strong> Reacts like a ninja as Roshen pushes the googly to his left. It's almost past him, and he sticks out a hand and clings on. He's a magician and England are on a roll"
nearly a drag on! Short ball from Stokes round the wicket and that has hurt Mendis. Pings him on the wrist. Nearly drags back on to the sumps. Mendis looks to be in severe discomfort. The physio runs out.
"length ball outside off, left alone"
worked off the rib cage past short leg for a single

a slo mo pre-meditated reverse sweep! Dragged through cover. All very Chariots of Fire music moment

"full outside off, pushed to mid on and they take a single"
"half an appeal for LBW, but that's turned a country mile to outside leg"
smart take by Foakes as Dickwella looked to sweep. They think of a review but looks like it missed

"full toss down leg, Dickwella misses"
"outside off, Dickwella leaves"
"<strong>risky from Dickwella!</strong> Takes on the uppercut and that could have carried. Bairstow is operating at fly slip, but was too deep that time"

"tossed up outside off, driven to mid off"

nice turn and a delicate prod by Dickwella. The clouds are building behind the scoreboard...
"slashed hard in the air, but lands comfortably short of Leach at third man. Risky business though"
"<strong>strangled down leg! </strong>Dickwella's got to go. Stokes' spell is getting rewarded. Dug in, he looks to tickle it fine, but it's too much of a tickle, and Foakes does the rest"
<strong>brute first up.</strong> Lands in silly point region. Stokes giving this a fully charged whack
follows it up with a fuller delivery. Dilruwan defends
too much down leg and Dilruwan leaves
"<strong>just short</strong> of Pat! Dilruwan not at all in control, but he's survived"
edged straight to Stokes. Someone's given Sri Lanka a toboggan and pushed them down Niagra Falls! Lovely turn and that's catching practice for Stokes. Sri Lanka in a mess
googly first up and Lakmal just about picks that
<strong>what on earth are you doing Suranga you maverick!</strong> Tossed up and he's tried to smash this out of the country
big turn and Lakmal beaten as this beats him outside off
"lovely turn once more and beats the edge. Rashid's making the ball sing, talk and serenade"
"googly back of a length, defended to cover"
"Stokes has another. Sri Lankan rabbits - meet the headlights! Short ball, finds the gloves and Foakes takes another. This is all utter madness"
"tucked into the ribs, jabbed down, wide of that man Jennings at short leg"
fizzed down the leg side. Stokes looked utterly spent after that wicket. Wonder how much more he's got in this spell
"short, and slapped firmly through the covers"
"good line and length, tapped into the covers, and <B>he's only gone and run himself out!</b> Entirely innocuous, entirely avoidable. A slight misfield from Rashid at mid-off, Sandakan set off as if stung by a bee, and was still two feet short when the direct hit pinged off his bails! Sandakan kan't. And Sri Lanka are almost done for this innings"
sliding past the leg stump. That will surely be it for Stokes. He can do no more to get a match moving

"sharp legbreak to follow, Foakes gathers well"
"back of a length, big turn, beats a flashy cut"
"big air, dips late, beats another flat-footed thrash"

"on the toes, clipped firmly to midwicket"
beats the outside edge with sharp tweak
"stretching forward, head over the ball, to defend"
"down on one knee for the sweep and <strong>up goes the finger!</strong> This looks utterly plumb, but as the last man standing, he's obliged to roll the dice. But, lo and behold, there's a <B>thin clip of the glove</b>, and Sri Lanka breathe again!"
"flogged through the covers, proper tailend walloping. 'Ave it!"
forward and defended to gully
"back of a length, biffed to mid-on"
"tossed up outside leg, and swept firmly behind square. Lots of holes in the field with England pressing for that final wicket. A chance to mitigate the damage"
"slow-turning legbreak, back of a length, chopped to the off side"
<B>honked high into the covers!</B> A dirty tail-end hack out of the rough at the R&A ... and it plugs safe
"<strong>pinned on the pad, that's lbw again!</strong> Another <strong>review </strong>... what will this reveal? Looked tight to the line of leg stump, but would have been smashing the timbers ... did it pitch on? <I>Indeed it did!</i> Rashid has five wickets!"
"outside off, no stroke offered"
leaning forward and defended into the off side
"on the back foot, crunched into the covers"

"slightly back of a length, Burns' heel does a little 'hello sailor' skip as he comes forward to defend"
"more solidly onto the front foot this time. No way through, as the groundstaff loiter"
solid in defence on the front foot. Very linear from the new-ball attack
a yelped appeal as Burns' toe gets close to the line of off stump. But to no avail
"<strong>huge appeal and gone first ball!</strong> Well, that's one way to redress the balance of play. Round the wicket, and skidded low into Jennings' shin as he planted his front foot. The angle might have been taking it down, but that looked to be at least clipping leg stump, and Jennings reckons there's no point in burning a review there.  Sure enough, HawkEye confirms it would have done just that. Scenes!"
"round the wicket, deflected off the pad, to short leg"
"clunked to midwicket, as Bairstow clips uppishly from deep in the crease"
"solid block, foot pressed down the line of the ball"

"wider line, back of a length, thumped to cover"
"full length, tight line, Bairstow drives once more. He's seeing it well enough against the quick"
"aggression from Lakmal, but that's a shocking call from the umpire. Bounces over Bairstow's head, but we're not playing one-day cricket!"

"a one-handed drive, squirts out to deep cover"
squeezed into the covers off the front foot
"back and across from Bairstow, blocking the line on off stump. Solid once more"
"<B>drifting in, thumped on the shin, another lbw!</B> Almost a carbon copy of the Jennings dismissal, Perera's skiddy lines give little margin for error when he comes round the wicket to the left-hander. Burns is guilty of planting the front foot as he plays across the line, and he too opts not to review"
"wide line, back of a length, chopped through backward point"
"reverse swept, that was very adjacent to the stumps so would have been a tangle if he'd missed. But he didn't"
"tip and run. Excellent running, as Root dips the ball into the off side and hurtles through instantly"
"down on one knee to sweep, flies quickly out to deep backward square"

"on the pads, tucked square, Root slips at the non-striker's end which ruins his hopes of coming back for two"

"pumped into the covers, it looks a different game already, as the singles start to flow"
"tapped into the vacant point, another easy single. There are gaps everywhere in Sri Lanka's field"
"round the wicket, a bottom-handed thump, hitting with the turn to long-on. Yep, another single"
"<B>gottim!</b> That's a Jennings-worthy grab at short leg from Kaushal Silva, the sub. It was turned fiercely off the face of the bat by Bairstow, and thudded into his chest at a rate of knots. He stood his ground, rode the ricochet, and clutched it to his chest to leave England in a further spot of bother!"
"onto the front foot, drifting in and threatening Stokes as he stretches forward a touch uneasily"

"nurdled to the leg side, another single"
"<B>swept in the air, and inches short of deep midwicket!</B> Mathews hurtled in as Stokes top-edged his shot, but he ended up parrying it as he arrived late on the scene!"
"<B>no mistake here! A leading edge and a fine return snaffle!</B> Root joins the collapse, he's fallen yet again to a left-arm spinner, and how vital is that first-innings lead looking now? Looking to work across the line, Pushpakumara saw the chance zipping towards him early, and dived low to his left to grasp it in both hands"

"tossed up and turns away outside off, opens the face and guides the ball to extra cover"

"straightens from leg stump, thumps into the middle of a pre-positioned bat as if directed there by magnetism"
"<B>loose!</B> Outside off, and a wafty chop of the gloves. Foakes gathers"

"another googly from Rashid, nudged with the spin, and <B>Leach has pinged down the stumps with a direct hit!</B> That is a massive moment, Mendis is stranded as the bullet shy comes in at the non-striker's end from backward square leg. Roshen had charged back for two, assuming the danger was at his end, but instead, it's a blue-on-blue moment and is this the spark that England needed?"

"flatter on middle and leg, Dickwell dares to sweep, the ball rolls only as far as midwicket"

"swept from the stumps again, this id directed to fine leg"

"four and out! Dickwella walks off, out to a bad-pad catch to backward short leg. Jennings collects another catch. This is a much simpler one, although he had to dive forward. Fractionally short, turns back in and bounces. Dickwella plays back to it and inside-edges the ball onto his thigh pad. It loops to Jennings"
