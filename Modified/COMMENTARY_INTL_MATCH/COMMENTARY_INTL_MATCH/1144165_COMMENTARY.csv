"pitched up and angling across off, 124ks, Elgar simply ushers it through to the keeper"
Lakmal hikes up his pace to 132ks and finds inswing. Back of a length and swerves back in to cramp Elgar for room. He manages to fend it away to the leg side
"shorter than the previous delivery and <strong>swings back in once again</strong>, Elgar jams an inside edge to deep fine leg"
"fuller than a good length, angling in at off, then <strong>swinging away against the angle</strong>. Markram presses forward and pats it down"
"back of a length and angling into middle and leg, 134ks, Markram shuffles across off and defensively works the ball away to the midwicket region"
"starts outside off and moves further away, Markram has nothing to do with that"

"nice and full outside off, ignored once again by Elgar"
"back of a length and Vishwa explores the channel outside off again, Elgar, however, doesn't"

"full and on off and middle, whisked away to short midwicket off the front foot"
"short and just a shade outside off, Markram hangs back and jabs to mid-off"
"Vishwa draws an appeal for lbw. Umpire Dar doesn't budge, but <strong>Dimuth then calls for a review</strong>. Nice and full, swings back in to have Markram falling over and playing around his front pad. Strikes the front pad below the knee-roll. Was it missing leg stump? Oh okay,<strong> it pitched outside leg and SL lost a review</strong>"
<strong>Lakmal hits an in-between length</strong> and gets the ball to seam back in sharply now. Cramps Markram for room and pings the thigh pad. It was surely bouncing over the stumps

"shortish and outside off, Markram stands up tall and fends the ball to the leg side"
"<strong>that's a cracker from Lakmal</strong>. How did that miss the edge? That's the teasing thought in Lakmal's head as he walks back. On a length, angling in, tricks the batsman into playing for the angle, then jags away past the outside edge"

"full and holds its line outside off, run away to backward point"
"<strong>Vishwa breaches the defences of Elgar</strong>, who is stunned. Vishwa ventures wide of the crease. After getting a few balls to swing away outside off, he gets this one to zip back in sharply and barge through Elgar's castle. Vishwa knocks over Elgar and the off stump. Elgar can't believe what has just happened"
<strong>Vishwa now storms through the defences of Amla.</strong> Catch him if you can. He sets off on a celebratory sprint. Pitched further up and swings back in against the angle from over the wicket. Amla doesn't quite cover for the movement and the middle stump takes a beating
"<strong>Vishwa nearly has Bavuma chopping on</strong>. Catches him in the crease, inside-edged onto the ground, the ball bounces over off stump"

"on a length and outside off, driven on the up to short cover"
"back of a length and slanted back in, pings the thigh pad"
"<strong>Scenes in PE!</strong> What have you done, Bavuma? He falls for a duck too. This was full on middle and leg, Markram simply drives it straight to mid-on. Bavuma, though, ventures a single. It just wasn't there. There was no call from Markram either.  Rajitha swoops down on the ball and nails the stumps at the non-striker's end to catch Bavuma miles short"

"<strong>that's the breakthrough!</strong> Just as lunch is called, Vishwa Fernando picks up his fifth for this Test. Good length, in that channel just outside off, and it straightens after pitching, with Elgar looking to defend with the incoming angle from over the wicket. Takes a feather edge through to Dickwella, and Vishwa is cock-a-hoop! Excellent bowling, and crucial breakthrough that will make lunch a whole lot more palatable in the Lankan dressing room"
