"length ball swinging across the stumps, finishing around an off-stump line. Stays in the crease to defend into the covers"
this one starts on around middle stump and swerves away into the fifth-stump channel. Left alone
"a bit more width, opens his bat face and jabs to the left of third man"
"lovely shot. A touch fuller, angling across to a fourth-stump line without too much swing away, and Kusal takes a step forward and shows it the full face of the bat to punch into the big gap to the left of cover"
"change of angle plus change in direction of swing. Into the left-hander now, and he comes forward to defend and is beaten by the swing and extra bounce. No lbw appeal, though, that was definitely going over the stumps"
"length ball close to off stump, defended into the point region"
"back of a length, angling across into the fourth-stump channel, punched into the point region"
"back of a length, straightens slightly towards off stump, hops to ride the bounce and plays it down towards square leg"
"length ball angling across the stumps. Stays on the back foot once more, uses his wrists to play it down to the left of the bowler"
"full on leg stump, clipped to square leg"
"length ball on off stump, clipped towards mid-on and square leg runs quickly to his right to intercept"
"slants this a bit wider outside off, but it isn't short enough to cut. Zips past Karunaratne's outside edge as he tries that shot, and Bumrah starts with a maiden"
"length ball straightening along an off-stumpish line, defended to short extra"
"back of a length, angling into leg stump. The ball stops on him as he tries the short-arm jab, and the ball hits the toe end of the bat and squeezes away past midwicket diving to his left. He was aiming to hit through backward square leg"
"Two slips means a big gap between backward point and extra-cover, and Karunaratne slaps this ball into that very gap. Bad ball, short and wide with no swing"
"not the greatest of starts from Bhuvneshwar, strays onto the legs this time, and Dimuth works it off his hip through the vacant square leg region"
"length ball on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"length ball on off stump, punched to the left of mid-on"
"length ball angling across into the fourth-stump channel, presses forward and pushes towards backward point"
"back of a length, putching outside leg and heading towards middle stump or so, hit on the pad as he looks to flick against the angle"
"back of a length close to off stump, gets up on his toes and punches firmly but Jadeja dives right at backward point and denies him runs"
"gone, is it? Dhoni's convinced, and Karunaratne begins walking. Width on this occasion, but it isn't short enough to cut, and he plays it with an angled bat rather than a horizontal bat, and only manages a top edge"
"length ball straightening towards top of off. Doesn't come forward, gets squared up and squirts his defensive shot towards backward point"
"again he gets it to straighten against the angle. A little fuller, and Avishka is half-forward to play this. Squared up again, and the ball goes into the covers"
"oh my, miscommunication! That wasn't full enough for the big hit down the ground, and he ends up too far underneath the ball rather than behind it. Scoops it high in the air, somewhere between mid-on and mid-off, more towards the latter. Kuldeep, going to his right, <b>drops the catch</b>, and nearly collides with Pandya coming in the other direction"
"full on off stump, driven to mid-off"
"looks for the inswinger to the left-hander, ends up swerving it down the leg side, past the attempted flick"
"fullish inswinger, attacking middle stump, and Kusal is slow getting forward to it. Ends up not being close enough to the pitch of the ball, and pops the ball in the air, but to the right of Kohli at short midwicket"
"length ball, too much width, and he just stands there and crashes it between backward point and cover point"
"length ball angling into off stump, clipped towards midwicket"
"length ball, strays too straight, and Kusal nudges it off his legs nice and fine, to the left of Bumrah at fine leg, and it races away quickly, too quick for Bumrah to attempt the dive despite getting fairly close to the ball"
"short outside off, and Avishka stands tall and slaps it firmly, but Jadeja once again cuts it off with a dive to his left at backward point"
"length ball on off stump, punched to mid-off"
"length ball straightens towards off stump. Not fully behind it in defence, but plays it well enough to extra-cover"
"big appeal, given! That big Bumrah angle, and Avishka has tried to drive down the ground without getting a stride forward. He's reviewed it, and the thing to look out for, I think, is whether it might have missed off stump. The ball went past the inside edge and hit the back thigh pad, so height may also be an issue. It's <b>going over the top of leg stump</b>, ball-tracking says. No footwork from Avishka, just looked to stand there and punch through the line, down the ground"
"full on off stump, driven firmly down the ground, and it runs away for four despite Bumrah getting the fingertips of his right hand to it in his follow-through. First runs off Bumrah"
"bouncer close to off stump. Thinks of pulling but realises it's too high for that, and leaves it alone in the end"
"length ball straightening towards off stump, defended towards short extra-cover. Once again he didn't really get behind the line in defence - his back foot stayed on leg stump, which will interest India's bowlers"
"fullish, close to off stump, lot of bottom hand in this whippy drive, not quite middled, to mid-on"
"a bit of swing into Kusal, but into his pads, tickled to the right of Bumrah at short fine leg. He moves quickly and fires a throw at the keeper's end, but misses. Avishka would have been home even if it had hit"
"fullish, close to off stump, defended to the right of extra-cover"
"outswinger, perhaps a touch too full and definitely too wide of off stump. Not too much footwork from Avishka, but he holds his shape nicely and frees his arms to drive between point and cover"
"fullish length ball on middle stump, defended to mid-on"
"full outside off, and Avishka goes for the big hit over mid-on. A good idea with the field restrictions, but he doesn't really middle it. Hangs in the air for quite a while, and it comfortably clears the fielder running back, but it plops down in the outfield and just stops there"
"is that an edge? There was a sound, and both Sri Lankan openers have walked. Bumrah's been getting the ball to straighten against his angle all through this spell, and it happens again. Slants across the left-hander, straightens back just a touch, and Kusal, looking to punch to mid-on, gets an inside edge on it that Dhoni does well to catch, falling low to his right. On TV, Kumar Sangakkara notes that Kusal's bat was coming down from gully, and slicing across the line as a result"
"length ball angling into top of off, gets back and across and defends down the pitch"
"back of a length, angling into middle stump, steps across to work it to fine leg"
"what a shot. Footwork? What's that? Why do I need it? Why, indeed, Avishka. A touch short, a touch wide, and he just stands there and frees his arms and drives it away through point"
"shot! That's exceptional from Avishka. Banged into the pitch, gets up above the left shoulder, and he swivels on his back leg in a flash to pull to the backward square leg boundary"
"length ball on off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"fullish outswinger, starts fairly wide of off stump, left alone"
"ooh, that's a beaut. Excellent length, though the line is still a little wide of off stump. Kusal took a step out of his crease initially, and across his stumps to get close to the ball, and late swing beats his edge as he looks to play the forward defensive"
"length ball, sixth-stump line, left alone"
"ooh, opened up completely. Length ball starting to swing and straighten along a middle-stump line - was it late swing or seam? - and Kusal makes the mistake of looking to close his bat face and work it leg side. Leading edge rolls into the covers"
"fullish outside off, driven to the left of mid-off, where Kuldeep misfields and makes it easier for the batsmen to run a single"
"full on middle stump, clipped to short midwicket. The fielder was in a catching position and the ball was in the air briefly, but it fell well short"
"full outside off, nice stride forward to defend"
"back of a length outside off, gets across his stumps to get closer to the line, and just drops his bat down on the top of the bounce to guide it down to third man"
"back of a length, fifth-stump line, punched (though it was a more flowy than punchy bat-swing) to cover point"
"length ball, closer to off stump, lets it come on and steers down to third man"
"bouncer rising over off stump, keeps his eye on it and ducks under it"
"back of a length outside off, frees his arms and jabs towards cover point"
"flat length ball on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"tossed up slower and wider, driven to deep point"
"full and flat on off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"Gone! Impatience gets the better of Mendis, and Jadeja finds turn in his first over. A little slower than usual, and he jumps out of his crease, but he gets nowhere near the pitch of the ball. Flails desperately at it, looking to hit over mid-off, maybe, and the ball spins past his outside edge. Dhoni does the rest"
"flat length ball on middle and leg, gets a nice stride forward to defend"
"flat, a touch shorter, angling into the pads, nudged away through backward square leg"
"length ball on off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"length ball outside off, nice stride forward to defend into the covers"
"length ball angling into off stump, Mathews does the Mathews shuffle across to off stump, and tucks it neatly to the right of midwicket"
"gone, and Hardik Pandya's slower-ball bouncer continues to take wickets. It's angling into the batsman, cramping him for room, and gets up to shoulder height. Looks to lean away and ramp it towards third man, but it keeps following him, and when the edge is taken, it's very close to the shoulder of the bat. The ball dies on its way through to Dhoni, who takes another very good catch, tumbling to his left and taking it inches off the ground"
"length ball angling into off stump, and he stays on the back foot to defend into the covers"
"good bouncer, angling in and rising over off stump. Thirimanne leans his upper body away from the line to let it go"
"back of a length on off stump, stays leg-side of the ball and punches to deep point"
"on the pads, clipped through square leg"
"flat length ball on off stump, punched into the covers"
"slower length ball on off stump, prods forward to push into the point region"
"tossed up slow again, fuller this time, stretches out for a soft-hands push into the covers. They chance the quick single, and Thirimanne is forced into a dive to make his ground at the keeper's end. Kohli had to sprint in a fair distance from cover, and move to his left to get the ball into his throwing hand"
"flat length ball angling across the left-hander. Presses forward but doesn't get close to the pitch of the ball, and the ball spins back in and hits the inside edge of his defensive bat"
"back of a length on off stump, defended into the covers"
"bouncer rising steeply over off stump, gets down low, down on one knee, to get under it"
slower short ball angling into leg stump. Steps across and swipes it to fine leg
"another slower short ball. Angling across to the left-hander's off stump. Gets across to tuck it off his hip, into the backward square leg region"
"length ball close to off stump, defended towards backward point"
"slower short ball outside off, waits a decade before playing a checked pull to deep square leg"
"flat length ball on off stump, makes a bit of room and punches to cover. There's a short, straight extra-cover too. And a slip"

flicked off the pads to midwicket. More boa-like constriction

"poky defence, back down the track. Nothing to work with here"
solidly blocked into the off-side as Jadeja rattles through one of his supersonic overs. Four balls gone in a blink

"down the track but can't get to the pitch of this slow, flighted one outside off. Slow enough for him to thrust his pad out towards the line and defend into the covers"
""
"<b>dropped</b>. This has been a horrible day for Bhuvneshwar Kumar. Chances his arm, goes against the turn for the big shot down the ground.

"tossed up slow on off stump, stretches out and works it with the turn to long leg"
"down the track, and Thirimanne goes against the run of play. Kuldeep's slowness and dip does him in.

"flat length ball on the stumps, blocked back to the bowler"
"slower and fuller on off stump, driven to long-off"
"appeal for a stumping - did Mathews lift his foot? This is that most difficult Jadeja ball to face, the flat, quick one that spins sharply. Gets forward to defend but the ball pitches shorter than expected, making him reach for it, and rips past his outside edge. Dhoni, as always, is electric with the glovework. Where was Mathews' foot? Is it on the line, or is some part of it grounded behind it? There appears to be just a bit of bat grounded behind the crease, and the third umpire flashes the not-out sign on the big screen"
"wow. That wasn't the cleanest of strikes. Flat one angling into the stumps, and he clears his front leg for the swipe over long-on. Hits the outside half of the bat, close to the leading edge, but it still carries all the way"
"bowls this wider outside off, and he stretches out for a push into the covers"
"short, just a bit of width, and Mathews springs onto the back foot and slashes it away to the right of short third man. He's really picked up the pace in these last few overs"

"flatter, rips in sharply from outside off. DDS wants to stay leg-side of the ball but the turn cramps him, and he turns his wrists to play it to long-on"
"another reverse-sweep. Again those two fielders behind square on the off side are in the circle - and they have to be, given the middle-overs field restrictions - and he uses his hands brilliantly to whip it over backward point"
"shortish, angling into leg stump, tucked off the hip to fine leg"
"slower ball, back of a length on off stump. Shuffles across and tucks it to deep square leg"

"bouncer outside off, rises too high to bother Mathews unduly but he ducks anyway"

"short one on the stumps, pulled to deep square leg"
"steps out, but steps out too early, and Pandya foxes him with a slower one into the pitch, short and just outside off. Tries to chop it away square, but the ball beats him with lack of pace"
"fullish, angling into off stump. Stays back and looks for a push through the covers, ends up inside-edging through square leg, thanks to the angle"
"yorker close to off stump. Looks to jab it through point, but the angle again makes him hit leg side, off the inner half of the bat to midwicket"
"shortish, gets up to about ribcage height above off stump, tucks Dhananjaya up for room. Late on the pull, and he ends up hitting it into the ground by his feet"

"in the blockhole close to off stump, jams down hurriedly and digs it back to the bowler"
"stump-high full-toss on off stump, fast and angling in. Punched down the ground to long-on"
"shot! That's short on off stump, only gets up to chest height, and Mathews knows square leg is in the circle. Goes for placement rather than power on this checked pull, just beats the fielder to his right"
"slower ball, shortish, tucked into the midwicket region"
"short, down leg, helped away to the right of fine leg"
"slower short one, angling away from off stump. Beaten by lack of pace as he tries to chop it away through point. And oh, Pandya seems to have overstepped. It's a MASSIVE no-ball"

"full on leg stump, and that's a lovely shot from de Silva. Flicks it up and over, and he finds the gap between deep backward square leg and deep midwicket"
"slower one, full and wide of off stump. DDS gave away his intention of reverse-sweeping a little too early, and Pandya simply moved his line slightly out of his reach"
"another slower offcutter, dug into the pitch on a length outside off. Leans back to try and dab it past short third man, but there's too little pace on it, and the bounce is too loopy for him to connect"
"slower bouncer this time, pulled round towards deep backward square leg"
"full, almost a yorker, close to off stump, swiped down to long-on"
"ooh, good idea, and the execution almost comes off. Expects the slower length ball outside off, and he makes a bit of room to try and carve it past backward point. Hits it too close to the fielder, though"
"fuller now, another slower ball, flat-batted to the man at long-off"
<b>ridiculously good yorker</b> Only inches away from ripping the off stump out of the ground. Dhananjaya is just waaaay too late in bringing his bat down. Woof. What a ball.
"<b>and he's ready for the yorker now</b>. Opens up his stance. Keeps his bat very very low. Crouches as the yorker comes down and then plants the open face on it to try and sneak a boundary through third man. Bhuvi doesn't let him. But wow, was that ever great cricket!"
"full toss on off stump, Mathews works it down to long-on"
"sprints across outside off stump, giving away his intentions way too early. Bhuvi has the time to adjust, bang a ball into the pitch right over off stump and beat Mathews' scoop shot"
"whacks the slower short ball outside off to the midwicket boundary. Top batting from a top player. Having been out there so long, he's able to pick the pace of the ball and punish it"
"yorker on off stump, Mathews squeezes it out to the sweeper"
"shapes to pull the short ball angled into him, but it's a slower one as well, demanding that he hold his shape that extra second longer. Does so just about well enough to get a single to long leg"
follows him with a low full toss as he makes room outside leg. Mathews basically lets ball hit bat as he finds a single through cover
pulls the short ball from outside off to deep square leg
"slower ball, full and wide of off. Steps a long way across and looks to Azharuddin it through midwicket, but plays too early and misses. Ricochets off the pad towards short third man"
"gone. Not quite in the blockhole, on off stump, and Mathews actually times that really well, making a bit of room and punch-driving, but it's in the air at catchable height, and straight to extra-cover. A few meters either side of him, and that could have been a boundary. End of a wonderful knock, walks off acknowledging a big ovation. Is this the last we'll see of Mathews with the bat in a World Cup match?"
"low full-toss, jabbed down to long-off"
"leg-stump yorker, pulls his feet out of the way and jabs towards mid-on"
"in the blockhole on off stump, gets his front leg out of the way and steers to deep point"
"low full-toss on leg stump, whipped to deep midwicket"
"Not if he keeps bowling like this. Inch-perfect leg-stump yorker, and he gets his feet out of the way to try and squeeze it to point, but can only play it back towards the bowler in his follow-through"
"sees DDS attempting to make room and looks to follow him, and ends up sliding a full-toss down the leg side. They sneak another run to bring Thisara on strike"
"looks for the wide yorker, and slants it slightly beyond the tramline. Thisara leave it alone"
"slower ball, fullish, slanting into a wide-ish line outside off. Looks to hit over long-off, but doesn't time it at all, and Pandya takes a stunner to send him back, running in off the long-off boundary, getting up towards the 30-yard circle, and dives forward to take it with two hands. Shades of Ajay Jadeja catching Allan Border in the 1992 World Cup"
"slower short ball, angling into the stumps and bouncing loopily over them after passing the batsman at waist height. He was trying to make room and reverse-scoop it past short third man"
"in the blockhole on middle and leg, makes room and jabs to extra-cover"
"slower one, back of a length, swatted down to long-on"
"looks to make himself room and Bhuvneshwar follows him with a yorker at his feet. Brings down a straight bat to chip it over the bowler, and pick up two to the right of long-on"
"back of a length, slung into the pads, tucked off the hip for an opening single"
"tapped into the leg side, another single as Malinga slides into the legs once again. Striving for swing but not finding any yet"
"outside off this time, with a touch of shape away from Rahul as he shoulders arms"
"tight to off stump, back of a length, skidding into a defensive push to cover"
"wide line, through to the keeper with that slingy round-arm action ghosting it away from the right-hander"
"full length, into the toes, watchfully pushed to mid-on"
"firmly fenced off the back foot, sweetly timed to mid-off, who half-stops with a scrambling dive"
two slips in place as Rajitha probes an off-stump line to the solidly poised Rohit
"short and wide, <strong>a gift!</strong> Rohit hardly needs to get his feet moving to lace this one through point, a firm toe-ended cut, clean through the field"
"on the legs, worked behind square"
"<B>that is sublime!</B> Standing tall on the back foot, hardly moving his bat on impact, just twitching his muscles into a perfectly timed push through the covers!"
"worked off the legs, a direct hit would be close... but it isn't"
"<B>Rahul slaughters another drive!</B> Width on offer, a full face through the line, and out goes the second slip, tail between legs, as India's openers click up a gear!"
"good riposte, full and straight, into the toes and blocked"
"<strong>too wide once more!</strong> Such a full length that all Rahul needed to do was lay bat on ball with an open face. Easier said than done, of course, but that was perfection, through third man"
"much tighter to off stump, similar full length, prodded to point"
nudged to the leg side
"<B>dismissively perfect!</B> On the pads, swinging in, Rohit barely breaks out of his stance to flick the most casual of leg glances clean through midwicket! About as much energy expended as flicking on the bathroom light switch"
"clipped leg-sided once again, but not timed on this occasion. Short midwicket gathers on the second bounce"
"pressed hard back down the pitch, Rajitha dives across his crease, in the air for a moment, but can't reach it. Once again, a touch early on his stroke"
clipped down to fine leg
"opens the face on the back foot, deflected down to third man"
"firmly pushed, with the swing, into the covers"
a bit of shape through the air as Sharma leans on another off-sided push
"short, straight, swivel-pulled to backward square"
targetting the toes with an attempted yorker. Blotted to the leg side
pushed into the covers
"too wide on a full length, and <B>potted through third man like a snooker cue!</B> Opens the face, knowing full well there's no-one there to intercept it and away she goes!"
"<B>back-to-back boundaries!</B> Malinga over-compensates, full once again but on the toes, and clipped sublimely through midwicket"
"outside off, but not too far outside off this time. A well-directed offcutter to keep the batsman honest"
flipped round the corner
"<B>angular beauty from Rohit!</B> Opens the face on impact to ease a perfectly poised drive through extra cover! Hands and elbows high through the ball, head still. Gorgeous"
"short and wide, crashed to point, but straight to the man"
"tucked up on a tighter line, bends double as the ball nips back"
"a floaty full length, outside off, luring another measured drive, but straight to mid-off"
"<B>another sweetly timed clip off the legs!</B> Through the covers, through midwicket... there's no safe place to bowl right at this moment!"
"slower ball, 105kph on a full length, watched onto the bat and blocked"
"aiming full once again, but sliding into the legs once again. No timing on this clip, for once, as deep midwicket gathers"
defended into the leg side
stretching forward to defend once more
"back of a length, tight line, another open-faced steer to short third man"
nurdled off the toes
poked out to point

"tucked off the toes to the leg side, short midwicket gathers"
"nudged square, back of a length on the hips"
"slower ball, grips in the pitch as Rohit closes the face on a defensive prod and watches it bobble into the leg side"

"shorter ball, whistles through to the keeper as the one for the over"
"tucked off the pads, into the leg side"
"outside off, back of a length, ambitiously swished out to point"

"line and length, a decent finish to the over, just one run in two overs now"
"nurdled round the corner, another single to the cause"
"banged in short, not timed on the pull, under-edged down into the crease"
"a crashing flog from back of a length, but straight to point"
"pulled through the leg side, swinging across the line as Rajitha drops his length a fraction"
firmly crunched back to the bowler as Rajitha aims fuller this time
"<B>cheeky!</B> An arrow-straight short ball, Rahul flexes his knees, lowers himself like an elevator to the ground floor, and skims the thinnest of ramps over the keeper's head! That's got him moving again!"
panned fiercely out through point. Straight to the sweeper
"full length, angling in from over the wicket, pushed out to point"
"battered out through point and parried by the fielder, bounced a foot short as he stuck out his right hand"
"angling away on a full length, opens the face to steer to point"
"<B>languidly drilled through the covers!</B> Elbows so sharp they could take out your eye, as Sharma presents a full face on a full length, and cashes in!"

"back of a length, squeezed into the off side"
"on the back foot, poked to cover"
"tucked off a straighter line, into the leg side"
"bottom-handed, punched uppishly out through point as Perera strays a touch wider"

"delfected off the legs into space behind square, another chance to rush back for the second"
full length and defended once again
"solid in defence, head in line, right behind the ball"
"<B>deceived, yet dismissed!</B> A cunning slower ball, Rohit is through his stroke so early, yet takes the bottom hand off the bat, lifts up and under the shot, clears mid-off, and plugs inches inside the rope!"
"wider line, clobbered to point"
"back of a length, angled from leg to middle, clipped square for another single"
"pumped out to point, a violent swing through the line with very static feet"
"on the back foot, angled into the legs, clipped square"
blocked on the front foot
"nudged out to midwicket, leaning onto the fuller length"

"on the back foot, driven into the off side"
"outside off, tapped down to third man"
nudged off the legs once more
"gentle swing across the right-hander, a bit of a squirty drive out to point, but safe enough"
"another flash of a drive, off the back foot, down to deep point"
"<strong>lovely ball,</strong> just holds its line outside off and ghosts past the edge as Rohit plays inside the line"
"guided with a measured cross-bat to third man, back of a length and wide enough to free the arms"
"solidly onto the front foot, head over the ball in defence"
"forward again, blocked back to the bowler"
"open face once more, nudged to point"
"<B>tossed up first-ball, and launched over extra cover!</B> Dipping into a golf-swing, high and mighty to bring up another fifty!"
firm in defence as de Silva finds a better length
"<B>absolutely howitzer-ed over the bowler's head!</B> Tossed up again, Rohit marches to the pitch like a schoolmaster to a playground tiff, and dispatches with a wipe of disdain!"
flicked to the leg side to keep the strike rotating
"whipped to the leg side, no way through there"
"pushed back onto the stumps this time, Rohit slides back and across to pinch the single to the leg side"
"back of a length, angling into middle stump, tucked to midwicket"
"Rahul tries to do a Rohit, shuffling down the track and looking to go over mid-off, but this cross-seam ball pitches slightly shorter than he'd like, outside off, and straightens past his outside edge"
"back of a length on off stump, shuffles across to work it to deep square leg"
"shortish outside off, chopped to third man, meeting the ball on top of its bounce"
"back of a length on off stump, steps across to try and work it leg side, can't get it past midwicket"
"length ball on off stump, blocked back to the bowler, with a straight bat but a slightly slicing-across-the-line bat trajectory born of an open front shoulder"
"flat length ball on middle and leg, clipped away through square leg to bring up the century partnership"
"lovely delivery, grips the pitch and spins in viciously from outside off with extra bounce. Rahul was shaping to make room and punch/cut to the sweeper, but he was cramped for room and ended up jabbing down on it to defend"
"a bit more width, a bit less turn, punched away through cover point"
"tossed up full on off stump, clipped to long-on"
"flat and full on off stump, defended back to the bowler"

"back of a length in the corridor, this time he stands tall and punches with a straight bat to deep point"
"length ball on off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"a touch short, close to off stump, and it only needs to be a touch short for Rohit to play that pull - this one's well in front of square, over the fielder at midwicket"
"back of a length outside off, punched towards backward point"
"shortish, fourth-stump line. Lets it come on and dabs gently to third man"
"lovely delivery, floats it across the stumps and gets it to keep going with the angle. Rohit presses forward to defend, plays for turn, and the ball slides past his outside edge"
"fuller, on the stumps, driven back to the bowler"
"looks to step out and make room to go through/over extra-cover, but he doesn't get to the pitch, and it spins back in. Jams his bat down to keep it out"
"bam. Had come out of his crease the previous ball, and Dhananjaya drops the next one short. Rocks back and swats it away through forward square leg"
"flat, on the pads, clipped away to fine leg"
"nice length, pitching just outside off and spinning back in. Gets forward and defends it back to the bowler"
"length ball, a bit of width, and Rohit just stands there and slaps it away over backward point. Third man runs around to mop up"
"well bowled. Hits that hard length in the corridor, possibly cross-seam again, and gets it to beat Rohit's edge with a bit of away movement and extra bounce. Rohit looked to be premeditating too, clearing his front leg, possibly looking for the pull over midwicket. Ended up poking at the ball with a vertical bat and missed"
"back of a length close to off stump, punched to deep point"
"shortish, close to off stump, gets too close to the line with his back-and-across movement, and chops it to backward point"
"a touch short outside off, Rahul gets in a better position with his back-and-across step this time, still has room for his arms to play the cut and beat backward point to his left"
"good-looking drive to the full one outside off, short extra-cover dives right and gets an important hand to it"
"tossed up fairly wide outside off, driven to sweeper cover"
"flat, shortish, spins down the leg side, Rohit doesn't even attempt to play it"
"flat on the pads, tickled to the left of short fine leg"
"bad ball. Short outside off, sits up nicely, and Rahul makes a bit of room and slaps it between cover point and extra-cover to bring up another half-century. He's batted well through this World Cup. He's just waiting for that big score"
"wham. A bit of flight, and Rahul is swiftly out of his crease, skips inside the line to make more hitting room, and launches it gracefully over long-off"
"flat and full on leg stump, gets forward to clip towards square leg"
"down the track once more, and the extra ball in the over - he bowled a wide earlier, remember? - is put away for four. This one's a little wider, so the inside-out lofted drive goes over extra-cover on this occasion"
"shortish, angling away from off stump. Stops on the pitch a little and he slaps it to cover point"
"on the pads, clipped to short fine leg, where Malinga fumbles it through his legs to turn a dot ball into a double"
"length ball angling across to off stump, clipped to deep square leg"
"nicely played. Back of a length and close to off stump, gets back and across, waits on it, and plays the old-fashioned late cut to third man. It's not the dab with an open face, it's a cut with the wrists rolled over on top of the bounce"
"slower length ball close to off stump. No pace on it at all, and Rohit punches to the man at cover"
"length ball close to off stump, stays back and punches to mid-off"
"short, angling into the batsman, pulled from shoulder height through backward square leg"
"short, angling down leg, and that's a poor ball, even with fine leg back. Swivels around and pulls fine, and even a big sprint from the fine leg fielder, Udana, to his right, plus a tumble at the end, can't stop it from going for four"
"looks for the yorker, ends up sliding it down the leg side. Got some late inswing on it, probably reverse"
"full-toss on the pads, yorker gone wrong, clipped to deep square leg"
"short, gets up to chest height over off stump, Rohit plays a checked pull to the left of fine leg"
"full outside off, Rohit plays a sliced drive to the right of third man"
"slower yorker on off stump, holds his shape well and clips to midwicket"
"full on middle and leg, defended to midwicket, played that with the full face showing"
"full on middle stump, clipped to midwicket"
"nicely bowled, slower cutter pitching just short of a length, within the line of the stumps. Looks to work it leg side, closes his bat face early, and sends a leading edge rolling towards point"
"shortish, a tiny bit of width, and that's classy from Rohit. A proper square-cut on top of the bounce, and he beats point diving to his left"
"length ball on middle stump, defended to midwicket"
"ooh, <b>lucky</b>. Wide length ball, and Rohit goes for the angled-bat slash away from the body. Was in good enough form to middle it, but this one bounces extra and takes the top edge. The diving Kusal Perera can't get his right glove to it, though"
"short slower ball, ends up sliding down leg, and Rahul aborts his pull"
"short ball rising shoulder high outside off, drags a pull out to the man at deep square leg"
"slower length ball close to off stump. Makes room to flay it through the off side, but doesn't get the pace onto the bat. Chops it hard into the ground and it rolls gently into the point region"
bouncer close to off stump. Rahul shapes to pull but the ball rises too steeply for him to attempt the shot. The umpires decide it rose above head height
"too full, this slower one on off stump. Or not full enough, depending on what length he was looking to bowl. Takes a step forward and just hoicks it up and over wide mid-on"
"looks for the yorker, bowls a touch too straight. Flicked off the toes to fine leg"
"low full-toss, too much width, and there's no one sweeping on the off-side square boundary. Cover point is in the circle, and Rohit eases a drive past that fielder's right hand"
"slower ball, follows Rohit as he shuffles away from leg stump to make room. Clips it quietly through square leg to move to 95 and keep the strike"
"back of a length close to off stump, lets it come on and dabs to backward point"
"back of a length outside off, waits, waits some more, and late-cuts to third man, meeting the ball well behind his body"
"length ball on off stump. Presses forward, pushes to mid-off, and the fielder is right on the edge of the 30-yard circle so there's an easy single on offer"
"full outside off, driven to the sweeper at deep point"
"in the blockhole, just outside off, jams down on it to squeeze it into the point region"

"low full-toss on the pads, clipped to deep square leg"
"back of a length outside off, gets up on his toes to punch to deep point"
"length ball close to off stump, defended with soft hands into the point region. More a dab than a defensive block, really. He wanted that single but hit it too close to backward point"
"back of a length outside off, chopped to backward point"
"slower ball, lots of width, and again Rohit finds backward point. Cut it firmly but straight to the fielder"
"shortish on off stump, and there's the pull. Becomes the first man to ever score five hundreds at a single World Cup. All in the first round, that too. Puts it away to the square leg boundary, and it's his third hundred in a row as well. What a tournament he's having"
"slower ball on middle and leg, worked away through square leg"
"full close to off stump, driven to long-off"
"length ball, on top of off stump with extra bounce. Keeps it down towards point with a roll of his wrists"
"length ball on the pads, clipped to the left of deep square leg"
"shortish, angling into leg stump, tucked off the hip to the left of Malinga at short fine leg"
"full-toss, about thigh-high, on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"wow. A moment of disbelieving silence in the crowd. Full, close to off stump, and it's the slower ball - did Rohit not pick it? Did he not watch it out of the bowler's hand, momentarily distracted after getting to his hundred? Who knows. He plays a checked drive and spoons it straight to mid-off"
"on the pads, tucked to the leg side"
"working the ball from a middle-and-off line, out to midwicket once more"
"stretching forward, blocking a length ball back down the track from an off-stump line"
"<B>pierces the covers with ease!</B> Striding forward, presenting the full face of the bat, and whistles to the boundary!"

"tip and run, an easy single to the left of mid-on"

"head over the ball, defending with a full-faced push to cover"
"driven with purpose and timing, but straight to short cover"
"back of a length, outside off, chopped to third man and <B>Rahul has his World Cup hundred!</B>. A beautifully paced knock, filling the massive void made by Shikhar Dhawan's injury ..."
"<B>here comes Kohli!</B> There's a sense now that this might end quite quickly. In the slot, pongo-ed over long-on with a dismissive wipe of the bat"
"inswinging into the toes, a decent delivery, but well watched onto the middle of a leg-side flick"

"solid in defence, into the off side"
"<B>pounded on the up, over the covers!</B> Sweetly struck, positive intent as the finishing line nears!"
<B>clears the front dog and mows a dismissive whack over the leg side!</B> Bounces just inside the rope as the fielder is powerless to intercept!

"more full-faced elegance from Kohli, just a gentle push to cover"
"slow bouncer, picked off the hips with a measured paddle to square leg"
"<B>edged, and Malinga gets the late breakthrough!</B> A short ball, doesn't get up, but follows Rahul as he limboes inside the line, and scuffs the faintest of edges through to the keeper! A brilliant hundred is ended by a champion bowler in the final moments of his World Cup career!"
"<B>gorgeous!</B> Kohli's cover-drives have all been a rehearsal for that one, utterly nailed through the covers with the most serene of followthroughs"
deflected down to third man
"swinging into the toes, pushed with the angle to mid-on"
"<B>bottom-handed belligerence!</B> Full length, and dismissively slapped back past the stumps!"
thumped to mid-off
"slower ball, swinging into a riotous pull, a polite appeal, and <B>Sri Lanka are reviewing!</B> It's not a terrible shout, actually.
