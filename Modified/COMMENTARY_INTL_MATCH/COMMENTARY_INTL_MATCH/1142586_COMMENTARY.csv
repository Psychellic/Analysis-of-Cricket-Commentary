much better. Angles it into the fourth-stump line and gets it to curl away late. Amla lets it swing and defends with soft hands towards backward point
"similar line, Amla defends again"

"fuller, closer to off stump, blocked back to the bowler"

"shortish, slanting away from off stump, reaches out to tap it away through the point region"
"ooh, extra bounce in the corridor outside off stump. Amla gets off his feet and fends at it, and he's lucky the ball doesn't kiss his gloves on its way to the keeper"
"overpitched, wide, and Amla says thank you, opens his bat face to drive it forcefully to the point boundary"
"oh, even better. Not quite as full as the previous one, and he holds his shape and meets it right under his eye to drive on the up, between cover and mid-off"
"back of a length, good bounce again in the corridor. Rides the bounce and dabs it down to third man"
"back of a length, angling across to off stump. De Kock plays with soft hands, looking for a quick single into the off side, but the man at point moves in quickly to cut the ball off"
"back of a length, close to off stump, defended to backward point"
"well played. Good length, angling in towards off stump. This one doesn't swing away, and Amla watches it all the way and defends with a lovely vertical bat, back down the pitch towards the bowler"
"second wide for Lakmal today. Loses his action a little, I think, and the ball starts swinging as soon as it leaves his hand, and ends up pretty short and very wide outside off stump"
"good length, fifth-stump line, left alone"
"width again, and Amla reaches out and carves it away, up and over the vacant cover point region"
"back of a length outside off, gets on his toes and punches it to the left of backward point. Third man mops up"
"ooh, lbw appeal. Length ball, swinging into the left-hander, who plays across it from the crease, looking for midwicket, and misses. Going down the leg side, though"
"Amla's racing away here, and he's being helped by some ordinary Sri Lankan bowling. Low full-toss outside off stump, and he squeezes it away to the right of backward point"
"full outside off and Amla drives with an open face again, this time to the left of backward point. Lakmal has to put in the dive after sprinting to his right from third man"

"quick, sharp bouncer over off stump - 87mph. Amla leans away from the line to evade it"

"short, angling into the batsman's waist. Tucked away to long leg"
"big appeal as Lakmal gets this to nip back in and defeat Amla's attempted flick. He was on the back foot, and struck on the back leg, but the ball probably pitched too short to be hitting the stumps"
"shortish, a bit of width, cut away to the right of third man"
"back of a length, angling into the body, clipped to midwicket"

short on off stump and this one sits up - none of the steep bounce we've seen so far - and Amla swivels to pull it away to the backward square leg boundary
"short again, a little further outside off, and Amla puts this away even more brilliantly, getting up off his toes and using his wrists to whip it away to the same backward square-leg boundary"
"now he goes full and wide, and Amla flows into a beautiful drive, into the gap between cover point and extra-cover"
"back of a length close to off stump. Jumps up and looks to whip it into the leg side. The bounce ensures he can't play it to midwicket as intended, so he ends up keeping it down defensively, towards the non-striker"
"back of a length on off stump, whipped away to deep square leg"
"gone! De Kock has looked uneasy so far, and he gets out to a poor shot. A good length ball slanting across him. It's around the line of off stump when he meets it, looking to hit it against the angle over mid-on. Ends up getting a big edge on it, and man at backward point takes the high catch, backtracking and running to his right"
"some outswing from a good length outside off, left alone"
"overpitched, and Reeza is off the mark with a lovely drive to the left of cover point"
"back of a length outside off, punched hard into the ground and it bounces up over the jumping backward point fielder"
"back of a length, close to off stump with some outswing. Left alone"
"good ball. Angling in from a little wider on the crease and leaving Hendricks from the fifth-stump line. He thinks about defending, then changes his mind and leaves at the last moment. Good carry too"
"back of a length, a little wider, and Hendricks plays and misses, slashing uncertainly, looking for the late cut"
"short and wide and Amla is a little late on his back-foot slap. Good pace from Kumara there. Ends up hitting it in the air, but on the bounce, to third man, off the toe end of the bat"
"shortish, angling in to cramp Hendricks as he gets on his toes to try and punch into the covers. Ends up defending it instead"
"full, angling into off and middle. Clipped to mid-on"

"looped up once more, closer to off stump this time, stretches out to defend it back to the bowler"
"shot! Down the track, lovely quick feet as he sees some flight once again, on off stump. Makes a bit of room to hit it back over the bowler's head. Didn't look to hit that too hard, just lovely flow of his hands"
"short now, on off stump, and he rocks back to cut it away to the left of the diving cover point fielder. Brings up his fifty as well. Super innings so far"
"good length now, just outside off. Gets on the front foot and clips with the turn to midwicket"
"back of a length close to off stump. Barely any width but Hendricks doesn't need too much. Perhaps the shot of the match so far, and shows how good this pitch is to bat on. A half-step forward, and a straight-bat punch to the right of backward point"
"ooh, <b>doesn't carry to slip</b>. Back of a length, gets it to straighten away in the channel. Jabs at it with a slightly open face, and the edge falls just short of Kusal Mendis at slip. He seems to have hurt his finger, the physio has come onto the field"

"back of a length outside off, opens his bat face and steers it down to third man"

loopy full-toss outside off and Hendricks misses out. Drives it powerfully but straight to short extra

"full, lots of width, but there's a man back at deep point to minimise the cost of such deliveries"
"back of a length outside off, slapped to deep point"
"ooh, extra bounce. Beats Amla's outside edge as he aims an angled-bat punch at one in the corridor. Misread the length too - it was slightly short of a good length and he was on the front foot"
"full now, and he opens his bat face to steer it down to third man"

"another bouncer, again rises over head high. Amla can't connect with the hook"

length ball angling into Amla's body. Defended firmly off the front foot
"short outside off, and Amla comfortably pulls off the back foot with the delivery's natural angle. Well hit, but deep backward square manages to get his body behind that. Shehan Jayasuriya was the man there, and he gets a cheer from the crowd for his effort"
"back of a length outside off, and he stands tall to punch through to deep point for a walking single"
"length ball outside off, and angling in sharly on this occasion. Forces an error from Amla, who misses out on the leg-side flick. Hits his stomach and flies away to the off side"

"back of a length, but wide outside off. Allows him to throw his hands at it, and he slashes a punch to deep point once again"

"good length on middle, and clipped off his hips to the fielder at fine leg. Hendricks continuing to rotate the strike"
"extra bounce outside off, forcing the batsman to tiptoe and defend back to Perera"
"offcutter on off stump, and the ball comes into Amla as he misses the pull. The delivery goes under his bat, and hits him near the knee roll. <B>Appeal for lbw, and given! But Amla reviews.</b> Replays show it hit the back leg. No bat either. Time for ball-tracking... and that's missing! Amla survives. Extra bounce saving him on this occasion."
"<b>gets him next ball!</b> Deceived by the offcutter once again. Same delivery as the last ball, and Amla tries to drive straight on this occasion. But the ball, it jags in sharply, goes between bat and pad, and clips then the top of off stump as Sri Lanka roar with delight. What a delivery. Completely owns Amla. Goes for a well-made half-century at a strike-rate of 100."

<b>almost played on!</b> Full on off and Hendricks' atttempted front-foot defense takes a inside edge and runs down to third man
"full outside off, and <b>that's a fifty on ODI debut!</b> Comfortably tapped to cover as he raises his bat to the dressing room. David Miller gives him a standing ovation"

"short on off, and Faf sways away from the line of the delivery"

"and that's the hundred - the fastest by an ODI debutant! What an innings! Back of a length, angling into his legs, and he tucks it away neatly, well into the gap to the left of the man at long leg. He's been middling it right from the time he walked in, and he's flowed on unimpeded right since"
"and then he's beaten by an absolute ripper. Where were you all along, Lahiru Kumara? Back of a length, jags back in sharply from just outside off, beats the inside edge of his attempted defensive push - his feet went nowhere because the length was just perfect - and it just about flicked the top of the leg bail"

"full on off stump, clipped away to deep square leg"
"down the track and he gets exactly the line he wants. It's on his pads, on a length, and he whips it away in the air, but into the gap to the left of deep square leg. Looked like the fielder there - Lakmal - was a little late picking it up, and didn't move to his left quickly enough"
"slower ball, back of a length, pulled to long leg"
"ooh, nearly another wicket. Fullish, slanting away from off stump, but not quite full enough for the drive. Has to reach for it, and ends up spooning it in the air, but he finds the tiniest of gaps between the diving fielders at short extra-cover and mid-off"
on the pads now and Miller flicks it away gratefully into the huge vacant spaces to the right of deep square leg
"short, rising ball on off stump. Gets on his toes and chops it down by his feet. Wanted to play that towards backward point, I think, but didn't get the connection he wanted"

"back of a length, turns from middle to off. Goes deep in his crease to whip this to long-on. Only three from the over, not a whole lot of ambition from these two batsmen barring that missed sweep"

"low full-toss on middle stump, driven to long-on"
"shot. There's that slog-sweep again. Makes hitting room by getting his front leg out of the way, and he needed all that room because it was pretty full. Then he gets down low and launches it high over wide long-on"
well done. Akila saw him switch hands for the switch-hit and bowled it wide of off (leg) stump. Sweeps it over the man at short third man and picks up four more

length ball slanting away from off stump. Shuffles across and misses the flick and the ball rolls off his back pad to the left of the diving keeper
"short on off stump and that's a fortuitous boundary for Duminy. Goes hard at this pull, and bottom-edges it to the left of the man at short fine leg"
shortish on off stump. Chopped into the backward point region for a quick single
"in the blockhole - a low, dipping full-toss, actually -  on leg stump and that's dragged away for another four. Clears his front leg and swipes hard at it, and the bottom edge races away to the right of long leg"
"down the track, giving himself room, and he lifts this leg-stump length ball just out of reach of the leaping cover fielder. That brings up South Africa's 300"

short on off stump and he clubs it away. Clears his front leg and clears the midwicket boundary with ease to move into the 90s
slower ball on off stump. Makes a bit of room and carves it to the right of the fielder at deep point. 23 off that over
"length ball slanting away from off stump. Lofts it to the left of the fielder at sweeper cover, and the fielder just about cuts it off with a sliding save"
"slower ball, full outside off. Shuffles across and clips to deep midwicket"
"full outside off, and Duminy misses out on a hundred. A splendid innings comes to an end, as he steps across his stumps and looks to swing this over the leg side. May have wanted to go a little squarer, but it was a slightly off-pace ball from Thisara, and he ends up hitting it straight down the throat of deep midwicket"
"low full-toss, slanting away from off stump. Opens his bat face and steers to third man"

length ball on middle stump and Phehlukwayo can't beat short third man with his reverse-sweep. Not enough pace on that ball from Dananjaya
"fuller, driven to long-off"
"a great over from Dananjaya. Sees Miller looking to step out and fires it at his feet, from a round-arm angle. Can only squeeze it down the ground, to the right of long-on. Jammed it into the ground and it bounced over the non-striker and umpire"
"big appeal for lbw, and that isn't given. Very full, on or just outside leg stump, and Miller plays all around it. Pitched just outside leg, I think"
"wide half-volley, and Miller plays a flat-bat drive, in the air, to the left of sweeper cover. Poor delivery"
"slower length ball on off stump, and Miller clears his front leg, waits, and whips it away over square leg. This is his 11th ODI fifty"

"length ball on off stump, slapped away hard to the left of sweeper cover"
"short outside off, carrom ball, slapped to deep point"

"quicker one, ends up sliding it down the leg side"
"full on off stump, doesn't quite get to the pitch with his lofted drive and ends up chipping on the bounce to sweeper cover"
"full on the stumps, whipped to deep square leg"
sees Phehlukwayo looking to make room and fires it wide outside off stump - too wide. Keeper fumbles and they run a bye as well
"now he bowls a wide outside off stump to the right-hander too. This is really difficult, a spinner bowling the last over against a rampant side"
"finally, lands one in the blockhole. Looks to clear his front leg and whip it away, only manages a thick inside edge into his front leg"
"length ball angling across off, left alone"

drops his length this time. Lands on middle and pushed to cover for a quick single
"<b>straight to short cover!</b> Faf makes no mistake. Full on off, and the drive pops into the infielder's hands. A couple of feet on either side and that would've been a boundary"

"good length on middle stump, and tapped to the leg side off the back foot. They scamper across for one. An entertaining over comes to a close"

"good length on middle, but the slower ball has been picked by Tharanga. Pulls over the infield, but the shot doesn't have enough behind it to go for four"
"<b>soft!</b> Off the bat's top half and Sri Lanka have now lost both openers. Short ball on middle, and the pull goes straight to square leg. Easiest of catches as Tharanga checks his bat's face on the way back to the pavillion"
"full on off, and defended off the front foot to mid off"
"<b>edged past the slip cordon!</b> Safely through to third man. A short ball outside off, for which the batsman stuck his bat out"

"and again! Short this time, outside off. Goes hard and too early at the back-foot slap, and ends up flat-batting it down the ground, into the same gap between the bowler and the non-striker. This time, in fact, Mendis has to duck at the other end to avoid the ball"
"back of a length on leg stump, worked away through square leg"
"short, rising ball gets up to shoulder-height, just outside off. KP looks to hook against the angle, can't quite middle it, but keeps it down into the square-leg region"

"length ball outside off, and Perera stands tall to slap this past cover! Some power"
"<b>slow finger of death!</b> But Perera wants to review. Has a chat with his partner, and asks for it. Was a length ball outside off, but angling into his pads, and hitting him on the back leg in front of middle stump. What does the replay say? It says 'umpire's call' with the ball clipping the top of leg stump. The decision stands, and Perera must go back!"

"full on middle, and that's a <b>picture perfect straight drive</b> down the ground for a boundary. Just to mid off's left"
"short outside off, and Perera tries to pull. Drags it from outside off, and it's in the air for ages. Faf is getting under it from square leg, but his diving effort is not good enough! But what's worse is that <i>Faf may have injured his right shoulder.</i> Out comes the physio..."

"good length on middle, and pulled along the ground to the deep midwicket boundary"
"slower ball on leg stump, and going down the leg side. Was there an edge though? QdK and Mulder think so. They're reviewing. And the South Africans were right! Spike off the UltraEdge when the ball passes the bat. Umpire Llong must change the decision! Amla and Miller also had a chat with the bowler before they went up for the review."
"full on middle stump, and defended to the leg side"

"back of a length on middle stump, clipped to deep square leg"
