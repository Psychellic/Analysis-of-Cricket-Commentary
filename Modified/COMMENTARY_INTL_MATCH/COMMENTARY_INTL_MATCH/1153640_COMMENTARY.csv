"short and angled across him. There's an appeal from the bowler, but it seemed to have brushed the shoulder at best. Good short ball, though, and Taylor took his eyes off it as he looked to take evasive action. On a pitch with variable bounce from time to time, that's a dangerous ploy."

"<strong>GONE!</strong> That's the breakthrough. He has referred it, though.The ball pitches outside off and jags back in dramatically. He hasn't gone too far forward, and there's no sign of any bat involved. It will probably stay with the on-field decision. And that is the case.

"starts on the offstump and seems to be straying down the leg side. Hits Chakabva on the pads, and they have gone for a referral for this! Pitches on off and middle, and then slants down the leg side. There's no bat involved, but it has done too much, and was missing leg-stump by a long margin"
"straighter ball, and he comes forward and defends this"
"strays on to the pads, and Chakabva plays a wristy leg-glance. The man at long leg seems to have done just enough, has he? Given a boundary, as the fielder's right arm was touching the boundary skirting as he stopped the ball"

Kayes took the bait and went for a cut without getting close enough to the ball. It's a good catch in the end, as the ball was dipping all the time. Speaking of fishing, that's the first wicket Zimbabwe have caught in their net!"

"<strong>what a ball!</strong> This pitches on middle and straightens just a bit with the angle, and Das was looking to defend it from the correct length, but just got beaten by the shape away. It clips the top of off stump, and suddenly, Bangladesh are in a spot of bother. Effectively 228 ahead, but these two early wickets mean there's some repair work to do!"
