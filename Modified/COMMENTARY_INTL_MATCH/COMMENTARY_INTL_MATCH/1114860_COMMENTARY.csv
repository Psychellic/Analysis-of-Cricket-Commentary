"Hughes misses a straight one and off stump is uprooted. Full and straight from Richardson, around off. Richardson looks to whip the ball across the line, looking to hit the ball behind square again. But with the surface area of the bat so little to meet the ball, there is always a chance of missing it. He did."
"142 kph, goes after it. It's full and wide, Roy gets his hand hands through the line of the ball, the ball slices off the outside half again and goes past backward point"
"too straight from Johnson. On the pads, nudged wide of fine leg. He runs to his left to clean up. The short boundary that side"

"132 kph, some pace off the ball, around middle and leg, chipped back to the bowler"
"has it carried? The keeper thinks he has him. The third umpire is called upon, <strong>the soft signal is out</strong>. Has it bounced? It's short down leg, off the glove as Henriques is hurried on a pull. The keeper dives low to his left, there are those uncertain replays where you never really know. That may or may not have carried, but it's going to be hard to overturn the soft signal. There is no conclusiveness to this, either way. Sticks with the soft signal does the third umpire, can't blame him. I reckon it would have stayed not out if the soft signal was not out, which begs the question if the umpires are unsure, why give a soft signal?"
