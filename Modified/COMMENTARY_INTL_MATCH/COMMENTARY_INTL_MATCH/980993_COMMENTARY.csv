Pant, who is a wicketkeeper, dives forward from point and takes it inches from the ground. The timing of the dive was good. Sharp, sharp catch, considering Pant is a keeper.

It may have come from the bat hitting the keeper's glove. Ultra Edge picks up no spike when the ball passes the bat. Ultra Edge picks up a spike when the bat hits Buttler's glove. Slider outside off, Qdk reaches out for a late cut.  Buttler pouches the ball. Last match Qdk was given out caught behind despite no signs of an edge. Last time a clicking noise came when Qdk's helmet fell onto the ground. Qdk is unfortunate, again"
