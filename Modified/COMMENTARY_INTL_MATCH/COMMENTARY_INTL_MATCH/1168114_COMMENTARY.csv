"too short first up from around the wicket, and paddled fine. Short fine leg misfields and allows a brace"
"much better line, looped up on off stump and Zazai defends"
"fired in on the pads, and he went for a big slog over cow corner but misses it"
"flatter and quicker on off stump, turning away a tad, Zazai stays in his crease and wrists it to midwicket"
"flatter on off stump, turning in a smidgeon, he stays in his crease and punches it down to long-on"
"looped up and a bit too full, Zazai slog-flicks it deep midwicket"
"digs it in short first up, but on leg stump and Zazai helps it along the way to fine leg"
"back of a length on the stumps, he swivels to pull it off his hips to deep square leg"
"back of a length on leg stump again, seems to be a plan to Zazai to deny him room to free his arms. He tickles it around the corner"
"short outside off, and he slashes it to third man"
"<b>bullet like</b> Rankin errs in length, too full and on off stump, Zazai drills it straight back past the bowler, all along the ground for four"
"and there's the Zazai we know. Fuller length again on the stumps and he clears his leg, frees his arms and sends this soaring over midwicket"
good length on the fourth stump line and punched back to the bowler
"down the track, and over the top. Ghani converts this into a half-volley almost and swings it over midwicket. Didn't get it off the middle but got enough meat on it to reach the fence easily"
"flicked off his toes that time and to the fine leg fence. Hint of movement away, but Ghani picks it up from off stump and twirls his wrists to send it fine"
tucks him up with a back of length ball outside off and he moves across to punch it to midwicket for a single
"too short and Zazai makes good connection. Swivels and pulls it to the square leg boundary. Placed it to perfection, and got a boundary"
"good comeback by the bowler, bowls an away-swinger and Zazai wants to deposit it 20 rows back over the bowler's head, but he makes connection with air only, as the ball whistles past the outside edge"
flicked off his pads to square leg
"thick outside edge flies over the slips for four. That was intentional. He didn't have any protection there, and angled it across Zazai, who slashed it up and over"
<b>wallopped</b> what power from Zazai. Stays in his crease and just sort of punch-flicks it past the bowler. That travelled fast
way outside off stump and it's a wide. Zazai should get that run because he's rattled Little
"<b>and again!</b> too wide again, trying for the wide yorker. Zazai was giving himself room but reaches out and carves this over cover. Off the middle of the bat again and flies to the fence"
stays <b>just</b> within the tramlines angling across Zazai and he lets it go. Not a wide
"repeats the ball angling well across Zazai and ending up well wide of off stump, but just inside the tram lines. Two dots to finish the over"
"<b>given lbw</b> That was a close, close call in real-time and Rankin has a wicket. It's of Ghani, but at least Ireland have broken the partnership. Good length ball that came back in a tad, and Ghani was caught on the crease, trying to whip it away. Raps him on the knee roll right in front of the stumps. It looked out on first glance, and Rankin belted out and appeal long and hard until the finger went up."
"good length ball, coming into the right-hander again. Tucks it to mid-on"
"<b>stunning shot</b> second ball he's facing, he didn't play the last match. Full ball and he lifts it over mid-on with a beautiful high elbow follow through"
<b>dismissed</b> It's like Afghanistan never lost a wicket. Length ball on the stumps and he's just whipped it over square leg
"<b>dropped by Peter Chase at short fine leg</b> back of a length and coming into the batsman, who moved inside the line and tried to help it along the way. Chase dived to his right at short fine leg and got hands to it, but dropped it."
"<b>Rankin has got the big wicket, Stirling with a great catch</b> Zazai gave himself room and tried to go over the top again, but only got a leading edge off a fullish ball that was moving away a tad. It swirls up high for miles, and Stirling runs back from mid-off and dives to hold on. He was never letting that go, he knew what an important wicket Zazai's is."
strays down leg and that will be wide
"good length angling across him from over the wicket. He tries to swing it over midwicket, but misses"
"quick ball, nipping back in, he's caught on the crease and struck on the pads. Going down leg so the appeal is only half-hearted"
nicely stroked through cover. this might be the first shot of the innings that an Afghanistan batsman has just looked to stroke the ball rather than smash the cover off it. Gets the timing perfectly and sends it purring to the fence
"good length outside off, pushed to backward point"
"good length, pitches outside off and comes back in, sneaks in past the inside edge off the batsman's uncertain prod"
too full and he comes on the front foot to punch it down the ground. Long-on runs around to field the ball
"good length, stump to stump line, tucked to square leg"
"good ball, wide outside off, has him going for the expansive drive but misses the ball. It nipped back in a tad"
"swing and a miss. Rushes down the track and wants to send him over the top, but it's another off-cutter and he misses completely"
"full ball on off stump, pushed to cover"
"back of a length, outside off, punched to mid-off. Asghar yet to get off the mark"
"fuller ball on off, he waits for it and nudges it to point's right to get off the mark and keep strike"
"tossed up outside off, pushed to cover's left for a quick single"
"flatter on off, turning away, punched to cover"
"flat and on off stump again, steered to short third man"
"<b>Balbirnie takes a good catch running in from long-on</b> after bowling flat Dockrell gave this some air. Tarakai's eyes lit up and he went for the big hit down the ground, but got it off the toe-end. It swirled in the air, giving Balbirnie enough time to run in and complete the catch near mid-on."
"given some air and angled into the pads, defended back"
"tossed up again, and he comes forward to defend, but doesn't get to the pitch of the ball. It pops up in front of him, but falls safe"
keeps it on a tight stump to stump line and Nabi can only punch it to the in-field on the off side
"goes for the wide delivery to make him reach out, but misses his line and that will be a wide outside off stump"
"goes back to stump-to-stump, bringing it back in a smidgeon from a length. Pushed to cover"
"back of a length outside off, given some room and Nabi is quick to slash it down to third man. Chase runs around from fine to put in a diving stop"
"full outside off, but not as close to the stumps as his previous few balls and Nabi able to drive it fluently through cover"
digs it in short and Asghar was prepared for it. Had moved across but was quick to transfer weight back and pull it powerfully through midwicket for a boundary
"short ball again, and Asghar nails it ever better that time. Swivels and pulls it, sending it over the man at deep square leg"
"stopped on the pitch, angled in and gripping and turning. He was too early into the shot but luckily for him, the ball didn't carry back to Dockrell"
"given some air on off, pushed to cover"
"too early into the shot again, but manages to punch it back past the bowler for a single. Dockrell almost got a hand to that, tumbling to his left"
given some air and he takes a big stride to defend
"flatter and quicker, fired in on the pads and he trickles it round the corner for  a single"
floated up on leg stump and takes the pad to roll to square leg
too full and he punch-drives it over extra cover for a four
"pulled to square leg, but off the bottom half of the bat"
"too short again and Asghar is putting those away easily. Rocks back and pulls it, putting a lot of body into the shot and finds the gap between deep square leg and deep midwicket"
"better short ball, rose higher and was quicker, went past at head height."
too far outside off and that will be a wide. Got some shape away on it but lost his line completely
"full toss on off, punched past the bowler but not with great timing"
"strays down leg and that will be another wide, second of the over"
"full on the pads, flicked off his toes to deep square leg"
"flattish outside off, driven firmly to cover"
"down the track and tries to slog-sweep it, but doesn't get hold of it. Sends it to the man at deep square leg on the bounce"
"<b>nailed</b> great use of the feet, comes down the track, gets to the pitch of the ball and swings it clean over long-on, high and handsome"
"flatter on the stumps, he stays back and punches it to long-on"
flatter again and punched to wide long-on
fired in on the pads and turned to midwicket
"<b>straight down long-off's throat</b> Asghar wanted to lift this much higher but couldn't get underneath the ball enough. It was full outside off and he went low to lift it, but ended up hitting it straight to long-off"
"fuller on leg stump, tickled around the corner"
"full ball outside off, steered to third man"
"length ball on leg stump, tries to flick it fine but it takes the pad to go to short fine leg"
"fuller outside off, and he comes forward to drive it gently to long-off"
"loud shout for lbw, but that might have pitched outside leg stump. fooled by the pace and too early into the shot, he was trying to flick it but was caught on the crease"
"flatt on off stump, driven, but a good stop by mid-off, who dives to his right to deny the batsmen a run"
worked away to deep square leg
"<b>nails the reverse sweep</b> Dockrell has been keeping it tight, this was outside the left-handers off stump but he went for the reverse sweep and beat the man at short third man"
"<b>take that</b> too full and in the batsman's arc, he stays in his crease, clears his front leg and swings it high over deep midwicket"
pushed back past the bowler for a single
"quicker and flatter on the pads, he doesn't get hold of the pull-flick, and it trickles to short fine leg for a single"
"slower ball, and ends up beating the batsman's swipe, but just too wide outside off and it will be a wide"
"<b>stunning timing</b> inside out over extra cover he goes, barely a follow through and the ball sails over the fence"
"full toss on leg stump, but beats his attempted swing that time. Gets an inside edge on to pad and rolls to short fine leg"
"good length on the stumps, he stays in his crease and pushes it to cover for a quick single"
<b>that's huge</b> picked up the slower ball and dismissed it. Too full outside off and Nabi waits for it and swings it way over long-on and well into the stands
"good comeback, gets the wide yorker right and Nabi can only drop it to his feet while trying to carve it through the off side"
you can't bowl a full toss twice in the over with fine leg up. He doesn't miss out this time and flicks it over the man inside the circle for a boundary
"<b>direct hit and he's gone</b> Dockrell's the man at midwicket. Casual running from Najibullah, who pulled it to midwicket without timing and set off. Dockrell intercepted, turned and threw down the stumps at the bowler's end in one motion. He was well short."
"short ball outside off, he tries to pull it but doesn't get hold of it. Gets it high on the bat and the ball hung in the air, but lands safely deep at square leg"
"short, given room outside off, Nabi steps away and slashes it over cover with great timing. Another boundary"
"<b>fifty for Nabi</b> stand and deliver for Nabi. Rankin dug it in short on the stumps again. Nabi steps away again, and flat-bats it over the bowler and into the sightscreen"
"<b>Nabi's unstoppable</b> brilliant, brilliant batting. This time Rankin went full, he just cleared his front leg and picked up from the stumps, driving it over the extra cover fence."
"digs it in short again, Nabi leaves it alone that time. Not a wide"
"went for the paddle from outside off, went down low, but the ball gets a bit of a thick top edge and flies right over the keeper's head for four"
"fuller outside off, driven to the man on the extra cover boundary"
"<b>monstrous</b> They spent time changing the field, but every fielder is going to be a spectator if Nabi bats like this. Full ball and he gets underneath it, lifts it straight back over the bowler"
"went for the yorker and almost nails it, but Nabi moves across and gets enough bat on it to send it fine, very fine and for another four"
"<b>walloped again</b> this was full outside off, too full. And Nabi has been sending those soaring again and again. He just repeats that, smashes it over long-off"
"yorker goes wrong, ends up as a full toss on leg stump. Nabi whips it, and so powerfully that it screams across the turf and beats the man at deep midwicket. 25 runs off that over. Whew."
"too full, driven powerfully but straight to long-off"
back of the hand slower ball. Full on middle stump. And what does Nabi do? He stays still and drills it gun-barrel straight past the bowler. Into the straight fence
"<b>caught at the edge of the deep midwicket fence</b> that had air miles on it. Full ball from around the wicket, Nabi was aiming to lift it into the stands again and almost did it. Got more height on it than distance though and Balbirnie stayed rock steady, right inside the rope and caught the ball cleanly, ensuring he didn't step over. Nabi's fantastic innings ends"
"slower ball, from the back of the hand, and he gets an under-edge to the keeper. Way too early into the shot, beautifully executed slower ball"
"this time he bowls it quicker and on the leg stump, and the batsman is too late on the whip. The ball rolls to point off pad"
"another slower ball, Rashid pushes it to midwicket but because he hadn't timed it well, they end up stealing a second"
keeps it too wide outside off and that will result in an extra. Wide ball
"he misses the wide yorker again, and that will be another wide"
"<b>pops out of Simi Singh's hands at deep midwicket</b> He tried to time his jump right, but just couldn't get it, and doesn't manage to save the six in the end. Rankin pulled his line in a bit after those wides and Shafiq was waiting. Out came the slog-sweep, didn't nail it perfectly, but got enough on it in the end to just get away."
"gets the wide yorker right that time, and has Shafiq throwing his bat at it. Gets it off the toe end and the ball only travels as far as long-off for an easy catch. They're checking for the no-ball, but Rankin looks to have just a millimetre behind so the wicket stands"
"fuller on the stumps, flicked to deep square leg"
"slower ball, fuller length outside off. He goes for an expansive drive, but doesn't connect"
"another slower ball, ends up as a full toss. He goes hard at it but without timing, sends it to long-off"
"good length outside off, pulled to deep midwicket off the bottom half of the bat"
"superb back of hand slower ball, dips on the batsman and completely beats him outside off. goes through to the keeper"
"sliced up in the air but safe. Rashid wanted to clear cow corner, but he gets a leading edge with the bat twisting in his hand. Lands in no-man's land past mid-off"
"length ball on the stumps, driven to deep cover"
"slower ball again, and Rashid gets a thick outside edge that bounces to short third man. He's really nailing these back-of-hand slower balls"
"pacier ball that time, length ball on leg stump, and Rashid punches it to deep midwicket. Refuses the single though"
"great ball to finish, pitches outside leg and hits him on the pads. He appeals but it pitched outside. They run through for a leg bye"
"back of a length outside off, and Stirling shapes up to pull. Through his shot too early, clear lack of pace"
"full just outside off, and he <b>crunches</b> a cover drive through the infield! Presses forward into the shot, and times it exquisitely for four"
"full on leg stump, and clipped off his pads to the fielder at deep backward square. A jogging single for the duo"
"back of a length just outside off, and he rides the bounce to fend towards point"
"length ball angling into his pads, and he check-pulls 'along the ground' to the leg-side fence! Whippage"
"full on middle, and flicked off his toes very fine. Ball's in the air for a while, but short fine leg can't hold on to it. Ball flies over his outstretched hands, and that's 13 runs off the opening over"
"beautiful shape first up. Full on middle from the left-handed pacer, and swaying away from the batsman. Tries to drive, but the ball goes past his outside edge to the keeper"
"length ball on leg stump, and he backs away before steering a checked shot to third man. Fielder near third man bends forward to intercept the ball, but the boots get stuck in the grass, and the ball runs away for four"
"back of a length on leg stump, with the pace taken off. Stirling's attempted pull comes off the bat's top half, and it's in the air for a while, but falls short of Rashid at midwicket"
"length ball on leg stump, and clipped off his hips to square leg for a quick single"
"full on middle, slower ball again. Tapped off the front foot to cover, and they scamper across for one"
"length ball on leg stump, and angling across the right-hander. He can't connect with the straight drive, and the ball's through to the keeper"
"full on middle, but angling down leg. The keeper gets his body behind the ball to intercept"
"<b>hammered!</b> Length ball angling in, and he waits for the ball to come to him, before drilling a pulled shot into cow corner"
"length ball on middle, but going down leg again. O'Brien tries to flick it square, but can't get the contact"
"length ball on off again, and once again O'Brien settles onto the back foot, before check-pulling to the cow-corner boundary. In control, off the bat's sweet spot"
"length ball just outside off, and the off-side tap comes off the bat's inside half. Rolls away to the leg side as they scamper across for the single"
"full on off, and he presses forward to defend with the bat's straight face. Played back to the bowler"
"full on off, and he clears his front leg to clear the infield. Plays a lofted straight drive, but he's toe-ended the shot, and the debutant earns his maiden wicket. Taken by Asghar at mid-on"
"overpitched just outside off, and Balbo mistimes a drive to cover. Can't get off the marks"
"full on leg stump, and driven with the left-arm spinner's angle to long on"
"length ball, just outside off, and he rocks back, makes room, and then cuts this square past point for a boundary!"
"length ball angling into him again, and this time he plays a late cut - steered very late - to pierce the gap between gully and short third man!"
"length ball on off, and cut off the back foot to cover point"
"length ball on off, but some extra bounce surprises the batsman. Fended off the back foot on this occasion"
"length ball on off stump, and he covers his off stump, before defending from behind the crease"
"<b>sweet!</b> Full on middle, and that's been lifted right over the bowler's head for a beautiful boundary. Holds his shot for the shutterbugs"
"full on off, and the ball's going away from him. Tries to drive, but outside edge takes it down to third man instead"
"full on off, and the attempted cover drive is spliced towards the off side"
"length ball on leg stump, and pushed to cover point for a single. Slight hesitation for the single, and the throw from the fielder gets a direct hit! Balbirnie looks safe, and the TV umpire agrees"
"full on middle, and he chips a straight drive to mid-off for a single. Nearly takes the non-striker with him there!"
"length ball on middle, and he backs away to cut. Deceived by the lack of pace, and the under-edge takes the ball towards fine leg. Zia, the debutant, dives near the boundary, but he can't clear it cleanly. Another four from his misfield"
"length ball outside off, and turning away from the right-hander. He stays on the back foot, and lifts a back-foot punch over extra cover. Exquisite"
"full on middle, and sliding down leg. O Brien can't connect with the flick"
"full on off, and nudged away to the fielder at square leg. Misfielded, but Ireland choose not to run"
"length ball on off, skidding inwards. Punched past short cover to wide mid off"
"<b>sliced over the infield!</b> Full on middle, and he opens the bat's face as he tries to drive square. Enough behind the shot to clear the infield, and the fielder at point gives it a chase"

"full on middle, and defended towards the leg side"
"full on middle, and driven down the ground to long on for a walking single"
"full on middle, and driven down the ground to long on once again"
"length ball on leg, but skidding into the kepeer's gloves. They appeal for caught-behind, but not given. But in that distraction, the umpire does not call that a wide either. Smart from Afghanistan!"
"length ball wide outside off, and punched off the back foot to wide long off. The fielder runs around the boundary to intercept"
"full just outside leg stump, and clipped away to deep backward square. Rashid cleans up"

"full on leg stump, and the attempted sweep is mistimed to fine leg"
"arm ball, short and wide outside off. He toe-ends a cut-shot to cover"
"length ball just outside off, but the delivery stays low. Bends his knees to cut, but the shot finds point"
"length ball, wide outside off, and cut off the back foot to point"
"full on middle, and tapped with soft hands to midwicket. Could've been a tight run had midwicket collected the ball in one motion"
"length ball on middle, and he backs away to punch. Ball holds it's line, so KoB needs to adjust. Bunted down the ground to long on for one"
"full on middle, and steered away to short third man. Nice, early call for a single"
"full on leg stump, and punched down the ground to long on. Walks across to the other end, but doesn't celebrate despite <b>his fifty!</b> Means one thing: O'Brien wants to finish this game off"
"length ball, just outside off, and he makes room before cutting past backward point for another boundary to end the over"

"full on leg, and driven down the ground to long on for a single"
"back of a length, really wide outside off, and slapped down to wide mid-off for one"

"full on off, and <b>swept</b> hard to deep midwicket"
"length ball on middle, and punched down the ground to long off for another single"
"<b>dropped</b> at deep backward square! Shirzad makes a mess of it. Quicker ball outside leg stump, and the attempted slog-sweep found the fielder. Ball pops out of his hand and that gives the set KoB another life"
"full on middle, and driven down the ground to long on for a single"
"full on middle, and he muscles a sweep to deep backward square once again. This time... along the ground"

"length ball angling in, and the attempted pull is inside-edged onto his body. Ball dribbles away to the leg side as Balbirnie tells O'Brien to take the single"
"<b>crunched inside out over cover!</b> Balbirnie's making some moves now. Backs away before the bowler delivers the ball, the delivery lands on middle, and Balbirnie absolutely hammers a lofted drive to the extra-cover boundary"
"<b>slower ball does the trick!</b> Big wicket. Full just outside off, but the slower ball deceives the batsman. He presses forward to defend, but he's playing outside the ball's line. Big gap between bat and body, and the ball sneaks through"
"full just outside off, and he backs away before cutting to point. Stopped by the fielder"
"<b>direct hit!</b> But it's Thompson whose gone, and not o'Brien. The batsman had slapped a shot to point and gone for the single, but the fielder at point stops the ball, then aims at the stumps, and Zadran's throw finds the stumps at the batsman's end"

"length ball outside off, and the legbreak is muscled down to long off for one"
"full on off, and he drags a slog sweep to the leg side. Usman's running across the boundary there, but his one-handed parry can't pull the ball back. Another disappointing fielder effort from Afghanistan's outfielders"
"full on off, and the wrong-un is pulled along the ground to deep midwicket"
"length ball outside leg stump, and spinning further down the leg side. O Brien misses the flick, but so does the keeper. Chase for fine leg running across the boundary"
"full on middle, and he hammers a flat-batted shot to long on for one"
"full on leg stump, and he drags a pull to cow corner for a walking single"
"<b>finger goes up!</b> Full and wide outside off, and O'Brien makes room to drive. Ball turns away from him, and that's taken a slight toe-end off his bat. Keeper holds on, and the umpire raises his finger. O'Brien gave his wicket away by looking at the keeper after missing shot. Umpires often catch on to those signs. Huge, huge wicket"
"full and wide outside off, and the attempted straight drive comes off the bat's inside-half. It rolls away to long on"
"full just outside off, and he drills a straight drive to long off"
"nearly a yorker on off stump. He drigs a straight drive to long on for a single. They want two, but Zadran's effort in the deep ensures it's just a single"

"full ball on middle, and he bunts this down to long on once again. Just the one run"
"full just outside off stump, and he muscles a drive to wide long-on again. Nabi finishes with 0 for 28"
"<b>what a screamer! Nabi, you beauty!</b> Full just outside off, and the batsman slog sweeps towards wide long-on. Has six written all over it, but Nabi jumps near the ropes, takes the catch, throws it in the air as he's falling over the boundary, then composes himself and eventually completes a 360-degree take."
"length ball on off, and the wrong'un comes into Getkate. The batsman's come half-way down the wicket, and the ball has sneaked under his bat. Keeper does extremely well staying low and collecting the ball, and then whips the bails off to hand Rashid another scalp. Shafiq excellent behind the stumps too. <b>Hat-trick!</b>"
"<b>double hat-trick!</b> Length ball on off, and the googly skids inwards. Misses the leg-side flick, and the ball hits his knee roll. Rashid's appealing for lbw, and the umpire raises his finger. As easy as A-B-C"
"full on middle, and he walks across the stumps to try and sweep. Misses the ball completely, and the delivery just sneaks past leg stump as well. Could've had five in five, but just slightly inaccurate"
"length ball just outside off, and defended towards cover"
"full on middle, and pushed down to long on for a single. Direct hit from mid-on means that Ireland can pinch another single"

"length ball, just outside off, and he can't connect with the googly. Through to the keeper"
