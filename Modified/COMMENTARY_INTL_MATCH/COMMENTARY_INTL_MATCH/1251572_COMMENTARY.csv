"starts off with one slightly wide of the legside. Bit of shape on the ball, though"
this one's on the money. Length ball that looked to cramp the batsman up. Defended
"slightly overpitched, and Markram's away with a little flick to midiwcket"
"through the gap between bat and pad, <strong>de Kock looked late on it</strong>. Enthusiastic appeal from Shaheen, but it always looked high"
defended with more assuredness this time
crisp drive back to the bowler
square cut to the fielder to round out a tidy first over
"a little away movement, starts off relatively sedate at 83mph - or 133 kph if you're into that sort of thing"
"cranking through the gears, 135 this time. Pushes Markram onto the back foot to block"
reared up slightly from a length. Markram was a little awkward trying to deal with that one
"shaping away from a fourth stump line, Markram knew he wanted to leave that immediately"
no timing on that back foot punch. South Africa struggling to post any runs on the board for now
<strong>maiden over first up</strong>. Excellent start from Pakistan here
driven back to Shaheen
slightly shorter length this time pushes the batsman back
<strong>off and away - finally</strong>. Gets a bit of length and QdK just leans into a drive and crunches it through extra cover
"didn't really get on top of it, but from the moment he saw that banged in short, he committed to pulling it over the on-side infield. Gets a couple"
tucked him up nicely with a length ball around the fourth stump
"too much width again and de Kock pounces once more, carving it through the covers. The cover fielder put in a valiant dive but doesn't really have a chance of preventing that going for four"
defended from Markram
driven down to mid-on. Hasnain's on the money with his lines first up
"140 kph this time, a touch too full, driven back to the bowler"
""
"<strong>finally Hasnain is put away</strong>. Little wrong with the ball, but Markram's beautiful backfoot drive guides it through the covers. First runs off Hasnain's bowling"
""
"length ball that de Kock gets an inside edge on, almost carried onto the stumps"
"there's a bit more intent from him, though. A bit wider and he looked to power it though the covers once more. Finds the fielder this time"
"stepped away, made some room and looked toc carve it through that region once more, but found the cover-point fielder"
"<strong>whoa, that's glorious!</strong> Takes a couple of steps forward, Shaheen bangs it in short but de Kock hooks it over fine leg - it goes all the way"
"a bit of confusion with the running, just a little flick of the wrists to midwicket, never a single and no harm done, really"
"not from the middle but there's enough power off the bat to take it back past Shaheen, beat mid-on and go all the way for four. 14 off the over, and <strong>South Africa's start suddenly looks decent</strong>"
"sliced to backward point, a metre either side and it was another boundary. But can Hasnain regain some control again?"
worked away to midwicket
"that might be the shot of the day so far. Same sort of delivery, but Markram leans into a straight drive, perfect slicing the gap between the bowler and mid-off. Sweetly off the middle, and it scuttles away"
"<strong>another four!</strong> First time Hasnain's offered a touch too much width, and Markram's glorious punch through extra cover fetches South Africa another four runs"
"Hasnain's answer is to go short. Well directed bouncer, really. Markram happy to let it go"
"rapped on the pads, much too high but Hasnain asks the question anyway, perhaps stung by the treatment he's received this over"
"made some room and tried to smash it over the top. Swing and a miss, though"
"<strong>QdK's aggression finally brings about his downfall</strong>. Went for a similar shot to the last time, but there was no timing on it and it went straight to Babar Azam at mid-off. Pakistan get a wicket they had begun to look like they needed"
jabbed to cover-point
"<strong>he takes full advantage of the free hit</strong>. Clears the front leg and biffs that over square leg, comfortably clearing the man in the end. Second six for South Africa"
"is that taken? Markram looks to have chipped it to mid-on, who's very much claiming the catch. <strong>The soft signal is out.</strong>  Yep, there's little evidence to conclusively overturn this, and Shaheen's suddenly <strong>removed both openers in an over</strong>"
"angling back it to van der Dussen. Looked like an lbw candidate for a moment, but gets bat to it first"
blocked to see out an immensely successful over for Pakistan
"a bit of width, and the new batsman Bavuma is happy to let it go"
"a touch too straight, Bavuma gets himself off the mark with a little tickle to fine leg"
"struck on the pads but it looked like it was sliding down. Hasnain's had a couple of these optimistic shouts, but Pakistan have (wisely) held fire on the reviews for now"
""
"<strong>and that's a soft, soft way to get out</strong>. Banged in short, and Bavuma guides it straight down third man's throat. No real conviction, just a dab down to Shaheen Afridi, who seems everywhere at the moment That was as close to catching practice as you'll see in a match. South Africa lose their captain, and they're suddenly all over the place."
"<strong>another one! Klaasen goes first delivery. If that's an inside edge, and I suspect it is, that's plumb. Klaasen reviews instantly</strong> Yeah, that's an inside edge, so the South African survives"
defended into the onside
"a little bit of shape back in, kept out by van der Dussen"
blocked again. South Africa look like they'll have to rebuild all over again
blocked once more
"<strong>that's been put down, though it was an extremely difficult chance</strong>. A thick outside edge that flew wide of second slip, the position from where Asif Ali launched himself to the right. Got a hand to it, but couldn't quite hang on."
another maiden
a touch short at 138 kph. Nicely zipped off the pitch. Klaasen happy to defend
tailing back in and clips him on the top off the pad
"crisply struck back down the ground, Hasnain gets a hand on it to stop that running away"
a little slice to point. The runs have dried up entirely now
"ran his fingers over that one, and the batsman couldn't quite time it"
"<strong>third maiden in ten overs for South Africa</strong>. And now over to Vishal, who takes over for the next ten"
"good bounce first up, just outside off and makes the batsman hop on the back foot"
"another short ball around off, steered to point and they get one because the fielder can't hold on to it"
"134kmh, brings this one in from length towards the stumps and Klaasen blocks it back"
"nice and tight again just outside off, good bounce and Klaasen defends it to mid-on"
slightly fuller on the stumps this time and Klaasen taps it back. Still not off the mark
more towards the middle stump and he taps it to midwicket. Another good over for Pakistan
"oh, wonderful shape away from the batsman first up! Beats him with an away swinger at 145kmh, van der Dussen pokes and misses"
"fuller and tighter towards the stumps, van der Dussen defends on off this time"
"some away movement again outside off, he lets it go this time"
Punches the back of length ball to cover-point off the back foot
"Touch fuller, driven with a forward lean and van der Dussen finds the gap nicely by just beating mid-off, who gives up on the chase without a dive"
"Shorter and more towards middle and let, he works it towards deep midwicket with soft hands and calls for two immediately. They were going to settle for one but a misfield gets them the second"
"stifling line outside off, no room and he defends it back"
similar line and length and he punches it back to the bowler with hard hands
beats him a little bit with the movement outside off and he gets a thick edge to point
"<b>beaten comprehensively this time</b>! Good length outside off with decent bounce, Klaasen wants to punch it with hard hands but misses it completely"
errs down the leg side for a wide as Klaasen goes across a little bit
"on length and outside off, he drives it gently to cover"
no he doesn't. Straighter ball to end the over and Klaasen taps it back. <b>17 balls without a run for Klaasen</b>
just about withdraws his bat from that shot he was about to play for the ball in the corridor outside off
"back of length on middle and leg, and he works it behind square on the leg side for one"
"nips it in with good bounce, Klaasen brings his bat down perhaps a tad late and gets a thick inside edge onto his pad"
<strong>he's off the mark on his 19th ball</strong> with a tickle down to fine leg for one
"just outside off, not much room, and he defends it back"
rare loose delivery on the pads and he flicks it away for two towards deep midwicket
slightly full on the stumps and he dries it down to mid-on
"<strong>edged to the keeper</strong>! Back of length outside off, good bounce, and Klaasen wanted to cut off the back foot with hard hands, gets an outside edge and it's an easy catch for Rizwan"
"132kmh, around the off stump, Miller stays back and taps it on the off side"
"<strong>loud appeal for lbw</strong> as Miller is beaten on the flick, the umpire doesn't move because the full delivery probably pitched outside leg. He was struck right in front of leg stump, and yes, replays confirm it pitched outside leg. Babar was tempted to review it though"
slightly straighter and Miller defends it back this time
overpitched and he drives that beautifully in the gap between cover point and extra cover to caress that all along the ground with a forward lean for a welcome four for SA
"139kmh, holds its line a bit outside off, tapped to point off the back foot"
"<b>leading edge falls safe before third man</b>! The bounce was as expected but van der Dussen closed the face of the bat too early for the incoming delivery and the ball took the shoulder of the bat to fly over the backward point region, and fell safe"

"angling across, Miller watches it all the way into the keeper's hands"

"Bit wide outside off again, he runs it down to third man"

on the pads and Miller can't clear midwicket
similar line but slightly shorter on the hips and he helps it down to fine leg for one
slightly full and the batsman taps it back to the bowler
soft hands again as van der Dussen pushes the ball into the covers
"nice and tight to end the over just outside off, van der Dussen leans forward and blocks it back"
"<strong>cracking cut</strong> from Miller to lift South Africa a little bit! Short of length, enough width to free his arms and he does so in style to send that crashing behind point for four"
"144kmh, outside off again and driven into the covers this time"
"142kmh, bangs in the bouncer and the batsman doesn't move much. Called wide for the height"
"<strong>beaten outside off</strong> with the bounce! Short of length outside off, Rauf's action extracting some bounce and it goes over the batsman's bat"
"second wide of the over, this one swung away a fair bit outside off"
"125kmh, takes some pace off it and lands it on good length, van der Dussen defends it back"

"carries on with the line first up, a little tickle to the onside"
"a little slower, Miller happy to play the waiting game for now"
worked to the onside
"gets down on one knee and spoons it over the keeper. Square leg had plenty of work to do to cut it off as it went so fine, and it allows them to get three"
"a bit more air, driven back to Shadab"
opens the face and keeps the strike on the offside with a single
"takes a bit of pace off first up, defended to the offside"
"bangs it in short, chipped to square leg for one"
"length ball, Miller gets on top and blocks"
"lets this one go. Shaheen appears to be the man they'll respect, which I suppose puts a bit more pressure on Shadab at the other end"
"knee high full toss, a bit of shape in. He could have worked it away, but it might just as easily have missed the inside edge, and lbw would have been in play"
poked into the offside to finish off the over
"nicely flighted, driven back to the bowler"
"generous full toss that he really should have smacked out of the park. That single feels like a win for Pakistan, though it took good work in the field from Pakistan to keep it that way"
nudged into the onside
"rocks back and slices it past backward point, absolutely races away for four"
driven to long-off for a single. Partnership approaching 50
"slightly short, van der Dussen gets a single to keep the strike for the third consecutive over"
"slower bouncer, scooped up into the air halfway up to fine leg. Lands safely"
"full toss, but driven to mid-off where a fielder collects"
"targeting top of off, angling in from around the wicket. Probing delivery"
"a little nudge to the onside, and he calls his teammate across for a sharp single. Shaheen doesn't look like he wanted Miller off strike"
"bangs it in short, and he lets it go"
"driven through the covers, but smart work ensures it's a dot delivery"
charges down the ground and gets a single to mid-on
"guided to mid-off, and <strong>that brings up a handy 50-run partnership</strong>"
sends this down legside just a tad
nudged into the onside and the pair ecchange ends

carved away to the offside
tucked away  and they only get a single courtesy a little slip from Miller
opens the face and runs it to sweeper cover
a little nudge down to the onside off a length
"picked up off the pads and worked to fine leg. The fielder was a bit lazy getting to it, and Miller pushes hard and gets himself back on strike"
defended into the onside
"a little tickle down to the onside. A bit of a holding pattern here, with Pakistan content to let this happen, it almost appears. South Africa's rebuild going all right for now"
"slice to backward point, smart work from Imam keeps it to a dot ball"
nudged into the onside for one
"banged in short and van der Dussen gets on top early, guiding it past the man at midwicket and picking up four. Loose from Shadab, sharp from South Africa"
"a bit slower, driven back to him"
rolls his wrists over it and picks up a single to mid-off
a little dabble into the onside
opens the face but only gets it straight to short third
comes around the wicket to Miller and angles it in. Batsman is circumspect about it
angled to short third man
dead bats it and comes through for a quick single
"banged in short, he tried to hook it away, but only manages a bottom edge onto his pads"
"goes for the bouncer, but it's too short and consequently too high for the umpire's liking"
"short and wide and it receives the treatment. Latches on to the loose ball, and van der Dussen slices it past backward point, with enough conviction on the shot to let it race away and beat the man in the deep"
rapped on the pads but that one's tailing down leg
"that was all a bit odd. Miller wanted to spoon it over Rizwan, don't believe he got any bat, but it beats Rizwan too and fine leg had to hurry to cut it off before it hit the rope. All told, it's four wides"
"long hop but Shadab escapes serious punishment. van der Dussen tried to repeat the same shot as the previous over, but the fielder's better positioned this time"
nurdled into the onside for one
crunched to sweeper cover
"full toss, he dances down the ground and absolutely belts it back. Shadab does extremely well to get his fingers to it, and if it had trickled onto the stumps, van der Dussen was gone"
helps himself with a single down to fine leg
"thwacked to short extra, another loose delivery he gets away with"
"a touch of width, crunched through the offside and South Africa pick up a couple"
tucked into the onside
crisply struck through the offside. Both looking very confident with their timing now
"nice line, no room to work it away. Miller forced to defend"

just outside off and he taps it behind point
on the pads and helped to midwicket for one
leans forward and pushes this length ball to cover
similar length and pushed to cover again
"slower, shorter and wider outside off, struck straight to cover again"
straighter line from wide of the crease and he drives it down to long-off for one
"tight outside off, van der Dussen gets a thick inside edge to midwicket"
"only 128kmh, but <b>beaten outside off</b>! Scrambled seam outside off, good bounce with the zippy action and a hint of away movement beats the outside edge"
"<b>that's struck van der Dussen</b> around the knee off the edge. The ball kept a tad low and the back-foot punch hit him, but nothing wrong there"
towards the pads this time and he helps it along to fine leg for two
"short and slightly wide outside off, he lets it go"
plays on the up past point and they do well to come back for the quick second run because the throw gets some extra bounce after it lands in front of Rizwan
comes down and drives this into the covers for one
leans towards the ball and pushes to cover
shouts of 'catch it' as <strong>van der Dussen reaches his 50</strong> with a cut off the back foot for the short and wide ball that beat point
"<strong>a total mix up out there between the batsmen and Pakistan have missed a run-out opportunity</strong>! van der Dussen reverse swept to short third man and took off, but Miller didn't, then van der Dussen stopped and Miller took off, and eventually both were almost face to face towards the striker's half of the pitch and the fielder at short third man threw at the keeper's end but Miller had made it there by then, and then Rizwan threw the ball to the bowler's end bit it hit van der Dussen"
towards the pads and Miller helps it behind square for one
"just outside off, driven to sweeper cover"
not much room outside off and he taps the ball to point
some width this time and it's punched to deep point
"hint of room outside off with the angle and Miller steers it to deep point, and that's a <strong>vital fifty for him</strong>, off just 52 balls when SA were in trouble"
"nipping in a bit towards off, defends it to point"
"a slow bouncer at 120kmh, van der Dussen is early into the pull and gets an edge towards the keeper"
shortish outside off now and he punches to deep point
shuffles across and turns the ball to midwicket
"goes across again and sweeps that in the gap behind square on the leg side, big gap there and he finds it with a sweep against the turn"
slower outside off now and he drives it down to long-off
dances down but Danish does well to pull the length back and then dive to his left to stop the drive
more towards the pads now and Miller finds square leg
opens up on the back foot and punches it to cover
back of length ball around the stumps and he defends off the back foot
"really smart placement by van der Dussen for a four! Short ball angled towards his ribs, he just hangs back and pulls with good timing, not much power and uses the pace of the ball to get four to the long leg boundary"
"Short and slightly wide outside off, he lets it go"
"Short again, this time towards the stumps and he pulls it to midwicket"
Width outside off and steered to deep point easily
"Haris Rauf gets the big wicket of David Miller and boy, is he pumped! Angles it across the batsman, who pokes at the delivery which didn't bounce as much, and Rizwan does well to dive to his left as the ball was dipping on him after the edge. Rauf celebrates with his dual fists and lets out a roar"
"some flight outside off and hint of turn, he lets it go"
goes across and drives this one with the turn into the covers
"he goes back and is surprised by the bounce, defends it back"
"goes back and across again for the wrong'un, pushed into the off side for one"
too much width and van der Dussen steers this past point and calls for two quick runs
"stifled appeal for lbw as van der Dussen goes a fair bit across for the sweep and is struck low on the back leg, but outside the line of off stump"
"cracked away for four! Slightly short and wide, room to free his arms and Phehlukwayo crashes that away over the point region for four"
"tighter line outside off, he stays still and steers it to point"
drives with a forward lean and gets a thick outside edge to third man
runs this down to third man for one more
beats him outside off as the batsman pokes and misses
taps this one off the hips to midwicket for one
well down the leg side for a wide
"flighted and full on leg, driven back to the bowler"
that's poor bowling - another wide down the leg side
"on middle and leg, and flatter, bit too quick for the batsman"
on the pads and he flicks it straight to midwicket
defends the wrong'un towards off and is sent back after pushing it towards cover
"Shadab appeals for caught behind and that was nearly another wide down leg, but got some pad on the way"
presses forward and blocks the length ball. Just the two wides from the over
"short ball towards leg, he pulls and gets enough on that one to beat Rizwan fine on the leg side for four"
another short ball and it lobs off van der Dussen's glove towards fine leg
length ball and he drives it down to mid-off
touch wider and Phehlukwayo finds point this time
into the pads and he flicks it nicely over the midwicket region for one
a single to end the over as the batsman works this to midwicket
steps onto the front foot and leans into an off drive

opens the face and angles it to sweepr cover. South Africa content with the singles for now
""

"rolled his fingers over that one, poked to backward point"
"loose delivery, he had the chance to leather it through the covers, but only finds a fielder"
"defended, and this concludes another brilliant over for Pakistan"
"85mph first up, angling in. Driven back to the bowler"
"sliced through the offside for another single, and that's 200 up for South Africa"
"around the wicket, and that's a harmless little drive to mid-off"
"<strong>finally, a boundary</strong>. Uses his feet to attack Hasnain and finds the gap between cover-point and cover. Gets clean connection off the bat and it races away"
"88mph, full into Phehlukwayo. Driven back and the young bowler has a shy at the batsman's stumps. More out of frustration than opportunity"
"low full toss, guided to mid-off. He keeps the strike with a sharo single that requires a dive"
"low full toss first up from Shaheen, he gets in line and biffs it wide of long-on. The man there puts in a dive <strong>but touches the rope while handling the ball</strong>. Perfect start to the over for South Africa"
another low full toss that he smashes back over the bowler's head for a couple
"made room for himself and looked to clear the infield once more. Thick inside edge and it really should have just been a single, but really sloppy fielding from Hasnain. Slips through his fingers and it's another four"
"full toss - very high full toss, perilously close to being a no-ball. They come through for a single, and a direct hit would have had him"
defended back down the ground
comes around the wicket and sends in a low full toss. van der Dussen guides it to long on and picks up the 12th run of the over
comes across and looks to target the onside boundary. Hasnain wavers in his line and sends it down the legside
"clever bowling. Went wider of the off stump and van der Dussen wasn't really in position to handle that. He's beaten, and that's a ]dot ball."
"<strong>that was in the slot, and he knows how to punish it</strong>. Cleared the front leg, sat and waited for this ball, which he commandingly deposits into the grass banks over long-on"
"<strong>in the slot again, this is poor from Hasnain</strong>. He moves across and smears it through the midwicket region, beating both fielders in the deep and picking up four more"
runs it down to deep cover and he's content to give his partner the last two balls
"straighter, not giving him any room, and it's driven down the ground for one"
opens the face but finds backward point. Dot to end an over that otherwise went for 13
"wide yorker, squeezed to third man for one. Right, Rassie on strike, Rassie on 96"
"comes around the wicket and wide off the crease. Yorker length, can only get it to midwicket"
"takes the pace off it, and van der Dussen pokes it to the offside. Three away from a hundred now - is he thinking about it?"
"has an almighty heave, but the low full toss has enough on it to only allow a single"
"runs his fingers over the ball, and he's happy to take a single for now"
"yorker, perfect yorker. Doesn't get near it and that's a glorious over to rein South Africa back in a little"
punched into the offside and they take a single. They pushed for two but Phehlukwayo wisely sends him back or he'd be run out for 99
"<strong>takes the piece off and Haris breaks another partnership</strong>. Chipped just in front of cover, where Shadab leaps forward and snares it before it hits the ground."
single first up gets Rassie - on 99 - back on strike
"<strong>there it is</strong>! The man who's exploded onto the international scene gets his first OD hundred. It's been a long-time coming, and it's so well deserved. Gives his teammate a quick hug but knows there's still business to be done"
chipped back down the ground for a single
"smears it to midwicket but he hasn't timed it. <strong>It's caught on the boundary but the fielder knew he was overbalancing and threw the ball back inside. </strong>He's done well not to touch the rope and save five runs, but that wicket would have been great to get"
"another swipe to the onside, just a single though, which is a result for Pakistan"
"a crisp drive to cover, but the fielder cuts it off"
<strong>stand and deliver!</strong> Clobbers him over mid-off and it's a one bounce four. Rabada showing the fireworks won't just come from the other end
no timing on another slog down the ground. Just a single
"moved across the stumps and swipes it away to cow corner, the area he likes so much. Good running and an errant throw mean it's an easy couple"
"banged it in short, and he keeps the strike with a guided shot to fine leg"
"they're feeding him the length and line he favours. In the slot outside off stump, and <strong>he clobbers it over cow corner all the way over the ropes</strong>. Perfect start to the over"
goes a little too wide outside off stump
clipped back to long-on
makes plenty of room but he follows him. Swing and a miss
a single down to mid-off
full outside off and Rassie picks it up and belts it over mid-off for four. That was crrrunched! And he shows it's not just the onside where he can pick up boundaries
flicked to cow corner for a single
"slower ball, he gets across and <strong>just helps it past short fine leg and picks up four!</strong>"
"fierce yorker that he can only deflect away for one. A little bobble causes a misfield, but they can't quite come back for two"
"waist high full toss, driven to mid-off for a single"
"slower bouncer, turned away to square leg for just a single. Rassie looks a little out of breath"
"slower ball, but Rabada tries to heave it away instead of getting van der Dussen on strike. Completely missed it though"
"maybe he knew what he was doing. <strong>Crunching cover drive to end the innings</strong>, and South Africa have managed to put up 273!"
"good bounce first ball for this back of length delivery just outside off, Imam lets it go"
"fuller and straighter, Imam shows the straight bat and drives it down to mid-off"
"fullish on middle and leg with some movement, Imam gets into an awkward position but gets off the mark by pushing it down the ground"
"muted appeal for lbw because it pitched outside leg, Fakhar can't get any bat on it"
"139kmh, good bounce, nearly takes the shoulder of the bat before running down to third man"
"141kmh, pretty wide outside off, survives the wide call"
"137kmh, leaves the length ball alone as it angles away with some bounce"
short of length and clipped past square leg for two off the hips
punched off the back foot with hard hands but finds point
"tight on the off stump, he defends it back off the back foot"
short ball and he's pulled that away nicely along the square side of the pitch with a pivot on the back foot
back to outside off and he runs it down to third man for one
"136kmh, he wants one after tapping this to midwicket but is sent back by Imam"
"beaten outside off! Perfect ball from Rabada - outside off with the angle, good pace and bounce, and beats the outside edge but some distance"
"tad closer to the off stump, Fakhar leaves it alone this time"
"<strong>chops it on</strong>! Rabada's close line and persistence have worked. It's the angle outside off, the pace and the no-footwork chop from Fakhar which sends the inside edge crashing onto the stumps"
"outside off on length, Babar moves his front foot just a bit and defends with a straight bat"
on the back foot this time and Babar waits for the ball to come to him before defending again
"136kmh, pitched up at good pace outside off, Imam leaves it"
"tight around off stump, Imam keeps his head down and defends to mid-off"
"138kmh, towards the hips and he works it down to fine leg for one"
"<strong>yorker at 139kmh</strong>, a watchful Babar digs it out"
short outside off and Babar runs it down to third man to get off the mark
solid defence from Imam to end the over as he blocks the length ball on off stump
straight on the stumps and he pushes it down to mid-on
"stifling line on off, he stays back and defends to cover-point"
"143kmh, strays down the leg side for a wide"
"136kmh, back of length and he punches it down to mid-off"

"length ball and a punchier drive, but straight to mid-off again"

Babar drove on the up, got a thick edge that flew towards third man but Aiden Markram is placed there precisely for this shot and he dives to his right full length as the ball dips and he even gets a hand to it, but can't hold on to it.

starts on middle and leg and Imam uses his whip wrists to work it towards deep backward square leg for two

"sharp turn from Shamsi, Imam had to be cautious when defending"

"adjusts his line, forcing Imam back, but he gets off strike. Smart cricket"
tickled to fine leg
defended to midwicket
"cracked back down the ground and it bursts through Nortje's hands. A little sloppy from the bowler, both with the full toss and the fielding, and Pakistan pick up four"

little drive back down the ground and they scamper through for one

"banged in short at 87 mph, but Rizwan gets on top of it and works it down to midwicket"
"<strong>and Nortje gets a third - this is damaging for Pakistan!</strong> Short ball grew big on Danish, who could only get an edge through to de Kock behind the stumps. Searing pace, not the sort Danish will have faced much of until today."
