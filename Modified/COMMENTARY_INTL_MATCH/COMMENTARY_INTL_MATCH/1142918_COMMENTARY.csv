"caught behind first ball! Comes out braving the cold, goes back for an early coffee. #SmallMercies. Australia, meanwhile, are elated. Stanlake pitches it up outside off, has Zhuwao chasing after it. Normally, that would have screamed through the cover point boundary. But in this case - because of the lack of footwork - he just nicks through"
"back of a length and outside off, leaves it. Hint of awayswing in the air for Stanlake"
struck on the body as Masakadza looks to flick a shortish delivery angled into him
draws him into a lazy old drive and that away swing - that very late away swing - takes it past the outside edge. Stanlake's looking mean today. #WhatElseIsNew?
looks for the blockhole now and Masakadza brings down a straight bat to save himself
"good length ball on middle, defends stoutly"
"knocks it down gently straight of midwicket for a single. That's more like it. Mire playing close to the body, covering the line of a ball angled into middle"
"pokes outside the off stump as Richardson hits a fuller length. Masakadza is stuck in the crease but his hands lunge out to meet the ball. Soft hands though, which is good"
"<b>dropped</b> by the debutant! Jack Wildermuth tries to get under the skier at third man as Masakadza slogs wildly. The back of a length ball leaps off the top edge and starts to dip as it nears the fielder. Wildermuth has committed to take it reverse cup and even ends up diving forward in a desperate attempt to pull it off. In the end, it pops out. Really should have taken it the normal way"
"fuller delivery on middle, he turns it into the leg side"
hangs back and flicks a shortish delivery through midwicket
"angles a short of a good length delivery in at off stump, Masakadza plays late, chopping it to point for a quick single"
"goes short and Masakadza hoicks it through midwicket. Powerful strike. Standing tall, telling the bowler who's boss"
"another one that he digs into the pitch, this one coming up towards Masakadza's chest. The batsman pulls, gets struck on the glove, and as the ball wanders to square leg, he slinks through for a single"
<B>rippper</b>! It beats Mire's outside edge and goes hunting for the off stump. Prey escapes predator by the smallest margin as the ball bounces just over it. Sensational stuff from Stanlake. Hitting the deck on middle and getting late away movement
"full on middle, Mire blocks to cover"
"bang! Straight over the top! Mire's got quality. And he shows it by picking Stanlake's fuller length, striding confidently forward and smacking him over mid-on. An outstanding shot!"
"shortish and outside off, he dabs it to third man. Sensible batting. Controlled batting."
<b>extra bounce</b> as Richardson bends his back and goes short. Mire goes for the pull on instinct and mistimes it to  deep midwicket
"scoops a fast bowler capable of hitting 140 kph all the way to the long leg boundary! Superb stuff from Masakadza, always has his eyes on the ball, and connects splendidly"
<b>chops on</b>! A short and wide delivery that deserves to be cut through cover point ends up pinging off the inside edge onto the stumps. Seems like Masakadza is fooled by a throttling down in pace. A wicket each in the Powerplay for Australia's quicks. That's job well done
"too short, and it even leaps over the wicketkeeper Carey to run away for four"
zips through past the top edge as Musakanda goes for a cut shot

targets the top of off but Mire gets in between the ball and the bulls-eye
"a hint of width and that's enough for Mire to exploit; lovely late cut, along the ground to third man"
"a slower ball, but he hits the deck with it. Musakanda reads it all perfectly, pulls his bottom hand off, nudges it to the left of the pitch and pinches a single"
"opens the face and finds a boundary. Very smart by Mire. He's in form. He's picking the ball well. And it is the change-bowler, so he definitely has to go after him"
stays put in front of a shortish delivery and absorbs all of its threats with soft hands
short and wide and Musakanda latches onto it with a vengeance. Cut with all of his power to the point boundary
"keeps going short and wide - but this time he makes sure it travels higher. Musakanda looks for the upper cut, but can't catch up with it"
"that's insane! He presses forward, not caring that Stanlake releases that little white thing at near 150 kph - and quite effortlessly lifts it over mid-on"
"<b>appeal for a catch</b>! It's Wildermuth down at thie third man boundary, running forward and diving low to pick up a fine catch. The umpires check for a no-ball and that's all they check for before sending Musakanda on his way. The dismissal is rather similar to the catch that Wildermuth dropped earlier in the game. A wild slap looking for the boundary (at cover perhaps) resulting in an edge flying to third man. This time the debutant makes a better effort"
"they're going up again, but umpire Tiffin is unmoved. End of a top over from Stanlake, as he beats the bat of the set batsman with an outswinger at outrageous pace"

"full on middle, pushes it back at the bowler"
stands tall against a back of a length delivery outside off and punches it through to deep point
"slower ball that deceives Mire. He's set up to launch it over the leg side, thinking it's length and it's in the slot. But the lack of pace makes him think twice and in the end leave it outside off"
"another slowy - perhaps the knuckle ball too, considering it moves in the air and squares Mire up. Outside edge down to point"
"takes the pace off again, but Moor is looking for it, adjusts his bat swing appropriately and flicks a straight one to long leg"
"spots the variation, hanging back until it finally arrives in his half of the pitch. Little late cut thereafter sends it down to third man"
clears the front leg and laces an overpitched delivery right at his partner at the other end. Single as the ball deflects over to long-on
"tosses it up on middle and leg, Moor defends"
"<b>leading edge</b>... swirling away past the shoulder of Tye, running back from cover.... lands safely. Superb bowling from Agar, even if it doesn't result in a wicket. Lobbing the ball up over the batsman's eyeline and getting it to dip and turn so that a hit straight down the ground becomes a panic-stricken wait for Moor to see if he's still alive in the game"

clears the front leg again as Agar targets leg stump and hits the length ball down to long-on
"flatter and fuller on off stump, Moor drills it back to the left-arm spinner"
"good length ball outside off stump, the batsman pushes it through cover point"
gets up off his toes so that he can hit the short ball on top of its bounce and send it scampering away to the left of both point and the sweeper cover. Good technique
"pitches it up, angling the ball into the right-hander. Mire skews it off the inside edge to deep square leg"
"bouncer, which keeps coming in at the batsmen. Moor drops his wrists and avoids contact"
defends a shortish delivery to the right of point
"pulls a rising delivery from outside off to long-on. Not enough room, and perhaps more pertinently, too much bounce for him to properly time the ball"
opens the face to guide a good length ball to third man
flirts with a back of a length delivery outside off and is comfortably beaten. Tiny bit more bounce than Moor is ready for
"he's forced back into his crease by a short ball, coming up towards his chest. Moor does well in the end, to use soft hands and blunt it by his feet"
gets forward to drill a fuller delivery to mid-off
"goes for a bouncer outside off, but it may just have wandered too high for its own good"
"<b>direct hit would have knocked Mire out</b>! Maxwell is the man at point, cutting the angle very well as he runs to his left to grab the ball and take a shy at the strikers' end. Decent shot from Moor, but not the best judgment of a run"
slogs a back of a length delivery to long-on
"sharp pace again as he goes full and outside off. Mire camps on leg stump, not really keen on getting in line with the delivery and so ends up comfortably beaten"
"short ball now, only a shade outside off stump. The lack of room, and that it comes near his shoulder, makes Mire decide not to dabble with it"
swishes outside off - this one giving him a little more width to free the arms - but Stanlake's got too much heat on the ball
rocks back to slap the short delivery outside off to point
"yorker on off stump, Moor digs it out"
"back of a length and outside off, slaps it to point"
works his wrists over a shortish delivery on middle and finds a couple between long-on and midwicket
"backs away, prompting Tye to follow the batsman and go as short as he can. But with this pitch already offering plenty of bounce, the ball soars over Mire's head as he leaves"
"launches it in the air, and it lands safely, <b>just beyond the reach of a diving Maxwell</b>! Superb work, in travelling so fast to catch up with the outside edge, and even while doing so, tracking the ball over his shoulder. Big dive to make something happen, but it falls just in front of his outstetched hand"

"good length ball on middle, which is turned through midwicket. Mire plays with soft hands looking for two and he gets it"
slogs a length ball outside off to deep square leg
"knuckle ball utterly deceives Mire, and for a second time, it only <b>just misses his stumps</b>. Stanlake had a chance at knocking out his off stump earlier in the day. Now Tye comes within inches of messing the middle one up. A slog with no luck or skill attached to it"
clatters a short ball outside off away over deep midwicket. Good work in getting on top of the bounce to connect as cleanly as he did
"another superb shot, this one along the ground, it's USP the placement. It skips past point on his left, and then bisects the sweeper and deep third man"
and there's the little bit of luck a batsman needs. Stoinis goes to top pace as he tries to bounce Moor. He goes for the pull and gets a top edge over the keeper
"slower ball on middle, Moor taps it to point. <b>That's the fifty partnership</b>"
scoops a length ball on middle stump over the short fine leg fielder. That's <b>19 off the over already</b>
"knuckle ball, bobbles out to become a yorker too. Mire keeps it out"
"top-edges the slog and three men are haring up after it, from deep midwicket, long-on and even the bowler looking to make something of it. Lands right between them"
"slings it through from a low arm, and at a much higher pace, as Mire swings and misses"
"another very quick delivery on middle, Mire nudges it to cover for a single"
"tries a slog sweep, but mistimes it so badly the wicketkeeper gets to it"
"reverse sweep now, and it s a superb shot, simply because Agar is bowling quick and at off stump, with third man and point up. Mire spots the flaw in Australia's plans and exploits it superbly"
"makes room and lashes a short ball over deep midwicket, into the grass banks. Brutal hit from Mire and Zimbabwe have finally got their groove on. Thirty-two runs off the last two overs."
spots Moor making room and so slows his pace down and plants the ball wide outside off. Clever bowling earns a dot
he's worried that Moor would be making room again and goes too wide outside off. Penalised
"back of a length and outside off, Moor looks for a late cut but is beaten"
"carves it over the top - and he really has timed the pants off it - the only problem is it sails straight to deep point. Moor takes on the long boundary and comes up short. He had to hit out though, with only four-ish overs left"
"back of a length and outside off, slashes and misses"
"full and outside off, slices it to deep point"
"full on off stump, he nudges it towards mid-on"

cramps him for room with a top-pace delivery on off stump. Chigumbura mistimes a late cut to point
"top edge, taken by square leg running in! It's a short ball, not really affording him the room to swing his arms. Also comes onto him too quickly, leading to a mis-hit."
"full and outside off, Mire slogs away, but gets a leading edge over short third man. Knuckle ball deceives the batsman, but he still profits"
massive! This time he nails the back of a length delivery off the middle of the bat and it sails over the backward square leg boundary. Mire's on fire. (Had to be said)
"good length ball on off stump, blocks behind point"
wide yorker - perfectly executed. Even Mire can't make something out of it.
"runs outside off to try to try and scoop the ball - but the perils of premeditation is that he has missed out on a full toss, which he could have hammered over the off side"
backs away and hammers a short ball over extra cover. What a shot! The timing on it! The sound of it leaving the bat!
"full toss outside off, smears it to the left of the sweeper cover. Two balls faced, two super shots for boundaries. Malcolm Waller is just what Zimbabwe needed right now"
adjusts to the back of the hand slower ball and lashes it away to the sweeper. Twenty-five runs off the last two overs; 52 off the last five.
drills a near yorker on leg stump out to extra cover
"looks for another yorker on middle, Mire gets it off the inside edge to short fine leg"
"taken by deep square leg! Good work from Tye, and it's his go-to delivery too. Change of pace, which is perfect against a batsman wanting to slog everything. Waller goes for a pull, mistimes it and ends up being caught, and quite easily at that"
"full and outside off, slaps it to extra cover"
"he risks a second in an effort to retain strike, but Tiiripano is not quick enough, nor does he dive. Mire hits to long-off. It should have only been a single but Zimbabwe need the established batsman on strike. They'll get that, but Tiripano's gone"
full and straight. Mire goes across the line for a slog over wide long-on - he kinda has no choice but to play shots line that - and makes no contact. That means the ball has a clear path to uproot off stump. <b>Fifty wickets in T20s in 2018 for Tye</b>

"backs away outside leg, but Masakadza follows him with a quicker delivery. Finch flicks through midwicket"
"keeps pushing it through in line with the stumps, Carey blocks"

tries to pull a short and wide delivery - perhaps off pace as well - and gets an inside edge to deep square leg
"lifts a good length ball straight down the ground - but this has gone high. Mid-off and mid-on are racing after it, but the ball lands just in front of them both"
taken at deep midwicket! It's a long hop from a spinner and it's absolutely smacked away. Problem is it zeroes in on Musakanda on the boundary. The in-form Finch is back in the hut and the chase is only two overs old. How will Australia respond?
"shortish on off stump, defends"
