"full in the channel, Roy gets forward and gets bat on ball, plinked towards mid-off"
"lovely ball, teasing line and straightening past the bat as Roy feels for it... maybe could have left on length but that's a decent nut from KG"
"woof, angled in and jacknifing away at 88mph, this time he lets it go"
"drifts on to the pads and Roy tucks in, hoisted up and over the square leg umpire for the first runs of the day"
"got him, steered to slip! Amla holds on this time, low down as a thick edge lobbed off the bat... Another single-figure score for Roy, who was drawn forward by a demanding line, the ball nibbling away down the Lord's slope and sending England's tub-thumping opener back to the changing rooms with a whimper"
"this stays low, shooting through towards off stump, he does well to drop his bat on it in defence"
"full and wide of the stumps and Hales clumps down on it, squeezes a single to third man off his first ball"
"stifled shout for an lbw as Root comes forward on off stump, inside-edged on to the pads"
"starts to come down the pitch and Parnell goes full at the feet, Root jabs it away"
"touch short and stroked through backward point, third man has to come around and they get a couple"
"trapped in front! Parnell beats him past the inside edge, booming swing - and England are two down! Lovely shape on that delivery, which started outside off and curled back in as Root aimed a punch down the ground. No hesitation from Michael Gough and it looked pretty plumb"
"length ball around off stump, no so much movement this time and Morgan inside-edges one through backward square leg"
"superb yorker, nearly kippers Morgan, the ball just fading past the outside edge and missing off stump on its way through to de Kock"
"pushed across the bows, defended square on off stump"
"Rabada goes round the wicket, angled in back of a length and he has Morgan groping off the back foot, past the outside edge"
pitched up a bit further and Morgan steps out to eases this through the covers for a couple
"feisty bumper, 88mph and aimed at the top of Morgan's block... he ducks sharply underneath"
"fuller, around off stump, poked past extra cover and they scamper through for one"
"fullish, 85mph outside off, tapped into the covers"
"launched, Morgan on the charge, he skips down and happy-slaps Parnell away over the ring for four to deep cover"
"better length, defended around the line of off"
"bit of shape on this one, draws Morgan into another attacking foray, past the outside edge"
"pitched up, 84mph on off stump, pushed back down the track coming forwards"
"lovely bowling, Morgan gone! Parnell is enjoying the <del>famously moribund</del> juicy Lord's surface, curving the ball away and kissing the outside edge, giving a simple catch to de Kock. Morgan's brief sally is over and England are wheezing in North Weezy"
"England continue to attack... and SA continue to capitalise! Pitched up in the channel, Hales drives and Amla this time tumbles to his left to snap up another catch. A second for Rabada and England are tottering like an MCC member after a day on the port. Somehow that was only Hales' <i>second</i> ball... One he'll quickly want to forget"
"pushed down the leg side, maybe as part of a plan, Buttler swishes after it... but fails to connect"
"length ball, comes across on off, shows it a straight bat. England need some more of that"
"dug in short, flying through as the batsman ducks"
"slightly too straight from Rabada and this is firmly whipped to leg, excellent timing from Buttler, escorting his first runs to the midwicket boundary"
"throws the bat, thick-edged to second... England are five down! Superb catch from Faf du Plessis, that went very quickly as Buttler attempted to thrash it through the covers. Not quite as quickly as England are subsiding, but still"
"edged and gone - THIS IS ABSURD!!! Rashid goes for a big booming drive from his first ball, du Plessis scoops it up low to his left this time... and Rabada is on a hat-trick! Perhaps England are trying to get their shocker out of the way before the Champions Trophy, but this is golden-era awful from a country that knows a fair bit about being rubbish at ODIs"
"full on off, bit of inswing, Bairstow shows it a straight bat in defence... and there are hearty, ironic cheers around the ground, as England defiantly refuse to through away their seventh wicket (at least for now)"
more cheers as Parnell bowls a wide down the leg side
touch short and turned down into the leg side
"length ball, holding its line on off, Bairstow defends"
"slides on to the pads and Bairstow gets off the mark with a clip through square, Maharaj slides to stop the ball in front of the rope and nearly makes a ricket of it before getting the throw in"
"back of a length, straightening a touch, comes off the outer half of the bat and runs square"
"edged through gully and away for four! Willey survives where several of his colleagues have perished, just managed to steer it wide of the waiting slips"
"good length, angled in and defended stoutly by YJB"
"pitched up, comes across and pushes a drive into the ground, back towards the bowler"
"moves his line wider, flying through from a length, Bairstow plays an exaggerated leave"
"short ball, 88mph and going for the throat, Bairtsow ducks underneath"
"good length, YJB comes across on off stump and shows it a straight bat"
"Bairstow comes across and leaves again - two wicketless overs, SA now suffering a drought"
"runs, spanked through midwicket, Willey shows attacking intent but with more judicous shot selection, creaming Parnell off his pads"
"length ball in the channel, left alone"
nothing judicious about that... touch short and wide and Willey throws the kitchen sink at a cut but fails to connect
"excellent ball, finds a bouncier spot in the deck, gets it to rise and leave the batsman, squaring him up and comprehensively beating the outside edge"
"angled in and holding its line, Willey shows it a straight bat"
"another flash and a miss, slightly short outside off and there's the umpteenth woolly waft of the morning - but he survives"
"back of a length, shaping in as YJB judges the bounce and shoulders arms"
"tight lines, Bairstow blocks solidly towards point coming across his stumps"
"maybe a touch short, in the channel and left alone once again"
"another lbw shout as Rabada darts the ball past the inside edge as YJB gets forward to drive... Height the question, Rod Tucker not interested"
"bit of width, Bairstow opens the face and runs the ball wide of third man, comes haring back for two"
"overpitched and this is creamed through the covers, more appreciation from the crowd as Bairstow reaches the brink of double-figures. Nobody jinx it!"
"over the wicket, angled across back of a length, no stroke offered"
"oof, that's awkward, rising sharply and bothering Willey's inside edge, takes a blow on the thigh pad trying to leave"
"in the corridor, no need to play... so Willey doesn;t"
"pitched up a bit further, driven without much timing, into a gap at cover for one"
"back of a length, seaming in from wide of the stumps, YJB leaves it be"
"bit of width outside off, reaches for it and jabs one to third man, takes him into double-figures. Worth a raise of the bat, by England's standards today"
pushed through slightly wide of the stumps and Bairstow steps back to thrash four through the covers
"gives it some air, drifting on middle and off, defended this time"
"slightly too straight, worked away into the leg side for one"

"back of a length outside off, Bairdtow watches it through"

"length ball, on the stumps, Bairstow prods it into a gap on the leg side for one"

"looped up nice and slow, Willey again comes across his stumps"
"spinning in and played from the crease, glanced off the pads for one to fine leg"
"pushed through outside off, Bairstow drops back and clips though the covers"
tossed up and Willey comes forward to punch one down the ground to long-on... more understated applause for the England 50
"round the wicket to YJB, who strokes one more through the off side to keep the strike"
"rising off a length, hits the padding as Bairstow tries to get his hands out of the way"
"back of a length, in the corridor of bedevilment, left alone"

tossed up and tickled back down the ground for one
"straighter line, worked into the leg side"
"pushed through outside off stump, YJB cuts another single in front of square"
"on the stumps, Willey drops back and clips the ball to midwicket"
"lovely stuff from YJB, rocking back to short ball and casually ramping it over the keeper and slips for four. This could turn into another ideal batting audition for him"

"shortish and on the body, worked for a single"
"round the wicket, sprays this one slightly leg side, flick and a miss... and a wide"

"over the stumps, tapped down to the leg side from the crease"
"on a length at off stump, defended"
"that's a strong square drive, not a vast amount of width but Willey plays it hard into the ground and it skips away over the outfield"
"a short ball, pulled behind square...scampers back for a second, well-judged. Brings up the fifty stand"
"full outside off, he comes forward and pushes strongly to deep cover"
"not a great ball, short and wide outside off, Bairstow leans back and cuts it sweetly through point"
"full at off stump, pushed to mid-on"
"good length at off stump, defended to the covers"
"back of a length, punched to the off side"

"a bouncer on leg stump, 84mph, he swivels confidently on a hook down to long leg"
"strong shot, driven on the up but du Plessis cuts it off with a leap to his right at cover"
"and that's the breakthrough! Willey goes for a drive on the up, wasn't full enough for the booming shot, can't keep the ball down and it's snaffled at cover"

"short of a length, neatly worked off his body into the leg side"
"spooned into the leg side, but lands in space! A short ball, Roland-Jones gets into a bit of a tangle as he tries to shovel it to the on side. A leading edge loops short of mid-on"

"back on a full length at off stump, stuck firmly to Morris who gets a hand on it in the follow through"

"what a shot! He's creamed that. A wide half volley, Roland-Jones is onto the front foot and drills it through the covers"
"and another...drags the length back, this time he drives squarer, behind point, and it evades Rabada into the wide third man boundary. Fielder dived over it somewhat"
"drives again, this time it's back to the bowler"
"good length at off stump, pushed to mid-off"
"back of a length at off stump, defended to the covers"

"gets forward, pushes to the covers"
"a bouncer, angled over leg stump, he shapes for a hook but the ball scoots over his top edge...a one-handed take by de Kock"
"another bouncer, this time he ducks underneath"
gets inside the line of a short delivery and works it off his hip to long leg
"we have a <b>review</b> for lbw as Maharaj slides this one into Roland-Jones. Given not out on the field. No bat involved, hits the knee roll, but it's umpire's call on clipping leg"
"pushed into the pads, worked out to deep square leg"
"and that's all over! Charges down the pitch outside leg stump, the ball grips just enough to spin past his outside edge as he tries to drive over the off side"

"full at the stumps, he steals the strike with a solid front-foot push into the covers"

defended off the back foot
defends to the on side
"he shows Bairstow how to do it! Skips down the track, gets to the pitch and drives inside-out over cover"

"a neat whip off the pads to get off the back, goes behind square on the leg side"
"that's a sharp bouncer, gets a top edge as he's beaten for pace, flies very fine...long leg does well to flick it back inside the rope"

"full, shapes in at Finn, defended to midwicket"
"full toss outside off, driven down the on side of the pitch"
"short outside off, he fetches it and pulls high in the air over midwicket...plugs in the outfield"
that's rapid! A bouncer which followed him. He swayed his head out of the line at the last moment
"and that's a dolly to end things...Finn flicks this lazily to midwicket, a soft finish. Drifting into the pads and he couldn't keep the ball down"

"touch short again, rising in the channel outside off, left alone this time"
"goes back and across, 80mph outside off, back of a length, no stroke"

"good length outside off, left alone this time"
