"tidy start from Dhawal. On a length, around middle, some away shape. Defended to mid-on. No golden duck this time."
"more swing. Not too much, not too troubling. Good length delivery outside off, sixth-stump line. Defended into the off side, towards cover."
"off the mark via a misfield. Back of a length on middle and leg, swivel-pulled away towards square leg. Gowtham can't field cleanly, allowing the first run of the night."
"a <b>golden duck for Lewis</b> this time! It's an overpitched half-volley outside off and Lewis wants to flay that through cover. It's the right stroke and the right plan, but downright awful execution. His feet are rooted to the crease, he doesn't account for the little bit of inswing, despite watching it from the other end. A thick inside edge clatters into the stumps."
"140 kph, full and swinging back in, Kishan gets forward and somehow defends. It's a similar delivery to what Umesh bowled to him at the Wankhede."
"full outside off, pushed to cover. A lovely start from Dhawal."
"it's short and quick down leg, flicked away with strong wrists to square leg. Finds the fielder"
"short and quick outside off, punched away to cover where there is another misfield. Another single."
"flat on middle and leg, nudged into the gap at midwicket for a run. Nicely played, soft hands, off the mark."
"it's flat and quick outside off, pushed to mid-off, not much power or timing with that"
"flat outside off, a big extravagant swing, but the drift takes the ball past the outside edge."
"flat and quick on middle and leg, pushed to long-on for one. Another tidy over."
"a clean swing into the stands! Full, on middle and leg. Suryakumar showed the strength of his wrists in the previous one. Now, he lifts the ball cleanly over mid-on for six. Shot."
"the line isn't great, drifts down leg, worked to deep square leg for one."
"full on off, 135 kph, blocked to mid-off. The little bit of swing we saw in the first over isn't there anymore."
"just short of midwicket! It's 138 kph, hurrying Kishan for pace. He looks to pull, but all he can manage is to splice it away."
"a slower ball outside off, good change in pace, and angle (the ball going away instead of coming in). Pushed to cover point."
"looking for the gap either side of short third man, but he finds the fielder! Full and wide, dabbed away towards short third man."
"a good length delivery, straying down leg. Off the thigh pad down to short fine leg."
"141 kph. Again, hurried on the pull. Short of a length outside off, Kishan drags a mis-timed pull to midwicket."
"nicely done. Good length delivery in the fourth-stump channel, tapped towards point for a run. A direct hit from Gowtham at the bowler's end, but he's well in. Good cricket"
"looking to drag a flick, but the ball has smashed Suryakumar on the box! That's going to hurt for a little bit. Back of a length on middle and off, 142 kph. Suryakumar misses and wears the blow."
"145 kph, doesn't miss out this time. Back of a length on middle and leg, makes contact with his flick this time and the ball goes flying past short fine leg's left."
"full delivery outside off, 145 kph. Skewed away to mid-on. Another good over for Rajasthan."
"a full delivery outside off, nicely driven with the full face to mid-off. Decent timing too."
"that's smashed! 116 kph offcutter on middle and leg. Kishan comes charging and swipes a heave into the stands over long-on. The bat turned in his hands, but still plenty of power."
"full and wide outside off, hammered to the sweeper cover for a single. Quick hands through the line of the ball."
"what a shot! All wrists. Full and straight, Suryakumar brings out the wrists, stays besides the ball and flicks, the ball then flies away over backward square leg. Lovely batting."
"full on middle and leg, driven to long-on for a run."
that's not great bowling. It's short and wide with third man in. Kishan slices a cut between short third man and backward point. Too easy. Poor over that one. One too many from Rahane.
all wrists again! What batting. Back of a length on the fourth-stump channel. Suryakumar stays low and whips this elegantly through midwicket. Beautiful
"a slower ball on middle and leg, pushed to mid-on. Suryakumar called for one immediately (it was his call). Kishan doesn't completely trust the call, there's some hesitation but even <strong>with a direct hit at</strong> the batsman's end, all good."
"good length on middle and leg, jammed out back towards the bowler."
"a slower cutter on off, 119 kph, sliced in front of point for one. Wanted one all along"
"a full delivery outside off, driven to mid-off for a run. They've got the boundary so the singles make it a productive over."
"a good length delivery on off, pushed to long-on for a single. A good comeback from Mumbai after a slow start."
"flat on middle and leg, punched to long-on from the back foot."

"flat on middle and leg, punched to long-on for a single."
"flat on middle and leg, flicked away towards square leg for a run."
"101 kph, a flat and quick dart. Suryakumar looks to drag a sweep but it's too full. Struck on the pad, well outside the line of off stump!"
connects this time. It's the same trajectory - flat and quick - and Suryakumar Yadav sweeps that easily through  backward square leg for four. Just had to get some bat on that.
"a bit of flight on leg, Kishan stays low and nails his sweep to deep midwicket for one, all along the ground."
"a tad short, Suryakumar Yadav picks the length early, hurries back and swats a pull into the gap at midwicket for two."
"looking for the seam-up one, 115 kph. Waaaay down leg. Buttler does well to prevent five wides."
"it's too short again. A long hop, Suryakumar Yadav hurries back and swats a pull into the gap at midwicket for four. Archer gets across to his left, but allows the ball to go through. Naughtily"
"pulled away to deep square leg, it's short again."
"it's a googly, on middle and leg, pulled to deep square leg. Two more."
"aargh, it's short again. That's a poor over. Googly outside off, Kishan rocks back and nails his pull to wide long-on for a run."

"<b>nataraja pull!</b> Good length on middle, and he's quick to swivel, get his front leg up, and then muscled over square leg"
"full on off, and Kishan comes down the wicket. Effectively yorks himself, so all he can do is bunt it down the ground to long off"
"full just outside off, opens his bat's face and carves it to deep point. Calls early for the second, and they comfortably jog back in"
"good length outside off, but angling into the right-hander. Punched off the front foot to long on for a walking single"
"slower ball to end the over. Good length outside off, and Kishan mistimes his cut"

"tossed up outside off, and that's a beautiful shot from Sky. Takes one step forward and lifts it over cover. <b>Stylish way to get to fifty</b>"

"good length on middle, and gets big onto Kishan. Muscled off the back foot towards cover. Not hit into the gap"
"<b>goes beyond cow corner!</b> Nicely flighted on leg stump, and Kishan uses his feet to get to the pitch of the ball. Proper slog towards the leg side thereafter"
"high full toss, but wide outside off. Suryakumar can slap this anywhere he wants, but drills it straight to cover. Was above the waist, mind you, but called a dot"
"<b>clipped behind square!</b> Full on middle, and aimed at Sky's pads. Uses his wrists to whip it over the square-leg umpire's head, and beats both men in the deep"
"slower ball, and short on off stump. He's through his pull-shot early, and that's in the air. Straight to Gowtham at long on, <b>but it's been dropped!</b> He's one of the better fielders, but drops it after what looked like a clean catch"
"good length outside off, and angling into Yadav. Flat-batted down the ground to long on. <b>Also the hundred partnership</b>"
good length but just outside off. Punched off the back foot past Stokes' left to long off
"full on off, and Kishan tries another leg-side slog. Inside-edged onto his pads, and goes towards midwicket. No one there, so Stokes has to run across to the leg side. Allows them to take the run"
"full on off, and he tries to drive towards cover. Takes the inside edge and trickles down to short fine leg. Darting throw from the fielder to the non-striker's, but Kishan's safe"
"good length, just outside off. Stays on the back foot and punches to long off for an easy run"
"full on middle stump, and Kishan muscles this drive past the non-striker. Man at long on, though"
"good length outside off, and Yadav takes a step towards the leg side and cuts it past point. Beats the infielders and there's no stopping that thereafter"

"full and wide outside off. Kishan chooses to reverse sweep, but Stokes is there at deep point"

"full toss on middle stump again, and this time it's been bunted towards the leg side. Only to square leg, though"
"<b>deft!</b> Good length outside off, and Sky opens his bat's face to ramp it between the keeper and short third man. Chase for the infielder"
"full on middle stump, and drilled down the ground to long on"
"full toss on off stump, and mistimed off the back foot to mid on. Calls early for the single, and <b>that's his fifty!</b>"
"good length on off, and extra bounce! Hits the batsman's gloves, as he tries to defend. That must've stung"
"backs away to the leg side, and cuts this good-length ball over point. Excellent from Archer in the deep, who races across the boundary line and collects from deep point"
"deceived by the slower ball! Only 120 kph this time, and Kishan misses the leg-side slog. Full outside off, and through to the keeper on the bounce"
"<b>drops just in front of short fine leg!</b> And then goes through Gopal's hands. Full on off, and he shuffled across to the off side to try and ramp it over the leg side. Mistimes it behind square but earns a boundary anyway"
"full just outside off, and he backs away once again. Drills this drive to cover thereafter"
"good length outside off, and going straight through. Enough width for Kishan to cut square, but plays under that ball. Through to Buttler"
"slower ball outside off, but Kishan was waiting for it. Slog-swept to Stokes at wide long on"
"full and wide outside off, but that's premeditated by Suryakumar. Gets his front leg across to the off side and then paddles this sweep shot very square on the man in the deep"
"<b>too cheeky, and Kishan pays the price.</b> Full toss outside off, and Kishan opens his bat's face to ramp it over the keeper. Doesn't manage to get the angle he wants, and therefore in the air for ages. Buttler collects and finally the partnership ends after almost 14 overs"
"good length on middle stump, and that's been pulled along the ground to deep midwicket"
good length just outside off on the fourth-stump line. Pollard takes a step forward and taps it back to the bowler
"full toss, but wide outside off. Sticks his bat out and drills it to deep extra cover. He's off the mark. Kulkarni ensuring the ball's not in Pollard's arc"
too wide. Overpitched and Suryakumar lets it go through to Buttler
"well, we'll find out in a bit. Because it's full and wide outside of again. Forces Suryakumar to reach at it, and he misses, but the umpire stretches his arms out again"
"full toss, wide outside off again. Sky thumps it past the non-striker to long on for a single"
"starts off with the slower ball. Full outside off, and angling across Yadav. Tries to drive towards cover, but misses"
"slow again, and this time the slog is played way too early. Slices the shot, and it's another skyer. Swirls in the air, but Buttler's very safe"
"slower ball again. Full on middle stump, and driven to long off"
"<b>first-ball duck!</b> Full on off, and pushed to cover for a quick single. Rohit calls early, but that's super dangerous. Rahane collects, dives forward, and then throws under-hand. Off go to zing bails, and out goes Rohit!"
"good length on off, and he opens his bat's face to carve it towards backward point. Calls nice and early this time"
"short outside off, and forces Krunal to tip-toe. Chopped towards the keeper"
"back of a length on off, and Pollard's been deceived by the pace. Defended off the back foot"
"goes short! On off stump, and soars over Pollard's head as he's forced to duck"
"back of a length on off stump, and it's another loopy slower ball. Pollard wants to pull but he's through his shot too early. Hits his arm"

"back of a length outside off, and Krunal opens his bat's face to glance it towards short third man"
"goes back of a length, and takes the pace off it once again. Whipped off his waist to deep square leg"
"good length outside off, and angling into Krunal. Stays on the back foot, and glances this past short third man. Beats the infield, and no stopping that thereafter!"
"slower ball, and full on off. Tapped off his pads towards the vacant mid-wicket region. They want the second, but Samson's quick to get his throw right in"
"good length on middle, and angling across Pollard. Just enough width to free his arms, and he smacks it over the non-striker's head. Hit well enough!"
"back of a length on off, and Pollard comfortably pulls it over short fine-leg's head"
"another slower ball, it's the offcutter this time. Krunal wants to work it towards the leg side, but takes the leading edge. Falls near short extra cover"
"excellent ball to end the over. Gives everything to this delivery and Unadkat takes a tumble on his followthrough. It's full and wide outside off, but inside the tram-lines. A much better spell from Unadkat tonight"
"full on off, and lifted off his pads towards the leg side. Not hit well enough, and Klaasen - at wide long on - takes an easy catch. Looks like it's the knuckleball that earns Archer the wicket"
"<b>dropped by Archer!</b> Was hit really hard though, but he doesn't show the pain. Smiles it off. Full on off, and Pollard drills it straight to Archer. He managed to get it with both hands, but the ball just pops out. Difficult chance"
"<b>the umpire's on the floor!</b> Full on off, and that's been thumped down the ground. As straight as you can imagine, and I'm glad Rod Tucker ducked. Goes to the boundary in no time"
"crashes into middle stump! Full on leg stump, and Hardik tries a leg-side slog. Misses, and the ball hits his pad and then cannons into his stumps"
"<b>and McClenaghan's out!</b> Comes from around the wicket and this is full on off stump. Almost a yorker, and the batsman can't connect. <b>On a hat-trick</b>"
"full on leg stump, and that's been clipped off his toes to deep backward square. Single for the taking, but Pollard refuses. The big man wants the strike for the final over"
"yorker on off stump, and that's been dug down the ground. A single's available, but Pollard asks Markande to get back"
"falls just short of cow corner! Short on off, and Pollard mistimed the pull. Was in the air for ages, but Unadkat can't get to it"
"too slow! Pollard winds up for a biggie, but sends it nowhere. Full outside off, but through his shot way too early"
"slipped out of his hand! Eye-line level full toss, but wide outside off. Pollard lets it go. <b>Free hit</b>"
"yorker on middle stump, and that's been drilled past the non-striker to long on. Gowtham's dive ends up in vain!"
"full outside leg stump, but Pollard expected that. Backs away further towards the leg side and thumps it towards deep midwicket"
"full outside leg, and Pollard whips it fine down the leg side. Misfield in the deep, and that allows them to take the second. <b>Rajasthan Royals need 168 to win</b>"
"nicely bowled. Full and attacking the stumps, Rahane is aware of that wicket-taking option, so a broad bat comes down to defend."
"132 kph, back of a length down leg. Clips the pad down towards short fine leg."
"it's too straight. Full and drifting down leg. All Tripathi needs is a bit of bat, a thick inside edge and the ball flies down to the fine leg fence."
"good length delivery around middle and off, tapped towards point. Tripathi hares down, Rahane sends him back in time."
not been a great start in terms of line. This one drifts down leg for a wide.
too straight again. A slower one on the pads and Tripathi works the ball through backward square leg for a couple.
"nicely played and stopped. A full delivery on middle and leg, Tripathi drives with the full face, towards mid-off's right. The fielder gets across and cuts the ball off. A slightly sloppy start from Mumbai."
"lovely start. A good length delivery on off, the ball pitches and straightens even with his angle. Tripathi is squared up, a thick outside edge goes down to third man."
"140 kph, on a length, looking for the top of off. Pushed to mid-on"
"slightly shorter, Rahane opens the bat face and guides that down to third man for one."
"skiddy. Good length on middle and leg, Tripathi gets behind the line to block."
"strays on the pads, worked away to deep square leg for a single."
"good stop from McClenaghan. Back of a length outside off, Rahane opens the bat face and guides a dab down to third man for a run."
"starts with a full delivery on middle, driven to mid-on for a quick single."
"picks out mid-on! I'm not sure what kind of a shot that was. Flat and straight, Tripathi just chips a drive to mid-on, did he try to go over? Or past him? That does not seem like a very clever shot, did it hold up? Something definitely did happen that resulted in a tame bunt to the fielder. Krunal doesn't care."
"a yorker on off, jammed back to the bowler."
"edged through the vacant slip region for four. A bit of width, flat and wider. A thick edge goes flying away for four. Krunal got some turn on that."
"he's timed this one! Flat and wide outside off, pushed away through cover for three. Pulled back just inside the boundary."
"flat on middle and leg, pushed to mid-on. Krunal cuts off that angle by running to his right."
"a good length delivery on off, Samson opens the bat face and finds short third man."
"another cutter, 125 kph, the ball skews off the outside half of the bat to backward point"
"slightly wider outside off, allowing Samson to throw his hands at the ball. Finds the timing and the placement, into the gap at cover."
"another cutter, 129 kph, full and wide outside off. Samson strides forward and slices a drive to deep cover"
"another cutter, 125 kph, on middle and leg, worked to midwicket. Tidy over so far."
"a good length delivery outside off, pushed to mid-off for a single. A good call from Rahane."
"slow outside off, some flight, but it isn't full. Very clever delivery. Worked against the spin, to midwicket."
"flat and straight, nudged to deep midwicket for one"
"flicked against the spin again. Flat and wide outside off, drag-flicked to mid-on"
"short, straighter though. Clipped to deep midwicket"
"loses patience with those singles and changes the line, goes much fuller and much wider outside off. Rahane crashes a drive through cover for four."
"flat on the pads, nudged to square leg for a run. At least a single off every ball, very well played by these two."
"a slower delivery outside off, Rahane opens the bat face and guides the ball to short third man. Bumrah picks up and throws the stumps down at the striker's end, conceding an extra run in the process."
"another slower cutter, 119 kph, carved to backward point. That's quite predictable with third man up"
"a length delivery on middle and leg, nudged to midwicket. Another cutter."
"finds midwicket! The pressure was building and the fielder was pushed to the edge of the circle to protect the over. It's another cutter, around middle and leg. Rahane gets enough bat on a wristy whip, but he picks out midwicket at a comfortable height too. The reverse-cupped hands over his head does the job for Krunal. Rahane gestures that he wanted to hit the ball wider of the fielder, like all batsmen try to do."
"walks right across, worked away to deep square leg for a run."
"finds the gap! Another cutter outside off, Samson opens the bat face and guides the ball into the gap between third man and point. Lovely."
"flat start, on off. No flight. Worked to midwicket with the spin."
"slog-swept! The googly outside off, but it doesn't matter because Stokes opts for a cross-batted stroke. A hard sweep past midwicket's right"
"another cross-batted stroke, the reverse sweep, it's the legbreak on middle and off. Stokes places this nicely through point, all along the ground. A good diving stop from Hardik, running to his right"
"tossed up outside off, driven to long-off"
"some flight outside off, Samson drives the ball with the spin to wide long-off, immediately calling for two. Nicely into the gap and two easy"
"a googly down leg, would have been wide had he left the ball but he tickles that down to fine leg."
"another cutter, full and wide outside off. Driven to deep point for a single"
"Stokes walks right across this too. But misses. A good length delivery outside off, Stokes walks across, misses and is struck on the pad! A massive appeal is quickly struck down, but <b>Mumbai want to review</b>. Stokes is well down the pitch, there isn't any bat. Two reds, but the ball is bouncing over the top of off stump. So Mumbai lose their review."
"full outside off, Stokes walks down and pushes to mid-off for a quick single. Almost in sync. Rohit can't prevent one."
"back of a length, but sliding down leg. Worked away into the gap at backward square leg. Fine leg cleans up."
"on a length, down leg, worked to deep midwicket for one."
"a slower ball outside off, Samson opens the bat face and guides the ball to backward point for a run."
"tossed up on middle, and it's the topspinner this time. Goes straight through, and fended off the front foot"

"good length on middle stump, and slower on this occasion. Pushed to wide long-on, and Stokes calls nice and early for the run"

"full on middle and off, but angling across Stokes. Thumped off the backfoot, past the non-striker, to long off"
"full, but outside leg stump. Stokes was already down the ground, so all he needs to do is clip it off his toes. Played to fine leg"
"half-tracker on off, but Stokes can't punish it. Pulled, along the ground, to deep midwicket"
"drilled towards the leg side, but played softly enough to come back for the second"
"good length on middle and leg, and flicked off his pads towards the leg side. Sweeper in the deep"
"<b>super slow mo!</b> very short, but it's 92kph! Stokes swivels, winds up, and thumps it over short fine leg"
"<b>drilled past extra cover!</b> Goes full and wide outside off, but Stokes kinda expected it. Backs away to make some extra room and slaps it past the cover-region"

"good length on off, and slightly turning away from Stokes. He punches it towards wide long on, and pushes Samson to complete the second"
"good length on leg stump, and cramping Stokes for room. Pushed down the ground to long off for a quick single"
"good length just outside off, and Samson rides the bounce to punch it past cover to the man in the deep"
"good length on middle and going across Stokes. He tries to ramp it over short fine leg, but then tries to ramp it over short third man. Eventually connects with neither"
"slower ball, full on off stump. Drilled to Hardik at mid off"
"good length on middle stump, and angling into Samson. He punches it off the back foot past midwicket to the man in the deep. Two more. <B>Also the team hundred</b>"
"low full toss on middle stump, and that's been blocked back to Bumrah. Straight back to the bowler, who thinks about having a shy at the stumps. Surprised Samson there"
"<b>just over Markande at point!</b> Was that the wicket Mumbai needed? Back of a length outside off, and just some extra bounce this time. He tried to crunch this over cover, but eventually slices it over the infield. Lucky"
"<b>connects this time!</b> Short and wide outside off, and that allows Stokes to free his arms. Shifts his body-weight towards the front foot, and then thumps it - flat-batted, really - over cover"
"Stokes comes down the wicket, and therefore it's a low full toss on off. Driven towards wide long off"
"back of a length on middle, and that's been beautifully pulled off the back foot. Will only early him a single"

"full toss outside off, but Samson can't put it away. Drives it off the bat's top-half, and goes only to cover"

"full outside off, and comfortably driven to deep extra cover. He'll get off the mark"
"<b>there's the orange cap!</b> Good length on off, and angling into Samson's body. Waits on the backfoot, and pulls this - along the ground - to wide long on. Man there in the deep, but he's just a spectator"

"full just outside off, and Buttler's through with his drive too early. Slices it, but just short of Markande at point"
"full outside off, and enough width to drive past extra cover. Chase for Duminy in the deep, and his throw is not good. Allows Samson to steal a second run"
"good length on off, and spinning across Samson. Pushed to long off with soft hands, and that's <b>fifty for Samson!</b>"
"full on off, but turned off his pads towards midwicket. They collect the single on offer"
"good length on middle stump, and punched to wide long on"
"good length outside off, and it's been driven away from his body. Man at deep extra cover though"
"good length on leg stump, and angling into Buttler. He tries to back away to make some extra room, but Krunal follows him. Can't cut it away"

"short and wide outside off, and Buttler can free his arms. Slaps this past the infield to the man in the deep"
"<b>holes out to deep midwicket!</b> Is that the end for Royals? Full on off, and to be honest, in Samson's arc. The slower delivery does the trick though, and finds the toe end of Samson's bat. In the air for ages, but too simple for Hardik"
"<b>The zing bails light up!</b> Super fast (144kph) on off stump and angling right into Buttler. He tries to defend it straight, but the ball goes between bat and pad. Crashes into middle stump"
"no he won't. Full on off stump, but Archer does well to get behind the line of the ball, and defend with soft hands"
"yorker just outside off stump, and Archer can't carve this away. Bounces behind the stumps and goes through to Kishan's gloves. This is classic Bumrah"
"yorker on off stump, and that's been dug back to Bumrah. He's forced to stick his hand up and the ball sticks! Excellent over"
"<b>diving catch from Kishan!</b> Angling away from Klaasen, and he tries to punch away from his body. The offcutter goees across Klaasen, and therefore takes the outside edge. Kishan's forced to dive diagonally forward but he's safe with the gloves. Three wickets in six balls..."
"good length on middle stump, but the extra bounce doesn't bother the tall Gowtham. Flat-batted over Fizz's head to Pollard at long on"
"awry! Super-high full toss outside off, and goes to Kishan on the full! Passed Archer from over his head. Fizz apologises right away"

"good length on off, and angling away from Gowtham. He tries to slog it over cover, but sliced over the infield. Lands in no man's land"
"good length on middle stump, and in his arc. Backs away and muscles this towards the leg side. Enough behind that shot to take it beyond long on. Rohit's not happy"
"full outside off, and the drive finds the bat's toe end. Flies past Kishan's right and through to the third-man boundary. The equation: <b>28 runs off 12 balls</b>"
"good length outside off, and Archer has the power to slap this very square! Played wide enough of deep extra cover, and the outfielder can't pull it back"
"full on off stump, and that's been smothered off his pads to wide long on. Chase for Pollard in the deep"
"slower ball full outside off, and that's been crunched over the non-striker's head. Pollard's there in the deep, but <b>oh dear, it's a no-ball!</b>"
"full toss on leg stump, and he's cramped for room. Hits his bat and trickles away towards mid-wicket. No one there, so that means Archer asks Gowtham to come for the second"
"<b>slapped with disdain!</b> Good length, but wide enough outside off to cut it furiously hard. Gowtham winds up and then pumps this past backward point"
"takes the pace off! Full, and super slow outside off. Gowtham tries to slog this over Bumrah's head, and ends up missing completely"
"full on off stump, and Gowtham's leg-side heave comes off the bat's inside edge. That means the shot goes behind square, and that means into the gap. Finds the backward square boundary. <b>Eighteen off the over</b>"
"goes short outside off, and Archer's pull takes the top edge! Hardik gets under it, and manages to keep his composure"
"<b>ramped over short third man!</b> It's full outside off, and Gowtham gets down on one knee, opens the bat's face, and sends it over the infield. The Royals camp erupts!"
"overpitched on off stump, and that's been drilled to cover. Unadkat's halfway down the wicket, but Gowtham sends him back. Will this hurt Royals?"
"<b>Gowtham conquers Jaipur!</b> Short outside off, and the batsman stays on the back foot to pull it towards the leg side. Off the bat's sweet spot and the ball soars over the mid-wicket boundary. <B>Royals win by three wickets</b>"
