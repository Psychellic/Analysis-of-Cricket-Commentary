"he starts off with a short ball and hits the bat hard. He can bowl a heavy ball, as Kohli said at the toss. Markram hops, skips, fends to the covers"
"and Markram eases himself in with a slapped boundary through the covers. Short, wide, 127ks, begging on its knees to be put away. Markram obliges at his home ground"
"short, wide, 126ks, the result is no different. Markram jumps off the ground, gets on top of the bounce, and square-cuts it between backward point and cover"
"back of a length and outside off, Thakur cranks it up to 137ks, punched through the line. Rahane flings himself to his left to intercept the ball. Excellent fielding"
"back of a length and slanting in at the top of off, Markram covers up in defence and blocks it back to Thakur"
"nicely pitched up on off stump, Markram checks his drive and guides the ball to cover"
"full awayswinger, starts outside off and nibbles away further, Amla watches it through to the keeper"
"back of a length, there's the exaggerated angle from Bumrah, kicks up,<strong> takes the outside edge near the shoulder of the bat </strong>and skips away between slip and gully. Amla inspects the pitch as he runs across to the other end"
"back of a length and angling in at 141ks, blocked solidly to the leg side"
"Bumrah ventures wide of the crease. Fuller, angling in, seaming in but does not threaten off stump. No shot"
"wide of the crease again, full and this holds its line outside off, ignored by Markram"
Bumrah pulls his length back and nearly hits 140ks. Markram lifts his bat and watches the ball zip through the channel
Amla shuffles across the off stump and gets inside the line of this shortish ball on middle. Clipped only as far as square leg
"nice and full, nips away outside off, Amla shuffles across off and lets this<strong> outswinger</strong> go"
"back of a length and shapes away slightly, Amla isn't interested yet"
"on a length and outside off, not quite full enough for a drive. Amla presses forward and across as he pushes the ball to cover"
"teaser from Thakur, Amla doesn't bite again. Good length, starts just a shade outside off and bends away, ignored"
"Amla takes it on the up and flays it over the off-side infield. Pitched up and outside off, Amla chases at it and drives it over the top of the covers. Once he cleared the infield, it was always a boundary"
"full and angling just outside off, Markram presses forward and drives through the line to mid-off"
"<strong>signs of variable bounce</strong>! Attempted short ball from Bumrah, angling in just outside off, shoots low, Markram stoops low with it and guides it to wide slip with soft hands"
"on a length and outside off, tapped back to Bumrah"
"lifter outside off, 'beautiful, beautiful' is the cry from behind the stumps. Markram arches his back and lets it thud into the gloves of Dhoni"
"just short of a good length and outside off, Markram gets on top of the bounce and fluently punches it but can't get it past cover"
"full and angling in on off, driven up to Kohli at mid-off to round out a <strong>maiden from Bumrah</strong>"
"full and angling in on middle, flicked away to square leg off the front foot"
"short and attacking the body of Amla, he is late onto the hook and <b>wears it below his chest</b>"
back of a length and skidding in off the surface to catch Amla on the shuffle. Stuck high on the front pad - bouncing over - and maybe even missing leg stump
"chest-hunting short ball on middle, Amla now controls a pull to fine leg"
"back of a length and on the hips at 140ks, Markram can't keep his flick down. He ends chipping the ball <strong>over a leaping Chahal at short midwicket</strong>"
"full and just a shade outside off, Markram deploys a solid stride and drives to mid-off"
"back of a length and sharply angling in from wide of the crease at a fourth-stump line, Amla presses forward and meets it with a dead-bat and a deadpan expression"
Amla jumps on top of a short ball outside off and punches up to mid-off
"back of a length and skidding in towards middle and leg, Amla eyes up a leg-side flick, instead <strong>chips a leading edge in front of Kohli at mid-off</strong>"
"back of a length and slanting in at off and middle, Amla jabs the ball to mid-on"
"back of a length and outside off, forced back to Bumrah"
"<strong>shot, Amla</strong>! Banged in short and just a shade outside off, Amla is quick to pick up that length. He swivels on the back foot and middles a pull to the square-leg boundary. Amla at his best"
"back of a length and on middle and leg, no room for Markram to free his arms, he forces the ball to mid-on"
"much fuller and on off stump, whipped past the right of mid-on for a single"
"<strong>Thakur has Amla strangled down the leg side</strong> Dug in short and angling down the leg side, Amla can't quite control the pull because of the line. And he is late onto the shot. He would have been better off had he left it alone. Instead, he gloves it behind to Dhoni. Thakur roars 'come on' and celebrates a wicket on return"
"full and slanting down leg again, Markram chases after it but does not make contact"
"full and angling in on middle, De Villiers gets right behind the line and plays it back to Thakur"
"short and skids on outside off, Thakur hits the bat hard, chopped to the left of short cover for a scampered single. A direct hit could have landed Markram in trouble"
"short and wide outside off, Markram chops the ball hard onto the ground, the force of the shot ensures the ball bursts through the hands of the backward point fielder"
"wide of the crease, angling into a gentle little push to mid-on"
"back of a length and slanting in at the top of off, 137ks, de Villiers meets it with a straight bat"
"short and wide outside off, de Villiers does not middle his cut but the ball still hurtles away to the boundary. Chopped between Rahane at point and Iyer at cover"
"shortish and skidding into leg stump, deflected to the right of the leg umpire for one"
"very full and heading down the leg side, fine leg is very fine to track down this leg glance"
"back of a length and just a shade outside off, not enough room for de Villiers, jabbed back to the bowler"
"starts off with a well-directed short ball that kicks up off the pitch, fended off by Markram"
"full and angling in at off, smart work from Markram and de Villiers. Tip and run to mid-on"
"full on the stumps, flicked to the left of short midwicket, who deflects the ball down to mid-on"
clipped off the hips to fine leg for sone
"full and wide outside off, Markram checks his square-drive and guides this slower offcutter to third man. He was <strong>fooled by the change of pace</strong>"
'Wait on' is the call from AB as he stands tall and sweetly punches this short ball from outside off to extra cover
"full-toss sprayed down the leg side, <strong>Dhoni dives, yes he dives</strong> to his left to stop the ball"
"dug in short on off stump, sits up to be hit. This chest-high ball is pulled into the grass banks beyond the square-leg boundary. Bam!"
"full and outside off, creamed through the line to cover"
"overpitched and outside off, drilled off the front foot to mid-off"
"slower ball, fuller and outside off, the batsman is early into the drive and skews it back to the bowler"
"Thakur strikes again, this time with the slower offcutter. Thakur's Mumbai team-mate Iyer claims an outstanding overhead catch. He hangs on even as he tumbles onto the ground. Pitched up outside off, the change of pace does the SA captain in. He plays a long way in front of his body and scoops a drive to cover. Great catch from Iyer after the drops earlier in the series. Perfect way for India to round out the Powerplay"
"full and outside off, slices a drive through point"
"back of a length and jumps off the deck outside off, Zondo hangs his bat out before swishing his bat inside the line"
"good length, angling in, and s<strong>traightening away off the seam past the outside edge</strong>"
"good length and angling in at off, blocked into the covers"
"short and angling in, Zondo is cramped for a pull. Flapped to the leg side, beside his feet"
"wide of the crease straying on the hips, worked to square leg"
"short and angling in at off stump, cramps de Villiers for room and rushes him into a pull. He short-arm flaps it in front of midwicket"
"full on middle, no turn, tapped down the ground past the right of the bowler"
"slower through the air on off stump, pushed straight back to Kuldeep"
"liberally tossed up at 75ks, de Villiers stretches out and works a single to the leg side"
"full and spins in, nudged to midwicket"
"pushed through on the pads, worked to the right of midwicket. Iyer moves and dives to his right but fumbles"
glanced off the pads through square leg
"short and at the body, de Villiers ventures across off and bunts the ball to the leg side for one"
"<strong>short, wide, Zondo finds the release</strong>. He reaches out with his hands, gets on top of the bounce, and utterly batters it through cover-point"
"back of a length, angling in, much closer to off stump, Zondo fiddles with it and is<strong> beaten on the outside edge</strong>"
"short on middle, shuffles across and nudges to midwicket"
"shortish and width, Zondo leans back and chops to third man"
"good length and Pandya explores the channel outside off, de Villiers shoulders arms"
"tossed outside off, driven right back to Kuldeep"
"full and angling away outside off, opens the face and drops the ball to point"
"Zondo forays down the track, Kuldeep pushes it flatter and quicker and hits the pad"
"good length and breaking into the pads at 75ks, Zondo skips back and clips a single to deep midwicket"
"looped up on leg stump and breaks away - <strong>googly from Kuldeep</strong> - not sure if AB picked it. He plays late, however and stabs an outside edge to point"
full and breaks back in with bounce to catch the thigh pad and <strong>loop to leg slip</strong>
"back of a length and outside off, the batsman allows the ball to come onto the bat. Slides it off the face to deep point"
"back of a length on off stump, de Villiers covers up in defence"
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
"pitched right up at off stump, 140ks, de Villiers drives but finds mid-on"
"good length and outside off, opens the face and dabs deftly through point. De Villiers suggests it might have been an offcutter"
"full and very wide outside off, square-driven to deep point"
Zondo dares to venture down the track against Kuldeep. He manufactures a loopy full-toss and lofts it over mid-off
"dragged down on leg stump, only 74ks, Zondo has all the time in the world to skip back and pummel a pull to the left of the square-leg umpire. No protection in the deep there"
"another donkey drop at 74ks, quietly blocked to the off side"
"full, non-turner on off, patted to the covers again"
"liberally tossed up on middle, Zondo shimmies out and scoops a drive in front of the bowler"
"looks like a googly, full and breaking away, Zonda plays late and pokes to point"
"tossed-up legbreak, starts on off and breaks away, driven with the turn through the covers for one"
"Chahal throws it up on middle, 79ks, non-turner, which is played back to the bowler"
"shorter legbreak outside off, Zondo rocks back and cracks a cut to the left of sweeper cover"
"<strong>deliciously tossed up on off stump</strong>, breaks away, fetches the edge but does not carry to slip"
"tossed full and wide, turns further away outside off, carves a drive to the left of the off-side sweeper"
"back of a length and breaks away outside off, de Villiers gives himself room and eases it through cover"
"good length and turning into the pads at 77ks, de Villiers works it away to deep square leg"
"Zondo steps out, meets the pitch of this full ball, and drives it back to the bowler. Kuldeep lets it burst through his hands"
"dropped short and just outside off, but de Villiers steps away outside leg, manufactures room and cuts through cover"
"tossed outside off at 78ks, slower and fuller, de Villiers ventures outside leg, gives himself room and drives it inside-out through the covers. Exquisite timing from de Villiers"
"<strong>Oooooh, de Villiers nearly chops on</strong>. Dangled up outside off, breaks back in, grazes the inside edge and runs past Dhoni's gloves. The result is a four"
"de Villiers shapes to reverse-sweep, throws Kuldeep off. The wristspinner loses his length and sends down a full-toss, which is reverse-swatted away past point. The drink should taste sweet for de Villiers"
"tosses it up on middle and off, defends"
"<b>given out lbw but Zondo reviews immediately</b>, and suggests he's hit the ball. The fun begins with a slow, loopy, hit-me-if-you-dare delivery on middle. Zondo chooses to play across the line, indulging in a paddle sweep. It's too full for such a shot, seems to sneak under his bat and carries on to snick a bit of the glove before it thuds into the bat. That means Zondo will be reprieved"
"and he celebrates his second(?) life. Picks the quicker ball, leaps back in his crease, sets up for the pull shot and hammers it away over deep midwicket. Splendid work. <b>That's the fifty partnership as well</b>, in only 52 balls"
"draws him forward with a tossed up delivery, Zondo defends"
"gets it to drift into the right-hander, who covers the line and blocks. Dhoni loves the way the ball comes in, says keep bowling that angle"
"long hop this time, with room to boot. Zondo smashes it straight of midwicket, sending the crowd sitting in the grassbanks scurrying"
"gets it above the batsman's eyeline, then it dips on De Villiers, on leg stump. He gets to the pitch and tickles it behind square leg"
another short ball - which Zondo pulls behind square leg
shimmies across a touch to have the leeway to lap sweep a ball pitching outside off
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
down the track for a straightforward push through extra cover. Good footwork
"loads of flight on middle, de Villiers blunts it well"
stretches forward to the pitch of a tossed up legbreak and smothers all the turn
"nice drift into the right-hander again, and Zondo defends. Dhoni goes 'Oh yes, Chahal-ee'"
"advances at the bowler to then nudge a ball on his pads down the ground to long-on. Excellent use of the feet again, no premeditation"
"pulls his length back, hikes his pace up, to only 80 kph though as opposed to the usual 75. De Villiers defends firmly"
"<b>the stumps take a beating</b>. So does AB's rep; even he has not picked the legspinner's variation. He sets up for a cut shot, making tons of room outside leg, expecting a legbreak. But the ball pitches and skids on straight - like a flipper - and beats him completely"
"pushes it through again, outside off, Klaasen flat bats to mid-off"
"loads of flight, on leg stump, and Klaasen has to hurry into his defensive push off the front foot"
"slow through the air, the ball lined up on leg stump again. Klaasen blocks"
"<b>googly again</b>, and Klaasen picks it off the pitch. Tries to punch through the covers but is beaten"
works it away through square leg
shifts deep in his crease to handle a googly pitching short of a length on leg stump.
"massive grunt of effort for an 80 kph delivery, tossed up outside off. Zondo leans into a drive to long-off"
"brings him forward on leg stump, but by not allowing him to get under the ball, or letting him read the way it turns, the batsman can only defend"
"another quicker delivery, pitching on middle stump and skidding through, like the ball that took out AB. Zondo though, playing a straight bat shot, survives"
"gets down the pitch, but Chahal pushes it onto leg stump, denying him room. Zondo pads it off"
nudges it with a closed face to midwicket
the short ball outside off is cut to deep point
presents the full face to perhaps his quickest ball at 83 kph and on a good length
<b>hits him on the hip</b> as a short ball that he wants to pull doesn't quite bounce as he wants it to
"back of a length and outside off, Zondo punches it away with a vertical bat. Single to deep point"
"good length, outside off, no shot"
strides out towards the good length ball outside off and then lets it pass
looks solid as he pushes the length ball into the covers
"gets the opportunity to drive, but he doesn't quite get the gap he is looking for at extra cover."
the angle into the right-hander becomes a bit too acute and he picks the ball away to deep square leg
turns it through midwicket
eases it down to long-off
gets the ball to drift in just enough that Zondo ends up playing down the wrong line. Manages an inside edge
shifts outside leg to drive the flighted delivery inside out through cover
firm drive to long-off as he reads the legbreak and takes a confident step forward to the pitch of the ball
"a fine drive, only sullied by the fact that it finds short cover"
"gets into the drive a touch too early and so instead of finding the gap to mid-off's left, the ball skews off the inside half of the bat to mid-off"
"nice and tight on off stump, Klaasen keeps it out"
"searches for the drive on the up - drawn into the shot by the width on offer - but Klaasen mistimes it again. Looks like the pitch is slowing down, as expected"
"fullish on off stump, steers it to backward point"
short of a length and that allows Klaasen the time he needs to get into better attacking positions. Carves it to deep point
"tossed up outside off, leaves it alone"
"looks for a slog sweep, but Chahal outwits him by tossing the ball higher and therefore making it pitch closer to the batsman. No leverage to get under it"
nudges a full delivery on middle and leg to midwicket
"another massively flighted delivery, which Klaasen handles better with a drive to long-on"
"on the pads, Zondo works it to long-on"
"good bowling. He makes it drift in on off stump, has it pitching on a good length, so Klaasen can't get to the pitch and now has to look out for the turn. That means he can't attack, he has to make sure he doesn't get himself out and so the only option is to block"
bangs it in and Zondo pulls it sweetly to deep square leg
"goes a touch wide of the crease for this fuller ball on off stump. Klaasen drives to mid-off and then ends up staring face-to-face with Pandya, the fast bowler having taken a long followthrough"
"<b>quick single</b> and it ends up possible because Dhawan can't quite pick up the ball cleanly. He rushes in from short cover to track down Klaasen's punch and had he fielded cleanly, Zondo might have been struggling at the keeper's end"
"full and outside off, steers it to short cover"
too close to cut and Zondo is beaten on the inside edge. That seemed to move in off the pitch
"allows the fullish delivery to come to him, hoping to dab it to third man, but he ends up hitting the ball to point"
whips a length ball from outside off stump to midwicket.
stands up tall behind the short of a length delivery outside off and hits to cover
cramps him for room and Klaasen turns the back of a length delivery to mid-on
ferociously hit! Showcases his power as he stands tall against a short ball outside off and drags it to the midwicket boundary. It's the first one in over half an hour
"responds with a bouncer, and it comes straight at Klaasen's head. The batsman takes evasive action"
"spectacular hit again! Bumrah continues the short-ball attack, but this doesn't get up, and on a slow pitch, a waist-high ball is ripe for the pummeling. Klaasen hammers it over midwicket"
there's plenty of space at midwicket for singles and this short ball on middle is the perfect one to deposit in the gap there
"good length on off stump, whips it to midwicket, that gap's been plugged"
firm push back at the bowler
"charges out of his crease to lift a length ball over mid-off. Calculated hit, made possibly by his making room on leg stump to exploit the man standing up inside the circle"
"pushes it back down the pitch, the ball bouncing right over the bowler and going down to mid-off"
"the bouncer, at 130 kph, but it seems sharper than that. Klaasen is certainly late in his pull shot and awkwardly fends it towards square leg"
"back of a length on off stump, taps it back to Bumrah"
"plenty of bottom hand in this punch to mid-on, getting up to his full height to handle a short of a length delivery"
"scoops a good low catch at short cover and Kohli comes up with a little gesture at the batsman, the finger on his lips. Good bowling from Bumrah, on a slow pitch, he dishes out the offcutter. The length is full, the line is just that tiny bit wide of off stump to draw the batsman into a drive. Klaasen hits it straight at the fielder"
"fullish on of stump, blocks"
"good length ball on off stump, keeps it out"
"walks down the pitch, has to deal with another Bumrah offcutter, and does so well enough to pinch a single through the left of midwicket"
flirts with a back of a length delivery outside off and it zips past the outside edge. Thakur looks quicker than the speed gun says he is (136 kph)
"<b>that's a ripper at deep third man</b>! Jasprit Bumrah, take a bow! He's not among the safest hands in the Indian line-up, but he responds to this upper cut from Behardien well enough, sprinting to his right, keeping his eyes on the ball, diving to get to it, and then it just sticks in his right hand. Lucky break for India (not that they really needed it)"
defends a shortish delivery on off stump
drives a length ball back to the bowler
"<b>falls short of long leg</b>. 'Come on, buddy,' is the yell from near the stump mic as they watch Chahal running up from the boundary but not going for the catch. Not sure it would have carried even if he dived. Nevertheless, Thakur is showing good value on a hard pitch - he's getting the ball to zip through, and on this occasion it bounces a lot more than Morris expects as he goes for the pull"
"full on middle, defends"
"fullish on off stump, Morris keeps it out"
drives the fuller ball back at Pandya
stands tall against the short ball and clips it to the right of a wide mid-on
"pitches it up outside off, Zondo drives to cover"
not quite short enough for the cut. He goes for the shot on the basis of the room on offer and is beaten. Zondo has now spent 19 balls in the 40s. He is still three away from a maiden fifty.
goes for the pull and mistimes the shot to deep square leg
"he begins a new spell with a <strong>googly that breaks away</strong>, bounces, Zonda hangs back, picks it off the pitch, and rides it with soft hands past a diving slip fielder"
"this full ball breaks into the pads, duly picked off through the midwicket region"
"<strong>Kuldeep adds his name into the wickets column with a wrong'un</strong>. The wristspinner has Morris holing out to long-off, where Dhawan pouches it safely and slaps his thigh in celebration. Tossed up liberally around off and breaks away. Morris looks to slug the googly away - against the break. He can't get underneath this very full one either. All he can do is to skew a catch to Dhawan in the deep via a leading edge"
"looks like another googly, which is prodded into the covers"
"full and outside off, tapped to long-off off the front foot. After being stuck in the forties for 22 balls, <strong>Zondo brings up a fifty</strong>"
"floated up on the stumps, kept out"
"looped up and spins away outside off, driven with the break through the covers"
"full and outside off, forward and jabbed into the covers"
"wrong'un from Chahal but finishes outside leg stump, Andile taps it back to the bowler"
"Andile shapes for a reverse-sweep, Chahal held this one back. Reversed straight to backward point"
"floated full and outside off, Andile presses forward and drives up to mid-off"
"pushed through flatter and quicker on middle, played back to the bowler"
"full and dips at leg stump, stabbed back past Kuldeep's right"
"short, wide, cracked through the covers off the back foot"
"lobbed up on off, dips, draws the batsman forward and <strong>turns past the outside edge</strong>"
"<b>Dropped</b>. Slower through the air and spins back in - <strong>wrong' un </strong>- picked off the pitch and jabbed back to Kuldeep. He drops a low return catch. Looks like Kuldeep has jammed the fingers while attempting the catch, and sinks to his knees in pain. He needs medical attention after the blow to his right hand"
"flighted on middle, defended back off the front foot"
"back of a length and turns back in, Andile reads it off the pitch and whips off the back foot through square leg"
"tosses on the pads, worked to square leg"
"slower through the air, down the track and firmly flicked to wide long-on"
"full and outside off, 78ks, driven back to the left of Chahal"
"Zondo makes swinging room by backing away outside off, Chahal throws it up full and wide outside off, turns away. Sliced over extra cover"
"pushed through and attacking the stumps now, blocked back to Chahal"
"Chahal hangs this legbreak up in the air and gets it to drop down outside off. Zondo, having made room by skipping outside leg, drives inside-out but can't elevate the shot over Pandya at deep cover. India's wristspinners are at it again"
"short and outside off, Morkel goes back and whips to midwicket"
"on a length and outside off, pushed back to Kuldeep"
"good length and breaks away outside off, punched up to short cover"
"skids through on off, blocked to midwicket off the back foot"
"lobbed up on off stump, Morne Morkel sizes it up and launches it straight over Kuldeep's head. He can brag about this strike to Albie. Clean, smooth swing"
Morkel hangs back to this googly - picks it off the pitch - and punches down the ground
"full on middle and leg, tucked off the back foot to midwicket"
"lobbed up on middle stump, blocked from the crease"
reverse-swept from the stumps but only as far as Dhawan diving to his left at backward point
"skidding into the pads, flicked off the back foot to deep square leg"
"slower legbreak, 77ks, turns in to catch the pad. Kohli tells Chahal it's the right speed"
"a bit too full for the sweep, and umpire Aleem Dar gives Morne Morkel out lbw. Slower through the air again, dips, creating distance between the bat and the pitch to hit the inside of the front pad in front of middle stump. Morkel sweeps across the line and misses. He <b>challenges the on-field out decision</b>. Not bat/glove involved. Was it turning past the leg stump? Impact in line but the tracker indicates the ball would have spun past leg stump"
"full and dips at leg stump, backs away and squeezes to mid-off"
"back of a length and breaks away outside off, back-foot punch to cover"
"wrong'un, poked off the back foot to point off an outside edge"
"dropped short and wide outside off, cut off the back foot to deep point"
"Morne ventures down the track, manufactures a full-toss and drives to long-on"
"lobbed up outside off, not much turn, driven straight into the covers"

"shorter and wider outside off, flayed through the covers off the back foot"
"tossed on off stump, defended into the covers off the front foot"
"loopy legbreak outside off, not much turn, prodded to the off side off the front foot"
"full and breaking in, prodded to the off side yet again"
"floated up full and outside off, the batsman stretches out and drives solidly to long-off"
"back of a length and angling away outside off from over the stumps, punched away to sweeper cover"
"short, wide, big Morne reaches out for the ball and chops a bottom edge to third man"
"wide half-volley outside off, Andile stretches out and clatters it through the line. Smashed to the cover boundary"
"pitched up and outside off, a wafty drive to the covers ensues"
"shorter and outside off, dabbed with the angle to backward point"
"low full-toss on off, Andile walks across off stump, twirls his wrists, and whips the ball away to the left of long-on. Dhawan chases the ball to his left and tumbles. But instead of swatting the ball inside the field of play he sends it over the boundary"
"banged in short and angling across off, fended back to the bowler"
"slower offcutter outside off, Morkel swings way too early... and misses"
"full on middle, Morkel stays leg-side of the ball and stabs to cover. Kohlu fumbles at cover and concedes a single"
"off-stump yorker, top stuff from Bumrah, jabbed back to him"
"full-toss on middle, bunted through midwicket"
"a horrible mix-up between the wickets, and India can't capitalise. Morkel stays leg-side of this ball and tips it to backward point. Andile and Morkel hesitate, then set off. Big Morne dishes out a full-stretch dive at the non-striker's end.  The throw is wide, and Bumrah can't gather it cleanly"
"looks like a slower ball, 114ks it is, Morkel waits for the ball to arrive. It's full and in the slot. Morkel muscles the offcutter into the grass banks beyond midwicket. Albie, are you watching Morne smoking these?"
"another slower ball but it's short and wide outside off, lashed square through the off side this time"
"short on middle, dabbed behind wide of Dhoni behind the stumps for one"
"Big Morne gives himself room and scythes it straight into the lap of sweeper cover. Short and wide outside off, Morne stays leg-side of the ball, and holes out to Iyer, who clings onto his second catch of the day - this is a dolly"
"full and wide outside off, Tahir stays leg-side of the ball and pushes through the covers"
"back of a length and angling across off, forced off the back foot to backward point"
"back of a length on middle, tapped to midwicket. There's a mix-up between the wickets again but Tahir undoes his steps in time to beat a direct hit at his end. Accurate throw from Bumrah"
"full on middle, Tahir stays beside the line and pushes it back to Thakur"
"bouncer on middle, flies through the keeper, wide called"
"short, wide, cracked off the back foot to sweeper cover"
clipped off the pads to deep midwicket
"slower cutter? outside off, Tahir slashes and watches the ball slide under his bat to Dhoni"
"overpitched and outside off, square-driven straight to point"
"short and just a shade outside off, throws his bat at the ball and bottom-edges a cut to point"
"shortish and outside off, punched up to sweeper cover"
"Tahir moves away outside leg, Bumrah chases him with his exaggerated angle, prodded to midwicket off the back foot"
"Tahir has the tendency to stay leg-side of the ball. This is pitched up on middle, Tahir stays leg-side of the ball, both feet inside the crease, he winds up reaching out for the ball with his hands and scoops a drive to Kohli at short cover. And <b>that's Kohli's 100th catch in ODIs</b>"
"nice and full, angling in to beat the inside edge and strike the back pad. It looks adjacent but umpire George shakes his head"

"full and outside off again, Andile reaches out for the ball with his hands and carts it up and over the covers"
"chest-high short ball on leg stump stump, Andile sits back, takes it on and launches a pull over the long leg boundary for back-to-back sixes. <b>Andile drags SA past 200 in grand style</b>"
"knuckle ball, drifts away outside off, Andile has a big hoick and does not make contact"
"<b>Thakur has Andile chipping a return catch</b>. Full and around off stump, <b>possibly a knuckle ball</b>, Andile aims to work it to the leg side. Instead, he leading-edges it back to Thakur. He bags four wickets on return"
"starts by tucking up the left-hander, who is happy to flick it towards square leg"
"lovely channel, just a shade outside off, with plenty of potential to draw the batsman into a false shot. Rohit though shoulders arms"
"<b>cuts back into the right-hander</b> as Morkel pins Rohit on the pad. Muted appeal though considering an inside edge, and the height issue"
gets in behind a back of a length ball on off stump and runs it to backward point
"<b>the leading edge</b> sneaks between second slip and gully. A half-chance for South Africa, created by a spectacularly full length delivery from Morkel. He doesn't normally go further up than 6 m, but this certainly is and it makes Rohit fall over while playing a flick shot"
"the cut shot with as much authority as anyone could hope for. Rohit stands tall, he plays it mostly off the front foot too. Shows this is a good batting pitch"
"hustles Dhawan with a short of a length delivery that cramps the batsman for room. Attempts a flick, gets hit on the thigh"
"back of a length on middle and off, Dhawan plonks the straight bat on it"
rolls his wrists as he gets on top of a bouncer on off stump and pulls it to midwicket. Good shot. No runs
good length ball decks in off the pitch and beats Dhawan for pace as he tries to flick through square leg
"back of a length angled across the left-hander, Dhawan lets it go"
"full and outside off, Dhawan doesn't bother with it again"
"gorgeous shot, getting up off his toes to tackle Morkel's extra bounce and easing the shortish delivery ever so gently through point"
a little too leg-sidish and Dhawan will feel aggrieved at missing out on the pull shot
"climbs on Dhawan, but he looks in control behind it, letting the 141 kph ball come up to his chest and then deftly turning it behind square leg"
"on middle and off, Rohit plays the angle as he nudges to midwicket"
"sweeper cover only has a few yards to cover to his right, but Rohit's timing is just pure awesomesauce. Just shifts his weight back after that forward press and lashes the short and wide delivery away"
<b>keeps low</b> and Rohit does really really well to protect his off stump. Credit to his watching the ball and urging himself to play late
"back of a length and outside off, Rohit directs traffic to the wicketkeeper"
whirls his wrists over the short ball outside off and sends it to deep point
"'yes, two,' is the call as soon as Rohit leans forward and flicks a ball on middle and off behind square leg"
solid defence when the ball is pitched up on middle stump
"<b>top-edges the pull</b> and Klaasen takes the offering gleefully! Rohit thinks the shot is on because the line is on leg stump, and his intention is to only help it to fine leg. But Ngidi generates extra bounce by hitting the deck and provides South Africa with a massive breakthrough. Also, the ball is only 126 kph, so the miscue doesn't really travel too far"
gets up on his tip toes to glide the short ball on and around off stump to gully
"full and down leg, even those wrists that rule the universe can't catch up with it"
"they keep pushing him back in his crease, but Kohli makes sure to play with a straight bat"
"bouncer on middle and leg, Dhawan avoids it easily enough"
"good bowling as he tests Dhawan's judgment around the off stump. It pleads for the outside edge, but the batsman shoots it down and shoulders arms"
"half an appeal for a caught behind, but it comes off the thigh pad. Good work from Klaasen though, running and diving to his right"
"another appeal for a strangle down leg, a more vociferous appeal and it ends the moment South Africa look at the umpire and see him spreading his arms wide instead of putting the finger up. Ultra-Edge shows no spike as ball passes bat"
"cramps him up on middle and off, blocks"
on the pads again and Dhawan flicks it to long leg
forces himself off his feet in an effort to get on top of a short delivery outside off. And then comes a punch to point
"short and wide, Dhawan slaps it to deep point"
"a lovely ball to pull to fine leg, wandering harmlessly down leg, but Kohli misses it altogether"
raises the straight bat up high to deal with another back of a length delivery on off stump
<b>past by the fielder at leg gully before he realises a catch is on</b>. Phehlukwayo is really there for the flick off the hip when the ball gets big on Kohli. Not for a full blooded pull shot
whips it off his toes through midwicket
"zips through, past the batsman, past the keeper and into the boundary boards. The bouncer from Ngidi rises sharply on Dhawan, who looks to hook it from way outside off, and is comfortably beaten"
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
"swats it to the square leg boundary. He took a little time defending these short balls, but now seems to have had enough. Takes on the white thing coming at his head and pulls it powerfully past short square leg"
"flirts with it outside off, and a hint of movement, but more importantly extra bounce secures the outside edge as the ball races past gully's right"
blocks a shortish delivery through cover point
"good length ball outside off, lets it through"
"shortish on middle and off, defends"
slices a shortish delivery outside off to point
opens the face and runs the back of a length delivery down to deep third man
"short and outside off, Dhawan mistimes the cut in front of square"
gets on top of a steepler on off stump and blunts it effortlessly
"pulls the short ball disdainfully through square leg. South Africa's big, mean quicks are targeting the Indian captain with bouncers. He's swatting them away like flies."
"absolutely imperious! This short ball only rises up towards his chest and Kohli is in prime position, shuffling across to pull the ball in front of square."
"good length ball on off stump, dabs it into the covers for a single"
opens the face to steer the shortish delivery to the right of gully
"<b>nearly plays on</B> as Morkel probes away, denying Dhawan even the slightest hint of room"
"goes short, angles it across the left-hander, Dhawan helps himself to a pull, taking special care to place it well in front of square to avoid the fielder in the deep"
deflects it off his hip towards square leg
"<b>inside edge</b> as Kohli looks to force the ball through extra cover, but it cuts into him, and more dangerously, gets big on him"
blocks a shortish delivery to cover point
"hits short of a length too, and Dhawan blocks it, leaping back in his crease"
"<b>gets it to deck back in at Dhawan</B>, who plays late and pushes it gently through the covers"
rock-solid defence to a good length ball on off stump
blunts any threat this back of a length delivery on off stump has
"sweetly hit towards the long-on boundary. Phew, the ball flies away off that straight bat."
"steps out but Morris is wise to those tricks, pushing the wider to make sure Dhawan will have to reach away from his body to hit the ball, and therefore lose his shape"
rises with the back of a length delivery outside off and guides it to backward point
"this effort to bounce Kohli has so far helped him ease into his innings. Case in point, this cut shot. Stands up tall, has all the time to pick his spot and nails it sweeper cover's right"
"splendid work! Kohli's getting used to this bouncer barrage. He's shuffling outside off, he's setting himself up for the pull and he muscles the short ball away so hard that Zondo on the boundary, despite a superb, full-length dive to his left, is of no use"
gets up off his toes and glides a back of a length delivery to deep point
"the short ball again, but at a slower pace, Kohli has to adjust his bat-swing as he pulls down to fine leg"
shimmies across to his off stump to have the upper hand in pulling a short ball away to fine leg
looks to hit way too hard and as a result the swat to deep point trickles away to the fielder
pushes the back of a length delivery outside off to deep point
defends a good length ball into the covers for a single
"fullish and outside off, blocks to cover"
"good short ball, at 137 kph, rising up to his throat, on and around off stump, so the hook shot is dangerous. Forces Kohli to take evasive action"
"fullish on off stump, pats it down the pitch"
"sublime! There is precious little room to work with, but Dhawan flays it behind point with monstrous power. Credit to his concentration on playing late and keeping his shape"
"sets up for the pull, but the short ball, coming off the pitch rather slowly, makes Dhawan take evasive action"
"<b>snorter!</b> South Africa have tried and tried to get these two batsmen fending at short balls. And they get their wish with Ngidi hitting the deck and finding extra pace. Dhawan tries to block it, then he tries to follow it, and in the end he ends up beaten and looking very very awkward"
"smacks it straight to point! It's there for the cut. And the cut comes out, with plenty of power. So much that Zondo ends up having the juggle the ball. But all is well and South Africa have their second wicket"
nudges a back of a length delivery on off stump through midwicket
"whips it away to the long leg boundary. This is another freebie to Kohli, a ball slanting into the pads, on the half-volley"
opens the face to deal with a fullish delivery straightening on off stump. Rahane isn't yet keep to press forward and good on Morris for recognising that
"taps a back of a length delivery to point, softly enough that they pinch a single"
"<b>kicks up off a length</b> and Kohli, coming forward to block, has to suddenly worry about popping a catch to point"
"that's pristine! This dude can play the cover drive hopping on one leg with ants in his pants. Off the back foot, vertical bat, it's face angled to pick the gap. Too good"
"fullish on off stump, drills it to the left of mid-off and pinches a single. Is there such a thing as a dot ball to Kohli??"
and now Rahane's turn. Very minimalist as he presents the full face of the bat to a good length ball on middle and watches it scurry away
"flays it to the point boundary. Poor bowling from Morkel. Goes short, but it barely rises, not even up to the waist. Rahane slashes it away"
"full on middle and leg, sends it packing to long leg"
flicks it off his pads to long leg
"short of a length and outside off, Rahane pushes it to cover"
opens the face as he slices the 137 kph short ball to point

"full on middle and leg, flicks it to deep square leg"
"back of a length and outside off, defends"
drills the half-volley to the long-off boundary and brings up his fourth fifty-plus score in six innings. The way he keeps his shape and powers balls with just his bottom hand is pretty special
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
"he is originally looking to sway away from the short ball, but it comes off the pitch so slowly, and he is in such outrageous form that he spots a scoring opportunity and pulls the ball - which has already risen above his head - in front of midwicket."
looks for the ramp as Morris bounces him again. No luck there
short and Rahane is drawn into a cut after seeing plenty of width outside off. Slashed to deep point
"back of a length and heading towards the top of off stump, Kohli hangs back and stops it in its tracks"
"good length and attacking off stump again, tapped back down the pitch past the right of a tumbling Morkel"

"slower legbreak on off, spins away, defended with the break to cover"

"short and outside off, Kohli rides the bounce and scythes a cut over backward point. Kohli now has the<a href='http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;filter=advanced;orderby=runs;template=results;tournament_type=2;type=batting;view=series' target='_blank'> record</a> for most runs in a bilateral ODI series"
"And the India captain celebrates the landmark with a regal stroke. Good length and outside off, Kohli drives it on the up and through the covers. There's no stopping that. There's no stopping him"
