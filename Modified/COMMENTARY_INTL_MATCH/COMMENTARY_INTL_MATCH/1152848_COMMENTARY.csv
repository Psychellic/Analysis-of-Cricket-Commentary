"fuller, fired in towards off stump at the angle Warner has struggled against this series, but clipped out to square leg for a couple"
"inswinger on a length, shoulders arms to it"
"<strong>snorter! </strong>And given! Length ball, hits the seam and moves away from the bat, and a thin edge through the keeper, but reviewed instantly by Warner... oh, <strong>nothing on UltraEdge! </strong> England went up immediately but Warner reviewed almost as quickly. Definitely a sound, but it might have been the bat flicking the pad on the way through and rightly overturned"

"bangs in the short ball, snaking back at Warner, who crouches low to get out of the way"
"ooh, <b>that's a snorter!</b> Jagging away at 88mph/141kph and past the outside edge"
"<b>finds the edge this time!</b> Precision engineering from Archer, he recalibrates by a couple of millimetres and rips out Warner to get the crowd on their feet! Touching 90mph, straightening off the pitch as Warner felt for it on off stump - not much he could do to play a ball like that, bar miss it. Bulls-eye from Archer to remove the Bull!"

"lovely line from Broad, almost does too much as it shapes away past the groping bat"
"<b>timbeeeeeeeeeeeeer!</b> Kisses the top of off stump, Head is lopped off by an <i>absolute jaffa!</i> Broad wheels away in delight, almost OMB-ing himself... Not a great shot from Head, on second glance, aiming a drive down the ground as the ball left him and twanged the woodwork. But Broad was on the dollar, dollar bills, ya'll"
"flung down wide of the stumps, Wade watches it through"
"banged in, 88mph/140kph bumper, awkward line around Labuschagne's left shoulder and he does well to sway out of the way"

"cranks this up to <b>91mph/147kph</b>, plays it well, dropped softly into the off side, they'll take the single - <b>applause from the Australia balcony for Labuschagne's half-century</b>, another fighting knock from him"
short and down the leg side
"bowled, <b>trickles back on to leg stump!</b> England have another! Archer continues to attack the body and this time gets the bonus, as the ball deflects down off the thigh pad via Wade's glove and into the base of the stump, with just enough force to dislodge the bail! Three in 15 balls now"

"that was a bluff from Broad, who digs it in short and Paine swats away a pull, <b>bringing up the Australia 150</b>"
"oof, <b>right in the spuds!</b> Labuschagne is down... This looks to have done him more damage than the blow to the head from Archer last week! Back of a length, whirring back in past the defensive push, smack into the crown jewels"
"shortish outside off, Paine goes back and leaves"
"dug in short and Paine pulls, they think about a second... but Paine declines, which seems a sensible call as the throw comes in and Bairstow demolishes the stumps"
"squared up, fenced in the air... <b>just beyond the reach of third slip!</b> Burns was stood a little wide, threw himself to his right, but couldn't lay a finger on it! Four more to Labuschagne is the result"

That's the set-up Woakes was after, a series of outswingers and then moves one back to trap T-Paine - who didn't pick it - lbw. All of a sudden, things are going England's way..."
"fired down the leg side, looks to flick off the hip but straight through to Bairstow"

"pushed down the leg side, Cummins looks to work to leg but can't connect, stifled appeal but nowhere near it"
"edged, gone, and <strong>five for Archer! </strong> Reviewed very quickly by Cummins. England liked the look of it, quite full but wide of off stump and he had a waft at it. Clear spike on UltraEdge, much to Cummins' bemusement, and that's a first international five-wicket haul for Archer!"

"full, straight, <b>given! Archer has six!</b> Lyon was looking to nudge this into the leg side from a long way across, was trapped in front, and with no reviews left that will be that. And it was smashing into leg stump regardless, ball-tracking shows. What a turnaround for England. At drinks, Australia were cruising at 133-2, and making batting look easy, but Archer has brought about a slow-burning collapse under murky grey skies"
"86mph to start, length ball and shoulders arms"
"length ball, blocked out to short cover and they take a <b>sharp single!</b> Good, alert running, just like Warner/Marnus yesterday"
"length ball outside off stump, good carry off the pitch as Roy shoulder arms demonstratively"
"full of a length on fourth stump, defensive prod, ball hits the shoulder of the bat and <strong>squirts away</strong> through the gully for four"
"back-of-a-length, 86mph, shifts back and defends"
"length ball, worked out to wide mid-on for another purposeful single"
"big shout to start! Length ball, hint of movement off the seam, traps Roy on the crease and strikes him on the back leg, loud appeal, but they decide against a review. And a good call, heading over the top"
"slightly fuller, just outside off stump. Roy looks to work this through wide mid-on KP-style, but can't connect cleanly"
"length again, can't get it away"
"length ball, blocked to mid-on off the back foot"
"<strong>beaten!</strong> Length ball, wide of off stump, Roy flashes at it with minimal foot movement and is drawn into the play-and-miss"
"length ball, angled in towards off stump, Roy again clips into the leg side but finds the fielder"
"full on off stump, Burns defends"
"back of a length, on leg stump, looks to work off the hip, and squirts just in front of short leg off the thigh"
"fuller, 87mph, angled across into the off side and blocked to cover"
"short ball, slides it across the left-hander, ducks underneath it"
blocked with a full face
"length ball, angling across Burns who shoulders arms on length"
"back of a length, blocked off the back foot to mid-on"
"bit of width this time, 87mph, and <strong>punched </strong>through the covers off the back foot for four!"
"fuller this time, on fourth stump angling in, Roy drives sweetly but Hazlewood gets down well off his own bowling"
"left alone outside off, but this wasn't miles away, bit of movement in off the seam"
"<strong>edged, and gone! </strong> You know the score, really: just full of a length, wide of off stump, Roy looks to drive but there's a little bit of movement which draws the edge, and Warner holds the catch at first slip! Not much of a shot, that, and the pressure on Roy's spot has just gone up another notch!"
"quite open again, length ball, defends and squirts away to gully off the shoulder"
"length ball, angling in from wide on the crease, shoulders arms"
"<b>beaten!</b> 87mph, angling into Burns again but moves away off the seam. Missed it by a long way, didn't pick the outswinger"
"a touch wider, and left alone this time on length"
"back-of-a-length ball, 88mph, defended crisply into the off side"
"bumper, very straight but ducks underneath it"
"shortish, and defended off the back foot, in control of the shot"
"<strong>edged, gone!</strong> Great catch by Warner at first slip! And another duck for Joe Root. A good ball, just full of a length, hint of seam movement but Root just hangs the bat there apologetically. Finds the edge, and Warner snaffles it at slip. England in all sorts!"
"fullish again, angled in and blocked firmly by Denly"
"edged again! But falls short of third slip. Length ball, draws him forward, hits the shoulder of the bat and goes through to Harris on the bounce"
"sprays it down the leg side, and flies through to Paine"
"hit on the pad, <strong>and given!</strong> Reviewed by Denly, and might be a touch high. No bat involved... but it's way over the top, another shocker from Wilson! Length ball, hits the seam, Denly missed it by a mile and was hit on the back leg, but that was flying over the top of middle"
"yorker, dug out to mid-off"
"length ball, angled in, very straight and clipped away through midwicket for four"
"wide on the crease, back of a length, and defends off the back foot into the leg side"
"played and missed, hangs in outside off stump on fifth stump, deviates away off the seam and <strong>beats Burns</strong>. Flies through Paine's gloves, good carry from Cummins"
"fuller, this one doesn't get up off the pitch and beats his outside edge again"
"length ball, angling in and blocked out to cover with his weight back"
"slightly wider ball, 87mph, and gets forward to defend"
"beaten outside off, 85mph, holds its line outside the off stump and Denly's apologetic prod doesn't make contact with it"
"straighter, angling in, looks to work into the leg side but thuds into his pad. A stifled appeal, but always sliding down"
"that's the nagging Hazlewood length, on fourth stump and Denly is defending"
"strays down leg this time, looks to work to leg, clips off the pad and spills out for a leg bye"
"slightly full, <b>thwacks the pad</b> as he tries to work to leg, but a little tickle on it via the inside edge"
"too straight this time, and worked off the pads through midwicket"
"left alone on length, nips in off the seam and flies over the off stump"
"left alone again, slightly wider and flies through with good carry"
"left alone on length again, hits him on the thigh pad on its way through but too high"
"86mph, and a <strong>big shout</strong> from Cummins! Tries to defend off the back foot, a touch too short, angling into him, strikes him in front but flying over the top"
"<strong>beaten! </strong>Great nut, a real beauty up at 88mph, length ball, nips in off the seam and flies off the pitch between Denly's inside edge and his body"
"<strong>how did that miss?</strong> Jags in off the seam again, beats him again. Horrible start for Denly"
"fires it down the leg side at 62mph, and clipped out into the leg side for one"
"wide of the off stump, and left alone. Bit of bounce on the way through, and Paine likes it a lot!"
"draws Denly forward, who smothers the spin on the front foot"
"straighter, looks to work into the leg side and skews out towards leg gully off the front pad"
"rocks back with an open stance, and clonks a single into the covers"
"looks to work into the on side, but finds the fielder"
"bumper, gets big on him and Burns, jumping in the crease, is hit on the forearm. Ball falls down at his feet, but he wasn't in control at all"
"full of a length and straight, defended into the off side"
"length ball outside off, driven out to cover point for no run"
"<strong>gloved behind and Burns is gone!</strong> Jheez, this isn't a great way to go. Bouncer from Cummins, heading down the leg side, Burns launches into a pull shot looking to take advantage, but can only glove it through to Paine who takes a simple catch!"
"length ball, shoulders arms outside off"
"88mph, fuller and straighter, looks to work into the leg side but finds the midwicket fielder"
"full, on fifth or sixth stump, and Denly defends on the front foot"
"fourth stump this time, angling in to the right-hander, goes straight on and defends with a full face"
"short ball outside off, 86.6mph, drops the hands and sways inside the line"
"<strong>beaten again</strong>, brilliant control from Hazlewood, another beauty which nips off the seam and Denly plays and misses <em>again</em>!"
"and finally he gets off the mark! Slightly fuller, enough width to get on the front foot and <strong>creams </strong>a drive through the covers"
"half-volley length on fourth stump, and defended to mid-on"
"short ball from round the wicket, Stokes swivels and pulls towards square leg"
"back of a length, 86mph/138kph and coming back in, wide enough to leave"
"slightly overpitched, in the slot to drive and Stokes leans on a push through the covers to get off the mark"
"sliding leg side, flick and a miss"
dug in short and again Stokes plays a controlled pull out to deep square leg for one
"ooh, Denly tries to leave, <b>almost plays on!</b> That lack of control against Cummins still evident"
pitched up and met solidly on the front foot
"nibbling a touch off the straight as Denly gets front on, squeezed towards gully via bat and pad, I think"
straying a touch on to the pads and he nurdles the one square of midwicket to get off strike
"angled across in the channel, tight line but Stokes judges it pretty well and leaves"
"touch short of a length, 87mph/139kph and rising through to Paine as Stokes leaves"
"pitched up, gets him driving, but that's not gone where he was aiming... thick-edged in front of square on the leg side for a single"
shortish and swinging a touch as Stokes attempts to flick off his pads but misses
"full, but not a half-volley, <b>cushioned through backward point by Stokes</b>, lovely timing and it races to the rope"
"that <i>is</i> a half-volley.. but it's wide, barely reachable, <b>and skewed to slip!</b> Stokes has thrown it away, almost literally! He was stretching for a wild drive, only managed to get the toe of the bat on it, and sent a high, fast edge that Warner snapped up above his left shoulder! Almost as if designed in a lab to prove the old axiom that drek gets wickets"
"length ball around off stump, Bairstow shows it a straight bat"
"angled in straight, 87mph/139kph and tapped towards mid-on"
"shortish, seaming away at 87mph as Bairstow hangs back and lets it go"
"good length, defended coming across on off"
"that's a spandex-tight line, maybe a touch short, 86mph/138kph as Denly covers it and shoulders arms"
"<b>beaten!</b> Pushing forward and so nearly sucked into the vortex! Maybe, just <i>maybe</i> held his bat inside the line at the last"
fired in on the stumps and tucked back into the on side
"short of a length, Denly fences at it, <b>chopped past his stumps off the inside edge!</b> Picks up a couple to fine leg"
"back of a length outside off, sways out of the way"
"short and sliding into the body, 89mph/143kph as YJB flicks at it and they pick up one down to fine leg"
"good pace, <b>touching 90mph</b> as Denly comes across to defend"
"oof, he's hurt himself here... <b>jabbed down into his boot!</b> Is this innings a literal exposition of a man shooting himself in the foot?"
tucked off the body towards midwicket
"back of a length on off, 86mph/138kph and Denly covers the line, defends"
"pitched up and that's clipped off the pads, in the air but bouncing safely out towards the deep square boundary-rider"
props forward to defend an 86mph/138kph length ball
"<b>chewed up and spat out!</b> Arrowing past the bat as Denly feels for it, neither back nor forward... there was a sound, but you could see daylight between bat and ball on the replay"
touch short and this is defended into the off side
"<b>close again!</b> How has that missed...? To his credit, Denly is just trying to play the line, not following the ball, as lavish movement again smuggles it through past the outside edge"
"gets a touch straighter, jabbed down into the off side"
"comes across and steers this low through backward point, there's a couple more - <b>Denly becomes the first England batsman to cross 10!</b> Significant milestone, 90-plus minutes into the session"
"pitched up, 88mph/141kph as Bairstow gets into line and shows it a straight bat"
"slightly shorter, seaming a touch and pushed away defensively as he gets into line"
stays back on the crease and turns it to the on side
"shortish, over the top of off, 85mph/137kph and Bairstow jabs it back down the pitch"
comes across on off stump to block
back of a length over the stumps and Bairstow taps it down into the leg side - maiden over
"hammering away outside off, this straightens at 88mph/141kph as Denly pushes forward... quite a way from hitting that one"
"length on the stumps, 86mph and tucked off his hip for one"
"fuller, prodded into the covers coming forwards"
"back of a length, just outside the line of off and not coming back enough to make YJB play"
"top of off, presses out and defends softly"
"<b>finds the edge</b>, but it shoots low wide of the slips and away for four! Played it softly, and that gets Bairstow up and running"
"gottim, <b>fat edge to the keeper!</b> Denly's luck runs out, perhaps his patience, too, as he aims an extravagant front-foot drive without having got near the pitch of the ball. Fed it up full and a touch wide, but he was nowhere near nailing the cover drive. Patto puts Denly out of his misery"
"back of a length, whistling through outside off, Buttler leaves"
"length ball, 87mph/139kph, seaming away in the channel"
"shortish and nibbling, again Buttler can hang back and shoulder arms"
pushes this one down the leg side as Buttler comes across
"short, climbing through in the channel outside off, able to leave alone once again"
"<b>Warner grabs a screamer!</b> Bairstow is rumbled and England are FORTY-FIVE for SIX!! Brilliant line from Hazlewood, maybe short enough to leave, but he was sucked into a push off the back foot; the edge <i>flew</i> between keeper and first slip, but Warner was there, almost horizontal as he leapt to his left and snaffled the chance! Warner does a jig, and England are staring down the barrel!"
lets this one zip through outside off
"pushed in straighter, thumps the front pad as Woakes pushes across the line"
"length ball on middle and off, defended from the crease"
"strays on to the pads, full and straight and clipped calmly through midwicket for four"
back of a length in the channel and Woakes lets this one go
"full length, Buttler gets forward, <b>rams a drive through the covers</b>... England's 50 is raucously applauded by the fans! You take what you can get in these situations"
"drags his length back, I think that's a groin shot for Buttler, but he hides his discomfort"
"in the channel, curving away as the batsman stays in the crease and watches it through"
"short ball, well-directed at 90mph/145kph, Buttler is swiftly down on his haunches"
"pitched up, driven towards mid-off without much timing"
"oh my, Buttler leaves, <b>over the stumps!</b> Pattinson throws up his hands... I guess you would have to say he judged it well"
stays back and lets this one go in the channel
"<b>ripsnorter!</b> Dug in short, climbing through past the bat as Woakes fends at it on the back foot"
"back of a length, prodded in front of square, slightly uppish but they'll take one"
"finds the outside edge, <b>taken on the bounce at second slip!</b> Played it with soft hands"
"touch short, 85mph/137kph outside off, lets this one go"
"good length, homing in on off stump, Buttler defends down towards his toes - and that'll be <b>lunch</b>. And breathe"
"<strong>gone first ball after lunch! </strong> Woakes strangles down the leg side! Hold on... they've sent this up to check the no-ball. This is mighty close... but Cummins gets the benefit of the doubt and Woakes trudges off. A sharp bumper, aimed in at his ribcage, tried to flick it down to fine leg and gloved through to Paine"
"sharp short ball outside the off stump, 86mph, this is Cummins' revenge for those bumpers he got from Archer at Lord's!"
"another bumper, and again Archer ducks underneath it. Steep bounce for Cummins, flies up off the surface"
"as the mildly irritating DJ Khaled put it, 'another one'. Archer ducks underneath the short ball"
"slightly fuller, still back of a length, Archer gets into something of a mess but fends it down to fine leg off the glove. Cummins gives Archer a word or two, and gets a terse smile back"
"length outside off, and Buttler bunts it down to mid-on"
"<strong>oh my word... </strong>this one is most definitely bad batting. Length ball outside off, there is a short cover in, and Buttler chips a drive straight to him! Sharp catch by Khawaja, but that is a poor, poor shot, falls right into the trap and Buttler's lean run in Tests continues. Don't adjust your monitors, <b>England really are 56 for 8!</b>"
"short ball to start, defends well off the back foot"
"another back-of-a-length ball, jumps back, and squirts off the edge towards gully"
"bouncer, but down the leg side and that won't trouble Broad this time"
"shortish again, has a little waft at it and gets nowhere near it, 86.5mph and flies through to Paine"
"slightly fuller, and Broad clips it off his pads down to fine leg for four. And a huge cheer goes up from the Leeds faithful!"
"bosh, <strong>have some of that! </strong>Short, but chest height, clears the front leg and smites it through midwicket for a boundary!"
"bumper, very short this time at 86mph and Archer ducks underneath it"
"<strong>another big heave-ho</strong> from Archer to a short ball, no sort of connection but skews away towards the vacant mid-on region for a couple. And the crowd is getting involved! 'Super, super Jof, super Jofra Archer' is the ditty"
"short ball, ducks, but <strong>Australia are celebrating!</strong> Archer reviews, but this has come off the back of the bat, by the sounds of it. Yep, not quite short enough to duck, leaves his bat in the way of it, and just brushes the bat - the face, in fact - on the way through, and the decision is upheld! Archer had walked off by the time the decision was confirmed, and England are nine down!"
"short ball from round the wicket, fended towards short leg by Leach but falls just short!"
"short again, fended towards short leg again but flies past him, and skews out towards square leg for a single"
"length ball, blocked out into the off side with a high front elbow... textbook stuff!"
"short ball, Leach shuffles across to the off side and evades the 88mph bouncer"
"<strong>dropped!</strong> Again Leach shuffles across to the off side, tries to fend it into the leg side... it balloons up off his glove as one hand comes off the bat and the diving Wade can't cling on!"
"short again, ducks underneath it this time"
"nope, can't make them pay this time... <strong>tiiiiiimber!</strong> Leach shuffles across to cover his off stump again, and a full ball crashes into his leg stump! Hazlewood has five wickets, Australia have a 112-run lead, England have their lowest score in the Ashes since 1948, and their lowest ever at Headingley!"
"outswinger, wide outside the off stump and Harris has a flash! Play-and-miss to start"
"fuller this time and <strong>crunched</strong> through point for four! Too much width, and a beautiful square drive"
"straighter this time, that's the line for Archer, and defended firmly back to the bowler"
"full and straight, 88mph, looks to work into the leg side and it squirts out off the edge towards deep point... they come back for a couple"
"full outside the off stump, 87mph, soft-handed defensive shot and spills out into the leg side"
"length ball outside off, and plays inside the line"
"very wide on the crease, angled into the left-hander, looks to clip through square leg but flicks the pad and races away for four"
"<strong>big appeal... given!</strong> Wilson looked like he shook his head, and then stuck the finger up - utterly bizarre - and Warner sends it upstairs... impact umpire's call, and smashing into leg stump on with the angle! Warner's struggles against Broad continue! Wide on the crease again from Broad - you know the drill now when he's bowling to Warner - and moved in off the seam to thwack him on the pad"
"length angled in again, left alone on length"
"straighter and a touch fuller, fended away by Uzzie out towards short leg"
"no great movement this time, outswinger pushed very wide of the off stump and shoulders arms to it"
"inswinger this time, fired down the leg side and left alone"
"very wide outswinger from Archer, and called as such"
"much straighter this time, and movement in off the seam... on fourth or fifth stump, but left alone and slightly too short"
"back of a length, defends into the covers off the back foot"
"full bunger on middle stump, touching 90mph, and blocked out to mid-on"
"length ball, 89.6mph, in the channel outside off and Harris leaves it alone with a swoosh of the bat as it flies through to Bairstow"
"<strong>beats him</strong>, length outside off, <strong>91mph</strong>, hint of seam movement again and flies through past the edge"
"short ball, but well played off the back foot and kept down"
"full ball from Broad, and a crablike defensive shot from Khawaja"
"straighter, and clipped off leg stump down to long leg for a single"
"full ball just outside off, Khawaja defends into the off side, admittedly unconvincingly"
"full, on fourth or fifth stump, and Harris unleashes a crunching drive through wide mid-off! Entices the drive, and a slight misfield on the way through from Burns as it races away"
"wide outside off, on a length, and leaves it alone"
"<strong>beaten </strong>all ends up, tries to defend outside off and flies past his outside edge"
"beaten, tentative push at a length ball on fifth stump and flies past the outside edge"
"wild ball down the leg side, fumble by Bairstow at full stretch but recovers before they can scramble a bye"
"fierce bumper, 88mph, ducks underneath it after picking it up late and this <strong>explodes </strong>off the pitch on it way through to Bairstow... very good take, that"
"strays down the leg side again, up towards 90mph, Bairstow gets a glove to it but can only tip it round the post to fine leg"
"Harris is beaten again! 91.7mph, length ball, <strong>absolute jaffa</strong>, pitches on off stump and jags away off the seam past the outside edge"
"slightly shorter this time, jumps onto the back foot and defends"
"length outside off, shoulders arms and flies through to the keeper"
"hangs this one wide outside the off stump, left alone"
"half-volley outside off, and unleashes a drive through point for a boundary! Too wide from Broad, and punished"
"straighter this time, 85.5mph, plays it late on the defensive with soft hands"
"big movement off the seam in towards the left-hander, and squirts away out to square leg off the inside edge"
"full and straight, angling in, and Harris digs it out from beneath him"

gets forward and defends on the front foot
"full and straighter, gets forward to defend"
"wide on the crease, outswinger this time and left alone as it flies through"
"full and straight, big appeal, <strong>Wilson says no!</strong> But after a mini-conference, England review. No bat, smashes into the knee roll, but might be sliding down... yep, it's missing entirely. England lose a review, and Harris survives. As Rahul suggests, he was coming across his stumps and looked to clip the inswinger through the leg side, but missed it completely"
wide of the off stump and left alone
"outswinger on a length, blocked into the off side"
"short ball, <b>Khawaja takes it on and the ball sails in the air</b>... one bounce fine of the man on the rope for four!"
"back of a length outside off, lets the ball go"
"still a touch short, veering towards the slips as Khawaja shoulders arms"
"length delivery pushed across the bows, 84mph/136kph and Khawaja lets it go"
"on the stumps, defended"
"better length, flirting with Khawaja just outside off and shaping through to the keeper as he pushes forward"

"length ball, chopped into the off side"
"angled across the left-hander, wide enough to leave alone"
"good nut, wobble seam and kicking off the pitch, jags past the bat as Harris pokes uncertainly from the crease"
"plays back again, opened up but he dabs it low through backward point for one"
"<b>did that carry?</b> No, bounces a yard short of Buttler at midwicket... Uppish flick off the pads from Khawaja, nearly picked out the fielder"
"<b>bowled him through the gate!</b> Leach rips one through Harris with his first ball of the match! Still wearing shades, and he celebrates Like A Boss... Will that pep England up again? Harris had been watchful and compact but that wasn't a good shot, having never faced a ball from Leach before. Nicely flighted, grips and spins from wide of off stump as Harris drives, rattles into the pegs"
"floated up on middle stump, drifting in but met with a crisp punch through the covers, that'll run away from Denly as he puts in a despairing dive on the rope!"

"slanted away from the lefty, who watches it through"
"yoinks, <b>nearly skewered him!</b> Fiendish nip-backer and it slices through Khawaja, but misses everything. Woakes can only grin ruefully"

"tossed up, Khawaja brings out the reverse-sweep but sends it to backward point"
"pushed through a touch quicker, into the gloves with the batsman playing back"
tossed up and tapped into the covers coming forwards
"flighted, Khawaja drives this time, opening the face a touch to pick up one behind square"
"tempts him with a full one, thick outside edge, <b>Roy snags the catch!</b> Headingley gurgles its approval as Woakes gets in on the act... Another poor shot, though it nipped late, bottom hand coming off the bat as he lost control"

edging up through to the gears to 86mph as Marnus again gets into line

"good length around off stump, defended back down the track"
gets a touch straight and Labuschagne works it away off the legs

"shortish ball delivered from round the wicket, takes this on the thigh pad"
"<b>absolutely pinged!</b> Slightly overpitched by Woakes and Head is moving nicely, transfers the weight and eases the ball back down the ground to long-on!"
"short of a length, Laboosh fends it away through square leg"
"very full, 87mph/139kph and wide of the stumps, Head jabs down on it and the ball bobbles along the ground to slip"
"coming back in, still wide with his line, no stroke"
"length ball in the corridor, 85mph and left alone"
comes across and prods back down the pitch
"speared down the leg side, Archer throws his arms up to his head... Not quite hit his straps in this spell"
"slightly short in the channel outside off, Labuschagne hangs back and lets it fly through"
"beauty from Broad, <b>drags him out and nips away!</b> Labuschagne was committed, Bairstow's appeal was full-throated... but Broad knew he'd <i>just</i> missed it"
"ooh, that's gone... slung down very wide and swerving away late, giving YJB a job to go going across in front of the slips"
"tighter line, blocked into the covers"
"seaming away in the channel, plants the front foot and lets this go"

"seaming away wide of the off stump, no stroke"

"short ball outside off, left alone"

jabbed into the leg side
"scudding into the pads again, Wilson shakes his head... This might have been closer, Woakes certainly liked it, but there's no review. And Hawk-Eye subsequently shows it to be <b>missing leg stump</b>"
"shortish, angled across as Wade hangs back and lets it go"
"back of a length, 84mph/136kph outside off and Labuschagne half plays at it before withdrawing his bat... England thought there was a sound, however, and <b>review</b> after discussion between Root and Bairstow, though it seems speculative. But Stokes has overstepped! So it's a no-ball, anyway"

"slams down a bouncer, 86mph as Wade crouches low in the crease"
"feisty, <b>jagging back to hit Wade on the thigh!</b> Stokes hurls himself into his work, knackered though he may be, and gets this to spit off the deck. Too high for lbw, though"
"short of a length, Labuschagne pulls at it, there's a noise on the way through to Bairstow... England appeal, but even they are not totally convinced. Joel Wilson shakes his head and there's no review. Think that flicked the trouser pocket"

"smacks into the back leg, England appeal... Wilson turns it down, looked a tad high"
"fuller, homing in on the front pad - <b>given!</b> Broad is off celebrappealing as Wilson's finger goes up, but Paine <b>reviews</b>; looks like there's bat on this, which will save him from lbw. But the ball then looped up towards gully, where Joe Denly took the catch, so it's going to be out regardless! Paine doesn't look happy, walks off shaking his head. <del>We haven't seen Hawk-Eye but it looked a long shot to be overturned</del> EDIT: Ball-tracking had it going over, which will doubtless improve Paine's mood"

"<strong>that's a better shot! </strong>Stokes shimmies down the pitch, in complete control of a full ball on leg stump, and drives beautifully down the track out to the fence at long-on"
"arm ball on off stump, Stokes defends"
"good length around off stump, punched into the covers half forward"
"oof, not good, Jofra... 89mph/143kph in the channel and leaving him as Archer wafts his bat leadenly and is beaten"
"banged in short, 88mph and rising like steam, ducked"
"dug in short, heading leg side as Archer swings across the line, fails to connect"
"fuller on off, jabbed watchfully down in front of square"
"back of a length and stabbed down into the covers, early call of 'No!' this time"
"floated up from round the wicket, Stokes reaches for it and steers behind point for a single"
"full outside of, Archer heaves across the line, <b>gets it away through midwicket!</b> Struck hard and flat and it beats the man in the deep"
"slogged to cow, <b>the fielder dives past this one!</b> Not catchable, I don't think, but very hard to prevent from bouncing away once he had gone for it! The crowd erupts again"
tossed up and Archer prods forward cautiously this time
"pushed through and blocked, hits the splice as he gets out"
"got him! <b>Archer finds deep square leg on the slog-sweep!</b> It required a cool head on the rope, Head taking the catch as he walked back, tossed it gently up as his foot went over the boundary... and then safely taken as he stepped back in! You could sense it coming, Archer's spunky salvo is over, Australia two away from retaining the urn"
short and wide as Broad hangs back and lets it go
"pitched up, Broad is hit on the boot - given! But he <b>reviews</b>, did he get some bat on it? Doesn't look like it on the first replay, but we'll need UltraEdge - no, that's clear, and<b> Hawk-Eye has it smashing the base of off stump!</b> Pattinson's yorker rips through Broad and Australia are on the brink"
"short of a length and fading away, left alone"
"dug in and Leach hangs back, keeps his bat inside the line"
"fired in full on leg stump, Leach pokes it into the ground past short leg, Stokes sent back"

"lobbed up wide of the off stump, Stokes throws the bat and misses with a cut"

tossed up and prodded into the covers
"shout of 'catch!' from Lyon... <b>but Stokes has mowed it over long-off!</b> There's a man out there, but this was struck fine of him, lands it pretty much on the rope"
pushed through flatter and chopped through the off side - declines the one
"quicker on the stumps and Stokes is back, dabs this away through backward square leg for the single he wants"
"<b>91mph/146kph from Pattinson</b>, pitched up and nailed through midwicket, straight to the fielder - no run taken"
"short and wide and Stokes swings hard... Warner celebrates, but there's nothing on it, Paine's grin gives it away"
"length ball, Stokes is down on one knee as he flays through the covers... again it's too close to a boundary rider for two"
"sprayed across the left-hander, slower ball, I think - the crowd demands a wide, given by Gaffaney"
"back of a length in the channel and Stokes taps it down into the covers, immediately calls 'two!' Leach scuttles for his life to get back at the non-striker's"
"pitched up and Stokes swings for the hills, gets a thick outside edge towards third man, takes the single"
"smashed in short, 88mph/141kph but well over the ducking Leach"
"goes down the ground again,<b> clears long-off!</b> Hazlewood leaps on the rope, but he can't get near it... Six more!"
"tossed up wide of the stumps and Stokes is across and down on one knee to heave it through cow, picks out the man"

"pushes through mid-off, tip-and-run and they make it home!"
"back of a length, Stokes whips a pull... and bottom-edges it into his front leg. Winces in pain, but the adrenaline will keep him going"
"full outside off and driven firmly through mid-off, Stokes wants a second to Khawaja coming in off the rope... but he won't get it"
"round the wicket, back of a length and <b>hits the glove!</b> Falls short of slip!"
shuffles across and blocks towards backward point
"pitched up, <b>91mph/146kph</b> as Pattinson bends his back, blocked on off stump"
"banged into the pitch, rising outside off but he's across and on top of it, prodded away safely"
"pitched up from round the wicket, Stokes works it adroitly into a gap at midwicket and comes hurtling back"
"short over the stumps, Stokes goes for the ramp... fails to connect! Ambitious shot, against a bowler as good as Cummins"
"he gets the ramp away this time, <b>into the stands at fine leg!</b> Still ambitious, but he's got the chops to pull it off! Stokes into the 90s and the crowd are going like Billy-oh again!"
"worked into the leg side, he wants two... and Stokes loses his footing at the non-striker's, but Leach is bombing back up the pitch and the throw goes to the wrong end!"
"shortish outside off stump, Stokes taps it through backward point for one more"
"round the wicket, banged in but not getting up, jabbed away into the leg side"
"short outside off, <b>smoked through wide long-on!</b> Rocks back and <i>hammers</i> this to the boundary - <b>hundred for Stokes</b>, but he's not interested. Work still to do, he nods his head and then returns to his crease"
"full toss, <b>scooped over the ropes at deep square!</b> You've got to be kidding me! Sails away and England are getting ever closer"
"goes again, <b>soaring into the Western Terrace!</b> Length delivery, he rocks back and smashes it to smithereens between two men parked on the boundary"

"pitched up, 87mph/139kph in the channel, Stokes casually taps it through point, takes the one"
"fired in full down the leg side, goes for the leg-stump yorker that did for Leach in the first innings... but it's off target!"
"darted flat outside off and Stokes goes for the reverse-sweep... <b>Paine appeals for caught behind</b>, but the umpire isn't interested. Kidology"
"goes for a big mow over the leg side, this spins out of the rough to slip"
"slower, Stokes aims a little reverse-prod at it and misses"
"pushed through, Stokes turns down the single punching through the covers"
"flat offbreak outside off, Stokes goes back and chops a single out to deep point, takes the one"
"floated up from round the wicket, Leach blocks stoutly on the front foot"
"<b>dropped!</b> Sliced to third man, Marcus Harris can't hold it... The ball carried, he got his hands there, couldn't cling on! Very similar to Simon Jones in 2005..."
"short ball, cracked on the pull, through Warner's dive on the rope! <b>Was it a catchable chance?</b> Hard to tell, but it was travelling!"
"smashed down the ground, <b>Stokes is on the rampage</b>, the target now in single figures! Hazlewood threw himself full length but couldn't cut it off"
"slower ball, Stokes cushions it through mid-off, and they'll take the one"
"banged in short, 88mph bumper and it clears the ducking Leach"
"pitched up, skids into the pads, appeal for lbw but looked leg side. Australia <b>review</b>, but it's a desperate one, pitching well outside leg"

"pushed through quicker and he cuts, into a gap behind point but again turns down the single"
"tossed up, and he goes down town... Hanging in the air... There's a man on the rope... <b>Gets it over his head for six!</b> Stokes wasn't sure, it wasn't out of the middle, he crouched, he watched - and then the crowd erupted!"
pushed through and cut firmly but can't get it through
"<b>missed run out!</b> Leach is charging down, he's miles out of his ground as the throw comes in...<b> but Lyon drops it!</b> Can you believe it? Stokes reverse-swept, picked out backward point, but Leach was headlong down the pitch looking for a non-existent single"
"goes for the slog-sweep, hit on the pads, Wilson shakes his head! Lyon can't believe it, <b>Australia have no reviews!</b> That looked a pretty good shout, pitching on middle and leg. Did it straighten enough?"
"slams down a bouncer, high over the batsman's head"
"short and at the body, 85mph/137kph and Leach shovels it away, leg gully cleans up"
"round the wicket, banged into the ribs and Leach jabs it past short leg, they scamper through and <b>SCORES ARE LEVEL!</b> Leach's first run, too"
"there it is! Flayed through the covers, <b>Stokes has completed the Miracle of Headingley Part II!</b> Holy hand grenades, Stokes is a monster! He throws his arms wide and roars! <b>England win by one wicket</b> and the series is level in the most heart-stopping fashion imaginable!"
