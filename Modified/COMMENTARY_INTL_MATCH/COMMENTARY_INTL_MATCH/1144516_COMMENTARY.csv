"fuller length, swinging into the batsman on off stump, solid forward defensive by Rahul"
"back of a length on off, Rahul goes on the back foot to punch pleasingly through cover. Fabian Allen hares after it and pulls it in with a slide"
"fuller, angling across Rohit, who is happy to let it go"
"oooh, that nipped back in and was close to off stump. Just short of a length in that teasing line outside off, Rohit lets it go again"
"back of a length on the hips and paddled off his hips past backward square leg. Didn't try to hit it hard, just stroked it"
"back of a length again, bounced a bit higher than Rahul expected perhaps, and he jabs it down from just above his waist"
"length ball, angling into him, tapped towards mid-on"
"back of a length around off, pushed towards cover"
"back of a length outside off again, Rahul stands tall and punches, but doesn't get the timing or placement right and it's picked up by the in-field"
"on good length, again with his natural incoming delivery, Rahul gets on the front foot to defend solidly"
"back of a length outside off, shoulders arms"
"goes fuller, on the stumps, Rahul goes across and on drives, but straight to mid-on"
"fuller length around off, he's getting it to move in the air. Rohit defends"
"oooh that's gone through at good pace and height. Dug it in, in the channel, Rohit went on the back foot to try and slash it away, but the ball went over his shoulder"
"hard length, jagging back into him from middle and off, tries to work it away but is struck high on the thigh pad"
"fuller this time on the stumps, driven with the full face of the bat, but gently, and to mid-on"
that's too far down leg and he'll have to re-bowl it
"thick outside edge goes to third man. Fuller outside off, inviting the drive and Rohit obliges, but gets a thick eget that goes well wide of Gayle at slip"
"on target bouncer, forcing Rahul to arch his back to sway out of the way"
"fuller outside off, meets it with a confident stride to defend to cover"
"fuller length again, on off, goes across to drive to mid-on's right"

"fuller on the stumps, pushed to mid-on"
"back of a length outside off, technically a cut shot between point and cover, but cut sounds too violent for the manner in which Rohit stroked it."
"back of a length, wide of off, and he shoulders arms"
"digs it in short but it sits up, and Rahul is able to comfortably swat his pull shot down to square leg. Got on top of the bounce and kept it down"
corrects his length to go fuller and immediately gets it to nibble in the air. Rohit drives from outside off but gets a thick inside edge to short fine leg
"<b>sumptuous</b> Short and wide, allows Rohit the room and time to rock back and cut this tot he point fence"
"better length, much fuller and Rohit shows the full face of the bat to pat it back to the bowler"
"goes short again, I don't think this is the pitch to be banging it in - it's just sitting up. Rohit moves across and whips to deep midwicket"
"short ball once again and Rohit unfurls one of his gorgeous pull shots. Gets into position quickly and hits it nicely, but luckily for Cottrell he has protection at deep square"
"very full on off, driven with the full face of the bat to mid-off"
"<b>wham</b>. Do. Not. Bowl. Short. To. Rohit. or you can and get smashed like Roach has, all the way over deep square leg. Stunning shot. He got into position so early, seemed to have time to wander to square leg and back, before rocking back and smacking it hard"
"fuller on the stumps, pushed gently towards mid-on for a quick single"
"<b>lovely timing</b>. Roach overcompensates by bowling too full and Rahul drives it back past the bowler. Too straight for mid-on and he can't get there in time, can only chase it to the boundary"
"back of a length, tucked to square leg"
"good length and has it paid dividends? There was a noise as it went past the bat and West Indies have reviewed it. Pitched on a hard length and jagged back in sharply. Rohit left a gap between bat and pad, and the ball snaked through that. Did it hit bat or pad though? The third umpire says bat, and Roach has struck a huge blow. Rohit Sharma is shaking his head as he walks off, it appears he doesn't think he got an inside edge."
"lovely delivery first up. Oshane has been banging it in this World Cup, but he pitches this full, comes in with the angle and moves away, beats Rahul all ends up"
"fuller on the pads, tucked towards mid-on. He's looking for a single but Kohli is having none of it - rightly so"

"fuller length on off, moving gently away, Kohli uses his wrists to push this towards cover"
"back of a length outside off, steered to point off the back foot"

"fuller, on the pads, gets behind it and pushes towards mid-on"

"strays in line, on the pads, flicked to deep square leg where the man has to run to his left, so they're able to pick up two"
"again on the pads, flicked to backward square leg."
"<b>sliding stop by Cottrell on the third man boundary</b>. He continues to stamp his presence in the field. This was a good ball, Oshane finally got his line right again, in the channel outside off and got it to jump from back of a length. Rahul wanted to take his bat out of the way but the ball thudded into it even as he was lifting the bat up and travelled to third man"
"pacy bouncer to finish, which the batsman safely ducks under"
"<b>lovely</b>. fine touch from Kohli. Bad ball, half-volley on the pads and Kohli turns his wrists to whip it gently. Short midwicket could have stopped it but would need amazing reflexes because it was timed so well"

"back of a length outside off, steered to third man"
"peachy cover drive, Rahul has been driving those full ones outside off, but he threads the gap with this one, leaves the in-field standing"
"<b>mix up but safe</b> Back of a length outside off, Rahul squirts it to point. Kohli though there is a run there and was nearly three quarters of the way down before Rahul sent him back. Scrambles back and is safe because the fielder didn't pick up the ball cleanly"
"length ball on the stumps, jabbed back"
"length ball on the pads, swatted to long-on with a horizontal bat"
"not much turn for Allen so far. Length ball outside off, punched into the off side"
moves across to whip this to long-on
"given some air and fuller, flicked back to the bowler's right"
slashed past slip. given some air again and he gets it to bounce from outside off and spin gently away. Kohli goes back and slashes hard. Didn't worry about it going in the air because it was well wide of the lone slip
"fuller on the stumps, flicked to mid-on"
"too full and angling in on the pads, tries to on-drive and times it well but straight to mid-on"
"fuller on off, driven forcefully but not timed and once again straight to the extra cover fielder"
"loud shout for lbw and there is a big discussion but after Holder talks to keeper Hope decides against it. This was on a hard length and Rahul was looking to defend off the front foot, nipped in and flicked his pad on the way to the keeper. Might have been going over the stumps"

"length ball on off, bunted to mid-off"
"good length angling in but well outside off, so Kohli covers the line and lets it through"

"<strong>BOWLED!</strong> No fifty for KL Rahul, as the ball jags in with the natural angle, and from a length, and just kisses the top of off-stump. The perfect ball in many ways, as Rahul is caught on the half-cock, unsure of how far forward to stretch"

"<b>this is a shambles by Shai Hope - missed two chances to stump Dhoni</b>. Dhoni had skipped down the track a long, long way, but was beaten by the dip and turn. Hope didn't gather cleanly and missed breaking the stumps. Dhoni seemed to have given up, then saw Hope didn't have the ball and scrambled back. Hope tried to flick the ball back towards the stumps from half a foot away and missed again! Dhoni makes it back, and they even steal a bye. To complete a trifecta of misery, Hope even misses scoring a direct hit at the non-striker's end"

"superb running by Kohli. Goes across and works this off his pads to fine leg. Knows exactly at what pace he has hit it and where the fielder is - he had to run around to his left - and gets two. Oshane the man there, and he's not the quickest mover"
"fuller, tapped back to the bowler"
"length ball outside off, comes forward to meet it and steers to point. Wants a single but Dhoni sends him back, correctly"

"back of a length, closer to off stump and coming in, defends it down near his feet"
"too full and Kohli gets his elbow high to unleash a textbook cover drive. Races through extra cover, but there is a sweeper back so he will cut it off before it gets to the boundary"
"flatter outside off on a length, cuts it to third man. Nobody back there so they can take two with the fielder in the circle having to run back"

"<b>lovely</b>, that is just masterfully done by Kohli. Not that full, but he comes forward, and clips this from outside off to the deep midwicket boundary. Left the fielders standing"
"<b>Kohli's filthy with himself</b>. He's just pulled a half-tracker to midwicket. It was short, seemed to stop a bit on the pitch. Didn't bounce as much too. Kohli got into position to pull but played it too early, had to also adjust for lack of bounce and the ball goes very tamely off the toe end. Comfortable catching height and he gobbles it up. Kohli can't believe it, but he has to walk back"
"fuller on the stumps, driven with an angled bat to midwicket"
"fuller, driven to mid-on"
"fuller, driven to mid-off"
"<b>cracked</b> to the square leg fence. Short ball rising to his chest and he unleashes a fierce pull. Oshane was there and put in the dive, but too clumsily to stop the ball going to the boundary"

"a more controlled pull by Pandya now. Another short ball but he waits in position early and keeps it down, sending it to fine leg"

"back of a length angling into him, goes back to wrist it to midwicket"
"<b>bisected to perfection</b>. Dug this into the pitch again, and Pandya got his bat up high to pull this all along the ground to deep square leg. The fielder at deep square and deep midwicket converged on the ball - but it beat them to the boundary"
goes for the quicker one but strays down leg

"yorker on off stump, dug out to mid-off"
"back of a length on the pads, tucked to deep square leg. Oshane has to run to his left to collect, so they take two"

"dug in short on the stumps, he moves across to pull this down to square leg"

"in the air, but short of the man on the cover fence. Too full outside off, slashed in the air"

"yorker on fifth stump, driven to extra cover on the fence"

"too full on the pads, whipped to deep midwicket"
"<b>swatted</b>. Bad ball with his field. He had no long-off, bowled it too full and outside off, gave Dhoni room to free his arms and swat it over mid-off"
"closer to the stumps now, and Dhoni drives to the man at the cover boundary"
"digs it in short outside off, Hardik swivels to pull this to deep midwicket"
"slower ball, dug it in short, he waits for it and taps it gently to midwicket, where the fielder is deep on the boundary. Which allows them to take two"
"yorker on the stumps, turned to deep midwicket"
nice timing and sound on that pull shot but it's straight to the fielder at deep square
"digs it into the pitch, slower ball, on the fourth stump line. No pace for Pandya to work with and he can only bunt it to mid-off"
"too full, allowing Pandya to get under it and loft his drive over mid-off. No one back there, so that's a boundary"
"length ball outside off, but well wide of off stumps, so Pandya can transfer weight back and cut it hard towards deep point"
"fuller on off stump, he moves across and drives to mid-on"
"full toss outside off, steered to deep point"
"short ball but down leg, lucky to get away with it. Dhoni goes to pull but gets an under-edge that rolls past the keeper"
"<b>top edge lands over short fine leg</b>. Full toss on the pads, and he tried to just flick-hit it but got a top edge. Brathwaite was running back from short fine but was never going to get there"
"back of a length outside off, cuts to deep point"
"<b>dropped</b> - a tough return chance. Dhoni was pushed on the back foot and pushed at it, the ball stopped a wee bit. It popped up in the air and Oshane got his right hand to it in his follow through but couldn't hold on"
"fuller outside off, carved over cover. Got a lot more height on it than he intended but lands safe again"
"first ball that's well timed in the over and he finds the fence with it. Wide outside off on a length, he throws his bat at it, slashing it through point and the ball races to the boundary before third man can run around"
"slower ball, back of a length on the pads, turned to deep midwicket"
"<b>carved out straight to deep cover</b>. Hardik has been mistiming the ball in the air, but his luck runs out, and Cottrell can finally bring out his salute. Slower ball on the fifth stump, Pandya tries to power it over extra cover, but slices it"

"back of a length on the stumps, controls his pull to deep midwicket"
"back of a length and rising up, Shami is very late on it, ends up trying to fend it away but it pings his gloves"

"yorker first up, but Kuldeep does well to get bat on it and almost Natmegs it to fine leg"
"<b>clobbered</b>. Too short and it just sat up to be hit, Dhoni obliged by unleashing a pull that sends the ball back several rows beyond deep midwicket"
"superb reply, follows it up with a yorker on the stumps, that is dug out to the bowler's right. Dhoni not interested in the single"
"back of a length on the pads, Dhoni doesn't get hold of the pull that time and sends it rolling to deep square leg. <b>refuses the single again</b>."
"another short ball, he didn't get hold of the pull, but got enough meat on it to send it very straight. Long-off was running to his left but couldn't time is dive well enough and Dhoni gets to <b>fifty</b>"
"wide yorker, carved out to deep cover. He won't take the single of course, he's backing himself to hit a boundary off the last ball. He's also chipped his bat, so he'll get that changed for the last ball"
"<b>finishes with a six</b> and that's poor bowling by Oshane. Bowls another short ball, Dhoni is waiting for it, swivels back and pull this well over deep square leg"
"length, outside off, and he leaves as it lifts on its way through to Dhoni"
"length, angles across him, and he pulls out at the last moment after perhaps thinking about having a little jab at it. There's a third man down by the fence"
"length, swings away, and Gayle leaves"
"<strong>oh lucky!</strong> Length ball, straightens into him, and he jams his bat down a bit late and outside the line of it. Gets an inside edge, that misses the stumps by very little, and then beats Dhoni down to fine leg"
"slaps away a length ball, but cannot beat KL Rahul at cover"
"length, lifts away after slanting across him, and he leaves"
"outside off, and he cuts this close to his body, and just past second slip, down towards third man"
"length, slants away from Gayle, who leaves"
"length, and lifts as it angles away from him, and he lets it pass"
"length, moves away from him off a good length, and he leaves again"
"full ball, and strikes him on the pad. <strong>Would have pitched outside leg, though</strong>! Kohli seemed curious about a review, but Dhoni convinces him not to go for it. It was full, and fast, and Gayle had no time to jam his bat down, but was backing away as the ball speared in"
"length, and he leaves as it moves away from outside off"
"<strong>cuts him in half!</strong> Length ball, and just moves in a touch, and Ambris plays outside the line of this. Somehow conspires to miss bat, stumps and through to Dhoni in a jiffy!"
"length, jags back in and strikes him on the inside of the thigh as he jumps to play this away. Dobbles away to point"
"short, and he defends this towards square leg from the crease"
"short, and he guides this towards third man off the back foot"
"full, angles across him, and he plays it with a dead bat towards point"
"on his pads, and he flicks this down towards long leg"
"length, angles away from Gayle, who brings his broad bat down to defend this with a straight face"
"length, <strong>a bit of lift from outside off</strong>, and he plays it away towards point"
"shorter in length, angles across him, and he plays it with soft hands to right of cover, and they go through for a quick single. Good call from Ambris and Gayle responded quickly"
"<strong>beats him outside off!</strong> Pitches this a bit fuller, in the channel outside off, and Ambris is sucked in into going for the drive without any feet movement. Misses"
"angles into him from a length, and he can place this to the right of mid on for a single"
"length, outside off, and he defends with a dead bat"
"length, and he plays it with the inside part of the bat, looking to play it straight, but scuffs it away towards square leg"
"length, comes into him, and he defends"
"short, and he plays this down towards fine leg. Some ground for the man there to cover, but Chris Gayle is happy with just the one"
"length, and he is caught by surprise by the <strong>pace and bounce on this</strong>! Pitched on a length outside off, and then just took off, on its way through to MSD"
"<strong>FIRST BLOOD!</strong> It's another short ball, which sticks in the pitch a bit. Gayle looks to pull, but can only meekly put this up in the air to the left of mid on. Kedar Jadhav runs to his left, and has ample time to grap this, reverse-cup. Kohli is thrilled, and he lets his teammates know that"
"<strong>another snorter!</strong> Pitching outside off, a bit short in length, but just takes off as it goes through to MS Dhoni. There's some venom in this opening spell from Shami, and he's given India the big wicket of Gayle!"
"looking for the yorker, but gets too full. He drops it away towards short midwicket"
"fuller, and he whips it off from outside off towards long leg. Well attacked by the fieldsman down there, to keep them down to just one"
"beaten outside off. Length ball, moves a touch further away as Hope stretches to drive"
"<strong>takes the outside edge, but doesn't carry to Kohli at second slip!</strong> Top ball again, just on a length, and outside off, and Hope goes into the tentative poke early on. Played with soft hands, to be fair, though"
"length ball, shapes into him, and has him hopping with some bounce. Defended to short midwicket"
"full ball, outside off, and this time he does well to bring his bat down and run this down to third man. Bumrah has his hands on head, and a cheeky smile to acknowledge how close that <em>could</em> have easily been"
"short, angles into him, and he plays it away towards short midwicket"
"length, and he goes on his toes to punch this towards point. A convincing shot, but not for runs yet..."
"length, good speed outside off, <strong>136kph</strong>, and he defends towards point"
"fuller, and he cuts this past point. <strong>Terrific bit of timing from Hope</strong>. Allows this to come on to him and then just uses the pace of the ball and an open face to get it through the infield"
"<strong>GONE!</strong> This is full again, and straight, and Hope has played all over this one. Looks to go down the ground with a straight drive, but just a touch of movement back in, beats the inside edge, and just clips the top of off. Ideal ball again from Mohammad Shami, as India continue to make early inroads..."
jags one back in from a length and forces Pooran to get behind the line and defend
"length, angles into him and he plays it down towards fine leg"
"full, straight, and he drives this back to Bumrah"
"full ball, outside off, and Dhoni cannot gather as it dies on him after slipping under the inside edge"
"length, <strong>takes the outside edge</strong>, but doesn't carry to Dhoni!"
"length, and he jams his bat down in time to drive it back down the wicket to Bumrah"
"fuller, straighter, and he gets behind the line of this to defend this down to mid on"
"fuller, outside off, and he defends this from the crease"
"length, jags back into him, as he defends this. Gets it past Shami and to the left of mid on, allowing them to get a single"
"length, slants into him from around the wicket, and he defends this from the crease"
"short, and he goes towards long leg. Not quite off the middle as it goes down towards Kuldeep Yadav"
"short, and he swivel-pulls this down to the left of Bumrah at long leg. Could have gone for two, but Bumrah rifles in a quick throw to dispel any such notions"
"fuller ball, and he brings his bat straight down to ease this to the left of mid on. Quick single is on, and they complete it easily"
"length, outside off, and Pooran looks to bash this away. Bat turns a bit in his hand, and he ends up hitting it hard back on the pitch towards the bowler"
"length, angles into him, and he defends this to the right of Kohli at cover"
"length, angles into him, and he flicks it off his hips down towards long leg"
"length, and he flicks this off his waist towards long leg"
"slower ball, cutter, and he reads it well as it angles into him, flicking this away towards square leg"
"slower ball, on the pads, and he glances this down towards fine leg"
"length, turns into him, and he drives it back to the bowler"
"length, turns away, and he goes back and hits it down the wicket towards long on"
"tossed up, and Pooran pulls out the sweep. Placed well to the left of deep midwicket, and that should fetch him two easily"
goes back and cuts a length ball towards deep backward point. Vijay Shankar is quick to get to the ball and limit them to one
"flighted outside off, and he drives this to mid off"
"tossed up, and he allows it to turn into him, and turns this away towards Bumrah at long leg"
"short, and he pulls this straight in the air, but short of <strong>fine leg</strong>! Got this off the top edge as he looked to tackle a ball directed into his body, and the top edge lands safely, well short of fine leg running in. There's a leg gully in place too, but that was beyond his reach"
"length, angles into him, and he plays it with the incoming angle down towards long leg"
"short, and he looks to pull, <strong>gets a top edge</strong>, and this time it lands to the right of fine leg"
"length, and he cuts this away from outside off, but can only get it to point"
"length, outside off, and he a swish, but misses. Pandya has overstepped, so <strong>this will be a free hit</strong>. Is this the release this pair needs?"
"pinpoint yorker, from around the wicket, and he can only squirt this away towards sweeper cover"
"straight, length ball, and he brings his bat down to play it towards midwicket. <strong>Bowled at just 127kph</strong>, this is turning to be a good spell from Pandya"
"tossed up, and he comes forward to drive him past covers to long off"
"fuller ball, turns in towards Ambris, who plays it off his pads towards deep backward square leg"
"length, and he comes forward to drive, but cannot beat Kohli at cover"
"flighted, and he presses forward to drive, and <strong>almost yorks himself</strong>! Played it onto his boot, and recovered ground before Dhoni could get to the ball, looking to whip the bails off, no doubt"
"tossed up, and he goes back to defend"
"length, and he goes back and eases him down to long on"
"full ball, angles into him, and runs off his pads as he shapes to flick this, down towards fine leg"
"length, and he presses forward to defend this"
"full ball, and he plays across the line. Furtive, but short appeal from the bowler, as he <strong>played this off the inside edge</strong>!"
"slower ball, outside off, and he defends this towards point"
"short ball, and he gets a hold of this one. Played in front of deep backward square leg, and Chahal does well to get around that and field"
"short, outside off, and he bails out of an intended stroke after seeing the ball climb"
"full, and he sweeps this, but cannot beat short fine leg"
"flighted, and he opens his stance up after pressing forward. Able to place it to the right of Kohli at cover, and they go through for a quick single"
"full, turns into him, and he flicks this away towards deep backward square leg"
"floated at middle stump, and he flicks this away after getting to the pitch of the ball, towards deep midwicket"
"flighted, outside off, and Ambris cuts this away towards deep point"
goes deep inside his crease and drives it towards deep point
"length ball outside off, punched to mid-off, they take the quick run. There is a direct hit, but he was well in"
"too full, and this is nicely done. Leans forward and opens the face of the bat to send this to the point boundary"
steered to third man
"full outside off, driven very firmly but straight to cover"
"yorker on the fourth stump, tried to get his bat down horizontal to deflect it but only manages to chop it on to the ground and it bounces over the stumps"
clipped nicely off the pads but straight to midwicket
"tossed up, drifting across, driven from outside off through cover"
"lofted, but <b>falls short of Jadhav at long-on</b>. tossed up, he took his front leg out of the way and swung it, but sent it very flat, so it bounced well ahead of Jadhav"
goes back and taps this around the corner
"<b>beauty</b> quicker, without losing his loop, pitches on that perfect length to draw him forward then viciously spins past his bat"
steered to point
"given air again, he takes a big stride out to clip this to long-on"
"too short and he's quickly onto it. Stands in place, swivels and pulls this, one bounce into the square leg boundary"
"corrects his length to a fuller one, and is driven to extra cover off the front foot"
"back of a length outside off, cuts to third man"
<b>just clears Rohit at midwicket</b> Bangs this in short and he's looking to pull this off the front foot. Gets a top edge that loops up just out of Rohit's reach
"<b>bang</b>. Strong bottom hand comes into play, whacking this full ball from outside off to the deep midwicket boundary. Powerful hit"
"<b>given him!</b> Hardik gets a wicket after a few close calls. Bowled the offcutter, and Ambris didn't read it, played all around it and was struck on his pads, right in front. Opts not to review - and I think that's a good decision. Perhaps not as good a decision by Pandya to mockingly clap and tell the batsman he has to leave."
"<b>missed stumping by Dhoni</b>. Tossed up very full, ends up as a full toss. The batsman is coming down the track, but the drift means it goes down leg and he misses it. Pitches and spins through Dhoni's legs - he might have been unsighted by it"
"given some air, defended off the front foot outside off"
"fuller, defended from the crease"
"drags it down short and is pummelled off the back foot, but there is a wide long-on in place so only a single"
"very full, driven off the front foot to the bowler's right"
dips nicely but Hetmyer has gotten a big stride in and can drive to extra cover
"big appeal given and <b>Hetmyer reviews immediately</b>. Nicely tossed up, dips on him again, and it's the googly. But here's why Hetmyer reviewed - he has inside edged it onto pad while coming forward to defend."
"tossed up, low full toss on the stumps from around, driven to cover"
"<b>terrific placement</b>. Given the room to cut, and he goes back and across to do so with power, beating backward point"
"immediately Jadhav goes flatter and quicker, defended from the crease"
"another low full toss, but drifting in, so he doesn't connect properly with an attempted stroke through cover, under-edges  behind him"
angled down leg but escapes being wided because the batsman was looking to reverse sweep
"fuller outside off, defended"
"tossed up on the stumps, makes the batsman go back and jab the ball away"
"<b>caught at long-off!</b> That's a poor shot, he was never in control of it, more like he thought he'd swing for the fences and hope to connect just to relieve the pressure. Tossed up outside off, hits through the line without moving his feet, slices it high in the air and it pops down long-off's throat"
"fuller on the stumps, driven firmly to long-off"
"fuller again, goes inside out to long-off"
"flatter on the pads, goes back and whips to deep square"
"given room outside off and the length is a bit short too, which allows him to stay legside of the ball and cut it through point"
starts with a flighted full toss that is punched to long-off
"very full again, takes a stride to get to the pitch of the ball and drive through cover"
goes past Dhoni again! Ripping leg-break that dips and sneaks in through the gate - he had left a large gap going for an expansive drive - it lands in the rough and spins big. Dhoni is left standing
"fuller, nudged round the corner"
"drags it a bit shorter, punched to cover"
driven to deep cover
"fuller on the stumps, defended off the front foot"
"gets the line wrong, pitches on leg and spins further away, so it'll be a wide."
"<b>how did that miss!</b> Holder had zero clue about that. Perfect loop, dips and draws him forward and hisses through bat and pad. Somehow doesn't go and hit the stumps. Okay I see why, it might have deflected off the back pad"
"fuller on off, driven with an angled bat between cover and point"
"fuller, clipped to midwicket"
"length ball on middle and leg, looks to flick but misses and is hit on the pads. Muted appeal"
wide of off stump that time so he waits on the back foot and slaps it to the man on the sweeper cover fence
hurries on to him and he under-edges it towards cover
gets to the pitch of the ball and swings it over mid-on. There is a man on the fence though
"beaten again. Quickish leg-break short of a length, he comes on the front foot and jabs his bat forward but it spins past his edge"
"and makes connection with air again. Stays back this time to try and cut it, but this is not so short, and spins big past his bat"
"<b>straight to cover</b>. Holder wasn't reading any of the wrist spinners, and he decided on aggression to throw them off their lengths perhaps, but doesn't move his feet. Tries to go inside out to a ball that is not quite full and is spinning across him, ends up not timing it and hitting down cover's throat"
nicely spinning leg break but Brathwaite takes a big stride out and defends with bat beside pad.
"length ball on the stumps, defended from the crease"
"fuller on the stumps, dabbed to point"
bangs it in short but gives Hetmyer enough time to pull this in front of square
"full on the pads, clipped to deep square leg"
"yorker on off stump, slower yorker in fact. Brathwaite holds his position and defends to short mid-off. 97kph"
"and the quicker yorker now, but Brathwaite equal to it, digs it out to the same short mid-on area"
presses forward early and nudges it to short fine leg
"tossed up on off again, a bit too full, driven to long-off. <i>Dheere, dheere</i> says Dhoni from behind the stumps. That's 'slow, slow'"
"quicker one, he has decided to play it off the pitch, stays on the crease and jams his bat down at the last moment"
"drifts it across, and slows it down, Hetmyer swings and misses"
"too short this time, giving Hetmyer enough to time to rock back and punch this through cover"
"goes back to bowling quicker, jabbed into the offside"
"<b>terrific take by Dhoni</b> Back of a length and bowled from wider of the crease, holds its line and opens up Brathwaite, who can only follow the ball with bat and snick through. Dhoni dives to his right and takes a one-handed catch."
"<b>oh that's a dead duck</b> 144 kph and Fabian Allen is going for a review, but I think this is just a review because he's the last man with batting chops left. Fast 144kph ball on a length, nipping in, catches him on the crease, his bat is too late coming down and hits him on the knee roll. No bat involved, and it's umpire's call on hitting the stumps. So Allen has to go, but West Indies keep their review."
"goes for the slower yorker, at 97kph and somehow, <i>somehow</i> Kemar Roach jams his bat down and digs it out"
"length ball outside off, punched to point"
"back of a length, pushing him on the back foot but Roach shows good composure in getting behind the line nicely and defending"
"nasty bouncer to finish, and Roach has to duck under it at the last moment to avoid being pinged. <b>double wicket maiden</b>"
"length ball on middle and leg spinning into him, looks to dab it to the legside, and evades a diving leg-slip"
"comes forward to defend, ball rolls of his pad"
"leg-slip in action again, it's Pandya there. Nudged around the corner and Pandya dives forward but he caught it on the bounce. Half-claimed it, but then said it bounced"
""
driven to long-off
"tossed up on off, slogged across the line to long-on"
"length, outside off, angles away and Hetmyer lets it go through"
"length, and straightens into him, as he defends"
"<strong>PLAYED STRAIGHT TO POINT!</strong> Shami comes around the wicket, and sends one outside off, with some width from the length too. Hetmyer has a swing at it, but cannot keep it down, and gets it straight to KL Rahul. India go up, as does the crowd. The end is nigh, folks..."
"dug in short, and he ducks inside the line of this. Called a wide"
"short, and moves away from outside off, and he has a little swish at it. Misses out on contact"
"short, and he jumps in defending it towards short midwicket. Wants a single, but asked to go back by Roach"
"fuller ball, and he walks across the stumps and is able to get it down towards fine leg. Given as leg byes, as he shuffled across, but it would seem heading down leg side"
"slaps a length ball across the line, and gets it to the midwicket fence. Not the most classical, but <strong>very effective...</strong>"
"tossed up, outside off, and he has sent this a <strong>long, long way</strong>! He swats this way over the top of long on. Good enough to follow up with a salute, we reckon..."
"flatter, outside off, and he drives this to covers"
"length, outside off, and he pushes this to point"
"wrong 'un, and he has moved inside the line of this. Given out leg-before, as he misses out with an intended flick. Will they review this? Nope. Off he walks then..."
"tossed up, from around the wicket, and he defends"
goes back to Kuldeep and drives him down to mid off
"presses forward to defend a ball tossed up outside off, turning back in"
"flighted, and he presses forward to smother this under his eyes"
"wrong 'un, slides across him from a length, and he defends it off the crease"
"tossed up, and he drives this down to mid off"
"tossed up, Dhoni whips the bails off, but Roach's back foot was rooted inside the crease this time. Good flight to beat the outside edge, as it carries on with the angle"
"tries a slog sweep, but hits him on the pad. Pitched outside leg, though"
"tossed up, seems to have taken the edge as it goes through towards Rohit Sharma. Rohit dives away to his right to pouch this. They want to refer this to the TV umpire, and the <strong>soft signal is out</strong>! Good length ball, tossed up, and kisses hte outside of the bat as he looks to push at it, and seems to have just about carried to him. Some bit of his fingers look like they were underneath the ball. The TV umpire seems to agree that he doesn't have enough conclusive evidence to overturn the soft signal. Oh the irony, if Rohit Sharma is involved in the first and last dismissal with TV replays to suggest what happened and didn't...No, looks like Michael Gough is giving this not out!"
"tossed up, outside off, turns into him, and he defends"
"tossed up, and he swings this away towards long leg. <strong>Gets four for it!</strong>"
"flighted, and angles across him, as Thomas comes forward to defend. Didn't know a lot about that"
"tossed up, and he swings this around towards deep midwicket, but <strong>KL Rahul just cannot hold on to it</strong>! Runs in from the fence, and just seems to not have got his hands around to it as he dives forward. I think that is <b>just the second drop</b> by India through this World Cup!"
"flighted, and he looks to go down the ground. The turn takes it away towards sweeper cover, but it lands well short of the fielder there..."
"tossed up, outside off, and Roach has slapped this straight down the ground. Hits the skirting, but just after hitting the ground. <strong>Imperious!</strong>"
"presses forward to a length ball, straightening into him, and blocks it back down the pitch"
"tossed up, and he presses forward to defend as it turns into him"
"flighted from around the wicket now, and he drives it hard towards extra cover"
"wrong 'un, and Thomas is caught up inside the crease, but luckily it runs off his body into the ground just around his right hip"
"tossed up, on the stumps, and he swings free through midwicket. Good swipe away from Roach"
"fuller, and he looks to drive this, but misses. <strong>Didn't miss the stumps by much!</strong>"
"wrong 'un, slipped in quicker, and he looks to go through midwicket, but misses. Bowled at <strong>94kph</strong>"
"leg spin now, as Roach misses out with an attempted swat down the ground"
presses forward to defend a length ball
"outside off, full, and he swings, and the top edge carries it over and past first slip. <strong>Through for four down to third man!</strong>"
"full ball from around the wicket, and Thomas stretches to defend"
"short ball, seems to have come off his shoulder. <strong>India want to review this as Shami catches it on the follow-through!</strong> It's taken the glove as he looks to pull but sees the ball get pretty big on him, and that should be all over. Michael Gough gives this out. A TV replay leads to enough evidence to overturn the original decision, in almost perfect symmetry to how the first wicket fell"
