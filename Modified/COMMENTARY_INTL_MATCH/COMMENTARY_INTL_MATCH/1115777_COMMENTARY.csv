"<b>oh, you beauty!</b> Sensational delivery from Sodhi. Goodness, is there a better sight than a googly sneaking through the defences?

"full outside off, a turning bat as he looks to cream one through the covers"
"superb shot criminally kept to two by a superb fielding effort. It's a nice, late back foot slice with the movement from outside off. Looks to have bisected point and gully, but point leaps to his right and gets a hand on it"
overpitched on off stump and driven sweetly back towards the bowler who can't hold on in his run up
"<b>survives an lbw and a run out.</b> Is this his day? Length ball pitches outside leg and strikes him dead in front of middle stump. He's running in panic and is way outside as second slip picks up and shies, only to miss"
<b>survives a top edge</b> now as he looks to hook. Completely late on it as it climbs sharply towards his helmet. He manages to clear keeper and it lands between short fine and the slip fielder running backwards

back of a length just outside off. Tapped to cover
<b>flies past gully!</b> It's common practice to have the fielder in for Williamson for his dabs. This one is slapped hard though. It's close to the man but there's too much pace on it. A touch short from the bowler and it's all he needs
"short of a length outside off, sliced past gully to pick up a second to third man's right"
<b>glorious.</b> Williamson has played three different strokes through the same region to pick up ten runs in three balls. He brings up 5000 ODI runs. The <b>fifth fastest</b> to that mark.

"good length just outside off, punched on the up to extra cover"
<b>chips to deep square's left and survives.</b> He is the survivor today. Plays the pick-up shot to this full ball on leg stump. It stops on him and he gets it very high. Wood sprints to his right and leaps one-handed but that was difficult

"<B>a salmon leap at short cover from Stokes!</B> And that is the breakthrough that England so desperately needed! The ball seemed to stick in the pitch as Munro hurled his hands through the line, but what a snaffle, diving to his left, one for the cameras, and is that the moment that England come to the party?"

worked off the pads to square leg
"<strong>down the track again, and holes out to point!</strong> Oh dear, that's terrible. Galloping out of his crease, but horribly skewing his shot on impact, losing his shape in his eagerness to batter it senseless, and New Zealand have shipped another relatively quick wicket..."
"huge appeal, and England are reviewing! Tossed right up into the toes, and that looked to have struck him very flush indeed. No bat involved, it would seem... a suspicion that it was sliding down leg, but did it turn enough? Ball tracker will tell us... <strong>yes indeed, it is taking out leg stump!</strong> Latham is gone first ball, and now we've got a contest!"
"stretching forward, not quite to the pitch of a well-flighted legbreak, but fenced away all the same"

"a hopeful appeal as Nicholls is struck on the front pad, but further proof that England are brawling..."
"<B>big legbreak, clips something and flies to slip!</B> Up goes the finger, but Nicholls reviews. Was there an inside edge? He clearly thinks not, but it's adjacent for the lbw either way. <strong>And yes, that is stone dead!</strong> He hedged his bets, utterly unable to read Rashid's variations, and suddenly the New Zealand innings is gurgling down the plughole!"

"stretching down the track, pushed to cover"
"very full once more, poked off the toe of the bat, straight back to the bowler"
"lots of air outside off stump, drilled hard out to deep cover"

"hitting with the spin this time, down the track a couple of steps and a more comfortable lofted tonk out to no-man's land at deep midwicket. The hundred's up by the way, but not sure NZ are celebrating"

"slider, outside off, Santner sizes it up and plays no stroke"
"<B>clipped in the air and Roy scoops it at midwicket!</B> He's admitted he's unsure if it carried, however, which probably means it didn't. They go upstairs, and the soft signal is not out... definitely not a bump ball, but there's no obvious camera angle to confirm the decision. He seemed to get there on the full ... but there's nothing conclusive. On we go."

"full on middle stump, driven firmly to long-on"
good length on off stump. Thuds the toe-end hard as he offers the full face
"<B>drops Williamson but it looks like he's got Santner with a fingertip!</b> Surely. They've sent it upstairs but Santner isn't waiting. Oh what a terrible way to go. Santner has his bat high up, probably because it's a firm drive that he expects to come towards him. This means he has a longer distance down towards the crease. Woakes gets half a finger. Santner whacks himself on the pad after getting into the dressing room. That's the first time he's been dismissed in the series. Is that it for England?"

"<b>Stokes takes it at deep square.</b> Top class from Woakes. Really good bowling. Seam-up slower ball on a length at off stump. He knows Southee is going to shuffle, and shuffle he does. Looks to go behind square but he's done by the variation. Launches it high and it's an easy catch"

"slower short ball outside off. Looks to nudge it through the open midwicket, possibly for the second. But it rolls back to the bowler. Should he have cut that with backward point and short third man in?"

slower ball dropped short. Jumps into the off side and pulls to deep square
"<b>he looks to go leg side and is beaten.</b> It's length, it's a slower ball wide outside off. He shuffles and swipes to be beaten"
<b>goes leg side again</b> with the attempted scoop. It's a length ball wide outside off. He barely gets bat on this to get it to deep square's right
"<b>swats it wide to deep square's left!</b> Persists with the leg side, gets a short ball that sits nicely in the pitch and he absolutely wallops this! Flat, dipping over the fence as Stokes signals to the umpires that it's a six. There is life in this still!"
"<b>and he continues to go leg side!</b> This time he gambles for the second and he manages to get it! Or has he? It's a run out appeal. He has comfortably made it. Taps this full toss between long-on and deep midwicket to come back for the second. It was full and wide outside off, <i>yet again</i>"
"<B>walks at the full toss and taps it straight to mid-off!</b> Oh that's anti-climactic and how! Right in the slot, there for the tap over mid-off or extra cover - even over midwicket! But it's a feeble push straight to Root on the bounce. Sends Sodhi back"
"<b>Woakes seals it with a wide yorker!</b> Williamson walks into the off side yet again. Looks to dab it to third man to find the tie. The ball is past the marker, but that's because Woakes knows what Williamson's about to do. Won't get bat on it"
