"back of a length and outside off, Roy lets it go. There is some outswing which gives merit to the one slip in place"
"<b>inside edge</b> as Roy attempts to punch through the covers. His front foot moving so little hampers those plans and the ball ends up wandering away to square leg. On another day, he might even have been bowled"
"good length, outside off, Gambhir looks to slash it through the off side, can't make contact"
"nice and tight on middle, Gambhir works it off his knees to midwicket"
"<b>rippah</b>! Umesh hits the deck and makes the new ball jag away past the outside edge. Gambhir is stuck in his crease, he's pushing at the ball nervously, he's easily beaten"
gets off his toes to nudge the shortish delivery off middle stump to midwicket
"flattens the stumps with a <b>blistering straight drive</b>. He sees the ball in his half, lunges forward gleefully and presents the full face of the bat. Woakes would be thrilled those wooden things were stuck where they were"
"good length ball outside off, Gambhir goes for an on-the-up drive over mid-off. No connection"
"lovely work from the captain, waiting that little bit extra to turn a ball that is on his pads far enough behind square leg for a couple of runs"
"slower bouncer - and it's very well executed too. Gambhir spots the length early but not the change in pace. He's into the pull shot and though he tries to adjust his bat swing, he misses the ball and it goes off his body towards point"
swats a back of a length delivery outside off down to long-on
"spears in a yorker, at the base of middle stump. Gambhir does well to yank his feet out of the way and bring a vertical bat down to find a single through square leg"
"full and outside off, spears it to mid-off"
"top-edges the pull and Umesh strikes early again! It's a short ball, Gambhir tries to drag it from outside off. It gets a bit big on him. The bat face turns in his hand. The ball has no timing on it as it goes up and Chahal jogs back at square leg to take an easy catch"
"full on middle and leg, he flicks to midwicket"
"nails the backfoot cover drive, but finds the fielder again."
"slower ball, in line with the stumps, Roy tries to force it through midwicket. No luck"
changes tactics and uses soft hands to bunt the back of a length ball towards point for a single
"<b>massive turn and is it enough to stump him?</b>. He pushes it through on leg stump, demanding Roy to hit against the turn. The batsman tries, he's beaten all ends up, but the good thing is, his back leg did not lift up off the crease."
"slows it down this time, letting the ball drift into the pads. This time the ball slides through without turning to the wicketkeeper"
shifts himself leg side of a tossed up ball on middle and drives into the covers
"shimmies down the track, but Chahal spots it early, pulls his length back, and doesn't give any room. Roy tries a flick and is hit on the pads. All he can get is a leg bye"
hangs back and whips a shortish delivery through midwicket
"<b>rips it past the outside edge again</b>! Beautiful bowling from the leggie. He loops it up on middle, draws Roy forward, gets pretty decent purchase off the pitch and leaves Roy looking utterly bewildered"
"panics and goes for a reverse sweep, even those last-ditch measures don't work. Chahal reads the batsman perfectly, bowls on middle and leg, not allowing Roy the room he needs to work the ball"
"full and outside off, drives to mid-off"
"opens the face to try and find some runs behind point. There are none and so Roy is sent back. Mandeep hits the stumps direct and they pinch a single off the overthrow. Then the man backing up hits the stumps direct at the non-strikers now. Two perfect throws, no wickets"
gets up with the short ball on middle and deftly turns it around the corner to fine leg. Simple
stands up tall again and nudges the short ball to midwicket
"back of a length and outside off, slaps it through point. No boundaries for four overs and suddenly two in the space of three balls"
drives on the up and gets an outside edge away to third man
"it's a short ball, giving him the room to free his arms, but Iyer finds short midwicket with a mistimed pull"
neatly nudges a good length ball off middle stump to deep midwicket
<b>third time beaten</b>! And this is huge turn! Chahal pitches it on middle. Roy is uncertain as he pushes forward. He could have had a bat as broad as five feet and he would still have missed it
"knocks over leg stump! Sensational bowling from Chahal. After sowing doubts with big turning legbreaks, he sends down the flipper. Very quick, a shade short, on leg stump, tempting the batsman to back away and cut and beating him for pace. So Chahal is not just turning the ball off the pitch, but skid on too."
makes room and cuts the short ball away to the cover boundary. Super shot. Plenty of bottom hand power
turns a good length ball - which turns sharply again - to short fine leg
"shortish and outside off, he glides it to point"

flicks a very full ball on leg stump to deep square leg
"good length on off stump, he dabs it behind point"
goes around the wicket to the left-hander and even Sundar - who rarely gets the ball to move sideways - is beating the edge with turn.
gets down low and muscles the full ball on middle stump to the point boundary - with a reverse sweep. Very tough shot to pull off but he does it so very well
"he's very wary of slow deliveries in line with the stumps. Waits until it gets to him, uses soft hands, angles the face and taps the ball gently to point"
"full and outside off, blocks through cover point"
"full on middle and off, Pant shuffles across his stumps and turns it to midwicket"
effortlessly flicks a length ball on off stump to deep midwicket. Touch of class in that.
hammers the short and wide delivery as ferociously as he could to deep point
superb timing! He stands up tall against the short and wide delivery and slaps it to the left of the fielder in the deep.
"not quite enough room so Iyer plays within himself, gliding the short ball down to third man"
"top work from Mandeep at point, diving to his left to stop a cut shot that might rival a bazooka for power"
"jeez, that's outrageous! it's a half-volley on leg stump and Iyer treats it fairly kindly. All he does is flick the ball. Some other-worldly force takes it over the boundary at midwicket. And we have a time out to figure out just what happened there..."
tosses it up from around the wicket on middle stump. Pant tucks it to midwicket
"lets the ball come to him, meeting it under his eyes for a flick to the left of midwicket"
gets across on off stump and sends a good length ball away to deep square leg
blocks to cover point and jogs across to the other end
another block into the off side for a single
"gets down the track, to the pitch of a good length ball on leg stump, and works it to long-on"
slashes as hard as he can through the line of a good length ball outside off. No connection

gets forward to block behind third man
works a shortish delivery from outside off to the right of long-on

"pushes it through on leg stump, Pant looks to pull it away but makes contact with only thigh pad"
carves the back of a length delivery down to deep third man
is he trying to leave or ramp or pull? Ends up doing half of each shot and sends the short ball to midwicket

clears the front leg and laces the length ball on middle stump over extra cover. Amazing shot
"shortish on off stump, knocks it down to point"
"launches it down the ground! He spots a half-volley, and this time takes great pains to get under the ball and secure the elevation needed to clear the boundary"
<b>see ya!</b> Sundar skids a short of a length ball at the pads from around the wickets and Iyer drops all the technique training he's done through his life and swings wildly to send it a long way over deep midwicket
"<b>fifty</b> for Iyer, and this one is fetched from wide outside off. Length and across him. He reaches a long way and drags it wide of deep midwicket as he clears the boundary to his left"
"full toss on middle stump, flicks to deep midwicket"
"length ball floated up at middle, sweeps along the floor to long leg"
<b>thick outside edge to short third man.</b> It's almost like he's a fast bowler. Fires it full and wide outside off - almost past the wide marker. Iyer reaches out again but this one is drifting away and he won't be able to get it into the leg side. It lobs straight to the fielder there
"length ball on off stump, gets on the back foot and tickles it to short fine off the inside edge. That came on quicker than he anticipated"
"length ball on leg stump, stays tall in the crease and chips this to deep square's right"
"<b>just misses the stumps</b> as Maxwell goes on the back foot again. It's an inside edge that trickles past the stumps. De Kock then runs in and takes aim at the non-striker's stumps. Hits the stumps too but Maxwell is safe, as the replays confirm. He's also come back for a second"
"length ball just outside off, defended into the covers off the back foot"
length ball just outside off. A short-arm pull as this skids on. Febbly rolls out to long-on
attempted slower ball is pushed very wide. It's also quite short
"full toss on off stump, shovels it straight to midwicket. Missed out..."
"<b>Pant is struck above his back knee</b> as this tails away from him when he tries to slog it. He's on the floor. In the mean time, RCB are reviewing for lbw. It was given not out. Possibly pitching outside leg. No doubt with line otherwise I'd say...yes, pitching well outside leg. Woeful review. Pant's back on his feet. On we go."
back of a length and pushed through. Leg stump line and he gets on the back foot to punch to deep midwicket
"good length outside off, deep in the crease as he taps this to long-off"
"<b>Siraj runs to his right</b> and lunges to hold on at short third man. Maxwell is done by Chahal's slowness. It's tossed right up at a length outside off, and he looks to go over square on the off side with a reverse sweep. Ends up slicing it because he's through the shot too early. An indifferent season continues to go badly for Maxwell. Royal Challengers, like most teams, will be happy to see him gone in the 16th over"
<b>beats him in flight</b> and is probably excited for a while before he remembers which ground this is. Pant with a big heave at this loopy length ball googly outside off. Miscues it completely but that's sailed over long-off
<b>reverse-swat</b> clears the third man boundary! It's a short of a length ball and Pant swivels quickly before having to really drag this using his forearms. Manages it somehow and clears the line
"<b>lbw appeal</b> is turned down. Looking to ramp it fine this time as Chahal fires in what looks like a seam-up ball on leg stump. It's full and fast and catches him on the leg, but the umpire says no. Probably pitching outside"
"he's aiming for third man, gets a thick outside edge to a good length ball outside off, and it works in his favour as the ball scurries away to the boundary"
<b>beats him</b> with a length ball outside off. Looks like he gets just enough away movement off it.
"shortish, cramping him on leg stump. Pant, even as he tries to make room, ends up pushing to cover"
"runs back, leaps up, sticks a hand out, but the ball evades mid-off! Tough break for Siraj, and even worse, it runs away to the boundary. Mis-hit loft from Tewatia"
falls short of cover - which is where Siraj is at now. The ball has it in for him. Tewatia goes gung ho again at a full delivery
"<b>fifty</b>! And it comes off a very good shot - largely because he picks the slower ball, then the most vulnerable part of the field and exploits both. Pull shot past short fine leg. Oh wait, maybe I am overselling it. The shot comes off an inside edge. Sorry!"
looks for the yorker on leg stump and refuses Pant the room to get under the ball. Ends up having to settle for a leg bye
"low full toss in line with the stumps, but Pant somehow flicks it over the square leg boundary, despite there being a man positioned to take a catch"
"full and outside off, he bangs it back down the ground and Siraj is in the way"
"slower ball and a premeditating Pant, looking to slog sweep the ball, is beaten soundly. Only problem is the umpire decides he's strayed too far outside off"
"goes short on middle, Pant lets it go and then goes around yelling at himself."
"pumps it down the ground! This is a back of a length ball. And he unleashes a front foot lofted drive. That's tough to pull off. His bottom-hand strength and bat swing must be insane; has to be to get under the ball, and make contact with the middle of the bat and not the high part of it."
"half-volley on leg stump, Pant flicks it handsomely to deep midwicket"
"full and outside off stump, Pant monsters it over cover. It's bat speed again. He sees the chance to free the arms and he holds absolutely nothing back. RCB leaking runs in the death again"
"looks to carve the short ball over point, but there isn't quite enough room for him to do so."
"the perfect wide yorker. Inside the line, but too far from the reach of the batsman"
"walks across and swipes at a short ball, looking for the long leg boundary. Ends up with a miscue over the wicketkeeper. Comes off the thigh pad. <b>Fifty partnership in 20 balls. Pant has made 41 of those</b>"
"<b>what the weirdness...</b> Woakes is looking for the wide yorker. Misses his mark by about two inches. And Pant is waiting, crouched in his stance, the bat face open, and at the perfect time, unleashes a scoop over third man"
"now the other side, walking across his stumps to make sure he can scoop a slower short ball outside off over short fine leg's head. Pant is giving the Daredevils a total well beyond their wildest dreams when they were 28 for 2 after the Powerplay"
"slow, full, on leg stump. Tewatia looks for the sweep, makes no contact, has to settle for a leg bye"
runs down the pitch and decimates a length ball over long-on. That's travelled!
spots the left-hander switching his stance for a reverse scoop and so plants the ball over the wide line to keep it out of Pant's reach
"taken at long-on. Pant has produced some sensational shots. He looks for another, against a slower ball outside off, but this time it comes right off the bottom of the bat. Goes high instead of long and AB de Villiers takes a striaghtforward catch"
"pretends to make room outside leg. The bowler lands it around the yorker outside off. Tewatia jumps in line with it, gets low, and scoops it over fine leg. Also, while running down the pitch, trying to take a single. he collides with Anderson"
"full and outside off, looks for a slash, only gets a bottom edge to the wicketkeeper"
"full on middle, with a hint of away swing. De Kock does well to present a straight bat"
"back of a length on off stump, punches it into the covers"
"pristine hit! The on the up drive works perfectly, showing how well this new ball is coming onto the bat. All de Kock does is open the face to beat cover on his right"
""
"full on leg stump, de Kock takes care not to hit across the line and finds a single at mid-on"
"huuuuuuge appeal for lbw but the umpire isn't swayed by it. Beautiful bowling from Boult, pitching up to the new batsman, getting the ball to curl into him late. Vohra is not at all ready for the fiendish delivery. He tries to play a shot into the leg side and possibly gets an inside edge? Cause otherwise that kinda looks plumb"
short and wide outside off. Comes on slowly and he can't get power on the cut. It's a tap to point in the end
"length on off stump, pushed in front of cover point with soft hands"

"back of a length just outside off, defended towards midwicket off the back foot"
length ball spins down leg side and past his attempted flick
"short of a length at leg stump, glanced uppishly to short fine"
<b>nervous Roy at deep backward square.</b> Looks like he's held on! Vohra stops halfway through a sweep against a leg side ball. It's a top edge that hangs up teasingly for Roy who might have lost it early on in the air because he looked very nervous as he ran in. But he manages to get down quickly and he has his fingers around the ball
"good length outside off with some late swing inwards. No feet as Kohli looks to drive through the cover, well away from the body. Gets an inside edge onto pad"
"length ball swinging away wide outside off, taps on the up to sweeper cover"
"short of a length just outside off, walks into it and runs it down to third man"

"short of a length and in at middle stump, gets on the back foot and punches to deep midwicket"
"<b>outside edge past slip!</b> Oh Nadeem will think about this all night if Kohli makes runs today! He's beaten him in flight, got the ball to turn away from length outside off and induced an edge.  Slip is very very wide and that's four"
"<b>horrendous</b> running and De Kock has ended up sacrificing his wicket. There is no run there. De Kock thinks so, but his no either isn't accepted or isn't heard, as Kohli keeps taking strides down the pitch as he watches the ball roll towards backward point. In the end, Kohli is halfway down, De Kock is stranded and he crosses over to give his wicket away"
"length outside off, cut straight to cover"

oh what a shot! Length ball curving in at leg stump and he opens up his body and wrists so nicely to make room and go over extra cover with the turn
"length ball outside off, driven firmly on the up to mid-off"
<b>beats the outside edge.</b> Back of a length ball outside off and he jabs at it on the angle. But it holds itself in the pitch and jags away
bouncer dug in very shot. Gets big on Kohli and he ducks under it
<b>just clears Vijay Shankar</b> at deep square leg! Oh that's really close. Length ball lifting up at him as he walks into it. Whips his wrists at this to pick it up. Shankar sprints to his left and puts in a big leap to his left - and he's a tall man - but he can't get a hand on this
"length ball on middle stump, flicked on the up to midwicket's left but can't beat his dive"
short and wide outside off. Steps out and swats at it but can't make connection
"length ball angled in at leg stump, gets on the back foot and taps it to deep midwicket"
"<b>hits Pant's right knee</b> and is nearly run out. Kohli looking to run this late cut fine, is already running down the pitch. But Pant has stuck a leg out and nearly gets this to deflect onto the stumps"
"short of a length outside off, driven uppishly to sweeper cover off the back foot"
"length ball outside off, gets a big stride in and sweeps against the turn to bisect deep square and deep midwicket"
<B>stunning!</b> A back foot punch after forcing the bowler to bowl short with the sweep last ball. It's on middle stump and he's promptly back in the crease - right back - to get this between deep midwicket and long-on
"and now the sweep again! Nadeem tosses this right up, full and wide outside off. No sweeping from there, right? Wrong. AB shuffles and swats it even harder this time to beat deep midwicket"
"can't stop the bleeding! Overpitched ball on the pads and Kohli merely leans into this, gets his body weight into the bat and closes the wrists at the last moment to caress this between deep square and deep midwicket"
length ball angled into the stumps. Walks down the pitch and nudges to long-on on the up
"short ball outside off, mistimed hook into the turf. Gets it out to deep midwicket"
"short ball angled in at the corridor. Mistimed pull, this time. But it's not aerial. Single at deep midwicket"
<b>leading edge</b> goes over Morris. It's a back-of-the-hand slower ball that loops in at middle stump. De Villiers gets it on the full but he hasn't picked it. His flick ends up at mid-off

"short of a length and wide outside off, a nicely timed square drive finds sweeper cover"

"short of a length, pushed through flat and skidding into him as he gets on the back foot. Punches it to long-on"
"length ball on leg stump, nudged to deep square off the back foot"
"drops it short and doesn't bother to look! Tewatia has been slapped to the <b>edge of the Chinnaswamy's roof</b>, and for effect, AB makes sure it bounces back into the ground from there so that the game can move on. Proper pull shot over deep midwicket"
"length ball on off, driven to extra cover"
"short of a length on leg stump, shovelled to deep midwicket off the back foot"
slow and short. Kohli nearly misses this one as he tries to go too square with the pull. But he manages to stay on his feet and get bat for a single at deep square
"length ball outside off, punched on the up to mid-off"

"short ball wide outside off, scythes it to sweeper cover"

"<b>get out of here Trent Boult!</b> Someone check if that isn't a robot there! This is sensational. A one-handed leap to his right at deep square after being wrong-footed to his left, then a landing backwards and a cobra pose to keep his chest from touching the rope! Soft signal out. Replays say - OUT. Wow. Unbelievable. It's a full toss on the pads and it's flying, flat over Boult's head because Kohli has got good power on that flick. It's a stunning recovery from Boult. A leap backwards, holding on with the right hand, landing on his stomach and then stopping all that momentum to complete it. Gets back on his feet and even he's in shock."

"full on off stump, driven to extra cover where Boult - believe it or not - allows it to come on, <b>puts a barrier behind</b> it and fields one with his body completely aligned."
"who cares if the opposition just sparked to life? I'ma see this length ball and pulverise it over long-on. Thank you very much. That's what's going on in AB's head. I'm paraphrasing, of course."
"dismisses it to the boundary - he was eyeing midwicket, but he'll settle for extra cover. Mr 360 at his very best, starting things off by moving across outside off to open up the leg side. But Harshal one-ups him by bowling wide, as far wide as he dares. But AB raises the game with a blistering lofted drive for his <b>fifty, off only 24 balls</b>"
"hits the yorker length, AB knocks it down to long-on"
"<b>thick outside edge</b> as he looks to go big over cover. Third man is stuck on the boundary, perhaps not picking that the ball is coming towards him. Eventually comes up to take the ball on the bounce"
"bounces him this time, de Villiers is prepared for it, sways back to ramp the ball over short third man. He misses it. Miracles do happen"
"sweeps the fast bowler over square leg! Pure audaciousness from the very best in the world. He could block a million balls with a Test on the line. He could get a fifty off 20 odd in a T20, skipping outside off and screwing up the opposition's plans. No country for near yorkers"

"full and outside off, down comes that blade, full of vengeance, to bludgeon the ball to deep cover."

"short of a length and outside off, punches to deep point"
"tries to cramp AB with a back of a length ball on leg stump, the batsman swings it away to short fine leg"
he's not targeting the boundary - HE'S TARGETING THE BLEEPIN ROOF! Length ball. The absolute last thing you bowl to AB. And he clatters it straight down the ground.
"slower ball, sliding down leg, AB swipes it to the left of short fine leg. He's GPSing the ball into the gaps now. Simple as that."
"goes for a bouncer, from around the wicket, but it goes too high. In looking to escape AB's punishment, he runs into the umpire's wrath"
"<b>top edge</b> but with the ball going only as far as the 30 yard circle, and everyone on the leg side in the deep, AB's very very safe"
he's blocking a full toss - while his partner is belting yorkers. This is just bonkers
Anderson's decided I want a slice of this pie. Takes a full toss around waist high and nails it over deep midwicket
"the perfect wide yorker, with a tinge of away swing to beat Anderson's reach"
"low full toss on leg stump, heaves it out to long-on"
"<b>both batsmen are at the same end</b>! Anderson races through the moment AB glides the short ball to point. But AB himself is not terribly keen. Then he changes his mind and goes for the run. But wait, by that point Anderson realises he should get back to the non-strikers' end and all of that culminates with both he, AB and the bowler Boult waiting on the fielder. The throw is poor, even Boult can't save its blushes. And so, Anderson has the chance to complete the single he so dearly wanted"
"144. 8 kph. And it's good enough to beat Anderson, who is swinging for the fences. Done by pure pace. This is what the non-millenials say you miss, I hit."
"shortish and outside off, taps it down to third man"
"top-edge sails away to the boundary behind him. Well, that's one way to do it."

nudges the length ball to short midwicket
"wallops the back of a length ball outside off over mid-off. Roy is the man haring after it, hoping to drag it back, throwing himself head-first at the ball. It's travelled too far, and he might have hurt himself from the effort. He's on his haunches with a crowd around him, talking to Chris Morris and the physio. <b>Roy has gone off the field</b>"
"slow, dipping full toss. Mandeep flicks through square leg and steals the strike"
taps a full toss down the ground and pinches a second run as well. RCB need 10 runs to win now. AB needs 19 for a century
drops and runs to cover
"short and outside off, AB chops it to point"
"fullish on leg stump, turns it through midwicket"
"he goes around the wicket for the bouncer, all with the aim of cramping AB up. But the genius that he is, AB sways away, makes his own room and lifts it over short third man's head"
"and just to prove that he and the coaching manual are still good buds, he essays a picture perfect cover drive to finish the game off."
