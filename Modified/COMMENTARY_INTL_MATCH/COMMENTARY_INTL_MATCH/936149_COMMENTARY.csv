"tight line, with a nibble of movement away. Cook leaves alone"
"edged and gone! Terrific build-up and the perfect seamer's dismissal, probing line and length, extra bounce, a touch of movement, and Cook pushes uncertainly to graze an edge to the keeper. He might have left that if he'd been allowed an over or two of sighters, but he wanted to feel bat on ball, and now wishes he hadn't"

"what a catch! Duminy has tickled it down the leg side. Well, well. How things change. Short of a length, 140kph, pitches around leg stump, Duminy looks to flick it away and just gets a touch of gloves.

"tossed slightly wider outside off, defended to the covers"
"uses the angle round the wicket, flicks a straight ball to deep square"
"comes forward, opens the face and pushes this just wide of gully"
"a short ball, de Kock goes for the ramp over the slips - as Mendis did the previous Test - but this carries over the blade"
"back of a length, chopped to third man"
"that's a very powerful stroke, pulls a short delivery from outside off - it was 141kph - and sends it well in front of square"
"and again! A repeat from Elgar, that's crunched through straight midwicket as Kumara drops short outside off"
"gets this full, at off stump, worked into the leg side"
"round the wicket, on the pads, flicked behind square"
tries to play a dab-sweep but it dribbles off the bottom edge and the keeper gathers

"more air, it's a low full toss, flicked down the ground"
defended to the off side
"full outside off, a good diving save at cover cuts off the drive"
"slides on outside off, left alone"
"short, Elgar drives off the back foot to deep cover...a gentle over"
"over the wicket, pushed to cover"
gets his front foot across the crease and flicks from around off stump to deep square

flicked down to long-on
"that's wonderful timing and placement, drives a very full delivery with precision between long-off and deep cover"
lovely ball! He may want to strengthen that cordon... a length ball skims past Elgar's outside edge. Nibble off the seam
"on the pads, nicely timed through square leg"
"full outside off, left alone...taken at head height by Mendis"
"through to the keeper, pitches around the same spot but reaches at the bootlaces of the keeper"
"confusion! Almost a run out, probably should have been. Elgar dabbed a length ball behind square, it was de Kock's call and he came through. Then there was a change of mind, de Kock had to turn and get back. A decent throw, and someone at the stumps, would have had him miles out. Not sure Silva knew which end to throw at"
defended to the bowler
"113kph, on a length at off stump, nudged to the leg side"
"full outside off, onto the front foot and pushes into the covers...Elgar may be getting some cramp by the looks of it"
"short outside off, de Kock rocks back and cuts to deep point"
driven into the covers

"full outside off, 134kph, left alone"
"full at off stump, hint of shape back in, sweetly punched straight down the ground but mid-off can get across"
"that's perfect...full again, just outside off stump, Elgar punches with a perfectly straight bat down the ground. No one getting across to that one. Lovely way to reach a career best...and a century stand"
"drags the length back, outside off, defended"
"angled across, left alone"
"not far from dragging this on, Mathews round the wicket, cramped for room as he tries to cut, gets a bottom edge"
"full, wide, left alone"
"tighter to off stump, 113kph, but left alone again"
"well, he's done it! Or at least it looks like has. Given lbw, but de Kock has called the <b>review</b>. Full from round the wicket, angles in and takes the front pad. Will that he sliding down leg? Certainly no edge. Argh! It's sliding past leg stump. Good review"
"on a length outside off, opens the face and pushes through point"
"well forward outside off, defended to cover"
"full outside off, 133kph, left alone"
"back of a length, quite tight to him but he's able to square drive to deep point"
"what a beauty! Unplayable, even for a man on 129...pitches on middle and off, reasonably full, nips away late off the seam and climbs through to Mendis"
"and edged this time! Lakmal reward again. Lovely stuff. In the channel outside off, was a touch wider than the previous ball, Elgar just feeling for it a little, more seam movement, and a healthy edge to the keeper"
"full and straight, Abbott right across his stumps and there's a big appeal for lbw...given leg bye, but no review. Sliding down leg"
"full at off stump, 133kph, defended to mid-on"

"on a length, tucked through the leg side...both teams will be happy with that being a two"
that's quite close! Abbott makes a late decision to leave and it isn't far away from off stump
"beaten...a full ball outside off, Abbott plays a flat-footed drive"
"that's a fantastic shot...yes, it's gentle pace, but it's whipped a full delivery from off stump serenely wide of mid-on"
"wider outside off, he stretches forward and guides the ball towards third man"
"round the wicket, full outside off, defended"
"back of a length, back-cut towards gully"
"fuller, he drives to mid-off"
"there's a strangled shout for lbw, this squeezes between bat and pad from a full length and Mathews has called for a <b>review</b>. Looks a gamble. Round the wicket, beats the inside edge, hits the back leg. Outside off and high by looks of it. Yes to both. So apart from that it was stone dead. An awful review, frankly"
"a short ball outside off, Abbott sways out of the line"

"much fuller and that's a super shot, Abbott gets onto the front foot and punches through the line straight of mid-off"
"a bouncer, over middle at 134kph, Abbott ducks"
"and he finishes the day in style, Kumara goes full and straight, flicked strongly through wide mid-on with a sweet flick"
"well, that's not a bad way to start off...a full, wide delivery which he eases forward to and drives beautifully between cover and mid-off"

"on a length outside off, 127kph, defended to the off side"
"back of a length, left alone"

"leans forward, defends to the bowler"

worked off the pads into midwicket
"fuller at the stumps, he comes forward and blocks back to Herath"

"a bouncer, over off stump, he ducks...and it's a no-ball"
"full at off stump, worked with a closed face through the leg side"
"he's gone now! A fourth for Kumara...but has it carried? Yes, given out on the field. Didn't even go upstairs. Clearly carried. Good on-field decision. Round the wicket, de Kock feeling for a ball with a hint of width as he tries to run the ball to the off side. Neat catch, he had to come forward"
tucks this off his pads behind square to long leg
"a bouncer, slung down the leg side"

"back of a length, outside off, pushed on the up to cover"

worked into the leg side
tidy but unthreatening
"whoops, that slipped! A wild full toss, arrived at chest height outside off, and Maharaj did well to keep his focus with a straight-batted push to the edge of the cover boundary"
"outside off, dabbed to point and a bit of a loose shy as the batsman veered off to the right in expectation of the throw. Never understand why runners do that for tight singles. Self-preservation I guess."

"a whooshing drive, beats the inside edge. Not a lot of footwork there"

"five for Kumara! First ball back in the attack, and it's a jaffa. Outside off, tight to off stump, climbs into the edge after pitching, with a hint of movement off the seam, and a thin nick through to the keeper. Well bowled young man. He's got a very promising future if he can build on this performance"

"driven firmly down the ground, that's an attractive way to get off the mark"

"plays for turn,  but this one goes straight, and just eludes the edge"
whipped back to the bowler with a slightly loose swish across the line

"on the pads, nibbling from leg to off, defended back down the pitch"
"on the pads, turned to leg"
bunted to the leg side

"tight line on leg stump, defended with a perpendicular blade"

"a fizzer and six for Kumara! Zipping off the seam, grazing the inside-edge as Rabada was caught on the crease. He is walking, but the dressing-room have urged him to use his <B>review</B>. It makes no difference. Off they go. South Africa take the innings spoils, but Kumara claims the morning's honours. Well bowled"

"on the pads, deflects down to long leg"

"full outside off, left alone"
"moves away off the seam, full and left alone"

"an uncertain forcing shot, a full length, ball swinging back, Karunaratne comes forward to drive and the ball squirts wide of short leg"
"what a ball! Seam and bounce...this leaps off a good length, zips past the outside edge and glove. Almost takes de Kock in the face"
did that reach Vern on the full?! He punches a full delivery straight down the pitch. Philander gets low in his followthrough. Was just short

"on off stump, defended to the covers"
"gets forward, plays towards mid-off"
"direct hit! That man Bavuma! Has Karunaratne made his ground with a dive...yes, he has. He gets a good stretch it and forces his bat over the line. Was dropped into the off side and Bavuma was on it in a flash from point and hit direct with an under-arm flick. Gets in a very similar position to that Perth run out"

"very full length, attacking the base of off stump and defended on the front foot"
on a fifth-stump line. No need to play a shot there

solid block back down the track
"zipping through to the keeper, this one kicks off the pitch and beats another loose push"
through to the keeper with good pace and carry
"shoulders arms, and through to the keeper"
"banged in short, an inside edge as Silva is trapped on the crease, and the extra bounce does for him! The stumps are rattled as the ball cannons down into the crease, and Sri Lanka's solidity is starting to liquidise"
"angled into the right-hander, worked to leg"
"good areas outside off. 'Yes, KG!' is the cry from the cordon. South Africa have their dander up"

"much fuller and straighter, that's a threatening line. Demanding a full-faced block"
"full again, and that awkward length almost pays dividends as Mendis chips his shot just short of mid-on"
"this is a lovely little rhythm now. Wicket-to-wicket line, a nibble of movement, attacking the top of off at all times, and Mendis splices his defensive push just short of the cordon"

"back of a length, defended with a hop into the leg side"
"a loose poke outside off, as Abbott's angle from round the wicket almost draws the edge"

"well bowled. Full length, jagging back into the pads, blocked urgently"
"down the leg side, a wave of bat as the ball slides by"

midwicket in business again as Mendis flicks off his toes

fully forward to block
pushed up to mid-on

"the ploy works! Mendis drops to one knee to line up the cow corner boundary again, but this one drifts in, straightens, and spirals off a top edge to plop into Duminy's hands at short cover. A big blow"
driven hard into the covers
solid block on the front foot
"quicker and flatter, poked into the leg side. A lively over"
"round the wicket, full outside off, this trundles through to the keeper"
"at off stump, 137kph, defended on the front foot"
"slapped to point! Super catch from Bavuma. Short, wide outside off, Karunaratne's eyes light up and he goes for the cut, doesn't keep the ball down, and Bavuma springs low to his left to hold a sharp one"

slung down the leg side again
"angled down the leg side again, closer to the pads this time...excellent diving take by de Kock"
"big appeal for lbw! Was it angling down the leg side? Faf decides to call for the <B>review</b>. Height could be an issue, too. Looks a gamble to me. Tight for a no-ball, too. <i>Very</i> tight. A sliver behind the line? Yes. Well, that's missing leg comfortably by the looks of it. Seamed back in and clipped the outside of the pad. Easily missing leg"
"full, driven firmly to short mid-on"
"on middle and off, defended"

"delivered from a touch wider on the crease, slides on with the angle, defended"
leans forward and blocks on off stump
"angled into the pads, clipped behind squatre"
"angled in at leg stump, 137kph, squares up Mathews a touch as he defends"
"and another! They are falling away. Prodding at a back-of-a-length delivery outside off, a very loose prod really, and the thick edge travels quickly to second slip who holds a sharp catch. Nearly took him by surprise"
"good ball, at off stump, 141kph, defended square into the off side"
"wider outside off, 143kph, left alone"
"fuller, good carry from a full length, de Kock takes it at head height"

"tossed up outside off, driven to mid-off"
"touch short outside off, driven from the back foot through the off side...nicely put away"
"on the stumps, defended on the back foot"
"down the pitch, but given lbw! Used his feet, looked to whip to the leg side, it was very full and struck the back pad. De Silva calls for the <B>review</b>. Misses the inside edge. Is it outside the line of off stump? Umpire's call on contact and smashing off stump. Tucker the umpire"
"back of a length at off stump, 140kph, defended with a hop to the off side and for a moment there was uncertainty over the calling"
"on a length outside off, 142kph, left alone"
"pushed way down the leg side, occasionally one of those slips out"
"wild drive outside off, edged and gone! They are falling in heap. That's a poor shot. Not footwork, reaching way outside his body and it's a graze through to the keeper. Not good from a senior batsmam"

"nips back off a full length, zips past the inside edge and takes it high on back leg"
"full outside off, 120kph, leaves alone"

"wider outside off, left alone"
flicks a full delivery to mid-on
"pitches in the rough, he leaves it alone and it spins back significantly but is well wide of the stumps"

"back of a length outside off, played through the covers"
"round the wicket, an appeal for lbw as Herath falls across the crease...angling towards middle and leg, perhaps high as well"
"even bigger appeal! This looked closer, but no <b>review</B> from Faf. Yes, angling down the leg side again. Hard to get an lbw round the wicket. Shaving leg stump says the replay"
"full, defended"
"wider outside off, he plays back and it slides off the face to backward point"
"tossed up, much more air, very full outside off and driven strongly square through the off side"
defended on the front foot
flicks a straight delivery to midwicket
"wider outside off, brings a drive and this time he finds cover"
"and this time the finger goes up! Three appeals in a row from Big Vern and this one brings the decision from Dar. Sri Lanka call for the <B>review</b>. Angled in from round the wicket, defeats Herath on the inside edge again. Oh, this looks a little high. But it does look straight. It's hit above the pad flap. It's a bail-trimmer. He's gone"
"onto the front foot, pushed into the covers"
tight wicket-to-wicket line. Lakmal defends his timbers with defiance
"edged, parried, caught! Another pearler from Philander, bending into the edge from that tight line on off stump. A fizzing edge was palmed into the air by Elgar at third slip, for Amla at first to back-pedal and tidy up. This is starting to look a bit ugly"

"round the wicket, cramped for room on leg stump"
"attacking the pads once again, Tharanga can't nurdle it away"
"still targeting the pads, offering Tharanga no width to free his arms. Worked for the single to midwicket"
"whoops! Well, that leg-stump line has done the trick, though not in conventional fashion. Kumara shoulders arms to a ball that swings in and it's timber! That is up there with one of the great misjudgments of all time, alongside <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osM_uMsl6U8 target=new>Adam Hollioake against Warne ...</A>"
"edged, and gone! Faf gobbles up a regulation nick at second slip, and as Elgar and Cook hurtle off the field, it is apparent that <strong>South Africa will bat again!</strong>"

"outside off, through to the keeper"
"beaten again, leaping past the outside edge as Elgar is lured"
worked into the leg side
"edged, and safe, through the cordon and away to the rope. He was aiming to leg, took a leading edge, and third slip couldn't react in time"
attacking the top of off. Pushed firmly back down the ground
"low full toss, worked back to the bowler"
"round the wicket, raps the pads, a decent shout even though the angle looked to be taking it down leg. Either way, Mathews has <B>reviewed</B>. Sure enough, passing harmlessly by. Another wasted effort"
solid defence
Elgar is setting up his tent and wants to stay the night
"short, harmless. Semi-duck. Kind of like a moorhen"
"tapped into the leg side, to complete a dominant day for South Africa"

"this is wider, trying to get the yorker in, squeezed through the leg side...this didn't pitch, either"

"on a length, wide outside off, left alone"
"full at middle and off, he's recovered his length a little, dug out to the covers"

through to the keeper
"full at off stump, good length, brings Amla forward and he defends to point"
defended into the leg side
"got him! That's a beauty and it's a duck for Amla. Well, well. Pitches on off stump, curves away off a good length and nicks the outside edge. Perfect from Lakmal."

"tossed up, not much turn but Duminy judges it well and shoulders arms outside off"
"floated up in the channel, stroked through the covers coming forwards"
"that's a nice way to go to fifty, slightly short but Elgar still has to roll the wrists and get his cut away behind point, the ball trundles away to the rope and the SA opener raises his bat for the third time in this match"
tossed up on off stump and cautiously let through
"shortish, worked off the body into the leg side"
dug in back of a length and Elgar nudges another single through square leg
"teasing line, extra bounce for Pradeep, takes the edge... but the ball <b>flies between keeper and slip</b> before skittering to the boundary! Nice bit of bowling but no reward, Pradeep throws back his head. Neither Chandimal nor Karunaratne moved"
"the nip-backer this time, Duminy realises late, struck on the pads... and given! Duminy will however <b>review</b> Rod Tucker's decision, and it is shown to be a good decision, the bounce taking the ball well over the top of off stump, according to Hawk-Eye. Duminy wanted to leave, I think, before bringing the bat down late, pad then bat - but the extra juice at Newlands has saved him as Tucker's decision is <b>overturned</b>"
"length ball on the stumps, dabbed down into the leg side"
"pitched up, gets him coming forwards again but Duminy knows his angles better on the front foot and spanks another drive wide of mid-off for four more. Eventful over"

"in the channel, good length and left alone"
"teasing line outside off, shaping away a fraction and again Duminy abstains"
"hangs out another fourth-stump tempter, nothing doing"
"fractionally shorter, excellent line from Pradeep but Duminy is keen to atone for the previous over, it seems, and shoulders arms again"
"over the wicket, tossed up and swept through square leg for one"
"flighted, around middle and off, comes forward to push one through mid-on"
"beaten in the flight, edged and taken - Herath does the trick almost immediately! Lovely stuff, futile as it may be, he got the ball to dip and then bounce, no turn which took it straight on to clip the outside edge as Elgar tried to close the face. Would have been a stumping candidate, too, had he missed it"
"goes round the wicket, tossed up and straightening on off, du Plessis blocks"
"gives it some air, dipping on off and defended once again"
"ooh, nearly does Faf, too, gets him driving but not quite to the pitch, flashes briefly in the air past diving extra cover and they pick up the single to get du Plessis on the scoreboard"
"Pradeep trundles down and shapes one away in the channel, left alone"
"oof, that's a sweet nut, jagging away from back of a length as du Plessis feels for it, whistles past the outside edge"

"tight lines from Pradeep, maybe able to leave on length as it zips through"

"drifting in on the stumps, this one is tucked to leg for a single"
"over the wicket to Duminy, pushed through and defended on off"
flatter trajectory and again he comes forward to block
"tossed up a little slower, Duminy gets out and smothers the ball"
"quicker delivery, angled in towards middle and off, clipped briskly towards mid-on"
"shortish in the channel and guided softly down to third man, du Plessis playing a controlled dab with an open bat face... and that takes the <b>SA lead past 400</b>. Plump"
"good length outside off, not much du Plessis can do without risk, so he leaves"
"straighter line, 132kph/82mph and blocked into the leg side"
"good length in the corridor, Faf again shoulders arms"
"line and length outside off, happy to leave"
again Faf watches a length ball through outside off
tossded up and defended coming forwards on off stump
"skips out to drive and that is neatly placed, past mid-off and it races away, Kumara, I think, goes barrelling into the boundary boards in a vain attempt to prevent four"
"floated up, Duminy comes forward again, clips one through mid-on"
"tossed up on the stumps, du Plessis works a few more away off his pads"

"length ball, drifting in and blocked to the on side as Faf moves across"
"fourth-stump line, snaking through to the keeper as du Plessis leaves alone"
"shortish, 132kph outside off, du Plessis steers it away through point for one"
"here comes du Plessis, attempting to give it some licks, he smashes a drive into the ground, extra cover can't cling on to the bump ball and they trot one"
tossed up and blocked on the move
"tossed up, Duminy comes out and strokes one more through mid-on"
"slightly quicker, this bounces up to hit the splice as du Plessis reaches out for it"
"fore! And four... Golf swing from Faf, well sighted and he smokes the ball back over Herath's head"
"pushed through quicker on the stumps, nurdled into the leg side"
"touch back of a length in the channel outside off, Faf drops the hands"
"shortish, width for du Plessis to rip the hands through a back-foot drive, picks out backward point"
"diligent stuff from Lakmal, left alone in the corridor"
angled in a little straighter and du Plessis nudges into a gap at midwicket
"fired in full, trapped in front - given! Was Duminy asking for the review? It appears Rod Tucker has told him he was too late, so he heads off, soon to be followed by the rest of the players as that is <b>lunch</b>. Another cracking ball from Lakmal, pitched in line with leg (so SA saved from wasting a review) and would have made a mess off the timbers. Something for SL to savour over their repast"
"on a length outside off, left alone...that finishes the over from before lunch"
"round the wicket, driven off the back foot into the covers"
"forward on off stump, defended"
"touch straighter, blocked"
"direct hit from mid-off and he's gone! He used his feet, drove straight to the fielder and sprinted off. Oh boy, the bat is in the air as it crossed the crease. He'll be gone! His attempt to dive forced his hand into the ground, which made the the bat lift in the air as he crossed the crease. It wasn't grounded at any point"
this time Faf drives towards mid-off who is deeper on this occasion
"full outside off, tempts an expansive drive, comes off a thick inside edge as the bat twists in his hand...suspect de Kock won't hang around"

"uses his feet, flicks down to long-on"
deflects a straight delivery to the off side
"tossed wider outside off, he comes down the pitch and drives to cover"
"this time he goes over the leg side, a free swing of the arms, taking the ball from outside off wide of long-on"
"he wanted to charge again, but Herath bowled this a touch flatter, in the end he steered into the point area"
"he's timing it well at the moment, drives a full delivery from outside off along the ground through cover and wide of long-off"

pushed into the off side
back of a length and heaved dismissively through midwicket with a cross bat
"round the wicket, a bouncer over leg stump, he ducks"
"full at the stumps, 142kph, driven to mid-off"
another bouncer which loops over Philander's back
works this delivery off his hip through square leg
"full at off stump, driven to cover"
"that's a crunching straight drive, middles it into the non-striker's stumps...costs him boundary"
tucks a full delivery into midwicket
opens the face and pushes a full ball to deep point
"length delivery, gets an inside edge into his pads as he plays forward"
"full outside off, left alone"
"Kumara charges in and hits a splice-jarring length, blocked into the leg side"

"dug in short, ungainly swing and a miss from Maharaj"
"another bumper, veering down the leg side as Maharaj again fails to make contact with it"
"short ball, goes for the hook... and he lands it in the stands! Slightly top-edgy but Maharaj gave it some welly and the ball sailed all the way"
"full and straight, swings and misses - how has that missed? No bat on it, either, as Chandimal scoops up the catch. Must have faded past leg stump"
"length ball on the stumps, Philander squeezes out a single through backward square leg"
"fullish in the channel, Maharaj steps out and opens the face to steer through point"
"beats him in the channel... and Lakmal has his arms in the air, repeating 'How was that?' somewhat tiredly. Rod Tucker shakes his head but Angelo Mathews, perhaps out of sympathy for his attack-leading workhorse, decides to <b>review</b>. Philander appears to be shaking his head, confident he didn't edge it - and Ultra Edge backs him up, not a murmur on the graph. On we go"
"pitched up and <i>smashed</i> down the ground, just clearing mid-on! Philander skipped out to meet it, narrowing the angle, rifling a shot over the leaping fielder and <b>taking SA's lead above 500</b>"
"attempted yorker becomes a full bunger, clipped firmly through deep midwicket and away for four more - and that's it, Faf waves them in: <b>South Africa have declared</b>, Philander marches off with his dander up, ready to take the new ball"
"round the wicket, starts very wide and Karunaratne gratefully ignores it"
"ooh, that's a much better line, coming back in menacingly at 136kph/84mph as Karu gets a stride in, inches wide of the woodwork"
"length ball, angled in on the stumps, deflected through square leg to get the scoreboard ticking"
"goes over the wicket and loses his line down the leg side, brushes the pad on its way through"
"good length on off, Kaushal prods forward around his pad to dab it back to the bowler"
"length outside off, 135kph and the batsman beadily watches it through, peeking out from under his helmet"
"round the wicket, slanting in but not enough to make Karunaratne play. Tsk"
"straighter line, slides down the leg side as Karu flicks and misses"
"comes across and plays to leg again, this time he gets a firm connection, short leg thought he might be in business but the ball zips away in front of square"
"good length and tailing in from wide of the stumps once more, Karunaratne judges it well and leaves"
"this one ducks away, only 128kph/79mph but seductive nonetheless, wide enough to leave"
"woof, beats the inside edge and misses the top of off! Philander bends this one back in and practically kippers Karu, who knew very little about it as the ball winged through into de Kock's gloves"
"overpitched, too straight and Silva skelps it through midwicket, a neat leg glance and he's off the mark with a boundary"
"better line, outside off and Silva thinks about dabbing at it, withdraws the bat"
"touch wide, holding its line in the channel, a more confident leave from Kaushal"
"trying to straighten this on the stumps, slightly leg side as it thumps into the pads"
another corridor-botherer left alone
"length ball, Silva comes forward on off stump to block"
"that's Vern's money line, angling in to the left-hander to strike the knee roll... think this one was heading down past leg, though"
"streaky runs for Karu, drawn forward and poking at the in-ducker, takes the inside edge and runs through backward square leg to get him away from the danger end"
"off-stump line, Silva is batting out of his crease and covers the gentle swing as the ball thuds into the splice of the bat"
"fullish and driven, the bat turning in the hands as Faf runs across from extra cover and dives in an attempt to cut it off"
"oof, that's hit him in the crackers! Could have been a nasty blow, Philander bringing the ball back in, past the inside edge again... but Karu stands tall, breathes deeply and is ready to go again"
"angled in on the stumps, defended solidly"
comes across to defend on off stump
"good length, slightly wide of the stumps and Silva is happy to leave"
"tighter line and Silva dabs at this with an open face, steered to gully - and he had his bat safely back in as the throw bounced past the stumps"
"in two minds here, attempting to leave and then thick-edging on to his front pad as he tried to withdraw the bat late"
"good length on off, blocked"
comes across and shows a length ball the full face of the bat
flies through from slightly back of a length outside off
"Philander switches to over the wicket, touch short and straight and Karunaratne stays back, tucks it to leg"
"still a little short and this is leg side, flick and a miss from Karu"
"pushed across the bows, in the corridor and holding its line, no stroke"
"does him this time, struck on the back pad... high? No, there was an inside edge as Karunaratne pushed forwards"
"gottim, leg stump cartwheels back! Philander pumps his fists as Karunaratne tucks his bat under his arm and walks off without a backward glance. The pressure was too great, he was looking to drive but beaten by the inswing, a thick inside edge taking it back into the timber - loose stroke, certainly, but Philander had earned it for a thorough working over"
"slides this one down the leg side, nothing on Silva's flick"
"good length a foot or so outside off, arms gladly shouldered"
"in the air, but in front of short leg! Not the most composed of flicks from Silva but he gets the ball away past midwicket for a couple"
"lovely shape on this, swerving in and then out, Silva watches it closely and lifts his bat up and out of the way"
"straighter, top of off, 134kph/83mph and defended with soft hands coming forwards"
tight lines and again he plays it late and down into the ground by his feet
"over the wicket, good-length on off, Mendis gets a stride in and blocks solidly"
"full outside off, comes forward to drive, off the bottom half of the bat"
"shaping a fraction away outside off, Mendis shoulders arms"
"pitched up and gets him driving - but Kusal is confident behind the wheel, despite being just a kid, and he slaps four in front of point, in the air but landing safely before pressing the accelerator to the rope"
booming away swing from Philander but the length was a touch short and Mendis could watch it veering off as he shouldered arms
"full of a length on off, Mendis steps out to block firmly - and that will be <b>tea</b>, with SA well on top in pursuit of a series-sealing win"
"full outside off, good response from Silva as he gets forward and pushes firmly through the covers"
"full on the pads, flicks it in the air for a while but short of the man in front of square. He loves that flick and often plays it uppishly"

pushed down the leg side
"down the leg side again, just trying to get is radar functioning"
"full at middle and off, defended into midwicket"
"well bowled, full at middle, straightens and takes a thick outside edge through point"
"full at off stump, positive response as he gets forward and drives it straight of mid-off...chased down by Maharaj and a fine effort to flick it back. Does really well"
"edged, caught at third slip! Easy as you like, really. A tempting length, full outside off but not a half volley, Mendis can't resist the drive on the up and the thick edge is taken at chest height"
"very full outside off, punched very sweetly back to the bowler who then hurls the ball back towards the batsman"
"short outside off, he arches his back and drops his gloves"
"nicely bowled, back of a length at off stump, enough late shape to take the thick outer part of the part but goes to ground"
flicked off the pads to long leg
"extravagant bounce from a full length, de Kock takes it above his head"
"goes for the yorker, it's on target, but dug out through midwicket off a decent chunk of bat"
"an appeal for a catch down the leg side, there was a noise but they don't review when Dar says not out. Paddy rather than a woody flick. Easily missed the edge"
"back outside off, defended on the front foot"
"just over short leg. Nips back off a full length, but doesn't actually taken an inside edge. All thigh guard"
"finds the edge, good length at off stump, Silva trying to get forward. Played with soft hands"
"in control this time, carefully forward into a full ball and pushes through the off side"
"a late decision to leave, has to whip the bat quickly above his head, nipped back off the seam"
"and now this one swings away. Lovely, skillful bowling. Missed the edge by quite a long way, Silva did well not to feel for it. Doesn't carry to de Kock, either"
"beaten again! He has it on a string at the moment. Starting just outside off, Silva knows he has to cover for the one that comes back. Does well not to push away from the body"
and another! An over of the utmost class from Philander. This nips away late off the seam and scoots past the outside edge
"full, pushed down the leg side...not the accuracy of Philander at the moment"
"and he's drawn into a very wild drive, feet didn't go anywhere, playing miles away from his body and almost edged it"

"full at off stump, defended to the covers"

left alone

"keeps it in the area just outside off, left alone"
"round the wicket, full and straight, driven into the off side"
"full outside off, he leans forward and defends"
down the pitch and into the stands! He's not holding back. Takes a stride down then lofts through the line and sends the ball straight back over the bowler's head
"fuller, flatter, defended"
touch shorter outside and that's a lovely piece of timing as he punches it square through the off side
defended on the front foot

"short, very wide outside off, no danger"
"full on middle, defended"
"delivered from a touch wider on the crease, played to cover"
"an appeal, mostly from the bowler, as Silva basically pads this away...not much of a shot offered. Height, perhaps, went in his favour. Surprised the appeal was a bit bigger. Well over the stumps"
"fuller, defended"
"down the pitch, driven to mid-off"
"he's down again and lofts this clean over mid-off, a nice confident strike. One bounce over the rope"
"good length, fairly wide of the stumps and left alone"
"banged in, Silva fends at the ball, it lobs to short leg - up goes the finger! He doesn't review and replays confirm is came off the glove, SA chip out another, Silva's dogged resistance brought to an end. The delivery rose brutishly from back of a length and it was all he could do to get his hands in the way of his face"
"not like that! Mathews is beaten first ball, one nipping away off a length but he didn't help himself by wafting rather louchely at it outside off"
"shortish and at the body, Mathews hops across and plays this down safely to leg"

"tighter to the off stump, back of a length and blocked"

No review from de Silva, though it looked a bit leg side to me... and Hawk-Eye quickly shows that it was missing leg stump by a distance, not even umpire's call - but by now de Silva has practically crossed the rope! Shockers all round but Rabada has another and SL are four down"

"here he is, the Kurunegala Lara! Stand-and-deliver larrup from Herath, crunching Rabada's length ball meatily back over mid-on and away"
not quite got this one right... but it clears mid-on running back! Beaten for pace and he spooned his shot over the man on the ring
"banged in short, Kumara flinches out of the way"
"angled in on the stumps, Kumara gets across to block"
"pitched up further, draws him across and clips the outside edge but it runs low through backward point for a single"
"floated up outside off, tapped away on the front foot"
"given some air... and given some tap, Kumara down on one knee to swing a muscular blow through midwicket"
"on the charge this time, couple of steps out and bludgeoned over mid-on, Kumara bending his back with the bat after his first-innings heroics with the ball"
tossed up and defended watchfully this time
"pushed through and there's some turn as Kumara props forward, gap between bat and pad and it clips the inside edge, bobbles through the batsman's legs"
"beaten on the outside this time, going on with the arm into de Kock's gloved mitts"
"nearly flubbed to point! Bit of a loosener from Vern and Herath swung at it, toe-ended but dropping just short of Bavuma"
comes across and lets this one go outside off
"bowling round the wicket, angled in and steered to point, who then attempts an ambitious shy at the non-striker's end"
"veering in at late 120s kph, Herath gets bet behind prod into the leg side"
"fuller, in the channel, Herath steers it through the covers and although Kumara has to get a bit of a wriggle on to reach his ground for a second, the throw isn't great"
"length ball, slogged into the leg side - or perhaps flapped is the more appropriate description, though it lands safely in a gap"
now he rolls out the reverse-sweep! Full outside off and Herath switches the bat around to shovel four to third man
tossed up and defended on the front foot
"flighted and then clubbed, four more through square leg! Herath is in banking mode, cashing whatever he can get his hands on, this time dropping to one knee and swatting slightly aerially but square of deep midwicket"
"Maharaj goes round the wicket and has immediate (moral) success, drifting an arm ball past the outside edge"
big appeal as de Kock claims a catch that had looped up off the front pad... Was there any bat/glove? The umpire doesn't think so
worked off the stumps through the leg side to keep the strike
"pitched up on middle and off, gets doughtily into line"
"driven ambitiously on the up, carved over cover point, in the air but no one's there - the Herath carnival of batting rumbles on!"
dug in short and this time he swivel-pulls through midwicket for one
"good length on off, Kumara stabs at it and manages to thick-edge towards gully"
"back of a length, gun-barrel straight and wide enough for Kumara to happily shoulder arms"
Philander aims for the top of off - but it's stoutly blocked once more. These two have so far added the third-highest partnership of the innings. Make of that what you will
"floated up on the stumps from round the wicket, Herath blocks. He's not going anywhere, not while he's having this much fun"
"flatter, nudged off the pads towards short leg on the bounce"
"pushed through outside off, Herath shuffles over and taps it away"
"flighted, Herath sweeps aggressively again, short leg takes evasive action... but deep square keeps them to one"
"gottim, stumped on the charge, SL nine down! Maharaj might have seen him coming, fired through wide of off stump as Kumara made room to try and flay through the covers, de Kock snaffled it and finished the job in a blink"
"full on off, leans into a front-foot block"
"shortish, outside off, Herath rises up on his tippy toes and dabs one in front of square"
"goes over the wicket, targeting the top of off, Pradeep gets into line"
shuffles across and blocks another with a straight bat
"wah-wee, too good for thee! Philander bends a peach of a ball into off stump and then away, past Pradeep's groping bat"
"angled in, no swing this time, turned to the leg side"
"pitched up and Pradeep decides to try and punch his way out, slogged towards long-on... and the top edge ends up at third man. One of those"
"four more, a full toss from Maharaj and Herath belts it away through midwicket. Rangana into the 30s"
"nearly a mix up, as Herath steers the ball to backward point, Pradeep had come three-quarters of the way down and had to be sent back - but Amla threw to the wrong end"
"flighted outside off, brings out the reversey-percy again, swept through point for one"
"round the wicket and tossed up, takes the outside edge but runs wide of slip"
"floated up around the line of off, Pradeep lunges forward"
tossed up and blocked coming forwards once again
short of a length and Herath nearly pulls himself off his feet swiping wide of mid-on
"length ball on middle and off, an inside edge runs through square leg"
"goes round the wicket again, full outside off and driven towards mid-off, not timed"
"bangs the ball in short and Herath pulls with gusto once more, takes the single to deep midwicket"
"shortish, on the body, defended down to the on side"
"bowled 'im, off stump pegged back! Philander finishes it, <b>South Africa win by 282 runs</b> and take the series with a Test to play"
