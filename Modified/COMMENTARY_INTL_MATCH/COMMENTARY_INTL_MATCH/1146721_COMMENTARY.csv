"oh dear! Mushfiqur Rahim perishes in the final over. With eight to get, the set batsman is gone. Shades of World T20 2016 in Bangalore. A full toss that slips out of the hand and Mushfiqur swats it straight into the hands of deep midwicket. Hardly a delivery that deserves a wicket but that's fortune for you"
"good delivery. Toeing the line but just inside it as he fires it wide outside off, making the batsman reach out as he misses"
