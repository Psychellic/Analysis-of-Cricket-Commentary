"back of length delivery that shapes into middle and leg, Dickwella looks to work it behind square. Deflects off the thigh pad and it's a leg bye to start"
"plays outside the line of that length ball that holds its line on middle, hit high on the pad. They take a run off the deflection again"
"clever change of pace. Bowls a knuckleball as he sees Dickwella charge down the pitch to slap this over cover, missed it completely. He shortened his length just a touch as well"
"length ball sliding down leg, Dickwella lends direction to Bhuvi's pace, runs down to fine leg"
defends this incoming delivery from the crease to short cover. Should've looked to push forward
floats this length ball across the left-hander who bunts it gently to the off side. Tight first over from Bhuvneshwar
"banged in short, gets this to rise from mid-pitch, Tharanga works this off his hip to fine leg"
"slower length ball on middle, defended to the off side"
"this is the kind of whip that made Jayasuriya quite a rage in the 1990s. Length on middle and he simply whips this nonchalantly to the square leg boundary. Change of pace again, he picked it well"
"ah, beautiful. This is the shot of the Dilshan kind. Walks across, uses the pace of the bowler and paddles this wide of MS Dhoni. Beats short fine leg quite comfortably"
"And again! He's brave, has no trace of worry. Down on one knee as he gets outside off and lap sweeps this length ball over short fine leg again"
"this time he nearly chops on. The thick inside edge runs down towards deep fine leg. Axar was haring in from the ropes, but Dickwella is very quick to turn back for the second"
"why would you bowl a short delivery at 130kph? Or try to, rather? Someday I'll find out. Tharanga helps this over midwicket. Swiveled back and pulled that away without much fuss."
"much better. Super comeback. <b> The old Bhuvi swing </b> that has been missing all series raises its head, finally, on the last day of tour. He gets this to bend back in from middle, Tharanga plays outside the line of the delivery as the ball snakes back in and deflects off the pad and clatters into the stumps"
"simple extension of his arms as he belts this through the line into the cover boundary. Nothing wrong with the delivery, this time. Length, just outside off, and he put that away so easily. Should give him immense confidence"
"shoots a bouncer on middle and leg, Munaweera ducks under that one"
"he's hoicked this from outside off to the square leg fence. This was a knuckleball from Bhuvi, too short. Enough time to pick that away"
gets on top of the bounce and works this incoming short of length delivery to Bumrah at short fine for a quick single
"What a welcome. Tossed up gently on off, Munaweera makes room and lofts this inside-out over extra cover. That flew off his blade"
too much flight again and he's belted this straight over his head. This lands closer to the sightscreen. Straight as a dye. Long-off moved to deep extra cover. So he moves further outside leg and blasts this away
"this is an in-drifter that skids on, deflects off the pad to short third man. Would've missed leg."
"full on middle and leg, worked to deep midwicket"
another quicker delivery that slides back in to hit him high on the pad as he looks to work this to the leg side
another skiddy delivery that comes back in to cramp him for room as he looks to work this to the leg side. Hit on the pad.
"makes room, Bumrah follows him and digs in a length ball outside leg. Pushed to Kohli at cover"
"full and straight on leg stump, flicked to midwicket"
"gives him a send-off with claps. Dickwella has paid the price for being too cheeky. Looked to guide this away-going delivery past short third man, but the initial movement was to paddle that away. Bumrah saw the late adjustment before he delivered, and yet angled it across from wide of the crease. Dickwella missed it altogether as the off stump took a walk."
gets onto his toes and steers this down to third man
"attempted yorker, turns out to be a low full toss, driven straight to extra cover"
"excellent bouncer, angled into middle and leg from wide of the crease, this one zips past his ears"
dart first ball and that's been put away. Mathews gets across the stumps and tickles this to the fine leg boundary
"much fuller, on middle and leg, turned to the vacant midwicket region"
"whips this from length, no chance for Jadhav at deep midwicket. This was angled into the pads, he used the depth of the crease to find the spot."
"backs away to blast that away over cover, Axar shortened his length and nearly had a wicket. <b> Thick inside edge to short fine leg. </b>"
"this is superb from Munaweera. Looked out of sorts in the ODIs, but the shortest format has galvanised him. Steps out, gets to the pitch of the ball and lofts this with the spin over mid-off"
"fired full outside off, he backs away and gives it a good whack. KL Rahul throws himself to his left at cover and pulls off a one-handed stop. Stunning."
"drifts this into the pads, worked to deep midwicket"
"steps out and drives with the spin to long-off. If Chahal was slightly taller, he would've been able to stop that"
"he's almost always right when he appeals. He's done this so many times that these stumpings appear very normal for him. Fact is it was tremendous piece of glove work. Credit to Chahal as well, who drew him forward with the flight and then got this to spin past the outside edge on the drive. The back foot dragged outside the crease and may have been on the line when the bails came off. Correct decision in the end."
"lovely in-drifter from wide of the crease, Priyanjan lunges forward and deadbats that"
driven into the gap at cover for an easy single
"touch short, he cuts this away towards deep point off the front foot"
"spins back into middle and leg, defended off the back foot to short midwicket"
wrong'un which he lunges forward to defend. Read this off the pitch
"steps out to work this wide of midwicket but can't get any bat on it. Got into a tangle, hit on the pad."
"another googly, this time he's caressed this wide of cover as they take an easy single"
cracker of a googly. Landed this outside off and got this to go away further. Beaten
"punched back down the ground, past Kuldeep"
"this is a sensational stroke, inside-out over deep extra cover. Skipped down the pitch, didn't get to the pitch of the ball but went through with the stroke, with the spin. Ah, so good to watch. Great connection. Sailed away"
"looked to slog, but ended up just delicately bunting this with the spin to point"
fires this way outside off. Perhaps expected the batsman to give him the charge
"shortens his length, the googly this time, worked with the spin to short fine leg. Earns appreciation from MS behind the stumps"
"touch short and just outside off, punched to mid-off"
"he's connected this beautifully. Sashays down the pitch without a trace of worry, gets underneath the flight and swings through like a golfer to deposit this into the sightscreen. What power, what timing"
"this is simply beautiful. Now he shows there's more to his game than just blind slogging. Chahal fires this short and just a touch wide, Munaweera stays inside the crease and opens the bat face late to steer this away past short third man."
"oh he's got him. Or has he? If the third umpire gave Mathews out, just for the sake of consistency, he should be giving this. Jeez, I wouldn't want to be Raveendra Wimalasiri though. Game of millimetres. <b> Given not out this time. </b> He was drawn forward, the googly spun past the outside edge. The backfoot was dragged out, just somehow managed to bring it back to life as he tried to get back. Just in by absolute inches."
gets forward and works this with the spin to short midwicket
"beaten by the wrong'un. Flatter, he had no clue"
chops this attempted cut to short third man
"the big shot was coming, this time he's pulled him for six. Too short, he picked the length up early and put this away over deep midwicket"
"fired full on the stumps, squeezed back to the bowler"
"short and coming in to middle and leg, whipped to deep backward square leg. <b> Maiden T20I fifty </b>"
"rocks back to cut, gets a thick outside edge past short third man. Kuldeep does well"
"walks across the stumps to paddle, Axar follows him and tosses it up outside off, he still goes through with the shot, only to get a thick outside edge to short third man"
"Pandey hares across from deep cover to deep point, stops that rasping cut shot. This was too short"
lands just short of deep square leg. Pulled this with the angle. Wonder if Kuldeep misjudged it and was late to come in from the ropes
"skids one back into middle, bunted towards midwicket"
"looks to slog, manages to only squeeze this back past the bowler, to long-off"
"<b> he's lost his bat and is bowled as well. </b>This was a shortish delivery on middle from Kuldeep, stopped on him just a little. He went to pull, tried to really hit this hard. Sweaty gloves, perhaps. The bat slipped out of his hand, needing square leg to be completely aware of what was happening. The off stump took a gentle knock"
"sees this ball in the slogging zone and belts this to long-on, flat hit"
forced off the front foot to Kohli at cover
"goes onto the backfoot, makes room and cuts to deep cover"
"this short ball takes ages to spin away. Thisara was through with the pull even before the ball arrived. It kept low as well, through to Dhoni"
right onto the back foot as he blocks
"chops this cut to short third man, as they scamper a single"
slaps this full and flat delivery on off stump to long-off
"lunges forward to drive, gets a thick inside edge back to Axar"
"chipped over the infield to wide long-off, good work  by Jadhav"
toe-ends an across-the-line slog to long-on
<b> Jadhav dives over the ball at point </b> to concede the extra run. Comical dive too. This wasn't cut all that hard.
"if it's in the arc, he'll hit it out of the park. Okay, sorry. Right in the swinging arc, Thisara muscles this way over long-on. Dragged it just a little but it didn't matter. Massive hit"
"played on! Chahal has his revenge again. This was a touch short but didn't  have the room for Thisara to cut that hard, completely cramped for room as he could only chop back onto the stumps"
sensational delivery from Chahal. Spun back in to bounce over the stumps. The googly sneaked through the gap between bat and pad
"sharp turn again, looks to sweep but is hit on the pad. Outside the line of the stumps, I'd imagine"
"the wrong'un has done the trick again. Completely foxed. He's been hit for sixes but that hasn't deterred him from tossing it up. Prodded outside the line of the delivery, didn't read it at all. The ball came back in to hit the pad and that would've hit top of leg."
"slider on the stumps from wide of the crease, squeezed back to the bowler"
gets outside the line of the stumps and turns this towards short fine
"big appeal for caught behind but umpire Pallyaguruge doesn't think there was an edge. Looks to drive with the spin, looks like <b> there was a big deflection. </b> No reviews, sadly."
tucked wide of square leg for an easy single
"chops this to short third man, they get across for the single"
"down on one-knee as he plays a half-pull. Yuzvendra Chahal at deep midwicket nearly trips over as he stops, somehow recovers and prevents the ball from trickling over"
"back of length on middle, defended to cover for a single. Wait, oh. They'll have a second as there's no one to back up the throw at the keeper's end."
"disconcerting bounce from length, fends this towards point as they get through. Would've been interesting had Axar scored a direct hit at the bowler's end"
bouncer but this was way over the batsman's head. Wide and it's a fair call
hustled for pace. This length ball is tucked wide of midwicket
dabs this length ball towards the man coming in from point
"incoming length ball which he looks to whip over midwicket, ends up working it more towards square leg"
"slips this length ball down leg, MS dives low to his left to stop that"
rocks back and frees his arms to cut that to deep point
takes this on the full and works this down to wide long-on
"touch short, he rocks back and pulls towards deep square where Chahal completely misjudges this.By the time he ran in, the ball was dying on him. This sneaked through to the boundary. Although he made good ground, indecision early on cost him. Bowler and captain are unhappy"
"leading edge, lobs over the bowler's head. Long-on and long-off converge to stop that"
"this is as simple as they come. Kohli, at deep midwicket, had to move no more than a couple of yards. This was a touch short, Sekkuge got no timing or power whatsoever behind that pull. Hit straight down the throat of the Indian captain."
"pulled to Kohli on the bounce at deep midwicket. Priyanjan was ball watching and so he doesn't run. Bizarre. If Kuldeep had collected the throw at the stumps, this would've been a run-out."
works this low full toss on the pads to square leg
chipped on the bounce to mid-off
"prods outside the line of that length ball, inside edge to square leg"
looks to pull but this was over his head or thereabouts. Bhuvneshwar also bowled this way outside off. Beaten
makes room and forces this length ball to the man at the edge of the ring at cover
"right into the blockhole on middle, squeezed to cover"
"too short outside off ans he's muscled over wide long-on. Picked the length, held his shape against the knuckleball and pulled that away. He's a puny man but packs a punch when he slogs"
"lofted into the gap at deep cover, they scamper back for the second"
"snakes in a yorker on middle from wide of the crease, squeezed towards midwicket"
looks to back away and flay this over cover but Bumrah shortens his length and tucks him up for room. Beaten
slapped wide of cover. Rahul comes around at sweeper cover to stop that. Got that on the top part of the bat
"stunning! The attempted yorker gone wrong. This is a half-volley, he makes room, takes it on the full and belts this between mid-off and cover."
"top-edges this pull over the keeper's head. Looked to pull over deep square, the ball skidded on to skew away. Handy runs"
"what was that? I'm sure even Priyanjan doesn't know what he's done. This length ball was angling into middle, he tried to scoop it fine, then readjusted and then played the back dink over short third man. He wasn't even looking at the ball. How brave of him to try and deflect it the other side."
"gets away with this short ball. Banged in short outside off, he was jumping inside the crease to reach the delivery. <b> Should have been called wide. </b>"
"thick edge as he's cramped for room in his attempt to back away and cut, on the bounce to Kuldeep at third man"
"low full toss outside off, eased to wide long-off"
"great shot! Too short, this was sitting up nicely at Bhuvi's pace and he's hammered this pull in front of square. Just clears the ropes. Free flow"
"backs away to go over cover, squeezed to the man at the edge of the ring instead."
"back of a length and outside off, Rohit flays it through the covers, standing tall and brandishing a high elbow"
"carves it to the point boundary. Too short, too wide, and absolutely delicious"
"brings his pace down to 76 kph, and lines it up closer to off stump. As a result, the slightest indecision produces a false stroke. Rahul tries to block, tentatively, and gets an inside edge. His partner sees the opportunity for a quick single though as the ball wanders towards square leg"
nudges a shortish delivery on middle to the right of mid-on
waits for the shortish delivery to come to him and taps it behind point for a single
"flicks it to the right of Malinga at short fine leg, and the fast bowler tumbles over the ball. Valiant effort, but he remains one of the fielders Sri Lanka try to hide and he is placed in the firing line as Mathews strays onto Rohit's pads."
"a hint of width and Rahul slashes it over point. Lovely shot. Opens the face, intentionally hits it over the top so he can evade point inside the circle because there is no one behind"
"tighter line from the new bowler Udana, and Rahul clips it to the right of mid-on"
"attempts a late cut, and the ball takes the inside edge, hits the pitch which is so hard that when the ball rebounds, it sails clean over the wicketkeeper"
"a slower ball, just outside off, Rohit slices it to third man"
"taps a short delivery, using the angle of the left-armer from over the wicket, to find a single to the right of short third man"
"slower ball, so slow that even with Rohit identifying that it was the change-up, he is nowhere near close enough to play the cut shot."
"good length ball, outside off, shaping away in the air. Rahul chops it to backward point"
"picks the slower, short ball outside off and runs it down to third man"
"seems to kick up off the pitch and the back of a length ball is defused carefully by Rohit, playing with soft hands, and yanking the bottom one off as soon as he makes contact"
"straight up, and Perera takes it moving to his left from mid-on. Colombo roars as they see Rohit walk back for single-digits. The opener tries to bully a back of a length ball over the straight field, but he underestimates the bounce on offer. Hits high on the bat and ends up a simple catch"
ushers the shortish delivery outside off to third man
"<b>ripper</b>! See if you can hit that, best batsman in the world! Malinga runs in and hits the deck with a ball that bites into the pitch and produces legcut so substantial that it squares Kohli up and beats his leading edge by a mile. Malinga smiles..."
"has the room and the length for a flowing drive to cover, but he finds the fielder"
"<b>slower ball again</b>, off the back of the hand. Rahul reads it, blocks with bat close to body. The open face helps him find a single at point"
"<b>beaten twice in a row</b>. Kohli knows he is in a contest now as a back of a length delivery, angled across him, ignores his best efforts to reach it"
swivels on the back foot to swat a short ball to deep midwicket
"there's a man sweeping on the boundary, but Rahul ensures he strikes the slower ball well to the right of the man. Fierce cut, well in front of square"
clips a full delivery on the pads to deep square leg
"gets another short ball to rise up towards Kohli's chest, but he lines up right behind it and taps it to point. Sees the opportunity for a single, and with a direct hit from Prasanna and the ball ricocheting to no-man's land, the Indian captain secures an overthrow"
length ball wanders tamely down leg
"only just clears the three men chasing it from the circle on the off side. Kohli, like Rohit before him, drives on the up at a ball that is far too short for the shot. Gets struck high on the bat and manages to evade point, cover and mid-off"
"<b>that is very tight</b> and had Prasanna hit the stumps direct with his underarm, things would have been interesting. Kohli blocks to point and wants the quick single, Rahul obliges despite the risk and gets through safely enough"
"cramps him up with a shortish ball on middle and off, Rahul pokes it to mid-on"
ensures he is on top of the shortish delivery outside off and works it away through square leg. Skillful wristwork
"turns a shortish delivery to midwicket, he has mistimed the ball so he thinks there is the chance for a single, <b>it's risky</b>, but the throw isn't on target and Kohli sprints through. This is good from Sri Lanka. They're making Kohli work so very hard for mere singles."
"late cuts from off stump, but with there being no pace on the ball, and him not adding any to it, short third man can mop up"
"drives through extra cover, moving across to the ball, so much that he gets too close to it and has to then use his wrists to get power into the shot. Kohli has to get going to make the second run"
"shifts outside leg to throw the bowler off, Prasanna bowls wide outside off, and Rahul is there waiting again, and cuts it to the sweeper"
"<b>what a wild catch, Dasun Shanaka, take a bow!</b>. Prowling at short cover, he sees the little white thing heading to him. He dives, both hands stretched out to his left and plucks it out of thin air. Up he rises, eventually, hands held aloft and soaks in the admiration of the Colombo crowd. Rahul walks away thinking about the small margins in the game, a blistering cover drive has led to his downfall"
defends a flighted delivery on off and middle
slogs a flighted delivery on middle to deep midwicket
"fullish and outside off, Pandey slices it to the sweeper"
"full and outside off, pushes it to the sweeper"
"slower ball, just outside off, Pandey steers it behind Prasanna at point. Spectacular dive, to no avail"
"back of a length and outside off, pats it to point"
"angles it into middle and let, the cramped Pandey can only send it to short midwicket."
"slower ball outside off, Pandey swings at it hard, utterly losing his shape and is lucky the inside edge doesn't roll off his pad and onto the stumps"
"races down the track and dismisses a length ball into the sightscreen. Gets close enough to the ball, if not right to the pitch, and swings his arms through the line"
"hangs back, expecting the change in length, but this is a really quick ball. 87 kph. Kohli only just about manages to cut to third man"
stays legside of the length ball and lashes it out to the sweeper
"charges out of his crease, but the tossed up delivery is too wide, and it dips as well, just enough to make Pandey lose his shape and slog to long-on"
"fires in the googly, and Kohli, rocking back, pulls it hard to deep midwicket."
hacks at the straight one outside off and misses it completely. [Replays show there is an inside edge] So does Dickwella who doesn't stay low enough.
"short and outside off to start with as the legbreak goes wrong, the batsman pulls to deep midwicket"
"straying on his pads and Kohli, by pulling his front leg back has all the room he needs to whip it to deep midwicket"
spots the quicker ball outside off and Kohli slices it fine enough that short third man becomes little more than an usher. Puts pace on it as well to make sure it flies
"full and outside off, Kohli yanks it out to deep midwicket"
shifts outside leg to punch a good length ball off the stumps to deep cover
"tossed up, drifts in and Kohli sends it scurrying to deep midwicket"
"short-armed pull to the backward square leg boundary. It's the length that helps him pull this off - short - but it is right over middle stump so despite the lack of room, Kohli manages to power it away. Such strong wrists"
"back of a length and outside off, drills it to the extra cover boundary. But he has to beat the man inside the circle, does so to his left, he has to bisect the sweeper and the long-off, does so. Precision mark"
"legcutter outside off, Kohli looms over it and turns it to long-on"
"another legcutter on off stump, Pandey forces it to long-off"
"drives a full delivery outside off to the left of long-off. Kohli wants two, but his partner disagrees"
"picks the short ball and pummels it to the deep midwicket boundary. The fielder there puts in a valiant effort, moving to his right and putting in the dive, but with Prasanna standing a fair way inside the fence, he has no chance"
"skips down the track, but in doing so he is too close to the ball on leg stump. No matter, Kohli's wrists generate the power anyway and it needs a desperate dive from Perera at long-on to stop the boundary"
presses forward to a loopy delivery outside off and pushes it through cover
launches a legbreak out to long-on
"shortish and outside off, punches it to deep point"
"the googly is short and Pandey, reading it, shifts back, opens his hips and pulls viciously to deep midwicket"
"shortish and outside off, punches it to cover, and with Prasanna misfielding, Kohli runs across and retains strike"
"that's outstanding timing! The backlift is high, the bat comes down a blur, the wrists give it power and long-on is just being picked on. How is he meant to stop this?"
"good length ball outside off, steers it to third man"
"slower ball.... but it disappears over long-off. Just enough width for Pandey to free the arms, and crucially, he chooses an area without a boundary rider. Mid-off was up"
"short and wide outside off, Pandey, even as he is making room, reaches out to strike the ball and it has the magic touch to get to the boundary at point"
"comes charging, and so the bowler targets his pads, and Pandey nearly trips over himself as he flicks to deep midwicket"
walks at a length ball and works it to deep midwicket
"has to reach out with the legbreak placed well wide outside off. Kohli slaps it to cover, who misfields"
pulls out the inside out cover drive to bring up fifty. Outstanding innings. Paced perfectly. Sprinkled with outrageous shots
comes down the track and hammers a flighted delivery outside off to the long-off boundary
nudges it to deep midwicket and has hits it soft enough to find a couple. But he still has to motor - he does and even beats a direct hit. The stamina he has is unbelievable
"they try to hide the ball, but doing so means they stray too wide outside off"
"spears it into leg stump, Kohli stands tall and crunches it to the right of long-on"
stays back to cut a pretty full ball and as a result gets only an inside edge
"full toss, outside off, and it peels away to deep cover off a one-handed drive"
"back of the hand slower ball, Pandey clips it to short fine leg."
"steps out, and Udana digs it in near his own half of the wicket and the ball soars over the batsman, and the wicketkeeper."
"races down to the left-armer, having figured out 80% of his balls is slow and pastes it to long-off. Kohli is panting. He looks tired. But he's still running at full tilt"
"back of a length and outside off, Pandey tries to split third man and point, but there is just not enough pace on the ball to succeed"
"wanders out of his crease again, adjusts his momentum seeing the change-up ball, and slides it to backward point"
"full and outside off, Pandey clips it between deep midwicket and long-on and secures the couple he had intended to find."
"shortish and outside off, Kohli works it through midwicket"
"full and outside off, taps it to mid-off's left"
"good length ball, doesn't turn on off stump, so Kohli dabs it to short third man"
"pats a shortish delivery to long-on, concentrating only on placement. India are cruising this"
<b>beaten</b> as he pokes at a legbreak without moving his feet appropriately
"short ball, doesn't quite rise on leg stump, so Kohli uses a straight bat to maximise contact, hammering it to deep midwicket"
"tries to slice a yorker through point, but the ball sneaks under his bat outside off"
walks at the full delivery outside off and pushes it to extra cover
blocks the yorker outside off and finds a single at point
"looks to hit the blockhole outside off, Kohli, standing on leg stump, wanting room to free up the off side, throws his hands at the ball and gets a thick edge to third man"
"<b>umpire killer</b>! And Palliyaguruge does extremely well to drop to the floor! Boy, that was sooo ruddy close.  They need helmets. They certainly need helmets when bludgeons like this come straight at them. Kohli sees a half-volley, sees red and sends it racing to the long-on boundary. Phew, that could have gone so ugly."
nudges it calmly to long-on to retain strike
"tosses it up outside off, drives through extra cover"
gets inside the line and drives the flighted legbreak on off stump to long-off
whips a full delivery outside leg to the right of long-on
drives to long-off
"shortish and outside off, dabs it to short third man"
down the track to slog a full toss outside off to long-on
"full and outside off, spears it to the sweeper"
"full toss outside off, Kohli steers it to the sweeper. He wants two, but Pandey yells 'wait, wait, wait, wait' and holds his ground. Good call. Right call."
"tries to beat backward point, slicing the yorker so very well, but just misses out."
"full toss, swings down leg as Kohli tries to pull. He doesn't make contact, the swing takes it too far from Dickwella. <b>Called no-ball for overstepping</b> and we will have a <b>free hit next ball</b>"
"full and outside off, drills it to extra cover, but only for a single and Kohli is fiercely upset. Yells at himself, then smashes his bat down on his pads. Lesson in batting. Lesson in self-immolation"
"full and outside off, runs it down to deep third man"
take a half-volley outside off and instead of doing the most logical thing - slamming it over the covers - Kohli whips it to the midwicket boundary with a whirl of his wrists powerful enough to create a tornado and then punches the air in triumph. Or he's showing off.
"this is so wide that Pandey has to do the flamingo - his back leg coming up, his hands reaching way outside off to slice it to short third man"
"back of a length and outside off, Kohli tries to upper cut it, but can't reach. Demands a wide, but is denied"
"taken at deep midwicket and Kohli falls. Those wrists, for once, fail him because the slower ball means the length ball doesn't come onto the bad as much as he had hoped. Flick carries all the way out to the boundary though so that should show you the power he can generate with a mis-hit. Walks off with a scowl thudding the face of his bat onto a fist. Apparently 82 off 54 is not enough for him."
slices a full and wide delivery to the left of the sweeper
"short and wide outside off, Pandey belts it to the extra cover boundary"
"on the pads, but Pandey clips it cleanly to deep midwicket"
"full toss outside leg, Dhoni turns it to long leg. One more needed for India's 9-0"
"launches it over extra cover to get his maiden T20I fifty, and India's victory. Length ball, with width, easy putaway and it's time for the celebrations"
