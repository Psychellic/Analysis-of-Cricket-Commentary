"full and straight on the stumps, defended solidly"
"slants one across on a length, no swing this time, left alone"

"eased into the gap between midwicket and mid-on, too straight from Starc. Nice balance and timing from Quinny"
"slips this down leg, tucked to fine leg"

driven firmly but straight to mid-off
"width and he's crashed this wide of point. No chance again for third man, who was a touch too fine. Didn't think he hit it all that well initially"
as good as it gets! Shot of the morning. Behrendorff delivers a juicy half-volley and Markram plays a copy book cover drive right out of the top drawer. Can go any distance to watch strokes like that
sways out of the way of this short ball angled across
right behind the line as he defends this length ball on middle and leg
on the pads and he's flicked this to beat fine leg. Starc's having a horror opening spell. Searching for swing again when there's none

"pokes at a length ball outside off, beaten on the inside edge as this nips back in. On the bounce to Carey."
"blasted through cover! This is superb from QDK. Balance, timing, placement - all in sync. Not much wrong with the delivery - length on off - but de Kock pounced on it in a jiffy and let his timing do the rest"

defended back to the bowler
"turns this to midwicket, this was a quicker one"
"<em>'I've been expecting you, Mr Cummins, says de Kock</em>. Shows the full face of the bat to play an exquisite off drive that nearly took with it the non-striker. Markram had to quickly duck for cover to avoid that crashing into him"
right behind the line in defence
punches to mid-on
"he's already had me ooooohing and aaaaahing enough. Just keeps getting better! Nothing wrong with the delivery - a length ball angled across, but de Kock shows excellent footwork and hand-eye coordination as he laces this through extra cover. Raced away"
"short ball angled across, lets it go this time"
"mid-off dives to get some hand on it. Warner with the full stretch, once again timed so well and was destined to the boundary. Warner saved three."
"drifts in from around the stumps, not much turn, worked wide of midwicket"
"steps out and launches him over long-on without a trace of worry. Pressure? What pressure? It's all off us at the moment, he seems to be saying. This is what playing with a clutter-free mind can do to you. Real pressure on the Aussie bowlers"

driven through the line to extra cover
"slower bouncer, he gets on top of the bounce and pats it behind square"

"dug in short and outside off, de Kock hauls a pull in the direction of deep midwicket"
"Cummins lets rip a bouncer that flies past the head of Markram to a leaping Carey behind the stumps. Top take from the keeper. Markram, too, did well to rock his head out of the way of harm. Wide called for the height"
"Cummins hits a hard length on off, neither driveable nor pullable, jabbed back to Cummins"
"dug in short on off, 139kph, Markram hops back and fends it back to the bowler"
"keeps it short and around off, possibly a slower ball, Markram opens the face and lets the ball slide off the bat to short third man"

"tossed up even slower and drifts into middle again, de Kock closes the face a bit and knocks it away just wide of short midwicket for one"
"<strong>Delightful bowling from Lyon</strong>. Liberally tossed up outside off, this offbreak grips and drifts away, Lyon has Markram reaching out for a drive, but the batsman loses his balance and is dragged out of the crease. Beaten on the outside edge. Carey does the rest behind the stumps and that's how Lyon provides Australia the breakthrough. Flight: check. Dip: check. Drift: check. No turn but that does not matter"

"slower through the air and drifts in on middle, de Kock blocks to the leg side"
"<strong>Lyon has taken down both the SA openers.</strong> Lyon tosses it up outside off, the one that got de Kock did not turn. This offering turns away from de Kock. He dares to force it away against the break. He is nowhere close to the pitch and only skews a catch to Starc at backward point. Both Markram and de Kock have tossed away bright stars"

"there's a direct under-arm flick by Smith at the non-striker's end from cover. Rassie seems to be in trouble, even the dive seems to be futile. Oh well, how wrong was I.

wallops this slower full toss outside off to deep midwicket
"slices a slog to short third man. End of a fab, fab knock. It's amazing how batsmen play clean shots and get the big hits even if they don't wish to. The moment they start slogging, they end up miscuing and edging. Looked to pull, played too early, didn't pick the slower ball and was through with the shot nearly as it lobbed off the toe end.

Was height an issue? I'm not sure, the tracker might have returned umpire's call. Yup, umpire's call it is with the ball trimming the bails"

"raw pace, pure pace, short ball that he's hustled with, defended"
"that's a stunner! Long-on was brought in specifically for this over, Morris, Superman Morris, plucks a magical catch running sideways at mid-on. Warner looks to belt this length ball over mid-on, hits it very well but Morris is just a tad too tall as he moves well to his left and times his jump to perfection to pluck that. Trust me that was travelling. What a knock from Warner though!"

"dabs this to point, can't get a run"
"looks to arch back and upper cut, not much bounce for that. Beaten"

"slower short ball, cramps Carey for room. He flaps a pull down to wide long-on"

"short on leg stump, cramps the batsman for room once again, Carey pulls but can't get it past the tumbling Tahir"
"Andile hits a hard length around off, Starc drives it to sweeper cover and secures a single. <strong>Excellent over from Andile - just five off it plus the wicket of Cummins</strong>"
"off-stump yorker, Morris gives Starc a taste of his own medicine, jammed to point"
"<strong>...and Carey has picked out the off-side sweeper.</strong> Makram dives and swoops down on the ball. That should be the game.

"<strong>Andile closes it out for South Africa</strong>. Another slower roller, Lyon picks it up and hoicks it into the lap of deep midwicket"
