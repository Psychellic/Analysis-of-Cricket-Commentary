"<b>good catch by Tahir again, at deep square leg</b> Bouncer outside off, and he was shimmying down the track again. Tries to play a tennis ball smash from over his shoulder, ends up getting more height than distance. Tahir starts moving to his right, but the ball swirls to his left and he adjust and holds on."
"<b>two wickets in two balls</b> This was full on the stumps, he backed away to swipe it across the line, but was too late on it, and splices it up in the air. Goes straight up, Rabada settles under it and catches it. On a hat-trick now"
"length ball outside off, rears up and he jabs it into the offside. Calls Malinga for the single to keep strike, but if point had hit, Malinga was miles out. Phehlukwayo missed though"

"slower bouncer over off stump, he was way too early into the pull and connected only with air"
"<b>caught at midwicket</b> Back of a length on off, and he wanted to swat it across the line but gets it off the toe-end. It pops up in the air, Duminy takes a couple of steps back and catches it. Sri Lanka fail to last 50 overs once again"

"low full toss, outside off, and it's tapped to cover"
"turned with the spin into the leg side, and there's space for a single"
"this one rushes on with the arm, the ball coming off the inside half of de Kock's defensive push"
"'two, two, two!' shouts de Kock as soon as he slots this through cover, the fielder in the ring diving over it"
"<b>well bowled!</b> De Kock is done by the flight, the ball gripping and spinning past him and the keeper whipping the bails off in a flash. But the back foot is grounded"
a drive pings the cover field
"de Kock waits deep in the crease, chopping to point"
"nice shape, the ball angling in and then swinging away as Markram comes forward and raises his hands into a leave"

""
a checked punch bounces up off the turf to be stopped by point
"<b>whipped out to deep square leg!</b> This is the vital wicket for Sri Lanka, and it's come early. De Kock falls early today, lifting a leg-stump delivery powerfully but straight to Avishka in the deep. Well, not quite straight to him, but he's easily into position to hold the catch"
"full and angled across Markram, who comes forward to drive to mid off"

"<b>beaten outside off</b>, again the ball lifting off the surface to beat Faf's flat-footed poke"

"punched firmly to cover, off the back foot"
"<b>big swish outside off</b>, du Plessis throwing his hands out at one that bounces and leaves him"
