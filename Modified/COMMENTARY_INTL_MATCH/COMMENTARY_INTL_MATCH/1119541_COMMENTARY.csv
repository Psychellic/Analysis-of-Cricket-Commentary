"angled in, no swing and flicked through square leg"
"nicely bowled, slides this across the right-hander from over the wicket, past the outside edge"
"now Finch gets on to the front foot and uses his muscle, bullied over extra cover for a no-nonsense four"
"heaved over the leg side, <b>that's sailed into the crowd at deep square!</b> Maybe a slower ball, 75mph and Finch was aiming more down the ground... but he still got plenty on it!"

on the legs and flicked for one
"is that a drop? No, I don't think it quite carried... Finch glancing uppishly towards short fine leg, Curran dived forwards but couldn't <i>quite</I> get his hands underneath the ball. Prevented it getting away, though"
"slower ball, tucked off the pads for a single square"
"over the wicket, spinning in to hit the front pad as Finch reverse-sweeps... Buttler bellows an lbw appeal, but I think there was some glove on it"
"tossed up, gets a slight leading edge through mid-off for one"
"got him, Moeen strikes - <b>snuck through into the timber!</b> What a good series he's having, this just gripped and spun, cramping Finch as he swung across the line, clipped the bottom edge and then rattled the stumps"
"flat on off stump, Stoinis shows it a straight bat"
"oh, what's he done...? Stoinis falls second ball, <b>swept without timing straight to short fine leg!</b> Good running catch from Ball, England have another. You could see what Stoinis was trying to do, but it was poorly executed, having barely had a sighter; two in three balls for Moeen"

"sliding in with the arm, Marsh works it down to long-on"
"floated up full on middle and off, Carey presses forward to block"

"straighter, flicked into the leg side"
"Marsh reaches forward, overbalances and Buttler whips off the bails - <b>is that a stumping...?</b> Yes, superb bit of work from the keeper, Marsh's foot clearly dangling in the air as his weight went too far forwards; Moeen has a third, spinning it past the outside edge, and Australia in real trouble!"
"back of a length, pushed across from over the wicket and left alone"
"shortish, Carey tries to open the face and run a single, clips the inside edge and ricochets into the body but falls safely"
"length, 81mph and this pops up, likely another cross-seamer and Carey pops a drive through cover point"
speared down the leg side
dabbed down into the off side and they hurry through for a single to get Paine off the mark
"on the stumps, Carey gets into line"
"length ball, closes the face and turns to midwicket"
"brilliant from Buttler! Dropped into the leg side, this is another tight single... and <b>Buttler has raced after it and superbly thrown down the stumps</b> at the bowler's end!

angled in flatter and this is nudged with good placement into a gap on the leg side

that's a big full toss but only costs as a single as it's swept to deep square
"<B>strikes first ball!</b> Back of a length outside off, Carey has a nibble and it's a thin edge to Buttler. Just trying to steer it to third man. A maiden ODI wicket for Sam Curran"
"full and straight, defended to the leg side"
<b>oh my goodness! He's left a straight one</b> It goes from bad to worse for Australia. He's shoulder arms to a delivery that has hit middle and off. Unbelievable. He must have thought it was going to swing away. It certainly didn't. Would even have been too close to leave if he had moved! Jeepers
"back of a length outside off, defended with an open face to backward point"
"that's a little lazy by midwicket, Richardson gets inside the line of a back-of-a-length delivery and flicks to the leg side. Should have been stopped"
"a bouncer, sails over Richardson's head, called a wide"
"touch of extra bounce, short of a length at off stump, it's well played as he takes his bottom hand off the bat and runs it to third man"
"<b>just out of reach!</b> Plunkett got finger tips to it. Richardson went after a flighted leg-break, aiming down the ground, the turn means it gets a thick outside edge which loops high towards mid-off. Plunkett can't quite make the ground"
pushed to mid-on
plays back to quite a full delivery and defends
goes back and pushes into the covers
"very full, at the stumps, jabbed to the off side"

"spears in a leg-stump yorker, deflects off the pad behind square...actually, there's some bat involved"
"good length outside off, defended to backward point"

that's a hefty thump! Picks up a full delivery from outside off and swings it over the long-on boundary
"<b>another run out? Yes, he's gone!</b> The ball deflected off the pad to short fine leg, there was all sorts of confusion over the ball. Richardson eventually turned to get back. Brings out the dive but it's not enough. His bat is on the line (and in the air). An excellent take by Buttler, in front of the stumps, on the half volley"

"worked off the stumps, straight of midwicket and down the ground"
he sweeps from outside off to deep square leg
tucked off the pads to deep midwicket
"attempts another sweep, the delivery is out as full, he misses and gets taken on the body"
"there's an appeal for lbw and then the catch...Root takes it at slip. Given not out for both and England <b>review</b>. The lbw looks outside the line. Was there an edge? There is a spike on Snicko. But was it bat hitting ground? Third umpire reckons so. I'm not so sure, but evidence has to be conclusive. The lbw was also well outside off, so England lose their review"
"appeal for a catch down the leg side, given not out and England have used up their review"
"good shot, drives on the up through the line and sends this racing wide of mid-off"
"picks this up off his pads, it's in the air for a while but falls short of deep square as Bairstow runs in"

"back over the wicket, slides another past Lyon's bat as this goes across him on the angle. Very nice bowling"
"full and straight, driven to mid-off on the edge of the circle"
nudged off the pads into midwicket
"<b>and he's done him!</b> Skids through slowly, Lyon goes back to play the pull, doesn't make contact and that's right in front although Lyon, at the last moment, calls the <B>review</b>. Don't think so, Nathan. His back leg is bent right in front of the stumps. Smashing leg stump."
"full outside leg, prods forward with bat and pad"
"full outside off, he stretches forward and defends to backward point"
"full at the pads, tucked to the leg side. Purely survival for Stanlake"
"round the wicket, angled into the stumps, he rocks back and places this nicely square through the off side"

goes back to a shortish delivery and plays to mid-on
driven into the off side

"can't get the strike back, fired in quickly by Moeen and Short bunts it back to the bowler"
"on the stumps, flicked to the leg side"
"full outside off, driven into the covers, parried away by Morgan and it allows Stanlake off strike"
"goes for the sweep, doesn't make contact, bobbles around Buttler's gloves and is given a wide"
connects nicely with the sweep but goes one bounce to the man at deep square
"that beats him, a googly slides past the outside edge as he plays back"
"beaten again, lunging forward at a googly"
a muted appeal for a bat-pad catch as this loops up and Buttler hops around to collection
super shot...skips down the pitch and lofts this straight down the ground
"shorter, flatter, he rocks back and drives to deep cover"
"full and straight, defended"
"<b>and that's all over!</b> Stanlake plays back outside leg stump, a shortish delivery slides on with the angle from round the wicket. He's not in the same postcode and it clatters leg stump. <B>Career-best for Moeen Ali</b>"
"angled in straight and Roy skips out, works the ball to mid-on"
"tossed up, Roy punches this uppishly, wide of the diving Agar and he's off the mark with one to long-off"
"full, quick and dipping on middle and leg, YJB makes room and punches a drive past extra cover"
"bowled him, <b>straight through Roy!</b> The tactical ploy works, Agar strikes in the first over, Roy aiming a yahoo down the ground but playing around the ball, bowled off his pad. Left-arm spin does the trick, misjudged the flight and that wasn't a great shot"
drifting on to the pads but Hales can't get it past short fine leg
tossed up straight and tapped back

Hales comes across and blocks back to the bowler
"short outside off, climbing through to Paine as Bairstow swings hard and misses"
"dug in, YJB fences off the back foot, <b>thick outside edge but it flies wide of slip</b>... and Short then messes up his fielding effort at third man to gift four!"
"comes across, rides the bounce into the covers"
"back of a length, 91mph and slashed through backward point, they come back for two"
"good heat, 91mph again as Bairstow comes across and blocks into the off side"
"tip and run, dropped down in front of cover and Head can't hit at the non-striker's end as YJB runs his bat in"
"flighted, worked off leg stump and Agar runs across to field"
"full on off, YJB taps it into the off side"
angled in and defended on the stumps
"Bairstow is shifting around in his crease skittishly, can't get the ball away again"
"flicked off the pads, into a gap at backward square leg and they comes hustling back for two"
"pushed down the leg side, Bairstow sweeps and misses... Paine can't grab it, didn't come off anything, so that's two wides to the total"
"floated up on off, Hales pats it back"
"oh, that's out - <b>chopped into this stumps!</b> Stanlake strikes, bringing the ball in as Bairstow went back to cut, too cramped for the shot and he could only bottom-edge into his timbers. Another reminder that England have a bit of work to do if they're going to get a 5-0 of their own"

"length ball 87mph on off, comes across to defend"
"threaded through point, nicely timed by Hales and it gives Head a real chase out towards the boundary... he does brilliantly to pull the ball in just in front of the rope"
"climbing, 88mph outside off, <b>Root fends and sends a thick edge to slip!</b> Two in the over for Stanlake and England are having a proper wobble now... Root chastises himself in frustration, it was short enough that he didn't have to play, but the heat drew him in - and then singed Marsh's hands as he clung on in front of his face!"
pushed through outside off and tapped square
"flighted, Hales steps out and pings a cover drive, gets it between two fielders and that will run away"
Hales moves on to off stump and works to midwicket with the spin
"tossed up, comes across to block"
gets across on off and defends
"flighted, this is clipped firmly to the right of mid-on but there's no run there"
"back of a length, 89mph on middle and leg stump, Morgan calmly taps it down"
"bangs in the bumper, Morgan ducks"
"back of a length, 85mph around off stump, defended to cover"
"ANOTHER! Stanlake shatters the stumps, <b>England four down!</b> Just too quick for him, on a length and Morgan seemed to play around it, the ball rattles middle and off... and Australia must believe they can do this now!"

"flat on off, Buttler prods it into the covers"
"gottim, <b>Hales nicks a wide one to the keeper!</b> England are five down now, certainly doing a very gentlemanly job of letting Australia back into the game... Richardson is the beneficiary, an innocuous ball in the channel, but Hales flapped without foot movement and got a thin edge"

"over the wicket, tossed up full and dabbed into a gap square"
Moeen presses forward on off stump
"flighted, around the line of off, solidly defended coming forwards"
"Buttler takes a couple of steps down early, blocked behind point but Lyon is quickly in"
