"length just outside off, backs away and looks to punch through cover. Mistimed"
"<b>swiped away.</b> Kohli probably went Moeen expecting Warner to take strike. Turns out it's Bairstow's big stride that meets  Mo. Outside off at a length, ends up past square leg and into the boundary"
"length outside off, steps out and taps through the open midwicket region"
"<b>off we go.</b> Length on off stump, too flat to cause issues for Warner who gets his front leg into the leg side and gently lofts this over extra cover"
"length and into the body, nudged in front of square leg with the angle"
"<b>slapped behind square on the off side.</B> More flat stuff, more skid off the pitch with no turn. Lots of width on this occasion too and for once, Bairstow gets ahead of Warner on the scoring. Deep into the crease and gratefully put away with a square cut"

"length outside off, sliced on the rise to point"
"length on middle stump, flicks across the angle and finds midwicket"
"slower ball, short of a length in the corridor. Forces him to check his shot - he wanted to punch that through cover. Extra cover falls to his right and gets a hand, but can't stop the single"
"length and a bit of wobble as this slants in to Bairstow. Everyone in world cricket knows that's the ball you bowl to him these days. Stands tall and punches to mid-on, albeit with a gap between bat and body"
"length on leg stump, looks to flick and cops this on the thigh"
length and turning in at leg stump. Gets low and caresses this to deep midwicket's left with a closed face

"length ball slanted in at off stump, punched off the toe-end towards mid-on"

"length outside off, looks to chop on the rise, can't beat Hetmyer's leap at backward point"

"length on leg stump, flicked to deep square"
"bouncer down leg side, ducks under it"

"yorker in the corridor, jams the bat down on it. Gets it to Hetmyer on the bounce at backward point"
"<b>just evade mid-off.</b> He has the runs, but he hasn't always been in control. Length outside off. goes on the rise and the bat turns in his hand as this slice clears Barman and runs away"

"length outside off, dragged to deep midwicket with a sweep on the up"

"length at middle stump, beats him in flight. Warner steps out and is forced to defend back towards the bowler"

"<B>gorgeous!</b> Lovely clean hit from a lovely clean blade. Bairstow reaches out at this length ball outside off, stands tall and pumps it over the extra cover boundary. Regal."
"<b>misfield</b> from long-on after he makes the ground to his right. It's a full ball on middle stump, he plonks the front leg out and drives firmly against the turn. A tumble and a hand from the fielder, but not quite a stop"
"<b>paddles it fine</b> and brings up fifty! Second fiddle so far, but today he's taken the bowling on. And he's sized up the teenager. Gets low - the line is always going to be at the stumps - and exposes the stumps to pick his gap"

"inside edge to short fine. Length outside off, throws his hands at this but can't connect well enough"

"short ball, and he goes back and lofts this towards extra cover. They pick up two comfortably, and even think about a third. But they decide against it"

"short, and he moves away and swings this over the man at short midwicket. Wide long on gets across but cannot stop them from picking up two"

"fuller ball, and he goes down on one knee, and eases this several rows behind long on. <strong>What a way to get off the mark!</strong>"
"fuller, towards the leg stump, and he eases this towards deep midwicket. Wants two, but will have to settle for one"

Slower ball at a length on leg stump, flicked towards midwicket. Mo wants the run, he's sent back. The fielder is off balance as he throws and therefore it comes in on the bounce.
