<b>top edge falls short of long leg.</b> The mistake was coming. Rashid has them squeezed at the moment. It's a length ball on middle stump. Premeditated half-sweep form Guptill lands short
"<b>it looks like Willey has pulled off another sensational piece of fielding.</b> Taylor won't wait for the third umpire's decision on this run out. This is epic stuff from Willey at backward point. Rashid drops short and Taylor slaps it. It's a release shot after a long time and this probably leads to him instinctively take off for a run. But Willey has leapt to his right to stop this with one hand, close to the ground. He's then chucked it back in with force after swivelling to switch to his stronger hand and it's close enough to the stumps that Buttler won't have difficulty whipping the bails off. Guptill sends Taylor back, and Taylor's dive can't get him anywhere close"

"back of a length from Curran, 135 kph, pushed to cover. Guptill will now have to recalibrate."

"uh oh. Guptill picks out deep midwicket. <b>Another terrific play by England in the field</b>. Roy makes it look so easy, that's one of the harder catches in international cricket. Some flight from Moeen, and Guptill accepts the invitation to sweep fiercely. He hasn't quite got it. There is plenty of bat behind the stroke, but not enough timing or elevation. The ball flies flat and low to Roy, who gets his hands in position early and takes a really good catch."
"flight on middle and leg, blocked by Nicholls"
"back of a length, an open-faced dab to third man for one"
"short down leg, pulled away towards fine leg. Stokes may want to just go fuller to the new batsman"
another glide off the open face to third man for a single
"130 kph, another sensational catch! England are on fire. To be fair, that was a terrible delivery, short, wide and asking to be hit. Nicholls cuts, but doesn't keep the ball down. It flies flat and quick, like the Guptill catch, to Roy's right at backward point. His eyes are on the ball right through, he extends his hands with a reverse cup and takes it with both hands. Another very hard catch made to look incredibly easy. Stunning work from England this afternoon."

It was much more in front of square and towards the fielder in comparison to the last ball. A good innings from CDG ends tamely"

Southee, however, is craning his neck and is twisted awkwardly trying to look at the ball. When Santner does make the call to go for the run, Southee isn't in position to sprint.

"that's in the slot and it's smashed for four. Overpitched and wide from Boult, Bairstow stands his ground, just leans into the stroke and caresses it through cover"
"angled across, a tad wider. Bairstow lets that one through"
"full, wide and smashed! It was moving away but in Roy's hitting arc, he smashes the ball over wide mid-off. Got underneath the length too"
"too straight this time, he goes wide of the crease, but strays on the pads, clipped neatly through square leg for four more."
"good comeback, hits a tidy length on a fourth-stump channel, punched to cover"
"good length, fifth-stump area, but Roy has shuffled across, so it isn't there to cut, it's too close. Left alone"
"nicely bowled and well played, full around middle and leg, pushed away to mid-on with the high elbow"
"133 kph, good finish from Southee to that over, just fuller than a good length, wobbles around before beating Roy on the inside edge. Hits him on the back leg, there's an appeal but too high"
"angles it across again, on a length, defended to cover by Bairstow"
"nicely played, full and wide, Bairstow opens the bat face and guides this away to third man"
"taken by Santner at square leg. A short delivery around middle and off, Roy looks to keep the pull down, but eventually he can't. He picks out the fielder. Saw the length early, though early but just couldn't adjust his hands. He would have been in a better position if he looked to hit it over square leg, but just couldn't quite get on top of the bounce to keep the ball down."
"dug in first up, 141 kph, Root gets underneath that"
"another short one, 138 kph, a bouncer. Another duck"
"full and wide outside off, caressed to cover from the crease"
"back of a length around off, 136 kph, nudged to midwicket"
"short and wide outside off, extra bounce, the ball bounces over the cut"
"too straight from Southee, on middle and leg. Bairstow goes flicking, right in the gap at midwicket for four. Just timing"
"full outside off, 136 kph, brings Bairstow forward but he isn't driving just yet"
"short and wide again, Bairstow cuts fine, past backward point's left for a couple. Boult had to run across to get the ball in his stronger hand"
"short and wide again, slashed behind point again and it races away. Boult runs across but can't quite get there."
"nicely clipped but Root picks out square leg. Full and swinging back in, flicked away but finds the fielder"
"good length delivery outside off, chopped down to third man for a single"

"fine end, 136 kph, back of a length around off, Bairstow guides the ball to point from the crease. Terrific over"

"too straight again, nudged away past square leg for a single."
"133 kph, another nice bouncer, around middle and leg, pulled through square leg for a single. Ferguson gets across from fine leg to cut it off"
"a slower ball outside off, 117 kph, worked to midwicket"
"muscled through cover. Full and wide from Southee, Bairstow, it seemed, looked to hit that too hard. The timing isn't great but the placement is, past cover."
"135 kph, lovely timing again. Full and swinging away, sliced past point for a run to third man"
"what a shot that is. 136 kph, a length delivery but Boult makes the error of bowling that too straight. A pick-up flick, a checked pick-up flick. Stunning timing, it clears the backward square leg boundary"
"back of a length delivery outside off, Bairstow fails to connect with an attempted upper cut"
"the natural response from the quick. A word too from Boult. The bouncer down leg, Bairstow ducks"
"a tad too straight, 137 kph, nudged down to fine leg"
"back of a length outside off, Root brings out the dab, plays it ever so late. Fine single, all the best players in the world play that shot."
"136 kph, good length around off, clipped to square leg"
"some flight around off, pushed to mid-on."
"a poor delivery from Santner. He drops short outside off, Root hurries back and pulls over midwicket with nonchalant ease. So easy"
"shortish and wide, carved away towards cover"
"86 kph, full around middle and leg, clipped towards de Grandhomme at midwicket, he gets across with a smart left hand"
"flat on middle and leg, swept towards short fine leg"
"89 kph, flat trajectory to protect the over, flat and wide, punched to cover"
"136 kph, good length delivery outside off, pushed into the off side. Stays on the back foot, trying to force it through"
"too close to cut, 136 kph, outside off, under-edged towards the keeper"
"lovely stop from Chapman at extra cover. Full and wide, in the Root driving arc. Drilled. Chapman dives away to his left"
"full and straight, 139 kph, driven back to the bowler"
"taken by de Grandhomme! <strong>Another catch for the series highlights reel</strong>! So good that catch was that Root first called 'yeah'. He had thought it passed de Grandhomme. On the pads from Boult, it's a scoring opportunity, at least that's what Root thinks. He fails to keep it down, the ball lobs to de Grandhomme's right. Both feet off the ground, one hand outstretched to his right, the ball meets palm and Root is gone. Some fine fielding today."
"short, around middle, 138 kph, fended away. A wicket maiden"
"lots of flight outside off, Bairstow gets forward and drives to the sweeper cover."
"tossed up outside off, Morgan gets forward to defend"

"plenty of flight around off, drilled to cover"
"nicely bowled, slow around off, defended back"
"good length delivery on middle and off, pushed back"
"the top edge for four. Another nice bouncer down leg, hurrying Morgan through the pull. Takes the leading edge and flies over the keeper"
"fine placement. It races away for four. Overpitched outside off from Boult, Morgan strides forward and punches the drive through cover. All timing."
"four more. All timing again. Full again, Morgan stays slightly leg side of the line. But that doesn't throw off his timing. Punched past the bowler, races away again."
"shortish this time, back of a length and wide, flies past gully for a run to third man"
"a length delivery outside off, guided away to gully"
"nice and full down leg, pushed away to long-on for a run"
"very full outside off, driven away to long-off"
"a bunt for six. How easy was that from Morgan? Tossed up outside off, Morgan gets underneath the length and lofts the ball over mid-off. No sweat. Just bottom hand and timing. Batting these days ..."
"slower around off, defended"
"flat on off, looking to cut but it's too close, worked to midwicket"
gets right forward to defend that
"good length on off, decent pace, pushed back to the bowler"
"143 kph, good bounce and pace, back of a length outside off, carved away to third man"
"back of a length on a fourth-stump channel, 144 kph, punched to extra cover"
"short and wide, carved towards backward point, who dives to his left and parries it to extra cover to get the ball away. Another lovely piece of fielding"
"goes short does Ferguson, it isn't too short or too quick for Morgan though. Square leg is up so the pull goes over the fielder and clears the boundary too"
"143 kph. <strong>Dropped!</strong> Did we just see a catch go down? Another bouncer, another pull, but a completely different result. A thick top edge, Latham leaps to his left but can only get a hand on it. Not an easy catch, but he could have so easily parried it up for himself."
"slow down leg, off the thigh pad for a run to short fine leg"
"flight outside off, drilled to deep cover"

"nice and slow, but too straight, nudged to square leg"
"flat and straight, clipped towards square leg, one more easy run"
"flat and quick, tidy over ends, punched back to the bowler"
"looking to bowl too quick, short down leg. Bairstow just helps that fine, through fine leg. Didn't go through with the shot lest he pick out fine leg"
"straight to third man! Another short delivery outside off, Bairstow looks to guide that over the slip cordon so he places his bat in a position to get the ball over or just past slip. But the ball hits more of the bat than Bairstow wanted. Takes a good chunk of the bat and carries down to third man."
"back of a length outside off, 142 kph, nicely left alone"
"146 kph, full and straight, pushed away to mid-on"
"short again, quick again, left alone by Stokes. Giving himself a few sighters"
"looking for the yorker, around off, jammed away to cover"
"good length delivery outside off, a discernible change-down in pace, defended"
"120 kph, <strong>that was a weird run</strong>. Absolutely no need for that. Back of a length down leg, Morgan comes down and misses a flick. The ball trickles back up the pitch, Morgan thinks of going back but it was Stokes' call, so he goes through with the run. De Grandhomme runs in and kicks the ball past the post from a meter out."
"on a length down leg, Stokes comes down and misses a glance. May have clipped the pad. There was an optimistic appeal"
"just wide of mid-on. 123 kph, back of a length around off, Stokes pulls, not great timing, but decent placement. Just past the fielder."
"good length outside off, carved to point after a forward shimmy"
"123 kph, good length, hit away to long-on for a single."
short and slanted across off stump. Gets on top of the bounce and taps it to point
"short of a length on middle stump, nudged through square leg and a loud call of no to prevent an unnecessary risk on the second. Santner was onto this quickly"
"shot. Morgan stays leg side of this and taps it through the covers. Not easy, because it's climbing at him. But that spring into the leg side allows him as he leaps off the ground and caresses this"
short and angled across off. This time his technique means he can't get close enough to connect on the cut

"back of a length on off stump, defended solidly on the back foot"
picks up the short ball on off stump and turns it to deep square with a pull

"short of a length outside off, cut to sweeper cover"
too short again. This time down leg side. Stokes doesn't have to do more than follow with his hands and tickle this fine. He does it with an angled bat
"shot. Springs on the back foot and punches this through midwicket, across the angle"
"back of a length and in on off stump, tapped back to the bowler off the back foot"

"good length on middle stump, punched back to the bowler on the bounce"
good length and in at off stump. Tapped to extra cover on the up
<b>'No! No! No!'</b> is the assured call from Stokes. He's inside-edged a pull shot right onto his hip bone. There's no question of a run and he sends Morgan back. On his back but he's alright

"good length on middle stump, plants the front leg forward and drives to long-on"

"good length on middle stump, tapped back to the bowler with the turn"
<b>oh dear! This would've been a screamer from Nicholls!</b> But he's lost the grip on it as he's headed for the turf. Gravity's ruined what could've been a stunning moment. Morgan nails the pull shot against this short ball at his ribs. It's going down and to Nicholls' left. He manages to get two hands on it while being air-borne. Whew
"short at the ribs again, tucked to deep square along the floor"
back of a length and in at the stumps. Defended off the back foot
"gentle. Stokes eases this through the covers. It's back of a length and just outside off. All timing as he pierces extra cover, standing tall while doing it"

"back of a length on middle, tapped into the midwicket region"

"length on leg stump, tapped into the leg side"
"<b>bounces over Chapman at deep square</b> who has decided to run in this time. Once again, no chance of making it at deep square. But he commits to following it, the hook dips on him and it clears his head as he slides"

yorker tailing in late at leg stump. Jammed out to mid-on

"back of a length in the corridor, defended on the back foot"
"full on leg stump, flicked to deep square"
"<b>misjudged in the deep</b> slightly as a difficult chance flies Chapman's way at sweeper cover. It's a short ball angled across Morgan who plays a delightful upper cut. Chapman runs in and has to track back to his right. In the end, he's leaping over the rope to try and get a hand to that. Might have come close if he was on the line, but it would've been a tough one to hang onto anyway"

"short ball outside off, gets behind the line and slaughters with a horizontal bat, wide of mid-on"

"back of a length at off stump, tapped back down the pitch"
"<b>taken by Munro.</b> A slo-mo, anti-climactic caught-and-bowled. Might have been the knuckle ball because this didn't come off after pitching. It's just outside off but with an angle in. He tries to cut but it ends up hitting the top part of the bat and lobs back to the bowler"

"<strong>that's a NZD 50,000 catch! </strong>The catching continues to be mighty impressive today. A bouncer around off, Buttler top-edges the pull and clears fine leg. The man, in the brown-clad shirt, takes <strong>a lovely, well-judged reverse-cupped catch</strong>"
