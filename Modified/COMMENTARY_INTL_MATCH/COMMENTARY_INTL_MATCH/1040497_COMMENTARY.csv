"good length ball, angling in, tucked away to midwicket"

backs away and stabs this length ball away to sweeper cover
"<b>edged and missed</b>. Loopy fullish ball, flighted and angling in on middle, draws the batsman forward and he gets an edge with the ball dipping on him that goes between keeper and slip who dives to his left. But that was Shahzad's catch, goes to the right of his glove. Misjudges it"

works the in-drifter to mid-on for a quick single
down on one knee as he sweeps that incoming delivery with the angle to deep square. Wanted the second but Wilson wasn't keen and put his hand out almost immediately after completing the first run
"this one keeps low and sneaks through his defence. The ball drifts in from wide of the crease, pitches on off and skids straight on. Balbirnie was looking to work it with the turn when there was none. Couldn't do much really as the ball didn't bounce enough. Bat didn't come down on time either. Big, big wicket. He was a split-second late on the shot as well."

swept with the spin to deep square leg
"pushed outside the line. The ball cut back in to shave past the inside-edge. Phew, so close to the off stump"
"this time he's got his man. Foxed him completely in length. Thompson feels for the ball, I suspect he was expecting a googly and so pushed outside the line. There was a big gap between bat and pad. This ball spun back in to sneak through. Created the doubt and then finally nipped it in the bud. Skillful from Rashid. Ireland in trouble"
"gets back and across, short ball defended back to the bowler"

"eased behind point, the fielder dives full length to his right but can only half-stop it, and so has to run all the way back to the boundary to pull it back in"

lunges forward and blocks
gets a good stride forward and smothers the spin
"beauty! Once again foxed by the turn. Had no clue if this would spin away as he prodded forward half-heartedly and saw the ball drift-in, straighten and hit off stump. Played down the wrong line again. Fourth for Nabi. The series is fast slipping for the Irish."

turned across the line but good work by mid-on to swoop in quickly

"slower and fuller outside off, he gets forward and blocks"
looks to pull but cramped for room. Thick edge back onto the pad as he tried to attempt a short-arm jab

width and driven square to the man in the deep
"slower delivery on middle, punched to cover"
"too short and outside off, directed behind square on the leg side"
"big appeal for caught behind, but the umpire isn't interested. This was full outside off, he had room and tried to carve that over point. Very close, but don't think there was a nick. Keeper wasn't entirely convinced, but the bowler was dead sure this was out. There was a sound but it may be that of the bat hitting the ground"

"short outside of, punched to deep cover"
"not all that short to cut, gets a thick bottom edge to third man"

"holes out to the lone man at deep midwicket. Poor ball. It was too short, he could have played it wherever he pleased. This time, he hit it straight down the throat of the fielder. The ball may have skidded on a touch to prevent him from playing it behind square. Afghanistan are still alive."

"opened the bat face late to steer the short ball to deep point, sensible stuff to bring the senior partner back on strike"
