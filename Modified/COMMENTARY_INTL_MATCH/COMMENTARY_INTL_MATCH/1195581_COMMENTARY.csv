"very full length, just short of a yorker on off, defended softly towards extra cover and they run through for a quick single"
"swing and a miss. Good length, going across him, he has a waft at it"
"low full toss on off, that was bowled at 146.1 kph. Bit late on that perhaps and the bat twists in his hand as it's pushed past the bowler without timing for another quick single"
"length ball nipping into him, goes to short fine leg off his pad. No fielder there so they can take two"
"good length outside off, punched to cover"
"nicely timed punch through cover. Full ball outside off, and he gets on the front foot nicely to stroke it"
"<b>picks out deep square leg</b>. Was short of a length, but not short enough to pull the way he did, without really creating the length by going deep in his crease. Didn't really get hold of it, and the thick top edge flies straight to Dwarshuis, who doesn't have to move and catches it safely."
"back of a length on leg stumps, tucked off his hips to deep square."
"good length on off, patted towards extra cover"
<b>hammered</b>. That is just no respect for the bowler. Dances down as if it's a spinner and flat-bats it hard and straight over the bowler. Power.
"short ball outside off, Lynn pulls with control, keeps it down. There is a deep square leg, so it's only one"
"angling across him on a length, well across and almost a wide. But just inside the tram line so he won't get penalised. The batsman tries to flay it through the offside, but it's too far from body."
"length ball angling across him, pitches on middle, tapped back to the bowler's left from the crease"
"<b>massive</b>. Good bouncer, but Lynn spotted it early, was in terrific position, went on the back foot and hooked it way over deep square leg. That made an audible crack as it left the bat"
and now he swings this full ball on legstump to the wide long-on boundary. Didn't time it well but no fielder there so it bounces into the fence
he's just going hard at it is Lynn. Back of a length bowled well outside off and Lynn has room to free his arms. Flays it hard. No timing but lands safely over point
"and he's still going for it. He's not timed anything well after that six, but is just picking up runs. Short of a length on the stumps, pulls fiercely to deep midwicket"
"goes to punch this back of a length ball outside off, but gets an inside edge to short fine leg"
"flat, fuller on leg stump, swept hard, but gets it off the bottom half of the bat, goes to short fine leg"
"flat on a length, Lynn gives himself room but can't crash it through the offside"
"gets hold of that one. Given himself room again, this one was fuller and he extends his arms to smash this over mid-off"
<b>stand and deliver!</b>. Gives himself room again and smashes this straight over the bowler and into the sightscreen. On the top of the sight screen in fact.
"inside out, wanted to go over mid-off, ends up splicing it over cover. But he's got enough meat on it for the fielder running back to not get there in time to catch it. Does have time to pull it back from the boundary though"
"flatter on leg stump, tucked through midwicket to keep strike"
"starts off with a full toss on the stumps. Surprised Lynn a bit and he brought his bat down a little lat, jabbed it to the bowler's left"
"<b>shot.</b>. Nothing much wrong with the ball, it's a yorker on the fifth stump, but Lynn stays still, and opens the bat face, bringing it down at the exact moment to meet ball sweetly and sends it racing through point"
"he's doing a smash and grab job is Lynn. Some well timed shots and a lot of brute power behind the others. This one is hacked straight past the bowler, but not timed well. Long -on cleans up to his left"
"good ball again, yorker on the stumps, Lynn strokes it well but straight to cover"
"low full toss, yorker gone wrong probably, and Lynn shows his amazing power. Scaramouched it over long-on. The strength in his forearms is unbelievable, he just punched it, but kept it lofted and it travelled at pace"
"<b>fifty for Lynn off just 20 balls</b>. This is carnage. He's not even timed that but it's gone way over long-off. Threw his bat at this full one outside off, and sent it soaring"
"fuller outside off, leans into the cover drive to take a single - which is the best thing to do right now when you're batting with Lynn."
"<b>bludgeoned</b>. Back of a length, sat up, and when you bowl that to Lynn in this mood, it's going to disappear. Rocks back and pulls it with so much power, high over square leg"
"good ball, slower bouncer outside off, and Lynn misses the pull. They take the bye, with the keeper fumbling the take. Sixers will be happy with that because it takes Lynn off strike"
"fuller angling across him on a fifth stump, he went down and reached for it, wanted to send it over mid-off. Just about clears the fielder"
"another fumble by the keeper allows another bye. Heazlett moving well across to try and ramp this over the keeper, probably unsighted him, misses the ball and it's not collected cleanly."
"slower bouncer dug into the pitch outside off, but that makes no differnce. Lynn simply chops it over the vacant slip region and into the third man boundary"
"tossed up on leg stump, tried to flick it off his legs, but it goes off the pad to short third man"
"tossed up, on a yorker length on the fifth stump, Lynn misses the cut"
"okay you've had your fun by beating me one ball, says Lynn, and goes down on one knee to slog-sweep this full ball over long-on. He's hitting sixes for fun"
"good ball, bowled very wide of off, Lynn has to fetch his sweep, gets it off the toe end through midwicket"
"good length on off, spinning into him, he goes back and cuts it through cover"
"he was waiting for that and prepared. Tossed up well wide of off, and Lynn gets into position early, goes across slightly to bring it within his slog-sweeping arc and crashes it over long-on."
"tossed up outside off, lovely punch through cover brings them two. But keeping Lynn off strike is a victory for the bowler right now"
<b>that might be out</b>. There's a referral for a stumping. He was going across and went to sweep it hard. Missed connecting. It ricochets into the stumps off the keeper's gloves. Heazlett's momentum playing the shot means his back foot is in the air when that happens so he'll have to be on his way. Unlucky way for him to go.
"fuller and flatter on the stumps, stroked to cover"
"length on the stumps, patted to the bowler's left"
"tossed up on the stumps, flicked off his toes to deep midwicket"
"flatter, fired into him, tucked through midwicket. He'll keep strike"
"full toss, leathered back straight but the bowler's in the way. Doesn't stop it cleanly but stops the run"
"well bowled, dips on him a bit on yorker length, steered to short third man"
"and there's the big shot. Swept hard, but without timing, to deep midwicket. This was flat and on a length"
"quicker one, full and into Renshaw who defends towards point"
"googly, angled across him, flayed through point"
"<b>monstrous</b>. Flighted ball, down the track he comes, picks it up and hits it way over the bowler's head. Anything leaving his bat is either over the fence or into a gap"
flicked off his toes through midwicket
"<b>bang</b>. There is no stopping Lynn. I don't want to use the cliched Lynnasnity, but after a point you run out of adjectives. Down the track again and lifts this over the bowler once again"
"<b>goes inside out over long-off and just clears the man</b>. This was flatter on the stumps, and he went at it hard again."
<b>caught at long-on going for the fastest ever BBL century</b>. So 39 balls remains the record. Lynn's out for 94. Stepped out and drove this hard but flatter and there was a fielder at long-on who moved to his left and gathered it. Relief for Sixers. But what an innings by Lynn.
"fuller on the stumps, driven to long-off"
"flatter on off, flicks it to deep square leg by going across"
googly but down leg and he'll have to rebowl that
"tossed up wide of off, reaches for it and drives it to long-off"
"quicker outside off, comes on the front foot to flick it through midwicket"
"he's keeping it wide of off for the right-hander, and Peirson reaches for it again to drive to long-off"

"pulls his line outside off, and is driven through cover"
"bowls a yorker length flatter one on middle stump this time, and is flicked off his toes to deep midwicket"
"length on the stumps, tucked through midwicket"
"tossed up, full outside off, driven to long-off"
"quicker one, stuck in the pitch a bit. He was coming on the front foot and had to check his push to long-off"
"flatter outside off, wants to go over the top, but doesn't time it well. Drops short of long-off, well short"
tucked backward of square
"chips it in the air again, full on the stumps, but bounces in front of long-off"
"length ball outside off, opens the face to steer it past backward point"
"swinging yorker on the sixth stump, gets his bat down late to steer it to backward point"
"yorker on the stumps, jams it back past the bowler. They think about a single but wisely decide against it, with fielders converging on the ball"
"length ball on the stumps, pushed to the bowler's right. They take the single this time, with mid-on having to run to his left to field"
"length ball angling into him, he plays with the angle, flicks it off his pads to short fine leg"
"pace off the ball, wide outside off, he drags it in the air, but doesn't get enough on it to carry to long-on"
"length ball nibbling around off stump, defended to extra cover"
"fuller on the stumps, flicked to midwicket and they scramble a quick single"
"<b>swung over midwicket</b>. The boundaries had dried up after Lynn, but Renshaw corrects that. Full outside off, in his arc, and he picks it up nicely to deposit it for six"
"back of a length outside off now, he corrects for the previous ball and has better results. Renshaw only able to hack it through cover for a single"
"that's a bad ball and taken advantage of. Length down leg, all he had to do is get a fine tickle on it. He does so, moving across and paddling it fine"
"slower ball, back of a length outside off, he had to adjust and can only punch to point"
"tossed up, dipping on him on leg stump, manages to get some bat on it trying to glance it fine. Goes to short fine leg"
"tossed up outside off, swept hard and timed well, but there is a fielder at deep square leg"
saw him come down the track and bowled it shorter and flatter. Renshaw can only chop it to point
"down the track again, he bowls it quicker again. Pushed to extra cover"
"stays in his crease that time, but good bowling by Pope, who flights this on leg stump. Renshaw goes for the slog sweep and doesn't connect as the ball lobs off pad towards mid-on"
"flatter on leg stump, tickled to short fine leg"
"lost control of that, slower ball that looped up high and dipped on the batsman. He was going down to paddle it fine. Waits for it and gets it to fine leg"
"back of a length, cutting into him, squirted to backward square leg off a thick inside edge"
"another one that cuts in, he was looking for the big heave over cow corner. Gets an inside edge that strikes body and rolls towards point"
"<b>nicely picked up</b>. Was standing quite inside the crease, moves across and flicks it off his pad, straight over deep square leg"
"<b>outside edge</b>. Fuller and wider outside off, he wants to lean into the drive but the angle means it takes the edge. Flies past the keeper to fine third man"
"yorker, on the  seventh stump, he wanted to stroke it through the offside but doesn't connect"
"yorker on the fifth stump, goes back and drives it to mid-off"
"back of a length outside off, mis-times his pull, midwicket fields on the bounce"
"down the track, goes for the slog on the leg side, but is cramped for room with the bowler banging it down and into him. Another fumble by the keeper allows another bye"
"superb yorker, just inside the tramline. The batsman was moving across, but it's still too far for him to reach and get bat on it"
"<b>corker of a hit </b>. Not because it was well timed - it was - but because he read the bowler's mind too. Moved well across, knowing the wide outside off line was targetted and was in prime position to extend his arms and leather this straight back. Was a slower ball too"
"moves across again, this time looking to slog-sweep but the ball sneaks under bat, to keeper"
"back of a length, slower one outside off. He goes for the flat-batted pull over long on but can't time it. Long on's running in but can only pick it up on the bounce"
"flat-batted straight to extra cover. He was targetting long-off, with no fielder there, but Abbott dug this in short and into him. Too close to be able to free his arms and pull off that shot, ends up hitting it straight to the fielder in the circle"
"nice connection, but there is a sweeper out at deep midwicket. Short ball, sat up, and was pulled powerfully"
"slower yorker on the fourth stump, waits for it and flicks it past midwicket"
<b>top edge just eludes short fine leg</b>. Valiant effort. He went for the pull and the top edge was swirling over the fielder who was running back and keeping it within sight. Went for a dive at the end but it was just out of reach
"<b>cracking shot</b>. Moved across, and got in perfect position to deal with the back of a length ball slanting across him, pulls it fiercely through midwicket"
"<b>smoked</b>. Just like that. Moves across, and picks it up on a full length outside off with a slog-sweep flick over deep midwicket"
"huge flourish of the bat, driving this full one outside off, but cover is there to field"
"fired in quicker on the fourth stump, he's moved across a bit again, picks it up off his toes and drives to long-on"
"bowls to his field, with a full and wide one outside off, Cutting gets down on one knee and square drives to deep point"
"another gorgeous pickup shot. Full and coming into him, off-cutter by the left-arm pacer, but it's flicked nicely to the deep square leg boundary"
driven to long-on
"full and wide yorker outside off, gets an outside edge on the attempted drive to third man. Renshaw hares back for the second and he's made it. That's not impressive fielding, to allow two runs there. The fielder at third man was tardy in getting to the ball"
"<b>crashed between mid-off and extra cover</b>. Curran had protection on the legside, he bowled it full and outside off, and Renshaw unleashes a powerful drive that's placed to perfection"
fantastic placement. Raises <b>fifty off 36 balls</b>. full outside off and he uses his wrists to twirl this in front of square and into the gap for another boundary
"trying to keep it out of Renshaw's reach, he bowls it too far outside off"
"goes across to try and flick-sweep this one from outside off, but misses."
"picks it up on the full, and lofts the on-drive. Connects well enough to clear long-on"
"fuller outside off, driven to mid-off. They finish with a single."
"smacked backward of square first ball. Length ball into him, sits up a bit, he swivels and goes on the back foot to hit it sweetly"
"fuller outside off, driven off the inside half of the bat to mid-on"
"swing and a miss. Nice line nibbling outside off, slanted across him on a length. Went for the drive, but can't connect"
"another swing and a miss. Pulls the length back a bit the line stays the same, slanting across in the channel. This time he went on the back foot to try and smack it over cow corner. Doesn't connect again"
"brilliant fielding by Renshaw at cover, who dives to his right to stop the ball. This was well timed, gave himself some room to crash this full ball through cover"
"fuller outside off, steered to backward point"
"tossed up on off, makes room and drives through cover. Not well timed"
"<b>castled him!</b> Moved across, very far across, to sweep this full ball. Misses it, it dips and goes straight on to disturb the stumps. The batsman's going to be filthy at the mode of dismissal and the fact that it came against a non-regular bowler"
"and this one whizzes past the outside edge. Renshaw's having quite a day. Length ball, slanted across, goes with the arm, defeats the push"
patted to midwicket
flicked through midwicket
"down the track, he fires it into him, opens the face and steers to short third man's right"
"given some air, on leg stump, goes down and wants to sweep this hard, but can only get it to short fine leg"
"flatter on the stumps, pushed to a deepish mid-off"
"googly, on a length on middle and turns away, he was giving himself room and extends his arms to crash it, but can't beat cover"
"down the track, but it dips, grips and turns into him, hits his pad and rolls into the offside"
"quicker one, very short, but very quick too. Was beaten by the pace of it, trying to pull. That was 113.7 kph! Seam up ball"
"<b>dropped by short fine leg running in</b>. Josh Lalor the fielder, who dived in front but couldn't hold on. He went to sweep and got a top edge that swirled behind him, but is lucky it fell just out of reach"
"down the track, gets to the pitch and flicks it to midwicket"
"nails it this time. Down the track again, picks it up off his toes, and deposits to square leg"

"makes room but the bowler follows, swept to deep midwicket"
"down the track, giving himself room, he bowls it into him, and the batsman drives to long-off"
"fuller on the stumps, punched firmly to mid-off"
"fuller, looked like another seam-up ball from the action though it was only 88 kph. Gets the inside edge on the sweep to square leg"
"gets a hold of this finally, goes deep in his crease to create a length that he can go low down to sweep hard to backward square leg"
"googly, swatted to mid-on"
"niceley played, drives with the full face of the bat over mid-on. Not timed well so long-on has time to run around nad field"
"misses the reverse sweep. Huge shout for lbw, not given. That was a good shout. Looked like it pitched on leg, or just outside, and was turning away from the batsman. Struck on the back pad"
"fuller, swept hard in front of square"
"full and wide outside off, stroked to point's right with good timing. But there is a man in the deep who runs to his left to field it"
"picked up the full, slower ball well and swiped across the line to send it to the long-on boundary"
"angled into him and dug in shorter because he was coming down. He can't get it away, rolls off the pad"

"fires in a yorker on leg stump from around the wicket, jams his bat down to squirt it to square leg"

"another off-cutter, driven to long-off"

"super shot. Tossed up on the stumps, he makes room and lifts it over cover"
"too short, he rocks back and slap it to deep midwicket, using his wrists. He's not happy. Better placement would have got him a boundary"

"fuller, dips on him, swats it across the line, but doesn't connect. Bounces to long-on"
"<b>foxed him</b>. Tossed up on leg stump, he was coming down the track, it dips on him and spins through, his heave connects with air. The keeper makes no mistake in whipping off the bails. Phillipe's tortured stay comes to an end."

"a bit of flight now, full and on leg stump, clipped to deep square leg"
"Vince had to go for that shot, didn't he? No real choice now, and he steps out, possibly looking to hit down the ground. It's the googly from Swepson, though, and he's forced to drag the big hit squarer than he wants, and deep square leg takes the catch right on the edge of the boundary, making sure not to lose his balance"
"back of a length close to off stump, goes on the back foot to punch towards long-on"
"shortish slower ball wide of off. Looks to cut, but there's no pace to work with, and he chops it down into the turf, and the ball rolls slowly towards the keeper, to his right"
"length ball close to off stump, steered to deep point"
"back of a length on off stump, slower legcutter. Has to play against the movement to flick through the leg side, ends up playing it back down the pitch instead"
"bang. First ball that Henriques has faced that's really in the slot, full and outside off. Not wide enough to make him reach out, so he's free to free his arms and launch this high and hard, waay over wide long-on"
