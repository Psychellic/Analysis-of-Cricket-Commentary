"back of a length, steered to third man on the hop"
"short, decent line, and forces Hashmat to weave out of the way. Had his bat up in the air, but evaded the ball. Bowled at about 133 kph"
"short again, and he waits on it, and works it off his hips towards deep backward square"
"back of a length, again he waits deep inside his crease, and blocks"
"dug in short, from leg towards middle, and he ducks under this one"
"back of a length, nudged towards point. All thoughts of a quick single are aborted quickly, as the fielder swoops in and underarms it right to the stumps at the striker's end"
"length, and he backs away and carves this through extra cover. There are more fielders inside the circle, and that's why the challenge is to pierce the infield. That's exactly what he does"
"flatter, on the pads, worked away towards deep mid-wicket. Before deep square leg can get to it, there's an easy couple"
"short, goes back to drive this hard, but cannot beat cover-point"
"fuller, driven with the turn towards long on, one of the men in the deep for spin now"
"length, around off, and he defends after covering for the spin away from the bat"
"sets up for the reverse sweep, and McBrine drops it a touch shorter. Eventually plays a slog across the line, and gets it over point. Cannot find the fence, though"
"back of a length, guided to third man after getting on top of the bounce"
"short, and he moves across his crease to create some room on the off-side. Young follows him with the line, and he is able to shovel this away through mid-wicket"
"short again, and he backs away and swats this hard. It is off the top of the bat, but almost a forehand crosscourt, as it goes over mid-on. Couple of bounces to the fence"
"back of a length, decent pace as it hurries through him and goes through to the keeper"
"short again, tucks him up for space. Didn't know a lot about what to do with it. Just taking his glove, on to his leg as he was hopping to evade this, and dropped by his feet"
"short of a length again, and he looks to back away and slog this towards mid-wicket. Edged, but goes just beyond Young, and lands towards mid-on. Single can be pinched by the time this is fielded"
"length, played with the turn towards point"
"length, angles into him from around the wicket. He backs away and punches this through the cover region. Fetches him two"

"length, presses forward to defend this"
"length, and he clears his front leg, and then goes over wide long on. Clears the boundary rope with ease in the end"

banged in halfway down the pitch. He can duck out of the way
"length, driven back towards the bowler"

"length, line around off, and he defends with a forward press"
"fuller, uses his feet to get closer to it and also to create some room on the off side. Extra cover drive, and doesn't bother to keep it down. Goes over the in field, and beats sweeper cover"
"a rerun of the shot, but better placed this time. More power, and better timing. No chance for the sweeper in the deep"
"tries to sell a dummy with some shuffling across before the bowler delivers, but Simi keeps it on a decent length around off, and he ends up playing towards silly mid-on"
"<strong>there's the breakthrough!</strong> No maiden ODI hundred for Hashmatullah, but this is smart bowling by Simi. Knowing that the left-hander is perhaps eager to get some big hits going in search of three figures, tosses this up, but shortens the length a touch. He goes across the line but gets a top edge. It goes looping behind the bowler, and long off gets across to his left and takes a good diving catch"
"defends a length ball, angling into him, towards cover"
"short, pulled away in front of square to the sweeper in the deep"
"<strong>fifth ODI century for Rahmat Shah!</strong> It's a length ball, but just strays on to the pads. He hangs back and just gets a decent enough tickle down to fine leg. Takes his helmet off, and acknowledges the polite applause of his teammates. Dropped a bit of a dolly right at the death when Afghanistan were fielding, but he's been quite flawless in this second innings"
"drives a length ball, which has offered him some width outside off, towards deep point. Easy two"
"<strong>dropped at point!</strong> Back of a length again from McCarthy, and he looks to guide this over point, but cannot keep it down. It's a diving attempt from Tector there, away to his right, but he cannot hold on to it"
"now Asghar gets dropped! Short ball, looks for the short-arm jab, and gets it up the air. McCarthy can only shake his head in disbelief as deep backward square leg moves in swiftly, but cannot latch on. Perhaps the setting sun getting into the fielder's eyes?"
"length, goes back to work it off his pads towards square leg"
"looks to sweep one from outside off. Struck on the pads, but impact would have been outside off"
"length, jabs down on it with a defensive prod"
"length, driven down the ground towards long on"
"bowled from closer to the stumps, around off, and he sweeps from a length, but cannot beat short fine leg"
"works this towards short mid-wicket. They consider a single, but good that they don't follow through with that, as the fielder moves in swiftly"
"short, and he gets into a good position early, moving across his crease and deep inside it. Swatted away through the mid-wicket region. No attempt to keep it down"
"short again, and this is <strong>even bigger than the previous one</strong>! Just not enough pace either on this wicket or from McCarthy's action. Afghan goes back and smacks this a bit more fine this time. Almost ends up treading on to his stumps, but does well to keep himself away from them"
"six to finish? No, this time it drops just short of the deep backward square leg fence. Still short from McCarthy and these are easy pickings for Asghar"
"fuller, around off, and he looks to flick this away. Hits it on to his leg, and it drops to the off side, and they pinch a single"
"full, driven towards mid-on"
"yorker, jammed out and back towards the bowler"
"length, driven towards short mid-wicket"
"length, down the pads, and he works it off his pads towards deep square leg, and <strong>that's the series win for Afghanistan</strong>"
