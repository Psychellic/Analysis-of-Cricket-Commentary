<b>uses the pace</b> and runs it tot the backward point boundary. Short of a length ball doesn't rise up too much but there's width. He stays low and opens the face very late. There's no one fielding square on the off side

"<b>dropped!</b> Stuart Thompson at short extra has put down a complete sitter. Opens his eyes wide as he looks down in disbelief. Dockrell had Ishan reaching out and feebly chipping this full ball outside off, straight to him but he jumps early as this lifts up towards his chest and fluffs it"

<b>in the air</b> but past Dockrell's dive to the left! So close. He's beaten in flight after stepping out. Goes through with the drive and it's knee height between the non-striker and stumps
"length on leg stump, flicked to deep square"
"length at off stump, defended off the back foot"
"shot! That's a difficult shot to execute on this pitch - on the front foot, arms away from the body - but Rahmat has got the timing spot on. Length ball wide outside off and he punches on the rise to bisect cover and short extra"

"tossed up on leg stump, he stretches forward to smother it"
spots it pitching outside leg stump and so ignores it altogether
brings his bat down in front of his pad - without really moving his feet - but he's well set enough to get away with those indiscretions
"draws him forward with a flighted delivery on leg stump, but Rahmat is solid in defence again"
"'oooh,' is the shout from the Irish close-catchers but it's unwarranted as Rahmat blocks one on leg stump"
quicker and shorter - the change in length draws Rahmat into a big shot but it's onto him a little too soon for the pull shot to work properly
lovely drift away from the right-hander as McBrine tosses it up. Ihsanullah lunges forward to defend
stays back to deal with the flatter delivery on middle and blocks
good stride towards the pitch of the ball on off stump and pushes to the left of the bowler
"lures him to play outside off stump again with his drift, but Ihsanullah's reading the length well, and showing great restraint"
steps forward and blocks outside off
loopy delivery - it's actually way too full - and Ihsanullah blunts it in front of off stump
"at first glance, it seems too full to sweep, but Rahmat controls it superbly to bring up his second fifty-plus score of the game. Replays, though, clearly indicate the ball gives him enough leverage to the swing the bat across it - even if he was taking a risk, sweeping out of the rough"
""
"looks to defend a slow, tossed up delivery outside leg and gets a bit of an inside edge. Agonisingly for Ireland, it doesn't carry to short leg"
presses forward to block on leg stump
looking to bowl into the rough means he'll have to pitch it outside leg and Rahmat is happy to kick it away
"tosses it up on leg stump, Rahmat stops it from going further"
"loooads of flight outside off again and Ihsanullah is lulled into drying, and the dip on the ball makes him mistime to cover"
shimmies down the pitch and basically yorks himself
"<b>beats the inside edge</b>! It's the drift. That sexy drift. The ball hangs in the air outside off, tempting Ihsanullah to drive away from his body, suckering him to bring out the gap between bat and pad. Then the ball bites into the pitch and turns through to the keeper, missing off stump"
rocks back to the flatter ball and whips it to midwicket
"thunders down the track - making room to open up the off side - and clatters the tossed up delivery through extra cover. Brutal, and fairly effective"
"loops it up outside off, Ihsanullah blocks"
strides forward to face the delivery pitching full and outside leg and defends it well
"steps out of his crease to reach the loopy delivery on the full, preventing it from pitching in the rough outside leg and also smoking it to the midwicket boundary. Positive batting. Brilliant batting"
defends on leg stump
"pitches outside leg, so Rahmat lets it hit him"
another shimmy down the pitch helps him get to the ball on the full and flick to long-on
opens the face as he steers the flighted delivery on middle stump through cover point
"there's a deepish mid-on lurking, but Ihsanullah is buoyed by how close the target is. He can almost reach out and touch it, so he'll take the odd risk. Especially if he knows he can play shots like these, he prolly will. Charges of his his crease and launches Dockrell wide of mid-on"
goes back to the predictably shorter ball and blocks
lunges forward outside off to defend
"<b>magnificent</b>! He's down the pitch again, this time with the bat face perfectly straight, allowing his power to flow through, and it takes the ball clean over the straight boundary"
""
"this one's short and Ihsanullah is waiting for it, rocking back, making room and clattering it through the covers <b>Fourteen runs off the over</b>"
"tosses it up on leg stump, Rahmat blocks"
scampers down the pitch again but this time Dockrell spots it and fires the ball in to cramp Rahmat. The batsman has to twist himself inside out to defend it
"too short, and with him targeting outside leg, at that rough, this is hit-me bowling. And Rahmat does his bit, pulling the ball over midwicket"
"full and on off stump, drives to cover"
"cramps the advancing batsman again, but Rahmat is good enough to keep this one out too"
"loops it up on leg stump, Rahmat keeps it out. <B>FYI, these two have put on 100-plus together now and the target is only 37 away</b>"

"tosses it up on middle, Rahmat blocks"
"steps back to block a short of a length ball on middle and, as it skips behind square leg, he goes through for the single"
gets forward to block outside off
"full toss, which he drags from outside off, all the way to wide long-on. <b>That's a maiden Test fifty for Ihsanullah</b> and he'll want to be there when the winning runs are scored. <B>Thirty-two away now</b>"
"tosses it up on leg stump, he stretches forward to block"
<b>turn</b> but it's too little too late. Ihsanullah is squared up as he tries to block but the length ball pitching in the rough rips across him and hits his back thigh
goes for the sweep after seeing the ball on a length outside off and hammers it to long leg
"tosses it up on leg stump, defends"
pitches way too far outside leg - so much that we have the elusive Test match wide
"tosses it up on leg stump, Rahmat blunts it"
"keeps back to a ball on a good length and, because of that slight miscalculation, he has to hurry into his defensive push"
"<b>big turn again</b> but Ihsanullah brings out the soft hands, not following the ball as it breaks away from him, and bounces sharply too. Defends off the back foot and yanks the bat away too so that a dangerous delivery is smothered well short of slip"
"full toss on middle, he whips it to deep midwicket"
"tosses it up on middle, blocks"
"flighted delivery on middle, easily kept out"
presses forward to block outside off
lifts it over cover
"<B>appeal for caught and bowled</b> but it's relatively half-hearted The batsman had come down the track, but he'd hit it straight into the ground"
"full on leg stump, defends"
pads up to the ball pitching outside leg. Needless appeal from the Irish
"steps into the leg side to slice the good length ball on off stump behind point. Good work from Balbirnie, chasing it down even though it seems like the match is gone"
sweeps the ball on his pads strongly to deep square leg
"shimmies down the pitch, but Dockrell pulls the length back, beats him in flight and secures an inside edge"
lunges forward to the pitch of a full ball outside off and blocks

chops the short of a length delivery outside off through the covers
"lobs it up on off stump, he drives towards mid-off"
digs out a yorker on off stump

flicks a shortish delivery on leg stump through square leg
"half an appeal for lbw from Dockrell, but he's been pitching it well outside leg, so it won't be out"
"full toss on leg stump, Ihsanullah sweeps it powerfully to deep square leg"
goes back to block a good length ball on leg stump
charges down and plonks a tossed up ball back to Dockrell
"shortish and outside off, he rocks back and cuts to the right of point"

fires it into the pads and Ihsanullah is able to flick it through midwicket
"full on off stump, defends safely"
"full on off stump, Rahmat keeps it out"
"full and outside off, slices it to cover"
"makes room and cuts an offbreak that seems to deny him the room for this shot, and yet Ihsanullah and his spectacular hands, make a mockery of it all"
"full and outside off, he drives into the covers"
"<b>turn and bounce</b> but Ihsanullah backs away again, adjusts to the ball's misbehaviour, and slices it behind point for another boundary. Classy batting"
"tosses it up on off stump, he blocks"
nudges a flatter delivery on off stump to square leg
"supremely hit. Rahmat again showing class, slinking deep in his crease to deal with a short and wide delivery and slapping it through extra cover. Doesn't overhit, but always seems to put the bad ball away"
"tosses it up on middle, he blocks"
"oooh, he's got the worst luck! Missed his century in the first innings by two runs. Falls with Afghanistan three away from a historic win. Poor Rahmat. He did all the hard work and now with the target one hit away, he goes for that one hit, running down the track and being deceived by the change in length from Cameron-Dow. Swings wildly anyway, all across the line, is beaten by the turn and stumped fairly easily"
"<b>he's run-out</b>! Oooh, this is silly. And he knows it is, walking back, hitting the air with his bat. Having played a deft little sweep shot, he gets greedy and wants two. Fine leg runs back and to his left quickly enough to stop that and the throw at the strikers' end is pin-point too."
"a rasping pull shot over square leg, racing away to the boundary and Shahidi will go down in history as the man who struck the runs that brought Afghanistan's first Test match victory. Punches the air in triumph, goes over to hug his partner, Ihsanullah, and they both soak in the moment."
