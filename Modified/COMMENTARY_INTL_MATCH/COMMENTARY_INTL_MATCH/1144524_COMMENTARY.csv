gets well forward and offers the bat to stab it away

beaten for pace as this cuts back in to hit him on the thigh pad. Gayle was looking to nudge it into the leg side
left alone as this is angled across.
makes room and slaps this back past the bowler. Although I'm not sure that's where he wanted to hit it. Lined him up as he was going to go over mid-on. He'll take the runs nonetheless

"drifts into middle, defended to short midwicket"

"angles in to beat the inside edge and hit him on the pad, sliding down leg"
"squeezes this off a thick edge to short third, looks for  single but is sent back"
off a thick inside edge to deep square
beauty! Squares him up and beats the edge with late away movement
"got him! Gayle has lost patience and his wicket in the process. Looked to back away to open up the off-side and swing big, but Dawlat saw him do that and fired this wider. Gayle looked to reach out to carve it away but ends up nicking it behind. Surely the last time we've seen Gayle at the 50-over World Cup."

"fuller and straighter, drifting in from wide of the crease, defended back"
punched to long-on for an easy single
"<b> Rashid has put down a sitter at midwicket! </b> Hope's despondency as he played the shot was all too evident. Flicked this straight to Rashid. In and out. He can't believe it, no one can. Almost as if it was too easy to be missed. Oh, dear."

"races off a thickish inside edge to square leg, looked to get on top of the bounce of this short delivery again"
"length outside off, left alone. On the bounce to the keeper"
"squirted off the inside edge to long leg. Was looking to flick, this one just beat him for pace, rushed him into the stroke"
"flicked wide of short fine. Off the backfoot. Went back, across and then twirled his wrists to hit up and over."
"driven firmly to mid-off, quick single taken"
"helped along, way over deep square! Too short, sliding in and Lewis swivelled back and played the pull with supreme confidence"
"punched to cover, who parries it to mid-off"
"full on the stumps, swung away a hint, he pushes this to mid-off and scampers a quick single. Good ball that, had the potential to cause trouble."
"lovely angle once again, full and slanting away to create the doubt. Hope initially looking to drive but lets it go in the end"
"wild swipe at this full ball, beaten. <strong>So not like Hope</strong>"
punched to cover point
"huge appeal for caught behind. Did it come off the pad? Ikram is pretty confident but Afghanistan decide against it. Well, that's a scoring opportunity missed. Any amount of bat would've been enough to tickle it fine. Great take down the leg side though."
defended into the covers

"short, and wide, and he smashes this towards cover, but cannot beat the man there"

"slower ball, angles across him, and he tries to get this towards fine leg, but cannot beat short fine leg"
"full, and he drives this straight down the ground. Terrific effort by the man at mid off, diving away to his left to keep the scoring down"

"slower ball, and he defends this towards point"
<strong>OH LOVELY!</strong> Just skips down the track and offers the full face of the bat as he swings a length ball from Nabi straight back over the sightscreen

"length, and he goes back and punches this towards deep midwicket"
"fuller, wider, and Lewis watches this through as it turns away from the footmarks"

"skids back in to hit him on the pad, missing leg. Belated appeal more out of hope"
gets forward and pats it back
"got into a terrible, terrible tangle trying to sweep. Huge appeal from the bowler and Afghanistan review. I think he's gone. This was fired in full, drifted in a hint and Lewis completely misjudged the length. Went through with the sweep but surely he knew then and there that he was dead the moment this hit the pad. Wonder why the umpire didn't give it out initially. Oh dear, oh dear. Guess what? Impact comes back as <b> umpire's call </b> and I promise you this was not more than one millimeter outside off on impact. How lucky is he to survive? Mujeeb can't believe his luck. Ball tracking says this would've smashed middle and leg."
"edged and it races past slip and short third man. Genuine edge there, hands on hips for Rashid"
"pulled over midwicket, bullet hit to the fence. He dropped short and Hope picked up the length very early"
"rocks back and pulls to deep square, no timing this time"
tucks this gently into the leg side
"guess what? Rashid's got Lewis with a buffet ball. Absolutely short, begging to be smacked. Lewis rocked back to open up the leg side and pulled, but the timing was off. Got it off the toe end and the long-on fielder ran in to take an excellent catch. It's that man Nabi, who at 34 is still as fast as they come in the outfield. Excellent anticipation, he was on the move as the ball lodged in his hands but had complete control."

gets well forward and blocks
punched to long-off
tucks this wide of short midwicket for a quick single
off a thick inside edge back to the bowler

"length on middle and leg, turns this gently into the leg side"
"slower and fuller outside off, defended back"

"as a result of that, he fires this one full, pushed into the covers"
copy book forward defense
swing and a miss. Went for the almighty heave but this one dipped. Stumping appeal but the back foot didn't move an inch. So it's all good. Not out.
"length, and he punches this away towards square leg"
"slower ball, outside off, and he cuts this towards backward point"
"short, and he rolls his wrists to get this past the leg umpire, towards deep square leg"
"slower, in the channel outside off, and he runs this towards point"

goes back and punches a carrom ball towards point
"full, on leg stump, and he times a flick straight towards midwicket"

"beaten outside off stump with a fuller ball. He goes back to defend this, and misses out"
"turns back into him, and he punches it away towards point"
"short, and good pace on it, which surprises Hope as he shapes to pull. Hits his midriff and drops to the on side, and they cross over for a leg bye"
"length, and he places this to the right of short fine leg. Cleverly played, as it also gave enough time to pick up two before deep square leg could converge on that ball"
"full, angles in, and he flicks this towards deep midwicket. There's a bit of work for the fielder there, but it has travelled quickly enough to limit them to just one"
"length, angles away, and he punches this towards long on. Shinwari at midwicket dives to his left, but cannot cut it off"
"short, and he whacks this wide of deep midwicket. Rashid Khan does well to get across to his right, pick it up with both hands, dive and send the throw in"
"length, drives it back towards the bowler"
"shorter, and he goes back and drives this towards long on"
"length, and he drops it towards point"
"goes back to a quicker one, and strikes him on the pad as it hurries through him. Runs down towards fine leg. They choose not to review. <strong>It was close, though!</strong>"
"oh, a direct hit chance at the non-striker's end. Played off the back foot towards short leg, and keeper Ikram gets to it. Hetmyer comes down a long way, but is able to scamper back"
"miscues an attempted sweep. They are able to get a single as it softly goes towards square leg. There's a direct hit at the non-striker's end, but Hope is home and dry"
"<strong>CATCH MISSED!</strong> Hetmyer loses patience and goes for a slog sweep. The top edge takes it miles up in the air, and the only player who was close enough to it was Shinwari at midwicket, but he was running back. Couldn't position himself close enough to that, and in the end, I doubt he got enough on it. Rashid comes close a couple of times to nabbing Hetmyer, but just can't!"
"short ball, angles in to him, and he drops it at the stumps. Hetmyer calls him through for a quick single"
"short, and he plays this away towards deep midwicket"
"<strong>straight drive, on the up, for six!</strong> It's a length ball, just outside off, and he presses forward and just goes for it. Full swing of the arms, good follow through, and it goes deep over long off"
"shorter, wider and he smacks this towards deep point"
"<strong>TERRIFIC TAKE AT MIDWICKET!</strong> Zadran bangs one in the centre of the pitch, and Hetmyer takes up the invitation to go for a full-blooded pull, but cannot place it wide enough of substitute Noor Ali Zadran, who dives away to his right and takes a specy!"

"length, and he flicks this away from the stumps, towards midwicket"
"slower ball, angles across him, and he pushes this towards deep point"
"length, and he drives this crisply through midwicket. It's a long enough boundary, for long on to be able to cut it off. Delightful timing on that, though"
"slower ball, full, and he looks to go over midwicket. Seems to have struck him, but in an angle going down leg. Zadran tries to convince Naib to go for the review, but they choose not to"
"full, wide and he slaps this hard towards deep point"
"Hope goes back to a length ball, and smacks this along the ground past cover. Should have been cut off by mid off, but it just kept rolling and moving swifter from Asghar Afghan!"
"full, outside off, and he smacks this hard and high over the bowler. Through past mid off, and one bounce into the long off fence. <strong>Great intent by Hope!</strong>"
"angles into him, and he flicks this away towards square leg"
"<strong>HOLES OUT TO DEEP MIDWICKET!</strong> Nabi just gets it to hang in the air a bit, and Hope tries to go for the slog sweep but doesn't time it well enough to clear the deep midwicket fence. A grateful Rashid Khan has just take a couple of steps forward to complete the catch. Two set batsmen have given their wicket away in succession for West Indies, as Afghanistan chip away with wickets"
"angles across Holder, and holds its line. Beaten outside off, and Alikhil whips the bails off too. But he was inside the crease"
"full ball, driven back to the bowler"
"length ball, and he walks across and whips it away towards deep square leg, one leg in the air"
"length, angles away, and he defends this to point"
"fuller, wider, and he drives this hard, but cannot get it past cover"
"length, jags back at him, and beats him as he plays outside the line. Trickles away to covers. Would have missed the stumps because of height, and hence just a stifled half-appeal from the bowler"
"length, angles away from him at <strong>123kph</strong>, and he plays it away towards third man"
"<strong>DROPPED!</strong> This is another change-up, and he looks to whip this over midwicket, and it almost carries to hand! Just tipped over, and they pick up a single. Tough chance, but Shirzad deserves some reward for a good second spell"
"turns into him, and he eases this towards long on"
"shorter, and he goes back and cuts this away to the right of deep point. Good bit of fielding to keep it down to two from Rashid Khan"

"angles across from around the wicket. Holds its line, and beats the outside edge"

"length ball on middle, eased past the bowler"
"rolls his wrists nicely to pull this into the gap at deep square. Too short, too slow and too easy"
"off the pad, rolls to the keeper."
pulled all along the ground to deep midwicket
"slower delivery on the pads, would you believe it if I say he only nudged it a little past short midwicket, but strolls back for the second. Sure, the fielder had to run in from the ropes, but the bowler could've done a lot better there.  Eventually by the time he took off, the second was on. He was also limited by the fact that there was no one backing up. Very poor from Afghanistan"
beaten as he rocks back to cut
"another cut, another miss"
"this time he gets a thick edge, no slip, so it rolls to short third man. Again looking to cut but this one skid through and kept drifting away. Can't call that a chance for the keeper, even though it deflected off his gloves"
driven into the gap at point
taps it gently into the leg side as they complete the single
"off the pad, lobs high but the keeper can't get there. Thought they'd belt out an appeal but it appears to have taken an inside-edge. Very close, plumb even if that wasn't the case."
"makes room and lofts this length ball cleanly over extra cover. Beautiful, everything about that had class written all over it"
"reverse paddle, not properly controlled but they'll get a run"
"carrom ball drifting into middle and leg, worked towards deep midwicket"
"reaches out to drive but misses, too full this time from Mujeeb. Lucky to get away"

makes room and punches this to sweeper cover
turns this with the spin to deep midwicket
leading edge but safe. Looking to whip this across the line
lofted and hit very very well. Clears long-off. Not a full delivery by any means but Holder uses his reach to make it seem like one as he swings it over the ropes.
"shortens his length, Holder gets a thick inside edge as he looks to punch through midwicket, races past short fine leg"
"lofted, one bounce to long-on"
"brilliant, simply brilliant. Just lands in front of those hospitality boxes at cow corner. Cleared his front leg and swung this length ball across the line to clear the ropes quite effortlessly"
full toss which he flicks one bounce to Rashid at deep midwicket
"drifting down leg, he sweeps, gets a tickle, races to the boundary. The wheels are well and truly coming off Afghanistan here"

"scythed through point, no one moved. Cracking stroke, too short again"

drilled to deep cover
"pulled but doesn't quite get hold of it, down to deep square"
he's belted this slower delivery one bounce into the gap between wide long-on and deep midwicket
leading edge that rolls back past the bowler for a single
"<strong>don't bother looking for that! </strong> Those at the far end may have sprained necks if Holder continues to hit like this. Slower ball, makes room, clears his front leg and swings to clear deep midwicket again. Massive hit"
"eased back to the bowler, who lazily puts his boot out to stop but can't and they get a second even though the ball went no more than a few yards from the turf towards mid-on."

turns this gently towards midwicket
"makes room to club this inside-out, misses."
"backs away and cuts over point, the ball plonks and appears to stop but the fielder labours behind the ball, eventually pulls it back in but hey, <strong>Pooran has a half-century</strong>"
"squeezes one and this races off a thick edge past short third man. Angled his bat, sure but did that go where he intended? Me thinks not."
"fired full on leg stump, beaten as he looks to flick, they'll squeeze a leg bye"
"makes room and belts this low full toss over wide long-on. Went for the yorker, misses his length and then saw this sail over. The Big Jase is having fun. Clean striking right out of the top drawer. He's a superb batsman to watch"
leaves but can't be given a wide. Full straight and well inside the wide line
slices this full toss to deep point
"gets more elevation than distance, or so it appeared,  but boy this has cleared long-on. Backed away and flat-batted this short ball"
"slower bouncer, let it go thinking it'd be called wide. The keeper fluffs it as he tries to stop it with his pads, byes"
"looks to scoop it over short fine, misses"
"works this full delivery down to long-on, excellent running"
"swings, misses, rolls to the keeper. The non-striker takes off for a bye, the captain stays his ground, and it's a run-out at the bowler's end. Pooran ran the entire length of the pitch and turned back. Now, he can continue heading back to the change room."
"heaved across the line and it's an easy catch to the man coming in from deep square. Mistimed this, also didn't pick the pace on this slower ball."
"taps it gently to point, no run."
"clean strike, monstrous from Carlos! Backs away and drills this up and over long-off"
"thick edge, flies between keeper and short third man"
straight through the captain's hands at long-off. Bounces into the ropes. What should've been a wicket is now a boundary. He used the depth of the crease to get under the length and wallop this straight. The sun may have got in Gulbadin's way.
"length, moves back a touch, and he punches this towards cover"
"length, swings back in, and strikes hm on the pads as he hops to defend. The height would have saved him, as Cottrell wonders if there was a need to review this"
"fuller, swing back in, and goes off the inside edge and goes off towards square leg"
"fuller, wider, and he drives towards cover"
"full, angles across him and beats the outside edge"
"fuller, and he drives it square, but cannot beat point"
"short, from wide of the crease, and he defends from the crease, hopping to cope with the extra bounce"
"shorter again, and this time he slogs it away behind square on the leg side. Waits for it, and connects well, rocking back to transfer his weight as he hits that"
"<strong>GONE THIS TIME!</strong> A bit fuller, and wider, and Naib goes for the slog again, and the bat skews in his hand and carries towards the man at square leg. No mistake from Lewis, and Afghanistan are rocked early in a massive chase"
"short, and he hooks this away from in front of his face, and this races away towards the long leg fence. Sheldon Cottrell dives away to his right from fine leg and saves this. <strong>Superb fielding!</strong>"
"fast, and angles away from him as he shapes to drive"
"short, at the legs, and he drops this towards square leg. Wants two, but thinks the better of it, as Roach chases it down himself"
"fuller, on the pads and he drives this towards mid on"
"full, down the pads, and takes his pads as he shapes to flick. Hope gets down low to his right to stop this from running away towards the fine leg boundary"
"short, outside off, and he runs this down past point towards third man"
"short, tucks him up as it comes into him, and he jumps to defend towards covers"
"short, and he looks to pull. It gets a bit too big on him, but he is able to get it past short midwicket. They go through for a hurried single, before mid on can field this"
"length, and he runs it off the outside edge towards third man. Does well to keep it wide of the man at slip"
"length, angles away from Ikram, who jumps to defend this towards covers"

defends a full ball towards off stump to covers
"length, and he goes back and punches this towards point. Half-stop, but that will allow a single"
"length, strays down the pads, and he plays this away wide of short fine leg. Good shot to place it to the right of the man there"
"short, and he looks to hook, but that was too fast for him. Goes through to Hope. Gayle seems to want to convince Holder to review this. Seems to be all for fun, actually"

"fuller, wider, and he drives this uppishly, but between cover and mid off. Gets two off it"
"short, and he looks to hook this away. A little sliver of excitement as it passes the batsman through to Hope, but called wide, and nobody is complaining"
"length, just a bit wide, and he drives this past point. Terrific timing, and it runs away to the deep point fence for four. More positive from Rahmat Shah"

"length, jags back into him at 137kph, and he defends"

"gorgeous! The kind of shot that will leave you wanting to reach out for the replay over and over again. Nice and full, a half-volley by all means, and Rahmat brings his bat down in a lovely little arc and caresses it into the gap between cover and mid-off. Apologetic, VVS style. Timing and placement - top notch."

worked into the gap at midwicket
"rocks back and pulls to long-on, didn't time it as well as he would've liked. Was looking to hit it wider to find the gap to his right"
"lofted hit off the backfoot, Oshane at long-off ran in a bit too much and by the time he started running back, he knew this would elude him. Sloppy stuff"

"cut away and this races behind point. Runs flowing freely. Are they onto something? Lovely stroke, played it late and placed it very well"

defended from the crease again

pushed straight to point
"slower length ball on off, pushed to point again"

"<b> Oh, dear. What have you done, Sheldon Cottrell? </b> Makes a right royal mess at long-on. Simple chance. Had too much time, I thought, in the end. Ran in, settled underneath but somehow looked jittery as the ball descended. Massive slice of luck for Rahmat, who would've been cursing himself for playing that rash stroke. Looking to clear long-on. Why?"
"slower ball on middle and leg, tucked to short fine leg"
right behind the line as he defends
"steps out and drags this pull to short fine, direct hit at the striker's end and Rahmat was gone"

"skips down the track and drives him past a sprawling Gayle, down to long on"
"fuller, outside off, and he drives handsomely, but straight to cover"
"<strong>GONE!</strong> Slower ball from wide of the crease, and outside off, and Rahmat cannot keep a drive down. Chris Gayle gets down and holds it low in front of himself. Gayly and Brathwaite celebrate with some well-synchronized push-ups. Is that the twist West Indies needed?"

"length, angles into him, and he defends"

"<strong>slashed away to third man!</strong> The fielder, Cottrell, is inside the circle, and quickly runs back to stop this from goign for four. It was an intended cut, but went fine"

"length, angles into him, and he taps it to point and takes off. They make it through as Ikram responds quickly"
"<strong>PULLED AWAY FOR FOUR!</strong> Just a little short in length, and he was in perfect position to get this over midwicket. Just a couple of bounces and into the fence"

"shorter, and he cuts this hard, but straight to Allen at point"
"shorter, and he slaps this away to the left of point"
"full, down the leg side, and he flicks this away towards deep midwicket. Wants two, but Hetmyer is very quick to get to this"
"looks to sweep from outside off, misses out. They go up for the stumping, but it seems ok at first glance. <b>Oh no, it isn't!</B> Does he have the ball in his gloves, though? The ball seems to have moved out of his gloves when he breaks the stumps. That will be not out. Rahmat failed to capitalise on a life at 57, will Ikram be different?"
"slog-sweeps the next ball hard, but towards the man at deep midwicket. One bounce to the man there"
"length, goes back and defends"
"tries the reverse-sweep, overbalances, as Gayle fires it full and wide. Hope whips the bails off, but Najib has his feet rooted inside"
punches a fuller ball to covers
"full, punched to cover"
"fuller, at the pads, and he plays it away towards square leg. Wants two, but stays with one. No-ball, because they had four inside the circle. <strong>Lazy from West Indies!</strong>"
"fuller, outside off, and he slaps it hard, but straight towards mid off. Missed opportunity to pick up some free runs!"

"shorter, and he slaps this away towards Hetmyer at deep midwicket"
"looks to skip down the wicket, and he fires it in at his pads. Gets an inside edge towards short fine leg"
"<strong>lucky boundary!</strong> Slower ball, full, and he gives it a good swing. The slashed edge carries it just past Oshane Thomas at short third man. He moves quickly to his right, but cannot bend in time"
"slower ball again, and he rocks back and forces him out to the left of deep point. Some good running should have fetched them two"
"full from Gayle, and he slaps this away hard towards deep point"

"hits a full ball on the stumps hard, but straight towards cover"
"full, on the pads, and flicks it away, but goes to square leg"

"slower ball, just outside off, and he nudges it to the right of point. Good diving stop by the fieldsman there, but cannot prevent the single"

"straighter, slower, and he reads it well and flicks it off towards deep square leg"
"fuller ball, and he drives this to the left of wide long on. They go back for two. Excellent running!"
"slower, wider outside off, and he sweeps this away towards deep square leg"
"fuller, and he swats this down towards long off"
"looks for the sweep, and given out leg before. <b>He has chosen to review this!</B> It was full, but could have been darting down the leg side, unless it stays with umpire's call. There seems to be no inside edge. Perhaps a touch too full to have employed the sweep. It's three-reds, and that's the end of Ikram Alikhil! He's played his hand in bringing Afghanistan close, but this was a bad time to have gotten out, and to the part-timer. But what a moment for Chris Gayle, in what should be his last World Cup innings. A smart catch, and now getting a teenager on the verge of a famous century!"
"fuller ball, and he gets down and sweeps. Misfielded by the man at square leg. That went quickly, but should have been stopped!"
"<strong>looks like this is out!</strong> Asghar flicks this towards square leg. They look for two, but Gayle goes sprinting after that. That causes enough confusion to just slow up the two batsmen as they cross, and Najib is run out at the non-striker's by a sharp, flat throw from midwicket!"
"fires this flat, but down the leg side. Called wide"
"floated at middle, and he flicks this away towards deep midwicket. Settles for a single this time"

"slower ball, tossed wide of off, and he plays it towards point, but cannot beat the man"
"<strong>SLOWER, WIDER DOES THE TRICK!</strong> Nabi is sucked into going for a big shot, but slices it away towards deep point. Just got no distance, and Fabian Allen takes a comfortable catch, and Afghanistan's hopes sink further"

"angles across him, and he misses with an attempted swing down the ground"

"would be called a wide. Looking to go full, but down the wrong line"
"full, wide and he slaps this away towards deep point"

"slower ball, outside off, and he is a bit early as he tries to run this down to third man"
"<strong>slower ball, works again!</strong> Good catch too from Hetmyer running in from deep midwicket. Shinwari tries to go big again, but the change in pace foxes him. He has to fetch this from outside off, and can only skew it towards deep midwicket. He runs in about 10-12 yards, and takes this low in front of himself"

"length ball, angles away, and he punches this towards the extra cover fielder in the deep"
"angles away, slower ball, and he punches this towards deep backward point"
"<strong>HIT STRAIGHT BACK AT HOLDER!</strong> Moved across and smashed this away back towards Holder, but he just couldn't hold on. Hard to classify as a chance. At least two saved"

"slower, wider, and he slashes this away towards deep point"

"<strong>good catch at long off by Holder!</strong> Thrown wide and full again, and Afghan shimmies across to get to that - it would have been a wide if he had missed - and he looked to go inside out. Toe-ends it down towards long off, and West Indies do well to keep big Jason Holder there for this steepling catch. Perfectly balanced, even though he lost his shades"

"another wayward delivery, bowled way outside off. Very close to that wide line again, touch-and-go call"

"<b> dropped by Pooran at cover! </b> Had three attempts at that, messed it up bigtime. Full toss that Rashid wanted to hit over cover but didn't get the elevation."

"swing and a miss, beaten by the slower delivery"
"slower ball outside off, wanted to carve it behind but let it go thinking it'd be a wide"
"strong bottom-handed hit that seemed as if it'd clear the fence, but Holder times his jump to perfection as he pulls off another wonderful catch"
