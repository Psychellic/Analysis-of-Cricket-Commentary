"<b>bouncer</b> which Khawaja tries to hook away, but he's gonna need a stepladder for that. The Lord's hospitality doesn't quite go that far"
"<b>beats him again</b>! This time with good old fashioned line and length outside off. Khawaja has this habit of reaching out away from his body - because he rarely moves his feet, especially forward. And that time there's just enough away movement to beat the edge"
"goes for the magic ball, pitching leg and swinging away to take the leading edge. No such luck as Khawaja flicks the ball on the pads to deep square leg"
"goes round the stumps straight away to SS, who is only too happy to work with the angle and flick the fuller delivery from outside off down the ground past the right of the bowler"
gets across his stumps because he reads the short ball early and knows there's a sprawling gap at long leg. Good pull game plan. Good pull shot
"stays over the wicket - <B>with no mid-off</b> - and pitches the ball up on middle stump. Smith springs across and then, after teasing all of us with those rubber wrists, only defends. Boooo!"
"works it off his pads behind square leg. Too easy, even at Fergie's pace"
"<b>falls into the trap!</b> New Zealand had a leg gully lurking. They were going to attack SS with the short ball. They were hoping he'd flick one in the air and this guy can grab it. But this is a full blooded pull shot. This is coming off at a zillion miles an hour. And it's not even right at the fielder. A fielder who's already dropped two catches. Guptill doesn't care though. He spots the ball early enough. He dives to his left quickly enough. Sticks out his hand and  comes up with an absolute specy! This is going to be one of the catches of the tournament. Smith's copped the end of two of those now and New Zealand are now nice and snug in the driver's seat. The broadcast graphics say Guptill was only 17 m away from the batsman. Also, in terms of reaction time, he only had  0.6 seconds to pull off that miracle. #WOAH!"
"back of a length and outside off at 90 mph, Stoinis pushes into the covers"

<b>googly</b> to start and I'm not sure Khawaja picks it. Reaches out to defend and is comfortably beaten

"good length, outside off, no shot"
"<b>bounces him</b> and Stoinis can't get out of the way. How can he when it's 148 kph? He tries to ride it, getting up off his toes to drop the ball by his feet, but it still keeps climbing on him, takes the shoulder of the bat and lobs over to where short third man might have been"
144 kph bouncer angled at the body but Khawaja sees it early and lets it go

"brings down the flight a bit, but still keeps the length full. The bigger adjustment is in the line, dragging it outside off, and making sure Stoinis can only drive through the covers"
"drags it short and Khawaja has all the time in the world, and then some, to pull to deep square leg"
"<b>zips in off the pitch</B> looking for lbw, but Stoinis brings the bat down in time, and importantly it's straight. Sodhi's doing very well here"

"flatter trajectory outside off, Stoinis goes back to cut to cover point"
"keeps thudding 140+ kph deliveries into the deck, hoping to catch the batsman on the hop. Khawaja though won't be tempted into such silly situations"
works the length ball on middle to short midwicket.
lovely shot to cross 1000 runs in 2019. Stands tall against a back of a length delivery outside off and flays it behind point
"<b>caaatcch, they cry</b>... Williamson's the fielder, running up and to his left from mid-off. Goes for the dive. He's aaaaaalmost there. The hands reach out. Has he taken it? Have NZ done it again? Nooooo. The captain comes up and shakes his head. It's fallen short of him. Stoinis lives to drive on the up again"
"bouncer outside off, no shot from Stoinis"
"searing yorker to end the over, one that keeps coming in with the angle into the right-hander. Stoinis is alert enough to prevent it from rendezvousing with the stumps. <b>That's drinks</b> and this is very very fun."
"pitches the googly short enough that the left-hander can go back, read the turn off the pitch and tap it into the covers"
"a little too leg side this time, inviting the sweep shot and Khawaja is only too happy to oblige. Gets it nice and fine"
"shapes to sweep again, but the ball is a little too full, and a little too far outside off and so he has to adjust and tap it back to the bowler with a straight bat"
"crunches the short ball turning away from him through cover point. Good footwork from Khawaja, used the depth of the crease perfectly"
"doesn't read the googly and has to weather and <b>lbw appeal</b>. Would've been going down though. Sodhi pitches it on middle and the right-hander is setting up to hammer it through the off side, going deep in his crease, and it lands him in a bit of trouble"

"lovely flowing drive off the front foot, but he can't beat point."

"full and a lot closer to his body, allowing him to use a straight bat and hit to mid-off"
"another lovely hit, opening the face of the bat to try and get the gap to the right of mid-off. KW won't allow it"
"tentative block - and it's all because of that lovely loop from Sodhi. He's in good rhythm today. No long hops. And practically everything in that dangerous off stump line, spinning both ways"

stays back to deal with a length ball on middle behind square leg. Quick hands. Seriously quick hands
"uses his reach to get to the pitch of the ball outside off and drive to long-off. Lovely contest brewin, fellas."
"<b>doesn't pick the googly</b> and what's worse, he follows the ball turning the wrong way with his hands. With slip in place, that's quite dangerous. This time though Khawaja is able to keep the ball along the ground to point"
strays onto his pads and he sends it away to fine leg
walks right across his stumps and gets struck on the pads as he tries to flick the ball through midwicket. Khawaja is trying to one-up NZ's 6-3 off side field

full and very very wide outside off and he'll have to re-bowl that
"looks for the on the up drive but the 135 kph ball, on a good length and outside off, sticks in the pitch and <b>bounces awkwardly</b> on Khawaja. So much that he yanks the bottom hand away"
"with the batsman going so far across his stumps, Neesh tries to sneak a leg-stump yorker and take him out. Gets close but not close enough. Puts his hand on his mouth and the eyes bug out after the plan fails"
slashes a good length ball outside off to deep point
"<b>caught behind</b>! Neesh delivers an absolute peach. A cross-seamer that hits the deck. The line is close enough to off stump. The length though is in-between. Not full enough for the drive. Not short enough for the cut. Stoinis presses forward gamely, looking to block the ball out. But it's mischief not done yet. It decks away off the pitch, takes the outside edge and settles in the keeper's gloves. Top stuff."
"full ball, angles into him from around the wicket, and he defends this, pressed forward"
"slants across him, and he cuts this fine. The backspin puts it beyond the reach of Lockie Ferguson at the deep point fence"

"full, on to the pads, and he drives it towards the wide mid off"
"<strong>WHAT A CATCH!</strong> If you thought Guptill had one of the rippers for the day, Jimmy Neesham has just sent in his nomination for moment of the day!

"<strong>DROPPED!</strong> There's actually a slip now for Khawaja, and it eludes him too after coming off Latham's gloves. So unlucky for Neesham!

defends a good length ball on off stump to point
<b>unreal</b>! Ferguson loves bowling short. He's had success bowling short. But this is only 142 kph. And it's only above waist high. All of that essentially means it's in Carey's wheelhouse and he just stands tall and slams it over deep midwicket #LikeABoss
"shortish on off stump, pushes into the covers"
very very full - so much that it becomes a low full toss on middle. Khawaja drives to long-off
"<b>edged but safe</b>. Williamson has been teasing the left-handers with a lot of flight. Drawing them into the drive outside off. Carey's sucked into the trap, gets a very thick nick, Latham follows it, staying down and getting up with the ball, but he can't grab it in the end"

"full, fast and he drives this down to long on"
"<strong>short, and well-directed again!</strong> This was 143kph, and Cummins was caught in two minds. Wanted to come forward, and suddenly forced to duck by the angle of that sharp, incoming delivery"
"slower ball, outside off, and he stays rooted in the crease and sees that beat the outside edge. <strong>Bowled at 114kph</strong>"
"short, angles into him at <strong>145kph</strong> and he ducks under this"
"fuller, outside off, and he drives this to point, and takes the single on offer"
"floats this wide outside off, and beats a swat from Cummins"
"length, and he goes towards deep midwicket. Could have had four, but for Jimmy Neesham, who fields this down to his left"
"length, and he goes inside out. Drops short of long off"
"tossed up outside off, and he goes for it down the ground. Takes the leading edge, and this time <strong>it lands just short of long on</strong>!"
"length, and he swings this towards deep midwicket. To the right of Neesham, who nonchalantly knocks this back into play with his right hand. <strong>Superb fielding, but vital runs for Australia</strong>!"
"length, wide outside off, and he slaps this down to long off"
"wide outside off, and he drives this towards sweeper cover"
"<strong>precise yorker</strong>. Swings a bit late into him, and he can only dig it out towards cover"
"<strong>gets lucky!</strong> Charges down to a fuller ball again, and with the late reverse swing, it takes the inside edge and runs fine past Latham"
"backs away, and Boult shortens the length. Wants to go over point, but misses out on contact"
"swings into him from a full length, and he takes it on the full and drops it down towards long leg"
"short ball, and he moves away to the leg side and ramps it down towards third man. <strong>Cheeky!</strong>"
backs away to the legside and biffs a full ball down towards long on
"full, outside off, and he guides a <strong>143kph</strong> ball towards deep point"
"short, and he ducks under it. Decides late to try and run it down towards third man, but that had already passed him by then"
"short, and he drop-kicks this, one bounce towards long leg"
"full toss, outside off, and he looks to drive this down the ground. Outside edge runs it down to the right of third man, and they scurry through for the second"
"full toss, and this time <strong>he has pierced the infield</strong>! Backs away, and even takes the bottom hand as he muscles this through cover, and too fast for sweeper at the point fence to get to it. What a hand this is from Cummins..."
"low full toss, swinging back in, and he drives it down to long off. Bowled at <strong>144kph</strong>"
"fuller ball, around the stumps, and he can only tap it towards short midwicket"
"<strong>GONE THIS TIME!</strong> Perfect full ball again, delivered at 137kph, and with a hint of reverse again back in from outside off. Khawaja walks across to access the on side, but misses out on contact and in fact walks right outside the line of the ball. Vital half-century from Khawaja, though, as he acknowledges the crowd on his way out"
"<strong>OH YOU BEAUTY!</strong> We might get to see a bit of this from Starc later -- a perfect yorker, that swings in at good pace and goes under his blade even as he looks to jam it down. <em>Almost</em> as good as the ball that Starc delivered to Ben Stokes just a few days ago!"
"<strong>HE'S GOT IT!</strong> Full, swinging away from him after pitching around leg, and given. Australia have reviewed this! It's a perfect full length, and there's no sign of bat near that. The only question could be where it pitched, I would think. The bat hits ground, but that is after the ball passes through and crashes into his right foot. It's out, and that's a hat-trick for Trent Boult!"
"full, wide outside off, and he looks to back away to get this down to fine leg, but misses. Almost got <strong>FOUR IN FOUR</strong>!"
"<B>sweetly timed</b> to the left of mid-off. Good signs for Guptill, who sometimes seems suspect against left-arm quicks because of the ball coming back in. This one though just pitches on a length and carries on with the angle, allowing him to play that favourite on the up drive"
nicely behind the 132 kph delivery looking for the top of off stump
looks for the flick through square leg but ends up with a welt on his thigh (probably)
half a shout for lbw as Nicholls is stuck in his crease against one that nips back into him off a length. Miiiiiight just be too high
stands up nice and tall behind the shortish delivery on off stump and blunts it
"covers the line well and, it seems, he's started to move his feet as well. Gets across to off stump to get behind the short ball"
starts with a short ball across the right-hander at 143 kph. Keeps the slips interested. Not the batsman though
"<B>cuts back in</b>! Like a left-arm legbreak! Hits on and around off stump and then veers into Guptill, who is thinking he has an easy leave and in the end is struck on the thigh"
"<b>should I leave, should I play?</b> Should I even try? This is testing bowling from Australia's strike weapon. He gets his radar perfect. On and around off stump and that last ball jagging back so far is still playing on Guptill's head as he steps forward to play something in between a leave and a block"
"good stuff, Guppy! Waits for the short ball outside off, taps it gently on top of the bounce and says, Henry, you deal with Starc"
"slants into the pads <b>at 152 kph</b> and Nicholls, shuffling across his stumps, is hit on his pads. Would have gone down though"
dangerous ball! It's the one that he slings out towards the off side but in mid-air it curls back into the left-hander. Essentially the same one Stokes got. Except it isn't a yorker and perhaps that's why Nicholls is able to block it from crashing into his sticks
crunches the back of a length delivery outside off behind point.
"good length on off stump, Guptill keeps it out. Hmm. Might be jumping the gun but Behrendorff isn't getting much movement. And he's known for that"
"pitches it right up there, almost on yorker length, Guptill drives to cover"
very tight lines from Behrendorff. Guptill gets forward and defends a ball heading on to off stump
<b>screams away</b> through the covers. Guptill gets the room to free his arms and he's calm enough to slap it through the gap
bowler overcompensates for the mistake and goes down the leg side
<b>hints of movement into the right-hander</b> but Guptill is able to nudge it between midwicket and mid-on. Good connection because he wasn't trying to hit it too hard
onto him too quickly as he tries to flick the back of a length ball on middle behind square leg. Beaten for (142kph) pace
"<b>gets it to hold its line at 151kph</b> and Guptill does well, watching the ball all the way, getting squared up a touch so he can defend a ball pitching leg and moving away"
dangles it outside off. Guptill won't bite
goes searching for that inswinging delivery to take out Guptill's stumps. But the 145 kph veers off target
"back of a length and outside off, no need to bother with those. Just wave to the 152 kph white thing flying by"
"keeps out a good length ball at 147 kph looking for middle and leg stump. Who wants to be an opening batsman, eh?"
<b>half an appeal</b> from Starc as he gets a length ball to curl back into Guptill at pace. The right-hander is trapped. His front foot is too far across and he doesn't have the time to adjust. Only height saves him. These are nervy times.
<b>strays on the pads</b> and Guptill does the most decent thing that ball deserved. An all-expenses paid trip to the fine leg boundary
goes back in his crease to block the 134 kph short ball on middle
"137kph, punches the short if a length delivery outside off to point"
"<b>un-play-ABLE</B>! Guptill recoils from a ball that pitches on off stump, back of a length, one he thinks he has covered with a back foot block but one that nips away off the pitch like it's nobody's business"
"strong push into the covers, but that infield is definitely packed"
touch too straight and the batsman is able to work it to square leg
<b>beautiful straight drive</b>. Made all the more better by the fact the speedgun says this is 153 kph. Nicholls gets in line and presents the full face so that a ball looking to take over his stumps instead crashes into the boundary boards
that's his shot. The flick off the hips. He plays it with his eyes closed and with one hand making the Spock sign. Too straight. Touch too short. Simply put away
146 kph - no one bowls a full delivery at the stumps like Starc. That curl away when the ball leaves his hand. The curl in as it travels the pitch. Nicholls is aware of the danger and is playing with as straight a bat as possible
"bouncer on off stump, lets it go, ump says it's too high"
<B>off the shoulder of the bat</b> to point as Nicholls tries to get on top of a rising delivery on off stump. The only problem is it keeps rising.
<b>154 kph scorcher!</b>. Could be the fastest ball of the Cup. But he picks the line early and lets go a good length ball outside off.
"147kph, full on off stump, Nicholls brings that bat down well in time"
144 kph on a good length and outside off. Guptill lets it run off the outside half of the bat to third man
gets just enough movement away from the bat as Nicholls steps forward to defend a fuller delivery on off stump. Bit of an outside edge to point
"<B>good leave</b>. Relies on that a lot in Test cricket. And here too, he covers the stumps to be safe from the ball nipping back in, which in this case is wise because it does just that"
<b>bouncer</b> which is allowed to climb over Nicholls' shoulder and go through to the keeper. Good stuff from Nicholls. Looks like he belongs. In a World Cup game. Against Australia.
<b>pins him on the pad</b> as Cummins gets his line perfect with the indipper. But it might just have been too high. Certainly was too quick for him as he gets his front leg too far across and gets caught with the bat having to come around it
"fullish on off stump, defends to cover"
"<b>huuuge appeal for lbw</b> as Behrendorff gets one to pitch on leg stump and nip in just the slightest bit. Guptill is caught with his front foot in the wrong place. The bat needs to come down around it and it can't make the journey in time. Australia think about the review, but they don;t go for it in the end. Worried about it going down leg, was Behrendorff and so Finch didn't go for it. Replays show it would have been umpire's call on hitting the stumps"
"fullish and outside off, defends"
"good length and outside off, taps it towards point"
"<b>definite movement</b> at this end for Behrendorff, Another lbw ball, pitching on middle and leg and nipping in at the right-hander. Guptill this time is able to get an inside edge"
pitches it up and tests both edges of the bat. Guptill is good enough to plant the middle of it on the ball though
"he almost falls over himself because of the late inswing, but because he is switched on, he's able to flick the ball on leg stump away through midwicket. NZ know they're in a fight. They know these first few overs are the biggest threat."
"solid defensive push from Guptill, into the covers"
"that was there! It was there for the Marty G slap over point. And he does go for it, backing away and giving it his all. But the Cummins bouncer beats him for pace"
another bouncer this time angled into the right-hander. Guptill evades it
full and curling into him. Guptill keeps his bat straight and pushes to mid-on
defends a good length ball outside off towards point
"fluent drive to mid-off, Guptill daring to put a little bit of his power into this shot because it's an overpitched delivery on middle"
"<b>beautyyyyyy</b>. Kisses the deck on middle and nips away from the bat, whistling over the off stump as it goes to the keeper."
<b>strangled down leg</b>. And he's walking off. A poor end to what looked like a promising innings as he tries to pull a short ball down to fine leg but in the end only gloves the ball through to the keeper
back of a length and darting away outside off. He lets it go
"looks for the lbw with a pitched up ball on off stump. Williamson though is so very good at making sure that front leg never goes across. It only ever stays beside the line of the ball so he can bring down a straight bat, which in this case helps an inside edge scurry away through square leg"
"good length on off stump, defends"
"ignores a ripe delivery on off stump, perfect for the on the up drive, and also for the nick behind. Ooooh, this is tense"
"length ball, angles in, and he plays it away towards square leg"
"length, outside off, and he taps it down with a typical KW dead bat"
"<strong>jaffa!</strong> A good length, just outside off, and moves away a touch off the seam, and goes past his outside edge as he looks to defend"
"length, outside off, and he is able to run a <strong>144kph</strong> ball down towards third man"
"short, and angles into him as it goes through to Carey. A half-appeal...may have just brushed his hip"
"length, hits the pitch really hard, and he presses forward to defend this"
"length, outside off, and he just stands up tall and <strong>punches </strong>this towards extra cover. <strong>Beautiful!</strong>"
"length, angles across him, and he defends"
"length, and he drops it with a dead bat and responds to Guptill's call for a quick single before point can swoop in on that"
"fuller, angling across him, and he drives it towards mid off"
"fuller, angles across him, and he plays it past Maxwell at point and they get through for a comfortable single. Would have taken him on anyway, as that was travelling to his right"
"length, straight, and he ticks it over towards deep midwicket this time"
"length ball, turns in, and he defends from the crease"
"fuller, angles across him, and he flicks it past short leg towards square leg"
gets down on one knee and slaps a length ball down towards long leg
"length, around off stump, and he defends"
"fuller, a bit quicker at <strong>88kph</strong>, and he goes back and defends this"
"fuller, angles into him, and he plays this with a dead bat towards Finch at short leg"
"full ball, angles into him, and <strong>given out leg before</strong>! Guptill chooses to walk. A bit of swing as it comes back into him. He gets his front foot around in front and cannot bring his bat down on time as he overbalances a touch. Behrendorff strikes again by bowling full. This is a vital breakthrough for the Australians"
"length ball, angles across him, <strong>flies off the shoulder of the bat towards third man</strong>!"
"length, nips away after pitching outside off, and he drops his wrists and sees it through to the keeper"
"a little short, and he jumps and tries to flick this away towards fine leg. Hits him on the thigh pad and drops at the wicket"
"fuller, on the pads, and he tries to flick this towards long leg. <strong>Came off the thigh pad</strong>!"
"fuller, and he drives it back, but Behrendorff fields"
"tossed up, and he taps it to the right of point and picks up a single"
"length, turns into him, and comes off his pads and pops up. Lands short of short leg anyway"
"fuller, and he pulls out the sweep. A fielder in the deep for that, and he runs to his right and sends in a flat return"
"length, turns into him, and he flicks this towards short midwicket"
"outside off, and he looks to defend this towards point. Very feeble touch, along the ground, fielded by slip"
"<strong>DROPPED?</strong> Tossed up outside off, and he saw his chance to drive <b>against the turn</b>. May have taken a bit of the bat, and part of Carey's right pad through to first slip, where the fielder fails to hold on. Steve Smith in position there"
"length, straightens into him, and he drives it back to the bowler"
length and he defends outside off. Goes off towards point
"length, and he drops it dead at his feet"
"length, and he cuts this but cannot beat point"

"tossed up, and he defends this outside his off stump"
"tossed up, and he flicks this from outside off, with the turn, but cannot beat short midwicket"
"looks to sweep from outside off, and paddles it down towards fine leg. <strong>Risky, but effective!</strong>"
"quicker, straighter, and he defends this towards point"
"length, outside off, and he lashes this through covers. The sweeper will cut it off ahead of the fence, out to his right"
"length, jags back into him, and he drops it right by his eyes. <strong>Caught by surprise by a bit of extra bounce in that!</strong>"
"<strong>DROPPED!</strong> Difficult chance through to Carey. This one from Behrendorff was an off-cutter, and moved away from Williamson, who chased it through. Off the toe-end, and dying on Carey, who gets a bit of a finger on it as it runs away from him towards third man"
"slower ball again, angles across Taylor, who reads it and defends this to point"
"length, angles across and he defends this towards point"
"length, angles into him and he plays it towards square leg"
"tossed up, and turns away from him. Beats the outside edge as he tries to drive"
"full toss, and he smacks it out towards sweeper cover"
"flatter, pitches around leg and strikes him on the pad. Didn't turn back in enough, and probably also pitched outside leg"

"another full toss, another shot straight to the sweeper deep on the off side"
"tossed up more, and he drives it well enough to get it past cover"

"length, and straight along the line across from leg to off, and he has to block this"
"length ball, defends towards short midwicket"
"slower ball, traps him on the pads as he shuffles across. Not given leg before, and Australia seem to believe that could have pitched outside leg. Another off-cutter"
"fuller ball, and slower through the air again at just <strong>120kph</strong>, and he plays it towards mid on"
"length, and he cuts it down to third man"
steps down the track to drive a tossed up ball to long-on
loads up the sweep as the ball slides into leg stump. Plays too early and cue-ends the ball towards midwicket
defends a flatter delivery on middle stump. Getting just a little grip is the Aussie captain
"steps down the pitch to try and whip the ball against the turn through midwicket, but turn is what Finch does, beating the closed face and hitting his pad"
"sweeps past short fine leg, the desperate dive doesn't work and New Zealand get a little bit of relief. Poor ball well down leg. Simple putaway, no fuss. And on we go"
"full on middle, drives to long-off"
shapes to pull the back of a length ball on leg stump but it doesn't quite come on and he mistimes it to the left of the keeper
"misfield at midwicket - Carey, I think - and it allows Williamson to sneak a second after a well played tap, right under his eyes"
blocks a back of a length delivery on off stump
slinks across his stumps to bully a good length ball outside off into the hands of deep square leg
"opens the face as he meets a shortish ball outside off, looking for a single to third man, but backward point hasn't been clued in on that plan"
"gets it to dart away - the legcutter gripping off the pitch - and Taylor follows the ball, steering it to third man with soft hands .Still risky though. A little extra bounce and he could have been caught behind"
"tosses it up on off stump, Taylor pushes it back down the pitch"
gently pats the flighted delivery on off stump into the off side
quicker through the air but still very full on off stump. Taylor works it to midwicket. Pressure keeps building
nudges a full ball on the pads behind square leg
"spots the length early, goes back and waits for the ball to turn, and only then does he tap it through square leg for a simple single"
lovely placement. Taylor plants the ball between midwicket and deep square leg with a simple nudge off the pads and his partner is awake to the second run
stands tall behind a shortish delivery outside off and turns it to mid-on
inside edge onto his boot as he tries to dab the ball to third man
<b>lifts it over deep midwicket</b>. A length ball on leg stump and Williamson decides to show off a bit. Sure I could have nudged it along the ground to square leg. Buuuuuut.... I'd rather hit the first six of the day. There! Boom!
"back of a length and outside off, dabs it behind point"
<b>bottom edge</b> scurries away past the right of the keeper. Williamson is trying the punch through cover but he's happy for the two nonetheless

looms over the tossed up ball outside off and flicks it through midwicket
"plenty of flight, luring KW into a hard-hit cover drive that bursts through the hands at short cover to bring up <b>6000 ODI runs. The third fastest to the mark</b>, three innings behind Kohli"

"over mid-off and into the boundary. Sure the ball is turning into him, but he gets a good stride going and there's plenty of width to free the arms"
taps it towards point
turns the length ball on leg stump through square leg
"slaps the short and wide delivery at 147 kph right through point, the timing good enough to draw the mistake from the fielder"
"<b>151kph</b>, tucks a fullish delivery on leg stump through midwicket and they scurry across for the second as well."
<b>caught behind</b>. One genius gets the other! And it's that dab. It's the go to shot. It's the one that feeds every one of his ODI innings. But not this one. The ball angling across the right hander - a cutter set up for the fourth slip - takes the edge as KW plays the dab and goes through to the keeper. Australia celebrate. Starc celebrates although should he reallly? He keeps taking so many wickets in his first over of a new spell that maybe he should just yawn and wave bye-bye to the other guy
<b>145 kph and it's coming at his throat</b>. Latham tries to lift it over midwicket but he is far far too slow with the shot
"flicks the full, inswinging delivery at 152 kph to deep square leg"
"closes the face too early and gets a leading edge through cover point. Gorgeous bowling from Lyon, round the wicket, drifting it into the left-hander and getting it to turn away, sharply"
"full and outside off, he smears it to the sweeper."
goes for the sweep and makes good enough connection for a couple to fine leg
"good length ball outside off, no shot"
"works a tossed up ball on off stump, against the turn, to deep midwicket"
"oooh, <b>the dip ruins the drive</b>. How often does Lyon do that. He lures the right-hander into driving against the turn, through the off side. And then dupes them in the air. Here the ball drops on Taylor, massively, and gets his inside edge onto pad"
"<b>150kph</b> back of a length and outside off, blocks to cover point"
"good length, outside off, no shot"
"148kph, goes for the bouncer on middle but Latham is happy to stand behind it and block"

"tosses it up on off stump, defends"
"short and wide, Latham slaps it past the right of cover"

"full and outside off, drives back to the bowler"
"<b>direct hit, has Latham made it?</b>. Ohh this is tight. And he just about gets in. Good dive. Full length. Bat grounded. Well done. So Taylor's little nudge to Maxwell is good enough"
"goes back to the length ball, opening up his hips so the bat can come down on top of the ball for a single to square leg"
"mis-hit as Latham brings his bat across, looking for a run through midwicket, but instead gets a bit of a leading edge to cover"
goes to pull a ball that isn't short enough or wide enough and ends up looking very very awkward. Not to mention the hit  to his body
"back of a length and outside off, defends"
"good length on off stump, he defends"
looks like an offcutter that grips and moves away from the left-hander. Latham is a bit squared up as he steers to third man

"short, angles away from him, and he steers it down to third man"
"<strong>RUNS OUT OF PATIENCE!</strong> Fuller ball, and he looks to go across the line and top-edges this behind the wicket. It hangs in the air <em>forever</em> but Carey positions himself well and takes it low down in front of him. What a time for Australia to get rid of Taylor!"

"<em>STICKS AND STONES MIGHT HURT HIS BONES, BUT BOOS WILL GET HIM A WICKET!</em> He loops one up outside off, and CdG has hit this high and straight down Khawaja's throat at wide long off. What a shame, off the first ball too! <b>Wicket for Smith!</b>"

The impact is fine, and the wickets stay with umpire's call. <strong>That's Starc now emulating his haul of wickets from 2015!</strong>"
"tossed up, and the <strong>extra bounce beats Santner</strong>!"
"tossed up, and he drives this towards covers"
"<strong>OH, WHAT A TRY!</strong> Santner sashays down the pitch and smacks it, trying to clear David Warner at mid on. Warner hops to his right, sticks his left hand out, and almost pulls off an absolute beauty!"
presses forward to defend a length ball
"length ball, defended to point"
"big turn, from outside off, across the batsman, and past Carey as well. Called a wide"
"length, and he cuts this away towards point"
"<strong>BOWLED HIM!</strong> Starc always attacks the stumps, and this time he was too quick and too accurate for Ferguson. Wicket no. 23 as he comes from wide of the crease, and Ferguson fails to get behind the line of this"
"honing in on the off stump, but Boult gets his bat down on it on time"
"short, and he backs away in trying to go down the ground, but misses out"
"full, and he backs away again, but can get some bat on it. Plays it back towards Starc, who takes it on the bounce over his left shoulder"
"full, and he backs away again and gets it towards point"
"full, backs away and gets an inside edge towards fine leg. Carey stops it"
"length, turns and stays low. Santner wants to drive this back, but it sneaks under his bat"
moves across and <strong>whacks this over deep backward square leg</strong>!
"length, and he goes back and wants to pump this through midwicket. Gets close to the inside edge, and it beats Carey, the bat and the leg stump on its way through to the fine leg fence"
"tossed up, and he drives this through point"
comes down the wicket and gets it towards long leg. They pick up two before the fielder there can come around to that position
"comes down the wicket and has a mighty heave at it. Trickles down towards deep midwicket, and Santner refuses the single to take on Starc"
"length, fast, and he backs away and has a swing, and a miss..."
"full ball, and he looks to flick this down towards fine leg. Goes off the thigh, but he refuses a possible single"
"full ball, and he drives this towards cover"
"<strong>short, and he holes out to fine leg!</strong> Starc has five, and Australia have crushed New Zealand in an imposing performance where they were on the back foot for the first hour and a bit in this contest. <b>Cricket, bloody hell!</b> It was short and quick, and Santner actually got inside the line of the ball and was looking to hook this towards long leg. The pace on the ball took the top edge and made it go finer, and Behrendorff made no mistake"
