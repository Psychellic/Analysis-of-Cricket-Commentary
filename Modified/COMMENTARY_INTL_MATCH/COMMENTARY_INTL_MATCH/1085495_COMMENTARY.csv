"loose delivery to start off, gives it too much air and offers up a full toss on leg, Shehzad gets down and sweeps it to deep backward square leg"
"and the bowler has the last laugh. Is that a brain fade or what? Shehzad, after a four first ball, decides to give the bowler the charge. The ball is not full enough, so he does not get to the pitch. Shehzad looks to forcibly push it. It straightens, beats the outside edge and rattles the stumps"
"fuller, comes forward and drives it out to covers"
"appeal for stumping, they go upstairs. Does that seem to be on the line? That is as close as it gets. And, in fact, the foot now seems to be in the air as the bails come off. Reckon this is going to be out. And out it is, so the experiment does not work. Coming to the delivery, it was pitched up and Badree was drawn forward. He looks to flick it into the leg side with the turn. But that's the googly, he misses the ball and overbalances nearly. The back foot comes off as he strides forward"
"sliding in with the arm, too full on leg, pushed down to long-on for one"
"googly, Akmal comes forward and defends. The ball goes off the inside edge to backward square leg"
"short of good length ball, angling in, tucked away with the angle"

"on a length, wristily flicks it from outside off into the vacant midwicket region for a brace"

tries to flick and wears it on the pad. Too high and the appeal is turned down

"full and angling in, clipped off the toes through square for one"
"length, outside off, opens the bat face late and drops it in front of backward point"

gets down for a scoop and guides it over the short fine leg region for two
"fuller, driven off the front foot to long-off"
short of a length and flat in trajectory. Kamran shapes up for a cut but gets cramped for room as it is the wrong'un
"and there's the legbreak. Spinning away sharply from a length, draws the batsman forward and gets it to beat the outside edge"
"short ball, it's the wrong'un again but this time Kamran reads it from the hand. Gets in position early and makes sure to stay well legside of it to give himself the room to pull it powerfully through midwicket"
"fuller and outside off, knocks it very hard down to long-off"
"slider, drifting down leg. Kamran gets down and across early and he laps it away to deep fine leg. Takes off quickly for the first and comes charging back for the second. A better throw and it could have been tighter"
"fuller, swept off the pads to deep fine leg for one"
"flat, on a length, spinning in on the pads, tucked away to deep backward square leg for one. That brings up the <b>fifty of the partnership</b>"
"flat and full, drops it in front of the vacant spaces in covers for a quick single"
"on a length, tucked off the pads through square leg. And, guess what! There is a misunderstanding between the two fielders converging on it.

Akmal is backing away but Badree bowls it on the pads and he does not find the middle of the bat on the sweep

"good length, waits for it to come on before nudging it in front of the pads to square leg for one"
backs away early and the bowler also offers up a lot of width. Akmal carves it uppishly and clears the in-field at the covers region. Deep point runs across and fields it
makes good connection on the slog this time and the ball sails comfortably over deep midwicket
"fires it quick and flat, width on offer, he tries to back away and slap but gets beaten by pace"
"slightly close to cut but makes room for himself and has placed that well, splits point and backward point perfectly"
"loses control of it, seems like it slipped out of his hands and bowls a full toss, flicked away to midwicket"
"width on offer outside off, hangs back and opens the bat face to run it to third man. There is a fielder inside the circle and Azam calls for the single. Kamran is ball-watching and does not respond, Azam is more than halfway down. Kamran responds late and both make it safely in the end"
""
goes for a full and wide delivery outside off but sprays it outside the crease and is called a wide

"goes for the same delivery again but not quite there. Low full toss, pushed along the ground wide of long-on for one"
"full toss again, outside off this time, dirven to the right of sweeper cover"
"is that a no-ball? No, doesn't seem to be. Kamran has been given out here. Samuels fires up a high, loopy full toss and Kamran smashes it away with a flat bat. Looks to launch it into the leg side but Lendl Simmons at the deep midwicket boundary snaffles it. Seemed like it was just above waist height. The on-field umpires converge and they go upstairs. The ball was dipping on him, around waist height, and they rule that it was good enough"
"fuller, pushed back to the bowler"
dangerously makes room by backing away and the ball spins in sharply towards off stump. He manages to keep it out
works it back to the bowler
"on a length, takes a stride towards off and knocks it to the right of the bowler"
gives it a lot of air and it dips on the batsman late. Squeezed out to long-off for one
"<b>dropped</b>. Tough caught-and-bowled chance, put down. Fuller and it is chipped back to the bowler. Hit a bit hard, so not much time for Brathwaite to react. He sticks the left hand out and the ball deflects off the palm. He recovers quickly and gets up. The non-striker is backing up too far and looking for a run off the drop. He charges towards the stumps and throws the ball. It hits the stumps but the batsman has made it back"
"full, outside off, drive to covers"
"on the pads, misses and wears it on the pads"
"and Malik, the in-form Shoaib Malik perishes now. This is a big blow for Pakistan. Too full and on the pads. Malik flicks, probably too well to his liking.

flicked away to backward square leg
gets down to sweep and the ball goes down the leg side as he misses
"fuller ball, launches it with the inward drift over deep midwicket with a straight bat"
"tries to improvise and pays the price for it. Gets down to paddle it but the ball is not full enough for him to be able to do that. It is on a length, he fails to make the late adjustment and cannot deal with the bounce from one knee down. Misses and the ball crashes into middle stump"
swept through square leg for one
"flat, on a length, tries to flick across the line and gets an inside edge that misses the stumps"

"too full, whipped away from the pads between midwicket and square leg"
"low full toss, backs away and carves it through covers. Throw from the deep is off target as they take on the fielder"
"<b>run out chance, missed. Or, is it?</b> Tries to squeeze out this fuller ball and chops it into the turf as the ball misses the stumps. The non-striker takes off for the run but Zaman is busy looking at where the ball has gone. The keeper fires a throw to the bowler's end and it seems initially that Holder has taken the stumps out with his hand and let the ball go. He did let the ball go, but as replays show, he still had the ball in his hand when the bails come off. Holder does not even make the appeal as he assumes he has lost grip of the ball. But seems like Carlos Brathwaite thought otherwise and made a belated appeal. Ball very much in hand when bails come off and that's a wicket"
"low full toss, pushed out to mid-off for one"
"short and wide, slashes it out to point"
"well-bowled. Wide yorker, Zaman tries to squeeze it out and can't make contact"
"full and wide, gets down for a half-sweep and works it to backward square leg"

"slower ball, tries to slog and misses. Wears it on the stomach and pinches a leg bye. Bowler has a shy at his end and misses the stumps"
"shorter ball, it is angling into him so he does not have the room to pull. Gets elevation but not distance. Pollard runs to his right from long-on and snaffles a smart catch"

tries to pull without making an effort to get behind the line. It is angling across and he does not make contact

"walks across and looks to flick, gets an inside edge to square leg"
"low full toss, looks to whip it away but the ball is dipping and he skews it to the short fine leg region"

"flat, on a length, punched off the front foot to long-on for one"
"short of a length, angled across just around off, Walton punches loosely without room and gets an inside edge"
this is almost a repeat of the Shoaib Malik dismissal. On the pads and flicked uppishly. Plays it too well doe his linking and sends it uppishly in the direction of deep square leg. Fakhar Zaman dives to his front and plucks with the edge of his fingers
"fullish length, clipped away off the pads to midwicket"
"good length, stays in the crease and defends down the pitch"
"that's sheer timing and placement. Great wristwork. Full, no movement, clipped easily off the toes through the massive vacant space in square leg"

sprayed down the leg side and misses the attempted flick of the batsman
comes down the track in a desperate bid to pick a boundary and drills it hard straight back to the bowler. Signs of aggression as he exchanges words with the bowler
"length, punched back to the bowler, and again he gives Samuels an earful"
"full, outside off, tries to carve it over the in-field on the off side. The room was there for him to launch it. Not the most convincing shot but he makes sure he gets it well over the fielder at the covers and point region"
opens the face of his bat and works it square of the wicket.
"stays in the crease and tries to flick it away. Misses and wears it on the pad as the ball goes down the leg side. Or so it seems. Called a wide and Sarfraz is not at all amused. Tanvir, too, tells the umpire about the ball making contact with the pad and replays confirm it did"
"chips this on-drive in the air as he goes too hard, just wide of mid-on"
"half-volley, again chipped in the air as he drills it hard, this time it goes straight to mid-off but the ball dies on the fielder, Imad Wasim, who dives forward"

comes down the track and pushes it down to long-on
tucked off the pads to the deep midwicket region
advances down the track and nudges it through midwicket
"short ball, rocks back to pull and the ball goes to deep midwicket. Zaman runs across from deep midwicket and tries to pull it back. Slides full length and does a superb job. But the ball seems to roll away with the momentum towards the boundary. that is when Ahmed Shehzad comes in. He was running across from wide long-on and he dives this time to pull it back and throw the ball"
goes down on one knee to get on top of the bounce and slog-sweeps powerfully over deep midwicket
that is just sheer power. Lofts it over long-on as he swings hard but it has gone off he toe end and miles up in the air. Clears long-on
"good length, pushed back to the bowler"
"back of a length, rides the bounce and tucks off the pads to midwicket and they take on the fielder for a quick single. Beat the throw at the non-striker's end that misses the stumps"

"shorter in length again, it gets slightly big on him and drags the pull down to long-on"
comes forward and plays for turn. It is the wrong'un and Lewis has not picked it. The beall beats the outside edge

swings wildly by staying leg side of it and this one spins away like an off-cutter. Samuels gets beaten and Wahab shakes his head in disapproval
"and Wahab gets the better of Samuels with a slower delivery. He was reluctant to get behind the line of the ball, choosing instead to stay leg side of it to give himself room. Short of a length and he goes through with the attempted slap early. Slices it in the direction of long-on who holds on to it without fuss"
presses forward and pushes this fuller ball to point by getting right to the pitch of it
front foot across and whips the wrong'un to long-on
driven along the ground to long-off for one
"short ball, pushed trough quicker and sitting up nicely for Mohammed who pulls it away to deep midwicket"
<b>inside edge to fine leg</b>. Gets back and swivels around to pull. But it is not short enough and there is not enough bounce

gets down to lap sweep and gets a top edge that goes fine of short fine leg

too full outside off and enough room to give the batsman the room to free his arms. Gets the front leg out of the way and makes sure he has enough room before carving it over extra cover

"fuller, draws the batsman forward and Mohammed drives close to the body to the right of sweeper cover"
gives it too much air and bowls a high full toss that is pushed gently back towards him. He does not gather it cleanly but they don't take the run. Lucky to get away with it
"<b>Lewis brings up his half-century</b> with a slog-swept six. Too full, gets down on one knee and hammers it to deep midwicket"
shuffes back and across to this length ball and defends it back to the bowler
"too short, too easy. Drops it way too short, gets the length horribly wrong and Lewis has all the time in the world to rock back and lay into a pull shot that takes the ball soaring into the deep midwicket stands"
gets down for a slog sweep again. Does not quite get hold of it and gets it off the inside edge to deep backward square leg
swings wildly to this fuller ball outside off and misses as the ball swings back in late
"yorker, drifting in outside off, squeezes it out in front of point and takes off for a quick single. <b>West Indies bring up their 100</b>"
jumps up to tuck it away off the front pad but the bounce gets big on him and the ball goes off the pad to the off side
"short ball, goes over leg stump and Lewis gets under it"
swings wildly as he swivels around with a pull to a length ball. Not enough bounce and seems like he has copped it on the back leg. and that was bowled with serious pace as well
"yorker, on leg, dug out to deep backward square leg and they take on the fielder and come back for the second. Direct hit at the non-striker's end could have made things interesting"
"short of a length, backs away to make room and slaps it away to point who puts in a dive and gets a hand to it"
"short of a length, fetches a pull from outside off and that has travelled a long way into the stands. It does not bounce as much, but no matter. It allows him to get right on top of it and dispatch it 98 m over cow corner"
follows it up with another short ball but it slower and Lewis widely chooses to duck under it
now he switches to the fuller length but Lewis responds like he was expecting it all along. Dispatches it straight back over the bowler's head. Brings the bottom hand into play and beautiful balance and timing
"perhaps went for the yorker but gets it horribly wrong. High full toss outside off, slices it wide of third man for four and an extra delivery to bowl as he has fired it over waist height"
"well-bowled.Wide yorker, escapes the bat of Lewis as he jams it down"
slower short ball from Tanvir. But Lewis is in supreme form. Picks up the drop in pace very early and waits for it to come on before getting on top of it and pulling it over deep backward square leg. That's his eighth six
"fuller, pushed down to long-on"
"slog sweep, over cow corner. This is savage hitting. He is picking the lengths so early. Pitched up on middle and leg and gets down on one knee before thumping it. That's the <b>highest score for a West Indies batsman against Pakistan in T20Is</b>"
hangs back and waits in the crease before opening the face of his bat. Finds short third man
Lewis has picked out long-off with four runs required. But what an innings this has been. It is pitched up and he has been given room as well. Lewis has timed it superbly but just does not get the desired elevation and distance. Down the throat of Wahab who wobbles slightly initially but has done quite brilliantly to pluck it. Could have probably lost sight of it for just a second
"and one ball is all Simmons needs to finish it off.  Short of a length, punched off the backfoot to the left of mid-on and it screams into the boundary"
