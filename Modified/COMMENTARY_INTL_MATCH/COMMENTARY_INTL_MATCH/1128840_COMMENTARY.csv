"steps out and launches this hit over long-on. Didn't get to the pitch of the delivery but went through with the stroke. Mishit to be honest, but somehow he's lucky to see this sail over."
"crunching cut shot. Too short, he rocks back, makes room to open up the off side and gives this a trash. The length was a result of the batsman stepping out off the previous delivery. Poor effort from Rahat at deep point"

"gentle little dab into the off side, they scamper even as the throw comes in from point to the bowler's end"

"slower and fuller outside off, he looked to heave this from way outside off and ends up dragging it towards square leg"
"is he giving catching practice or what? Pulled from outside off to midwicket. The short ball didn't really arrive, he didn't time it well either. Peshawar sliding"
sparkling drive but straight to mid-off

shapes to cut but is beaten by sharp turn. Wasn't all that short either
"shapes to play a reverse sweep but the ball drifts in, straightens and hits him on the thigh. Height not in question really. The only thing that would've saved him was a thin inside edge. There's a very, very small spike but the only thing it can come in contact is the bat. So he will get away with it. <B> Decision overturned </B>"

"pulled behind square, beats the man at deep backward square leg. Too short, too slow and this was sitting up nicely"
"smashed back past the bowler, who is lucky to have not got a finger on it even as he put his right hand out instinctively. <em>I reckon he would've chipped a nail had he got something on that</em>"
slapped past mid-off. So what if he's limping? He can still muscle them. Made room and used the angle to whack this into the gap
swing and a miss. Looked to pull but was through the stroke way too early

looks to squeeze this behind point but is beaten

whips this to short fine where Watson pulls off a fine stop
down on one knee as he squeezes the drive straight to mid-off
