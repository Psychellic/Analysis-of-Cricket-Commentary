"big swing back in from outside off, driven to extra cover"
steers this length delivery to square third man
"gorgeous! This is a half-volley and he simply laces this through extra cover, easy pickings. Tanvir searching for late swing, there wasn't much on this occasion"
"looks to cut, but this keeps low and beats the underedge"
squirts this off a thick outside edge to third man
"flat on a length on off, driven to cover"
"carved over point for a boundary. Gave himself room, stepping away a long way. Nawaz followed him, but Vince still hit him inside out"
"<b>and he's got him</b> made room once again, far too much room perhaps and Nawaz bowled this flat, quick and on the stumps. Vince missed with his attempted slap through the offside, Nawaz hits."
"angled in on the stumps from around the wicket, and Charles shows a dead bat in defence."
"flat and shorter, turning a bit from outside off, jabbed to the bowler's left"
"fuller on the stumps, uses his wrists to turn it to deep midwicket"
"quick ball first up, just outside off. Wanted to pull it but too late into the shot and misses"
"good length outside off, skids on at 141 kph, Charles chops it down but the ball doesn't travel too far. no run"
"fuller ball on off, clubbed to deep midwicket with the bottom hand coming into play"
"fuller, swinging in at good pace, and strikes him on the pads. Missing the stumps though, so no appeal"
"another quick delivery at 144 kph, and this is too quick for Charles. God length outside off, skidding through to the keeper. Charles wanted to bash that over cow corner, doesn't connect"
"a bit too full and straight, which allows Charles to clip it to deep square leg. That was measured at 151kph. Whew!"
"flatter and shorter outside off, slapped to point's left. He's halfway down the track and sent back. There probably was a run there"
<b>misfield at short third man by Fawad Ahmed</b> drifts down leg and Charles wanted to whip it away but gets a leading edge. Fawad dives over the ball and Charles gets four
"more convincing boundary this time, down the track, doesn't get fully to the pitch of the ball but plays a nice pickup shot to send it to the midwicket boundary"
"backs away to slap it, but straight to cover"
"nicely bowled, fooled him with the dip and drifting in from a length. Charles wanted to flick it but gets an inside edge onto pad"
"flatter and shorter, he goes back in his crease and swats it to long-on to retain strike"
"down the track and absolutely clubbed. Gets it off the middle too, but there is a sweeper back so his swat doesn't find the fence"
"length ball on off, swiped with a horizontal bat to mid-on"
"slower ball, fuller outside off and wider. He misses with the attempted flail, fooled by the pace"
"good length, cutting back in from outside off, takes the inside edge and rolls to short third man"
"<b>bad miss by Sarfaraz behind the stumps</b> short ball outside off, he misses the pull. It bounces in front of Sarfaraz and bounces over his gloves"

"length ball outside off, nipping back in, pushed to cover"
"loses his line, swings a long way but down legside and that will be a wide"
"one of Bravo's changes of pace, fuller on the stumps, he waits for it and clips it to long-on"
"another clever slower ball, just loops and dips at yorker length, pushed to cover"
"another slower ball yorker, but this time he waits and drives it to mid-off. Not much timing on it, but that's useful because they run a quick single"

"good length on off, he goes back and flicks it to deep midwicket"
"tossed up on off stump, very full, driven back to the bowler"

"goes right across the stumps to sweep, but only gets an inside edge to short fine leg"
"another googly, but he reads this well and sweeps. Short fine leg gets a hand to it, but can't prevent a run"
"another googly, but too short although quicker, allows Charles to go back in his crease and punch it to long-on."

"floated up on off, and pushed to long-on"
"angling into him, but ends up on the pads and turned to deep midwicket"
"gets some turn, back of a length and into the leftie, he wanted to pull it but misses"
he saw the batsman come down the track and bowled very wide of the stumps and gets it to turn sharply. Siddiq adjusts and jabs it away past cover
<b>that's out of here</b> Charles was looking at that cow corner area and this one was in the slot to allow him a free swing of the arms. Uses his power and strength to biff this high over the ropes
"flatter on off and turning away, pushed into the gap between cover and point"
"<b>outside edge for four</b> you don't have slips in this format too much, and Charles went for a big slog-sweep. Fawad had bowled a leg-spinner that rips away, takes the thick edge and goes for four."
"<b>and he's given out caught behind</b> There was a sound as the ball passed bat but Charles has asked for a review straightaway. Another legspinner, pitched on a length and breaking away. Charles cleared his front leg and went down for a slog-sweep. Didn't get hold of it at all, but ultra-edge shows there was no edge involved. Bat hitting the pitch was the sound. So Charles survives. In fairness to the umpire, there was a big woody sound"
"<b>another edge goes for runs!</b> Fawad has given 7 runs this over and none have been with the batsman in control. Charles caught in his crease and poked at this legspinner, gets a thick edge that flies over the slip that came in after the first ball."
and that's rubbing salt into the wounds. Siddiq clears his front leg and makes room to smash this through cover for a boundary
sweeps this to square leg for one
"<b>dropped by Nawaz at deep midwicket</b> This has been a massively unlucky over for Fawad. 7 runs off edges and now Nawaz drops a sitter. Charles had pulled it fiercely but straight to the fielder. Ball pops in, and out."
"another quick ball, nips in and raps him on the pads, beats his attempted push. Half-appeal but that was going down leg"
yorker length on the fifth stump at 144 kph. Charles gets the toe-end back to the bowler
"back of a length outside off, pushed to cover and they scamper through for a quick single"
"well bowled, angled across and wide of off stump at 145 kph. He wanted to slap it with a horizontal bat, but misses"

"lovely ball. googly again, but with beautiful flight and dip, drew him into the drive and beat him, with the ball snaking past the outside edge after pitching on middle and off. They're checking for a stumping too, but his boot never left the crease"
down the track and turned to short fine leg. No run
"<b>swept fine for four</b> too short and on the pads, and Charles smartly paddles it fine to pick up a boundary"
"oh that's almost an action replay, but this was played squarer. Again on the pads and Charles goes down on one knee to hit to short fine leg's left that time and get another four"
"<b>given lbw and he's walking off</b> Not taking the review, but Charles hasn't gone for it. This one seemed to pitch on leg stump and turned back in, Charles wanted to sweep again, but was struck on the pads. The bowler's appeal was fairly muted, Sarfaraz was more vociferous behind the stumps, and the umpire gives it. This may have pitched outside leg. Replays show it pitched just in line, so good decision in the end by the umpire, and by Charles to not review it."
"fuller ball angled into the stumps, defended back"
"flatter on off, and spinning away. Jabbed towards point"
"flatter and quicker again, Malik punches it back to the bowler off the back foot"
"googly, he's backed away to give himself room but misses it"
"another googly, this one dipping in front of him outside off. He went for the slog sweep but missed it again"
"another googly, but this one is steered nicely to third man. Watson sprints after it but the batsmen sprint quicker, to take three"
"<b>beauty</b> ripping leg-break, pitches on leg and spins past his bat outside off. Nothing the batsman could have done about that"
"fuller length, defended carefully"
"flatter and skidding through outside off, he pushes it into the offside for a quick single"
"yorker on the fifth stump line, he digs it out with a horizontal bat"
"slower bouncer, Malik waits for it and pulls it down to square leg"
"slower yorker, it's like a dipping offspinner. Moores had no clue about that. Went to sweep way too early and struck on the pads. but from around the wickets, so going down leg"
"once again, yorker on the toes from around the stumps. He went for the big swing over cow corner and doesn't connect"
"this time a quicker yorker on leg stump, and Moores bunts it down to long-on. Good running to get two"
"yorker on the stumps, flicked towards midwicket"
"pacy ball, wide outside off at 146 kph. Moores wanted to slap it through the offside, but is too late on the shot"
"back of a length on the stumps, and he moves across to tuck it to midwicket and get off strike"
back of a length just outside off at 142 kph. Defended back
"bouncer, and Malik sways out of the way. that looked like a slower bouncer, and Malik read it late"
"slashed to the point fence for a pressure-relieving boundary. Little bit of room outside off and back of a length, Malik was quickly on to it."
"<b>smashed</b> sumptuous shot by Malik, this was full on the stumps and he just straight drives it back over the bowler's head for a straight six. Holds the pose too, and why not. That was the shot of the day so far"
"another slower ball by Bravo, length ball coming in. He waits for it and turns it around the corner off his pads"
"full toss, Malik punches it to deep midwicket and they run hard to get two. Malik called two as soon as he hit it"
"slower ball again, almost a yorker outside off, Malik waits for it and flicks it to fine leg"
"<b>and the slower ball finally gets him</b> Bravo does a little jig, but he's been making Moores dance to his tune today. Another slower ball off cutter, Moores didn't read it again, went for a big slog-sweep, inside edges it on to the stumps"
"<b>Dan Christian is run out, suicidal run</b> yorker on off stump, but Christian times it well, punches it to deep cover. They take two comfortably, and for some reason, Christian wanted to come back for a third. Malik wasn't interested at all, rightly so. By the time Christian turned back, the flat throw had come in and the bails were whipped off. Waste of a wicket"
"off-cutter coming in sharply, Afridi turns it to third man to get off the mark and retain strike"
"pacy bouncer, but it's gone too far over Afridi's head and it will be a wide"
"back of a length outside off, Afridi steers it to third man"
"slower ball, almost yorker length outside off, Malik pushes it towards point"
"<b>big appeal</b> 144 kph, nipping back in sharply and it's left Malik hobbling. Hit him above the pads, hit him below the thigh pad and that's a painful blow. The ball was probably going over the stumps and down leg too, but Malik is in pain. Oh what do you know, replays show it was clipping the bail. But would have been not out on umpire's call"
fuller ball on the stumps and Malik flicks it to deep square leg for a couple
"given room outside off and Malik cuts it nicely, but straight to backward point"
"backs away but he follows the batsman, and Malik can only tuck it to midwicket. Excellent over, just five runs from it in the 17th of the innings."
"wide of off stump, slower ball and full, Malik slaps it but can't get past mid-off"
short ball and pulled fiercely but there is a sweeper back and he gets only one run
"another short ball outside off, and Afridi pulls it down to deep midwicket for one"
nipping in from outside off and Malik is able to punch it into the offside. Still only a single
"slower bouncer, but gets his line wrong, it nips away and down legside for a wide"
"nails the yorker, and Afridi misses the flick while moving across. The ball rolls to Safaraz and they take a leg-bye. But Sarfaraz has called for a review. No bat involved, and it pitched on leg and middle. but it's missing the stumps comfortably. Afridi had moved well across which is why Sarfaraz thought of the review"
"drilled back straight but it hits the stumps at the bowler's end and ricochets off, and they get only one run"
"<b>caught at deep square leg off a full toss</b> His eyes lit up when he saw the full toss and he went to swat it, but didn't time it well. Nawaz dives forward to complete a good catch, perhaps making amends for the sitter he had dropped earlier at the same position, off Johnson Charles"
"fuller on off, he moves across and clips to long-on"
"slower ball once again, off-cutter at 98 kph, Afridi waits for it and pushes it into the offside"
"another slower yorker, and he has to wait for it once again and taps it to midwicket."
"<b>leading edge caught at mid-off</b> no happy birthday with the bat for Afridi, the pressure of no big runs meant he went for a big swipe targetting midwicket, but it was another Bravo slower ball. He ends up with a leading edge that swirls upwards and settles nicely into mid-off's hands."
"angling in, he moves across to flick but it takes his pads to short fine leg. Leg-bye"
"slower ball, doesn't get hold of it wanted to heave it to the legside, gets it off the inside half of the bat to deep midwicket"
"loses his line, went around the wicket and angled it too far in, with the ball nipping a bit too and ending up down legside for a wide"
"yorker on the stumps and he backs away to drill it past the bowler. Long-off has to run across a long way to collect, and they pinch a second run"
"length ball outside off, slashes it but with no timing. Bravo at extra cover times his jump, just needed a little one, and plucks the ball out, so that's another wicket down for Multan"
"<b>two in two</b> this was a full toss outside off and the batsman threw his hands at it while clearing his leg, but again no timing. And hits it straight to cover for a dolly of a catch"
fuller ball on the stumps and pushed to long-on. No hat-trick for Tanvir
"<b>finishes with a wicket</b> Irfan came down the track, perhaps a tad too ambitious. Nowhere near the ball, as it sneaks through under his bat to castle the stumps"
pitches on a good length on off stump and Watson is left to tap it to point
width this time and Watson hammers it over point. A front foot carve with no care given to keeping it down. Sheer power from the Australian
"fullish delivery on off stump, Watson defends"
waits on the back foot to cut a back of a length delivery not really offering all that much room; manages the shot well enough but can't hit the gap behind point
a hint of swing into the right-hander this time but Watson is safely behind it. The length being a bit short would've helped him
cuts again but with very little room on offer Watson ends up finding point again
"pacy delivery, angling across and beating the tentative prod"
<b>shot</b> peachy cover drive to one that was too full outside off and it races across the turf and into the fence
"too close to cut, and he tries anyway, doesn't connect. Good length ball on off stump"
back of a length on the stumps and he clips it to deep midwicket
another ball angling away into the corridor of uncertainty and Watson doesn't connect with an attempted squirt
good length outside off and steered to third man to keep strike
"flattish on middle stump, not much turn, pushed to cover"
"fuller, given some more air, Watson takes   a big stride out to defend"
"flatter, fired in on the pads, and Watson cleared his leg and wanted to pull it, but misses and the ball hits pad"
"<b>beats the man at deep midwicket</b> too full and Watson moves across to flick it off his toes. Great timing and though a squarish deep midwicket put in a good chase, the ball just beats him"
"quicker one on the stumps, Watson brings his bat down in time to defend with the full face"
"fuller on the stumps, driven to cover off the back foot"
"too straight and drifting on the pads, picked off easily to the fine leg fence"
"drifting on the pads again and flicked nicely, but straight to short fine leg, so no run"
"better line, a bit too short though and coming in from outside off. Punched forcefully but straight to cover"
<b>overthrows go for four and he gets five runs</b> on the pads and flicked to short fine leg so they take a quick single. Irfan has a shy at the stumps and birthday boy Afridi was not backing up.
"and the ball now beats Irfan at short fine leg. Watson was looking to push it but gets an inside edge, goes to Irfan's right. He puts in the dive, but can't get there"
"<b>smashing Shane</b> full ball and Watson merely clears his leg and has a full golf swing at the ball, sends it soaring over the long-on boundary"
"flatter on the stumps, a bit full, flicked to midwicket"
"too short and swatted to the square leg boundary. Watson spotted it, rocked back and pulled it fiercely. To Afridi's right, and he was too slow in getting down to save it."
"length ball on off stump, Watson stays still and strokes it past extra cover"
"cleared his front leg again to smash it, but gets an inside edge on to pad"
"nicely looped, slowed it up and dipped, pitched and turned. Watson was backing away to give himself room to swing those powerful arms, but the ball spins past the bat"
"good comeback by Nauman, Watson doesn't connect with the big heave once again"
"fuller ball on leg stump, turned around the corner"
"fired in on the pads, pushed to mid-on with a straight bat"
"<b>smashed</b> he spotted the length and knew he could bring out that backfoot pull shot, goes deep in his crease and smashes it past square leg"
<b>goes the other way now</b> backs away to give himself room and smashes it past cover that time with a muscled slap
"<b>boom boom has his revenge</b> similar ball to the one he sent crashing through the offside last ball, on a length outside off. Watson backs away again to slap it, but inside edges onto the stumps. He's pretty unhappy with himself for that poor execution"

"flatter on the stumps and fuller, he drives it nicely to the man on the extra cover fence"
goes for the reverse sweep to this length ball outside off but doesnt connect
"<b>huge appeal and not given. Afridi's gone for a review</b> Rossouw was going for the reverse sweep again but didn't connect, this was the leg-break and spun in from outside off.

"fuller on off stump, driven to long-off"
"sharp off break, Shehzad sticks to his strategy of playing into the offside with soft hands and pinching a quick single"
"leading edge goes to point, the fielder seems to have slipped and hurt himself. Loop and spin on the ball, drifting on leg, he wanted to turn it but the spin means he gets an edge. Siddiq at backward point slips and falls"

"length ball on the stumps and Rossouw paddles it around the corner down on one knee, and runs hard to get two."
"down the track and smashes it, but straight to mid-off"
"down the track again, and this time he goes over the top. Dan Christian at long-on runs across and gets there, but a very sloppy effort. Tries to stop the ball with one hand and doesn't, to concede a four"

"<b>smashed</b> down the track and connects well, driving powerfully through cover for a four"
"too far down leg and that's a wide. Big turn though, pitched on leg and turned"
tossed up on off and another tip-and-run by Shehzad. They are getting these singles off balls pushed in the in-field far too easily
"<b>lbw given and Rossouw immediately reviews</b> Rossouw seemingly asking umpire Richard Illingworth that didn't he see he got a thick edge on it? And he's right, he does have an edge. This was well flighted, pitched on leg and turned past the bat, takes the outside edge onto pad. No wonder Rossouw was a bit annoyed"

"too full outside off and Rossouw was backing away a bit, has enough room to power this through the cover region for another couple"
"<b>direct hit by Ilyas at fine leg and Rossouw is run out</b> This was full and turned away nicely, Rossouw hustled for the second, but Ilyas was fantastic on the fence, and fired in a throw straight and flat. Incredibly, it hit the stumps direct and even Rossouw's dive was not enough to save him"
"another dot ball, play and a miss by Shehzad to this length ball outside off"
"length ball outside off, this time he stays beside the ball and guides it past point for a couple"
"another play and miss. Ilyas brings his line closer to off and Shehzad is just looking to poke at the ball, misses it"

"good length on off, defended back to the bowler"
"<b>holes out to deep midwicket</b> this is what happens when the runs dry down to a trickle. Umar Akmal knew he had to get a move on because Shehzad wasn't, comes down the track and plays a pick-up pull but only finds the man at the boundary"
"down the track and the ball is through him. Not sure what shot he wanted to play because he just went for a poke - can do that from the crease, no need to rush down the track"

ooh that kept a bit low and went through Bravo. He was giving himself room but the bowler follows him and it goes through to the keeper
"tried to follow the batsman again, but this time he bowls it too far down leg for a wide. Bravo was coming down the wicket"
nipping in from off stump and takes his pad to roll away for a leg-bye
<b>shot</b> too short and he goes on the back foot and swivels to pull it past short fine leg for a game-winning boundary. A bit of a flourish at the finish there from Shehzad to ensure Quetta Gladiators get to their target in the end.
