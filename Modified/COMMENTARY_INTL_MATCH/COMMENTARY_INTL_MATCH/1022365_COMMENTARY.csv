"outside off, pushed into the covers"
"on the toes, tucked to the leg side"
"that's a lovely ball, angling in and nipping away, past the left-hander's edge. Warner does well not to nick it"
"dangling it outside off stump, tempting the indiscretion. Warner leaves"
"tight and straight, tapped back to the bowler. Hitting the pitch hard on a fullish length, and just nibbling it a touch so far"
"round the wicket, angled into the bat, poked to cover and that's a maiden. Well done."
"careful now! A wild slash outside off, desperate to feel bat on ball"
"dangled outside off, a hint of gentle outswing. Finch reaches but can't connect"
"good line and length, a bit of outswing once more. Finch leaves alone, as the ball dies through to the keeper"
"wafty. Finch is lining up the massive wallop over the covers, but Wood's line keeps drifting just out of his reach"
"fuller length, Finch attempts to hit straight back whence it came, but a thick outside edge fizzes into the covers to get him off the mark"
"on the back foot, punched back down the pitch. 'Wait on!' is the cry, and sure enough, they wait. Very solid start"
"biffed! On the front foot, dispatched with utter contempt through mid-on with a round-house swing. That'll make him feel better!"
"good comeback, tighter line. Defended"
"another boundary, not remotely where he intended, but his ambitious swing means that an attempted cover-drive ends up as a whistling inside edge through midwicket"
"hanging back in the crease this time, a single into the leg side"
"lots of humpty behind that stroke, cracked on the up into the covers. But wide mid-off is well placed"
"a quick single to backward point, Roy fumbles as Warner gets off the mark"
"a fraction too short, and now it's Warner's turn to connect with a haymaker, leaning back to smite with great vengeance over wide mid-on. Seems he's knocked the ball a touch out of shape with that blow"
"short again, Warner rises onto his toes, like a pugnacious ballerina, and hauls a measured pull through the leg-side"
"better line and length, holding its own on off stump. Finch pats back to the bowler"
"on the back foot, and defended back down the pitch"
"tip and run, on the back foot, but an instant call beats the cover fielder"
"nibbles back into the left-hander, dabbed into the off side. Good cut and thrust on show so far"
"angled in from wider on the crease, defended on the back foot"
sliding down the leg side
works the single
"dispatched! Round the wicket, in Warner's slot, a massive heave-ho over the leg side"
"back on a fuller length, patted into the covers"
"inside edge, and tapped down into the crease. More good calling to steal the single"
"excellent running again, poked to the off side, an instant call. Had to scamper as the under-arm came in from Morgan but safely home"
"banged in short, swivelled round the corner for a measured single"
a loud roar of 'no!' from the big man
"on the pads, that's a poor ball, and Rashid can't cut that off as Warner works it exceptionally fine off the hip"
tapped to the leg side
"well bowled, fuller length, swinging past a tentative poke outside off"
"tries to steal the single into the off side, think better of it, then nick it anyway as the shy pings off the stumps and away to no-man's land. Excellent awareness from Australia"
"round the wicket, that's a probing line and length, pushed back down the pitch from under the batsman's nose"
"up on the toes, working the single to the leg side"
"good placement from Finch, this is a positive start from Australia, without being explosive"
deflected fine
"inches from holing out to cover! Pushed hard off the back foot, it hung in the air for a while, but died just in front"
"a good bombastic finish to another over of solid progress. Short, not ruinously so, but Warner is so quick to punish on length. Midwicket can't intercept"
"on the pads, another single to keep England frustrated"
"edged and Warner is gone! That is a superb delivery from Wood, inch-perfect line, kicking off the deck and nibbling half-a-bat's width away from the left-hander! He was just beginning to find his range, but Australia's danger man is extracted in his prime"
"lovely way to greet the new batsman! Outside off, holds its line, beats a tentative defensive push"
"well bowled again, outside off, a hint of movement back into the right hander, as he shoulders arms"
"firm-handed push to cover. 'No run!' is the cry, but then Morgan misfields, so they take one anyway"
"that's a loose delivery, too straight to a player of Finch's ability, who walks inside the line and tucks a boundary through fine leg"
"no stroke offered as the ball crashes into the pads! Huge appeal from Ball, but he knows in his heart of hearts that that was missing off... no review, on we go"
"sharp lift from a full length, Smith removes his top hand from the bat as the ball gets big on him"
"good forcing stroke off the back foot, bisecting cover and point, who chase manfully to the edge of the rope to limit the damage"
"outside off, through to the keeper on a measured line and length"
"beautiful timing, trusting the hands to fling the ball through the line and away to the rope"
panned down the pitch once again. He's finding the middle of his bat already
"driving with hard hands off the back foot, not really timed though as it pings off the splice into the off side"
through to the keeper once more
"on the toes, into the leg side"
"punched into the covers, Smith feels the vibrations through his handle as he wrings his top hand after that shot"
"wider on the crease from Wood, fuller length as well. Cover tidies up"
"tight line, tight length. Defended into the off side from deep in the crease"
"tremendous strike! Full and straight, Finch waited and waited, bashed it right under his eyeline, and it squeezes past the stumps and away to the rope"
works the single as Plunkett adjusts his length
"on the pads, flicked wide of mid-on, who gathers with a dive"
"slower ball, but Finch picks it well, waiting late to punch it past a flailing mid-on. A loose start from Plunkett"
"drilled on the up, into the covers"
"on the pads, settles for a deflected single into the leg side"
"a bit of a loosener, short and wide, but cover is well placed to protect against any damage"
"tighter line, back of a length, punched to mid-off"
"on the pads, tapped to midwicket"
"cracked into the off side, no way through"
worked off the leg side
"slower ball, back of a length, pulled to backward square. A tidier over from Stokes"
"attacking the toes, worked to leg"
"that's Plunkett's area, tight on off stump, hitting the deck hard, forcing a defensive push off the back foot"
"ambitious from Smith, looking to steal a single to a non-descript push to mid-on, and he had to scarper for his crease as the under-arm flick came in"
misdirected. We'll have that one again
"whittled into the leg side, full length on the pads"
"pushed back into the crease, defended to the leg side"
"a better over from Plunkett, he's finding his range"
"very full length once again, drilled to mid-on"
"outside off stump, dangled out there, asking Finch to come and have a go. He declines, and simply wafts the ball back to the bowler with minimal footwork"
"tapped to cover, another sharp single"
a wide line and a full length. Stokes inviting Smith to take the initiative
"short, and that's a cracking stroke - literally, as the shot echoes around a disappointingly un-rammed Edgbaston. But the midwicket sweeper tidies up"
"short and wide, but the sweeper on the off side this time is well placed to intercept"
thumped out to the off side
"full length, and defended to the off side"
"outside off, tight line, full length, left alone"
tucked up a touch by a tighter line. Plunkett gathers in his followthrough
fenced down into the crease
"that's a good bit of dot-joining from Plunkett, tight on off stump and fended away"
"a cross-seam delivery from Stokes, but it comes out as a bit of a biff-able long-hop, slapped through midwicket"
"back-to-back boundaries, as Stokes is this time punished for his wider line. Cut fiercely"
"Stokes recalibrates, and this is a better ball angling into the top of off. Pushed to point"
"genuine edge, but Buttler can't reach it! A loose waft, but safe in the end, as England's only slip is standing at a splice-intercepting fifth"
"shorter and straighter, tucked to the leg side. The fifty partnership is up in good time"
a touch taken aback as this one leaps from a good length. But negotiated in the end
"tight line outside off, Smith hops across to work into the leg side"
"squirted into the leg side, another single to keep the pot boiling"
"a roll of the wrists, and a single to midwicket. Fifty for Finch, and he's building a head of steam"
attacking line
"Smith opens the face on impact, attempting to milk a tight and aggressive line on off stump"
"worked into the leg side, another single - lots of them around today."
"floated up full on off stump, blunted watchfully back to the bowler by Smith"
"full and loopy, comes across, tapped into the covers"
"flighted, bit of dip on to middle stump, Smith clips it brusquely past the bowler and Jake Ball has to put in a good slide to stop it at long-on"
tossed up on the legs and worked away square for a single
"full and flighted, nurdled to mid-on, the fielder is set back and it's a comfortable single"
"pushed through a bit quicker on the stumps, Smith tucks to midwicket for one more"
"oof, that's a menace, Plunkett beams Smith and it's rightly called a no-ball, did well to shovel it away to leg for a couple"
follows up with a bouncer that Smith swivels down to fine leg
"length on the hips and tucked into a gap square, they come back for two"
"sliding in with the arm, Finch waits in the crease and turns one more off his hip"
"lovely stroke, timed like a Swiss watchmaker back down the ground, beats mid-on and races away"
back of a length and worked into the leg side
"short outside off stump, Finch splunks a back-foot drive square for one more"
tossed up outside off and pushed down the ground to long-off
"drifting a touch straighter, Smith clips it from under his nose through the on side"
"doesn't pick the googly, spins on to the pads but slightly leg side"
"huge appeal from Rashid, again he inveigles a Bosie back inside the bat, Dharmasena not interested... and England decide not to <b>review</b> on Buttler's instinct that is was sliding down"
"another lbw shout, this time as the ball grubs on to hit the boot with Finch in an awful tangle - but this was definitely missing leg"
waits and calmly nudges away a single to leg to finish an eventful over
touch short and wide and steered through point for a single
lets this one go in the channel
"full and wide, that's pretty ordinary bowling, Smith happily clubs it away through backward point for a boundary"
"better lines, Smith shuffles across and defends"
"short outside off, 138kph/86mph, again patted back down towards the bowler"
"full and wide, in the tramlines and Smith couldn't reach it having moved across. Stokes scowls at the decision"
touch short and flicked off the body through backward square
"flighted, on middle and leg, punched down the ground"
"tossed up on the stumps and Finch is down early, gets a good stride and paddles a couple through backward square"
"slider, this skips on and does for Finch, stuck on the back foot, into the pads, Rashid again implores for the lbw... but no dice, possibly <i>just</i> missing leg"
spots the googly this time and plays with the spin through square leg for a couple
comes forward and pushes one back past the bowler
tossed up and tickled through mid-off for one more
"on the stumps, worked away to leg"
absolutely boshed! Too full from Stokes and Finch leans his considerable bulk into a hammer blow past the dive of mid-off
"fired into the tramlines outside off, another wide"
"short, on the body and worked away to the leg side"
"back of a length and angling in, turned behind square but fine leg is up quickly to prevent a second"
"Finch misfires! Just as he was beginning to look very dangerous, he tried to launch Stokes into West Bromwich and ended up hitting the ball straight up, to be taken smartly by Morgan circling under it from mid-off. Came right off the toe of the bat, maybe deceived by a legcutter from Stokes"
comes across on off and defends
"tossed up on middle and leg, Henriques is on to the front foot to push away"
pushed into the off side
"floated up outside off, tapped towards extra cover"
"pushed through a little flatter and Henriques misses out trying to cut, finds backward point"
"floated up full and straight, worked to midwicket this time"
"that's a maiden for Rashid, as Henriques flays a drive to cover. Sound and fury, signifying nothing"
"angled in, touch short and worked away off the body through midwicket"
"fuller length, Henriques closes the face early and gets a leading edge back to the bowler"
"lovely shot, a confidence-boosting way to get off the mark, steps out and drills a square drive to the boundary, textbook shot-making"
"four more, this time on the pull! Henriques was waiting for it in the crease and he rolls the wrists on a whipcrack blow through backward square leg"
"shortish, sliding on to the body as Henriques looks to work to leg, deflects off the thigh pad"
Smith is again left flailing as Stokes finds the tramlines
"better line, length ball outside off, draws him forward and clips the inside edge on to pad as Smith feels for it"
"nicely bowled, brings the wrong'un back in and again it's inside edge on to pad as Henriques pushes forward"

"shortish, defended into the ground towards gully and there's no run"
"tossed up outside off, pushed back towards the bowler"
pushed through on the stumps and flicked across the line
"flighted, outside off stump, tapped into the covers"
"gone, slogged to mid-on! He's played a few impressive strokes - but that won't go down as one of them. Might have been the googly from Rashid but, either way, Henriques wasn't to the pitch trying to hit down the ground and it screwed off the inside half of the bat, looping tamely to mid-on"
"flighted, straightening on the stumps, worked away through the leg side"
"flat legbreak, Smith moves on to off stump and works away against the turn"
"shortish in the channel and Smith can't work this to leg, defends"
short and a touch wide and this time Smith goes through backward point for a single
back of a length and defended from the crease
"only a touch short and wide but Head plays this beautifully, arrowing a back cut to the rope at deep backward point"
"well bowled in response, cross-seam from Plunkett and it leaps from a shortish length to hit the glove, doesn't carry to slip"
"pitched up and driven, not out of the middle but he gets it past extra cover for a couple"
"flighted, dipping and turning on off stump, Smith leans into a block"
pushed through flatter and dabbed into the off side
"tossed up on middle and off stump, Smith smothers it again"
"bit of width, Smith cracks a drive off the back foot but finds the man at cover"
"tossed up on off stump, pushed down the ground for one"
"full and flighted, on off stump, drilled past the bowler but mid-off prevents more than a single"
"back of a length, worked into the leg side"
"banged in halfway down and Head is quickly on the pull, smacked to deep backward square"
"that's his fifty, overpitched and driven, wide of mid-off and it just keeps picking up pace, duping Wood into trying to cut it off and then giving him no chance - important innings from the Australia captain"
goes back and across and works to the leg side
pitched up and prodded towards extra cover
dug in short and Smith whirls his arms on a flat pull to deep backward square leg

pushed through on the stumps and worked to leg with the spin
"round the wicket, tossed up outside off, driven to long-off coming forwards"
"on the stumps, Smith clips another single down the ground"
"gottim, plinked to mid-off! Huge wicket for England, Smith hangs his head in disgust, a really soft way to go, maybe he was expecting something quicker to start off with but instead wafts at an 85mph loosener and sends it looping slowly, tantalisingly, irresistibly to the man on the edge of the ring"
shortish outside off and defended down safely
shuffles across on off stump and defends to the on side
"banged in, short ball over the stumps, Maxwell ducks it"
"good length, 144kph/89mph and in the channel outside off, Maxwell thrusts his front leg out and leaves"
"fullish, tailing in and punched to mid-on - that's wicket maiden for Wood, another key intervention"
"round the wicket, angled in and punched back to the bowler"
tossed up and defended coming forwards
"gives it a bit of air, Head leans into a crisp drive but picks out extra cover"
"pushed through, Head drops back on off, swats a cut through cover point for one"
angled in and turning down the leg side
"floated up on middle and leg, Maxwell works it towards mid-on"
quicker on off stump and Maxwell can only turn to midwicket - another tight over and Edgbaston drinks it in
"round the wicket, banged into the deck, flashed into the off side"
fended away
"full length, angling into the left-hander, cramped for room and shovelled into the off side"
"full and tight, punched to mid-off"
"off the mark with his ninth delivery, finds the gap in the covers with a compact drive"
"edged, and<strong> so close!</strong> Turned inside-out by a genuine wicket-taking ripper, climbing into the splice and bursting out of the reach of Root at first slip. A near-replica of the Warner wicket-ball"
looped up and deflects away
"looking to be aggressive, firmly struck right under the eyeline"
right on the money
lots of oohs as this one is dabbed out to point
"flicked off the toes, just another single to deep midwicket. England have drawn the sting for the moment"
"a slow-turning offbreak, read off the pitch, and slapped into the covers"
"good delivery, nibbling off the seam and tucking up the right-hander. A deflection into the off side"
"round the wicket, just a notch too short, and firmly spanked out to wide long-on"
"deflected into the leg side, working with the round-the-wicket angle"
"on the pads, flipped through square leg"
looking for power over placement. Loses his shape in the progress
"on the pads, worked into the leg side. England controlling the tempo well for now"
"crashed through the covers with power and intent, but that's a stunning piece of fielding, pouncing on a scurrying ball with the grace and accuracy of a housecat"
worked off the hip
"reverse sweep, under-edged into the crease."
powered through the ring this time. Simple and effective
looking to work into the leg side again
"back and across, cracked on the up out to deep cover"
"round the wicket, Head wanders across his stumps to work with the angle of a leg-side delivery"
"a monstrous wind-up and, well, good intent, but he misses that one by a mile. Just as well for the neighbouring houses"
tucked square
good placement
working the single to keep the score ticking
"open-faced deflection through third man, as the floodlights blink into life"
"looking for a hack over cover, a thick outside-edge flies through point"
"firmly bunted through the line, takes the single to mid-on"
crashing cut. No sweeper in place due to Maxwell's penchant for the sweep. That fizzes through the gap
"hauled into the leg side, a bit of sharp turn on display there"
"wafted back over the bowler's head. Decent connection from deep in the crease, but was aiming squarer"
good bit of footwork lures a wide down the leg-side
crunched square but straight to the fielder. A kick of the bat in frustration as he misses out on what he must have thought was a boundary-ball. Ten to go
flicked away
Maxwell is signalling his frustration as another ball goes by without any rope-clearing
"tucked up on the legs, but that's more like it for Australia. Lightning hands through the ball, despite being cramped for room, and square leg can't intercept"
"a tennis-smash, and it's two in two! Flashed in front of square as Ball drops short. Well played"
"good riposte, comes over the wicket for a change of angle, aims straight, offering no room to free the arms"
"flipped to leg, more good connection  but only to the midwicket sweeper"
"a loose full toss, spanked through Morgans hands in the covers. That was travelling, but he took the sting off it"
"well bowled, looped up and twisting off the pitch past a flat-footed waft"
"on the toes, square leg cuts it off"
"keeps a touch low outside off, as Head has a swing across the line for another single to midwicket"
flogged into the off side
cut out to deep point
"<B>dropped!</B> So nearly Wood striking twice with the first ball of the spell ... and a run-out chance too, but he's safely home at the non-striker's end. Flogged fiercely to cover, and down it goes!"
"outside off, beats  a loose waft"
"caught in the deep! Brilliant from Roy! Short ball from Wood, hit hard and flat, it's six all the way, but round swoops Roy, plucking the ball above his head, foot a millimetre from the line, then in that now-typical-but-still-awesome manner, tosses the ball up as his momentum takes him over, then gathering when back in play. Stunning. The umpires are checking, but this looks clean... Roy certainly thought so, and so does the third umpire!"
"on the toes, tucked to leg"
"tight line to the left-hander, dabbed to the off side"
"worked off the pads, swiftly back for two as the sweeper hurtles in. Another mightily effective over from Wood"
"poked into the off side, a touch airborne"
"outside the off stump, punched on the up to cover"
"googly! Wades reads it about as well as I can read Hindi. Three fielders converge but Rashid calls for his own catch as the ball loops straight up in the air, and England are really taking control in the slog-overs now"
"looped up, and driven to short cover"
"lovely line and length, every ball a hand-grenade"
"that's terrible! An attempted googly, comes out as a leg-stump full toss, Starc slaps across the line as if substituting his bat for a damp tuna-fish, and up loops another facile catch, this time for Root behind the stumps!"
a lot resting on Head now as he nudges another single
"a slip in place as Wood hammers out a threatening length, but deflected away,"
tries to climb into a leg-side hoick but Wood is too sharp for him
"full length, almost a low full toss, toe-ended back to the bowler in his followthrough"
"on the hip, flipped into the leg-side"
"good pace, good length, nothing for Australia to work with at all"
forward and nudged into the leg side
"a touch more width as Rashid drags it short, but Head settles for a single with a cut to point"
"on the pads, and swept fine. Good quick running"
steered straight to short cover. Australia finding it tough to get any momentum
"oh, well bowled. Drops the pace right down, the ball dips late and spins sharply past a loose wafty drive"
"too easy for Rashid, who finishes his spell with a four-for! A lollipop push straight back to the bowler, neither forward nor back, and utterly unsure of which direction that would spin. England are rampant!"
"banged in short, a calm pull through backward square to bring up a battling fifty from Head. He needs to be there for the full 50 now"
forward and crunched to mid-off
"onto the front foot, can't get that away"
"full toss, and bowled! Zampa didn't fancy staying in line one little bit, gave himself room, and was in no position to protect his timbers as Wood splattered his off pole!"
"full length, oohs and aahs ring out as Australia's No.11 survives"
"pushed back onto the crease, blocked down into leg side"
"round the wicket, Head sensibly lets this go and the umpire stretches his arms"
"down the track, a bit of a dirty hack across the line, looking for midwicket, but finding cover with a mistimed splat-shot"
forward and punched to cover
"round the wicket, angling into the left-hander. Punched to cover"
"outside off, and cut through point"
"yee-har! Down on one knee in the sort of impetuous will-you-marry-me pose last seen in Elvis's Chapel in Vegas. The answer's no, as it happens"
"more circumspect this time, takes the single, keeps the strike"
"great line and length, another valiant thrash, but the ball hops over the stroke and the stumps"
"hacked in the air, can Wood reach it at third man? No, not quite!"
"short, forcing Head to take on the long boundary, and this time, he does so to mighty effect! Stokes thought he was in business, into the wind, but just too much power!"
punched down to long-off. Declines the single with two still to come
"ha, a comically slow slower-ball! Head was walking down the pitch, but the bouncer barely reached him as he flailed to make contact"
"tucks the single to leg, to keep the strike. One massive six, but just seven from the over"
"spanked over midwicket! That's brilliant from Head, the best contact of the night, absolutely whistles over the fielder. Not the right line from Stokes though, feeding his strengths"
"better length, a spiralling top-edge to cover, now, who wants this? It's Plunkett ... but it's <B>dropped!</B> He was late to react, and never quite reached it"
"edged, and safe! Invaluable runs for Australia, to keep their tournament hopes alive"
a baseball biff back through the line of the ball. Stokes sticks out a hand to limit the damage
"width, and cracked down the ground, straight to long off. Good contact, but too straight"
"hacked into the leg side, and that's some ropey fielding at midwicket to allow them to get back for two. Well played Travis Head, his defiant biffing has given Australia a toe-hold in a must-win game."
starts with a full toss outside off and Roy connects pretty sweetly to send it fine of mid-off for four first ball
"struck in front, Roy in a tangle... and after an age to think about it, Kumar Dharmasena raises his finger! Roy doesn't consult with his partner but quickly requests a <b>review</b>, but straight away this looks optimistic; no bat, hit on the knee, did it pitch outside leg? NO! Another single-figure score for Roy, his horror run continues and Starc makes an immediate incision into the England batting. GAME ON!!"
"very full, sliding down the leg side, Root skelps it down to fine leg for one"
"pitched up, around off stump, 141kph/88mph and Hales gets in behind it to block to cover"
"full outside off, no swing for Starc and Hales stays still and belts it straight to extra cover"
"full again and met on the front foot, defended to the off side"
"full, nibbly length, wants the pitch to help him out, bit of a leading edge on Root's prod but it beats cover and runs for one"
"got him, nicked to slip! Hazlewood finds the perfect either-or length, hits the seam around off stump and Hales is frozen in position as he pushes tentatively, gets a big, thick edge and it loops to first where Finch clasps it low down"
"full, angled across in the channel, Morgan watches it through"
"tighter line, Morgan steps forward on off stump and shows it a straight bat in defence"
"rising from slightly back of a length, 137kph/85mph in the channel, left alone"
"touch short, angled across and again there's no stroke"
pitched up and pushed square on the off side coming forwards
"in the channel, length ball but no swing and Root leaves it be"
tight lines around off and Root leans into a solid block
"pitched up, beginning to tail back in as Root clears his feet out of the way and clips towards mid-on"
"crisply struck, Root's first shot in anger, gets his weight coming forwards and lasers four through point"
"slanted across the bows, touch wide and not coming back in, Root shoulders arms"
"back of a length around off stump, steered to point"
"skips down, trying to disrupt Hazlewood, turns the length into a half-volley and although it is 143kph/89mph he just uses that to his advantage, hammering his first boundary through the covers"
now Hazlewood drops short but there's width and Morgan is back to slash hard in front of square for four more
slightly short and wide again and Morgan cracks it hard but straight to the man at cover
"round the wicket, overpitched and that is a sweet straight drive, leans on a push and it races away past mid-on to the rope for a third boundary in the over"
"<b>dropped!</b> Hazlewood goes short, down the leg side and Morgan gets something on it - but <b>Wade can't hold on</b> diving full stretch to his right and it runs towards fine leg for a couple more. He went for it one-handed when two might have been better"
"<b>edged but short</b> this time! Four more to the England cause, Root was feeling for it without foot movement but the nick landed short of the the cordon and flew between first and second slip"
"pitched up and this time Root gets a clean connection, driven with better footwork although it won't quite go all the way"
"Starc stays over the wicket, good length around fourth stump, defended"
"puts it on a length, holding its line around off, softly blocked"
"fuller, in the channel, Morgan swings his axe and chops the ball to point on the bounce"
"full, fast and furious, 147kph/92mph but wide of the stumps and Morgan latches on to the square drive, again Maxwell at backward point cuts it off"
"touch too full and straight, whipped off the pads, Head misfields at midwicket and they runs a couple"
"good ball, rising from a length in the channel, past the outside edge as Root prods on the back foot"
"moves down the pitch, flicks to leg and it diverts away fine, Hazlewood appeals but Gaffaney isn't interested"
"gone, the outside edge this time snapped up by Wade! Another big breakthrough, Hazlewood clenches his fists as Root departs, more excellent line bowling and it nipped to kiss the edge, a simple catch for the keeper this time"
"an lbw appeal first ball, Stokes trapped on the crease, thudding into the knee roll...! Gaffaney shakes his head, looked like it pitched outside leg"
"length ball on middle and off, defended off the inside half of the bat"
"full and wide and crunched unceremoniously through point by Morgan to get us restarted with a boundary, much to the delight of the crowd"

into line to defend
"squeezed into the leg side, another cheer goes up for the single. Edgbaston is enjoying itself today"
"firmly into line, good attacking delivery, probing the stumps from round the wicket"
another nudge into the covers
"works the single once again, Australia can't have fielders everywhere"

"a touch slower, a touch wider"
open-faced push down the ground to long-on
"could this be the breakthrough? A loose slap down the ground, but no! It bounces short of the fielder, clatters off his shins, and away to the rope. Oh misery..."

"pulled from back of a length, out through square leg"
"short, pulled, but Buttler plays an air shot as the ball hops through to the keeper"
"a whistling bouncer, Buttler dips out of a pull. Gets away with the wide on height"

advances and smears into the off side
"solid block, covering the stumps with a big stride"
"on the pads, worked to the leg side"
