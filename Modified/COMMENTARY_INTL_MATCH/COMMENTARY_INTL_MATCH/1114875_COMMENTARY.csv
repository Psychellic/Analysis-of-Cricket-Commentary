"full and around the same line again. This time he has hammered a straight drive, to the left of mid-off. Shot"
"short of a length, pitches outside leg, tucked to midwicket for one"
"<b>edged and taken</b>. Sandhu provides the breakthrough with an off-cutter that bounces more than expected. Tight line outside off, so draws the batsman forward and forces him to play at it. Because of the lack of pace, the edge doesn't quite carry but does well to compensate for that by diving forward to take the catch"
"fullish on the stumps, defended down the pitch"

"full toss, angled in at leg stump, pushed back and Green dives to his right to make a clean stop with his outstretched right hand"
punched into the off side
lots of loop and flight. Giving the room absolutely no room to open up. Choking him with tight lines. Another leg-stumpish full slider that's been pushed out down the pitch. Top over. Thunder nicely building pressure here

"comes down the track and tries to heave, gets it down to wide long-on off the inside of the bat"
"flat back of a length, punched to long-on from front of leg stump"
loses shape as he comes down the ground and lofts this one. Probably because of the drift. Seemed a bit too sharp. It was the right length but he was opened up slightly because of the ball going away from him and skewed it off the splice to hole out to long-on
"a flat length ball, gets down for a sweep but cannot middle it"
"this time it's the right length to be playing that shot. Full and enough room, a slog sweep through midwicket"
"<b>superb catch at long-on</b> Or is it?. Gets down for another slog but this time the ball's been slanted across more sharply to him, leaving him to fetch it from outside off. Skews it off the splice of the bat to long-on. But there is lot of power so it still carries quite a distance. The fielder takes it reverse-cupped but was moving back and as the momentum carries him towards the ropes, he throws the ball in the air, steps out, comes back into the field of play and completes the catch. But he didn't release the ball in time. Still a good effort"
""
"a poor shot. Goes for a flick which was a poor shot to begin with as it's against the turn, especially with the ball slanted across. But this one's a googly which spins in to beat the inside edge and take out off-stump"

innovative. Gets in position for a scoop over the keeper's head. Sees the line and instead does a reverse scoop through the off side to third man

"length ball, slanted across from around the wicket. A negative line. Launched straight over"
