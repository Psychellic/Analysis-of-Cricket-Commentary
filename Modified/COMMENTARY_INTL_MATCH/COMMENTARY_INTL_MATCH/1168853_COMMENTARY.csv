"loud shout for lbw, but that pitched outside leg and struck him on the pads"
"angled across him, on a length and ends up on off, pushed to cover"
"fuller length, keeps it tight on off stump, and Kamran doesn't have the room to free his arms, can just push it into the off side"
"play and a miss! Keeps to that tight line but pulls his length back a tad, and the extra bounce has Kamran feeling for the ball. He's fortunate that didn't take the edge, was close to his bat on off stump"
"back of a length on the pads, and flicked to deep square leg. Tanvir, who has just completed an over, was running around to field, so they steal a second"
"there's the pace Hasnain has become famous for. Back of a length on off, Imam was running down the track and giving himself room. Wanted to crash it through cover but done in by the pace and bounce, doesn't connect"
"<b>got him!</b> no opening partnership heroics today. The pacy Hasnain gets it to bounce a fair bit from a hard length. Imam was coming down the track again, despite failing to do it successfully last ball, and he gets a top edge from his attempted swipe that swirls in the air before settling into mid-off's hands"
"back of a length outside off and shaping away from the batsman, he lets it go through"
"<b>they've opted to review an lbw call</b> The batsman was moving across the stumps to flick and Hasnain got it to move in off a length and pinged him on the knee roll. However, DRS shows that it was bouncing just over the stumps. Looked very close in real time, which prompted the review."
"<b>crashed</b> Kamran shows his good form. This was a little too short and wide, gave him the room to free his arms and he absolutely flayed it through the off side for a boundary"
steered to third man
"nice tight line, stump to stump and on a length, and all Kamran can do is tap it into the offside"
"strays on the pads that time, which allows Kamran to move across and flick it to deep midwicket"
"strays on the pads again, and Kamran wants to tickle it fine but doesn't get enough on it. Just a single to short fine leg"

"fullish on off, pushed to mid-off"
"<b>welcomed with a massive hit</b> that was in the slot, Kamran got down on one knee, and picked it up from outside off to slog sweep powerfully , way into the midwicket stands"
"another slog-sweep, but only got the bottom half of the bat on that one. Still hit so hard that it found the boundary at deep midwicket"
changes his line by firing it into the leg stump. Kamran was going for <i>another</i> slog sweep but it was too close tohis body and he misses it
backs away and cuts this length ball to point from the stumps
"<b>smashed</b> gives himself room again, ends up well outside off. This was full outside off and he crashes it through the offside for a crackling boundary"
"<b>the bowler has the last laugh</b> Backing away had worked for Kamran but he chose to shimmy down the track for this one. Nawaz shortened his length, got it to pitch on leg and turn away past the swinging bat to rattle the stumps. Kamran has thrown it away here, he was looking supremely dominant. Nawaz is pumped, as is Sarfaraz behind the stumps"
"starts off with a slower ball, but Maqsood has read it. Too full and he just leans into his push. Such great timing on that, it beats extra cover comfortably and races to the fence"
"keeps to a full length but on leg stump that time, driven to long-on"
"<b>through Umar Akmal's legs at cover</b> a single turns into a double. That was a well disguised slower one, and dipped suddenly on the batsman. He managed to push it away, but Umar made a mess of that"
"fuller on off, driven fluently but straight to cover"
"back of a length and on the off stump line, steered to point"
"length ball on off, punched to cover"
"<b>dropped by Ahmed Shehzad running back at extra cover</b> What a fairytale start it would have been for Fawad! Googly first up, draws him into a drive, and the leading edge flies up. Shehzad seemed to have it covered, Bravo was hovering nearby, but he couldn't hold on"
""
"length ball on the stumps, pushed to long-on"
"<b>big appeal but not given</b> googly pitched outside leg, he went for a sweep and was struck on the pads. May have pitched outside leg"
another googly turning in from leg stump and hits the pads. Half appeal but that had pitched outside and Fawad knows it
"googly again, but slightly short, pulled to mid-on"
"given some air, on a length on middle stump and turning away, pushed to point. Needless shy at the stumps, no one backing up, so they get a run"
"beaten and loud appeal! but he was struck just outside the line. He's getting it to dip nicely, and the batsman was drawn into coming forward. Went for the drive but was beaten, with the ball spinning into him and rapping pad. Rolls away to short third man"
"length ball on off, pushed between point and cover"
"fullish on the stumps, patted back to the bowler"
"a little shorter, spinning into off stump, he gets behind it and punches to long-on"

"googly, pushed into the offside"
"nicely tossed up, he was coming down the track but it dips on his toes, and he can only push it into the offside. Another googly"
"<b>sneaks through</b> that was the leg break, pitched on off and spun away, he wanted to cut it but doesn't connect"
worked from off stump to deep midwicket
"<b>shot</b> another googly tossed up but he seemed to have read it, and came down the track to smash it back over the bowler's head. First authoritative stroke off Fawad"
"another googly, this one turns sharply, he moves back and swipes across the line to midwicket"
"given some air outside off, he takes a stride out with bat close to pad and steers it to point's left"
"angled into him, quicker one. Defended off the front foot"
"shorter and even quicker, that came on to him too quickly. He wanted to pull it into the stands, but gets the high part of the bat and the ball drops near him on the off side"
pushed to cover for a single
"<b>too short and hammered</b> that sat up and asked to be hit, and he pulled it from outside off to the midwicket boundary"
"better length, spinning back into him from outside off and he can only flick it to short midwicket"
"<b>through him</b> was he waiting for the slower ball? That one cut back in sharply from outside off and Maqsood is very late on it, goes between bat and body to the keeper"
"<b>peachy</b> a little shorter and a little wider outside off, and Maqsood cuts it delicately but with superb timing to send it racing to the third man fence. He played it square and the third man fielder who was fine runs but can't cut it off"
"<b>caught  at long-off</b> This is clever bowling by Bravo, one of the foremost experts in this format. He bowled at normal pace the first two balls and even conceded a boundary. This one is the slower one that dips on the batsman, and Maqsood is too early into his lofted drive. Ends up toe-ending it and is caught comfortably by long-off running to his left"
And now he bowls a short one that snorts up at the batsman's throat
"back of a length on off and Amin opens the face of the bat while driving to find the third man fence. Fawad Ahmed is the fielder, but he's not going to risk the broken jaw diving, so it's a four"
