"negotiates the short ball well. Gets on top of the bounce and turns it to the leg side for a quick single. The non-striker made the run possible, was alert"
"shapes back into middle and leg, worked with the angle to deep fine leg. Cook's a good player off his pads"

"full outside off, left alone this time"
"wrong line. Too full and way down leg, Elgar watches it slide down as Watling moves low to his right to stop that"
"stifled appeal for lbw, but this was sliding down leg. Didn't swing enough for the umpire to be interested. Elgar was overbalanced as he looked to nurdle that past square lg."

"probing line and length, just in and around that off stump channel. Elgar leaves again"
"touch shorter in length and around the fifth stump, left alone"

"this is much better from Wagner, angles this back in from wide of the crease, Elgar has the line of the ball covered as he blocks"
"slants a length ball across the right-hander, left alone"
"short of length delivery angled across, this one doesn't nip back in which meant there was the width for Cook, but he's happy to watch it through to the keeper"
"just a shade fuller this time, in that in-between channel around the fourth stump. Cook doesn't press forward, nor does he go back. Leaves from the crease"

"too full outside off, easy leave this time"

"touch short this time, whipped straight to square leg"

"length delivery outside off, this one nips away off the seam and Elgar lets it go"
gets back and across as he defends the short of length delivery to the off side
"lucky to get away. Too straight and on the pads, flicked straight to midwicket. Opportunity missed by Elgar"
"doesn't get hold of the pull, too high on the bat but into the gap between midwicket and mid-on. Beaten for pace this time. This was dug in short at 143 clicks"
"error in judgment has cost Cook big time. This is full and swings back in late, Cook leaves in anticipation of the ball holding its line, but is in front of middle. He didn't even bother consulting his partner for a review. Kumar Dharmasena immediately raised his index finger. <B> Umpire's call, says Hawkeye </B>"

"slider that goes on with the arm, Amla beaten on the forward prod. So, so close to the outside edge. Superb delivery"

"defended to the leg side, but he's far from convincing. This time, it was full on middle from wide of the crease but didn't have the late movement."
much more authority in the defense this time. Gets back and turns the incoming length delivery to the leg side
"delightful drive down the ground. He was put under the hammer with a succession of away-going deliveries, but that wasn't going to stop him from leaning into a drive if the ball was too full. Lovely sound as ball met bat, raced past mid-on"
"moves away from length outside off, left alone"
"full and angling away late, rolls off the outer half of the bat to cover. Looked to flick but was nearly done in by the late movement."

"slides one down leg, Elgar looks to tickle it fine but misses. Fine take by Watling"
"not much turn, but so so accurate. Drifts one to middle, he gets forward and blocks"
"tossed up beautifully.  The ball curves back in and then dips on the batsman, who pushes forward and defends"
"slides back in from wide of the crease, Elgar leaves, Watling fails to get across in time to stop that. He'd be disappointed with that. Should have collected that."
"yorker-length delivery on off, squeezed to point"
"got him, beauty!The bowling change has worked for New Zealand! t was full and swung back in late. Amla's feet didn't even move an inch as he looked to drive, left the gap between bat and pad wide open as the ball cannoned into the middle stump."

"right into the blockole again from wide of the crease, Elgar digs it back to the bowler"
worked off the pad to midwicket as they scamper a quick single
"rip roaring bouncer that kept coming back in from wide of the crease to cramp Duminy for room. He looked to pull, then decided to simply sway out of the way. At Wagner's pace, you can't really be indecisive. There is a big spike on snicko, which points to the glove. It then hits the helmet on the way to Ross Taylor at first slip. South Africa in disarray."
"floats one back in from around the stumps, turned to the leg side"
grip and turn this time as Elgar stabs one to the off sside
firm push but straight to mid-off. Little too full this time
"turn, bounce. Puff of dust? Phew. This drifts in, Elgar is committed to a forward defense, but the ball suddenly spits on him. Not far from the glove."
"skids on with the arm, lets it go and realises it was very close to the off stump. Real test this for South Africa"
"tossed up beautifully, inviting the drive. Elgar doesn't play at that"

"this one's full and there to drive. Not much movement back in, and Faf is happy to let that go"
plants his front foot forward and punches a full delivery to mid-off
"excellent effort at square leg. Short, and Faf swivelled to pull that one. Got hold of it, but Neesham was too good. Saved a few runs for the side"

"lands it at length on off stump, defended gently"

"floats this full on the stump from wide of the crease, defended back down the pitch"

"touch too full on off stump, squeezed to mid-off"

"this is full, furious and fast. Just a touch around off, Elgar gets his bat down in the nick of time. Both feet were in the air. Looks like he was expecting a short ball."

"full on middle, flicked to mid-on"

"right into the blockhole, jams his bat down in the nick of time to keep that out"

"width on offer, punched between cover and mid-off as they scamper a quick single"

hops across and bunts an incoming length delivery back to the bowler
"way too loose. Too much width, Elgar rocks back and cracks that into the gap at backward point. Delightful timing"

gets forward and defends a full-length delivery with an angled bat towards gully
"too full and angling in from wide of the crease, driven to mid-on"
this is a back of length delivery that jags back in from outside off. Faf plays outside the line but gets the thinnest of inside edges. It looks like Faf reviewed because of height. That's what his gesture suggested. Does that mean he didn't hit it?
"length ball on middle, defended back down the pitch"
"full and wide outside off, left alone"
"digs in a short ball at 140 clicks, Faf decides to take him on and fetches a pull from outside off, but is perhaps undone by the zip.

worked with the spin to midwicket

sways out of the way of that short ball angled in from around the stumps
"digs a short ball down leg, Elgar ducks under that one"
"seventh Test century for Elgar. Lucky to be reprieved earlier in the day but he's cashed in big time. Too short, he swivels back and then pulls him all along the ground to the deep square leg boundary."

gets half-forward and eases the incoming full delivery back down the pitch
"off the mark with a boundary. Width on offer, he leans into the drive, and eases it behind square with an angled bat"
"pulled. It was high, in the air for a long long time. Wagner had a lot of work to do as he was running around from deep fine leg to deep square to get underneath that top edge. Tried his best, and couldn't get there despite a dive. Handy runs, lucky Bavuma"
"too full on the pads, clipped between midwicket and mid-on. Much more confident while playing off the front foot"
thick inside edge down to deep square leg
stays inside the crease and uses the width on offer to steer the short ball to deep point
there for the slash but Bavuma decides to let it go
"this time he gets hold of it. Too short, Bavuma gets on top of the bounce and punches the short ball behind point. Lovely timing"
"frustration, perhaps? Bavuma squeezes a yorker back to Neesham who fires a throw back at the batsman's end, they get a run off the deflection to fine leg"
"floats this full and wide outside off, left alone"
""
"full outside off again, he stretches forward and defends"

"short ball outside leg from around the stumps, little away from Elgar's ribs and so he isn't troubled as he watches it through to the keeper"
"this one is a little more awkward, closer to the body. Elgar is forced to move just a little more to avoid that"

stretches forward and lets go the in-drifter from wide outside off

worked across the line down to long-on as they jog the single
"this one slides past the outside edge. Pushed through quicker from around the stumps, he looked to work it leg side but the ball went on with the angle"

"too full and far too wide for Bavuma to reach out to play, he still tries to but doesn't lay bat on it"

excellent leave. This one angles back in but the line is again from way outside off.
"inside-edge back onto the pad and then towards the keeper, who dives to his left to stop that. Bavuma caught on the move, with better luck that would have sneaked through for Boult. This is exactly what he's been trying all morning - getting the batsman to drive"

defended from the crease. The delivery is much fuller for him to attempt that but no damage done
"edged but it hasn't carried to Ross Taylor at first slip. Could Watling have tried to dive full-length to his left to catch that? I definitely think so. That was the only way a wicket could have been completed. That said, it would have taken a superhuman effort from the keeper. Lucky break for Elgar. The late away movement nearly did him in, Elgar went really hard at that and it still didn't carry to slip."

"beauty from Wagner! Genuine effort ball and his persistence has paid off. Absolute snorter, troubled him with the short ball earlier today. This is a short ball just around off stump, Elgar is caught on the hop, not sure whether to play or leave. Thought of pulling it initially, but at Wagner's pace, you can't have two minds. The ball keeps coming back in to take the edge on the way through to Watling. Big, big wicket. Big moment"

De Kock was itching to go after him, looks to drive but this wasn't quite there, didn't get to the pitch but went through. He ended up slicing it to Wagner, who dived forward to complete an excellent catch at backward point."

gets a touch outside the line of the stumps as he blocks that away-going length ball
"take that! He's flat-batted the pull past mid-on. A touch of arrogance from the ever-so-humble Bavuma this time. Aggressive batting, sees the ball short and takes toll of it. He could have so easily gone into his shell after de Kock's wicket. Excellent batting this"

"length on off from around the stumps, defended to the off side"
"goes for a big booming drive, but went too hard. Gets a thick inside edge to the leg side. He was down on one knee, looking to carve it over the off side"
"floated full and wide outside off, left alone"
gets across the stumps and works the incoming delivery to midwicket
"just kept moving too much around the crease and Boult has reaped the rewards. Why would you mess around with your footwork suddenly? Went far too across to work it to the leg side, but could only manage to glove an incoming length ball down the leg side to the keeper. Had he stayed still at the crease, he may have managed to nudge it down to fine leg. New Zealand are chipping away. Handy knock nonetheless from the little man"
"welcomed with a short ball outside off, he ducks under it. Too high according to the umpire"
behind the line of that delivery as he bunts it back to the bowler
"drifting down leg, good take by Watling as Philander misses the tickle down leg side"
"once again on leg stump, worked to backward square leg"
"beats leg slip. Turn, bounce, plenty of revs. Philander gets plenty of wood on that as he looks to turn it wide of square leg. Handy runs"
worked with the spin to the midwicket region
thick edge that rolls toward gully as they complete a quick single
"on the flatter side, worked to square leg"
"short, wide and is lucky to get away. Maharaj is hesitant on the cut, just puts his bat out at that. Ball rolls off the bottom to cover"
behind the line of this length ball as he defends to the off side
"how has that fallen short, I don't know. Lack of timing saves Maharaj. Late on the pull. Surprise bouncer, he looks to pull and it comes off the splice. Second slip, gully came running in but couldn't get there"
pushed off the back foot to cover
"he's picked the bones out of that this time. Rocks back, pulls him in front of square. Picked the length early, the field was up too"
sways out of the way of that short ball angling away
"slider across the batsman from around the stumps, defended off the back foot"
cuts and misses. Extra bounce from outside off meant it was a high-risk stroke
"gets this to drift across the batsman, bunted to cover"
crunching cover drive. Way too full and he took full toll of that. Got forward and hammered that
""
once again too full and he leans into the drive before easing it through cover. Lovely timing
"reward again for Boult, brought about by another short ball. Maharaj looks to fetch the pull from outside off again, but is beaten for pace again. Gets it high on the bat and Neesham at midwicket couldn't have asked for a simpler catch."
"rip roaring bouncer just around off stump, Rabada gets out of the way"
"took off from length. Played inside the line, the ball whizzed past the outside edge as Rabada was squared up. New Zealand reviewed it for caught behind. There was no real appeal, either from the bowler or wicketkeeper. Did they just take it then because they haven't taken any so far this innings? Anyway, straightforward decision for the third umpire. Hotspot showed nothing on the bat as the ball whizzed past. Clear daylight infact so Dharmasena's decision stays"
"too full on the pads, clipped off his pad into the gap at midwicket. Sloppy running though. Rabada plonked his bat, but didn't drag it inside the crease before turning for the second. Lost his bat too while turning. Comical stuff. One run short"
"full on middle and leg, worked with the angle to midwicket"
"full and tailing in from outside off, Rabada gets a thick inside edge onto the pad"
"short delivery on middle and leg, Philander allows it to thud into his body"

driven with the spin to cover
"comes back in from wide of the crease, Rabada lunges forward and plays it with a straight bat"
<b> run-out opportunity missed. </b> Boult fired an accurate throw at the striker's end after they chanced a single off an edge to short third man. Watling collected the ball but just missed the stumps completely as he disturbed the thin air around it. <b> Lunch it will be. </b>
starts off with a short ball that whizzes past the gloves as Rabada sways out of the way
pulled but lands between square leg and deep fine leg. Didn't get hold of the pull because it got big on him and hti the top part of the bat. Also had to fetch it from outside off.
gets behind the line of that full delivery and blocks
gets forward and bunts the incoming delivery to the leg side
too short and way over the batsman's head to cause any trouble
"back from over the wicket, and finishes with another short ball which Philander ducks under"

driven with the spin back to the bowler
"quicker through the air, lands it on middle, bunted back down the pitch"
"drifting in from wide of the crease, worked to the leg side"
"beaten in flight. Went for the drive again but the ball dipped on him and beat the swing. This was a fraction wider too, which meant Rabada could free his arms. Missed it by quite a distance"
"bringing in all the wares and guile he can possess, rewarded this time. Shoulders arms to an in-drifter that pitches outside off and keeps coming back in to hit off stump. He never looked comfortable at any stage."
gets a good stride forward and blocks
played inside the line of that full delivery that snaked back in from around the stumps and hit him on the body off a thick inside edge
squared up by the length but no damage done as he dabs it back down the pitch
"rip roaring bouncer at 138 clicks. Keeps coming back in from wide of the crease, Philander gets out of the way"
"the leg stump is flattened. Sucker ball. Short ball followed by a full and furiously fast delivery. Philander was in no position. Perhaps was expecting another short ball, and so didn't move at all. The ball sneaked through the big gap between bat and pad to crash into the stumps."
"starts off with a pacy length ball angling across, Latham shoulders arms"
"short of length delivery outside off, nips away further, left alone"
"drops it gently to cover and scoots off for a touch-and-go run. Raval was late to take off, Bavuma came swooping in from point and fired a throw at the striker's end. No direct hit coupled with Raval's dive. Drama"
solid punch down the ground past mid-of. Confidently done. Got forward and offered the full face of the bat to the away-going delivery

shoulders arms to a length ball angling away
"starts off with short of length delivery angling away, Raval watchfully lets that go"
"in that fourth stump channel at length again, left alone. Plenty of oooohs and aaaahs at the moment"
"this one pitches at length outside off and nips back in, but still not doing enough to worry Raval, who lets it go"
"shapes to drive, then leaves but nearly too late. Ball rolls off the toe-end of the bat to slip as he tries to withdraw"
solid defense this time. Much more authority as he plants his front foot forward to negate the away going delivery. Much fuller on middle
once again bat close to the pad as he defends the length ball on middle and off
"angles this in from wide of the crease, pitches and leaves Latham, who watches it through to the keeper"
"shortens his length, gets some lift off the deck from outside off, left alone"
"through third slip and gully. Half-hearted push with an angled bat, the swing ensures the ball flies off the edge. Didn't go hard at it, however"

gets half-forward and taps the length ball to the off side
too short and way over Raval's head as he ducks under it
"dabs it gently to the off side and scampers a run. Rabada is quick to run across to his right, pick the ball up and fire a throw at the batsman's end. High-risk, but he was in this time"
"straightens after pitching, he looks to work it through midwicket but changes his mind and simply defends with a straight bat"
"beauty! Full and around the off stump channel, Raval plays and misses"
gets half-forward and turns the length ball to mid-on
"this one veers back in from middle, Raval is solidly behind the line of the ball as he dabs it gently"

"too full outside off, Williamson is happy to let that go"
"this was very, very close. Far too risky for just one run. Drop it gently towards Bavuma coming in from point and takes off for a single. The throw is fired at the bowler's end but it misses. Anxiety from Raval? Has happened thrice"

shows the full face of the bat as he defends the incoming length ball to mid-on
"gets half-forward again, this one is coming back in towards off stump, carefully defended"
"went for the drive, didn't quite it it off the middle. Outside half but it races away past point. Bavuma hares across all the way to the boundary and pulls it back in"

gets forward and then lets go a full-length delivery that nips away

half-tracker on middle and it gets the treatment it deserved. Pulled so hard that it brushed Cook's fingers at short leg and deflected to the boundary. Cook was trying to take evasive action. He seems to be in a lot of pain. Williamson apologises.

"drifting in from around the stumps, he gets forward and blocks"
"touch short, he goes back and taps it to the off side"

eased with the angle to mid-on
"swept from outside off to deep backward square leg. Not too risky since he got well outside the line to play it, thereby eliminating the lbw risk. Half-century stand has been raised too"

makes some room and punches the short ball wide of point

as easy as it gets for a batsman. Half-volley on leg stump and Raval accepts it with glee. Flicks it nonchalantly past midwicket. Pinged the middle of his bat.

"and this time he shows his back foot play. Drops short, he goes back into the crease and opens the bat face late to ease it behind point. He let the ball slide in on that  occasion. <b> 26th Test fifty </b>"
"full and wide outside off, left alone"
stretches forward and blocks
"full and straight on middle, he gets forward and smothers the spin"
"wicket against the run of play. He can't believe what  he's just done. Chipped straight to midwicket. Looked like the ball stopped on him too.

"missed a boundary off the previous delivery because he hit it too straight. This time, he crunches that half-volley into the cover boundary. Nice high elbow as ball met bat, what timing. Lovely to watch"

"this one's pitched up outside off, hint of movement away, left alone"
"short ball outside off, he gets out of the way without any trouble"
gets a thick inside edge on an attempted nudge to the leg side. Rabada got the ball to tail back in late

"back of length delivery outside off, hint of movement away, left alone"
"angles a length ball into middle from wide of the crease, eased to the leg side"
"Absolute hara-kiri, nearly cost New Zealand. Williamson has been saved by a desperate lunge into the crease. This was whipped into the gap at deep square. Nicholls was jogging the second, and then suddenly realised Williamson had turned for the third. Stump mic picks up Nicholls yelling 'wait, wait' which Williamson perhaps didn't hear. Nicholls eventually put his hand out, which meant Williamson had no option but to turn back. The throw was relayed to Philander by de Kock. The ball was collected cleanly and stumps broken, but Williamson was saved by the last-ditch attempt"

"full and moving away from off stump, solidly defended"
stays inside the crease and blocks the length ball that nips back in from off stump
"snuffed out at first slip, and South Africans are over the moon. That is an outstanding catch by Amla. Diving away with his left hand stretched out to pluck that low catch. Nicholls is tentative in his forward push, the ball flies off the left. Amla is a little too straight and moves spontaneously, gets his hand underneath the ball and ensures he has complete control of it even as his shoulder touched the ground. The umpires wanted to be fully sure and so went upstairs. The soft signal was out and there wasn't much really to overturn. Moments of inspiration like these can turn the Test. Potentially a big moment."
this one is squeezed past slip. Everything's happening now. Jeetan Patel will be one nervous man

"sharp turn on a flatter delivery from middle, pushed to short mid-on"

"gets forward and keeps that one out by playing with the bat and pad close to each other. Not necessarily the best thing to do, but no harm done this time around"
"just falls short of de Kock. Genuine edge. Honing it on off stump, this one moves away ever-so-slightly. Williamson has to play at it but does so with soft hands."

gets half-forward and punches the good length delivery to cover
"angles in the length ball from wide of the crease, Patel hops back and defends"

"lands this at length outside off, pushed to cover point"
"the skipper has taken an outstanding one-handed catch at second slip. Philander drew him forward with his length, Patel pushes away from the body and gets a thick edge, Faf at second slip instinctively puts his right hand out, the ball bobbles out for a split second even as both feet are in the air, but he recovers quickly to complete the catch on the second attempt."

big appeal but the umpire says no. Neesham was looking to pull but it wasn't really there for the stroke. Touch too full and he's hit on the right pad. Looked extremely ungainly. <b> Saved by an inside edge. </b>
"nips away off the seam from middle, watched through to the keeper"

"too short and angling down leg, Neesham ducks under it"
"play and a miss. Way outside off and too full, was there to hit it but the feet went nowhere. Simply threw the hands at the ball"
"this was coming. It really was a matter of time. Morkel bowls this at length outside off, there is very minute deviation off the seam. Neesham feels the need to flirt at that, like he did with the previous delivery, and this time gets a healthy edge through to the keeper. The umpires went upstairs for the no-ball. It may have been just over the line. Didn't look like there was aything behind the crease. Some nervous moments for South Africa as they waited for the decision to be relayed to Kumar Dharmasena. Morkel has been given the benefit of doubt. These are the kind of decisions you want to avoid as a TV umpire. Plenty of deliberation before the decision has been upheld."

"in the air, and in the gap. Took nearly an hour for his first run, and less than two minutes for a boundary. Short, wide and he's cracked that into the gap at point."

"drops it a touch short, punched back to the bowler"
"the ball is nicely tossed up. It comes back in slightly with the drift. Watling plays down the wrong line and doesn't account for the turn. He's hit on the back pad. The only question was if there was too much turn and if it would have missed off stump. There's no bat for sure, as confirmed by hotspot. Hawkeye confirms he was hit on the arm first, so that's the point of impact and it was missing the stumps. <b> Oxenford's decision overturned. </b>"

"sublime timing. Fractionally short, he goes back deep into the crease and whips this one to the midwicket boundary."
"he could have run himself out. A direct hit from mid-on, but he just about makes it. Faf du Plessis had to run a long way around to pick the ball up, didn't have the power in the throw as well."
sharp turn. Drifts in and then beats the outside edge on the forward push
there's his <b> 16th Test century. </b> Took an hour to get off the mark but he's been a different batsman since. This one's swept - taken on the full - to Rabada at deep fine leg. The crowd stands up to applaud a superb knock. Couldn't have asked for a better freebie to get to the landmark. <b> He's just one behind Martin Crowe's New Zealand record. </b>

gone soon after his half-century. Third wicket for Maharaj and it's a beauty of a delivery. This is the arm-ball that skids back in and fizzes through to beat Watling's defense. He misjudged the length completely. It looked like he was trying to work that to the leg side but it kept coming back in to cramp him for room and sneak deflect off the back pad onto the stumps.

"goes for a big booming drive, little too ambitious, beaten this time"
"that's a wicket that will do any spinner proud. Slowed it up nicely, Boult was lured into the big hit. Stepped out and looked to swing that to Wellington, but missed it altogether as he's deceived in flight and the middle stump is disturbed. Fourth wicket for Maharaj"

hops across the stumps and defends the short of length delivery back down the pitch
"first strike for New Zealand and it's a regulation catch for the wicketkeeper. Full and swinging back in from off stump, Cook fiddles outside off with minimal feet movement, gets a thin edge, or so it looks. The pad was very close to the bat as well.

"<strong>Chipped to Southee</strong>, the sub fielder. Wagner makes the incision. Back of a length and around off, stops on Amla. He attempts a flick.

Umpire's call it is and Duminy's luck runs out. Wagner strikes to break the stand and his fan club in the stands roars in approval"
