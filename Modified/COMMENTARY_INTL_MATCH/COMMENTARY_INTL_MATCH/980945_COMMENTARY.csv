"juicy half-volley to begin with, and that has been clobbered into the cover boundary at the rate of knots. Zak was looking for some swing back, but didn't come back in. Super start for the Lions"
"shortens his length immediately, floats it at length on middle, tapped back to the bowler"
"this one was a cutter on middle, there's a bit of grip, so Smith prods defensively, the ball flies off the thick outside edge into the third man bounday"
"JP Duminy and Quinton de Kock were looking at each other, as the ball flies through the gap between keeper and slip. Smith pokes at a length ball angling away, gets a thick edge that went at catchable height, but no one went for it"
"punched into the gap at wide long-off. Just a gentle push, these blades, I tell you"
"another edge, and another boundary towards third man. All Zak can do is smile. Genuine edge again as Smith pushes away from the body, gets a thick edge that runs past Duminy at a widish first slip"
"slides one into middle and leg, tucked wide of midwicket"
hit on the pad as he looks to work it past square leg
"solid punch in that stroke, rolls to Chris Morris at long-on"
"this one drifts back into middle and leg from wide of the crease, McCullum gets back into the crease and punches it to mid-off"
"clean strike down the ground. It wasn't a half-volley, but he simply lofted that on the up over mid-off, and got enough elevation to clear the ropes. Exquisite timing."
"sliding into the pads, flicked to deep midwicket. Rocking start this"
"plays across the line, but was hit on the flap of his right pad. Too high"
"back of a length delivery on off stump, punched to long-off"
"there was a man at deep cover specifically for that fierce cut, and Sanju Samson puts down a regulation catch. It was short and angling away, McCullum slapped it over cover, it was going straight down his throat, but Samson was a yard or two inside, which meant he had to leap high. In the end, he got the timing of his jump wrong. The trap was set though"
"moves inside the line of the ball to pull, but misses"
"he's biffed that over deep midwicket. Too short, and he picked the length early. Straight out of the middle as it sails over the ropes"
drops it with soft hands into the off side for a quick single
"too full and sliding down leg, flicked to square leg"
steps out and drives it down the ground to long-on
"boom! Carnage here at the Kotla. This was too short, he went back inside the crease and whipped it over midwicket. There was a man there, but he was a spectator."
"appeal for lbw as Smith misses the sweep, but S Ravi says no. The ball was once again sliding down with the angle, and there was a bottom edge too"
flicked with the angle to deep midwicket. <b> This is the fastest team fifty this season </b>
"pushed through quicker on middle and leg, turned wide of square leg for an easy single"
"rip roaring bouncer at close to 140 clicks outside off, McCullum looks to fetch the pull but is beaten for pace, good carry through to Quinton de Kock, who takes it in front of his face"
"another play and a miss. Didn't miss the off stump by much. This one was floated full around off stump, McCullum skipped down the pitch to swing that over cover. That was bowled at <b> 147kph </b> Wow"
"Didn't miss it this time. He was waiting for the full ball, it was straight into his hitting arc, and McCullum blasted it straight over the bowler's head. The ball hits the sightscreen"
"doesn't middle the pull, gets more height than distance, just eludes the infield, Nadeem pulls it back in"
"scoring opportunity missed, it was a gift - full toss sliding down leg - McCullum swings, but gets a bit of pad as it deflects to short fine leg"
"pulled imperiously in front of square. What was all the fuss about this being a slow, low wicket? It doesn't look like. Too short, McCullum pulls him in front of square over mid-on, one bounce into the boundary"
"slower one on middle, Smith's bottom hand is off the handle as he makes contact, the ball falls short of the square leg fielder"
"that went into the square leg boundary faster than it took to get to the bat. Not all that short, but it was premeditated and off the middle. Deep midwicket fielder hardly moved. Wow, this is something else"
"banged in short on middle, this one a lot quicker at 135kph, Smith ducks under it."
"slower one on middle, driven down the ground to long-off where Nadeem was caught napping"
"excellent inswinging yorker on middle, Smith jams his bat down in time to squeeze that to short fine leg"
"low full toss outside off, driven to Mishra at mid-off, there' s a fumble but they decide against the second run"
"some grip and turn from middle, McCullum gets back into the crease and pats it to the off side"
"one bounce into the deep square leg boundary. The change of ends hasn't helped. Too one-dimensional. Another delivery that is pushed through quicker, McCullum rocks back to  bisect the gap between the two fielders in the deep"
"Oh dear, it can't get worse, can it? Rishabh Pant, on IPL, debut dives over the ball at sweeper cover. It was short, he made room and smacked it hard off the backfoot. Things going haywire here for the Daredevils"
slapped off the backfoot to wide long-off
"slow turn from off stump, punched to long-off again"
"hit hard to mid-off, but they can't prevent the single"
"slides across the face of the bat, cleanly collected by de Kock. Rare dot ball"
"pounded over the in-field, one bounce into the long-off boundary. Too short, he bowled it flat as well, McCullum simply punches it over the bowler's head. The power of the bottom hand, oh!"
"deceived in flight, he looked to hammer it over deep extra cover, but was beaten by the turn. Flight and loop from Mishra on that occasion. That's more like it"
"short outside off, McCullum fetches the sweep from outside off, bisects deep square and deep midwicket. Rocket hit"
rocks back and crunches it behind point to the boundary rider
"the wrong-un which Smith doesn't pick, this one hits him on the left pad, a tad too high though"
"gentle full toss on middle, driven to long-on to bring up the <b> fastest fifty for Lions this season. </b> Beats Finch's record of a 32-ball fifty against KXIP"
"tossed up outside off, drilled to long-on, not afraid to slog across the line"
"slider on middle, he hops across and wrists it behind square leg"
gets forward and works it down to long-on
"it's the reverse sweep this time, the first of the night. Hit with the turn over short third man. Cheeky, innovative, whatever you call it. I must say it's mighty effective. Daredevils have no answers at the moment"
"McCullum is hit on the pad as he is foxed by the wrong-un, but it was sliding down leg, they get a leg bye though"
"short outside off, this one's crunched to deep cover"
"short and spinning away from outside off, pushed to sweeper cover, again"
"this one's a seam-up delivery, or was it? Fired in flat and wide outside off, McCullum let that go, well inside the wide line"
"quicker one outside off, hit hard towards long-off"
"sees the flight and gets underneath it to muscle it over the bowler's head, what a way to get to a fifty. Two fast balls followed by a loopy one, Smith didn't miss out. Clean swing of the bat. No respite for the bowlers"
cuts away towards deep cover
flicked across the line to deep midwicket
"first genuine opportunity since Sanju Samson's drop, and this one goes down too. Tahir set him up superbly by tossing it up nicely, McCullum went for the kitchen sink, only managed to skew it high in the air, Pant was running in from long-off, Tahir was running back. It looked like a collision was on, but both of them stopped and saw the ball land between them. No luck for Daredevils"
pushed to midwicket
"the flipper has done the trick. Smith plays back and across to one that skids back in from middle, missed it completely and the umpire took little more than a couple of nanoseconds to raise the finger. Not quite the 100-metre dash from Tahir this time, I'm disappointed. Relief for the Delhi Daredevils. They needed that bigtime!"
flicked with the spin towards deep midwicket
"low full toss on middle and leg, worked behind square towards deep fine leg"
"yorker-length on middle, he gets a leading edge towards third man"
"the bowling change has done the trick. Of all deliveries, it's the full toss that's rewarded Morris. It was a full toss, it looked like he rolled his fingers over the ball, McCullum was through with the wild swing even before the ball got to him, and the ball hit the base of middle stump"
"full and straight outside off, driven to Zaheer at mid-off, a misfield gives them a single"
hops back to the short ball and bunts it back down the pitch
"good bounce angled across the batsman, Raina gets back into the crease and fends that one without any hassle"
"two wickets in the over. First with a full one, now with the short ball. <b> Oh, the short ball has got Raina yet again. </b> This one was well-directed, on middle, Raina hopped across to work it behind square, but picked out the man at short fine leg. As easy as they come for Karun Nair. His feet were up in the air when he made contact."
gets forward and pats it wide of point for a quick single
"wrong-un on middle, Jadeja lunges forward and smothers the spin"
muscled but an excellent stop at midwicket by Raina
"sliding into middle and leg, tucked towards square leg, three fielders were converging, with none showing the urgency to stop the ball and hurl the throw. Back for the second easily"
gets back deep into the crease and turns it towards short midwicket for a quick single
"he's fetched that sweep from outside off, and has deposited it into the deep square leg boundary. Faulkner was upset with the previous six, not sure what his mood will be after that one. Some words exchanged between the two. It's heating up here."
worked across the line towards Negi at deep midwicket
"turns the bat facr early, gets a leading edge that falls short of cover"
"that  is a cracking drive. Short and wide outside off, he had committed to playing  a front foot stroke, just went through with the drive and placed it superbly into the gap between wide long-off and deep point"
"cuts and misses, this one fizzes after pitching outside off"
"lofted, one bounce to Samson at long-off"
"worked across the line past the bowler, it was the googly, but too short to make an impact"
"quicker one on middle and leg, tucked wide of square leg"
waits for it to spin back in and then works it off his hip towards deep square leg
"he's fallen to a short ball. Made room to cut, but the ball skid straight on, all Jadeja managed was a faint edge which was well pouched by Quinton de Kock, who got up with the bounce to make it look ridiculously easy. Gujarat Lions are losing momentum very quickly"
"this one drifts into middle and rips across the face of the bat, wow, superb"
worked across the line towards midwicket
flicked towards deep midwicket
"starts off with a tossed up delivery on middle, he gets forward and defends"
good stop by Zak at cover
worked across the line to long-on
"full toss on middle and leg, but he's lucky to get away. Kishan sweeps it straight to short fine leg"
flicked to deep backward square leg
excellent stop off his own bowling. Daredevils have tightened the screws.
"fired into middle and leg, Kishan looked to play the slog sweep, but was beaten for pace. The ball deflects off the pad to short third man"
"gets underneath the flight and deposits that over the boundary at long-off. Much-needed for the Lions. He fired it in, and ended up bowling it right in the hitting zone. The ball hits one of those camera lenses off the rebound from the sightscreen"
"wrong-un on middle, whipped over the infield to long-on"
"poor temperament or poor stroke? I'd say a mix of both. Why would you do that when you can simply bunt the ball into the big gaps for a single? Beautifully tossed up by Tahir outside off, Kishan goes for glory, but only manages a top edge that is well taken by Duminy at cover. The slide continues"
"another one bites the dust, and Tahir is off on his celebratory run. DK walks across to sweep, but only manages a top edge which JP Duminy takes diving low and forward at short fine leg."
driven towards sweeper cover
"useful runs, and it's not a boundary only because of Nadeem's brilliance. Faulkner backs away, opens the face of the bat and squeezes it over point, Nadeem ran nearly 30 yards to his right from third man, before diving full length forward to slide the ball back in. Top effort, all this for just one run."
"slower and fuller on middle, whipped to long-on"
"has to rebowl, it was short and angling down leg"
stays inside the crease and punches it back past the bowler to long-on
"backs away to go over cover, can only toe-end it to the man at the edge of the ring"
"looks to go over cover, but is deceived by the slower one, gets a thick inside edge to midwicket"
"he's picked the gap this time. Low full toss, he makes room and squeezes it into the deep point boundary. Welcome runs"
"he's helped the short ball straight to Nadeem at short fine. For some strange reason, he fires a throw at the bowler's end, where no one's backing up. They get another off the overthrow"
"rapped on the knuckles, but the ball drops to the off side and they sneak in a run"
"floats it full on middle, Faulkner walks across and flicks it into the gap at deep midwicket"
"deceived by the change of pace, looked to slap that over cover, but the ball grips off the surface and cuts away, bounced a little more than he expected as well"
"right into the blockhole, squeezed o wide long-on, Bravo turned swiftly for the second, the throw was wide"
"yorker-length ball outside off, hit towards long-off, terrific final over"
"makes room by going outside leg, Morris follows him and delivers a yorker towards his toes, worked wide of midwicket"
"another yorker on middle and leg, Bravo gets his front leg out of the way and squeezes it to deep midwicket"
"what was that? He looked to ramp it over third man, but the ball hit the side of is bat and rolled to square leg."
"pacy length ball on off stump, Bravo was looking to hit that into Noida, toe-ends the slog to long-on"
"has paid the price for a juicy full toss, Faulkner swings across the line and connects well. JP Duminy dives, but can't stop that at deep midwicket"
"too full outside off, Faulkner makes room and lofts it inside-out towards deep cover, didn't get it off the middle but they scoot back for the second"
"swing straightaway, this one pitches on the length area on middle and moves away, defended towards short midwicket"
"looks to turn it past square leg, but is hit high on the thigh pad, the ball deflects to the off side and they squeeze a run"
"timed well, but stopped by a diving Raina at point"
"gets that one to jag back into middle and off, punched to midwicket"
"tucked straight to midwicket, who was a couple of steps deep, easy single"
"once again beaten by the late swing, fails to account for the late inward movement as he looks to work it off his toes to midwicket, hit near the box"
"shapes away from the off stump, Samson has a poke, but pulls out just as the ball whizzes past the outside edge"
hops back into the crease and pats it with soft hands
"into the big bucket hands of Faulkner at mid-on. Once again, the late swing has got him. Samson looks to flick, but the full fall swings away to take the leading edge, and Faulkner takes an excellent catch running backwards. The move to promote Samson to open hasn't worked, but then with Iyer not around, don't think they had too many options. Just the start Lions would have hoped for."
"leans forward to drive, gets a thick inside-edge onto the pad"
"thumped on the up, but can't get it past Raina at cover. Another sliding stop"
"well-disguised slower one on middle, played back to the bowler. <b> Wicket-maiden for Dhawal </b>"
"hops back into the crease and turns his wrists at the last moment to play it towards deep square leg, the fielder there was late to get off the blocks"
firm drive to mid-off
"rolls his fingers across to bowl a well-disguised leg-cutter on off stump, worked wide of mid-on for a quick single"
"how close was that? Praveen Kumar is furious at that decision. The off-cutter again, pitched well outside leg, so can't be out. De Kock went across the stumps to scoop it over short fine, and missed it. It would have surely hit the stumps, but where it pitched matters. <b> Excellent decision by S Ravi </b>. We criticize the umpires for poor decisions, credit where due"
worked wide of midwicket for a quick single
"full and straight on middle, squeezed back to the bowler"
"picked away off the pad, but straight to deep midwicket. Sweet timing"
"he's swinging blindly here. Makes room to slap that over cover, but was nowhere near the line of the delivery. Pressure building on de Kock."
"thumped down the ground. He knew it was four the moment he hit the bat. Flat-batted swat, no chance for mid-off"
"skews it to Raina, who takes a simple catch at cover. De Kock was like a cat on a hot tin roof. Failed to time the ball whatsoever. This one was a slower one, he got nowhere near the pitch but went through with the lofted stroke over cover, only managed to skew it in the air to the Lions skipper."
imperious from Nair. Can't bowl short at 130 kph. He fetches the frontfoot pull from outside off and plays it in front of midwicket. Not an ideal follow-up to a wicket-taking delivery
"poor ball, but hey, it's a wicket-taking one. Length ball sliding into middle and leg, Nair whips it straight to Tambe at short fine leg. An embarrassed look on Dhawal's face, he knew it wasn't a wicket-taking delivery. Raina is the first to run up to him and ruffle his hair. Delhi Daredevils are in a crisis here"
"looks to punch it past cover, gets a thick inside-edge onto the pad"
"on middle and leg, turned to Tambe at short fine leg"
"holds its line after pitching around length on middle, pushed to leg side"
"full on middle, JP is half-forward and pats it to the off side"
"slow off-cutter on middle and leg, whipped towards deep square leg, excellent running. JP called two the moment he hit it"
"punched to mid-off, a misfield but no damage done"
"looks to crunch that through cover, but didn't have the width he would have liked, gets an inside edge that rolls to the on side"
dabbed behind the wicketkeeper for an easy single
gets forward and bunts it to cover
eases it behind point to get off the mark
"slower one on leg stump, tucked towards short fine leg"
gets forward and defends it back down the pitch
dabbed behind square on the off side for a quick single
"defeated by the short ball as he looks to hook, the ball whizzes past his glove, DK leaps like a goalkeeper to stop that"
flicks the slower one on the pads to deep square leg
"pulled, but not off the middle, lucky for JP that there was no square leg"
whipped from outside off towards long-on
"sweet timing, a touch of Ganguly in the stroke. Stays back inside the crease, and simply opens the face of the bat late to lace it behind point, good work in the deep"
punched wide of cover
"sliding into middle and leg, tucked behind square leg"
"too short, and he's pulled that well. The only problem? Straight to PK at deep square leg"
"he steps out to flick, but is beaten by the sharp turn, deflects off the pad to short third man"
"crunched that into the point boundary. Not much width but he went through with the stroke, and hit it with authority. No one moved in the deep. Picked the gap well"
steps out and lofts it towards sweeper cover
"land a cutter ahead of the length area on middle and off, pushed wide of cover"
dabbed wide of point
"scoring opportunity missed, this one was a high full toss on middle, he looks to pull but is late on it, toe-ends it to cover"
"slower one on middle and leg, pulled to deep fine leg"
"short ball off the shorter run, Pant picks the deep square leg fielder, who had to move no more than a centimeter"
punched to McCullum at deep cover
"looks to whip it past square leg, but can only get a thick inside edge onto the pad"
"welcome boundary. Picks the length early, and uses the depth of the crease to generate the power on the pull. One bounce into the deep midwicket fence"
driven with the spin to long-off
"slides back in, Pant shows all three stumps as he looked to cut but the ball kept coming back into him, somehow manages to jab it wide of point"
worked off his pad to deep midwicket
"doesn't get underneath the flight, flat hit to long-on"
touch of Yuvraj in that flick. Too full on the pads and he picked that away effortlessly into the deep backward square leg boundary
tucked towards the man running in from deep midwicket
whipped from outside off towards deep midwicket
"he's hit that like a rocket, but PK does exceptionally well at deep square leg. He wristed that powerfully from middle and off, but Praveen picked it off the bat immediately as he ran in a couple of paces, and then dived forward to complete the catch."
hops back and bunts it back to the bowler
gets back into the crease and punches it down to long-on
"starts off with a quicker one on middle, gets an inside edge towards short fine leg"
"drifting into middle and leg, flicked to deep midwicket"
gets down on one knee and sweeps it fiercely to deep midwicket
tucked with the angle behind square on the leg side
"they need more of this. Fired full and flat on middle and leg, JP picks him over midwicket with disdain. He was eyeing that boundary for a while, finally managed to connect one"
"too short, and punished. Walks across the stumps, and pulls it behind square on the leg side. No chance for the fielder in the deep"
"clean strike, and boy he's really hit that into the top tier. Length ball slanting across, Morris skips down the track and flat-bats tat over long-off. Dwayne Bravo at long-off saw the ball sail over"
"slower leg-cutter on off stump, bunted to point, Duminy had backed up a long way, a direct hit from Jadeja at point to the bowler's end and he would have been gone"
worked wide of midwicket for an easy single
"works it off his hip towards square leg, three fielders converged, but none showed the intensity to dive and hurl the ball back in. Excellent running"
pushed wide of short midwicket
"fetches the sweep from outside off, and boy, has that travelled. He's deposited that deep into the stands at square leg. Words exchanged between the two. Faulkner is upset, but the bottom line is, he hasn't got his lengths right"
"slow, dipping yorker on middle, JP was lining himself up to go over midwicket, made the quick adjustment to dead bat it back down the pitch"
"mid-off was up in the ring, and he did well to simply extend his arms and loft it over the man there. It was the slower ball alright, but in the hitting zone. Beautiful bat flow"
"slower one outside off, dabbed wide of point"
"makes a bit of room and squeezes it to Jadeja at cover, they don't chance the single"
"it was a mis-hit, but the short boundary comes to Morris' rescue. Short, but he was cramped for room, still went through with the pull and managed to get enough bat on it to clear the ropes at deep backward square leg"
"swings leg side again, toe ends it back to the bowler"
"whipped wide of fielder at wide long-on, excellent running"
"too full on the pads, flicked to Jadeja at deep midwicket"
"fires it full and into the blockhole on middle, Morris can only squeeze it back to Tambe, nearly carried too"
"clean strike, and he's belted that over long-on. The man there was in business for a couple of seconds, but that was the end of that. Tambe delivered from well behind the umpire, it was still a half-volley which he clobbered"
make that two in two. Tambe won't get turn if he bowls that flat. Morris gets underneath that delivery and swings it across the line over deep midwicket. He's on fire here
"crunched towards Jadeja at sweeper cover, his foot got stuck into the ground as he tried to stop the ball. Big over nonetheless"
"picked the bones out of that short one, but hit it straight to Bravo at point. Dot ball"
"deceived by the change of pace. This was the off-cutter which he landed at the in-between length, JP swung early and missed, goes on the bounce to Dinesh Karthik"
"pulls, but on the bounce to Jadeja at deep midwicket"
"muscled to long-on, flat hit again. Excellent bowling by Dhawal, not allowing the batsmen an opportunity to get underneath the ball"
"low full toss outside off, he makes room and squeezes it straight to sweeper cover"
"finishes off poorly, it was a top over till then, mind you. High full toss outside off, Morris slashes, and gets it behind point."
"gets a thick inside edge off the slog, excellent stop at short fine leg by Tambe. Has he done some damage to his left hand? Seems like he's dislocated his little finger. The physio is out immediately to attend to him"
"he'll soon have a statue near the Kotla entrance if he continues to bat like this. This one was a full toss, Morris stayed inside the crease and lined himself up to go over midwicket, the full toss only helped his bat swing as the ball sailed off the middle"
"a display of uninhibited six-hitting of the highest quality. Length ball outside off, and he has muscled that straight back over the bowler's head, into the second tier. <b> Fastest fifty this season as well </b>"
"he's hit that into Gurgaon, or should I say Gurugram? Too short, and at that pace, he will be picked away all day, all night. So far back into the stands. New balls please! This one was swung away with disdain, fetched it from outside off, and boy, did it sail into the stands at deep midwicket. People in the aisles, wear helmets please. This is dangerous from Mad Max Morris. Incredible!"
"low full toss on middle, drilled towards long-on"
flicked towards deep midwicket
"is that the gamechanger? More importantly from Daredevils' point of view, Morris is back on strike. Back to the delivery, this was a slow off cutter which he landed at length on middle, JP looked to swing over midwicket, but the bat face turned in his hand to skew the ball up in the air, Bravo running backwards called loud and clear, and judged it to perfection. Is there a twist?"
"slower ball, and smashed back past the bowler. Mid-off was inside the ring for this over, and he hits it there. Calculative batting this, mighty effective. Clean strikes too!"
"slower one gone wrong, spins down leg, DK does well to collect it on the bounce"
"too full on middle and leg, flicked into the gap at wide long-on"
"excellent yorker, Morris jams his bat down in time to keep that out"
"punched, and punched well. There was cover, and a very wide mid-off, and Morris managed to find the gap. Who said his game is all about muscle? This one was pure timing. Even Raina's back flick couldn't prevent the boundary"
"yorker outside off, can't get any bat on it"
"drilled to Raina at extra cover, top save"
"full and angling in, hit flat towards long-off"
"excellent yorker on middle from round the stumps, Morris looks to go over long-on, toe-ends it back to the bowler, applause from Raina"
"lofted into the wide long-on region, top work in the deep to keep it down to a single"
"backs away to go over cover, PK follows him and bowls a yorker right into his toes, squeezed back down the pitch for a single. Negi made a mistake by giving a hit to the bowler too soon"
"struck hard, but straight to long-on. Raina couldn't have asked for a better penultimate over."
backs away and carves it to Faulkner who makes a mess of it at point. The ball bursts through his hands and races away into the point boundary. He was off balance as he put his hands out to catch that
swung across the line to deep backward square leg
"into the blockhole on leg stump, squeezed towards the man running in from deep midwicket"
"low full toss on middle and leg, swung down to long-on, pandemonium! This wasn't meant to be more than a single, but Jadeja fired a casual throw to the keeper's end when he should have hurled it to Bravo at the non-striker's end. Both batsmen were alert to the possibility and squeezed through"
"can't get underneath the yorker, hit towards long-on. Jadeja this time attacks Morris's end, but he had given up.  They had to go back for the second, the throw was full and just landed in front of Karthik, who failed to collect it cleanly. Morris had given up. Two run-out chances missed"
"this is full and straight into the blockhole on middle, Morris swings but can only get it as far as Jadeja, who hares in from long-on. They scoot back for the second, but it won't be enough. Phew, what a pulsating finish. Spare a thought for Chris Morris"
