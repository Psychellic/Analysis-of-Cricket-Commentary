Saw this tossed up, there was an invitation to drive which Shaun Marsh couldn't resist. Went at it with hard hands but was playing away from the body. Wasn't leaning into the stroke, the bat was also down at an angle and the edge pouched superbly by Shafiq over his head. There was plenty of turn from the rough, something to encourage the spinners."

"<strong>LBW appeal! Given out!</strong> Will he <strong>review</strong>? He does. Finch calls for a <strong>review</strong>. This was a great length, shaping back hits him pad first, impact is in line and Hawkeye has it hitting the stumps! It just came back enough as he was half forward, not expecting it to shape back. Finch goes for 49. Great bowling from Abbas. Gets him twice in the Test."

"<strong>Huge LBW shout! </strong> Given not out. But Sarfraz has<strong> reviewed</strong>. This was very full and swing back in. It's pad first! Out! It was almost a half-volley and he fell over with his head, jammed bat and pad together. The umpire obviously felt it was bat first. The slow motion replay showed pad first. Hawkeye ball tracking showed it hit him inline and was crashing into leg stump! Great review from Sarfraz!"
