"that familiar kiss of the ball and round-arm delivery, very full length and a hint of swing, met with a full face on the front foot"
fractionally back of a length but arrow-straight. Fenced back down the pitch
"outside off, back of a length, tapped into the covers"
"slower ball and tapped very comfortably out through wide mid-on, just waited for the ball to arrive and timed it to perfection with a clip round the front pad"
"back of a length, nurdled to mid-on"
another attempted flick out through the leg side. Can't quite find enough flamingo in his flamboyance to find the gap at midwicket. A decent first over
"tight line, angling into the stumps and left alone on length"
"tight line, and well bowled, rising awkwardly from back of a length, and Bairstow has to close the face late to press into the covers"
"crashed into the covers, well timed but straight to the fielder"
"a touch of width, stabbed with an open face out through third man to get off the mark"
"back of a length, fenced into the covers"
"right on the top of the bounce, drilled into the covers"
"dead hands, dropped into the off side. A quick scamper through for the single"
"sliding down the leg side, but flicks the hip on its way through"
"on the back foot, another uppish punch into the leg side. intercepted with a slide"
"sliding past the hip this time, with no connection. And we'll have that one again"
"slower-ball yorker, Roy sees it early, and prods it to the off side"
"too short, and <B>slammed through midwicket!</b> Roy loves that length. Free runs"
"Another dipping slower ball, and Roy does very well to adjust late and nurdle through fine leg for <B>back-to-back boundaries</b>"
"absolutely battered into the covers, but straight at the man. Looked good for the cameras..."
"this time he finds the gap, opens the face to create more of an angle, and fillets the gap between point and extra cover. Supreme timing and placement"
"tighter line, solid defence on the crease-line"
crunched into the covers once again
"<B>biff!</b> Bairstow is so strong on the drive. No swing on offer, and Bairstow pounds through the covers once more. If he beats the field, it's always four all the way"
"clipped on the up to mid-on, another sweet bit of timing. Bairstow is ticking"
"back of a length, arrow-straight, Roy once again works his stroke to midwicket"
"a filched single through third man, guided almost off the top of the off bail as Roy drops his bat late on the stroke"
defended into the covers
"short and wide, and <B>panned out through point!</b> This is too easy for England at the moment. Surely time for some mystery spin"
fenced into the covers
"full length on leg stump, can't create the angle this time"
"hello, hello ... Roy has had enough of playing the ball on its merits, and he's taken his first stride down the pitch, launching a lofted chip over long-on. <strong>Top tonking!</strong>"
an urgent chisel off the toes and another single to midwicket
"wider on the crease, thumped back past the umpire, and a well-judged single after some navigation of the bowler in his followthrough"
"wide line, clipped through square leg with a trapdoor-like closing of the bat"
cracked on the up into the leg side
clipped in front of square to mid on
"a whirl of arms and some encouraging bite from off to leg, tapped off the back foot to mid-on"
"driven on a full length, Bairstow keen to put bat on ball"
"tossed up, and leg-sided, it's a leggie but comes out as a low full toss. Can't get it away"
back of a length and chopped to point
"<b>pumped up and over wide long-on!</b> He seemed to be sizing up the sweep at first, but the ball just kept coming, right into his slot, and was duly slotted for the first six of the tour!"
"outside off, carved through point, this is a fine start from England"
"drilled uppishly to mid-on, good sliding stop to intervene"
"looping full length, a slower ball, and pushed to mid-off"
"<b>banged in short, and they are asking the question!</B> But nope, no glove involved"
sharp pounce in the covers to intercept
whipped off the toes to the leg side
"<B>a loose drive outside off, and Bairstow walks!</b> No question about the edge, but did it carry? The umpire's finger went up initially, but then he hesitated for confirmation from square leg... <strong>Nope... not even a sliver of a doubt!</strong> The end of a gallumphing innings from Bairstow, and he's rightly livid ..."
nurdled to the leg side again
flicked out to midwicket to get off the mark straight away
"low full toss, pumped to cover"
"<B>oh my word, that's a giveaway from Roy!</b> Picked the offspinner alright, but didn't get close to the pitch of the ball in a flaccid swat through the line, and mid-off backpedals to swallow a simple catch. Two wickets in the blink of an eye, and England's serene start has been derailed"
<B>slides past the left-hander's edge</b>. Tight line from round the wicket
stabbed into the covers. England look to regroup
"onto the front foot, punched into the covers"
"<B>edged but safe!</b> A hard-handed drive, wide outside off, and had there been a second slip, that would have been a third wicket!"
"banged in short, Root is a touch startled as he rides the bounce"
leaning onto the front foot to defend once more
tapped out to point
"<B>huge appeal!</b> Burst off the seam, sawed Root in half, and there was a distinct noise as ball passed bat ... but a good decision as that flicks the top of the back leg... it's all happening now!"
stretching onto the front foot to defend again
cracked on the up to long-off
"fails to pick the wrong'un, but deflects safely down the leg side"
"stretching forward, whipped to midwicket"
flipped round the corner
"back of a length, and cracked into the off side"
"back of a length, wicket to wicket, defended back down the pitch"
"too leg-sided, and effortlessly flicked through backward square. Too fine to intercept that one"
fully forward and angled down to third man
"full and wide, steered out to cover with a full-faced glide"
"bouncer, and calmly deflected behind square with a half-cocked pull"
"flicked very fine, by the left-hander this time. Malinga fails to find his line to either left- or right-hander, and pays the price"
"back of a length, on the back foot, meeting the offbreak with a <strong>clean punch on the up and through the covers</strong>. Quality strike"
lured forward on a full length
tucked to the leg side
"squared up on a full length, but squirted into the gap at backward point"
"forward again, pushed to the leg side"
"<B>spanked violently over square leg!</B> Down on one knee for the sweep, met it with power and timing, and though Malinga was back on the rope, there was no getting close to that! Nailed it"
"back of a length, outside off, defended to gully"
"sweetly timed out through the leg side, and that's a fine piece of fielding at backward square leg to intercept a fast travelling ball"
worked to the off side
"banged in short, and too high for Root to reach"
"punched off a fuller length, out to cover"
"on the pads, worked to the leg side"
"too short, leg-sided, a round-house club through backward square. It's not Malinga's day so far..."
"fully forward, and blocked back down the track"
"worked into the covers, rising on the back foot"
thumped out to short midwicket
"leg break, and blocked"
"off the back foot, punched square"
clipped off the pads to square leg
