"nice bounce and carry. Shortish delivery outside off, too wide to draw a stroke. Just a hint of away movement. Left alone"
"nice length on the first morning. Full delivery outside off, 141 kph. Samarawickrama lets it go easily"
"fine shot. Samarawickrama loves to play through the line. It's full from Ishant, nothing wrong with the line or length. But no swing or seam and he leans into a lovely drive through mid-off"
"full down leg, Samarawickrama plants his front foot too far across, can't get to the ball because his front pad is on the way, but sliding down"
"good length delivery around off, worked into the gap at mid-on with soft hands. Gets there easily. Good single."
"good end from Ishant. Full around off, juuuust a hint of wobble in the air. Defended back confidently, comfortably."
"drifts on the pads to begin with, decent pace, no movement, flicked down to fine leg for one"
"fantastic improvisation from Karunaratne, but that's a jaffa of a delivery. Full and swinging back in very late. Attacking the middle stump with some late swing, yorker. Flicked through midwicket, got bat down on it just in time."
"now he angles it away, well outside off, 140 kph, left alone"
"it's a lovely morning length. Full around off, the ball swinging back in, Karunaratne moves, not lunges forward, and drives back. He is now wary of that late inswinger"
"superb bowling. On a length outside off, fourth-stump line. Karunaratne plays the best shot possible to that delivery, leaves it alone"
"superb over from Umesh. On a length again, around off, forcing Karunaratne to play, defended to mid-on."
"shortish length outside off, a little bit of movement back in, left alone"
"good delivery again. Full and straight, attacking the stumps, 141 kph, shovelled through square leg for a couple. Looked to play it straight but got there so late that the ball hit the inside half. A bit loose"
"a tad overpitched there, outside off, a badly-timed drive to mid-off. Bringing his bat down late"
"bowling it full, seeing if there is some swing, none available. Driven to mid-on. Again the timing not quite there."
"he's not in control at all. Full delivery outside off, it's an unnecessary flirt, the ball glides to the left of backward point for a run. Just tighten up that defense, leave well"
"terrific end. Full delivery, angled away. Karunaratne does well not to go chasing after it, is quite convincingly beaten on the outside edge, but very important not to care about that"
"better, good leave. Fullish and wide outside off, 138 kph, left alone. Keep doing that"
"it's another loose stroke. Bat well away from pad. Full and wide outside off, some slingy swing. Samarawickrama drives at it, finds the gap through extra cover for three. Not great timing which is why it was pulled back"
"full around off, 136 kph, driven back to the bowler."
"good stride forward, bat close to the pad, and playing it closer to his body, his head over the ball. Defended to point. Good defensive technique"
"shortish delivery outside off, 139 kph, good change in length. Karunaratne drops his wrists and sways out of the line"
"good bowling. Pitches it full, inviting the drive, and Karunaratne does, but the ball angles away and beats the bat. Umesh has been excellent this morning"
"shortish delivery on middle, 136 kph, a pull down to fine leg for one."
"full again, outside off, driven towards mid-off."
drifts on the pads and Karunaratne's timing is good. Flicked neatly through midwicket. Both batsmen collide gently into each other halfway through the second run. No clear communication between the batsmen
"good from Karunaratne. Good length around off and middle, worked towards mid-on with soft hands. Another quality single. That's a big part of batting, more so when it's the first morning"
"terrific catch from Pujara. 139 kph, full delivery outside off. Samarawickrama drives, like he has been doing all morning, with bat weeelll away from pad. The ball takes the outside edge and carries low to Pujara at first slip, who dives in front of him and takes it comfortably. That's a tough catch made incredibly easy. That's not a Test opener's innings. He had been driving all morning in that fashion, and it was only a matter of time."
"digs it in, a bouncer down leg. Thirimanne hurries underneath. It's the set-up for next over"
"full and very wide outside off, 140 kph. No way Karunaratne was playing at that"
"bowled full again outside off, left alone. Slightly closer to off stump. Have to be closer to the fourth stump"
"brings it in, good length outside off, shaping in, worked into the leg side"
"fullish around off, pushed to mid-on with the full face"
"good single. Back of a length around off, nudged towards square leg for one. I really like that shot, tip and run"
"brings it in, full around off, defended into the off side. Thirimanne with a more compact technique"
"full delivery around off, gets forward does Karunaratne to defend under his eyes"
"good length around off, nudged into the leg side, towards mid-on"
"falls over his pad but improvises. Full and straight from Ishant, Karunaratne pushes back"
"full and wide outside off, 139 kph, left alone this time. A bit of wobble in the air"

"overpitched delivery outside off, driven to mid-off from the crease"
"good leave. Full delivery outside off, some angle away. Karunaratne lifts his hands high to let that one go"
"shot of the morning. 136 kph, overpitched from Ishant, full outside off. Karunaratne shuffles a tad across and drills a drive right back. Full face of the bat, the bat is not hanging too far in front of him. It meets the ball in a lovely languid push"
"good length outside off, Karunaratne defends into the off side"
"well bowled, 130 kph, back of a length delivery outside off, the ball keeps climbing. But Karunaratne's defensive technique lets him avoid it, drops his hands and watches it go by"
"a good finish. Back of a length around middle and leg, Karunaratne gets on top of the bounce and fends into the leg side. Had to take his hand off the handle because of <strong>some extra bounce</strong>"
"goes right through Thirimanne. Good length on off, 141 kph, seams back in and cuts Thirimanne in half as he tries to defend. Terrific delivery"
"drifts down leg this time, clips the thigh pad on the way to the keeper. Saha dives to his right to stop a couple. Two leg byes as the ball goes through"
"fine shot. Overpitched outside off, too full, Thirimanne strides forward and caresses a drive to cover's left. Rahul got a hand on it to prevent a couple."
"digs this in short, down leg. Thirimanne ducks"
"another bouncer, well-directed. Forcing Thirimanne to hustle underneath. The full one to end?"
"good length around off to finish, defended under his eyes"
"full delivery outside off, left alone by Karunaratne"
"nicely bowled. Full length outside off, Karunaratne strides forward to defend to mid-off"

"floats this at length outside off, left alone"

"drifting into the stumps, defended"
"steps out but is somewhat beaten in flight as the ball drifts in, defended back down the pitch"
"sharp turn, hint of grip on this. The length is shorter though, so there's enough time for Dimuth as he defends off the backfoot"
"nice flight and drift into middle, hint of spin this time as he gets forward and defends"
mistimes an attempted drive to short cover. Saw the flight and looked to go after that one

"gets a thick inside edge towards mid-on as he drives and instinctively takes off for a single. There's a direct hit at the bowler's end from Pujara, who picks up the ball and fires it in one motion but Karunaratne was <b> saved by a couple of inches </b>"
"too full on off stump, defended"
"once again a slider, lovely from Ashwin, there was a gap between pad and bat that opened up as he defended"
"touch full and just outside off, defended confidently"
confident forward push as he drives to extra cover. Length on the fuller side from Ishant
"this one nips back in off the seam to come back in and hit him on the thigh pad. Once again, Karunaratne not entirely sure of the line. Didn't perhaps expect this to come back in a long way"
"this is in that uncomfortable zone where a batsman isn't sure whether to play or leave. Driving length outside off, the ball wobbles away just a wee bit. Left alone in the end"
shows the full face of the bat in defence of this full-length delivery back towards the bowler
"floats this full but the ball just takes off and zips through to Saha, who takes this in front of his face."

"slider on middle and leg, tucked wide of square leg"
"drifts in a full ball on off stump, defended"
"<b> dropped! </b> Right through Pujara's hands at mid-on. Strange shot from Dimuth, suddenly decided to step out and go over the top but is completely beaten in flight, got a thick inside-edge on this lofted hit. Bullet hit, really and Pujara managed to only parry this towards the long-on boundary. He's done most things right today, not quite this time. <b> First a run-out chance and now a dropped catch. India are creating opportunities. </b>"
"pushed through quicker, he lunges forward and blocks"
"dabs this gently to the leg side as they scamper a single, a direct hit form Saha, who ran towards short midwicket, to the bowler's end would've made things interesting"

"this one nips back in gently from outside off, once again a touch low as he offers the full face of the bat in defence"
"full and just outside off, the angle was in from wide of the crease but this moves away alarmingly after it passed the batsman. Saha struggles to grab that properly"

"slider from around the stumps, defended from the crease"

"drifts into middle and spins away ever-so-slightly, defended back down the pitch"
punched straight to M Vijay at backward point
eased with the spin back to Ashwin
"the pressure that Ashwin's so beautifully created has brought out a poor slog sweep. <b> That's the first wicket for an India spinner in this series. </b> Ashwin isn't generally this animated, but if ever someone deserved a wicket today, it's Ashwin. This was drifting in from around off, pitched and straightened to deflect off the back thigh onto the stumps, Thiri had to fetch this from a long way outside off. You could sense this was coming"
"fired into middle and leg, worked towards square leg for an easy single"
"shorter in length, defended with the spin"
punches this wide of cover for a quick single
"sharp turn back in to hit him on the pad. Dimuth played outside the line. <strong>Bounce as well, oooh, delicious</strong>"
steps out and turns this with the spin to the leg side
"<b> has he overstepped? Oh, dear. Yes. he has </b>, so all that with the delivery has come to zilch. The straighter one nearly did the trick. Karunaratne steps out but is completely deceived by the one that skids on to beat the outside edge. Saha didn't grab it cleanly in the first attempt but recovered nicely to whip the bails off in a jiffy with Karunatne well outside the crease. They wanted to check if the stumping was clean, but found out in the process that Jadeja had overstepped. Big opportunity missed."
"touch short on middle, defended gently back down the pitch"
works this full delivery to mid-on
"nice flight, lands this just outside off, he gets outside the line of the stumps and defends"
"fired full on middle and leg, turned to the leg side"

"too full and just outside off, Mathews gets outside the line of the stumps and blocks"

"drift to start. Flat delivery outside off, well outside off. Karunaratne gets across and pokes, beaten"
"<strong>the outside edge this time</strong>, but falls well short. Flat outside off, more drift. Poked with soft hands though"
"tries the reverse sweep. Flat and wide outside off, Karunaratne tries to reverse paddle, struck on the pad outside off."
"quick and straight, some undercut on the ball, defended into the leg side"
"87 kph, a poor effort at the boundary by Vijay. Overpitched outside off, Karunaratne drives through cover, wide of mid-off. Vijay hunts it down, but brings the ball into the boundary with him as he slides"
"short outside off, pushed towards mid-on"
"quick outside off, more drift, defended into the leg side"
"tossed up generously outside off, blocked back to the bowler"
"lots of flight outside off, on a length and wide, under-edged past slip for four. Flew past Rahane on the bounce. Not much he could have done"
"runs down, gets to the bounce and pummels a lofted drive over mid-on. Gets close enough to the pitch to execute, terrific shot"
"more flight, lots of loop outside off, defended"
drifts on the pads for an easy run through midwicket. Much better intent from Sri Lanka after the break
"pushed through quick in the air, full around off. Defended into the leg side, off the inside half"
"extremely quick and full, smothered"
"a tad shorter than previously, Mathews stays back and punches back to the bowler. Wanted to go more square"
"better length and line, full but not overpitched. Defended"
"too full this time outside off, easily kept out"
"out, given by umpire Joel Wilson. But for what? Review for lbw. It was caught by Rahane at slip, but there was no bat, the bat came down and struck the front pad, which caused it to deflect away, preventing the bat from meeting the ball, which meant there was a free path for the ball to first hit the front pad, then the back pad. Two reds on review, and umpire's call on impact with stumps, just clipping the leg stump. Feel the umpire hedged his bets slightly there, it was out one way or another. In the end, umpire's call does for Mathews. It was the slider from Jadeja, full around middle, and kept sliding on."
"full around middle and leg, pushed away to mid-on"
"slowish outside off, defended quietly into the off side"
"shortish around middle, flicked to midwicket for a run. Short enough and slow enough for Karunaratne to go back and use the crease"
"quick again, drifting on outside off, driven to mid-off for a quality single"
"oooh, beautiful. The flatter trajectory all over, this one is tossed up around off, drawing Karunaratne forward, but the ball is not full, <strong>it has enough room to pitch</strong> and turn and rip past the outside edge. Saha collects high, and whips off the bails. But Karunaratne is fine."
"how's that? That's close. Very close. <strong>Kohli reviews</strong>. Not a flat or loopy trajectory, it has plenty of room to slide on this time, unlike the previous delivery, and Karunaratne is beaten on the inside edge. 'Definitely no bat,' says the third umpire. Clipping the side of leg stump again, so India don't lose their review either. Neither of these are bad decisions, so neither side should be disappointed"
"full around off, defended towards mid-off"
"92 kh, Chandimal misses a flick, a simple flick. Quick down leg, Chandimal doesn't make contact, the ball goes on and hits the pad down leg. <strong>Big appeal</strong>, sliding down"
"skids on again, shortish down leg, hits the pad"
"quick outside off, Chandimal defends awkwardly. Weather this period out"
"tries to charge, but Jadeja drags the length back just enough, pushed towards mid-on"
"straight to short leg, but no one there. Flat outside off, keeps sliding on, takes the inside edge towards square leg. Terrific length in that over, a spinner's good length"
"plenty of air on that, flight around middle, driven to mid-on"
"comes down, doesn't quite get there but goes through with the shot. Flat around off, Chandimal chips down and skews a six down the ground. Got enough power behind that. Not in control at all"
"pushed through on leg, clipped to midwicket."
"85 kph, another exuberant stroke, runs down at Ashwin and shovels a flick to deep square leg"

"bangs a length ball across the left-hander, this one zips through to hit high on Dickwella's bat as he defends"
"hint of width and he's forced that through the line, races into the gap at backward point. Sweetly timed. Maybe a few others would've let that go, not Dickwella"

Rahane throws himself to his left to stop this steer at gully
"flayed away but can't pierce the gap, straight to Vijay at backward point"
"it's that nibbling length outside off, Dickwella leaves"
"<b> shouts of catch </b> but it lands short of leg slip. Nice flight, imparting revs and getting bounce off the deck as he looks to work this with the spin, rolls towards short fine leg."
paddled from way outside off towards fine leg where Ishant runs around 30-35 yards and then brings out a full stretch dive to pull it back in. <strong>Terrific work </strong>

"through Kohli at short midwicket as he bends to pick up this flick, down to wide long-on"
"hint of turn, bounce off he deck from off stump, Dickwella bunts this wide of slip"

gets on top of the bounce and turns this to the leg side
"reverses in a length ball from outside off, he shows the full face of the bat in defence"
"driven firmly to cover, a <strong>direct hit at the bowler's end from Jadeja and he would've been out.</strong> Vijay with a diving stop in trying to cover the throw."
works this off his hip to Jadeja again at midwicket. This was uppish but safe
stops on him as he check-punches this to the cover fielder on the bounce
steps out and flicks to the sliding Jadeja at midwicket. Super work. Anticipated the stroke and moved swiftly to his left
"touch short, goes back and works this to square leg, Jadeja the man again"

Jadeja swoops in like a hawk to stop that delicate little tap towards short square leg
"slides a full delivery across, Chandimal steps out and drives this back to the bowler"
"nice flight but lands this on leg stump, the ball spins back in to hit the pad."
"flayed away on the up, races to the point boundary. Tracer bullet stuff. Opened his wrists up nicely to play this into the point region. Hint of width and he took full toll of that"
solidly behind the line of that incoming length ball in defence
covers the line of the stumps and defends this incoming length ball to the off side
"late reverse? This starts from outside off, comes in just a bit, driven firmly to mid-off"
right behind the line of this incoming length ball as he defends. This one kept just a little low
whips this coming short of length delivery down to deep fine leg
"sharp turn in but this is on the shorter side, he shapes to cut but changes his stroke and simply ends up bunting it to the off side"
"picked away, easy. Rocks back to open up the off side and wallops this short delivery into the gap between cover and point. Pujara thought about the dive but decided it wasn't worth the effort or the risk this time."
"pads it away, did well to get well outside the line of the stumps"
gets a good stride forward and eases this to mid-off
"steps out to flick but gets a little too close to the ball, squeezed to mid-off again"
"bottom-edges this cut, not there for the stroke because this was on the fuller side. Through Rahane at slip. Hit his boot and trickled towards the third man boundary"
gets forward and defends this towards cover
"crunching off drive from Chandimal. I'd go as far as saying this is the <b> shot of the day so far. </b> Late reverse but he had committed himself fully forward as he brought the bat down in a nice, little arc to drive this past mid-off."
transfers his weight back and punches this length ball to the off side
"more runs. Umesh is looking to bowl full and search for the late reverse, and is getting punished in the process. There is width and he's belted this to the cover boundary."
"returns with a short delivery at 138kph, but is way outside off. He sways out of the way"
cuts away but can't pick the gap. Straight to point. <b> That's tea on Day 1 </b>

"this has so much more loop and flight on off, pushed wide of cover for a quick, well-judged run"
"quick on the pads, flicked through to deep midwicket for a run"
"quick and wide outside off, punched through cover point. Jadeja runs to his right from cover but falls over the ball. That's rare"

"flat around off, Chandimal gets forward to defend, pops up off the splice"
"tossed up generously outside off, drilled to cover"
"<b>fifty for Chandimal</b>, another sterling effort from the captain. Dogged. Short and wide, slashed towards cover for a run"
"ooh the false stroke, and Jadeja strikes. Jadeja has been getting plenty of drift from slightly wide of the crease. Dickwella's shot selection isn't bad, but when he saw Jadeja go wide of the crease, his shot surely should have been improvised. He tried to lift it over midwicket with the spin, a good option, but because he didn't quite get to the pitch and because that ball slid on with the arm, it took the outside half of the bat and lobbed up. Ishant at mid-off, takes a simple catch by his chest. Just subtle variations, Dickwella plays the wrong shot."
"dances down again, defended into the leg side. Ashwin saw Chandimal coming and shortened the length"
"quick on the pads, on leg, Chandimal misses a flick, struck on the pad, sliding down. An optimistic appeal is quickly struck down"
"darted in outside off, shovelled into the leg side"
"misread the length. Saw flight, went back, good length, defended back"
"87 kph, quick outside off, flicked to deep midwicket for one"
"the big sweep of the first ball. Flight down leg, hammered to the deep square leg fielder"

runs down to the pitch of the ball and drills a drive back to Jadeja who fields comfortably
"another one that slides on, flat on middle and leg, defended. None are spinning"
"58 mph, quick, darted in around off, defended"
"hammered to mid-on. Some flight down leg, Shanaka comes running, meets the ball as it pitches and clatters a drive to mid-on."
"flight around off, driven to long-on with the spin. Too easy. Kohli goes back to in-out fields"
"that's a terrific delivery. Neither spinner has been getting too much spin, they have been getting drift though. Under-cut again, around middle. Shanaka is playing an offspinner so he tries to play for some turn, but the length is impeccable, allows the ball enough room to pitch and slide on to beat the outside edge, hits off stump. Gem of a delivery. The offbreak that took the inside edge in the previous over was the doubt-planter, setting him up for this. Excellent Test bowling."
"slow around leg, topspin, off the pad into the leg side"

"85 kph, flight outside off, driven hard to mid-off"
"probing again. Quick and full around off and middle, full enough to smother"
"quick outside off, another slider, defended into the off side."
"short down leg, played into the leg side. The field moves back to just slip, two short legs and leg gully"
"quick around off, defended from the back foot"
"79 kph, flight down leg, <strong>was it dropped?</strong> I don't count that as a drop. They stick or burst out. On the pads, flicked low to Pujara at short leg, the ball hits his hands and pops out"
"flight outside off, pushed towards cover"
"flatter trajectory on middle and leg, smothered back"
"flight outside off, driven back to the bowler"
"given! Pad first says umpire Kettleborough and the Indian players. Dilruwan maybe thinks otherwise, <strong>reviews right away</strong>. From first replays, looks like Dilruwan is right. The ball drifts on from well outside off, comes back in, takes the inside edge into the pad. That may have been a tad outside the line too. Reckon Kettleborough got that wrong. What I'll say is India were saved a review there"
"on the pads, worked to midwicket"
"charges down, doesn't get right to the pitch but does get close enough. Flat outside off, gets there and pummels a drive right back. Sensational timing"

"good end, full around off, defended back"
"flight down leg, pushed back to the bowler"
"chips down the pitch, gets close enough to flick without worrying about spin or drift, clipped to long-on."
"overpitched on off, pushed to long-on"
flicks past midwicket for a run. Using his feet very nicely
"tries to bring slip into play but it's a tad too wide, full outside off. Dilruwan gets forward and outside-halves through to third man for a couple. Good idea from Ashwin"
"flight outside off, driven to mid-off."
"the outside edge again. This one turns. Seems a lottery, some spin, some won't. Depending on the surface's natural variation. Flat around off, a thick edge towards third man"
"this one doesn't turn, takes the inside half towards midwicket. <strong>I don't think Jadeja knows</strong> which ones will turn"
"flatter this time outside off, punched to long-off."
"92 kph, gone! Ump Kettleborough gives Dilruwan again, and the review again. Quick on middle and leg, skids on and on and on and past the inside edge. Dilruwan is too late to play, misses the straight one and is struck plumb in front. Three reds on review and SL lose their seventh and a review. Batting against this natural variation is much harder than on a pitch that is ripping and turning. As a batsman, you only have a 50% chance - the one that will spin or won't."
"54 mph, quick around off, blocked"
"definitely off the glove. No one at short leg. Kohli regrets his field choice. Flat down leg, off the pad, then the glove then to square leg. I was badly mistaken, hit his arm pad not glove"
"short around middle and leg, worked to midwicket"
""
"87 kph, <strong>Kohli reviews</strong>. That looks close. Chandimal opts for the reverse sweep, or rather the switch hit. He is struck right in front of off and middle, but is it sliding on. I thought I saw a hint of turn, and that could make all the difference on HawkEye. No bat, three reds on HawkEye and Chandimal's resistance ends. Sri Lanka are withering away. Just wonder if he could have batted normally with Herath, and maybe looked for these strokes with the next man. All easy in hindsight. Good innings from Chandimal. Turned back just enough not to be missing his off stump"
"on the pads, flicked through square leg for one."
"nicely flighted around middle, smothered"

slides in to hit him on the flap of the pad as he defends. Line may have been outside off
"slapped away, didn't get hold of it as well as he would've liked but manages to hit this wide of mid-on. This was bowled at length, so wasn't in Lakmal's swinging arc."

sharp turn but from way outside off. Not enough to trouble Rangaiyya
works this incoming length delivery back down the pitch
"full and angling into middle and leg, worked towards short mid-on"
slapped back but Ishant shows excellent reflexes in bending down quickly and putting his left hand out to stop that
"he fetches the pull from way outside off. Flat-batted that with disdain, one bounce into the boundary"
"nonchalant flick, an uppish one at that, on the bounce to Jadeja at midwicket"
"beauty. This one angled in at length and deviated just a wee bit to kiss the edge as Lakmal's squared up. Regulation catch to Saha. Ishant is pleased and his reaction tells you how he absolutely enjoyed this. No scowl, growls or anything. But a look of satisfaction that said 'I knew I'd get him with that.' They call these a jaffa. Simply terrific from Ishant."
"edged and taken at first slip. Lovely flight from Ashwin, drew Herath forward as a tentative poke flies low to Rahane, who anticipates the stroke and moves low to his right to complete the catch. <B> That's wicket number 296 for Ashwin, his fourth of the innings. </b> Sri Lanka bowled out for 205."

carefully leans forward and opens the bat face late to steer this back of length delivery to point

"for the first time, he gets this ball to come back in. The length is on the fuller side as well, Rahul has to adjust late to defend this back down the pitch. Hit the top part of the bat."
<strong>beauty!</strong> Searching for the delivery outside off. Looks like Rahul expected this to shape away but this angled in and straightened.
"too short and sliding into middle and leg, punched to midwicket"
"driven but straight to backward point. This was floated full, not much deviation off the pitch"
"<strong>played on!</strong> Very loose from Rahul, plays away from the body to a 128kph length delivery that nipped away ever-so-slightly. Thick inside edge onto the stumps."

"length in the corridor, opens the face and defends to point"
"<b>well bowled!</b> Stunning ball in the corridor from Lakmal. Belts it into the pitch, back of a length and zips away while climbing. Pujara is on his toes again, expecting that to come into him, but it climbs away and he follows with his hands. Can't get bat on it. It's how he was dismissed in the second innings of the first Test"

"a very difficult chance is <b>dropped</b> at short leg and then the run out attempt is missed too as he flicks with a back hand. Vijay stepped out and didn't get to the pitch of this. He was a few yards down the pitch and was almost certain to be run-out if there was a direct hit. The keeper had moved towards short leg instinctively, perhaps in the hunt to take a rebound.

short one comes in at the mid-riff. Takes the bottom hand off as he looks to glance. Gloves to the keeper's left

"another length ball veering down leg, Kohli looks to tickle it fine but misses. The keeper cleverly flicks the ball onto the stumps, but Kohli outfoxes him, aware of the possibility of an otherthrow and scampers a single in. <b> Wonder if there's a ploy to try and get Kohli stumped down leg </b>"

Thirimanne is already on a middle stump guard and shuffling into the off side, but he still has to reach out. It's that wide. The best he could hope for was to somehow get bat on it. There was no way he could have controlled the shot. Ends up slicing it straight - and very feebly - to backward point. He was so solid till this error"

This one, from around the wicket, angles in and climbs at chest height. Not much Dickwella can do. Looks to defend, but it flies off the outside edge.

"puts everything into it, but it's only gone high, about the distance of an Everest or two, and under it is KL Rahul, who has run back from mid-on. Hitting out against a clever bowler needs a little bit more than 'okay, I'm going to charge at everything'. Ashwin lets this delivery hang in the air, a little wider of off stump. It's like the ball has secret buttons that only he can access. He flicks the one that says 'dip' and it does, meaning Shanaka coming down the track still can't get to the pitch of it. Worse, he has to drag it. Goes full throttle. Then just goes."
"loops it up again, a shade outside off, Chandimal defends well"
"steps out for a better controlled hit, wide of long-on. Keeps his shape well, even if he is not to the pitch of the good length ball."
"pushes it through a touch quicker outside off, Chandmal waits on the front foot and brings his wrists into play. Single to deep midwicket"
"quicker, flatter, a shade outside off. Chandimal opens the face towards point"
he's kept back in the crease by the good length ball on off stump. Blocks
<b>turn and bounce</b> and Chandimal wisely leaves it outside off
attacks the stumps with a fullish delivery that bites into the pitch and straightens. Chandimal is squared up as he meets it
"this appears to be the slider, pushed through on middle and leg. Chandimal keeps his front leg out of the way of a straight bat"
clips a fullish ball to midwicket
"<b>that's wicket number 298</b> and it's only confirmed by Sri Lanka's <b>review</b>. The chaos happens off a straight ball, which Ashwin has been bowling so often in this spell that it may well be intentional. Dilruwan, facing his first ball, is clearly flummoxed. He is playing for turn, the bat is inside the line and he's struck low on his front pad. 'Clearly no bat,' says the third umpire. Ball-tracking gives an umpire's call. <b>That's a third straight year that Ashwin has picked up 50 wickets</b>"
goes around the wicket for a tossed up ball.
"he keeps ticking it over, number 299! <b>Unplayable</b>. Gives it a proper rip. Makes it pitch on middle, from round the wicket, so Herath has to play. Comes forward, with lowish hands to defend, but the ball kicks up off the pitch, takes the top glove - that tells you how much bounce it gets - and lobs to Rahane at slip"
turns the ball in front of square leg
"lap sweeps a flighted delivery from outside off to long leg. Good shot. Gets low, to the pitch, and plays the shot when there is no chance of lbw"
<B>goes the other way</b> and Chandimal adjusts to the carrom ball only off the pitch. A little fuller in length and that may have taken a finer edge through to the wicketkeeper. This is a ^*&% masterclass.
drives a fuller delivery outside off to mid-off
goes straight on with the arm and Lakmal only just manages to get bat down to it. Could easily have been lbw
"smacks a length ball, one-day style, to the long-off boundary. The fielder catching was a little wider considering the spin Jadeja has sometimes got"
"quicker, straighter, hunting for lbw. But Lakmal's inside edge spoils the party"
"shortish and outside off, cracks it through the covers"
"<b>inside edge</b> as Lakmal tries to force a good length ball on middle through mid-off. Instead, he finds his single at midwicket"
"<b>carrom ball to the tailender</b>, and its nicely tossed up too, on middle to make him hit over leg. Draws the leading edge but it squirts away through cover"
good length ball just outside off stump fetches the outside edge that runs away to third man
"defends a good length ball that doesn't quite spin as much as Chandimal thinks it would. Natural variation, oh boy"
can't time the short and wide ball outside off and has to settle for three with a cut through cover
"offers him width to see if he'll take it on. But the ball dips on Lakmal, sharply, so much that his hit over long-on skews off the inside edge to midwicket"
he's pulling out all his tricks now - a legbreak that ends up a hip-high full toss. Chandimal is so surprised he just blocks it out.
"sliding into middle and leg, Lakmal turns it to midwicket"
"advances too early, giving Jadeja every opportunity to pull his length back on middle. Lakmal's heave goes off the inside edge to long-on"
"good length ball outside off, defends"
"tosses it up on middle and leg, Chandimal offers the straight bat"
"gets back and slices a quicker ball on middle stump through the covers. Good shot from Chandimal. Good footwork, great hands"
"goes for the big hit and even though it is largely miscued, it lands in an unmanned part of the ground - long-on, why would India have a long-on at a score of 121 for 8? - and trickles over."
"spears in a quicker, good length ball on off stump. Lakmal keeps it out"
"will that be iiiiiit? No, Umesh running back from mid-on is unable to catch up with a big hit towards long-on. Lakmal charges out and goes for broke"
"steps out, but Ashwin is able to adjust by pulling his lenght back and flattening his trajectory. Chandimal is forced to block"
"good length ball on off stump, opens the face towards point"
nudges a fuller delivery on middle to midwicket
"that's a legbreak, and it's launched to the midwicket boundary! Chandimal's slog sweep works a charm as he picks the ball up from a good length on off stump"
"<b>extra bounce</b> on off stump, but Lakmal rides it well, softening his grip on the bat and making sure it goes down to point"
"<b>dropped</b>! The bottom of the leading edge comes right back at Ishant, at just below waist-height, which makes it fairly straightforward. The problem might be that it lobs up a lot slower than the bowler expects"
<b>leading edge</b> but it falls clear of point running back. Kohli offers his appreciation for the effort. He doesn't care about the runs. He needn't
"back of a length and outside off, pushes it through cover"
draws him forward with a fuller delivery outside off. Chandimal defends with soft hands and squirts it down to the third man boundary to raise a half-century
"<b>keeps low</b> but with it being outside off, the danger is far lesser in comparison. Chandimal defends to cover"
"gives it some air outside off, Lakmal flashes at it and gets a thick outside edge behind point. Substitute Vijay Shankar gets across to stop a single"
brings the batsman forward with his flight as Lakmal defends the ball on off stump
"closes the bat face, perhaps a touch too early, and the leading edge greets a quicker, fuller ball on middle"
"pulls off a late cut, his feet working well to take him deep into his crease and beside the ball. Vijay Shankar has another chase, and he succeeds in keeping it away from the boundary"
"gets the ball to drift away a touch, as he tosses it up. Lakmal keeps bat and pad together as he blocks"
"tempts the tailender into a big stroke with an invitingly loopy delivery outside off, but Lakmal keeps his senses and defends it"
"full and tailing into the right-hander, Chandimal plays it well"
gets a good length ball to straighten enough that Chandimal is squared up while defending his off stump
gets forward to block a good length ball outside off. He's into the shot a touch too early so the impact of the ball makes the bat face close in his hands
"<b>inside edge as the ball keeps low</b>. For half a second, Chandimal things this is there to be punched through cover. But the problem is that it has just enough inward movement - Umesh running in hiding the shine of the ball - and variation in bounce to draw a false shot to long leg"
"<b>signs of reverse</b>. Umesh goes a touch wider of the crease for a probing, full-length delivery on off stump. Chandimal does well to keep his front foot away from the line of his bat as he flicks through midwicket"
very late in bringing himself forward to a fullish delivery on off stump. India definitely looking to blast the SL tail out
"goes straight on and Chandimal is able to account for that only off the pitch as he pushes his hands at the ball, but makes sure to keep it down to point"
skips out of his crease to escort the flighted delivery away to long-on
hangs back to block a quicker delivery on off stump
"pummels it over the top - straight over the bowler's head. What a shot! <b>That's the fifty partnership</b>. Gets to the pitch of the ball outside off, and that's why he is able to power it away"
"tossed up delivery outside off, defends"
"<b>carrom ball</b> and Lakmal is beaten like a snare drum. He's stuck in the crease, so he can at least read the direction of the spin off the pitch. But this one is pitched full enough to deny him that courtesy. So he attempts a frantic poke and is left behind by a beauty"
handles capably the fuller delivery on off stump
"he's getting decent curl in the air, into the right-hander, but Chandimal, and his sublime wrists, are able to tackle reverse swing. Flicks it to the right of short midwicket. The trap is set, the trap is beaten"
"back of a length and outside off, defends"
turns a shortish delivery on off stump to backward square leg
blocks a back of a length delivery on off stump
"fullish on off stump, Chandimal angles his front leg away from interfering with his bat swing as he sends the ball to short midwicket"
"angles the ball into leg stump, on a fullish length, Lakmal stays back to block"
"that's a carrom ball, sliding down leg, Lakmal flicks it, seems to miss it, but as soon as Saha takes it, Ashwin thinks about <b>a review</B> for caught behind. Vijay from short leg insists he hears something. '<b>No spike</b> [on Ultra-Edge]</b>' says third umpire Nigel Llong"
heaves at a fuller delivery on middle and only the bottom edge saves him from being bowled
pushes it back to the bowler
tries to reach a full delivery slid into the pads with a closed face. Gets a leading edge through cover
"looks for the big heave-ho over mid-on, but Ashwin's dip spoils all those plans"
"tails into the right-hander, does this yorker, and it goes off the pads to long leg"
covers the line of a shortish delivery on off stump which seems to straighten a tad bit
uses the angle into him to turn the back of a length delivery to short midwicket
"<b>scary bounce</b>, for this delivery is directed straight at the body, at decent pace. One second, Chandimal is trying to block, next he is hurrying to keep the ball down, yanking the bottom hand away and forcing the bat face down"
"after negotiating a ripper, he's send a leg-stump half-volley to long leg! He fought hard. He seemed to be one of the few who still wanted to be there in the middle. But seeing the opportunity for some runs, he lets his natural instincts take over. Powerful flick shot. But it lands safely in Ashwin's hands. India one wicket away."
<b>inswinging yorker</b> and he keeps it out well. Umesh flashes a fiendish little grin. He's on 99 Test wickets. It's a race into the record-books
"tossed up delivery outside off, Lakmal drives to long-off"
defends a good length ball on off stump
very late decision to try a late cut - and the good length ball outside off beats his top-edge!
lunges forward to defend a flighted delivery outside off. Gets an inside edge to short leg
<b>falls short of short leg</b>. Ashwin drags the tailender outside off for a defensive prod. The drift is followed by dip and turn to take the inside edge. Lovely stuff
lunges forward onto off stump to defend a tossed up delivery
"<B>pins him on the front pad</b> with a quick, reverse-swinging delivery as Lakmal tries to flick. It would have slid down leg"
"goes short and outside off, Lakmal slogs and misses"
good length ball wanders harmlessly down leg
"<b>so close to off stump</b>! It's a back of a length ball that hits the deck and veers in on the target. Lakmal, having set himself to cut, is so slow to bring his bat down"
keeps out a good length ball on off stump
"shortish and outside off, Lakmal tries to punch through cover, but the ball cuts back in off the pitch and beats the inside edge"
"carrom ball, pitching on leg stump, pinning Gamage on the front pad. Hasn't straightened enough for the lbw"
tosses it up on middle and off. Gamage plays it down well
"beats the outside edge and is it bowled? That's what is being <b>reviewed</b> because the bail has come off. And replays confirm that <b>Ashwin has unleashed another carrom ball to become the fastest bowler in Test history to 300 Test wickets</b>. This one perfectly pitched on leg stump, on a fuller length to draw the batsman forward, but not quite so much that he can get to the ball on the full. The angle in makes Gamage play inside the line. The turn ensures the rest."
