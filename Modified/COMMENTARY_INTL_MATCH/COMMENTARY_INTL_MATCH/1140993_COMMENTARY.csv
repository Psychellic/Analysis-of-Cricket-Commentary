"full, and too wide outside off. He's got to bowl that again"

"short outside off, and Pandya flat-bats it past the bowler. Mid on does well to make a lot of ground, but his diving stop just isn't good enough. Four more for Pandya"

"length ball outside off, and jagging away from Stirling. He mistimes a cut to point"
"<b>taken at first slip!</b> Just a bit of shape away from the right-hander, and Stirling can't resist the width. Tries to punch it towards cover but he's nowhere near the pitch of the ball. Takes the outside edge, and easily pocketed by the team's safest fielder"
