"length on outside off., Mathews goes right back and defends back"
"<strong>would you believe it, three in the over and Nabi is turning the match on its head!</strong> Another arm ball outside off, beautiful length as well creating the doubt in Mathews' mind as to come forward or go back, he does neither, hangs his bat out and the outside edge takes the Shahzad's gloves before being safely pouched by first slip"

<strong>What are you DOING UDANA?!</strong> 19 overs left to bat and Udana lifts his head for a wild slog over the River Taff. Full and straight on the stumps from Dawlat and the zing bails go flying as middle stump is knocked back. Dawlat runs through wagging his index finger to the skies. SL team management might be doing more than that once Udana walks through the changing room door.
"greeted with a bouncer. Lakmal handled it well ducking comfortably, Shahzad behind the stumps was toppled by it though, drawing a laugh from Dawlat."
"<strong>EDGE! </strong>Doesn't carry. Short of a length on fourth stump, Dawlat cramps him as he tries to fend back, played it with soft hands though and it bounces four yards short of Shahzad. Got more of Lakmal's right/bowling hand than the shoulder of the bat and the physio is on the field now to give some numbing spray."

Dawlat chases it down from short fine leg and an off balance relay is rushed to Shahzad. Malinga was five yards short but Shahzad was pulled away from the stumps by Dawlat's hurried throw and his flick back to the stumps wasn't going to be in time as a result.

"<strong>DROPPED!</strong> Shelled! Grassed! Kusal Mendis! Zazai was late trying to pull Malinga at 131 kph/81 mph, skier is in the air for a long time as Kusal Mendis sprints in from deep square leg.

But he made a monumental mess of it."

Thisara had about 1.5 seconds to cover 15 yards haring to his left. The ball never got more than 10-15 yards above the ground but he judged it immaculately before diving forward to clasp on two inches above the turf. Spectacular, a momentum-shifting effort!"
