off the mark straightaway but a steer that is to third man's right. Sprinted out quickly and was alive to the possibility of a second

stays back to cut this but only finds point
"down the track but Chase shortens his length and he can't get it away, hits his pad and rolls into the legside"
pushed past cover
"stifled appeal, dipped and hurried on to him and hit his pad, defeating the push, but going down leg probably"
tapped to mid-off
"good line, in the corridor and on a length, Shakib has a waft at it and misses"
"tailing into the pads again, he's been very inconsistent with his lines. Shakib misses the flick, but they get a leg-bye to short fine leg"
"tailing in again, but this was a bit quicker and Tamim was too late on the flick. Leading edge rolls to point"
"<b>got him!</b> This was on the pads again and Tamim flicked it well, but Holder at short midwicket plucks it out, holding it low to his right. Moved very quickly and very agilely - had to because the ball was travelling. Smart take by the captain"
"oooh that one popped in the air, but no one at short fine leg. Jagged in from a length and bounced a bit more than he expected, and he gets a glove to it while trying to tickle it fine."
"good length outside off, steered to third man"
"smashes this straight back over the bowler's head. Down the track, gets to the pitch and plays the straight drive to lofted perfection"
