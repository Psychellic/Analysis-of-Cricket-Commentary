"full and swinging away, Guptill strides forward and caresses a lovely drive through cover for four. Languid drive, elegant. Not the greatest timing."
"135 kph, pulls the length back slightly. Short outside off, swinging away a touch. Defended. Better length"
"this is excellent. Even off the last ball, he looked for one. Full and straight, driven to mid-on for a run"
"full delivery outside off, Munro lets his hands through the line but finds mid-off for nothing"
"a slower ball, pace off the ball, hit away, punched past cover for a run. Looks like West Indies have a plan for Munro"
"poor line. 137 kph, back of a length but he drifts on Guptill's hips, who is aware of the opportunity with fine leg up. Placed behind square with a flick."
"that's tripe. Short and well down leg, would have been wide but Munro wants six. Smashes the filthy long-hop way over backward square leg. Easy pickings"
"ooh, over point. In the air but falls in no-man's land. It was full outside off, Munro clears his front leg, looking to go straight but the ball skews off the outside half, sliced. Gets enough bat to clear the infield"
"flat and straight, pushed to mid-off. Another very good single"
"drags the length back again, short outside off, punched away past cover for a run. One more. Hardly any dot balls"
"another terrific single. Just one bad ball but 11 off the over already. Slightly short on the pads, Munro misses a flick, struck on the pad, one to short third man"
"full and straight, Guptill's massive front-foot stride results in one to long-on"
"fantastic batting. This is what India do very well in the Powerplay. Good length on middle and leg, worked to midwicket for one. That was a good delivery, but not a dot ball"
"there is deep midwicket in place but falls in front. Full and straight, Munro shovels a flick to that man."
"well placed. NO-BALL! Shortish and wide outside off, Guptill caresses a punch past point. Third man runs around, but just one. He is actually just behind the line is Taylor. Not a no-ball. But it is"
"the free hit is smeared to deep midwicket, a short offcutter around off."
"138 kph, full and straight, driven back. Taylor gets down in his follow-through and parries the ball to mid-on. A good early call of 'yea, yea, yea' from Guptill"
"over deep midwicket. That area is so strong for him that he hardly cares that the man is on the boundary. Full on middle and leg, smeared away over the boundary with immense bottom-handed power"
"a dot ball to finish. Very quick around middle and leg, driven to mid-on"
"flat and wide outside off, carved to backward point"
"92 kph, full and straight, worked away to midwicket. Two dots"
"short and wide, Guptill tries to thrash the ball through point, but chops it away towards cover instead"
"juuuust over point. Full and straight, Guptill tries to go over cover, but the legbreak spins away, takes the outside half and slices away towards cover point who dives to his left but the ball just evades him."
"92 kph, flat on the pads, Guptill misses a sweep, the worst ball of the over. But Guptill isn't in the best touch"
"this is worse than the previous delivery and Guptill doesn't miss out. Flat down leg, but Guptill nails a sweep past backward square leg. Too easy"
"full and flat outside off, Munro opens his stance and drills a drive past cover"
"more tripe. Short and wide outside off, Munro knows his areas, stays on the back foot and pummels a swat over mid-off."
"103 kph, better bowling, to the field. A straight yorker is hit back to Guptill, who deflects it to long-on, so they don't run"
"nice comeback. Full, and on the pads. Jammed out to long-on"
"overpitched and wide outside off, shovelled away to long-on, one more"
"100 kph, full down leg, inside-edged into the pad. A fantastic comeback from Nurse, not only because of the results but because of his adjustment"
"lovely shot. Flight around off, Guptill clears his front leg and lofts the ball over mid-off. No fuss, not over-hit. Just timed"
"flat around off, punched to long-on. Guptill setting himself up"
"the googly, flat outside off, swatted to mid-on"
"flat on the pads again, worked to mid-on. Brathwaite runs forward but fumbles, no extras"
"flat and quick down leg, Guptill misses another hoick, toe-ends his slog sweep to short third man"
"93 kph, he has given himself so much room with the intent to open up the off side. Badree is straight as he always is. But Munro badly mis-times a drive past cover."
"flat down leg, worked down to short fine leg"
"89 kph, shortish and wide, slapped to cover."
"overpitched but straight, nicely drive to long-off"
"really full and straight again, hit out to long-on"
"96 kph, so much power from Munro. Flat and straight again, Munro gets underneath the length and stabs a heave over long-on with nonchalant ease"
"looking for one more. Full and straight, but the ball squeezes away to midwicket via the inside edge"
"full and straight, hammered down to long-on. Just past the stumps. Great timing"
"full and straight, nudged with soft hands to deep midwicket, looking for two, won't get them"
"short outside off, back of a length, can't hit the ball to the boundary so he dabs a shot to cover for one. Simple, effective batting"
"aargh. Hit away to deep midwicket for one, the throw from deep midwicket hits the stumps direct at the keeper's end, the ball ricochets away for an extra"
nudged to short fine leg for one
"looking for the scoop over fine leg but it's too full, chipped away to deep square leg"
"fifty for Munro again! Flicked for six to get to a 26-ball 50. On the pads, and Munro extends his clip over square leg"
"in the slot again and outta here. Full and straight, shovelled away over midwicket. Too easy. Can't keep bowling there"
"sliced away for one. Full and wide outside off, carved away past point for a run. Deep point cleans up"
"full around off, drilled back at Emrit, who half-stops the ball"
"poor delivery. A high full toss outside off, carved away to deep point"
"full and wide, carved away to the sweeper cover"
"great running, full on leg, nudged with soft hands to deep midwicket. He gets two"
"two more, fine batting from Guptill, just nudged into the gap behind square for a couple more"
"drifts down leg, wide"
"five runs! Extremely sloppy cricket from West Indies. A legcutter down leg, Fletcher's legs aren't together, the ball finds a way through for five extras."
into the gap for another couple. So easy. On the pads and flicked away past midwicket
"short around off, pulled past midwicket for two more. Square leg runs to his left."
"a chance, but over the boundary? A shortish delivery around off, Nurse stays back and mis-times a heave towards deep midwicket. Nurse is patrolling the boundary, but he just can't pull it in."
"two more. Wow. Just soooo easy. Shortish around off, nudged away towards midwicket with soft hands"
"falls in no-man's land again. A high full toss around off, heaved with such bad timing that it lands in front of long-off, running in"
"a good wide yorker outside off, creeps underneath the bat, inside the tramline. A big appeal for caught behind, no says the umpire. Guptill is unfazed, <strong>but West Indies review</strong>. Did his bat hit the ground? Or the ball kiss the inside edge? There is a big spike on snicko, but not sure what that is. 'Looking like a gap there, a clear gap between bat and ball,' says the umpire. Not out, may have been something else causing that noise."
"a low full toss around off, smashed to long-off for one."
"101 kph, six more. Without the best of timing either. Full around off, Munro clears his front leg and lofts the ball over long-off. So much power"
"well bowled, a straight yorker has been jammed away to point"
"104 kph, on the pads, shovelled away to deep midwicket for a run"
drops short and Guptill's waiting. Goes back in the crease and nails a swat over midwicket. Easy as ...
"sliced away over cover for two more. Full outside off, Guptill tries to go over mid-off but the ball skews away off the outside half"
"Emrit's maiden T20I wicket. Full and wide outside off, not the greatest delivery but Guptill's bat comes down later than he would have liked. Gets a thick outside edge which is easily accepted by the keeper"
"back of a length outside off, carved away towards short third man"
"full and wide outside off, hammered away to cover, on the bounce"
"134 kph, a wide yorker, well bowled, just inside the tramline"
"flat and straight, worked to midwicket"
"flat and wide outside off, Bruce gives himself some room and slashes a cut past point for four."
"chips down the pitch and flicks the ball into the gap at square leg for a couple more. Lots of twos, large dimensions"
nudged away past midwicket for a run
"sits back for the googly, it's short too, so Munro hangs back and forehand-pulls over midwicket for six more"
"too wide, fired away well outside off"
"full and wide outside off, Munro stays in his crease and slog sweeps it this time, waaaay over midwicket. Munro not holding back"
"there for the shot, not a bad option. Full outside off, Bruce misses a scoop. Just no connection"
"just over the sweeper cover this time for six more. Full and wide outside off, Bruce gets underneath the length and carves the ball with immense power over extra cover. Clears the fielder"
"full around off, 137 kph, shovelled to long-on. Not timed"
"well bowled, a wide yorker, carved away to deep point"
"118 kph, a legcutter outside off, Bruce walks across and helps the ball to short fine leg. A few yards away from four"
"135 kph, full and straight, shovelled away to deep midwicket"
goes over the boundary again. Not timed again but Munro has exceptional bottom-handed power. He picked up a slower delivery on leg and clipped it over deep midwicket. Had to generate his own power but too easy
"92 now! Two on the bounce. On the pads, and in Munro's wheelhouse. The trajectory is different, much flatter but that power again, over deep square leg, to Emrit's left, who couldn't get a hand on it"
"not called a wide, fair enough, consistent umpiring. On the tramline outside off, a wide yorker, but fair call"
"looking for the wide yorker again, carved away to deep point"
"a short delivery around off, mis-timed away to deep midwicket"
"hits another gap in the field. Good length outside off, he lofts the ball intentionally over cover this time for a couple"
"looking for the scoop but Brathwaite bowls it extremely full, worked to deep midwicket"
"full and straight, pushed to long-on for a run"
"full and wide outside off, sliced past point for four. Knows his areas, where the gap is and so opens the bat face accordingly. Exceptional batting"
"good stop by Gayle at backward point. Full and wide outside off, sliced to Gayle who misses the stumps at the batsman's end with Munro well short"
"132 kph, full and straight, hit down to long-on for a single"
"you run that risk, but I don't mind that option from Bruce. Full and straight, Bruce walks across, backs his ability to execute the scoop, but misses. A high-risk, high-reward option. Risk wins."
"flat and wide outside off, sliced away past point for a couple. Onto 99 now"
"a low full toss is bunted to long-on. <strong>The first batsman to hit three T20I hundreds, and two at the same venue</strong>. Loud applause from the crowd, a fistpump from Munro. He's owning this format"
"a chip away to deep midwicket for a couple, in the gap nicely"
"a poor ball. In the slot, full around off and smashed over long-on with immense power"
"100 kph, full and straight, skewed to deep midwicket"
"this is flat and quick, smeared away to deep midwicket. He has scored 42 runs in that area"
"Kitchen is sacrificed. That's the first I've seen of that shot. It's a charging scoop, runs at the bowler, looking to generate momentum and take the ball on the full but Munro misses the ball, the ball misses the off stump. Kitchen runs down for one, Fletcher's throw misses at the batsman's end but straight to Emrit who runs back and finds Kitchen half a pitch short"
"full and wide outside off, sliced to deep point"
"a good yorker, around off, nudged to long-on. Wonder if New Zealand should be going from both ends, with Munro now slightly fatigued."
a low full toss in the gap at deep midwicket for one. Cottrell runs around to his left to stop one. Losing a bit of momentum
"out if he hit. Midwicket misses at the batsman's end, and New Zealand get an overthrow. Full outside off, squeezed to midwicket, who runs in and misses"
badly timed away past midwicket for a couple more. Off the inside half
"full outside off, mis-timed to long-on. Losing his shape, understandable with fatigue creeping in"
"108 kph, an offcutter on middle and leg, Williamson misses a slog sweep, hit on the arm"
"what a shot. Full and straight from Taylor, Williamson does the Rohit Sharma, just extends his on-drive. And then gets the right follow-through, way over long-on with incredible timing"
"another terrific shot. Full around off, nailed over the bowler. Fine place to hit the ball, good timing too. <b>New Zealand's highest T20I score</b>"
"that's a poor ball. Short down leg and Williamson swivels on a pull, big gap behind square for four"
"chopped on, a much better delivery, it's a slower delivery on a good length outside off. Williamson tries to force the ball through the leg side, but the ball takes the inside edge and onto leg stump. A more-than-handy cameo"
"lost some momentum and timing over the last few overs. A low full toss around off, Munro picks his favourite midwicket area but mis-times his checked drive and finds long-on. Another stunning assault from Munro"
"134 kph, terrific wide yorker, creeps underneath the bat"
"how? These batsmen are so good at this shot. He knows Brathwaite will attempt another yorker, so he walks right across and scoops the ball over the keeper for six. The hand-eye coordination needed for that shot makes it so tough but it's so effective"
"four leg byes. Full down leg, Phillips shuffles across, misses a flick, but the ball clips the pad and past the keeper"
"looks for it again, the lap scoop. A slower delivery slightly, toe-ended away towards midwicket"
"134 kph, misses his length, a low full toss, Santner waits for the ball to come to him before nicely chipping a six over long-on. Fine timing"
"and gone first ball! Full and wide outside off, the ball swinging away, Walton hits the ball nicely, a languid drive but straight to Munro at cover point. An easy, low catch and West Indies are one down"
"full and wide, swinging away, nicely hit to point. Lovely languid drive again, but he finds the fielder"
"good length outside off, shaping away, outside-halved down to third man for a run"
"133 kph, full around off, Gayle solid in defense. Often gives himself a chance"
"Gayle's gone and with that, West Indies? Dug in, the bouncer to Gayle is often the best ball to him. In Southee's half, and it keeps rising. Gayle tries to sway out of the line but the ball takes the glove and lobs to the keeper. A duck for the Boss"
"full outside off, wide of the crease. Defended into the off side by Powell"
"full and swinging in, inside-halved to deep square leg for a couple. Have to watch for that inswinger"
"full around off, nicely bowled, driven to mid-off"
"short and wide outside off, way over Fletcher's head, wide called"
"mis-timed and pulled inside. Full on middle and leg, Fletcher drives over mid-on. Hit over the infield, with the direction of swing. Good shot selection, doesn't quite have the timing"
"oversteps does Boult. Full and wide outside off, jammed away into the off side. Good call, Boult is over the line. Seen many of those ones missed"
terrific end-overs bowling but he oversteps again. A lovely wide yorker inside the tramline. A bigger no-ball
this will be wide. A wayward over from Boult. This is outside the tramline and wide called
"a low full toss on off, Powell looks to hit it straight but skews the ball off the inside edge past short fine leg. Has to watch for that inswinger"
"absolutely smashed. Short around off, Powell goes back and creams a pull past midwicket with incredulous power"
"it's over, finally! Short around leg, hurried for pace, worked to midwicket"
"good length outside off, mis-timed into the off side"
"smeared away past square leg for four more. Full around off, Fletcher wants to go straight but the ball takes the inside half and the power takes the ball to the boundary"
"smashed away for four more. Short around off, Fletcher stays in his crease and swats the ball over midwicket. Intentionally in front of square, good execution"
"that's a poor ball. Short and wide outside off, Fletcher carves a cut behind point for six. Fantastic timing"
"an offcutter on middle and off, pulled to deep square leg"
"lovely hitting from West Indies. Short down leg, hammered behind square for four. Just placed"
"Kitchen starts with a yorker on middle, jammed into the pads"
"full and straight again, inside-edged to fine leg for none"
"fired in again, around off, hit away to wide mid-on for a single"
"just past square leg. Full down leg, looking to go straight, over mid-on, but the ball takes the inside half and flies away past square leg"
"the big slog is taken at cover, running back. Flight outside off, Powell looks to hit the ball over mid-on but the ball is wider outside off. Takes the outside half and lobs up for Williamson to run back, keep his eyes on the ball and take a good reverse-cupped catch."
a yorker around off is jammed out
"full and flat down leg, too full for Hetmyer to connect with a sweep"
"just over midwicket for six. Slow on the pads, Hetmyer runs down, gets underneath the length and hits the ball high in the air but over midwicket. Just enough to clear the fielder"
flicked away to deep midwicket
"flat outside off, Fletcher attempts a fine late cut but makes no contact"
"and run-out! West Indies are capitulating. Flat around middle and leg, Fletcher gives himself some room and cuts to Guptill at backward point. Fletcher runs down without calling and makes a hand gesture to indicate what is Hetmyer doing, who then sets off for a single. But too late. The throw to the keeper is decent"
"lovely shot. Overpitched around off, he lofts the ball easily over cover. Terrific spot to hit the ball"
"full and quick outside off, hit to cover with bad timing"
"swiped into the gap at midwicket for four. Quick down leg, hit nicely enough, and found the gap. Deep midwicket can't cut it in"
"over mid-on this time, same result. Full on middle and leg, swatted away over the fielder"
"full around middle and leg, following Fletcher, jammed back"
"superbly hit. Full outside off, Fletcher makes some room and lifts the ball over wide long-off for six. Sensational timing. Another drop catch in the crowd"
"and again. Six more. Backs away again does Fletcher, and cleanly lifts the ball over long-off. Dropped again in the crowd. Appalling catching beyond the boundary"
"quick and flat on the pads, worked to deep midwicket"
"the googly? 84 kph, around middle and leg. Fletcher doesn't pick the googly, hit back"

"a wide yorker outside off, jammed out yet again"
"flat on the pads, worked away into the gap at midwicket for a run"
"<strong>out with a direct hit.</strong> Full on middle and leg, hit towards short mid-on for a run that is not there. Santner runs around, picks up, turns around but misses at the bowler's end"
"the googly! Fletcher doesn't pick it and pays the price. Sodhi did him in with that flight, a googly with lots of loop is quite rare. Fletcher does not move his feet, backs away and swings wildly, the ball finds a big gap between bat and pad to knock back off stump. Superb wristspin bowling"

"that's short down leg, a long-hop and Brathwaite picks it, stays back and lets all his frustration out with a massive swat over square leg"

"full and wide outside off, caressed to the deep cover fielder"
"picks the length early, goes back and pulls to deep midwicket. An easy two had Brathwaite not slipped while turning for the second"
"superb fielding. A low full toss outside off, smashed to Williamson's left at cover"

"good length outside off, carved down to third man for a run"

"quick outside off, bunted to cover for a run"
"full around off, nudged to long-on. Tidy over"
"looking for the sweep. Straight and flat, Emrit misses a sweep, off the pad down to fine leg. A big appeal from the bowler, no says the umpire, <strong>and Williamson reviews</strong>. This is very close, doesn't look like there is any bat or glove on that. Three reds on HawkEye and the decision is reversed. Good review from New Zealand. WI effectively eight down."
"first ball, he clears his front leg and nails a heave over long-on. Another drop in the crowd"
"fires this in flatter down leg, nudged to short fine leg"
"beauty! 85 kph, quick around off, some drift and the ball beats the bat on the outside edge"

"115 kph, slower delivery outside off, defended into the off side"
"superb yorker, on leg stump and quick. Somehow Nurse gets some bat on it"
"a tad short, around off. Nurse backs away and pulls but a thick leading edge lobs towards short fine leg. Phillips runs around, dives head on, both feet off the ground, but just can't get across"
"no one is dropping that! It's a low full toss around off, Taylor closes the bat face too early, the ball takes the leading edge again and lobs to Santner at cover"
