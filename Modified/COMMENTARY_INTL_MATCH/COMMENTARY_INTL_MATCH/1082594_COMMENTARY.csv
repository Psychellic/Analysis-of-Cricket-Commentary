"good length, late swing in at off stump, gets a stride across and gets the inside half of the bat as he pushes it to midwicket"
"<b>loud appeal, but that's going down.</b> Trademark inswinger from Sandeep, but it starts at middle and raps him on leg as he looks to whip over square leg"
"good length, swinging in at middle stump, defended to midwicket off the back foot"
"<b>got him! What a sight!</b> More inswing. This one is at a length too, nips back slightly. Mayank wants to crash this on the up through the off side, leaves a huge gap between bat and pad, perfect passageway to the stumps that are knocked out"
"full and swinging in at off stump, shuffles across and defends to cover point"
"good length, angled into the pads, flicked late, straight to short fine leg"
"good length at off stump, comes on slowly, he hangs back and taps it to backward point's left"
"good length, in the corridor, walks into the shot, punches it straight to covers"
"short and wide, eyes light up for Smith, but the ball skids through and beats the under edge on his attempted cut"
"short and wide again, hard hands from Smith once more, mistimes the punch and it bounces towards mid-off"
"good length, slight movement away from outside off. Follows it, opens the face and runs it down to third man"

"good length outside off, slight movement away off the pitch, pushed into the covers off the front foot"
"dot ball pressure. Steps out and swings haphazardly across the line, misses the line and the length completely. This flies over the off stump"
"<b>dropped.</b> Vohra puts it down at cover. This is good length, tries to whip it on the up, across the line. Leading edge hangs up in the cover region. Vohra has to run backwards as debutant Natarajan backs away at extra cover. That was Natarajan's catch. In the end, Vohra has too much to think about and lets it slip as he goes to the ground"
"good length at off stump, walks across and whips it off the middle to deep square"
"shot. Bouncer at middle stump at that pace will never trouble Rahane. Rocks back and nails the hook shot, which flies over short fine"
"good length at off stump, this time  no feet. Stays in the crease, watches it closely, opens the face at the last moment and runs it past where first slip would have been"
"and again. This is slightly shorter than the previous ball, he's taller at the crease as he runs it to third man"
"good length at middle stump, tails away from Rahane as he leans in but he can offer enough of the face to push it to mid-on on the up"
"good length at off stump, Smith doesn't lean in like Rahane, but can whip it to mid-on anyway"
"good length at off stump, turns it into open leg side"
"a familiar sight in recent times. Good length, moving away from off stump, not a bad ball. But Smith's superhuman wrists are at this, on the up, and get it through cover point"
"even better. Good length at middle stump, gives the charge, makes some room and uses his wrists to cream it between cover and extra"

"good length at middle stump, hangs in the crease and glances it to deep square"
"good length, angled in at the pads, flicked to short fine's left"

"good length, fired in at middle stump, punched to deep midwicket off the back foot"
"short and angled across him, punched off the back foot to sweeper cover"
"<b>he has Rahane off his second ball.</b> Full and wide outside off stump, Rahane wants to crash this over the cover boundary but he's not to the pitch of the ball. Bat turns in his hands as he executes the sliced shot and it is straight to Stoinis at sweeper cover"

"<b>shoooooot.</b> Full, slight shape back but Smith seems to know it's coming. Full face as he drives - beats the bowler, beats mid-on, beats long-off"

"yorker at leg stump, clipped off his toes to deep square leg"

"in the blockhole at off stump, squeezed out to extra cover"

"arm ball, good length at off stump, wants to tuck it into the leg side, gets an inside edge onto leg"

"yorker at leg stump from around the wicket, jammed out to deep midwicket"

"more in the slot this time. Waiting for the low full toss at leg stump, gets it, lifts it over the keeper"
...and goes short. And wide. Outside off. Sits up for Christian who walks across ever so slightly and pulls this well in front of square and over the boundary
"<b>oh good catch.</b> This is overpitched at off stump, Christian will back himself to hit this out of the park any day. On this occassion, he gets the bottom of the bat. It loops in front of Maxwell at long-on, but he watches it closely and moves down with it to catch it inches off the floor"
"yorker outside off stump, can only squeeze this down the ground to Maxwell at long-on, who is onto it quickly and throws it on the bounce to the keeper's end to keep it down to one"

"length ball, a little wider, opens his bat face to dab to backward point"
"off the mark with a fluky boundary. Width this time, fairly short too. Amla throws his bat at it and gets a thick edge that races away wide of wide slip"
"fullish outside off, driven airily, on the up, to the left of cover. There's a man at deep point who sweeps up to his right"
"short, rising ball close to off stump. Vohra hops to ride the bounce and dab it down to third man"
"back of a length, close to off stump, lets it come on and dabs to short third man - point went back to the boundary and third man came into the circle after the strike turned over"
Starts off with a length ball that nips away in the corridor with extra bounce. Beats Vohra's tentative defensive poke
"long way down the leg side this time, Vohra can't even attempt to connect with that"

"fullish, on middle stump, clipped in the air towards deep square leg"
"back of a length close to off stump, punched away to deep point"
"looks for the yorker, maybe. Length is perfect, line is all wrong, a long way down the leg side"
"length ball outside off, nips in slightly. Looks to drive on the up through cover and inside-edges it through square leg"
"length ball on off stump, Amla shuffles across, knows fine leg is inside the circle, and just clips it away, to the left of that fielder"

"back of a length close to off stump, dabbed to third man"
"short and wide, not too bad a ball with deep point  back. Cut away for one"
"short ball outside off. Vohra thought of cutting, but it bounced a fair deal and he decided to leave instead"
"a step out of his crease again, and Dinda bangs it in even shorter this time. This one gets up to shoulder height, and this time it was angled into Vohra, cramping him for room, and he top-edges his flat-bat leg-side swat and deep square leg moves to his left to take the catch"
"back of a length on off stump, punched firmly back but Dinda gets down quickly to field it in his follow-through, stops it with his left hand"
"back of a length, angling down leg again. Saha looks to glance, can only get some thigh pad on it. Dhoni dives left and stops the ball"
"shortish, just a bit of width, and that's put away brilliantly - both backward point and cover point were in the circle, and he jumped, got on top of the bounce, and split the gap with some deft use of his hands and wrists"
"fuller now, outside off. Saha drags it to mid-on with a lot of bottom hand"
"good ball, nips back from just short of a good length. Saha is caught on the shuffle, looking to work it across the line. Big lbw appeal, not given. There was no inside-edge, but it was given as leg-byes. Would have missed the stumps anyway - height was an issue too"
"shortish and a lot of width, and Amla has just creamed it. Clears his front leg to make extra room, and slaps it away over cover"
"full on off stump, clears his front leg again and whips it hard, but straight to mid-on"
"<b>dropped</b>! Skips down the track and gets a wide length ball. Looks to drive over short cover, who dives to his right, gets a hand to it, but can't hold on - Christian is the fielder"
"whoops. Length ball close to off stump. Looks to hit over extra-cover and he's too early into his shot. May have been the slower offcutter. Drags it in the air, towards mid-on, but it bounces well short"
"full outside off, nearly a yorker. Amla opens his bat face to squeeze it out to deep point"
"slower ball, on off stump. Just back of a length, and Saha puts it away brilliantly. Spots it early, holds his shape, and punches it crisply between cover point and extra-cover"
"bang, another. Fullish on off stump and Saha clears his front leg to launch it over mid-off"
"Full, this time he hits the blockhole on off stump. Saha jabs it back to the bowler"
"length ball on middle and leg, clipped to long-on"
"bowled him! The googly again, and again, the length. Saha is rooted to the crease, doesn't know which way it's turning, and the ball skids through between bat and body and crashes into middle and off. Not sure what shot Saha was trying to play - maybe a punch through cover, and then had to hurriedly change that to a flick, by which time it was too late"
"back of a length, turns in towards middle stump, goes back to work it towards square leg"
"back of a length on off stump, whipped away to deep midwicket"
"very full, on middle stump. LBW appeal after Axar walks across to flick. Rolls towards Bhatia, who misfields at short fine leg, and it runs away for four. All bat. Tahir thought it may have hit Axar's foot first"

"shortish on off stump, pull-whipped to long-on"
"quickish, back of a length on middle and leg, worked away through backward square leg"
"long-hop sliding down leg, he's lucky Amla's placement isn't great. Looks to hit it between short fine leg and deep square leg, ends up hitting it too close to the latter to get more than one for the shot"
"length ball outside off, some sort of cutter for sure, Amla looks to clear his front leg and make himself hitting room to slap over cover. Is too early through his shot and drags it in the air, on the bounce, to long-on"

"slower legcutter wide of off stump, slogged away to deep midwicket"

"short again, well outside off this time, gives Axar a lot of room to free his arms and slog that away down the ground, easily clears long-on"
"quickish legbreak, ends up sliding down the leg side. Good take from Dhoni after Axar misses the glance"

"back of a length on middle and off, clipped down to long-on"

"another massive wide. Well wide of off stump this time, Axar simply leaves it"
"fullish on middle and off, clipped to deep midwicket"
"another for Tahir. He reacts, as always, like he's just won the World Cup. Floated up outside off, Axar goes for the big hoick over the leg side. Doesn't turn as much as he expected, and he ends up hitting it straight up in the air, off the outside half of the bat, and it's Tahir himself who settles under this ballooner, moving towards midwicket to catch it"
"back of a length googly, shuffles across and works it to deep backward square leg"
"tossed up outside off, gets a good stride out to drive to long-off"
"tossed up outside off, lands on a good length. Don't think Maxwell knew which way it was turning. It was the legbreak, and he reads it off the pitch and opens his bat face to dab behind point"

"full on leg stump, clipped to long-on"
"length ball pitching middle and leg and turning towards middle, clipped gently towards deep midwicket. Just enough weight on the shot to allow them to run two. They end up running four after a direct hit at the bowler's end runs away for overthrows. They're checking with the third umpire anyway. Miller was well in at that point. Not sure who the thrower was."
quickish delivery down the leg side. I don't know how many wides he's bowled today. Too wide for Maxwell to get bat on the glance

quickish legbreak on off stump. Miller shows the full face to push to long-off
"back of a length close to off stump, chopped away towards deep point"

"length ball slanting into the pads, whipped powerfully but straight to midwicket"
"fullish on middle stump, and Maxwell, being Maxwell plays it with the field in mind. Makes himself room and launches it over mid-off, who's in the circle, lots of bottom hand, and it sails all the way over the rope"
"full on middle and off, clipped to long-off"
"short, and Maxwell rocks back in an instant to pull this up and over. Into the gap between long-on and deep midwicket as well. The placement helped, because he didn't middle it, ended up slicing underneath it somewhat"
"another short ball, and this time he's smashed it. Monstrous pull waaay over wide long-on"

"full-toss, hip-high, angling down leg, swatted away to deep square leg"
"tossed up wide of off, driven to long-off"

"legbreak tossed up outside off, turns a long way and Maxwell's slog hits the toe end and rolls to midwicket"
"looks for the reverse-sweep, misses, and Dhoni bellows a huge appeal for lbw. Looks to have pitched in line and gone straight on. May have been sliding down leg"
"fullish on the stumps, clipped back to the bowler"

"bouncer, Miller steps across to try and hook, can't connect and it sails over his right shoulder"
"in the blockhole on middle stump, and what a shot that is! That delivery is blameless, and Miller simply makes himself room and shovels under it, with a dead-straight bat, back over the bowler's head, and into the rope on the full.
