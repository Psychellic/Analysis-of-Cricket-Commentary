"a peaceful start, all things considered, as a length ball strays so far outside off it barely tickles Vijay into action"
"there we go! Cranks it up to 138 kph, hits the deck, which has been waiting to show off. Back of a length delivery zips past Vijay's nose as he sways away"
"fine leave! Eyes on the ball, feet moving in accordance to the full length, and then the hands shoving his weapon skyward because the line is outside off. Good stuff from Vijay"
"a teaser - the kind that he's been guilty of playing at on this tour - but on this bowling morning, Vijay reverts to his old ways and ignores the ball outside off"
"<b>airy drive</b> and it goes wide of gully. The fuller length triggers Vijay's nerves, makes him push at the ball, with an angled bat. Genuine edge sneaks to the right of Elgar"
"very full, and angling into off stump, Vijay drills it to the left of the bowler, all along the ground"
"<b>seams away</b> outside off from a good length and Vijay wisely avoids it. Decent first over, showing neither this pitch nor the bowlers will be friendly to opening batsmen and that those opening batsmen have been given a talking to about being more sturdy."
"<B>snakes through bat and pad</b>! There is precious little movement, but that is why he is so dangerous. Pitches it on off stump, on a good length, demanding the batsman play at it. Rahul is profoundly uncertain. He's not even ready with a proper defensive stroke by the time the ball wanders to the wicketkeeper"
too wide outside off and he legs a nervous Rahul off the hook
"think about an appeal for lbw as Rahul comes forward and blocks in line with the fourth stump. Philander wonders if this was pad first before bat, but replays show it is all wood"
"hangs back, as he can against a back of a length delivery, and plays late. Good stuff. Blunts it perfectly"
dangles the bait outside off but Rahul is a clever little fish. He won't bite. Good swing on offer for Philander.
"tester... such a tester... and Rahul comes out of it well enough. This is on fourth or fifth stump, the seam wobbling. It hits the deck on a good length and from thereon the batsman is blind about what it might do. So Rahul covers his off stump and tells himself not to commit to a shot until the last minute. Thanks to that, he is able to leave a very dangerous delivery, meant for the outside edge"
"back of a length and outside off, no interest from Vijay."
"lunges forward as he reads the ball to be of good length, but since he has also calculated that it won't threaten his stumps, he shoulders arms."
"<b>right over the stumps</b>! Lbws are going to be rare on this pitch. Bowleds even, considering this ball, pitching <i>just</i> short of a good length, jags back in and wolf-whistles at the middle stumps as it goes through to the keeper"
<b>hits him on the back pocket</b> as Morkel plants a good length grenade and it cuts back into an unsuspecting Vijay. This is seriously tough work for the batsmen
"<b>play and miss</b>. After being peppered by indippers, Vijay sees a length ball on off stump, he is spurred into action because of his worries that it might rag back in. Only this time, Morkel makes it straighten off the seam and beat the outside edge"
"<b>beaten again</b>! Oh boy, this is not for the faint of heart. Probes away in the off stump corridor. Those inswingers from earlier in the over has Vijay uncertain. He pokes. He misses"
"<b>caught behind</b>! Inside edge, deflects off the thigh pad, de Kock needs to dive to his left, always the wrong side for a wicketkeeper, and he pulls off a good grab. It's no fun being an opener in conditions like this, against a bowler like Philander who keeps pegging away on a good length, in line with off stump, demanding a shot, and laughing in your face with just the tiniest bit of movement to beat the middle of the bat"
"back of a length and outside off, Pujara lets it pass"
"good length ball, pitches at a length where the batsman can't drive, with no width to free the arms either. Seams away too. Basically, the perfect ball to bowl in these conditions and Pujara wisely wants to do nothing with it"
full and goes well down leg. Looking for the magic ball that pitches leg and clips off
"lovely work from Pujara. He does not commit to a shot until the last second, and uses soft hands to deal with good length ball wobbling away on middle stump"
<b>wild seam movement</b>! Pitches about two stumps wide of off and then hurtles away towards first slip before de Kock intervenes
<B>that's not nice</b>! It looks like a half-volley. It's wide. There's a giant gap at cover. Vijay thinks there's four runs on offer. But the ball nips away off the pitch and beats the outside edge. Vicious
"full on off stump, Vijay covers it."
"good length on fifth stump, Vijay lunges forward and shoulders arms. He's shaking his head. He's practicing his defence. He's nodding. He's in a fight."
"back of a length and outside off, Vijay's finely honed instincts tells him it won't threaten his stumps. He leaves and is proven right"
"back of a length, hits the deck and darts away into the wicketkeeper's gloves. Vijay is just an innocent bystander"
"there's the one meant for the lbw - full, angled in sharply, and beating Vijay for pace. In the subcontinent, where his mind isn't cluttered by the swing available, he would have hit that to the square leg boundary. Here he plays and misses"
"hits just back of a length on and around off stump, Pujara has to play, the angle is coming into him so he can't just pull his bat out of the way. He indulges in a defence. And realises it's all for naught as the ball seams away and beats the edge"
"shortish and outside off, no shot"
"good stuff from Pujara, he's ready to meet the half-volley with a good, long stride and lays into a straight drive. But even after all that, a South African bowler gets the top of him. Rabada at mid-off dives spectacularly to his right and saves a boundary"
"back of a length and outside off, avoids it like a school yard bully"
jags away off the seam from outside off - and Pujara judges that well and lets it go
"<b>huge appeal for an lbw and South Africa are reviewing</b>. There is so much bounce available on this pitch, and even though this is a good length ball that had it gone straight, would have hit the middle of the bat, veers into the right-hander and thuds into the front pad. Above the knee-roll. The on-field umpire Gould ruled this not out, remember. And HawkEye comes back with umpires call as the ball only just clips the off bail. South Africa retain their review. And the Wanderers continues to be one of the greatest theatres in world cricket."
"full, too far down leg, so much that even a de Kock dive doesn't get him across in time. And he's one of the best behind the wicket"
"too short, and far enough outside off, to make Vijay just stop and stare (hat tip to One Republic)."
full and too far outside off to bother the batsman. And that's not something that can be said of the South African bowlers on a pitch like this
"<b>shoulder of the bat</b> as Vijay stays in line with a back of a length delivery, softens his grip on the bat, and ensures the ball doesn't carry to third slip"
"<b>inside edge</b> as he goes searching for the cover drive on the up! It's only after the sun beats down on this pitch will it quicken up. It will jag around madly. But the pace is a little on the slower side. Vijay finds that out as he goes after a wide, good length ball and ends up finding a single 180 degrees in the opposite direction"
"short of a length and outside off, Pujara ignores it"
"good length on off stump, defends. Vijay is getting a stride going. Good to see."
"another celebrappeal from Philander! Shoves his hands up in the air and just runs to his team-mates in the cordon after pitching a full delivery and watching it behave like a 130 kph offbreak. One second Vijay has it covered, next, he's falling over and hit on the pad. Would have missed leg stump"
gets in line with a back of a length delivery
pulls his bottom hand off the bat to make sure the short of a length indipper goes to ground. Single found to square leg
"<b>thuds into his body</b>, somewhere on the left thigh as he tries to defend a good length ball that darts in off the seam. It moves just so late for a batsman to be in any position to score runs"
too wide outside off and Pujara doesn't care for it
"full and outside off, Vijay ushers it through to the wicketkeeper"
"good length ball a bit too wide to interest Vijay in a battle-hardened, I won't touch those, mood"
"goes wide of the crease to tempt Vijay into changing tactics, but the line is still wide enough, and the length short enough for the batsman to leave again"
"<b>caught behind</b>! Runs on this pitch, against this attack, are a mere illusion. This is a full ball - perhaps even a half-volley to a batsman who isn't hanging back, desperate to have a little more time to read the direction of seam movement - and Vijay goes at it with all hands. The cover drive becomes an outside edge and South Africa celebrate again"
gets back and blocks into the covers
good length and two sets of stumps outside off - the Kohli on-the-up-cover drive ball but this time he doesn't offer the shot. He can't in these conditions
works it away to midwicket
"<b>unplayable</b>! Good length balls shouldn't hit the wicketkeeper's gloves in front of his face and make him fear for his teeth. So what option does the batsman have? Pujara, caught in the crease, brings out a defensive stroke. But the exaggerated seam movement does him easily"
"good length ball on leg stump, he flicks, misses."
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go"
"<b>whispers sweet nothings to the off stump</b> as it goes by! It's only an inch between the ball and the bail. Seductive sh*t. Pujara allows the romance by leaving a good length ball, which to be honest, pitched a good distance outside off and suddenly bounds in towards its love"
"back of a length on off stump, blocks"
"<b>nails him on the body</B>. With so much grass for the seam to bite into, Rabada hits the deck on a good length and makes it seam in so sharply that Kohli lunging forward to block is beaten by a yard"
"good length ball outside off, lets it go"
"short of a good length and outside off, Kohli lets it wander past"
"shoooooooot! He sees a half-volley outside off. Has a clear enough mind to lunge forward, the stride takes him to the pitch of the ball and then he nails it through cover."
"pulls the length back, gets some seam into the right-hander, and Kohli, normally so good off his pads, gets struck on the left thigh while playing a nudge to midwicket"
"gets forward to a ball in the off-stump corridor, the line that batsmen nick-off to, and blocks to gully. Long stride again. Kohli's decided he just has to risk that. Get hit on the body if need be, but he has to counter the sideways movement some how"
looks to slap the full face of the bat on the good length delivery outside off. But it says nothing doing and seams away past the outside edge.
"this shouldn't be possible! The ball pitches on off stump, Pujara comes to meet it, decent stride, soft hands, straight bat, everything per the mannual. Only for that trademark late seam movement from Philander to make him look like a mug"
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go"
"fuller delivery, too far outside off, and Pujara has an easy enough leave"
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
defends a shortish delivery on off stump. He's 0 off 26 balls now
"that's a 140 kph legbreak! Kohli, on the back foot, tries to make contact. But he's nowhere near"
rams into his thighs as Kohli is late on the flick? How is he to know this ball will dart back in when the last one reared away wildly?
"the length brings him forward and halfway through the square drive, he checks the shot, remembering where he is and the kind of pitch he's batting on. Two behind point"
<b>that's unreal</b>! Hits the deck at short of a length. It bursts away past the outside edge. Good on Kohli not to follow the movement.
"good length, to which he strides forward, and hoists the bat skyward. His feet are moving very well, and that gives him the best chance to counter South Africa"
"full on middle, Kohli presses forward and brings his bat down perfectly straight in front of pad to defend"
"good length delivery outside off, 128 kph, not much seam or swing. And Pujara leaves on length"
"on a length, 127 kph, zoning in on off. Pujara defends confidently, his 28th dot ball"
"good leave that. Just outside off, 128 kph, on a length. Pujara didn't waft, instead lifted his hands and let a good ball go"
"<strong>phew, beauty</strong>. That one got him forward. Full and swinging away, Pujara comes forward to defend but the ball moves away generously. Not very close to the outside edge"
"another leave, 128 kph, full and wide, left alone by Pujara"
"another leave. Full and wide outside off, Pujara gets forward, thinks of driving and leaves. Philander is 1 for 1 from seven overs."
"shortish delivery down leg, 143 kph, nudged away through square leg for a run. Lots of extra bounce, one hand comes off the bat."
"another leave, there was width at 135 kph, and it was a run-scoring opportunity but Pujara lets it go"
"another good leave, shortish and a touch wider outside off, left alone. 0 off 34 now."
"good block. Goes wider of the crease, 141 kph, comes back in, defended to mid-on"
"extra bounce again. You can easily leave on length on this surface, but this was wider outside off, which allowed Pujara to lift his hands and let it go"
"good length outside off, climbs up, let go. Still no run for Pujara"
"full delivery, swinging back in, seaming actually. 128 kph, on the pads, hit on the pad is Kohli, the ball rolls to square leg"
"a tad short and wide, Kohli watches it go by, 128 kph. Think this could be Philander's last over of the spell"
"well played, shortish delivery around off, nudged away towards square leg. Got on top of the bounce"
"good length delivery, on off, 125 kph, not extravagant seam movement, defended back. Right behind the line"
"full delivery, some seam movement back in, left alone, a good confident stride from Kohli"
"his seventh maiden in eight overs. A full delivery outside off, Kohli gets forward and defends"
"good length outside off, 136 kph, moving away, Pujara plays the line and allows himself to be beaten"
"a full delivery on the fourth-stump channel, 141 kph. Pujara gets a thick outside edge which rolls to gully. Nice, soft hands"
"140 kph, edged but short of gully again. Full delivery on off, the ball seams away, a thick outside edge goes down but to gully's left. A dive saves runs"
"full and wide from Rabada, 141 kph, let go again. 0 off 41"
"another good leave, 141 kph, good length, coming back in, Pujara watchfully lets it go. If there is a good ball, and a wicket taken, India have gone nowhere"
"139 kph, full delivery outside off, pitches and seams away, lets it go. He played the line there"
"good length delivery outside off, defended by Kohli. Watchful. No seam movement"
"de Kock dives away to his left to save three byes. Full but well down leg, de Kock dives away. Could have been a wide actually, a Test wide. Started his inswinger too straight"
"full delivery outside off, left alone. No intent to score yet."
"good length on middle and leg, 134 kph, off the thigh pad down to fine leg. Pujara trundles across, hoping the umpire misses it. But the leg bye signal comes out. Still on 0. A wry smile"
"gets forward does Kohli, looking to drive but the ball holds its line and beats Kohli's drive. At least, there's some confidence in the stroke"
"strays down leg, 138 kph, another leg bye. Moves back in, takes a bit of the trouser maybe. Kohli beaten for pace. De Kock dives to his left, but can't hold on cleanly"
"140 kph, that's a nice stroke. Full delivery on the pads, Kohli gets forward, but not so much that the pad becomes a hindrance, worked through midwicket"
"140 kph, full and wide, some seam movement away, left alone. Wonder if it's worth a bouncer to Kohli, just to push him back further"
"139 kph, full delivery outside off, Kohli gets forward and drives wide of mid-off, but the fielder fields"
"on a length down leg, Kohli beaten for pace as he misses a flick, struck on the thigh pad. A bit late on the stroke"
"141 kph, full delivery outside off, nice soft hands as Kohli looks to defend. Well short of AB at third slip"
"on the pads again, 140 kph, clipped through midwicket for a couple. A slow outfield prevents two more."

"a full delivery outside off, nice soft hands as he defends"
"full and straight, 138 kph, beaten on the inside edge, <strong>a bit of an appeal</strong> from South Africa. Hit both pads, first the front, and then onto the back. That could not have been going over. Waiting for HawkEye. Three reds on HawkEye, <b>a review would have had Pujara</b>"
"comes back in, hits Pujara on the body. Good length delivery, moving in. Whacked. 49 now"
"there it is. <strong>A 50-ball 0 from Pujara.</strong> Full delivery outside off, defended"
"on the pads and a delectable clip to short midwicket, diving to his right. He has played really well, but hasn't found one gap in 51 balls"
"<b>dropped by Philander</b>. A nicely-directed bouncer on off, Kohli pulls but he is too quick through thge ball. He was waiting for that, all he can do is toe-end it away to Philander at wide mid-off. He gets across, dives but the ball somehow evades him. Rabada cannot believe it, Kohli isn't sure how he was so early through it. Massive moment in the gap, if there was one fielder Kohli wanted that to go to"

"nice and full, Kohli gets forward and defends it into the off side"
"lovely stroke this time, full again, but a tad wider outside off. Kohli gets across and slices a cover drive wide of cover point. Terrific timing"

"yikes, that's friendly. 120 kph loosener on the pads, ask Pujara where he would have wanted it, flicked away through square leg. <b>Famine, and now feast</b> for Pujara"

"a thick inside edge, that's a better line, 121 kph, full, zoning in on off and middle, a thick inside edge rolls away down to fine leg"
"inside-edged onto the pad, 136 kph, in that corridor just outside off. Kohli looks to play, then decides to leave and then does neither, the bat is withdrawing as the ball hits it, into the pad"
"full delivery outside off, hit away to mid-on, not too confident against Ngidi, not sure which way the ball is moving"
"133 kph, good length delivery, or slightly shorter than that, defended into the off side, in front of his eyes, to where silly point would have been. Kohli wants one, but Pujara does not"
"136 kph, full delivery outside off, a thick inside edge to square leg. Well bowled from Ngidi"
"134 kph, full delivery, but Kohli misreads the length, goes back to one he should have been full to. Plays it into the off side tentatively"
"134 kph, a full delivery on middle and leg, Kohli is too early through his flick hit back to the bowler"
"129 kph, full delivery outside off, coming back in, played into the leg side"
"on the pads again but the field is placed well, 127 kph, worked away comfortably to a backward-ish square leg, who mini-fumbles, allowing one. Phehlukwayo has to find his lines quickly"
"128 kph, shortish delivery on middle and leg, clipped to square leg. Not enough oomph yet from Phehlukwayo"
"short, wide and smashed. Poor bowling. can't bowl there, Kohli goes back and carves a cut through point. No one there, so even of it's in the air, it's fine."
too straight this time. The sun is out and a bowler is struggling. India have earned this. Worked easily to square leg
"much better, 130 kph, good length around off, defended away into the leg side"
"good leave, shortish outside off, 133 kph, some extra climb, Pujara watches it go by"
"nice channel from Ngidi, 138 kph, full around off, worked into the leg side, to midwicket. As diligent as you would find currently from Pujara"
"seam movement back in, 137 kph, short delivery, coming back in. Pujara improvises a checked dab at the last instance. Did not expect as much lateral movement as that."
"a tad short, around off, 138 kph, defended quietly into the off side. Watchful, playing it under his eyes"
"wider, 137 kph, short, left alone"
"<strong>whacked on the midriff</strong>. Good length delivery, coming back in, moves back and beats Pujara on the inside edge. He has worn several today"
"128 kph, strays down leg, Kohli a tad late on the flick, struck on the pad. Still inconsistent"
"128 kph, guess he's bowling to the field, but it's too easy. Full and straight, on middle and leg, worked away to square leg"
"better line, 128 kph, full and bringing it back in, Kohli looks to hit it through mid-off, but the ball skews off the inside half, to mid-on"
"good stop from Phehlukwayo. Overpitched on off, Kohli nails his straight drive back to the bowler, who sticks out his left boot to stop four. Keeps the pressure on"

"full and moving back in, 125 kph, nudged to midwicket and that <strong>will be lunch on day 1</strong>"
"allows the shortish delivery to come to him and nudges it to midwicket. Playing late, playing close to his body."
"<b>ooooh</b>, he is drawn to push at a good length ball that seams away off the pitch. Very very determined batting in the first session. Second ball after the break, he plays a shot he wouldn't like"
there we go - picks the line to be outside off and avoids it with comfort
"<b>darts away</b> and Pujara, by virtue of understanding that this isn't threatening his stumps, is more than happy to hang back and leave. Regardless of the slip cordon's goading."
"blocks, gingerly, and gets an inside edge to long leg. Few batsmen can look comfortable on this pitch, against a nagginly accurate bowler like Philander. Pujara does his best, not pushing his hands in front of his body, and not following the movement of the ball off the pitch"
"good length and outside off, Kohli lets it go"
"good length and outside off, Pujara watches it sail past"
"teaser, pitched up, outside off, gets cat-calls from behind the stumps after Pujara lets it go. There's plenty still for the fast bowlers to work with."
<b>struck on the top glove</b> as a delivery <i>just</i> short of a length that he tries to defend off the front foot rears up at him
"plays from deep in his crease, getting squared up by the seam movement away. But he counters all that by using soft hands and pinches a single to cover"
"<b>is that beaten?</b>. Perhaps. But Kohli does make sure not to push hard at the ball. The away seamer, pitched short of a length, goes by harmlessly to the wicketkeeper"
"drills it through extra cover! Sublime shot from the India captain. His feet are moving, he's jiving. He's loving the opportunity to master these conditions."
"short of a length and outside off, Pujara ignores it like a Monday morning alarm"
"hammers it to the point boundary! These may well be his first runs off Philander (actually, he got a single earlier). Nevertheless, it's emphatic. A short and wide delivery that is cut with ferocious power"
"again, through cover this time! Philander drops it short and wide and Pujara clubs it away. Reward for all that restraint earlier."
lunges forward to a full delivery at off stump and defends well
"good length ball on off stump, Pujara covers it well enough. Inside edge onto pad"
"takes care to play close to his body, watches for the movement and plays with it, angling the bat to point. Delicious stuff."
"fullish on off stump, carefully blocks"
"soft hands holding the bat face down, allowing the good length ball to smash into it and then die by his feet."
"goes short, and a shade outside off, Kohli drops his wrists and lets it go"
"that's gone so wide it should have been held by first slip! Kohli leaves, and Morkel walks back grumbling to himself about his wrist position"
"goes for the bouncer, which hits the deck and seams away. Kohli is happy to weather these without playing shots."
"<b>past second slip</b>! He fishes at a rising delivery outside off, but manages to roll his wrists just enough that the ball is sent wide of the catchers behind the stumps"
"he's set up to defend the ball on off stump, but instead gets hit in the gut because Philander makes it move in off the seam. #Ouch"
"he sets himself up for a forward defensive, but the good length ball spurns the advance of the bat. <b>So much seam movement away from the bat</b>"
"defends gently the very full delivery on off stump, and it goes to short leg. Pujara, since he is batting out of his crease, has to rush back in"
pats a shortish delivery to point
a sign saying 'mind the outside edge' may well be attached to this good length ball sashaying through to the keeper. Pujara shows it scant interest
<b>lovely ball</b>! It's the one an errant batsman will cover drive and nick off. But Pujara plays inside the line and probably has let it go
"<b>dropped</b> by second slip! De Villiers the man looking at his fingers after the ball slips through. It's a terrible ball - so very wide outside off - and Kohli sees runs on it. He goes for the cut. Executes it badly. Goes off the bottom edge. But when you see a full blooded shot like that in the slips, your reflexes spur into action. De Villiers goes for the catch a touch too early. It comes a little later than he expects."
"short of a length and outside off, Kohli goes back to ignoring them"
stands tall and sticks his bat up the air like he just don't care
"<b>beats him</b> but he doesn't care. He's flashing a grin at the bowler, saying until you get me, I'm here to stay. Meanwhile, mean Morne is getting in rhythm. Hits the deck, gets it to move off the seam"
"short of a length and outside off, Kohli doesn't bother with it"
<b>too good</b>! Feet on leg stump. Hands pushing away from the body. Kohli plays a very awkward defensive punch to a ball outside off and meant to bounce over his stumps. The shot that gets him nicking off.
"he's come out to bat with a gizmo on his front foot that shocks him every time it strays too far forward. Or he must have at least, considering how he's clinging to his crease and defending right underneath his eyes. Pujara, heavily invested in survival"
"good length in line with off stump, keeps it out"
"'aw, Vernie' says someone in the cordon as a fuller delivery strays so far wide Pujara would more likely have cooked and eaten that ball more than he would have played at it"
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go"
"good length, pitching on fifth or sixth stump, and darting away off the seam. Pujara is in on the trick and lets it go"
"smacks it down to the long-on boundary! He does this so well. Draws the bowler to change his line and bowl at him, straight at him so he can use his wrists. On this pitch though, he prefers playing the half-volley down the ground"
"too full and Kohli pastes it to the long-off boundary. This shot is simplicity itself, a solid stride forward and a full face presented."
"pitches it up again does Morne, and Kohli blocks with that doggedly straight bat"
judges the shortish delivery to be outside off and makes sure he doesn't have to do much further than that
"<b>inside edge</b> and away it goes to long leg! That's poor reward for good bowling. He's been driven down the  ground on a pitch where he isn't meant to leak runs. It could easily have made Morkel pull his length back. But he continues looking for the good length. And this ball curls in off the seam, late enough that Kohli is uncertain with his shot. He's not had to endure that too often this innings."
good length ball straying about a pincode too far outside off
pushes at a length ball outside off through cover
"bat close to body, hands holding it as gently as they would a babe. Morkel's full delivery looking for the base of off stump is sent dawdling to point"
just short of a good length - but the line is still too wide and Kohli is in no mood to entertain these frivolous things
they're searching for that airy-fairy cover drive from Kohli. But he doesn't want to be sucked in to making that mistake again
defends a good length ball on off stump
"<b>pings off the shoulder of the bat</b> to gully! This had no business bouncing so high. Kohli sees a fuller length and he lunges at the ball, as he has been doing all innings. Suddenly, he sees it rearing up and has to adjust his hands. Softens the way they grip the bat and ensures he isn't caught in the cordon"
"<B>bouncer</b> and it's a fierce one! It's angled into the right-hander, not banged in that way a batsman has early warning. Hits the deck and seams in further as well. Good on Kohli to drop his wrists and sway out of the line"
"smacks the follow up delivery through cover. Kohli's motoring! And  this shot epitomises the way he's approached the innings. He's forgotten the balls that have caused him trouble and the moment the full one comes, he gets a good stride going and whacks it"

"plays the original line of the ball, and watches the good length ball seam away past his outside edge. Gritty batting."

"gets up off his toes and blunts a short one, rising up towards his chest, to point. Determined batting."

"back of a length and outside off, Pujara lets it pass"
"a short delivery down leg, 141 kph, attacking his shoulder. Kohli looks to pull, but the ball goes past his pull. Was a tad late on the shot."
"play that! 141 kph, Rabada goes wide of the crease, pitches outside off and the ball moves away, a hint of away movement. <strong>Beaten on the outside edge</strong>."
"<strong>fifty for Kohli</strong>. Sublime shot to get there, a touch short on middle and leg, sits up for one of the most in-form batsmen in the world. Gets over the bounce, keeps it down and pulls through square leg. Sensational ball-striking"

"a tad short, and wide outside off, 135 kph. Kohli lets it go through to the keeper"
"edged and taken this time. AB de Villiers somehow takes it, at third slip. A tad overpitched outside off, Kohli sees a run-scoring opportunity and drives, but the ball moves away ever so late. He moved wider of the crease, and found just enough lateral movement to find the outside edge. It flies to third slip, where de Villiers has not seen it. And the ball is flying to him at an awkward height - go reverse cupped or hands down. In the end, he does neither but takes it. Excellent captaincy from du Plessis, against Kohli in fine form, it could have been so easy to push the third slip away to a defensive position, but he had the third slip with lots of lateral movement on this surface."

"a good length delivery but too wide outside off, easily left alone. A graft for India"
"ooh yes, 134 kph, this is the kind of pitch that will often produce this, full delivery outside off, pitches and leaves Rahane as he tries to defend. No need to play at those if you're looking to just defend"
"a terrific leave. Short outside off, climbing, but Rahane lifts his hands and lets the ball go"
"137 kph, goes full around off, inside-halved through midwicket for a single. That will keep happening in this Test, it's an indicator of seam movement"
"good length and too wide outside off, lets it go"

"ooh wow, <strong>that kept moving away</strong>, in the air, it's around off, but the ball moves away and beats the bat. Felt he had to play even though he didn't. Superb bowling"
"good adjustment. Knows he is moving it away, on a length. Left on line or length or both, take your pick"
"edged and gone! Philander strikes. Rahane fails. The umpire wants to check for the no-ball. <b>Philander has overstepped?</b> It seems like it. And called. Marginal call, can't see those being called by the umpire because there was a centimetre in it. Good length delivery outside off, the ball moves away. It looked like Rahane was withdrawing his bat, bailing out on a defensive shot, but too late. Undone by that lateral movement again."
"a more confident leave this time, too wide outside off"

"too wide again, short, left alone, 131 kph"
"again, flawed execution of an offensive stroke. He deserved a boundary because of his patience, but not where he wanted. Short and wide outside off, he looks to get on top of the bounce and cut but gets a thick leading edge which flies over the cordon. A tad fortuitous, but earned luck"

"quick on the pull but finds the fielder, short outside off, gets on top of the pull, hit to square leg"
"136 kph, full on leg, and Rahane is given! He decides to review, does Rahane. The no-ball check is fine, is it sliding down? The only way Rahane gets away with this is if it's missing leg stump completely. It is not. Clipping the side of leg stump and the umpire's call stands. Kohli is bemused, not entirely sure why. It was right in the slot for a flick, one of the more productive areas for Rahane, but he just plain misses it. The ball may have moved further too. That's more not out than out, but not a bad decision because if the pad wasn't there, it would have clipped the leg stump."

moves across to get in position to cut a very wide delivery outside off to deep point
"the edge! The Pujara edge! It exists! His gameplan has been to play with soft hands, and the original line.

Haydens down the pitch again and defends the wide delivery outside off
"too wide to draw the batsman into a shot, even if he is going around the wicket to do just that"
"caught behind! He goes for the cut - there's just a tiny bit of room, he takes the shot on. It's one of his favourites, but he doesn't account for Morkel's ability to extract bounce, even from helpless pitches.

"<b>top edge and it's gone straight up</b> and de Kock pulls off another stunner! He runs halfway to the boundary. Running back, as well, looking over his shoulder. The ball swirls in the air, veering to the right. De Kock adjusts his bearing, reaches out and takes it superbly. Pandya's probably going to get a little flak for the shot he's played - a vicious pull when he has no room to free the arms - but with only the tail left, he probably felt he had to get as many runs as quickly as possible."

"shortish and outside off, slices it to Rabada at point. Sheesh, there's no escaping these fast bowlers."
"fends at a short ball aimed at his throat, and then blinks looking around with no idea where it's gone to. The top edge lands safely somewhere to the left of an imaginary silly point"
"is that a catch? Nope. A short third man placed strategically for the awkward fend. But this is more a top edge off the cut. De Bryun, the sub fielder, backtracks but can't make quick enough ground for it to be a legitimate chance"

"full and outside off, Shami thinks about a big heave, but then checks himself."
"good length, outside off, plenty of seam away from the right-hander who stands idly as it goes by"
"<b>doesn't carry to mid-on</b>. Shami spots a full one in his arc, goes after it with all his might, but luckily for him, he hasn't got enough on it. Makes contact with the higher part of the bat"
"back of a length and outside off, blocks towards point"
taken at mid-off this time! Shami swings. He loses the grip of his bat as he swings. And the ball goes off the toe end offering a simple grab to Rabada

"a wide yorker outside off, 133 kph, dabbed to point."

"a 127 kph outswinger that jags away off the pitch. Not sure how to play these. Full and wide, moving away, Bhuvneshwar is comfortably beaten. Lulled into a drive"
"<b>another outswinger that beats the bat</b>. A tad wider outside off so Bhuvneshwar isn't in much trouble, he flirts but the ball doesn't kiss the edge"
"BAT ON BALL! Full and straight, the one that does not move, comfortably defended to mid-on. Well played"
"and again. 130 kph, it's full, it's wide and it keeps moving away again. This is special bowling, <strong>even legbreaks don't turn this much</strong>. Beaten as he looks to drive again"
"that over may be deemed just too good. What you need to get the edge is good. Full and wide again, this time Bhuvneshwar over-extends his reach, looking to make contact, hit back to the bowler."
"back of a length, actually I don't know what length that is, considering both these players are incredibly tall. Either way, it seams away and beats Ishant on the outside edge, near his hip, so you decide"
"full and straight, definitely full there, 135 kph, a thick leading edge into the off side, towards cover"
"back of a length outside off, a waft and another play and miss."
"goes full and wide outside off, Ishant drives and is nowhere near the ball, 131 kph, beats Ishant"
"chipped to short mid-on, 136 kph, full and straight. Ishant is neither sure of pace or movement, so his hands are hard through the line, but not good enough timing for it to carry"

"good length delivery outside off, 131 kph, left alone"
"shortish length, drifts down leg for an ODI wide"
"nicely played from Bhuvneshwar, checks a drive into the cover region. Calls 'two, two, two' and gets them easily. Don't think Philander will mind"
"this one doesn't move, 128 kph, on a length around off, blocked. That's why Philander is so dangerous, varying levels of movement"
"127 kph, on a length around off, a thick inside edge into the pad as Bhuvneshwar tries to stab a ball to point"
"taken! Rabada's second for the day. Faf is an exceptional slip fielder, he knows exactly what he has to do. It's full on off, this one doesn't move much, which is why it finds the edge. Philander had been moving it too much. Takes a thick outside edge. It's low to Faf, but he realises it's straight at him, so the third slip fielder can't dive across to his left to intercept it. So he goes forward quickly and takes a quality catch, makes hard catches look really simple."
this one moves too much so it beats Bumrah comfortably on the outside edge
"yaaiiikees. Aleem Dar is unsure of what has happened there, he gives it byes. <b>But Faf reviews</b>. It pitched well outside off, and cut back like it would on a fifth day WACA pitch, had to hit a crack or deviated off the seam. Ashwin does not turn it that much on a rank turner. It did clip the side of Bumrah's thigh pad, and go away to the fine leg boundary. It's sliding way down leg though. The decision is changed to leg byes."

"looking to send this back to SuperSport Park. On a length, on middle and leg, a front leg is cleared but a wild swing is hit into the front pad"
"goes short, 124 kph, and a tad wide. Bhuvneshwar misses a waft. Rightly, there is no gully because Bhuvneshwar isn't languidly driving, he is violently bashing, which means the ball will go further"
"nicely done, good length outside off, 127 kph, cut to third man"
"moving too much for a No. 11. Very full around off, pitches and moves away to beat the bat"
"shortish length outside off, 140 kph, Rabada does not move it as much as Philander. Bhuvneshwar is closer, but still beaten on the outside edge"
"full delivery around off, 136 kph, looking for the stumps, defended"
"back of a length down leg, 137 kph, worked away to square leg. Run-scoring not easy at all"

"chippety chip over cover, full outside off, through the shot early, hard hands. <b>Juuuuust over cover</b>"
"<strong>and they steal a bye in a Test!</strong> Ah, if you ever wondered what T20s have brought to Tests, it certainly wasn't this. Full and wide, Bhuvneshwar gets himself into an awkward tangle, misses. But Bumrah calls his partner through. They somehow make it. Even de Kock did not expect that"
"on a length, straight. Played away awkwardly into the leg side"
"smashed for four. He's on 29 now. Good length outside off, anticipated that length with Ngidi's height, so he stayed back and Federer-ed that through mid--off for four."
"135 kph, fuller this time outside off, pushed to deep cover but refuses the run"
"back of a length down leg, nudged down to fine leg, 128 kph. Still no run."
"gets away with it, short delivery on middle, clever change in length, the bouncer, Bhuvneshwar pulls out of the shot, but gets bat on it as the periscope hangs up, one to fine leg"
"full and wide, a poor last ball. Easily left alone"
"nicely-directed bouncer, aimed at the neck. Bhuvneshwar gets on top of the bounce to defend. Extremely well played"
"dug in again, around middle and leg, gets underneath it"
"another short delivery outside off, this is slightly wider outside off so he sways, not ducks. Very impressive innings"
"136 kph, caught at wide mid-on and India's innings is shut out for 187. A bouncer around middle and leg, Bhuvneshwar can't time his pull, is very late on the stroke. So the timing is bad, chipped to Phehlukwayo, who runs to his right and takes a good catch!"
"good start from Elgar, off and running. On a length outside off, defended into the cover region, in front of point and calls for a single. Quality start"
"<strong>lovely bowling</strong>, pitches around off and gets the ball to jag away. A terrific outswinger, beaten on the outside edge"
"full and wide, an outswinger that starts too wide, left alone this time. The right length, but the line too wide"

"back of a length around off, 139 kph, played to point"
"eeks, does not move, 138 kph, good length delivery on middle and leg, the ball moves back and hits Elgar on the midriff. Even Pujara wore a few"
"good length delivery around off, 142 kph, Elgar brings his bottom hand down, closes the bat face and works the ball into the leg side"
maiden! Short delivery but drifts down leg for an ODI wide. No bat on it from Elgar
"confident leave, 131 kph, full outside off, left alone well. Nice bowling too"
"didn't need to play at that, a poor shot actually. Back of a length, the ball pitches and moves away, a waft with bat well away from pad, hit to point easily enough"
"edged and gone. Bhuvneshwar strikes early. He didn't need to play at the previous one, he didn't need to play at this. Back of a length outside off, Markram stays tall, looking to defend the ball. Against a new ball, on a seaming pitch, I see no reason why Markram had to play at that, he did, the ball moves away and takes the outside edge. Well bowled, but bad shot."
"full delivery, moves away extravagantly. Left alone. Lots of movement"
"135 kph, seams back in like a legbreak from around the wicket. Rabada is not expecting that, swung back in prodigiously, hits Rabada on the pad in front of middle and leg. <strong>A bit high to concern</strong> India with the review"
"the other one, pitches outside off and moves away, leaves Rabada's bat hanging. Wow, excellent over"
"strays down leg this time, 140 kph, again. Wasting valuable deliveries here. Has to get his line right."
"much better, short of a length outside off, 141 kph, Elgar leaves watchfully"
"wow, hit on the hand. Like Pujara, even Elgar is wearing a few. This one jags back in from outside off, beats Elgar on the inside edge and <b>whacks him on the elbow.</b> That's a very painful blow. He needs some treatment, and more importantly, time."
"nicely pushed from Elgar, a tad too full, pushed away through mid-on for a couple. Not hit, not punched, just placed"
"short down leg, 142 kph, worked away down to fine leg for a single. His line has just not been that great"
"dug in short around off, a wasted delivery, Rabada is easily underneath that"
"full and wide outside off, 130 kph, moves away, left alone."
"whew, 134 kph, how does one play that? Pitched up, full outside off, the ball moves away and beats the bat. There's no way any batsman is getting close to that, unless he is very very good, or very very bad."
"full delivery around off, pitches, and moves away to beat the outside edge. Struck on the back pad."
"135 kph, full and wide outside off, sliced to point. His ability to move the ball both ways forces Elgar to play"
"oh another lovely delivery, back of a length outside off, pitches and moves away, no chance for Elgar, beaten by a considerable distance again"
"a full delivery outside off, 129 kph, tapped towards point. Elgar has not done enough in that over to ensure it's the last. He tried, but unsuccessful."
"141 kph, good length on middle and off, much better line, a bit of pad on that towards gully"
"back of a length delivery outside off, 140 kph, dabbed to gully. Watchfully played, better line from Bumrah"
"back of a length and wide outside off, 141 kph, no stroke"
"full delivery on off, a bit of seam movement, defended watchfully, excellent defensive technique"
"full and wide outside off, 143 kph, blocked back. Elgar did not move an inch, gloves off with his legs crossed."
"142 kph, fantastic end from Bumrah. Good length delivery outside off, the ball pitches and moves back in. Rabada watchfully lets that one go."
"good stuff. He puts the ball on a good length, angles it across the left-hander. Elgar is equally switched on, leaving the ball"
"<b>squares him up</b> as Bhuvneshwar attempts the magic ball, pitching outside leg and seaming towards the slips"
"<b>beats him</b> but the ball doesn't quite carry through at the usual height to the keeper. Bhuvi goes around the wicket, hoping to draw the left-hander into playing at stuff he shouldn't"
"<b>past the edge again</b>, although it half seems like Elgar pulls the bat inside the line of a back of a length delivery that darts away off the pitch"
"<b>emphatically beaten</b> that time with Bhuvi pitching it on off stump, the angle demanding Elgar to attempt a shot and the seam movement away telling him how dare he do such a thing."
"<b>ends the over with a peach</b>. Splendid stuff from Bhuvi, he even brings the batsman forward this time, searching for the ball, which skips past the outside edge, seaming away off the pitch"
"poor ball, about a foot wide of leg stump. That's the equivalent of waking up at noon for a meeting at 9 am"
gently defused to the left of short leg as Ishant tries to bang it in against the nightwatchman
"plays it late, uses soft hands, and manages to block a full delivery on off stump. Elgar is happy to camp back in his crease to have extra time to deal with the seam"
"<b>he's utterly uncomfortable</B> against this back of a length delivery that veers away like a legbreak. At 130 kph. Totally squared up on the back foot as he sends a leading edge to third slip, on the bounce though"
"good leave! Ishant doesn't normally bring the ball into the left-hander. If Elgar remembers that, he can more often than not leave balls on middle and off."
<b>beaten</B> as he follows the seam movement away off the pitch. A touch too short to claim the edge. Still ripping to watch.
picks the line to be outside off and steadfastly ignores it
"the inswinger this time - and it's movement through the air, the rarer kind in this Test - and Rabada just about gets a little bat on it for a single through midwicket"
"fullish in length, but a touch too wide to draw Elgar into a shot"
"the pitch still hasn't quickened up, which is useful for the batsman. Like here, Elgar is squared up by a short ball, but he adjusts with his hands and blunts it by his feet"
<b>beauty</B>! You'll have to be in form to even nick those. The angle brings the ball into the left-hander. The length threatens the stumps. Elgar has to play. And he's made to look silly by the prodigious seam movement again
"fullish on off stump, Elgar slides it down to the cordon"
holding a bat in hand here is about as useful as having a yellow pages at home. A very full delivery on off stump somehow pitches just far enough from the bat to seam past the edge. Sheesh
<b>how do you play that?!</b> It pitches outside leg. It snakes away. It goes right over middle and off. Kagiso Rabada might well have sent a cardboard cut out of himself

"very full on off stump and Elgar brings the bat down from gully, essentially slicing the ball down the pitch"
"<b>vicious seam</b> into the left-hander, and it hits Elgar even before he is ready with a shot. Thuds into the upper right thigh and wanders out to fine leg."
back over the wicket and another ball that seams in hits a left hander high on the right thigh. The score ticks over again
"<b>past third slip</b>! In an effort to bring the bat down quickly enough to protect his off stump, Rabada has to worry about getting caught in the cordon. Luckily for him, the edge is thick enough to beat the man to his left"
"good length, swinging away, seaming further, Rabada picks all that and leaves it well"
"he's drawn into half a shot against a ball pitching on a good length outside leg and darting away into Parthiv's gloves, like he's a sneaky little puppetmaster"
"<b>just too much movement to catch the edge</b>, as is often the case when a bowler pitches short on a helpful pitch. The line is fine though, on middle, forcing the batsman to take action."
"'oooh, that's it boy,' comes the yelp from the cordon as Ishant pitches it up, and dangles it wide. Rabada goes for the gung-ho cover drive and is <b>beaten soundly</b>"
"<b>brave leave</b>. From around the wicket, Ishant attacks the stumps, hitting a good length. But Rabada, after shuffling across to off, lets it go past his eyeline"
"over the wicket for <b>a ripper</b>. It skips past the splice of the bat, and the glove, and goes through to the keeper. Sensational bowling"
<b>beaten again</b>. A full length. Pitching outside leg. Seaming ferociously. Too much for Elgar to deal with
<b>outstanding bowling</b>! India have been searching for this ball all morning. The one that pitches in line with leg stump. The one that draws the left-hander forward. The one that seams away just enough to snatch the edge through to the keeper. Can't do much about that except shake your head and walk off.
"<b>oooh, a yorker first up</b>. Delicious stuff, and Amla is ready for it, jamming a straight bat down"
a firm push to mid-on as Bhuvneshwar secures substantial movement in the air into the right-hander
"too wide outside off, and Bhuvi knows it. Aborts his followthrough midway and turns around in disappointment"
"ouch. <B>Beats him by half a foot</b>! Ishant pitches it up, in the 4 to 6 m mark, and even from there he gets so much movement that the defensive shot is of no use"
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
"full and outside off, he goes for a smack through mid-off and is <b>beaten by what is essentially a fast offbreak</b>."
"<b>past the edge again</b> with Rabada bringing down a straight bat, playing the angle, or for the ball to seam in. That's good technique on this pitch"
"<b>lovely Ishy, lovely Ishy</b> sounds the call from the slips as he goes full and outside off and skips past the edge again. Rabada can't get anything on the drive again"
"good length, outside off, lets it go"
"he shuffles across outside off and once the ball is then outside the eyeline, he doesn't need to play"
"a lot fuller this time and a touch closer to off stump as well. Makes Amla play, and he does so with soft hands. As a result, the outside edge scurries past gully"
"<b>unplayable</b>. 'This batting won't last long,' yell India's slip cordon as they relish watching a full length delivery veer away from the defensive bat and hurry on in their direction"
"full on middle and off, Rabada is careful not to push with his hands and so defends well"
"searches for the ball, because it pitches on leg stump, but it wanders past the outside edge anyway. Wild seam movement."
<b>brings it back in this time</b> but it's just a touch too wide. Bhuvi is on song. He's been setting this delivery up for ages. Beating Rabada's outside edge. Tempting the thought that he should leave balls that are on off stump. This is full and outside off. The batsman leaves and the ball suddenly darts in.
"<b> big lbw appeal</b> but he's struck outside the line while playing a shot. Amla is taking a massive step across onto off stump, and then he pushes further on his front foot. Ishant's indipper doesn't quite catch him in line. Beats the inside edge though"
"leaps right across again, and trusts his hands to adjust to the inswinger. Nudges it towards midwicket"
<b>has him hopping</b> with a short ball aimed at the body. Amla pulls the bottom hand off and fends it away to long leg.
"brings down a straight bat, but the ball is still angry with it and goes away to the wicketkeeper"
"<b>it's just too good</b>. Ishant is bowling around the wicket. He's hitting a good length, on off stump. The left-hander has to play. And the left-hander is constantly beaten"
"short enough that Rabada can hang back and block, and meet it off the middle!"
"good length, about a set of stumps outside off because of that exaggerated shuffle across from Amla. After all that effort though, the batsman only leaves"
"standing out of his crease, walking across his stumps, using his hands to adjust to the seam movement away. Amla's shenanigans seems to be making Bhuvi bowl shorter than usual"
"there, he's back to his staple length, fullish and outside off. Amla lets it go"
"full and outside off, Amla drills it to mid-off"
"good length and outside off, no shot"
"squares him up, but the good thing there is Amla defends close to the body and ensures the leading edge goes towards gully on the bounce"
works a back of a length delivery on the pads - it hits the very splice of the bat - uppishly through midwicket
<b>beats him</b> with Amla fishing for a short ball well outside off. Not the best way to play on this pitch
that's better. The ball is too far wide outside off and as a result Amla says it doesn't deserve his attention
"pulls his bat inside the line after moving across, so much that he's outside off stump. The ball sails past him"
"<b>ripper</b>! He is quick off the pitch - and this pitch has quickened up. As a result, if he can pitch it up, he's going to get sharp movement, as he does here, to beat Amla's defensive prod"
steps forward to block but the good length ball outside off straightens past the edge
"poor line as he starts around the wicket, bangs it in short and wanders harmlessly down the leg side. Good take from Parthiv, diving full length."
<B>beaten</b> as a short of a length delivery straightens away from the angle
"that's a gift. It's too short. It's slanted so far down leg that Rabada going for a pull is not able to get even the slightest bit of bat on it. For another measure of how far off the mark Shami is, the umpire calls it wide"
too short again as Rabada has the time he needs to get in line with the ball on middle
firm defence again as Rabada gets the chance to play off the back foot
"looks for the flick off the pads, and he manages to do that, even if it comes right off the pad"
"too short, too wide, no trouble for the batsman. Shami off the mark at the start of a spell yet again"
"good length, outside off, Rabada leaves on the angle of the ball going across him"
shuffles in line with off stump and then trusts the ball to go past off stump. Bumrah from over the wicket needs to pitch a little closer to leg to draw a shot
<b>good leave</b>! He trusts the bounce here. He hopes the ball won't jag back in. And he lets through a good length ball about a whisker outside off
<b>thuds into his back thigh</b> as Bumrah manages to get a back of a length delivery to snake back into the left-hander from off stump
<b>that's sublime</b>. He's been so very disciplined against balls searching for the outside edge. That makes the bowler attack in a different way. Bumrah strays on the pads and Rabada flicks him away like a mosquito flying too close to his hear
blunts it down towards short leg and heads off to enjoy a well deserved drink.
<b>darts past the edge</b> as Amla shuffles across and puts himself into a position where he has to play a ball he could easily have left alone
"short, wide, and the seam movement takes it towards first slip. Umpire Gould rightly penalises it"
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
"<b>super shot</b>, off his hips and away it scurries towards the square leg boundary. Shami tries to correct his line and in that effort goes too straight. If not for Bumrah's dive after running a good way to his left from long leg, it would have been four"
"goes full, looking for lbw, and though the ball swings past the blade and hits the pads, it would have gone down leg"
"good length and outside off, lets it go"
"<b>delicious ball</B>, pitching outside leg and laughing past the squared up batsman and a useless bat. It could've been more threatening off a fuller length though"
"looks to drag a back of a length delivery, rising awkwardly on him, through square leg. But the ball takes the top edge over the slip cordon. Odd shot from Amla"
a scattered appeal for lbw as Amla walks across outside off and shoulders arms. Wouldn't have come in enough to hit the stumps
nudges a back of a length ball to midwicket
"outside edge as Amla gets in line with a good length ball outside off. Considering he's playing close to the body, the ball goes down to gully"
"he's going to flick a short delivery through midwicket, but finds himself too early into the shot. Little leading edge down the pitch"
"point is open - it should be open on a pitch like this because bowlers shouldn't be bowling balls that can be hit through there. Bumrah does, banging it in and giving enough width for Amla to punch it through."
"good length and outside off, no shot."
<b>good bowling</b> as he plants a good length ball just outside off. A batsman with less discipline than Rabada would have played at that
"manages to bring his bat down in time to meet a back of a length ball that seams in off the pitch. Rabada, rock solid."
goes for the bouncer and Rabada effortlessly avoids it
that's regal! <b>That's the shot Lara played to win over the world</b>. Fearsome fast bowler charging on a wicket pitch. And he sends him packing with an outrageous square drive. On the up. In the air. Outstanding
"good length ball outside off, no shot"
"back of a length and outside off, Amla lets it pass"
"the moment the ball is within line of even off stump, with Amla moving so far across his stumps to face every ball, it becomes an opportunity to flick. Single to long leg. He's backing his hands to be quick enough to avoid lbws"
"shortish, pitching outside leg and hitting Rabada on the thigh. <b>Beaten for pace</b>"
"<b>short of midwicket</b> as Rabada goes for a pull shot. It's a fair call considering it's a short ball, but Bumrah hustles him for pace again. The ball strikes high on the bat and so there is no timing on the shot"
"shortish on off stump, defends"
"<b>beaten</B> as he pushes at a short ball angled across him. Hmm, is he starting to think his work is done for the day? Getting a bit loose."
"good length and outside off, Amla is delighted to leave it"
"goes wide of the crease for a good length ball a shade outside off. Amla gets across, judges it won't threaten his stumps and so watches it pass"
"batting out of his crease, on this pitch which has plenty of bounce, he doesn't need to worry about lbw. This ball, pitching in line with the stumps, on a good length, seams in and hits him above the knee roll. And there is an inside edge"
leaps up to get on top of the bounce of a short ball outside off and cuts it through vacant point
"bouncer, which Rabada sees early and gets under it safely"
"'yeah, yeah' says Rabada. He is the senior partner after all in this stand. And Amla responds for a quick single to cover. Brilliant"
"<b>great leave</b>. He takes the decision on length - which is short and on this pitch it should sail over the stumps. As it happens, it goes right over off"
goes around the wicket and targets the stumps. Rabada protects them with a straight bat
blocks a shortish delivery on off stump
"<b>strikes him</B> and he buckles for half a second before remembering not to show any weakness to members of his breed. Fast bowlers are a merciless lot. And Bumrah bangs a short ball that cuts in off the seam, takes an inside edge and nearly makes contact above the box"
<b>inside edge</b> down to the keeper. A very quick delivery - 143 kph - finds Rabada wanting.
"<b>we present you, Steven Smith, left-handed</b>! Calm as ice, he shuffles outside off, stays supremely balanced, and whips a full delivery from Bumrah, which would otherwise have threatened the outside edge, away through midwicket. That is awesome!"
"good length, just a shade outside off, Amla is not sure if he wants to play or not. So he covers is bases by using soft hands and angling the bat face down. The ball basically thuds into the outside edge and wanders out to third man"
"a smidge squared up by a full delivery curling away in the air and off the seam. But by playing late and close to his body, he's able to keep the outside edge down and what's more, it goes into a gap at point"
back of a length and outside off. Rabada is drawn into playing at something he needn't and is beaten
"almost lured into a shot again. Bhuvi, from over the wicket, keeps probing, pitching a good length ball outside leg and seeing it dart away to the cordon"
"and now <b>he channels KP</b>! Steps out of his crease against the best bowler of the opposition and hits him over extra cover. Just for added effect, he brings his back leg up and presents his version of the Flamingo"
"back of a length and on the pads, Rabada sends it through midwicket"
"<b>huge lbw shout but umpire Dar says no and so India review</b>. It all starts as a result of a fuller length. There is swing on offer, moving in to Amla, who has walked a massive distance across his stumps and ends up being beaten on the inside edge. He's struck in line with off stump. It could be umpire's call for height and it is! Only kissing the bails."
"back of a length and outside off, Rabada leaves with devastating precision"
probes a fuller length and that brings a false shot from Rabada. Goes searching for it and only when things get really dicey does he realise he shouldn't go through with the on-the-up drive
he's tempted again by a good length ball skirting across him. India's frustration keeps mounting
"pokes, then yanks the bat away from the line of a back of a length delivery headed to the wicketkeper outside off"
"<B>past third slip's left</b> and there's no gully and a genuine outside edge with Rabada drawn into an errant drive, the bat straying so far away from his body gets away with a mistake"
"feels it's up there for the slap through extra cover, but indulges in the shot a little half-heartedly. As a result, the bat face turns in his hand and he mistimes the ball to mid-off"
overpitched and he smokes it through cover. Minimalist as ever. A shuffle across. Half a step forward. An extension of defence. All of that tied in an elegant package
back of a length and too far outside off to make anyone but the wicketkeeper fret
walks across and meets a good length ball outside off with a straight bat. But it hurries off the pitch and takes the inside edge.
"plenty of swing from Bhuvi, but Amla is able to cover it with soft hands and a dead bat"
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go like a wind-up toy"
"short and into the body, Rabada gets inside the line to deflect it fine. Isn't able to, so he has to settle for a single to the right of the keeper"
"<b>strikes him under the ribs</b> and he needs medical attention. Vicious delivery, which probably moves off a crack in the good length area of the pitch. Ishant nails it, with a wobbly seam, and it snarls in at Amla, who is worse off because of that exaggerated shuffle across off stump. His bat has no chance of getting across in time and he takes a pretty painful blow where there is no protection"
"he's leg-glanced a ball on off stump - the kind that's meant to take the outside edge - to long leg. This is Amla's gameplan today. Move across, so much that he exposes all his stumps, and he trusts his hands and eyes to make contact with the straight ball"
one-bounce to the square leg boundary! India are fading when they have no right to. This Test is still live and they can't afford half-volleys on the pads of one of South Africa's gun batsmen
"full on off stump, but Amla is able to nudge it to midwicket because of that huge back and across movement"
"<b>taken at gully</B> and it's a sharp catch too from Rahane, getting his hands up in front of his face and snagging it reverse cup. So Rabada has to go, after exceeding everyone's expectations save perhaps his own, done in by a peach of a ball. Back of a length on leg stump, hurtling away off the seam, squaring up the batsman and taking the edge at the high part of the bat. Standing ovation for the nightwatchman who has blunted 84 deliveries, from the new ball too."
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
ignores the short delivery outside off like they're telemarketers.
"short and down leg, Amla needs to do little but allow the ball through"
"full on middle, Amla manages to avoid a potential lbw situation with a flick through square leg"
gets struck on the body as a short of a length delivery rags in at him sharply
"full on off stump, de Villiers blocks to cover and that's lunch"
"neither of them will come into play with that, short and wide outside off, a loosener. Amla loosens up with a leave"
"good comeback, goes wide of the crease, and gets a good length delivery to seam back in, defended watchfully back"
"134 kph, strays on the pads, full and straight, Amla happy to pick him off all day, worked to deep square leg."
"137 kph, extravagant seam movement. Full and moving back in a lot, so much so that it beats AB's middle and inside edge. Hit on the pad, in front of off. <b>Probably going over the stumps?</b> A massive appeal from India, but they opt not to review. Actually,<b> there are three reds on HawkEye</b>. Kohli's fuming. Shastri has one finger up. AB with the let-off."
"full and moving back in, a thick inside edge onto the body, and then back up the pitch"
"short delivery outside off, moving in, defended into the off side."
full and teasingly outside off. Amla refuses to be sucked in
"keeps it up, but it's a touch too wide to press Amla into action"
"goes wide of the crease, considering he's getting the ball to dart away off the angle off the pitch, but the line isn't quite straight enough yet. Amla is happy to leave, yet again"
"walks right across his stumps, as a result of which Bhuvi shifts his line further outside off, and that in turn lets the batsman off the hook without playing a shot"
"back of a length on fourth stump, Amla rises with it and blocks with such softness that the ball barely leaves the pitch"
"full and swinging away. As pretty as that looks, Amla is standing there, bat raised, looking in no trouble"
"sharp movement into the right-hander, both in the air and off the pitch. De Villiers manages to bunt it to midwicket with a straight bat by moving across his stumps"
"very very wide outside off. Wearing coloured clothing, de Villiers would have swatted that over extra cover. Here, he holds in his power position: feet apart, but braced, bat high in the backlift"
"full and outside off, lets it go like it's chocolate cake and he's on a diet"
"back of a length and outside off, AB watches it and does little else"
"<b>jumps up at AB</b>! The stock delivery from Ishant, angled into the top of off stump, hits the deck, goes off a crack and the batsman coming forward to defend is met with a fright. The ball climbs so steeply that it lobs over the bat, takes the glove and goes to the left of the wicketkeeper"
"short of a length and outside off, less activity from the batsman than my Twitter account."
<b>falls short of second slip</B>. Bhuvi smuggles de Villiers' edge in the corridor of uncertainty. But the batsman does so well to play with soft hands
"short of a length and outside off, no shot"
"soft hands, bat face pointing down, and a delivery that would have been a dot - or better a catch in the slips - becomes a single through the slip cordon. That's AB de Villiers"
"<b>huge appeal for lbw</b> and Bhuvi is absolutely insistent on the review. A good length ball pins Amla fairly high on the pad as he plays the flick, while he is shuffling across. Impact is in front of off stump. He's playing from the crease... Hmm, umpire's call on height again? Yep. Umpire Gould rules it not out. and that's the second time Amla's got away in this way."
"lets the ball do its bit - and considering its being short and outside off, that's generous from AB - and taps it away behind point."
walks right across again and glides a short of a good length delivery towards the vacant point region
goes for the bouncer and Amla ducks under it
"sharp movement in - it started about a set of stumps outside off and ended up at Amla's hip. The batsman, ensuring that he plays late and close to the body, is able to flick it behind square leg"
"that's an iffy waft outside off, AB tempted by the gap at point. <b>Nearly gets out</b> to a short and wide ball."
"a touch fuller but still outside off, AB ignores it"
<b>good leave</b>. It's a tough job to do that against an inswing bowler. But AB pitches his tent on off stump and the moment the ball is outside his eyeline he takes the call to trust his eye and the bounce in the pitch
"back of a length and outside off, AB just watches it dart through to the keeper. All the way. #SwitchedON"
"he's taken guard outside his crease now, and then adds the shuffle to it to kill lbw. Helps that he middles the good length ball on off stump too"
bangs it in his own half and the ball goes past at the height of two Amlas standing on their shoulders
punches a full delivery on off stump to mid-off and rushes back to his crease.
"great hand-eye! Bhuvi is looking for lbw, or bowled, with Amla giving him a sight of leg stump. But he's just so good with those wrists that he flicks the ball away through midwicket"
<b>what a ball</b>! Takes a peach to bowl AB neck and crop! Pshaw. This is swing. And it's devastating swing. The ball starts at about sixth stump. And then hurtles in at middle with a vengeance. AB doesn't get a full stride forward. He brings out a forceful shot down the ground. Even then the ball zips through the defences and middle stump is flattened
"<b>how about that</b>! He sizes up a back of a length delivery to be outside off - and it certainly is - but this time Bhuvi gets violent inward movement off the pitch. And hits Faf on the thigh, while he is leaping up"
"tentative front foot prod and the inswinger takes the edge, sneaks through his legs and gets him off the mark"
"short and outside off, Faf has it easy. He really shouldn't."

<b>more inswing</b> but this looks tame compared to Bhuvi's at the other end. Faf gets forward and blocks in front of off stump.
"tentative defensive push as the batsman is worried about sideways movement. Typically that's when he gets a straight ball, like this one. Inside edge to square leg"
"good length outside off, Amla covers it very well."

"over gully and away to the boundary. Bowling short on this pitch is sabotaging yourself. It's the length that makes Faf play the attacking shot, forcing the ball up and over the cordon. SA bring their 100 up"
"141 kph, comes at du Plessis quicker than he expects and snags the inside edge onto thigh pad."
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
"<b>oh, a ripper</b>! He finally pitches it up and because of all the backswing he gets with his wrist, a ball going in with the angle straightens past the outside edge. Unplayable"

"defends a fullish delivery on off stump which seams away off the pitch. Amla is squared up, but he's still there"
"<b>ohhh, dangerous</b>! Amla tries to defend a good length ball that is wide enough to leave. And the seam movement possibly helps avoid the edge"
"slants it sharply into the right-hander, seeking lbw, but Amla, despite that exaggerated shuffle, manages to get the bat down in time"
"<b>sensational timing</b>. It takes a special batsman to flick to the left of midwicket, essentially playing the shot with a striaghter bat than normal, and still imbue such power in it"
"appeal after appeal after appeal from Bhuvi - he stops just short of going to umpire Gould and yanking his hand up to make the signal. And under such certainty, the umpire relents. <b>Amla though immediately reviews</b>. The good length ball pitching just outside off hits pad first as he tries to defend. But HawkEye reveals that the impact is outside off, and it would be missing as well. Good judgment from Amla, much to the joy of the Wanderers faithful"
steers it away to third man
"back of a length and outside off, doesn't care for it"
"143 kph and he's beaten for pace on the flick. Bumrah's action and the skid he's getting off the pitch - even if he isn't getting sideways movement - is troubling Faf, badly."
pulls the bottom hand off the handle as he blocks a good length ball on off stump
"lets it go and loses his off stump! He stands and stares at the pitch, perhaps wondering why it hasn't made the ball bounce over the wickets. But Bumrah, when he pitches it up, gets balls to skid through and there's that exaggerated angle into the right-hander as well."
"gets off the mark with a leading edge to third man. Squared up, hanging back, doesn't look good."
"there's the yorker on middle at 141 - the one ball that has the highest chance, if executed perfectly to get through this version of Amla. But despite that sensational shuffle that places him outside off stump, he plants a straight bat down around his front pat to protect his castle"
"<b>too good</b>! Honestly, what more can you do but bring down a straight bat when you see a good length pitching on leg stump? How can you reconcile with it beating the outside edge like Warne's ball of the century?"
<b:>again</b>! This one shortish in length and travelling the same bizarre lines. Lands outside leg. Squares de Kock up. Darts past the leading edge to the keeper.
"full on leg stump, de Kock defends gingerly"
goes around the stumps and the full and straight delivery is worked to midwicket
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
"swing into the left-hander, and as a result of which, a ball that starts on the wide line outside off takes the inside edge to midwicket"
makes Amla hop too with that skiddy backswing he puts on the ball. Comes at the batsman just that touch quicker than he expects and the flick shot doesn't work
"<b>sensational</b>! Hits the deck just short of a good length, and with that profound angle into the right hander Amla has to play it. Then the pitch lends a hand, takes the ball past the outside edge"
"'oh ho ho ho ho, you got him there' says someone in the vicinity of the stump mic after Bumrah bowls a middle-stump yorker that Amla only just digs out"
"<b>good leave</b>, trusting the bounce as he sees a short delivery on off stump. He hopes it would carry over and it does"
plays late - so much that he bottom edges the shortish delivery to third slip. On the bounce though. So as you were.
"good length, with the ball thrust across the left-hander. De Kock can't catch up with it."
starts with a short one and Amla hammers it through to the point boundary. Shami looks the weak link in this attack in this form. He needs to recoup.
"fuller delivery a shade outside off, Amla defends ever so carefully"
"'yes, boys, here we go lads,' India cry as <b>Amla nearly runs himself out</b>. He blocks with soft hands, thinking there's a single at point, but Hardik runs to his left from cover and nearly direct hits South Africa's top scorer out"
""
plonks himself way outside off and then defends the good-length ball he has already got in line for
"just back of a length, which is why Amla is able to hang back, use that extra bit of time to get in position and excel with those soft hands"
"143kph, shortish on off stump, de Kock steers it towards gully"
<b>leaves it on length</b> and he does it well. The ball pitches on middle but since it's short de Kock shoulders arms
squeezes out the very full delivery outside off through cover
"angles it across the left-hander, who spots it early and ignores it steadfastly"
"<b>inside edge to long leg</b> as de Kock shapes to punch the ball through cover. Tiny bit of width, but he is into the shot too early"
"goes for the bouncer, and Amla drops his wrists and sinks under it"
short and wide and de Kock will be displeased that he bottom edges to cover
"fuller delivery from around the wicket, de Kock does well to avoid it. Has trouble written all over it"
gets across to protect his stumps and then leaves the ball outside his eyeline. De Kock is battling. Staggering seam movement into the left-hander though. Spooky stuff
"width and de Kock splatters it away to the third man boundary. Comes off the bottom of the blade, because he's still out of form, but those are the kinds of shots he's good at"
"<b>huge appeal for lbw</b> as de Kock moves right across his stumps and plays a leg glance. Umpire gives it runs, India believe it's pad, and so go for <b>the review</b>. It's all about the angle here. Shami is wide of the crease from around the wicket. He catches the batsman on the move with that very full length. Beats the bat, but HawkEye shows it would be missing leg stump. <b>India lose one of their reviews.</b>"
"full and outside off, demanding the de Kock cover drive. He gets the shot out and times it really well too. But since he's out of form, he finds the fielder"
pushes away from his body but makes sure to roll his wrists on top of the ball to keep it down and let it roll past gully
"<b>inside edge to the keeper</b>. De Kock goes for the on-the-up drive and presents a big gap between bat and pad. Bumrah exploits it with just enough help from the pitch, making the ball move against the angle, miss the middle, snag a good chunk of wood through to Parthiv"
"144kph, full on off stump, blocks"
"pulls his bottom hand off the bat as the full, 143 kph delivery thuds into the splice. Good length balls have no business bouncing that high"
"that's outstanding stuff! His captain was being beaten for pace against this very bowler. But in comes Philander, second ball, and he pulls the bouncer meant for his chest away to the square leg boundary."
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go"
"back of a length and outside off, Amla lets it go"
has to get up off his toes to handle a rising delivery on fourth stump
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
"he's squared up by the good length ball seaming away off the pitch, but those soft hands, help him out again. Superb defensive technique, coupled with that shuffle across the stumps"
flashes at a short delivery outside off and is beaten for <b>extra bounce</B>
"<b>fifty on a ferociously difficult pitch to make runs on</B>! Bat up, Hash! Doesn't get there in the best way though, a full delivery, seaming in off the pitch and looking for lbw, defused by virtue of the inside edge"
"plays the angle that Bumrah generates, and so when the ball bites into the pitch and seams away, he is only beaten."
"full and outside off, lets it go"
"good length on off stump, he defends in front of point and pinches a single"
"back of a length on middle, Philander covers it well. But with the ball thudding into the high part of the bat, it appears he has broken it."
ignores a good length ball outside off.
gets forward to defend a 143 kph delivery into the covers for a single. Looking very well organised is Philander. And he's got that stride going just like Kohli in the first innings
punches a back of a length delivery through cover and there's enough power in the shot for two runs
launches it towards the midwicket boundary. Pulls up on the outfield though. Picks up the short ball so well and he is by no means holding back.
brings him forward with a good length ball outside off and Philander defends it so very carefully. Yanks the bottom hand off just in case
"<b>uncertain</b> about whether to play or leave and by the time he's ready, the ball pings off the open face of a dangling bat. Good stuff from Rahane at gully to stop runs"
"good length and outside off, blocks"
lets a rising delivery outside off go - and he is able to do that only because he commits to the shot he wants to play so very very late
gets a shortish delivery to kick up at the batsman and Philander weathers it on the high part of the bat
"swing into the right-hander, and Philander negotiates it by playing close to his body and working it to midwicket"
seems to keep a touch low as a back of a length ball with enough width to cut ends up being bottom edged to cover
"gets the bat down in time to blunt an lbw ball, pitching outside off and darting in off the pitch. Could have pinned him in front of middle if not for that little leg glance"
"walks right across and is surprised by the bounce - where he expects it to hit the middle at knee-height and find runs through midwicket, it rears up, taking the glove and going to the left of the wicketkeeper. Parthiv does his utmost but even after a dive he is nowhere near close to the ball. Amla needs a little treatment for a painful blow on the fingers."
"<b>Off stump, how are you still standing?</b> And Ishant, why aren't you tearing your hair out after a ball like that going for no rewards? Good length, pitches wide outside off, so Philander bravely sets up for the leave. But then it veers back in and only just misses the sticks"
"full and just outside off, blocks"
"positions himself right across on off stump, the back foot even further away. And then brings down a straight bat to nullify the threat"
a firm push to send the full delivery on off stump to mid-off. And now he's inspecting the top of his bat for damages. Needs a new one. Seems like the handle has broken from the blade
nudges a back of a length ball on off stump out to deep square leg - he's only able to do that because of that trigger <s>movement</s> leap
stands opened up on off stump and brings a straight bat down to negate the threat of a fuller delivery
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go"
goes for the cut but the short ball outside off <b>keeps low</b>. This ain't gon be pretty in the second innings.
"full and curling into the right-hander, Philander does well to tickle it to midwicket"
"drives through cover for a couple. It's a risky shot, playing on the up, but he just has such a good feel for the ball. Even in Cape Town, he played a few scintillating shots"
<b>extra bounce</b> in the same over a ball kept low. A delivery close enough to good length rears up to strike the splice of the bat of Philander even as he comes forward
reads the line to be outside off and allows it through to the keeper
"good length, outside off, no shot and off they go to tea"
"good length, starts outside off and nibbles away further, Amla lets it go in the corridor"
Amla shuffles forward and across as he turns this full ball to the square-leg region and <b>becomes the top scorer in this Test</b>
"good length and on a set of stumps outside off, Philander watches it through to Parthiv"
"Bhuvneshwar goes wide of the crease, gets it to hold its line outside off, driven up to cover"
pitched up and angling into Philander's front-foot push to mid-off
"Bhuvneshwar flings a bumper on off stump, flies over a ducking batsman to Parthiv. Wide called"
"dug in short and outside off, Philander takes it on and drags a pull to deep midwicket"
"he starts with a loose ball down the leg side, deflected to fine leg"
"pitched up on off stump, tipped into the gap at point"
"full and darted outside off, Philander shelves the drive and leaves it be"
"good length and pushed wider outside off, Philander covers his off stump and shoulders arms to it"
"pitched up and angling in at off, Philander presses forward and bunts the ball down to mid-off"
short and plenty of width on offer - India can't afford that - Philander laps it up and flashes it through cover point and finds the boundary. It trims the deficit to 35
Amla shuffles forward and across to meet this back of a length ball outside off. Punched crisply to the off-side sweeper
"Amla shimmies out and moves across off stump, Bhuvneshwar pulls his length back and pushes his length wider. Left alone"
"pretty full at leg stump, picked off to fine leg"
"full and probes away outside off, no shot"
"shot. Good length and outside off, Philander dares to drive on the up and finds the gap at the covers. Crisp timing"
<strong>Philander cops a blow on the glove</strong>! A good length ball on off stump explodes off the pitch and hurts Philander. It was more or less similar to the ball that he punched to the cover boundary earlier this over. But this one kicks up and surprises him
"<b>right over the stumps</b>! Amla positions himself on fifth stump, and Bumrah naturally attacks middle. The batsman goes for a flick and the bounce at the Wanderers saves him"
punches through point
"full on middle, Philander blocks. He's still feeling that right hand, took a gruesome blow last over"
"<b>ooof</b>, the back of a length delivery takes an elevator up to Philander's chest and he hurriedly whacks it to midwicket"
"shortish and outside off, lets it go on its merry way"
"<b>that's vicious</b>! A 140 kph good length delivery which threatens off stump with the angle, then the outside edge with the seam away. In the end, there's nothing. Just another peach of a ball that's too good for a wicket"
lets go a back of a length ball outside off
pushes back seeing the short ball on off stump and dabs it to the right of gully. Splendid work for a quick single. India's lead is shrinking...
"throws his hands at a short ball outside off, and underestimates the bounce on offer. Considering all that, he does well not to spoon a catch to point."
sublime hit to the cover boundary! It's short. It has just enough room to free the arms and Philander puts it away with a high front elbow as good as anyone's in the game
fiddles with a good length ball outside off and is <b>lucky not to nick off</b>
too short again and Philander's able to smear it through the covers once more. There's protection back there now
<b>beats the edge</b> as Philander pokes at a short delivery that straightens outside off
"covers the angle, commits to the shot late, and opens the face of the bat to find a couple past gully's right"
"<b>not sure if that carried</b>. nevertheless, what a brute of a ball! Thuds into the pitch at back of a length, takes off like a rocket, pings off the splice of the bat but dies on its way to the keeper. Parthiv dives to his right, doing splendidly, but can't get there"
works a shortish delivery on leg stump through midwicket
"oh he's gonna rue middling that shot. After being beaten; tested on the inside and outside edges, he hits it perfectly off the sweet spot. A very full ball on leg stump - the kind he makes disappear - ends up in the hands of deep square leg. India celebrate. They still have a slight lead. And the last specialist batsman is gone. What an innings though from the Mighty mighty Hash. That little change to his technique; the bravery to do so on viciously tough conditions and the aptitude to not just survive but thrive."
"excellent ball to the newbie: good length, just a shade outside off, Phehlukwayo leaves."
slices a shortish delivery on off stump to point
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
firm push in front of point as Shami keeps bowling short
"142 kph, asking for the drive on the up from the left-hander. Phehlukwayo keeps his head and doesn't yield"
drops his wrists immediately and the short ball on off stump goes by harmlessly.
moves the ball into the left-hander and Phehlukwayo nudges it to square leg
"full on off stump, Philander keeps it out amid calls from the cordon that go 'this ball, keep bowling this ball'"
<b>beaten</b> by a shortish delivery that should have come in with the angle but then detours off the pitch
<b>between second slip and gully</b> at a very catchable height. So Philander lives to poke away from his body again
<b>keeps low</b> so much that a short ball outside off goes at shin-height. Philander squeezes it out to deep point
"back of a length on off stump, blocks"
"bouncer, which Phehlukwayo avoids easily"
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
"superbly judged catch at long leg! Bumrah's the man, watching the ball intently, moving to his right simultaneously and taking a big pressure catch. The bouncer works and Shami finally has something in the wickets column. Gets it to climb high enough so when the batsman goes for a hook, he can't really control the shot because the ball keeps getting big on him. Top edge results and a good catch seals the exciting passage of play"
"fends off a scary bouncer, climbing all the way up towards his nose, and this is Morne Morkel we're talking about. Parthiv is half interested as he runs and dives to his right but he can't get there"
"bouncer again, but against Phehlukwayo, who is already reading the length quickly, it's wasted"
"another bouncer, which Phehlukwayo negotiates by dropping his wrists and swaying his head out of danger"
<B>ferocious slap through cover</b>! These are the shots batsmen dream of playing on a pitch like this. Against a fast bowler charging in. Width on offer helps. And Phehlukwayo goes full-blooded at it
gets right behind a back of a length delivery at 141kph
"digs it in, halfway down the pitch to make it threaten Morkel, who simply ducks"
on the pads and Morkel whips it away to the square leg boundary. <b>South Africa now only trail by two</b>
"short again, angling it across the left-hander. Morkel is taking evasive action and only just pulls it off"
<b>that's the lead</b>! And what a shot to bring it up. An on-the-up-on-drive against an express fast bowler. High front elbow. Decent stride forward. Laughs in the dressing room
"bouncer on leg stump, Morkel tries to hook it away, past leg gully, but there is just too much bounce to middle these shots. <b>Morkel gets hit on the left index finger and needs treatment</b>"
"another short ball, but it strays down leg and Morkel has an easy leave"
"looks to slap a back of a length delivery through cover, but bottom edges it"
"<b>past mid-off</b>! Another perfectly good length ball is treated with utter disdain. A strong stride forward, straight bat on show and plenty of power in the drive."
"short ball, goes down leg"
"good length, outside off, leaves it"
works a short ball on middle through midwicket. Good stuff from Phehlukwayo. He'll steal the strike next over if Morkel can survive this last ball
"<b>good bouncer</b>, on middle and off, following Morkel, pushing him off his feet and nearly mangling his face. Shami hasn't got the good length ball going, but digging it halfway down seems to be getting him into rhythm"
pushes at a good length that pitches well outside of and beats the outside edge by a mile; well it may well have been
"yorker, aimed at leg stump. The batsman is late on the shot. The ball slips by to the keeper"
"strikes him on the full in front of leg and he's gone. But <b>Phehlukwayo has reviewed</b>. A Bumrah full toss. And it's a pretty devastating full toss too. Fast, swinging in just enough that the batsman's flick shot is of little use. HawkEye returns three reds"
"back of a length and outside off, Ngidi awkwardly prods at it and then pulls his bat back for fear of the outside edge"
"<b>maiden five-for</b>! He completes it with a short ball down leg, which Ngidi gloves through to the wicketkeeper. Parthiv takes a fine catch, running to his left and then putting in the dive."
slinks down leg and Vijay's leg glance doesn't quite reach that far
"hits the deck outside off and seams away sharply enough, Vijay shoulders arms"
good length on off stump and seaming away. Vijay covers his sticks and leaves
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
too short and too far outside off to draw Vijay into playing
that's the length - he floats it further up and the ball swings in addition to seaming away off the pitch. Vijay wisely doesn't want any of it
bangs it into the pitch and angles it across the left-hander. All that effort only for the batsman to not even give it the time of day
"another short ball, which Parthiv sees harmlessly through to the keeper. Rabada almost apologises, raising his hand, for wasting the new ball"
that's the length - at 141 kph - pitching in line with the stumps and therefore demanding a shot. Parthiv does well to play close to his body and not follow the movement of the ball
"<b>ooof</b>, that leaps off the shoulder of the bat as Parthiv attempts to glide the short ball cramping him for room through point. It lobs over a leaping Hashim Amla at first slip and runs away to the boundary. Vicious ball. Nowhere to hide"
shortish and targeting the body. Parthiv attempts a leg glance but can't make contact
"143kph, sways away from the line of the short delivery outside off and tries to tap it through point. No luck"
just short and wide enough for Vijay to keep leaving
"good length and outside off, ignores it again"
slides down leg and it swings further. De Kock needs to leap full length to his right to stop the ball rushing through for byes
"<b>delicious bowling</B> as he pitches the ball up on fourth stump and then makes it seam off the pitch. Vijay is half thinking about playing it, but then keeps the bat in the backlift"
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go"
"good length, wanders down leg, kissing the pad through to the keeper"
"leaps up as he gets beside the line of this length ball and tickles it fine. It was skidding low and shaped slightly into him, but on a leg stump line. India are into the lead"
short of a length and slanted across him at chest height. He leaves
"short and wide outside off, left alone"
"clips one off his hips, aerially towards fine leg. Rabada bowls it on a leg stump line again"
"good length and shaping away late outside off, left alone"
back of a length in the channel and he shoulders arms
"good length and pushed wide outside off, he reaches out and jabs it wide of mid-off who can't pick up as he slides to his right"
"back of a length on the pads, nudged towards fine leg for his first run"
<b>thick outside edge</b> sails wide of gully. He's fending from the crease as this nips away late from a good length on off stump. Stuck inside the line
length ball down leg side and he can't reach it with the attempted flick
"shot. Classic Parthiv Powerplay batting. Length ball hooping into his pads and he isn't close to the pitch of it, but he clips it from underneath to the deep backward square boundary"
"<b>out caught at third slip!</b> Looks like a lose lbw shout at first, but there's a big inside edge on this. He's looking for the flick again with his feet moving belatedly as he tries to drag this against the angle. From outside off. Big deflection onto his pad and it lobs up a few yards in front of Markram at gully. Dies on him rapidly but he leaps and slides and holds on"
good length on middle stump and he drags this behind square leg with his wrists. Rahul just makes his ground as the direct hit comes in
"full on leg stump, nudged to square leg's left and he takes off immediately. Fielder lets that through as a potential run out chance looms. Ngidi the man"
"good length on off stump, defended on the back foot"
good length and angled into middle stump. Pushed into the leg side from the crease
short of a length and shaping away wide outside off. Leaves it. The ball dies on QDK
"back of a length and swinging away outside off, gets inside the line and leaves"
<b>outside edge</b> as he reaches out a long way with hard hands. This is wobbling as it lands and then it nips away from a leg stump line as he tries to push into the leg side. Runs through gully
"good length and swinging away wide outside off, left alone"
good length and shaping away late in the corridor. Stretches forward and leaves
"good length on off stump, allows it to come on and dead-bats it into the cordon"
"good length, bending away outside off. Left alone"
good length and nipping in after threatening to shape away. Left alone
"full and swinging away from off stump, pushed through the covers off the outside half"
"short ball slanted in at off stump, sways away to leave it"
"back of a length and climbing up in the channel, left alone"
beautiful. Unplayable that. Length ball straigthens in the corridor to beat his outside edge as he plays on the back foot.
"full outside off stump, leans in gorgeously as he drives this wide of mid-off. But it's AB there and he slides and gets up in one motion, on his left side. Keeps it to a single"
"full, wide, slight swing away but he takes the bait. Reaches out and checks the shot to caress it through the covers"
"looks for lbw with that straight, wobbly-seamed delivery. Vijay inches forward, careful to play with soft hands, and gets an inside edge off the pad through square leg"
"lays into a supremely powerful drive, but it goes straight to mid-off. Rahul puts himself in a position to do that by walking at Philander"
"good length, on off stump, but it leaps away off the seam to the wicketkeeper. Good leave"
<b>beautiful bowling</b> - pitching it up on off stump and getting the ball to move just that tiny bit to beat the middle and take the edges. This time its the one on the inside as Rahul tries to block off the front foot
"reaches away from his body, but atones for the mistake by rolling his wrists just a tiny but to make sure the cover drive goes to ground"
"lets the ball come to him and defuses it with his wrists again, forcing it to go to ground. The seam movement that Philander is getting is formidable. But India are getting into better positions to handle them"
"ever so full on off stump, at 140 kph, straightening off the angle as well. Vijay minds all that with a perfectly straight, defensive bat"
"good length, outside off, no shot."
"this is the one that comes back in - so he pitches it wider outside off, in the hope that the pitch would give it a little extra. Nothing doing"
"<b>takes off from a good length</b>. Vijay is set up for the leave, and even then he is made to work extra hard to shove his gloves and bat out of the way"
"ignores it on length with Rabada targeting the stumps. It's straight enough, but the length is short enough to shoulder arms"
"steep angle into the right-hander and the pace is high enough that Vijay falls over while playing the flick, a shot he usually puts away"
"137 kph good length ball outside off, Rahul watchfully leaves"
that's his staple length - short and outside off - and Rahul has a much easier job letting it go
"works it away off his pads, in the air but that doesn't matter when there is no fielder in the vicinity. FYI, the vicinity is square leg. Ngidi runs to his left from leg, puts in the slide and has saved a couple of runs."
"too short, too wide, Rahul lets it go"
reads that this good length ball is wide enough not to deal with
still too wide to interest the batsman
"<b>so impossibly good</b>. He bangs in on a good length in the corridor, the angle from wide of the crease making Vijay has to play the ball. Then it  seams away past the edge"
"Short on off stump, gets off his toes to put a dead bat down on it"
"Full and outside off, pushes it through cover"
"Back of a length and outside off, no shot"
"good stuff from Rahul. He's conscious of playing the original line, even if it makes him look awkward - in this case squared up when the ball seams. Then he has to take the care to commit to a shot as late as possible. The result of all that is a very threatening delivery, pitched up on off stump, is superbly blunted"
"back of a length and outside off, blocks it with plenty of pedigree. Rahul is looking outstanding so far"
short and wide and Vijay hits it straight to point. That's a bit disappointing
"<b>past third slip</b>. Vijay is a touch tentative against this short ball in line with off stump. Morne angles it in, the pitch makes it go away. The outside edge results but it is India who benefit from it"
drops his wrist and spurts a short ball outside off
"smacks it off the middle through the covers. The shot is made by the footwork, lightning fast and super clear. And also judgment. Vijay spots the short ball early, knows that there isn't too much room on it so he needs to hit it with a straighter bat than a full-blooded cut"
"good length ball outside off, ushers it to the keeper"
"<b>how has that missed off stump</b>? It's good length. It seams in. It's been left alone. But as much as it moves, it doesn't move enough for South Africa"
"shapes for a push through cover, but then that voice inside his head starts screaming 'loose shot' and so instead he leaves"
"fullish on off stump, Rahul lets it come on and blocks with soft hands"
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go"
"nudges a full delivery on middle through midwicket. Splendid stuff, playing late, playing close to his body, moving his feet with accordance to the length of the ball"
draws him forward to block at a ball that seams away at the last second to take the outside edge to gully
"<b>appeal for lbw but that's too high</b>. Good stuff from Ngidi though, attacking the stumps on a fuller length. And while most balls have moved away off this seam in this Test, his stock delivery is the one that comes in. Catches Vijay on the move, but on the high"
on the pads again and Rahul turns it through midwicket
"short of a good length and outside off, lets it go"
a good length ball surges through to the keeper at head-height. All that menace though is wasted because it's outside off and Vijay is leaving
plonks a straight bat down to protect his off stump from a good length ball
<b>good leave</b> as Vijay stands on middle and isn't swayed by the full length. His mind tells him it's outside off and he trusts it
strides forward to block a full delivery on off stump. Good positive footwork and the sound of ball pinging off the bat is finally getting louder.
"gets across on off stump and spends three-fourth of this delivery prepared to play it, but once he sees that the seam movement isn't coming into him, he leaves outside off"
"gorgeous shot! Head over the ball, front foot coming down the pitch, and a firm push to the right of mid-off. The bat face was closed for that explicit reason"
strides forward again to defend a fullish delivery outside off.
"<b>teaser</b> outside off, but Rahul, after getting in position to perhaps defend it, realises it is tinged with extra bounce and that devastating bit of seam away. Immediately, he hoists the bat up to the sky"
"turns a shortish delivery at 140 kph through midwicket. Plays it so late, and so close to his body. Oh, and a collision between AB and Elgar as they try to back up the throw."
"<b>outstanding bowling</b>. It's fullish. It draws the batsman forward. it gets just enough help from the pitch and moves the other way - Ngidi often brings it in, but this one darts past the outside edge"
<b>beats him</b> but that's bound to happen when the length is short. That means the ball has more distance to deviate and invariably it goes past the outside edge after squaring the batsman up
gets forward to block a full delivery just outside off. The bat is chained as close to the body as is possible
"strays down leg, Rahul attempts a leg glance, it kisses the pad and beats de Kock's dive"
"good length, outside off, no shot"
"tempter - pitched up and ripe to be cover driven. But in the last over of the day, Rahul will not yield"
firm push into the covers as he gets his front foot to the pitch of the ball outside off. That is a resoundingly good way to end the day for India. They're ahead in this Test.
"back of a length and zipping through outside off, Vijay tucks his bat inside the line. Excellent carry to de Kock"
"similar length and closer to the off stump, Vijay softens his grip and lets the ball slide off the face to vacant third man. Deep backward point runs across and mops it up"

"good length and darted outside off, no shot"
"full and skids through outside off, no shot again"
"good length and Rabada brings this one back into Vijay, tantalisingly close to the off stump, it <b>bounces over it</b> as Vijay shoulders arms again. You can never leave it on length on this pitch. You can never be in on this pitch"

"full and outside off, wobbles away slightly, Rahul covers his off stump and shoulders arms"
"full, starts outside off, seams away a long way outside off, easy leave for Rahul"
"full, just a shade outside off, nips away slightly, Rahul is wary of the threat and lets it go"
"good length and on a fourth-stump line, swings away, Philander nearly makes Rahul play. The batsman pondered about having a crack at it before belatedly tucking his bat inside the line"
"<b>Philander drags the batsman forward and draws the outside edge</b>, which is pouched by Faf du Plessis at second slip. Smart, chest-high catch from the SA captain. Rahul fails to add to his overnight score. Philander dangled it up full and wide outside off, it wobbles away further. Rahul goes searching for the ball with a loose push away from the body and nicks it behind. One can bring two or three or four on this pitch"
"dug in short and attacking the body, Vijay fends it down"
"full and angling in at off stump, Vijay has a short stride in defence"
"<strong>oooooh, this explodes off the pitch</strong>. Rears up from a back of a length outside off, Vijay sways his upper body out of the way"

"short of a length and outside off, left alone"
that's a Test-match wide. Back of a length and sprayed waaaay wide outside off. Morkel needs to tighten up
"<strong>Bursts from a good length, straightens away, snatches the outside edge</strong>, and flies to the right of Faf at second slip. Batting keeps getting tougher at Jo'burg. Angling in, Morne, as often, generates extra bounce, the pitch assists him, and the outside edge is found near the shoulder of the bat. The line was pretty close to off stump or on, which meant Pujara had to play. What a snorter from Morkel - that was unplayable"

"good length, Morne hits the bat as opposed to bat hitting the ball. Fended to the off side"
"lifter, outside off, Vijay arches his back and lets it go"
"straying onto the pads, Vijay can only work it away to forward short leg. He was hanging back expecting the short ball, but this wasn't short enough"
"Philander has Kohli nicking off? Fuller than a good length, pitches on off, makes Kohli play, and <strong>wobbles past the outside edge</strong>. No nick"
"Philander brings this back into Kohli with the angle, finishes on a fourth-stump line, <strong>tight leave from Kohli</strong>"
"back of a length, kicks up, <strong>Kohli jams an inside edge onto the thigh pad</strong>"
"shot. Imperious cover drive from Kohli. Pitched up and outside off - not a long half-volley - Kohli stretches out, meets the pitch, and creams it away for the first boundary of the morning"
Philander shortens his length and pushes the batsman back. Blocked into the covers
"two men close square on the leg side but this lob carries to neither. Good length on middle, kicks up, Kohli loosens his grip, and fends it in the air. How can you bat on this pitch?"
"back of a length and holds its line outside off, left alone"

"fuller and outside off, Kohli is concentrating. He presses forward, meets the pitch, and defensively bunts the ball to the covers"
"The seamers keep threatening the edges. Good length, angling in, Vijay plays for the angle but the <strong>ball breaks away past the outside edge</strong>"
"the follow-up delivery is an inducker, bounces up, beats the inside edge and <strong>strikes the thigh pad</strong>"
"full and angling into the pads, Vijay senses a scoring opportunity. But he checks his flick and chips it.... but Rabada throws himself to his right from short midwicket and cuts it off. SA's bowlers are relentless in the field too"
"swerving full-toss on off stump, check-driven back to Morkel"
"another Test-match wide from Morkel. SA don't want this Morkel to turn up. Sprayed far too wide outside off, easiest leave for Kohli"
"full and veering into the pads, this is not a full-blooded flick from Kohli. He lobs it to the right of Markram at short leg. <strong>Drops a tough chance</strong>. He isn't quick to close his hands around the ball. The ball hits his right hand and goes down. Such catches need to stick"

Flush on the front of the helmet. Looks to be in shock. That was scary. Very very scary. He's on his feet, thanks to the superior grille protection.

*<b>Addendum:</b> Replays show that the ball was shorter than it appeared in real time and that Elgar was standing outside his crease. Looks more like a case of a batsman missing the ball than the pitch acting up."
"bangs it in first ball, and it takes the express elevator all the way to the long leg boundary. Normal bounce though - bouncers are meant to climb that way"

"<b>good leave</B> - he continues trusting that big back and across movement, spots the short of a length ball and immediately drops his wrists. Spectacular concentration."
"short, wide, four. the mighty Hash is away on the fourth day. Much like Kohli, he spots the bad ball early, gets into an  attacking position and nails the cut behind point"
"<b>strikes him on the thigh and goes up in an appeal</b>, triggered perhaps by that giant shuffle across. But the height is a bit of a problem. Amla is deep in his crease and is struck in line with off stump. But there is enough bounce for umpire Gould to shake his head"
"that's a bit tripe. Another short and wide delivery which Amla flays through extra cover. Stands up tall, frees his arms and looks resplendent doing so"
"wide enough - the shuffle also helps him identify that because he essentially ends up on off stump so anything past his eyeline, he can leave"
"<b>that's a better length</b>! Pitches it up on off stump, has Amla uncertain for half a second before he brings down a straight bat held in soft hands. Barely two overs in, and there's already some great skill on display"
"good length ball angled across the left-hander, Elgar doesn't bother with it"
"stays in line and blunts the length ball into the leg side. Good stuff from Elgar, not committing to a shot until the last possible second. Equally good from Bhuvi, making sure the batsman has to play"
"<b>extra bounce off a good length</B>, and it's not the first time. This is about 6m from the stumps, and it's perfectly straight so Elgar has to play. He tries, but the exaggerated seam movement takes it past the edge"

goes back and with hands holding the bat so very softly blunts a ball seeking the top of off stump
shuffle across and defend the full delivery on off stump. Good batting. Amla's somehow managing to shut the demons in the pitch in that prison he has in the back of his mind
"goes on with that short-of-a-length attack, and Elgar tries to brush the ball off his hips. Beats the bat and goes off the thigh guard"
pitches it a touch fuller and the line is on middle and off. So Elgar has to play and he is subsequently beaten
"full and on off stump, peels it out towards cover"
<b>good leave</b>! He sets up to try and flirt with a back of a length ball moving across him. But then realises it is climbing to steeply for any kind of shot and so drops his wrists
past the keeper as the ball keeps a touch low and seams away after pitching on off stump. Parthiv has little chance to get his body behind it. Gets a pretty bad bounce a few inches in front of his face
"considerably full on off stump and Elgar is forced to inch forward, as a mouse would after the cat has gone away to take a nap, and pushes to the right of extra cover."
"<b>holds its line</b> - this is the bowler's skill, to make it pitch on and around off stump, back of a length, and work against the angle. A touch more bounce than Elgar expects and he is beaten on the inside edge, looking quite uncomfortable"
width on offer and Elgar taps it on top of the bounce through the vacant point region. Very minimalist. Much like his partner at the other end
"fullish delivery, but it pitches just wide enough outside off that Elgar lets it go"
"good length ball on and around off stump, Elgar is happy to let it carry on with the angle"
"goes around the wicket and <b>nearly has him lbw</B>. It's good length, it's aimed at middle and leg. Elgar moves back and across and has to hurry up bringing his bat around his front pad"
"short of a length and outside off, no shot"
"<b>beauty</b>! It's the perfect line, accommodating Amla's shuffle into his calculations and landing the ball at around fifth stump. The batsman is close enough to it that he feels he has to play, and the subsequent seam movement beats him"
"another <b>outstanding ball</b>, if only marred by the fact that he isn't bringing Amla forward. The batsman, having shuffled again, has to play, even though it's well outside off, and he glides it with soft hands away through point"

"lovely bowling - in that off-stump channel, and just nibbling away, but Amla plays spoilsport by shouldering arms"
"the straight one, at a full length, and Amla plants a dead bat on it. Brilliant technique. He's not letting his hands go more than a few inches in front of his body"
"wanders across his stumps and once he understands that the ball is outside his eyeline, he doesn't care for it"
"goes for a little flick through midwicket, but the short of a length delivery at fourth stump takes the leading edge towards cover. The fact that it doesn't go up implies how softly Amla's holding the bat"
"right up there on off stump, giving himself the best chance for a wicket. Amla blocks it stoically"
"good length and just a shade outside off, Amla gets in line and defends"
"short of a length from around the wicket, Elgar, twisting himself into the shape of an S, and yanking his bottom hand off the bat, blocks"

"fuller delivery on off stump, defends"
good length and aimed at the top of off stump. Elgar protects it well
"<b>outstanding!</b>. Elgar is in the worst position possible, up off his toes, his balance all shot to heck. Instinct makes him reach out to a back of a length delivery that has seamed away towards the slip cordon. Hard hands would have meant he lobbed a catch straight to them. But he softens his grip and forces it to ground"

"short and a shade outside off, Amla has enough time to get in time and glide it square on the off side"
"it's cost runs, but that's the wicket-taking length here, right up there, outside off. Amla's skill in playing late and close to the body allows him to steer it behind point. Gets low in his front-foot position to time it as well as he can"
"back of a length and outside off, no shot. Bumrah around the wicket to the left-hander"
"<b>outside edge</b> peels away towards the third man boundary. Rahane catches up with it. Bumrah is slowly getting closer to the length he needs to bowl. This too isn't necessarily good yet, but he's closing in"
"that's it - right up there, on off stump, with the way he's getting the ball to straighten, there is every chance he will get Elgar nicking off. What's more that edge does result, but it goes down to gully. And Rahane misfields to offer a single"
gets back and across and works a full delivery from outside off to the right of mid-on

"short in length and that brings an aggressive stroke from Amla, a punch to point"

"<b>lovely bowling</b>. I think he goes a touch wide of the crease to enhance the angle into the right-hander and then makes the full delivery straighten. All of that menace though doesn't stand a chance against Amla, his concentration and his excellent defensive technique"
"that's good - he's hitting the straps early, pitching it up on leg stump, hoping for that seam movement away. Elgar manages to blunt it, even if he looks like he shouldn't belong on a cricket ground. #Guts."
"back of a length and targeting the gut, Elgar works it away towards square leg, pulling the bottom hand away because the ball thuds into the very splice of the bat"
"brings the bat down the original line of the ball, and when it seams, it beats the outside edge handsomely. It's ridiculous to say it, but that's well played. He doesn't follow the movement. Meanwhile, Ishant is looking in top form"
"<b>outstanding bowling</b>! It's good length. It's on middle stump. It could easily have tempted a lesser batman to play. But Elgar lets it go, trusting in the bounce of the Wanderers"
"right up there on off stump, forcing Elgar to play, and this time he brings it back into the left-hander. Utterly discomfitted, the batsman squirts an inside edge to long leg"
"this over has been a splendid example of the length and line India need to bowl. Ishant probes away, looking for the outside edge, and the unflappable defence of Amla is the only thing stopping him."
"hangs back in his crease to defend a good length ball on middle and leg. Unless, I'm seeing things, the pitch is finally offering a little something to the batsmen - in that the pace is slow enough for them to adjust while playing back"
"full on off stump, and yet Elgar stays deep in his crease and backs his hand-eye to prevent damage to his castle"
"<b>seam</b>, a little too much as it turns out, as Elgar is squared up by a very full delivery on middle, hanging back as usual, and then is beaten soundly"
"down comes that bat in an awkward arc from gully, and it meets the back of a length ball on middle and off."
"on the pads, with Elgar moving across outside off to deal with the angle from around the wicket. He flicks to square leg"

a touch shorter - back to the old Ishant length - and Elgar is able to blunt it on middle
"<b>beeeeauty</b>! This is dream Ishant. This is him listening to every one his fans who has screamed, 'bowl full, yaaar'. Lands in the corridor, and gets that lovely little bit of movement away from the prodding bat of Elgar."

<b>inside edge</b> as a tiny bit of seam movement off a full length means Amla ends up playing outside the line of the ball. The ball wanders out through square leg
"back of a length and outside off, Amla ignores it."
it's the fact that he plays so late that allows him to handle the seam movement away from Bhuvi. Soft hands. Bat close to body. Single to point
<b>goes on the bounce</B> to Vijay at square leg. Elgar tries to whack a shortish delivery off his hips before he gets hit and nearly plays a loose shot
"<b>edged, and over the cordon</b>! India have been working for that bad shot. They get it, but instead of a wicket, it brings up the <b>fifty partnership</b> between these two. Elgar is reaching away from his body. He's on the front foot, but it's barely moved. That's why he's throwing his hands at the shot, that and the seam movement away."
"good length, on the pads, Elgar works it square on the leg side"
"full on off stump, Elgar defends nice and close to the body"
"considering the judgment he's shown, this is a bit lax from Amla. He shuffles across, and positions himself on off stump. Then he is drawn forward by Ishant's good length, he indulges in a defensive prod, and is beaten by the seam away. Amla was leaving those earlier today"
"shortish on off stump, but because of that back and across leap, Amla works it to leg gully"
"full on middle and off, Amla gets across and drills it to mid-on. Even this might have been met with soft hands, which is why he doesn't beat the fielder"
"back of a length on off stump, Amla drops it into the covers with a gentle touch and looks for a quick single. Elgar doesn't want it though. Considering Amla spends about a second in the middle of the pitch before he takes the trip back to his crease, there might have been one"
"full on off stump, Amla flicks to mid-on, playing as late as he could, waiting until the ball is right under his eyes. Under different circumstances, he could have given himself the chance to work it to the right of the man"
"<b>buh-rilliant pull shot</b>. And it looks ever so much the better for his lifting the front foot up. Rare bad ball from Ishant, pitching halfway down on off stump. Amla does his jig to get in line with it and rolls his wrists so that it goes to ground, and past the right of the leg gully"
"back of a length on off stump, Elgar steers it towards point"
"extra pace from Bumrah, and the 141 kph short ball does make Elgar look ugly as he fends it. But the fact is, he is a lot more sure of balls from that length"

"bouncer, pitching outside leg. Possibly the worst ball of the Test match. Elgar might as well lie down and yawn"

waits on the shortish delivery on off stump and taps it into the covers
"<b>pushing at the ball</B>, another half-chance created by Ishant.  And it's the result of his length. It's nice and full. And this ball is dangled outside off as well. Elgar sets up for a drive, then he checks the shot, and in the end manages not to spoon it anywhere near a fielder. Extra cover is not near enough"
"good length ball, wide outside off, Amla leaves it and the ball carries through well over the head of Parthiv."
"he's taken a ball on off stump away for a ride to long leg. Sublime from Amla. Once he shuffles, the short ball on the sticks and off is the worst one possible. All the batsman has to do is deflected it off his hips"

"good length on off stump, defends"

"glances it away towards long leg, Ishant too now stricken by Bumrah's short-ball bug"
"half a chance of lbw considering Ishant bowls full and straight and Amla shuffles across and is left needing to play around his front pad. But those wrists are absolute gems. Helps him meet the ball, and pinch a single to the right of mid-on"

"good length, on off stump, steers towards point looking for a single, but Elgar vetoes the call"
"this is short and Amla has a much easier job, with the extra time on his hands to block it"
"<b>inside edge</b> very nearly crashes into leg stump. Amla, the serene, is beaten for pace as Bumrah puts in a little extra on this back of a length delivery that seams in just enough."
"143 kph, the pace is up, but the length is not. Elgar shuffles across and deflects it off his hips to the long leg boundary."

"starts a bit wide and Amla, in this heightened mode, leaves effortlessly"
"<b>that is such beautiful bowling</b>. It's the Ishant special, the angle coming in to fool the batsman into playing and the ball seaming away off the pitch past the outside edge. Somewhere, Ricky Ponting is sneering"
"back of a length and outside off, Amla lets it go"
"short and outside off, Amla ushers it through to the wicketkeeper and sets it up with food and drink"
"the back and across trigger makes Ishant shift his line wider, and that in turn sets up a familiarly straightforward thank-you-very-much-for-trying-but-I'll-leave-you-be"
"that's good skill - he meets a threatening delivery - in the off stump corridor, wobbling a touch - and glides it past gully's right. Soft hands keeping the bat face pointed firmly downwards"
"<b>falls short</b>, India's best fielder is put in the line of fire, a fierce cut from Amla's whirling bat comes at Rahane in the gully. He dives to his left, sensational reflexes to even get a hand to it. Saves four"
ticks a shortish delivery from around the wicket away to long leg
short and wide - he's been short and wide all day - and it offers no threat to a patient batsman
defends it to cover off the back foot.
"'caaaatch,' is the cry as Amla shuffles in line with a shortish delivery on off stump and misses the flick. *checks calender* Yep, it's the day of the blue moon."
comes in line to a good length ball on fourth stump and defends it towards square leg
"<b>that's a ripper</b>! He gets a little lift off the pitch - nothing dangerous, just the kind you associate with a tall fast bowler as he hits the deck. The line is testing, around off stump, seeking the outside edge. Elgar wisely lets it go"
"<b>that kicks up</b>! This is the pitch. And Elgar has to yank his bottom hand off the bat and wring it a couple of time to dull the pain. A good length ball on middle, forcing the batsman to play, causes immense problems"
bravely gets low to defend a full delivery from the crease.
"that's the sucker ball, and it's not the worst one. Elgar might have mistaken it for the drive ball and gone for the cover drive. But he's a little too tough for that"
"<b>good leave</b>! It's a late thought to do so, considering the ball has pitched on leg stump, but since it is also short of a length, Elgar spots the seam movement early enough to avoid playing"
"<b>ya got no chance</b>! A supremely good delivery, pitching on middle, drawing Elgar forward and seaming away ever so viciously past the edge. Batsmen can do little more than shake their heads and move on"
shuffles across and leaves the back of a length ball outside off.
that's the trademark punch through cover point. High elbow. Straight bat. Just the slight canting of the face. Glorious to watch
"<b>that's another rippaaaah</b>. He has to play at this good length ball from around the wicket, it's coming for the top of his off stump. Then it hits the pitch and darts away sharply. India are back on the mark"
"<b>play that!</b>. Vicious movement as Bumrah angles the ball in at off stump, at a shortish length, and gets both extra bounce and sensational seam away. In this isolated moment, for all the good that bat does Elgar, he may as well walked out with a carrot"
"full on off stump, pushes to cover"
gets a good distance across his stumps - perhaps moved to do so by the sideways movement - and flicks to midwicket
"<B>how has that missed leg stump</b>?! India have addressed their length issues, and when they pitch the ball up, there is plenty of movement on offer. Amla is so good on the flick off his pads, and his shuffle is enabling those shots. Except on this occasion, the indipper leaves him a cropper"
"good length ball a shade outside off, runs it to point with an open face"
<b>inside edge onto pad</b> as Amla mistimes a fairly straight delivery and is very nearly lbw
stays back despite the good length and defends with care in front of off
"<b>these unplayables are stalking Elgar</b>. Only saving grace here is the length is short. One moment he is set up for a defensive blunt. Next, the ball kicks up and seams away past the shoulder of the bat. Great energy from Ishant"
"short and wide outside off, Elgar sees it through to the keeper"
pitches it up at 142 kph and Amla stubbornly stands in its path to middle and leg stump
<b>what a ball</b>!! He turns Amla inside out with a snake that starts surging at the off stump and then darts away towards Parthiv's gloves
"desperate appeal for a catch down leg, but Amla has not touched it. Short ball goes harmlessly by past his thigh"
"<b>that. is. sensational</b>. He keeps the bat straight all the while it comes out to meet the ball, and at the moment he needs to meet the ball, the wrists imbue the power and a bad ball on the pads is punished to the midwicket boundary"
"back of a length and outside off, he lets it go like a millenial being given an outfit that was in fashion three minuets ago"
gets in line with a short ball on fourth stump
<b>whooooa</b>! He's decided he's had enough of being a punching bag for the Indian bowlers. Spots a full delivery and slogs it away to the square leg boundary. The spirit of the IPL auction has entered Dean Elgar!
"back of a length and outside off, Elgar lets it through behind the stumps"
"<b>superb leave</b>! This is a good length pitching on off stump. Elgar moves across, covers off stump, and then leaves outside the eyeline. Great judgment"
very well played. He lets the full delivery come to him and defends close to his body. South Africa have made sure these two have walked out with the coaching manual imprinted in their brains
avoids a good length ball outside off like its a dark alley
"full on off stump, defends firmly"
"he has the opportunity to free those arms and roll those wrists on a ball. That's what he wants for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Pristine punch to deep point"
"full on off stump, Amla, having positioned himself outside that, pushes to mid-on"
"searches for lbw, but Amla is somehow able to mess up India's best laid plans with naught more than a turn of his wrist. And then he makes them hurt more with quick running"
"good length ball outside off, lets it go"
a bit of an inside edge as he politely turns a good length ball to long leg as if it were a lost soul looking for directions
"gets the good length ball to cut it from outside off, but Amla's shuffle makes Bumrah start it too far wide and therefore the batsman doesn't need to play"
"<b>and he gets the edge straight away</b>. But Elgar's diligence wins out. Soft hands, bat close to body. Outstanding"
"goes for the shot ball, which rises sharply at Elgar. Great work from the opener again to ride the bounce and then blunt it by his feet"
good shot as he slaps a short and wide delivery away behind point. The excellence of this shot was in how he waits for it to nearly pass him so that he can place it to the right of the deep fielder
shifts back and across and defends a back of a length delivery outside off
"bangs it into the middle of the pitch, which is essentially the ball that poses the least threat to the batsman. Let alone Amla."
"another bouncer, another straightforward leave."
"full and a shade outside off, Amla defends without footwork, but still looks totally in control"
"back of a length on off stump, firm block"
punches a shortish delivery away to deep point. These shots are working because Elgar is waiting so late to play them
"targets the lbw and it's a really good nut too, full and fast and swinging in and straight. But Amla's wrists are magical. Thuds into the middle of the bat and goes to mid-on"
"good length ball a shade outside off, he defends with the utmost care"
covers the back of a length delivery on fourth stump
"<b>so close to leg stump</b>! He's had a few close shaves like these, the full ball pitching on middle and hurtling past his flicking bat. A fast bowler bowling a class player past his pads is just so rare and Amla is just playing the odds"
"<b>he's been hit again</b>, this time because he overestimates the bounce. He sees the ball thudding back of a length on the pitch and starts tucking his head under his shoulders. That means he takes his eyes off the ball and is hit on the chest"
"too shot, it possibly pitches in his own half and leaves Parthiv no chance. Pandya gives away two runs quite needlessly"
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
chops a shortish delivery past the left of gully
squares him up with a good length ball that straightens. But Amla won't let it get the best of him
goes back and blocks a shortish delivery on fifth stump
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go like a long-held, toxic grudge"
"<b>beaten</b> by a beauty! Elgar is drawn into chasing at a short and wide delivery and it simply climbs too far for him to touch. As a measure, he was trying to punch it through cover with a straightish bat. But it soars by chest-high"
<b>beaten again</b> as he fishes for a back of a length delivery that straightens away from the angle into him. Shami bowling around the stumps
"good length on middle, he turns it to mid-on"
"shortish, on the pads, that's delicious for a batsman who's had a torrid time. Clips it through midwicket and raises his <b>team's hundred</b>"
the shuffle stays on! And Amla blocks the good length ball on off stump
defends a good length ball on middle and off
"superb shot! He plays chicken with the ball right up until the moment it's in his wheelhouse, and then elegantly taps it towards the third man boundary. Good effort from Ishant, running and diving to his right"
"tries to defend a good length ball, but it seams too sharply past his edge. The good thing there is he doesn't chase the ball. Splendid display of batting"
"hammers it to the midwicket boundary! <b>Jo'burg rises to celebrate the first hundred partnership of this Test</B>. It comes off a stroke that is just emphatic. Bowl short to me, will you, he says with this pull shot in front of square."
"full and outside off, lets it go"
"slides down leg, he goes for a flick, but it deflects off his pads past the keeper's right"
"short and a shade outside off, wants nothing to do with it"
nudges a short delivery from outside off through vacant square leg
"around the wicket to Amla, and that shuffle isn't as exaggerated anymore. It's still in play and he flicks the shortish delivery at the top of off to midwicket"
<b>squares him up</B> with a good length ball in line with the stumps. Just the slightest bit of seam away after pitching on leg stump and the outside edge goes to gully.
"good leave. He reads the angle across him is sharp enough, moves across to protect his stumps and then hoists the bat high"
"too short, and Amla drops his wrists"
"good length, outside off, no interest from a man one short of a half-century"
back of a length and angled across him. Elgar's happy to direct its fury at the wicketkeeper
"pitches it right up on fourth stump, and Elgar stymies the plans by not taking the bait"
"good length and outside off, no shot"
"gorgeous bowling from the allrounder. He's consistently pitching it up, which is all he can do, on and around off stump. The mistake has to come from the batsman, and Elgar isn't quite ready to give up."
"back of a length and outside off, chops it to gully"
"very full from around the wicket on off stump, Amla's straight bat is on call again. That shuffle though has shrunk so much that off stump is half visible"
"good length and outside off, no shot"
"bangs it in short, from back over the wicket, Amla doesn't care for it"
"back of a length and outside off, Amla stands at ease"
"shapes to play it, but then he is reminded that the line is outside off and so shoulders arms"
"very full outside off, Amla drills it looking for the extra cover boundary, but a diving Jadeja doesn't let that happen"
"full delivery, on off stump, Elgar blocks it"
"<B>that's fifty</b>! A standing ovation from the dressing room, the coach leading the applause, as Elgar raises his bat. A moment ago, he was trying to hide it, but Pandya's back of a length delivery lurched in at him off the pitch, hit the face of the bat and found the gap between slip and gully"
"back of a length and outside off, avoids it"
"teaser, demanding the cover drive. It goes home to Parthiv and complains about that nasty Dean Elgar who won't give it a chance"
"back of a length and on off stump, blocks"
pokes at a wide one and it goes off the bottom of the bat to the left of the second gully
good length ball outside off doesn't interest Amla
<b>rears up off a length</b> and hits Amla on the glove as he is set up to leave the ball outside off. That extra protection he's invested in pays off. Doesn't even flinch
"short and wide, for half a second Amla thought about T20ing it through the covers. He's just not that kinda guy though"
closes the bat face as he deals with a length ball on off stump. It's a push to mid-on
short of a length and outside off. Those balls don't exist in Amla's world
"good length, outside off, and the Amla leave is preening under the spotlight"
"full and outside off, Elgar lets it through"
"<b>inside edge</b> as he plays a half-hearted drive into the covers. 'There's my favourite cover drive,' says Graeme Smith on commentary. 'The inside edge for one and two'"
"surprises him with a pacey bouncer on middle and off and Amla, swivelling on the back foot to pull, is terribly rushed. Not long has he looked this uncomfortable"
"full and wide outside off, Elgar holds his pose, bat high and held firmly behind his back"
"back of a length and a shade outside off, he bunts it in front of square on the off side"
"looks for the cover drive again, with the ball at half-volley length and offering room, but he toe-ends it behind the stumps"
full face of the bat to deal with the threat of a shortish delivery on off stump
gets up on his toes to try and force a back of a length delivery outside off through cover
"<b>sharp inswing</B>, like the ball that left AB de Villiers' stumps a mess in the first innings. Here, however, Amla is quick enough with those wrists to work it to midwicket"
drills the full ball outside off to cover
<b>seems to surprise him for bounce</b> and Amla covers it by withdrawing his bottom hand. The shortish delivery on off stump wanders like a lost puppy to point
firm straight drive to mid-off
starts with his radar in the bin and Elgar gleefully flicks a ball pitching outside leg to deep square leg
"from around the wicket he sends down a bouncer, but it's the early-warning kind, pitching in his own half and allowing Amla the chance to drop his wrists"
"144kph, good length, outside off, Amla lets it prance through"
leaps back to block a pretty heavy ball on off stump
"<b>superb show of defensive technique</B>. For reward for spending so much time in the middle, he gets a bouncer coming up to his toes. It should normally trouble a batsman, being so very accurate, but Amla just gets up off his toes, brings the bat in line, holds it as softly as he could and pinches a single at square leg"
goes back and defends
allows the short of a length delivery to arrive into his box and steers it to point
"<b>that's ingenious</b>. It's the result of that back and across movement, but even so, to hit a rising delivery, coming up to just over his waist, past mid-on's right with a relatively straight bat requires some skill"
defends the shortish delivery on leg stump to midwicket
defends a full delivery outside off stump
"<b>beats the bat for the 237651725th time in Elgar's innings</b>. He goes searching for this outside off because Bhuvi has moved around the wicket, and from there gets some sexy seam movement away"
"back of a length, outside off, Elgar ignores it like the telemarketing channel"
"full and coming into off stump, Amla's broad blade meets it with such grace."
"<b>makes him play away from his body</b> and even while making a mistake, Amla's hands give him the insurance of making sure the ball goes down, and past gully. One short of fifty now..."
"<b>fifty, and it's one from the top draw</b>! He gets to the mark with a sublime punch in front of point, after getting back and across and showing off a high elbow. The dressing room is up on its feet. Jo'burgh claps a mighty, mighty batsman"
"good length on off stump, defends, but it takes the inside edge"
<b>seems to keep low</b> as Amla goes for that back-foot smite. That little bit of pitch-trickery makes him play with a straighter bat and hit through cover
"bouncer, pitches outside off, waste."
"<B>extra bounce</B> and Amla is made to look mortal. All day long, Ishant has been the likeliest bowler to pick up a wicket and here he urges the demons in the pitch to wake for him. A back of good length ball just a shade outside off - so with that shuffle back and across he has to play - hits the deck and rears up. Its straightened too, so there's double trouble. Strikes Amla on the bottom glove, right on the strapping he's got reinforcing the first two fingers. Got struck plenty of times in the first innings, and now he needs a little help before he can continue"
"shoulders arms to a 136 kph delivery that snakes in at him. This isn't just a brave leave; it's calculated, born of that shuffle across his stumps which ensures his off stump is protected"
"<B>falls short of first slip</b> and Kohli isn't pleased. He demands Pujara to stand closer. The call is a little unfair, methinks, because Amla often plays with soft hands and his nicks, as genuine as they are, often don't carry"
"<b>splendid catch</b>! It's the flick, the shot that has fetched Amla thousands of runs, even on this incredibly testing pitch. His world-renowned timing is on show too. But regardless of all that, Pandya has a job to do. He dives to his right, plucks it out of thin air and gives India the lift they need so badly. Amla walks back to a grateful Wanderers crowd, not to mention those team-mates back in the hut. He's played two ridiculously good innings. And now cedes the stage to another heavyweight batsman"
strides forward and defends around the off stump with unbelievable authority
"beats extra cover diving to his left, Kohli the culprit, falling over the ball. He may well have been surprised by the pace at which the ball came off the pat. Also by the shot itself. On-the-up cover drives are taboo here!"
"<b>no chance</b> as he flirts with a good length ball pitching on leg stump, hoping it either hits the middle, or it beats him. His prayers are answered as the ball zips through to the keeper"
"back of a length on leg stump, defends"
goes around the stumps for a good length ball outside off. Elgar leaves.
"143kph, pitches it up, looking for the break in concentration, but Elgar is not an easy nut to crack"
"cuts back in off the seam - a ball in its 54th over is jagging about, for those wondering if this is a placid pitch - and Elgar does well to cover off stump and shoulder arms"
"back of a length on off stump, blunts it"
"can't give him easy runs! And early Valentine's gift comes from India's best bowler of the day. Length ball, on leg stump, tickled fine"
<b>plenty of carry</b> as he hits a good length and outside off. De Villiers heaves his bat high over his head
covers the line of the good length ball on off stump and sends it to mid-on
"there's the plump, tempting, full and wide delivery and AB looks for the lash through cover. Mistimes it. Badly. Looks like he wants to dominate. Gagging to."
"surprise short ball, but AB is able to drop his wrists and sway away from the line. Doesn't waste the bouncer, angling it into the right-hander and having it go right over middle and leg stumps"
inswinging full toss and de Villiers whips it to short midwicket where Pandya again is impregnable
"looks for the blockhole, misses it by a few inches, Elgar squirts it away behind square leg"
steadfast straight bat in answer to a delivery that is angled in steeeeeeply at AB. He knows not to close the face when there is so seam movement on offer
"<b>beats him with a corker</b>! It thuds into a good length, a shade outside off, draws AB into a shot, and then scampers past the edge"
"fullish on middle and off, AB knocks it down"
"wants to spread-eagle the stumps with a yorker, but AB strides forward, meets it on the full and pushes to mid-off"
"<b>taken at gully</b>. India are back. A back of a length delivery kicks up a bit more than de Villiers thinks, it also straightens enough to snatch the edge right off the shoulder of the bat and settle safely in Rahane's hands. This X-factor is why India persisted with Bumrah on this tour and despite looking their weakest bowler in this innings, he has dismissed one of the world's best batsmen"
"<b>even the set bat is uncertain</b>! India have sensed the chance they have and are rising to the occasion. A good length ball from around the wicket makes Elgar unsure of where his off stump is. He comes to play, then he tries to leave, by which time the ball pings off the bat face and goes to the third man boundary."
"good leave, moving across to off stump and staying away from the threat of a brilliant ball outside off"
seams away off a good length from outside off. Elgar lets it go
"shortish on middle, Elgar taps it down with soft hands"
defends a good length ball outside off with soft hands and accepts the risk of a quick single
"a touch wide outside off, on a good length, Faf lets it go and that takes the game to tea"
"on the pads and Elgar whips it through to long leg. 'Run, run, run,' is the call from somewhere, not sure if that's the batsmen, or the slip cordon asking their team-mate to buck up"
waits on the overpitched delivery on leg stump and clips it smartly through to deep midwicket
gets the bat down in time to blunt a back of a length delivery on leg stump again. Bumrah's back over the wicket to the left-hander
"bouncer now, well directed at 143 kph, forcing him to take evasive action."
"and when he follows up with a full ball, it's on the pads and Elgar works it through midwicket. <b>The target is an even 100 away</b>"
"his front foot is already inching down the pitch, well before the good length ball arrives - the panic and premeditation of a new batsman. But Faf is good enough to adjust to the ball off the pitch and block towards midwicket"
"probes away on fourth or fifth stump, Elgar holds onto his disciplines and leaves"
"defends a back of a length delivery a shade outside off. Ishant, by the way, is bowling around the stumps"
gets in line with a shortish delivery on and around off stump. Is Ishant tiring? That ball seemed a bit slower than normal
"a drivable ball outside off, but Elgar, knowing the value of his wicket, doesn't go hard at it. Finds cover as well"
"that's better, his back of a length delivery hits hard and high on Elgar's bat as he tries to protect off stump"
"134 kph, fullish on off stump, Elgar defends"
"full and quick on off stump, Faf's defence is sound"
"pitch it on a length and the batsman, especially a new one, faces problems. Faf is stuck in the crease, not sure whether he should come forward or not, but a lack of pace in this pitch helps him adjust and turn the ball behind square leg"
"<b>outstanding stuff from the bowler</b>. He scrounges all the pace left in this pitch with a back of a length ball, pitching it just outside off and drawing a false shot from the South African captain. So close to the nick"
"142 kph, shouldn't be coming forward to that! Or should he? It's a decent length, perhaps a shade shorter than good, and the ball climbs past the shoulder of the bat. <b>That hit a crack and seamed away</b>"
works a half-volley on middle to midwicket. Pandya is making life hard for South Africa
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
"back of a length and outside off, drops his wrists. He's still battling. He's never going to stop"
"back of a length on and around off stump, blocks, keeping that blade so close to his body"
pats down a good length ball on off stump
lets go a good length ball outside off
works himself to stand a shade outside off so that he can exploit the angle into him and find a single at midwicket
"<b>knocks him over as the ball keeps low</b>. Ishant hits back of a length, it cuts back in off the seam, showing no indication it would for three-quarters of the distance down the pitch. Faf often has a gap between bat and pad because of that strange grip he's got, forcing his bat to come down from gully towards mid-on. The same happens here, after a little bit of shenanigans from the pitch"
"back of a length on off stump, covers the line well"
"firm, full face of the bat negotiates the lbw ball angled in from around the wicket"
pushes him back with a short ball on off stump. Elgar blunts it
"<b>huge appeal for lbw</b> but a massive inside edge came first. Bumrah creating chances by attacking the stumps, bowling a fuller length"
squares him up with a good length ball that straightens just enough to make Elgar look awkward again. Blocks it though
on the body and he's able to flick it away to long leg
"shortish and outside off at 138 kph, Elgar ignores it"
<b>strikes the body</b> off the inside edge as he does his best to stay in line with a good length ball that hits a crack and seams in sharply
defends a length ball outside off towards point.
glides the short delivery outside off towards gully
"shortish and outside off, Elgar doesn't bother with it"
"<b>good leave</b>! For the longest time, he tries to get in line and block, but then realises the back of a length ball is tinged with too much bounce."
"<b>pins him lbw</b>! Very little de Kock can do when a 139 kph delivery, pitching short, comes in at the height of the knee-roll. He can't adjust to the ball that quick, doing that much. Amid the celebrations, Kohli seems to point somewhere in a manner that suggests 'stop talking.'"
"back of a length and outside off, blocks it"
"<b>nails him in the box</b> with a 138 kph delivery. That steep angle Bumrah creates, in addition to the backspin he puts on the ball with that whippy wrist-action, makes it very hard to judge the pace off the pitch"
brings down a straight bat to stop a good length ball coming for off stump
"<b>kicks up off the pitch</b>! This is shortish in length though, but at Bumrah's pace, even the slightest bit of shenanigans can be quite dangerous. Philander, trying to block off the back foot, is hit on his reinforced bottom glove"
"full and outside off, he goes for that cover drive he plays so well, but finds a single to mid-on instead"
avoids the back of a length delivery outside off
that's an outrageous shot - every bit as awesome as an Amla punch behind point. Goes through that same region as he stands up tall against the back of a length delivery and forces it away
"looks for the push through cover again, but is into the shot too early and gets an inside edge again"
<b>beats him on the inside edge</B> as Philander tries to smoke a shortish delivery outside off through cover point
picks it away off middle stump to deep square leg
"back of a length and outside off, Elgar wants nothing to do with it"
"shortish and outside off, he pushes away from his body and toe ends the ball"
<b>thuds into his right hand</b> as a shortish delivery hurries into the right-hander. Bumrah's angle from wide of the crease is sharp. He gets inward movement off the pitch. It's all very hostile stuff
"full on off stump, Philander manages to twist it to mid-on"
works a short ball off his hips away to long leg. <b>South Africa have clawed their way to 150</b>
good leave as he realises the back of a length delivery outside off wouldn't seam back in
"<b>direct hit might have had Philander at the keeper's end</b>. There's enough indecision after Elgar punches down a shortish delivery to the right of cover. It's Pandya there, and he's very quick; already pulled off a wild run-out earlier in the series. Here, he just misses the mark"
"back of a length and outside off. Elgar pushes at the ball. Playing away from his body. It moves after passing the bat, and Elgar looks behind as well. <b>Was there an edge</b>? UltraEdge confirms there was nothing"
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
"works the shortish delivery on middle and off away to long leg. That shuffle across, and his taking guard on off stump helps him play those shots"
he cannot read the length; the line is putting him in the line of fire. Philander needs to make a decision. He thrusts his hands out at the inswinger and finds an inside edge to long leg
"<b>huge appeal for caught behind</b> but the umpire shoots it down. Kohli is looking around, looking quite unsure, and finally opts for the review. The excitement begins with a back of a length ball, angled in from around the wicket, forcing Elgar to play, and then beating the outside edge with seam movement. <b>Ultra-Edge shows no spike</b>. India will lose one of their two reviews"
opens the face and glides a shortish delivery outside off to point
"starts wit ha short ball, which also gives the room for Philander to slap it through to the cover boundary. And the Bull Ring roars its approval."
"goes full and Philander unleashes a big, booming drive to mid-off"
"<b>chops on</b> going for a pull shot. There's no feet here. All hands, forcing the ball when it's not quite short enough for the shot, or wide enough for that matter."
<b>too quick</b> for him as Shami nails a yorker outside off.
"plenty of pace, loads of carry, the ball is outside off though and Phehlukwayo pulls his bat inside the line"
"<b>knocks him over</b>! An uncertain forward press from Phehlukwayo to a pretty full, fast delivery outside off. Piggy-backs off the inside edge and onto the stumps. Double-wicket over and the Wanderers is stunned"
"shortish on off stump, blocks"
thrusts his bat at a good length ball outside off and times it sweetly through the covers
"cuts the short ball outside off to the deep point. Only run, and Rabada will now have to face three balls in the over"
"looks for the pretty cover drive, but the good length ball seaming away has other ideas. Sashays away to the wicketkeeper"
nudges it to midwicket when Bhuvi goes looking for the lbw ball on middle stump
<b>taken at first slip</b>. Rabada's airy-fairy drive pings off the outside edge and lands safely in Pujara's hands. Reward for Bhuvi banging away on a good length. Gets enough seam movement away from the angle from around the wicket to beat the middle of the bat but not the entire thing.
"full on off stump, Elgar doesn't let it pass"
blocks a short of a good length delivery to point
defends a good length ball to cover
works it off his hips to long leg.
yorker! From looking under par to unplayable! It's 137 kph. It's from around the stumps and it's hunting the base of middle stump. Morkel cannot do anything to stop the gory spectacle. India are one wicket away
"looks for the top of off, but Ngidi slogs it away to midwicket"
"short of a length and outside off, no shot"
defends a shortish delivery a shade outside off
"yorker, which he sees out"
"<b>cuts him in half</b> and even a man who has faced over 200 deliveries on this pitch can't sit back lest this happens: back of a length, bites into the pitch, curls back viciously, and beats him between bat and gut"
<B>run-out chance</b>! Elgar pushes to mid-on and risks beating Ishant for speed. And he almost didn't. An underarm throw from the big fast bowler only misses by whiskers
"good length on off stump, Ngidi drives to mid-off"
"full on off stump, Elgar turns it to the left of long-on."
"good length ball outside off, Elgar is squared up as he meets it, the away movement off the pitch causing problems. There's edge, but it <b>doesn't carry to the keeper</b>"
"bangs it into the middle of the pitch, Elgar avoids it"
blocks a fullish delivery on off stump
"<b>easy runout chance</b>! Pandya races in, he gets two hands to the ball, then has to decide whether he wants to run through to the stumps or throw it at them, he chooses the latter, but doesn't hit target. Ngidi is safe. And Elgar, for choosing to run, after digging out a yorker can breathe a sigh"
"smokes it down the ground to bring life back to the Wanderers faithful. It's full, it's straight, it's looking for the stumps but Ngidi spins it around 180 degrees"
shortish and outside off. Elgar glides it to gully
chops a back of a length delivery out to deep point and refuses the single. The call from behind the stumps is 'get him on strike'. Him presumably being Ngidi
<b>beaten</b> as a back of a length ball leaps past the outside edge after straightening. Vicious. Classy. Unplayable
sneaks the shortish delivery through the scattered slip cordon. He waits ages and ages to try and smuggle this through for a few quick runs
"good length ball outside off, blocks towards gully"
"heaves a length ball into the stands at deep square leg. There's a man fighting out there. Elgar is not lying down just because it's nine down. He's 14 away from a century! But, Shami now has six balls at the No. 11."
"short ball, outside off, lets it go"
"<b>half an appeal for lbw</B> but umpire Gould is unmoved and Kohli flashes a smirk, as if he knows they were pushing it with the shout. Right, now to the ball, back of a length, outside off, gets a little waft from the No. 11"
<b>another appeal for caught behind</b> and the wicketkeeper is confident enough to signal the DRS himself. Back of a length delivery that Ngidi thrusts his hands at.... and there's a noise as the ball passes the bat... Ultra-Edge confirms it... <b>Shami has five! India win</b>!
