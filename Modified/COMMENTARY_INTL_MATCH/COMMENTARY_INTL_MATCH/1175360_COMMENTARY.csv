hangs back and typically legside of the ball to tap it towards cover. Hint of away movement off the pitch from Chahar.
"<b>pops up</b> towards mid-on as Shaw tries to flick a shortish delivery on his pads away through midwicket, but it stops on the pitch and nearly does him in"
back of a length delivery wanders down leg as Shaw tries to pull
"short and down leg, Shaw picks it up early and pulls it away behind square leg"
sweet punch into the covers - he's looking gorgeous off the back foot
"twists his body in trying to bring the bat in front of his pad, and tries to keep it as straight as possible too, wary of the awayswing Chahar gets. Good timing on the shot as it races away to the right of mid-on"
<b>inside edge</b> as Shaw once again stays too legside of the ball and pokes his hands at a shortish delivery outside off.
stays put in his crease and whips the pitched up delivery on middle to midwicket
"goes hard at it the moment he sees a short ball outside off, but it's not quite wide enough, nor is the pitch quick enough for him to play through the line like that"
"lovley bowling. Full but not full enough to drive. No room to work with either and as a result, Shaw has no choice but to block to mid-on"
"<b>outrageous hitting</b>! Shaw hasn't been happy with the pace of this pitch. But even so, he picks up a ball that is nowhwere near short enough and pulls it straight of midwicket. Funny thing is, there's no room for him to free the hands either. But still, he short-arm jabs it away. Pure strength there from the youngster"
<b>wallops it</B> over mid-on - and this time he gets a dolly of a ball - short and outside off - giving him all the leverage he needs
"<b>sweet timing</b>! And all he does is open the face of the bat. Lets the shortish ball outside off come on, meets it with the angled bat, specifically trying to beat third man on his left and he does so rather easily"
"<b>outside edge</b>. He doesn't move his feet, tentatively pushes the bat at a pitched-up outswinger. Gets lucky with a thick edge to third man"
"good length, angling across the left-hander, Dhawan drills it to cover"
takes the pace off and pulls the length back. Dhawan eases it into the covers off the back foot
thunders down the pitch - which is another sign the batsmen aren't too cool with the slow nature of this pitch - and misses the slash over cover
"<b>oooh, stays low</b>. That's trademark Kotla. Dhawan is expecting the back of a length delivery to come up at least to his waist and is prepared to run it behind point, But it slips well below that"
"back of a length on middle, nudges it to midwicket"
"drifts the offbreak into the pads, Shaw turns it to square leg"
"hares down the pitch, and with mid-off up, he lofts it over the infield. Superb tactics. Even better execution"
fires it through - shortening his length - down the leg side. Shaw tries to pull it away but can't connect
"lets it hang out there outside off and Shaw, who loves it there, goes for the cover drive. Two problems though: he tries to hits it too hard, and the ball dips and spins on him. Inside edge through midwicket"
"<b>sweeps it behind square</b>. Splendid batting. It's tossed up outside off, and Dhawan gets a monster stride forward, gets his hands over the ball and then swings through beautifully"
"shortish and outside off, chops it into the covers"
pushes it through from round the wicket and the offbreak skids into the left-hander after pitching on a good length on middle. Dhawan knocks it to mid-on easily and skips through for the single
"goes for the on the up drive through the covers, but the ball holds on the pitch and messes with his timing"
pulls the back of a length ball on middle to deep square leg
"<b>taken at midwicket</b>! And all the credit should go to the bowler. First because he follows Shaw, who is trying to make room to access the off side again. Then he puts in enough effort that he derives extra bounce - which is beyond hard on this Delhi pitch. The batsman is cramped and he's committed to the big shot. Ends up with a slog that comes off the high part of the bat and ends up in Watson's hands"
gets inside the line of a ball sliding into leg stump and flicks it to deep square leg
moves across his crease to slices the back of a length delivery to cover
"good length on middle, Dhawan defends and gets a bit of inside edge and pad to sneak a single as the ball wanders towards cover"
goes back to the shortish delivery a shade outside off and punches it through extra cover
"skids into him again, without turning, and almost seeming to hasten after pitching. Dhawan manages to squirt it to cover"
"<B>reverse sweeps</b> to the third man boundary. And it's the result of Dhawan picking up the fact Harbhajan wants to cramp him with non-turning offbreaks. So he knows the trajectory will be flat, and the line will be on leg stump, and so he uses all that to his advantage with an unorthodox shot"
""
"nice and slow through the air to the new batsman though. Tossed up too. Shreyas ventures forward, tentatively, and gets a leading edge to cover"
brings him forward with another deliciously flighted delivery outside off. Shreyas plays with a much straighter bat than the last ball and blocks to the bowler
steps out and has to deal with another ball - this one angled across - bouncing a little more than he expects. Manages to get under it and lift over point
there's a nice cuurrrrrruch off the bat as Shreyas goes for the back foot punch through cover
waits for the short ball outside off and slashes it to deep point
opens the face to steer a good length ball on off stump away to third man
"good length on middle, Dhawan manages to turn it away behind square leg"
"excellent bowling again, targeting the top of off, and also getting it to straighten enough to keep Shreyas to a block to point. <b>Wraps up his spell 4-0-20-1</b>"
"spots Dhawan coming out of his crease and pulls his length back, forcing the batsman to defend to cover. Brilliant skill under pressure from Bhajji"
rocks back and slices the shortish delivery outside off to deep point
"again, he knows the batsman is coming down at him and fires it in flat and at the pads. Shreyas though is good enough to flick it for runs behind square leg"
"good length ball outside off, cuts through point"
"loops it up on off stump, defends"
"<b>falls short</b> of deep midwicket! Shreyas hurries down the pitch to meet a delivery fired into his pads and lifts it gently over midwicket, but it almost seems like he's timed this too well and that it'll end up in Rayudu's hands as he hurries forward. Good effort from the fielder, especially to put his body behind the ball so that he could at least prevent the boundary"
"quicker than lightning, the Dhoni stumping. Will Shreyas survive? Think he will. But phew. This ball - the turn on it! Pitches on middle stump and rags away into Dhoni's gloves. And he's waiting behind those stumps. Ready to pounce. The wolf in yellow clothing. Just that this time Shreyas has the presence of mind to keep his back foot behind the crease and grounded even though he's totally deceived by the flight"
slices it to point and sprints across for a quick single. Jadeja knocks the bails off even as the point fielder throws so there's no real danger
comes down the pitch and is reduced to slogging because Jadeja pulls his length back and keeps the ball wide of Dhawan's reach outside off. Mis-hit through square leg
eases it through point
"bowls it quick and flat, but once it hits the deck, some of the pace comes off and Dhawan ends up being too early on the reverse sweep"
defended back to the bowler
"flat skidder on middle and leg, clipped towards backward square leg"
"back of a length on the pads, tucked away to deep backward square leg"
"a bit of flight outside off, and that's walloped. Clears his front leg and swings through the line to launch it high and straight, back over the bowler's head"
"flight again, but it's pitched right up and at the batsman's feet. Clipped through forward square leg"
"well bowled, wrong'un. Pitches on about middle stump and beats Dhawan's attempted sweep"
"down the track, Tahir floats it a little wider outside off. Driven to long-off"
"flat length ball wide of off stump, stretches across to sweep, misses, gets a bit of pad on it down to the fine third man region"
"fired in flat on leg stump, defended back down the pitch, keeping the front pad out of the way"
"a touch shorter, on leg stump again, goes back to work it through square leg"
"flat length ball angling into off stump, goes back and nudges gently towards midwicket"
"full on off stump, clipped to long-on"
"how'd that miss! Angled in, flat, from wide of the crease, and it straightens past the outside edge as Iyer reaches out for a push into the off side. <b>So close to off stump</b>"
"bam. Down the track and Tahir sees him coming, floats a googly wide of off stump and makes him reach for it. Dhawan reaches out and flat-bats powerfully back down the ground, between the bowler and the non-striker"
fullish outside off and Dhawan sweeps fiercely to the midwicket boundary
the line is straighter now and he clips it gently through midwicket
"big appeal, and it's given! Does Iyer for length here - wasn't short enough to cut and he was going back, playing the trajectory rather than the length. Then it skids on straight instead of turning away, and by the time Iyer can bring his bat down it's already zipped through and struck his back pad. Looked pretty plumb on first glance"
"back of a length, angling across and straightening slightly towards off stump, gets on the back foot to work it away through square leg"
"full on off stump, almost in the blockhole. Dhawan looks to jab it down the ground towards long-off but Tahir moves quickly and cuts it off"
"drops a little short and offers a bit of width, Pant slaps it away to the left of deep point"
"goes full now, outside off, and Pant goes on the back foot to shorten the length slightly and free his arms to play a flat-bat drive to the right of cover. Excellent shot"
"fires it in flatter now, and fairly short outside off, chopped to backward point"
"back of a length, and now he looks to cramp him with a middle-and-leg line. Stays leg-side of the ball and chops it down to short third man"
"length ball close to off stump, gets on the front foot and works it away gently through midwicket. No one in the circle in front of square on the leg side, and he chances a second run despite Rayudu closing down quickly from deep midwicket"
"back of a length outside off, whipped with the turn to deep midwicket"
"length ball angling into a fourth-stump line, and it's the offcutter, so it straightens a touch as Pant looks to punch towards mid-off. Thick edge runs away past Dhoni diving to his left"
"quicker ball this time, angling in sharply to try and cramp Pant for room. Ends up angling it down leg"
"back of a length close to off stump, nice use of the hands to manipulate his bat face and tuck it away through square leg"
"back of a length on off stump, whip-pulled away to the left of deep midwicket"
"slower ball, back of a length, close to off stump, and that's nicely done by Dhawan, jumps away from the line to make room and then he brings his bat down like an axe, strong wrists, to slash it away to the right of the sweeper on the point boundary"
"gorgeous timing. Low full-toss angling into off stump, and he just shows it the full face and sends the ball racing between the bowler and the non-striker"
"back of a length on middle stump, swivels to play a short-arm jab along the ground to deep square leg"
"flat length ball fairly wide of off, slapped to deep point"
"drags down an extremely short ball, flat, into the middle of the pitch and turns away wide of off stump. Reaches out and flat-bats down the ground to long-on"
"a bit more of the old Harbhajan loop on this occasion, but still a touch short outside off. Slapped to sweeper cover"
"full now, closer to off stump, punched firmly to long-off"
"and again, a quick one speared into a shortish length wide of off stump. Reaches out to try and lash it through the covers, and it turns away sharply and beats him by a long way"
"flat, back of a length, again on that wide-ish line. Slapped to extra-cover"
"what a shot that is! Harbhajan has kept Pant quiet with this tactic of bowling it flat and hard into the pitch, and making him reach for the ball. On this occasion the line is closer to off stump, and he leans back and flat-bats it over long-off's head. Incredible. He didn't have much room there to free his arms, but he still managed to muscle it all the way"
"short, angling into leg stump, pulled to deep backward square leg"
"slower one, fullish, ends up angling it a long way down the leg side"
"length ball angling into off stump, and Bravo has taken out the dangerman. Wasn't so much the ball that did it. Pant whips away a good-looking pick-up shot, times it really well, but ends up hitting it within the range of Thakur at deep square leg. Thakur had to do quite a bit of work to sprint to his right and then complete the catch on the slide"
"fullish slower one on leg stump, clipped down to long-on"
"length ball on middle stump, and for the second time in the over an innocuous delivery picks up a wicket. Stays leg-side of the ball and goes for the on-the-up drive, but ends up hitting it straight into the lap of the cover fielder"
"big appeal, not given. Back of a length offcutter, and Paul shuffles across to try and work into the leg side. Nips in past the inside edge, but it might be a touch high, and the impact may have been outside off"
"slower short ball outside off, swings too early and misses the pull"
"down the track, swipes the full one from outside off stump to long-on, all along the ground"
makes room to cut but the ball just doesn't come on. Drags it back to the bowler off the inside half of the bat
"bowled 'im! What a follow-up to the previous ball. That one took ages reaching Paul, this one is past his outside edge before he can bring his bat down fully. Flat, back of a length, spun hard out of the hand and straightening wickedly after angling in from a round-arm release. Tries to make room initially, then tries to bring his bat down straight in a hurry, and ends up playing a long way inside the line"
"tossed up on off stump, driven quietly to long-on"
"shortish outside off, drags a pull to the left of deep midwicket. That brings up his fifty, off 45 balls."
"fuller, on off stump, swept with the turn down to long leg"
"and Bravo continues to pick up wickets. Slower length ball on off stump and Dhawan can't get any power on it as he looks for the pick-up whip. Too early on the shot too, and he sends it ballooning up for a second catch to Thakur, running in from deep square leg"
"full-pace delivery, back of a length and outside off. Zips past the edge as Axar looks to dab to third man"
"fuller, angling into the pads, clipped to deep square leg"
"length ball wide of off, not full enough for the cover drive when the offcutter grips and turns like that. Beats the outside edge again"
"short, chest-high ball on off stump, pulled to deep midwicket"
"length ball on off stump, makes a bit of room and carves it to backward point"
"short of a length, angling in towards off stump. Looks for the front-foot swipe to long-on, only manages a thick inside edge into his front pad"
"back of a length on middle stump, clipped to deep midwicket"
"slower length ball outside off, flat-batted through extra-cover, no timing at all"
"well bowled, short and angling into the front shoulder from wide of the crease. Too early into his pull and he's hit on the body"
"shortish, angling down leg, pulled round to deep backward square leg"
"shot. He knew fine leg was up in the circle, and took a step across his stumps anticipating the middle-stump ball, short of a good length, from Thakur. Would have been a good line otherwise, with deep backward square leg in place for the flick or pull, but getting across the stumps allows him to scoop this over short fine leg"
"slower ball, back of a length, on off stump, flat-batted down the ground, past the stumps and to the right of long-on"
"and again, that big step across the stumps. This time it's Tewatia, and he helps a loopy full-toss - aimed at the top of off stump - to the left of the diving Watson at short fine leg"
"short on off stump, pulled to deep square leg"
"full outside off, fast hands through the ball to carve it away, in the air and on the bounce, to third man. May not have wanted to slice it so fine"
"again he steps across, looking for that fine leg area, but this one's at a difficult place to hit, a full, dipping slower ball outside off,  and he swings too early through his attempted sweep and misses"
"slower length ball on off stump, gets down on one knee to sweep to deep square leg"
"lovely start. Angles the full length delivery into Watson, denying him any room and the batsman has no other choice but to defend"
"but the moment there's width, Watson's brutal. Carves the short ball away to the right of deep third man"
<b>laces it through the covers</b>. Flowing drive from Rayudu and he finds the gap to the left of the fielder up inside the circle. The new ball is a source of runs on this pitch. Especially when the bowler errs full.
hit the deck though and you bring in uncertainty. The ball might stop on the batsman. Ishant tries his best with that ploy and keeps Rayudu to a block
"<b>dropped at slip</b> Dhawan is standing a bit wide there, diving low to his left, gets one hand to it but the ball bursts through. Good stuff again from Ishant, bowling it short and bringing the natural variation from the pitch into play. In this case, it was some seam movement away from the batsman who tries to defend"
"good length on off stump, Watson bends his knees, staying low to deal with the ball and slice it to point"
"course if it's short like that, he can rock back, make room and cut the ball a shade outside off through the covers. Violent. Beautiful"
"backs away again to a good length ball outside off but since it stops on the pitch, Watson has to check his shot and play with a straight bat to cover"
too short and on this pitch it sits up to be smacked. Especially with the line on leg stump. All Watson has to do is bring his full power down on the ball and the pull shot whistles away
<b>beats him</b> with a tossed up ball outside off and Watson doesn't quite nail it with his sweep shot
eases the ball to mid-on and then sprints through
"good end to the over, keeping it wicket to wicket and pushing the batsman back with his length. Rayudu punches it to mid-on"
"looks for the pull, but the back of a length ball comes onto him just a smidge quicker than he expects and it comes off the splice and wanders to cover"
"<B>beautifully done</b>! Watson does nothing more than keep his shape, wait for the full delivery to come to him, and then unleashes a whirl of his wrists that sends the ball over midwicket. Outstanding T20 batting"
"<b>inside edge</b> as Watson defends a good length ball on off stump, but Rayudu pulls his partner through for a quick single and makes it despite a direct hit from Ishant, who ran the length of the pitch and underarmed it on target"
"<b>taken at mid-off</b>! Rayudu pays for being a little too enthusiastic. He hares down the pitch too early, allowing the bowler the chance to change his length, hit the deck hard, cramp the batsman, and even startle him for pace because hey, he chose to needlessly run down the pitch, reducing the time he gets to face the ball. It comes off the top of the bat and balloons to Iyer"
goes full and straight - like really full and straight - but Raina is able to dink it to mid-off
nudges a fuller delivery on middle through midwicket
146 kph and fierce! Watson is pinned in his crease as he defends a fuller delivery on off stump
""
searing yorker on middle - at 148 kph - but Watson is good enough to keep it out. Solid concentration!
"<b>148 kph, takes a hit</b>! This is a short ball following Watson, pitching on off stump and cutting into him nastily. Watson has no time to deal with it. Ends up fending at the ball, which somehow sneaks away towards the covers"
"goes for the yorker, but this time the angle he's hoping to create into the right-hander is a little too acute and Watson flicks it to the fine leg boundary. At 150 kph, it flies"
"<b>top-edge</b> and the 145 kph bouncer goes into orbit behind the wicketkeeper. Watson's not the kind to shy away from a fast bowler. No matter how ugly it makes him look. We knew that from 2015. And here too he gets lucky, the pull shot mis-hit but going for six"
leaps across his stumps and basically tickles a short ball on leg stump away to the fine leg boundary. With his thigh pad though. No bat
"comes down the pitch, then looks totally awkward because Ishant once again bowls it short and cramps the batsman. Raina pulls but it's a mis-hit down the ground."
"slower ball, back of a length, on leg stump, Watson picks all of that up and gently tucks it to square leg"
it's like bowling to a revolving door! Raina moves across his stumps. He knows it is going to be short. He knows it will be outside off. He just holds the bat horizontally at the point where the ball will probably come and then turns his whole body to his right to pull it - Ganguly style - to the square leg boundary
<b>that's vintage!</b>! Raina in his prime used to cut fast bowlers just like this. Clearing the front leg and lashing it over point. Devil-may care
<b>now the slog</b>! This over is Raina's limited-overs game in a nut shell. Looking awkward. Then looking stunning. Then making the bowler tear his hair out. And Ishant has plenty of that. Bowls a short ball outside off and gets pulled straight of midwicket
"back of a length on leg stump at 145 kph, Watson ticks it to midwicket"
"shuffles inside the line of the ball again, and helps it over square leg. Short on leg stump and with his premeditated movements, he's always going to pull that shot off"
"good length and outside off, pushes to mid-off"
slower ball on the pads - he's gone round the stumps as well - Raina turns it through square leg
"full on leg stump, defends"
gets of his toes to deal with a short ball angled into him <b>at 150.9kph</b>. Neat little flick through square leg
sees the full ball drifting into the pads and so he goes down low to sweep the ball to fine leg
launches it down the ground! That - for once - is beautiful use of the feet. Watson does'n't leave his crease until the ball is out of Mishra's hands - at which point the bowler has just stand and watch his length ball be turned into a half-volley and <b>thumped down the ground</b>
"fires it through flat and quick on off stump, defends it"
<b>heaves it over deep midwicket</b>! Too short. Too straight. Too easy. Big pull. Watson in all his glory. And a man in the crowd takes the catch and keeps it. Now he has to deal with a policeman demanding it back
<b>huge appeal for a stumping</b>. And it all starts with some sexy bowling from Mishy. Tosses it up. Tempting the batsman. Luring him into a big shot over the covers. Bringing him out of his crease and then making him lose his shape thanks to the amount of turn off the pitch. Now all that's left is for Pant to collect the ball and break the stumps and he does it in style
"flatter delivery outside off, Jadhav goes back and blocks it"
"<b>huge appeal for lbw</b> but umpire Menon says no. For half a second, it looked close, with the ball beating Jadhav for pace as he plays around his front pad. Perhaps it is just sliding down leg"
"goes for the flighted googly outside off from round the stumps, Raina looks to turn it through midwicket, gets a leading edge down the ground"
too short. Too much room. Too good a pull shot to be anything but a boundary at midwicket
"pushes it through nice and full on middle, Jadhav though is comfortable playing this too off the back foot"
nudges a full delivery on middle to midwicket
"goes back, waits for the way the ball will turn, in the end it actually doesn't, so he's able to get on top of it and knock it down to long-on"
"tosses it up and gets it to drift in on off stump, Jadhav gets forward, to the pitch of the ball, and deftly turns it behind square leg"
"full on off stump, defends"
"spots the short ball outside off, waits for it to turn and then smashes it through cover"
spots that the good length ball is angled across him and so he lets it pass behind him and dabs it to the left of short third man
keeps back to the very full delivery on middle stump and quite easily flicks it behind square leg
"the ball dips on him, denying him the slog sweep that looks so on when the ball was first delivered, lobbing up over his eyeline on middle stump"
"good length on off stump, Jadhav eases forward to defend"
launches it over midwicket. So so so far over. It's a length ball outside off and Raina races out of his crease to slog it with a vengeance
taps it down towards long-on for the single
shapes to come down the pitch but the trajectory is too flat and so he just gets forward to block outside off
"<b>beautiful hands</b>! He's actually not quite in position for the late cut, seeing as he is on the front foot, but he just shifts his weight back, waits for the legspin to happen, and then karate chops the bat down on top of the ball"
nudges to midwicket
"<B>top edge</b> but slip cant quite run that far (meaning short fine leg). Jadhav goes for the sweep, completely mistimes it, but still survives"
wrong'un sliding in towards off stump. Gets forward and flicks it round the corner to long leg
"another wrong'un, a big appeal, and it's given. Raina walks too. May have been the front-of-the-hand slider - just kept going with the angle from over the wicket while Raina went back to play the late dab. Ended up sliding off the bat face into Rishabh Pant's gloves"
"googly, shortish and wide, extra bounce, and Dhoni, rocking back to cut, gets a thick outside edge that flies high to the right of slip"
"full, angling into leg stump, clipped to the right of square leg"
"ooh, lovely flight and dip. Comes forward to defend and the ball drops shorter than anticipated and doesn't turn. Inside edge rolls off the pad towards short fine leg"
"flat, back of a length, on off stump. Flat-batted down to long-on"
"back of a length outside off, nips in a bit and doesn't bounce as high as expected. Looks to cut and gets a thick inside edge past (but not too close to) his off stump"
"length ball angling into leg stump, worked away to deep square leg"
"slower bouncer outside off and Jadhav jumping back and across, is stuck somewhere between pulling and jabbing down in defence as the ball bounces loopily and slowly at him. Ends up not making any kind of contact"
"back of a length on leg stump, tucked away to long leg"
"back of a length outside off, jabbed into the point region"
"shortish, close to off stump. Lets it come on and eases it to the right of point with a straight bat"
"back of a length outside off, jabbed away to the right of deep point, where Rabada slightly overruns the ball while trying to stop it and fumbles to allow a second"
"flat length ball on off stump, comes forward to push to the right of backward point for the quick single. Flat throw into the keeper's gloves makes Jadhav hurry, but he makes it well in time"
"length ball angling into off stump from wide of the crease, defended into the covers"
angles this one into middle and leg and he stretches out for a lap sweep towards long leg
"flat length ball, slides on with the angle to beat the inside edge of Dhoni's forward defensive. Sliding down leg, so no real lbw appeal"
"full outside off, Dhoni presses forward for that trademark all-hands jab to extra-cover"
"shortish, angling in from wide of the crease, cramps Jadhav for room as he shapes to cut. Jumps to ride the bounce and chops it down towards the keeper"
"not short enough to cut on this occasion, goes back and across nonetheless and again ends up chopping it into the turf, towards the keeper"
"back of a length on off stump, nice work with the wrists to place that to the right of midwicket"
"back of a length outside off, opens his bat face and stabs towards backward point. No single was available, but Axar concedes an overthrow with a needless throw to the non-striker's end with the bowler still where he ended his follow-through"
"<b>dropped</b>. Short outside off, Jadhav drags a pull to midwicket, where Dhawan times his jump fairly well and gets both hands to it, over his head, but fails to hold on"
"back of a length outside off, dabbed to backward point with an open face"
"full on off stump, Jadhav hits it along the ground to long-on with a mighty, bottom-handed swipe"
"back of a length close to off stump, lets it come and guides it down to the left of short third man"
"flat length ball outside off, defended to extra-cover"
"shortish, not enough room to cut. Jabbed to backward point"
nicely bowled. Gets some dip on it as Dhoni reaches out to defend. Goes on with the angle and it rolls into the leg side off the inside edge
"back of a length, sliding on towards middle stump to cramp Dhoni for room on the back foot. Jabbed to cover"
"back of a length on off stump, this time he manages to squeeze the back-foot jab a few yards to the right of cover"
"shortish, a bit of width, cut away to the left of deep point"
"back of a length close to off stump. Lets it come on and defends with soft hands, and the ball rolls backwards into the vast space between the keeper and backward point"
"back of a length outside off, punched to deep point"
"Jadhav makes room for the cut, and Rabada bowls a slower one, back of a length, just outside off. There's no pace onto the bat so he adjusts and plays a flat-bat pull to long-on instead"
"sharp bouncer, rising steeply towards Dhoni's head. He keeps his eye on it and ducks his head calmly under the ball"
"short again, gets up to shoulder height over off stump, pulled to deep square leg"
"back of a length on off stump, makes room and cuts to point"
down the track and Axar fires it in at his pads. Clipped to midwicket
down the track again and Axar bowls it flat and quick outside off. Stabbed to cover
"back of a length, no real turn and therefore no real room. Flat-batted hard to extra-cover"
"flat again, fuller this time, close to off stump. Stays back and punches firmly, back to the bowler"
"back of a length on off stump, flat-batted down to long-on for a single that Delhi might not mind conceding"
"shortish outside off, cuts it to the left of backward point, and Axar makes a good diving stop but concedes overthrows once more with another unnecessary throw, this time to the striker's end with the keeper nowhere near the stumps"
"back of a length outside off, jabbed to the left of backward point"
"full outside off, strides forward for a drive to deep point"
"slower ball, sixth-stump line, left alone. Was it really that wide, Marais Erasmus? Borderline call - seemed to finish inside the tramline for me"
"wide length ball, Dhoni is slow getting on the front foot to drive, and is still on the move when he pushes at it with his hands. Beaten"
"shortish, too much width, and Dhoni slaps it away, easily beats deep point to his right"
"back of a length on off stump, and Dhoni jabs it -  without too much weight on the shot, to enable the second run - into the gap between deep extra-cover and long-off"
"googly, spins in towards off stump from back of a length. Hurries onto the bat a bit. Wanted to punch through the covers, ended up hitting it back to the bowler"
"dangled up wide of off stump, Jadhav stretches out for a sweep to long-on"
"back of a length on off stump, Dhoni rocks back, making room, and flat-bats it powerfully, flat but in the air, and it bounces some five yards in front of long-off"
"flat and back of a length, on off stump, pulled down to long-on"
"flighted ball, loopy and inviting, on middle and leg, and it's right in Dhoni's arc for the big backlift, for the front leg cleared out of the way, for the big swing and the bigger hit, straight back down the ground and into the sightscreen"
"flat, back of a length, on leg stump, clipped to midwicket"
"a wicket. Back of a length wide of off, extra bounce, and Jadhav gets a thin edge to the keeper as he reaches out to steer to third man"
"ooh, there's that pace and bounce again. Short outside off, and extra bounce beats the flashing square-cut"
"and again. Another short, rising ball outside off. Wide enough to cut but too fast and too bouncy for the new man, who still hasn't got a measure of the conditions. He goes hard at it, but can't make contact"
"and Bravo finishes stylishly. Shortish, closer to off stump on this occasion. Steps across and then whips it into the gap between square leg and long leg, with front leg up in the air"
