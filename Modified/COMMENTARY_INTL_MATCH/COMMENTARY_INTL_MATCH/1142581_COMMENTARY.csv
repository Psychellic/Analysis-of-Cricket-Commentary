"length ball, a tiny bit of swing in towards middle and leg, Gunathilaka clips it away to long leg to get off the mark"
"length ball slanting across the left-hander, pitching just outside off and continuing to angle away. Karunaratne leaves it alone"
"good length again, the line is closer to off stump. Defended off the front foot towards backward point"
"fullish on off stump, straightens into the left-hander slightly. Clipped away to long leg"
"down the leg side, and Paul Reiffel turns down a huge appeal for caught behind. It's full and swinging further down leg, and Gunathilaka has a little flick at it - did he get an edge on it? There's a noise, certainly... South Africa have chosen not to review, <b>and they might regret it</b>. A spike shows up on Ultra Edge."
"compensates with a full one outside off, and Gunathilaka leaves it alone"
"nice length to start, fullish, and fairly wide - fifth-stumpish. Makes Karunaratne play - comes forward and looks for a push into the covers. Thickish outside edge runs away to the left of gully for four"
"good length again, on off and middle this time, played cautiously towards midwicket"
"short of a good length outside off, left alone"
"ooh! Zips past the outside edge, and wasn't too far away at all. This went off the pitch. Pitched within the line of the stumps, and made Karunaratne play - Steyn's stock delivery would have straightened into off stump, but this one nipped away off the pitch. Didn't go at it with hard hands, though, and that's why he survived"
"fuller, on off stump, defended to mid-off"
"back of a length angling across to off stump, defended off the back foot"
"length ball close to off stump, defended into the cover point region - Bavuma moves like a flash from backward point to cut it off"
"fullish, close to off stump, no swing at all and at a gentle pace. Drives it nicely down the ground, to the left of mid-off, prioritising control over power. Let it come to him and just eased it into the gap"
"And the very next ball stops on the batsman, but the line is middle-stumpish. Clipped to the left of mid-on, but it hung in the air for a while, made some South African hands go up towards their heads"
"short, just a touch of width, goes back and across and chops it nicely to the right of backward point. This outfield is very slow, and the ball comes to a stop three-quarters of the way to the boundary"
"stays back to a length ball angling into off stump, clips it with the angle to midwicket, who seems to have moved in a few yards after that ball that Gunathilaka chipped in the air"
"length ball outside off, wide enough for Karunaratne to leave confidently despite the inward angle and hint of shape into him"
"back of a length on off stump, defended to mid-off"
"short now, on off and middle, pulled to square leg"
"lovely length, angles across to off stump. Good stride forward to defend into the off side"
"nice length again, a hint shorter than the previous ball and angling a touch wider. Draws Gunathilaka into a defensive push slightly away from the body, into the cover point region"
"back of a length, close to off stump. Karunaratne watches it well and leaves it, trusting the angle across him"
"back of a length on off stump, punched to short extra-cover. Looks like mid-off has moved there - wider and closer to the batsman"
"full, angles into leg stump, and Gunathilaka flicks it away off his toes, in the air but into the gap to the left of midwicket"
"beauty. Angles it into a fifth-stump line and gets it to leave the batsman off the pitch. Comes forward to defend, playing for the angle, and the ball zips past his outside edge"
"back of a length, angling into off stump. Gunathilaka goes across and looks to work it into the leg side, gets a thick inside edge into his thigh pad"
"length ball on off stump, defended into the point region"
"full, starts outside leg and swings further down. Gunathilaka flicks at it but it's too far away from him to connect"
length ball slanting across to a fourth-stump line and straightening slightly. Doesn't straighten enough to make the batsman play
"shortish, a bit of width, and Karunaratne gets on his toes to punch it away into the big gap in the covers. Slows down as it nears the boundary, however"
"once again shortish, not as much width this time. Stops on him slightly as he plays that punch again, and it hangs in the air for a while this time, but once again into that big gap"
"ooh, a bit of movement now, away from the left-hander off the pitch. Again on a similar shortish length, and Karunaratne jabs at it, away from his body, and is lucky he doesn't get an edge on it"
"fuller now, fourth-stump channel and angling further away, left alone"
"good length, and nice carry through to the keeper, at around chest height, after Karunaratne leaves it. Pitched on a fifth-stump line and straightened inwards slightly"
"back of a length, angling away from off stump, left alone"
"back of a length, straightens a bit, but only straightens into Gunathilaka's hip. Tucks it away neatly to the fine leg boundary"
"shot! That's a good-length ball, not anywhere near a half-volley, but it gives him a bit of width, and he plants his front foot forward and slaps it away with a wristy flourish to the right of short extra-cover"
"fuller and just as wide, Gunathilaka stretches out to defend to short extra. The leave would have been a better option, perhaps"
"fullish, fifth-stump line, driven firmly to mid-off"
"this time Gunathilaka leaves it. Good length, again slanting across into that fifth/sixth-stump channel"
"good length, closer to off stump. Defends with soft hands, and it rolls off the outside half of the bat into the gap between second slip and gully"
"back of a length, pitching on middle and angling towards off. Gets nicely back and across to block it back towards the bowler"
"nice length, a little fuller and a little wider than the previous delivery, and it carries to de Kock at chest height after the batsman leaves"
"back of a length on off stump, defended towards mid-on"
"back of a length again, on middle and off, gets behind it to work it into the square-leg region"
"ooh, there's the first bouncer of the day, and de Kock has to reach well above his head to collect it. Angles across the batsman and rises steeply, and he sways his upper body away from the line"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended into the on side"
starts with a good-length ball pitching on off stump and slanting across with the over-the-wicket angle. Left alone
"back of a length, ends up closer to off stump this time. Karunaratne gets back and across and defends back down the pitch"
"ooh! Back of a length now, nips away after pitching close enough to off stump to make Karunaratne play. Jabs at it away from his body, and the ball beats his outside edge"
"shorter now, and Karunaratne has a little more time to get back and across and punch through the cover point region"
"length ball angling across to off stump, defended back down the pitch"
"back of a length, angling into a fourth-stump line. Plays with soft hands to keep his defensive shot down in front of gully"
"and you can see why he has that field. Lovely length, pitching on off stump, and it nips away - looks like the offcutter, and it beats Karunaratne's hesitant poke"
"whoa, I'm not sure he was in any sort of control here. Bangs it in short, and it gets up towards Karunaratne's back shoulder. He has to work against the angle with that pull/hook, and contend with long leg <i>and</i> deep square leg on the boundary. He manages to get it into the gap and clear the rope"
"length ball on off stump, defended to mid-off"
"another bouncer, this one is quicker and sharper and keeps climbing on the batsman, over his left shoulder. Does well to evade this one, and not get drawn into another hook"
"back of a length on off stump, defended towards mid-on"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended towards mid-off"
"good length, starts on fourth stump and slants further away. Left alone"
"shortish, not quite a pulling length, and Gunathilaka's attempt at that shot, from just outside off stump, goes off the inside half of the bat, but into the gap to the left of mid-on"
"back of a length outside off, defended into the covers"
"gone! Beautifully bowled, in the channel outside off stump, with some extra bounce from just back of a length. Played away from his body there - which isn't a great idea when all you're attempting is a defensive push - and it takes the outside edge, close to the shoulder of his bat, through to de Kock"
"And he pops his first ball to that man at short leg! Not much of an appeal, so I'm guessing it's straight off thigh pad. Back of a length, angling into the batsman's legs, and he looked to flick with the angle. Straight off the thigh pad, nowhere near the inside edge"
"a little fuller, on off stump, defended back towards the bowler"
"length ball close to off stump, defended into the covers"
"shortish, doesn't bounce as much as Karunaratne expects. Just about waist high on middle stump and he watches it well to play a controlled pull out to deep square leg"
"ooh, some inward movement. Stays back to one that pitches on the shorter side of a good length, and looks to flick without getting across. Beats his inside edge and hits thigh pad"
"good length, fifth-stump line, left alone. De Kock collects over his head"
"short now, targeting the batsman's ribs. Steps neatly across and tucks it to long leg"
"another sharp bouncer, rising over middle stump. Karunaratne ducks quickly to get under it"
"fullish on off stump, defended back to the bowler. Fairly quick to start"
"much slower and loopier, on middle stump. Pitches much fuller than he'd like, and he gets his front leg out of the way and eases it down to long-off. Surprised that fielder is back on the boundary so soon"
"big lbw appeal straightaway! Lovely length outside off, dips and turns to beat the inside edge of Karunaratne's forward defensive, but the impact was probably outside off stump. Impact in line, says ball-tracking, but umpire's call on whether it would have hit leg stump"
"sees him stepping out and bowls it full, at his feet, clipped down to long-on"
quickish length ball on middle and leg. Keeps his front pad away from the line while defending
"good follow-up, slower, flightier and wider outside off. Defended towards backward point"
"shortish, a bit of width, and Karunaratne punches it away - he's played that shot well all morning, and he finds the gap to the right of cover point"
"back of a length, fourth-stump line, defended into the point region"
"Dug in short, angling into the batsman's body and rising over his front shoulder. His lower body wants to jump and his upper body wants to duck, and he just manages to evade it. That's what a good bouncer does"
"ooh, extra bounce again. Angles into the fourth-stump channel and takes off from a shortish length. Looks to defend and it flies up off the shoulder of his bat, between second slip and gully"
"back of a length on middle and leg, defended into the on side"
"shortish, angling into middle stump, defended back to the bowler"
"full, flighted ball on leg stump, driven firmly back to the bowler"
"down the track now and he skips away from the line to get into the perfect position to drive this leg-stump ball inside-out, lofts it silkily over the wide mid-off region"
"fullish on middle stump, defended solidly off the front foot"
"pretty flat this time, on middle and leg and quite full. Defended back to the bowler. He's been very conscious of keeping his front pad away from the line of the ball"
"fires this one full, at Dhananjaya's feet, perhaps expecting him to step out. Looks to flick it away but misses, and it hits his foot on the half-volley, well outside leg stump"
"flights this one outside off, and Dhananjaya plays slightly away from his body in defence. Outside edge rolls away to the left of backward point"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"back of a length, angling into off stump, defended towards cover point"
"a touch fuller, on off stump, and Dhananjaya stays back to it again, defends towards cover point"
"back of a length, looks to angle it into middle stump, probably, but ends up slanting it slightly down leg. Looks to flick and misses, and is hit on the pad"
"length ball close to off stump, comes forward and shows the full face to ease it to the right of mid-off. Doesn't go too hard at it"
"back of a length, slanting across towards off stump, defended into the point region"
"flighted ball on off stump, Maharaj has to dive to his left to prevent the driven single to long-off"
"full again, on leg stump this time. Gets his front pad out of the way and jabs it firmly back to the bowler"
"tossed up slower, on off stump, driven to long-off"
"nice flight outside off, dips on Karunaratne slightly as he steps out of his crease. Wanted to clip that to long-on, I think, ends up playing it towards midwicket instead"
"flat on middle and leg, defended back to the bowler"
"whoa, there's the first sign of extravagant turn and bounce. Back of a length, pitches on middle, turns towards off, and just takes off, de Kock taking it over his right shoulder after the ball beats Dhananjaya's hurried back-foot defence"
"short, rising ball angling across the left-hander. Jumps off the ground and defends towards backward point"
"back of a length on off stump, punched to the right of mid-on"
"short ball, gets up to chest height. Dhananjaya pulls it hard, and <b>hits Markram on the right shoulder</b> at short leg. He barely flinches, though"
"ooh, extra bounce this time. Digs it in shorter than the previous ball, and Dhananjaya is hopping, lifting his hands almost involuntarily to protect himself as this climbs high over off stump. Hits the handle of his bat, I think, and pops up into the leg side, but drops just out of Markram's reach as he dives to his left from short leg"
"back of a length on off stump, defended to mid-on"
"wide length ball, seventh-stump line, left alone"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended into the point region"
"full on off and middle, defended back to the bowler"
"full on middle stump, a bit of flight, driven back to the bowler"
"full again, and flat, on off stump, driven firmly back to the bowler"
"much better length this time, some dip on a line close to off stump, and sharp turn away from the left-hander to beat his outside edge as he stretches out to defend"
"follows it up with a bad ball, short on off stump, and Karunaratne pulls it to the right of deep backward square leg"
down the track and he fires it quick at his feet. Flicks it hard into the ground and it pops up towards midwicket
"full and flat again, on leg stump. He's expecting Dhananjaya to step out every ball. Squeezed back down the pitch, towards the bowler"
"flat, back of a length, going with the angle towards off stump. Looks to cut, but he was playing for the turn, and has to adjust to the lack of room and jab it back towards the bowler"
"full on middle and leg, driven back down the ground and Maharaj dives right to stop it"
"tossed up much slower, on off stump, defended towards short extra"
"nice length, quickish, angling into off stump. Goes with the arm and he defends off the front foot, making sure his pad is nowhere near the line"
"tossed up full on off stump, gets forward, keeps his front pad away from the line, and opens his bat face to play that to backward point"
"good length, pitching on off stump and spinning away. Defended into the point region"
"tossed up slow, close to off stump, driven down to long-off"
"gone, that's an absolute beaut! He'll have to thank Maharaj a little for that dismissal too - Dhananjaya has been so mindful of the lbw that he's been hesitating to get his front foot across. Shamsi floats this one across the right-hander, gets it to dip on a line fairly wide of off stump. Dhananjaya looks to drive into the covers, against the turn, without getting a good stride across, and leaves a big gap for the ball to turn through and crash into off stump. Lovely, lovely delivery"
"nice length, close to off stump, Mendis gets a good stride forward to defend back towards the bowler"
"shuffles across to a good-length ball turning in towards off stump, clips it to short leg"
"full outside off, gets forward and uses his wrists to drive that with the turn to long-on"
"full on middle stump, gets nicely forward to drive to mid-on"
"he's been using that floaty leg-stump yorker quite often, and it dips suddenly on Mendis, who quickly pulls his front leg out of the way to clip through square leg"
"full on off stump, driven to long-off"
"floats this one down the leg side, and Mendis, looking to sweep, can't connect - or has he? The umpire thinks so. If so, it was the merest tickle past the keeper's gloves, to bring up 2000 runs in Test cricket"
"full on off stump, jabbed back to the bowler"
"whoa, sharp turn again. Was short and close to off stump, a definite line and length for cutting, but he had to abort his shot when he saw just how much it turned, after stopping on the pitch"
"fuller now, driven to short extra-cover"
"full outside off, looks to stab that through cover point, ends up slicing it off the outside half of the bat to backward point"
"stays back to a length ball pitching on off stump, defends with the turn into the cover point region"
down the track and he gets to the pitch of this flighted off-stump ball and drives it to long-off
"low full-toss floated up outside off, driven with a strong bottom hand to long-on"
floated up slow on middle stump. Gets his front pad out of the way as he comes forward to defend with an open face to backward point
"quicker, on middle and leg, clipped to the man at short leg, Markram, who stays low to stop it"
"tossed up just outside off, driven to short extra-cover"
"there's the Kusal Mendis sweep. Leg-stump line, but the length was probably too full for the shot. Ends up yorking himself and just about jamming his bat down on top of the ball"
"flighted ball on off stump, driven inside-out to the left of extra-cover"
lovely length outside off. Karunaratne gets forward and across to defend and it dips and turns to hit inside edge and then pad
"long-hop, pitching on middle and leg and turning down leg. Stays slightly low, so Kusal crouches a little as he pulls this away to the backward square leg boundary"
"flighted ball on middle stump, gets forward and flicks this hard but straight to short leg. Smacked his left shinpad on the full"
"tossed up again, on middle and leg, clipped to the right of midwicket"
"flat, back of a length, doesn't turn and keeps going with the angle down the leg side. Karunaratne can't connect with the flick"
"there's the wrong'un. Tossed up nice and high, dips onto off stump, maybe a touch fuller than he'd like. Defended into the on side, off the inside half of the bat"
"flat on off stump, goes back and stabs it with the turn to backward point"
"tossed up slow on off stump, driven inside-out to the left of extra-cover"
"down the track now, gets close to the pitch to clip this from outside off to the man at long-on"
"shortish outside off, Mendis goes deep in his crease to slap this away to the left of Bavuma at a deepish cover point"
"full, flighted ball on middle stump. Gets his front foot out of the way to drive to the left of the fielder who's just moved back from silly point to a short mid-off, right next to the pitch. He makes the diving stop"
beauty. That's the length he wants to hit consistently. Draws Mendis forward in front of off stump and beats his defensive bat with dip and turn
"and he ends the session with a flighty full-toss. Mendis sends it to the midwicket boundary, clearing his front leg and just swatting it away"
"short, a bit of width, slapped away to the right of the sweeper at deep cover point"
"flight and dip on middle and leg, defended into the on side"
"flat length ball turning away after starting outside off, left alone"
"closer to off stump this time, Karunaratne presses forward and defends back towards the bowler"
"full on off stump, driven hard to the right of the bowler, who dives to stop it"
"length ball on middle stump, a little slower, gets forward and defends with the turn into the point region"
"back of a length on off stump, gets nicely behind it to defend into the on side"
"length ball on off stump, lets it come on and plays it with a straight bat to the right of midwicket"
"fullish, slanting away from off stump, and that's nicely controlled to bring up Sri Lanka's 100. Doesn't get that much of a stride forward or across, but his head is nicely over the ball to steer it with an open face to the right of backward point"
"bouncer, Karunaratne ducks safely under it"
"ooh, gloves it. Another short ball, this one gets up to shoulder height just outside leg stump. Swivels to hook, only gets some glove on it and manages to elude the outstretched glove of de Kock diving to his right"
"short now, on off stump, pulls this nicely down to deep square leg, rolling his wrists over at impact"
"short, wide, slapped to sweeper cover"
"back of a length, turning in from off to middle. Stays back and defends towards short leg"
"sharp turn, but it turns down the leg side after pitching on leg stump. The length is good, drawing Kusal half-forward, but the line isn't, and he can't connect with the flick"
"tossed up outside off, similar line to the one that dismissed Dhananjaya. Kusal gets a good stride out, however, and drives to extra-cover"
"what happened there? Kusal drives away from his body at one floated up outside off. Dips on him and he ends up inside-edging it hard, into the ground. Markram catches it in his midriff at short leg, and some of the South Africans begin celebrating, thinking it went to him on the full"
"fuller, on leg stump, clipped to backward square leg"
"full on off stump, shows the full face to punch it back to the bowler"
"length ball close to off stump, Karunaratne presses forward and pushes it wide of mid-off with soft hands and brings up an excellent half-century. He's looked in control right through, apart from a couple of plays and misses at a wider line"
"short outside off, steep bounce, left alone"
"length ball angling into middle stump. Kusal's initial movement was forward and across, and he had to play around his front pad to clip that square"
"looks for the yorker, gets a bit of late shape in towards middle stump. Gets his front leg out of the way and clips to midwicket"
"short, angling across the left-hander, and that's a gorgeous shot, gets right on top of the bounce - which is only chest high - and pulls from outside off stump to the midwicket boundary"
"back of a length, pitching on leg stump and spinning down the leg side, sharply past the attempted flick"
"nice length, flighted ball pitching just outside off. Gets a good stride forward and clips it with the spin to midwicket"
"nice length again, on middle stump, clipped off the front foot to backward square leg"
"full outside off, defended with the turn to midwicket"
"tossed up nicely on middle and off, clipped away to deep square leg"
"length ball on off stump, presses forward to defend into the covers"
"back of a length outside off, stands tall and punches it to the left of Bavuma at cover point"
"gone, that's No. 420! Not quite the way Steyn must have envisioned getting it. Fullish, angling into middle stump, and it stops on the batsman. Mendis looks to flick, ends up chipping it in the air, giving mid-on the dolliest of dollies"
"Steyn greets him with a bouncer, rising steeply over off stump. Mathews ducks under it, a little stiffly, bending at the waist but not at the knees"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"back of a length, fourth-stump line, and Mathews, typically, shuffles across and clips it to midwicket"
"back of a length, a little wider now, defended into the point region"
"shortish, turning from middle and off to outside off, goes deep in his crease and works it into the leg side, too close to midwicket for the quick single"
"back of a length, a touch too straight, tucked off the hips to long leg"
"full and flighted on middle and leg, driven inside-out to mid-off"
"flat length ball close to  off stump, makes Karunaratne hurry to stride forward and defend"
"nice length, some flight too, pitches on middle and leg and turns towards off. Defended back towards the bowler, making sure his front pad is out of the way"
"full on middle stump, driven to mid-off"
"oh man, he gets into a really awkward position here, Mathews. Short ball, but nowhere near the bouncer that Mathews thought it was. He was jumping and taking his eye off the ball, and it ended up bouncing only waist-high. Somehow uses his wrists to keep it down on the on side"
"back of a length close to off stump, shuffles across to tuck it to midwicket"
"short again, on off stump, Mathews pulls it round to long leg, meeting it well in front of his body"
"nice, fullish length, slanting away from the left-hander's off stump and drawing him into a defensive push away from his body. Controls it pretty well in the end, into the covers"
"back of a length on off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"fuller now, close to off stump, defended solidly back to the bowler"
"nicely played. Goes back to one that's just a fraction short of a good length, outside off, and cuts it with the turn, but backward point moves alertly to his left and dives to stop it"
"full on leg stump, and that's a <b>half-chance</b> put down by short leg. Got on the front foot and flicked it to Markram's right hand, but he couldn't quite hold on"
"another anguished shout from the bowler after beating the inside edge with his wrong'un. Dips onto a lovely length outside off as he comes forward to defend, and hits the front pad, but impact was well outside off"
"ooh, he's beginning to settle into a testing length here. Tossed up invitingly on leg stump, and Karunaratne looks to flick. Closes his bat face early and the ball pops up towards mid-on, off the leading edge"
"pitches this one on off stump and he stretches out to defend with an open face, into the point region"
"fuller and flatter, driven firmly to mid-off"
"and he strikes with the first ball of his spell. What a delivery, too. Perfect length, perfect line in the fourth-stump channel. Mathews is half-forward, playing for the inward angle, and the ball straightens and kisses his outside edge through to de Kock. Beautiful"
"Rabada greets him with a bouncer, angling slightly down leg. Roshen ducks safely underneath"
"gone, two in three balls! This is sensational bowling from Rabada. Digs it in short, gets it to rise to around shoulder height, on off stump. Roshen fends at it in defence, with hard hands, and the inside-edge is taken splendidly at short leg by Markram, who falls backwards as it comes to him at pace, at chest height"
"back of a length, angling across the left-hander towards off stump, defended back down the pitch"
"back of a length on middle stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"back of a length again, homing in on the top of off stump. Again Dickwella defends, showing the full face and sending it back into the V"
"short, wide, slapped, but there's a man sweeping at deep point to keep it down to one"
"that's not the smartest shot to play first up. Dickwella loves the sweep, but this is the googly, and he doesn't pick it. His pad was in line with the stumps, but it bounced extra, hit his glove, and then his helmet, sending the neck protection flying off the back of it"
"tossed up outside off this time, gets forward to defend"
"goes for the sweep again, this time against a quickish ball well outside off. Doesn't connect at all"
"back of a length, turns away from off stump, stabbed away towards deep point"
"ooh, beauty. Not sure Karunaratne picked the wrong'un. Lovely flight, and it dipped onto a threatening length just outside off before spinning in with sharp bounce. Karunaratne, however, was defending with soft hands, and the ball dropped down softly into the leg side off the inside edge"
"given! Rabada is on fire here. Dickwella has reviewed, however. He was playing across his front pad there... This one's angling across the left-hander from over the wicket, and it beat the <i>outside</i> edge as Dickwella closed his bat face early, looking to clip through wide mid-on or midwicket. Hit the back pad, and it looked like it was heading towards off stump. Was it full enough to pitch in line? Nope. It pitched outside leg stump, and Rod Tucker has to overturn his lbw decision"
"oh man. Dickwella is really on edge here. Digs this in short, and Dickwella ducks hurriedly, only halfway, and ends up heading the ball with the top of his helmet. Ouch. Took his eye off it, and it may have bounced less than expected - or he simply didn't read the length right"
"back of a length on middle stump, defended into the on side"
"back of a length outside off, and that's nicely played, opens his bat face to steer it through backward point"
"another bouncer, rising over Karunaratne's back shoulder. He thinks of hooking, and decides against it at the last moment"
"full, too straight, clipped off the toes to the fine leg boundary"
"there's that Dickwella sweep again. Goes hard at it, at a flighted length ball outside off, and is early on it. Top-edge flies over the keeper, and slip, stretching out and leaping to his right, can't get his fingertips to it either"
"tossed up outside off, gets a nice stride out and eases a drive to the right of extra-cover"
"full, in the blockhole almost, on leg stump. Gets his feet out of the way and clips to mid-on"
"gone, that's a sensational catch from de Kock! Or is it? Umpire Reiffel is unmoved. <b>South Africa have reviewed</b> this. Lovely flight and dip close to off stump, and Dickwella doesn't get a proper stride in, is drawn to defending well in front of his body. Sharp turn and bounce, and it's beaten the outside edge by a distance. De Kock took that beautifully, turning side-on to take it with both hands near his left shoulder"
"ooh, Shamsi has settled on a beautiful length in his last two-three overs. Pitches leg, misses off narrowly. Flight, dip, turn, bounce, beats Dickwella's forward defensive comfortably. Again, barely any forward stride"
"when in doubt, sweep, even if it means sweeping a full ball off middle stump. That's Dickwella's philosophy against spin. Manages to middle it to the man at deep backward square leg"
"back of a length, fifth-stump line, defended to point"
"back of a length, angling into middle and off, clipped away through midwicket"
"short, gets up to shoulder height on off stump. Swivels and rolls his wrists over to play a superbly controlled pull out to deep square leg"
"Another bouncer, rising over middle stump, and not rising particularly high. This inconsistent bounce makes the bouncer such a weapon. Karunaratne compresses himself into the smallest of targets, crouching super-low, and manages to get under it"
"loses control of this one, slants it waaay outside off stump, and the umpire signals wide"
"short, a bit of width, and Karunaratne uses the angle across him and plays a nicely controlled square-cut past the man at backward point. With a quicker boundary, he might have been batting on 85 by now"
"short again, this time it stays slightly low, chopped down to backward point"
"shortish, lots of width, takes a big step back and across and plays a deft late-cut to the right of backward point"
"nice length, pitching on off and turning away, stretches out to defend into the covers"
"too much turn, I think. The wrong'un, and it cramps Karunaratne for room as he goes back and across to work it into the leg side. Not the biggest of lbw appeals, he knew it was going down leg"
"another googly, pitching outside off, defended into the covers"
"lovely length on off stump, draws him forward to defend into the on side"
"short, pitching on middle stump, and it deserved to be pulled to the boundary, but it spun more sharply than Karunaratne may have bargained for, and beat his bat easily. May have also stopped on the pitch - it looked like he was early on the shot"

"very full on off stump, jabbed back towards the bowler"
"lovely. Draws Karunaratne forward again to play that wide line, but this one dips and drops much shorter than the batsman expects and spins past the outside edge"
line slips down the leg side now and Karunaratne sweeps to the right of the fielder at deep backward square leg
"length ball on middle and leg, defended towards mid-on"
"down the track, ends up almost yorking himself off a fairly quick one on off stump. Clipped to midwicket"
"nicely flighted outside off, turns in from a good length. Defended into the on side"
a bit fuller and Dickwella gets forward to drive with the turn to long-on
"nicely played. Saw this was slower, with more flight, outside off, and stretched out quickly before waiting and scooping it with the turn into the fine-leg region"
"quicker now outside off, saw Karunaratne looking to step out, defended into the covers"
"more flight now, outside off, driven to sweeper cover"
"tossed up even wider, and Karunaratne gets a good stride in to drive against the turn, squarer than the previous one, to the right of extra-cover"
"lovely flight again, on leg stump, opens up Dickwella and makes him play across the line, looking for wide mid-on. Dips and turns to find the leading edge, rolls into the covers"
"superb, beats the outside edge this time. Dip and turn again, this time outside off, and Dickwella's lack of a front-foot stride makes him play a long way in front of his body"
"a bit closer to off stump and Dickwella sweeps, out into the deep midwicket region"
"this is an excellent over, an excellent spell. Quicker delivery, close to off stump, and the pace pins Karunaratne on the crease while defending, and it spins sharply past his edge again"
"slower now, outside off, driven down to mid-off"
"full outside off, quicker, Karunaratne defends into the backward point region"
"tossed up outside off, driven into the covers"
"ooh, the reverse-sweep. Picks the right line for it, a flighted ball well outside off, and slaps it against the turn to the left of Amla diving from slip"

"quicker now, on off stump, goes back hurriedly and defends"
"flighted again, outside off, and out comes the sweep into the long-leg region"
"back of a length outside off, Karunaratne takes a big step back and across and clips to midwicket"
"shortish outside off, opens his bat face and steers it with the turn through point"
"Shamsi strikes again, his second wicket. It was coming, he had been threatening Dickwella's outside edge repeatedly over the last few overs. Gets it to dip on him again, and the lack of a front-foot stride hurts Dickwella, presses half-forward to defend this one just outside off, and the outside edge is easily pouched by Amla at slip"
"given! Big lbw appeal first ball, and it certainly struck Dilruwan in line, I think. Pressed forward to defend and the ball turned past the inside edge and hit front pad. <b>Dilruwan has reviewed this</b>. Pitched outside off, turned in sharply. Impact in line but ball-tracking says it would have missed leg stump. Reiffel will have to overturn his decision. Turned sharply, this, and Dilruwan got a big stride in."
"shortish now, pitching on middle and leg and turning down leg. Skids on quicker than Dilruwan expects as he goes back to pull, and it hits him on the thigh pad"
"flighted ball on off and middle, clipped down to long-on"
"back of a length on the pads, tucked away to deep square leg"
"and he strikes first ball! Dilruwan presses forward to a delivery of excellent length in the fifth-stump channel, and pokes away from his body as the ball leaves him off the pitch. De Kock takes the edge one-handed, reacting late to it and just about sticking his glove out at the last moment. He ends up with a dazed look on his face"
"length ball slanting across the left-hander, pitching on off stump and angling further away, left alone"
"back of a length on off stump, defended to short extra-cover"

"nice leave, fullish length and not too far from off stump, but he trusts the angle and flourishes his bat high over his head"

"nicely tossed up close to off stump, defended back towards the bowler"

"a touch short again, this time he waits a little longer and plays a little later to find the gap to the right of backward point"
"tossed up on off stump, gets a good stride forward to defend into the covers"
"floated up down leg, swept along the ground towards long leg. Dragged it off the inside half of the bat, I think"
"short, and Karunaratne pulls it from just outside off stump, to the left of midwicket"
"shortish on leg stump, and Herath swivels to whip it away to deep square leg. He loves this whippy pull"
"length ball slanting into the fifth-stump channel, straightens slightly but not enough to make Karunaratne play"
"back of a length, straightens slightly off the seam towards off stump. Karunaratne looks to defend from a half-forward position, and the ball rolls into the leg side off the inside edge"
aborted appeal for lbw as Karunaratne plays down the wrong line looking for the straight drive. Thick inside edge into pad. May have straightened slightly off the seam
again he finds that little bit of movement. This one is slanting into the fourth-stump channel and Karunaratne looks to push it into the covers. Ends up sending it rolling through square leg off the inside edge
"full on off stump, defended to mid-off"
tossed up on off stump and Karunaratne spots an opportunity. Clears his front leg and hoicks it against the turn to the wide long-on boundary
"a little quicker and fuller, drives towards mid-off and the bowler moves quickly to intercept"
"oh no, bad call from Karunaratne. Full on leg stump, and he clips to mid-on and calls Herath through for a risky single. Herath reacts a little late - to be fair to him, the single was never on - and the fielder, Philander, throws to the keeper's end. Herath is nowhere near the crease when de Kock whips off the bails"
"shortish, turning down leg. Can't connect with the flick off his hip"
"tossed up outside off, drives it hard, away from his body, but straight to mid-off"
"big appeal for lbw, and Paul Reiffel says no. Looked pretty close to me. A quickish delivery seeming to straighten from wicket to wicket, and Lakmal had no time to get any real stride in. South Africa have a review left but they don't use it. Pitching off, striking him in front of middle stump, hitting the inside of leg stump - poor decision from Reiffel, and South Africa should have reviewed it."

makes himself a lot of room to try and slap through the covers. Philander bowls a good-length ball on middle stump and all he manages is an inside-edge past leg stump

low full-toss on off stump and he flicks it to midwicket and sets off hurriedly before being asked (rightfully) to turn back
"there it is! A lovely way to bring up a magnificent hundred. Tossed up nice and full on middle stump, and he shows the full face to beat the stumps at the other end. The ball somehow goes all the way too, a rare sight on this deathly slow outfield"

"shot! But it might just have gotten him out. Dean Elgar is unsure whether he's caught this cleanly coming in off the cover boundary, and they're going up to check. The soft signal is out. Rabada saw Karunaratne backing away from leg stump and banged it in short, following him. Still had just enough room to play an airborne horizontal-bat slap. Elgar runs in and takes it low, diving forward. Seems to catch it cleanly enough but has he lost control of it while he tumbles over? Replays are unclear, mostly, but the third umpire has flashed 'not out' on the screen."

"gone! Elgar's technique - bat coming down from gully to mid-on - has cost him here. Fairly full, angling in towards middle stump. Opens up and plays across it, looking to play towards mid-on, and the ball spins, takes the outside edge, and settles in the hands of first slip"
"full on off and middle, clipped to the right of mid-on and he calls nice and early for the quick single. A bit of a fumble, but the single was on anyway"
"length ball turning into off stump, defended with soft hands into the on side"
"lovely flight and dip wide of off. Stretches forward and across to defend and doesn't get anywhere near the pitch of it. Turns in and catches the inside edge, rolls away through midwicket"
"full on off stump, clipped to midwicket"
"tossed up outside off, driven to long-off"
"goes back to a length ball spinning away from off stump, defends with soft hands and the outside edge rolls gently into the point regio"
a bit slower and he draws Bavuma half-forward to defend with the turn into the off side
"lovely. Tosses this up and gets it to drift in towards off stump. Bavuma goes for the inside-out drive and ends up hitting it back to the bowler, with the drift making him hit it with the insdie of his bat face"
"fullish outside off, defended into the covers"
"dangled up wide of off stump, driven to cover point. Bavuma's eagerness to drive will make Herath quite happy, I think"
"ooh. Length ball turning in towards middle stump. Amla flicks it across his front pad, and the ball flashes past Dhananjaya at leg gully, just to his left"
"tossed up outside off, defended into the covers"
"skips out of his crease now, clips it from outside off to mid-on, and has to be sent back by Amla after starting to charge down looking for the single"
beauty. Drifts away slightly and keeps going away from the batsman after pitching. Goes back to defend and it beats his outside edge comfortably
"tossed up higher and closer to off stump, stretches out to defend"
"tossed up wide of off, looks to sweep and is defeated by lack of turn. Hits him in the midriff"
"length ball outside off, defended into the covers"
"a bit of drift in towards off stump, fairly full, defended into the off side"
"floated up wider, driven firmly into the covers"
"tossed up slow on off stump and Bavuma gets a positive stride forward and sweeps. Decisive footwork there, and he beats backward square leg easily to his left"
"tossed up wider still, looks for the drive through cover point but goes a little early at it and drags it to extra-cover"
"flighted ball on middle stump and this is risky - sweeping right off the stumps - but he middles it again and gets four, into that same gap to the left of backward square leg"
"down the track now to the flighted ball outside off, and gets close to the pitch and lofts this nicely over the non-strikers head"
"continues to flight it, a little closer to off stump, and he presses forward to defend into the on side"
"there's that straighter one again, floating away with some drift, and he goes back and defends in front of off stump"
"down the track again, and this time the line's slightly wider and he lofts it over mid-off"
"flight and dip and turn from outside off, and Amla, stretching out to defend, is beaten on the inside edge, but he's got his pad outside the line"
"a touch fuller outside off, defended into the cover point region"
"gets his feet all in a tangle. Goes back to a full one outside off, turns quite sharply as he defends, and the edge drops down to the right of slip"
"the sweep again, from just outside off. Controls it nicely and gets a single to the left of backward square leg"
"floated up outside off, defended with an open face into the point region"
"flighted ball on middle and leg, defended into the on side"
"again that middle-stump line, a bit of drift in too. Quite full, and he clips it to mid-on"
"length ball on off stump, Amla eases it with an open face to the right of backward point. After those two middle-and-leg balls, he didn't really get his front foot across to this one, and played slightly away from his body. It's this kind of subtle thing that Herath excels in doing"
"length ball outside off, gets forward and defends with soft hands, with the turn"
looks to step out but this time there isn't so much flight and he doesn't have the time to get to the pitch. Jabbed back to the bowler
"length ball turning in towards off stump, uses his wrists to clip it to midwicket"
"tossed up slightly wider, defended back towards the bowler"
"flatter, angling into middle stump and turning in further. Clipped to short leg off the back foot"
tossed up slower on middle and off. Comes forward and defends to short leg
"not this one. Goes back to a length ball straightening towards off stump, blocks to short cover"
"slightly slower, turns away slightly from off stump. Only half-forward, manages to defend it into the covers"
"ha, brilliant bowling. Tossed it up much wider, with a lot more overspin than usual, and beats his flashy drive with turn and bounce"
"fuller now, on middle stump, clipped to mid-on"
"tossed up wide of off stump, driven to point"
"flatter, round-arm, angling into off stump. A touch short and Bavuma is able to go back and work this to the right of midwicket"
"tossed up outside off, pretty full, defended back to the bowler"
steps out a touch too early and Dilruwan bowls a flat one turning into the pads. Flicked to backward square leg
"flatter again, turns in sharply from outside off. Beats Amla's back-foot flick by a long way and hits pad, but it's easily missing leg stump"
"slower now, lots of turn again, and Amla's front-foot flick is beaten this time. Hits pad again, though once more it's sliding down leg"
"goes for the sweep and misses, and that's a big lbw appeal. Not given, not reviewed. Did that hit him in line with off stump or just outside?"
"big appeal for a catch at short leg, and Paul Reiffel is unmoved. Sri Lanka have reviewed this... Was looking to step out, I think, and Dilruwan fired it in flatter on middle stump. Only manages a half-step forward as this spins in sharply, and aims a hurried flick at it. Ultra Edge shows a spike as it passes his glove. Hits pad and pops up for short leg to gobble up. Amla will have to walk back now."
"Is this two in two? Big appeal for a catch at slip, not given by Rod Tucker, and Sri Lanka have reviewed again. Stretches out to defend one that spins less that expected, from outside off, and the ball goes past inside edge - replays confirm this - and pops off the pad to Mathews at slip. Ball tracking says it would have hit the stumps but impact was outside off. Faf survives"
"big appeal again as this one comes in with the angle and beats his back-foot defensive. Was sliding down leg. Or was it? Maybe Sri Lanka should have reviewed this one, because ball-tracking says it would have hit leg stump"
"full outside off, left alone"
"there's the sweep again, just to the left of backward square leg"
"length ball on off stump, defended into the on side"
"length ball outside off, defended into the covers"

"goes back to a quickish length ball on off and middle, jabs it away to the left of short leg"
"shortish outside off, cuts it to backward point"
"fuller now, outside off, defended gently into the vacant cover region - that's the danger of bowling with six on the leg side, but he's getting enough turn to allow it"
"down the track to this middle-stump ball, clips it in the air, just out of reach of short midwicket diving to his left"
"tossed up, spinning in towards off stump. Good decisive stride forward from Faf to sweep this hard and square"
"turns this down the leg side, Bavuma aborts his flick"
"bowled him, the sweep has cost Bavuma in the end. Tossed up fairly wide of off, perhaps too full to sweep. Ends up dragging it into his stumps off the bottom edge"
"short, wide, the first bad ball of the morning, chopped away to the left of backward point"
"full on off stump, eased away to sweeper cover - the fielder dropped back there after that previous short ball"
"tossed up on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"turns down the leg side now, du Plessis lets it go past to the keeper, who fumbles it"
"ooh, drifts in and continues with the angle towards off stump. Stays back, and he's a little late on his defensive jab into the on side"
"tossed up outside off, gets forward to block it back to the bowler"
"yikes, plays away from his body in defence, looking for turn away from outside off. Doesn't turn, and the inside edge rolls into the leg side"
"fuller, defended back to the bowler"
"down the track now, and is that caught at slip? Nope, just a lot of turn and bounce. Flighted outside off, QdK doesn't reach the pitch of it, tries to play against the turn and whip it from outside off. Misses, the ball jumps over his edge and into Mathews' hands at slip"
"oh man, QdK has looked on edge right through, and now he's bowled, the ball spinning past the outside edge of his front-foot defensive and crashing into his off stump. Drifts into middle and off, and turns to hit off stump. QdK plays slightly across it, looking to defend that towards mid-on, and opens up in the process. They check Dilruwan's foot to see if he overstepped, and oh man, it's close - to me, it looked like his foot landed right on top of the white line, with no part of his heel behind, but the third umpire has deemed it a legal delivery"
"full on off stump, defended off the front foot"
"tossed up slow and full on off and middle, driven to mid-off"
"tossed up a little wider outside off, still too full to trouble Faf. Doesn't have to get too far forward to smother it"
"length ball turning in towards off stump, goes back and jabs into the covers. Was slightly cramped for room there"
"back of a length, only marginal turn after slanting across to off stump, defended off the back foot"
"a touch short again, slapped hard, into the ground, to the right of Herath in the covers"

"a bit fuller, defended with soft hands and the ball rolls towards short leg"
"goes back to a length ball turning towards leg stump, tucks it away to the left of leg gully"

"jumps up from just back of a length, outside off, and Philander, going back and across to defend, and gets a thick inside edge that balloons up off thigh pad. Doesn't carry to short leg, though, as he dives forward and to his left"
"full on leg stump, clipped away to the left of leg gully"
"floated across the right-hander, wide of off. Gets forward and across and eases it into the backward point region with an open face"
"flighted and full on leg stump, clipped to midwicket"
"goes back to a length ball turning into middle stump, clips it hurriedly to leg gully. Was playing around his front pad there"
"the wrong'un. Floated across, pitches outside off and spins further away, left alone. Dickwella needlessly rips the stumps out of the ground. No danger of Philander dragging his back foot out there"
quickish length ball pitching on off stump and straightening in. Defended into the on side
"back of a length outside off, shuffles back and across to defend, and the ball spins past his inside edge and hits back pad. Impact outside the line, though"
"now he beats the inside edge of his forward defensive, but again he's got that front pad outside the line"
"ripping turn once more, Faf just leaves it after coming forward to try and work it leg-side. Pitched on middle stump and Dickwella took it a long way down the leg side"
"back of a length, not as much turn this time, towards off stump. Goes deep in his crease and uses his wrists to play it down in front of short leg"
quickish length ball turning in towards off stump. Gets forward and defends with soft hands
"full on off stump, clipped to straight midwicket"
"wrong'un, pitches a long way down the leg side, though, and Philander needlessly aims a flick at it. He's lucky he misses. Off the pad to leg gully"

"flat length ball speared across to off stump, defended back down the pitch"
"on the pads now, clipped to the right of midwicket"
"beautifully flighted, dips on off stump as Philander stretches out to defend. Spins sharply past the inside edge, onto pad. Too sharply to elicit an lbw appeal"
"fuller, clipped into the square leg region"
"flat, back of a length, not much turn. Goes back and flicks it from middle stump through square leg"
"back of a length again, spinning in towards off and middle. Goes back and across and works this to backward square leg"

"drifting into the right-hander from around the wicket, the batsman takes a small stride forward and defends"
a small press forward and a straight bat to block
"opens the face slightly to slice the drive into the covers, Herath is keeping it wicket to wicket"
defended into the off side

nudged into the leg side for a single
"tossed up outside off, driven off the front foot towards point"
Philander presses forward and closes the face to push into the leg side
defended watchfully on the front foot into the off side
"that's the one that turns back into the right-hander and the bounce nearly does Philander in, he came forward and pushed at the ball with a gap between bat and pad, and the ball went right through it, thankfully for South Africa it missed the stumps"
"played into the ground and back to the bowler, who jumps to catch it"
"once again a single off the final ball, off a push into the off side on the front foot"
"darted into middle stump from over the wicket, defended on the front foot with bat close to front pad"
"an appeal, for lbw presumably, was it pad first? There definitely was bat on it as Philander pressed forward to defend. No review taken. It was pad first! Replays show it would have hit middle of middle. Philander escapes"
"loops into the right-hander from over the wicket, the ball pitching out of reach of the front foot defence and the ball spinning away to beat the outside edge"
"fuller and straighter, driven back to the bowler"
played back to the bowler once again

"gets down on one knee, the front pad outside off, and sweeps behind square"
"drives hard but mis-times the shot, mid-off is deep though and there's a single available"
defended on the front foot on the off side
"fuller length on middle and leg, plays the on-drive to mid-on"
a bit too full to cut off the back foot and the bottom edge bounces into the ground and to first slip
"another huge appeal for lbw, much more confident this time, and up goes the finger! Philander reviews. The question again is whether it is pad or bat first as he tried to cut off the back foot. It was definitely pad first. But now the impact? Looks outside off? It is outside off. Paul Reiffel will have to overturn his decision. The ball was missing off as well."
"pitches on middle, short of a length and spins towards off, Philander stays back and works the ball on the leg side"
"steps a long way out of his crease and then has to offer defence as he's beaten in the flight, the ball thuds off his front pad"
"cut off the back foot towards point, who is a bit deep"
defended on the front foot with bat close to front pad
"pins into the right-hander, defended from the crease with bat in front off pad and the ball squirts towards short leg off the inside edge"

"punched off the back foot through the covers, nicely timed too but this outfield is a bit slow"
"a stride forward and a push into the covers, quick single, this time the throw is at Philander's end and he gets into a tangle as the ball hits his pads, he was home safely though"

"a touch shorter on off stump, punched to cover point"
"tossed up slow on middle stump, stretches out and blocks"
"ooh, skids on with the angle, and Faf is caught on the crease a little. Round-arm, slides on towards middle and off, and Faf is only half forward in defence. Inside edge goes past short leg, on the bounce"
"length ball on middle stump, defended off the back foot"
"ooh, goes for the sweep and misses, and the ball <b>narrowly misses off stump</b>. Tossed up and it dips shorter than Faf expects, on an off stump line, but doesn't quite straighten enough to hit the stumps"

"flighted ball on middle stump, clipped to midwicket"
"goes back to a length ball straightening towards off stump, deep in his crease, and defends solidly"

Reiffel raises his finger, Philander reviews after consulting with Faf. Pitches on off stump, hitting off stump, according to ball-tracking"
"tossed up on off stump, gets forward to defend"
"flighted ball, drops onto a good length outside off, defended with the turn into the covers"
"bowled him! Lakmal threatened this mode of dismissal even in his previous over, and now manages it. Beautiful delivery, pitches on the perfect length outside off to catch du Plessis half-forward in defence, and nips in to hit the top of off, after going between bat and pad. Du Plessis had been inside-edging a few, playing slightly outside the line, and now he misses one altogether"

"length ball angling into off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"bouncer, angling in and rising over off stump, Rabada ducks awkwardly under it. Clearly a big effort ball from Lakmal, he's overstepped by six inches"
"bowled him. Left-hander, right-hander, doesn't matter who he's bowling to, he'll hit the top of off stump. Angles this in from wide of the crease, and Rabada feet stay stuck to the crease in defence, his bat comes down at an angle, not close enough to his body to account for the angle, and it's past the inside edge and bye bye. They check Lakmal's front foot, and his heel may have been juuuuuuuust behind the back of the crease when it landed. Benefit of doubt, I think"
length ball pitching on middle and straightening slightly. Goes on the back foot to defend

"and that is it. Length ball close to off stump, straightens slightly. Steyn clears his front leg and goes for a big hoick, and only manages to send a thick edge to first slip"

"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"fuller now, on off stump, Mendis stretches out to defend"
"big appeal, and it's given! Again he's gone past the outside edge, this is brilliant bowling. Slower and flightier than the one that got Dhananjaya, and it's struck Mendis' back pad in front of middle stump as he's pressed forward to defend, opened up by the inward angle. Mendis has reviewed Paul Reiffel's decision, and the one big question is, has it pitched in line? Yup, in line with leg stump, and Mendis has to walk back for a duck"

"full-toss on off stump, whips it away firmly but too close to midwicket"

"line shifts onto the stumps now, stretches out to defend into the on side"
"big shout for lbw as he goes back and across to defend. Sharp turn from outside off, but was he struck in line? Not given out, not reviewed. Let's see. I think he was struck in line, but it turned too far to be hitting the stumps"
"length ball turns into middle and leg, clipped to short leg"
"back of a length outside off, doesn't turn. Karunaratne is deep in his crease, is able to read the natural variation off the pitch and push gently into the covers to pick up the single that takes him to another outstanding fifty"

"tossed up on middle and leg, defended back down the pitch"

"tossed up wider still, padded away again"
"down the track now, and that's a brilliant shot, against the turn. The footwork got him right to the pitch to drive that down the ground, to the left of mid-off"
"down the track again, not quite close enough to the pitch of it to go hard at his drive. Checks it and plays it back to the bowler instead"

"full outside off. Roshen didn't get enough of a stride across to drive it through cover, ends up dragging it back to the bowler, along the ground"

"bouncer rising high over off stump, Roshen sways out of the way"
"nice length on middle stump, defended towards short leg"

"back of a length, angling into off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"this one goes the other way, a slight bit of movement away after pitching on a good length outside off. Throws his hands at it, away from his body, and the thick edge flies to the third man boundary. No gully - could have been interesting had there been one"

"tossed up slow, close to off stump, defended with the turn"
"length ball on off stump, defended to silly point"
"gone, is it? Did it carry to slip? Lovely flight, angling into middle and leg, and the angle opened up Roshen as he came forward to defend, aiming towards mid-on. Dipped and spun to take the outside edge, but fell just short of Amla tumbling to his left"

"oh man, that was <b>nearly bowled!</b> He got Dhananjaya with a similar ball in the first innings. Floats it across Roshen, pitches it outside off, and gets it to dip and turn back in. Looks to whip it with the turn, leaves a big gap between bat and pad, and it spins through that gap and bounces over off stump"
"length ball outside off, defended towards backward point"

"back of a length on off stump, gets on his toes and defends downwards into the pitch"
"there's the breakthrough, and it comes in unfortunate manner for Roshen Silva. Run-out at the non-striker's end. It's gone up to the third umpire, but it's pretty straightforward. A full one from Rabada, outside off, and Mathews drives it hard, back down the ground. Wasn't actually heading towards the stumps - more mid-offish - but Rabada gets down to stop it and ends up deflecting it onto the stumps with his right hand. Roshen is a good way out of his crease when the bails come off"
"ooh, a little risky. Short outside off, and extra bounce causes his back-foot slap to go in the air, but into the gap to point's left"
"short again, some width. Stops on Mathews a little and his attempted punch through the covers ends up going to mid-off"

"short again, on off stump, this one doesn't rise up that high and he defends to short extra"
nice change-up. Slants this full and a long way wide of off stump and Dickwella throws his bat at it and misses. Steyn gives him a sardonic half-smile
"back of a length outside off, keeps slightly low, squeezes it into the cover point region and sets off for a quick single. Has to hurry because Bavuma moves like a flash to his right from point"
"short, gets up to chest height, manages to ride the bounce and keep it down gently"
"length ball, angling into top of off. Looks to drive through cover without really moving his feet, ends up hitting it into the leg side with the inside half of his bat"
"short, angling down leg, and the line allows Dickwella to easily help it away to the fine leg boundary. Long leg was fairly square, so he had no chance of stopping it"

fullish outside off and Dickwella leans forward and opens his bat face to steer it to the left of third man
"beautifully bowled, and Dickwella has to go. The threat of the short ball freezes his front foot, and Rabada angles a fullish delivery into the fourth-stump channel and gets it to straighten away. Ends up having to reach in front of his body to drive it, and gets a healthy edge through to de Kock, who takes it falling to his left"
"length ball angling into middle stump, tucked away through square leg"
"big appeal as Dilruwan pads up to one that comes back in sharply from outside off. Given out immediately, and I don't think Dilruwan is reviewing this. 150 Test wickets for Rabada! He wasn't offering a shot, so it doesn't matter if the impact was outside off stump. One doubt I have is the height - we'll have to wait for ball-tracking for that. Impact outside off, and it's comfortably hitting off stump"

"short, a bit of width, cut away to the right of third man"

"back of a length outside off, Lakmal has a waft at it and misses. Was neither trying to defend nor attack"
"fullish, angling into the batsman, and he plays across his front pad and prompts a big lbw appeal from Steyn. Not given, and you can see why - it was easily missing leg stump"
"full on off stump, stays on the back foot - probably mindful of that short leg fielder - and shuffles across to clip to mid-on"
"back of a length on off stump, defended to mid-on"
"fullish on off stump, defended into the covers. Could have taken a single off both balls of the over so far, but he's refused them, understandably. Both fast bowlers have been on since the first over of the day, so it shouldn't be long before they go out of the attack"
"good ball, angling into off stump and straightening from a good length. Extra bounce too, as Mathews presses forward to defend. The edge falls short of gully, however, with Mathews dropping his bottom hand"
"full on off stump, clipped to the right of mid-on. Takes the single now"
"ooh. Short, angling into off stump. Lakmal hops across and looks to tuck it into the leg side. Closes his bat face too early and the ball pops in the air, but safely to the left of Bavuma, who's at a very short cover"
"into the rib cage, and he jumps up and tucks it to long leg. Have they taken the single? Looks like it. Strange. The lead is past 300 anyway"

"short, angling into the body but only getting up to waist height. Pulled away to long leg"
"back of a length on off stump, shuffles across to clip towards midwicket"
"shortish in the corridor, punched to the left of deep extra cover - pretty much everyone is back on the boundary"
"back of a length outside off, and Lakmal is either beaten or he's left this skillfully, pulling his bat back inside the line. I suspect the former"

"flighted wide of off, Lakmal looks to drive away from his body and misses"
"sharp turn and bounce from outside off, beats Lakmal as he goes back to work it leg side. Hits high on the thigh pad and pops up to the right of slip"
"flat, fairly full, angled into off stump, defended off the front foot"
"flighted slower on off stump, and Lakmal miscues the big hit. Wanted to go over mid-off, ends up slicing it over the bowler instead, and it falls to ground 2/3rds of the way to the rope"
"full on leg stump, clipped wide of mid-on"
"tossed up close to off stump, defended with soft hands to the left of short extra"
"flighted ball on off stump and Mathews puts it away brilliantly. Steps away from leg stump to make some room, and lofts it gloriously over the extra-cover boundary"
"slow flight on middle stump. Gets his front pad away from the line to defend, and edges it towards backward point as it dips and spins away sharply. Played with soft hands, though, so the ball rolled along the ground all the way"
"tossed up very full outside off, doesn't have the leverage to drive so he jabs it back towards the bowler"
"floated up on off stump, snatches too hard at this attempted big hit and sends it rolling along the floor to mid-on, dragging it off the inside half of the bat"
"full again, on off stump, but a bit quicker. Blocked back to the bowler"
tossed up on off stump and now Lakmal makes some room and flat-bats it to the left of extra-cover. Not the most hurried running from Mathews - they could have taken three otherwise
"flighted ball on leg stump, defended to short leg"
"tossed up wide of off, may have been the googly. Reaches out and flat-bats to extra-cover"
"full on middle stump, blocked into the on side"
"looped up high outside off, Mathews thinks of driving but has to check himself because of the dip. Pushes it back to the bowler instead"
"got him. The arm ball, sliding in and hitting middle stump. Mathews cleared his front leg for the slog sweep, and once he missed, there was nothing to interrupt the ball's path towards the stumps"
"tossed up nicely outside off, stretches out to block it back to the bowler"
"there's the Herath reverse-sweep. Picked the right line for it, outside off, but was a little late on the shot and made no contact - the ball was probably a little too full for it. Beats the keeper as well"
"floated across to off stump, good stride forward to block into the covers"
"lbw appeal from Shamsi as Lakmal presses forward to defend and plays down the outside. Dipped and pitched on middle and leg, so probably missing leg stump"
"tossed up on off stump now and he clears his front leg to whack it down the ground, between the non-striker and the umpire"
"another big appeal, another not-out decision from Rod Tucker. This time <b>South Africa have reviewed</b>. Similar to the previous one, but the line looked more promising... Pitches on or just outside off, and beats the inside edge as he presses forward to defend. Pitches on off stump, hits in front of middle, and bounces over and misses leg stump, according to ball-tracking"
"flatter, and this looked like the wrong'un. Extra bounce as Herath played across it, looking to hit it to mid-on from outside off, and it hits him on the glove"
"sweeps from the stumps, misses, and Rod Tucker immediately raises his finger. Herath has reviewed now. It was too full and flat to sweep, I think, and the ball has sneaked under his bat. Decent stride forward, but he opened himself up, and it's hit him on the back thigh as a result. Three reds - pitching on leg stump, hit him on the back leg in front of middle and leg, and going on to hit off stump - and Herath will have to walk back"
"tossed up outside off, smart stride forward to defend to mid-off"
""
"short outside off, slapped to deepish point"
"tossed up on middle stump and that's nicely done. Cleared his front leg, knew there was no one back at long-on or deep midwicket, and launched this over wide mid-on"

"tossed up outside off, drops onto a nice length. Presses forward and blocks into the point region"

"flights it now, outside off, and Lakmal clears his front leg to flat-bat between the umpire and the non-striker, Mid-off was up saving the single"
"looks to make room and drive inside-out but the ball dips on him and hits his pad. Pitched on leg stump, so no way that's hitting any stump in this city"

"fuller now, driven to deepish mid-off"
"back of a length, spinning down leg, Sandakan can't connect with his flick"
"back of a length outside off, punched to long-off"
"full on middle and leg, clipped to the right of midwicket"
"better length now, forces him to come forward defend an arm ball sliding on towards off stump"
"short again, gives him width too, and he cuts it away fiercely to the left of backward point. Poor, poor bowling"
"tossed up slow but a touch too full on off stump, defended off the front foot"
"floaty full-toss angling into off stump, driven to long-off"

"googly, pitches too short and outside leg stump. Clipped neatly to deep midwicket"

"bouncer, ends up losing his line and whanging it wide off stump"
"short, some width, and he opens his bat face and steers this wide of gully. Off the outside half of the bat, but it went pretty much where he intended it to go"
"digs it in short outside off and Steyn equals Pollock now. Gets up to shoulder height, and Sandakan pokes at it and offers a simple catch to the man at point"
"arm ball to start, beats Markram's attempted back-foot punch through midwicket and hits pad. Missing leg stump, though"
"another lbw appeal, another not-out decision, but this time <b>Sri Lanka have reviewed</b>. Another arm ball, this one coming in from outside off as he looks to punch into the covers. Deep in his crease, strikes him on the flap of his back pad, but impact is clearly outside off. Missing off stump too, ball-tracking says"
tossed up slow on middle stump and Markram defends towards short leg
"and again, lovely loop and dip on middle stump. Markram playing a very open forward defensive, his back foot going across towards slip and his front foot pointing to mid-on. Off inside-edge and towards backward square leg"
"this one's more on off stump, defended into the off side"
"tossed up slightly slower outside off, defended into the covers"
length ball sliding on with the angle towards middle stump. Keeps his front pad out of the way and defends into the off side

"tossed up slow and wide of off, landing in the rough. Drives away from his body and misses - didn't turn"
"flatter, closer to off stump, defended back to the bowler off the front foot"
"again that wide line attacking the rough. Dangled up slow, and Elgar sweeps - a risky shot anyway but he's also early on it. He's lucky the top-edge lands in no man's land at short fine leg, almost behind the keeper"
"on off stump, flicks and gets an inside edge to leg slip"
"full outside off, defended into the off side"
"wide outside off, left alone"

"flatter now, though not necessarily shorter, goes back and defends to short leg"
"slow flight fairly wide of off, dipping onto a good length, stretches out and defends"
big appeal for caught at leg gully. Just off pad. Didn't get anywhere near the pitch of this one turning in sharply from outside off as he stretched his front foot out. Beat the inside edge and popped up off pad
"sharp turn again, and this time he just pads it to short leg"

"ooh, beauty. Flighted ball, angles in towards off stump but dips much shorter than Markram expects as he strides forward to defend and rips past his outside edge"
"fuller, blocked back to the bowler"
down the track and he fails to reach the pitch of this one outside off. Jabbed out to cover

"length ball turning in towards off stump, defended towards mid-on"

"nice length, dips and turns in towards off stump, defended into the off side"
"a little slower and slightly wider, waits slightly longer and defends into the off side"
down the track but can't reach the pitch of this ball. Dips sharply on a middle-stump line and he clips to mid-on
"flatter length ball on middle stump, defended back down the pitch"
"gone! That's a poor choice of shot from Elgar. Ran down the pitch, ended up nowhere near the pitch of the ball. I think he just went too early, and Dilruwan bowled a flat offbreak just outside off stump, which beat his desperate attempt at lofting down the ground - he was reaching a long way in front of his body - and left Dickwella with the easiest of stumpings to complete. Wow, they belatedly show a replay of the bowler's front foot, and it's landed on the white line without any part of the heel behind. He got a wicket like this in the first innings too."

"a touch short on off stump, makes a bit of room and punches this through the covers"
flat length ball turning from off to leg. Goes onto the back foot to defend to short leg
"taken! Brilliant from Dhananjaya de Silva at leg gully. Classic offspinner's dismissal. Flight, dip, turn and bounce. Draws Amla forward to defend and he's nowhere close to the pitch of the ball as it spits at him from outside off. Inside-edge onto pad, and it pops up in the air to the left of leg gully. Dhananjaya takes a couple of quick steps to his left and completes the low, two-handed catch with a sprawling dive, From the side-on angle, you can see Amla's barely come forward. Looked like he stretched out, but his back foot was so deep in his crease that his front foot was only a foot or so in front of it"
"back of a length, spinning into leg stump, stays back and tucks it to backward square leg"
"fuller now, on middle stump, gets forward and clips to mid-on"
"ooh, beauty. Flights this slow and wide of off and Bavuma does well to go back and across, picking the length despite the loopiness of the trajectory. Then it goes with the angle rather than spinning in, and beats the outside edge"
"slider, angling into middle stump. Goes back and works it through square leg"
"down the track to the flighted ball on off stump, defended to mid-on"
"dips onto a good length on off stump and straightens, blocks it back to the bowler. Again that back foot slides across"
"full outside off, defended towards short extra-cover"
"nicely played. A bit slower than the previous one, and lands just that bit shorter, but he presses forward, waits for it, and defends under his eyes"
"down the track now and he goes for the big hit over mid-off. Doesn't get hold of it and skies it high over extra-cover, but drops down safely before anyone can turn around, chase, and get to it"
"flat on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"tossed up wider and he stretches out to defend. Gets his pad outside the line, which helps him because it spins back in and beats his inside edge"
beaten in the flight again. Stretches out to drive through mid-off and inside-edges through midwicket
"down the track now, gets close to the pitch and clips wide of mid-on"
"big shout for a caught-behind off glove. Was there any contact? Went for the sweep and it turned sharply and bounced, probably went over the top of his glove. Sri Lanka don't review"
"fuller now, outside off, gets forward for a checked drive into the covers"
"full on middle stump, defended into the covers, keeps his front pad out of the way"
"drifts in this time and keeps going with the angle towards off stump. Defended off the front foot, into the covers"
"fuller now, on middle and off, blocked again into the covers, keeping his front pad out of the way"
similar trajectory to the previous ball but wider outside off. Gets his front pad across now and defends
"well bowled, he's playing with Bavuma's front pad here. This one's a little higher in trajectory, drops on a good lenght again but a little closer to off stump. Plays for more turn than there is and inside-edges into his pad"
"more round-arm now, gets it to slide in towards off stump, defended into the covers"
"shortish outside off, chopped down into the point region"
"ooh, risky. Tossed up wide of off, inviting the cover drive. Takes the invitation and goes at it away from his body. Inside-edges towards midwicket"
"a little closer to off, reaches out to defend into the covers"
"got him! Flatter trajectory, closer to off stump, but perhaps not short enough to go back to. Rips in sharply and takes the inside edge as he looks to defend, and leg slip takes a good, sharp catch. Went straight to him but quickly, and only at knee height, and he stayed low and made it look simple"
"ooh, wow. Drifts away along a wide line outside off, pitches,and continues to go away from the batsman. Good thing he shouldered arms there"
"and now du Plessis edges one. The offbreak, turning in quickly from outside off. Plays slightly inside the line in defence and I think that <b>fell just short</b> of Mathews at slip"
"this one certainly carries. A nice, low catch at slip. Typical Herath dismissal. Nicely flighted outside off, draws Faf forward to defend, but he finds himself not near enough to the pitch of the ball to defend safely. Just enough spin away to take the edge, and Mathews does the rest"
"back of a length outside off, doesn't turn that much. Goes back and across to defend"
"down the track now to a flighted ball outside off. Closes his bat face early, looking to clip through midwicket, and gets a thick edge that runs away wide of slip"
tossed up again and he clears his front leg and sweeps it over the square leg region
"back of a length, turning in towards off stump. Goes back and across and works it towards backward square leg"
"full now, on middle stump. Gets his front leg out of the way and clips to midwicket"
"tossed up outside off, nice stride forward to defend"
the floater that continues to go with the away-drift. Back of a length outside off and he pokes it away defensively
"flighted ball on middle and off, defended into the on side"
"flat now, angling into the pads. Goes back and clips to short leg"
"flights it wide outside off, presses forward and pushes to the left of extra-cover"
"nice length, this, angling into off stump and going with the angle after pitching. Plays a bottom-handed drive that rolls towards mid-on off the inside half of the bat"
"Dickwella goes up in appeal but Herath doesn't, as this slides on with Markram on the back foot, trying desperately to flick it away. Thick inside edge into pad"
"both openers are out stumped, and Herath goes past Pollock and Steyn. Dangled up slow outside off, and Markram thinks he can jump out and reach the pitch. He doesn't, and ends up flaying desperately at it as it spins away and beats him"
flat length ball sliding on towards middle and off. Stays back and defends into the off side
"draws him forward now with flight, and it drifts in in the air and keeps going in that direction as he pushes at it with an open face. Thick inside edge to backward square leg"
"quicker now, length ball angling into off stump. Goes back to punch to mid-on"
"skids on from a middle-and-off line and Philander's feet go nowhere as he jabs at it, playing for turn. Hit on the pads but it's sliding down leg"
"there's the sweep again, from off stump, and it's just past the outstretched fingertips of Herath's right hand as he throws himself at it from backward square leg"
"tossed up full, close to off stump, blocked into the covers"
"appeal for lbw as de Kock misses the sweep against the one that goes with the angle from round the wicket. Tucker raises his finger, and de Kock reviews. De Kock is in trouble here because he didn't really get his front pad across. He cleared it slightly to make more swinging room, and that means impact must have been in line with the stumps. Let's see now... Yup, in line with off stump and hitting middle and leg. Ends the innings of someone who had no confidence in his defence"
"big appeal again as he goes back and across to defend one that rips in from outside off. Tucker shakes his head, and <b>Sri Lanka review</b>. I think it's struck him in line, but is it bouncing too much? Impact in line with middle and off, flicking the top of the leg bail, so it stays with the umpire's decision, a fair one"
"big sweep now, misses, and Dilruwan bellows out another appeal. Struck outside the line, I think"
"goes for another sweep, and the ball spins from middle stump, misses bat and clips the outside of his front pad and rolls down to the short fine-leg region. Umpire signals byes - maybe there was no pad"
"goes back to a flat length ball on middle and leg, defends to short leg"
"a little slower along the same line, gets his front pad out of the way and defends back down the pitch"
"a bit quicker, on off stump, hurries Philander into his defensive push with the turn. Had to get that pad out of the way quickly"
"down the track now, steps away from the line to try and loft over mid-off. ends up slicing it over extra-cover instead, and Dimuth, running back to his left, gets both hands to the ball but <b>can't hold on</b>."
"quicker now, fired in towards middle and leg. Goes back to whip it away through square leg"
"ooh, lovely change of pace. Slower, loopier, definitely more overspin, and it dips, turns, and bounces to comprehensively beat Philander as he reaches away from his body to defend"
"tossed up wide of off, flat-batted powerfully to the right of mid-off. A rare overpitched ball from Dilruwan"
"down the track now and this time he whips it with the turn, flat and on the bounce to deep midwicket"
"back of a length outside off, no turn, goes back to whip it to long-on"
"goes for the sweep again, and misses. It pitched outside off, and the impact was outside as well"
"sweeps again, and this time the length is slightly fuller and in his arc. Hits it hard and flat through square leg"
"back of a length, ends up just outside off stump. Goes back and chops to backward point"
"tossed up, drifts in a little from wide of the crease as Herath bowls with a lower arm. Philander pads it away and Reiffel raises his finger almost as soon as Herath appeals. <b>Philander reviews.</b> Will that hit off stump, or did it turn just enough to miss? Impact was outside off, but that doesn't matter. The degree of turn is what's important here. Turned a bit, I'm afraid, and Mr. Reiffel will have to overturn his decision"
"drifts in again, fuller and pitching on off stump. Looks to get his pad out of the way and defend and squeezes it into the on side off the inside edge"
"arm ball now, hurries into Philander off the pitch and beats him as he hurriedly plays across the line. Hits pad, but this one's certainly missing leg"
tossed up wide of off stump and now Philander skips out and launches it with the spin over long-off
"lovely length, straightening towards off stump. Defended to silly point, off the outside half of the bat"
"a slight bit quicker on a similar line, this one hits the inner half of the bat, doesn't turn as much"
"there's the five-for. It was coming, given the kind of shots Maharaj was playing. Down the track now, swings at it and hits it with the turn, straight to deep midwicket. Sandakan backtracks while taking it at chest height, and nearly overbalances over the rope, but manages to stay inside the line"
"length ball going with the angle towards off stump, defended towards mid-on"
"shorter and wider, left alone"
"flighted on leg stump, clipped off the front foot to backward square leg"
"quick and flat, pitching just outside off and turning quickly away. Defended into the covers off the back foot"
"back of a length, slides on with the angle and beats Rabada's inside edge and hits front pad. He'd opened up, though, and even the impact must have been outside leg stump"
"full on off stump, blocked to silly point"
"tossed up again, drifts in further towards off stump. Defends off the front foot and the ball rolls to midwicket off the inner half of the bat"
"another slider, this one's flatter and quicker. Goes back and blocks towards midwicket"
"appeal for a catch at silly point. Was it a bump ball? It's all happening, and it's gone to the third umpire. There's also the possibility of pad first. Soft signal is not out. He clearly defends it into the ground, and the big screen flashes not out. They don't check for whether it hit pad before bat, though - I have a feeling it did."
down the track and makes room to drive inside-out. Drift makes him inside-edge into his front pad
"another arm-ball. Curves in from outside off, pitching just back of a length. Reads the line well and leaves it alone"
"ooh, another slider from round the wicket. Plays back to a length ball and he gets a thick inside edge that bounces down to short leg as he jams down in defence"
"tossed up fuller, defended into the covers"
"good length, going with the arm again and hits front pad as he comes forward to defend. Missing leg"
"sharp turn now, from outside off. Goes back to defend and it easily beats his outside edge"
"what a follow-up! The previous one spun away from pretty much the exact same spot and Rabada was beaten, playing away from his body. He leaves this one and it just keeps going with the arm, brushes the flap of his pad and hits off stump. Beautifully bowled"
"dips onto a nice length outside off, stretches out and defends it back to the bowler"
"flighted and full, drifting into middle stump. Keeps the front pad out of the way and defends inside-out"
"fuller still, driven back to the bowler"
"another round-arm arm ball that slides in towards off stump. Stays in the crease, watches it off the pitch and defends"
"a bit fuller, comes forward and defends inside-out once more"
"that ball was coming, seeing how careful Philander was being with keeping his front pad out of the way. This is looped up wide of off stump, and Philander uses the swinging room to launch it high over mid-on"
"flatter and quicker outside off, presses forward and defends into the point region"
"strides forward to a tossed-up ball outside off, defends to the right of midwicket off the inside half of the bat. He ambles the first half of his single and has to hurry to beat the direct hit at the bowler's end"

"a touch shorter, goes back and defends gently into the cover region"
flighted ball wide of off. Gets a big stride across to defend
"tossed up a little closer to off stump, a little slower. A little early on the cover drive, ends up needing to use his wrists to keep it down"
length ball spinning in towards off stump. Gets his back foot across to cover the line and then presses forward to defend into the point region
"length ball angling in and straightening slightly towards off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"there's No. 3 for Herath. Full on middle and leg and Steyn drives a little too early, without a stable base, as he looks to pull his front pad away from the ball and bring his bat down through the line. Hits it hard, though, and Herath catches it two-handed just over his head. An excellent reflex catch"
"ooh. Full, drifting in towards off stump. Shuffles across instead of coming forward, and defends slightly outside the line. Inside-edge flies to the right of short leg"
"back of a length outside off, and Herath gets some extra bounce to surprise Philander. Shapes to cut and checks his shot as the ball gets big on him. He's lucky that pops up to the left of backward point and not straight to him"
"goes back to a length ball on off stump, defends to silly point"
"back of a length on off stump, some extra bounce again. Defends with soft hands to backward point"
"dangled up slow, outside off. Shamsi's a little late coming forward to defend, and it spins sharply to take the inside edge"
"flatter, and he shuffles across and pats it back down the pitch"
"appeal for lbw as Shamsi plays across this one in defence. Bat comes down at an angle from gully, and the ball beats outside edge to hit pad, but he'd shuffled across and the impact was outside off"
"flatter length ball, defended with the turn"
Shamsi has no idea where the ball will go. Floated across to off stump and he shuffles across to defend. Goes with the arm and beats the outside edge
shuffles again rather than come forward or back. This one turns in from just outside off and he gets an inside edge into pad
"flat, back of a length, straightening towards leg stump. Goes back to work it through midwicket"
slow length ball outside off. Shamsi shuffles across and leaves
"full, round-arm, slides down the leg side as Shamsi misses the flick"
"ooh, falls just short of silly point. Roshen dives forward as Shamsi defends one in front of his pad, bat coming down from gully. Hits the outside half of the bat and drops down towards silly point"
"shuffles across again to defend. The ball doesn't turn, passes inside edge and pops up to short leg off the pad"
"back of a length, slides on towards middle stump. Shuffles across and manages to work it behind square"
flat at the pads. Clips it on the bounce to leg gully
"slower now, pitches outside leg and spins further down, sharply. Left alone"

"down the leg side again, left alone"
back of a length wide of off. Shuffles across and defends into the point region
"doesn't come forward at all, does he? Shuffles across to a pretty full one on off stump, clips it towards leg gully"
"full, close to off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"back of a length, spins in from outside off, goes back and across to work it through square leg"
"big spin from middle and leg, turns a long way down the leg side"
"wrong'un, straightening towards middle and leg. Shamsi - he bowls left-arm wristspin too - seems to pick it, defends towards silly point"
"big appeal for lbw. Paul Reiffel isn't interested. Sri Lanka review. Shuffled across again and the bat came down from gully, as always. This was the googly, beat the outside edge of his defensive bat and hit back pad. Pitching <em>just</em> in line with off stump, straightening to strike <em>just</em> in line, and it will - according to ball-tracking - go on to hit off stump. Reiffel has to overturn his decision, and Sri Lanka win by 278 runs"
