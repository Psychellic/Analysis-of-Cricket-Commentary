"swinging into the pads, and flicked airily into the leg side, finds the gap, and that's an <B>all-run four</B> to launch the new Perth Stadium's history... which is an indication of the length of these boundaries!"
"outside off, and that's a tentative dangle as the ball curled back in at good pace. Just beat the edge"
"half forward, met on the front foot with a firm push to mid-off"
"wider line, good carry, no stroke this time"
"squared up on the back foot, poked to mid-on as Roy watches the swing onto the middle of his bat"
"that is an absolute nut. Tight line, good pace, bit of nibble as the ball bursts past Bairstow's non-committal push. Threatening"
"bashed, in the air, past point! Roy was reaching for that one, a big outswinger, very similar to his dismissal at Adelaide, but this time he finds the gap and the boundary"
"loose drive, beats the edge as Hazlewood finds more swing from a good length"
"blocked down to third man, a controlled edge to keep the scoreboard ticking"
"left alone on a good length outside off, excellent pace and bounce, gathered at head height by Paine"
"beats the edge once more, wider line, and Bairstow keeps his bat inside the line, just"
"wider line, no stroke offered"
"tight line from over the wicket, blocked back down the pitch on the front foot"
"back of a length, punched on the up into the covers"
"outside off, nibble off the seam as the ball bursts past the edge again. Roy is playing with circumspection so far, have England been chastised by their calamity in Adelaide?"
"short, and hauled through the leg side! So quick to capitalise on bowler error, that sat up and begged"
"<strong>wallop!</strong> Roy plants the front foot, as if pre-meditating the fuller length after Starc's error the previous ball. Flings the bat through the line and all the way over long-off!"
"and that is the end of that! Outside off, Roy is caught on the crease, takes the edge, a fine diving catch from Paine behind the stumps, in front of first slip <B>but hang on ... it's a no-ball!</B>"
"<B>a free hit</B> and a free swing of the bat, but no contact through to the keeper"
"outside off, nudged down through third man to get Bairstow off the mark"
"<strong>a bouncing bomb of a delivery!</strong> Outside off, swinging away, and <B>exploding</B> off the seam and over Paine's gloves! That's WACA-worthy carry!"
less dramatic carry this time as Roy leaves alone
"lift off the deck, over the top of the stumps. I said I'd reserve judgement on this new ground until I'd seen the pitch. I rather like the look of it so far..."
"onto the front foot, compactly stabbed through mid-off, where Warner fails to intercept. That races to the rope"
"<B>flogged!</B> Much more power and intent this time, a full-blooded fling of the hands, into the line of the ball and away through the covers. Roy is ticking"
"angled bat, down into the ground, through third man"
"wider line, angled across the right-hander, no stroke offered"
"battered through the line, hit on the up, very Graham Gooch in outlook, if I may say so. Clean through mid-on"
"crunched on the up, out to cover"
"on the pads, flicked out through midwicket, and timed to perfection. Roy is racing!"
"full length, looked like a slower ball, tapped to mid-on to steal a single, and the strike. Poor old Jonny is just a spectator at present"
"defended down into the crease, Bairstow is alert and jogs through for the single"
pushed into the covers
"big stride, left alone outside off stump"
"banged in short but down the leg side, we'll have that one again"
"blocked into the off side, on a good length"
"fipped off the toes, no real timing but as previously mentioned, this outfield is a belter. Two men give chase, but they can't haul it in"
"under-edged drive, past the leg stump and that's four more through fine leg. Bairstow is up and away with a bit of good fortune"
"tight line, Roy walks inside the line but can't deflect it fine enough to beat the field"
"onto the front foot, pushed back to the bowler"
"nibble off the seam, and deflected through to the cordon"
leaning forward and defended back down the pitch
"back of a length, nudged off the full face of the bat into the leg side"
"inswing, and struck on the pad... there's an appeal, not especially vociferous it has to be said, and Smith declines the review after a brief consultation"
"blocked into the leg side, another quick single"
"that's a good leave, or a brave one. Grazes past the stumps with the angle bringing the ball back into the right hander"
cracked into the covers
"width, and a gliding back-cut down to third man"
worked into the leg side
"absolutely nailed straight back down the pitch, but too straight. Splatters the stumps and takes the pace off the ball"
"drilled hard and straight, just to the side of the stumps this time, and England keep on cooking"
"pushed into the leg side, looking to get onto the front foot at all times"
"full length, attacking the stumps, defended into the covers"
"rising delivery, outside off stump, dabbed down through third man"
"flicked off the toes, out to midwicket"
"nip off the seam, climbing into the thigh pad. Some encouragement for the bowler"
"nip off the seam, and Paine is convinced there's a noise! Tye doesn't appeal, and Smith backs his bowler ... with good reason it seems from the replay"
"full length, attacking the toes, tapped into the off side"
"squeezed into the covers, watchful against the full length"
nurdled down to third man with an open face
"full once more, squeezed into the off side"
"stabbed down into the crease and <B>Bairstow reacts sharply to kick the ball away</B>! That was threatening to roll back into the timbers, but crisis averted"
"on the toes, tickled to midwicket"
stretching onto the front foot to defend
"a flashy drive, stretching onto the front foot and bashing through the line to mid-off"
stabbed defence on the front foot once more
"back and across, whipped into the leg side, and Bairstow gallops back for a non-existent second. He's brisk!"
"striding onto the front foot, and punched to cover"
worked into the off side
"ripping delivery, and there's a clear snick as the ball bounces through to the keeper! But no appeal at all, curious. Seemed to miss everything..."
"battered high in the air, and Hazlewood circles at mid-on to gather a steepling miscue! The knuckleball does the trick, Roy was deceived by the change of pace, was through his shot too soon, and an aggressive if at times streaky innings comes to an end"
tip and run and a single into the covers
solid defence outside off stump
"nudged down to third man, Hales is up and running"
pushed to leg
a big appeal but a touch too leg-sided to justify a decision
"poked back down the pitch, a touch of drift through the air to help the deception in flight"
nurdled out to the leg side
"back of a length but skidding through, Bairstow dances at the crease but can't find the gap"
chopped through third man and they scamper back for the second
jabbed into the leg side
"yorker, well directed, well dug out"
clipped on the up and out through midwicket
"checked drive, that is sweetly timed! Clean through mid-on, and that races to the rope"
"punched through the line once more, to mid-on"
"sweetly timed into the covers, picking the slower ball and guiding it into the gap"
worked off the pads to the leg side
"banged in short, and flashed up and into the covers"

blocked into the covers
swept out through the leg side
"swept again and this time he nails it, into the gap behind square"
"tight line, steered into the covers"
"fuller length, tight to off stump again, solid defence"
short and swiped out through the leg side
"forward, punched to mid-off"
"nailed through the covers! Bairstow stretches onto the front foot, presents the full face, and fillets the two fielders to race to the rope"
"banged in short, no stroke offered"
"round the wicket, lobbed up and tapped towards mid-on"
"tossed up on the stumps, Hales waits and works one through square leg"
"dances in and pushes a flat delivery on off, YJB prods it back to the bowler"
"oof, watch out by the sight screen! Boshed straight down the ground by Bairstow, leaping out to cream the ball for six - <b>and that's the England 100 up</b>, lickety-split"
darted in and nudged away square for one
"tossed up on the stumps, tapped back"
"over the wicket, hits a length around off, YJB pushes back down the track"
"good length, 138kph and punched on the up towards extra cover"
angled across and Bairstow picks out a fielder in the covers again
"full outside off, 140kph and clipped towards mid-off"
"short ball, 145kph/90mph... and helped on it's way over the third man boundary! Bit of a wafty uppercut, Zampa was down there but never in the game"
"rapped on the pads, there's a shout for lbw - but Smith indicates it was maybe high and they don't review"
"flighted, comes across on off and taps to cover"
"dobbed on the stumps, tucked into the leg side"
"darted on off stump, pushed into the off side again"
"touch short and Hales swats it through point, into a gap and they trundle back for a second"
fired in and pushed away to the off side
"makes a bit of room and whacks the ball through mid-off, gets it away for four - and England continue to motor at sixes, despite a tight over"
"bowled 'im, <b>YJB deflects the ball on to his stumps!</b> Starc makes the breakthrough, pace and zip off the pitch and Bairstow prodded with a wonky bat, trying to run it behind point but only getting an inside edge on to leg stump"
"full length, angled across at 145kph and Root has a flirt with it, a loose push to his first ball but he fortunately fails to connect"
"straighter line, slung down full and blocked to leg"
"pitched up outside off, Root eases a drive away through the covers"
"back of a length, Hales takes it on the body trying to play across the line"

"over the wicket to Hales, who drops back and slaps a cut to backward point"
"pushed in towards middle and off stump, clipped down the ground"
"drops a touch short and Root seizes on it, whirling a pull through midwicket"
"FORE! Here comes Hales, more of a pitching wedge but it sails high and long down the ground into the vacant seats by the sightscreen"
prodded back to the bowler
"slightly full on the pads, swinging in as Root flicks across the line and sends the ball racing away into the vacant green acres - though we might get another all-run four there, but Root slipped slightly coming back for the third"
"drops short, Hales opens the shoulders and carves the ball square, Maxwell does well to get fingertips on it to keep them to one"
"rising off a length, 139kph/87mph and pushed into the covers"
"full and driven, Starc gets a fingertip on it in his follow through but <b>can't quite divert it on to the stumps</b> at the non-striker's end"
"short ball, sits up like a nail to be hammered and Hales obliges, gets a couple in front of deep midwicket"
"fires in the yorker to finish, gets the bat down on it in time"
"strays on to the pads and Root skims his first boundary, leaves Hazlewood on his hands and knees at fine leg"
"good length, blocked on off stump"
"full, tailing in and nudged through midwicket for one"
"length ball around fourth stump, 130kph and dabbed down square"

"dragged short and leg side but Hales misses out with a pull, hit on the knee roll"
"floated up and drilled into the covers, where Steven Smith sticks out a velcro paw"

tossed up and pinged down the ground for one
"pushed through flat outside off, Hales sits in the crease and picks out backward point"
"fullish, tight stuff around off, Root pats it back"

"length outside off, Hales steers it square but quickly decides against running"
"dug in short, Hales pulls lazily at it... and top-edges clean over Paine's head, <i>almost</i> goes all the way!"

"full, leg-stump line, popped back to the bowler"
"flat and wide of the stumps, Hales rocks back and slaps one down to wide long-off"
"full length, maybe the googly but it barely has the chance to pitch before Root stuns it through cover point - <b>England raise the 150</b>, looking in good order"
"gets a bit of dip on this, Hales toe-ending the ball into the crease"
pushed through outside off and cut for a single to the sweeper
"short ball, Hales tries to wallop it over square leg... <b>but skews a top edge to point!</b> Think that deflected off the helmet, Australia have used <i>his</i> head and Marsh breaks the stand. There's pace in this deck, seemed to surprise Hales and he top-edged it straight into the badge"
"length, angled across from over the wicket, Morgan defends"
"touch short, 141kph from Marsh, who's tail is up, Morgan is cramped for room and blocks on leg stump"

full and wide and clunked through the covers to the sweeper for one more
"short, at the body, nudged away behind square"
"banged in and Root top-edges his pull, shouts of 'catch!' but it doesn't carry down to fine leg"
"this one carries, though - slashed over point and <b>Stoinis takes a smart grab running in off the rope!</b> Another low score in a poor series for the captain, he was trying to come down as Marsh dug in a 139kph delivery, Morgan off his feet as he swiped and perish in the deep"
"leg side, worked off the hip down to fine leg"
"short, 138kph outside off, Buttler drops the hands"

"banged in, cross seam at 136kph and it b-o-i-n-g-s over Buttler's attempted pull, Paine stretching for the take"
comes across his stumps to defend

"pitched up, taking the pace off, worked back fine of mid-on for one"
"back of a length, arrow straight, defended back down the pitch"
"clipped back down the pitch, half-stopped in the followthrough"
"slashed out through the covers, quite high on the splice and in the air for a while"
"climbing into the pull and <B>thumped under the ribcage!</B> Ouch, that's going to hurt. No dissimilar to Pietersen's cracked rib against McGrath in the 2006-07 tour. Hopefully no lasting damage on this occasion"
off line
dabbed into the off side and through they jog. Root can rest up at the non-striker's end for a moment
"short, too short, over the shoulder and out stretch the umpire's arms"
"tapped into the off side, Root was slow getting going, and Maxwell's shy <B>slides past the stumps!</B> A direct hit would have been very, very tight"

"tapped into the off side, another single to the cause"
"tapped to cover, riding the extra bounce"
"back of a length, rises sharply as Root rocks back into the pull but can't time the shot. Indicates that it is a bit two-paced"
"swinging into the toes, and tucked behind square. A bread-and-butter single"
"full, and <B>Buttler holes out to mid-off!</B> That's a critical breakthrough for Australia, Warner back-pedals to complete the catch, and once again, Tye's slower ball draws out the miscue from a well-set batsman"
"back of a length, worked to leg"
"big stride, head over the ball"
blocked into the off side
pushed into the gap at mid-on
squeezed into the off side

"short, aggressive, but rather harshly judged as a wide,"
"another short ball, perhaps Root thought that was it for the over, but it doesn't get up, and a <B>steepling top-edge lands safe!</B> He got out in that fashion at Adelaide ... a key let-off, perhaps"
tucks the single to get off strike
"full and straight, half stopped by the bowler in his followthrough but Moeen steals the single as the ball deflects to mid-off"
"angled defence down to third man, another single picked off"

"on the legs, Moeen this time works the single to square leg"
"round the wicket, very full, attacking the base of the stumps and gathered at mid-on"
"a round-house pull, out to deep midwicket"
down the leg side. Was there some bat or pad on that? Very tight to the body either way

eased down the ground to keep the strike
worked into the covers
sensible nudge down to long-on
hauled out through square leg
"that's a very soft dismissal from Moeen! Down the track, losing his shape, a wellied drive in the air to cover, and England's hopes of their habitual 300-plus total are looking bleak all of a sudden"
worked out to the leg side
"back of a length, a languid pull out to deep midwicket"
"full length, and defended back down the pitch"
"round the wicket, angled into the right hander, and blocked to the off side"

width and slapped through third man
"on the pads, nudged round the corner"

slapped with lots of bottom hand over the covers
nudged into the leg side
short and hauled out through the leg side

"heaved out through backward square, Root gives it some bottom-handed heft"
tapped through third man
flicked to the leg side
"low full toss, clipped to midwicket and Starc does well to save four overthrows as the shy comes in"
"a dot-ball in the end, as Rashid gets in a tangle trying to manipulate the angles"
"a bottom-handed bunt <B>inches short of long-on!</B> Perfectly placed, in the end"
nudged off the hip
"<B>run out!</B> Stabbed to point, and just the minutest hesitation does for Rashid, as a screaming shy from point plucks out the non-striker's poles!"

"swatted, in the air, through the leg side"
bottom-handed biff to mid-on
"a mow over the leg side, and another catch in the deep! And was that another Tye slower ball? Certainly looked as though Willey was through his shot early, flapping the ball much squarer than he might have intended. This is a fine collective bowling effort from Australia, and England just can't get any momentum back into their innings"
flipped into the leg side
"less exceptional this time, mind you..."
pounded out to the leg side with a cross-batted mow

"short, pulled down into the leg side, Root scampers, and <B>just beats the shy</B> as it comes in from midwicket"

slapped into the leg side
"well bowled, beats the edge with good carry through to the keeper"
"well bowled! And that is <B>five for Tye!</B> Yorker, straight and true, rattles the timbers, and England's innings has come to an ignominious end"

"shifts his line across, 132kph and curving away nicely as Warner watches it through"
"angled in and straightening, stabbed towards point from the crease"
"good length, shaping in and then out in the channel at 134kph/82mph, Warner shoulders arms"
"this swings early, slightly short in length and dabbed through backward point from back in the crease for the first run of the reply"
"curling away in the channel, an encouraging start for Willey, left alone"
"full, swinging and clubbed to the rope! Head reaches out and batters Willey through the covers for the first four of the day, to beery cheers around the Perth Stadium... So much for encouragement"
"over the wicket, pitched up a touch too straight, 136kph and helped off the pads past mid-on for a couple"

full and punched towards mid-off

gets a bit square on and taps it away
good length around off stump and Head shows it a straight bat

"drops short and POW, roundhoused through midwicket! Dismissive power from Warner, picks up four more"
"oh, slips under the bat, <b>Warner's been castled!</b> Curran gets it right up on the toes and Warner is done, maybe yorking himself with a lack of footwork, a poor series finishes on a low note... Out comes the <i>Aeroplanino</i> celebration from Curran, England have their first wicket"
"down the leg side, there's a sound as it passes, Buttler takes the catch... flicked the pad"
"length ball outside off, Stoinis gets into line and lets it go"
"fuller, 135kph on off stump, punched to mid-off"
pitched up and again Stoinis come across and leaves

"length ball, slightly wide and Head flays an angled bat for one into the covers"
"mistimed, maybe a slower delivery from Curran, driven uppishly but short of mid-off"

"round the wicket, good wheels as he pushes up to 143kph and Head swings at it in vain"
"back of a length over off stump, Head pulls and gets a thick bottom edge, Buttler does well to stop it scooting past him"
"shortish, rising outside off, fended away off the back foot... and it races away fine of third man for four, <b>bringing up the fifty stand</b>"

short and wide but he's off balance trying to hammer a cut and again fails to connect
"knocked into the covers, called through for a tight single, there's a direct hit and this could be tight... although they then try to pinch a second on the ricochet. It goes up to the third umpire and <b>Head is struggling here</b>, there's only a frame or two in it, but he's not managed to get his bat over the line - this is going to be out! Morgan was the fielder, he pretty much hit the bails with a sharp throw"
"flighted, Stoinis stands tall and pushes down the ground to long-on"
"nicely bowled, draws him forward and Buttler whips off the bails, <b>has he been stumped first ball?!</b> England seem fairly confident, Smith was off balance reaching forwards, but it looks like he had some boot behind the line... Yes, Dharmasena takes several looks at it, but Smith is okay"

"standing tall on the back foot, and punched to mid-on"
wafted through the off side with a roll of the wrists
"<B>what a stunning catch!</B> Absolutely <B>panned</B> back down the pitch, high to Moeen's right, but he sticks out a mitt, and the ball sticks between thumb and forefinger! The umpire has hit the deck, and Moeen looks as startled as the batsman that that has not sizzled to the boundary!"

"pushed through, Maxwell opens the face and steers towards point"
"tossed up, slow legbreak which Maxwell dabs down but again it's too tight for one"

"flighted, worked into the leg side for one"
"full toss, slugged to long-on - <b>no hundred for Stoinis!</b> He goes for 87, unlucky for this Aussie... he skipped out and smashed it flat down the ground but didn't get it as high as he needed and Tom Curran raced in to take an excellent diving catch"

"pushed through, Paine taps into the covers - four dots in the over"
"130kph, sliding down the leg side first up"
"rapped on the pads, nibbling in sharply... Buttler is appealing desperately for lbw and England decide to <b>review</b>; did Maxwell hit it? No, this has pinned him on the back leg, right in front middle and leg! <b>The decision is overturned</b>, Maxwell has failed to stay and see it through... Bit of a frantic swipe, although it was well bowled, jagging past the bat"
"lets go a full toss, Starc bunts it back to the bowler"
"angled across, nips late and takes the edge - <b>Buttler swallows it going low to his left!</b> Curran leaps to punch the air, brilliant bit of bowling and a catch to match! He was trying to tuck to leg when he needed to play straight, Starc heads off with Daddles for company and Australia are seven down, the chase getting trickier and trickier"

"pitched up and shaping in, 134kph and Tye crunches it along the ground to mid-on"
"dug in short, he rocks back to try and cut but fails to lay bat on it - possibly too close for the shot"
"<b>dropped!</b> Hoicked leg side, Tye goes after the slower ball and he sends it high towards deep square leg, Bairstow is usually a good man to have under one of these but he's already shelled a catch today and can't hold on diving forwards! Looks like he overran it slightly"
"oof, beats the bat, rising off a length as Tye hangs back"
"pitched up, goes for the yorker, Tye shuffles across and deflects it fine... Curran appeals for lbw but the umpire turns him down again. England don't review this time, must have been heading down leg"
"pushed through, Paine tries to reverse-paddle this with the back of the bat, misses and it deflects away off Buttler's gloves"

"touch short and Paine cuts firmly, behind the man in the deep and they get a couple"
"<b>dropped!</b> Paine tried to hit out and plopped it down the ground towards long-on, where <b>Hales grasses a low chance!</b> You expect those to be taken... Paine survives, could be crucial"

"round the wicket, pitched up on off and Paine blocks"
"tight stuff from Willey, 132kph on middle and off and tapped to the leg side"
"fired in, 138kph and again there's no width to play with, Paine pushes into the covers"
"short of a length, rising up on to the hip for Paine to tuck one square"
"over the wicket, full and straight, hit on the toe - <b>given!</b> Zampa calls for the <b>review</b>, as he has to... Just a matter of where it pitched, from the looks of it, maybe a touch leg side... Yes, pitched outside leg, <b>so the decision is overturned!</b> Cheers of relief around the ground, Zampa survives!"
"full outside off, chopped into the covers - another dot, Willey denied a wicket but he dries up the runs"
"short ball, taking the pace off, Paine pulls it around the corner for one"
"good length on off, Zampa pushes circumspectly to extra cover"
"banged in, Zampa heaves down the ground, in the air but it won't carry to long-on running in"
dug in and <b>smashed to the boundary!</b> Slower-ball bouncer from Ball but it sits up invitingly and Paine swivels to slam it through deep backward square leg and perk up the crowd once more!

"Paine backs away to leg, Ball fires in a cutter, gets a play-and-miss as Buttler tumbles to gather"
"short, taking the pace off, Paine swings hard <b>and thick-edges four to third man!</b> Came off the toe, in fact, and scuttles fine past the man down there"
"full and straight - <b>RAMPED FOR SIX!!!</b> What a shot, skill and guts from Paine! Ball missed the yorker and he got the lap away perfectly to sail all the way over the rope at fine leg!"
"dug on short, Paine pulls square and again declines one"
"finishes with another slow bouncer, pulled to fine leg for one to keep Paine on strike"
"full, fast, swerving in and dug out on off stump into the covers - dot ball"
"hits the stumps! <b>Curran wins it for England!</b> Paine's heroics in vain, beaten by reverse swing to rattle leg stump - Curran claims a maiden international five-for with the final ball! What a finish, a cracking match to christen the new Perth Stadium"
