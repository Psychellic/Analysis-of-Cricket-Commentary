"That's missed everything. Drifted in, was in line but nada."
"NZ <b>win their appeal!</b>. Banton has gone the reverse sweep, it hits him and umpire Chris Gaffaney takes a good look and thought not out. Banton was off balance. The question was whether it had hit him outside the line but, as it turns out, it was in line."
