"full and floaty, 80mph around off stump, pushed gently towards mid-off"
"full and swinging a touch again, Porterfield gets across and again dabs to extra cover"

another dot ball as Stirling hits a fielder
"tries to hit over the infield... <b>but chips the ball towards mid-on for Archer to take a catch diving forwards!</b> They are going to check the catch, but looks like he has done superbly to scoop the ball up as it died on him. The soft signal was 'out' and Stirling has to go after the TV umpire confirms Archer had got his fingers under it! So England strike through Curran, with a little help from the new fella"

"short down the leg side, Porterfield swishes at it... and England think he's gloved behind!

"straighter line, 83mph and angled towards leg stump, there's bat involved this time as he flicks fine for four"
"<b>chipped to cover!</b> Oh dear, that's a disappointing way to go... Maybe just stopped in the pitch a touch, Tucker was early through the shot and couldn't have picked out Morgan better!"
"whumped for four first ball! <b>A crisp back-foot drive through extra cover</b>, supremely timed and the cover sweeper can't cut it off! Decent shot to get off the mark, that"
"fullish on off, 86mph and driven to the right of mid-on"
"slightly too straight, glanced off the pads and they come back for two, good running"
pitched up and poked into the covers
"in the channel, a fraction full and Balbirnie strokes one through the off side"
"pitched up, tempts the drive - <b>snapped up superbly by Denly diving full length at backward point!</b> Another wicket for Curran, and it's a big one! Big stride, threw the hands, and a squirty outside was well held"

"cracked into the covers, straight to the man"
"<B>wow, that's incredible!</B> Absolutely lambasted through midwicket, Vince utterly nailed his pull as Little dropped short.

"back of a length, and pulls the bat inside the line"
"<B>fierce bouncer and Morgan has been scalped!</B> That's brilliant bowling, Morgan rose with the ball, caught in the elevator, left his gloves dangling in front of his grille, and flicked a nick through to the keeper, via the shoulder! What a debut for the new boy!"

A flat-footed slash from Malan, the ball got big on him on a tight line outside off, and Wilson ... well, he made a meal of it, in truth, but golly it looked good for the cameras, feet off the ground, pouched in his left mitt! England are losing their way!"

"up on the toes, angled defence out through the covers, more vital runs to the cause"
"on the back foot, poked to the off side"
"on the back foot, attempted flat-footed slap, not timed at all"
worked on the up into the covers
"<strong>short, slapped, caught!</strong> Everything aggressive is finding a fielder at the moment! A toe-ended pull out to the leg-side, KOB is right there at short midwicket, standing impassive as a nightclub bouncer. No way through there, sunshine!"

"short again, turned off the body through to Wilson... <b>Ireland go up but Kumar Dharmasena shakes his head!</b> Off the body or arm, maybe? That seems to be what KOB is signalling and Ireland don't review"
prodded into the covers coming across
"length in the channel, Foakes dabs it late behind point and they sprint the two"
wobbling away as Foakes comes across and leaves

"pitched up, 80mph around the line of off, Foakes taps into the covers"

"short of a length, 80mph and whipped neatly into a gap on the leg side, they come back for a third"
"half-tracker down the leg side, Curran gets something on it and Wilson snares a one-handed blinder... But was there bat/glove on it? Kumar Dharmasena is unsure, goes for a chat with square leg, then calls for the TV umpire. <b>Soft signal is not out</b>, by the way. There's definitely some glove on the ball, but looks like it bounced into the glove; yep, that's what Aleem Dar is saying. Wilson was among the most vociferous in pursuing that appeal, but it did seem to be grounded as the glove wrapped around it"
"oof, <b>that's a snorter!</b> No doubt about the glove on this, punched up into the air as Little unleashes an awkward bouncer, but Wilson can't make up the ground! Little has a little word with Curran in his follow through, too. Spicy"

"back of a length and inviting the cut, Foakes swats it in the air past backward point, <b>McBrine thought he was in business for a moment...</b> but they get a couple more"
"dug in short again and Foakes pull this through backward square leg, just the single this time"
"round the wicket, trots up and loops the ball on off stump, punched past extra cover for one"

"up on the toes, pounded out to deep cover"
flashed down to third man
"wow, that's <B>travelled!</B> Looked like a top-edge as he slid a pull under a cross-seamer, but there was actually plenty meat on an uppishly angled bat, clean over fine leg!"
beauty! Beating the outside edge with lavish seam movement
"<B>that's lovely from Foakes!</B> Effortlessly onto the front foot, and piercing the covers with calm authority. That's a big over and they are back ahead of the rate"
"eased into the covers, head over the ball"
"leaning back, chopping a tight off-stump ball out to cover"
into line once more
"advancing with calm authority again, working impassively to midwicket for the single"
"a hopeful appeal, more to distract from any attempt at a leg bye. They decline the single as the ball shapes down the leg side"
worked on the up to midwicket. A good riposte from Dockrell after that leaky previous over
"<B>big inducker!</B> Lovely line and length, jagging off the seam, sliding down probably, but a raucous appeal all the same!"
firmly forward to block
"too short, and<strong> rifled over the leg side!</strong> Good opportunism from Curran, hanging back in his crease and capitalising on the slight err in length"
"advancing out of his crease this time to combat the line and length, clips the inside-edge but flies safely to backward square"
finds another single to keep the strike rotating
"dabbed through third man, England are whittling down the requirement"
"outside off, slashed hard but straight to point. Curran rehearses the angle he wished he'd got"
"leaning over the ball, working the angle to midwicket, another key pair of runs"
"'nice George, nice George' ... and it was. Right on the spot"
"nurdled to midwicket, can't get that away"
"open-faced glide into the covers, one more to the total"
"down the track, excellent placement from Foakes, chiselling another brace to deep midwicket with good confident footwork"

rolls the fingers on another exceptional nibbly full-length seamer. Take liberties to that if you dare!
"fully forward, and nudged to the off side"
"lovely line! Drifting in on the arm, taking the inside-edge of a vertical defensive prod. Yeegads it's tense out there!"
"line, length, dibble, dobble. Wobble. Block"
"outside off, jabbed to point, the end of a magnificent spell. Murtagh and Dockrell have given nothing away. But now, it's about runs v wickets!"
"outside off, patted to cover"
"on the back foot, and dabbed to cover"
firmly forward

clipped off the pads for the single
"full length, outside off, cautiously dabbed"
nudged off the hip to return the strike
"too short, and<strong> those are sumptuous wrists from Foakes!</strong> Saw it early, but rolled emphatically, keeping the pull down and whistling past backward square"
punched into the covers
"there's the bouncer, but Curran is wise to it and drops the hands... and it's been given <B>wide</B>. Good thinking, but unlucky"
"<strong>battered!</strong> Drops the knee, slaps a very straight drive, clean through mid-off, as the bat twists on impact. Effective!"
"back of a length, nudged to deep midwicket, just the single. That was a productive over for England. Ireland, if they didn't already know it, need wickets"
"pounded up and over the leg side! That's good hitting, choosing his moment to throw the bat, and picking his spot too"
"width, outside off, chopped firmly to deep point."
"<B>overthrows!</B> Driven, via the bowler's hand, to mid-off, whose shy is awry"
tucks the single to add a fifty on ODI debut to his hundred on Test debut. He's a player alright
"eased into the off side. England are just beginning to assert their authority. Which means there has to be a twist, right?"
"thumped on the up to long-on, another single as Foakes keeps the strike"
"flipped to the leg side, pierces midwicket, another boundary to force Ireland's head to droop a touch more"
"too short, wide enough to have a slash with impunity, pulled forcefully in front of square"
"round the wicket now, a touch more cramped on the back foot, but worked into the on-side"
"<B>swish!</B> A touch impetuous for a change, pulling when the ball wasn't quite there for the shot. Whistles past the off stump"
"full length, slapped to cover"
"up on the toes, bashed to deep cover, another single as England ... seemingly ... close in"
"low full toss, <B>smashed one bounce to the rope!</B> That is a massive start to the over"
"slashed on the up to deep cover, Curran in a rush to finish this, and <B>dropped by Tucker, sprinting in!</B> So near, he made the ground, but lost his composure, and maybe now, the match..."
squeezed through third man... England are down to single figures
"slower ball, Foakes waits well and opens the face to third man"
"slapped uppishly, wide of the lumbering Boyd Rankin at mid-on, who gives away the second run"
"in the blockhole, flogged on the up, and the game is surely up now"
"round the wicket, hauled out through the leg side, and that's an extra too, so that is the end of that!"
