"slider from Badree, ducks in, Kamran blocks it to the leg on the back foot"
"another straight ball on middle, flat pushed to mdiwicket"
"another flat non-turner, this is blocked back to the bowler"
"bowled'em. <b>Akmal exits for a duck</b>. Poor shot selection. Poor execution from Kamran. Good-length legbreak, pitches on middle and off, hint of turn, Kamran is stapled to the crease as he aims to run it down to third man. Badree defeats the batsman and hits the off stump. Perfect start for WI"
"shot, what a way to get off the mark. This is a <strong>regal shot</strong>. A touch too full and outside off, Babar leans into it and crunches a drive through the covers. Nobody moved"
"short and outside off, only 125ks, Shahzad has ample time to swat a pull away to deep square leg"
"back of a length and angled in on off, neatly clipped around the corner to deep square leg"

"just short of a good length and angled in on off stump, whipped away to deep midwicket"

"Williams goes wide of the crease again, this one holds its line against the angle. Back of a length and outside off, punched on the up to cover"
"back of a length on off, Babar does now have any room to work with. He drops the ball in front of point and decides  against the single rather belatedly"
"yes, he <b>starts with a maiden</b>. This is gold. Just short of a good length on off, the ball isn't coming onto the bat. Babar aims a pull and ends up splicing the ball to mid-on"
"short on off, swatted away to deep square leg"
"keeps it shortish on off, short-armed away to midwicket"
"chest-high short ball on middle, but Holder does not have enough pace to test the batsman. Babar picks it up and pulls it to the right of deep square leg. First runs for Babar after eight balls"
"errant leg-side ball, Babar attempts a pull, flicks the thigh pad en route to the keeper"
"just short of a good length and outside off, sits up in the surface, Babar fetches it from there and muscles a pull over wide long-on. One-bounce four"

"The batsman runs down the track, this is fired on the leg stump. Full-toss, whipped through backward square leg"

"back of a length and outside off, opens the face and directs the ball to deep third man"
"Carlos strikes in his first over. No collision between Carlos and Walton this time. Short and wide outside off, Babar throws his hands at the ball, flashes and sends an outside edge flying to the right of the keeper. Watling springs to his right and completes a two-handed catch"
Malik gets on top of a short ball outside off. Guides it down to deep third man
"full, straight ball, can't drive at this length. Played back to the bowler"
"back of a length and outside off, goes on the back foot and punches to cover, where the fielder fumbles"
"Carlos in the thick of action again. Catches Shehzad at short midwicket. He swipes his bat on the turf, vents his angler, and departs. This was a harmless full ball on the pads, Shehzad flicks it loosely into the lap of Carlos. There was only only man inside the circle on leg and Shehzad picks him out. Like target practice"
almost a wicket for Narine. Short of a length and spins in - goes the other way - Zaman nearly drags it back onto the stumps
"banged short on middle, 91ks, punched to midwicket"

"full slower ball on off, dabbed to mid-on with soft hands"
"short and outside off, cracked away to deep cover"
"some flight on off, Zaman presses forward to defend"
"advances, but the wily Badree fires it short and wide. Guided to point who fires unnecessarily and concedes an overthrow to long-on"
dances down but Badree's flatter trajectory keeps Malik guessing. Inside-edged awkwardly to fine leg
"taken at deep midwicket. Zaman's stuttering debut ends. Wanted to get on top of Badree. But flawed execution. Plenty of flight from Badree, tosses that up towards off. Zaman gets low and top-edges his sweep all the way to the man at deep midwicket who takes a reverse-cupped catch at the boundary"
"the googly on leg, played away quietly towards short midwicket"
"plenty of flight on off, driven to long-on. Badree's superb spell ends at 4-0-14-2"
"the legcutter on off, dabbed away towards backward point for a run. Well played"
"shortish delivery on middle, bunted to midwicket from the crease"
"smashed into the stands! Just a tad short from Brathwaite, but Malik picked the length. Once he did that, all he needed was decent timing. He got more than that with his cross-batted swat. Waay over midwicket"
"rolled his wrists on that, and pulls to deep square leg. Lewis trudges in and lets the ball go through his legs. Very lazy effort. Brathwaite far from impressed"
"driven back to Brathwaite's left, who picks up, turns around and fires a wayward throw towards the keeper who dived to his left to save four overthrows"
"shot. Malik on fire. Short and wide from Brathwaite, Malik stays in his crease and scythes a cut behind point for four. Great execution, opened the face late to guide the ball behind point, not to him"
"shortish and wide, turning in. Sarfraz plays a cut under the line. Too close to cut"
"the other one. Flat on off, Sarfraz runs down and plays to midwicket"
"that's a poor delivery. Shortish and turning away from Sarfraz, who picked the variation and played the ball late in the vacant backward point region"
"a top-edged. Flat on off, Sarfraz sweeps but more off the arm towards fine leg"
worked away towards midwicket. They think of two but bail out rightly
"the offbreak, played down towards third man for a quick run. Great batting"
"short on middle, pulled away to deep midwicket for a run"
"a slower delivery, Malik looks to guide it down to third man but fails to make contact"
dabs this fine towards third man. Malik takes on Narine's arm and makes the second. Well played
swivel-pulled to deep square leg for a run
good yorker. Nails the execution. Sarfraz keeps it out
"signs of a slow surface. Pace off the ball, Sarfraz comes down, looking to go over cover but mis-times the ball back to the bowler"
"more poor fielding. Full on off, Malik runs down and nails his drive towards Holder at mid-off, who gets across to his right but doesn't get his body behind the ball"
strays down leg for a free run
"safe, a slow legcutter on middle. Malik fails to time his pull, and the ball plonks in no-man's land at midwicket"
"Holder does well this time. Flat and wide outside off, slapped towards Holder at mid-off, who parries the ball towards long-on. Rovman Powell doesn't pick up cleanly either. Brathwaite is visibly displeased"
"full down leg, following the backing-away Sarfraz, worked to deep backward square leg"
"taken this time. Pollard won't drop that. Pollard won't drop his Tridents team-mate. A slow legcutter on middle, sits up for Malik who times it excellently. But doesn't hit it well enough, neither enough elevation nor keeps it down. Pollard stays back and completes a more routine reverse-cupped catch"
dabbed to backward point
"full and wide, mis-timed cut to backward point"
"shortish, the carrom ball. Cut to point again"
"flat and slightly wide outside off, bunted to cover. Great bowling."
"great catch. Flat and wide from Narine, some extra bounce. The ball bounces extra and Sarfraz can't keep his cut down. Carries to Samuels at short third man who dives to his right and completes a fantastic take. Pakistan's total may have come down by 10 runs because of that catch, highlights the importance of wickets and fielding in these types of T20s"
"gets a fine tickle down towards fine leg. Whoa, that has raced away for four. Just some bat on that."
"given! Plays back and is struck right in front. But did that pitch in line? Flat and straight on leg, or just outside, the ball turns a touch and skids on to beat Tanvir's flick. Struck in front of off. Looks more out because he fell over. But not out for me."
"good hit. Full and wide outside off, Wasim mis-timed a cover drive but got enough power behind that to make the boundary straight over the bowler's head"
"short and wide, awful delivery. But may have been the offcutter, and that takes the ball over Imad's cut"
"another fantastic catch. Not sure what Imad was trying to do. Full outside off, Imad sits back and tries to muscle the ball over mid-off - a good option - but doesn't get anywhere near enough power. Brathwaite keeps his eyes on the ball, back-tracks and takes a lovely two-handed running catch"
worked away nicely towards deep square leg for a run
"a slower delivery, guided towards backward point for a run. An awkward bounce results in an untidy pick-up"
nudged away to deep midwicket for one. Another tidy over
"good single. Full delivery outside off, patted towards gully for a run. Bat on ball at this time"
"back of a length outside off, guided to point for a quick run. The fielder misses at the batsman's end, and Pakistan get 100. <strong>Out with a direct hit</strong>"
pushed towards mid-off
driven to long-off nicely. Another slower ball from Holder
"played nicely. Gets low and sweeps over square leg. Pollard runs to his right, picks up and almost effects a direct hit at the bowler's end. Would have been out had he hit"
"poor ball. A high full toss on leg, Shadab works the ball to the fine leg boundary. Looked like it was over waist. but no signal."
"slammed back over the bowler's head. A slower delivery outside off, swatted to long-off"
"a shortish delivery on off, patted to backward point for one. Good stuff, take what you can"
"parried for six. With Holder's height, he probably should have taken that. Full on leg, Wahab lofts the ball towards long-on. Holder puts his hands up, but the ball bursts through"
a badly-timed slog towards midwicket for a couple more. All vital runs
"goes for four. Another terrific effort from Brathwaite. Full and straight, Wahab hits the ball back straight. Brathwaite gets across from long-off, but the ball hits the boundary cushion after ricocheting off his hands"
"a mis-timed heave. Short on middle, Wahab's pull lands near midwicket. So badly timed they get two"
"fantastic yorker. Full down leg, Shadab misses a flick and the ball goes through his legs"
"gets low for a scoop. Legcutter outside off, Shadab sweeps towards square leg"
"way over long-on. Short delivery outside off, Wahab stays back and slaps a pull over the fielder. What a shot. Great timing too"
"taken this time. Holder takes it. Another legcutter outside off, Wahab mis-times his heave this time. Carries straight down to Holder at long-on who takes a simple catch. Rich cameo from Wahab"
"full on off, drilled to long-off. Shadab wanted two but couldn't get anywhere close. Good fielding"
"full and straight, hit back to the bowler. Shadab had already set off for the run. Hasan knew he wouldn't get close so he just walked off. Good effort from Brathwaite, and a reviving late stand from Pakistan"
"full and darted across off, played back to Imad"
"flat on off stump, punched down to long-on"
"short and outside off, 96ks, stands tall and punches to cover"
"length ball outside off, drilled straight to mid-off"
"inducker on middle and leg, clipped away to deep square leg"
"short and angled across off, scythed into the covers"
nudged off the pads in front of square
"skiddy short ball outside off, Lewis aims to smear it through the off side, ends up dragging an inside edge to the vacant midwicket region. Imad bolts in, attacks the ball, but can't throw the stumps down"
"sprayed down the leg side, swings down further, beats Sarfraz, five wides"
"short of a length and ducks back in, Lewis hangs back and squirts an inside edge onto the pad"
"short of a length and swings back in from outside off, Lewis stands tall and punches it to mid-on. He chances a single. There is an <strong>inadvertent collision</strong>. There is a direct hit at the non-striker's end as Imad swoops down on the ball. The TV umpire is called. Lewis veered away to his left and rammed into the Shadab who was looking to back-up the throw. The impact causes him to lose his bat. Lewis' foot is in the air, Imad, meanwhile, nails the stumps with a flat, accurate throw. Coach Mickey Arthur is on his feet, applauding Pakistan. Stuart Law, on the other hand, looks puzzled. Lewis would have been better off had he continued running in a straight line"
"full and angling across off, guided to cover"
hacked to mid-off
"another inducker, hits the pad, going down leg"
"full and straight on middle, driven to wide long-on"
pushed back to the bowler
"full on the stumps, driven to long-on"
"skids in on middle and leg, deflected to leg"

"length ball angling across off, helped down to third man with an open face"
"really full on the pads, flicked through deep backward square leg"
"good length on middle, played back"
"back of a length on middle, defended back again"
"Oh my goodness,<strong> another collision</strong>. Is this a highway or a cricket field. Man down this time. Shehzad is down. Both men down, in fact. Walton is also down. The batsman drops the ball in front of point. Shehzad bolts in, attacks the ball, but fumbles. Walton runs in at full tilt. Walton's knees ram into the back of Shehzad's neck. Walton is up. Shehzad wriggles in pain. This looks really bad for him. The support staff out, <strong>bracing Shehzad's neck</strong>. An ambulance arrives on the field. Coach Arthur is concerned and is on the field too. Shehzad seems conscious, though. He has been <b>stretchered off the field</b>. Nasty collision"
"full and angled in on off, inside-edged to leg"
"dug in short on off, punched to Nawaz, the sub, at mid-on"
"length ball on off, mowed over mid-on, who is inside the circle. <b>First boundary of the innings</b>"
"another length ball outside off, this seems like a slower cutter, Walton waits for the ball to arrive and smacks it over midwicket"
"back of a length and swings back in, Walton has a bigger swing at it and misses"
"very full on middle, pushed back to the bowler. Walton strays out of the crease momentarily but is in by the time Hasan effects a direct hit"
"short and tucks Samuels up for room, fended off the chest to square leg"
"short and outside off, punched to cover"
"banged in short and outside off, stylishly swatted away to the left of deep square leg"

"hip-high short ball, tucked around the corner for one"

"short, looks like a googly, punched to midwicket"
"skids on off, poked to point off an outside edge"
"short on off, punched to long-on"
"What's happening in Port of Spain?<b>The ball pings the umpire Wilson's left shoe</b>. 102.7ks, down the track and drilled back to the umpire who was taking evasive action. The ball hits the shoe but still goes to the boundary"
dances down the track and hits it to long-on
""
Samuels is unperturbed. He races down the track and puts Imad over the straight boundary for a six
"Samuels charges down the track, Imad drags his length back on leg stump. This is smashed over midwicket"
"there's the special googly from Shadab. Starts just outside off and rips back in, Walton has no clue about this. Walton eyes a leg-side flick and does not connect. He is on the move and falls over badly. Shadab hits the leg stump. Bowled through the gate. Walton is waiting. Are they checking for a no-ball? Shadab is all good and Walton has to go"
"really full on off, driven down to long-on"
guided to slip with soft hands
"short and outside off, stabbed into the covers"
"another googly from Shadab. This is fired short on the leg stump, Samuels skips back and nails a pull to the square leg fence"
"full on off, 94ks, Shadab is firing them in. Played up to cover"
"an appeal for leg-before, given! This is on a back of a length, skids in off the surface. Raps the front pad of Simmons. He was looking to defend down the line with his bat behind the pad. The tracker suggests it would clip the top of middle"
"inswinginger on a back of a length, punched to midwicket"
"low full-toss outside off, smeared through the covers"
Samuels stays leg side of this short ball and punches it back to the bowler
"back of a length and outside off, Samuels drives on the back foot, caressed through covers"
"length and outside off, driven with a slicing finish to cover"
"whipped away through midwicket. Flat and straight, Pollard comes down and powers a flick"
"flat and straight again, blocked. Yes, blocked"
"gone. Pollard looks for one shot too many and loses his shape. Shadab's legspinner works. Pitched full, but short enough that Pollard can't get close to the pitch despite shimmying down. That length allows the ball room to turn past the outside edge. Sarfraz completes the formalities"
"bowled first ball! Powell gone. A flat delivery that goes on with the arm. Powell hangs back and brings his angled bat down late. Very late. The ball skids on and hits off stump as Powell closes his bat face. Poor shot, playing with an angled bat so early"
worked away to mid-on. Angled bat again. Poor batting
"slow and wide outside off, left alone"
opens the bat face and runs the ball down to third man. Well played
"short and wide, Samuels clears his front foot and slashes one down to third man for one"

another block into the off side
"spin. Flat delivery outside off, goes back and opens the face to guide to third man"
"shortish and wide, guided towards point. Five dot balls"
"Shadab gets the wicket off the last ball of his spell. This game is well and truly open now. A googly outside off, the ball turns in. Samuels plays inside the line, the ball turns back in and takes the outside edge. Sarfraz, too, does very well to hang onto that. Pakistan in front? 4-1-14-4 for Shadab."
"full and straight, pushed back to the bowler"
"flat and wide outside off, Brathwaite works the ball down to short third man"
"shortish delivery outside off, Brathwaite goes back and pushes the ball back"

nicely punched to long-off for a run
"shortish delivery on middle, nudged away towards backward square for a couple"
"shortish delivery outside off, swatted to cover"
"nicely hit to deep cover, on the up"
"whew, that was close. Good length delivery on middle, Brathwaite misses his swat and the ball somehow misses the stumps"
"full on middle and off, the ball deviates back in and Brathwaite misses his swing. Goes over the stumps again, somehow."
"nicely done. Got low, stayed low, got a length delivery and just paddled the ball past short fine leg. Using that inward angle to his advantage"
length delivery pushed to long-off
"nurdled away towards deep square leg with soft hands. Good hands, good batting."
"driven away to long-on, another single"
chipped away to deep midwicket for another run. Some clever batting by these two
"good length delivery, Holder opens the face and guides one towards short third man for a run"
"good finish. Back of a length slower delivery outside off, Brathwaite closes his bat face too early and the ball goes through a gap between bat and body"
"full delivery on middle and leg, driven away to long-on"
"full and straight, beaten for pace. Pushed to mid-off. Good bowling."
"gets the gap and will find the boundary. Crucial runs. Full on off, Holder goes deep in the crease and shovels a flick through midwicket for four."
"another fine stroke. Full and straight, drilled down to long-off for one. WI back in this"
"a <strong>slow, low full toss</strong> outside off. Awkwardly hit down to long-off, just one though."
"dot ball to finish. A slower length delivery outside off, Holder gets beside the ball, looking to go over cover but fails to connect"
"excellent yorker. Full, straight and accurate. Jammed down to long-on"
"huuuge! Big hit. Slower delivery outside off, Holder gets under the length and lofts the ball cleanly and easily over long-off. What a clutch hit that"
"length on middle, pushed down towards long-on. Just one"
"just short of long-on. Back of a length on middle and leg, Brathwaite muscles a delivery down to long-on. Malik thinks of going in, but bails out."
"on a length on leg, nudged to midwicket. Just one."
"happy to take what they can. Length delivery outside off, Brathwaite opens the face and guides the ball to short third man. End of Tanvir's spell."
"excellent bowling. A full and wide yorker, Brathwaite beaten for pace. Can't make contact. Dot"
"bowled. Big wicket. Full and straight from Wahab Riaz. Full throttle. Brathwaite swings across the line and misses. The stumps are disturbed and Pakistan have an opening. The third umpire wants to check a no-ball and it's mighty close, but there is a smidgen behind at first point of impact. He shouldn't be that close though"
"another dot. Full and straight, misses the yorker but Narine, being new to the crease, can't time the ball cleanly. Back to the bowler. None off this over"
hammered but straight to cover. Just one. This is excellent bowling from Wahab
"that's four of them. After nailing all his yorkers, he misses this and pays a big big price. On a length on leg, Holder swings, makes contact and finds the boundary behind square."
"a high full toss outside off and Holder misses it. Another bad ball, but Wahab gets away with it. Superb over despite two bad balls to round up his spell"
"finds the boundary does Narine. If there was one place you don't want to bowl, it's there. Full and straight, in the arc. Narine heaves the ball into the gap at midwicket and he finds four. Wow."
"oh no. It's a low full toss from Hasan Ali. Another one that is full. Narine stays low, picks the full toss and hits the ball in the best possible place. Right over the bowler's head. Four. Brathwaite is finally happy"
"finally adjusts his length. A shorter length outside off, Narine swings and misses. No bye. Important dot ball"
"oh my. WI fans have never been happier since the 2016 World T20. A full delivery that drifts down leg for a leg side wide. Finally, there is voice in the stands."
"another slower ball, that's where he needed to be at the start of the over. A slower offcutter outside off, Narine loses his shape as he fails to pick the slower ball. A play and miss."
"whoops, it's a run-out without a run. Pakistan are back. Good length delivery on middle, Narine toe-ends his swat back to the bowler. Holder thinks he is run-out but Narine ensures he passes Holder, sacrificing himself."
"it's just one. It's a pretty good place to bowl and he's done it. A wide yorker outside off, Holder stays in his crease and can only bunt the ball towards point for a run. Pakistan have defended 132 by three runs to ensure they can't lose the series. WI have somehow found a way to lose, again. Relief on Pakistan's faces"
