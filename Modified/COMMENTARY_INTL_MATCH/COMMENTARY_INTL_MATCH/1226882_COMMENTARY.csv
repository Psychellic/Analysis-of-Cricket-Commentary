Philippe calls him through for what would have been a tight but sure run as he was clearly beating Tye in the footrace to the striker's stumps. But Vince is more concerned locating the ball out of his sight and stays put. Both men are at the striker's end, but Tye fields and tries to rocket at the non-striker's stumps instead of tossing a gentle relay to two fielders standing nearby converging from midwicket and extra cover. Luckily mid-on backed it up properly and ran to the stumps to take the bails off. If Philippe had tried to get back, he might have made it due to Tye's sloppy throw initially."
