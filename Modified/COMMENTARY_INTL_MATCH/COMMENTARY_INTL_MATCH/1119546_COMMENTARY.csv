"<strong>swing, edged, four!</strong> Only the one slip, Roy goes at the ball with hard hands, and Raina can't reach with a stretch to his right."
"more swing, in comes a second slip as Roy squares up watchfully on the front foot"
"sliding into the pads this time, flicked behind square"
<strong>that's an absolute ripper!</strong> curling past the outside edge from an excruciatingly tight line. Bairstow holds his bat tightly on off stump and prays.
uneasily driven back down the pitch. Probing new-ball bowling from Yadav
down the leg side. Let's have that one again
"<strong>driven, and a big appeal!</strong> There must be an inside edge or that is pretty plumb! Virat thinks hard ... but declines... no bat involved, back leg ...<strong> yikes, that was close!</strong>"
firmly drilled into the covers
"back of a length, punched on the up to mid-on"
"clipped off the hip, out to midwicket"
worked cautiously to the leg side again. This is tight from India so far
"too short this time, and a short-arm pull through midwicket. Sid just dragged that one down a touch"
thumped on the up and into the covers
"patted back down the pitch, good aggressive line from Yadav so far"
"fenced to backward point, extra bounce and defended"
"<strong>that's more like it for England!</strong> A rare over-pitch from Yadav, and met with a confident stride on the front foot, drilled clean through long-off"
"<strong>that's a brutal strike!</strong> Compact and venomous, met on the up, with a bicep-fuelled punch, and placed clean through the covers"
tapped into the off side once more
"driven with flat feet, and inside-edged into the pads"
"inswing on a full length, as Sid roars in with his head wrapped in an awesome head-band. Am always a sucker for a good head-band. Tucked to leg"
pushed off the back foot
"outside off, and dabbed to point"
"crunched to cover, fielded with a slide"
flogged into the off side
"fully forward, drilled to mid-off. Good work so far from India's seamers to keep England on a tight leash on their favourite pitch"
punched on the up to cover once more. The ring is proving hard to penetrate today
punched down to long-off
"wicket to wicket, back of a length, stoutly blocked on off stump"
"punched firmly back past the bowler, in the air for a moment, and was that technically a <B>drop?</B> It was... a tough one-handed opportunity. Hit the thumb, and deflected away"
tapped out to cover for the single as mid-off drops deep
"tickled off the pads, out through fine leg. Just fractionally offline and pays the price"
"advancing out of the crease for a clip to mid-on, and Roy jogs through for the single"
"on the back foot, swinging into Bairstow's drive as he pushes into the covers"
"<strong>another crunching drive!</strong> Bairstow threads his drive with such aplomb, picking his gap between the two men in the covers, and away the ball races"
cracked into the off side once more
"<B>flogged on the up and there's no cutting that one off!</B> Roy's most expansive stroke of the day so far, a hint of width and a chance to fling the hands through the line. Top boshing"
"punched hard into the covers again, another single. It's not a rocket-fuelled start, but England will be happy enough so far"
"open-faced steer through point. Really, nothing more than a thick outside-edge, but it pierced the gap and England will accept the boundary. Lightning fast outfield again"
"cheeky... a controlled dab through third man, riding the bounce, navigating the width, and more runs to the cause"
tucked out to backward point
"crashed into the covers once more. England starting to time the ball ominously now, but India's fielders are on their toes"
firmly pressed back down the pitch
"slower ball, outswing and jabbed down into the crease"
"back of a length, thumped to mid-on and another single"
tapped behind point for another sharp single. Safely home as the shy comes in
"nip off the seam, back in towards the pads, pushed into the off side"
"<B>wallop!</B> Just a touch too short, and out comes Bairstow's formidable front-foot pull, just launching his forearms across the line and over the leg side. The first of the day"

"outside off, flogged to deep point"
clumped into the off side
"advances down the track, clipped to the leg side"
"tossed up and worked to the on side, another single to midwicket"
"solidly onto the front foot, a big stretch down the pitch, and a well-snaffled single to the leg side"
"faster and flatter, Roy's eyes light up for a moment but he can't time his clip to leg"
"<strong>reverse-sweep</strong>, and that's a tremendous connection! Down on one knee, switching the hands, and hauled energetically through point"
"misdirected, and flicked firmly to backward square leg, but the sweeper gathers well"
"<strong>whistled behind square!</strong> Roy was inching across the crease as he sized up the line early, and wristily flicked behind square"
"attempted drive into the covers, but can't connect properly this time"
"wow, that's some timing. Just a regulation forward defence, no followthrough at all, but ends up being clawed back inches from the rope at long-off"
defended on the back foot
"outside off, an attempted glide through third man, but straight to the fielder, well placed on the 45"
"a sweep straightaway, very slow through the air, as Roy stretches forward and laps behind square"
"<strong>that's a terrible way to go!</strong> The intent was plain but the execution was hopeless... a pre-meditated reverse sweep, completely scuffed to cover. The stand is broken, and Kuldeep exerts his influence early... slip moved to leg slip before that shot was played, which was doubtless a factor"
"on the back foot, and flicked to leg"
two catchers behind the wicket and either side. Flicked off the back foot again
sliding deep into the crease to defend
"down the leg side, tucked off the hip"
"looped up, Bairstow stays leg-side to drive inside-out into the covers"
"solidly forward, head over the ball"
spin this time as Chahal throttles back and loops into onto a good length. Defended with a big stride
"on the legs, worked square"
"quicker this time, lifting into the thigh-pad as Root attempts to nurdle"
"flicked to the leg side, predominantly on the back foot still"
"<strong>pinned on the back foot!</strong> that is absolutely plumb, Root once again fails to pick the left-armer, plays back and misses it by a mile as the ball spins back into the right-hander and slams his pads. No point in reviewing that!"
met on the full and punched down to long-off
"flogged down the ground, to mid-off"
fully forward to defend on the front foot
"big appeal once more as Bairstow fails to pick the googly, and <B>Kohli has reviewed!</B> Looked leg-sided initially, but it definitely turned enough to threaten the stumps... <B>and it has pitched in line!</B> Kuldeep has three for spit, and England are in disarray!"

"outside off, back of a length, thumped to cover"

"forward, and pushed to cover"
"playing off the back foot, looking to work to leg"
"tossed up once more, Stokes crabs forward, bat and pad together to smother into the off side"
"flipped off the pads, and a kamikaze single! Stokes flings himself for the crease like Monty in Auckland, but gets home just about"

"back of a length outside off, driven to deep cover"
"touch fuller, he gets forward and drives to mid-off"
"gets this very cleanly! Short outside off, Morgan fetches it to the leg side with a strong short-arm pull. Skims over deep midwicket"
this time he goes full and Morgan drives him in the air straight of mid-off...a little counterpunch from the captain
"over the wicket, full and straight, clipped to deep midwicket"
oh dear! That's very loose from Morgan. Just limply clips a full delivery into the hands of midwicket. Tried to find the gap in the leg side and couldn't keep the ball down

"another slower ball, outside leg stump, Stokes needed only to tickle that and it was four. He's cross to have missed out"

"on the back foot, and defended back down the pitch"

chiselled out to the leg side for another single
"tapped to the leg side, and there is Stokes' fifty, from 102 balls,  by a distance his slowest in ODIs, and he can barely bring himself to acknowledge it. Still, it is vital for England's hopes that he sees it through ... in fact, the slowest by an England player for 13 years!"
"<strong>Reverse sweep and a fantastic take at backward point!</strong> Five wickets for Kuldeep - his second five-for in three innings, but this one is completed by a stunning grab from Darth Kaul, diving to his left to intercept as Stokes loses patience and takes the aerial route in his improvisation"
"dragged forward, pushed to the off side"
""
"tossed up above the eyeline, dips on the crease, and is pushed back down the pitch"
"low full toss, cracked back to the bowler"
"<B>spanked to deep midwicket, and Kuldeep has six!</B> probably the worst ball he has bowled all day, but how often do leggies pull this off? The long-hop causes Willey's eyes to light up,  but the man is well placed at cow corner to deepen England's gloom!"

"tailing in on a full length, Rashid clears the front leg and climbs into a wild hoick to long-on"
"<B>clonk!</B> that was gone from the moment you heard the noise on the bat! Picked the length early, on the legs, and dumped enthusiastically into the square leg stands!"
"opens the face, and steers a blockhole ball over backward point. Lovely connection, and signs of life at the end of England's innings"
"flicked airily over the leg side. It might have been six to the Radcliffe Road boundary, but instead it plopped into Kohli's hands at deep midwicket. A useful cameo, but England need to get closer to 280 than 250, you suspect"
"attempted pull, and nearly pulled straight onto his leg stump"
"reverse-swinging yorker on the leg stump, that's an absolute beauty to finish the over. Deserved a wicket, but will settle for the dot ball."
"pushed into the off side, digging out another yorker, and drops his bat in the process"
whipped with helicopter intent to the leg side. But not with helicopter impact
"<strong>Jos Buttler, is that you?!</strong> Rashid walks across the stumps, flicks his wrists into a perfect scoop, and it sails over fine!"
"looking for another scoop, ends up arsing it to fine leg, for want of a better description! They all count, and as he was playing a stroke (of sorts), it counts as (upper) leg byes!"

"full length, reversing into the toes, Plunkett can only drag this one out to the leg side"
"outside off, and hauled out to the leg side, a low full toss in the end,  but fairly effective in the circumstances"
"a fine-looking shot from Rashid, another low full-toss, drilled high and hard over the covers ... but straight to deep cover who doesn't have to move to swallow the chance"
"pumped over mid-off! Umesh was sizing up the yorker, but there was just enough leverage to allow Plunkett to fling his bat through the line"
"flogged to the leg side again, the reverse into the leg side does enough to put Plunkett off his stroke"
"a wide yorker, stabbed to third man, Plunkett wanted to be on strike for the last ball, but Dhoni whips off the bails. England are all out with one ball left unused."

"good length at middle and off, 89mph, defended from the crease"

jumps wide on the crease and then beats Rohit's outside edge as he feels well away from his body at a back-of-a-length delivery

"this one starts on leg stump, glanced behind square"
"lovely stroke, full outside off, given some width some he's able to throw his hands through a cover drive. Big stride, too"

"full outside off, swings away, this time he opts to leave alone"

"pulls the length back, on off stump, defended"
