"good length and outside off, opens the face and gently guided to point now"
"not the most pleasant thing, a hard, red cricket ball, hitting the edge of one of the pitches in the square and rearing up at you while you're on your knees to field it. Herath goes through the hair-raising experience, and the ball goes past his left. Solid drive from Pujara fetches more reward than it should've"
"lovely shot, swivels on the back foot as he picks the short ball early and pulls it to the long leg boundary. No hint of over-hitting"
"there's the <b>two-paced nature of the pitch</b> that the expert predicted. Dhawan is set to play a back foot nudge, but as well as he read the length, the ball comes off the surface a lot slower than the batsman expects. <b>Nearly pops back a return catch</b>"
"no trouble whipping leg-stump half-volleys away. Odd that it reached the boundary in the first place, but Pradeep is at long leg, and he seems to pull up a little too early, seemingly worried about the right ankle that he rolled in his last over"
"shortish and outside off, crunches it to cover"
"this is not a pleasant comeback over! Short balls, leg-stump balls, and now <b>a beamer</b>, sailing over the ducking batsman. Kumara apologises, and then picks up his hanky and furiously wipes his hand down. The umpire has given him his first warning, one more like that and he's a specialist fielder for the rest of the innings."
"<b>dropped by second slip</b> and it seems Asela Gunaratne might have hurt himself as well. He was made to move to his left to track the outside edge, but that left hand has a lot of strapping on it. The physio is out to make repairs. Herath is kneeling beside his team-mate, and the rest of the team crowd around him. And with the time being taken out of the game, Dhawan gets the opportunity to refocus. He was suckered into driving at a full delivery outside off stump - the first good ball from Kumara in this over, and he gasps in anguish"
"drifts into the pads, from around the wicket, Dhawan nudges it towards long leg"
"moves deep in his crease, seeing the short of a good length delivery, waits for it to come right under his eyes and then flicks to long leg"
pulls his length back well enough that the advancing batsman can only get a single off a drive to long-off
"quicker through the air, but that subsequently allows the batsman to play off the back foot. Makes Pujara quite happy as he picks another single through square leg"
"loops it up on middle and leg, Dhawan defuses it carefully"
"resorts to the sweep, and he plays it well, bat coming over the ball, wrists rolling on top to keep it down. Has to take such measures because the ball has some bounce"
"back of a length on middle, Dhawan taps it to midwicket"
"<b>good bowling</b>. He pitches it up, and directs it outside off, very similar to the ball Dhawan wafted at and edged in the previous over. This time though, he wisely refuses to indulge"
"closes the bat face, or is forced to do so, with the good length ball coming a bit slowly off the pitch off a good length area. There were some bare patches there which could be playing up. Meanwhile, umpire Illingworth is checking the followthrough of Kumara now."
"cuts to the sweeper, as he would do anytime he sees a short and wide delivery"
"<b>good bouncer</b>. Pitches on middle, the angle takes it past Dhawan's left shoulder. The batsman understands the risk involved in playing at those balls and lets it pass"
"out comes the fuller ball, but it's on the pads and Dhawan is given an easy put-away to long leg"
"steps out to the pitch of a tossed up offbreak and clips it to short midwicket, all along the ground"
"blocks a good length ball, which turns past the middle to take the inside edge. Pujara's soft hands though ensures it goes down and past the right of short leg"
"top work from short cover, diving to his right and snagging the ball with one hand. A well-timed slap from Dhawan fetches nothing"
"shifts back, and waits just a touch so that he can place the shortish delivery to the right of cover point"
the length goes awry - and Pujara is such a master at taking advantage. Turns the short ball into a rank long hop by shifting so deep in his crease and then pulls it to the left of deep square leg
comes down the track for a whip to mid-on
chops a shortish delivery to the right of cover for a quick single
"clips a shortish delivery on middle stump straight of midwicket. He has sometimes been known as a slow starter, mostly because his shots find fielders. In this innings, he's overcome that issue so much that he's 22 off only 29"
"this isn't full blooded, and perhaps because of that, it is a boundary. Reads the short ball, sets up with a pull shot, all of this happens on instinct. But then, here is where practice come in, he realises the ball is coming slower off the pitch and so he delays the shot, and only guides it between the gap at square leg and long leg on the boundary"

"<b>leading edge but past short cover</b>. For once, an Indian batsman coming down the pitch to play an attacking shot, is deceived. It's happened largely because of the slow pace of Gunathilaka. Dhawan is into the flick too early, there is just enough turn and the false shot comes out"

"<b>he's past 100 runs in a session</b>! Gets to the mark off an oddly short delivery from Herath, and he puts it through the ringer by making room and crashing it through cover"
"<b>mis-hit, and he knows it</b>. Strides down the pitch, but the bowler has made the ball dip on him, deceived him, leaving him in no-man's land. Dhawan claws his way to safety with a slog, and has connected it so well that it goes to the square leg fence. Has a wry smile on his face as he touches gloves with his partner"
nudges a good length ball through midwicket
"he's just running through the manual now - the MCC's and the IPL's. This is a length ball sliding past his pads, and Dhawan moves back and brings his bat down like a hammer on a nail to send it to the fine leg boundary"
"glides the ball to backward point, where Mathews exemplifies how Sri Lanka are flagging in the field. Doesn't get down low enough to stop the ball"

"shortish and outside off, steers it behind point"
too short and Dhawan waits on it just enough to first place it to the right of backward point and also keep it to the left of the man in the deep. Batsman in sensational form. Flat pitch. Part-time bowler. This is about as pear-shaped as a Galle Test has possibly got for Sri Lanka

"<b>that's his highest Test score</b>, surpassing his 187 on debut. The ball couldn't be any more to the batsman's liking. Down leg, fast, all it needed was a little bit of bat, and Dhawan shovel sweeps it, standing up, to the long leg boundary. He's basically drank a magic potion that allows him to become a magnet for bad bowling."
punches to long-on
"well, that happened, just like everything else has for Dhawan. Ten runs short of a double-century, with tea probably an over away, he strides down the track and toe-ends a length ball straight to mid-off. Walks off totally annoyed, practicing the shot, and meaning for it to go over the fielder, but once he looks up at the dressing room, he'll realise what a sensational knock this has been. Everyone is on their feet, applauding him. On Test comeback, he makes 190 off 168 balls in Rangana Herath's den"

"inches forward to block to short cover. Sri Lanka have to stay disciplined like this, the two batsmen are still finding themselves"
"<b>excellent bowling</b>! Having seamed it away off a good length all this while, Pradeep digs it in, and makes sure it isn't wasted either. Climbs up to head height, and it moves in off the pitch too. Rahane, the surprised Rahane, takes evasive action so late that he's on his back on the ground"
"<b>great shot</b> and it screams away to the cover boundary. Most fast bowlers would have loved to deliver this follow-up ball after a bouncer. Good length, just outside off, all it needs is a little nibble. But there is not enough on this pitch and Rahane can drive on the up as he pleases"

"slower through the air, although it isn't given any more air than the previous ones. Rahane reads the variation well and rolls his wrists on the ball to keep it down"
"<b>brings up the 150</b>! It's his sixth such score, and he has 12 hundreds over all. What a conversion rate! And he does it all pretty much as he's played this shot. Watches the ball carefully, sees that its a bad one, sliding onto his pads, and so he does only the needful. A little leg glance to bring the Indian captain up on his feet to applaud"

"<b>gets to fifty</b> with a blistering straight drive, and it is the result of his quick work to come down the pitch and hammer a ball that isn't really tossed up. Just that it had the room for the batsman to free the arms and power it away"
"hangs on the backfoot, waiting for the short ball, but Herath slips in the slider, on a good length. On quicker pitch, that might have led to a little more fun than a slap through cover"

"goes for the short ball, but it strays a little too far from where Pradeep wants it and Pujara needs to do nothing more than watch it fly down leg"
"that is an <b>absolute peach</b> and Pujara is caught behind! Pradeep is known for these out-of-the-blue jaffas! Getting good length balls to both bounce more and seam away even on helpless pitches. Pujara has to play, he's half forward because the length forces him to go half forward, and then he searches for the ball with a defensive bat, but it takes a deadly detour, kisses the edge and goes through to the wicketkeeper. The right-hander's version of the ball that dismissed Abhinav Mukund yesterday."
"<b>outside edge</b> but it falls short of gully! Pradeep hurries the new batsman up with a shortish delivery on middle, and it straightens to beat the middle of the bat again. Poor bloke, he's bowling outstandingly, but the scorecard is 423 for 4"

"tosses it up on off stump, defends"
"shortish delivery, wandering down leg, with no turn. Ashwin flicks and misses"
"full ball from wide of the crease, Rahane works the angle and plays a flick to deep square leg"
defends a back of a length ball on off stump
"no feet, but <b>what timing</b> on this cover drive. That's an Ashwin special. He has such good hands, and a great sense of where the ball is. Puts the good ones away when they give him the slightest leeway. Here it is the width"
defends a back of a good length delivery to point
"the line goes to shambles this time, for he tries to create a greater angle from wide of the crease for his away-seamers. This one though slips down leg as the batsman flicks"
"su-weet cover drive, this time off the front foot, and short cover does well to dive to his left and get a hand to it"
"gets down the track, but Herath makes it drift into the pads, and that means Rahane's block turn into an inside edge onto pad and then <b>nearly a catch to short leg</b>"
pushes it to long-on
"leans forward, reaching for the tossed up delivery for it dips at the last second, to find short cover"
brings his front foot to the pitch of the ball on middle and leg and smothers the ball
gets down low over the flighted delivery on leg stump and clips it to midwicket
stays back to a good length ball that turns off the straight just enough
"<b>caught at first slip</b>! Super backing up for a super ball. It pitches on a fullish length, draws the batsman to drive away from his body. Rahane thinks he can do that on a pitch with such little help for the fast bowlers. He's already hit better balls to the boundary in this innings. But on this occasion, only the outside edge results and Karunaratne dives low to his right to snaffle it"
"<b>yorker</b>, and it's tinged with inswing as well. Good on Saha to play late and play with a straight bat"
"back of a length and outside off, lets it pass"
"fuller delivery on off stump, Saha's defence is solid"
"stays in line with a 138 kph short ball and blunts it quite well. Soft hands, precise batting."
"140 kph, and that pace means something. It has Saha hopping on his crease, and the man under the lid makes him yank his bottom hand off the bat immediately after making contact with the short ball on middle"
closed face of the bat in front of pad to block a flighted delivery on leg stump
continues to make the batsman reach out to play on the front foot. Such a master at deceiving them with flight and this ball waddles towards point
opens the face and runs a flighted delivery towards point. That's because he's doing so with soft hands
"drives, a little more forcefully, to mid-off"
<b>excellent cricket</b>. Ashwin steps out to the flighted ball on leg stump and whips it past midwicket's left
"holds this one back, but it still pitches on a good length, just outside off, so Ashwin can only block"
"flicks a full delivery just outside off stump towards mid-on. Good pace from Kumara again, but the length is far more impressive"
"back of a length on off stump, keeps it out"
"spots the short ball early and gets under it fairly comfortably. Good direction to the bouncer, right over middle and leg"
"<b>superb strike</b> and a 143 kph delivery - when it's a half-volley - can still be spanked dow n the ground past mid-on. Beautiful batting from Saha, coming forward, keeping the front toe pointed away so a straight bat can come down"
"another bouncer, this one sailing over the batsman's head, and that means it has not troubled him"
"<b>lovely bowling</b> - and this is the result of the threat of the short ball. A batsman caught in his crease, and the sucker ball nearly getting rid of him. Back of a length, outside off, needless waft, silly miss."
"full, angling in on off stump, defends"
"that's among the more elegant cover drives you'll see. Leans forward, looming over the half-volley and caressing it through the gap"
"knows the next one will be flatter, shorter and quicker, and so he is waiting for it. Flicks off the pads past midwicket's right"
"to the left of the man kept halfway to the boundary at cover point. For people wondering why Ashwin's in, this is the reason. Long stride forward, head over the ball, hands flowing through it. Gorgeous."
"fuller delivery on off stump, Ashwin pushes to short cover"
"makes him reach a touch more outside off, and Ashwin's drive goes uppishly to backward point"
a little dip on off stump ensures Ashwin has to stay cautious and he does so. That will be <b>drinks</b>
"<strong>lobbed just wide of short leg</strong>! Chest-high short ball on middle, kicks and screams at Saha like a banshee. Saha looks away and manages to quell it past the right of short leg"
"banged in short on middle, this time to Ashwin, he sits back and fends it off towards midwicket"
"back of a length and veering into the thighs now, Ashwin sits back and clips the ball away to midwicket"
"good length, angled in on off, Ashwin presses forward and solidly pushes the ball to mid-on. Nice, confident stride from Ashwin"
"Kumara ventures wide of the crease. But this one holds its line as opposed to angling in. Too full and outside off, Ashwin presses forward, opens the face and drives it handsomely through point, outruns the man in the deep"
"overpitched on leg stump, Ashwin merrily flicks it away between midwicket and mid-on"
"offbreak, starts outside off and <strong>turns in</strong>, Ashwin chooses to let it go. But this brushes the flap of the front pad, drawing lbw appeals from the Sri Lankan keeper and fielders. But this did not break in enough to threaten the off stump"
"good length and breaks in, punchily played back to the bowler"
"tossed up and <b>drifts away outside off</b>, Ashwin presses forward and smothers it"
this is a bad ball - short and wide outside off - Ashwin jumps back and hits the release button. He square-cuts it away to the boundary
"flatter and quicker through the air, defended on the front foot"
"good length on middle and off, negotiated with a straight bat"
"Kumara nearly hits 140ks! Darts it outside off, back of a length, Saha has a short stride in defence"

"floated up on off, Ashwin presses forward and defends it back to him"
"too full and slid across off, Ashwin is forward again, he opens the face and languidly drives it to the left of extra cover"
"Dilruwan finds grip and a hint of turn, but Ashwin dead-bats it"
"<strong>brute of a bouncer from Kumara</strong>, nearly produces a wicket. This is slammed outside off, Saha jumps off his feet, flings his hands up, the ball brushes the glove and balloons over a leaping first slip"
"pitched up and outside off, now Saha is forward, opening the face and driving to sweeper"
"Kumara ventures another big bouncer,  Ashwin avoids it, as the ball flies through to Dickwella"
"wide of the crease, angled just a shade outside off, driven right back to the bowler, who is hesitant to bend down in his followthrough. Instead, kicks the ball away towards mid-off with his leg"
"banged in short on middle, Saha is equal to it, he loosens his grip and defends it back"
"bouncer on the leg stump, Saha is unperturbed, he sinks under it"
"tossed outside the leg stump, the line is ripe for a sweep, Ashwin laps it away fine on the leg side. The man in the deep is squarer"
"this is tossed on off stump, Ashwin gets forward to defend it onto the pitch"
"pushed through on the pads, Ashwin presses forward and works it defensively to midwicket"
"picked off the pads again, this time to the right of short midwicket to wide long-on"

Saha bends forward to dead-bat this full ball on off

"wide of the crease, full and angling in on middle and leg, Saha drives the ball to mid-on"
"dug in short and outside off, Saha drops his gloves on it and lets it go"
"this is a proper bouncer, the short-ball attack to Saha continues, he watches it all along before ducking under it"
"flighted outside leg stump, Ashwin closes the face and nurdles the ball to square leg"
"sliding across off, Ashwin uses half a bat to poke it through cover point"
"short and sliding across off, Dilruwan allows Saha to use the depth of the crease and force the ball away to sweeper cover"
"really full and outside off, now it's Ashwin's turn to punch a single to sweeper"
"tossed on middle, defended with soft hands to the left of short leg"
"there comes the sweep from Saha! This was pushed through outside the line of off, Saha stretches out, rolls his wrists, and crunches it to the left of short leg again, the ball fizzes away to the square leg boundary"
"good length and angling into the hips, nudged to Mendis under the helmet at backward short leg. Ashwin strays out of the crease, Mendis spots it, and ventures a direct hit. He can't connect and Ashwin eventually gets two. <strong>A direct hit could have sent back Ashwin. Superb reflexes from Mendis</strong>"
"just short of a good length on the stumps, defended"
"Pradeep goes shorter and wider outside off, Ashwin gets on top of it and rides it out to gully"
"wide of the crease, back of a length and angled outside off, Ashwin rises on top of the bounce and languidly punches to cover"

"back of a length and outside off, punched out to cover"
"<b>Miscued off the toe end</b>! Herath has his first wicket of the match after bowling 31 overs. Tossed up and drifts in on leg stump, Saha forays down the track, but the ball dips, Saha only manages to drag a catch to Dilruwan at mid-on"
"straight ball on middle, defended"
"pushed through on middle, Pandys stretches out and blocks"

"length and outside off, defended back"
"shorter and outside off, punched to cover"
"Caught behind! The short ball works for Pradeep again, this earns him his <strong>first five-wicket haul in Test cricket</strong>. How long has he waited for this moment? Pradeep digs it it and lets it fly towards the left shoulder of Ashwin. He doesn't back away from a hook but can't connect well enough. Gloved behind to Dickwella"
"the short-ball barrage continues, banged in on off, Jadeja hops and pats it down"
"back of a length and veers in on middle, Jadeja covers up in defence"

"another menacing short ball, on leg stump, surprises Pandya and <strong>pings him on the glove</strong> as the ball wanders away to cover"

"non-turner on middle, played back to the bowler, and <b>that's lunch on the second day</b>"
"first up though, he'll have to lick his wounds after being spanked through the covers. There is precious little room, but Jadeja gets up on his toes and drills it through the gap with class"
opens the face and slides the shortish delivery to point
"<b>good short ball</b>, climbing past the right shoulder of Jadeja, who does well to eventually pull out of the.. uh, pull shot he wanted to play"
"delightful control of line and length as he leads a manhunt for the outside edge. Jadeja though smuggles it away before anyone can spot it. Or, to be boring, he leaves the ball"
clips a shortish delivery on middle through to deep midwicket
"a bouncer to wrap up the first over after lunch, Pandya ducks under it."

"wanders down leg, Jadeja leaves it well along, Dickwella fumbles to give away a bye"
"tosses it up on off stump, Pandya meets it with steadfast defence"
"rocks back, to a ball that isn't entirely short, and tries to flay it behind point. Unable to do so"
lunges forward to block on middle
"<b>dropped by first slip</b>. Poor Herath. He does all the good work, slowing the ball down, getting it to turn, luring the batsman into a false shot. Pandya thrusts his hands at the ball, without moving his feet, nicks it through to Karunaratne at stomach-height, but he spills it"
"back of a length and outside off, leaves it alone"
"short and way wide outside off, so much that Jadeja can't reach it with his cut shot"
this one is ripe for the cut shot and Jadeja nails it to deep third man
"<b>a top-edge nearly sails all the way</b>. That's a second false shot in as many overs and both of them go in the batsman's favour. Pradeep digs in a bouncer, angling it across the right-hander, and making it climb up towards his chest. Pandya goes for the instinctive pull and gets four for it over the keeper"
"another bouncer, but this one is wayward, going well down leg"
"<b>more fumbling</b>. The fielders need to be giving more support to their best bowler. Pradeep delivers another good short ball, rising up to Pandya's chest, on middle. But the batsman sways away to ramp it over the wicketkeeper. Cant' get bat to it. Dickwella doesn't get his gloves up high enough and gives away a bye"
"sensational strike, as he gets down low and slog-sweeps Herath from middle stump to deep square leg"
""
stays back to a full delivery and nurdles it to short leg
"pushes it through on off stump, Jadeja doesn't let it pass"
"a little turn, but it's not entirely troubling on a slow pitch, and from a soft ball. Jadeja punches to long-on"
"tosses it up on middle, Pandya blocks"
"<b>that's just ridiculously good</b>! So much so that the batsman could only dream of hitting it. Bouncer, at high pace, and rearing up towards Jadeja's ears. He's trying desperately to fend the little red thing off his face and is lucky the ball is actually just a inch of so high enough to evade his gloves"
"<b>rip-roaring yorker and the middle stump is in disarray</b>. The two-card trick at its best. And Pradeep doesn't even celebrate. He just wheels away in his followthrough as a bowler who knew the wicket was coming the moment he decided to put this plan in motion would. Jadeja is caught in the crease, he's not ready for his toes to be singed, he's late in bringing the bat down but is quick to leave the field. So much that the umpires need to ask him to wait to check on the no-ball. Pradeep is <i>just</i> fine, the smallest portion of the heel is behind the line"
"looks for the blockhole again, from wide of the crease, Shami covers his stumps well enough"
"he's expecting them at his feet and from that vantage point, Shami plays a lovely on-drive"
"the short ball, at 136 kph, but this isn't as high as the previous ones. Pandya tries to ramp it, but can't connect"
doesn't rise up where it would threaten a batsman and so the short ball is put away in style. Thundering pull shot from Pandya
"launches it over long-on and that is the first six of the innings, in the 123rd over, by the No. 10. Shami sees it tossed up and drums it over the bowler's head"
"another flighted delivery on off stump, Shami drives to long-off"
"looks to drive to long-off for a single, but Herath's drift deceives him and takes the inside edge"
"quicker delivery on off stump, Pandya blocks, getting low"
"goes back to cut a slider on off stump, and if his hands hadn't been quick enough, he'd have been bowled"
drives to the right of short cover
127 kph and that's why Pandya is able to muscle it over deep square leg. A hook shot of the top draw to a short ball that is nowhere near it
"blocks a good length ball, at 137 kph, from toppling the off stump"
taps a fuller delivery to mid-on which is about halfway to the boundary
"<b>top-edge doesn't carry to long leg</b>. These bouncers are a little too much for a No. 10, and Shami, seeing the ball coming at his head, plays an awkward pull and is lucky to survive"
"full on off stump, pushes to cover"
"there's two men on the boundary for the short ball, but Pandya's backing himself to clear them, and when its 128 kph, he can keep doing so. This is a big-hearted spell from Pradeep, but some of his venom is shot after 29 overs of bowling. That's only seven shy of Herath."
flicks a good length ball on middle to short midwicket
"tosses it up on middle and leg, Shami smothers it"
keeps his front leg away from interfering with a flick to mid-on as Herath spears it into leg

"129kph, short and sliding well down leg, Shami pulls, but he can't reach that far"
"another short ball, coming up to Shami's left shoulder, but only at 129 kph. Pull and miss"
"gets up off his toes to nudge a short ball into the leg side, which allows Pandya to call Shami through for a quick single before square leg can come into the fray"
"136kph, shortish and wide outside off, Pandya slaps it to deep point"
"another almighty pull from Shami, the stump mic even picks up a grunt, but the 127 kph short ball from around the wicket beats him"
"skews a top-edge over square leg, but makes it land in front of the man in the deep. Dreamy placement"
"good length on off stump, Shami blocks and finds a single past midwicket's left"
"punches a good length ball down the ground, Kumara gets a hand to it, which then directs it to the stumps at the non-strikers' end. Shami has his bat down in time and then picks up the single on offer after the ricochet"
"controls the pull quite well this time, and off a short delivery that's clocked at 138 kph. Keeps it down and finds a single to deep backward square leg"
"another short ball, Pandya pulls it to long leg"
defends a back of a length delivery outside off to cover point
"pull shot, no connection, hands on heads for Kumara"
flicks a shortish delivery from off stump through to deep midwicket
punches a shortish delivery through vacant point. Pandya says no on the single
"good length ball on off stump, blocks towards long-on, refuses the single again"
"<b>brutal hit</b>, and what's more, it's across the line of a full and straight delivery, he may as well have brought the coaching manual out to the crease and shredded it in front of Pradeep's face. Six wicked runs over square leg and the <b>fifty of the ninth wicket partnership as well</b>"
""
"moves around the wicket for a short ball at 136 kph, Shami pulls to long leg"
a little drift at the last moment ensures Shami's drive to long-off becomes an inside edge onto pad
defends a fuller delivery on leg stump
"that's rapid! And it's aimed at off stump, on a fullish length. But because of the flatter trajectory, Shami hangs back and has to hurry into chopping down on it"
""
"teases long-off, teases him until the moment when it sails over his head, and he's pissed off as it happens. He should be. Shami <b>connected with this off the bottom of the bat</b> after racing down the pitch"
pushes to cover
137 kph delivery thuds into Pandya's thighs as he tries to pull a ball that does not bounce as much as he wishes to. Not entirely short enough for the pull and he'll get a bruise to remind him of his misjudgment
"<b>appeal for caught behind</b>, but the bowler joins in more out of hope than anything else, and that's a pretty easy giveaway. Short ball on leg stump, Shami goes for the pull, UltraEdge shows no spike"
"bouncer again, pull again, no connection again. My fingers hurt."
"a pristine off drive, hitting it on the up as well. This is starting to become embarrassing."
"he connects with the short ball, but only to then find deep square leg. The short ball comes out and sure as heck Shami gives it everything. But since it hits the higher part of his bat, he doesn't get any timing on it"
"Kumara spears it in short from wide of the crease, but not as short as Umesh expected it to be. He looks away, takes his eyes off the ball, jumps up, and is <b>smacked on the glove</b>"
"tossed on middle, down the track and driven to mid-off. Pandya refuses the single"
"full on the stumps, shovelled to long-on. Single denied again"

"short ball, honing in on the robs, Umesh hops and capably fends it to leg"
"chest-high short ball outside off, Umesh shuffles across off.... and misses a big hook"
"back of a length on middle, Umesh shuffles across off, connects, clipping it to long leg"
"Shot! Pandya stands tall and smites it away past the right of mid-on. Just short of a length and outside off, Pandya, who in IPL mode, opens up his hips and flat-bats it fiercely down the ground"
"short and outside off again, this is short-armed away to wide long-on. This is the fifth ball of the over, and hence Pandya takes the single on offer"
"Umesh goes bang! He puts a smile on Kohli's face and has his captain and coach clapping. Length on middle, Umesh cleared his front leg and T20'd over the bowler's head. Launched for a six"
"tossed on middle, nudged away past the right of the bowler. <strong>Pandya takes the single and brings up a 48-ball fifty on debut</strong>"
"pushed through on middle and leg, Umesh presses forward and blocks to short midwicket"

"full and outside off, pressed into the covers"
"That is that. <strong>Kumara wraps up India for 600</strong>! Banged in short on middle, Pandya takes it on, you've got to once you've reached 600. He shapes to muscle it away over the boundary. But he does not get all of it. Skies it to deep square leg. Dhananjaya, subbing for Asela, tumbles and clings onto the catch"
wayward start - bouncer down leg - nothing doing from the batsman

"straying into the hips, tucked away through square leg"
"good length and seaming away outside off, lovely ball, Umesh finds a hint of extra bounce to harry the batsman. He jabs at it before pulling the bat away. The ball streaks away to the cordon"
"just short of a good length and swerves back in, cramping Karunaratne for room. He whisks it hastily to midwicket"
"big shout for lbw, the finger goes up. <strong>This looks plumb</strong>. Karunaratne, though, challenges the on-field out decision of Oxenford, after having a word with his senior partner. 'Doesn't look the greatest of reviews,' says Tucker, the TV umpire. 'Nuff said. The tracker suggests it would go onto hit the middle of middle. That was how plumb it was. Umesh spears it full and straight at 144.7ks, Karunaratne is beaten for pace. And when the bat is brought down late, it comes down at an angle. He ends up playing all around it. The ball swings in to pin the front pad bang in front. Why did Karunaratne review this? Why did Tharanga agree to it? Beats me"

"very full and wide outside off, no shot"
"dug in short on middle, fended beside his feet"

"bouncer on middle, zings through to Saha, as Tharanga ducks under it"
"short, rising, wide outside off, Tharanga rises with it and upper-cuts it over backward point. Great intent, great execution"

"short and wide outside off, Tharanga dabs it down to gully"

all he has to do is play it late - after picking the arm ball. It offers the room for the late cut and Tharanga is excellent playing through the off side
"good length ball outside off, refuses to play"
"tosses it up on middle, gets it to dip, Tharanga reaches out to block"
"<b>searing yorker</b> and it has the batsman sprawled face-first on the pitch, his balance shot to all heck. Umesh has his hands on his head after an inswinger nearly skittles through Gunathilaka's defences"

Dilruwan is too slow to bring his straight bat down, and he's also foiled by the fact his front pad is in the way. <i>Everything</i> looks right for the on-field decision to be upheld - pitching in line, hitting in line, below the knee-roll on the front pad, but ball-tracking shows it will <b>bounce over middle</b>! Dilruwan survives. Kohli has his head in his hand. And drinks are on the field"

"tossed outside off, no turn, Herath presses forward, opens the face and dabs it to point"

"this one drifts into Herath, he squirts it away to square leg from the crease"

"full again, but the line is far straighter, and that's blocked back to him"
"dangled up outside off, Herath shuffles across and works it to midwicket"
"Herath dashes down the track, Jadeja is wary of it and hence drags his length back outside off. Herath still short-arm pulls it away to deep midwicket"

"nice and full, it breaks away from there, Dilruwan has a short stride and prods it to cover point"
"hugging the off-stump line again, full again, but this does not turn. Defended"
"faster and flatter outside off, lots of width, Dilruwan takes advantage of it and cuts it away to the left of deep point"
"length ball, drifts towards off stump, played back to Ashwin"
"Dilruwan unleashes the slog-sweep again and clears the midwicket boundary. This was liberally tossed up outside off, Dilruwan races down the track, gets close to the pitch, and sends it clattering away"
<b>Dilruwan brings up his fifty</b> with an outside edge that streaks away past lone slip. The drift found the edge
"full on middle, defended"
Dilruwan forays down the track again and pastes it straight of mid-on. He surges down the track again and lofts it down the ground. Top execution
"non-turning offbreak, defended"
"full and spinning in, defended to midwicket"
"Herath has been given out caught behind by the on-field umpire Illingworth. He points to his left elbow and <b>asks for a review</b>. This was lobbed up outside off, this is a bouncier than normal Galle track, Herath attempts a reverse-sweep. Did this just loop behind off the forearm? Nope, the ball brushed the glove band on its way to Rahane running back from first slip. TV umpire Tucker upholds the on-field call"

"full on the stumps, kept out"
"pushed through and bounces outside off, no shot"
"very full and veering into the pads, Dilruwan hangs back but does not put bat on ball. Deflects it fine and exposes Pradeep to Umesh"
good length and snakes back in to hit the knee-roll of the front pad. Pradeep stays leg-side of the ball and does not connect with a flick
this time he tickles it off the pads to fine leg and takes a single
"Umesh continues to pepper Dilruwan with bouncers. This is bang on middle, Dilruwan is equal to it. He ducks under and evades it"
"this is not as short as the previous ball. Shortish and outside off, Dilruwan clears his front leg, and powerfully swats it in the air over wide mid-on. Great intent and execution to boot from Dilruwan"
"just short of a good length on off, Dilruwan rides the bounce and late-cuts it beautifully through point"
"Dilruwan steps out, this is speared shorter and outside off, bunted to the covers. Dilruwan trusts Pradeep and takes the single"

"fires a slider outside off, stark hike in pace, but left alone"
"Jadeja is back to attacking the stumps, Pradeep capably pushes it back"

"pushed through on off, non-turner, Pradeep covers up in defence"
"good length and outside off, Dilruwan opens the face and late-cuts it away to deep point"
"<b>nearly kisses the off stump</b>! Lovely delivery - back of a length on middle and then straightens away to climb just over the off stump, beating the batsman's defensive jab. Pradeep was guilty of playing inside the line again"

"short and wide outside off, chopped to point, more or less straight to the fielder. This is the last ball and Kumara wants a single, but is sent back. Pandya collects the ball quickly but can't throw the stumps down at the non-striker's end. <strong>A direct hit could have had Kumara</strong>"

shortish on off stump and it thuds into the middle of Dilruwan's bat
firm push to mid-on as Pandya keeps exploring the areas of the pitch closer to him instead of the batsman
"that's better, he goes wide of the crease for a fuller ball on off stump, it draws Dilruwan forward with a defensive bat"
"<b>direct hit from the man at cover would have run him out</b>. Kumara isn't match-aware. he doesn't know this is the fifth ball of the over and so Dilruwan will be looking for single to keep strike. Abhinav can't hit, and it yields an overthrow as well"
"fullish on off stump, taps to cover"
"tosses it up outside off, Kumara smothers it"
watches it carefully and then strides forward to block in front of middle
"<b>nails the top of off stump</b>! This is sensational bowling - he loops it up outside off and draws Kumara forward, but the batsman doesn't realise this one also drifts away, just that couple of inches, and turns in just enough. but all the best tricks are subtle. Kumara doesn't cover for it and ends up playing inside the line and is beaten on the outside edge. Just top class, even if he only had to deal with a tail-ender"
"back of a length on off stump, blocks"
"<b>some seam</b>, pleasing amounts of it into the left-hander, and it catches Dhawan on the move! The fuller length is the problem. Gives no warning when the ball moves off the seam. Lucky for the batsman, he survives the <b>lbw appeal</b> because the movement is so great that it would've missed leg stump"
"a shade shorter than the previous ball, which allows Dhawan the extra time he needs to nudge the indipper off the pads towards midwicket"
"good length, outside off, holding its line. Pradeep getting it to deck both ways and Dhawan wisely doesn't go searching for it"
"short and wide outside off, Dhawan nails the cut behind point"
plays with a straight bat - that's an overall improvement in his game - to send the fuller ball on off stump to mid-off's right
"shortish and outside off, Abhinav jumps away from the line of the ball and punches to short cover"
"poor bowling again, he gives a batsman under pressure a short and wide delivery to feast on and Abhinav gets off the mark with a boundary through point"
"that's the advantage of a spinner with a new ball - the orthodox offbreak skids on with the arm, off a good length, and Abhinav, waiting on the back foot to cut again, finds point"
"another shortish delivery on off stump, which is drummed to cover. Abhinav looking to attack"
"tosses it up outside off, and he strides forward to block"
"moves back to a good length ball, accounts for the turn, and pushes it to cover"
"fullish length as he dangles the ball outside off, Dhawan isn't lulled by its siren song"
sweetly struck to the cover point boundary. Hits it on the up and connects right off the middle of the bat. Seems like he's batting on 190.
"back of a length and outside off, Dhawan moves back and across to then shoulder arms"
"looks for the yorker, which is tinged with some late inswing. Dhawan, by virtue of playing later and straighter than he usually does, sends it to mid-on"
"back of a length on off stump, Dhawan taps it to the right of cover and pinches a single"
refuses to play a perfectly good length ball outside off. How rude.
"too short and Dhawan pastes it to the point boundary, even with a man posted there. Sri Lanka are more than 300 runs behind the game and they're playing exactly like that"
"tosses it up outside off, Dhawan simply defends it, with soft hands to cover, and sets off"
"a little <b>drift</b> into the left-hander, makes him defend outside the line, and weather an lbw should. Would have gone down leg"
lunges forward to block on off stump to block
"too short, too wide, and on a slow pitch, the batsman has an easy put-away through point"
"<b>picks out point</b>! Dhawan walks off feeling short-changed, because he's found a way to fall to a ball that is short and wide. Now why has a man who's been timing the pants off the cricket ball been undone in such a way? Because the pitch holds this ball in it a little longer and it comes on a lot slower than Dhawan expects. He's into the cut so early, his bottom hand flies off the bat to indicate his lack of control and Danushka does the rest"
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go"
"<b>beautiful bowling</b>, pitches it right up, just a shade outside off stump, and gets it to straighten from around the wicket. Abhinav is wary of this ability of Pradeep and shoulders arms"
"<b>excellent leave</b> as he gets a good stride out, and across to protect the off stump, and leaves the ball outside his eyeline. The bounce on this Galle pitch should ensure such balls lob over the wickets"
"another fullish delivery, searching for the outside edge, Abhinav sticks his bat up the air where it won't cause any harm to anything"
"pitches it right up on off stump, ripe for the drive, but Abhinav goes after it half-heartedly and sends it back to the bowler"
defends a shortish delivery in line with the fourth stump
"<b>drift, delicious drift</b> and Pujara is beaten first ball, after spending about 250 of them in the first innings with a control percent of 99. That's because Dilruwan, from around the wicket, tosses it up on a fuller length and gives the batsman less time to read the ball off the pitch"
"presses forward on leg stump, with the ball on middle and then nudges it past short leg's right"
"he seems to have hit his length now. Gives it good air, pitches it on middle and leg, the new ball makes it skid onto Abhinav, who blocks in harried fashion"
"comes down the pitch, but his escape shot is not available. Can only hit it back to the bowler"
"targets the top of off, with a flatter, but fullish delivery. Abhinav goes back to block"
presses forward to block on off stump
"slips onto Pujara's pads, who then says thank you with a leg glance"
"rides the extra bounce rather well. He sets up for the late cut, but when it does a little bit off the pitch, he makes sure to roll his wrists on top of it and place it well to the right of the deep backward point"
"with only one man saving the single in front of the pitch on the on side, bowling short and at the body is a no-no. But Pradeep does it anyway, affording Abhinav an easy flick through midwicket"
"<b>ripper</b>! And yet he's bowled so many of these in this Test match. Banging it into a good length, getting it to jag away off the seam and beat the outside edge"
"follows it up with a fuller delivery on middle, which Pujara adores. Flicks it through square leg, meeting the ball close to his body, right under his eyes"
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
"loops it up onto off stump at 85 kph, Abhinav presses forward to push it to mid-off. Good that he's trying to reach the pitch of the balls when they're given some air"
"spots the flatter delivery, slinks back in his crease and protects the off stump with a straight bat"
"steps down, fluently, and clips down to short midwicket as he realises the bowler's adjusted to his premeditated foray"
"quicker, but still the length is full, so Pujara comes forward to block on off stump"

"back of a length and outside off, shows it no interest."
"'one,' he cries, after tapping a shortish delivery to the right of cover. Pujara responds early and India pinch it"
"width on offer, as the yorker lands about two inches short. That's all Pujara needs to lace a cover drive to the boundary. Shows you what class batsmen can do with the slightest error"
"starts from wide of the crease to give this good length ball, that he knows will straighten, a little leg up. Pujara though ruins all those plans by leaving it"
"back of a length and outside off, Pujara will leave those all day sipping a cold drink and singing his favourite song"
"tosses it up on off stump, Abhinav defends stoutly"
"fires it in on middle and off, defends"
"superb connection, through straight midwicket, not that he needed to place it all that well because there's a yawning gap there. He places it there though because he wants to play with a straight bat having quickly come down the track"
now he moves legside of a tossed up delivery on middle - essentially the same line as the last shot - and drives it through cover
"<b>yeah, two</b> yells Pujara but he'll have to settle for less after racing down the pitch and flicking a fuller ball off leg stump through midwicket"
"tosses it up on off stump, drawing the batsman forward, but not letting him reach the pitch. Good ball. The problem is he needs to produce it a lot more consistently"
"<b>good start</b>, he pitches it on a good length, gets it to jag in just a shade. But not enough for Pujara to think it'd threaten the off stump. So he leaves"
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
"full and outside off, those need no shots"
firm push to mid-on as he handles the short ball on a slow pitch with ridiculous ease
"that's better, pitching the ball right up on off stump, Pujara is reluctantly forward to block with soft hands"
<b>seems to keep a shade low</b> meaning this Pujara chop towards point goes off like a balloon with very little air being popped

nudges a fuller delivery on leg stump to short leg
shifts around the wicket for a <b>146 kph</b> short of a length delivery outside off. Abhinav lets it go through to the wicketkeeper
"<b>nearly bowls him</b>! That should remind him of the smallest margins that exist in the game, as he tries to pull a ball that isn't short, or wide enough to free the arms. The ball then thuds down into his own pads and trickles back towards his castle. Doesn't breach it though"
"another short ball, rising up towards his shoulder, Abhinav yanks it from outside off with a pull to square leg"
whips a 139 kph short ball on the pads to long leg

"<b>Caught at leg gully</b>! Kusal Mendis, under the helmet, plucks out a smart, smart catch. And the <strong>rain arrives in Galle</strong>. The groundstaff tear in with the covers. Mendis and the others depart as well. This was pretty full and angling into middle and leg from wide of the crease, Kumara asks Pujara to flick uppishly. The batsman obliges and strokes it firmly. The ball flies to Mendis crouching at leg gully. It bobbles out but Mendis sticks out his right hand and clings onto the catch, with just one hand, on the rebound. Pujara's flick is his strength but this one plays into Sri Lanka's hands as he does not keep it down"
"gets off the mark with a delicate little push past short cover, all that is needed when the ball is a full toss outside off."
"strides down the pitch, but by doing so he ends up way too close to the ball. Ends up squeezing it out to long-on"
"leans forward, keeping the front leg away so he can flick a tossed up ball targeted into the pads to short leg"

"good length ball outside off, Kohli waves to it as it passes by"
"<b>signs that he is not happy keeping quiet</b>. The first instance of a ball in line with the stumps and he looks for an extravagant flick - extravagant because he has to drag it, and because the bounce is too high for him to control the ball. In the end the though, the leading edge comes because he is too soon into the shot."
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
"good length, outside off, ignores it steadfastly. Be fun to hear the voices in his head right now."
takes another sight-seeing trip through the corridor of uncertainty. Kohli though misses the bus and is okay doing so
"strides into the cover drive, the front foot moving across to make sure the shot, if a touch on the up, carries little risk."

sees a tossed up delivery and wades into it with a drive to long-off
"fires it in on off stump, Abhinav clips it to short midwicket"
"launches it between long-on and deep midwicket. Hits with the turn, takes that option even after charging down the track and also ensures to pick the gap"
"flighted delivery on middle and off, nudges to short midwicket, the wrists working overtime because he isn't to the pitch of the ball"
"excellent shot to exploit a terrible ball. it's length, and down leg, so Abhinav sends it to the long leg boundary with a lap sweep and celebrates <b>a fifty</b>, his first since coming back to Test cricket for the first time in five years in the last home season"
steps forward to a good length ball on off stump and blocks
opens the face to glide a good length ball on fourth stump to deep point

"digs in a bouncer - he uses that so well, as if its a surprise weapon. This one though is too short and Kohli gets under it"
<b>inside edge</b> wanders through the vacant midwicket region. Kohli pokes at a back of a length delivery outside off without moving his feet across in line with it
"<b>well played</b>. He's started shuffling in front of off stump, with Pradeep angling the ball from wide of the crease, desperate for it to straighten away off the seam. But when that help off the pitch doesn't happen, Kohli can clip it to deep square leg, and if he can do it softly enough, there's always two"
"tosses it up outside off, Abhinav lashes it to short cover"
"pushes it through on leg stump, he drives it to long-on"
"flatter delivery on leg stump, whips it to deep square leg"

tries to drag a back of a length ball kicking and screaming from off stump through midwicket. The leading edge pops up to laugh at everyone and then exit stage left
"has him driving away from the body, with his front foot not quite moving far enough forward or across. Somehow his wrists keep the ball down to cover"
"wades into the good length ball outside off and drills it to cover about 2/3 the way to the boundary. The fielder sends in a throw at the striker's end. Misses, and Kohli pinches a second"
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
"goes for the short ball outside off, Kohli holds his fire"
"another bouncer on off stump, Kohli lets it fly over his head."
"thinks he has a single off an inside edged flick into the leg side, but it's not gone so far that the wicketkeeper can't hunt it down"

punches a short delivery outside off to cover point
doesn't stride far enough forward for the cover drive to work properly. Has to settle for an inside edge that goes nowhere
steers a shortish delivery outside off past gully and to deep third man
"defends a good length ball outside off to point, which is entirely vacant so cover point, deep third man and deep point have to converge on this. Kohli tries to exploit that and take two, but can't"
"low full toss outside off, skews off the inside half of Abhinav's bat to mid-on"
spears a wide yorker to cover point. <b>India lead by 450 now</b>
"flays the overpitched delivery through cover and even though it goes straight to the fielder, the power in the shot makes him misfield. <b>it appears to be Herath there, and he might have hurt his bowling hand</b>"
"pushes it through outside off, when all his cover is on the leg side, and Kohli profits with a cut behind point"
"good length ball, from over the wicket now, Kohli glides it through point for a couple"

opens the face to squeeze a 139 kph near-yorker to deep point
taps a shortish delivery outside off to mid-on
"he's reverted to the old short of a length deliveries and Abhinav doesn't mind this ploy, working it off his left hip to deep midwicket"
"that's much better, asks a few more questions when he pitches the ball up in line with the stumps and Abhinav dodges them all with an inside edge through midwicket"
"opens the face to find the boundary at third man to bring up the <b>hundred partnership</b>. The fielder could have done better there, preferring to plant a boot on it instead of doing more."

"good length ball outside off, Abhinav drives to the left of short cover, whose dive doesn't work properly"

"short and wide outside off, Mukund rolls his wrists on top of the ball and square-cuts it away"
"Kumara ventures wide of the crease, gets it to slant in late, but finishes outside off, Kohli does not go after it"
<strong>Kohli chases this one and nearly nicks off.</strong> Good length and hung up wider outside off - wider than a set of stumps outside off - Kohli simply reaches out with hard hands and has an impatient jab at it. Beaten on the outside edge
"good length and much closer to off, Kohli tightens up. No shot"
"good rhythm from Kumara. Banged in short and angled in on top of off, Kohli jumps off the ground and pats it down onto the pitch"
"Kumara teases Kohli outside off. This is very, very full in the channel. The quick asks Kohli to drive away from the body. The Indian captain says ' no, not this time'"
"<strong>Dilruwan finds the leading edge</strong> but this one does not carry to cover. Tossed up on middle, dips, as Mukund advances down the track. He aims to flick it across the line but gets away"
whipped off the pads through square leg

"non-turner on middle, defended"
"full on middle, stretches out and drives it to midwicket with the wrists"
spins in on leg stump - against the angle from around the wicket - Kohli deals with it on the back foot

"head-hunting short ball on the leg stump, tucks up Mukund. He hooks it off a top-edge and gets a fortunate boundary to fine leg"
this is short as well but this is merely a hip-high ball. But the pace rattles Mukund. He is late onto a pull and is pinged on the thigh pad. They sneak across for a leg bye
"Kohli flings his hands at another wide ball in the channel. This is in fact an off-side wide. Really full and wide outside off, <strong>Kohli wafts and is beaten</strong>"

"slides on outside off, punched just wide of backward point for a tight, tight one. Oh wait, the sub fielder Bandara throws at the bowler's end, but there is no backing up, and the ball scurries away to the boundary. Five runs in the end for India. A direct hit could have dismissed Mukund"

"Ooooh! <strong>Ripaaah from Dilruwan</strong>. Fuller than a good length, drifts in from around the wicket, bounces, and breaks away past the defensive bat of Mukund. The keeper gathers the ball and takes the bails off. Mukund was left overbalanced but he dragged his back foot back in time. This ball raises a puff of dust from the surface. Ashwin and Jadeja will be licking their lips"
"full on middle, pushed back to the bowler"
"very full and drifts across off, punchily driven to long-off on the front foot"
"this looks quite plumb and umpire Oxenford raises his finger! <strong>Mukund, though, asks for a review</strong>. Slides in with the angle from around the wicket, non-turner, Mukund has a short stride and plays down the wrong line. He is pinned on the front pad below the knee-roll in line with middle. The tracker shows the ball would go onto hit middle and leg. First Test wicket for Danushka, and SL have something to show for this session"
"pushed through on off, Rahane deploys a short stride and works it defensively to short midwicket"
"<b>Horrble mix-up</b>, and Sri Lanka throw the ball to the wrong end. Rahane shows intent right away, he dances down the track and drives it to mid-off, where Kumara is hanging back. Rahane hurtles down the pitch. He is more than halfway down the pitch. Kohli is least interested in a single, and sends his partner back. Instead of throwing to the keeper's end, Kumara spears a direct hit at the non-striker's end. It amounts to nothing"
"drifts across off, shorter in length, Rahane leans back and punches it through point"
"flat and angled across off,  punched to sweeper. <b>India's lead touches 500</b>"

"<strong>Dropped by Kohli at second slip</strong>! Straightforward chance. This is an excellent ball. Good length, angled in on off, forces Tharanga to play.

"back of a length and outside off, tapped into the covers"
"Shami does not need any assistance from his fielders. He <b>cleans up Tharanga</b> all by himself. This is an even better ball. Back of a length, angling in, snakes back in from outside off.

<strong>turn and bounce</strong>! Saha mounts a caught-behind appeal. On-field umpire Oxenford turns it down. Kohli chooses to challenge it. This proves successful for India. Mendis has to exit. This was pushed through quicker and lifting outside off. Mendis has a defensive poke at it in the channel. He plays inside the line as the ball grazes the outside edge near the higher part of the bat and settles into the gloves of Saha. There's a spike on Ultra Edge. The keeper rides the bounce and snaffles it. Umpire Oxenford's on-field call has been reversed. Sri Lanka are three down and effectively four down
