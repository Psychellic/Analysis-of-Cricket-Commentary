"tossed up outside off and what a start for Taylor, his feet moving nicely into the ball, opens the face and drives it through the covers"
"slower and and tossed up again, makes him reach, Taylor pushes and nearly lobs it to cover this time"
"shorter and quicker around off, pushed down the ground to long-off for one"
"full and angled in, Masakadza looks to blast this down the ground but doesn't time it"
"slower and full around middle, Masakadza pushes at it but eludes Shakib to his right for one to mid-on"
"slower and shorter outside off, Taylor turns it around towards midwicket off the backfoot for one"
"<strong>would you believe it, wicket first ball for Taijul and the crowd erupts!</strong> It was tossed up around middle and off, Taylor went for the slog sweep first up but seemed to have misjudged the length which was slightly shorter than he would have liked, the extra bounce induced the top edge, taken easily at short third man. Poor shot, it has to be said"
"length around off, pushed down the ground for one"
"length around the pads, spins down the leg side"
"length and angled across, pushed into the covers"
"length around middle and leg, the ball grips off the surface and cramps him for room"

"length and around the pads, spins down the leg side"
"landing outside off, fetched uppishly into the leg side, but can't beat midwicket"
"drifting wide of the off stump, he throws his hands into a drive and slices to short third man for a single"
<b>beaten by turn and bounce!</b> The ball dips on him and then rips away from a poke outside off
"attempted reverse sweep now, but it zips past him into the keeper's gloves"
"flatter, aimed at the off stump, and it's chopped hard, but straight to cover"
"<b>this time he nails it!</b> Another reverse sweep, but this time he gets an excellent connection to slap it with the spin, down to third man"
"and he starts with a nippy yorker, the ball dipping and swinging in to Ervine's boot. There's a speculative appeal, but that was headed down leg"
"more shape away from the right hander, tapped to cover"
"another yorker, but it's not quite on the mark, dug out to mid on and they pinch a quick single"
"curving in towards Ervine's pads, and he's nudged just wide of midwicket for another single"
"<b>picked up over fine leg!</b> Trademark shot from Masakadza, putting his left leg down the track and bending down low to scoop a length ball up over the fielder at fine leg, using the pace"
"this one's aimed directly at the off stump, Masakadza pushing to cover and sending Ervine back with a loud 'no!'"
"<b>powerfully swept!</b> Ervine got himself into a good position, sweeping over the top of it and cracking the ball right into the gap at deep square leg"
"he's down the track this time, skipping into position and chipping the ball out to deep midwicket"
"a touch flatter this time, and it's flicked along the ground to that man at deep midwicket"
"<b>HUGE!</b> Masakadza gets down on one knee, opens those broad shoulders and smears a slog sweep into stands beyond midwicket"
"<b>too short, too wide!</b> Taijul over-corrects, spearing the ball in short outside off. Masakadza leans back and spanks a cut behind square"
"that's better, held back a touch and Masakadza has to wait on it before punching out to deep cover"
"he starts straight, on a length, and is worked just wide of midwicket for a single"
"<b>just wide of a diving fielder!</b> Mustafizur drifts into Ervine's pads and is clipped into the leg side, but uppishly and only just wide of a diving Mahmudullah inside the circle. They're back for two, <b>bringing up the fifty</b>"
"<b>beaten outside off</b>, the ball angling in and then nipping away from Ervine, who had set himself to flick to leg but missed completely"
"<b>short, pulled, and caught!</b> Ervine didn't look too rushed, but simply didn't time it as he'd have liked. Mosaddek was perfectly positioned at deep midwicket, and juggles the take, but holds on"
"pitched right up to him, and snaking in through the air. Masakadza digs it out back at the bowler"
"full once more, but slower this time. Masakadza reads it, and finds space just wide of mid off for a single"
"he makes room early, backing away to leg, but the bowler follows him and there's not much room to work with. Tapped down the ground, just the one"
"<b>big swing!</b> Williams is a little fortunate as this curves sharply in to him, taking the inside half of the bat and rolling to leg to get him off the mark"
"down the track comes Masakadza, slugging a single down to long on"
"a touch of width outside off now, and he's crunched neatly out to deep cover"
"<b>slapped in the air, snaffled at mid off!</b> Again Masakadza made room, but Saifuddin followed him, cramping his attempted smear down the ground. He couldn't get under it, and Sabbir tumbles forward at mid off to hold a very sharp catch"
"this one hits the seam and comes back in to him, Maruma working him softly into the leg side"
"<b>and he strikes first ball!</b> Williams is caught in two minds, aiming down the ground but checking his shot. The end result is the simplest of return catches back to Mosaddek"
"quicker, flatter and rushing on with the arm. Burl is forward to keep it out"
"he makes room now, cutting straight to point"
"Burl reaches out at a wide one, driving to long off to get off the mark"
"reverse paddle sweep from Maruma, who has to jam the bat down to get something on a very full one"
"worked off the toes, into the leg side, and a single keeps him on strike"
"<b>classy drive!</b> Mustafizur offers up a full, wide half volley. Burl leans forward and opens the face of the bat to drive behind point with poise and timing"
"<b>just short of mid off!</b> Burl is suckered into another drive, but this one's slower and Mustafizur has rolled his fingers over it. He's way too early into the shot, but the timing is so bad that it doesn't quite reach the mid off fielder diving forward"
"<b>needless run out!</b> Burl fends a quicker one into the leg side, and Maruma sets off. Burl initially takes a step down the wicket, but then stops and sends him back. But he's too late. Maruma turns on his heels and dives for his crease, but a sharp throw from Shakib catches him short, Mustafizur getting himself into position and whipping the bails off"
flung down wide outside off
"full and swinging in from outside off, Burl's drive being stopped at cover"

"floated up a little slower, glanced off the pads just wide of midwicket"
"reverse swept, straight at the short third man fielder, but they take him on with a quick single, and win"
"another tip-and-run single, Mutombodzi putting bat to ball towards cover and setting off"
"Burl backs away acres towards the leg side, but Shakib follows him with a dart that zips under his bat, and past the leg stump"
"this time he stays put, tapping back to the bowler"
"another reverse sweep, this one finds the gap and a single"
"he skips down the track to get close to it, working it out to deep midwicket to keep the strike"
"again he uses his feet, getting to the pitch and crunching a drive down to long on"
"drifting in towards his pads, and Burl finds a gap in front of square"
"<b>beaten outside off!</b> It was a quicker one, rushing straight on with the arm to beat him"
"quick again, and he's down the wicket to meet it but can't quite get to the pitch. Mosaddek charges down the pitch and hurls a shy to send him scurrying back to the crease"
"slog swept into the leg side, and they hurry back for a second. He didn't get all of it, and the ball flew <i>just</i> past a diving Shakib at midwicket. That wasn't far away"
"shorter this time, but he can't make the most of the long hop, pulling hard but straight to Shakib at midwicket"
"Burl jumps down the track, slashing a length ball out to the sweeper"

"Saifuddin ends an excellent over with a very full one, outside off, that Mutombodzi digs out but can't put away"
"yorker, swinging in from outside off, and it's jammed out to cover"
"good-looking flick from Tino, but the placement's not quite there to find the boundary"
"<b>crunched over wide long on!</b> Mustafizur has got the better of Burl with a couple of slower ones, but this one was read well and timed even better. A little step back and across made room, and he spanked the leather off it"
"<b>innovation now</b>, Burl walking across to the off side and keeping his eye on the ball to scoop a full one up and over the fine leg fielder"
rattled! Burl stands still at the crease but Mustafizur sprays this well wide outside off
"he follows him with a short ball, Burl muscling a pull out to deep midwicket"
"another short one, a slower bouncer, and Tino almost swings himself off his feet trying to deposit this over the leg side. But the ball loops past him, and he's only hit fresh air"
"<b>and there's Burl!</b> He takes a couple of steps to the off side, creating the line he wants, and swings a <b>MASSIVE</B> six over deep backward square with a big slog sweep"
"<b>crunched down the ground now!</b> Shakib darts this in quicker, but it's too short and Burl slams a pull straight back past him, beating the diving long on"
"<b>and now the reverse sweep</b>, Burl getting himself quickly into position before the ball arrives and placing the shot perfectly"
"<b>carnage!</b> The ball is floated up harmlessly on his toes, and Burl opens his shoulders to swipe it over square leg. The fielder out there was briefly interested in it, but it flew over his head"
"<b>Burl is unstoppable</b>, bending down low and spanking the ball cleanly into the leg side, placing it right between the two fielders out there"
"<b>fifty up, and what a way to get there!</b> Burl stands still at the crease, sizes up a full one, and swings it cleanly down the ground. His maiden T20I fifty, and a vital one for Zimbabwe"
"pinpoint yorker, just outside off, and it's dug out into the off side. Burl spots the chance for a quick single, and calls him through"
"slower ball, on a length, and it's fetched out to deep midwicket"
"another nippy yorker, and Tino does well to put bat to ball, getting it into the leg side to turn the strike back over"
"a slower ball bouncer, and he spots it early but can't quite place the pull"
"<b>Tino joins the party!</b> Length from the bowler, and he was set in the crease and waiting for it. He gets an excellent connection, and the ball flies way over the fielder's head at deep midwicket"
"another yorker, and he can't get under it, picking up a single to long off"
"full, wide yorker to start, and he digs it out to the cover sweeper, putting Burl back on strike"
"Burl in a tangle! He walks right across to off and looks to set himself for a paddle-scoop, but Mustafizur follows him and Burl almost falls over his own feet"
"slashing square drive now, but he can't beat the deep point fielder"
"full toss, outside off, and Tino flings his hands out into a drive. A thick edge flies past the keeper, and it has the beating of third man too"
"ouch! Mutombodzi swings hard and inside edges the ball straight onto his own knee. Burl wants a single, but Tino is on the ground and can't go anywhere. The ball struck him just above the knee roll"
"big drive, inside out over wide mid off. Did Soumya lose it in the lights? He wasn't too quick off the mark, and the ball comes safely to ground. They hurry back for the second"
"length around off, hint of turn away, he watches it closely under his eyes and defends"
"short and around off, spinning away, Liton has plenty of time to wait for it to come and turn it around towards midwicket with his wrists"
"full around middle, Soumya plants his frontfoot across and has to play around it, manages to push it to midwicket and they scamper a single that ideally shouldn't have been there"
"short and angled in, Liton makes room to open up the off side, cuts it straight to point"
"<strong>Liton seems to have a measure of the bowling by now and he's deposited that over deep backward square leg!</strong> It was angled in on a length, he shuffled across to get inside the line and just helped it along with the angle, the final flourish giving him the power to clear the ropes"
"slower and fuller around off, waits for it and defends off the backfoot"
"full on the pads, tickled towards short fine leg off an inside edge that took a bit of pad with it"
"length and angled in, nearly chipped to short fine-leg as Liton picked it up off his hip, of course, it would have been four either side, so decide who's unlucky there"
overpitched around off and Liton goes through the line and over the bowler's head for a glorious boundary down the ground
"shortens his length, around off again, Liton swats this over the cover field but the timing's not great for more than two"
"length and angled in, slower ball, tucked away towards midwicket and it's going to be free hit for a front foot no-ball. Sloppy from Zimbabwe"
"excellent come back! Held his nerve, banged it half way down but slowed it up appreciably, completely deceived Soumya who was through his flat batted stroke way too early"
"bouncer, around middle and Soumya's beaten for pace this time as he misses the pull. Good comeback from Jarvis"
"wide on the crease, length around off, squared him up almost as it was threatening to come in with the angle but straightened, played nice and late in the end, taps it to the off side for one"
"length around middle, bit of nibble back in cramping Soumya for room, but he taps it near his feet and they take off for one"
"another no ball, another free hit, it was length around off, steered to point, who palmed it over his head to allow one and what's more, they steam another on the overthrow"
"slower one, short outside off, Liton waits for it and slaps it over backward point and to third-man's right on a couple of bounces for another couple"
"length outside off, Liton shuffles way outside off, looking to scoop this perhaps, but it's too wide for him to fetch, gets a legbye as the ball deflects fine off the shoulder"
"length around off, airy-fairy drive from Soumya as he looks to go through the covers, and nearly chips one to mid-off"
"cleans him up with an inch-perfect yorker! Liton backed away too far and too soon, so far they were feeding him outside off, but this was straight, full and right up in the blockhole. Zimbabwe have an opening after a pretty shoddy start"
"slower ball full around off and the impetuousness of the Bangladesh batsmen is showing! Soumya Sarkar wanted to loft this over the infield, got it off the toe end and just scooped a simple catch to mid-off to really bring Zimbabwe into the game here"
"banged in hard into the surface and at Shakib's body, he fends it off awkwardly towards short fine leg but manages to keep it down"
"<strong>nearly chipped to mid-off!</strong> Slower ball outside off, holds in the surface, Shakib pushes with his hands way in front and nearly spoons a catch to mid-off, running to his right"
<strong>short one at the body does trickl!</strong> Mushfiqur was looking to help this along somewhere towards fine-leg but seemed to take his eyes off it as it hurried onto him and took the shoulder of the blade for a simple catch to Taylor behind the wickets
"another one short around off, lets it through"
"slower one, off cutter around off, grips off the surface and comes sharply back into Mahmudullah, who does well to tap it near his feet and take off for a quick single"
"wide on the crease and full outside off with a hint of away movement, left alone"
"full around off, Mahmudullah was shuffling across to cover the swing, got into a bit of an awkward tangle but manages to push it to the leg side for one"
"<strong>and Shakib goes to an atrocious stroke!</strong> It was a length ball, angled across, Shakib was rooted to the crease and chased it with just his hands, only managing a healthy nick to slip to leave his team precariously placed"
"full around off, pushed to mid-on and they come through for a quick single"
"length outside off, left alone"

"length outside off, and Bangladesh continue to play their shots, Sabbir this time, fetches it and flat bats it past mid-on, like a tennis shot for four"
"short one at the body, pulls this time, but with control and along the ground to deep backward square leg"
"<strong>snorter but somehow none of three people converging manage to get to it!</strong> That was another short one at the body, Mahmudullah tried to awkwardly turn it around to the leg side, much like Mushfiqur, it took the shoulder off the bat as he kind of took his eyes of at the last instant, but survives despite the hang time it had with the keeper, slip and bowler all interested at one point, but neither getting to it"

"slower short one outside off, Sabbir attempts about three shots but it still never comes on and eventually goes past his slashing blade"
"<strong>plays back to a flatter one and given by the umpire, Burl's having a ball!</strong> Looks very very leg side, it was a length ball, angled in, he tried to work it to the leg side off the backfoot and missed as it skid on, he reviews but ball tracking reveals it would have just kissed leg stump.
