"short and a touch faster on middle, tucked toward square leg"
"slider angling in from around the stumps, Munaweera plays all around the delivery. Hit on the pad but this would've missed the stumps"
"cleaned him up. Munaweera goes for an expansive drive, plays with a big gap between bat and pad. The ball drifts back in to sneak through the gap and hit top of middle. Dipped on him just a touch as well. Poor start again for Sri Lanka."
"full and angling into middle and leg, flicked uppishly into the gap at midwicket"
"angles back in from wide of the crease, tucked between square leg and short fine leg"
makes room and slices this uppishly over cover. Looked to go over mid-off but didn't get underneath the flight. Good thing about the stroke was he went full throttle and didn't hold back.
"audacious! What confidence from this young man. Length ball angling away, he sashays down the pitch and whips this over midwicket. Excellent use of the bottom hand. <b> Touch of Kevin Pietersen in that stroke </b>"
"big appeal, Pakistanis can't believe how that wasn't given, but when they look at the replays, they'll realise it brushed the thigh pad on the way. This short of length delivery cut him into half as he played outside the line. Good carry to Sarfraz. The appeal was spontaneous"
play and a miss. Looks to flay this on the up over backward point. This moved away off the seam

steps out and works this gently towards midwicket
steps out and whips this in-drifter towards deep square leg

"beaten. This zippy length ball on middle and off jagged away just a bit, he looked to make room and go over cover but swung through early."
"superb! Too short and sliding in, he walks across the stumps and scoops this over short fine leg."
defends this incoming length ball back down the pitch
"looked to swing this into Sheikh Zayed Road, could only manage a thin nick through to Sarfraz. Once again backed away a long way to go downtown, head looking away as he tried to expend every ounce of energy in hitting that, gentle nick. Shinwari is pumped."
"length ball angling away, he covers the line of the delivery in defence"
"classy drive, but straight to backward point"

turns this incoming delivery with soft hands towards the man coming in from short midwicket

swing and a miss. Looked to belt this over cover but played early again

"beaten by the zip off the pitch. Effort ball at 136kph, he looks to go over point but the bounce got him there. Cramped for room as well"
"flies away over the keeper's head off the helmet, but it's given as runs. He'll take those runs into his kitty. Beaten for pace by that short ball. Excellent"
"back of length outside off, left alone. On the bounce to Sarfraz"
"floats this full outside off, worked to mid-on"
"angles in a full-length delivery on middle from wide of the crease, squeezed to mid-on"
driven on the up to deep cover

steps out and turns this quicker delivery to deep square leg
"too short, he rocks and pulls to deep midwicket"

"googly that spins back in to cramp him for room, tucked to square leg"
lovely little chip shot. Makes room and lofts this inside-out to wide long-off
"<b> a direct hit at the bowler's end and he would've been gone. </b> This is tucked towards short midwicket, Shadab runs across on his followthrough, slides and gets to the ball. Quickly turns to fire the throw that is wide."
steers a length ball down to third man
sensational delivery! Samarawickrama plays outside the line of this length ball that nips back in to beat the inside edge and flatten the leg stump. In no position to force that on the up.
"looks to force this through the off side, just manages to get a thick inside edge onto the pad in defence"
driven to mid-off as he gets off the mark. Looked to hit it straighter than that

"slides across the left-hander from around the stumps, defended towards midwicket"
"should've been stopped, bowler dives over this mishit to concede a single"
thick bottom edge off a pull to short fine leg
"looks to play a cute little reverse sweep, all he manages to do it hit it with the spin to short third man. A metre on either side and it would've been four. Pressure was building on him, the struggle was on to hit down the ground, so he tried to hit behind square. Couldn't do that either. Sri Lanka slide further."
"slider on off stump, dinks this to the fielder coming in from point"
swept with the spin to the deep square leg boundary. Picked the gap superbly.
"leading edge off a wrong'un, down to long-on"
"shapes to cut but is cramped for room, dabs this to short third man somehow"
"appeal for lbw as the batsman moved inside the line to pull, but the ball may have pitched outside leg. They scamper a run though"
"strikes with his first ball. Drifts in from around the stumps, grips the surface and spins away to hit him on middle and off. Udawatte is deceived by the slowness of the delivery, looks to turn this across but played too early and missed it completely. The bat got stuck around the side of the pad as he looked to turn this away"
turns this to the leg side
"worked with the spin to short midwicket. Sliding stop by Nawaz, all his mates run up to slap him a high five"
"classic offspinner's dismissal. Draws him out of the crease in flight, Shanaka plays a nothing shot and simply looks to ease it to the off side having stepped out. The ball holds its line and Sarfraz whips the bails off in a jiffy."
defends this incoming delivery from the crease
spins back in sharply to hit him high on the thigh pad
"slides a full delivery into middle and leg, tucked away past midwicket"
"looks to force this length delivery through cover, gets a thick inside edge as the ball hits the pad and scoots along. He has no clue where the ball went. <b> Hasan mimicked as if he was taking a return catch </b>"
"this time, he really catches one and Hasan can't believe how easily he's got this wicket. Skiddy bouncer which Pathirana looks to pull but is beaten for pace and the ball skews off the top part of the bat to Hasan, who gleefully accepts it"
"looks to back away and slap this over cover, but is beaten as he swung through early"
ducks under this short ball that climbs onto him. Cramped him for room as well. Excellent bouncer.
"welcome boundary. Too short, this one was sitting up nicely for him to pull and Thisara clobbered that into the midwicket region"
"slow turn from middle and off, defended to the man coming in from square leg"
"into the stands at wide long-on. Too much flight, Prasanna's eyes lit up as he belted this. Got underneath the delivery and simply muscled it. Was in his hitting arc in all fairness. Cry of anguish from Hafeez"
turns this gently towards the man coming in from deep midwicket. Shouldn't have been more than a single. Sarfraz is furious
thick edge past Imad at short third man. Played for the turn but the ball skid on this time. Two more
punched with the spin to midwicket

"another one fired in with a scrambled seam, at 115kph, defended"

muscles this pull towards deep square
"bouncer that he angles across at 134kph, looked to fetch the hook from way outside off but he played too late this time"
mistimes a slog to deep midwicket. Got it off a thick inside edge
"this is simply sensational from Usman. He knows Thisara is winding up to pull so bangs in a short ball on middle, he still looks to muscle it despite being cramped but can only get a top-edge. Sarfraz spots it, calls for it loud and clear as he runs to his right. The swirler comes down, all the fielders are clear of the captain, most probably for the fear of being yelled at by the skipper, but Sarfraz gleefully accepts it and gives his mates a hug. Thisara was completely done in by that short ball."
"gentle little push to short cover as they scamper a run, there's an overthrow at the bowler's end"
the length ball nips back in to scoot under the bottom edge and flatten off stump. Udana had no clue about that in-dipper. Played as if he was protecting his life
"reverse swing? Honing in from outside off, gets a thick inside edge to deep square leg"
yorker-length delivery that has been squeezed down the ground to long-on
"full-length delivery outside off, driven to Imad at mid-off"
"short and sliding down leg, he looks to pull but can't get any bat on it"

gentle little dab to that length ball on off stump
"length outside off, wafts at the delivery without any conviction, beaten"
"backs away but the bowler angles in to follow him, defends as he's cramped for room"
pinged the middle of the bat as it flew over the infield to sweeper cover
pulled from outside off towards deep square leg
"floats in a full delivery on middle from wide of the crease, defended past the bowler for a quick single"
"looks to muscle this over long-on but can't get any power behind the swing, toe-ends it to the fielder"
"set himself up for the pull, once this was landed short, he was ready. Pulled from outside off. Deep square tried to leap high and palm the ball back in, but couldn't because of the sheer velocity of the ball. Fakhar Zaman was the fielder"
"another pull, this time it's a flat hit to deep square"
"deceived by the slower one, looked to clear mid-off but checked his shot as the ball gripped on the surface and he ended up scooping this straight to extra cover. <b> These are Hasan Ali's best T20I figures </b>"
"a full swinging delivery outside off, inswing. Nice line, the length a tad too full, jammed back to the bowler"
"a low full toss around middle and leg, some shape in the air, coming back in, driven to mid-on"
"<strong>just wide of mid-on.</strong> Zaman wants to finish this chase in the Powerplay. Full and moving back in, Zaman clears his front leg and gives it everything, the ball skews off the inside half and just evades mid-on to his right. May have even got a hand on it."
"I like this strategy from Zaman, just going after it. A low full toss outside off, driven to extra cover"
"when he chooses timing over power, he looks so much better. Anyone does, honestly. A slower delivery outside off, a languid drive looks destined for the cover boundary before short cover leaps to his right and gets a hand on it. Saved two"
"a slower ball to finish, 84 kph, skewed back to the bowler"
"a yorker on leg, worked away through midwicket for one. The easiest single Shehzad will get this game. What are these tactics? Unless it was to get the left-hander on strike, that's appalling."
"quick and straight, on leg, worked to midwicket"
"oh gosh, there is, full delivery on middle, clipped to midwicket for one more veryyyyyy eaaasssyy run"
"runs down does Zaman and looks to hit through the line but the ball skews off the inside half, towards deep midwicket"
"aaargh, tear-your-hair out bowling, a gentle delivery on leg, worked to deep midwicket."
"flat and straight, around off, defended back. Riskless five off that. Sri Lanka got to do better than that."
"nicely bowled, full delivery, the ball swinging away, outside off, left alone."
"good length around off, 127 kph, skewed towards midwicket for one. Good batting, soft hands"
"looking to hit everything too hard. And Zaman's gone. A fistpump from Sanjaya. A full delivery swinging in, Zaman comes charging at the bowler, looking to hit the ball through the off side, but he yorked himself instead. The ball swings in between bat and pad and knocks back leg stump. First strike, fight SL, fight."
"full delivery around off, worked away into the leg side"
strays well down leg for a wide.
"128 kph, good length outside off, nice lines, defended back"
"on a length around off, flicked away to mid-on. Fine, fine over. But would like to see SL attack more."
"<b>maaaaasssive appeal</b>. No says umpire Raza. Quick around middle and leg, the ball skids on, hits Shehzad on the front pad, then the back pad, both pads, may have been sliding down. Good call to me, clipping the outside of leg stump says HawkEye"
pushed into the off side
"wonderful bowling, slow outside off, the ball spins away and beats the bat. Lovely pace, <strong>just slowing it up</strong>"
"now getting some spin too. Flat outside off, the ball rips away, Shehzad thinks of cutting, bails out late after seeing turn"
"shortish on leg, worked away towards deep midwicket, very watchful"
"steps down, gets to the flight and drills a drive to extra cover. Terrific over from Pathirana"
"<b>right through him</b>. The ball definitely doing something. Good length outside off, the ball jags back in prodigiously and cuts Shehzad in half. Almost hits off stump"
"eeks, sloppy. Good length outside off, tapped towards Gunathilaka at point, his right. Shehzad wants one, Azam sends him back. Gunathilaka, one of the best fielders in the world, misfields and allows one. He is sensational at point, so good call from Azam. But the fumble allows one"
"good length outside off, punched towards extra cover. Azam on the charge"
"full and wide outside off, skewed towards cover from the crease. Lovely lines"
"short and wide outside off, slashed down to third man"
"that's what will happen if you don't take wickets. Batsmen grow in confidence, like Shehzad, who comes dancing down at Udana and carves a cut through point. Fine timing."
"Sri Lanka are in raptures. And they should be. Pathirana has done Azam in with a lovely display of flight and loop. Tosses this one up outside off, Azam sees that flight and wants to go over cover, but doesn't account for turn, which there is. The ball rips past the outside edge and the wicketkeeper quickly takes off the bails in one motion. That's a proper, proper wicket, the man in form too"
"lovely bowling, well played too. Flight outside off, driven to long-off for one. That's the right shot to play"
"pushed through, on the pads, clipped towards short fine leg. Planted his front foot right across"
"short and wide, coming back in, sliding back, Shehzad chops this into the off side"
"lots of flight on leg, flicked away to deep midwicket"
"good single. Pushed towards mid-on for one, not over-hit"
"lots of flight to start from Prasanna, carved away to the sweeper cover for one. Opened the bat face late"
"pushed through, quick around off, defended to cover"
"steps out, Prasanna fires this short down leg, clips the pad en route to square leg for a leg bye"
"<strong>all class from Malik</strong>. Just terrific batting. Short and wide from Prasanna, Malik thinks of cutting but seeing the width on it, he executes a late cut past third man, earning him two more than a cut to the sweeper cover."
"87 kph, quick around leg, worked away towards deep square leg for one"
"oh my, what a player. Just too good. Short and wide from Prasanna again, Malik gets his bat down at just the right time to ensure his cut goes right into the gap between short third man and point. <strong>Shot of the day</strong>"
"good proactivity. Slow outside off, Shehzad gets low and paddles a fine sweep towards fine leg. Well played"
"quick on off, a thick inside edge into the pad"
"oh no, extras. Slow but down leg, goes through Samarawickrama's legs and runs away down for five extras. That's unfortunate"
"shortish outside off, chopped to deep point, used the depth of the crease well"
"84 kph, slow around off, driven with the spin to long-off"
"flight outside off, nicely hit to the sweeper cover for one."
"there he goes again, Malik. This is flatter and straight, around off, he opens the bat face late and guides this past third man for a couple"
"loopy around off, Shehzad goes back and punches towards cover"
"tossed up outside off, driven to long-off again"
"short down leg, worked away towards deep square leg for one"
"shortish and wide, carved down to short third man for none"
"77 kph, flight outside off, some drift in, driven back to the bowler"
"49 mph, drifty delivery on leg, worked to deep midwicket"
"nice lift. Shortish delivery outside off, 130 kph, Malik knows ramping is a dangerous stroke, so he lets it go"
"another fine cut from Malik. Short and wide outside off, slashed behind backward point for a couple. The third man fielder gets around and cuts it off"
"to the other side of the point fielder this time Short and wide outside off, Malik watches the ball onto his cut, placed intentionally in front of the fielder."
"134 kph, that's a better length. Full outside off, driven away towards mid-off for a quick single"
"a yorker outside off, jammed away for one"
"133 kph, overpitched delivery outside off, driven towards mid-off"
"full on off, worked away towards midwicket"
"Gunathilaka at point. Not much will get past him. Full outside off, carved away towards backward point where Gunathilaka dives away to his right to save a couple"
"drops short, around off, Shehzad gets on top of the bounce and pulls away towards deep midwicket for one"
"inside-edged past the keeper. Malik using all edges of his bat really well. Shortish and wide outside off, the ball seaming back in, french cut past the keeper's left for four more"
"full around off, hit off the inside half of the bat to long-on"
"good length delivery around off, 134 kph, punched to long-on for another easy single. What is happening? Pakistan just cruising. SL not doing anyyythinnnng"
"80 mph, don't know what else to say other than that is one more easy run. Full and straight, driven to long-on."
"another short delivery down leg, helped along to fine leg, one more. Eaaaasssyyyy as ..."
"given by the umpire. And Shehzad walks off. He has been strangled down the leg side. Full down leg, Shehzad gets a bit of bat on his flick, the keeper dives low to his left and takes a good catch. The umpire noticed that the bat was away from the pad, and there was a noise, so relatively easy decision."
"help yourself, Hafeez. Take one to deep square leg with 40 to win in a small chase, on the pads, an easy flick."
"a nice short delivery, on middle, but Malik helps himself to one to fine leg. Too easy for Pakistan. I'm losing it."
"one to mid-on, what? 130 kph, full around off, pushed to mid-on for one. There is no pressure to the new man in a very very small chase. Why? Why? Why?"
"Hafeez would like nothing else than just push one to on-on off a full delivery. I'm sorry, I give up"
"lots of flight on off, driven back to the bowler"
makes some room for himself and drives to the sweeper cover for a run
"on the pads, 82 kph, clipped away past short fine leg for a couple more easy runs"
"flight on leg, pushed to long-on, 80 kph."
"Malik goes again. Gets a short, wide offering. He arches his back to make room and then nails a cut through backward point. Shot!"
"full around off, Hafeez runs down, gets close to the pitch and then lifts the ball over mid-on. Not great timing, but good enough"
"good length outside off, 128 kph, pushed away to cover"
"shortish and wide, may have been the legcutter, cut down to third man for one"
"good stop from the fielder, Shanaka. Short and wide again, Malik nails a cut down to third man, who runs to his right, watches and waits for the ball to spin, and does well after there is none"
"a short delivery around off, Hafeez gets underneath it"
"124 kph, short around off, 77 mph, pulled to deep square leg for one"
"just wide of deep midwicket. Flight on leg, Hafeez gets underneath the length and nails his slog sweep. The fielder runs to his left, and just can't quite get there. Lands inside the boundary"
"well bowled, slides this one through around off, pushed back"
"shortish and wide outside off, 80 kph, sliced to backward point"
"<strong>big appeal, no</strong>, says the umpire. That was close. Quick down leg, sliding down, Hafeez misses a sweep, may have been drifting down leg"
"54 mph, shortish and wide outside off, chopped to backward point. Saw Hafeez coming and shortened the length, well bowled"
"good comeback from Prasanna. Short on off, pushed to cover. Good legspin"
"drifts down leg, worked to deep square leg for one"
"126 kph, a short slow delivery outside off, Hafeez misses a pull. Had to drag that pull from well outside"
"lovely shot from Hafeez. Short on middle and leg, Hafeez may have not seen it but he absolutely creams the pull through backward square leg. Maybe he should not see the ball more often."
"<strong>dropped</strong>! That's a sitter at this level. On the pads, Hafeez flicks it uppishly towards deep square leg who had to run a few metres to his left, got there with time to spare, sized up the catch and just like this limited-overs leg, lets the chance go. Spills out"
"deeee-leec-table from Malik. Full outside off, he just leans forward, transfers weight into the shot and caresses the shot past cover and mid-off for a couple"
"digs it in short around middle and leg, pulled down to fine leg for one"
"a low full toss around off, jammed out, towards midwicket"
"a high full toss outside off, dabbed down to third man for one"
"full around off, 130 kph, skewed towards midwicket"
"a very high full toss again down leg, helped along down to fine leg for one"
"good short ball around off, Malik sways away to avoid the ball"
"another short ball on leg, Malik gets inside the line and helps the ball into the gap at deep backward square leg for a couple"
"goes right through cover. Full delivery outside off, driven to cover, and the ball goes right through, much like this limited-overs series for SL."
"a full delivery outside off, Hafeez gets forward and defends a ball to the sweeper cover to end the game, the last shot an indicator of the ease with which Pakistan have strolled to this win."
