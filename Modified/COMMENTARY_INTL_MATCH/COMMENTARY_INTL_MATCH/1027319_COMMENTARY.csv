"tight line, solid defence, pushed back down the pitch"
"tighter line, tapped to mid-on"
"that's a good line, tight to off stump and carrying through to the keeper with some extra bounce. No stroke"
"outside off, bashed firmly to backward point, a loose wafty cut, but timed pretty well"
"thumped high, hard and straight through long-off. Beautiful pointy elbows, so sharp you could cut yourself on them"
"pushed firmly through wide mid-on, a very deliberate directional shot. Roy starting to dictate terms towards the end of that over"
a hint of outswing from a good full length. No stroke offered
"banged in short, and pulled slightly awkwardly through backward square leg. Got enough bat on it to keep control of the stroke though. Good pace, evidently!"
"onto the front foot, and drilled firmly into the covers"
"clipped off the front foot, out to midwicket"
"nudged into the leg side, just back of a length this time"
"rifled into the covers with a slightly tentative drive, more exploratory than authoritative.  But he found enough of the middle to beat the field"
"short, pulled, and so nearly carries to Jason Mohammed at short midwicket. He had to dive forward and to his right, but couldn't quite scoop the offering"
"in the air once again, Roy suckered by the extra bounce as he sought to clip on the up through midwicket. Flies into the gap, luckily for him"
"on the back foot, defended more calmly this time"
"onto the back foot, swished through the leg side. That was too short at Holder's pace, and sumptuously wafted away to the boundary"
pushed back down the pitch from a full length
stout defence from deep in the crease
"good line and length, probing away on off stump and demanding a respectful back-foot block"
short and hoisted over the leg side once again. I think pitching it up is going to be the key on this surface
"on the front foot, pongoed into the leg side with a distinct lack of ceremony"
"fuller, leg-sided but a hint of encouraging swing. Hales lifts his toes out of harm's way as the bat comes through to clip a single to fine leg"
"swung into the leg side again. Not quite as short as the others, but eased behind square"
"outside off, poked down to third man"
"on the toes, tucked out to the leg side"
stabbed behind square on the off side
"body behind the line, defending into the off side"
"on the toes, worked behind square"
calmly placed into the covers
patted back down the pitch. England sitting pretty so far
"that's well bowled, very tight to the stumps and eliciting a jabbed-batted defence on the back foot"
defended once more
"back of a length, and hauled into the leg side. No great timing, but placed well enough"
a pleasing echo of bat on ball as Roy defends with solid intent
"spanked straight to mid-off! Roy looked as though he was just getting the measure of this wicket, but he's picked the wrong ball to attack, and Joseph has the first breakthrough, courtesy of a lobbed chance into Holder's midriff"
"angled defence out to point, and Root is off the mark after a momentary hesitation"
"a probing full length, clipped slightly uppishly into the leg side"
"left alone outside off, more encouraging carry through to the keeper"
"nibble off the deck, and clatters into the back pad. No danger of lbw, given the lively bounce, but plenty to ponder"
"huge appeal as Root is again rapped on the pad, but that nipped back too far and Holder rightly declines the review"
defended back down the pitch
"full length, pushed back down the track"
"that one keeps improbably low, and Root is beaten outside off, lucky not to lose his off pole in the process"
"flicked in the air and <B>dropped!</B> That's a bad miss, I'm afraid. Chipped in the air, never in control of the shot, but Lewis at square leg made the ground diving forward, but couldn't cling on"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
"blotted into the leg side, a touch fuller this time"
"tight line and length, defended"
"driven on the front foot, down to long off"
"very full once again, and more good lift off the deck to strike Root amidships. Count em, don't rub em"
punched into the covers
patted into the covers and that's a good sharp single
good lift off the deck once more and Root is still not entirely settled in his trigger movements. Flinched into the leg side
"riding the bounce on off stump, and pushed to cover"
into line to defend. This is a good spell from Holder
fractionally leg-sided and worked out to midwicket
angled into the off side
"punched on the up, into the covers"
"galloping down the track and that's an unmitigated hack into the leg side. No timing or finesse. A bit of frustration, maybe?"
"that's more like the Root we know! Confidently onto the front foot, and drilled handsomely through the covers. Helped on its way, admittedly, by some poor work from Powell, who didn't read the bounce and let it through his grasp"
"bouncer, too short"
"crunched hard into the covers again, and another misfield, albeit less costly this time"
"on the back foot, defended down into the pitch"
battered with lots of bottom hand into the covers
"now that's a bit spawny. A nothing sort of cross-batted whoosh, and a delicate under-edge sails through fine leg past the keeper"
"<B>dropped!</B> Another spill, this time from Nurse in the gully. Perfect line and length, demanded the edge, and though he made good ground to his right, he couldn't cling on!"
nudged into the leg side
"inside edged defence, through backward square leg"
"heave ho! Can't bowl there, too short, sliding down the leg side, and Hales just leant back and placed it through backward square with a lofted pull. Easy pickings"
"pounded down the ground with a lot of inside-edge on the drive. Up comes the fifty. Hard-earned, but effective enough so far"
"up on the toes, and jabbed to cover"
""
"outside off, placed into the covers with a gentle cut"
"outside off, and Hales has a go, a (more or less) deliberate top-edge down to third man. One bounce and fielded"
punched on the up into the covers. Good line and length to launch his spell
zips through quicker and beats a loose cut
"bashed hard out through deep cover. Too short, too wide, too slow. That was a freebie"
"cracked off the back foot, back to the bowler"
thumped into the covers
"better line and length, a threat of turn towards the cordon as Hales punches off the back foot"
"defended into the covers, that's a decent line to launch his spell"
"tight line, full length, met with a flowing straight blade"
"smashed across the line, a fraction shorter. Midwicket tidies up"
dabbed back down the pitch
"back of a length, clipped firmly and on the up through square leg"
"too short, but the field is well placed. Deep backward square tidies up another measured pull"
"down on one knee, meeting the ball on the full with a dabbed sweep behind square"
pushed firmly into the covers
"a bit loose and wafty, a crease-bound drive, but the ball tweaks past the edge"
"swept, with huge power. Picked the length and leathered the bat across the line, all along the ground"
drilled on the up out to cover
"thumped hard into the covers, dragged back right on the edge of the rope, and there's a man down ... Evin Lewis tumbled over the boundary's edge, his spikes sliding on the concrete and he's gone down hard. This is a bit nasty"
"too short, too leg-sided, another freebie for England as Hales helps it round the corner through fine leg"
"on the back foot, tip and run into the covers"
short and pulled awkwardly into the leg side
"on the pads, clipped uppishly to midwicket"
clipped to the leg side
"pushed hard into the covers, off the back foot"
frees the arms with an emphatic drive into the covers
"a yawning pull out to deep midwicket, where Powell shows off some nifty footwork to keep the ball in play"
tapped out to deep midwicket once more.
"wide line on the back foot, bashed into the covers"
"well bowled, a touch of spin from wide on the crease. Hales thinks about being drawn into a stroke  but let's it go"
"outside off, cut uppishly to point, and that will be <B>drinks</B>"
"on the stumps, worked down into the leg side"
tight line from Brathwaite and Root presses out to steer into the covers
"slower ball, Root shows it a straight bat, blocked to extra cover"
"length, stays a touch low, Root swivels and gets his pull away down to fine leg for one"
"good length on fourth stump, stabbed towards point - 'Waaaaaaait!' bellows Hales"
"touch short, this one slides down the leg side"
"that's a better line and length, only 124kph/76mph and Hales gets a thick edge down to third man"
floated up on the stumps and Hales nurdles into a gap at square leg - they think twice about trying for two
pushed through a bit quicker and Root blocks on off stump
"flighted, on the stumps, worked into the leg side"
"fetch that! Hales has put this on to the roof of the stand at deep midwicket! The sound that made... Cleared the front leg, got down and slugged the life out of it, high and pulchritudinous and with the wind. Ends up in a gutter and they'll have to replace the ball"
"flatter on the stumps, Hales goes back in the crease and defends"
"flighted, Hales swats through midwicket again, in front of the man in the deep and they come back for two"
"length on off stump, Root defends watchfully"
"touch short, the ball sits up and is worked away through backward square leg for one"
"half-tracker from Brathwaite, taking the pace off, Hales waits and nudges through square leg"
"hits the deck hard this time, back of a length on fourth-fifth stump, dabbed to gully"
"short and over the stumps, defended down int the leg side"
"short of a length and worked to midwicket, the fielder is quickly in and they won't get a run"
"tossed up and <i>smashed</i> down the ground this time, six more over long-off! Brute power from Hales as he crunches his second maximum"
"lobbed up wide of the stumps and Hales bullies a drive through extra cover, that will run away, too, to bring up an impressive fifty on his return to the side; takes England past 100, too"
"dragged down, short and wide and this time Hales cuts, plenty of power in this and it again trundles through the untended acres at deep cover for four"
Hales steps across... Bishoo goes wider... bit of spin and that's off the cut strip. Oh dear
floated up and punched down the ground coming forwards
"pushed through outside off, Root steers a back-foot drive wide of the sweeper for a couple"
"gives this some air, slow and loopy outside off, slog-sweeps but fails to connect"
"over the wicket, pushed through outside off, tapped behind square"
floated up and Hales tries to work across the line unsuccessfully
"flat outside off, skidding past the outside edge as Hales prods uncertainly"
"tossed up and Hales uses the feet, gets to the pitch but pushes straight to extra cover"
"full on the stumps, nudged back down the track"
flatter and a touch straight and Hales works a single off his pads to deny Nurse a maiden
"short ball, Hales goes to pull and it zips under the bat - hit on the box? Certainly groin area... But Hales is okay"
back of a length outside off and again Hales fails to connect with a cross-batted swope
"banged in short, mistimed into the on side, dribbles off the cut strip"
Hales goes back and across and works the ball off his hip

"dragged down, only a fraction short but Root is back and on it like lightning, pulling fiercely in front of the sweeper and this gets four"
"full on the stumps, Hales flips it aerially over square leg, they trot one - and then meet back in the middle to shake hands on the hundred stand. Bang tidy"
"length in the channel, drops back and stabs one through point"
"short from Brathwaite, pulled firmly but straight to backward square leg"
"on the stumps, maybe a slower ball, Hales smites a mighty blow... but it's almost all vertical, somehow landing safely out towards midwicket as three different fielders triangulate on the ball! They manage to run two, to rub in the insult"
Hales moves across and flicks one more safely off his legs
"short outside off, Root drops back and angles the bat on a dab to third man"
"floated up wide of the stumps and Root batters a drive, picks out extra cover"

goes back and worked off the the pads

"flat and quicker from Nurse, pushed to past the bowler"
mistimed back down the pitch
"moves across his stumps and looked to be attempting a reverse-paddle, then changed his mind and dabbed through short third man anyway"
makes room and stabs the ball through backward point
can't get this one away into the leg side
short and clipped off the hip for one
short and a touch too straight and Hales swings it meatily away through backward square leg to move ever closer to a hundred on his comeback

"shortish, another cutter from Carter, Hales stays back and jabs through the leg side"
"full outside off, taking pace off, Root drives with an open face and gets a couple out towards deep backward point, a decent diving effort reels the ball in before the rope"
pitched up and Root guides this straight to backward point
Brathwaite floats the ball up and Hales tucks to the leg side
"pushed through, hits the front pad... and up goes the finger! Is Hales going to miss out on a hundred? He <b>reviews</b> straight away, perhaps believing he got some bat on it trying to sweep... Doesn't look like he hit it, though, so he's in the lap of Hawk-Eye... which says the ball wasn't straightening enough, would have missed off stump! So the <b>decision is overturned</b> and Brathwaite is denied a second ODI wicket"
"tossed up and Hales again goes for the aggressive sweep... scuttles through the legs of Hope, was there an edge on that? Given as a bye"
on the stumps Root works into the leg side
"flat outside off, Hales chops through point"
pushed through quickly on the stumps and Root can't get this one away
"short of as length outside off, Hales guides it through backward point"
"short and wide and cracked over gully, struck powerfully off the back foot and that will race away"
"tighter to the stumps, Root shows fast hands as he cuts from deep in the crease, just one this time"
"dug in short, Hales takes it on, big top edge... and it sails all the way over fine leg! Big release of emotion from Hales when he realised where it was going, punches the air, takes off the helmet to drink in the applause. If there was any doubt about who should be Jason Roy's opening partner, it's been dispelled. Fifth ODI ton for Hales, and fifth in the last 17-18 months"
"length ball, maybe a cutter from Joseph, Hales steps away and swings like billy-oh, fails to connect"
"on the stumps, swatted back down the ground for one"
"onto the front foot, driven into the covers"
half a stride down the pitch and launched over the legside infield
"reverse sweep, and that's brilliantly timed. All finesse, no power. And placement to the fore"
"another reverse, but the fielder is able to intercept this one"
"blam! Steps right across the stumps, climbs into a long-levered slog-pull, and that is flat-batted hard and fast over midwicket, embedding in the concourse"
clipped into the leg side. England are heading for a monster here...
a wild whoosh over the covers. No contact this time
outside off at a very sharp pace. But that's too wide for the umpire's liking
"slogged high in the air, takes a toe-end, and plops calmly into the hands of fine leg. That's the end of that. A well-deserved ovation for a fine comeback hundred"
"outside off, and dabbed out to point. But an overstep... so, a <strong>free hit</strong> for the new man"
"spang! That is Buttler at his best! Nothing to lose, so he wins everything. Oodles of wrists and bottom hand, drilling through the line of a decent yorker-length delivery, and right up and over the covers"
"width, and carved through point"
"short and leg-sided, helped round the corner with a languid pull, and it takes a fine save on the boundary's edge to intercept"
"well bowled, wider on the crease, tight to off stump, solidly defended"
"on the off stump, stabbed into the covers"
"short outside off stump, but Root can't get hold of his cut, and grunts his annoyance as the ball dribbles out to cover"
"a flinch at the crease, and a feint to leg, before springing across the crease to attempt the ramp. Couldn't connect this time, though..."
"smashes the stumps! Full and straight, Buttler attempted the ramp once more, but got no bat in the way, and was too far across his crease to preserve his timbers"
"bouncer to welcome the skipper, and he didn't see that coming from round the wicket. Takes his eye off the ball and is pinged on the shoulder"
"another good, straight, aggressive bouncer. Morgan flinches one off the glove and is grateful to take the single"
"round the wicket, defended into the covers"
"on the back foot, looking for the single but can't get through"
"onto the front foot this time, and driven firmly into the covers"
"tapped out to square leg, another short one"
"delicately played, soft hands to run the single through third man"
"banged in short once more, but that just balloons out of the batsman's reach"
"outside off, and no stroke offered"
"full and straight, tapped to cover. Good intent in this spell from Holder, who is not a quick bowler, but he has height and awkward bounce in abundance"
nudged off the hip out to backward square leg
forward and defended into the covers
"a good sharp delivery, beats a loose swish outside off"
"on the back foot, pushed to cover"
"mown through midwicket, a bit of a dirty swipe across the line. Once again, he loses his shape when he tries to murder the ball. Still, small gripes at 95 not out from 102 balls with the final ten overs to come ..."
"short ball, Root tries to play a late cut/dab and is beaten past the edge"
"back of a length, comes back in a little as Root flicks across the line, hits the thigh pad and runs wide of the keeper"
"dug in short, Morgan flaps at a pull, could be in trouble here... but it goes all the way, clearing deep square leg! Bishoo started to run in, thinking he was in business for a catch, only for the wind to pick up and take it into England fans sitting in plastic chairs beyond the boards"
"round the wicket, worked across the line"
"length outside off, cutting his fingers over it, Morgan bottom-edges a cut"
short ball and this is swatted into the leg side for a single
"bowled 'im! Morgan plays back, attempts to force down the ground, slight misjudgment of the line and it clips the inside edge before shuddering leg stump"
"tossed up on the stumps, Stokes twocks it down the ground to long-on - that's the England 250"
"slightly short and leg side, Root was down early to try and sweep, gets something on it and the ball runs fine for one... He's on to 97 now"
floated up and defended on the front foot
"skips down, not to the pitch, thrashes through the shot nevertheless - and he's belted this miles, halfway up the building beyond the boundary, a violent chasing for a six from his third ball!"
tossed up on the stumps and worked into a gap on the leg side
fullish and worked off the pads to midwicket for one more
"full, an offcutter from Joseph, Root sits on it and nudges square on the leg side, they scurry back for two, takes him on to 99..."
"short ball, Root swivels and swats it through square, again there's two - and there follows the bat raise, plenty of Brits on tour in Barbados to applaud Root's ninth ODI hundred. A whirring dynamo of a knock, but can he kick on?"
"no, he falls next ball! Joseph delivers it cross-seam on off stump, bottom-handed scoop from Root... but it's down the throat of long-on! Looked a tired shot, trying to whip across the line and got a big leading edge, Brathwaite steadies himself and makes no mistake"
"over the wicket, back of a length, fended through backward square leg for one"
"another for Joseph, pouches the caught-and-bowled! Tame dismissal, trying to flick into the leg side, just presented a catch back to the bowler, who now has a four-wicket haul!"
"tossed up on middle and leg, worked into a gap for a couple"
"flat on off stump, tapped away"
"full, Stokes heaves across the line, again picks up a couple more"
"full and flighted, swatted through midwicket on the sweep"
darted flat on off stump and Woakes taps it away defensively
"full on the stumps, punched along the carpet towards mid-on, they steal a single"
"pitched up on off, Woakes pokes into a gap in the covers"
"full and wide of the stumps, Stokes has to reach for it but still manages to blap the ball flat over cover for four"
"short ball, Stokes deals with it awkwardly, ends up falling over as he swivels and gets a top-edge... but it flies over short third man and will also bounce away!"
"makes room, thrashed flat through the leg side, wide of long-on, who puts in the dive but won't get there - three in a row for Stokes!"
"cross-seam from Joseph, outside leg as Stokes swings across the line and is hit on the pad... and Hope signals for the <b>review</b>. Think this is ambitious and, yes, replays confirm it did not pitch in line with the stumps, so Stokes will continue with the batsmen having run a leg bye"
pitched up and slugged flat towards mid-on for one more
"Nurse tosses the ball up outside off, pushed into the covers"
"flat and slightly leg side as Woakes swings and misses, hits the pads and deflects for a leg bye"
"round the wicket, flat outside off, a mighty heave from Stokes - almost swings himself off his feet - but fails to connect"
"tossed up and Stokes collars this, flayed over extra cover, that'll skip away"
"quicker, sliding through past the inside edge as Stokes sweeps, <i>just</i> misses leg stump and it runs away off Hope's pads, I think"
floated up and pushed through the covers coming forwards
"nicely bowled by Brathwaite, a legcutter that Woakes doesn't pick and fails to hit"
"pitched up and it's in the slot to drive, Woakes clears the front leg and cracks it over cover for his first boundary"
"short ball, taking the pace off again, it loops up over Woakes' attempted pull - called wide on height"
"length ball, backs away and swats down the ground"
"pitched up in the channel, Woakes gets across and drives one through the covers for the England 300"
"sprayed across the left-hander from over the wicket, Stokes can only reach it with the cue end, gets one to deep point"
"slower ball, sliding towards leg stump, Woakes scoops it over the leg side for one more"
"fullish outside off, Woakes slogs in the air but it bounces short of long-on"
"angled across Stokes, who squeezes another single out off the bottom half of the bat"
"short ball, Woakes pulls from wide of off stump, loops h-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-g-h out towards deep midwicket - where it is superbly taken diving forwards! Not in control of that, Bishoo doing very well to hold on"
"full outside off, Stokes sends up a steepler... taken! Two in two balls for Holder, came off the toe of the bat again, Stokes heaving for the hills, went high but not very far and it's another decent catch at backward point"
"over the wicket, good length and Plunkett shows it a diligent straight bat"
touch short and helped away through backward square leg for one
"woof, how has that missed the stumps! A cutter from Brathwaite, maybe disturbed the surface, Plunkett was late on it but it bounced over the wicket"
"length ball, Plunkett shovels across the line and picks up one"
"full outside off, a bottom-handed larrup over cover brings Rashid two"
"pitched up and Rashid again punches firmly, through mid-off for one this time"
"on the stumps, bunted back down the ground"
"slower ball, Rashid picks it, gives it the big heave ho... and he has absolutely <i>moosed</i> this over deep midwicket for six! Sweet connection to put the cap on Brathwaite's wicketless ten overs"
Holder hits back of a length and beats the bat as Plunkett swings off the back foot
"short ball, swung into the leg side, is there two in this? No, Plunkett sends Rashid back and he is well short as Hope breaks the stumps!"
sprayed down the leg side for an extra
"banged in short, Finn can't reach it on the pull, that'll be another wide"
"leg side, Finn swishes and it comes off the pads through to Hope, whose throw to the non-striker's end is a tired one"
"pitched up and Plunkett nails a slog down the ground for six! A blacksmith biff from Plunkett, down on one knee and he sends it over the ropes for the 10th time today"
on the stumps and clumped into the leg side for a single
"pitched full on off, Finn bashes it through the leg side, there's not two on so he grounds his bat and waits at the non-striker's end... while Plunkett comes ambling halfway up the pitch and is run out by miles to draw a final line under proceedings"
down the leg side. The ideal line to the right hander... good carry at least
tapped to mid-on
"on the pads, a top-edge over the leg-side, and that flies all the way! Well, there is clearly oodles of bounce for Finn to exploit, if he can tighten his line.."
"as soft as they come! A lollipop of a catch to square leg, just a fence off the toes, half defensive, half attacking, and emphatically out"
zippy! Wide of off stump and exploding off the deck. Buttler hauls it back in with one glove high above his head
full and straight. <strike>The end of a successful over</strike> oh no it's not
"good pace once again, through to the keeper"
"Lewis, with his hurty arm, hasn't had much time for a sit-down"
flung well wide of off stump
squared up on a back-of-a-length line
"a pretty woeful attempted pull, beaten for pace and, especially, bounce, and the second lollipop catch of the innings. That came off the splice with no pace at all, as if he'd swapped his bat for a welly, and Woakes just strolled up in his followthrough. This is getting a bit grim for Windies"
more good bounce from a strong wrist
through to the keeper
"back of a length, attempted cut down to the third man, but too cramped to get the ball away"
"an emphatic appeal for lbw as Brathwaite topples across his crease to an undeniably adjacent delivery. No review, and rightly so, that was sliding down"
"clipped to midwicket, Stokes swoops to intercept"
"outside off, and climbing through to the keeper"
this one zips back sharply and just grazes past the pad. Beaten for pace
"cut, loosely, in the air, and inches short of a tumbling Adil Rashid at third man!"
angled into the off side
chopped out to point
nudged into the leg side
belted into the off side with a front-foot wallop. Moeen Ali intercepts well with a dive at mid-off
"pop a doodle doo! Yet another lollipop catch, clipped from back of a length to midwicket, the pace and bounce drawing Brathwaite out of his comfort zone and leaving West Indies utterly rudderless in a futile chase"
"chopped in the air once more, down to third man.... and it's dropped short once again! Plunkett galloped in but was never close"
inside-edged defence onto the back pad. It's all going off out there
"sharp lift from back of a length. Raps the gloves, and that is an uncomfortable length. Six of those an over won't be gratefully received"
"lifting sharply again, and another top-edged pull flies safe! Over the keeper's head, and that's the safest area of the field"
full and threatening. Defended earnestly into the off side
"on the back foot once again, defended to the on side"
"strikes the pad, angling down the leg side"

crunched into the off side
"tucked off the toes, out to midwicket"

"riding the bounce outside off stump, and angled down to third man"
another over seen off
"on the back foot, clobbered to cover with a cross-batted swish"

"outside off, nibbling off the deck and beating the edge. That was wider on the crease and straightened appreciably"

"very full length, and pumped into the covers once more"
"rising from a good length, and jabbed to cover"

firm push to mid-off
"angled into the leg stump, defended"

"attempted cut, can't break through the cover ring"
"on the front foot, clunked to deep cover"
"slightly leg side, hits the thigh pad as Hope prods across the line"
"on the pads, chipped to square leg, another limp dismissal and Windies are cosying up to ignominy. Second for Plunkett and Hope's semi-competitive stay is over"
"nips back, takes the inside edge - two in two for Plunkett! He's on a hat-trick! A nasty ball to get first up, rearing off a length and it came back in to flick the shoulder of the bat, an excellent diving catch from Buttler completed Holder's dismissal"
"pitched up outside off, he leans on it and gently defuses the bomb"
"straighter line, shuffles across and works to leg"

on the stumps and defended to complete another maiden for Plunkett
"goes on with the arm, into the front pad - and given lbw! Carter <b>reviews</b>, was there some inside edge? Could also be a question of line, too... but what will the technology tell us? Not Hot Spot or Snicko here, of course, but the cameras seem to have picked up a deviation as the ball passed the bat, yes, looks like an edge on to the pad and Ruchira Palliyaguruge's <b>decision will be overturned</b>"

"angled in with the arm from round the wicket, short of a good length and worked into the leg side"

"dug in short, Carter rocks on to the back foot and short-arm jabs a couple more to deep midwicket"
"this shoots on to rap the pads, surely that's plumb...? Not given by Gregory Brathwaite but England <b>review</b> and it's a quick one for the TV ump, bang in front of off stump and hitting middle halfway up, so the <b>decision is overturned</b> and Carlos Brathwaite is eventually sent on his way by his namesake. Small revenge for the World T20 final but Stokes has got his man first ball"
