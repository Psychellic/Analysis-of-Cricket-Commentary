"banged in short on middle, aimed at the body, 6kph slower than the previous ball. Dhawan keeps his eyes on the ball and fends it off in the direction of point"

floats it up there outside off and Dhawan smears it down to long-off
"<b>dropped? Nope, Pierre's claiming the catch</b> but the umpires will want to check on it. Good bowling sets up this play, the length just short of where Rohit can drive, but he goes for it anyway, and ends up almost being caught and bowled. Replays show it's bounced before reaching Pierre"
""
leaps back and cuts to the sweeper
"<strong>Keemo Paul drops a fairly straightforward catch at the midwicket boundary</strong>. To add to it, he parries it away to the boundary. Dug in short on off, does not bounce as much as Dhawan expected it to. Dhawan splices a pull and gets away"

"'caaaatch,' is the cry, but it's a wistful one as West Indies realise Rohit has placed this flick perfectly - to the right of straight midwicket, and well to the right of long-on. Insane batting"
"loops it up outside off, Rohit has to reach out, almost losing his shape, but he still manages to keep it down as he drives through cover"
"looks for the slog, but the quicker ball from Allen beats him outside off"
turns it to midwicket
"goes for the dinky little reverse sweep, guiding the full and quick delivery at the base of off stump to third man. Premeditated, but well executed"
slower through the air and that helps Allen escape with a dot. Dhawan loads up the big slog sweep but mistimes it completely as the ball goes to short fine leg
taps the slower delivery in between long-on and midwicket and sprints through for a couple of runs. Gorgeous work. <B>And it also brings up fifty for Rohit</b>
picks the gap between point and short third man! That's all he needs to do. That's all he cares to do. Sees a short delivery - it's not even that wide - but he waits on it and carves it into no-man's land
"offcutter slower ball becomes a full toss and Rohit caresses it to long-off. Lucknow roars with its captain, screaming 'Indiaaaaaa, Indiaaaaaa'"
"swings the slower ball, quite full and outside off, out to long-on"
"<b>mis-hit</b> as Rohit goes slogging - he rarely does that but here, the slower ball deceives him, and instead of hitting over long-on, he looks midwicket and gets a leading edge to third man"
"smears a full-paced, short and wide delivery out to the sweeper cover"
"clears the boundary again! Rohit is putting on a masterclass in six-hitting. Even these 80m boundaries aren't stopping him. Picks up the length ball, goes down on one knee and slog sweeps it to smithereens"
"and there she goes! Soooo high. Soooo long. Even a ball meant to cramp him on leg stump is put away as he clears the front leg and swings that big bat. The fielder at midwicket joins the 50,000 in the ground as a spectator"
"<b>dropped</b> - and that's only technically cause Rohit thundered down the pitch and hammered it back at the bowler, meant to clear him, but it is brave of Allen to reach his hands up and try and take it. Never stands a chance though"
"spots the left-hander running down and pulls his length back, ensuring he can only nudge it to midwicket"
advances again and pulls the short of a length delivery to deep midwicket
"sets up for the reverse pull, Allen spots it and pushes the ball through wide of off stump - and gets penalised. Ugh. Can't survive as a bowler in this sport"
"<b>good catch by Pooran</b>. He's at the long leg boundary. He needs to run to his left. He needs to dive and he does everything just about perfectly to take the catch with both hands. Dhawan goes, his slog sweep not quite working for once"
slices it away over point! It's all so easy for Rohit. He knows Thomas will give him all the pace he needs so he just offered the bat as a ramp outside the off stump.
"fullish on off stump, Rohit dabs to point and gets across to the other end. <b>Direct hit at the bowler's end would have fetched a wicket</b>."
"a slower ball, on a length and outside off, which Pant drives on the up to mid-off. Seems a bit too early into the shot"
<b>almost plays on</b> as Thomas hits the deck with a 134 kph delivery and Pant is a little late bringing his bat down
"bouncer at 139 kph, Pant ducks underneath it"
punches the back of a length delivery on off stump through to the sweeper
"whips it past the left of short midwicket - and having done that, with some power too, he realises he's got enough to beat the man in the deep too."
"<b>caught on the midwicket boundary</b>. It's full on middle. It's not always easy getting under those, but Pant tries, so hard that he loses his balance playing the slog sweep. So in addition to losing his wicket, he also looks a little goofy"
steps out to knock the fuller delivery on leg stump to long-on
"shortish and outside off, Rohit chops it to point"
they're trying to keep the ball wide of Rohit's reach - the swing that takes the ball to long-on and midwicket - and it seems to be working. India's captain has to settle for dabs to point
"slings it in towards off stump and Rahul, trying to late cut it, realises he's in a bit of trouble. Cramped and in danger of being bowled, he just about slice it to third man"
the on-the-up drive against a good length ball on off stump to long-on
lovely balance as Rohit lets the full delivery come to him and flicks it through straight midwicket
"smacks it over extra cover! The key to this is his waiting on the ball - it's slower, and it's shorter, and those are hard to put away on a slowish pitch. But he holds his shape and them hits it with a straight bat"
"that's even better! Even though the back of a length ball is right over middle and off stump, his quick footwork puts him outside leg stump and then it's all in the wrists as he cuts to the point boundary"
"<b>leading edge, onto the helmet, and he's almost caught at square leg</b>! A full toss on middle - no pace on it - deceives Rahul as he goes for a paddle sweep and almost leads to his downfall too"
"full on off stump, pushes to long-off"
no pace on the ball and it's also wide outside off. Rohit - camped on leg stump - can't reach far enough and mistimes the shot to point
"oh boy, he's nowhere near the ball and yet it sails over the boundary! West Indies have been trying to hide the ball outside off. Rohit insists on batting at leg stump. He comes down the track this time, reaches out and lofts it over the bowlers head"
full toss - a very very wide full toss - and Rohit clatters it to the third man boundary - <b>with only one hand</b>! He's into the nineties!
"full on off stump, taps it through the covers"
the plan goes a tiny bit wrong as Pierre bowls the dart too wide outside off
lets go another rapid delivery that's way wide outside off
shifts across outside off and finds himself in perfect position to launch the quick and flat delivery to the straight boundary
"reverse pull - it's nowhere near timed, might even have come off the glove, but it lobs the keeper and they get two for it"
"near yorker, which Rohit flicks to deep midwicket. He wants a second, but Rahul says no, rightly as well because Allen is so quick across the turf out there"
"picks the slower ball so well, holds his shape until it arrives at the base of middle stump, then hammers it past the right of cover. Splendid batting under pressure to make a big total"
"looks for the reverse flick, but he doesn't make contact with the length ball outside off. A little touch would have got that ball to the boundary with both third man and fine leg up"
"<b>dropped</b> and it's Pollard at long-on! One of the safest fielders all through the IPL - especially in these kinds of situations, running forward off the boundary, diving as well, he gets both hands to it, but the ball is dipping on him and he isn't able to hold on. Rahul's big biff down the ground comes off the toe end"
"not enough room, and he doesn't make enough himself to cut the quicker ball on middle through point"
leaps way across his stumps to deal with a back of a length ball very wide outside off and carves it to the sweeper
drills the near yorker out to long-on
"outside edge races away to the third man boundary! Well, that wide full toss definitely needed to be put away, but even if Rohit had timed his cut, he may not have beaten the sweeper. A little luck for the India captain"
"scoops it to the long leg boundary! <b>Fourth T20I hundred, the most by any batsman</b>! He punches the air. He looks so angry. He looks seething. He wanted this. He's loving this. And he gets there in the most un-Rohit like way, accessing the V behind him"
"comes down the track to hit the ball to long-off but it's cut off by Brathwaite. The batsman is outside his crease, he's not making any effort to get back, he's too tired to do so, but the throw at the stumps is wide and goes to the boundary as well"
over pitched outside off and Rohit smacks him over long-off. So clearly he's not too tired
"yorker on off stump, pushes it to long-off and that ends a 20-run over."
misses the back of a length delivery outside off as he goes to pull
"back of a length, outside off, lets it go"
"looks to force the ball through the covers, but it doesn't quite come onto the bat as he likes"
"that is <b>epic</b>! He steps forward and introduces a straight bat to the length ball, launching it over the bowler's head. Claaaaassy from Hope"
"looks to tickle the ball down the leg side, but misses it, Bhuvi though thinks there's a nick through to the keeper, appealing insistently. But Karthik says he doesn't hear anything and so India do not review. <b>UltraEdge says the ball only clipped the trousers</b>"
"<b>nearly plays on</b> as he is unsettled by the bounce Bhuvi gets, just outside off. The lack of room may also have messed with his attempt to punch through the covers"
"back of a length and outside off, steers it to deep third man"
squares him up with a shortish delivery angled across the right-hander. Hope manages to nudge it to point
"<b>bowled im</b>! Ugly batting from a player who should have trusted his natural game. He's so much better playing with a straight bat, instead he goes for a slog. He's done in by the lack of pace off the pitch. He's through the shot well before the ball arrives and clips the off bail. The umps check on Khaleel's front foot. Looks all okay."

"just short of a good length and outside off, leans back and deftly cuts it away fine of short third man. Finesse"
"Hetmyer holes out to long-on and slumps to his knees. Back of a length on middle, Hetmyer looks to follow finesse with muscle. He can't clear the long boundary, though. Lifts it to Dhawan at long-on. He celebrates it with his signature thigh-five"

"Rohit's evening gets better. <strong>He takes a screamer at slip.</strong> He stretches both his hands to his right and takes this fast-travelling ball. Short one that spins away outside off, Bravo throws his bat at the ball. Cuts hard and Rohit tracks down this thick outside edge"
"looped up outside off, wrong'un, breaks back in and beats the swing"
"pushed through on middle, Pooran brings out the paddle sweep and guides it away fine on the leg side"

"<b>direct hit</b> and he should be gone! Allen puiches the back of a length delivery to the left of short cover and thinks there's a single. But Krunal rushes to his left, grabs the ball, takes aim and hits the target. West Indies absolutely crumbling."
