"full delivery, angling away, the first delivery that is not on the stumps or straighter. Left alone by Guptill"
"what a start to the day. After all those drop catches in the crowd over the last few days, a spectator turns up, sticks his hands out and takes a <strong>one-hander in the crowd</strong> with that brown T-shirt. A share of, or the whole, 50,000 dollars for that man. On the pads from Amir, and Guptill just flicks him over square leg. Just an extension. Applause from Guptill too"
"good length on middle and leg, defended back."
"good length around off, 132 kph, defended into the cover region"

"in the gap. Good length outside off, punched through cover for a couple. Just a push. Malik fumbles, but no extras"
"uh oh. Exuberance. This has been some start to the day. A full delivery outside off, Munro walks across, looking to swivel into a flick over square leg, but there is some extra bounce. Takes the leading edge and lobs to Sarfraz. A bit of a slog sweep there."

"<strong>a big appeal</strong>, no says the umpire. That's a lovely length, good from wide of the crease. 136 kph, comes back in, hits Guptill on the thigh and then to the keeper. Just front pad. No bat."
"too short again from Ashraf. Back of a length again, Guptill rocks back and caresses a back-foot punch through cover for a couple"
still too short but gets away wit this because the line is closer to off. Guptill stands tall and blocks. He has to be fuller with the new ball.

"into the gap for a couple. Was overpitched by Amir, goes wide and gives Williamson a half-volley. Pushed nicely into the gap at cover"

"good stop from the cover fielder. Full and wide outside off, caressed towards cover. The fielder dives to his left to stop the ball from going through"
"just poor bowling. Goes full and very wide, allows Guptill to throw his hands at that, scythed through point. Ashraf has struggled today, should be his last over of the spell"

"much better bowling. Good length on a fifth-stump channel, pushed to cover from the crease"
"a forward charge from Guptill, looking to come down and muscle a ball through cover, but the ball may have moved back enough to take the inside half. Hit back to the bowler."
"132 kph, nice looking stroke. Good length, a tad wide, punched towards point. His line and length is subtly much better"

"a maiden from Ashraf. Back of a length around off, pushed away towards mid-off"
"late on a pull, and struck on the box. Good length on middle and leg, Williamson may have felt that was a touch short. He can't connect with a pull, wears the blow"

"very tight, 130 kph, around off, worked away towards square leg. Williamson looking a bit agitated with his strike rate"
"shuffles right across, exposes his stumps, full around off, another block back. Terrific bowling"
"129 kph, looks for a pull over the infield, but the length isn't short enough so he improvises a dab back. An excellent first five balls from Raees. Can he finish well?"
"130 kph, onto the pull quickly this time. Good length on middle and leg, pulled away through square leg. Fine leg gets around"

Williamson wants the second but Guptill isn't sure. Williamson continues on his way and Guptill responds. But it's so late that they're almost at the same end. The throw comes on to Sarfraz's end who then underarms it to the bowler who gathers it and takes out the stumps even as Guptill puts in a full-length dive"

"110 kph, out with a direct hit. He had sooooo much time, a slower delivery on off, tapped to Sahdab at backward point, who takes aim and misses at the batsman's end with Boult not in the frame."

"full down leg, 136 kph, Boult clears his front leg and looks to give the ball a massive thwack, but fails to make contact"
"SMASHED! The crowd goes wild. Full delivery outside off, Boult clears his front leg and slaps the ball over mid-off"
"a short, slow ball outside off, patted towards cover. The throw to the bowler is fumbled and Boult comes back for two. Sarfraz isn't pleased"
"gasps of exasperation from the crowd. Full on off, Boult clears his front leg and shovels a flick with plenty of bottom hand, right in the gap at midwicket"
"looking for the yorker, full down leg, the perfect yorker. Boult clears his front leg, and jams the ball onto his foot. The ball then ricochets back onto the stumps. Three for Hasan."

"<b>dropped</b>. Santner has had his share of misfields and dropped catches this series. Oh, dear, this is catching practice. Driven uppishly straight into his hands. This really should have been taken with his eyes closed"
"length ball outside off, chops a defence into the turf"
Santner will breathe a sigh of relief. A ripping awayswinger from Boult. This is unplayable. Forcing Azhar to play at it by landing it around middle and off before it swings away from the back of a length to graze the outside edge on its way to first slip

pristine cover driven with a long stride forward but picks out the fielder in the region
and Boult strikes again. This one's not to a good delivery or anything though. Zaman indiscreetly slashes at a wide short delivery but it cuts in ever so slightly to find the inside edge and crash into the stumps
"short of good length on off, stays back and defends into the off side"
lovely bowling.Slants it across the right-hander and makes him shoulder arms. But the angle is very tight as the ball goes over the top of off
gets it to drift away a lot sharper this time and Hafeez shoulders arms again
this is good stuff. Boult dishing out some unplayable deliveries here and Pakistan are crumbling. Hafeez is drawn forward early by a good length delivery and is once again forced to play at it. The ball jags away very late and very subtly to take an edge to first slip who takes the catch to his left
"short of good length, <b>hits him high on the pad as he pushes at it from the backfoot</b>. But the ball pitched outside leg"

"back of a length, angled across, left alone close to off"
"good length on middle, taps it against the angle towards midwicket"

"fullish outside off, defended"

shows a little bit of intent for once and slashes at the sight of width but point dives to his left to make a brilliant stop
this one angles in from similar length around leg stump and he tucks it away to square leg
"back of a length on off, defended"
stays in the crease and gets an inside edge on this fuller ball that narrowly misses the stumps and goes to the left of the keeper. <b>One off that over!</b>
"now all of a sudden Pakistan decide to come alive and that has resulted in a run out. A short of a length delivery that is punched to sweeper cover. They magically realise the need to get a move on and take on the fielder in the deep for a second run. And it's suicidal. Santner has run to his left, gathered it and fired a flat powerful throw at the keeper's end. Babar grounds his bat, it gets stuck in the turf and he is empty-handed by the time the bails are whipped off"

"the tight lines are being defended. That means the only time they can open up is when there's width. Malik does that, is patience is tested which has clouded his judgement and he fends away awkwardly from the body. Nowhere near the line.

"Williamson takes a blinder and Pakistan are 32 for 8! What a catch. We've seen many one-handed stunners today, but you can't beat this. It's short on middle and leg, Hasan pulls towards midwicket. Williamson is beaten by the pace of the shot, or so it seems, until he sticks out his right hand and catches it even as it seems like the ball has passed him. How did he catch up with that? Amazing reflexes, he takes some absolute stunners in practice, this ain't practice."
