"full outside leg stump, and the attempted paddle doesn't come off his bat. <b>Dickwella appeals for caught behind</b> but the umpire isn't interested at all. Amla also gives out a smile"
full outside off but Amla takes a big stride forward and converts it into a full toss. Times a cover drive to perfection and beats the infielder at cover
"full on middle stump, and flicked away to square leg for a quick single"
"full on leg stump, and he comes down the wicket, before whipping off his toes to deep backward square leg"
"tossed up on off stump, and Amla works it to the fielder at cow corner to rotate the strike"
"<b>dropped by Lakmal!</b> Duminy goes for the reverse sweep from outside leg stump, and the ball went straight into cover's hands. But he fails to hold on to it."
"full on middle, and he pushes it with the angled bat to midwicket"
"Duminy goes to the leg side and therefore the bowler follows him. But Duminy gets inside the line of the ball again, and then collects the run for a wide"
"length ball on off but Duminy comes down the wicket to slog. He's in no position, and therefore adjusts his shot, eventually defending off the front foot"
"length ball on middle, and the attempted punch off the back foot takes a bottom edge to square leg for one"
"full on middle and leg, but Amla just takes a big stride forward to defend"
"full on middle, and Amla skips down the ground. Drives past the non-striker's right and collects a single at long off"
"full outside off, but Duminy uses his feet to meet this on the full. Drills a drive to long off as <b>South Africa get to 100</b>"
"full outside leg stump, and Duminy's attempted sweep does not come off. Goes down the leg side and that's <b>the fifty partnership!</b>"
"full on middle stump, but Duminy skips down the wicket and then thumps this slog over the midwicket boundary! Boom"
"<b>misses the reverse sweep!</b> Full on off stump and Duminy's premeditated shot hits his pad instead. The ball flies away to the leg side though, thus allowing them to jog across"
"<b>sliced to point!</b> Amla was looking so good today. Just full and wide outside off, and Amla's attempted drive over extra cover goes behind square instead"
"short of a length outside off, punched towards mid-on off the back foot but midwicket gets across to his left to stop"
"<b>bam!</b> He's plenty settled. Picks Akila's attempted googly, meets it at the pitch outside off and belts it to the wide long-off boundary on the bounce"
"tossed up at off stump, nice stride forward to flick into the leg side"
short of a length slider outside off. Backs away and toe-ends this punch to sweeper cover
"short of a length on off stump, punched to long-off from deep in the crease"
"<b>slapped</b> away but that was close. Got very deep and allowed this length ball to come in as he exposed all the stumps. But in the end, he's timed this to perfection and sweeper has no chance to his right"
"length ball wide outside, backs away again and swings his arms through it. Slices it through point, uppishly. Sweeper cleans up"
"short of a length and in at middle stump, punched to long-on off the back foot"
"swings it to deep midwicket off the back foot. Short ball speared across off stump, drags the pull off the toe-end"
short of a length and in at the chest. Gets on his toes and jabs this into the covers. Cramped over there
"<b>short of Shehan</b> at sweeper cover. Klaasen gets another off the toe-end. Overpitched ball outside off and it's there for a caning,  but he opens the face too early on this. It skies to the sweeper's left and falls short"
"short of a length outside off, mistimed poke off the bottom of the bat again. Got well outside the line of that"
"nicely played. Short ball outside off, chopped to sweeper's left"
"yorker at middle stump, exposes the stumps and jams this into the covers"
"<b>clears mid-on.</b> After that clean hit off Akila, Klaasen's not quite finding the timing. This short ball hurries at him at chest height in the corridor, he's looking to pull and once again, it's off the toe"
yorker jammed into the legs. He looks to swing across the line but it deflects through short third man off his pads
<b>Mathews grabs it</b> at extra cover and chucks the ball into the turf in fury. Sri Lanka have an opening. Klaasen backs away against a length ball that's sliding away from off. Has too much of a reach as a result. Ends up slicing the punch uppishly and Sri Lanka's captain lunges low to his left to hold on
short of a length and angled in at middle stump. Gets back in the crease and punches back to the bowler
"short of a length slider at off, hurried punch to extra cover"
"walks into the off side, allows it to come onto the pad and taps to long-on with the angle"
"<b>Shanaka has hit the non-striker's stumps</b> and Duminy is gone! That's a terrible decision from Duminy to go for that run, but it is stunning work from the fielder. One stumps to aim at from extra cover and he's done it in a single, smooth motion. Calm pick-up, accurate throw. But you must question the wisdom of going for that run. It was a relatively well-timed tap off the back foot, straight to the fielder. He's short by about two yards"
"shot. Bouncer in the corridor, gets his weight nicely behind it and spanks it with a grounded pull through midwicket"
"short of a length outside off, sliced straight to backward point"
"length ball on middle stump, tapped back to the bowler who chucks it back in his direction. Dickwella cleans up"
"<b>beaten.</b> Short ball at leg stump, cuts away a touch. Natural variation. Andile swings from under it as it climbs over the stumps"
"<b>oh that's classy</b> from Andile. Length ball on the pads, short half stride across to cover the line and a nice looking pick-up to beat midwicket to his left"
<b>beaten again.</b> Backs away to go over extra cover but misses the overpitched ball going across him
"that's beautifully done. Gets his feet in a nice position after stepping out, meets the length ball where it lands and sends a clean drive over the bowler"
"length ball sliding down leg, can't get bat on the flick"
"<b>in the air</b> but well short of long-on. Miller looks to pull a short ball coming into him, but he's late on it. It skids on with the moisture"
"length ball sliding in at off stump, backs away and chops to sweeper cover"
"full on leg stump, flicks to midwicket off the toe-end"
length ball slid into the pads. Cops it on the pads as he gets deep to try and whip this
steps out and under-edges into the off side. Looked premeditated. It was a wide length ball and he's done well to get bat on it after making too much room
"short of a length outside off, nice flowing drive on the up to sweeper cover"
"<b>through him!</b> Andile plays across the line, nowhere near covering the line of that. It can be perilous when the ball is slanting across you, more so when the moisture is adding more zip. He drags it on from outside off"
"<b>glorious.</b> Pure timing from Mulder. It's short of a length outside off, he waits for it to come on and opens the face very late to run this past point"
"<b>beaten.</b> Angles in and straightens, while keeping low. Mulder has little idea about this as he gets on the back foot to defend"
"length outside off, mistimed punch into the covers"
"short of a length and angled in at the stumps, punched to extra cover"
"short of a length on off stump, tapped to extra cover with soft hands"
<b>into the thigh guard</b> and the crowd is now cheering every dot ball loudly. Mulder steps out and gets cramped by a length ball as he looks to flick it
"length ball down leg side, can't get bat on that"
"<b>inside onto pad</b> and another dot. It rolls past the stumps to Dickwella and Miller has to send Mulder back. Looking to drive this length ball on the up, well away from the body. It's a nervous shot"
"<b>what a catch.</b> Dhananjaya de Silva leaps to his left and plucks one that's hit quite well from Mulder. He's at short midwicket and this pull shot was travelling. Short ball outside off, he got a clean swing on it but he's going back to the pavilion. Sri Lanka believes"
"short ball at the stumps, gets behind the line and dabs it into the covers with soft hands"
"length outside off, punched to long-off on the up"
"<b>clears cover.</b> A rookie mistake, and so many extra runs. Maharaj lines up on an off stump guard, Lakmal gets the ball wide outside off at a good length and Maharaj swipes under it"
"length on off stump, jabbed towards extra cover with soft hands"
"<b>past the outside edge.</b> Maharaj has the right idea, but his attempted poke down to third man against a corridor ball doesn't work out"
"<b>fumbled</b> and a run-out chance comes to nothing. Length ball in at off stump, nudged towards extra cover. Mathews is quite close and is onto the ball quickly, but is overeager and misses on the pick up"
"<b>direct hit from long-off</b> and Keshav Maharaj's bold call for the second will be checked by the third umpire. In the meantime, the ricochet has given them an extra run in the leg side. <b>He's in.</b> Miller got a leading edge towards long-off and Maharaj was keen for the second. Came back and slid his bat. Good work. Once again, extra runs earned"
"<b>under-edge</b> towards the keeper. Looks to run another one down to third man, short and in the corridor"
<b>swipes and misses.</b> Short of a length ball with some angle into the corridor. Can't connect
"nicely done. Length ball on the pads, flicked to deep square's right for an easy second"
"short ball in the corridor, chopped down to third man"
"<b>inside edge</b> past the keeper. Length ball down leg side, a wild heave as he waltzes down leg side and I suppose he's got the desired result"
<b>beaten</b> as he looks to slug another one. Short of a length ball rising up at him and he's made room by going down leg again. This sails over the stumps
"<b>well bowled.</b> As Maharaj lines up for another swing across the line, Lakmal know what's coming. Bowls an offcutter, short and outside off. Maharaj is through the shot too soon"
"short and into the body, gets behind the line and drops it into the off side with soft hands"
"<b>toe-end to mid-off</b> and once again third umpire confirms Maharaj has made his ground. Runs down the pitch and is nicely in position to blaze this length ball through extra cover, but doesn't make good enough connection"
"length ball across off, looks to guide it between short third man and backward point but find the latter"
"<b>walloped!</b> What a shot that is! Mathews has his head in his palms after that fizzes past him at extra cover. Thisara's line and length has become a tad predictable. Length ball in the corridor, Mahraja makes room and slaps it. Mean hit."
"length ball in at off stump, allows it to come on and gently pokes it into the covers"
"<b>mix-up and dive</b>, no direct hit from extra cover. Miller might have made it anyway. Taps this length ball in front of that fielder and takes off, then for some reason stops, loses half a second and is forced to scramble. All good for him in the end"
"<b>bowled him!</b> Top of off. Predictable line and length because it's an effective line and length. Maharaj, who slapped the previous such ball through cover, looks to pull this time. It's not the right shot. The ball skids through from under and tonks off stumo"
<b>whacked to sweeper</b> cover and he won't run. It's like bowling in a Test match for Lakmal. Bowls to his off side field. Angle across the corridor. Miller gets a good piece of this but it's straight to the fielder and he won't run
"<b>gone!</b> Sri Lanka have engineered this wicket to perfection! A slower ball from Lakmal. You can predict the line and length from the field, you can't predict the pace. Miller, forced into swinging across the line, has not picked the offcutter in the corridor. Looks to slog and gets an inside edge onto stumps"
"length ball into the pads, a laboured push towards long-on"
<b>beats the inside edge</B> and leg stump. Length ball angled into the batsman who's looking to offer the full face as he tries to lift this over midwicket
<b>swings it away</b> and it's a long chase for both deep square and deep midwicket. They've come back for the second. Length ball on the stumps and he hurriedly drags this away. Chance for a third there? Not today
"<b>can't get it away.</b> It's a single at extra cover and it's not enough. Lakmal bangs it in, cramps Dala at chest height and the attempted pull splices harmlessly into the off side"
