"another short ball, looks to muscle this over long-on but finds Gunathilaka there. This had a lot of power but he got down low, cupped both hands and allowed them to lodge safely.

heaved over deep midwicket. The man there had a chance just for a split-second but he was on the move and airborne as he tried to catch. The ball just burst through again. Can't bowl length from around the wicket. Excellent effort from Seekkuge Prasanna.

Short of good length, angling across on middle and straightening. Beats the inside edge of the batsman and hits the front pad. No bat involved, replays confirm. Clipping the top of middle and off, just about brushing the bails, and the umpire's call remains. Sri Lanka have lost an early wicket as well as their one review"

tries to loft this over the leg side and not in control. Tries to take on the mid-on fielder and the spin means he cannot find the middle of the bat and the ball lands safely around the midwicket region
"appeal for stumping. Referred upstairs. And I'll tell you what. That is very, very tight. Seems like a goner. Comes forward to a length ball and looks to open the face of his bat. The ball spins sharply and the foot has just come out of the line. Question is if he has entirely slid it back in. Does not seem like from the first angle. The bails are off and he has brought the foot back in but it seems to be on the line. Rahim was quite confident. This is taking some time as the TV umpire makes use of various angles to ascertain if any part of the foot is inside the line. On the line is what it seems to be. I reckon this will go in favour of the bowler. He may have got a spike or two inside the line. But even those seem to be on the line. Oh, the TV umpire has ruled not out. But that was really, really close."
