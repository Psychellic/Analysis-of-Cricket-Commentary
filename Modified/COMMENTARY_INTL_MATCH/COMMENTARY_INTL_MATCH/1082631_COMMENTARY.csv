"fuller than a good length and outside off, swings away further, Narine lets it pass. The ball dies on its way to Dhoni"
"Unadkat shortens his length, sustains the awayswing, Narine jabs at it and watches the ball whistle past the outside edge. His feet went nowhere"
"the ball rolls through to MS Dhoni. Unadkat rolls his fingers across this offcutter, Narine swishes early with no feet. <strong>Crawls through to Dhoni after two bounces</strong>"
"full and wobbles into Narine, he flashes and does not make contact again"
"back of a length and nips away outside off, encouraging carry to Dhoni now. Narine sticks his bat a long way away from hid body and is beaten again"
"<strong>Unadkat starts off with a wicket maiden</strong>. Narine finally puts bat on the ball. Sharp return catch to his left. Rolls his fingers across this cutter outside off, Narine flat-bats it. Not off the middle because he played early. Skewed back. <b>This is Pune's first ever maiden in the first over of an IPL match</b>"
"veering down leg side, glanced off the thigh fine on the leg side"
"full on middle and leg, clipped away in the gap at midwicket"
jabbed into the covers as this was on a length and wide outside off
"back of a length and angling away outside off, Gambhir punches on the up to cover, who fumbles and deflects the ball to cover. KKR look to run off the misfield. Smith throws the ball to Dhoni, who runs in and deftly flicks the ball onto the stumps, but Jackson is in"
"good length and outside off, beaten past the outside edge. Jackson was stuck to the crease"
"wide of the crease, short and angled in, tucked away to the right of square leg. Long leg runs in and hunts the ball down"
"back of a length on the leg stump, cramps him for room, Jackson skips out, and inside-edges onto the thigh"
"Jackson jumps outside leg and opens up the off side. This was short and outside off, rasping cut to the right of backward point. Flies to the boundary"
"Jackson jumps outside leg again, Unadkat holds his own now. Chases the batsman and pings the thigh with a skiddy delivery"
"Jackson uses his feet, skips down the track, Unadkat drags his length back significantly and goes over the stumps. The batsman slogs.... and misses"
nudged off the pads towards short fine leg
"short of a length and wide outside off, tennis-ball bounce, Gambhir throws his hands at it, and toe-ends it to mid-off"
"tossed outside off, no turn, played back"
"full and attacks the stumps - that's why he bowls in the first six - no room, played back"
"<strong>bounces over off stump</strong>. Slower through the air, straightens and just goes over off stump as Gambhir goes low for a big slog-sweep and misses"
"flat, skids in, hike in pace, nearly 100ks, raps the pad and rolls to cover"
"Hit straight of long-on who is in the deep. Floated up on middle, Jackson races down the track, gets close to the pitch and lofts it down the ground"
"<strong>Oh dear, Jackson is out hit wicket</strong>. This is the flat skidder on middle stump, Jackson has to go back. He goes too far back and steps on the stumps. Works it away towards square leg and looks to set off for a single. Dhoni, though, appealed to the square leg umpire after Jackson trod on the stumps or rather pointed to the fielder to stop the ball. Jackson has to exit, though"
"full and angling across off stump, slashes and misses"
"back of a length on off, skids onto hit the pad as Gamhbhir plays across the line and misses"
"just short of a good length and angling away outside off, stands tall and punches a single to mid-off"

"Gambhir shuffles across, this is full on the pads, flicked away smartly square of short fine leg"
"short of a length and outside off, Gambhir can't beat the tight off-side infield. Punches on the up to cover-point"
"slower offbreak outside off, dips, the batsman plays early and chips it to the right of a diving Sundar"
"fired on middle stump, Gambhir gives him the charge and swats it away to deep midwicket running to his left"
"tossed up on middle, Sundar does not give room, but Gambhir manufactures it. He backs away outside leg and drives it inside out over extra cover"
"Gambhir dumps Sundar over the long-on boundary. Slides in on off, advances down the track, launched away"
"Having hit back-to-back boundaries, Gambhir goes for another one. He finds Rahane at deep midwicket. Flat and wider outside off, Gambhir fetches it from there and drags it across the line in the air. Holes out to Rahane at deep midwicket"
"tossed on off, driven with the spin to long-on"
"stump-to-stump line, forward and pushed to mid-off"
"back of a length and outside off, opens the face and runs it to point"
"back of a length and angled in on middle and leg, worked away to deep square leg"
"back of a length on off, Pathan tips it to short cover and chances a single. The fielder, Tiwary, swoops down on the ball and effects a direct hit at the non-striker's end. Pathan just about slides his bat in time and gets away"
"hip-high short ball on the leg stump, gets inside the line and helps it to long leg"
"back of a length and outside off, Pathan inches forward and jabs to cover"
"legbreak, tossed up, finishes just outside off, dabbed to cover"
"full and outside off, this one turns further, dabbed again with soft hands, this time finer to short third man. Pathan dives to make his crease. Dhoni missed that signature between-the-legs flick. Had he flicked it, Pathan would have been out"
"lovely dip. Teasing legbreak, drags him forward. Defended back"
"non-turning full ball on off, paddled to long leg"
"Bang! Pushed through on off stump, Pandey plants his front foot and shovels it powerfully with the bottom hand, clears a leaping Smith at deep midwicket"
"flatter and straighter, quicker one from Tahir. The length is full, Pandey hangs back and ekes out an inside edge onto the pad. The umpire gesticulates the batsman had edged it"
"back of a length and angled in on off, goes back and clips it into the vacant spaces at midwicket"
"fuller on off, gets forward and punchily drives it back to the bowler"
"shortish and outside off, the batsman ducks but hangs the periscope up. The ball rolls to third man"
"full and outside off, push driven to cover"
"good length and angled in on off, defended to mid-on"
"off-stump yorker, swings in, 140ks, dug out past the right of Thakur for one. Time-out"
"an appeal for lbw from Tahir. Umpire Ananthapadmanabhan raises his finger. It was plumb. Flatter and quicker from wide of the crease, this slider crashes into the front pad as Yusuf is stuck to the crease, playing across it. It was crashing into the middle of middle. That was how plumb it was. Tahir brings out the rock-the-baby celebration, Ã  la Darren Sammy"
"googly, breaks in, picks it and pushes it to long-on"
"another googly, the batsman does not read it, but keeps it out"
"full and outside off, driven through the line to cover"

"full and angled in, picks it up with the angle and stylishly whips it over midwicket from middle and leg"
"just short of a good length and outside off, flat-batted away to Tiwary at short cover. He aims at the non-striker's end and hits the microscope. The ball ricochets away to the boundary"
"slower short ball outside off, Pandey spots it. Adjusts and flat-bats it over midwicket, tennis-style. A hat-trick of fours against the run of play"

"full and straight, driven down to long-on"
"shorter and spins away, chopped to point"
"tossed full and outside off, checks his drive and hits it to long-off"
De Grandhomme picks the googly and smokes it with the spin into the stands behind midwicket. He gets down on one knee and nails the slog sweep
"Christian runs to his left from long-off in a bid to take the overhead catch. He can only tip it over the boundary after leaping off his feet. Tahir follows the wrong'un with a regulation legbreak. Spins away outside off, de Grandhomme lofts it with the spin again but does not middle it and skies it in the air. Christian probably jumped early. <b>He parries it over</b>. The result is a six"
"short and wide outside off, angled to short third man"
"full and slower outside off, pushed back"
"back of a length and outside off, Pandey uses the pace and slices it away square of short third man"
"full on off, whipped with the wrists to deep midwicket"
"slower legcutter outside off, waits for the ball to arrive, and dabs it to the left of Stokes at backward point. Excellent, tumbling save"
"looks like another slower ball outside off, stabbed back to the bowler"
"misses the yorker, full-toss outside off, forward and check-driven to the right of sweeper cover. Timing and placement"
"pitched up and wide outside off, reaches out and crunches a drive again, this time sweeper runs to his right and mops it up"
"back of a length and angled in on leg stump, worked away to the left of midwicket"
"slower ball, 117ks, pushed wide outside off, glided down to deep third man"
"back of a length and holds its line outside off, scythed away to point, straight to the fielder"
"Pandey rushes down the track, length and outside off, flat-batted to mid-off"
Holes out to deep midwicket. Slower ball comes in towards leg stump. Pandey looks to swat it away. He has to manufacture all the pace. Skews it off the bottom of the bat to Rahane at deep midwicket
"back of a length, slower ball outside off, 111ks, de Grandhomme picks it. Waits on the back foot, opens the face, and drives it to the left of cover, then beats Tripathi to his right at sweeper"
"seam-up, short of a length and angled in on the hips, tucked around the corner"
"short and on leg stump, deflected off the thigh pad to leg"
"slower short ball outside off, waits for it, and pulls to deep midwicket"

"flat slider on leg stump from the front of the hand, 96ks, whipped to deep midwicket"
"full on the stumps, shovelled away with the bottom hand to long-on"

"fired into the pads now, 102ks, whipped to long-on"
"full offcutter, De Grandhomme plays early and is beaten. That's the first dot he has faced"
"another slower ball, skewed to Sundar at backward point. Slower offcutter, grips in the surface, and bounces at de Grandhomme. He uses his feet and eyes up the leg side but plays far too early. Pops off a leading edge to the fielder. Unadkat is turning it around for Pune again"
"wide of the crease, another slower ball, stabbed back to the bowler"
"back of a length on middle, steps away outside leg and goes inside out to sweeper"
"slower ball on off, opens the face and dabs to point"
"floats another slower ball, on a length and wide outside off, the batsman can't reach out and slice it away. Beaten"
"full on middle and leg, whipped away to deep midwicket"
"back of a length and angled in, punched to midwicket"
"slower ball, hip-high ball on off stump, Suryakumar spots the drop in place. And swings it freely over long leg. Pulled off the front foot for a six. Smack"
"back of a length on middle, punched wide of long-on. Surya and Woakes chance the second. The throw is the deep is flat, Christian collects it and takes the bails off. Woakes has been caught well short"
"short on off, backs away outside leg and scythes it to sweeper"
"<strong>Clatters into the grille of the helmet</strong>. Nasty, nastly blow. Banged in short, 142ks, deceptive pace. Coulter-Nile is late onto the hook. He is rushed for pace. The ball thuds into the helmet and drops onto the ground. Christian immediately shows concern for Coulter-Nile. Smith walks up and checks on his Australian team-mate as well. This results in a hold-up in play"
"slower ball on off, 118ks, Suryakumar reads it. Gets his front foot across off and deftly scoops it over short fine leg"
"slower, fuller, wider outside off. Suryakumar backed away outside leg, but still managed to reach out and slap it inside out over extra cover"
"third straight slower ball. Third straight boundary. This one goes all the way. Offcutter ends on middle, goes low, and scoops it all the way over fine leg"
"seam-up, very full and angling away wide outside off, driven through the covers"
"<b>Nasty collision between Smith and Stokes near the edge of the boundary</b>. Smith rams into Stokes and tumbles over the boundary. His head bangs against an ad board. He seems okay. He gives the thumbs-up. This was the slower ball on off stump, Coulter-Nile swings it across the line. Gets plenty of height. Smith runs to his right from long-on, Stokes to his left from deep midwicket. Stokes takes the catch but goes over the ad board and collides with Smith. It could have been uglier"
"full and angled across off, he can't connect with his leg-side slog"
"near yorker on off, dug out to leg"
"slower ball outside off, swings and misses"
the batsman steps away outside leg and looks to whip it over midwicket. This is the slower ball chasing him. Sppons a leading edge to backward point
picked off the pads to deep square leg
"just short of a good length and outside off, chopped away. Tahir dives to his right at short third man and takes some pace off the ball"
loopy slower full-toss wider outside off - wider than a set of stumps - reaches out and toe-ends it to short third man
"<b>half an appeal straight away</b> as the batsman shoulders arms to a good length ball just a shade outside off. They thought about the lbw, but it isn't coming back enough to hit the stumps"
"outside edge, and it flies away. Immediately, Gambhir asks the bowler if he wants a second slip. Could do with one, really, if Rahane continues to play flowing drives without moving his feet"
"145kph, back of a length on off stump, Rahane reads the pace better, and prefers the change in length, as he dabs towards the wide slip"
"141kph, lets it come on and then glides it off the open face to the right of deep third man."
"are you ready, he asks, about a quick single, and Tripathi answers. Coulter-Nile continues hitting the deck, bringing the ball up towards Rahane's ribs. The batsman blocks with soft hands and sets off"
"steps forward to a 143 kph delivery, on the rise, and blocks it off the front foot. Not always the wisest option, but this one comes off the middle"
"139kph, thunders in and bowls shortish on off stump, Rahane hops back in his crease to run it to point"
"there's deviation - that's why they appeal for caught behind - as Rahane hangs back, beside the ball, and looks to dab it down to third man. But the ball has simply swung posthumously"
"lovely hit - almost carries to the point boundary. And yet the batsman puts in the slightest effort. Just swayed his torso back and punched at the ball with an open face, intending to lift it over the infield"
"<b>what a delivery</b>! It just kept closing in on Rahane, who thinks he has the chance to run it to third man, a stroke he is impeccably good at. But Umesh's pace - and his bounce - the ball just kept rising - takes the glove through to the keeper"
"and just to confirm that it is him, he shuffles across and tries to take a shortish delivery on off stump and whip it through midwicket. Gets only an inside edge"
crunches a shortish delivery - at 140 kph - to point
"another appeal for a caught behind - more than 50,000 people follow suit - but the umpire won't give in. Superb bowling from KKR. You wouldn't think this to be a slow pitch with the ball in Coulter-Nile's hands. Goes for a bouncer and it beats Tripathi for pace as he tries to hook"
sensational strike. He stands up tall against a back of a length delivery in the corridor and simply drills it through the covers
"slips it down leg, Tripathi looks for the leg glance, but fails to reach it"
"<b>stops on the batsman</b>, a timely reminder of the pitch's two-paced nature. Coulter-Nile hits the deck on off stump, Tripathi is ready to defend but he finds himself playing too early"
"races down the pitch, making room to swing his arms through the line of a full delivery outside off."
"he's been putting away good balls, so why would you give him a full toss? Thumps it straight, and places it to the left of mid-on"
"one-bounce over square leg. He's getting used to the big, burly quick. Picks the length early, gets inside the line of the short ball so he can pull it to where there are no boundary riders. Fine batting."
"and they just keep coming. Smith deciding he has to match Tripathi, comes down the track, gives it a flat-batted slap, gets an inside edge past the keeper diving to his left"
whips a full delivery tailing into him through midwicket
"fine leg is up inside the circle, so he shuffles across, trying to lift a back of a length delivery on off stump over Yusuf Pathan. No such luck"
"opens the face and taps a shortish delivery towards point. Smith steps down looking for a single, waits for the fielder to misfield, and then gets through"
"sails away. Pace on the ball is working to Tripathi's plans. He swivels on the back foot, reaches up to the ball, which is over his head on off stump, and hooks it - right off the middle - over the fine leg boundary"
"now he picks the slower ball. This is a legcutter, telegraphed to the batsman, so wide and with little love-notes. Tripathi accepts with a slash over point"
"<b>kicks up off the surface</b> to surprise Smith. He is all set, moving across, as his his birthright, to block the ball. But it holds up and hits the splice of his bat as he defends"
"smashing hit! Full length ball on off stump, Smith just wades into it, a straight bat sending the ball over long-on. That brings up Supergiant's fastest team fifty in the IPL"
"back of a length and outside off, Smith looks to carve it through point, but he is playing too early. The inside edge <b>misses the stumps <b/>"
he ain't stoppin! Nor should he against half-volleys on middle stump. An on-drive that should be framed on his house
swings hard at a short ball outside off and sends it to deep square leg
"off stump goes to sleep, possibly peeved that Smith would play a shot like that and leave it open to Woakes' menace. He backs away to try and flay a shortish delivery through cover, misses altogether"
"slides one down the leg side, Tripathi tries to reach it, but he has no chance"
blocks a rising delivery on off stump
"good length ball outside off, defends towards point"
"smashes it over deep midwicket. Cuts his fingers across, digs it into the pitch, Tripathi reads it all like a book, while lounging on the grass at a picnic. Rocks back and pulls over midwicket"
"the open face, he is so conscious about it, puts so much effort into doing it, and for all that he gets the opposition captain lying flat on the ground and the ball through cover for four"
"looks to pull, but he has not picked the slower ball well enough this time. Inside edges it onto his thigh"
tonk! He is loving it out there. Walks across to Tiwary with a massive smile on his face as he sends the big scary fast bowler to the boundary again. This time with a flat bat over long-on. Brutal
"back of a length and outside off, sends it to point"
"short and outside off, pulls it to deep square leg"
runs it down to deep third man
"goes for the bouncer, just outside off, Tiwary knows not to drag it across onto the leg side. Avoids it altogether"
"<b>almost into the hands of a wide slip</b>. Tiwary sizes up a good length ball, but forgets about Suryakumar lurking around behind him. Opens the face and is lucky the ball falls short"
"<b>jags back</b> soooo sharply off the pitch, about the only kind of delivery that could stop Triapthi in this form,  able to handle it. Inside edge onto pad"
"the latest of late cuts. He picks the flatter delivery, hangs back, lets it go past him before he slices it to the third man boundary"
"slinks back, playing the man on length, and nudging it towards midwicket"
gets a bottom edge as he tries to dab it to third man. Finds a single before Yusuf Pathan can catch up to it
"doesn't read this as the one that goes away from the right-hander. Midway through the forward defensive, he opens the face and guides it to point"
"good length ball on off stump, blocks"
"there is no fine leg - and that is the sole reason why he jumps so far across his off stump and scoops the ball away. All he needs is to make half-decent connection because he has done everything else perfectly. Picked the ball that he can get under so early, moved himself into the right position, and now all that is left is to raise his bat for his fifty, off only 23 balls"
"back of a length on off stump, defends to cover"
"ripper! He isn't just an outswing bowler. People seem to think that's all he has, but this one hits the seam, nips back, takes the inside edge of a batsman just thrusting his hands at the ball and then crashes into his stumps"
on the hips and Stokes whips it to long leg
"slides down leg, tries a little glance, misses out. Another ball that hits the deck and seams in"
"goes for the bouncer on middle and off, ignores it altogether"
"nails a cover drive, but he picks out Gambhir at short cover. Gee, they're come off like lightning off his bat"
"first ball from Narine and he reverse sweeps it to the boundary. He does most of the work for this shot in his mind. Knows it will be length and wicket-to-wicket, then trusts his power to do the rest"
"into the pads, comes the next one, quick and intended to keep the batsman down to a single. Stokes doesn't mind, after sending the ball to long leg"
good length ball on off stump - a lot slower through the air - Tripathi can't handle that as he goofs up a block
nudges it away through midwicket
"doesn't pick the offspinner, he is moving back in his crease, seeing the short length, ready to pull, but has to adjust and block instead"
whips a flatter delivery on middle and leg through to midwicket
"tosses it up outside off, drives to long-off"
what power! Leaps back in his crease and then punches a shortish delivery on middle towards the boundary left of midwicket. The fielders do well though
"tosses it up outside off, Tripathi lunges forward and blocks it into the covers to bring up the team's 100. That means we have more balls than runs in the equation"
"tosses it up on off stump, defends"
"shortish and outside off, cuts to point"
"slows it up on off stump, but Stokes is happy the length is well... length. Jumps back and cuts to deep point"
goes back to hit a good length ball spinning away from him through cover
"that's a bad effort from Woakes, and he knows it, screams at himself. At deep midwicket, he moves to his left, but is way too slow to get down. A slog sweep meant to be one becomes four"
"<b>appeal for a stumping</b> as Tripathi looks to block but he misses. Clearly he hasn't read the ball turning away from the right-hander. Jackson, the keeper, has not. Takes it cleanly and then knocks the bails off. The batsman, however, listens to his instincts after he is beaten and drags his back foot back in time"
looks for another slog sweep - he is playing that shot the moment a ball is tossed up outside off. This time though he inside edges to deep midwicket
covers all his stumps and then flicks a good length ball through to deep square leg. Well taken two. Stokes made sure to use only a limited amount of his power in that shot
"tosses it up on off stump, drives to long-off"
strides down the pitch and drives a flighted delivery on leg stump to long-on.
"what a strike, I mean the glove punch between the players after this six. Just full of gusto. He takes a tossed up delivery on off stump and launches it over midwicket"
hammers it again! The smile on his lips will not go away for about three weeks. Takes a length ball on off stump and shovel sweeps it over long-on
there's the hat-trick and the equation has been punctured - 27 off 44. Flighted delivery in line with off stump is send screaming into the KKR dugout. He isn't happy shutting up the Eden Gardens faithful. He's going after their heroes
"flatter delivery outside off, dabs to third man"
"good length ball outside off, carves it through cover point and that brings us to the time out"
"tosses it up on middle and leg, brings out a flick, but he gets a bit of a leading edge to third man"
"loops it up outside off, Stokes tries the cover drive, tentatively, like how one steps into a dark room, outside edges to short third man"
"superb catch by Narine himself, running back the moment he made Stokes top-edge the ball. Races to where an orthodox mid-on would be, always in control, then reaches out with both hands and takes it like a boss. Hundred a day ago, but Eden consumes Stokes, again. Walks off thrusting the bat into the outfield. A parting shot."
"good length ball on off stump, Tripathi blocks and gets an outside edge to short third man"
hangs back to defend a shortish delivery on off stump
"a little legcutter, and it is defended towards point"
"picks the googly, rocking back and trying to cut it. No timing on the shot though"
"tosses it up on off stump, Dhoni comes forward to block"
"plonks his bat in front of his pad, but the dip on this delivery deceives him. Leading edge pops out towards short cover"
rocks back and punches a shortish delivery to long-on
drives through the line of a good length ball outside off - Kuldeep had gone around the wicket to see if that would make any difference to the batsman in form. No luck
"loopy delivery outside off, Dhoni sees the tempting thing, but decides just to tap it to long-off. The long-haired version would have boxed it up and sent it home to Ranchi"
"good length ball on off stump, pushes it towards point"
hangs back and glides a shortish delivery to deep third man. He's making sure he lasts the chase
"back of a length and outside off, Dhoni slots it into the gap between cover and point"
looks to slug a back of a length ball on off stump over midwicket and for once his outrageous hitting ability fails him. Kind of like when Asterix's magic potion runs out
"one-handed flick to deep square leg - and that's not to show off, no. He is into the shot too early and in an earnest attempt to keep the ball down, he pulls one hand off"
into the pads and Dhoni sends it to long leg for a single
"he's walking. That's twice in two matches Kuldeep has had Dhoni. This one is the googly, which the batsman has not picked. Reaches out, trying to drive the ball to long-off, but with it moving further away from him, he can only nick it to the keeper"
plays the sweep against the googly and his hit on the back pad. Would have missed off stump though
"flatter delivery on off stump, punches it to cover"
"good length on off stump, defends to point for a single"
"the flurry of wickets has left Tripathi unsure. Sees a loopy delivery on off stump, but it dips rapidly, so he blocks and lives to strike another day"
into the nineties with a monster. This time he goes down on one-knee against the very ball he blocked and slog sweeps it over deep square leg
"good length ball on leg stump, defends. Umesh dives across to stop it"
gets under a bouncer on middle and leg
"good length, outside off, stump, Christian drives on the up and is beaten"
"short ball slides down leg, it's been called one bouncer, with Christian moving across to avoid it. Umpire spots it and says not a wide. Good work."
belts a length ball through to the sweeper on the off side
"the inside edge works. Puts bat behind a shortish delivery on off stump, and feels the ball roll off his pads towards point. Looks up at his partner, who is already haring across. Century watch in full swing"
races down the pitch to carve a shortish delivery through to deep cover
swings a back of a length delivery out to deep square leg
"bouncer - Tripathi loads up a hook, but it climbs up beyond his reach. The umpire lets it pass"
"he's gone! Gone for 93. Gone to a slower ball. Is there life in this game yet? Poor Tripathi. He has timed better balls to the boundary. This one is short, it has ample room to free the arms, he does free his arms, but pulls it straight to midwicket. Rovman Powell, who is yet to get a game, takes the catch"
"low full toss on off stump, nudges to short midwicket. The crowd goes up, thinking this is a catch."
"is that a wide? No, the umpire says it hit the thigh pad. A good length ball on leg stump gets a flick in answer, but Sundar misses making connection with bat. He is however alert to an overthrow"
"back of a length and outside off, glides it to deep third man"
there's a man there - but he has hit it hard enough to send it sailing over deep midwicket. Christian seals back-to-back matches with a six and puts Pune on third place. They have their sixth win in seven matches. They are contenders for the playoffs
