"141kph, full angled down leg, he backs away and clips this off this pads to deep midwicket for an easy two"
"<strong>brilliant conventional paddle!</strong> It was a good yorker, Labuschagne moved late and just got enough bat on it to paddle it fine of short fine leg"
"low full toss, he backs away and drives wide of mid off but can't beat the man"
"145kph, full toss, he shimmies outside off and glances this fine but straight to fine leg"
"<strong>caught at mid off!</strong> He picks out the man this time. It was a half volley in the slot, he tried to loft over mid off but nailed it flat and Agarwal takes the catch easily on the circle"
"142kph, full outside off, he punches a drive past cover for two to ensure Maxwell has the strike for the last over"
"<strong>Given caught behind!</strong> Maxwell <strong>reviews</strong>. It was full and straight, he tried to reverse lap scoop again and it looks like it just brushed the pad on the way through to Rahul! No hot spot on the bat. He missed it. <strong>The decision is overturned</strong>"
"<strong>missed at short third man! 50 for Maxwell off 25 balls</strong>. He sliced a top edge high to short third man, Shami backed back but got in a tangle and didn't get a hand on it. They run two"
<strong>low full toss smacked just over Pandya at deep midwicket!</strong> Incredible power. It was close to a yorker but not quite and Maxwell taxed him with the bottom hand whipping it over midwicket
"<strong>high full toss swatted into the Members!</strong> Like a baseballer at the plate, he got a delivery knee high and flushed over deep midwicket again"
"short and wide, he tries to uppercut but misses"
"full on leg, he backs away to have over midwicket but mistimes it to midwicket and they only get one"
"half volley on leg stump to start and nicely tucked away by Agarwal. Didn't try to over hit it, just timed it beautifully through midwicket. Excellent timing on that"
"back of a length going across him, drops his wrists and lets it go past"
"<b>super shot</b>. Agarwal's got his timing right from the start. Full outside off, going across him, low full toss and he just steers it through point with a horizontal bat"
"length on the stumps, punched back"
"length on the stumps again, better lines from Starc and he's pulled his length back too. Defended to point"
"back of a length targetting the ribs on off, stays behind it and defends calmly into the offside"
"what a start by Dhawan. Full outside off and he lashes it through cover with an easy, flowing cover drive"
"better length and line, back of a length and closer to off, gets up and defends towards point"
"back of a length again, going across him, he lets it go outside off"
"keeps it stump to stump on a length, pushed towards cover"
"keeps it tight, not a loose ball after that first one. On a length on off, and Dhawan can only defend"
going across a bit but Hazlewood keeps the ball near his front pad and Dhawan pushes it to cover. Excellent over
"yorker length almost on off, punched to cover"
"length outside off, chops it through point and a <b>mis-field by Smith</b> at point concedes a run"

"flowing drive to a ball that's fuller this time, outside off, but extra cover manages to stop it"
"good length on the stumps, defended from the crease"
"nice tight line outside off on a length, defensively pushed to point"
"slightly too straight that time, allows Agarwal to work this square on the legside"
"bouncer beats him. Dug in short and well targetted, on leg stump. Gets really big on him as he tries to pull. Ball flies past the grille and was too close to body to pull anyway"
"length outside off, pushes softly to mid-off and Warner sprints to his left and tumbles to stop the ball"
"back of a length on off, <b>mis-field at point</b> as it goes through him. Marnus the man there. He stayed on the back foot and punched it well, but that was straight to the man and should have been fielded"
"length outside off, going across a bit, pushes it to mid-on"
<b>mis-timed lofted drive but lands safe</b>. Fuller outside off and Dhawan went for the big drive but it wasn't quite as full. Gets it higher on the bat than he would have wanted and the ball goes up in the air over mid-on.
"length on the pads, flicked to fine leg"
"back of a length outside off, tapped down close to him towards silly point for a quick single"
"<b>inside edge goes for four</b>. Unlucky for Starc, nails a perfect yorker in front of middle, but Dhawan has managed to just jab his bat down in time for the ball to brush past the inside edge and go very fine"
<b>smashed</b>. That was authoritative. Back of a length but lots of room outside off and he stands up to ride the bounce and carve it over the infield to the point boundary
"another yorker goes for a boundary! Dhawan was more in control of this one though. Just inches away from being a perfect yorker on leg stump and he got his bat down to tap it fine, almost between his legs. Fine leg was too square to run around in time"
"length all, nudged towards square leg"
"he was making room but Hazlewood saw it and banged it in short while following him, Dhawan has to adjust and try the ramp but can't connect"
"<b>outside edge</b>. He's looking to flick it but it takes the edge and flies off to third man. Starc, who saw edges from him going to the fence last over, slides to his right and pulls off a good save"
"<b>swatted with disdain</b>. Slower ball gone wrong, pitches it way too short and it sits up for Dhawan, who rocks back and swivels to pull this through midwicket"
"fuller on the stumps, pushed softly towards cover for a quick single. <b>overthrows with the fielder there, Finch I think, having a shy at the stumps</b>"
short ball down legside and Carey goes up in appeal but the umpire is signalling wide. Dhawan was looking to pull this but it went over his bat. Clear daylight between bat and ball
"length on the stumps, defended to cover"
"<b>peachy</b>. Full outside off, there for the drive and he unfurls such a lovely one. Punch-drives it through extra cover. All timing and class"
"fuller on the stumps, punched past the bowler but mid-on is straighter and fields"
"<b>and he threads the gap again</b>. Agarwal's punch-drives don't have the same flourish that you associate with cover drives, but such pristine timing. Fuller outside off again and he comes on the front foot to bisect the field"
"length on middle now, nudged to midwicket"
"length outside off, nipping in, he jabs it back to the bowler"
"bouncer on off, he spotted it coming and ducked. But it's too high and will be a wide"
"fuller on off, punched to cover"
length on middle and steered to short third man
"<b>falls just short of a diving Marnus at deep square</b>. Didn't get on top of this bouncer while trying to pull, gets a top edge .Marnus was not near the ball but puts in a valiant effort running forward and to his left and diving forward, but the ball drops short"
pushed into the legside
"<b>easy catch at midwicket</b>. Slower ball possibly, because Dhawan was into his shot too early. Length around off, he was looking to whip it away. Plays it early and the ball loops up for a comfortable take in the circle"
"back of a length outside off, defended to cover on the back foot"
"length in the channel, lets it go"
"<b>through him</b>. Banged in on a hard length and nips in, Agarwal is playing inside the line of that and tried to run it down fine but beats his outside edge"
"back of a length outside off, more room this time, and he stays legside to punch through point"
"<b>caught behind</b>. Similar line to the first ball that beat him, kept it in the channel, banged it on a hard length and Agarwal gets a thin edge while looking to steer it fine. Super bowling"
"back of a length from wide of the crease, angling into him, jabbed to third man"
"length ball on a seventh stump line, Kohli's not interested in getting his bat anywhere near it"
"closer to off stump that time and Kohli waits and opens the face to steer it through point, but Maxwell does excellently to dive to his right and stop the ball"
"there's a bouncer now, but he ducks under it easily"
backs away and hacks it over the in-field on the offside for four. He's expecting the short ball and he's decided to take it on by moving in his crease and creating room
"bowler bluffed, the batsman didn't fall for it. Full ball on the pads to follow those two bouncers, Iyer stayed still and calmly flicked this through square leg"
backing away again but Hazlewood knows he'll do that now and bangs it in short and directed at him backing away. Too close to his body to hack and he doesn't connect
"fuller on the stumps, defended to cover"
"length ball on the stumps, looks like Iyer was hanging on the back foot for that one, adjusts quickly and defends it back down the pitch"
"fuller on off, driven to mid-off"
"length outside off, opens the face to steer it square, third man has to go to his right to field"
"another short ball, outside off, Kohli gets into position quickly and tries to unleash a pull, but the ball goes over bat as he connects only with air"
"fuller outside off, steered to backward point. Smith has a shy and hits the stumps direct, but that allows an overthrow"
"back of a length outside off, punched to backward point"
"<b>short ball almost does him in again</b>. He was a bit of a sitting duck there almost, as Cummins banged one in on target at middle stump. Moved back and across but could only fend it off. Luckily for Iyer, it went up till about head height only and dropped down quickly, and Cummins couldn't get to it in time for the return catch"
"fuller outside off, slashed to point"
"flat on the stumps, goes back and punches to long-on"
"flat outside off, stays legside of it and cuts through point"
"given some more air, gets drift too but it ends up on the pads and is worked square"
"length on the stumps, pushed towards cover and he sets off for a single but is sent back in time. Wisely so, the fielder swooped in and was letting loose a throw"
drags it down too short and Iyer pounces on it with a fierce pull. Probably hit it too hard so lost some timing but it's in the gap at midwicket
"another sharp short ball, outside off, but Kohli is equal to it and defends it toward point"
"length on off, moves across and uses wrists to tap it, but midwicket fields"
"<b>top edge clears fine leg</b>. Banged in short again outside off, Kohli moves across and takes him on with the pull shot. The ball was a bit too big on him though so he gets a bit of a top edge. Hit meatily enough to carry all the way"
"<b>lbw appeal given but Kohli's gone up for a review straightaway</b>.  This looks close but he could be saved by an inside edge. And it's clear why he went for the review. Clear inside edge. Good length outside off nipping in, and he is beaten on the inside edge trying to drive. But he's still there"
steered to point
"another short ball, Kohli controls his pull well enough to keep it down and get a single to deep square leg"
"tossed up outside off, reaches for it and slaps it but can't beat cover"

"and this one doesn't bounce as much as Hardik thought. Moving across, covers the line well to pull this, but the ball goes under the bat"

full toss in the channel again. Rahul's turn to be surprised by that and miss connecting. Aimed a big drive at it

"full outside off, gets low and drives to deep point"
"<b>chipped in the air but not in Finch's reach at point</b>. that seemed to really stick in the pitch, on a length outside off, he was too early into his cut, it ballooned off the upper edge. Finch opts to be safe rather than try a difficult catch with the game all but sewn up"
"length outside off, cuts to cover"
"flat and well wide of off, he chops it to deep extra cover"
"<b>down the track and clears long-off</b>. Wasn't hit cleanly, but had enough on it to go just over the long arms of Mitchell Starc at long-off."
"<b>dropped by Finch running backwards from point</b>. Went down on his knee to crash this through the offside, gets a top edge that swirls over point. The wind wouldn't have made it easy as Finch running back can't even lay hand on it"
"<b>and he's finally caught</b>. Hazlewood at short third man has a very easy take.
