"short of a length just outside off, opens the face and runs it down to third man"
"short of a length and wide outside off, slashes and misses"
"<b>bowled him!</b> What a start from Mills! Pure, unadulterated fire from the man. Curving away late from middle stump and is so full Shehzad has to play for the line. So he looks to flick but this thunders into his off stump"
"length just outside off, stabbed into the covers on the front foot. <b>151kph</b>"
<b>yorker</b> curving away away towards off stump. Watson offers a full face and defends into the off side
"overpitched just outside off, hurriedly driven to mid-off off the toe-end"
"short of a length at the pads, makes him hop off the pitch and deflect this towards short-fine off the thigh guard. He was pushing at it with one hand. 148kph and making him worry..."
"oh nicely put away. Full ball on the pads, leans in, uses the pace and closes the face at the perfect time to flick this through midwicket"
"length on leg stump, looks to flick and cops it on the pad"
"short and rising at the chest. He looks cramped because he's on the front foot, but the hands come through nicely and he drags this along the floor to the long leg boundary"
"length and in at leg stump, clipped to deep square off the inside half"
"<b>that is so high in the air</b> and just past the boundary! Was that a slower ball? 125kph from Hasan. An offcutter at a length on middle stump. He wants to use the pace and flick this behind square, but it ends up sailing high and just clearing the midwicket boundary. Not in control there"

"length and in at middle stump, stays leg side of it and dabs it towards short third"

"full and into the pads, gets low and uses the angle to loft his sweep to the square leg boundary. No one back there"
"<B>stunning!</b> Just stunning from Watson right now. Dawson doesn't know where to bowl. Lobs this up at a length on off and Watto skips down before launching this straight over the bowler's head. Sixteen runs off three balls, no risk whatsoever. Superb"

"yorker length on leg stump, looks to flick and gets it off the toe"
"short outside off, slashes and gets a thick outside edge that clears point"
"<b>get out of the way</b> umpire. Watson absolutely pummels this length ball straight back, but Pollard has done <b>sensationally</b> at long-on. Sprints to his left, lunges to his left and does a cartwheel as he grabs hold of this and keeps it to one. Unreal."
"<b>just evades</b> deep square. It's off the bottom of the bat as he gets back to pull, but it clears the fielder to his left"

<b>inside edge</b> into his body. Loses his footing as he makes room and looks to pull this again

"low full toss outside off, a slower ball. Can't get the drive past mid-off"
yorker outside leg stump. Deflected off the toe as he looks to flick
yorker wraps the toe again. Looks to flick but it's only a single at short fine. Nice bowling from Sameen

"<b>tonks off stump!</b> Wahab Riaz is unhittable tonight. Flings this in, rapid, at a length on middle stump. It slides away as Watson makes room to try and hit him over extra cover. Top of off is smashed and Wahab with the most smug expression as he's surrounded by his team-mates. Is it a bit late for Zalmi though? Watson's cracker innings has ended"
"full toss outside off, mistimed drive to mid-off"
"full on off stump, flicked with the angle to long-on's left"
<b>dropped!</b> Leading edge as Ahsan Ali looks to flick a slower ball from outside off. Dawson runs backwards from point and is caught spinning as this slides between body and hands. Third man wasn't too far off. Was it his catch?
"length outside off, punches to extra cover's left but his dive stops that. Saves three runs"
"<b>outswinging</b> yorker from around the wicket. Pakistan's no stranger to that ball, but Ahsan Ali certainly looks like he had no idea. Looks to flick again as this curves past the outside edge"
"overpitched outside off, throws the hands at it and gets it off the toe-end"
"length and in at leg stump, flicks aerially to deep square"
"<b>flat and past deep backward square.</b> Once again, incredible wrists from Ahsan. Length ball on leg stump and he picks it up, with the pace, and gets it over the line. 74 metres"
"short of a length outside off, opens the face and runs it to point"
"<b>that's plumb</b> unless he's got bat on it. He has a conversation with Rossouw and they don't take the review, so he's probably not got bat on it. Length ball at middle stump. Skids under his attempted flick and raps the knee flap of his back leg. That's hitting the middle of middle. Ahsan will no doubt keep his place in the next match though. Solid knock from him"
"<b>slashes</b> and can't get it off the middle. Length outside off, steps out and looks to carve this wide of mid-off. Can't manage it"

slower bouncer. Too short. Floats over his head
"<b>top edge</b> and Pollard takes it himself. Offcutter at a length on off stump, gets down for the slog sweep and can't get it away. Pollard is far away from it but uses his reach in the end to grab it in the leg side"

"<b>past the bat</b> again, as it's too quick. About time they start targeting the boundaries behind the crease? This one skids under the slog in the corridor"
<b>wide of deep midwicket</b> and into the boundary on the bounce. Stays still and uses the pace to lift this pull into the square leg boundary
<b>taken at point.</b> Low full toss tailing away from him. He gets into the leg side and has made too much room. Ends up slicing off the toe-end to the fielder
"length on leg stump, flicked to fine leg's left"
"<b>smashed</b> past the bowler and umpire. Short ball outside off, and he flat-bats it into the straight boundary. Almost a pull, that. Nicely timed"

"short ball outside off, a slower one. Looks to hook and is beaten"
"<b>holes out to deep midwicket.</b> Slower ball, short of a length. Looks to pull on length, but is deceived by the pace. Dawson runs in a few yards and holds on with a reverse cup. The sting has been taken out of this innings"

"full outside off, too fast for him to whip this into the leg side. Rolls out to mid-off off the toe-end"
"length outside off, guides to short third's right on the front foot"

"slower short ball outside off, subdued pull, dragged out to long-on's left"
"low full toss on off stump, backs away and drills it to sweeper's right. Wahab fuming at the fielder who has stayed extremely square for this ball. Effect of the left-right combo?"
<B>whips this away!</b> Stylish from Bravo to finish this innings. Full ball angled into him and he shuffles and gets the flick to the wide long-on boundary. Losing his length and that's four more to Wahab's figures
"<b>sends him over his head</b> first ball. Length outside off, steps out and allows it to skid on before slamming it flat"
"<B>inside edge</b> onto leg, lobs off the boot but safely away from Sarfraz. This was on a length at off stump and he was looking for the slog sweep"
short and wide and fast outside off. Left alone
short of a length and cutting away in the corridor. Squared up a touch as he pushes this to point
<b>big lbw appeal</b> is turned down. Kamran looks to run an arm ball down to third man. He's definitely got bat on this. Was there any pad? <b>No!</b> It's off the middle of the bat and there is absolutely no pad on this. Sarfraz was convinced and it was his call. It's a bad one

"<b>connects</b> and gets this over the midwicket boundary on the bounce. Short ball outside off, swings under it and gets connection on one at last"
"<b>picks out deep square</b> with a full toss! It's just been that kind of an evening for Kamran. Full toss on middle stump, flicks to Rossouw's right and he runs a few yards to his right and slides to hold on. Last ball of the Powerplay, Kamran leaves"

<b>that appears to have hit the bowler on the mouth.</b> Length ball was smashed straight back at his face. He could only get one hand up in time but that has taken off a lot of pace. He's on his feet as a result. Immediately holds up his hands to let everyone know he's okay. But he can't say a word so there must be bruising inside his mouth. Walks off the field now along with the physio. That was a nervous moment. Imam got down the pitch and smoked this straight back at Fawad
"<b>and he'll complete Imam's innings too!</b> Oh dear! Around the wicket with a quick, filthy straight ball short of a length and coming back at leg stump. Imam plays for the turn and gets back for the cut to lose his leg stump. Can't make this up!"

"length outside off, punched to sweeper's left"
"well bowled. Watches Misbah set up deep in the crease and tosses this up slow, at a length and wide outside off. Beats his slash"
....<b>and a wicket at long-on!</b> Unbelievable. He folds his hands and looks around sheepishly. It's dropped halfway down the pitch and Dawson can only slice this pull shot straight to that fielder. This is the first time Ahsan has ever bowled in this format. What a night for what Kevin Pietersen would call pie-chuckers
short and turning away outside off. Stands tall and slaps it past the bowler to a straight long-off. Quite a normal field position for Pollard in this format
"length ball sliding outside off, mistimed punch towards long-off"
short ball gets up at stomach height on a middle stump line. Pokes it to long-on off the back foot

"slower ball at a length outside off, gets back and clips towards long-on"
short of a length skidding rapidly into the back thigh as he looks to push this into the leg side. It was off the inside edge
"length on leg stump, dabbed through square leg off the back foot"
<b>pinned him on the back foot</b> and this looks very out. Misbah won't dispute the decision. He's had two balls against Hasnain and has completely misread him both occasions to be beaten by pace. Length ball skidding and getting his back leg in front of off as he tries to hit this off the back foot. Should have been forward
"<b>straight into the box</b> to welcome Sammy! Deceptive, this guy! Sammy also gets on the back foot to a length ball and is struck straight in the box. Onto the floor immediately and out sprints the team doctor. He's writhing, jumping around. That has stung."

"slower ball, full toss on middle stump. Lines up for the swing but adjusts and taps to long-on"
"<b>just over the long boundary!</b> Length and into the pads - this isn't normal for Bravo. But picking them off is daily business for Darren Sammy. Uses the angle, uses the pace, whips it over short fine and eventually over the boundary padding"
"<b>smokes it over the cover boundary!</b> They can't, surely?! Sammy stays deep in the crease and carves this overpitched ball outside off. Bravo has completely lost his length there and this partnership has now given an almighty scare to Quetta. Wow."
"length at off stump, leans in and flicks to deep midwicket"
<b>a misfield.</b> Woeful from Tanvir. Length ball slanting in at leg stump. Looks to flick and gets it off the back leg. Trickles slowly to the fielder who takes his eyes off it and lets it pass
full and angled in at leg stump. Flicked to deep square's left
"<b>a sprint, a dive, a tumble</b> and at the end of it all, Pollard picks up four after being completely deceived by the bowler. There is no justice sometimes. Length ball outside off, wants to drive through the line but ends up chipping it to Shehzad's left at long-off with one hand. Brilliant effort there but he's beaten by his own momentum"
"<b>proper connection this time!</b> Low full toss outside off, Pollard stands tall and just opens the face to get this drive to Shehzad's left at long-off. No chance this time, this is whistling past him"
"<b>this is extremely ordinary cricket</b> from Quetta. Length ball outside off, defended to short third man who misfields and allows a run. Then puts in a wild throw that gives them another run in the leg side. From there - another throw. This ends up at sweeper cover and they have half a chance to take three. They don't. Sarfraz asking his fielders to calm down."
"length outside off, mistimed punch to long-off"

"<b>skids under the bat!</b> Slower ball, short of a length and skids through at knee height past off stump! He was looking to hit that at waist height"
"<b>huuuuuuuuge!</b> Oh Bravo, what have you done! Two top deliveries followed by an overpitched ball on leg stump. Sammy doesn't miss out on those. Pumps it 93 metres in the direction of long-on"
"<b>beats him on the inside edge.</b> Superb. Digs another slower ball into the pitch, short of a length, and that length is virtually unhittable. Cuts in past the pull shot and rises over middle stump"
"<b>fool me twice!</b> Sammy knows what's coming this time! A slower ball at a length and he waits for it in the crease. Waits and waits and waits and pummels this, all core strength, off the back foot and over long-on. Superb. Just superb."
"low full toss on leg stump, sliced off the toe-end to extra cover"
length and in at leg stump. Gets the front leg out of the way and heaves it to deep square off the inside half
"<b>sends him over midwicket!</b> Length ball, not troubling Pollard with that pace. On his pads, swivels and sends it flying. His first six of the night"
"<B>the top of middle stump!</b> Oh Watson, you beauty! Sheepish grin, but has he done it for his team? Length ball on middle. Pollard loses his shape completely as he looks to slog this and his stumps are damaged"
"<b>they've got Sammy!</b> A length ball outside off, there to be hit, but Wahab is beaten on the swish. Sarfraz gather and underarms it onto the stumps as Sammy looks to plonk his bat in. He's well short. Viv Richards overjoyed on the touchline"
"<b>mistimed</b> and to long-off's left! That is it, surely? Short of a length outside off, slices it to that fielder's left. The throw comes back, and Sarfraz asks his local crowd to clap for his team. They've held on"
"full at off stump, mistimed drive to long-on"
