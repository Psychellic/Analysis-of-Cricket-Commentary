"fullish, a bit of inswing towards a fourth-stump line, punched crisply into the covers"
"short on off stump, pulled high in the air, and down the throat of deep square leg, moving to his right. No wicket, of course"
"shortish, a bit of late inswing to cramp Shaw and he pulls along the ground to deep square leg"
"ooh, beauty. Swing from over the wicket, across the left-hander, and excellent carry. Hits a length that catches Dhawan half-forward in defence, and the ball zips past his outside edge"
"short again, gets up to shoulder height outside off, slapped into the cover point region"
"back of a length close to off stump, stays leg-side of the ball and punches to the right of backward point"
"back of a length, not too much width, leans back and chops it to backward point"
"length ball angling across towards off stump, gets forward for a checked drive to short cover"
"only a touch short now, on off stump or thereabouts, but it's short enough for Shaw, who picks the length early and plays the front-foot pull, wide of mid-on"
"excellent response, the line goes a bit wider and the length fuller but well short of a driving length, especially on this bouncy surface. Shaw has been eager to drive on the up today, but he stays a little leg-side of the ball at all times, and early in his innings that can make him play inside the line, especially when the ball is angling away from him. He does so here, and gets a thin edge through to de Kock"
"length ball on middle and leg, clipped to square leg"
"length ball, a tiny bit of movement back in towards off stump. Presses forward and pushes into the covers with soft hands"
"length ball angling in towards off stump, gets on the front foot for a push to mid-off"
"length ball close to off stump, lets it come and defends towards point"
"lovely shot. Iyer really doesn't need too much room to cut, and it doesn't need to be too short either. Cuts off the front foot, and Hardik moves quickly to his right, anticipating well, to cut it off"
"fuller, too much width, and Iyer gets on the front foot to loft this over the covers"
"a touch short outside off, a bit of inward movement to cramp Iyer on the cut. Chops it down into the ground behind him, and de Kock, diving right, gets a hand on it - glove off - but can't stop it completey"
"length ball outside off, looks for the flat-bat cover drive but plays too early, hits it back towards the bowler instead"
"back of a length on off stump, stays leg-side of the ball to dab gently towards point"
"shot! Looks for the wide yorker, and he doesn't execute it too badly, but Iyer is leaning back, waiting for it, and he opens his bat face to steer it to the right of short third man. He's looking in great touch today"
"back of a length on off stump, opens his bat face for the dabbed single to backward point"
"length ball, a bit of swing back in towards middle stump. Stays leg-side of the ball to dab towards point"
"full, lots of room outside off, and Iyer frees his arms to play another super shot, a lofted drive hit so crisply over mid-off that it carries all the way"
"fullish on off stump, and Iyer's cameo ends courtesy an excellent catch from Kieron Pollard at extra-cover. Looks for another lofted drive, but doesn't get the elevation this time, and doesn't get it far enough wide of Pollard. He throws himself to his right, and grabs it one-handed at about shoulder height"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended into the point region"
"shot! Lovely bit of timing, gets a bit of width on this length ball from McClenaghan, and he opens his bat face and pierces a small gap between backward point and cover point"
mistimes a drive to mid-off for a quick single. He got a thick inside edge onto the pad as it rolled to the fielder
"length ball angling away, defended gently into the off side"
tucked away nicely behind square in the leg side for a single
"punches this on the up to extra cover, good line from Bumrah. Draws him forward, there isn't much movement off the deck though"
"cramped for room as he looks to flay this on the up through extra cover, gets a thick inside edge that rolls back towards the stumps"
"goes full and across, Dhawan is half-forward as he pushes this onto his boot, the ball rolls behind the stumps and they scamper a run"
"width and he's belted that through extra cover. Tracer bullet stuff. This was a poor ball, loose first up."
"driven beautifully again, free flow of the bat, down to sweeper cover this time"
uses the width to steer this length delivery to deep point
flayed through to deep point
punches this back of length delivery to deep point
"full and straight on the stumps, squeezes one off a thick inside edge to mid-on"
"good length, coming back in from outside off and strikes him high on the pad"
"good length, nipping back in again but ends up on the pads, and flicked towards square leg"
"good length outside off again, punched towards cover"
"slightly fuller, but not full enough to drive comfortably. Ingram gets on the front foot to drive it, but can only get it off the toe-end, back to the bowler"
"back of a length again, sticking to the channel outside off and not giving batsmen room. Ingram chops it into the offside for a quick single"
"slower ball, dances down the track to meet it on the half-volley and drives fluently through extra cover for a couple. Long-off runs around to field it"
<b>slashed and slashed hard</b> angled across him and he waits and cuts it over a leaping Pollard at point to the boundary
"similar line but he pulled his length back a bit, and Ingram only chops it down on the ground"
"slower ball, angling across on a length, steered to third man"
"yorker on the stumps, driven to mid-off"
"<b>boom</b> too short and Ingram saw it early, rocked back and pulled it high and handsome over deep midwicket"
"goes back to a fuller length angled across, slapped in the cover region for a single"
too short and pulled so powerfully that McClenaghan at deep square leg can't stop it despite being metres away from where the ball ended up. Too short and he went deep in his crease again to swivel and smash it. Hit very hard and McClenaghan moves to his left but can't stop the ball
"quicker outside off, cuts it for a single"
"tossed up on off stump, driven to short cover off the front foot"
"drags it down a bit shorter when trying to go flatter, and Dhawan stays beside the ball and square drives it to deep cover"
"tossed up, he goes deep in his crease to punch to long-on"
"swept, and swept well but there is a deep midwicket so they only get a single"
"throws his bat this one, short and wide outside off and it takes the toe end of the bat to run down fine to third man for a boundary. Perhaps not in control of it exactly, but that was a poor ball"
"<b>just short of Yuvraj at midwicket</b> tailing into him, and he chips it in the air, but it's dipping on Yuvraj who can't reach it despite diving forward"
"<b>brilliant stop by Pollard at long-on</b> too short again outside off, he goes back and pulls it fiercely to long-on. Pollard runs to his right, dives and picks up the ball"
"<b>shot</b> up on his toes and slashes it over third man. Too short again and outside off, Dhawan read the length early and was in position to execute the shot perfectly"
"fuller length finally and on the stumps, patted down and looking for the quick single, but there isn't one"
"better length again and a straighter line, Dhawan nudges it back towards the bowler"
"angles it wide across Ingram, but what saved it from being a wide was it pitched inside the tramline"
<b>drilled</b> This was fullish on off and he smashed it back past the bowler and into the straight boundary
""
"a bit too short and a bit of room outside off and Ingram is lethal there. Goes on the back foot and cuts it powerfully, and into the point fence"
"and that one is slapped past extra cover, once again off the back foot. No turn for Krunal and he can just smash it through the line"
pushed to long-on
"yorker on the fourth stump, he goes deep and tries to swipe it, but gets the under-edge to mid-on"
"good length on middle and moving a touch away, punched to deep cover"
<b>peachy</b> fulishl outside off and perhaps Dhawan has faced Bumrah enough in the nets to confidently take a stride out and stroke it through extra cover
"fuller length, pushed to the bowler's right for a quick single"
"that was a quick one, ends up as a full toss outside off but at 144 kph. Ingram beaten for pace, trying to force it through the offside"
"<b>overthrow</b> goes for the yorker, ends up as a low full toss, punched forcefully to extra cover. They are not seriously thinking of the single but the fielder has a shy at the stumps, and no one's backing up, so they get a run"
"good length outside off at 120 kph, he waits for it to cut it fine, but it's too fine, and the keeper is able to stop it on the bounce"
"<b>what a shot</b> moves across his stumps and knew that short fine leg was up, so he paddle-scooped it over the man and into the fence"
"good length on the stumps, he goes deep in his crease and slaps it from in front of the stumps to deep extra cover"
"<b>beautiful</b> angled across him, pitches on off and moving away, and he waits for it and glides it past backward point. Such great timing on that, no fielder had a chance of stopping it"
"too short and he rocks back to pull, but there is a deep square leg"
"<b>picks out Hardik at deep midwicket</b> picked it up from wide of off stump and wanted to send it several rows back, but there's no pace on the ball and he ends up getting height but not the distance. Hardik back-pedals and takes it, and is careful to not step over the boundary rope"
"ooh beaten outside off. on a length and it holds its line, he stayed inside the line and had a poke at it"
"<b>popped up but landed safe in front of mid-on</b> strange shot by Pant, wanted to sweep it, but too early into it. Gets it looping off the end of the bat and it lands in front of mid-on"
punched to cover
"good length angling into him, patted back to the bowler"
"back of a length on off, and he gets off the mark with a punch to deep point"
"short outside off, but not too wide. Dhawan cuts it to deep point"
"good length on leg stump, flicked off his pads to square leg"
"<b>incredible shot</b> walking across his stumps and he picks it up from his pads even as he's falling over, to flick it to fine leg. Lands about 5 cms away from the ropes, so it's only a four"
"reverse sweep to deep point. Length ball on leg stump, he might have been better off trying to go over the legside, but he had decided to reverse hit it"
"stump to stump line on a good length, patted to the bowler's right but they can't take the quick single"
"bouncer, rose up sharply, and takes his glove to go over the keeper's head for four. He was trying to hook it, but it bounced surprisingly high"
<b>smashed</b> too short and he read the length quickly. This one didn't bounce as much and he could rock back to pull it over square leg
"<b>picks out deep midwicket</b> went for the flat-batted pull, but there wasn't much pace on it, the off-cutter from Hardik and he doesn't get the distance on it. Straight to Suryakumar at deep midwicket. Dhawan knew he had to get on with it, hence the shot, but he's gone now."
"greets him with a bouncer, but it slides a long way down the leg side, past the attempted pull"
"shortish, extra bounce and the inward angle cramp him for room as he goes onto the back foot. Tries to hurriedly work it into the leg side but the ball climbs and hits him on the thigh pad"
"back of a length, angling into leg stump. Looks to flick and only manages a bit of thigh pad into the leg side. Too much bounce for a serious lbw appeal"
"bang, another biggie over square leg. I don't know why they're trying to test him with the short ball. Angling in from round the wicket, gets up to around chest height, and he's on the front foot to hoick it around powerfully"
"length ball now, on off stump, and Pant clears his front leg a little to flat-bat this over wide mid-off. Big backlift, big follow-through"
"short again, but this time it's outside off, on around a fifth-stump line. This might be deliberate from Hardik, to try and get him to miscue the pull. Pant goes for it, uses his bottom hand to control it as much as possible while meeting it at shoulder height and dragging it from outside off stump. Still makes a good enough connection for it to carry all the way over the midwicket boundary"
"Shot. Short, on leg stump or thereabouts, and he makes room to slap it away to the right of sweper cover"
"short, angling across into a fifth-stump line, pulled to wide long-on"
"full-toss, around thigh-high, angling away from off stump, and Pant makes a bit of extra room to swat this away over wide mid-off"
"low full-toss on off stump, takes the bottom hand off the handle to whip this round to deep square leg"
"typical McClenaghan wicket. Bouncer, hits the pitch hard and gets the ball up above the right shoulder of the batsman. He's working against that height and the angle away from him, and all he manages is a top edge that balloons high before settling in Quinton de Kock's gloves"
"bangs it in again, gets it up near the front shoulder at high pace, and Pant somehow swivels and gets enough bat on this hook to beat fine leg haring to his left. Not the most in-control shot, but hugely effective - kind of like this innings"
"super shot. Back of a length, angling away from off stump, gives him just enough width to slash it away over backward point and easily beat third man to his left"
"gone, well bowled. Hammers the pitch with this bouncer, and despite the angle he usually creates, exaggeratedly away from the left-hander, he manages to cramp Axar. Leans back to try and ramp it but the lack of room to free his arms means not enough power, and he hits it straight to the fielder at third man"
"what. A. Shot. Fullish, on middle and leg, and Pant sits back in his crease, opens up his front hip, and just flicks this, effortlessly, over the backward square leg boundary"
"fullish, angling away from off stump. Mid-off was up, and perhaps that was the direction he should have been aiming. Goes for the big slog over midwicket, though, and he loses his shape and doesn't connect"
"back of a length, at the hip, and that's another stunning shot to bring up fifty. He doesn't have a lot of room to free his arms, so he manufactures a short-arm jab, with his hip tucked in at the moment of contact, and sends the ball flying to the backward square leg boundary"
"full on middle and leg, clipped towards deep midwicket and he retains the strike, though he thought of a second, turning momentarily at the non-striker's end"
"full slower ball, wide of off stump. Reaches out for a flat-bat drive to long-off. Lack of pace meant he couldn't go through the covers or squarer, smart use of the slower one"
"in the blockhole, angling into off stump, driven to long-off"
"another slower ball, extremely slow and short outside off. Waits, waits some more, and swats it down the ground to long-on. Takes its time reaching the fielder, and they can hurry through for a second"
"short, gets up to chest height while angling in from round the wicket, and Pant picks the length so early and swivels to absolutely pulverise it over backward square leg"
"looks to go back to that slower ball wide of off stump, full, but bowls it too wide"
"bottom hand comes off the handle, but one hand will do for Pant in this form. This is a back-of-the-hand slower one, short of a good length, outside off, and he frees his arms so much that only his top hand remains on the handle, and swings cleanly with that one fully outstretched arm to send this soaring waaaay over wide long-on"
"shortish, fourth-stump line, opens up at the hips to make a bit more room and slap it to the cover point boundary. It feels like the fielders have disappeared altogether"
"and he does his job perfectly. Short, rising ball in the corridor, and he jumps to ride the bounce and carve it to third man for a single"
"wham. He's already hit him for one flicked six, and this time he whips this back-of-a-length ball from around an off-stump line and sends it over his favourite backward square leg boundary"
"wow. Slower ball, angling into leg stump. Pant looks for the reverse-swat, with both third man and backward point inside the circle, but he's undone by lack of pace, and only manages a leg bye into the point region"
"what a shot, Rahul Tewatia! Why did Delhi pick him over Mishra and Lamichhane? Perhaps this is why. Back of a length outside off, and he takes a big step back and across - before the bowler has released - and gets down on one knee to slog-sweep over the midwicket boundary"
"in the blockhole on off stump, jabbed down to long-on"
"another well-executed yorker, on middle stump, and all Pant can do is stab it back to the bowler with a straight bat. Dives left in his follow-through to stop it, can't quite keep it within his reach, and they sneak a single, but the bigger issue is Bumrah, who looks to be in a bit of pain, clutching his left chest/shoulder area. I hope this isn't anything serious. He's back on his feet, and the physio has a hand on his back as he trudges off the field"
"good length angling across gently, Rohit pushes forward to pat it towards mid-off and takes the quick single"
strays on the pads and tickled to deep midwicket off an almost yorker length
"ooh, play and a miss. Angling across him and going away, Rohit goes for the drive, but it rushes past his outside edge"
"similar ball, angling across with the length pulled back a tad. Rohit lets it go through"
too full and Rohit leans into his push to beat mid-off. Rabada there tumbled but couldn't stop it
"full outside off and Rohit drives fluently by opening the face of the bat, but tidy work from Axar at point, intercepting to his left"
"length ball outside off, drives at it with feet static, gets a thickish inside edge that rolls towards forward short leg"
"good length, but a bit too straight and Rohit works this in front of square"
"good tumbling stop by Shreyas Iyer at midwicket. too full and clipped nicely by de Kock, but Iyer ensures it's only a single"
"length ball on the fifth stump line, Rohit went for the drive again, but didn't move his feet. Gets the under-edge back to the bowler"
"<b>outside edge goes for four</b> would you believe it, the ball after slip has gone, Rohit drives away from his body and gets a thick outside edge that goes for four"
"back of a length outside off, and Rohit pushes it to backward point"
"strays on the pads and he picks it up nicely to flick it, but there is a man at deep square leg and he has hit it straight to him. That was there to be hit anywhere, but he'll get only a single and he knows it, and is disappointed at his placement"
on the pads again and worked to deep square leg off the front foot
<b>gets the placement right this time</b> another half-volley angled into his pads and he smacks it between midwicket and mid-on
"<b>walloped</b> too short and he pulls off the front foot, smashing it several rows into the midwicket stands"
"and those two shots have forced the error from Boult - he bowls a full toss on the pads, and it's easy picking for de Kock, who effortlessly flicks it past short fine leg for a boundary"
"fullish on the stumps, flicked to deep square leg to retain strike"
walked across his stump and wanted to paddle-pull it over short fine leg but only gets a thigh pad to square leg
"<b>didn't get the timing quite right but got the placement spot on</b> slower ball but strays on the pads and Rohit thought he'll tickle it fine. But a bit early into the shot, so ends up hitting in the air, but enough on it to fall over short fine leg and run away to the boundary"
"<b>caught by Tewatia at deep square leg</b> Sharma calling Sharma. Another slower ball, better radar then. On off and cutting in, Rohit went down to slog sweep but got a top edge. Tewatia was circling under it and mis-judged it almost, but in the end half-dived forward and held on. Big wicket."
"back of a length outside off, he goes to slash it and doesn't connect"
"too full, driven but off the toe-end to mid-off"
"full again and driven more fluently that time, but still doesn't get the placement and mid-off fields"
"back of a length on off, tries to swat it with a horizontal bat but ends up under-edging back to the bowler's left"
"too quick for Quinton, at 146 kph. Length ball on middle and leg, he was looking to smash it over midwicket. It thuds into pad and rolls towards gully"
"good length on the stumps, pushed off the front foot to mid-off and they take a quick single. That was 148 kph"
whoa that's a 150.6 kph yorker. Quinton does well to get the bat down and keep it out
"back of a length, coming in from outside off. That is 150.9 kph - incredible. Flicked to fine leg"
"slower ball at 127.8 kph (that's normal pace for many). De Kock pats it in front of him, and thinks about the quick single but there is none"
"<b>direct hit from Shreyas Iyer at mid-off</b> and Suryakumar is comfortably short. Brilliant moment in the field from the DC captain, who has been very good patrolling mid-off through this innings. He pushed it hard and straight to Iyer, and set off, but Iyer was onto it and had enough time to line up the stumps and let fly"
"bouncer and de Kock is quickly inside the line to hook it from over his head. Gets it nicely and sends it fine, to the boundary"
"in the slot and dismissed. Too full, he clears his front leg a bit and has a free swing of the arms to lift it over the in-field and into the midwicket boundary"
backs away but Ishant keeps it yorker length just outside off and de Kock can't connect with the attempted square drive
"<b>he's holed out to fine leg</b> Quinton was looking like he would 'Pant' his way through this innings, but he hoicks a back of length delivery on leg stump straight to Boult, who holds a smart catch over his head. Mumbai are crumbling"
"shimmies forward to block this towards mid-on and they decide to take the risky single. No direct hit this time, and Pollard was quick in getting across too"
"146 kph yorker, Pollard does well to dig it out to mid-on"
"fullish at 147.5 kph, driven to mid-off"
"almost yorker length but the slower ball at 123 kph and Pollard is early into his push, mis-times it to mid-off. No pace on the ball allows a quick single"
"just short of yorker length on the stumps, clipped to deep square leg off his toes"
"back of a length, gets it to bounce from outside off to just below Pollard's chest, who dabs it down on the onside and they run a quick single. 145 kph"
"bluffed him by bringing in slip, and he digs this in back of a length to tuck him up. Yuvraj rises up and defends it back slightly awkwardly"
"<b>unreal power by Pollard</b> tossed up around off and he merely seemd to push it, but that rocketed away to the long-off fence"
pushes at this length ball and it takes the inside edge to square leg
"angled into him, fullish, he comes on the front foot and defends"
"inside edged onto pad. dips nicely on Yuvraj who was coming forward to defend, and takes the inside edge onto pad"
"he stays back to this one, and pushes it uppishly to the bowler's left to take a single to long-on"
"<b>that one is travelling out of here</b> takes a big stride and just smacks it straight and true. Pollard is able to clear the ropes with almost no follow through, this one was a full swing of the bat. And it's headed waaaay over the straight boundary, clears the sightscreen too"
"starts with a bouncer that Yuvraj ducks under, but it's too far above his head and will be a wide"
"back of a length outside off, he mistimes his pull to wide long-on"
"clobbered, but there is a long-on who takes it on one-bounce. Too full and he brings out the powerful drive again"
"beaten by the slower ball. Back of a length and he went for the pull, but too early on it and it goes through to the keeper outside off"
"backs away to give himself room but smart by Keemo, who pushes it wide of off stump. Yuvraj can't reach that, and it's another dot ball"
"nicely timed. This time Yuvraj stays still, and cuts this past backward point to the boundary"
"cuts it powerfully again, but this time it's more square and deep point runs to his left to field"
"<b>through Shikhar Dhawan's hands at short fine leg</b> bowled into the pads from around the wicket, and he swung it towards short fine. Dhawan was there but lets it through"
"more luck for Yuvraj, top-edges this intended swipe across the line but it loops past the bowler and lands safe"
"he's showing he can pull off the delicate shots too. strays on the pads and he picks it off with finesse, getting the timing right and sending it screaming to the fine leg fence"
pushes at this outside off and Axar gets it to turn enough to take the outside edge. Dhawan runs in pursuit and pulls it in for just a single
"<b>wham</b> too short and too wide outside off, Yuvraj stands still and leathers it over point for a six"
"this is bad bowling, on the pads and Yuvraj sweeps it square. All he had to do was beat one fielder in the circle which he does"
"back of a length, angling into middle stump, tucked away through square leg"
"fullish and wide outside off, it's there in the slot for Yuvraj's freed-arms drive through cover point, but he fails to make contact"
"fuller, a little closer to off stump, and that's a super shot, just a front-foot punch with aborted follow-through to clear the right hand of the leaping fielder at mid-off"
"back of a length outside off, opens his bat face and picks up a single to third man"
"gone, excellent bit of deception. Fullish, angling in towards off stump, and Pollard doesn't pick the knuckle-ball. Drives at it, plays too early, checks his shot, and all he achieves is to balloon a simple catch to Tewatia at sweeper cover"
"full on the pads, Yuvraj plays a little early, looking to flick, ends up playing it back to the bowler"
"flat length ball on off stump, driven to mid-off"
"another batsman falls to a ball that stops on him. Length ball, angling in towards off stump, holds on the pitch and bounces extra, and Pandya checks his drive and pops back the simplest of return catches, at waist height"
"a bit of flight, drops onto a nice length on off stump. Drives without really getting fully forward, the ball rolls away through midwicket off the inner half of the bat"
"floated across towards off stump, looks for the slog-sweep but can only drag it along the floor through square leg"
"length ball, fired across wide of off stump, slapped to deep cover"
"down the track, doesn't quite reach the pitch of this off-stump ball, swipes across the line and drags it along the floor through midwicket"
"slower ball on off stump, stays back and defends it back to the bowler"
"slower bouncer outside leg, swivels too early to hook and only gets glove on it. Bounces down gently towards the keeper"
"another slower bouncer, angled across and gets up to chest height on off stump. Swivels too early again, misses, and is dealt a painful blow to the chest"
"back of a length on middle stump, tucked away to long leg"
"another slower ball, but he overpitches this time, on off stump, and Krunal holds his shape, keeps his front leg out of the way, and drives firmly between umpire and non-striker"
"slower short ball outside leg, Krunal misses the attempted hook"
"another slower short ball, and this time it's Krunal's turn to get through a pull too early. The ball hits him smack on the stomach"
"and that's an extraordinary shot. Short-of-good-length delivery, angling across him on this bouncy pitch, and he clears his front leg and shovels it - something between a drive and a pull - over mid-on and gets it to carry all the way"
"responds with the wide yorker and Krunal fails to put bat on it, reaching out to try and slash it away"
"slower ball, back of a length and angling away from off stump. Not too much room for the cut, and he slashes and misses"
"overpitched outside off, and Krunal just stands where he is and slap-drives it, leaving deep point rooted to the ball while the ball flashes to the boundary to his left"
"another misdirected wide yorker, ends up as a low full-toss wide of off stump, and Krunal does really well to reach out and slash it away, deliberately slicing underneath the ball, to beat short third man diving to his left"
"short ball on off stump, pulled to the right of deep square leg"
"full-toss on the pads, and he whips it away gratefully to the backward square leg boundary"
"slower ball, full and wide of off, swiped along the ground to long-on"
"goes for the wide yorker, and that's a borderline wide call, the ball hovering right over the tramline. Yuvraj leaves it alone"
"yorker now, much closer to off stump. Jams his bat down on it and squeezes it a few yards away square on the off side"
"thigh-high full-toss on off stump, and Krunal clubs it back fiercely, leaving the bowler on his backside and the umpire ducking"
"good yorker on a fifth-stump line, sneaks it under Krunal's bat as he attempts to jab it through the off side"
"got him, ends a threatening cameo with the slower ball. It's fairly full and angling into middle stump. Krunal has to make all the power himself, and he clears his front leg and slogs it away but can't clear the man at deep midwicket"
"floated up across the left-hander, lands outside off. Swiped down to long-on"
"back of a length, angling into leg stump, clipped away to wide long-on"
"flat length ball speared across Yuvraj, wide of off stump. It allows Yuvraj  to free his arms, and he launches it high and straight, back over the bowler's head and off the middle of his bat"
"what happened here. Stops on the pitch, maybe. Shortish, and he's too early into the pull. Skews it high but into no-man's land as long-on and deep midwicket try to sprint forward to reach it before it bounces"
"shortish, angling into the stumps, pulled to deep midwicket"
"bam. Axar sends down a long-hop, and Yuvraj swivels and deposits it high over the square leg boundary"
"low full-toss wide of off, stabbed away to deep point"
"that's seriously quick, a misdirected yorker angling down leg. Pant, moving to his right, fumbles after Yuvraj misses his flick, and they sneak a bye"
"serious pace again, and Rabada might just have sent back Mumbai's last recognised batsman. Fullish, but not on a driving length, in the corridor, and Cutting doesn't have any time to get a proper stride in to drive. Ends up playing away from his body, as a result, with an angled bat, and the ball zips past the edge or kisses it through to Pant. The umpire gives Cutting out, but he seems unsure whether he edged it or not. Consults with Yuvraj and reviews, but UltraEdge shows a little spike as the ball goes past his edge, and he'll have to walk back"
"awkward bounce from a good length, and McClenaghan, doubling up while looking to work it leg-side, is hit on the back thigh"
"full-toss outside off, jabbed down the ground towards long-on, off the inside half of the bat"
"once again, he sends one ballooning into a vacant space. Rabada's bouncer gets up above his back shoulder. and he miscues the attempted pull high in the air, without any power, but midwicket is back on the boundary"
"shot. Premeditates, walks across his stumps, and gets a full-toss angling into him. Uses the angle to help it away to the left of short fine leg"
"full, angling into off stump, whips it away to long leg and refuses the single. Why?!?!?! McClenaghan's just hit a cleverly executed boundary, and he must have faced Boult a far bit in the nets?"
"back of a length, angling into off and middle, blocked back to the bowler"
"slog, edge, boundary, fifty. This is a strange, stop-start innings, lacking fluency for most part, but he's still there, and he slogs at this length ball outside off and gets a thick edge that races away to the right of short third man"
"shortish, close to off stump, clears his front leg and clubs this down to long-on. Takes the single this time"
"excellent yorker, aimed right at the feet of the batsman and he can't connect with his flick. Hit on the pads but it's angling down leg, so no appeal"
"full, lots of width, and McClenaghan carves it away in the air, out of reach of the leaping cover fielder"
"looks for the yorker, ends up angling it down leg side. Yuvraj can't connect with the flick"
"another attempted yorker, looking to deny Yuvraj room, another wide down the leg side"
"that's that, I guess. Full on leg stump, Yuvraj flicks it, and picks out the man at deep midwicket. It's been a struggle for Yuvraj, punctuated by flashes of the old strokeplay, and he walks off with a fighting fifty to his name"
"back of a length close to off stump, punched to the right of deep point"
"slower yorker, looks to make room and play through the covers but the angle cancels out that room. Blocked back to the bowler"
"full on off stump and he makes room to drive this over extra-cover. Ingram jumps up, right arm outstretched, and gets a fingertip to the ball, so I guess that counts as a half-chance"
"slower ball, full and angling into the batsman as he backs away, looking to make room. Lofted down to long-on, on the bounce"
"shortish, close to off stump, pulled along the ground to deep square leg"
flat length ball outside off. Looks for the slog-sweep and only manages an inside-edge into his pad
"whoops. A bit more flight outside off and McClenaghan swings too early, looking to slog with the turn. The ball slides past his bat and he drags his back foot out of the crease briefly, just long enough for Pant to knock off the bails"
