forward and tapped to short cover
"angled into the front pad from round the wicket, good areas"
"leg-sided, clipped with the angle out to deep midwicket"

"on the toes, Warner looks urgent all of a sudden, another flipped run to the leg side"
"nothing wrong with that delivery, a touch of movement into the left-hander, but Warner met it right under the eyeline and tapped an instant single into the covers"
"over the wicket, angled across the bows. Solid block on the front foot"
angled defence into the cordon
"on the pads, worked square, England haven't looked like troubling either man so far ..."

"defended on a tighter line, and another stolen single to a decent delivery"
"banged in short and wide. Aggression, and frustration, from Anderson"
"better from Broad, his best of the morning. Seamed away late and genuinely beat the edge"

"a bit of movement away from the left-hander, but all too easily left on length"
"fired in short, Warner ducks"

"full again, blocked down the track"

whittled to the leg side
"short and wide, attempted cut, but can't connect properly"
"short and wide again, not the ideal line and length..."

"gets too straight, angled into the pads short of a length, clipped to long leg"
"and Warner finds one of them, the straighter one, as he drives on the front foot"

"starts full outside off, 81mph/130kph, driven back towards Curran who gets his left hand to it"
"bustles in, full, angled into the pads but Bancroft picks out midwicket with his flick"

"drops this one in short, Warner rolls his wrists and helps it to deep square leg"
"that's his best short of the morning, on the back foot and punches sweetly through the covers as Curran drops short outside off. Does Anderson manage to flick it back? It's a fine effort, sliding with the flick back, and he gets the benefit of the doubt from the third umpire"

"back of a length at off stump, worked to midwicket"
"outside off, left alone"
he's right across outside off and pushes a back-of-a-length ball to cover

driven firmly to mid-off
"outside off, through to the keeper"

"short again, another duck, easily negotiated this time"
"short, leg-sided, that's just terrible. Warner hops into line and shovels a pull round the corner"

"on the back foot, pushed into the covers"
"into the covers again, squared up a touch on the back foot"
"big appeal and up goes the finger! Bancroft knows a second opinion is futile. This was angled in, beat the inside edge, thumped the back pad, plumb in front of middle, to end a curiously durable innings from a man who never looked comfortable"

"speared into the toes, but well blocked with a soft-shoe shuffle"
guided into the covers with a waft of the bat

"just inside the tram-lines, as the boos ring out around the crowd. Wide and wider"
"straighter this time, Warner meets it with a firm drive but short cover snaffles the intercept"

"drilled hard back at Broad, from a full length, and that's a good tumbling stop from Broad, who almost pulls off a deflection onto the non-striker's stumps"

"crashed hard to pojnt once again, but on the bounce this time"

"good shape from over the wicket, angled past the left-hander's edge"
"short, and hoisted to backward square, to get Warner back on strike once more ..."
"on the back foot, a cramped punch to point. The crowd oohs ..."
"round the wicket, a baseball-style bunt into the leg side. Just holding his bat in the line of the ball to deflect towards a gap"
"gone! Warner has utterly muffed the moment! A good length delivery, spooned off a top-edge to mid-on ...  but it's a <B>no-ball!</B> Oh, this is just spectacular. Warner was halfway off, Curran was celebrating his maiden Test wicket, but the TV replay revealed his heel had crossed the line. It's a glorious Boxing Day farce!"
"flicked off the hip, and <B>there it is!</B> Off  comes the helmet, out comes the trademark leap of joy, and there's some extra meaning in that moment. What an incredible couple of moments of Test cricket!"

clipped to leg
tossed up outside off stump and tapped through point
"looped onto a good length, Marsh looking to be aggressive"

"worked into the leg side once again, nothing to work with there"
pushed to the off side
"a big appeal from Broad and<strong> England have reviewed!</strong> Broad reckons it's plumb, but that's rarely a fair indication. Certainly very full, and if there's no inside edge this is tight... sure enough, it is pad first. Hang tight... and<strong> it is out!</strong> Hitting the top of off, and that's a credit to the revised line of attack, bringing the stumps into play. Shock horror, it's been England's morning..."
"that's a violent welcome back to the attack! Short and wide, a bit of a loosener, and pummelled through wide mid-on!"

"back of a length, tight line, edged along the ground to the first of those two gullies"

"lined up outside off, and left well alone"
"<B>another drag-on! </B>Paine swivels into a pull, and pays the price as the ball stays a touch low, flicks off the toe and cannons into the base of his leg stump! Signs of the wicket's two-paced nature, maybe? But that is Anderson's 520th Test wicket, which puts him clear of the former world record-holder Courtney Walsh"
"outside off, left alone"
"outside off, lifting off the deck, no stroke offered"
"<B>edged and through the slips!</B> A hint of reverse as Bird stabs a tentative poke outside off, the ball fizzed wide of Bairstow's outstretched glove but died short of first slip!"

"on the toes, flicked out to deep midwicket"

"big appeal and up goes the finger! Bird is walking immediately, but Cummins has called for the <B>review</B>, and why not, seeing as they've got a spare. No bat involved though, so this is surely dead. Wicket to wicket, recalibrating the line from off to middle, and the tailender had no answer"
"good wicket-to-wicket approach, fenced into the covers with a high elbow"
blocked back down the pitch
"attacking the top of off, poked into the covers"

"edged, taken low down at slip! Nicely done by Broad, pushing full outside off, Cummins goes for the drive, the edge reaches Cook very low. And now the umpires are checking if it's carried. The soft signal is out. Cummins is almost off the ground. Safely into the hands. Well taken by Cook. That will be a quick confirmation by the third umpire."
"full outside off, slides off a thickish outside edge towards gully"

"stretching forward, very good line and length, Stoneman stretches in defence"
"aggression from Stoneman and he's paid the price! Down the wicket, looking to hit against the spin, but he chips a fast leading edge high to Lyon's right, who sticks out a mitt and plucks a blinder!

"another appeal for a catch behind as Broad flicks at a short-of-a-length delivery down the leg side...they consider the review, but decline"

"on the pads from round the wicket, clipped down to long leg"
"short, down the leg side, an easier one to get inside the line of"

"back to the short stuff, he jumps right across outside off and knocks into space on the off side"
"round the wicket, full at off stump, defended"
"what a beauty! Drives on the up outside off, sends it whistling to the cover boundary. A free swing of the arms. Into the 190s"

chipped into the leg side
"a crashing round-house pull, and he's utterly nailed it through square leg for a hugely gutsy fifty! He's worn the short stuff, and given it back in spades"

"down the leg side, good heat on that short ball"
another bouncer from round the wicket. Broad has a flap but can't make contact
"slashed high and hard into the deep ... Khawaja hurtles round to scoop a tremendous take, low to the ground. The umpires are conferring to make sure it carried... but the soft signal is out, so let's see ... nope, <B>that has burst through his hands on impact</b>, so Broad will bat on! Or will he? They are taking an age to overturn it, and<B> the upshot is that the TV replay is inconclusive!</B> That's a very controversial finish, reminiscent of a Steve Waugh catch off Lara in the Caribbean some years ago - 1998-99, I believe"
