"and there comes the short ball, Lakmal had no clue about it and it's hit his right shoulder. Painful blow. He was caught on the crease, ended up fending it, takes a brush of the glove and pings into the shoulder. He'll get some treatment for that"
"<b>and this time the short ball gets him!</b> Lakmal showed spirit in lasting through the barrage, but a flying catch by Watling behind the stumps sends him on his way. Southee had taken out the slips and only had a short leg, telegraphing the bouncer - or making Lakmal think of a double bluff - but he ends up bowling a mean bumper that homes in on the throat. Lakmal's fends at it with arched back and it flies off the glove/bat handle. The hang time means Watling can go full stretch to his right and pluck out the ball."

"<b>and it goes past second slip to the boundary!</b> It was the plan to have him edging, and it worked too, with Boult bowling across him and taking it away further with the angle. An uncertain jab takes the edge, the ball bounces well in front of the slips but it's a bit away from Southee and awkward bounce, so he can't get hands to it"

This time Taylor didn't get to the pitch of the ball but went for the drive anyway. The turn took his outside edge for the lone slip to hold a smart catch."

"skidder from Dilruwan, the new ball slides on at 91ks, keeps gathering pace off the pitch and pings the pad as the batsman plays back to it. Latham has been given out lbw. But he challenges the on-field out decision. Is this heading down the leg side? Slides in and hits the back pad on the knee-roll in front of leg stump. Impact in line, and ball-tracking reckons it would crash into leg stump. Good call from umpire Gough, and Latham has to go after a resolute 154.

"good length nipping in from outside off. Karunaratne opted to let it go, eventually safe but that was fairly close to off stump in the end"

"<b>no shot offered and given lbw</b> Southee subtly altered his line to bring it closer to off stump and it moved in with the angle to hit him on the knee-roll.

"yorker has hit him flush on the boot. Loud, persistent and almost pleading appeal by Boult not given and immediately Williamson says he'll review. And it's pitched <b>just outside leg stump</b> so the on-field decision stands. Terrific decision by the umpire, that looked out in real-time, but he spotted correctly that it had pitched just outside leg. Terrific ball too."

"slower ball, on a fullish length on off, Dickwella adjusted well to defend it down the pitch"
"back of a length into the batsman, who turns it off his hips into the legside"
"<b>caught by Taylor at first slip</b> Southee had set the field for the bouncer, bowled a full one swinging away. Dilruwan couldn't rein himself in and went for the drive, got a healthy edge and Ross Taylor moved smartly to hold it well away from his body and low down to his right."
<b>beauty</b>. Perfect outswinger that goes perilously close to the bat's edge and close to offstump too. Lakmal was given a short-ball working over in the first innings and was hanging back to that
"double bluff with another very full ball, Lakmal is hanging back again but manages to push it into a gap on the offside. Dickwella refuses the single though. He'll face Boult"

"back of a length outside off and Dickwella punches it, but he's hit it very well again, so while he'll get another boundary, Lakmal will be on strike next over"
"good length going across him, he's hanging back again and jabs it towards point"
"he's keeping it very full to Lakmal so far, keeping him guessing. This was another outswinger on the stumps, Lakmal got his bat down in time to pat it back"
and there is the bouncer. But Lakmal is ready for it and ducks while also taking his head and shoulder out of the way
"short ball again, but down leg and Lakmal kept his eyes on the ball so he knew there was no need to contort his body and he could just be low and still and let the ball sail over"

"tossed up on the stumps, defended off the front foot"
"looped up and drifted across, pitched and spun back sharply, and hit him on the pad. No bat involved and he was playing a shot - trying to fend it down. In any case think it would have been too high. Hold on, there was some glove there! But the ball dropped just short of Taylor at slip"
