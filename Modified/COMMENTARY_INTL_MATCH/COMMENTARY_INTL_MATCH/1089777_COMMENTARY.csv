"some swing first up. First signs of swing this series. Pitches on a good length and moves away, Walton guides a cut to backward point"
"quickly picks the length and hammers that away. Back of a length on middle, Walton whips his wrists through the line to get that behind square. Clever execution"
"that's sloppy all around. A very wide short delivery outside off. Walton lets it go, the keeper fumbles. Should have been a wide too."
"that's terrific. A harrying bouncer but it's excellently directed too. A bouncer on middle and leg, Lewis takes his eyes off the ball and avoids it"
"back of a length on leg, clipped to backward square leg"
"a slower ball, short and slow, slips down leg"
"over short fine leg for four. That's good bowling. Digs this in, short outside off, hustles Walton for pace who pulls but is in no control of it. It skews off the leading edge over fine leg for four"
"good length down leg, nudged to short fine leg for a single"
"lovely line. Good length around off, impeccable. All Walton can do is block"
"just slightly short. Not a bad ball. But Walton likes the pull, hammers it away past midwicket for a couple"
picks the length early again and then swats the medium pace (at best) past midwicket. Cannot drop short with that pace
"full and straight from Karim, pushed to mid-on for a quick run. That's good. Dots only build pressure"
"good finish. Fuller than a good length around off, thick inside edge into the pad."
drifts down leg again for a wide
"fullish line outside off, a thick inside edge past the stumps to short fine leg."
"that's tripe. Digs it in down leg, sits up for Walton to just swivel-pull past short fine leg for four. He'll take that"
"well bowled. Full and straight, defended towards mid-on"
"that isn't good bowling. He hasn't learnt, but gets away with this. Short again outside off, pulled merrily to deep square leg"
"a slower delivery outside off, overpitched half-volley. Lewis accepts the gift with a caress through the covers for four"
"good end. Tight, around off, defended towards cover for a single."
"short down leg, Lewis tries to help that for six over fine leg, but gets only some bat on it. The keeper dives forward to his right but can't get there"
"flat down leg, worked to square leg"
"flat on middle, pushed down to long-on. No turn yet"
worked to wide mid-on for a single
"lovely clean swing. Tossed that up outside off, overpitched and Walton got underneath that. Way over long-off. Why keep it down when you have this repertoire?"
"flat on middle, pushed to long-on for a single"
"flat and straight, driven to long-on. Nice batting from Walton, thinking cricket"
"should have been a run-out. Flat and quick down leg, off the pad towards square leg. Walton calls Lewis through, but he is quick to take off. A bad throws enables Lewis to get back in time. The worst part is yet to come, Shenwari and Lewis, with his momentum, collide."
"and a wicket right after the stoppage. It's full and straight, right in Walton's wheelhouse. Walton is able to get underneath that but isn't able to get much behind it. A mis-timed skew more than anything carries to long-on. Walton done in by the injury to his team-mate. Sucked away his momentum"
"Lewis doesn't care about momentum or his shoulder. Flat outside off, Lewis runs down and lays into a lofted drive which goes out of Warner Park. Clean ball-striking"
"good stop. Short on middle and leg, Lewis swivels into a sweep. Short fine leg dives to his right to save three"
"Samuels carries on from his form last evening. Short and wide outside off, caressed through cover for a couple."
"flat down leg, Lewis misses a sweep and is struck on the pad. Pitched well outside leg"
"full and straight, quick. Lewis wants to hit this over midwicket but it's too full. Improvises a checked flick to long-on"
"too full. Overpitched, straight. Shovelled to midwicket. No turn so it takes the inside half of the bat"
"better length. Quick and straight, Samuels presses forward to defend"
"darted in down leg, off the pad towards point. Still no turn"
"excellent finish from Hamza. Flat on off and middle, Samuels shimmies down but the length isn't there for an attacking shot, so he defends. Just one off the over."
"full and straight, pushed to long-off for one"
"plenty of sixes tonight. Nabi pitches a full delivery from around the wicket. the idea is to cramp him for room but with Samuels' open stance, it's an invitation and he accepts. Slugged over midwicket"
pushed to long-off
"fired in on middle, extremely quick. Defended back"
"strays down leg, nudged towards square leg for a couple. Nicely played, knew what he wanted and execution good too"
"another dart down leg, clipped to long-on for one"
"good length outside off, hit away to the sweeper cover"
full and wide outside off. Samuels swings too hard at that and misses. No footwork.
"on the pads, clipped to deep midwicket"
"nice lines. Around off on a length, pushed towards cover"
the keeping has been sloppy. A wide yorker that goes awry. The full toss doesn't land on the pitch and is well outside off. Shafiqullah gets just boot on that. Five extras
"better. A yorker outside off, no bat on that from Lewis"
"a quick, accurate yorker down leg, off the pad towards fine leg. A big appeal, but plenty of doubt. Enough for the umpire to strike it down"
"flat and straight, driven back to the bowler from the back foot. Bang on target. The perfect line for a legspinner"
"quicker, fuller, the line the same. Hit back again"
"goes through the keeper's legs. Flat down leg, goes past Lewis' sweep. The keeper is blinded but concedes two. Goes down as a drop. Was there glove?"
"flat outside off, pushed to cover. Playing him off the back foot"
"quick down leg, nudged to deep midwicket. Still off the back foot. Gives him a fraction of a second more"
"Samuels doesn't read him either. Quick on leg, looking to read him off the pitch, but is undone by Rashid's quicker pace and flatter trajectory. Hit on the pad"
"and again. Lewis falls in the same fashion again and again and again and again. A short delivery on middle and leg, Lewis picks the length early and looks to clear midwicket but doesn't get enough on it. Straight to deep midwicket who takes a simple reverse-cupped catch on the boundary. Two in two this series, and a countless number of times prior too, the method of dismissal is the same"
"full and straight, a thick inside edge towards square leg"
"a nice yorker on leg, jammed out. Samuels opening up his stance"
"fullish on leg stump, a mis-timed heave finds long-on"
"full and straight again, clipped to midwicket"
"well bowled, a slower ball outside off. Samuels' heave results in a checked drive towards cover"
"fires it at a length, flat on off stump, Samuels pokes it into the of side off the back foot but has too much bat to steal a single"
"googly, tossed up at length outside off stump, goes forwards drops it into the off side tentatively. He didn't pick that"
"on the back foot now, watches this length ball carefully and defends it off the back foot under his eyes"
"good length, off stump, defended back down the pitch"
"good length at middle stump, goes deep in the crease and tickles this through vacant square leg"
"good length, quick at off stump, forward defence"
"overpitched and angled in at leg stump. Samuels looks to make room but he's cramped, can only bunt it back down the pitch"
"full, into the pads, harried flick, straight to deep square leg"
"good bowling. Changes it up with a slower ball, draws Simmons into the shot and makes him check this good length ball. He pushes it back to the bowler"
"outfoxes him again with a slower ball. This is of a similar line and length, draws him forward and forces him to defend at middle stump"
"misses the yorker marginally, but Simmons can only drill this low full toss to long-on off his pads"
"shot. A great over gets relegated to just-about-good. Samuels walks towards the leg side to make room, and he gets a nice overpitched ball at middle stump. Brings the bat down nicely and finishes a beautiful swing to lift this straight over his partner and to long-off's left"
"a googly first up, back of a length and spinning inside from outside off. Steps out and cramps himself, tickles it to short fine leg's left"
"back of a length, off stump, Samuels gets behind the line and punches off the back foot to find sweeper cover"
"a slider pushed back of a length, steps out again but there's rarely any room from Rashid. Simmons tucks this towards deep midwicket who runs in quickly and keeps it to one"
"googly, back of a length at off stump, chopped to backward point"
"he stays in the crease this time. Rashid fires this back of a length, probably expecting him to be down the track. But he has converted it into a long-hop by going deep. From there, all he had to do was place his pull shot, and he got it nicely between the two fielders in the deep on the leg side"
"makes a lot of room, very early. Rashid drops it wide outside off to counter, but he shimmies quickly and recovers to get the square cut. Sweeper runs to his left to clean up"
"full and aimed for middle stump. Samuels is on the move, but the angle cramps him. He jams it back to the bowler"
"this is sensational death bowling. In the blockhole, just outside off stump. There's room for Samuels, but he cannot get bat onto his attempted slice. Beaten,"
"<b>holes out.</b> A length ball on leg stump, enough room, and right in the slot. But he doesn't get under this slog. Gets it off the inside half of the bat and lobs it up gently for long-on who grabs it in front of his throat"
"backs away, slashes hard at this low full toss from middle stump, skews it straight to sweeper cover"
"legcutter, back of a length at off stump. Stays on the back foot, watches it off the pitch and drops it to short third man with soft hands"
"<b>what a spell.</b> Sees Simmons go down leg side, adjusts to throw this wide of him. It's a length ball in the end, but it's enough of a change up to disturb the batsman's plans. He steps out and swings away from his body, and is beaten on the under edge"
"ooohhhh misses out. Length ball, nice and juicy outside off stump. No feet from him as he looks to bludgeon this on the up. But he toe-ends it and the bowler gets across to field it"
"<b>doesn't miss this!</b> Knee-height full toss, just outside off stump. Brathwaite already has his front leg out of the way in his stance. Just stands tall and sways this away, flat and powerfully, wide of long-on. Like a cricket elitist dismissing T20s"
"slower length ball outside off stump, can't time this slog well enough. It's along the floor and straight to long-on"
<b>falls in front of deep square leg.</b> A bouncer that he drags from outside off stump with a top edge. Hands seductively in front of Noor Ali at deep square. He takes the bait and dives forward but it drops short of him. Recovers with some pain on his shoulder and fires a shocking throw halfway down the pitch that Shafiqullah can't get to with a Supermanesque dive. Overthrows.
"<b>superb.</b> Drifts a back-of-the-hand slower ball in outside off, at a yorker length, and beats the batsman's swipe"
"length ball at middle stump, backs away and clubs this on the up, but it's along the floor and slightly to long-on's right"
"on the pads to start, Naib misses a flick and is struck on the pad."
"flat outside off, keeps low, goes underneath Naib's bat. Typical Badree start"
"flat and straight, Naib doesn't mind getting forward to defend"
"quick. Flat on off, hurries Naib for pace, who badly miscues a pull to cover"
"this is pushed through again. Flat and quick outside off, punched to mid-off for a single. Too many dots already in this over"
"sensational over. Flat down leg, Noor Ali misses a flick and it's another dot. So that pushes the asking rate higher"
"just out of reach of brathwaite, running back from mid-on. Fullish outside off, another badly-timed pull makes its way towards long-off. Narine lets Brathwaite try. Just a hand on that from Brathwaite"
"full and wide outside off, hammered to straight long-off. Powerful stroke, but just one. Good field placement"
"a wild swing. Full and wide from around the wicket, just inside the tramline but Naib misses"
"that's far too wide. Full delivery but too wide outside off, it's called."
"a low full toss outside off, punched wide of cover for a couple. Long-off cleans up. Two more"
"another swing and miss. Full and wide, inside the tramline. It seems his stroke is premeditated, looking to go over mid-on, but a better shot would be to go over cover"
"good end, breaks the unpredictability by executing a straight yorker. Chipped to mid-on"
"overpitched on leg, skewed to long-on for a run"
excellent bowling. Sees Noor Ali coming so fires this down leg. Noor Ali gets pad on it somehow
"fullish outside off, a wild mow over cover results in a thick inside edge past the stumps for a run"
"quick, accurate, straight, Punched to mid-off"
"there is the first boundary of the innings. Shortish delivery outside off, Gulbadin gets hold of this and sends it way over long-on. Just what Afghanistan need"
"and comes back with the wicket. Great bowling. Quick and straight, on leg. Gulbadin plays around the ball, gets there late and doesn't make contact. All requisites for a wicket against Badree."
"much better from Noor Ali. Good choice of stroke. Back of a length on middle and leg, sits up for Noor Ali to spank over point. No one there."
"another one falls. A hard length. Boundary and wicket. Afghanistan handicapping themselves. Back of a length on leg, Noor Ali is far too late on his pull and the ball lobs to short fine leg. A simple catch. Afghanistan batsmen look so hurried for pace, not just tonight but yesterday too. A sign of the step-up in quality they are facing"
"two in two. Afghanistan falling away. Back of a length on off, Samiullah tries to get one to third man but the ball bounces extra and takes a thin edge through to the keeper. Beaten in pace and bounce again. Not looking too good"
"good length outside off, dabbed towards point."
"just short of Taylor at short fine leg. Good length on middle, Nabi gets across his stumps and clips the ball in the air towards short fine leg, where Taylor dives forward but the ball lands in front."
"a slower delivery to finish, patted to point. Five dots after the boundary. Not very good batting"
"flat outside off, pushed back to the bowler"
"runs at Badree. Full outside off, hammered to long-on"
"flat delivery but straight, swept to short fine leg. Just one"
"flat and wide this time, Stanikzai misses a cut. Should have been put away. Beaten for pace  again"
"flat on the pads, ricochets off the pad towards fine leg for a couple."
"excellent bowling from Badree to finish. Short outside off, spinning away. Pushed back to Badree. Just 11 off his three overs"
"slower, straight ball. Pushed to long-on"
"and again. Short on middle, Stanikzai misses a pull. Gets there so late. Too hot this pace"
"a slower short ball outside off, slapped to long-on"
"good length down leg, off the pad towards square leg. Just one more"
"full on off, worked to square leg"
"slow, full delivery on middle is pushed to long-on"
"a boundary to start. Short and wide from Narine, Nabi plays this late, down past short third man for four. Nicely done"
"tossed up outside off, swept to deep backward square leg"
"flat, straight, spinning back in, pushed towards cover. Struggling to hit gaps"
"drifts down leg, off the pad towards short fine leg"
"good length outside off, moving away. The carrom ball. Hit back to the bowler"
"and that is surely another run-out that Stanikzai is involved in. Flat delivery on leg, nudged to short fine leg. Nabi sets off, but Stanikzai yells 'nooo'. Does so far too late and by the time Nabi turns and makes his way back, the bails are off. Afghanistan's amateurish cricket continues."
"picks that alright. Brathwaite drops short, he isn't very pacey. Stanikzai sits back and nails a swat over midwicket. Outta here"
"another one beaten in pace. The hard length again. This is quicker and shorter and suddenly, Stanikzai has no idea what's coming at him. So late on the pull that all he can muster is a mis-timed pull into the hands of midwicket."
"on a length on off, clipped to square leg"
"another run-out. Disarray. Back of a length outside off, pushed towards cover. The non-striker sets off, the striker does too before saying no. Both batsmen are at the same end. In all this time, Kesrick picks up and under-arms an accurate throw at the bowler's end. Excellent fielding but didn't realise he had so much time. if that missed, it would have been an overthrow. He had so much time. Doesn't matter, for now. Mistakes galore for Afghanistan"
"shortish delivery outside off, played to Kesrick again at cover. Early no this time"
"beauty. May have been the legcutter. On a length outside off, the ball deviates away late and beats the bat"
"on the pads, worked to midwicket"
swept away towards deep square leg for a couple.
"the carrom ball. Short on middle and leg, clipped to fine leg, another couple. Picked that"
gets that past short third man for two more. The offspinner spins away and Najib taps the ball for two
"that could be four, will be. Flat down leg, Najibullah calmly paddles the ball to the fine leg boundary. Narine visibly displeases"
"full delivery outside off, pushed to long-off. Najib has already looked their best batsman, just by showing the right intent"
"short on middle, pulled to midwicket. That length has harried Afghanistan"
"Afghanistan seven down and sinking rapidly. Fuller than god length outside off, Najibullah tries to cut but it's too close to him. A thick inside edge clatters into the stumps, but was atleast trying to manufacture momentum"
"good length outside off, carved down to third man"
"full and straight, played back"
"good length on leg, the ball goes underneath Karim's swing."
"good length outside off, stabbed to cover. Another dot"
"full outside off, pushed towards point"
"flat delivery outside off, a carrom ball. Skewed towards midwicket. One more"
"looking to sweep, another carrom ball. Off the shoulder towards point"
"Afghanistan now eight down. Another carrom ball outside off, Rashid pokes with his feet rooted to the crease. Gets bat on it, but just the inside half. Another one chopped back into the stumps."
"beautiful. Full and straight. Instead of swinging across the line, Dawlat offers the full face and then angles his bat so that the ball goes up. His muscle ensured it stayed that way for enough time. Lovely six over long-off"
"goes through everyone. Flat on leg, the offbreak. Dawlat thinks it's the carrom ball and plays that line. The ball goes past Dawlat and the keeper. Four byes"
"whew. Swing and miss. Full outside off. Well, more a few inches outside off. Just misses the stumps"
"six more. Short delivery, it's not banged in with enough pace. Sits up for Karim to heave over square leg"
"a low full toss down leg, chipped to midwicket"
"they pass it, a legcutter on off and middle, worked to square leg"
"parried into the boundary. Full, straight. Karim shovels a drive, with the power of his bottom hand, wide of long-on who gets across but lets the ball go the boundary. Jon Carter the man"
"another six. Brathwaite goes short on middle and leg, swatted over midwicket. Big hit. Great timing"
"a short slow ball, punched over cover for a couple. Long-off gets across"
hasn't that ball come back into the reckoning of late. A sensational pin-point yorker on off and middle. Dawlat exposes his defense as soon as he chose to clear his front leg. Goes past the bat and into the stumps
"on the pads, just a nudge between square leg and fine leg. Finds four. The fielder can't track it down."
"full outside off, another yorker. Jammed out towards the bowler, who scurries to his left."
"another yorker outside off, pushed towards cover"
"full and wide outside off, goes past the bat for another dot"
"a slow short ball outside off, carved to point"
"another slower ball down leg, a mis-timed sweep lobs over the keeper off the leading edge for a couple to third man"
"high, high, taken. Full delivery on off, Janat gets underneath that and sends it a mile into the air. Not good timing, not much distance. The ball lobs in the air for Brathwaite to get across from mid-off, a reverse-cupped catch gives <strong>West Indies the T20 series</strong>"
