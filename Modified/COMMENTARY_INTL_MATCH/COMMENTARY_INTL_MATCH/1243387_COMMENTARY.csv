"on a good length and largely holds its line outside off, 132.1ks, Crawley is happy to watch it through to Pant behind the stumps"
"oooooh! Ishant goes much fuller and brings this back into Crawley and thinks he has pinged his pad. Ishant reckons that there's no bat involved, and asks Kohli to challenge the on-field not-out decision. <b>Bends back in to thump the front pad <i>just</i> above the knee-roll</b> as Crawley doesn't cover for the inswing at all. But, ball-tracking suggests that it would have bounced over the stumps. Umpire Menon's call is vindicated"
"pitched up and Ishant explores the channel again outside off, Crawley doesn't bite"
"on a length and bends back in at off, Crawley yanks his bottom hand off the bat and blocks out this inswinger"
"back of a length and curving away outside off, too wide to draw a stroke from Crawley"
"Ishant ventures another inswinger, <strong>finds some extra bounce</strong> to test Crawley further and rap him on the glove. The batsman loosens his grip once again and fends it off to the leg side to close out a rather eventful first over"
"full, threatens to angle in but straightens away a wee bit outside off, Sibley uses soft hands and runs it away in the gap at point for a double. England get off the mark"
"much fuller and Siraj brings this back into Sibley from outside off, no shot"
"<strong>Siraj zips past the outside edge</strong>. Sibley searches for the one that would come in, but this swings away after opening up the batsman and running past his edge"
"inswinger, shortish and on the hips, deflected away fine past the left of Pant for four leg byes"
"fullish and slanting in at off, Sibley gets right behind the line and plays it back to Siraj"
on a length and blocked stoutly on off stump once again
banged in outside off and thuds into the gloves of Pant outside off as this is left alone
"short, wide, finishes wider than a set of stumps outside off, yet Crawley goes searching for it. <strong>Swishes and misses outside off</strong>"
"very full and slanting in at off or on a fourth-stump line, Crawley isn't fully forward for the drive, winds up squirting it past the left of Ishant"
"length-ball inswinger, this is squirted again, to the leg side"
"on a length and outside off, encouraging carry to Pant again, as another delivery is left alone in the channel"
"another length-ball inswinger, confidently clipped to square leg with the swing"
"back of a length and flung outside off, ignored in the channel again"
"very full and seams back in at off stump, squirted back to the bowler as Crawley prods from the crease"
"on a length and homing in towards of stump, Crawley jabs at it and defends as the bottom hand flies off the bat"
"shortish and on off stump, defensively jabbed into the covers"
"driven on the up and carves in front of Axar. Full and wide, Crawley has to reach out for it, <strong>squirting it in front of point</strong>"
"fractionally overpitched and outside off, in the slot for the drive, but Crawley is pinned to the crease again, sending a <strong>thick inside edge down to long leg</strong>"
"back of a length and slanting in at off, blocked into the covers"
"on a length, threatens to come back in, but seemingly straightens away outside off. Crawley plays inside the line and allows himself to get beaten. Can't do much against this delivery that nips away like a quick legcutter"
"back of a length and zipping through outside off, nice take from Pant, left alone"
"wide of the crease, angling back in, swinging in from outside off, <strong>good leave from Crawley</strong> as it bounces over off and middle stumps"
shorter and outside off as Pant almost takes it on front of his face. Excellent carry through to the keeper. Nothing doing from Crawley
"back of a length and outside off, Crawley hangs back and dinks the ball up to point"
"pushed through outside off, holds its line, defended solidly off the front foot"
"<strong>oh, hello, another straight ball pings the stumps</strong>! The new red ball slides in from left-arm around, as opposed to turning away. Sibley plays for turn and is beaten on the inside edge....Okay, replays indicate that ball grazed the inside edge and then disturbed the stumps"
"<strong>arm ball, fizzes in at almost 99ks,</strong> Axar hits the pad even before YJB brings his bat down the wrong line. This seemed to be heading down leg"
"tossed outside off, forward, and driven into the covers"
"flat dart on off, round-arm release, Bairstow plays from the crease and squirts it to the leg side"
"another round-arm dart, 88ks, defended back to Axar. The left-arm fingerspinner starts with a wicket-maiden at his home ground"
"short and skids back in, <strong>Ishant has Crawley hopping, skipping</strong> and hastily fending off to the leg side"
back of a length and flung wide of off - finishes wider than a set of stumps outside off - ignored
"full and outside off, Bairstow covers his off stump and shoulders arms to it"
"dipping full-toss - nearly a yorker - squeezes under the swinging bat, hits the pitch, and loops up to Pant. Lovely take from Pant and he tumbles onto the ground. Then <strong>there's <em>that</em> Shawn Michaels-like kip up</strong>. Visual delight"
"nice and full, swinging down the leg, away from the reach of Bairstow's leg-side flick"
"even fuller and Ishant brings this one back sharply to have Bairstow falling over. Struck on the pad, but seems to be heading down leg/bouncing over the stumps anyway"
"<strong>confident drive from Crawley</strong>. He dashes down the track, meets a full delivery early and drills it straight of mid-off for the first boundary of this innings"
pretty full and angling into a defence on middle stump
"Crawley uses his feet, does so early, Axar held this back from a round-arm release. Check-pushed into the covers"
"down the track again, Axar shortens his length, has the advancing batsman jabbing towards midwicket"
"<strong>Feebly chipped straight into the lap of mid-off</strong>. Two in two for local lad Axar. Pushed through on off stump, Crawley ventures down the track once again, looks to mess with Axar's lines and lengths with a loft. But, he can't get close enough to the pitch of the ball. Miscues it to Siraj. It's quite difficult to sweep or step out to Axar"
"arm ball, fizzes in at 89ks, and bounces at off, <strong>Root safely diffuses it to the off side</strong>"
"Ishant tests Bairstow with a bumper outside off, he simply lets it pass to Pant"
"short and finishes wider than a set of stumps outside off, left alone"
"on a length and outside off, Ishant has Bairstow reaching out for the ball and <strong>stabbing it off the outer half</strong> between point and gully. He gets off the mark off his 12th delivery"
"moves away like a quick legcutter outside off, <strong>Bairstow spars at it and is beaten on the outside edge</strong>"
"full and homing in towards off, forward and prodded into the covers"
"back of a length and ducks back in sharply, Bairstow aims to clip it squarer through midwicket, but the ball takes the inside edge and runs away to fine leg"
"shorter and zipping into middle, round-arm release, flapped off the back foot to midwicket"
"slower through the air and slides in at off stump, prodded to the leg side via an inside edge"
"pushed through at off stump, 91ks, confidently blocked on the front foot"
"full on the stumps, tap and run to the right of Ashwin at mid-on"
"<strong>inside-edged in the air to the right of short leg</strong>. Full and zipping into middle, prodded away past that close-in fielder"
"tossed up slower and higher on middle, played back to the right of the bowler"
"kicks from a back of a length and moves away like a legcutter, Root stabs at it, plays well away from the body, and the ball bounces past the outside edge"
"back of a length and nips away outside off, Root tightens up and lets this one go"
similar ball as Siraj sustains that shape away from the right-hander. Root belatedly tucks his bat inside the line and lets it go
"back of a length and skidding in at off stump, Root jumps back and defends it right under his eyes"
"back of a length and ducks back in sharply, catches Root in a tangle and pings him above his thigh pad near the trouser pocket"
"lifter on middle, 137ks, Root takes it on with a hook and gets it fine past Pant for four. Not fully in control, but Root manages to find the fence"
"slides into middle, length ball, Bairstow closes the bat-face and defensively works the ball to midwicket"
Axar slows this up and shortens his length outside off. Some turn to boot. Bairstow checks his shot and <strong>slices a cut to the right of Rahane at lone slip</strong>
"pushed through flatter and faster on off, blocked off the front foot"
"down the track, Axar drags his length back and attacks the stumps, quietly played back to the spinner"
"round-arm dart on off stump, played back to Axar once again"
"95.3ks, full dart on off stump, Bairstow stretches out to smother it"
"<B>pinned on the crease and Root is gone!</B> Disaster for England, their skipper has been nailed by the inswinger! Stone dead as Siraj curls it into his rooted back-foot block, and he doesn't even review. That is a body blow for England's hopes of a competitive first innings"
"<B>an edge first ball, as Stokes tries to leave!</B> A fat snick, always heading down, but keeping the three slips interested"
"outswinger to the left-hander, curling away and left with more decisive intent this time"
blotted on a leg-stump line as Stokes falls into a forward push
"squared up and a fat outside edge squirts from leg through point, finds enough of a gap for the single"
"a zippy bouncer, skimming through to Pant as Stokes sways inside the line"
"pop from a good length, Bairstow rides the bounce and jabs it down to the off side"
flicked off the legs to the on side
"fizzier pace, and Bairstow is forward again to defend"
"head right over the ball, striding to the pitch to block"
"a touch more width, Bairstow is happy to let that go as Pant rides the bounce"
"<B>he didn't leave that one!</B> Zipping through on a fourth-stump line, Bairstow slashes into a cut/drive and misses everything"
"pushed through to the keeper as Stokes lets alone... oops, a no-ball"
"<B>edged and eludes second slip!</B> Crumbs, that was a genuine nick, Stokes caught on the crease, and pushing at the angle across his body, was always dipping on Rohit as he plunged to his left"
"blocked from the crease, angled bat taking the ball down into the cordon again"
"back of a length, shape from leg to off, Stokes is watchful on the back foot, playing it under his eye line"
"short-arm pull, clawed from just back of a length with enough meat to whistle through the leg side"
"<B>two fours in a row</B>, this one is more edgy, but they all count, good soft hands from Stokes, taking the ball down through the cordon, safe as you like"
"pushing forward to block the fuller length, a productive over for England and Stokes. Wonder if Ashwin has caught his skipper's eye yet?"
"back of a length, tucked off the hip to the diving short backward square"
"a gallop to the pitch, and a swish off the pads, never quite made it to the pitch of the ball but found the man on the 45 again"
"short backward square in business again, flinching a leg-stump line round the corner"
"<B>rocking back and cut away well!</B> That one seemed to skid on, but this time Bairstow was playing for that very ball, and timed it well off the top of middle stump, through point"
"pressed down the pitch, and back to the bowler"
leaning forward and blocked once more
"a bit of swing after the ball is safely past the bat, a wide enough line for Stokes to ignore"
"round the wicket, looking to shape into the left-hander, and blocked to the off side"
"solid block from back of a length, waiting for the ball to come on to the bat"
"outside of, and through to the keeper, this round-the-wicket line isn't quite getting Stokes to play as Siraj might have hoped"
"tighter to the pads this time, a comfortable clip off the legs and that's England's 50. Progress of sorts"
"onto the front foot, and half-driven into the off side"
"back of a length, over the wicket, dabbed down into the off side off the back foot"
"stretching forward to the off-stump line, blocked"
"<B>swept, and top-edged?</B> Yep, balloons over the close catchers, off the glove, but safe enough behind the bat on the leg side"
stabbed back down the track
"another arm-ball, drifting into the right-hander, who plays it solidly enough this time"
"<B>too short and wide</B>, and Bairstow accepts the rare freebie with glee, a slap behind point for Axar's sins"
"round the wicket, banged in short, down the leg side"
"better length, tucked to the leg side off the back foot"
"squeezed off the legs, very fine to fine leg, a bit of shape for Ishant, but sliding past the leg stump on the angle"
"width, and <B>Bairstow boshes another cut over third man!</B> Happy to get under the stroke as Ishant extracts more lift from the deck. Curious tactics from India, given England's spin shambles last week..."
"over the wicket now, fenced through backward square"
"back of a length, round the wicket to the left hander, no stroke as the ball skips through to the keeper"
"tight line from over the wicket, Bairstow rocks back to nudge to the on side"
"loop and flight, very full as the ball hangs in the air, Bairstow is watchful on the back foot"
"plinked off the toes, out to deep midwicket, as Bairstow plays from deep in the crease again"
"on the back foot, lots of noise from round the bat as Stokes blocks cautiously"
"<B>dumped over long-off!</B> A step to the pitch, a loose swing of the arms, and clean as you like into the stands!"
"watchful from Stokes, this one is a bit flatter but he kneels into a cautious block to the off side"
"<B>short and wide, slammed through point!</B> These are free runs for England, hard to fathom really."
"that's better from Ishant, tighter initial line and shape off the deck, slamming the pad-flap on the back foot"
"wider line but a fuller length, Bairstow launches into a drive but can't connect properly"
"outside off, no stroke this time"
"back of a length, Bairstow gets up on his toes to push into the off side"
"tight to off stump, a bit of shape back into the right-hander as he shoulders arms. Half an appeal for lbw as Pant thinks that's skimmed the pad, but no danger of it hitting the stumps"
"round the wicket, loopy full length, drawing Stokes forward to block"
"rising on the back foot this time, and riding the extra bounce as Ashwin attacks the splice"
"pressed with firm wrists into the off side, disrupting the close field like a flock of pigeons"
"stretching to the pitch, cat and mouse stuff, pushed to cover"
"on the back foot again, vertical bat, very cautious in defence"
"maiden over as Stokes squares up to fend this one off as well, probing line and length from Ashwin"
"<B>confusion on the quick single, and there's an appeal for run-out!</B> Bairstow hurtled off for the nudge to square leg, got sent back, and just about made it home as the throw was slightly wayward from Pujara"
flicked to the on-side
pressed with hard hands back down the line of the ball
"leaning forward, and pushed through the line"
"a bit of sharper turn there as Bairstow is forward again, but not quite spitting like the last Test"
pressed back down the ptich again

"nudged back to the bowler, slip and silly point in attendance"
"a fraction shorter, clipped off the hip to midwicket"
"right forward, head over the ball, defending the middle-and-leg line this time"
zips through a touch quicker as Stokes leaves alone. Extra bounce as the ball straightens outside off
"<B>big turn and drift</B> and Stokes is dragged into a rampant swipe through the line! Misses everything, but that was a moral victory for the bowler. And another maiden"
"on the back foot, jabbed to mid-on, and Bairstow gallops into the single as Pant, I think, provides the soundtrack... 'oooheeeoohhheieieiei!' Think he liked that one"
"nudged into the gap, another single to the cause"
"round the wicket, dipping on a full length, stabbed to silly point off the front foot"
"no stroke offered outside off, Bairstow draws his bat behind his back for good measure"
"on the back foot, blocking the leg stump line, with a bit of extra bounce from the over-spin"
"flipped to the on-side, can't find the gap but he does get to the break intact"

"tossed up on a fifth-stump line, patted back to Ashwin off the front foot"
"back of a length and on off stump, Stokes is right behind the line to defend to point"
"a bit too full and outside off, quicker through the air, smoothly driven through the line to deep cover"

"on a length and sliding in at off stump, Stokes covers up in defence"
"too full on the pads, clipped away to deep square leg where Axar collects the ball"

Stokes goes back and forces this shorter offbreak to mid-on
"flighted and spins away outside off, reaches out and dabs to point"
"tossed on off, Stokes stretches out to smother any spin"
"sliding in at off, full, 93ks, blocked on off stump"
"Ashwin and Pant reckon pad first, <b>the spinner asks Kohli to challenge the on-field not-out decision</b>. Full and slides in from around the wicket, Stokes plays around his front pad, and it indeed hit the pad first. Impact seems outside off and umpire Sharma's on-field not-out decision is vindicated in the end. So, India lose a review"
"<strong>inducker from Siraj at 146.4ks, and this time umpire Menon raises his finger</strong>. Umesh-like delivery. Given out lbw. YJB has a chat with his partner and calls for a review. On a length and swerves back in quite sharply, thumps a crease-bound YJB on the back leg in front of middle. No bat. It would have clipped the bails and it's enough for umpire Menon's call to be upheld. Siraj cranked it up, got it to skid quickly off the pitch and defeated Bairstow there. Bairstow shakes his head and looks perplexed - perhaps he thought he was given out caught behind"
"back of a length and zipping through outside off, no shot"

"length-ball slider on off, 93ks, defended back to Ashwin"
Stokes opens the face and guides this from a middle-stump line to backward point

"flighted and outside off, patted to the right of cover-point"
"nice and full outside off, Pope is halfway forward as he squirts a drive through the covers"
"back of a length and slanting into middle, whisked away to mid-on"
"another effort ball from Siraj, this is a bumper, wobbles away after the batsman ducks under it. It then bounces out of Pant's gloves even as he leaps to his right"
"shorter and angling across off, defensively pushed to the covers"
"hint of extra bounce from a length, Stokes loosens his grip and fends it to the off side"
Stokes works a single to mid-on and keeps strike
"tossed up, angling across, spinning and bouncing outside off, left alone"
"flighted on middle, Stokes stretches out in defence"
"shot! Stokes dashes down the track, gets close to the pitch and drives with the wrists to the left of mid-on. Good use of the feet and even better execution"

"looped up on off, dead-batted away"
Stokes is right back to defend this length-ball offbreak
"on a length and outside off, Pope reaches out, throws his bat at ball and flays a drive to extra-cover"
"good length and outside off, similar line and length but Pope elects to let this go in the channel"
"much fuller and outside off, <strong>Siraj cranks it up to 141ks</strong>, belted on the up to extra-cover"
"good length and sliding in at off stump, Pope covers up and blocks to cover"
"wide of the crease, full and holds its line outside off, 139ks, push-driven up to mid-off"
"banged in short and outside off, 134ks. Pope is caught in two minds: whether to pull or let it pass. He does a bit of this, bit of that, and bottom-edges it away"
"fired into the legs, too full, squeezed out. The ball hits the ground before lobbing into the hands of short leg. It has been referred to the TV umpire and it's not out of course"
"full and straight, clipped to midwicket"
<strong>turn and bounce for Axar!</strong> Starts on middle and ripping down the leg side. Left alone by Stokes. The ball bounces out of Pant's gloves
prodded into the covers off the front foot
"more turn and bounce for Axar! 92ks, drifts in and fizzes away outside off. Pope belatedly tucks his bat inside the line"
"<strong>biiiiig bounce for Axar again in the channel</strong>, not as much turn this time. Pope does well to simply watch it settle into the gloves of Pant"
"shot, Stokes! He holds his pose and admires this straight drive. Not a half-volley, fullish on middle, Stokes moves forward, shows the full face of the bat and eases it away to the left of Siraj and right of mid-on"
"back of a length and <strong> skidding into middle at 140ks</strong>, stabbed out to cover"
"shorter on middle and leg, <strong>140ks again</strong>, defended back to the left of Siraj"
"bumper down leg,<strong> Siraj bends his back and spears it at 141ks,</strong> but Stokes ducks under it and avoids it"
"dug in short and outside off, slanting away further, 138ks. Stokes leaps off his feet, has a crack at this, but only connects with a whole lot of thin air"
"follows all those short stuff with a full delivery aiming for off, Stokes' forward-defensive intervenes"
"full and just a shade outside off, round-arm release, tapped to the covers off the front foot"

"round-arm dart, full on off, down the track and defended back to Axar"

"more turn, and splice-hassling bounce from Sundar's high action. Stokes plays inside the line"
"<B>Stokes is lured into a wipe out of the rough!</b> Taking the same approach as in the first Test, maybe, looking to hoon over the leg side"
prodded to the off side
"<B>there goes the mighty hoon!</B> That was telegraphed, Stokes sizing up the big turn and thinking, time to plant the dog and flog it, rather than die wondering in defence. That was nailed over wide long-on"
"poked off the back foot, into the on side"
"reaching forward, right over the ball, bat pushing through the line"
"jabbed to the on-side and <B>Pope hurtles for the quick single!</B> Direct hit with the shy, and the umpires are checking, but Pope seemed safely home. Very good early and decisive call"

"round the wicket, blocked on the back foot, pushed to the leg side"
padded away to the leg side
fired down the leg side as Axar aims to cramp Stokes' arc
"sweep from Stokes, but the over-spin down the leg side eludes his intentions. Pant gathers well"
"off-stump line this time, and firm in defence on the front foot"

"on the back foot, stabbed to the on side"
"round the wicket, cramping Stokes on the legs, as he slides back and blocks to leg"

"on the back foot, and clobbered to deep point"
"leaning over the ball, blocked back down the pitch"
"quicker delivery, Stokes hops back and nudges into the gap at midwicket. Sharp on the first run, but can't turn it into a second"
"back round the wicket, Pope is committed to the front foot once more and presses urgently to cover"
"more light footwork, and punched to mid-off"
"round the wicket, no spin, sliding into the pads, and <B>Stokes is sent on his way!</B> He was beginning to look solid, but the arm ball strikes! Pope confirms that that's pretty adjacent, and Stokes flings his head back as he begins to march off"

blotted back down the track
a shuffle of feet and pushed back down the pitch

"<B>clubbed through the line, over long-on!</B> That's good intent from Lawrence, more or less to the pitch of the ball, and good conviction through the stroke"

"a touch of width and more good contact, this time on the cut, but straight at point"
"pushed onto the back-foot, and nudged to the on-side"
"big appeal again as Axar slips the non-spinner into that gaping knee-roll, but that one is doing too much to hit leg"

<b>extra bounce</b> and it appears the ball has ricocheted off short leg's boot and into the keeper's hands! <b>The soft signal is out</b>. Lawrence is on his back foot because he has to be. But the ball kicks up off a length and strikes his bat very very high. He does all he can to try and keep the ball down and replays suggest he miiiiiiiiiiight just have done it. A zoomed up shot of short leg's boot seems to show the ball has bounced juuuuuuuuust in front of him and only then popped up towards Rishabh Pant. Still the third umpire is asking for more angles. He wants to be perfectly certain. This is quite tight. And the decision is NOT OUT. The right call.

"<strong>so close!</strong> A good leave in the end, but this one doesn't turn as Rohit leaves alone, and it misses off by a whisker"
"<B>huge turn and bounce!</B> Foakes does very well to gather at head height from a very full length, and even manages to whip off the bails, but never a danger of a stumping"
"forward, head over the ball, tucked to the on side"
"on the legs, tickled round the corner"
"rolls his fingers on a full length, looked like a cutter as it jagged back past a defensive raise of the bat"
"banged in short, and <strong>not remotely comfortably played! </strong> In fact, that's pinged Rohit <B>clean on the helmet!</B>. The ball bobbles down to backward square, but Stokes is really cranking it up in this spell. Nowhere near the pull shot, and out comes the physio"

"a skip to the pitch, and pushed to cover with bat and pad together"
stretching forward to push back to the bowler. Tidier finish to the over from Leach

"drags his length back, Rahane hops into line to push to cover"

"hits the deck hard with a bit of nip back into the batsman, Rahane wears it on the gloves as he flinches to the leg side"
"<B>big hooping inswing!</B> That came from nowhere, as Rohit pokes back through the line, and squeezes a closed-face drive back past the bowler. Anderson will be interested by that delivery..."
"fuller length, attacking the pads, blocked back down the track"

"well bowled again, just threatening to grip from outside off as Bess tosses it up"

"turn and bounce, as this flicks Rohit's arm-pit and deflects to the leg side. Lots going on in that over"
"<B>snorter to start!</B> A wicked full-length outswinger, curls past Rahane, who is turned into an S as it goes by"
"straightens on a wicket-to-wicket line, Rahane is cautiously forward to block"
"inswinger this time, only a gentle one, but signs that the ball is talking. Clipped to backward square and they hustle back for two"

"looped up on middle, driven with the spin to the right of midwicket"

"short and sliding into middle, Rohit jumps back, aims leg side, but ends up spooning a leading edge in front of cover. This pitch seems two-paced, but Rohit has dealt with it well enough"
"<strong>No fifty for Rohit as the returning Stokes traps him</strong>. Rohit calls for a review. Good length, starts outside off and jags back in viciously to beat the inside edge and ping him on the back leg in line with off. The tracker returns umpire's call on impact (marginal call on off) and it would have trimmed the bails, enough for the on-field out decision from Menon to be upheld. Rohit had looked to go leg side, but the ball skidded back in to pin him in front. Stokes is putting in a great shift on a near-40 degree day"
"round the wicket, darted in on a leg-stump line, and blocked"

"outside off, full length, no stroke"
"banged in short, and Ashwin wears this on the gloves as he hops back into line. <strong>And that's hurt him</strong>... off comes the glove, it's his bowling hand too... but he's flexing it as the physio takes a look, so I think he'll be okay. Good aggression once more from Stokes though. He's putting in a shift"
"round the wicket, tight lines and dipping on a good length. Blocked on the front foot"
"skids on a touch, but not with the venom of Axar's standard wicket ball. Nevertheless Ashwin has to adjust late to save his stumps/pads"
nudged to the on-side
"tidy line and length from Leach, dipping on off stump, and punched off the back foot to point"
attempted cut but too close for the shot. Smart take from Foakes
stretching forward and blocked to the off side
"round the wicket, thumped in short, Pant swivels into a compact pull to midwicket"
"<B>another snorter from Stokes, and Ashwin is caught behind!</B> But he's <B>reviewing</B>. So similar to the Kohli delivery, banged in short, kicking through to attack the splice as he raised his gloves in defence... but that's <B>missed the bat and flicked the shoulder!</B> That's what DRS is for. A big moment"

"in the channel outside off, scuttles through as Ashwin leaves alone"

"tucked off the legs, there's a man on the 45 too and he tidies up"
"<B>big spin, back into the inside edge</B>, but Foakes tumbles and can't reach it. Pant was right back on his stumps that time"
"spin again, into the hip and flicked to the leg side. Pant is playing within himself at the moment"
stabbed to backward point with a big stride and an open face
skidding on as Ashwin plays from deep in his crease. A probing over

"back of a length from round the wicket, open-faced steer down to third man"
"very full length, dipping into the pads on a leg-stump line, clipped to square leg"

"onto the front foot, and poked to mid-off"
"nudged away and Pant wants the single, Ashwin is less enthused. A few hairy moments in that over, but India continue to build an important stand"
"<B>clipped in the air, straight to short midwicket!</B> Dipping on the leg stump, Ashwin looked for the nurdle to the leg side, but the ball stopped on him, his bat-face closed to a leading edge, and Pope hops to complete a lobbed chance! The scales tilt once more..."
"leaning forward, and pushed to the off side"
flashed back towards the bowler with a bottom-handed flick. Leach dives across the pitch to intercept
"wide line, on a full length, spanked with intent but Leach gathers again on all fours"
"panned back to the bowler, a flurry of feet, and a bump-ball into Leach's chest. This is rowdy and riveting already"
a more circumspect block to end an eventful over

He was certainly well back on the stumps, and no bat involved.... <strong>clipping the top of middle and leg!</strong> The not-out stands"

"flighted just a shade outside off, hint of turn, dead-batted away"
"on a length and spins away outside off, left alone"
"low full-toss just a shade outside off, scooped to mid-off. Pant wants the single, Washington sends him back, and righty so. Pant dishes out a full-length dive and <b>cops a blow on his shoulder/neck</b> as Crawley, I think, flings the throw at the non-striker's end"
"flighted on middle, Washington gets fully forward and pushes it back to Bess"
"scooped up in the air, up and over short cover, and well wide of the reach of mid-off. Dangled up outside off and spins away, Washington stays leg-side of the ball and merely chips it over the infield for four, cutting the deficit to 34"

"good stride forward, head over the ball, rock solid defence from Sundar outside off"
covers the line of a straighter ball and turns it straight of midwicket
"oooh, that turns! Leach is able to pull his length just a touch back without compromising on flighting the ball.

This time Sundar plonks the bat outside the line of the ball and gets hit on the pad"

"appeal for leg before, Root and the keeper come together, but no one seems to be sure of anything so no DRS. Sundar is caught in front by a straighter ball. The quicker ball. He's beaten for pace. He's struck in line with the stumps, striking the elbow and then his back thigh. <b>Ball tracking says it would have bounced right over leg stump</b>"
lunges forward to turn the flighted ball to short leg
""
defends the full delivery spinning into him from off stump (Leach is around the wicket)
<b>that's fifty</b>! The crowd rises up to celebrate a batsman who is only just getting used to how good he can be. Pant always had belief. But now he's combining that with performance. A simple push to long-on - a no risk shot - gets him to the landmark. That's determination. That' him saying I'm going to stay here and get India a big lead

"pitched up and sliding across off, left alone in the channel"

"tighter line on a fuller length, a respectful block as Stokes finds some movement"
"outside off, back of a length again, Stokes hasn't adjusted his old-ball deck-hitting for the new-ball lift-off, and Sundar is happy to get right underneath that and clobber on the up over third man"
"fuller length, through to the keeper. This is a sensational stand"
"<B>reverse lap over the slips!</B> That, right there, is the reason Anderson doesn't play white-ball cricket any more! That's a preposterous indignity! Pant only got a tickle on the ball, but it flew! Jimmy is... non-plussed"
more conventional on the front foot

"firmly forward, head over the ball, pushed back down the track"
stretching onto the front foot to block
"big stride once again, and defended back to the bowler"
"<B>gone this time!</B> Anderson gets the final word, but what a stunning innings it has been. Back of a length, Pant winds into a massive mow across the line, but honks it straight to Root at short midwicket. That's a sharp take for a ball that was sizzling, and he tosses it away with the look of a captain who has had the game ripped away from him. I suspect Pant's sealed his side's place in the World Test Championship final."

"a flick to the on-side, can't  beat the field"

"sharp turn, into the pads, gathered at leg slip"
"back of a length, flogged out through midwicket as Leach drops just short enough to free the arms"
"clipped to the leg side, another jogged single to keep things ticking. It's all a bit flat out there at the moment which will suit India just fine. No rush, just stretch England every which way to the close"
"on the back foot, solid in defence"
"slapped high into the covers, Anderson gives chase,  but it <B>plugs just out of reach!</B>"
"onto the front foot, and punched to mid-off"
"<B>big turn!</B> Drift and dip from Bess, and it explodes from outside off... and <B>Foakes has appealed for the stumping</B> He got the bails off quickly, but I don't think there's any issue there. Toe seems safe"
"big stride, onto the front foot, head right over the ball. And solidly blocked"
"back onto the stumps, and fenced back to the bowler"
"<B>that's pretty adjacent!</B> And yes, up goes the finger! Sundar reviews, was there an inside-edge? Maybe? He was right back on his stumps, and that was surely hitting leg... but <B>DRS confirms!</B> Yep, a big fat spike on UltraEdge. On we go!"

"high-elbowed defence, right back on the stumps as Axar slides one on"
"<B>swept, and top-edged over the slips!</B> Quicker delivery, and Root was hustled on the stroke. Got a fat piece of bat on it though so it went well clear of the fielders. Dragged back in with a slide at fine leg"

"punched to cover, pressing forward to meet the pitch"

punched off the front foot to cover
"<B>oof, big rip and bounce!</B> Beats the outside edge"
"another sweep, but a bit frenetic. Can't time it as his boot seems to wear some of the force"
"<B>another fizzer!</B> That's outstanding bowling, Pope has no chance to lay bat on that"
"<B>dragged out of the crease, and Pant has pulled off a blinding stumping!</B> It was coming all over long, Pope's methods were scrambled by the sheer fizz of Axar's deliveries... he tried to gallop to the pitch and take the positive route, but all he found was a tangle of limbs and willow as the ball dipped through his intentions, then exploded off the pitch. Pant, unsighted amid all this, grabs supremely by his throat and stretches to flick off the bails. He's not in the frame"
head over the ball and blocked into the pitch
"right back on the stumps,<strong> thumped on the pads, Root is lbw!</strong> He's reviewed straightaway, as well he might. Is there inside edge? Nope, I don't think so ...and that's going to be smashing middle and off, surely.... three red lights and that is England toasted, buttered and ready for the application of cream and jam."

turning down the leg side
nurdled off the legs to the on-side
"hoisted over the leg side, and <B>dropped behind square!</B> A valiant effort in the deep but the ball was just dropping on the fielder, Gill I think, as he flung himself forward, and it scuttled off behind him.  An attempted slog sweep, rather thinned the shot and nearly paid the price!"

"<B>massive appeal as Ashwin thumps the pads again!</B> No stroke offered, but it was a leg-sided delivery... did it pitch in line, umpire's call, and turning past leg, says Ball Tracker. On we go. Or not, as it happens, because that is <B>tea</B>"

Axar slows this up, pitches outside off, spins and bounces outside off. Foakes has to reach for the ball and nicks it low. Rahane dives to his left and seems to have his fingers underneath the ball. It's a clean catch, and there's the breakthrough for India. They're just three away now. Axar is one away from another five-for at his home ground"

Caught-behind is the verdict, but if it's flicked the pad, lbw may be in play. Indeed, <strong>there's no edge</strong>. But here comes Ball Tracker for the lbw... pitched outside leg.
