"has it carried? They're checking this. Terrific effort nonetheless. Milne isn't sure, it seems. This is a fuller one that's been crunched uppishly straight to mid-on. Milne moves to his right and dives forward to grab it inches off the ground. Might it have just spilled out there? The replay partially suggests so. On first look, seems like he had his fingers underneath. Benefit of doubt given to batsman"

"straight up in the air. So high that Corey Anderson, running to his right from long-off, almost to where long-on is, covers enough ground and then puts in a dive to pull off a magnificent catch. Eyes were on the ball all the way, balance was superb, control even better as he ensured the ball didn't bobble out. Sarfraz was deceived in flight as he stepped out to slog, Sodhi saw him advance and bowled it just a touch wider, Sarfraz ended up dragging it a little and that resulted in complete lack of timing. Big wicket."

"squeezed down to the man coming in from long-on, but hang on, Malik's turned blind, only to be sent back and Corey Anderson, who can do no wrong.

"he's swung this across the line, but doesn't get hold. One bounce to deep square"
"swung through even before the ball arrived, only for the ball to hit his thigh. Shaheen Afridi was quite convinced about the lbw and implores his captain to review.

"drills this full delivery to mid-off, only a single."
"has he squeezed this to the fine leg boundary? Looks like he has, anyway the third umpire will have a check. This is full, angling into middle and leg, Southee squeezes this between his legs.

Four runs, useful runs, to keep the game alive"

"excellent yorker, right into the blockhole, Taylor can only squeeze this as far as the midwicket fielder."
