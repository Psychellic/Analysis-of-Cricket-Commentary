"an appeal for caught behind, concerted appeal. Umpire Gaffney asks the bowler and the keeper to clam down. He chats with umpire Sharma and refers it to the TV umpire. The soft signal is out. Clean catch from Ojha, diving to his left. Ashwin is gone for 29, his highest score in all IPLs. This was an innocuous full ball floated down leg. Ashwin aimed for a glance, and only tickled it behind. Ojha dived to his left and hung on to a one-handed low catch, plucked it inches from the turf.

"Nehra aims for a yorker, he ends up bowling a full toss on off. Dhoni sizes it up, clears his front leg, and slams it over wide long-on for six"
"Yuvraj breaks the stumps. Dhoni has been run out on the second. Yuvraj sets off on a celebratory sprint. Warner is pumped. Is that the game? Hurrying bouncer on off, Dhoni is late to pull and gets a top edge over the keeper. Short third man (Sran) moves back and to his left and hunts the ball down. Dhoni comes back for the second. The ball is tagged to Yuvraj who runs towards the stumps from backward point. He dashes in and flips the bails off"
"Naman Ojha pulls off another one-handed catch! Zampa is out for a duck. SRH sneak through. Nehra has his hands aloft in joy. Zampa backed away outside leg, this is a yorker speared outside off, Zampa slashes and manages an outside edge. Ojha dives full-length to his right and completes another one-hander. A four could have resulted in a super over. T20 is a game of small margins. As is turns out, <b>Sunrisers go top with this thriller</b>. Supergiants have close to no chance of making the playoffs"
