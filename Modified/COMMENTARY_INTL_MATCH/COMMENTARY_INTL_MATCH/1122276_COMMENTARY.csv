"starts with a poor delivery. Drifts down leg for an ODI wide, some inward shape to the left-hander"
"and again. Full but swinging down leg, Elgar tries to flick it down for four but it's too wide. Another ODI wide down the leg side"
"and India strike in the first over! A perfect comeback from Bhuvneshwar. After two leg side deliveries, he finds the one that seams away. Pitches on middle and leg, and because of that line, Elgar is caught into playing. Elgar pokes at the ball. The length is good too, not seaming away too much to beat the outside edge or seaming too less to find the outside half. A thin outside edge is easily taken by Saha. The ideal start for India."
"oh wow. That has pitched on a length outside off, 132 kph, and moved away prodigiously to beat the bat. It's <b>a jaffa</b> that even the quality of Amla can't get close to. A little less seam movement would have had Amla"
strays down leg this time
"and again! What an over to start from India. Sensational start. Slightly fuller outside off, the ball pitched and seams away very late. Amla is opened up as he tries to defend. He'll now change his technique, play late, close to his body"
"BAT on BALL! 135 kph, full around off, not much swing or seam. Markram gets forward to defend. That's a confident stride"
"a bit of swing but very wayward. Full and wide, swinging away, an ODI wide again. Markram ain't bothered"
"full delivery outside off, Markram gets a massive stride forward to defend. The <strong>difference in length is</strong> discernible, Shami is much fuller, seeing if swing is there"
"full and wide outside off, some late away shape. Left alone watchfully. Some probing bowling already"
"good length outside off, defended towards point. 140 kph. A loud collective yelp of joy from the Newlands faithful"
"squeezed away into the leg side, towards midwicket. Full again, around off, Amla gets his bat down at an awkward angle, which is why the ball skews off the inside half past square leg, as opposed to mid-on"
"good length outside off, shortish and wide, left alone"
"superb bowling. With the ball swinging, that's a terrific length. Full outside off, and then the ball jags away like a legbreak, leaving the outside edge useless"
"very good again. Around off, fuller than a good length, defended"
"full and wide outside off, 133 kph, Markram thinks of driving but bails out late"
"lovely shot. A tad overpitched and Markram gets forward and punches a delectable drive through mid-off. Full face of the bat, not over-hit. Let his timing take it away. First boundary of the series"
"given! Two wickets in two overs from Bhuvneshwar. Markram doesn't review. And India have two in three overs. This one has seamed back in prodigiously after pitching, the previous ones moved away. So Markram is very late in getting his bat down. He then bails out of the stroke, the ball doesn't care, it keeps seaming in to hit Markram just outside off, but the lbw rule doesn't care. No shot offered. A review would not have helped Markram. Sensational swing bowling"
"on the pads, nudged down to fine leg for one."
and away with four easy runs. On the pads goes Shami and AB tickles him away through square leg for four. Not quite found his line just yet. It's still the right length though
"very wide outside off, full and swinging away late, left alone"
"terrific ball. Full around off, de Villiers gets behind the line to defend. A bit of seam movement from there is lethal"
"good length around off, 137 kph, de Villiers hangs on the back foot and dabs to point. Needs to be a foot fuller than that"
"nice finish. On a length around middle and leg, some late away shape leaves de Villiers squared up as he defends"
"full delivery outside off, moves away too much again. No way Amla is sparring at that, plays the line and allows himself to be beaten"
"full and very wide, overpitched half-volley but with the pressure on, Amla is happy to let that one go"
"good length outside off, 137 kph, some steep climb, left alone. Another good leave"
"another fine leave. It swings back in this time, outside off, moves back in, but Amla knows it's far too wide to cause him trouble so left alone"
"135 kph, Amla edges off and South Africa are tottering! Good length outside off, it moves away late, but Amla rather inexplicably jabs at it. With that away seam movement, that shot is always fraught with risk, a thick outside edge is taken by the keeper. It's a loose shot, and SA are 12 for 3 within the first 22 minutes of the first Test."
"good single. Good length outside off, Faf prods at it, pushes at it in front of point for a run. Positive intent."
"full around off, defended back. 138 kph. That's a very good delivery"
"on a length around off, du Plessis solidly behind the line."
"on the pads, du Plessis falls over a flick, struck on the pad but going down."
"great leave. On a length outside off, du Plessis lifts his hands high and lets it go."
"good length outside off, 136 kph, another nice, positive leave"
"132 kph. Shami found his rhythm in that over, but it was well played too. Good length outside off, left alone"
"good length around off, de Villiers opens up his stance slightly and punches to point."
"ooh, full delivery outside off, de Villiers strides forward but inside-edges the ball into his pad. An appeal but quickly shot down"
"full delivery outside off, 131 kph, left alone well. Probing away"
"on the pads, nudged down to fine leg for a couple. Good running from AB"
"looking to flay a drive through the covers but the ball seams back in, de Villiers' drive bounces over the bowler and hots the stumps at the bowler's end"
"135 kph, fullish outside off, dabbed away towards point"
"good length outside off, 135 kph, a set of stumps wide outside off. Du Plessis leaves"
"<b>beats the bat</b>, fuller than a good length outside off, du Plessis pokes, beaten on the outsid edge"
"fullish length on a fourth-stump line, defended back confidently."
"seam movement. On a length around 132 kph, seams back in and beats Faf on the inside edge, struck on the back thigh pad"
"good length around off, 135 kph, right behind the line, head over the ball"
"good end. Another maiden. Full and wide outside off, the ball moves away and du Plessis lets it go. Played that over nicely"
"through cover point for four. I don't think Bhuvneshwar should mind that, full outside off, swinging away. The problem here was that it was too full, so de Villiers could come forward and slice the ball off the outside half"
"counter-attacking from AB. Full and wide outside off, de Villiers lets his hands through the line and drives through cover. Massive holes there, clever batting."
"good length outside off, 136 kph, left alone"
short and wide and de Villiers goes after it. Slashed over point for four. Think he intentionally went from down to up so that the ball goes in the air
"nailed! What de Villiers has done is force the pressure back on Bhuvneshwar, who dishes it out short and wide. Boom through point for four with a cut. Fantastic batting."
"exceptional batting. The best ball of the over, full outside off, AB gets forward and defends towards cover, calls for a run and du Plessis responds well"
"nicely bowled actually. Full and straight, looking for the lbw. 141 kph, nudged down to fine leg"
"good length outside off, left alone. Du Plessis not getting carried away"
"138 kph, nice carry. Full delivery outside off, the ball keeps bouncing, left alone. Carried at shoulder height to the keeper"
"139 kph, attacking the stumps again, full around off, flicked down to fine leg. Needed some bat"
"140 kph, another good leave, good delivery and fine take. Full outside off, lots of seam movement back in. De Villiers knows it's wide enough, left alone. Saha dives away to his left to collect with one hand"
"great first over from Bumrah. Full outside off, a large front-foot stride, left alone"
"136 kph, full delivery outside off, a thick outside edge dies down towards third slip. The fielder dives to his right to save runs"
"hits du Plessis in an uncomfortable spot. Full delivery around off, du Plessis is beaten on the inside edge, struck in the groin area. Needs a few seconds"
"good single. Full around off, pushed out to mid-on. Ashwin is slightly deep, so the run is easy."
"shuffles right across, full outside off. If he was taking leg-stump guard, he could have driven that through cover, but because he has moved, he has to defend. It's like bowling to Steven Smith, the off stump changes"
"in the gap for four. It was a terrific delivery, shortish outside off, the ball moves away late, takes the outside edge. But he has played it soft hands, lets the ball die down. Through gully"
"that's why Bhuvneshwar shouldn't mind being driven. Full outside off, the ball swings away late, but too much to find the outside edge. De Villiers' balance is all off too as he misses a drive. Superb bowling"
"on a length but wide outside off, du Plessis is not interested"
"<strong>fantastic cricket this</strong>. The bowling is accurate, the batsmen know what they have to do for now. Full outside off, du Plessis strides forward and blocks in front of point. De Villiers sprints through."
"cuts him in half. That's that awkward angle again. His point of release is so straight but because of his arms coming at an awkward angle, he can generate that seam movement. Goes through"
"byes! And again. Slightly fuller outside off, cuts back in prodigiously to beat de Villiers on the inside edge. Keeps moving and Saha can't collect either. Palms it away but fine leg cleans up"
"fullish outside off, left alone"
"full around off, a thick inside edge into the pad. Superb over from Bumrah, but India won't rest easy till de Villiers is still there"
"131 kph, superb bowling. Full outside off, moving away late. But du Plessis knows that if it's moving away, he is fine so he plays the line"
"bounce! Good length around off, closer to the off stump than the previous delivery. Keeps climbing and du Plessis rides it well. <b>One of the best periods of cricket in a long time</b>"
"on a length around off again, moves away, off the outside half towards point"
"129 kph, on off and middle, worked away towards midwicket"
"late on it. Full outside off, du Plessis is far too late on it. Think he expected that one to move away but it did not. Beaten on the outside edge"
"full around off, 133 kph, nudged towards square leg. Maiden!"
length and speared in at off stump. Waits late to get the bat down on this forward block
"140kph, length and wide outside off. He's getting that steep climb that comes with the action. This one is left alone easily though"
"oh lovely. 143kph and angled in at off stump from wide of the crease. De Villiers has to hurry to get in position and almost falls over into the off side, but manages to block it solidly towards mid-on"
"back of a length and just outside off, stabs it through point off the inside half"
"<b>gets a glove</b> but it's past the keeper down leg side. Faf very late on it after deciding to pull. It climbs up sharply - not the most well directed short ones, it's going down leg, but he goes after it"
"good length and in at off stump, defended solidly"
"<b>inside edge</b> on a very loose prod outside off from de Villiers, but he gets four. It's back of a length in the corridor and nips back in. He's aerial as he tries to punch through the covers, gets a boundary to fine leg"
"<b>gorgeous.</b> How do you get on top of this guy? It's a similar to the last one, nipping back into the corridor from back of a length. This time the feet are more decisive, and the balance more pure. Gets the bat from under the ball and whips it through midwicket. Stunning"
"back of a length at off stump, blocked into the off side"
"short and wide outside off, cuts forecefully, but straight to backward point"
"back of a length at middle stump, defended to midwicket off the back foot"
"back of a length in the corridor, left alone"
"nicely done. Leans into the full ball outside off and gets to the pitch. That helps him counter the marginal movement away and after that, the wrists comes in nicely to caress this through extra cover"
"another. Fuller from Bumrah, less of a stride from Faf. It's right under his eyes and he taps it past the bowler. Mid-off is too wide"
"length ball in at middle and leg, shuffles across and deflects towards fine leg off his pad as he fends at this"
"good length outside off, nips away off the seam but he's leaving this"

"<b>an edge has been taken by Kohli</b> at second slip, but no one is sure if that has carried. Soft signal not out as the umpire's go upstairs. First look - Kohli's right palm doesn't look to have made an action to scoop the ball up like you would see in low catches like this...yep, that is given not out. That was a length ball in the corridor that straightened on Faf. He went after it with soft hands"
"good length and wide outside off, left alone"
"full and closer to the batsman this time, putting it up there for a drive. It nips away, Faf leaves"

"back of a length at off stump, squeezed into the leg side with a closed face"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
outside edge dies and is into the turf as he defends on the front foot with soft hands. Dhawan leaps one-handed to his right at third slip and stops

"back of a length in the corridor, closer to it this time as he taps to point off the back foot"

"inside edge onto back leg as he gets on top of this to try and punch through cover. It was angled in at him, and he was reaching out a touch"
"crashes into the pad as he sits in the crease to a length ball. Expected that to climb, it appears, but that gets him on the knee roll. Going down leg. Leg byes at square leg"
"144kph, overpitched and wide outside off. Reaches out and gets it right off the toe-end with the cover drive, but that's enough. No fielder in the covers"
"short ad wide outside off, gets on top of it easily and punches through the cover region"
"<b>fifty</b> for De Villiers, brought up with a stroke that sums it up. He's only looked to attack today. Attacks this too, it's short of a length and shaping away off the pitch. He shuffles and gets behind the line to crash it through the covers"
"back of a length and in at leg stump, deflected into the midwicket region as he looks to whip this"
"good length on middle stump, shuffles and clips through square leg"
"back of a length and nips off the pitch, away from the batsman. He gets on top of the bounce and stabs it wide of mid-off. Rejects the run"

"132 kph, full around off, driven to mid-on. Nice length"

"big appeal, no says umpire Kettleborough. Full delivery outside off, jags back in after pitching, like the de Villiers dismissal, but du Plessis gets forward. It hits him on the front pad, in front of off. <strong>India review</strong>. First impression was outside the line but HawkEye says in line. That is umpire's call, clipping the top of off. Did the umpire say outside the line or height? Doesn't matter"
"full and wide, left alone"
"out this time, no doubt. Du Plessis has nicked off two balls later and SA are in big trouble! Good length outside off, keeps a tad low too. Du Plessis cuts, but is a tad late on the shot. Toe-end to the keeper. Kohli sends off du Plessis with some ecstatic celebrations"

"how's that? There is a direct hit at the batsman's end, and the third umpire is asked to confirm. Maharaj's laziness has cost South Africa here. Very poor from him. Ashwin catches him short. Driven to mid-on, Maharaj calls Rabada, but is sent back. He is left mid-pitch why Rabada hasn't responded well, and so spends a vital fraction of a second there before turning back. That cost him, as he is a couple of inches short. Very sloppy from Maharaj, the frustration was piling"

"the fast bowler's answer. Back of a length, the bouncer around off, Rohit gets underneath"
"like this one! 139 kph, <strong>massive appeal from Rabada</strong> for caught behind. No. Back of a length outside off, keeps climbing from that length and beats Rohit on the outside edge."
"thigh pad through to the keeper. Back of a length down leg, Rohit misses a flick, struck on the thigh pad. De Kock throws the ball in the air, umpire Gough isn't fooled"
"the yorker to finish. Rabada trying to go underneath the bat, pushed to mid-on. Terrific over from KG"
"good length outside off, 139 kph, Pujara plays the line, allows the ball to go through. Well left"
"full and very wide outside off, 140 kph, left alone. No reason to play"
"full outside off, left alone. Pujara won't play at those. Needs to be straighter"
"well played. As Alagappan said, Pujara is waiting for the balls to come to him. This one drifts down leg and Pujara just nudges him through fine leg. This is Test match batting, awesome discipline"
"full and wide, no stroke yet from Pujara"
"a fantastic over of batting from Pujara. He got one bad ball and put away, he negated five good balls with ease. Wide enough to leave this one"
"141 kph, good length down leg again, Rohit misses a flick. An ODI wide"
"144 kph. Rabada strikes. He goes wide of the crease, and gets that to seam back in. Beats Rohit for pace, struck him in front of off. And the umpire gives him. <strong>But Rohit reviews</strong>. Rohit misses the ball, the bat hits the pad, leaving the ball with an unhindered path to the front pad. Rabada has been the fastest of South Africa's bowlers today, and it has showed against Rohit. Three reds on HawkEye, India lose their review and Rohit. Rabada is pumped."
"<b>thuds into the right hand</b> as Rabada greets India's premier spinner with a bouncer aimed at the heart. This isn't going to be pretty. And Ashwin needs help. He is worried about his right index finger and the physio rushes out to the field. And while a little magic spray is being applied, Steyn comes in to have a word with his protege."
"<b>fended away for four to fine leg!</B> Ungainly. Rabada has thrown this game open. Bouncer, aimed at the shoulder bone. Ashwin takes his front hand off the pad, and the ball flies down to the fine leg boundary. Real pace, fire"
"goes full this time, like the Rohit delivery. Pushed back, doesn't look like a Test match No. 6 in these conditions"
"looking for the yorker, but misses his line, strays down leg. Good take by de Kock, diving to his left. Sensational bowling"
"140 kph, full around middle and leg, worked away to mid-on."
"full again, on the pads, 138 kph, hit to mid-on. Is a short backward square leg a viable catching option for Pujara?"
"full and wide, left alone"
"seam movement. Full around off, shovelled towards square leg for one. Soft hands again"
"the anticipated short delivery outside off, too short, easily avoided. The back of the length is the one that causes most trouble"
"that's it, the back of the length outside off, dabbed to point. Ashwin thinks of the easy run and takes it. He will have to face Rabada now, no respite"
"full outside off, 140 kph. He just limbers up and bowls this pace, awesome athlete. Driven back nicely by Ashwin"
"full outside off, Ashwin will be pleased with that single, driven through cover for a run"
"the outside edge but dies to gully. Full around off, thick outside edge to gully"
"those should be put away. Overpitched outside off, Pujara leans into a drive and picks out mid-off. A yard either side would have been four"
"141 kph, stunning bowling! Wide of the crease outside off, pitches and bounces and seams away. Even Pujara can't nick that"
drifts down leg this time. Pujara misses a flick
"137 kph, on the pads, flicked away through square leg for four. In the slot and put away, nicely done"
"well played. Short outside off, 139 kph. Ashwin shoves the bat in line with his body and lets the ball go through"
"another fine bouncer, short outside off. Easy for Ashwin to sway away but the length is really good, and getting that length right is not easy"
"good stop by Maharaj. Full outside off, bunted away towards point. Ashwin reaches the ball a tad late"
"well played again. Left alone. Full outside off, Ashwin keeps the bat in line with his body."
"full delivery outside off, pushed away to mid-off"
"141 kph, on the pads, think his body is just falling over slightly, which is why so many are so straight, worked to square leg. Could be intentional, can't be sure"
"a short delivery outside off, 142 kph, appreciable pace and bounce. Pujara sways away"
"aargh. Frustrating runs. Good length outside off, a thick outside edge goes in the gap at gully. Soft hands"
"so many off-side runs suddenly. Full outside off, driven to cover. Big gaps"
"short down leg, 144 kph, a bit too short. Ashwin eases underneath"
"full around off, that front pad comes across a tad too far maybe, driven to mid-on"
"on the pads, nudged away to wide mid-on. SA bowling just where Pujara wants it, that's the reward for his diligence"
"good length around off, pushed to mid-on"
"full and wide outside off, Pujara leaves on line"
"139 kph, on a length around off, Pujara stays in the crease and defends"
"shortish on the ribs, nudged to deep square leg, 141 kph"
"dug in, maybe a tad too short, plenty of time for Ashwin to duck underneath"
"wide of the crease, fullish length around off and middle, solidly behind the line. Not much seam movement any more"
properly behind the line is Pujara to defend
"back of a length this time, around off, 142 kph, worked to square leg"
"good length outside off, 142 kph, capably behind the line to defend. Solid stuff from Pujara"
"back of a length outside off, left alone, 142 kph"
"142 kph, maiden! Good length around off, the ball coming back in, blocked with so much discipline"
"into the gap at cover off the leading edge. Full around middle and leg, Ashwin closes the bat face early and some late away movement too"
"short, but keeps a tad low, 135 kph, drifts down leg"
"back of a length around off, nicely behind the line, 135 kph"
"down leg again. Short down leg, Ashwin misses a ramp to fine leg. May be an intentional ploy"
"too early through the pull. Back of a length down leg, Ashwin looks to pull, but fails to connect, struck on the glove. Smashed on the wrist"
"back of a lenth outside off, 136 kph, defended. And that will be lunch on a thoroughly absorbing morning of Test cricket"
"oh my, oh my, oh my. His concentration was sensational for two hours today, but a break has nullified all that hard work. A length delivery outside off seams away late, and seams away a lot. But Pujara goes after it, gets a thick outside edge straight to du Plessis at second slip! A needless waft if ever there was one. India in downright trouble now."
"walks down right away, full outside off, Pandya gets a thick outside edge which flies through the vacant slip region. His first ball in SA goes down for four"
"well played then, 127 kph, on a length around middle and leg, comes down slightly and pushes to mid-on"
"drifts down leg, wide in ODIs. Ashwin has walked across so far he can't get bat on it"
"on a length around off, 128 kph, defended back"
"full outside off, 128 kph, doesn't seam much but that's the perfect length. Defended to point"
"walks right across, Steyn tries to hit leg stump but misses. Can't really do that to Steyn's pace"
"full delivery outside off, on-driven to mid-on. Good bowling, sticking with the full length with square leg back. Pandya a real candidate for lbw and caught in the slips"
"phew! What chance does Pandya have to play that so early in the innings? Full delivery around off, the ball pitches and jags away. Pandya looks to flick through midwicket instead of play straight and is beaten"
"given, <strong>but Pandya reviews immediately</strong>. Pandya thinks the ball has hit the back thigh, but is it possible for it to hit the outside edge as well? It sure is, but not in this case. It's another jaffa of a delivery from Steyn, back of a length on off, Pandya's bat face is again closed, it clips the back thigh en route to the keeper. Good review but he has to straighten that bat face to Steyn"
"it closes again. This is not the best technique <strong>against a bowler who takes the ball away</strong> from a right-hander. How quickly can he adjust? Full on middle and leg, he looks to work the ball through square leg but the ball hits his body, opening him up"
"drifts down leg, can't lay bat on that. Steyn slowly returning to the top of his game"
"good length on middle and leg, pushed away towards mid-on"
"ooh, Philander will be happy with that stroke. Full and banana-swinging away, Ashwin goes wafting, pushed to point. No need to play unless it's a positive stroke"
"127 kph, good length outside off, slightly shorter than the previous one, defended"
"full and wide, left alone"
"it was never going to be far away. It was awful batting, poking at balls with the sole intent of defending. He had been doing it through this over, but against Philander, one ball will move away more than usual and find the edge, which is why you have to leave as many as you can. Full delivery outside off, it seams away and finds the edge of Ashwin's loosely-hanging bat! De Kock dives to his right and takes a catch in front of first slip."
"132 kph, full and wide, left alone. That's better. Philander has a word with Saha, possibly asking him to bite some carrots"
"full delivery outside off, drilled through mid-off for a couple. Three away from that follow-on"
"that bat face is coming down at a terrible angle. Rohit, by comparison, was bringing it down dead straight, from first or second slip. But Pandya's is coming from gully, and against Steyn it's very risky. It opens him up again, beaten on the outside edge and struck on the body"
"that's a fine shot. Didn't flick, just punched with the bottom hand. On the pads and shovelled to the midwicket boundary"
"not a bad tactic at all, in fact, it's the right one. Short outside off, Pandya tries to ramp the ball over third man. He bails out slightly to get it fine, because in ODIs third man is there. But in Tests, of which he hasn't played many, there is rarely a third man. He can go after it"
""
"full and straight, 138 kph, slightly straighter bat face which is why he got bat on it, pushed to mid-on, instead of midwicket"
"full around off, defended. Had to play and he does. Saha's technique has to be the best between Ashwin and Pandya"
"full outside off, defended into the off side"
"good length around off, defended away"
"simple batting basics from Saha. Wide outside off, not looking to score, let it go."
"fullish around off, defended into the off side"
"good from Saha. Full and wide, lets it go"
"good length outside off, Pandya looks to punch but misses. Good strategy, wanted to score and went after it."
"good length outside off, outside-halved through third man for four. Played that late"
"<b>dropped by Elgar</b>. Went quickly but that's expected at gully. Short outside off, Pandya punches with hard hands, flies off the outside half, to Elgar's left. The ball bursts through."
"India seven down! Steyn is pumped. Saha reviews. All this needs to do is clip any part of the stump. Full delivery outside off, it doesn't swing or seam or move. It just keeps going straight. Saha leaves it and is rapped on the back leg in front of off. PLUMB in front. Three reds on HawkEye. India have lost all their reviews. Faf hugs, not kisses, Steyn."
"full delivery outside off, Bhuvneshwar beaten on the outside edge. Seams away late. This is unplayable. The previous one didn't move, this one does. Amazing bowling"
"short delivery around middle and leg, played quietly into the leg side"
"well played. Full delivery outside off, moving away. Pandya drives over mid-off for four. Very intentional. Good execution"
"good length and wide outside off, moves away very late, like the Pujara one. Left"
"nicely done again, four more. Short and wide, slashed behind point for four. Could be crucial runs, reducing this lead"

"full and wide again, 143 kph, asking Bhuvneshwar to drive but he isn't interested just yet. Left alone"

"just past the stumps. 146 kph, full outside off, inside-edged past the stumps for a run to deep square leg"
"short again around off, Bhuvneshwar ducks very quickly"
drifts down leg again. Occasionally loses his line
"off the pad down to fine leg. Looking for the yorker again, the ball pings off the pad down to the fine leg boundary"
nicely played. Gets bat on his upper cut to third man. It's a bouncer that is too high so he just taps it over the slips

blocks a shortish delivery outside off and gets off the mark off his 34th delivery
"ramps it over the wicketkeeper. He likes playing that shot but this time it is unintentional. The ball is meant to go to the third man boundary, but it goes off the top edge, and lobs over the long stop placed specifically to catch these"
"back of a length and outside off, cuts to point"
nudges a length ball off middle to deep midwicket

short-arm pull that scurries away to the boundary at midwicket. <b>Brings up the fifty of the partnership and Pandya has made 47 of those runs</b>. Splendid counterattack
good shot and the ball screams away through the covers. A 138 kph delivery pitched up to Bhuvi and he ever so elegantly leans into the drive

"back of a length and outside off, leaves it alone"
"full and outside off, searching for the outside edge, Bhuvi doesn't oblige"

"136 kph, short and wide, smashed away to deep point for one"
"how's that? 141 kph, back of a length delivery outside off, climbs steeply on Pandya. Did he get some glove on it through to de Kock? There is an appeal, but SA aren't sure so they don't take it"

Short and wide, was there for the slot but there is some extra bounce and the top edge is found. This time, there is a hug and a kiss from du Plessis. To put this innings into context, India are still well behind SA. The game may have been over without it."

"140 kph, good length outside off, Elgar withdraws his bat quite late, off the edge to third slip, straight down"
"nicely done. 138 kph, on a length around off, defended away"
"good length outside off, Markram stays back and punches through cover. Let the ball come to him. Bhuvneshwar isn't the quickest, so he has to be fuller"
"looks for that same shot again. Short and wide, the ball swinging away, off the outside edge through gully. <strong>A thick outside edge</strong>, drove at it with hard hands"
"nice front foot stride to defend, full around off, blocked"
"good length around off, 129 kph, another push to cover"
"good length but on the pads, worked to square leg"
"nicely bowled again, full around off, hardly any movement. Markram defends."
"good single, on the pads, nudged towards square leg. Dhawan is there, banished from the slips. Kohli is not happy there is one"
"inside-edged through square leg for a couple more. Full delivery around off, takes the inside edge."
"great leave. Good length outside off, sees no reason to play so withdraws his bat. Very probing line"
"good length around off, 141 kph, defended back"
"good length around off, seams back in, inside-edged into the body"
"good length around off, 139 kph, making Markram play all the time, excellent over. Defended watchfully"
"good length on the pads, wobbly movement, Elgar is squared up but defends"
"beauty. 130 kph, like the first-innings dismissal. On a length around off, the ball seams away late and beats the bat"
"lovely bowling. Angled away outside off, Elgar pokes at that and beats the bat. He feels he needs to play because Bhuvneshwar can swing the ball both ways"
"on a length around off, 130 kph, defended"
"131 kph, full delivery around off, gets a more positive stride towards the pitch to defend"
"nibble. On a length around off, 130 ks, shovelled towards square leg. That one came back in"
"good length outside off, 140 kph. Markram, this time, gets right behind the line. Slowly increasing in intent these two"
"on the pads and flicked away into the gap for four. Too straight, Markram flicks him away. Saw a gap and found it. Didn't fall over"
"good length around off, 139 kph, defended to mid-on"
"oh yes. Shot! 139 kph, a touch short outside off from Bumrah, Markram stands tall, transfers his weight back as he sees the shorter length and then nails a punch through cover point"
"139 kph, good length outside off, the ball coming back in, blocked away"
"full delivery outside off, 141 kph, pushed to mid-off. Just a hint of seam movement."
"good length, the ball swinging back in, Elgar is behind the line to defend"

"shuffles right across, 132 kph, good length around off, shovelled to square leg"

"good leave. Better line, nice length, around off. Elgar lifts the bat and lets it go"
"134 kph, full delivery outside off, no shot offered"
"full delivery outside off, the ball swings away. That full length drew the drive and that movement beat the bat"
"136 kph, misread the length of that slightly. Full and wide outside off, Markram lets this one go too"
"beautiful again. There is a deep point in place but the ball is caressed through cover. On a length and a tad wide, sliced through cover point. Splendid timing and execution"
"full and wide outside off, 129 kph, left alone. Gets forward this time."
"132 kph, full and wide outside off, another positive leave"
"good length around off, Elgar shuffles across to defend"
"on a length around off, shovelled with that bottom hand to mid-on"
"<b>squares him up</b> with a good length ball from around the wicket. It pitches just outside off, with the angle tempting Elgar to perhaps look at midwicket. But the movement off the pitch forces him to play with a straighter bat. Still he doesn't make contact and gets a shiner on his thigh"
"shortish on off stump, gets right behind it"
"bouncer on middle and leg, Elgar avoids it"
dabs it to cover to retain strike. <b>That's also drinks</b>
<b>gets a little more bounce</b> than Elgar expects as he tries to defuse a back of a length delivery at the body
punches a shortish delivery in front of point for a quick single
pitches it a little further up than he usually does. Markram is careful as he leaves the ball outside off
"gets into the backfoot punch to mid-on a touch too soon and the shortish ball, after stopping in the pitch, wanders out to mid-on"
cracks it to the right of mid-on! There's a smidgeon of risk in taking a ball at the top of off stump and hitting it through that region - especially with how he brings his bat around his front pad. But Pandya isn't quick enough to bring lbw into play
"stands tall behind the short ball and since it gives him just the tiniest bit of room, he is able to slice the ball to the sweeper cover"
"fullish and outside off, from around the wicket. Elgar ignores it"
"<b>falls short</b> of Rohit at gully, diving to his right. Elgar tries to ride the bounce of a shortish delivery in the corridor. And he just about pulls it off."
"<b>ripper</b>! He's in better rhythm this innings, finding movement off a pitch that is flattening out. Elgar is flat-footed as he searches for the ball in the corridor and it just holds the line and beats the outside edge"
"shortish and outside off, blocks towards point"
defends a back of a good length ball at 138 kph just outside off
looks a little ungainly but he meets the shortish delivery on middle with the middle of his bat
"short and wide, Markram smacks it to the sweeper cover"
"<b>that's better</b>. Bowls a fuller length, gets the ball to cut in off the pitch, and Elgar, defending with soft hands does well to front up to the threat"
"full and outside off, Elgar is drawn into a drive to mid-off"
"good length, angled across the left-hander. Elgar leaves"
yanks the bat out of the way of a shortish delivery outside off
slices a short and wide delivery to the sweeper cover
works a back of a length delivery to midwicket
"brings his bat around his front pad, while caught in the crease, and the ball that keeps low takes the toe end to midwicket"
lands a yorker just outside off and Elgar glides it to gully
"takes on the bouncer and swats it to the square leg boundary. Beautiful swivel pull, allowing the ball to come to him and absolutely smashing it off the middle"
another pull - this one through midwicket. Elgar is loathe to let India bowl short at him. Or he knows good length balls are still moving around on this pitch
appeal for lbw - but it struck Elgar far too high. Probably pitched outside leg as well with Shami going back over the wicket. Flick shot doesn't quite work in terms of getting Elgar runs
ferocious hit through cover. Brings up South Africa's fifty in the 15th over. And this is the kind of shot that dulls the spirits of the bowlers. It's a good length ball. It comes onto the bat. it doesn't move one bit. And Markram lays into it
"back of a length on off stump, blocks"
covers the line of a shortish delivery just outside off
"shortish and outside off, ignores it"
"full on off stump, keeps it out"
"<b>top edge</b> and it's taken at point. Pandya pulls it off, again. This is his staple length. Short of good. And it offers Markram no room to free the arms. Yet the batsman wants to take it on. He plays what is a mangled version of a shot - half a pull, half a flick - and watches the ball settle into Bhuvneshwar's hands"
"flat outside off, the slider. No turn. Left alone"
"off the outside half down to third man for a couple. Flat outside off, a hint of turn. Sliced away. Elgar eager for two"
"inside-edged. 85 kph, quick on middle and leg, Elgar plays the line, off the edge to deep square leg"
"just short of Kohli at first slip. Flight outside off, Rabada edges it but it lands in front. Kohli says so himself"
"quick outside off, fired in, defended towards point"
"quick around off, Rabada watches the ball onto his bat as he defends"
"lovely shot. All that hard work and he has earned this. Full on middle and leg, Elgar just flicks him through midwicket. Too easy"
"full delivery outside off, 133 kph, dabbed towards gully."
"inside-edged into the pad. Full delivery outside off, Elgar drives but gets a thick inside edge into his pad."
"Pandya strikes, and it's the main man, Elgar. Pandya is having a stunner of a day. Full delivery outside off, Elgar goes wafting, gets a thick outside edge and straight to the keeper. Very similar to the first innings. He wasn't really sure of where his off stump was, right through that innings. Didn't need to play at that either. It seemed like Elgar played slightly inside the line too."
"full delivery around off, 132 kph, right behind the line"
"good length outside off, Amla knows very well where his off stump is. Wouldn't have hit the off stump of another set of stumps. Left alone"
"137 kph, good length around off, beaten on the outside edge. Playing the line"
"full outside off, 131 kph, left alone"
"good length outside off, 134 kph, no need to play, left alone"

"off the outside edge. Squirted away for some runs. Good length outside off, just played the line, the ball hit the outside half."
"134 kph, edged but on the bounce to Dhawan at third slip. On a length around off, Rabada again just plays the line"
"full outside off, 131 kph. Amla is behind the line solidly as ever"
"full around off, making Amla play which is so important. Defended"
"full and straight again, 131 kph, off the outside half towards mid-on. Closed the bat face too early"
"nicely bowled, really good bowling, around off, the ball seaming back in, inside-halved to square leg"
"130 kph, that's a bit full and Amla dead-bats it away"
"that's on the pads and Amla will take that. Flicked away through midwicket with nonchalant ease. Doesn't miss out on a bad ball, even at this time of the evening"
"goes through Rabada. On a length around off, Rabada plays the ball with a closed bat face but the ball beats Rabada on the outside edge"
"135 kph, good stop by Rohit, diving away to his right. Good length outside off, a thick outside edge dies towards Rohit at gully, who dives to his left"
"good length outside off, pushed in front of point. A long run. Rabada says 'yes'. Amla says 'nooooo'. Guess who wins?"
"131 kph, good length on middle and off, pushed to mid-off"
"133 kph, they don't run again. A low full toss on middle and leg, flicked away towards wide mid-on, where Bumrah dives to his left. Amla and Rabada are both mid-pitch before going back to their creases"
"good length outside off, beaten on the outside edge. And that is stumps on day 2."
"pretty full and homing in on off or just a shade outside from over the wicket, Amla answers with a forward-defensive"
"good length and holds its line in the corridor, Amla does not bother with it"
"full, gentle outswinger outside off, Amla shoulders arms to this too"
"back of a length and angling in at the top of off, Amla stands up tall and punchily plays the ball up to mid-on"
Amla gets forward and across to defend this full ball angling in at off stump
"floated outside off, holds its line, Amla keeps leaving these. A maiden to kick off the fourth day"
"good length and angling in but not sharp enough to threaten the off stump, no shot from Rabada"
"hurled in short and attacking the body, Rabada gets a taste of his own medicine. 'Well bowled, Shami,' is the cry from behind the stumps. Rabada hastily flaps this chest-hunting to the leg side"
"Rohit claims the catch, but Amla stands his ground. Was that a clean catch? <b>The soft signal from umpire Gough is out</b>. Back of a length and speared outside off, Amla chases the ball away from the body and looks to punch it through the covers but his foot is nowhere near the pitch of the ball. The slow-mo's on TV are blurred, the evidence isn't conclusive enough. The ball dies sharply on Rohit, he bends low and takes it with both hands? Kohli is pumped. Think TV umpire Reiffel will go with the soft signal. And yes, he sends Amla on his way and India find the early wicket they were looking for on day four. Loose, loose shot from Amla, though, having a crack at a ball that was pushed on a sixth-seventh stump line outside off"
"full and nibbling in on off, <strong>Shami hits 140ks</strong>, tapped down to mid-on"
"back of a length and on a fourth-stump line, AB camps back and forces it to the covers"
"good length and on the fourth-stump line again, AB presses forward and defends it back to the bowler"
"Bhuvneshwar goes past the outside edge. Good length and slanting away outside off, a crease-bound Rabada wafts and misses"
"Bhuvneshwar attacks the off stump now, Rabada inches forward and plays it back to the bowler"
"back of a length and floated on the hips, tucked around the corner to deep square leg"
"Bhuvneshwar shortens his length and pushes it outside off, AB presses forward and blocks with his head over the ball"
"fuller than a good length and angling in at off stump, AB ventures forward and across as he defensively pushes the ball to mid-on"
"good length and slanting in, Bhuvneshwar finds extra bounce, AB deals with it well enough. He loosens his grip and pats it down"
"<strong>Shami now beats the outside edge </strong>near the splice of the bat. Good length, angling in from wide of the crease, and straightening past the hanging bat in the corridor"
"pitched up and holding its line outside off, Rabada has a really short stride, but pushes it out to the covers"
"excellent carry for Shami, again! Good length and pushed on a sixth-seventh stump line outside off, it straightens past the outside edge again as Rabada searches for the ball with his hands"
"<strong>Shami keeps threatening Rabada's outside edge</strong>. He ventures wide of the crease, Rabada plays for the angle but Shami straightens it away"
"good length and pushed outside off, Rabada shows restraint and shoulders arms now"
"wide of the crease, angling in at the top of off, Rabada hangs back and blocks it"
"edged but drops short of Kohli at first slip. Full and Bhuvneshwar explores the channel, AB jabs at it but does so with soft hands"
"dangled up outside off, swings in, AB drives early and nearly scoops a return catch"
"shorter on top of off, tip and run to short midwicket.<strong> AB gets off the mark after nine balls</strong>"
"full and nibbling away with the angle from over the wicket, Rabada lets it pass. Plenty of encouragement for the bowlers from the cordon"
"<b>A mix-up between the wickets</b>, AB dishes out a desperate dive at the non-striker's end, but Vijay can't throw down the stumps at the keeper's end from midwicket. Rabada was much slower, Vijay could have targetted him"
"ooooh, that's regal from AB! This was full on off stump, he strides out, twirls his wrists and whips it away through the vacant spaces at midwicket. There's no stopping that"
"Shami continues to trouble Rabada with the angle from round the wicket. Good length, angling in, and then tailing away past the edge"
"hurled full outside off, Rabada aims a loose drive and is beaten on the outside edge yet again"
"another streaky drive from Rabada, but the e<strong>dge drops short of gully (Rohit)</strong>. Very full and wide outside off, Rabada reaches out with his hands and gets away"
"good length and on off, Rabada presses forward in defence"
"Edged and Kohli takes it. He throws the ball onto the ground and celebrates wildly. The India captain moved to his right from second slip and snapped it up in front of Pujara at first slip. Shami digs it shorter and gets it to tail away outside off, Rabada is squared up. He flaps a catch behind. He is facing midwicket by the time Kohli grabs the catch. Shami reaps reward for attacking the outside edge. Both batsmen from day two have been dismissed early on day four"
"back of a length and zipping through outside off, Faf lets it pass"
just short of a good length and hits the splice as opposed to bat hitting ball. The ball dribbles to the covers
"full and holds its line outside off, AB ignores"
"edged, but does not carry to Saha behind the wicket. Good length, there's that exaggerated angle from Bumrah. He finds extra bounce and snake away from the batsman. Replays indicate that the ball actually hit the arm and dropped in front of Saha"
"short, wide, flayed away to deep point"
Saha nearly takes this ball in front of his face. Bumrah hits the deck hard and gets it to thud into the gloves of Saha as the batsman ignores
"full, wide of the crease, angling in but poses no danger to the off stump. Left alone"
"Shami is cranking it up. Short and hits the pitch hard, the ball climbs through outside off. AB lets it go"
"full and angling in, poked into the covers"
"AB makes it look as easy as eating a sandwich. Shami goes short and outside off, AB arches his back and ramps it over the cordon. The ball sails over the third-man boundary"
"pitched up and just a shade outside off, AB covers his off stump and lets it pass"
"short and angling in on off, AB camps back and tips it to the right of mid-on for one"
"full and holds its line outside off, no shot"
"good length and Bumrah probes away outside off, AB hoists his bat above his shoulder and lets it go"
"back of a length and wider outside off, left alone"
"dragged shorter and outside off, AB chops it away square through the off side"
"<strong>that's a ripper from Bumrah</strong>! How do you play this? Absolutely unplayable to be honest. Good length at 141ks, bursts off the pitch, and angling into Faf. He presses forward thinking it's a simple length ball but is surprised by the extra bounce and loosens his grip but the ball catches the top glove and flies through to Saha. What a brute of a ball from a Test debutant and a man playing his first first-class match after a year. #ScenesinNewlands"
"full and attacking the stumps, nearly 140ks, de Kock gets forward and pushes it back"
"short and on off, fended off to square leg off the back foot"
another mix-up between the wickets! Tip and run to short cover. Poor call from AB. There was never a single there. Dhawan swoops down on the ball but can't nail the stumps at the keeper's end. He reprieves De Kock
"back of a length on off, fended onto the pitch"
"back of a length and angling away outside off, de Kock leans back and punches to backward point"
"full and holds its line outside off, de Kock presses out and drives to mid-off"

"<strong>Bumrah keeps hitting the splice</strong>. Good length, rears up, AB yanks his bottom hand off the bat and fends it to cover"
"short, wide, AB crunches a cut, but there's deep point to mop it up"
"wide of the crease, angling in, straightening to take the outside edge and squirm away between gully and backward point"
"<strong>biiiiig nip-backer from Bumrah</strong>. Terrific ball. Saha goes up for a caught-behind appeal. Saha moves to his right and grabs it in front of his head. Top catch. Ultra Edge detects a spike. Umpire Kettleborough has to reverse his on-field not-out decision. De Kock has to go, and Kohli is pumped. Back of a length, starts outside off, and seams back in sharply. The batsman pushes outside the line and inside-edges it behind"
"very full and outside off, Philander presses forward and drives through the line to cover"
"back of a length, starts outside off and seams back in at the fourth stump, no shot"
"back of a length and holds its line outside off, jabbed to backward point"
"full and outside off, AB goes hard on a drive, loses his shape, and stabs it down to mid-off"
"full and angling into the pads, glanced away past the right of long leg"
"AB strides out to meet this half-volley outside off. That's the perfect off drive, but Dhawan throws himself to his right from mid-off to intercept the ball"

"just short of a good length and outside off, AB chops away from the body and watches the inside edge bounce over the stumps"

"fuller ball to end the over, pitches outside off and driven towards cover to see the over off"
"back of a length outside off, AB goes back and punches towards extra cover. Balanced shot"
"full outside off, and AB brings out a crunching drive off the front foot, but straight to Pandya at cover. The fielder got his body behind the ball, and the ball bounces off his hands. Slight misfield, allowing them to take the single"
"full on off stump, Philander's quick to rock back and block off the back foot. Firmly played"
"<b>big shout for lbw! And given! Philander's reviewing straight away.</b> On the length between full and good, lands on off stump and moves into the right-hander after pitching, Philander's playing down the wrong line as the ball smacks his front leg. Impact in front of middle, and the ball would've gone on to crash into leg stump. He's got to go and South Africa lose a review."
a beauty first up! Good length just outside off and nips back into Maharaj. Goes just past the top of off stump as the batsman shoulders his arms
"full on middle and leg, and Maharaj misses the flick! Another big lbw appeal, and not out says the umpire. <b>Kohli's reviewing.</b> Pitched on middle but drifting too much down the leg side. Missing leg stump by an inch or two. India lose a review."
"width offered outside off, and he slashes uppishly at it. In the air slightly, but lands short of deep point"
"back of a length outside off, no footwork from Maharaj as he tries to cut, too close to his body for the shot. Misses it  completely"
"short outside off but angling into Maharaj's body, forces him to duck"

"back of a length outside off, firmly tapped past the bowler to mid off. No run on offer"
"good length outside off, and nips away from de Villiers after hitting the deck. He attempts to defend off the back foot but played completely inside the line. Bumrah appeals for the caught behind jokingly because of the big change in the ball's direction"
"full outside off stump, and it's defended off the front foot to point"
"full outside off and it's crunched off the front foot. Big stride forward and a full flow of the bat. Off the middle of AB's bat, and it races away to the point boundary"
"good length on off stump and this time AB tucks it square on the leg side. Clipped off his pads past midwicket, forcing deep midwicket to race towards cow corner. Big chase for the fielder"
"good length outside off, he walks across to the off side, and clips this behind square to deep backward square. Gives Maharaj to face the final ball of the over"

"good length outside off, and it's pulled emphatically! Picks the length early. Pulled over mid off, and it's a boundary"
"<b>Ouch! How useful is the armguard?!</b> Good length on middle stump and Maharaj is stuck between two minds. Thinks of ducking, but he can't because there's not much bounce off the surface. Crashes into his armguard as he gets his eyes off the ball. He's okay"
"good length outside off, back-foot defense from Maharaj, but inside edge onto his pads"
"back of a length outside off, Maharaj tries to defend off the back foot, but plays too far away from his body, inside edge ricochets onto his chest"
"short outside off, and going further away after hitting the surface. Deviates after pitching, and left alone by Maharaj"
"good length outside off and Maharaj slashes at it away from his body. Thick top edge, over the slip cordon, as it crashes into the third-man boundary"
"fixes his line on this occasion. Good-length ball just outside off stump, angling into his body, blocked off the front foot"
"good length outside off and another pull from the batsman, it's played along the carpet, but pinged hard enough. Misfield from Dhawan at midwicket, as the ball goes between his legs, allows them to take the second"
"short and wide outside off, and Maharaj pulls out of a big wind up. Soars over his head"
"<b>feather edge, and taken by the keeper!</b> Full outside off and Maharaj goes fishing at this wide ball, takes a tiny edge as the ball goes past his bat. Pouched easily by Saha, his ninth dismissal for the match."

"full ball on middle stump, angling away from the left-hander, tries to drag this towards the leg side, but inside edge onto his pads"
"short on leg stump, and Morkel gets his bat in front of his face in an attempt to block the ball. Takes the top of his bat, as the ball lobs over to the keeper. <b>That's Saha's tenth dismissal of the match, an India record for a single Test.</b>"
"full on a fourth-stump line, nicely defended off the back foot. Covers his off stump by walking across, and taps it towards the off side"
"full ball on middle stump, attacking ball on this occasion. Clipped off his toes towards the leg side"

nice and full but slanting down the leg side past Vijay's attempt to glance it away fine past the keeper
"full inswinger from Philander, Vijay plays around his front pad but this is nipping down the leg side. Vijay and Dhawan sneak a leg bye"
"Philander drags his length back and goes down the leg side again, this time to the left-hander. Dhawan lets it go"
"just short of a good length and on a fourth-stump line, cramps Dhawan for room. He aims to punch it through the covers. Instead, he stabs the ball straighter to mid-off"

"full tempter, wobbling away in the corridor, Dhawan isn't tempted (yet). Left alone"

"good length and angling in at off stump, Vijay gets forward and defensively dabs it to midwicket"
"Philander belts out an appeal for lbw, umpire Kettleborough raises his finger. If Vijay has not nicked it, he is trapped in front. The ball hits the flap of the front pad but Vijay had ventured a fair way forward and across. The tracker, though, suggests it would have bounced over. Kohli is off his seat, clapping in the change room. The on-field out decision has been reversed. This was full and slanting in to catch Vijay on the shuffle. Good review from India in the end - it was Dhawan who prompted Vijay into going for the review"

"Morkel tests the middle of the pitch and flings a bouncer, the batsman ducks under it"

Vijay presses forward to defend this full ball on off stump to mid-on
"<strong>What a strange shot from Vijay</strong>. Has he nicked off, and up goes the finger. Vijay, though, calls for a review almost immediately. Ultra Edge detects no touch from the bat. No nick. Replays suggest Vijay's bat hit the front pad. He shimmies down the track for a big drive but the ball jags away past the outside edge. The opener is saved by DRS again"

"back of a length on off, Pujara hangs back and fends it down"
