"outstanding shot, as he whisks himself outside leg to slice the ball off middle stump. Quick feet, head balanced, good hands to pick the gap through cover"
"<b>spins past the outside edge to hit the back pad</b>! Gorgeous bowling from Chahal, because he is keeping his pace slow, he is being helped by the cross breeze bringing the ball into the right-hander, and then his wrist gives him the dip and turn to beat Mendis' block"
cuts through cover
nudges through square leg
"places the sweep perfectly, past the left of short fine leg, and well to the right of deep square leg. Outstanding shot - all born from his judgment that this ball is a length ball on leg stump. Once he's read that, and read that early, his class shines through"
drives to long-on to retain strike
"back of a length and outside off, steers it to deep third man"
"<b>that is sensational</b>! Dickwella, for the longest time, is just standing still. Like a harmless statue as the short ball climbs up over his head. Then suddenly, he presents the bat as a ramp for it to ping off of and race to the third man boundary. Jadhav is the fielder, running to his right, puts in the slide, but he's so close to the ropes. The third umpire is checking tons of angles, because the back foot is touching the rope, just after Jadhav flicks the ball back with his right hand. Consideration also has to be given to whether it's hit any other part of his body. It hasn't and so it's only two"
"<b>huge appeal for caught behind</b> as Dickwella sways away from the ball, but tries to ramp it again. <b>Goes off the grille</b> through to the wicketkeeper"
"slower short ball, slanted well outside off, Dickwella tries to cut, but can't reach that far. Pandya's severely frustrated by his error"
cracks a cut to point
"full, wide and slow, so Dickwella, eager to exploit the width, is there with his shot too early. Inside edge wanders to the wicketkeeper and before Dhoni can pose too much trouble, Mendis is across for the single"
clips it off his thigh pad to long leg.
"swings across the line, and manages to get away with it. Sees a little bit of flight on off stump and so indulges in a slog sweep, over midwicket. Risky shot, but he's backing himself, and he wants to upset Chahal, the wicket-taker"
"mid-on came up so that midwicket can go back, and Mendis exploits that now, with a straight bat shot! Excellent cricket. Top-class one-day cricket, as he takes on a tossed up ball and sends it screaming between the stumps and the non-striker"
"now gets the rank long hop, which he pulls to deep midwicket. Looks disappointed as he runs across for a single. Mendis means business today"
"nudges behind square leg, hanging back in his crease and playing with the turn"
"<b>outside edge</b>, but there's no slip. Chahal abandons his followthrough and turns around in disgust. He has done everything asked of him, keeps tossing it up regardless of the boundaries, gets it to dip on the batsman after he had lured him into a careless drive. Only to watch an opportunity go abegging"

"fires in a length ball, with a slingly low arm, lower than usual. Dickwella defends"

low-arm slingy offbreak outside off stump - but it doesn't trouble Mendis at all. Rocks back and cuts to the sweeper
"gorgeous hit! He strides out of his crease, gets a flighted delivery for his trouble, and whips it wide of long-on. Magnificent wristwork to place it left of the fielder"
long hop and it's been dismissed to deep midwicket. Pull shot with some ferocity. And it was set up by the previous trip down the pitch

"short ball, but since Jadhav bowls so slow, the batsman has to make all the pace. That's his biggest USP as a part-timer. Mendis pummels it... for a single to deep midwicket"
"picks the gap between backward point and short third man. Beautiful shot, because Dickwella stays beside the ball, and his quick hands lash it away with enough power to beat Rohit Sharma. Seemed a lethargic chase"
"that's awful! And he's thinking about the review. He takes it! He takes a review after being plumb lbw! Jadhav adds to his legend of picking wickets off innocuous balls. It's that slingshot - low arm, spear in on middle. Dickwella plays a lazy old lapsweep, not keeping in mind this is the rare quicker ball from the part-timer. Struck low on the front pad, in front of middle. Ball-tracking says it would crash into leg stump. Not even umpire's call. An outstanding innings - one that enthralled this packed crowd - ends a little limply and India have an opening.

"he's run right over the ball <b>to be bowled</b>! Axar pulls out a couple of imaginary guns from his pocked to celebrate, and he may well do after this rocket zips through Mendis' defences. The batsman comes charging down, doing so a touch too early, just early enough for the bowler to slip in the quicker ball (104 kph), right into his pads.

Smashes the top of off stump, slipping in via the big gap in number eleven's forward defence. <b><a href='http://www.espncricinfo.com/video/clip?id=20395095' target='_blank'>Watch the wicket here</a></b>.

"full and just outside off, drives to mid-off"
"defends a fullish delivery, straightening away from the angle around the wicket, into the covers"
"<b>ripper</b>! It pitches on off stump and it takes off. Dhawan, standing on leg stump, even beside it, pokes at the ball and is left behind by the seam movement away"
"goes looking for the magic ball, pitching on leg stump and darting away to clip off. All he sees is the ball going wide"
"full on leg, turns it to midwicket"

"full and outside off, Rohit attempts a lazy drive so far away from the body and gets an inside edge"
shifts around the wicket for a back of a length delivery on off stump. Defends
"tucks him up on middle, Dhawan defends to short midwicket"
"half-volley, wide outside off, need I say more? Well fine, I will. Dhawan plays a cover drive and the ball scorches the turf on its way to the boundary"
"shortish on middle, Dhawan blocks"
"an even better cover drive! Because this is a good length ball, close enough to off stump and it demands the batsman to play a good shot. Dhawan is equal to it"

"short and wide, Dhawan flashes and misses"
"full and outside off, Dhawan drives, but he gets an <b>inside edge</b> to long leg. Just enough nibble for the debutant left-arm quick"
"conscious of using the straight bat, as Malinga attacks the stumps and gets the ball to straighten. The ball wanders past the stumps, mid-on dives, doesn't get it. Mid-on goes after it, takes a while to get to it. Meanwhile, both batsmen are at the middle of the pitch wondering if they should go for the single. Or perhaps about how silly Sri Lanka are continuing to be. In the end, they do get it"
<b>sensational fielding</b> at cover by Hasaranga! Dives to his right to get a hand on a brutal cover drive
blocks a back of a length delivery on off stump
drives on the up to short cover
"slower ball, nice and full, and Rohit turns it to square leg"
"defends a good length ball just in front of point and pinches a single. But the bat seems to stick in the pitch and its a <b>direct hit from Kapugedera</b> And would you believe it, he's gone! <b>He's well past the crease, but he's entirely in the air</b>. He is ball watching, then eventually sticks his bat down, trying to drag it to safety but it stuck in the pitch and spilled out of his hand. Sri Lanka have a breakthrough!

"back of a length on off stump, bunts it to mid-off"
"short ball outside off, evades it. There were times in the West Indies where he would go after those shots just for ego's sake. Here he's more circumspect"

defends a good length ball outside off
flicks a full delivery outside off to mid-on
"backs away, gets as tall as he can and slaps a short ball dead square through the off side. Right between the two fielders at point and cover"
"another cut shot, and another boundary. This well behind square. Beautiful cricket from Dhawan, though he isn't being taxed too much. This is a short and wide delivery feeding his great strength. He's 41 off 28 now without even breaking a sweat or taking a risk. Powerplay done."
"takes a full delivery on off stump and whips it past midwicket's right all the way to the boundary. He is taking liberties with the ball, but at the time of contact, even though he is hitting across it, his head is so still and right over its line"

blocks a good length ball to cover
whips a shortish delivery on middle to short midwicket

carves a good length ball with an open face to backward point
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go"

"another bouncer, down leg, Dhawan goes for the hook but this time he misses. Mild appeal for caught behind. Not given by umpire Wilson"

nudges a slower delivery to deep square leg
"haring down the pitch, he turns a flighted delivery into a full toss and smashes it through cover - right through him."

"shapes to late cut, but the ball zips past his outside edge"
gets nice drift into the bat as Dhawan defends on middle
"pulls off a reverse sweep now! he sets up for it early. Sandakan bowls quicker, shorter, and unwittingly helps the batsman out because this is a slow pitch. He can wait for the ball to come and shovel the bat through it to find the third man boundary"
