"full into middle, flicks it through midwicket"
"back of a length and outside off, shoulders arms"
"shortish and outside off, better lines from Taskin, Rahul evades it again"
"plays on! He goes for a drive through cover, seeing a full ball outside off, but it's a pretty loose shot. The footwork isn't there. The weight is on his back foot. Only the hands go into the shot and an inside edge results so that Taskin can exult"
"143 kph, hints of inswing for Taskin as he pitches it up. Pujara is late into his defensive push, and gets an inside edge onto pad"
"decks back in off a grassy pitch at 141 kph, Pujara, on the back foot, defends carefully"
"fuller delivery outside off, Vijay moves across towards the line and then leaves the ball"
"watchful, as he needs to be early in a Test match and though this is a short delivery outside off, the kind that's cut through the line for four, Vijay avoids it"
"gets forward to a fuller ball on off stump, but ends up having to adjust to the ball nipping back in off the pitch."
"the shorter length is easier to deal with, as expected on a pitch with some juice in it for the quicks, early at least. Vijay defends"
nudges a back of a length delivery off his hips towards midwicket
"into the backfoot cover drive a bit too early, and therefore is playing too far in front of his body against this short ball outside off. Inside edge to midwicket"
"143 kph, back of a length and outside off, Pujara leaves, and watches the ball carry through nicely to the wicketkeeper"
strong stride forward to a 143 kph pitched-up delivery outside off and defends it with bat close to pad
"tucks him up with a short delivery, coming up towards his armpits at 136 kph, Pujara defuses it to short leg"
yards of daylight between bat and pad and yet there is an appeal for caught behind from the cordon. Taskin looks absolutely bemused. He knows he lost his line with this shortish delivery down leg. Pujara chooses not to play
"inswing again, Pujara reads it, plays with it, gently past midwicket. That was 90 mph from Taskin, 145-plus kph"
gets up off his toes to make sure he is on top of a shortish delivery on middle and leg. Bunts it down
"the slingy action doesn't affect his ability to get swing. The seam is angled towards the slips, and it swings so late. Vijay manages to put bat to it. But he wasn't necessarily comfortable"
digs it in short immediately after a full ball that made him play away from the body. Good bowling from Rabbi. Vijay picks up the length early and ducks
"back of a length and outside off, Vijay ignores it"
"great timing from Vijay. All he does is lean into a push past point with an angled bat. Two runs off a pretty good ball, on a length and just outside off"
"fuller delivery outside off, with a little swing away, Vijay lets it pass"
"short, wide, asking to be hit and Vijay is all about to oblige before a few alarm bells ring in his head. Not sure why though, if he had hit it hard and then connected with an edge, it would have easily gone over the slips. Anyway, another leave alone"
"another 90 mph delivery from Taskin, pitching short and outside off. Pujara is capably behind it"
"good work from Mominul at short leg, getting behind a flick from Pujara and flicking the ball at the stumps to make sure he hurries back"
"fuller delivery on off stump, tinged with inswing, Pujara defends"
"gets the ball to rise up towards Pujara's throat, and only his soft hands save him. Hits the shoulder of the bat, and he has to take the bottom hand off to control it. Single behind short leg"
"top delivery again, this at 144 kph, all this pace is exceedingly useful when you pitch it short and make the ball jag into the right-hander, off the pitch. Vijay does very well, dropping his wrists and swaying away"
"143 kph, excellent length again, after a couple of short ones, he goes for a good length ball outside off, looking ofr the outside edge, in case Vijay is lead-footed. He isn't. Good leave"
"is he a touch early on the shot? He goes down low to drive a full and wide delivery, and checks his shot as if he isn't entirely comfortable hitting through the line"
"that's a weakness of his, the full ball on the stumps, but Pujara does well, playing close to the body and turning the bat face only on impact for a single to midwicket"
"goes for the short one, but it strays down leg. Easy sighter"
"good bouncer again, on off stump, rising towards his shoulder, hits Vijay on the bottom hand as he gets up tall to defend. Top bowling, but Vijay still gets a single. Bangladesh fielders need to be better in keeping one batsman on strike"
"chancy! Pujara goes for a square drive, away from the body, and a little away swing makes him lose control of the shot a little bit. Gets most of the outside half of the bat for a boundary past gully"
"fuller delivery on off stump, gets forward to block"
roll of the wrists to send an overpitched delivery down towards the long-on boundary. Terrible work by the man at mid-on. Dives right over the ball and lets it through
waits on the shortish delivery outside off and guides it to gully
"ooh, lots of things happen there, and it all begins with a little inswing. Pujara goes for a flick to work with it, but he still gets a leading edge towards point. Wants to get off strike, but this time his partner says no. He's halfway down, on those wonky knees, and has to hurry back"
"back of a length and outside off, steers it square of the wicket on the off side"
"shortish on middle and leg, lets it come on and dabs to long leg"
"plays early again, and it's Pujara's turn to deny the batsman a single off a leading edge. This is a length delivery though, Vijay playing with a closed face, looking for midwicket. Taijul at cover point has had a busy over"
"no feet, all hands, the crack of the inside edge is loud and a source of anguish for the bowler. Rabbi throws his head back, wishing for one of those to canon into the stumps"
"doesn't carry to the man at short leg, there is glove on this fend against a short ball on middle. Superb direction, superb bowling. But Bangladesh's fielders are in the wrong place. On a slow pitch, it seems Mominul is standing too deep"
"gets up off his toes and nudges it behind square leg. More short-pitched bowling, at the body"
"141kph, full on off stump, but it is still just the right kind of ball, Vijay might as well say, to flick to midwicket. Languid wrists"
"shortish on off stump, blocks"
"134kph, bangs it in, Vijay goes for the pull, gets just enough on it for a boundary to long leg. Not entirely controlled"
"good length ball, veers away in the air, but since it is outside off stump, the batsman can leave it"
"gets forward but hides his bat behind pad, respecting a good length ball that curls away in the air. Bangladesh are not giving anything away"
"good length ball outside off, Pujara doesn't bother with it. There's still enough wobble around, so much that Mushfiqur, who has only recently recovered from a finger injury, struggles with it behind the stumps. Tough cricket so far and we're not done with the first hour"
"short and wide, rather tame delivery, but Pujara chooses to be safe than sorry and leaves"
"stays beside a shortish delivery angled in at off stump, defends"
"waits on the back foot, tickles the back of a length ball around the corner behind square leg"
"fuller delivery outside off, gets forward to block. Hits the bat reasonably high"
"<b>falls short of first slip</b>. Gorgeous delivery from Rabbi, getting it to away so late. Pujara is totally deceived, pushing forward to block with hard hands. Think the keeper should have gone for it. Slip was moving to his left, and it was dying on him too"
"good length ball outside off, defends"
"good length ball, with some away movement, Pujara doesn't want any part of it"
"back of a length and outside off, no shot offered"
"a touch too straight and all Pujara has to do is wait, and then flick it to long leg with a roll of the wrists"

"good length ball, on and around fifth stump, Pujara gets forward and watches it shimmy past"
"gets him forward with a fuller ball on off stump, Pujara defends, mindful of the awayswing that he is getting"
"fuller delivery on off stump, pushes it back to the bowler"
"good length ball outside off, ignores it"
"beautiful strike! This four is made by the angle of the bat, and how it isn't as closed. And those small margins were necessary because this is a decent delivery, full on middle. Pujara though just leans over it, and flicks between midwicket and mid-on"
"shortish and outside off, but there isn't as much pace on the pitch, as evidenced by another inside edge. This time Vijay is on the back foot, looking to force a drive through cover"
"doesn't move his feet much, as he goes for a push into the covers. Mahmudullah in the covers flings in a throw at the batsman's end, there is no one backing up"
"pulls to long leg. His line goes awry, and the short ball comes up only at the hip as well. Into his sixth over now, could be why he's missed his mark"
"covers the line of this back of a length delivery on off stump, defends"
"good shot. Stays in line with a short ball, rising just over the stomach. His hands are over the ball, the wrists roll on top of it and the timing is perfect. The one-legged pull through square leg. Majestic"
"good length ball outside off, Vijay shoulders arms and then practices a square drive. That's the first hour done. Bangladesh's quicks have done well to deserve a bit of <b>drinks</b>"
"starts with a slightly shortish delivery outside off, which allows Pujara to hang back and punch past cover's left"
"loops it up now, just outside off, Vijay shapes for a strong drive, but checks his shot to mid-off"
moves back to a good length ball on off stump and blocks it
"comes down the track, but the move is spotted. Mehedi fires it into the pads, and the batsman has to hurry into a flick. Lucky it bursts through short leg's hands. Not that it was a catch, but there may have been a run-out chance"

"good length ball outside off, Rabbi continues into his seventh over and has to watch another one left alone"

"good length ball outside off, leaves it alone"
"tries to dab a shortish delivery outside off behind point, but there really isn't any pace in this pitch for those kinds of shots"
"tosses it up just outside off, Vijay plays with the turn as he flicks to mid-on"
comes down the track to the second ball he faces off Mehedi and blocks
"<b>goes past first slip's right</b>. This is drift. It tails away from Pujara's reach and when he pushes at the ball, the outside edge is taken. Carries, but it was too far from Shakib"
"shortish on middle and leg, clips it through midwicket"
comes forward to the pitch of a flighted offbreak outside off and sends it to short cover
"<b>edges it again</b>, coming low to Shakib's right at slip, off a back foot glide from Vijay. Again too difficult to convert. Lovely length from Mehedi, and he's playing with the batsman's mind, threatening to spin the ball but not really doing it"

stands up tall against a short delivery outside off and punches it through cover
"back of a length, outside off, punches to mid-off"

leaps off his feet to get on top of a short delivery on and around off stump and pulls it to long leg. Gently done
"fuller delivery, coming in late off the pitch, Pujara defends"
stays back to block a good length ball just outside off. Vijay is a little hurried into the stroke because he isn't sure whether the ball will break or not
"defends, just a tad inside the line, as a good length ball takes the outside edge because it doesn't turn as much as Vijay thought"

"tosses it up on middle, drives back to the bowler"
"flatter delivery outside off, Vijay goes back and flicks through midwicket"

gets inside the line of a flighted delivery on leg stump and drives to mid-off
stays back to a pretty full delivery and has to adjust with his hands. Glides it to cover point
"good work from short cover, diving to his left, to stop any runs coming off this back foot punch from Vijay. Maiden over, only the second off the innings. Shows that these two have been comfortable ticking runs. Or have been left to do so"
"comes down the pitch, gets too close to the ball and whips it back at the bowler"
"flatter delivery on middle and off, works it past the bowler's right"
"<b>they've muffed up an easy run-out</b>. Rabbi at square leg does well in the first place to create the uncertainty, diving to his left, but then his throw is only lobbed to the bowler, and it comes on the half-volley to Mehedi, in front of the stumps, who can't collect it. Vijay is safe, and gets a single for his backfoot flick, after looking all at sea. Pujara had taken off for a run like a horse bolting, not realising his partner was nowhere near ready. Vijay even shapes to get back in his crease but by then Pujara was past him and the only option he has is to commit"

"Mehedi is going around the wicket to see if he can dart the ball across the right-hander, and maybe hope for one to spin back. But if he pitches short, with little protection behind point... All Vijay has to do is hang back, wait, and then open the face of the bat"
"a little fuller, but Vijay still exploits the ball aimed past the off stump, guiding the ball behind point"
"good length ball, leaps into the wicketkeeper's gloves as Pujara refuses to play. Touch more bounce than usual there"
"tosses it up on middle and off, Pujara blunts it well"
"takes a short step forward, then a longer one across towards the ball outside off and defends"
gets down the track and drives to mid-off
"full on off stump, swinging into the right-hander, Vijay flicks through midwicket"
"is it reverse swing? Taskin is making the ball tail in late to the right-hander, and it's a sizeable amount of movement too. Vijay blocks"
"<b>definite reverse</b>! And this full toss makes it clear. Starts well outside off stump and then veers sharply into Pujara, who gets an inside edge while trying to drive through cover. Meanwhile, Taskin has overstepped"
"short and wide, Pujara doesn't care for it"
"back of a length and outside off, Pujara is happy to wait on his back foot and dab it behind point"
accounts for the reverse swing into his pads and flicks to square leg
"that's a good ball, especially with the ball reversing. It's full, outside off, and holds its line. The ball that doesn't swing can also be dangerous in these conditions. Pujara does well not to premeditate and drives to mid-off"
"<b>outside edge</b>, scurries past the reach of a wide first slip. This is reverse swing, away from the bat. Bump ball though, so this wasn't really a chance. Into the nineties"
"the lack of fielders at point and behind him is too tempting for Vijay as he goes for a reverse sweep. Even good length balls are sitting up on this slow pitch, allowing the batsman to do what he wills. Taskin fields it by digging his boot into the ball. Risky, for his own fitness"
stays back to a good length ball on off stump and blocks
"he is hustling across for a single, but why does he bother? <b>Most runs in an Indian first-class season</b>, going past Chandu Borde's 1604. Gets to the mark with a belligerent off drive. Vijay knew it was a boundary immediately. Didn't even run"
"but he's gone right after the record, trying to defend, gets a thick outside edge, which hits the top flap of the wicketkeeper's pad and jumps up for him to have a second grab. Musfiqur has the presence of mind to watch it all the way as he dives to his right"
"a gift to the Indian captain for his hospitality. It's short, wide, and cut away in front of point. No need for technique. Just pure power"
"full, outside off, swings away as well, it's reverse. Vijay goes into the nineties with an unintentional glide past wide first slip"
"sends down a yorker just outside off, Vijay plays late, the worry being reverse swing, but manages to keep it out"
"fuller delivery on middle and off, Kohli gets across to it and flicks towards midwicket"
"clatters it past the bowler's left. Not entirely the worst ball, and it even seems like Kohli checks his drive. But it came straight off the middle and went straight to the long-off boundary"
"good length ball outside off, lunges forward to leave"
"back of a length on off stump, Kohli covers the line, and puts bat to ball even if it keeps low"
"tosses it up outside off, from over the wicket again, Vijay is forward with a defensive push. Gets an outside edge past point"

"good length on off stump, Vijay stays in line with it and clips towards midwicket"
"well flighted on off stump, Vijay taps it past the non-striker's right to long-on"
"good length on leg stump, the line makes the shot as Kohli flicks through to deep square leg and gets a couple for his trouble"
gets across in line with a flighted delivery on off stump and directs it to midwicket
"back of a length and outside off, Vijay ignores it"
"shortish and outside off, Vijay covers his stumps and leaves"
"this doesn't bounce, it was meant to with Taskin digging the ball into the middle of the pitch. Vijay, shuffling across, and then trying to drop his wrists has to drop them away down, and move his head out of the way to avoid getting hit"
"good length, outside off, shoulders arms"
"shortish and outside off, defends"
"back of a length and outside off, pushes it into the covers"

"short again and Vijay, hanging back, plays a neat little late cut to deep third man"
"flighted delivery outside off, Kohli defends"
moves back to a flatter ball outside off stump and blocks. Went straight on with the arm that
flicks a tossed up delivery from outside off to mid-on. Got to the pitch of the ball to do all that shenanigans
"quicker, straighter delivery on off stump, Kohli is able to negotiate it easily enough, staying back and flicking towards square leg"
"shortish and outside off, no shot offered"
"full and outside off, Kohli goes for that forceful drive into the off side. Plays the shot a touch too early and gets a thick inside edge towards mid-on"
"short and outside off, Kohli lets it carry on to the wicketkeeper"
"full and wide outside off, Kohli resists the temptation"
"bouncer, aimed at the batsman's badge, Kohli swivels on his back foot and pulls to long leg. Rolls his wrists to keep the ball down. Not entirely well timed, but the intentions were good"
"another short one, the line is straight and considering the ball is 55 overs old, it won't balloon over the batsman. It will force him to take evasive action, even one nearing a hundred."
"brings Kohli forward with a good length ball on off stump, clips it to midwicket"
"places the drive between mid-off and cover, lunging forward towards the pitch of the ball to hit against the turn"

"good length ball on off stump, defends"
shifts back to a good length ball and works the ball through midwicket
"comes down the track, having seen mid-on and mid-off up, and ends up too close to the ball. Jams down on it and sends it back to the bowler. Doesn't look happy. He thought he had an excellent chance for a hundred"
"tosses it up onto middle from around the wicket, Kohli gets inside the line and drives to mid-off"
"pushes it through on leg stump, Kohli glances it to long leg"

"flights it onto the off stump, blocks"
moves back and blocks towards cover
"nudges it to midwicket and that's tea, with Vijay on 98, two short of his ninth Test hundred, and his third in this season. Meanwhile, the crowd chant Kohli's name, he's only on 17. Funny."

"stays short of a length, just outside off, angling in, defended off the back foot"
tries the change-up full ball but strays on the pads and Kohli clips him away for a couple
"length ball outside off, left alone"
driven uppishly on the up but bang in the gap between cover and mid-off. Kohli looks in ominous touch here
"Kohli looking to dominate. This is short and wide, but doesn't quite come on. Kohli still throws his arms at it, and deliberately plays it up and over. The focus is not on hitting the ball hard but clearing the infield, which he does. The timing does the rest"
"full on the pads, can't beat the man at midwicket. Stays on 98"
"short, really slow, he goes back to work it square on the leg side to reach 99"

"on a length, just outside off, pushed to mid-off"

slinks back into his crease to force a shortish delivery on off stump back down the pitch
"tosses it up onto middle and leg, Kohli brings the front foot forward, but keeps it out of the way of the angled bat. No runs to point. Oh, but wait, we have a <b>Bangladesh review</b> for lbw? That's going to be shot down. Ball hit the middle of the bat"
"the line makes him play the sweep, seeing a ball drifting into leg stump. The length, however, is too full for the shot and therefore he gets mostly pad on it towards fine leg"
"flatter delivery outside off, punches it to cover"
"hacks it past mid-on, and the outfield takes care of the rest. Not one of his usually elegant strokes. This is just, get-the-job-done slog. Aimed to hit it over the fielder, but the ball was too full"
"pushes it through on off stump, Vijay opens the face to run it down to third man"
"short and wide, too easy for Vijay to line up and cut to deep point. That's the fifty partnership"

"good length ball, pitching outside off, Kohli doesn't bother with it"
gets forward to block a length ball on off stump and places it to the left of cover
"drifts a quicker delivery onto middle, Vijay keeps it out"
"bowled around the legs! Poor execution of the lap sweep. A touch too full for the shot in the first place, but having made the move to plant his front leg outside off to avoid lbw, and get into the position he needs to play off the stumps, he does not make any connection. That means the ball has a free path to skip along and hit middle. Top innings from Vijay, bit of a silly end though."
"tosses it up on middle, Rahane defends with soft hands"
leans into the tossed up delivery and blunts it
"the intent may be good, but the length is not. Short again on off stump, Kohli punches to long-on"

"loops the ball up on off stump, Kohli is a match for it"
"shifts his weight back against a short ball and drills it through cover for his 1000th Test run this season, in nine matches"

moves back and cuts another shortish delivery towards point

"works a well flighted delivery past short leg's reach, realises there aren't many fielders there then and takes a single"

"tosses it up on off stump, Kohli ticks it to long-on for more easy runs. Can't remember him being in any trouble in this innings.

Since hitting his first ball for a boundary, and possibly his fourth too, he's just rolled on"

"drifting into the pads, Kohli, again, looms over the ball, and then flicks it behind square leg for a couple. Deft little touches for rich reward"
"fuller delivery outside off, pushes it through the covers to bring up the fifty stand. Kohli's made 37 of the runs"

that's a mis-hit! Kohli gets into a flick too early and the good length ball holds its line and takes the leading edge. Flies over the man at short cover

"back of a length delivery and outside off, slides off the open face to deep third man"

"gets a leading edge as he tries to punch a good length ball towards mid-on. Has the single he wants though, just through cover"
"full on off stump, drives it back past the bowler to the long-on boundary. Tough on Mahmudullah, the fielder who chases it from mid-on. He went for the slide, but his knee dug into the pitch and doesn't let him get to the ball. Could easily have injured himself"

drives fluently to the left of mid-off
"whip through midwicket, and <b>there's the hundred</b>! The sound off simply the crack of his wrists must have been deafening. Other players might have hit that through cover, considering the ball was tossed up well outside off. Top shot. Effortless hundred"

"good length ball outside off, lets it go"
leans forward to block a fuller delivery on middle

"a newish cherry pitches on a good length, a touch outside off, maybe fifth stump, Kohli avoids it"
"a little shorter in length and that's why Kohli goes for it, with a straight bat, pushing the wide ball into the covers"
"they look for something extra, appealing to the square leg umpire after the short leg fielder covers the inside edge and flicks the ball back onto the stumps. Rahane is safe though. His balance was taking him out of the crease after defending at an inswinger, a very full, lovely inswinger from Taskin. Nicks it to Mominul, but is quicker than the throw"
"smacks a length ball through the covers, what a shot. Just stood and delivered. No swing there. No reason to worry about hitting through the line. There is a sweeper"
"back of a length delivery climbs on Kohli a bit, and it's a touch closer to his body than he thinks. Gets a bit of an inside edge onto boot"

"a shade short and Rahane is back, standing tall to whip it behind square leg"
"loops it up on middle, Kohli smothers it"

"flighted delivery on off stump, Kohli blocks with bat close to pad"
"makes him push at a tossed up delivery outside off, Kohli controls it well though for a single to sweeper cover"
"up and over, and Kohli has hit it to the left of the man at deep point, opening the face to make sure he avoids being caught. Short, wide, slashed"
"now to the right of point. This is a better shot, more along the ground, but fully in control. That's probably because the short ball doesn't rise, and it gives Kohli all the freedom to cut"
"full and outside off, Kohli pushes to cover. Phew. He looks ominous enough to look at <i>more</i> than a double-ton"
"good length ball, angling it into the off stump at 139 kph, Kohli's front foot strays across, but the knee doesn't bend so that he has the room to bring his bat down in line with the ball"

hits through the line of a fuller delivery outside off. Short cover comes in handy
"that's the slider, pitched short intentionally to make the batsman go back, but on this slow pitch, all its venom is sucked out. Rahane is easily able to flick to short midwicket"
"good length, on and around sixth stump, Kohli lets it fly by"
"good length and outside off, no shot needed"
beautiful shot. It's on the up. It's away from the body. It's dangerous but it is so supremely controlled that it seems every player in the world should be playing it. Like it's the easiest shot in the world. What a cover drive. Sabbir on the boundary has tons of work to do and he doesn't shirk the responsibility
"charges at Taskin, who spots it early and slants the ball wide of Kohli's reach, who admits to being one-upped and leaves"
"amazing timing. And all it took was a little roll of the wrist. It is perhaps a touch too full, if anything is wrong with it. Kohli looms over it, defining its destiny with an on-drive."
"and the fast bowler's response to seeing a good ball smacked away, the bouncer. Kohli expects it and ducks under"
"tosses it up outside off, Rahane stretches forward to block."
"shortish, just straightening outside off, Rahane backs away from it and cuts to cover"
"full toss, giving Rahane a free tilt at it. Gets to fifty with a swat over mid-on. Relief on his face as he looks skyward and raises his bat. Fine innings. Looks good for more."
comes forward on off stump and pushes the flighted delivery back at the bowler
"slots it full on off stump, gets the straight bat in response"
a touch too wide to interest Rahane.
"pulls in front of square, oof, and I thought he was a touch cramped. Just got on top of the short ball, coming up towards his chest, but he nails it nonetheless"
"another short ball, this one pushed into the middle stump, so Kohli shuffles across and helps it to long leg. Not entirely in control of this though. A littler quicker in pace, Taskin, and a little more bounce to gain a bit of a top edge"
"he does play the upper cut well, and with third man not there... In the end, the bounce is just enough for Taskin to come away with a dot ball"
"this short ball doesn't rise and Rahane pulls it imperiously to square leg. The front leg coming up, the middle of the bat taking a pounding."
"helps it to the third man boundary. Everything happened in slow motion there. This short ball blobs up off the pitch, all its pace swindled from it. Kohli hangs back and carves it over the gully fielder. No third man"
"back of a length on off stump, Kohli taps and runs to mid-on, who takes a shy at the stumps and the backing up is poor. Two runs, when there should have been none. Kohli toying with the Bangladesh fielders, who are all worried about giving away boundaries, standing as deep as they could"
goes back and blocks a flatter delivery on off stump
"drives fluently to long-off, a loopy ball just outside off enabling the shot"
"good length, on off stump, Kohli defends"

"keeps the bat straight and rolls the wrist only at the point of impact, in an effort to beat short midwicket. But he cant"
"lunges forward outside off, he comes forward and blocks"

"pushes it through on middle, defends"
"tosses it up int leg stump, Jadeja pats it past short leg and he jets off for a single. That's audacious. And then an overthrow from the fielder, with Mahmudullah just standing there, by the stumps, not caring about anything, gives up another"

"full, middle and off, defended off the front foot"

nice dip as Taijul slows it down. Defended off the front foot
"moves back against a length ball, which doesn't turn, and pats it down"
"a little shorter in length allows Jadeja the liberty to cut, but not before he makes a little room to free the arms"

"too short, too straight, sits up on this slow pitch and Jadeja pulls to deep midwicket"
"short again, this time to the right-hander, who cuts to deep point and retains strike"
"a little bounce off the pitch, and it comes off an undisturbed part of it. Saha has to take his bottom hand off as he defends off the front foot outside off stump"
shimmies down the pitch and drives the good length ball outside off to long-off
"there's enough there. Into the second-tier behind long-on. Taijul goes over the wicket to the left-hander, who in turn comes down the track, gets under a length ball and launches it"
"now for the pull shot, with plenty of whip from the wrists, to get the power considering the ball doesn't entirely bounce up"
backs away and punches it through the covers. Doing it in singles
"one-bounce to long-on. Jadeja advances again, takes the ball on the full and may just have got too far under the ball. No, actually he just wet at the ball too hard and it turns in his hand, with Taijul making the ball dip. Oddly, the fielder at long-on went back, deciding not to go for the catch"
"good length ball on off stump, turns it to short leg"
"pushes it through on leg stump, Jadeja moves away to the leg side and tries to scythe the ball to point. Lots of work with the wrist needed for the shot"
"<b>dropped</b> by long-off as Tamim comes running in. Jadeja comes down the track,gets to the pitch and chips the ball up. Times it a little too well for his own good and this really should have been a straightforward catch"
"pierces the gap to the left of mid-off and moves to 98. Top shot, getting down the track, and taking a perfectly well flighted ball on off stump and giving it the status of a bad ball"
"good length ball outside off, defends"
"uses soft hands, and rolls his wrists at the last second to take a length ball from outside off to fine leg"
"shortish and outside off, Jadeja cuts to the man in the deep and he is sharp enough to get a couple. The Bangladesh fielders are still being run ragged"
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
"sees the batsman charging him and Taijul slants the ball wide of the batsman's reach. Jadeja is made to push out with his hands, losing all his timing, in an effort to stop himself getting stumped"
"massive! He moves to 49 with a big ole slog sweep, taking a length ball from outside off and depositing it into the stands"
"that's fifty for Jadeja, with a neat little flick to square leg. There's the  traditional Rajput sword dance, with his bat, twirling round and round. Hyderabad roars in approval"
"<b>hundred</b> with a six! Raises his arms in triumph after coming down the track, taking a length ball and smiting it into the sight-screen. That's his second to in as many first-class innings.  And Karun Nair, who made 300 in India's last drinks, brings out drinks."
"another run down the track, but Mahmudullah pulls his length back and cramps him up. Makes Jadeja look very awkward in the end trying to defend and then whirling his head around to see where the inside edge went"
gets down the track and drives past the diving midwicket's left
"shortish and outside off, cuts to point"
"places it wide of long-off. Beautiful footwork, and then great power. Gets down the track, makes room while doing so, and then having got to the pitch, he simply hits through the line and hits so hard. The fielder had to move a few yards only, but he is comfortably beaten"
"too full for the late cut, but Jadeja goes for it anyway, looking for quick runs. Inside edge"
comes down the pitch and pushes to short cover
"sweeps a full delivery on off stump, makes decent connection to deep square leg. But there is risk playing that shot with a ball in line with the stumps"
"pushes it through outside off, Jadeja hangs back for a late cut, but misses"
"shortish and outside off, Jadeja comes down the track and is made to reach out to make connection. Dabs to point"
"short and outside off, Jadeja picks the length early, shifts his weight back and then powers the ball over extra cover. The man in the deep, Kamrul, tries to stop the four with a boot. No luck"
"shortish on leg stump, goes back and clips into the leg side"
"tosses it up on off stump, whacks it across the line to deep square leg"
"fuller delivery, angles it across the left-hander. Tamim defends with an open face, expecting the ball to move away and finds a single in the covers"
"<b>very tight leave</b>. Not sure if he read the ball as an indipper. Sarkar inches forward, doesn't really cover off stump and is a bit lucky there"
"fuller ball outside off, Sarkar refuses to play. And then umpire Wilson checks Bhuvneshwar's followthrough"
gets squared up as he blocks a back of a length ball and darts away from the left-hander
shifts around the wicket and beats Sarkar with a ball that holds its line outside off and leaps over the outside edge. High-class seam bowling. The batsman flirts at it but it's too good for him
"back of a length and outside off, Sarkar shoulders arms having spotted the line early"
"shortish delivery on and around off stump, Tamim blunts it"
steps forward and pushes at a good length ball outside off and mistimes it to mid-on
"lovely push from Tamim, showing the maker's name to everyone in front of him. No hint of hitting it hard enough. Umesh does well to move to his left from the covers to cut off the boundary"
"third slip is taken off before this ball, and the ball flies through that gap now created. It's a back of a length delivery, angled across the left-hander. Tamim tries to force it through point, instead gets a thick outside edge."
now it's a fuller delivery outside off which Tamim drives through the gap at cover
"caresses it through the covers. He takes a good length ball on the up, concentrates on timing and also places it in the gap that India have offered as bait"
"fuller delivery outside off, Tamim surges forward and sends it to point"
whips a length ball on off stump and places it in the vacant spaces at deep midwicket. Maximum wristwork
"leading edge as Sarkar tries to play the angle, and not the direction in which the ball moves. Bhuvneshwar, from around the wicket, makes the ball straighten to claim the mis-hit to point"
"shortish on middle and off, Sarkar waits a touch more and uses a straighter face to nudge the ball into the leg side"
"fuller delivery on off stump, Sarkar covers the line well and blocks to mid-on"
"shortish and outside off, Sarkar hangs back, blocks with soft hands and picks a single through cover"
"goes around the stumps for a good length ball on off stump, defends. With very little swing and seam on offer, the idea to bowl into the body of the left-hander is probably to create footmarks for the offspinner"
"full and outside off, drives to cover, where the gap is plugged, considering there are only two slips and a gully"
"just back of a length and outside off, Sarkar leaves"
too straight and Sarkar works it off his pads to the square leg boundary. Classy. It's all in the wrists and they are strong enough to send the ball haring off
"good length ball outside off, offers no shot"
"good length, outside off, Sarkar keeps his patience and refuses to play"
"good length ball on off stump from around the wicket, Tamim pushes it to mid-on. Lovely straight bat"
"back of a good length on off stump, Tamim nudges it to short midwicket"
"length delivery on of stump, defends"
goes for a drive seeing the width on this fuller delivery and finds cover
brings him forward with a good length ball and Tamim blocks cautiously
on the pads and Tamim dinks it behind square leg and will get a couple of runs. Good shot.
"pins him in front of the stumps, but since it is off a back of a length ball, the impact is well above the pads. Ishant getting into his stride. This one darted in off the seam"
"beautiful. He sees the short ball, recognises it gives him plenty of room to free the arms. Ramps it over the cordon. Clever batting."
"full and wide, asking for the on the up drive, Sarkar restrains himself"
"length ball on off stump, Sarkar defends to cover"
"<b>ripper</b> from Ishant, snaking the ball past the outside edge and having pitched it up he also draws Sarkar into playing at it. Loads of bounce too. Basically the ball that is too good even to edge"
"back of a length and outside off, Sarkar keeps away from it"
"full and outside off, Tamim is forward with a block"
"full and outside off, drives past cover's left"
"smashes a cover drive, doesn't care that he is hitting on the up, because there isn't really much movement for the quicks. Lovely timing, and Kohli does well moving to his left and getting it with one hand"
"good length ball outside off, steers it to backward point"
gets up tall to get on top of the short delivery on off stump
"fuller delivery outside off, offers no shot"
"into the pads and Sarkar clips it to deep square leg. Looks very composed. There's five overs left, he and Tamim should get through them"
"goes for the bouncer, which Tamim picks early and gets under. Good line though, right over middle, and had the batsman been upright, it would have come at that awkward height at his throat"
"goes after the wide ball, and manages to mis-hit it in front of and over point. Jadeja runs after it, but he has too much distance to cover from backward point."
moves back over the stumps now for a good length ball on off stump and blocks
goes for a flick against a good length ball that is moving across him. Bit of a leading edge back down the pitch
"plants his front leg on off stump and plays around it - he can do that on a slow pitch, he has the time, and where the ball doesn't dart around. Single to square leg"
"fuller deliveyr outside off, drives to the left of cover"
"fuller delivery outside off, drives to point"
"good length ball from around the stumps, Tamim lets it go outside off"
squares him up with a shortish delivery outside off. Just enough movement away from the bat to make Tamim block
"length ball outside off, slides it off the open face to point"
"comes forward to a length ball on off stump, turns it to short midwicket"
"shortish on off stump, Sarkar clips it through to square leg"
whips a length ball on middle and off through midwicket. Had to wait for the ball and then roll his wrists rapidly to get the gap he wants
"full on off stump, blocks"
"back of a length and outside off, dabs it towards cover"
"cracks it through the gap to the right of mid-off. Fine stroke. Full-flowing. Tamim at his best, hitting on the up, through the line and into the vacant spot"
"goes for a short ball on middle and leg, Tamim stands up tall and blocks"
"tosses it up from around the wicket, Sarkar defends outside off"
"loads of flight, straight into the footmarks, Sarkar drives out of it to short cover"
"length ball on off stump, defends"
"fuller delivery on middle and off, keeps it out"
"this one goes on with the arm, having pitched on a good length on off stump. Sarkar goes back to flick, gets a deflection off the pads to fine leg"
"lobs it up onto the base of middle stump, Tamim makes room and lashes it to cover"
"141kph, back of a length on middle, blocks"
"whoa! This is a 142 kph jaffa, and India believe they have a caught behind. Go for <b>a review</b>. Magnificent ball first up from Umesh, pitching fullish on off stump, and swinging in between the bat and pad. Too quick for Sarkar's defences as he comes forward with a lazy drive on the up towards mid-off. UltraEdge says there's a bottom edge and Sarkar's gone. Seems like this review came out of the confidence of Pujara at mid-on, saying there was a nick, and Vijay as well at midwicket. Kohli at cover also seems to have heard something. Saha, the keeper, didn't even appeal. He just did the other most important thing, diving low to his right to pick up the catch."
"lobs up a full toss outside off, which he drives to cover"
"shortish on middle and leg, he tries a flick but gets hit on the pad"
"shortish and outside off, Mominul looks to defend, but the ball straightens down the line and beats him"
"finishes with a short ball, on target, making Mominul shuffle across onto the off side and fend it away behind short leg. End of a top over from India's fastest bowler"
"tosses it up onto off stump, Tamim pushes hard at the ball and gets an inside edge down the pitch"
"nudges a fuller delivery on off stump, nudges into the leg side"
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
"shortish and outside off, Tamim looks for the late cut, but directs it straight to Rahane at slip. On the bounce though"
"tosses it up on off stump, defends"
moves back in line with all three stumps and the length ball that keeps coming on with the arm takes the inside edge into the square leg region. Ashwin thought he had his man lbw
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go"
"there's a deflection as the ball passes the bat, but there's no edge. This is <b>reverse swing</b> from Umesh in the 14th over. Good length ball, wide of off stump, drawing Tamim into the stroke and beating him."
"145kph, slings in the yorker at the toes of Tamim, digs it out"
"goes short and outside off, the batsman ducks under it"
"back of a length and just outside off, Tamim finds a single in front of point"
"fullish on the stumps, Mominul pushes to mid-on and gets a quick single to end the day"
"good length ball, deviating towards the shine, but not so much that the batsman will be worried. Mominul reads the line to be outside off and shoulders arms"
"pitches on a good length on the off stump and angles it across the left-hander, bowling over the wicket, Mominul ignores it"
"on the pads, looking to generate enough outswing to square Mominul up. Not this time. The batsman nudges it into the leg side with a straight bat"
"whoa is the shout from behind the wicket as Bhuvi makes the third-day pitch deliver some extra bounce. It's a back of a length ball, outside off, Mominul does well not to commit to any shot and then get out of the way"
"that's top notch! The intention, by way of the angle of the seam, is to move the ball into the left-hander. It's pointed to the right of the wicketkeeper. But the shine is towards the slips. And it goes with the shine, hitting back of a length, seaming away off the deck. Since it is in line with middle and off, Mominul has to play, and he tries to with a block. Comfortably beaten"
"teases the drive as a follow-up, Mominul, having put that last ball behind him, leaves"
"shortish and outside off, Tamim pulls the bat inside the line"
into the pads on a full length and Tamim clips it to midwicket
"gets an outside edge, and though he does push at the ball, it doesn't carry to KL Rahul at second slip. Good bowling from Umesh, in the off stump corridor, making the batsman play, and getting it to seam away just late enough to make the mistake"
"attempts a slice behind point, but he is quite uncertain, worried about the movement off the pitch. Gets a bottom edge"
"works it off his hips behind square leg, that's easy to do against a bowler angling the ball into you from around the stumps"
"he's a touch early into his straight-bat push, but realises his mistake and softens the grip he has on his bat. So a full delivery, curling away in the air, not much but just enough, takes the outside edge through point all along the ground"
"136kph, back of a length and outside off, Mominul is well aware of his stumps and knows this poses no threat to them"
goes wider outside off to see if Mominul might perceive it as a scoring opportunity and therefore offer the chance of his outside edge. The batsman refuses to play again
"good length, pitching and darting away off the seam, Mominul covers the line and then sticks the bat high into the air"
"there isn't a two there, but they go for it and Tamim is run-out at the non-strikers. He throws his partner a forlorn look. Bangladesh did not need this. And to think all this began with a good shot. Mominul has made the bowler bowl at him, into his body, which meant he can flick it behind square leg. Umesh runs in from the boundary, gets to it quickly enough and realises that has given second thoughts to the two batsmen in the middle. Mominul and Tamim, who were jogging across for a single, go for the another run and just stop midway, staring at each other. Then they set off again and by that time the flat throw is into the bowler, Bhuvneshwar collects it cleanly and does the rest"
"back of a length on off stump, nudges it into the leg side"
"moves around the stumps for a back of a length delivery outside off, defends towards point"
"good length ball outside off, Mahmudullah seems to poke at the ball but is nowhere close to the line of it"
"back of a length and outside off, offers no shot"
"good length, seaming away off the pitch, Mahmudullah doesn't want to play"
"squares him up with a good length ball, tinged with away movement. Mahmudullah, by virtue of playing late, is able to block it"
"bangs it in short, the batsman ducks under it"
"now goes for the inswing. India are trusting their fast bowlers in the first hour and they are delivering. This is pitched on a good length, curls in the air, gains further movement off the pitch. Mahmudullah covers his off stump and leaves outside it"
"starts with a short one at 128 kph, Mominul gets under it"
"shortish, into the body, Mominul works it to midwicket"
"beats the edge, because of lack of bounce. Bhuvneshwar's line is teasing again, just outside off. Mominul, because of the change in angle from around the wicket, is sucked into playing"
that's good. Show the full face of the bat. This is a full ball that is drilled back at the bowler
"goes for the pull, and just about gets it over the fielder at midwicket. Good effort from Pujara, leaping up, sticking his right hand up to try and drag it down. Mominul has timed it just well enough to collect a boundary"
"cramps him up with a short ball, which is much quicker. Mominul is stuck in the crease, playing across the line and takes a blow to the body"
"good length ball outside off, solid defence from Mahmudullah"
"well played, and the mid-on fielder doesn't do well. Dives to his left, but does not stop the ball, Ishant the culprit. Umesh goes full and straight and Mahmudullah drives it calmly down the ground. Concentration on timing and showing the full face"
"when the ball is outside off though, he isn't quite as sure of himself. Pokes at a good length ball away from his body and is beaten"
"fuller delivery on off stump, covers it well"
"back of a length and just outside off, Mahmudullah waits on it and blocks firmly"
defends a good length ball coming in towards his off stump. Cracking sound off the bat
"goes wider of the crease to angle the back of a length delivery in at fifth stump, Mominul taps and runs into the covers"
"gets a length ball to straighten outside off and Mahmudullah gets an outside edge. Since it is low on the bat, and that he has played it gently, the ball goes down. Kohli dives to his right from third slip to stop any runs"
"fuller delivery outside off, no need to play those"
"comes back in off the pitch,  but it does so early enough that Mahmudullah can hurry into his push through the covers. Umesh goes for a throw, off balance, but there is no one there to back up. Bangladesh take the overthrow"
"<b>India review</b> for a leg before. First we check the no-ball, it seems tight, but Bhuvneshwar seems to be fine. Just a sliver behind the line. Then comes a fuller delivery, comes in off the pitch. Mahmudullah is deceived by that late movement, his bat hitting the pad to interfere with his strokeplay. Hits low on the pads, but this might be going down leg. Hawk-eye says it is just clipping. But middle and off stumps were visible when the batsman was playing the shot. Good indication for umpire Wilson, justifiable decision from him as well"
"fuller delivery outside off, drives to short cover"
"starts with a slightly shorter delivery outside off, Mominul picks the length early, rocks back, waits on it so much that he cuts out of the wicketkeeper's gloves. Beautiful shot"
"shortish and outside off, Mominul is onto the back foot again and punches through cover"
"tosses it up on middle, defends"
defuses a length ball on middle and leg and nudges it towards square leg
"a little bit of bounce, and plenty of turn. Did this hit the footmarks? No. Off the undisturbed part of the pitch. Mominul, setting up for a gentle forward push, is done in by the ball spinning past his inside edge and into his body"
"shortish and outside off, drills it into the covers"
"back of a length on middle, blocks"
"full and outside off, he drives to the right of cover."
"gorgeous bowling. He pitches it up, and it's just wide enough for Mahmudullah to think he has an easy cover drive. Then he is done in by the outswing, moving in the direction of the shine."
"goes short this time, Mahmudullah is waiting for it this time, hanging back and guiding the ball between second slip and gully"
"slides down the leg side, Mahmudullah will be disappointed at not getting the little bat he needs to find the fine leg boundary"
"into the pads again, clips it as Mahmudullah tries a flick and goes through to the wicketkeeper's left."
"good length ball outside off, Mominul goes back and blocks down the pitch"
"fuller in length, but Mominul keeps going back, giving himself the liberty of reading the ball off the pitch. Blocks again"
"pushes it through a little quicker on middle, Mominul nudges it to short leg"
"now he is brought forward to a flighted delivery on middle, clips it to short leg"
"there's nothing there, but India are appealing wildly for a caught behind. They discuss, they keep discussing, and decide not to go for the review. Beautiful delivery, tosses it up outside off, brings Mominul forward, makes him push at the ball, which doesn't turn as much as he thinks it would. Goes past the outside edge. Well, jumps, really. Loads of bounce"
"loops the ball up again, bringing Mominul forward, making him hit against the turn, because the line is wide outside off. The ball dips sharply and takes the inside edge to short midwicket"
"another big appeal for lbw, and umpire Wilson gives it. Mominul walks as well, so he doesn't think there is an inside edge. Umesh is on song, his length is so good this morning. Full, nipping back in off the pitch just enough to beat the bat and clang into the back pad, twice, in front of middle. That's plumb."
"beautiful bowling. Shakib likes feeling bat on ball early, and he drags him with a full, wide delivery, reversing away from his reach. Confounds him"
"full on off stump, curls away late, Shakib is better prepared for it. Steers to point"
"too high for the lbw. Could also be pitched outside leg. Shakib is caught in the crease, deer in headlights against the pace, and the fact that this ball held its line and ca,me on straight. He is waiting for the ball to move across him and so is very late in defending this back of a length straight ball"
"full toss, wide outside off, lashes it over the cordon and into the boundary."
"now the bouncer on middle and leg, Shakib does well to sink under it"
goes back and flicks a shortish delivery to short midwicket
"the ball is keeping low, so playing Jadeja off the back foot is going to be diffcult. Mahmudllah just about gets bat to it"
"flatter on middle and leg, whips it past Ashwin's right at short midwicket"
"tosses it up onto leg stump, Mahmudullah nudges it towards backward square leg. He's worried about a little extra bounce this time"
"no short leg, which is where this inside edge goes. Jadeja holds his back a bit, but disguises that by the flight he puts in. Lovely spin bowling. Mahmudullah, deceived, is forward too early, pushing at the ball"
"flighted delivery on off stump, defends"
"back of a length and outside off, Umesh bowling around the stumps, Shakib pushes to point"
"width outside off and Shakib gets under the length ball and lifts it over point. Good shot. Puts away the bad ball, Bangladesh have to keep doing that as and when they get them"
"the line changes, gets closer to off stump, forces Shakib to play with a straight bat and beats the outside edge with late movement off the pitch"
"now he does it off the full length, this is basically a <b>140 kph offcutter</b>. Pitches on fourth stump, and then the ball scythes away in the direction of the shine"
"fuller ball outside off, Shakib, gingerly pushes it to midwicket"
"and this is when the inswing, or even the angle of the ball coming into the batsman from around the wicket works. Shakib is not ready for the 138 kph delivery as he goes for the flick very late and gets hit on the pads"
"tries to dispel the pressure by running at the bowler, Jadeja senses it and fires it through flat on middle and leg, cramping him up. Mahmudullah, panicking, tries to swing and is hit on the pad"
"tosses it up onto leg stump, Mahmudullah tries a flick but does not connect. Lucky for him, for the ball plops up to short leg"
"tosses it up on middle and leg, Mahmudullah tries to hit against the turn, along with the angle, and is beaten again. Struck on the pads, didn't straighten enough for the lbw"
"tosses it up, asking the batsman to drive, with a short cover in place. Latest trick in Jadeja;s bag. Mahmudullah though drives into the ground"
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
"fires it in on middle and off, and Mahmudullah, going back in his crease, because of the trajectory, has to shove his straight bat lower because of the lack of bounce. This is probing stuff."
"big appeal for the lbw as Umesh finds Shakib sluggish with an inswinger. Pitches on off stump, skids into him too quickly, the batsman hurriedly flicks across the line and survives because it would have gone down"
"full and wide, Shakib manages to smack it through the covers. His feet dont necessarily move, but his hands are good enough to make a solid connection"
"fuller delivery outside off, drives into the covers"
"shortish and outside off, Mahmudullah targets the gap between second slip and gully and glides it to the third man boundary"
"length ball, coming in off the pitch and in the air. Mahmudullah blocks"
"that's well played. There is plenty of reverse on this full, nearly overpitched delivery, but he isn't fazed by it and presents the full face of the bat as he drives. Umesh saves a certain boundary and heads off for a well earned drink"
"flights the ball outside off, Shakib leans into a drive, with the angled bat and gets a couple in front of point"
"good length ball just outside off, Shakib comes forward to block"
"presses forward outside off, Shakib reaches towards the pitch of the ball and opens face"
"stays back against a good length ball, adjusts for the turn out of the rough, plays close to the boundary and steers it to point"
"drives an overpitched delivery down the ground, but Jadeja anticipates it, moves to his left quickly and stops a boundary"
"hammers it back at the bowler, Jadeja has to stick his hands up over his head and reverse cup. It's too quick even for him. Difficult to call that a drop, basically because it still retains the force to go over to the boundary"
"helps a short ball on middle stump on its way to long leg. If you dig the ball into the middle of this slow pitch, it makes it easier for the batsman"
"defends so late, waiting for the ball to move, and it does, into the left-hander. Tough to play out there at the moment. The movement is only minimal, but India's accuracy is making it very threatening"
"<b>races past the outside edge</b>, as Umesh pitches a good length ball on middle, forces Shakib to defend and then, like it's on a string, darts it away to the wicketkeeper"
"full and wide, Shakib drives into the covers"
"this is an indipper, pitching on off stump, full as well, so it gives Shakib very little time to adjust. Manages an inside edge onto pad. At Umesh's pace, this is hard work"
"now past the outside edge, squaring the batsman up. Top over from Umesh. Back of a length delivery lurching away after pitching"
"round-arms the ball in onto middle, Mahmudullah keeps it out"
"flights it onto middle, he stays back and blocks again"
drives an overpitched delivery on off stump to mid-off
"shortish, flicks it in the air to short leg, Pujara is taking evasive action, and is hit on the elbow. Hit off the middle of the bat."
"drifts it down the leg side, Mahmudullah misses, Saha doesn't, moving fluidly to his left"
"good length ball outside off, defends"
"fuller delivery outside off, sweetly timed through cover. He doesn't overhit. He's fighting. He knows the importance of his wicket"
"good length, darting past the outside edge, too much movement for the batsman to have any chance. Shakib has to play at it and is no match again"
"good length ball on off stump, defends towards cover"
"pitches it outside leg, moves into the left-hander and nails his pads. Shakib has no hope of putting bat to ball, because this is a full delivery that seams off the deck. Has no time to adjust."
"another full delivery into the pads, Shakib tries to flick it away behind square leg but is struck on the pads"
"fuller delivery just outside off, holding its line as Mahmudullah defends and gets a single off the outside half of the bat towards point"
moves back to a length ball on middle and leg and flicks it to midwicket
"whips a flatter delivery to deep square leg. Good shot, exploiting the bad ball"
"under all this pressure, Mahmudullah sees a tossed up delivery, knows there is no one deep at square leg and goes for a slog sweep. Connects well enough"
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
"goes back to a length ball, using the depth of the crease to give himself the time to flick the ball behind square leg"
"outside edge past first slip, he had no chance, of course. Too far from him. This is natural variation from Jadeja. The orthodox left-arm spinner, meant to spin into Shakib just holds its line and with him lunging forward to the tossed up ball, playing for turn, the outcome is pretty basic."
"137 kph, and now it's Ishant's turn to exploit the old ball. Back of a length, cuts into the right-hander, in the direction of the shine. Mahmudullah tries to slice it through point but misses"
"length ball, darting into the right-hander off the pitch, Mahmudullah is late with his forward defensive and is hit on the top of the pad"
"full on middle and leg, clips it through square leg"
"gives it lbw, inswing works. Mahmudullah checks with his partner, points at his thigh and then goes for <b>a review</b>. This is a good length ball, seaming in off the pitch, and that leaves the batsman defending down the wrong line. He's hit on the top of the back pad, that leg is bent a bit. HawkEye shows it is clipping leg stump and the decision from umpire Wilson stands"
"full and slings it down leg, Mushfiqur nudges it to short midwicket"
"good length ball outside off, Mushfiqur reads the line and leaves it alone. Bangladesh have not had too many chances to do that, which is credit to India, making the most of a reversing ball"
"tosses it up outside off, slog sweep to the midwicket boundary. Top shot. Picked up the length early"
"good length ball outside off, defends"
"shortish and outside off, Shakib jumps back and flicks it shot midwicket"
"flights it outside off, Shakib is drawn forward to block"
goes back to a length ball that keeps a bit low. Shakib manages to block it though
"comes down the track, but still can't get to the pitch and as he flicks. Hits on the knee-roll. India ask the question for lbw, but he is too far down, and might have been hit outside off too"
"good length, outside off, Mushfiqur leaves well"
"fuller delivery on off stump, keeps it out"
"gets into his stance, crouches, prepares for the ball, concentrating hard, reads the line to be outside off and leaves. The bowler's good work, hitting a good length, comes to nothing."
presses forward to a fuller ball on off stump and drives to short cover
"back of a length, but a bit wide of off stump, Mushfiqur avoids it again"
makes a back of a length ball hold its line outside off - the Ishant special - Mushfiqur defends with an angled face
"tosses it up on middle and leg, Shakib defends off the front foot"
"beautiful delivery. He loops it up above the eyeline, then gets it to dip in front of the batsman's reach. Shakib defends with a straight bat"
comes down the track and drives a length ball outside off to short cover. Good field to allow Ashwin to bowl six balls at the batsman
presses forward and blocks a flighted delivery on middle
another trip down the pitch for a push to short cover
"slower through the air, drifting it into leg stump. Then it turns, so Shakib has to block with an open face and push his hands down on to of it so that it bounces before reaching silly point."
"fuller delivery outside off, Mushfiqur waits until the last moment before stepping forward to block"
"good length ball outside off, Mushfiqur defends towards point"
"full delivery, demanding the drive. Mushfiqur presses forward and across to protect his off stump and leaves. Even with the ball swinging in, that's a good leave"
"well bowled and superb reflexes from Mushfiqur as well, swaying away from a bouncer, on off stump. Not the kind of bouncer, banged in, giving the batsman ample time to see it. Kohli approves"
"back of a length and outside off, Mushfiqur avoids it"
"full delivery, massive inswing, Mushfiqur is lured into the flick, he has to, and with three men catching there, short midwickets, this is a risky shot"
"comes down the track, reaches the pitch on leg stump and flicks it to midwicket"
"hits the back leg, going for an lbw call and <b>India review</b>. Gorgeous delivery to start. This is on a good length, angled into the middle and leg stump. Shakib plays that angle, and is defeated by the turn. Ashwin says, I'm sure there is no bat, to further the review. Confirmation arrives. But the ball passes off stump, on height too. Excellent call from umpire Erasmus. No more reviews for India"
"tosses it up on off stump, drives to short cover"
"good length ball on off stump, Shakib stays beside the line of it and blocks"
"fuller, flatter, on off stump, Shakib defends from the crease"
"comes down the pitch, seeing the flight Ashwin has given this delivery, but it drifts into the left-hander, cramping him a bit. Big drive to mid-on, not entirely timed"
leans into a good length ball and drills it past Kohli's left at short cover. Damn the inswing he says with that strong shot
"back of a length, seems to hold in the pitch a bit as Shakib plays the flick a touch too early and wears it on the body, twice as the ball jumps off his thighs and seems to hit his grille"
clips a length ball on leg stump behind square leg
"well played. Or perhaps not. Mushfiqur knows he needs only a touch on this short delivery into his hip and gets it. Thigh pad, and then the long leg boundary"
"covers the line of a good length delivery on off stump and though it straightens, his ability to play late and play straight helps him"
"one-bounce to the boundary right behind the wicketkeeper. Mushfiqur sways away from the line of a bouncer, dug into the middle of the deck, allowing him to manipulate it because it comes off relatively slowly. Then it's all in the wrists, giving the ball enough power with a ramp"
comes down the track to a flighted delivery outside off and he drives to mid-off
"lovely shot, staying back to a flatter delivery outside off and cuts it to point"
"comes down the pitch, gets close to the ball and works it past the short midwicket. Well played, finding the gap to his left."
"advances again, to drive a tossed up delivery on leg stump. Inside edges back to the bowler"
"good length ball, bowls it slower through the air, defends"
presses forward to the tossed up delivery on middle and keeps it out
"good length ball outside off, blocks to short cover"
"this is reverse seam away from the bat, and Mushfiqur is not ready for it. He comes forward expecting the ball to come in and when it moves the other way, he pushes hard at the ball and is beaten"
"fuller delivery outside off, defends"
"back of a length and outside off, offers no shot. Meanwhile, Kohli is back at it, egging the crowd on to create some noise and they respond, big time"
"good length ball, just outside off, Mushfiqur comes forward, aiming to defend, but hides his bat behind his pad, reading the reverse swing going away from him. He's looked superb since he came out to the middle."
"shortish on middle and leg, he nudges to short midwicket and that will be lunch"
drifting into the pads a bit and Shakib turns it behind square leg to get across to the other end
moves back to a good length ball outside off and blocks
"loops it up, makes it drift outside off, Mushfiqur moves outside off, but doesn't play, instead hiding his bat behind the pad"
comes down the track to a flighted delivery outside off and defends
keeps back to the flatter delivery on middle and blocks
"hit a good length, but on a slow pitch the batsman can hang back off this length and block"
"tempts the cover drive and Shakib obliges, making sure to play the ball to the right of both short covers. Superb timing. Just flew off the bat."
"beats the batsman, who is caught on the back foot and poking ant a good length ball seaming away from the left-hander"
"finds the gap to the right of Rahane at gully. Bhuvi finds a good length, makes the batsman play and takes the outside edge. Bounces short of the fielder and scurries away"
"back of a length on off stump, keeps it out"
"indecision, caused by a good length ball outside off. Shakib attempts a defensive shot, but then decides he might be better off leaving it. In the end the ball hits the toe end of the bat and goes towards second slip"
pushes a shortish delivery outside off into the covers
"carrom ball from Ashwin, and the batsman reads it early enough - perhaps it's off the pitch - and defends"
flicks a good length ball - flatter in trajectory - into the leg side
"well played. He judges the line of the ball to be slipping down leg stump early enough to get down on one knee and gently sweep it to the fine leg boundary. Carrom ball, misplaced"
covers the line of a good length ball on off stump
"stays back to an offbreak, which seems to bounce a bit. Defends"
"nicely tossed up outside off, Mushfiqur blocks with bat close to pad"
"back of a length and outside off, taps it into the covers"
<b>stays low</b> as Shakib shuffles across to try and cut a shortish delivery outside off. Makes no connection
"leans into the drive, he takes it on the up, times it well and hits the gap to the right of cover. Beats even Jadeja to the boundary"
"sees the batsman trying to walk at him and bowls a shorter length, makes the ball dart back in off the seam as well to ping Shakib high on the right thigh"
gorgeous! He sees this to be a wide ball and immediately realises there is no third man. So he just opens the face and the late cut hurries away
"shortish delivery on middle and leg, defends"
shifts his weight back against a shortish delivery and cuts to point
"top shot, he takes a length ball outside off and sweeps it, on top of the bounce and cracks it to deep square leg. Very well controlled"
"puts in a diving effort at short midwicket, but a slight misfield from Kohli allows a single. Fierce pull from Mushfiqur"
"moves to fifty with a risky boundary through cover, it's his highest score against India too. Sees the flight on the ball and hares down the track. The line is wide though, and he is made to reach. Somehow manages to keep control of the shot, and picks the gap past short and another fielder behind him"
"another cover drive, this shot played closer to the body, but doesn't find the gap. So only a single"
"fuller delivery outside off, defends and gets a single towards point. But Shakib has to pull his partner along for the run."
"back of a length and outside off, blocks"
"back of a length and outside off, needs no shot"
"fuller delivery, moving in the air and into the right-hander, rather late too. Mushfiqur playing with a straight bat helps him"
"shortish on middle, he stays back and flicks to short midwicket"
"fuller delivery outside off, blocks"
"plays with the swing and has timed it well enough to pick up three to deep square leg. Lovely flick shot, leaning over the length ball on middle and off stump"
"tosses it up on off stump, blocks carefully"
"neatly played, pressing forward to a slow, flighted delivery on off stump and paddle sweeping it towards fine leg. Good connection, brings up the fifty partnership"
"comes down the track, drives to mid-off and knows there is a single. Mushfiqur though is less certain, he is sluggish and that's a bad place to be with Jadeja being the fielder. <b>This is very close</b>, despite the dive, because the bat thuds into the ground and jumps up in the air. That doesn't happen if you slide the bat with the face downward. He dives and the bat makes contact with the ground on the side of the edge and so it pops up. The third umpire has a big decision to make, because the shoulder of the bat is close to the line, on the line, when the right bail pop up. But it's difficult to be absolutely sure about whether the bat is inside or on the line. And the third umpire Gaffaney gives the benefit of the doubt to the batsman"

presses forward to a flighted delivery outside off and blocks
lunges forward to a length ball pushed across him and blocks
"back of a length, the ball seams away off the pitch. Shakib defends with soft hands and gets a quick single. Though it's not an easy one. Jadeja comes racing in from cover and puts an underarm throw to hit the stumps. Mushfiqur does well stretch"
"short and wide - probably the first one he's bowled - and even then it doesn't go for the boundary. Mushfiqur did his bit to send it about 99.9% of the way there with a cut shot, but Pujara has pulled it back with a good slide"
"length ball on middle and leg, defends"
"back of a length and outside off, pushes it towards cover"
"shortish on leg stump, clips it behind square leg"
"fuller delivery, starting on leg stump, Shakib is mindful of the reverse swing away from the bat and pushes down the ground. A direct hit comes from the fielder running up to the ball from mid-on or mid-off, not sure, and that gives up an overthrow"
"throws the ball wide outside off, Shakib lashes it to deep cover point"
"flatter delivery on middle and off, Mushfiqur goes back and blocks"
"tosses it up outside off, defends"
moves back to a shortish delivery on off stump and works it to short midwicket
"<b>extra bounce</b> and turn as well, but it's slow, so Mushfiqur, on the back foot, can adjust and then knock it down behind square leg"
"tosses it up on off stump, defends"
"back of a length and outside off, watches it carefully, reads it as reversing away, and then shoulders arms."
"good length ball, asking Mushfiqur to come forward, but he leaves again having judged it to pose no threat to his stumps"
"fuller delivery on off stump, blocks to cover"
"crashes it through the covers and Pujara can't get to it this time. Takes it on the up, but controls it supremely well. The balance flowing into the shot, the concentration on the timing"
"shortish and sliding down leg, Mushfiqur goes for a flick but misses"
"reverses it in and <b>cuts Mushfiqur in half</b>. He has thirved by playing late and close to the body, but this delivery is too close to off stump to leave, in that in-between length where he doesn't know whether to go forward or back and the movement off the pitch is quite sharp"
thunders down the pitch and hammers the flighted delivery down the ground to the long-on boundary. The most imperious shot of the innings so far
"tosses it up and drifts it into the leg side, so Shakib, looking for an inside out drive gets an inside edge only"
comes forward and drives towards short cover
"shortish and outside off, Shakib hangs back and punches it to cover's right"
"stays around hte wicket to Mushfiqur, who drills it through the gap at extra cover. He actually ends up too close to the ball, but adjusts by gripping the bat tighter and bringing his bottom hand into play. Powers it through"
"goes for a lap sweep as soon as the ball leaves Ashwin's hand, which gives Rahane at slip the chance to rush back towards fine leg to try and be in a position for the catch. There's just enough of a connection to lob over him though"
"smears it through cover, past his right. The ball is reversing, but Shakib is happy to go for his shots as soon as he sees the ball wide. There is risk in this approach, but it's all paying off so far"
"shortish and down leg, Shakib works it away to long leg"
"full and swinging in late, Mushfiqur, intending to drive through mid-off, gets it to mid-on instead"
"full, wide, smacks it through the covers. Again, playing well away from the body but his hands are good enough. More than good enough"
"<b>another confusion</b> and it's Mushfiqur again, this time going for an optimistic third run. It's a fuller delivery, outside off, Shakib leans into the drive and places it past Jadeja at mid-off. He hunts the ball down, and throws at the keeper's end, seeing Mushfiqur take off, not knowing Shakib would say no. So in the end, by the time Saha collects the ball and relays it back to the bowler, the Bangladesh captain is safe"
"shortish and down leg, Shakib doens't bother with it"
goes back in his crease to block a good length ball outside off
tosses it up and gets just enough dip and therefore turn for the forward defensive to go off the outside part of the bat
"sees the ball on a length, and goes for the sweep, but this time he is hitting against the turn and it does turn, sharply past the bat"
pushes it through onto middle and leg and Mushfiqur goes back to block. The ball seems to hold up in the pitch and then kick up towards the top if the bat
comes forward to a flighted delivery angled into him and blocks with a straight bat
"tosses it up on off stump, defends"
"tosses it up outside off, from around the wicket, Shakib opens the face as he drives on the front foot and finds a single at point"
goes back to the good length ball outside off and blocks
"tosses it up outside off, pushes it to mid-on and looks for a run when it's not there"
"flights the ball just outside off, Mushfiqur blocks it"
"a little quicker and flatter on off stump, Mushfiqur stays low and defends"
"mid-off is up, so he has the liberty to run down the track and swing as hard as he wants. This is tossed up, so Mushfiqur runs at Ashwin and gets a thick outside edge over the fielder. That's drinks."
"plays the sweep, all along the ground to take a tossed up delivery from outside off stump to deep backward square leg"
"good length ball outside off, Mushfiqur eases it to the left of cover"
"tosses it up outside off, Mushfiqur gets to the pitch and smothers it"
"dip from Jadeja, which allows him to spin the ball past the middle and take the outside edge. Thick enough to slide  through vacant silly point"
"goes for a lap sweep, to take a ball from outside off to long leg. Umesh keeps it to only a single. Top work"
comes down the track and works it through Mushfiqur's legs to long-on
"looks to drive out of the footmarks, the cover drive too, with the angled bat, and it turns wildly past the bat. Top take from Saha behind the stumps though, staying low and moving his hands with the ball"
"flighted delivery outside off, defends"
"going for a caught behind off the boot and into the wicketkeeper's left hand. The umpires come together, and then ask the third umpire for a second look. Soft signal is out. But one replay is all that is needed for us to see the ball hit ground. For the record, this is a good length ball outside off, holds its line as opposed to turning away"
"comes down the track, and lashes it over mid-off. This is off the outside edge, and for some reason it still goes straight. India have placed a man three-fourth the way to the cover boundary to exploit this very mis-hit. Not this time"

reaches for the good length ball on off stump and blocks
"good length ball outside off, Mushfiqur defends to silly point"
"beautifully played. Flatter delivery, and once he judges that, he goes back, waits on it until the last second and then carves it past the slip fielder. Jadeja's own pace on the ball does the rest. That's the hundred partnership"

"goes back to a length ball on off stump, keeps it out"
"pushes it through, off a round-arm action, Shakib comes down the track and pushes to the left of short cover"
just enough drift on this tossed up delivery on off stump gets the inside edge as Shakib lunges forward to block
"sweeps from middle and connects well enough to hit it dead square. Here he has the length to play the shot, not so full that he is cramped, and he rolls his wrists on top of the ball"
presses forward to a flighted delivery outside off and blocks
smothers the spin outside off
"pushes it into the footmarks on leg stump, and Mushfiqur has to play back and mind the extra bounce"
"tosses it up on middle, Mushfiqur defends, bat in front of pad"
"makes the ball straighten outside off and Mushfiqur, covering for the one that comes on with the arm plays inside the line. Not really beaten. Pretty clever actually"
"this has been happening way too often with Shakib. He gets set. He looks to dominate, then he plays a poor shot. A low percentage shot. Comes down the track, doesn't reach the pitch, still goes for the loft, against the turn, mis-hits to mid-on. The exactly way he fell on a crucial final day's play in New Zealand when they were desperately trying to survive and hold on for a draw. And Ashwin has his wicket, doing very little other than being persistent and waiting for the batsman to make the mistake"
"tosses it up just outside off, Sabbir is forward with a block"
"goes back to a fuller delivery, and it turns enough to put him in trouble. Inside edge, though, goes wide of short leg. To the right"

comes forward to a length ball and blocks to cover
"plays a little away from the body as he goes for a drive, the bat face opening to find point"

"pushes it into the pads, Sabbir taps it around the corner at square leg"
"shortish and outside off, he waits on it and cuts to point."
"tosses it up just outside off, Mushfiqur blocks it down"
"good length, kicking off off the pitch, even off a full length, and hits him on the bottom hand. Mushfiqur takes it off the bat immediately"
"goes for the sweep, places it to the left of Pujara at deep square leg. Mushfiqur wants two, but Sabbir, wisely says no. The ball was hit too hard"
"goes back to a flatter delivery on middle, keeps it out"
"there's no long-on so Sabbir runs down the track and lofts it over the infield. Mis-hit, but he profits from it. Bangladesh taking a lot of risks"
"pushes it through on middle and leg, Mushfiqur stays back and flicks it through midwicket"
"good length ball, turning away, Sabbir minds it by playing late and angling the face towards point"
blocks the flatter delivery aimed at off stump
"into middle and leg, Sabbir taps it to midwicket. Very few opportunities for singles for the batsman"
"<b>massive turn and bounce</b>, that's unplayable. He tosses it up, there are no footmarks to explain this behaviour. Hits a pristine part of the pitch and just explodes past the outside edge. Saha takes it over the shoulder, and what a take it is too, standing up to the stumps"
"good length ball on middle, defends"
"pushes it through on off stump, Mushfiqur keeps back and blocks"

"good length ball on off stump, defends"
"So close to a stumping. Saha, you beauty. Collects the ball ever so cleanly, and with Sabbir overbalancing, as he reaches forward to to the ball, and whips the bail off quickly. But Sabbir has put his foot back down. Remarkable reflexes from both players. The batsman's instincts for self-preservation kicks in beautifully, to leave a beautiful delivery, angled in on middle, turning sharply away into, basically, nothing"
"full and outside off, drives to mid-off"
"shortish on leg stump, clips it to long leg. Off the pads"
"short ball, coming in at the batsman, always coming in at him and Sabbir is in no position to handle it. He's basically made himself as big a target as possible, jumping up to take the ball on his left forearm"
"shortish and outside off, Sabbir tries to slide it towards third man, but Rahane at gully dives to his left and stops any such thoughts"
"back of a length and just outside off, Sabbir gets an inside edge through vacant square leg and again there is indecision in the running"
"full and angled into the pads, swinging in as well. Mushfiqur flicks and appears to be falling over, but this ball is heading too far down leg. Ishant appeals, pleads, yelps and screams. But he won't get umpire Wilson's approval."
"he's given it out lbw but Sabbir goes to his partner to check, that indicates he has not hit it, Mushfiqur talks to his team-mate and then sends him on his way. This is a really full delivery on the stumps, to which Sabbir chooses to sweep. Not the right shot, and that's why he misses altogether. First impact with the front pad, then the back pad. He's in line with all three stumps. Looks like a pretty straightforward call from umpire Erasmus"

They do have to check lbw as well... Strikes pad a long way outside off, and it's bouncing waaay over, according to Hawkeye, so Shakib survives."
"steps out, nearly yorks himself and jams his bat down to dig it out to silly point. Vijay misses the stumps with a left-handed throw, trying to catch him out of his crease, and concedes an ovethrow"

"length ball turning towards off stump, stays back to defend towards silly point"
"tossed up slower, overpitches a little, outside leg, and he clips to the right of midwicket"
"there's the slog-sweep again. Out of the rough, and he shovels it away over wide mid-on"
"and again, this time gets the full swing of his bat into the slog-sweep. This one pitches in just the right slot for him and he gets a one-bounce four for it"
"down the track now, gets close to the pitch of this one and clips it to long-on"
"back of a length on off stump, goes on the back foot and forces it back towards Ashwin"
"back of a length again, defended off the back foot towards silly point"
"stays back to a much fuller ball on off stump, defends to silly point again"
"now he draws him forward with some flight, and it's an uncertain stride forward. He's late on his front-foot defensive and it turns and jumps past his outside edge"
"quicker ball, too straight, ends up sliding down leg and hitting the pad as Shakib misses the flick"
"goes back to a length ball on middle stump, defends to silly point"
"on a length on middle, worked through midwicket for a couple, went deep in his crease"
"slow through the air, straight too. Mahmudullah comes forward and defends the ball into the leg side"
another big stroke. Exuberant. Just have to calculate which is safer. Mahmudullah runs down and smears an attempted lofted drive through midwicket for some runs
"flat on off, defended"
"overly full on off, Mahmudullah comes forward and smothers the spin nicely"
"defended back, straight and accurate"
"back of a length on off stump, defended into the off side"

"back of a length, slides on with the angle towards middle stump, goes back and defends into the pitch"
"flighted ball on middle stump, presses forward and blocks it back to the bowler"
length ball on off stump and a very uncertain forward stride from Shakib. Manages to defend into the covers but not very convincingly

"length ball sliding down leg, tucked away into the backward square leg region"
"full on middle and off, blocked back to the bowler"
"legbreak pitching in the rough outside off and turning sharply. Shakib leaves it, and it doesn't miss off stump by all that much. An interesting end to a good day's cricket from India"
"tosses it up onto middle, Mahmudullah yanks it out of the blockhole and back to the bowler"
"drives smoothly back down the ground, getting inside the line of a flighted delivery on middle and leg"
"that's lovely bowling, corrects his line to bowl on off stump, gets the ball to drift and turn. Defends to silly point"
"sliders on with the arm, into middle and leg. Mahmudullah goes for a swipe into the leg side, and gets an inside edge because it dips on him."
"keeps low a bit, but since this is a slow pitch, Mahmudullah is able to adjust and plonk his bat down on off stump"
"lobs it over to the right-hander, on off stump, the ball only just straightens and Mahmudullah covers it well"
"but don't tell Shakib that, he lunges at a full and <i>wide</i> delivery and almost plops it back to mid-off. Reaches the fielder on the bounce"
"back of a length on off stump, Shakib hangs his bat out and glides it to point"
"<b>that's a beauty</b>, leaping past the outside edge, as Umesh pitches it on a good length and makes it jag away off the seam. Shakib tries to defend, but this is almost a 140kph offbreak, so he has little chance of making connection"
"strikes it sweetly to cover, leaning into a fuller delivery outside off and finding the fielder"
"on the pads and Shakib is quality enough to flick it through to deep square leg. That's good batting, making sure to profit off the bad ball"
"covers the line of a shortish delivery coming into his body, quite slowly though the speedgun indicates it is 137 kph"
"hares down the track, gets to the pitch of a flighted delivery, and drums it back at the bowler"
looks to shovel another tossed up delivery outside off into the leg side - stepping out again - and gets a leading edge past Jadeja's right
"that's the bulls-eye, you know Jadeja's accurate and here is proof. There's a little patch of rough on a good length outside the off stump and he absolutely nails it. There's <b>a massive explosion of dust</b>, as the ball lurches at Shakib, who despite being deep in his crease, is undone by the turn and bounce, hits the top glove and goes to short leg. Smart catch as well, from Pujara"
"presses forward on off stump, defends"
"moves sweetly back, judging the good length of the ball early, and that allows him to block as calmly as ever"
"pushes it into the pads, Mushfiqur nudges it away, off the thigh pad, to long leg"
"full and weaving into the right-hander, Mahmudullah, by virtue of playing late, is more than capable against it"
"short and wide, and it could have been crashed for four had Mahmudullah's feet moved back and across. Since they are stagnant, he is beaten"
"back of a length, into the pads, Mahmudullah flicks to the straighter short midwicket"
plants the bat in front of pad to make sure he reduces the chances of leg-before. <b>Umesh is getting the ball to reverse</b>. Another weapon for India.
"goes for the bouncer, outside off, Mahmudullah evades it"
"beautiful leave. This is on a fourth-fifth stump line, and with Umesh darting the ball in through the air, it could have been understandable if Mahmudullah was sucked forward to defend. But he may well have picked the shine of the ball to be on the outside and lets it go confidently"
right back in his crease for a good length ball on off stump
"seeing Mushfiqur constantly moving back, Jadeja fires in a fuller one, to see if he can catch the batsman on the move and pin him lbw.  The Bangladesh captain adjusts well. Great cricket"
"into the pads, Mushfiqur nudges it to short leg"
"now pulls out the sweep, seeing a well flighted delivery on off stump, knowing he can reach it with the horizontal bat and puts it to the left of square elg"
"inches forward to a good length ball, which he defends with the angled bat because it is turning away from him"
"now defends inside the line, expecting the flighted delivery to come straight on, but Jadeja manages to make it dip, creates distance between bat and ball. That allows it to pitch and turn to take the outside edge."
"back of a length, well outside off, Mahmudullah ignores it like a bad ad"
"reverses the ball into Mahmudullah, who waits and waits, and then rolls the wrists on top of the half-volley on leg stump to place it right of the short midwicket"
"back of a length and outside off, Mahmudullah plants it at cover point"
"squares him up, with a back of a length delivery that curves away off the seam this time, not necessarily in the air. That's why Mahmudullah has no early warning and is caught off guard. Credit to him that he plays with soft hands and makes sure the ball goes down before reaching KL Rahul at first slip"
"well played, he commits to the shot so late, and even though he gets an outside edge to the ball that straightens, it goes down and past gully's right"
flicks the one tailing into his pads to square leg
comes forward to the pitch of a flighted delivery on off stump and blocks
"steps down the track, making room on the leg side, and drives to mid-off"
"this one doesn't turn as much, and Mushfiqur lunging forward to block gets an inside edge"
shifts his weight back to a length delivery outside off and keeps it out
leans forward outside off and blocks
smothers the turn on this well-flighted delivery outside off
"back of a length and outside off, pats it to cover"
"<b>so close</b> to one of those two short midwickets. The reversing ball, coming into Mahmudullah, is forcing him to play the flick, and if he doesn't keep it down, as is the case here, Pujara and Vijay standing about five feet away from each other, are in with a chance. Here, somehow, he bisects them"
"lovely batting. This is seam movement, into the right-hander, which means the ball doesn't really move in the air, does its bit only after pitching. Mahmudullah, so conscious of playing as late as possible, waits and then brings the bat down rapidly and straight to protect the off stump"
""
"back of a length and outside off, Mahmudullah is drawn into playing at this because of Umesh's inswing previously. This is the advantage of having a bowler capable of moving the ball both ways"
"<b>ripper</b> to end the over. This is back of a length, in the off-stump corridor, Mahmudullah has to play at it, he can't trust the bounce on a fifth day pitch, nor can he trust that this won't dart in. So he pushes at the ball and is beaten by the movement away from his bat"
"shortish delivery outside leg, aimed at the rough, Mushfiqur flicks it through square leg"
keeps back to a ball pitching outside leg and blocks. Better to kick those balls away
"comes forward, putting bat in front of pad, to block with the inside edge towards short leg"
"it's flat, pitches outside leg, Mahmudullah is able to go deep in his crease and flick it through midwicket"
"sweeps out of the rough, but Kohli at leg slip is quite alert, comes right at him and he fields it cleanly"
"lobs it up at Mushfiqur's toes, he pulls them aside and brings the straight bat down on it"
"the reverse swing makes the ball slip down leg, Mahmudullah tries to glance it fine but the movement is too much for him. Poor Saha, he almost gets a broken finger trying to cover this ball. The ball rolls along the ground, bounces in front of him. Good thing he got his body behind it. Top keeper"
"shortish and outside off, directs it off the open face through point"
"back of a length and outside off, punches it to short cover"
"full, reverse swinging in, Mushfiqur plays a deft little leg glance, but India's got cover on the boundary"
"full, on leg stump, Mushfiqur pulls his feet out of the way and blocks."
"full on middle, defends"
"Kohli sticks his right hand out to grab the ball from going past him, pretty hot reflexes, but the good length ball, pitching outside leg, does not take bat as Mahmudullah flicks"
"full, pitching outside leg, flicks past Kohli's left, keeps it down as well"
"finally, he pads up a good length ball pitching well outside leg"
"tosses it up outside leg, Mahmudullah sweeps, gets a bit of a top-edge, but it's enough to find the long leg boundary. Risky shot though, hitting out out of the rough"
sticks his pad out to a good length ball pitching outside leg.
"but the very next ball, he goes for a flick to a flighted delivery outside leg - he could leave that, or pad up to that - and gets a leading edge. Could easily have carried to point."
"shortish and outside off, he pulls through midwicket"
"good length ball, starting outside off, veering into the top of off stump. Mahmudullah defends late and defends well"
"oooh, pins him on the pads with reverse swing - late movement at that. But middle and off were visible so this would be heading down leg. Umpire Erasmus knows that and declines the appeal"
"this straightens off the pitch and Mahmudullah only cottons onto it at the very last possible moment. Beautiful bowling from Ishant. It's the length - always full, denying the batsman the time he needs to read the way the ball moves."
"fuller and outside off, swinging into him in the air, defends to point"
"good length ball, starting well outside off, but ending where Mahmudullah knows his stumps are under threat. Defends"
"pads up to a length delivery pitching outside leg stump. Good ploy from the batsman. Puts the rough out of play, which India do not want"
"ball pitching outside leg, meet front pad."
"comes down the track, tries to defend with bat and pad close together"
"pushes it through, full on leg stump, Mushfiqur goes back and blocks. Just about"
"oooh, he reverse sweeps a 97 kph delivery from outside leg stump to the third man boundary. Top shot. Very difficult to pull off"
moves back to a quick delivery pitching outside leg and flicks. Doesn't get bat to it though
dabs it towards cover and set off for a quick single. Ends up risky because it's Jadeja fielding there. Mushfiqur took a little time to get into top gear
"heaves it over long leg, beautiful cricket. He reads the length early, and with Ishant bowling at the stumps, he can even preempt the line. Stays on the back foot, swivels, and pulls over the boundary"
"good length ball on off stump, blocks"
"back of a length and outside off, Mushfiqur, caught on the crease, looking for the ball to come into him, is beaten by the one that goes away"

"pitches outside leg, Mushfiqur pads up and Jadeja appeals for lbw, he really shouldn't."
"aims for the footmarks outside leg again, Mushfiqur flicks it instinctively because the ball doesn't turn, and it rushes him"
"wallop! Brilliant strike from Mahmudullah, stepping down the track, making room outside leg, knowing Jadeja's line of attack, and lofting the ball cleanly over mid-off"
"now on the other side, looking to hit some of the close-in fielders out of his space. Runs down the track, again he preempts the line of the ball to be outside leg and hits through the line."
"the bowler pulls his length back, Mahmudullah is waiting for this too, and is able to retain strike with a flick to midwicket. That's drinks"
"back of a length and outside off, Mahmudullah refuses to play"
"back of a length delivery holding its line outside off, Mahmudullah picks it just about early enough to leave again. He was initially set up for the forward defensive"

"back around the wicket now, tossing it up outside off, Mushfiqur comes forward to block"
"flatter delivery on middle, Mushfiqur nudges it to the right of midwicket to bring up the fifty partnership"
"fires it in onto middle again, Mahmudullah dabs it through vacant midwicket"
"loops it up, slower in the air, on middle and leg. Mushfiqur defends with bat in front of pad, gets an inside edge for a single through midwicket. It is vacant to tempt the batsman to close the bat face and maybe get a leading edge"
"good length ball on middle, Mahmudullah blocks"
"there's an inside edge, and India accept umpire Wilson's call, don't go for the review. This is the ball Jadeja bowls overs and overs to set up. The slider, in line with off stump and moving into the right-hander. Mahmudullah reads it only just in time, defending the ball and getting something on it"
"races down the track, gets to the pitch of the tossed up offbreak on off stump and drills it back to the bowler"
"gorgeous batting. Bangladesh do not want Ashwin to settle, and they know there is very little rough outside off stump. So Mushfiqur comes down the track and gleefully hits against the turn through cover. He can do that without any risk, considering he got to the pitch of the ball"
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
"that's one shot too much. Ashwin has sensed that the batsman wants to attack him, so he pulls the length back just enough. Disguises it though, by ensuring it is still a tossed up delivery. Mushfiqur rushes down the track, doesn't get to the pitch, still backs himself to clear mid-off, but mistimes his shot badly. Easy catch to the fielder running back and Ashwin celebrates by waving both his hands in the air to soak in the applause from the school kids"
"who cares if your team is playing to draw the game, and it's the best bowler in the world bowling in his home conditions. Mahmudullah runs down the track, is deceived by the dip, gets an inside edge as he slog and it bounces just short of midwicket"

"loads of turn, and Sabbir trying to cut is so badly cramped. Manages to get it to point. Attacking Ashwin is becoming a problem"

"tosses it up on middle and leg, smothers it"

"back over the wicket, and Sabbir defends a good length ball on off stump"
"meets the length ball under his eyes, outside off"

pads up to a flighted delivery on leg stump
"good length ball outside leg stump, blocks"
"short of a length and outside off, Mahmudullah looks pretty driving off the back foot, but the connection is off the bottom of the bat. And oh, Sabbir drops his bat and tries to take cover from the throw from Jadeja, could have been run-out had it been a direct hit"
"back of a length and outside off, blocks"
"full and and outside off, Mahmudullah comes forward and sends it to cover"
"nudges a fuller delivery on off stump to the right of midwicket, who gets a hand to it to prevent the single"
"138kph, loads of reverse swing, the direction taking the ball down the leg side, and past the flicking bat of Mahmudullah"
"nicks through the slip cordon to bring up a half-century. First one in 11 innings. This is full and wide outside off, inviting the drive, and the reverse swing, taking the ball away from the bat, takes the outside edge and dribbles away past first slip's right"
"whoa, he's hurtling down the pitch, is deceived by the dip on the ball, but still goes for the slog. Mistimes to midwicket, and Jadeja sends a rocked throw that Ashwin doesn't want to get behind. Four overthrows"

"good length ball on off stump, quicker and flatter, defends"
"goes wide of the crease for a loopy delivery outside off stump, Sabbir skips down the track and pastes it over long-on. Ridiculously good connection. The drift actually works against Ashwin this time, giving the batsman more room to hit through the line"
"back of a length, coming in late off the pitch at 136 kph, the batsman, preparing to punch it through cover mistimes the shot"
"shortish and outside off, cuts it to the right of Jadeja at backward point. He runs with the ball, head craned back, eyes right on it, feet moving without fear considering he is basically running without seeing what is in front of him. Took a fantastic catch like that on the last day of the Chennai Test against England"
"fuller delivery outside off, defends"
"good length ball, starting on middle, so the reverse swing takes it well down leg the leg side. Beats the inside edge as he tries to flick. Hits the pad and wanders to long leg"
"too quick for Sabbir, as he tries to flick a ball hitting back of a length and veering in off the pitch, sharply and rapidly. The batsman tries a flick, gets an inside edge, off the pad, and through vacant first slip. The man in the cordon is standing well wide. <b>Chance for India</b>?"
"plays the cut off length, for this ball is short, but not entirely wide. That's why he mistimes it to backward point"
"full, but flat, on leg stump, Mahmudullah flicks through midwicket"
"good length ball on off stump, covers it"
"nearly takes out his partner at the non-striker's end. Quick feet, coming down the track, making room for himself to hit through the line of a flighted delivery just a shade outside off. Four to long-off"
"pulls his length, and the line shifts to middle stump. Sabbir blocks"
"good length ball on middle, the straight bat is in front of pad"
"that looks like the carrom ball, aimed at the rough outside leg. Doesn't hit target, so there isn't as much spin. Sabbir blocks, the bat coming across from slip, facing mid-on-ish, giving the bowler a good chance of securing a leading edge"

"short and wide outside off, cracks it to the point boundary."

"spears it into middle and leg, Sabbir defends with his front foot pushed out of the way of the straight bat"

pushes it into the covers
"drifts it down leg, at a slower pace though, 83 kph, Mahmudullah goes for the sweep but fails to connect. Saha get get to the left quickly enough, had no chance really"

moves back to a flatter delivery on leg stump and deflects it to long leg
"shortish, Sabbir cuts it behind point, doing well to make room against a quick, flat dart on off stump. Hits it with one hand, the top one flying off the bat"
"<b>turn</b> as he makes the batsman reach for it outside the off stump. Beautiful bowling. Slows it down, tosses it up, Sabbir pushes at the ball, angling the bat and it jumps past his outside edge. Good keeping from Saha"
"big appeal for lbw, as Jadeja pins the batsman in front of leg stump. Has it straightened enough? Umpire Wilson says no so Kohli goes for a review. There's no bat there. Now for ball-tracking, impact in line, but the ball hits only the outside half of leg stump, so the on-field call stays."
"flatter delivery on off stump, defends"
"flights it on off stump, blocks"
"back of a length delivery, straightening down the line off the pitch. Mahmudullah is squared up by the late movement as he defends"
"good stop by gully, Rahane diving to his left and stopping the ball heading to the third man boundary dead in its tracks. Mahmudullah will feel disappointed, having placed a neat little glide off the back foot"
"defends, close to the body, and as late as possible to send the full ball on off stump to deep point"
"traps him in front of the stumps. Erasmus gives it lbw, but Sabbir wants a second look, goes for a review. This looks plumb though, unless there's bat involved. And there is nothing there. This is a good length ball, pitching outside off, coming in with the angle, stays a touch low, and beats the batsman's straight-bat defence. Should he have been playing back? Well, considering the ball didn't rise as much as he thought, he couldn't have done much with it"
"<b>beats him</b> with a back of a length ball at 139 kph and it jags away from Mehedi's flashing blade. He's in no position to play the slice off the back foot, his feet going to the leg side and his hands the other way"
"fuller delivery outside off, Mehedi comes forward in an effort to play the picture perfect block but the late movement away from him, off the pitch, trumps all that effort"
"oooh, there's a stumping chance, but a very difficult one. This is pitched so full, almost on a yorker length, for that is where the rough is to the right-hander. Mahmudullah drives over the ball, and loses his balance. Saha is in line with the ball, but doesn't collect it cleanly enough"
"leans forward to a fuller delivery on off stump, defends"
"<b>beats him</b> with a tossed up delivery outside off, making Mahmudullah reach away from his body with the forward defensive. Lovely bowling"

"back of a length and outside off, needs no shot"
"full on off stump, gets down low to defend"
"good bouncer, angles it on off stump at 140 kph, Mehedi is forced to take evasive action. Oversteps the line though, looking for the extra pace"
"back of a length and outside off, way outside off actually, no shot necessary"
"outside edge as Ishant brings the batsman forward, in the off-stump corridor. The ball straightens and somehow sneaks through the gap between second slip and gully"
"now the inswing, Mehedi leaves and the off stump only just survives. Tough work, perhaps even more than facing the spinners, with both of India's quicks reversing the ball every which way"
"good length ball on off stump, defends and gets an inside edge as the ball doesn't turn as much as Mahmudullah thinks"
"loops it up, slower through the air 79 kph, Mahmudullah drives into the covers"

"pitches it full on off stump, but Mahmudullah stays back, wanting the extra time against the pace and the reverse swing. Defends"
"back of a length and outside off, Mahmudullah leaves it, although he could do better to move his front foot across to protect off stump, just in case the ball reverses in. Then again, he can turn around and say he picked the movement away from the bat"

"back of a length and outside off, Mahmudullah is almost ready to push at it, but recognises it isn't in line with his body and so he can leave it. Indecision, but he corrects it just in time"
"found long leg with a top-edged pull. What's with Ishant and short balls? This originally doesn't look threatening, which is why Mahmudullah sets up for the pull, but then it climbs on him, cramps him for room, and so he mistimes the shot. Who knew it'd be the quicks doing the damage on the last day of a Hyderabad Test?"
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
"whoa, that's a weird leave. He drops his wrist, hides it behind his front pad. Good technique against a short ball, but this is full and reversing into the right-hander."
"<b>huge shout for lbw</b> as Ishant gets a full delivery to reverse sharply into the right-hander. Umpire Erasmus says no but Ishant is absolutely certain, demands a review, but India do not have any. Might be a good thing too, this delivery, though the batsman was trying to play all around it, with the bat face closed, hit him outside off.  <b>Oh wait, the impact is in line</b>. All three reds."

"full on off stump, this delivery holding its line. Mehedi blocks"
"<b>dropped by Vijay at first slip</b>. This is a top spell by Ishant. Reversing the ball both ways, making it move off the pitch too. This one straightens after being angled into the right-hander, and Mehedi is badly squared up, his feet going leg side, his hands pushing the other way. Regulation nick, coming at a comfortable height, just around his stomach. Poor miss"

"back of a length on middle, Kamrul taps it to the right of mid-on, looks for a single, but nothing there"
"appeal for lbw as Bhuvneshwar makes the shortish delivery move into the right-hander. Kamrul flicks across the line, is a bit slow with his shot too. Would have gone up over the stumps, says Erasmus with a shake of the head"
"fuller delivery outside off, blocks"
"turns it off the straight, off the undisturbed part of the pitch, making the ball dip on the right-hander and take the inside edge onto pad"

This is quick, pitching just outside off, and ripping away past the middle of the bat as he tries to defend. Top take from Saha, rising up with the ball, his gloves at his chest when he takes it. Was there an edge though? Needs confirmation from technology. And Ultra-edge says there is glove. That's why the batsman didn't review"

Finally, he tags in the third umpire, and the soft signal is out. No bat there, so the catch should go out the window. They don't check the lbw though, not out flashes on the screen. But wait, Kohli has reviewed for lbw. So <b>two reviews for the same ball</b>. Pitched in line with leg, straightens enough to hit the front pad in line, and crashes into the stumps too. Three reds. <b>India win</b>"
