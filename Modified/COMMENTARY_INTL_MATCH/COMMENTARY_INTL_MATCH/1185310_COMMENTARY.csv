"back of a length, good areas as Roy hangs on the back foot to gauge the pace of the wicket"
"solid on the back foot, no great pace in the deck as Roy waits and waits to push the ball back whence it came"
"jabbed back down the line of the ball, excellent areas once again, although the umpire seems to be a touch interested in Hendricks' followthrough"
"walking across the stumps, a shimmy off the pads to short midwicket and England have their first ODI run since July 14"
a yawning leave as Hendricks fires one out wide to the right-handed Bairstow. A very tidy first over
"on the back foot, wide of off stump and short enough for Roy to ease a drive on the up into the covers"
"short, and slammed hard out to midwicket. Straight at the fielder who takes the pace off, but really should have done better. They jog the single for the misfield"
"whittled off the legs, out to backward square"
"better line and length from Ngidi, no great pace - 136kph - but met on the back foot with a high elbow"
"dabbing the bat at a wide one, out to backward point. England haven't quite got to grips with the lack of pace in this surface yet. But it is a mere 11 balls of reconnaissance!"
no pace once more as Roy presses a drive out to cover
"<B>cracked on the up through long-on!</B> That's more like it from Roy, he's got the pace now"
<B>pounded on the up through long off!</B> Good afternoon Jason Roy ... we've been awaiting you

"tucked off the legs, out for the single"
"a compact drive, sweetly timed but straight at mid-off"
"pumped into the covers once again, Bairstow is playing catch-up already, as his partner has had the bulk of the strike so far. Might take a ball or two to calibrate fully..."
"nip off the seam from back of a length, a bit of a flaccid flat-footed poke from Roy, who looks a little disgusted with himself"
"<B>sweet timing once again!</B> Turning the wrists on impact, as Ngidi shapes one into the pads and pays the price, behind square"
"belted from back of a length, in the air for a while but a yard short of backward point"
"outside off, wafted down to deep backward point, a long chase round the boundary and they come back for two"
"<B>flipped off the toes, and dropped!</B> Phehlukwayo at short midwicket, stooping to his left, and that should have been taken!"
"outside off, a chastised leave-alone from Roy to complete the over"
"solid block out to cover, standing tall on the back foot"
"angled bat, out to point. A very straight catcher standing on the popping crease at mid-off, just getting in his eyeline"
"tapped to short cover, looking for the single, but that straight man reacts quickly to gather"
"banged in short, an aggressive pull, but Bairstow toe-ends the shot straight back to the bowler. He was through the stroke too quickly"

"good length from Ngidi, tight line too, Bairstow eases into a defensive push back to the bowler"
"solid line and length from over the wicket, pushed firmly back to the bowler"
"<B>up and over!</B> Not entirely convincing, but he played the percentage well, driving on the up from a full length and eluding the man in close at mid-ff"
"<B>squared up and a leading edge scoots over short midwicket!</B> So nearly the breakthrough, Roy was caught on the hop, quite literally, but van der Dussen couldn't stretch high enough, and <B>hobbles off with a sore ankle after landing</B>..."
tapped into the off side
"a waft across the line, thumps the pad but that pitched well outside leg"
"<B>Bairstow holds the pose on a lofted drive</B>, but the ball plugs inside the rope. He signals for a new bat, that one didn't provide him with nearly enough ping!"

"outside off, opens the face for a dab to backward point"
"flicked on the up, over square leg, solid connection but there's a man back on the rope to tidy up"
"short and wide, and <B>upper-cut over cover!</B> Excellent connection, he needed a step-ladder to reach it, but got good bat through the stroke in the end"
"slower ball, and Bairstow is confounded on an attempted mow through point. The ball scuds below his swishing blade"
"<B>clattered with intent, up and over midwicket!</B> Up comes England's fifty, as this pair of record-breakers keep their ODI alliance cooking"
stabbed out to the off side
"<B>a yawning lofted drive, looking to clear long on, but no!</B> Roy knew he'd muffed the stroke the moment he played it, a scudding flat catch straight to Hendricks, set back at long-on. The end of a threatening innings, and respite for South Africa"

"head right over the ball, and defended back to the bowler"
"tidy areas once more, Root bides his time"
nurdled off the legs to get Root off the mark
"back of a length, jabbed down to third man for another single"

"content to rotate the singles for now, another nurdle to mid-on"

solid in defence
"width, but a fine intercept at gully as Root eases into a late cut"

"back of a length, a hint of turn from over the wicket, cracked out to cover"
"pressed firmly into the gap at point, off the back foot"
"swept, off a <B>massive top-edge, but massive enough to clear the fielder!</B> A bit lucky there, but short fine leg was up, so it could have been a calculated risk"
"tucks the single, walking across the stumps to create the angle into the leg side"
back and across to defend
"clipped off the legs for another single, calmly done"
leaning into a defensive push
"<B>late cut, but in the air for a while!</B> That one bounced more than intended, and scuffs past gully at a catchable height"
"easing into a sweetly timed clip to leg, weight leaning into the ball on impact. Intercepted with a tumble inside the rope"
"worked to the leg side once more, gaps to be found as this pair continue to milk the middle overs"
"banged in short, Morgan barely breaks out of his stance to drop a not-entirely-subtle hint that that might have been a wide..."
"cracked with power straight to short cover. Bump ball, but the crowd are excited"
"rolls the fingers on a fuller length, good areas, Morgan drills a drive to point"
"full toss, crunched to mid-on with a straight blade"
"turn from a wide line, away from the left-hander, who can't connect on a late cut"
"Morgan advances to sweep, excellent connection,  but a <B>brilliant intercept at backward square, and here's trouble!</B> Root is committed to the single, turns on his heel, but van der Dussen gets to his knees quickly, and <B>pings out the middle stump from 30 yards!</B> That is outstanding work, and Root knows he's a goner, as do the fielders! A moment of inspiration, and can that spark South Africa?"
defended into the off side with a full face
"full on off stump, defended back down the pitch"
"gone, Bavuma grabs it in the slips and <strong>South Africa are jubilant</strong>! Length ball, Morgan dropped deep in his crease looking to steer it down to third man, got a thin edge on it and Bavuma, diving low to his left, takes a sharp chance. England wobbling..."

"good turn on a length, hacked back to the bowler via the inside half of the bat"
"looks to slog sweep, <b>struck on the pad, and given!</b> Shamsi is off on his travels in celebration, Imran Tahir-style, but after a chat with Denly, Banton <b>decides to review</b>. Struck on the back thigh, kneeling down - the same height as the knee roll on his front pad. Impact is <b>umpire's call</b> - only a tiny fraction away from being outside the line - and crashing into the top of off stump, which means Banton is on his way!"

"<B>grr, take that!</B> Denly takes his frustration out on the ball, belting a slower ball high to the leg side. Not timed, but that's hardly the point. He's cross now!"
"<B>clubbed with venom over the covers!</B> Don't make Joe Denly angry ... back and across, and pummelled with power into the gap!"

"banged in short, and wide, Denly pulls, and under-edges through to the keeper"

"a wipe off a full length, down to third man"

"flashed hard to cover, another scampered single"
