wants a yorker and instead sprays a full toss on middle and leg that's heaved over deep midwicket
gets the back leg out to throw the bowler off guard and ends up staying put. Gets a fuller delivery  that is swatted down to long-on. And that's some brilliant running as well
tries to pull a delivery that'snot short enough and skews it off the bottom of the bat to midwicket
"wide yorker, well-bowled. Southee jams the bat down and can't manage any contact"
"length ball, tries to swat it away and skews it off the toe end into the off side"
full and angling into leg-stump. It's almost a yorker but Santnet brilliantly moves away and gets underneath before drilling it through the region between midwicket and mid-on
tries to pull a short ball but gets severely tucked up as the bowler's angle follows him and he gets a bottom edge to the keeper
Santner hits this pull in the direction of the breeze but he has holed out to cow corner. Gets on top of the bounce nicely and even makes pretty good connection. But probably not as well-middled we he would have liked. Smart take by Raees
"brilliant. Top shot to end the innings. Walks across early enough, almost telegraphs it. Amit adjusts poorly. Fires it full and across him and Southee simply helps it on its way to fine leg"
"length ball on middle and leg, tucked into the midwicket region. No swing there"
"similar line, similar length, dabbed through midwicket for the first runs of the chase"
"poor delivery. Not getting the shape he's looking for. Full and on the pads, clipped away just behind square leg"
"looks mighty close and given. That looked plumb. Azhar contemplates on a review. He takes it but I highly doubt this will help Pakistan. This was full and straight. Just came on with the angle and Azhar looks to flick across the line. No inside edge, HotSpot confirms, as does Snicko. This will come down to ball-tracking. Hitting the top of leg, so on-field call remains. Pakistan lose their review"
"short, banged in down the leg side"
"another appeal and given. Azam falls for a two-ball duck, and there is no review available because Azhar used it up. FInally gets that shape into the batsman, but this one seems to be a harsh call. Kicks up from a back of a length and hits Babar above the knee roll. Height definitely makes this a dodgy call"

cuts in viciously from a short of a length and completely tucks up Hafeez as he inside-edges to the pad
<b>is that an lbw? Inside edge may have saved him</b>. Tries to flick and gets a bit of bat to it as it hits him in front. Boult doesn't bother appealing
"fuller, pushed down the ground"
another back of a length delivery that is inside-edged into the pad
<b>in the air and taken</b>. Loose shot from Hafeez. No control whatsoever. That's a terrible shot with a boundary rider at backward square leg. Hooks a short ball that gets big on him and Southee runs to his left to snaffle it

Sarfraz has been sent back. He stays put for just a moment and it makes you wonder if it's another dodgy. But tell you what. That doesn't seem so bad. Seems plumb. He brings the front foot forward to a loopy length ball that straightens down the middle and leg channel and pins him in front

<b>is that a drop?</b>. Faheem Ashraf misjudges the pace on this fuller delivery and leans forward early to chip a drive. Mitchell Santner bends forward from mid-off and puts down a simple catch. That should have really been taken. Definitely carried
"that's what pace can do for a batsman. Slashes an upper cut at the sight of width, and with the ball coming on at that clip, it's enough connection to carry it all the way over the boundary"
