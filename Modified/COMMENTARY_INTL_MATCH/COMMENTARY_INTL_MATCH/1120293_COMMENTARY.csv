"four to start. Short and wide from Sanjaya, and that's one area you don't want to bowl to Zaman. A thick slash over slip for four. Margin of error reduces to almost nothing when it's short and wide"
"good comeback. On a length on leg, worked away towards square leg for one. Some definite inswing to the left-hander"
"<strong>big appeal.</strong> Only height could save Amin. It's full and straight, swinging back in prodigiously after pitching, beats the inside edge and hits Amin high on the front pad. Probably the right call"
"oops, no, no, no. Can't do that. On a length on leg, worked away with the angle of swing to square leg. Nice soft hands. He has overstepped and Zaman has a freebie to come"
"a big wind-up and swing but no connection. Full, swinging in, hits Zaman on the pad, one leg bye to short fine leg"
"good delivery that. Full outside off, some swing back in. Amin defends tentatively, looking for one. A bit nervous"
"drifts down leg, off the pad down to short fine leg for none. Untidy start from Sanjaya"
"fantastic fielding. Full down leg, worked down to short fine leg, who dives to his right to save four"
"good single. Full on leg, worked away towards midwicket for one"
"quick on the pads, hurtling them in, worked to wide mid-on for one"
"overpitched on leg, another simple nudge towards midwicket. Good defensive Powerplay bowling"
"shortens the length slightly, around middle and off, played into the leg side"
"just wide of long-off. A bit of air on this, Amin runs down, looking to bludgeon this straight but there is just a bit of spin that takes the outside half and slices over cover. Long-off runs to his right to clean up"
"good length outside off, punched away to mid-off"
"full around off, Zaman lets his hands loose, right through the line, looking to hit the ball too hard. Some swing takes the ball towards the inside half of the bat, one to deep square leg"
"a yorker outside off, jammed away by the crease. Zaman calls for one, quality single"
"wide of midwicket. Zaman looking to hit these balls coming into him through the off side. Definitely wrong options. Full on middle and leg, the ball skews past midwicket for a couple"
"full and wide outside off, just inside the wide tramline. Well bowled, I love that delivery, such a good defensive option, a free dot ball"
"bad timing. Full on leg, Zaman's wild swing clears midwicket for a couple. Square leg runs around. Zaman has to rely on timing much more than his power"
"that's just beautiful. Flight around middle, Amin runs to the pitch, gets there and lofts the ball over cover for four. Shot of the evening so far, not many good ones yet"
"fired in on the pads, worked to deep midwicket"
"too quick again, darted in on the pads, Zaman runs down, misses the ball, hits the pads back to the bowler"
"makes room, looking to open the off side, but it's fast and straight. Pushed towards cover for one"
"another one that is very quick on the pads, nudged to deep midwicket"
"good option from Zaman, better stop from the fielder running back from square leg. Flat and straight, Zaman stays low and sweeps the ball over square leg. Always just wanted to get the ball over the fielder. Pulled back just inside, think that was Shanaka"
""
"good length on off, pushed back to the bowler. The perfect delivery to Zaman. Sri Lanka have been excellent so far"
"oh no, that's tripe. Rubbish. Short slow delivery well down leg, Zaman goes after it and pulls past short fine leg's right. Would have been short and wide to the right-hander. Help yourself"
"full around off, pushed to mid-off where Thisara can't prevent one. Another good single"
"shortish length around off, dabbed towards point for one. Another good single"
"powerful hit, but not great timing. Full around leg, smashed to deep midwicket. Deep square leg gets around"
"lovely bowling. Gets a bit of turn this time. Slow around middle and off, defended back to the bowler"
"fired in, quick on the pads, clipped past square leg for a couple."
"called wide. Short down leg, Amin misses the ball when he is out of his crease. The fielder fumbles the collection. The umpire isn't sure, but stretches his arms out"
"short on leg, worked to deep midwicket for one"
"comes charging at Gunathilaka, full down leg, hammered to long-off for one"
"short again, on the pads again, worked to deep midwicket. Fantastic defensive bowling"
"hammered! Sees Zaman coming and shortens the length, but Zaman doesn't mind slapping the ball through the line with a cross bat. Smashed past mid-on for four"
"strays on the pads first up, worked away towards deep backward square leg. Fine leg runs around to keep Pakistan to one"
"shortish around off, dabbed towards backward point for a quick single."
"a good short ball, digs this in on leg, pulled uppishly to deep square leg. Bad timing again"
"slingy action, full on middle, almost a yorker. Skewed to point"
"another good bouncer. Pings Zaman <strong>on the helmet</strong>, hits him and ricochets down to third man for a leg bye. Harried for pace."
"good length around off, shovelled to deep midwicket. Another tidy over"
"very quick on middle, outside-halved towards the sweeper cover"
"again looking to hit the ball too hard. Full on leg, Zaman comes charging and hits the ball down to long-on. Just focus on timing, if you're strong, the power will do the rest"
driven down to long-on for another single
"darted in on the pads, a clip to deep midwicket. Four singles off four balls"
"a low full toss, Amin gave himself plenty of room before the bowler released. Slapped to long-on"
"and is that the wicket? Sri Lanka think so, the umpires confer. Think he's gone. Flat outside off, the ball sliding on with the arm. Zaman sees some width, and tries to cut, but is beaten for pace again. The ball misses the outside edge but doesn't miss the outside of off stump. That's Sri Lanka's first wicket. A big 'not out' flashes on the big screen, but that was clearly a mistake. Zaman walks off eventually."
"quick on off, worked to deep midwicket for one"
"flight outside off, Babar straides forward and drives to long-off"
"can't bowl there. Short down leg, Amin gets in position early and pulls past short fine leg's right. No chance for anyone, well placed"

"too much flight, overpitched outside off stump, drilled to long-off"
"short around off, skids on, pushed back to the bowler"
"short on leg, worked to deep midwicket for one."

"shortish and wide outside off, carved past point for a couple"
"drifts on the pads, clipped to deep square leg"
"short around off, pushed back to the bowler."
"71 after the first 10 overs. Sri Lanka will be happy with that. Short and straight, worked to deep midwicket"

"shortish and wide, slashed to the sweeper cover"
"short and straight, worked away to deep midwicket"
"smashed. Pathirana drops short, Amin picks the length quickly, rocks back, gets in position early and then swats the pull into the gap between deep midwicket and square leg. Lands just inside the boundary"
"short down leg, flicked to deep midwicket"
a low full toss is drilled down to long-on
"short around off, sits up for Azam to pull to deep midwicket. Should have hit a gap there"
"full outside off, skewed down to long-on off the inside half of the bat"
"full outside off, skids on. Azam stays back and drives to the sweeper cover"
"<strong>fantastic effort from long-off</strong>, running in. Flight outside off, Amin makes room and chips the ball towards mid-off. The fielder gets there, but because of his running momentum, he wasn't in a great position to take the catch. Fine effort nonetheless."
driven down the ground for another run
"slow and straight, skids on, worked to deep midwicket"
"good catch from Thisara. Full and straight from Udana, Amin looks to hit the ball straight, but Udana's natural angle brings the ball in to the left-hander, and it may have been an offcutter too. The ball skews off the inside half of the bat, and lobs towards long-on, where Thisara runs to his left, and takes a good catch. Made a tough catch look easy, no diving, no need"

"short and wide outside off, chopped away towards the sweeper cover for one"

"good length outside off, punched away to long-on"
"short on leg, another single to deep square leg. This is just not good enough from Babar, 20 off 18. Maybe Miller fever"

"full and straight, Azam flicks towards long-on. Another single."

"full and straight, out comes the slog, inside-edged towards square leg for one"
"that's a poor ball, full outside off, the perfect length for Malik to get underneath and loft the ball over long-off. Plonks just beyond the boundary"
"superb shot. Can't keep dishing up length to Malik. Full and wide, Malik gets underneath it and drills a lofted drive over cover"
"that's just fantastic batting. Field manipulation at its very best. There are two points, which means there is a big gap beyond them. Full and wide outside off, Malik bends his knees and brings his bat up from down to hit the ball in the air. He has pierced both fielders for good measure. <strong>Shot of the day</strong>"
"full outside off, driven to deep cover for one"
"a low full toss outside off, under-edged towards square leg for one"

"a full toss outside off, quick through the air, punched to deep cover. Superb over so far"

"a low full toss outside off, worked away into a massive gap at midwicket for a couple."
"this is just great batting from Malik. A full toss outside off, slashed away through point. There is deep backward point and deep cover. Malik hits it in between them"
"a good yorker off the third. On leg, driven to long-on for one"
"superb yorker, on middle, carved down to third man for one. Not much Azam could do with that"
"that's terrible fielding from deep midwicket. Allows three extra runs. Thisara is not happy. Anpother full toss from Shanaka, heaved away to deep midwicket, who gets down but allows the ball to go through his legs."
"a low full toss on middle, driven to long-on for one. Didn't quite find his length in that over"
"full delivery outside off, drilled to long-off for one."

"right in the gap at cover point. Full and wide from Thisara, Malik gets underneath and slices the ball through cover point"
"full toss outside off, many of these, driven to long-off for one"
"another low full toss, Azam shovels one down to long-on. This hasn't been a great innings from Azam"
"great fielding. Full and wide outside off, Malik gets underneath the ball and carves over cover point. The deep cover fielder pulls the ball in, the deep point fielder cleans up."
"a low full toss down leg, worked away to deep square leg. This has been a momentum-sucking innings from Babar"
"very full, another yorker, worked to deep midwicket. Malik races back for the second"
"gets enough of that. Another full toss, a low full toss, Malik gets underneath the length and lifts the ball over deep midwicket. Not exceptional timing, but enough power. <strong>That is also Malik's fifty</strong>, sensational innings this has been"
"another full toss. This time Malik doesn't get much behind the shot. Heaves it away straight to deep midwicket, who takes a juggled catch."
"what a shot first up, plus a no-ball. A low full toss outside off, Faheem just powers a lofted drive and he has so much power that it clears deep cover comfortably. A free hit to come too"
"another six. What a cameo already by Faheem. Yet another full toss on leg, Faheem swings away and the ball clears square leg comfortably. Maaaaasive. Thisara is not pleased."
"a good yorker to finish, around off, skewed to deep midwicket and that will be the innings."
"flat on the pads to start, worked to deep square leg to get off the mark"
"shortish and straight, the ball seams back in, defended back"

"hiiigh in the air, and safe. Flat around off, Gunathilaka stays low and sweeps towards deep midwicket, long-on cleans up"

"full and straight, the ball seaming back in, inside-edged into the pad, some definite inswing"
"cleaned up! The ball swings back in, and Munaweera does not account for that. Full outside off, the ball swings back, and Munaweera plays an awful shot, trying to cut, cut inswing?! The ball finds a massive gap and hits off stump. Terrible shot selection"
"full outside off, Samarawickrama comes charging and drives through cover for a couple. Pulled inside the boundary"
"short delivery on the pads, and then off it, towards square leg"
"lovely bowling. Full and straight, the ball moving away late, pushed back to the bowler"

"good length outside off, the ball coming in, worked to midwicket"
"short and wide outside off, guided to short third man"
"swept to deep square leg, straight to the man. This is my home, I know what I'm doing insinuates Imad to Samarawickrama. Flat and straight, on middle and leg. Samarawickrama shuffles right across and sweeps, but the ball goes straight to the man on the boundary"
"flat and straight, clipped away towards square leg for a run"
"slow outside off, dabbed towards point. Some hesitation but Udawatte is back"
"short and straight, whipped away through midwicket. A generous amount of whipping through the line of that. Fine, fine shot"
"flat and straight, clipped to short fine leg"
"and three down are Sri Lanka! Falling away rapidly. Flat around off, Gunathilaka backs away, looks to hit the ball hard, too hard and the ball goes straight back to Hafeez. It's quick, Hafeez ducks, sticks up his hands and takes a sharp overhead catch. Same ol' tale."
"flat and slow around off, worked towards square leg"
"more hesitation. Short and straight, worked away to square leg for a quick single"
"oh how has that gone past? Full outside off, just a gentle drive back past the bowler. Mid-off runs to his right but has no chance because of this outfield"
nudged to midwicket
"short and straight, naggingly accurate, nudged to midwicket"
"good fielding from Azam on the boundary. Full around leg, flicked away uppishly towards deep midwicket, Azam stops the ball, but the momentum takes him past the boundary and the ball towards the boundary. As he tries to recover, he makes an unnecessary jump back in, instead of calmly coming back in, but his back foot is in contact with the ball over the boundary"
"flat and straight, driven to long-on"
"short outside off, pushed to long-on for one"

"darted in on leg, clipped towards short fine leg for one"
"short down leg, worked to deep square leg for one"
"a flat six. Too full from Shadab, Shanaka stays low and drills a powerful heave over long-on. Lots of power behind that"

"short outside off, inside-edged towards square leg"
"good length around off, inside-edged towards square leg for one more"
"short outside off, Udawatte picks the length early and wants to dispatch the ball over midwicket but fails to make any contact"
"a soft dismissal. Short on middle from Faheem, hurries Udawatte into his pull. He picks the length well but is far too late on his pull, the ball lobs off the splice and settles in midwicket's hands. Faheem has generated some impressive pace"
"back of a length and on the leg stump, cramps 'em up for room. Poked towards cover off an outside edge"
"back of a length on the leg stump again, this time Chaturanga slinks away outside leg, manufactures swinging room and carves it away fine of Hasan Ali at deep third man. He slides in the deep and cuts it off. He saves two for the hosts"

"fired outside off, Chaturanga nearly chips it right back to Imad"
"shortish and width outside off, Chaturanga steps away outside leg, creates additional room and cracks it through extra cover. Fetch that!"
"skids into the pads, tucked around the corner for a single"
"tossed outside off, non-turner, driven to cover off the front foot"
"Shanaka forays down the track, this is darted shorter on middle stump. The batsman adjusts and swats the ball aerially to wide long-on"
"good length down leg, worked down to fine leg"
"good length around off, outside-halved towards point for one"
"a good idea, but not very good execution. Short on middle and leg, Shanaka gets underneath the bouncer. Loops over him"
"good length outside off, edged down to third man"
"good length down leg, worked towards square leg"
"fullish delivery around off, defended to point. An unnecessary throw to the bowler's end and Hafeez's untidy backing up at mid-on combine to leave Sarfraz seething"
hit away into the off side for one. Hasan Ali ensuring he isn't too full
"the googly on leg, worked to deep midwicket for one"
"smashed for four. SL need a lot more. The seam-up delivery outside off, drilled over the bowler for four. Fantastic hitting"
"four more. The legbreak outside off, Shanaka gets down and nails a slog sweep nicely into the gap at midwicket"
clipped away for a run towards deep square leg
"the googly outside off, dabbed into the gap towards midwicket for a run. Long-on is quick on it"

"shortish delivery around off, another pull to deep square leg"
"good length outside off, Shanaka wafts and is beaten."
"is that the match? It's a pressure catch, Imad circles around the catch, and eventually takes it. Full around off, Shanaka swings himself off his feet. Because he wanted to hit the ball too hard, the ball hits the outside half and just lobs to midwicket. Very high in the air, good catch"
"short around off, worked to deep midwicket"
"full on middle, a sweetly-timed drive to mid-off. Can't take too long"
"good length delivery around off, carved to the sweeper cover. Just one"

"quick and straight, Chaturanga gets low in an attempt to get underneath the ball enough to lift the ball over short fine leg. He does but gets hardly any connection"
"short on middle and leg, scythed straight to Imad at point, who throws the ball at the batsman's end. Chaturanga has come down and been sent back. A direct hit would have had the batsman. Sarfraz still says something to Imad"
"terrific bouncer on leg, Thisara gets underneath the delivery"
"full down leg, thick inside edge into the pad and then towards point. Superb bowling"
"that should be it for this series. Full and straight, Chaturanga backs away and can't connect with a drive, the ball hits the stumps, the pace took the delivery under his shot. Too good from Amir."
"full delivery outside off, driven to mid-off. Another dot"
"a short delivery around off, pulled to deep square leg"
"full delivery outside off, driven to mid-off. He has timed it so badly that cover runs in, picks up and misses the stumps at the bowler's end with Prasanna diving for his life in front of him. Out had he hit"

"smashed in the gap. Short around middle, Thisara backs away and swats a pull between long-on and deep midwicket"
"now it's the short slow bouncer. Thisara is lulled into playing earlier than he should, the ball beats his pull"
"now the yorker. Full around off, driven away towards cover where there is a misfield from Hafeez, who gestures that the ball skidded on."
"the back-of-the-hand slower ball outside off, Thisara launches one high in the air, but the ball has not been timed. Much more elevation than distance. Shadab, at long-on, settles easily underneath and takes an easy one. With that, Pakistan should have no further trouble"
"strays on the pads, nudged down to fine leg for one"
"full delivery outside off, jammed out to mid-off. Amir over-runs it but recovers well"
"short on middle, pushed to Shadab at cover, who picks up cleanly and misses the stumps at the bowler's end"

"another big six. Fullish outside off, Prasanna swings through the line and the ball soars over midwicket. Not the best way for Hasan Ali to finish this series"
"full delivery on leg, pushed back to the bowler"
"Hafeez struggles but takes the catch eventually. A slower ball down leg, Pathirana is through his shot too early, the ball is chipped in the air towards midwicket. Hafeez watches the ball, backtracks slightly, juggles, wiggles but takes it"
"a slower delivery outside off, Prasanna misses his swing, wide called"
"full delivery outside off, Prasanna's big swing results in a thick edge for Sarfraz, swung himself off his feet. Malik shakes Prasanna's hands. Amir is happy."

"good length delivery on the pads, worked to deep midwicket and that's it. Pakistan <strong>complete another whitewash, taking the T20s 3-0</strong>"
