"shapes back in from outside off, Rahane shows the full face of the bat and defends it back down the pitch"
"width on offer, and crunched between cover and point. Transferred his weight onto the back foot in a jiffy to unfurl that stroke"
thick edge down to third man
"swing in the air again, comes back into middle this time, defended with soft hands"
"punched to Raina, who comes running in from cover point. Huge roar as their captain pick up the ball"
"gives him the charge, but the street-smart PK shortens his length, tapped back down the pitch"
"short ball that slides back into middle, pulled to midwicket"
driven with the spin to long-off
"tucked towards the midwicket region, there was a huge gap there. Tambe was ambling across the turf, no damage done though from Gujarat's point of view"
top shot. Goes back deep into the crease and punches it back past the bowler. Races away past mid-on
"he's struggling with his length here. Drops it short, and Rahane needs no invitation. Rocks back and pulls it in front of square. No one at midwicket, two bounces into the ropes"
worked wide of mid-on for an easy single
"he looks to force one on the up, but plays outside the line of that delivery, beaten"
whipped across the line to mid-on. Not sure if this is a deliberate ploy by PK to bowl short of length
eased down to third man for an easy single
"walks across the stumps and thumps it past the diving cover fielder. PK isn't happy with that effort, but you have to admit it was a poor ball. Can't give width to these guys"
"pulled, but not entirely off the middle, Finch, who is on the mic, runs across to stop that"
"slower one from wide of the crease, whipped to deep square"
"lucky to get away with that short ball, hit hard but straight to cover"
"slides onto the batsman again, pushed to cover. Loud call of no from Rahane"
"flatter one outside off, he gets to the pitch and lofts it cleanly over mid-on, one bounce into the boundary. Didn't try to muscle it. Pure timing"
"bowls it from well behind the crease, lands it too short, Rahane shapes to cut but was through with the stroke even before the ball reached him"
"he's got his man. The wily old fox has dismissed his younger Mumbai teammate. This one was pushed through quicker on middle, not much turn, Rahane plays across the line and misses to be hit on the pad. Umpire Nandan didn't hesitate to raise his finger, and he was right. That would have hit middle."
takes it on the full and drives it to long-off
"on the shorter side again, punched to long-off"
"steps out, fetches it from outside off and blasts that over long-on. It was spinning away but he had the line of the delivery well covered as he muscled it. Jakati's getting a bit of tap here"
"makes some room to pull, gets an inside edge that hits DK's pads and deflects towards short fine, KP was back in, although a direct hit would have made it interesting"
"steps out and whips it wide of midwicket, even a desperate slide in the deep can't stop that. He's struggling with his line and pace here."
"pushed through quicker, lands it on middle, tucked to short midwicket"
"misses out on a full toss, hit straight to mid-on"
"short, and is punished. KP swivels, uses the pace and pulls that one into the stands at deep backward square leg . Easy pickings"
"full toss outside off, swings across the line, gets a thick inside edge onto the pad, they steal a quick run"
"slow and full outside off, he squeezes it towards square leg, it dipped on him and was through with the stroke a little too early"
drops it with soft hands into the off side and scoots across for a single
"gets underneath that off-cutter and launches it over long-off. It was almost as if Faf knew what was coming. Waited, Waited, and then stroked it cleanly with a straight bat"
pushed wide of point for a quick single. Expensive first over from the maker of <i> Chaampyan </i>
tucked wide of midwicket
"sees the batsman give him the charge and fires one into middle and leg, KP blocks it"
"makes a bit of room, opens the face of the bat and slices it to deep cover"
punched straight to cover
"woah! He's clearly faced him a million times at the nets. Steps out, gets underneath the quicker one and deposits it over the sightscreen. It was fired in flat, but how quick was Faf! Amazing"
"picks the length early, and slaps it to deep midwicket"
"fires one on middle, he steps out and works it behind square on the leg side"
"slider on middle, KP played for the turn when there was none, ball rolls off the inner half of the bat to short fine leg"
"makes room and hammers it towards Finch, who does well at deep cover"
"makes a bit of room, generates power through his swing and gets it away into the gap at sweeper cover"
"steps out but is deceived by the slider that follows him into middle and leg, ball deflects towards square leg"
"too short and he's crunched that between wide long off and deep cover. Once again, he's paid the price for erring in length. Faf is simply too strong there."
"pushed through quicker on middle and leg, worked away into the gap at midwicket"
"he looks to smash the cover off the ball, mistimes it to short cover"
sliced it to point where McCullum saved a certain boundary. The opening of the bat face was deliberate to hit it between point and short third man
"good work by Faulkner at wide long-on. It was muscled, but Faulkner and Finch's tag team effort comes through there"
"worked to Jadeja's left, he hares across and fires a throw at the bowler's end, he was in"
"round-armish delivery outside off, hit hard but straight to cover"
driven to Raina at cover
"steps out, but can't get underneath the ball, squeezed to long-on"
"quicker one on middle, bunted to long-on"
"once again gets yorked, but squeezed past the bowler for an easy single"
"looks to tap it towards midwicket but the ball spins a touch sharply, KP has to adjust late and defend"
"whipped into the acres of space at deep midwicket, the fielder was caught napping"
"fires one outside off, flirting with the wide line, Faf is surprised, not sure if it was for the leave or for the decision"
"drilled towards long-on, Faulkner's athleticism to the fore, he dishes in the slide to save two runs"
makes room and slaps it one bounce to DJ at long-off
taps it towards the man running in from point for a quick single
"steps out, takes it on the full and plays it to long-off, didn't get the kind of power he would have liked"
"walks across the stumps and punches i wide of Jakati, who slides across to his right to keep it down to a single"
"beauty, KP! Length ball outside off, and he deflects it past short third man. Delicate, but so very effective"
"mistimes the pull to square leg. Wanted to hit it over his head, got it off the toe end"
"slow legcutter this time, nudged to short fine leg"
punched towards sweeper cover
"bullet hit, but the ball had passed Raina at mid-off even before the keeper complete his 'caaaatch it' shout"
"slower one on middle and leg, misses it as the ball thuds into his pad"
worked into the vacant midwicket region
straight as a dye. Gets to the pitch and drills it back past the bowler. Jakati tried to stop it with his boot but realised it would be a futile attempt
"short, wide, and cut away to sweeper cover"
"looks for a hoick, but swung a little too early"
"full toss, hit back to the bowler, who misfields to give KP a run. Missed out"
"width on offer, slapped into the boundary at deep cover, bisects the two boundary riders in the deep. What timing. 50 up for Faf. Jakati has a look of disbelief on his face. Well, have to say it was a poor ball. He hasn't bowled well today"
"full toss on middle and leg, worked to deep midwicket"
"slower and fuller outside off, squeezed to point"
"swings and misses. Classic change of pace, this was dragged shorter as well, he looked to cut but missed"
waits and waits for that off cutter and hits it wide of point
"beauty! The slower one was read late, he looked to nudge it past short third man but was beaten by the one that didn't deviate as much as KP expected"
"he's got him with that dipping slower delivery once again. KP didn't look comfortable with that delivery, was deceived as the ball dipped under his eyes, was through with the stroke early as the bottom edge deflected onto the stumps. DJ is back and is dancing to his own tunes"
"angles a slower one into middle from round the stumps, played back to the bowler"
"another slower variation, fetches it from outside off towards long-on"
"whipped towards the man running in deep midwicket, Smith always wanted the second, a better throw and he would have been gone. Jakati fired the flat throw that was a fraction wide, Karthik didn't collect it cleanly either"
pulled to Jadeja at deep midwicket
"stops on him, hint of bounce as well, but he bunts it toward deep midwicket somewhat, once again the throw is wide and DK can't gather. Difficult take"
"punched into the gap at deep cover, super running this"
steps out and wrists it to deep midwicket
"stand and deliver stuff. Stays still, sees the width, loads himself and boom! Finds the gap at sweeper cover"
"shot of the evening, if you ask me. Makes room and lofts it inside-out over wide long-off, where McCullum gets the timing of his jump wrong as he tips it over the line. Full marks for the effort though. Leaped high, but couldn't quite get the control"
"reward for Tambe, but has it come too late? This was once again fired in, it slipped under Faf's eyeline as he looked to launch that over long-on, missed it completely and Dinesh Karthik effected a smart stumping. He would have been slightly blinded by Faf's march but held his composure and concentration to pull that off."
"steps out and across, works it to short fine"
"whipped towards deep midwicket, Bravo is alert to the possibility of the second"
"short and wide, Smith shapes to cut but misses"
"fired full and wide outside off, Smith reaches out for it and swings through, ball finds the centre of the bat but lodges safely in the hands of the man at sweeper cover."
"steps out to work it to the on side, can only get some pad on it"
pushed to cover
"worked past the bowler towards long-on, accurate stuff, using his angles well"
"punched back to the bowler, good over this"
"slower one outside off, defended to the cover fielder"
"this one's speared in full from wide of the crease, Marsh swings and misses, didn't miss the off stump by much"
"waits and waits, then pulls it to deep midwicket"
"full toss outside off, hit straight to cover, a direct hit would have made it interesting. Dhoni is lightning quick"
"hammered down the ground, Faulkner runs around 10 yards to his left to stop it at long-off"
"dipping slower one outside off, swung across the line, mistimed towards long-on"
"fired full and outside off, play and a miss"
mistimes the slog towards deep midwicket
swing and a miss. This was fired wide outside off
"he was struggling and Jadeja's ensured Marsh's stint is a short one. Fired into middle from wide of the crease, Marsh looked to swing that over midwicket but was cramped for room, missed it as the ball cannoned into the stumps"
"almost a return catch. Played too early, lobbed it, landed just short of Sir"
"gets a bit of inside edge onto the pad, rolls to the off side, DK is alert"
"slower one outside off, Dhoni looks to smack that into neighbouring Jamnagar, but can only manage a thick edge that flies past DK's outstretched hands and into the third man boundary"
"drilled to long-off, Dhoni wanted the strike and hared back for the second even before his partner had turned, fortunately the throw at the bowler's end was wide and DJ failed to collect it cleanly"
"digs it out again, gets it down towards long-on, Bhatia is quick to turn for the second this time, but Dhoni's pace is just too good. He completed it even before Bhatia was halfway through his second. Incredible"
"muscled, and how! Dragged his length short, Dhoni generated enough power as he swung across the line, sailed over the ropes at long-on"
"full on middle from wide of the crease, hit straight to long-on, Dhoni decided he was going back for the second come hell or high water, Jadeja fired a decent throw, but DK failed to collect it. Poor stuff"
"wow, what touch! Too full, Dhoni instead of looking to slog that across the line, opens the bat face to squeeeze it between point and short third man"
"appeal for lbw, this was a really good shout too. He looked to walk across but is hit on the pad even before his bat came down, looked like he lost it completely, or did he? Very, very close."
short-arm jab to midwicket
"misses another one, but this one was sliding down leg. He's being troubled by RP's late swing"
"biffed over midwicket. Sashays down the pitch, takes it on the full and boom. Surely his dismissal in the last match has had no effect"
"crunched to point, they scoot across for the single. McCullum's bat got stuck in the crease, but had his foot back inside the crease when the ball hit the stumps"
"gets an inside edge on the thigh pad, played towards square leg"
"on the pads, and Finch lays into that one. Whipped uppishly over square leg, one bounce into the ropes"
"wanted to go on side, missed it"
"angled into middle from wide of the crease, turned to midwicket"
tucked wide of square leg
"looks to whip that behind square, is late on the shot, ball thuds into the thigh pad and deflects towards short fine leg"
"ball stops on him a touch as he looks to work it to midwicket, lands short of the fielder running in from there"
"floats it full and wide, he looks to go over cover, toe-ends it to point, bat face was open when ball met bat"
"short, wide and boom! Stays inside the crease, frees his arms and slaps it over point. Steve Smith, who was on the microphone, went 'wow'"
cuts and misses. This time he was cramped for room as the ball came back in from round the stumps
"how quickly has he picked the length up? Too short, McCullum pulls him into the stands in front of square. Baz is back. This one was way too short and got what it deserved"
tucked towards mid-on
"makes room at the last second, just before RP delivers, mistimes it though towards wide mid-off"
up and over point. Very poor from an experienced bowler like Ishant. Too much width
"tucked to fine leg, lucky to get away with that. A metre on either side and it was four"
"another bazooka shot, steps out and slaps it towards long-on"
"he will put those away all day, all night. Once again it's too short, Finch arches back and helps it over point. Ishant's pace meant all he needed to do was lend direction"
"cuts and misses, this one kept a touch low, on the bounce to Dhoni"
worked towards mid-on from the off stump
"loopy delivery to start with, Finch makes room and looks to go over cover, gets a thick inside edge, rolls to long-on instead"
"fired in quicker on middle and leg, he whips it away off his hip behind square on the leg side, excellent effort by M Ashwin to pull the ball back in. Dived full length to get to the ball"
"almost had him in flight there. Finch looked to go over cover, but backed away a little too far"
"fired outside leg, Finch is almost yorked and is cramped for room as he backs away, ball his hit to midwicket"
"yorker-length on the stumps, squeezed back to the bowler"
"pushed through quicker on middle, hit hard but can't find the gap, straight to mid-off"
"skids back into middle and leg, there's a bit of fizz, McCullum looks to pull, ball hits his pad and deflects to the off side"
long hop and put away. All the time in the world for him to rock back and pull him into the deep midwicket boundary
"on middle and leg, and swept fiercely into the backward square leg fence"
"this one's a googly that's gone horribly wrong, pitched way outside leg even as the batsman backed away, Dhoni fails to stop it"
"crunched into the cover boundary. Once again, too short, he back away, frees his arms and slaps it into the gap"
gets a good stride forward and smother the spin
"gets down on one knee and sweeps him into the vacant deep square leg region. All he had to do was clear the infield, which he did."
"floats it at length outside off, whipped to deep midwicket"
"slow leg-cutter again, pulled but straight to midwicket"
"too full, and he has thumped it over long on. Easy pickings. Nice clean swing of the bat, sweet sound as it made connection with the ball"
hit straight to cover
"makes room to go over cover, mistimes one to the fielder"
"take that!  This wasn't timed as well as the previous six, but still had enough to just elude the leaping Rahane at long-on"
"hits the deck hard on length, tapped towards short midwicket for a quick single"
"too short, and helped towards deep square leg where RP Sigh pulls off a stunner. Dives like he was at a swimming pool, stuck his hand out and stopped the ball before firing a good throw"
"slower one on the pads, flicked to deep square, RP in action again"
"swings north, ball goes south. The thick edge flies past short third man, and into the boundary"
pulled to KP at deep midwicket
whipped to deep square leg to get to his second fifty in as many matches
"gives it some air, but gets the landing wrong again, lucky that the cut found the fielder at point"
"drifts into middle, turns away, he reverse sweeps it but can't pierce the point fielder"
"the young man has a wicket against the run of play. This one was once again a flatter delivery, but wasn't all tjat short, Finch went for the sweep, struck it well but picked out Ishant, the lone man at deep square leg. M Ashwin lets out a roar, he was under pressure but has come back well."
eased wide of cover for an easy single to get off the mark
"swept across the line, straight to Rahane at deep midwicket. Gave it a good rip on that occasion. McCullum was beaten in flight but went through with the stroke"
gets forward and plays it back to the bowler
"nearly slips one through bat and pad, McCullum went for a sweep, got a thin inside edge"
"sliced towards deep point, didn't get hold of it entirely"
"on the pads, tickled past short fine, good running to come back for the second"
"drifting down leg, sweeps and misses, Dhoni fails to grab that as well"
"sees him give the charge and fires a carrom ball on middle and leg, worked towards deep square"
pushed to cover
"cramped for room as he shapes to cut, defended to point"
gets across the stumps and wrists it wide of mid-on
too short and that has been crunched into the gap at deep point
"short again, spins back into middle and leg, turned to deep square"
"didn't get underneath the flight, flat hit to long-on"
"leans into the drive, eased to long-off"
"so much turn on that, even Dhoni was foxed as McCullum missed the slog sweep. The ball ripped from outside off"
swivels and pulls it towards deep square
"carrom ball, lands it too short, but get away with it as KP pulls off a stunning stop at deep midwicket. Ran at least 20 yards to his right before diving full length to stop that"
"excellent stop off his own bowling, it was punched back towards mid-on"
"full toss, skips down the track and hits it straight as an arrow, long-on and long-off nearly ran into each other. Dhoni has a worried look on his face"
"steps out and deposits that into the second tier. This was the carrom ball, but he had already decided that was to be sent over long-on. Swung through the line, got to the pitch. Wow"
"<b> misses a regulation stumping. </b> He tried to make room and squeeze it over point, was a couple of paces down the pitch when he looked to make contact, Dhoni grabbed the ball and saw it bobble out of his gloves. Kicks the ball onto the stumps in disappointment"
punched to sweeper cover
"lands the leg cutter on middle, hit hard to long-off"
"slower one on middle, chipped to long-on"
"too short, this one kept a touch low though, McCullum's pull flies off the toe end to deep midwicket"
punched to long-off
"too short, lucky to get away as the pull finds Ishant at deep square"
"is that the break they were looking for? McCullum skipped down three paces, looked to pull but was cramped for room, top-edged it towards Faf who took it easily at cover. After a passage of slow bowling, the change of pace perhaps did McCullum in. End of a fine innings"
"solid punch in that stroke, opened the face and essayed it behind point, Ganguly would have been impressed. Good work by RP in the deep"
shuffles across and nurdles it to deep square leg
"this one nips back in to hit him high on the thigh pad, they sneak in a leg bye"
"that is a scorcher from the Lions skipper. Steps out, makes room, gets underneath the ball and lofts him inside-out over cover. That really went to the boundary like a tracer bullet. I'm not joking"
"floats a slower one on middle, eased to long-on"
"looks to nudge it past short third man, nearly chopped it back onto the stumps. Bounced over it"
"sweeps, but straight to Mitch Marsh at square leg"
"waits for the ball to spin away and taps it to cover point , wanted the run but was sent back. A direct hit would have made things interesting. Raina, in his quest to dive back into the crease, has injured his finger."
"too full, worked to deep square leg, KP was late to get off the blocks there"
"skids back into middle, punched to long-off"
"carrom ball that drifts in and turns away from middle, Bravo gets a leading edge to cover as he looks to work it past midwicket, lands short of Rahane."
tucked to fine leg
"interesting, very interesting. Was standing well outside leg, somewhere around the ninth stump even before Ishant delivered. What does the bowler do? Follows him, Bravo makes more room and lofts it over cover. Sweet timing"
"what wrist work! This one was dropped short, he went back deep into the crease, opened the bat face and sliced it over point. Superb"
"what followthrough of the bat! Too full, DJ hammers that over cover, no one in the deep. He hasn't learnt. Bowling it there again, and again, and again, will only mean he keeps getting picked away, especially with no protection in the deep."
"banged in short on middle, hops back and tucks it to the on side for a quick single"
plays the short-arm jab to deep square
"this time, Dhoni doesn't miss the stumping. This one was bowled flatter, it pitched outside off and straightened after pitching, Raina stepped out and pushed inside the line of the ball, missed it as Dhoni had enough time to whip the bails off. Surely this has come a little too late?"
"sharp turn back into middle and leg, Jadeja is hit high on the pad"
"the wrong-un this time, but it pitches well outside off and spins further away"
steps out and works it with the spin to long-on
"on the bounce to Ishant at long-off, it was the googly, he picked it well though"
"nudged to short midwicket, Jadeja was sent back. Direct hit, but Jadeja was just in. Dhoni's quick deflection can't help this time"
"on the shorter side, whipped to deep square leg"
"slants back into middle from round the stumps, pushed to midwicket"
"off cutter on middle, Marsh doesn't pick up that nudge cleanly at midwicket"
"sliding down leg, he looks to swing that one over square leg, deflects off the pad to Dhoni who fails to stop it cleanly"
"makes room to force it through cover point, can't find the gap"
"slower one on middle, worked wide of midwicket. <b> Free hit time </b>"
"too full, lofted over the infield, but didn't time it well, Smith comes rushing in from long-on to stop that, misfields"
"typical DJ shot! This was too full, Bravo made room, swung through the line, but the bat face was slightly opened as he made contact, hit it into the gap between deep point and deep cover. Little would he have realised when he made contact that it would have carried all the way. Outstanding"
comes back in for a new spell and floats it well down leg. That's the end of that
