"a gentle outswinger first up, no pace off the pitch, Shaw waits for it, drops it at his toes and takes off for an easy single even though the ball goes as far as where forward short leg would have been"
"full now, just outside off, Agarwal gets a small stride in and then leaves it alone"
"shorter, hardly carries to Watling as Agarwal resists the temptation to cut. This is quite an ordinary delivery, though. You can get away with it in Tests when the batsmen are just trying to get their eye in"
"was that the scrambled-seam inswinger? It starts straight and angles down, flicking the pad on its way to the keeper"
"finally gets the length right to draw Agarwal forward. The batsman gets the stride in, plays for outswing, but the ball carries straight on and hits the inside half of the bat"
"straighter, on a length, Agarwal has to defend, which he does"
<strong>swing first up</strong>. Shaw not as watchful as Agarwal and looks for a bit of a drive just outside off. It shapes back in to hit the inside edge onto the pad
"looks to go really full. In fact it is a full toss. Shaw looks to drive, gets a thick inside edge for a couple past short leg"
<strong>the other one this time</strong>. Looks like angled away on purpose. Shaw defends and is beaten
Shaw right on the back foot to defend this length ball. More watchful now
"that is what he looks for when he wants an lbw. Swinging delivery, starting just outside off, and shaping back in to middle and leg. Shaw is equal to it, even closes the face, places this past midwicket for a couple"
"<b>mix-up</b>. Pushed past point for what looks like an easy two, but Shaw makes a late call to send Agarwal back, who stumbles while turning. No further drama, though, as he makes it back in time"
"Shaw is not watching looseners sail past. Short, slightly wide, and Shaw climbs into it. Doesn't bother with keeping it down. Past point it goes"
"on a length, straight, and he is right behind it in defence"
"full, wide, awayswinger. A teaser, and Shaw doesn't get tempted"
"wide on the crease, makes him play at a wide outswinger, but Shaw has defended this solidly"
"wide on the crease again, and with no swing this time, he gets clipped away for an easy single off the toes"
"wide length ball, Agarwal has left it alone without fuss"
"good ball. On a length, middle and leg, shapes to swing, but pitches and seams away. Shaw is squared up in defence"
"<strong>edged away</strong>. That is another good ball from Boult. Pitched up, inviting a drive, Shaw goes after it, playing for the swing, but the ball seams away a touch after pitching. The edge is placed perfectly between the slips and the gully, though"
"slightly shorter, and Shaw drops back to defend it with an open face"
"<strong>oh the lbw ball</strong>. Perfect line, perfect length. everyone gets excited as Shaw's back lift goes up. The ball doesn't swing enough, though, to miss the inside edge. Shaw gets a single with it"
"<strong>beauty</strong>. Boult finally hitting his stride. Inswinger as it leaves his hand, Agarwal has to defend this around off, but after pitching it goes the other way. Just misses the outside edge"
"this one does swing back in, and Agarwal plays it watchfully back to Boult"
"short of a length, really slow off the surface, Shaw aborts any plans he might have to punch this through cover. Defended"
"and just like that, Southee brings out the perfect delivery. Half-volley outswinger, asking for a drive, but Shaw does it without moving his front foot. He is in no position to cover any swing there might be. And there is swing here. In a rare case, a half-volley has left the batsman squared up. Past the outside edge it goes to disturb his off stump. A fairly ordinary shot in the end, playing far in front of his body and searching for the ball with his hands. He is looking at the pitch suspiciously, but the pitch has done nothing untoward here"
sighter for Pujara as this heads down the leg side
"tries the scrambled-seam inswinger first up for Pujara, but he is good enough to cover it on a slow surface. Gets off the mark with a couple"
"wide length ball, left alone"
"short of a length, straight, Pujara defends from the crease"
uppishly clipped away as it swings back in. Wide of short leg so he gets an easy couple
bouncer just to keep him honest. Agarwal ducks it. Just a reminder you can't keep plonking your front foot down
"really full, but too wide to engage Agarwal"
"full, swinging in, pushed to cover"
"short of a length, outside off, Agarwal shoulders arms"
"goes wider on the crease, pitches this short of a length, the ball angles away, squaring up Agarwal, who manages to keep it down"
"wide outsiwnger, Pujara, not yet out of box-cricket mode, lets it be"
"gets closer to off with his line, but still not full enough to make Pujara consider a drive"
"fulller, straighter, but too straight, and it angles down the leg side. Pujara watches it all the way into Watling's gloves"
"wide on the crease, but the line is wide too, and left alone again"
and now Southee tries that straight ball that Pujara is sometimes susceptible to. It hits the inside half of the bat but the surface is not fast enough to trouble him with this line
"wide on the crease, really full, and straight. Pujara defends solidly"
"on a length, around off, good busy cricket from India as Agarwal tiups and runs even though the ball has not gone too far wide of cover"
"full and wide, not much swing, left alone by Pujara"
"wide full toss, Pujara is too watchful to take full toll. He opens the face on it, but can't beat the man at point"
"on a length, middle and leg, could go either way. That is where you want to be more often than not. This one goes with the angle, and Pujara is forward to defend it"
"wide on the crease, and gets some swing back in against that angle. Headed for off and middle, and Pujara gets enough of an inside edge on it"
"wide on the crease again, but this one starts wider and doesn't swing either. Left alone"
"wide outswinger, and you won't get Pujara to play at those"
"perfect outswinger from wide of the crease, but not quick enough. Pujara right forward to almost smother it"
"another good delivery. On a length, around off, pitches and holds its line instead of swinging away. Hits the inside half of the bat"
"another beauty from Southee. Stays around off, gets swing away, but Pujara plays it late, lets it hit the bat instead of going out to meet it. It hits the outside half of the bat but he is in no danger"
"wider this time, and Pujara leaves it alone again"
"just overpitches a little as Pujara keeps resisting all of Sothee's teasing deliveries. Well more than just a little. This is a plum full toss, and Pujara takes full toll this time, driving it straight of mid-on"
"on a length, around off, angling away, and left alone"
"fuller, closer to off, Agarwal has to play at it. He pushes at it defensively, but ends up timing it sweetly enough to get three straight of mid-off"
"full, just outside off, Pujara covers the line should it swing, but this one doesn't, and it sails by without bothering Pujara"
"short of a length, middle and off, and it cuts away off the seam. Pujara has a little bit of a dab at it. <strong>Beaten</strong>"
"and now he tries the full swinging delivery. Two things wrong with it: he overpitches, and the ball doesn't swing either. Pushed away straight of mid-on. Classic Test-match batting"
"outside off, and left alone"
"gentle straight delivery, clipped away off the pads towards long leg. Boult does well to charge from fine leg, and keep them down to one"
<strong>Pujara pads up and is hit on the knee roll</strong>. Draws a bit of an appeal from New Zealand but it is too wide to interest the umpire
"another leave, and this one goes straight on through to the keeper"
"too straight, and angles down the leg side"
"straight and making him play, which Pujara does defensively to square leg"
"too full, also down the leg side, concedes an easy single to long leg"
"length ball, sixth-stump line, left alone"
"short of a length, good bounce, hits the bat high as Pujara defends"
"looks for swing, but balls it wide. Pujara is happy to watch them through to the keeper's gloves"
"<strong>peach. Real peach</strong>. Gets his pace going, angles this one, on a length, around off, and then it swings away late to beat his bat and leave him squared up. Swings too much to take the edge or hit the off stump. Pujara is just playing for the angle. So actually pretty good batting"
"wider length ball, left alone"
another leave to end a maiden first over on debut for Jamieson
"slightly short of a length, around off, defended from the crease"
"nibbly little length ball around off, Agarwal has to wtach it till the end, defends with an open face"
"<strong>the nibble again</strong>. Outswinger around off, Agarwal has to play for that movement, but the ball pitches and nips back in, beating his attempt to get around the front pad. However, it nips too much to get him the lbw"
"straight again, and defended to leg this time"
"on a length, stump to stumps, defended to leg"
"swinging, full, teasing him, but Agarwal is not playing at wide deliveries either. Really watchful start from India"
"short of a length, angled in, dropped to leg for a quick single, which seems to have surprised Agarwal, who is a little slow to hit full speed. He puts a dive in to make it"
"<strong>nice bounce</strong>. From just short of a length, he gets this to rise towards Agarwal's face. He fends at it, and manages to keep it down"
"and he tries the old trick of pitching it up after showing him the short ball. Agarwal is equal to it, pushes this wide of cover, gets a single"
"wide on the crease, wide of the stumps, left alone as it only just straightens"
"<strong>and Pujara again has a bit of a nibble</strong>. This is the second time he has followed a shortish ball that he doesn't usually do. First one was off Boult. This shortish delivery holds its line after pitching, Pujara follows it wit his hands but doesn't commit too much to it. Beaten"

"just in front of length, outside off, but nipping in. Agarwal shoulders his arms, but the ball was fairly close to off stump"

"back of a length, outside off, and climbing all the time. Watling collects it from above his head"
"full on middle, and going down leg as Pujara shuffles across the flick. Comfortably taken by the keeper"
"<B>that's his first wicket!</b> And what a peach of a delivery. Just the fullish length outside off, but it straightens after pitching. Pujara looks to defend towards mid-on, expecting the ball to angle in, but it doesn't. The ball takes the outside edge. Keeper takes two steps to his right to pocket that catch. Big roar from the bowler"

"<B>what a dream debut so far! </b> The debutant gets the edge, and cap no 100 at first slip makes no mistake. Fullish, outside off, inviting Kohli for the drive. He looks to hit straight past the bowler, but the ball takes the outside edge instead. Taylor tumbles backwards to take the catch, but ensures it stays safely within his hands"

"<b>dropped</b>. Nearly one of those Boult specials. On a length, draws a defensive push, but the hard hands give Boult an offering low to his left in the follow-through. No other fast bowler would have got a hand to it, but Boult does. He knows he has taken such catches before which is why it is being seen as a drop"
hard hands on the defensive push again. Goes to mid-off
"welcome back, Mr Boult. Agarwal has sort of thrown it away after his hard work for 90 minutes in the first session. Since Kohli's wicket, though, he has been loose and has ridden his luck. Well the fountain has run out. Boult bowls a short ball, which Agarwal looks to swivel-pull, but the slow nature of the wicket and the spongy bounce means he is early into the shot. Gets a healthy top edge for a catch for Jamieson at long leg. This is a wicket Boult has conjured out of nothing"

"lovely shot. Jamieson looks to check his foot movement after the short ball once again, but he ends up pitching it too far up. Vihari presents it the full face for a four straight of mid-on"
"<strong>stuck feet</strong> and beaten again. If anything that back foot moves further away from the line of the ball. This ball is not as full as the last so Vihari has to reach out for the drive. He fails to do so, but he is lucky it has swung too much to hit the edge"
solid in defence this time
"swing in this time. This is possibly the first time we have seen that from Jamieson. Actually it is seam movement, and not swing. Does too much and hits his thigh pad. For a moment that short leg fielder would have been interested in an inside edge"

good length on middle and leg. Rahane walks across towards off stump before defending off his hips
"good length, on middle. Rides the bounce and fends it towards cover"

Patel starts with a flat delivery down the leg side
"flighted on middle and leg, defended to leg"
"tossed up on middle and leg, angles towards off, defended back to Patel"
and Pant won't allow that change of ends without some damage. Skips down the wicket and lofts this over wide mid-on for a huge six. That's modern batting for you
"flat, short of a length, whipped away to the leg side for one"
"shortish again, defended off the back foot"
starts with one down the leg side
"on a length, straight, defended to leg"
"this one is angled across his body, and has been left alone"
"full, slight shape back in, Pant gets a stride in and defends"
"on a length, shaping up to swing, defended off the front foot"
"this one does swing back in a little, Pant lets it do and then clips it into the leg side"
"short of a length, sticks in the surface a little, dropped into the covers for a quick single"
"and there is some movement out of nowhere. Slightly short of a length, shapes away, kicks up a little, Pant doesn't follow it"
"fuller, asking Pant if he fancies a drive, but he leaves it alone"
"now that Boult has seen swing, he tries to go straight and then swing it from there. But ends up bowling too straight, and hits Pant's pad"
"slight swing again, Pant is watchful as he lets it go outside off"
"extra bounce this time, and slight seam back in. Hits him high on the thigh pad after beating the inside edge"
"wide length ball, Rahane gets a stride in and then shoulders arms"
"oh what doe we have here? A run-out in Test cricket. Pant has sacrificed himself for Rahane, who has pulled rank so to speak to over-rule Pant, whose call it is. Short of a length, outside off, played with an open face towards point, and this should be the non-striker's call. Rahane has charged off, but Pant doesn't want the one. Despite his no, Rahane keeps going, and then Pant has to sacrifice himself. However, it is not as straightforward a run-out. The keeper has not yet made it to the stumps so Patel at point has to make a decision whether to lob it to BJ Watling or go for the stumps. Patel gets in a soft throw in at the stumps. It is half and half, a slightly confused throw, but good enough to hit the only visibly stump direct. More than hit, he has just kissed the stump, just about flicking the bail off"
"oh it was good enough for Shaw, it is good enough for Ashwin. Bowling into the wind, Southee bowls the perfect outswinger, starting at middle and headed for the off stump. You need your feet to go towards the ball to cover this movement. Much like Shaw, Ashwin is rooted to the crease, and allows this to swing past the outside edge. Much like Shaw, he looks stunned"
"Sharma shuffles across to cover any swing outside off, but the ball heads down leg"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"full outswinger, Sharma right behind it and defends it towards mid-off"
"on a length, around off, angling across, defended to cover"
"Boult is short here, and has been tucked away off the hip for a single"
"he goes for the bouncer, slightly higher than the ribs, Sharma fends at it uppishly but there is no man at leg gully. He gets off strike"
gets a stride in to defend a full ball outside off
"and Rahane looks for a boundary now that singles are being cut. It is not the most convincing shot as he throws his bat at this drive, but he gets enough to clear the man at point"
"as expected, Boult bowls a bouncer to try to keep Rahane down at this end. Rahane, though, tries the hook and gets a <strong>top edge that falls just short</strong> of Jamieson at fine leg"
"full, just outside off, defended towards mid-off"
"good bouncer, Rahane is beaten on the hook by the spongy bounce. We can see Rahane has started to get more adventurous with those two wickets"
"wide on the crease, bowls the inswinger from there, Rahane plays it late and helps it into the leg side for one"
"wide on the crease again, Sharma right across, the ball is headed straight for the stumps, and just as everybody is hoping for an lbw shout, his bat comes down in time"
"<strong>nearly there</strong>. Southee gets closer to the stumps, and looks for the outswinger. Sharma plays a forceful shot, which is not what he usually does. He ends up lobbing it into the leg side. It hangs for there for what seems like ages, but manages to clear midwicket"
sharp bouncer to keep Rahane at the non-striker's end for the start of the next over
"a lot of shuffling around this morning from Sharma. Boult stays straight with an inswinger, but ends up sliding it down the leg side"
"now the full straight ball looking for the lbw, but Sharma gets his bat down in time to push this for a couple through the vacant mid-on. Rahane taking all the runs on offer for the time being"
this one goes straight on after pitching. Sharma shuffles across and defends
gets the shortish ball in to break the rhythm. Sharma behind it in defence
"bouncer, but down the leg side, and it is easy to avoid for Sharma"
and he goes for the real full one last ball of the over. Sharma is good enough to keep it out
"full and outside off, left alone"
"bouncer, and he ducks under it"
"what an end to a strange morning for Rahane. He ran pant out not long ago, and is now caught at the wicket while leaving the ball. A strange strange way to get out. Southee goes wide on the crease to bowl an outswinger. Rahane knows the drill, covers the line and then looks to leave it. Except that he is not quick enough to take the bat out of the way. The ball tickles the inside edge of the bat, and Watling mops up the dying offering"
"full and straight, worked into the leg side for one"
"Southee is on absolute fire but hang on, <strong>Sharma has reviewed this decision for catch at the wicket</strong>. And Sharma is right. This is a lovely outswinger on a length outside off, Sharma is looking to drive, and there is a noise as the ball passes the bat. Aleem Dar thinks about it, and then raises his finger. Sharma wastes no time in reviewing, and the replays show it has missed the bat and just flicked the back pad on the way as he is squared up"
"wide on the crease, full, swinging away from middle, Sharma good enough to defend it back to him"
"short of a length, rising towards his ribs, fends it down"
"wide on the crease goes Boult, bowls full and straight, Shami drives, but straight to mid-off"
"bouncer, down the leg side, beats Shami's hook"
"driven on the up, crisply too, but straight to mid-off again"
"goes for the real full one, maybe a yorker even, and ends up bowling a full toss. Worked into the leg side"
"on a length, angling across him, Sharma defends after shuffling across"
"wide on the crease again, Shami has a big mow at this full ball, hits it straight to mid-on"
"again wide on the crease, full wide outsiwnger, Shami is drawn to it, and he gets a thick enough edge to clear gully"
"dropped by Williamson. Can you believe it? Southee is wide on the crease again, Shami has a mow again, gets a huge top edge and the ball goes miles up in the air and swirls when coming down. Williamson from mid-off has a lot of time to get under it, gets both hands to it, but it bursts through his fingers"
"<b>another shout for catch</B> as Sharma hits in the air into the leg side, but this doesn't carry to mid-on"
"just to rub salt into the wounds, Shami flick-drives this full ball straight between the bowler and mid-on for a four all long the ground"
<strong>uppish again</strong>. Pushes at a wide length ball with had hands but it doesn't carry to the man at cover
"short of a length, outside off, defended with a slightly open face"
"short of a length again, seams away a touch, beats the edge as Sharma follows it"
"slightly shorter, gets it higher than the previous two, but not high enough to discomfort the batsman"
"dug in again, Sharma is pushed deep into the crease and defends"
"yes it is the full one, Sharma is caught on the crease, and is beaten by the slight away movement"
"wide length ball, and left alone"
"wide on the crease, wide outside off, and for a change Shami shows restraint and leaves this alone"
"bouncer from closer to the wicket. This is headed for the badge, Shami has his eye off and swings at it. <strong>Hits the bat and goes straight down</strong>"
"wide on the crease again, on a length, driven on the up to short cover"
"tries the short ball but without much swing. Rib high only, and Shami pulls this away dismissively to square leg for four"
"<strong>Shami is teasing New Zealand here</strong>. Big old swing at a wide outswinger. Ends up slicing it into the cover. Blundell runs back and gets a dive in, but can't even get a touch on the ball"
"<strong>and Shami survives again</strong>. What a charmed innings again. Length ball, angling in, skied towards mid-on. Boult is running in from the two-thirds mid-on he is at but can't get there. A regulation mid-on gobbles this one up"
"short of a length, rising towards the chest, Shami manages to keep this down"
"on a length outside off, nicely dropped wide of cover for one"
"and Jamieson has four. He is the only one who can get five in this innings now. Dug in short, outside off, Sharma has another fend at it. Just a bit of movement away, good enough to take the outside edge"
"wide length ball, left alone"
"fuller, closer to off, beats him on the outside edge"
"full outside off again. Bumrah looks to defend, but the ball whizzes past his outside edge"
"<B>that's all over</b> for India as Shami goes for a wild heave. Length ball, outside off, and he slashes this attempted cut in the air. Blundell gets under it near point and that's India 165 all out"

No reviews left for India"

De Grandhomme tries to flick, but it gets a touch off his glove and Pant takes a catch down the leg side. <B>Loud appeal</b> and umpire Kettleborough was late in raising his finger, but eventually does, perhaps because the batsman was walking off already. An excellent innings from de Grandhomme"

"slight swing, but too straight and too short, tucked away off the hip"
"<strong>clever bowling</strong>. Seam pointing towards slip, and it goes on with the angle even as Shaw is expecting it to swing back in. Beats the edge and falls short of Watling who completes an awkward take"

"overpitched, but cramps him with the straight line. Hit straight to mid-on"

"<strong>leading edge</strong>. Pujara sees this swinging in, looks to turn the face, but the ball stops at him and pops into the off side. Falls straight of short cover"
"<strong>this time short midwicket is in action</strong>. This one has seamed in from just outside off, takes the thick inside edge but falls short of that man"

"full, outside off, left alone"
"length ball, angling in, but not enough to make him play"
"fuller, checking Pujara's patience, which he has in loads. Left alone"

"driven again, to the middle of the three short covers, but along the ground"
"<strong>Pujara has a nibble at this</strong>. Length ball, swinging away. If this is bowled at 140ks, Pujara leaves it alone, but the ball stays in his eyeline for so long his hands follow it. Lucky not to edge it"

"bouncer to Pujara, who ducks under it"
"<strong>big shout for a catch at the wicket, not given, and reviewed by New Zealand</strong>. This is a ripsnorter of a bouncer, seaming back in and following him as he tries to get his gloves out of the way. The ball hits the arm guard for sure, but the question is, did it kiss the glove on the way too? HotSpot shows no mark on the glove, but it is not that conclusive. After many more replays, using Zoomer on it, there is no conclusive evidence that it hits the glove. It can't be ruled out either because there is a slight movement of the glove. However, it is fair enough to stay with the on-field decision. Great processes, great reasoning, and you live with that uncertainty and move on. Well done, all"

"back of a length, on middle, and through to the keeper"

"Boult is looking for that lbw ball as Rahane's front foot keeps going across. He plays around the front leg, but does so late and with soft hands"
"oh the biggie. Boult does it. This is a really good ball. Angled in, on a length, just outside off, you have got to play at it. The ball, though, seams away a touch. Only enough to take the edge and not actually miss it"
"on a length, just outside off, defended off the front foot"
"full, looking for swing, Pant reaches the ball with a forward movement and defends"
"<strong>huge shout for lbw</strong>, not given, but New Zealand don't have reviews left. Pant is looking for that swing, but this one nips back in off the seam and hits him in the front. My initial reaction is, it has done too much and is probably missing leg or clipping it. Don't think a review would have helped. Technology backs me up: clipping top of leg"
right behind this one to end a successful over for New Zealand
swing. Just outside off. Full. But Vihari not going after it
"<strong>this one draws him in</strong>. The hallmark of swing bowling: it lands shorter than you expect it to. Vihari thinks he has got the half-volley, but he is not there as it dips and then swings away. Lucky not to edge it"
"sensational bowling. New Zealand have burst through. Outswinger, outswinger, and then the scrambled-seam inswinger. This lands on a length, just outside off, and Vihari has got to be mindful of the outswinger. The ball, though, pitches and nips back in to go past his inside edge and knock him over"
"no he tries the inswinger, and Ashwin is equal to it, defending it just outside off"
"tries the full outswinger now, but he is a touch too straight, and Ashwin gets enough bat on it to take four runs to fine leg"
"wide on the crease, wide outside off, left alone"

"on a length, this one nips back in a touch, but Pant has managed to drive this on the up to mid-on"
"short ball, chest high, keeps the pull down, gets a single"
"really wide ball, and Pant still has a go at it. Manages to send it only as far as short cover"
"really full, swinging back in, hits the inside half of the bat on the drive"
"on a length, extra bouncer, Pant has to check his drive, sends this towards mid-on"
short ball that doesn't quite get up. And there is one thing with Pant: he won't miss out on these opportunities. Pulled in front of square
"on a length, outside off, defended off the front foot"
Pant gets the width and he goes after it. It doesn't matter this is a top edge over the slips cordon. These are safe runs with no third man in place
"short of a length, around off, defended to point"
"short of a length, at the hip, tucked away to leg gully. Along the ground"
"and tries the fuller lbw ball as Ashwin shuffles across. His bat comes down in time, though"
"again, really full, slight swing back in. Driven to mid-off this time"
"length ball, angling in, Ashwin moves across along the crease and defends"
"full, really full, swinging in, punch-driven to mid-off"
"full, outside off, Pant plays for the angle, but the ball swings back in and hits the inside edge of the bat"
"on a length, slight swing back in, defended back to him"
"and Ashwin has been done in by a full and straight delivery. Could he have reviewed this? I reckon he could have. He doesn't. This is full and straight, Ashwin is playing for the outswing, but it nips back in and hits him in front. I think there is a chance it has done too much, but Aleem Dar and Ashwin don't. Tracker shows clipping leg"
"<strong>this is definitely missing leg</strong>. Tries the yorker first up, and it swings in after itching leg. Ishant is off his feet as he tries to keep it out"
"short of a length, straight, defended to mid-on"
"full outswinger, Sharma gets behind it and opens the face on it. The ball rolls along to second slip"
"short of a length, into the body, keeps it out with one hand off the bat"
"short of a length, wide, crunched away, but they now have a deep point in place. So Pant turns down the single"
another single turned down as this is tucked away off the hip
"full, middle and off, defended back to him"
"<strong>Pant gets beaten</strong>. Lovely full awayswinger just outside off. He defends on the move, and nearly edges it"
and he lets him get away with an easy single to fine leg. Pant keeps strike. Thoughts on asking that man to not field the ball and let it go for four so Southee can have a go at Sharma?
"on a length, outside off, defended with soft hands"
driven on the up but straight to mid-off
"full, on the pads, placed wide enough of the sweeper on the leg side to be able to come back for two"
"bouncer from wide on the crease, easy to duck under as it is too short"
mows this as if he is acing a spinner. The field has come up so he takes the boundary by sweeping Southee through midwicket
wide length ball to try to keep Pant at this end. Pant doesn't try any adventurous shot
"full, swinging in, hits the pad, but it is missing leg"
"lovely shot from Sharma. On a knee, leaning into the wide full ball for a cover-drive. Gets two. Should have taken three"
"short of a length, Sharma shuffles across to defend this to leg. Keeps it down and in front of short leg"
"even better timing than the shot earlier. Full outside off, and he has driven it with a slightly open face of the bat to send it through cover-point for four. Does Pant stop farming the strike now?"
"short of a length, outside off, Sharma shuffles across to get behind it and defend"
"<strong>is that dropped?</strong>. Goes straight to short leg off the thigh pad, but the question is, is there an inside edge before the thigh pad? The replays show there is. And Tom Latham spills it. And he is not very close to the batsman either. That could have been Boult's five-for"
"starts with a bouncer, and Pant plays the ramp. This is slow off the surface so he doesn't send it all the way but clears the slips comfortably"
"short, middle and leg, pulled away, will get only a single to fine leg. Sharma is not looking forward to those sprinted couples"
oh he tries that Boult-style mow after moving around in the crease. Is beaten by the shortish ball
"that is the ball they are looking for. Short of a length, into the ribs/chest, and Sharma looks to fend. Except that he misses it down the leg side this time"
"looks for the pull this time, but is done in by the spongy bounce. Nowhere near touching it"
"short of a length, down the leg side, and he gets outside its line and shoulders arms"
"down the leg side, through to Watling"
"full, on the pads, clipped away to fine leg"
"<strong>another drop</strong>. What are New Zealand doing? Chipped nicely to short cover. Only slightly to his right, and he spills it. Has the ball come to him slower than Southee expects? He is filthy with himself. At least, in theory, both Southee and Boult can get five-fors still"
defended to cover
"full outswinger, which nips in a little, and goes off the inside edge for one"

"full, on off, and shaping away. Bumrah goes for a straight drive, misses, and he's lucky the ball moved so much that it missed the off stump as well"
"<B>one handed catch at second slip!</b> And Southee has five. Yorker outside off, Bumrah looks to dig it away, but it takes the edge and Mitchell dives to his right, sticks one hand out, and it stays in his palms! <B>New Zealand need nine to win</b>"
