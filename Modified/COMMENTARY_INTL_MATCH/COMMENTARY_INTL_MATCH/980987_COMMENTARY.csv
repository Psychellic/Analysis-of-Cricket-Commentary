"starts with some swing from outside leg, Gayle leans forward just a bit and blocks"
"shuffles down to negate the swing, it still moves around and Gayle guides it to point"
"swings it away from Gayle from outside off, Gayle lifts the bat and leaves"
"swings it nicely from around leg towards middle and off, no room at all, and Gayle defends towards midwicket with a thick inside edge"

"swings it away from Kohli too, he reaches out without footwork and helps the ball to point"
"military medium on middle and leg, Gayle tucks it to the leg side"

bouncer to Gayle! He ducks a bit under it as soon as he spots the short ball

"hardly moves his feet to chase this wider delivery outside off, sends it to cover for one"
"what a beauty! Just around good length on middle and leg and that one seamed away from Gayle, very close to the outside edge to beat him"
towards the leg side now and Gayle pushes it to midwicket easily for one
"charges down the ground, unfurls a big swing outside off, and the ball swings away to beat him! PK goes up to Kohli to exchange a few words. Both players smile...not what I expected"
nicely driven in the gap on the off side but there's a sweeper cover so he gets only one
"just a bit of room on the off side, Kohli punches it straight to point and Jaddu has an unnecessary shy at the non-striker's end, Gayle was inside easily, and a direct hit goes away for four!"
late cuts the length ball from outside off to third man
"some late swing outside off, a watchful Gayle waits and delicately guides that fine on the off side to beat short third man for four!"
"slower one way outside off, just escapes from being called a wide"
"Gayle's gone in single digits again! He chopped the ball with hard hands on the off side, got a thick inside edge and the ball just clipped top of leg stump after a bounce. Enough to dislodge the bail"
fullish outside off and he middles that to mid-off with a straight bat
"short and flat outside off, Kohli goes back and turns it to leg"
"even shorter and this time way outside off, Kohli finds cover this time"
better delivery - on length outside off and Kohli cuts it straight to short third man
"this time he finds the gap! Another poor delivery in the over, short and too much width on the off side, Kohli only put his back foot deep in the crease and slashed that through the covers for four!"
"stays deep and swat-pulls the shortish ball to leg, Bravo runs to his right from mid-on and gets a direct hit at the bowler's end but Kohli was well inside"
"wide and turning away further, AB leaves as it's called a wide"
"have you ever seen a back-foot six? ABD shows you! Went back in the crease to make the short ball even shorter and slammed that over the covers, that was pretty incredible!"
"slightly flat on the off side, Kohli punches it to cover point"
closer to the batsman and he flicks it to deep midwicket for one
"going down the leg side, AB tries to work it to leg but gets an outside edge to off for one"
"nicely flighted on middle stump, AB makes room and drives that beautifully - inside out and with the turn, pretty late to find the gap wide of point. What placement!"
"shuffles to leg and then comes back to confuse Tambe, then sweeps the short ball with the angle to the fine-leg boundary for six!"
doesn't move much this time and drives the fuller ball back to Tambe
"flighted full toss, Kohli flicks to deep square leg"
"this man's in some form! Sees a short ball well outside off, rocks on the back foot and pulls it to the wide long-on boundary for four more"

outside off and Kohli cuts it to point off the back foot
"stays in the crease again, and pulls it to leg for one"
"full delivery outside off, there's some room and AB opens the face of the bat late to drive it to point. A fumble gives them a single"
starts with a slow short ball as AB gives him the charge. He pulls and misses as the ball goes under the bat
"almost a yorker, AB flicks to deep midwicket and gets two"
"<strong>slammed</strong> down the ground, just over mid-off and it's a one-bounce four! He danced down the pitch, took the ball on the full and hammered it down, Baz gave it everything with a jump at mid-off but the ball just escaped him"
just outside off and AB opens the face late to help it to third man
offers a completely straight bat to push the length ball down to long-on
"low full toss, struck down to long-on for one"
"first ball after the break and there's a stumping appeal for ABD's wicket! AB came out of the crease to drive the ball but the turn beat him, DK did well to take the bails off but AB's toe was back just in time"
"flatter and straighter, pushed back to Jadeja"
drives it inside out with the turn for one
"that's very risky running! On the leg stump, Kohli tucked the ball to leg and called for two early. Jadeja ran from his follow through to midwicket, put in a dive and an accurate throw at the bowler's end. Direct hit and AB was gone"
""
"loud appeal for lbw to end the over as AB slog-sweeps and misses. The umpire waits, fielders appeal, but he doesn't move"
"angling in and Kohli tucked the ball behind square on the leg side, these two are running very fast and Bravo gets another direct hit at bowler's end but AB has made it"
super shot in the gap! Just back of length on the off side and he absolutely punched that through the gap on the off side for four!
"fuller, he comes down and pushes it to mid-off for one"
"AB steps out too, and swats the short of length ball to long-on"
"comes out of the crease for the short ball, swats it top-bottom, down to long on"
giving the charge every ball and he drives this one in the air and over the covers for the second four of the over
"some room on off, cut away to sweeper cover off the back foot"
"flatter towards off, AB makes room early and cuts it to off"
"some turn from middle to off, was flat too and Kohli went back to defend it at the last moment"
"pivots on the back foot and clips the ball to deep square leg, bit wide of the fielder and they make the second look easily"
"makes a lot of room for the ball angling in, punches to sweeper cover and says a big 'no' for the second"
AB comes down and takes the last ball on the pad well outside off
"that's <strong>launched over long-on</strong>! Kohli dances down the ground, it's not a full ball but he swings big and sends that high and long over long-on into the second tier!"
just outside off and Kohli helps that to point for a single
"now it's AB and that's six more! This was a poor delivery compared to the first - short and coming in, AB stayed back and muscled a lot of power into that pull for a massive six!"
"it looked like he just checked his shot as the ball didn't bounce that much, but he still managed it in the gap with a pull and got four more!"
can you stop him? Can anyone? He's raced to the <b>half-century</b> off 25 balls as the ball raced to the boundary after he sliced that from well outside off and acknowledged the crowd by raising his bat
coming in and he clips it to deep midwicket for one
"keeps it pretty straight with some turn, AB pushes it down to long-off"
"on length on middle, Kohli leans forward to turn it to leg for one"
"angling in towards leg, AB drives into the covers"
"doesn't need to make room as he gets some and drives that up in the air and over the covers, right from the middle. Another inside-out shot for four"
"on the other side now - <strong>six more</strong>! Goes down on a knee to slog-sweep that against the turn, that goes sailing over the midwicket boundary"
"pretty wide outside off now, AB finds cover. Can't believe it but he has found a fielder"

"full on off, bunted down to the left of long-on and they get two easily"
"cuts the ball to point, no run initially but Akshdeep throws the ball to bowler's end and AB drags his bat in, before taking off for an overthrow"
full delivery and it's driven down to long-off as Kohli brings up his <strong>fifty</strong>. I've lost count of his tally this season
"flighted on leg, AB clears his front foot and swings that down to long-on. Bit of fumble but they settle for one"
whips the ball inside-out with his wrists to long-off for one
"flighted on off, that's enough time for AB to plomp his front foot forward and slog-sweep that to wide long-on for six!"
"now that's a late and inside-out drive over point for four! Don't question me, he's hitting unbelievable shots! AB waited for the ball to almost reach DK's gloves and then opened his body towards point to scoop-drive that over the fielder and in the gap"
length delivery and driven down to long-off for one more
"tries the yorker, AB makes room and drives to cover. Baz picks it early and has a shy at bowler's end"
yorker becomes a full toss on leg and AB goes down on a knee to middle that with a sweep over the fine-leg boundary. That's gone so high that both batsmen look up in awe!
"looked like he had top-edged that, maybe he did, but he got enough and it's a small ground - six over midwicket! Short ball from the leg side, he packed some power into that pull and got what he wanted"
"drilled straight down the ground for four now! Almost a yorker, AB just clears his front foot and sent that all along the ground to beat long-on"
"low full toss outside off and Ab has launched that to the leg side again! He's on 99. Went back and across to off, got a full toss and swung hard to dispatch it to the midwicket boundary again"
"completes the quick single after bunting the ball to cover, not from the middle, and takes his helmet off, raises his bat and celebrates the century! And he gets immediate attention from several RCB extras - one puts an ice pack on his head, one gives him something to drink, one with a towel. Phew!"
swings outside off and misses
"quicker ball outside off, swings hard again and misses again"
"goes back and across to slog to leg now, misses the third ball in a row and the ball just misses the off stump. It goes out of DK's gloves and they get a bye"
pushes it down to long-off to give the strike back to AB
"just some room he gets and that's all he needs, stays back and lofts that over the covers for a clean six!"
"where do you bowl to him? This time towards the stumps and he goes back early to pull it to the wide long-on boundary! What a player, what placement, what power. 150 partnership comes up"
"too full, Kohli unfurls a big cover drive and dispatches that over the covers, beats sweeper cover for four!"
"that's a classical cover drive and that too for six! More technically correct than the first ball, more off the straight bat, and beautifully driven"
"in the block hole, he digs it out wide of long-off and gets two"
"dipping full toss outside off, Kohli waits and turns it to leg"
"that was going for a wide down leg but it was a full toss and AB pulls that away with the angle, wide of short fine leg for four! Called a no ball for height"
"does it matter that it's a free hit? Not a short ball, not a full ball, but it's wide outside off and AB slams that over the covers for six more!"
"cam someone get me a dictionary to describe these shots? This ball was straighter, AB didn't move much and lofted that with apparent ease, long and high over long-on's head for six!"
"pretty flat outside off, Kohli makes room and whacks that over the covers, just off the back foot!"
"he makes room before the ball is released, it's outside off and Kohli has to reach out to the off side to slam that again through the aerial route, over the covers for four!"
flicked for six! 200 partnership comes up! That was some incredible bat speed as Kohli picked that away to the leg side from the leg stump after opening his stance a bit
"<strong>boom</strong>, straight down the ground now! Pitched up outside off, Kohli stood tall and lofted that straight down, no chance for long-on or long-off!"
"pitched up again, on the off side, no way the ball can escape Kohli from there! Kohli backed away a little, and freed his arms with a big swing to middle that over the covers again"
the crowd goes 'ohhh' as kohli tucks the ball along the ground towards deep square leg and comes back quickly for the second
the full toss escapes as it's slapped to deep midwicket from outside off for one
"gets a yorker as he comes down, still manages to get the ball down to long-on and he comes back quickly for the second!"
"<strong>crackalicious</strong>! Third century of this IPL, Virat Kohli it is as he takes the helmet off, raises his arms and punches the air! It was straight and full and he tonked that straight down the ground"
"short and slow on leg, that was a cutter and won't be discriminated against, you get six too! Kohli waited for the ball and than pulled it away over square leg. The crowd will need some energising drinks in the innings break to keep cheering"
"some respite for Lions, Kohli is caught at backward square leg, and that was a stunning catch from Bravo! He went a long way across to sweep the ball to leg, but a flying DJ Bravo leapt his left to grab that with both hands"
"a wicket to end the innings too, Lions will take it as a dot ball. Swinging away a bit outside off, Watson drove and got an inside edge to the keeper"
"back of a length on middle stump, Smith attempts a flick through midwicket but fails to connect"
"there's a long-on already! Pretty good move, considering Lions won't be holding back, and Smith's strength is in heaving the ball over the leg side. Short ball from Binny, pulled to Jordan"
"goes fullish and just outside off, McCullum pushes into the covers and gets off strike"
belted through the covers! And Darren Sammy gets to 'brag' about it from the comm box. It was a short delivery and it had room. Smith stood tall and drilled it past mid-off's left
"keeps it back of a length on middle, Smith pats it through the midwicket region. Kohli comes to Binny to have a little chat. And some drinks are being run out to de Villiers on the boundary"
"loopy old slower ball at 116 kph, it dipped on the batsman so though it was a full toss, McCullum's cover drive fails him. Hit very low on the bat"
"back of a length and outside off, patted to mid-off"
stayed back to a good length ball and the angle across beat the right-hander completely. Great take from Rahul standing up behind the stumps
"good bowling. He realised McCullum must be looking for big hits, and if he can line it on middle and leg, he will only be able to hit to midwicket. And then he bowls the slower ball to ruin the timing of the pull. Beaten again."
"shortish and slow, McCullum pulls and mis-hits to mid-on"
kept low! Aravind has struck in his first over again! Smith was camping on his back foot against a good length ball. Plays the pull and in doing so was playing across the line. The ball sneaks under his inside edge and topples off. Arr-cee-bee are on their way.
"now he gets the ball to straighten past the left-hander's outside edge! Its back of a length on off stump, Jaddu comes forward tentatively and his defensive shot doesn't amount to anything"
"good length ball, driven to cover and then walks down to pat the surface."
"nice, tight lines from the bowlers. This is on off stump, allowing McCullum no room to work with. Pushed to mid-off for only a single"
"that's excellent bowling. Flashes a grin after he bowls a bouncer at an advancing Jadeja. Sharp bounce for the medium-pacer, and right over the left shoulder too so the batsman had to pull out of the shot"
"seemed like the offcutter on back of a length on middle, defended for a quick single"
"inside edge, so Binny pulls out of the lbw appeal. McCullum shows the pressure he is under. Takes to a good length  ball that darts into him and tries to heave it over midwicket."
"that's how you do it. Wait just a bit, at least for the first boundary, and then you can get on a roll. This is overpitched and has room to free the arms. McCullum slams it past mid-off"
"gets behind a shortish delivery on middle and off, single to mid-on"
"gets under the fuller ball, uses the angle across him to his favour, and lashes a four over cover. Good job keeping that front leg out of the way and then his power takes over"
"shortish and outside off, steered to backward point. Nice comeback from the bowler, adjusted his line to ensure it was on off stump"
"shortish on middle, McCullum goes for a short-armed pull, doesn't connect at all and settles for a leg bye to short fine leg"
"oops, Jaddu was right back in his crease and is in perfect position for this slower short ball. Good composure from the batsman to wait for the ball to reach him and then make use of all the room on offer to pull over midwicket"
"shortish on middle and leg, tucked for a single through midwicket"
"threads the off side with a back foot cut. Lovely batting again, with Jadeja picking up the length and the pace so quickly. Moved back and laced it through cover"
"tossed up on middle and leg, Jadeja plants his front leg and works it to square leg"
"slog sweep, with the turn! Chahal has tossed it up, but it pitches right where Jaddu likes it. About a foot away from his front foot which affords him the room to swing the arms"
"slower through the air, still, but he shortens his length and keeps it on middle and leg. Jaddu closes the face too early and nearly gets caught by the bowler"
tucked away through midwicket
"caught at long-off! That's the wicket Bangalore would have wanted desperately. Chahal puts his finger on the lips and asks everyone to shush. It was a tossed up delivery on off stump, McCullum looked for a six down the ground and doesn't get enough power behind it"
"loud appeal from Watson as that hit him on the back foot right in front of leg stump, but it pitched well outside leg"
slower bouncer as Jadeja lifts his bat to swing but lets it go
"fullish on the pads, Jaddu pushes it down to mid-on and says no"
"comes down for a big shot but Watson pitches it wide outside off, out of Jadeja's reach for a dot ball. Not yet as Rahul hits the stumps with an underarm throw to concede an overthrow"
shuffles down and flicks the ball nicely to deep square leg
just outside off and Jadeja helps the ball to point
"full and wide, driven through to sweeper cover for one"
starts on the pads and Jads clips it to the leg side for one
"some room for the length delivery outside off, DK drives with a straight bat to mid-off"
steers this one late off the back foot towards point for a quick single
"Gayle tries a direct hit at the batsman's end, misses and DK survives! Jadeja had helped the ball to point and took off, DK was gone had Gayle got that one"
"can you keep him out of action? <strong>AB</strong> has taken a pretty good catch running backwards! DK came down to loft that over the covers, don't think he middled that, and it quite high. AB ran back from extra cover and made it look easy, taking it comfortably too"
<b>two in two</b> for Jordan with a return catch! Lions are crumbling...Jadeja chipped the length ball straight back to the bowler and Jordan had to just raise his arms towards his right shoulder to grab that
drives that with the turn from outside off to cover
more towards middle and leg and that's clipped with a forward lean to leg
well outside off and it's steered off the back foot in the deep on the off side
"pitched up, flicked by Finch to deep midwicket for a single"
"five down, Chahal traps DJ lbw! Bravo's feet were stuck in the crease as he played for the legspin, but the ball pitched around off and came in just a bit, from the back of the hand, and trapped him right in front. Easy decision, Lions going down here"
"goes on the back foot and defends that with a straight bat, back to Chahal"
"angles it into Finch, he clips it off the pads and behind square for one"
"back of length on the off side, Nath doesn't move his feet and defends close to the off stump"

this one goes down the leg side for a wide
"angling into the pads again, Finch doesn't connect and tries a leg bye but is denied by Nath"
"nice and quick on the off side, Finch cuts and misses"
"keeps a tad low as it comes in towards the off stump, Finch pushes it towards extra cover for one"
Kohli dives to his left at cover and stops Finch's drive
"pitches on off and turning away a fair bit, Finch tries to slog-sweep but misses that completely"
"this one comes in and hits his pad outside leg, beaten completely and KL Rahul slips while trying to change his direction"
fuller delivery and it's driven down to long-on for one
"doesn't middle it at all as h goes back to pull the shortish ball, goes close to Finch and Chahal dives to his right to stop but doesn't get a hand"
slogs the fullish delivery on the leg side but gets only an inside edge towards long leg
"angling in from back of length, goes off the thigh pad towards short fine leg region"
"bit of room outside off, pushed towards point for one"
"full delivery outside off, Finch makes some room and drives to sweeper cover for two quick runs"
"too full again, this time Finch whips that away to the wide long-on boundary, in the gap for four"
"he's getting good pace to work with. Short of length and angling in, Finch hops on the back foot and glances that behind square for four more"
"on the off side now, Finchy cuts that off the back foot to deep point"
"short delivery turning away from off, slashed off the back foot and Kohli can't collect it on first attempt after a dive to his left from cover. Concedes a single"
"third one for Chahal, bowled'm! Straighter line from Chahal with some flight, looks like it was a premeditated sweep from Nath, who missed the ball completely and lost his middle stump"
"back of length and turning away, pushed to cover point"
much straighter and PK defends it back this time
"turning away from off, PK drives that in the air by just chipping it over Kohli at cover"
"slightly quicker at 87kmh, Finch waits to cut it bit late but misses"
"that's the third for Jordan too, bowls PK! Fired in a full delivery at the stumps, PK wanted to put ti away to the leg side and only got an inside edge that went off his pad to the off stump"
"angling in, the ball deflects off the pads for a leg bye to get Finch on strike"
angles this one down the leg side for a wide
hops on the back foot and defends that to leg for one
no footwork but he drives that from outside off to sweeper cover and Finch comes back in time for the second
"drags it onto his stumps, Kulkarni as well. No. 4 for Jordan! It was a back of length ball outside off, Kulkarni didn't moves his feet while trying to chop that and got an edge onto his stumps"
"stifled appeal for lbw as this one angled in sharply to hit Tambe's front pad, but well down leg"
slightly full and it's clipped to leg for one
"that was like a flighted full toss from a spinner, high enough to be called no ball even as Kohli appeals for lbw. Was going down leg for sure"
""
"another waist-high full toss, pulled to leg for one"
"straight and full, drilled back and Kohli gets his hands to it"
"slightly full again, worked to leg but can't get it beyond midwicket"
"third full toss of the over, going down leg and Finchy puts it away to the square-leg boundary for a six. Just over the boundary rope"
"nice and full outside off, driven through the covers for one"
"RCB gifting some extras now. That's a big wide down the leg side, KL doesn't collect it cleanly but Finch wants to keep strike"
"another extra - short and wide outside off now, Finch chases with a big swing and misses"
"in the block hole around off, digs it out to extra cover"
flicked in the air and down to long-on after a bounce
