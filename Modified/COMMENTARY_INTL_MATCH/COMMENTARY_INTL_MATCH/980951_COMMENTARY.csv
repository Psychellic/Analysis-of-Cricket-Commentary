"nice start. Fullish than a good length and straight, a bit of late away shape. De Kock gets squared up and he skews to point"
"too straight this time, good length but on leg and de Kock nurdles off his hips to square leg for one."
"full and straight and plumb in front. An awful stroke from Iyer and his disastrous season continues. Russell pitches this one much fuller but on middle and off. iyer brings his front foot out with a forward press, but misses a flick after playing dangerously across the line. The bat came down from a 45 degree-ish angle. Misses and gone."
"back of a length on off, climbing steeply. But Samson rises up and pats to square leg after getting on top of the bounce"
"one more. Qdk has holed out. Russell has another and Delhi are in early trouble once again. Hits a back of a length again, but wider outside off. De Kock drags it but the pace of the delivery means he gets there much later. Skews off the bat and hangs in the air for a while before Hogg settles under it at deep square leg"
"another shortish delivery on middle. Hustles Nair for pace. And he ducks underneath, with time to spare"
"superb start. Fullish and wide, but the ball flies off the surface and whizzes past Samson's half-prod"
that is a poor line. Much wider outside off and Samson fishes again. But misses. Too wide though
"adjusts and gets an edge right away. Back of a length outside off, swings away late. Samson tamely flirts with it and the ball kisses the outside edge. Falls in front of Pathan and goes through a sloppy effort."
"shot of the day. Not many shots but this could continue to stay that way. Shortish but not too wide, Samson arcs his back and then laces a thrashy cut over point"
"width again. Shortish and wide, dabbed to third man with the open face"
still too wide outside off. Holder has failed to adjust so far. Back of a length outside off and worked down to third man
and again. Seven deliveries of width from Holder. This one is inside the tramline on a back of a length. A loose waft with leaden-feet results in a swish and miss
"Russell too straight this time. Fullish down leg, clipped through square leg for a couple"
"hard length on middle and leg, nudged to square leg. Hogg is quick on it"
back of a length again. The middle of the pitch is getting hit repeatedly from both ends. Outside off and glided to third man
"too straight - on middle and leg. Flicked away past square leg, mid-on runs around to clean up"
"this isn't great bowling from Russell. A hard length again but down leg and Nair tucks it away past fine leg, Umesh runs around and makes an excellent diving save"
"another poor delivery, another boundary. Russell has had a horror over. Too full down leg and Nair will put those away, all day. A clip through square leg gets Nair four."
"137 kph. Excellent delivery, maybe the first all day. Good length, aimed at the top of off. Defended"
now back to the poor line. Back of a length on leg and Samson bunts the ball in the gap through midwicket. Nicely played.
"shortish length outside off, some away movement. Samson cuts but gets there early. Maybe signs of a slow wicket. Awkwardly played to cover"
"good delivery. Fullish outside off, Samson comes forward and drives neatly to mid-off"
"good stuff from Holder. A shortish length on off, Samson comes forward and tucks to midwicket with soft hands"
"after hitting the middle of the pitch for the majority of his spell, he fails to hit the pitch at all. A helpful full toss on leg and Nair helps himself to four. Past short fine leg. Easy"
"slowish on off, not too quick. Not too much spin. Defended back"
"too straight this time, middle and leg line and worked to deep midwicket"
"ooh, almost went through. Flat and quick, no turn, hustles off the pitch onto off. Karun goes back and gets an inside edge just in time"
"flat on off, Nair gets low for a hard sweep, square leg fields"
"a rank long-hop, pulled with bad timing to long-on. Nair cannot get enough on the freebie"
"given, Narine has his first. Flat again from Narine, pitches on off, a hint of spin takes it towards middle and leg. Samson's feet are nowhere, leaden-feet. The ball sneaks through his flick and hits him in front. Was there too much bounce? No, says the umpire"
good bouncer on off. Nair hurries underneath
"back of a length on middle, Nair stays back to block back. Nice line"
good length and straight. Nair defends again. Nice tight comeback from Russell.
the fourth ball is loose and Nair picks it off through square leg. Drifting on leg and worked away with a nice flick
short but straight. Doesn't get as high as Russell would have wanted. Nair drops it towards short leg and calls for the easy run
fullish outside off and driven to cover. Excellent Powerplay for KKR
"excellent execution. Knew what he wanted all along. Flat outside off, no turn. Nair premeditates the reverse slap and thrashes it to the third man boundary"
"some flight this time, but too full on off. Driven to long-on, and Billings says no for the second"
"use of the feet from Billings, steps to the pitch to nudge to long-on"
"Nair isn't happy, Billings doesn't want the run. Flat outside off, pushed in front of point."
"too much width, short and wide and cut away powerfully but straight to point"
"slides past the outside edge. much slower from narine, and wider. Nair plays for some extra turn, it isn't there and he is beaten"
"a poor start from Umesh this time, 137 kph. Full but down leg and it clips Billings' pads on the way to the fine leg boundary. KKR's lines haven't been too great"
"141 kph. Ooh, went away after beating the bat. Good length on a fourth-stump line, Billings attempts a punchy drive from the crease but the ball swerves past"
"fullish again on off, squeezed to the sweeper cover"
"lovely. Fullish on middle, some very late away movement. Nair, too, doesn't move his feet much. A thick outside edge to third man"
"hammered for four. Umesh tests the middle of the pitch and Billings latches onto the pull. Swats it away through midwicket, excellent timing. Got on top of the bounce, too."
"good length outside off, punched to deep point"
"nice start, tossed up on off. A bit of spin from outside off towards off. Flicked neatly to deep midwicket"
"much flatter outside off, Nair stays back to punch to deep extra cover"
"flat again, wide outside off. Billings plays with the little bit of turn, to deep midwicket."
"the googly this time, but easily picked. Nair executes a late-ish cut, in front of point, for two"
"fired in on off, pushed to long-on"
"tossed up outside of at 83 kph, driven to deep cover for a run. Tidy over for both sides."
"very slow, very short. Doesn't bounce too much. Flicked to long-on."
lovely delivery. Nicely tossed up on off and blocked. 'Lovely PC' is the call from wicketkeeper Robin
"a tad too short and wide, chopped past point for one"
"superb use of the feet, gets there and tucks to wide midwicket for two. Picked the gap nicely too"
"shortish outside off, slapped to long-off from the back foot"
"amazing timing. What a shot. Nair in full flow. Gets low and sweeps to the square leg boundary. So well executed, another gap well picked."
"some loop but full, pushed with the spin to long-on"
"yorker on leg, Nair squeezes to silly point via his boot for one"
awesome stroke. Much flatter an fuller but Villings wristily shovels the ball over cover for two. Intentionally got the ball over cover
"shimmies down again, gets to the pitch and then squeezes to long-on"
"much flatter, and shorter. Down leg, off the inside edge towards square leg. Dot balls hard to come by"
another single. Seven off Hogg again. Swat-flicked to long-on
"another sweep, well executed. Full toss through and Billings used his long reach to sweep in front of square. Yusuf does well to cut it in"
"amazing shot again. Full and wide, Billings reaches for it and pummels the ball past cover. Great timing"
"runs to the pitch again, works to deep midwicket and even Russell cannot stop two"
"four more. Billings is on fire. Too short from Chawla, a drag on but kept very low. Billings was back, but he got back down low to swat in the gap at midwicket"
"tossed up googly on off is defended. But Piyush has overstepped. Uh no,"
"medium-pace-like delivery outside off, short and wide. Flat-batted to long-on"
"too much width again, Piyush losing it now. Shortish and Nair belts a cut to deep point"
"yorker outside off, Nair backs away and under-edges to short third man"
"low full toss outside off, driven to cover but there is a naughty misfield, allows two extra runs. Daredevils coasting these overs"
"very flat on leg, tucked to midwicket after a run to the pitch"
"lovely shot. Some flight on middle, but he pulled the length back. Nair backed away and forced a drive to cover"
"another flatter trajectory delivery on leg, nudged to deep midwicket"
"extremely full on middle, Billings wanted to go big, but couldn't get under it. Muscled to long-on though for two"
"lovely shot. Short and wide, a loose delivery. Nair stays in his crease, waits for the short delivery to come to him and then upper cuts, over the keeper. Easily done"
"good call from Nair, a loud yell of 'no' and Billings scurries back. Fullish on off, pushed to point. A wild throw finds long-on"
"slower delivery on off, dabbed to third man. May be the first time I've seen pace off the ball today."
"good length outside off, Holder just went a little wider of the crease to change the point of delivery. Billings misses his drive"
"out comes that scoop. Gets way across to the full delivery outside off, executes beautifully but fine leg is back. Chawla cuts it off."
"another slower delivery on leg, nudged to deep midwicket"
four more. Nair quick on the sweep and smashes it to the square leg boundary. <strong>Fifty for Nair</strong> too. Great knock
"another sweep, this time to backward square leg. Nair gets low and meets it earlier, to get that gap behind square. Sensational batting."
"better line. Full outside off, this one moves away. Nair misses a push"
"ooh, what happened there? Did Narine want to pull away? Lets it go very late and it is a mile outside off."
"four more. Reverse-swept past point, full but no turn. Somehow, the stroke finds that gap. Astonishing placement"
"flat on off, good comeback, the length dragged back. Defended"
"much fuller on off, reverse-tapped to short third man. Easy single"
"short slow bouncer. Nair shimmies down and forehands to the bowler, on the bounce, and Holder sticks one hand out to stop the ball"
"full and quick, down leg. Nair misses a routine flick but doesn't miss the opportunity for a leg bye"
"there is Billings' innovation. Wow, what a shot. Full outside off, Billings pushes one foot forward and then sweeps the ball over square leg. Dragged that intentionally. Goes way over the boundary too."
and again. This was much fuller and much wider though. But Billings improvises to use the same stroke to hit to long-on
"slower ball on leg, a short-arm chip to long-on. No follow through. Two more"
"a shortish length on off, Nair backs away but bunts it down towards long-on. Long-on runs around but cannot reach the skier. Just one."
"what a shot from Nair. Full and wide outside off, very quick. And Nair uses that pace to loft the drive over long-off with such ease. Offered the full face of the bat and extracted exquisite timing"
"slower ball and given. Dragged the length back this time, the legcutter doesn't cut, skids on and strikes Nair in front of leg. May be clipping that leg stump. End of an exceptional innings."
"very full and straight on off, driven back to the bowler"
"gone. Morris goes for 0. 134 kph, good length on off. Morris backs away but gets a thin inside edge onto off. Excellent comeback from Umesh. Morris gave himself room but not enough."
"horrible first delivery to CB. Good length down leg, Brathwaite tickles it fine and gets four to fine leg"
"awesome. On either side of the keeper. Full on a fifth-stump line. Brathwaite just dabs past the keeper. Intentionally done, superb start."
"low full toss outside off, swept to midwicket. Russell rushes to it but can't prevent two."
"well bowled, yorker on off. Billings backs away and drills a drive to Brathwaite who gets under it to complet the run, long-off cleans up"
"the googly, Brathwiate has no idea, went back deep in the crease but gets a leading edge. Spoons over cover."
massive. The googly pitches outside leg and that makes it easier to read. Brathwaite sweeps in hope and connects easily. Way over square leg. Massive hit.
"low full toss on off, hurries Brathwaite who drives to long-off"
"six more. Flat outside off, Billings muscles the lofted drive over long-off for his first IPL fifty in his first game. Wow, what ball striking."
low full toss. Poor bowling and put away for a massive six. Poor bowling this. Brathwaite clears one foot and then heaves it away over long-on. Big big big.
"four more. Using the midwicket and the region behind the keeper very effectively. Low full toss outside off, a thick inside edge races away past the keeper."
"excellent yorker outside off, Brathwaite cannot connect but Uthappa cannot either. A bye"
"the slow, low dipping full toss. And straight. Does for Billings who cannot read the slower ball. Misses it after shuffling across to sweep. Crashes into middle and leg stump. Could still be a big wicket. Billings was looking lethal"
"another slower cutter on off, driven to mid-off for a quick single. Out with a direct hit, but the stumps don't light up"
looks for that fine dab again but he can't get far away enough from the full toss. Gets too much bat on it and taps to point
slower ball and thwacked over midwicket for a humongous hit. Outside off and Brathwaite drags the heave. Huge huge striking this
"slower ball and gone. Takes a lot off pace off the ball and Brathwaite cannot generate enough pace on his scoop. Gets just enough bat on it to carry to short fine leg. Again, a big wicket. What a blitz."
"oh man, Russell readies, takes aim, fires and misses. Full on leg, Shami misses the flick and goes through with the leg bye. Russell is quick on the ball and misses the non-strikers stumps"
"lovely change in pace. Another slower ball outside off, Pant is through the swat too early"
"quick short delivery on off, pant is too late on his pull, lobs to long-off with such bad timing that they make two with ease"
"excellent finish from Russell. Yorker on off, pushed to long-on. The throw is a tad wayward but Robin picks up and under-arms the throw onto the stumps. A run-saving effort from Uthappa."
"shortish start from Zaheer, outside off. Sits up for Uthappa who mis-times his swat to midwicket"
"the offcutter is brought out quite early, but starts too straight and this one goes straight on. No cut. Flicked through square leg, fine leg runs around to clean up"
"good length, some inward shape, on middle and leg. Tucked to wide square leg. Gambhir calls Uthappa through"
"too straight again, a perfect line to the right-hander. Gambhir walks across and flicks but misses. Umpire Erasmus doesn't call a wide"
nice. Full and wide outside from Zaheer. Some late away movement. Gambhir doesn't  bother with it. Left
"a loose poke from Gautam. Good length outside off, dabbed past slip. Shami runs around and sticks out his boot to stop the ball. Applause from Zaheer"
"beauty. Good length outside off, Utahppa puts in a half-foot forward to drive but doesn't get close enough. The ball swerves past the outside edge"
"fullish on off, driven to mid-off. Uthappa drives to mid-off for a quick single. Good run"
"not that short but Gautam was quick on the back foot, on his toes to flick to square leg. Nice line too, around off."
"another nice single. Good length on off, pushed to mid-on for another quick run"
"full on off, 143 kph. Gambhir tucks to square leg quite awkwardly but the run is easily made"
superb shot. Not even that straight but Uthappa closes the bat face to flick past square leg for four. Superlative timing. Good length on middle and Uthappa drags the flick.
"beautiful bowling. Fullish and wide outside off, purposefully bowled because Gambhir shuffled across for a across-the-line heave. He has to improvise to drive to mid-off for one"
"out with a direct hit. Gambhir wandering out and slow to turn back. Fullish outside off, driven to cover. Gambhir wants a non-existent run but Uthappa says no. The throw misses the stumps and there is an overthrow too."
"good length outside off, a bit of away shape. Pulled to square leg, awful timing"
"in the gap and four. Full and wide outside off, Uthappa drives and doesn't time it too well, but gets enough on it. In the gap, past mid-off. Mishra gives up on a dive quite early."
"straight on a  good length. Uthappa drives from the crease, to mid-off. Mid-on gets around to field."
"gone, Zaheer gets the early wicket. And a huge wicket too. Fullish on off, Gambhir was standing on off, throughout his stay. Tries to flick this through midwicket but is through the shot too early. A leading edge is taken by cover who had to backtrack a few steps."
"good length down leg, flicked to deep square for a run."
"back of a length on leg, skids on and hurries Chawla who gets to his flick by the time the ball has struck his thigh pad. A leg bye is easily completed"
"nice shot. Full length on off, Uthappa drives back to the bowler. Full face of the bat. KKR falling behind the asking rate already"
"lovely slower ball, deceived Uthappa who withdrew from his pull too late. Checked the stroke to deep square leg. luckily, it did not carry"
smashed. Too full and a clean swing of the bat through the ball. Uppish but wide of mid-off.
"good comeback. Accurate lines, nagging around off. Shami pulled his length back this time. Chawla gets his feet away from the line and bunts it back to the bowler."
"good length outside off, some away movement. Skewed to point"
"fullish on off, 135 kph. Uthappa attempts a hoick across the line but the ball comes back in just enough to take the inside half to square leg"
"sloppy from Mishra at mid-on. Full length on off, Chawla clears his front foot and mis-times the swipe to mid-on. Bounces just in front of him, but goes through his hands"
"given. Full on middle and leg, Chawla gets nowhere with his feet. Backs away, then comes back into the line. By the time, all his movements are done, the ball has sneaks through and hits him in front of leg. A little bit of doubt, would that have drifted down leg? Was it high? Umpire Erasmus says no to either"
"lovely lines these from Zaheer. Full on off, Yusuf defends solidly."
"138 kph, loose from Yusuf. Full outside off, Yusuf drives with leaden-feet, on the up and it is badly times. Lands well in front of cover"
"fullish length on off, skewed to cover for another run. Struggling for fluency"
"full and straight on middle, Yusuf closes the bat face to tuck to square leg for a quick run"
"nice lines. Another good length delivery outside off, tapped towards mid-off for one. Uthappa hanging in"
"shortish on off, Yusuf is quick on the pull but doesn't time it too well. In front of square though, and Billings gets to it before firing a throw to the batsman's end"
"on the bounce to the long-off boundary. Fullish outside off, Yusuf doesn't bother moving his feet. Picks his spot and lofts the stroke over mid-off. Nicely done"
"back of a length outside off, swatted to deep square leg. Off the toe end."
"loose delivery. Short but nowhere near his normal pace. Yusuf pulls past square leg, deep midwicket runs around to keep it in."
"nice from Morris. Good length, jagging back in to Uthappa who is forced to defend. Daredevils have been accurate with the ball. Knight Riders weren't"
"superb timing from Uthappa. Is that the first stroke he has timed today? Good length on leg, Uthappa brings the bat down with an angle to flick past mid-on for four. Nice"
"quite full, tailing back in to Uthappa. That late inward movement takes the inside half of Uthappa's flick. The boundary is saved by a dive"
nice bouncer. Aimed at the shoulder. Utahppa awkwardly gets away from the line.
"slower ball on leg, Utahappa is deceived but improvises with a flick. Misses. Off the thigh pad to square leg"
"good length, Brathwaite jumps very wide of the crease. And therefore the ball is too straight with that angle. Tucked to square leg"
"good length outside off, Yusuf opens the face of the bat to guide to third man"
"phew, fantastic timing. Short and it sits up for Uthappa to swat with a superb pull, over midwicket. Lovely batting"
"back of a length on off, nice line. Uthappa drops his hands and taps by the crease on the off side. An easy run"
"slower short delivery on middle, was that a legcutter? Pathan picks out short fine leg, not a great shot. Brathwaite takes pace off the ball and Pathan sees an opportunity to get the ball past fine leg, but instead swivels into his pull and doesn't smash it keep it down. Straight to Mishra."
"yorker outside off, Surya jams it out to cover to get a run"
"short and wide, Suryakumar reaches there late and under-edges it past slip. Shreyas runs around from third man to save two. Excellent dive"
"good length on off, Suryakumar picks it off his pads but times it horribly. Actually, times it perfectly. It lands right in between square leg and the man running in from deep midwicket. Poor shot"
"fullish on off, pushed to mid-off for a run"
"lovely stop from Brathwaite at mid-off. Low full toss on off, driven into the surface, past the bowler. Brathwaite runs around and sticks out a hand to stop the boundary"
another full delivery on off which is driven to mid-off. Just the one
shortish length on leg at 137 kph. Suryakumar is hurried through his flick. Somehow gets some bat on the flick to midwicket. A boundary-less over
"good length on leg, worked with the angle to square leg. Just one"
"very slow on off, tapped to point for a quick single. Well played"
shot! Short and wide but Suryakumar makes more room for himself by backing away. Scythes the cut over point for four.
"slower legcutter but down leg, tapped to midwicket. Just one"
"fullish length outside off, pushed to extra cover"
"offcutter this time, Suryakumar doesn't pick the variation. Pulled to wide short fine leg."
"another no ball. Slips out of his hand and down leg. Very dangerous but luckily, it wasn't straight. Goes down leg and de Kock can't collect either. Five. A warning for Brathwaite"
punished. 12 free runs for KKR. Slower delivery on middle and Suryakumar backs away and then lofts the swat over long-on. 22 off the over.
"nicely floated up on off, not much turn. Uthappa defends"
"tossed up again, but drags the length back. Short and wide, thrashed to deep point"
"much slower through the air, nice bowling. But wide, the ball spins a tad and takes the under-edge of Uthappa's bat to short third man."
"the googly down leg, helped on its way to square leg. 80 kph from Mishra"
"flat on middle, Uthappa opts for the reverse slap. Hits it straight to short third man though"
"81 kph, another googly outside off, Uthappa looks to drive but cannot connect. Big appeal but strikes him just outside off, a leg bye to third man"
"fullish on middle and leg, clipped with the angle to deep midwicket"
"superb catch from mid-on. Full on leg, from wide of the crease. Suryakumar look to go over mid-on, but got it off the toe-end. Horribly timed. Shreyas Iyer runs in from mid-on, doesn't look like he'll get there but dives full length to get both hands on it. One of those hands come off the ball but he pouches it in the end, excellent catch"
flicked to deep midwicket
"very full on off, pushed to mid-on by R Sathish"
"full and straight, very tight lines. Uthappa lunges forward to clip to deep midwicket, in the gap and he'll get two"
"full toss, another one, on off. Under the waist though. Worked to deep midwicket. Successful over for Daredevils."
"flat on off, Uthappa goes back but punches back to the bowler. Mishra fields but tries to run Sathish out, who had backed out too far. Misses the stumps and they'll get one"
"nicely bowled. Slow through the air on off, Sathish defends solidly"
Sathish had no idea of the googly. He went back to cut the shortish delivery but the ball continues inward and strikes the batsman on his body
"shortish on off, Sathish pulls to long-on. Not very well timed and it fails to carry"
"nicely delivered again, slow and straight. Uthappa goes back to cut, chops a cut to point"
"oh, loose delivery. Wanted to protect the over from the wild hoick and bowled it much wider and shorter outside off, cut away to point. Should have done more with that"
"slowish on off, flicked uppishly to deep square leg."
"bludgeoned. Good length on off, Sathish chose the straight option. Even though, the ball wasn't full he went through with the drive on the up. Over the umpire and four"
"picks out deep square leg. 132 kph from Brathwaite on middle, shortish delivery. Sathish pulls and doesn't bother keeping it down. Did not hit it as well as he would have liked. Morris runs around and takes a quality catch, his hands reverse cupped."
"very full on middle, off the middle of the bat, the drive scurries to long-on"
"good length and straight again, Uthappa tucks to square leg, again. Not many balls have gone anywhere except that leg side arc"
"well played. Good length outside off, Russell wanted to get that area, but did he intend that as fine as that. Doesn't natter because he gets four. A late dab past the keeper for four. With short third man up, clever option."
"flat, down leg, Wide"
"massive from Uthappa. Tossed up on off, Uthappa races down to the pitch and then lifts the ball with a nice clean swing, over long-off. Fifty from Uthappa, he has anchored this chase,"
"shortish and wide, very flat. Chopped to Zaheer at extra cover. No run."
"terribly timed, so bad that it did not even clear the 30-yard circle. The topspinner on off, Uthappa tries to slog sweep but slices it, skies in the air but lands safely"
"googly down leg, Russell doesn't pick it. wide"
"flat again, skids on to Russell who gets bat down on it, just in time. Kept out"
"another flat delivery, googly, awkwardly patted to long-on"
"very full outside off, not sure if that was the medium-pace delivery. Uthappa opens the face to scythe the drive, just wide of a diving Zaheer at extra cover."
"lovely change in pace, slow delivery outside off. Russell looks to heave over long-in with a massive swing. Misses the off stump by not too much"
"excellent bowling this. Slower bouncer on middle, Russell ducks underneath"
"another dot. Full and wide outside off, shaped away. Russell misses another big golf swing."
"this one is connected with and it is dispatched. Good length delivery on middle, in the arc and Russell flat-bats his swat way over midwicket. Huge."
"full toss,l down leg, another wide. Shami looking for that full yorker on leg stump"
"slower delivery on off, clipped to wide long-on, who is quick on it to prevent the second"
"yorker, just misses and it is the next best option, a low full toss. Bunted past the stumps, to long-on"
"slow and flight on off, Uthappa slog sweeps it away over midwicket for six. Excellent shot. A tad too full from Mishra?"
"through the legs. How did he get that there? A very wide legbreak outside off, Uthappa switch hits, but doesn't get there. He is through the shot but the back of his bat comes down late and he gets some bat on it to get the ball through the keeper's legs. What a shot!"
flicked to deep midwicket
"massive appeal, a nice googly on middle and leg from Mishra. Russell doesn't pick it again, sliding down leg. Good call"
"another googly on middle, Russell gets down on one knee and sweeps powerfully betweent square leg and midwicket"
"what a catch!  A match-turning effort from Mishra. Slow flight on off from Mishra, Russell runs down and smashes the ball back at Mishra's face. Mishra hurriedly gets his hands up in an effort to save himself. And the ball sticks. Could have been very very dangerous if the ball burst through his hands. He takes it and fires the ball back at the stumps."
"ooh, full on off, in the arc for the big hit. Uthappa lofts the drive to long-off"
"what is Holder doing? A golden duck. Excellent low full toss on leg, Holder misses the flick. the ball hits his pads and rolls back up the pitch. Holder runs down, had no idea of where the ball had rolled. It had gone straight to Morris who ran in and under-armed the throw onto the stumps with Holder well out."
"fullish on leg, driven to long-on. One to Yadav"
"gone. And that should be the match. Full and wide outside off, Uthappa backs away and slices the cut, but straight to backward point. Had to reach for it and did not get enough bat on it, to get the ball in front of point"
"yorker on middle, worked in the gap at midwicket for a couple."
"yorker outside off, 136 kph. Steered to point for a quick single."
"short delivery, but down leg. A wide, another extra"
"full toss on middle, hit on the up to long-off"
"nice delivery, a slow offcutter on off. Yadav goes for the big heave but toe-ends to long-off. Narine has to come back for the second and does. Iyer, though, picks up cleanly and hits the stumps at the bowler's end. Narine is a foot short."
"and that is the game! KKR have stumbled to back to back losses. Another slower ball on middle, Yadav gets across and swats the ball in the air but straight to deep square leg. Morris takes a sitter and Daredevils have a big win"
