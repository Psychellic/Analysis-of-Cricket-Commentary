"<b>extra cover boundary!</b> Another full toss outside off. He's feeding Williamson for the exact shots that he uses in the slog overs - and mind you, he doesn't have as much power and range as some other batsmen. The cover drive though, he will put you away every time. Latches onto it and lifts it on the bounce over the boundary"

"<b>taken at long-off.</b> Shankar stretches up and holds on to it in front of the SRH dugout. Hetmyer is livid with himself. He lost control of that shot. Short ball, googly, spinning away outside off. He wanted to cut firmly but that got big on him and he had to check his shot.

"<b>taken at mid-off!</b> Oh you're kidding me! The Chinnaswamy crowd must have seen more twists in this stage of a game than anyone else. Sundar with...to be honest, an utterly pathetic shot. Slower short of a length ball outside off. He shuffles, presumably to pull. But ends up jabbing at it, well in front of his body. Chipped straight over the bowler and Pandey hangs on"
