"<b>nicked off behind</b> and Rahul's struggle ends. Great line from Roach and though Rahul has been batting for a while, he hasn't looked fluent, so it's not surprising that he pushes at it away from body fairly limply too. The ball is moving away and takes the edge for a simple catch to the keeper"
"<b>that's outstanding from Roach</b>. And Kohli has gone for a first-ball duck. Excellent lines from Roach once again, in that channel on fourth stump, forcing Kohli to play at it, but gets it to move away enough so that it takes the edge and goes to the keeper."
"<b>oh my word! it's an inside edge that has gone for four</b>. Millimetres - that's how far we were from having two hat-tricks in the same Test. Rahane pushed uncertainly at this, with Roach maintaining that excellent line. Takes the inside edge because Roach has got this one to nip back after taking the previous two away.

<b>lovely shot</b>. Given room and width outside off and he cuts it through backward point for a boundary. Well balanced and well timed
"<b>beaten</b> angling in from wide of the crease, pitches on off and straightens. Vihari is playing inside the line with bat tucked close to pad, to minimise the risk of edging"
"tossed up and he goes for the sweep, but gets an under-edge that bounces to leg slip"
"down the track and goes for the big lofted drive straight, but ends up getting a thick inside edge and goes to the vacant square leg area. Was targetting long-on"

"length ball on the stumps, comes on the front foot and works it through midwicket"
<b>just clear short leg</b>. Some sharp turn for Chase and Rahane wasn't in control of that push-flick having moved across. Goes over Hetmyer's head at short leg. Too little time to react to call it a drop
"fuller on the stumps, patted to long-on"

"<b>a direct-hit and Brooks was lazily pushing his bat back like he wasn't even expecting a throw.</b> And he'll pay for it! That is sensational fielding from Kohli. Length ball just outside off, pushed past silly point and takes a walk down the pitch. Kohli sprints to his left at cover and turns around from the right before he picks the ball up. In the process he's taken out a few seconds because as soon as his full rotation is complete, the ball is out of his hands. And then it hits the stumps on the bounce. Sharp, sharp stuff. And the exact opposite from the batsman, who is walking back with no vigour. A shame for a well-fought innings to end that way"
