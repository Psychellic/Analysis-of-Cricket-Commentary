"good length delivery outside off, some inswing. Latham leaves belatedly"
"full and straight from Morris. Latham falls over his flick and is hit on the pad. <strong>AB calls for a review, late, very late</strong>. Wasn't that more than 15 seconds? Nonetheless, the third umpire is called on to adjudicate. First impression is that it is a good review irrespective of the result. That's very close! All reds on HawkEye and Latham has to go. Pitched in line, check. Some swing subsequently, inswing. Takes the ball past Latham's inside edge, and hit him in front of middle and leg - the second red. Generally, if the first two are good, the third is good too, as is the case here. Good review from SA."

drags the length short which makes it easy for Williamson to rock back and pull to deep square leg
"now 180 degrees on the other side. Beautiful cover drive, although he is helped by its being a half-volley. Simply leans into it"
"and now he's gone. Just a hint of turn from Shamsi, and it's the perfect amount to induce uncertainty in Williamson's game. He originally shapes to cut, seeing the length short, but it pitches, moves off the pitch, does so seriously slowly as well, and ruins the batsman's timing. Inside edge onto the stumps"

"excellent footwork as Santner backs away, using the depth of the crease to crash a short ball through cover point"
"not entirely sure how he's made such good connection, after being totally out of place. Santner sees the length short and rocks back, aiming to pull, but the ball rips away off the pitch, like this is the subcontinent. Somehow he reaches out and late cuts it past short third man"

fires it into the base of off stump - not quite a yorker though - from around the wicket. Santner's in behind it
lovely strike. Perhaps pace on the ball would work in New Zealand's favour. This is simply a chip over mid-off and it's been timed so brilliantly that we have a one-bounce four

"there's the change of pace, hitting the deck, ensuring Santner has nothing to work with. Dab to third man"

"top work from de Kock, has precious little time to react to this inside edge off the toe end of the bat. The dive to the left is essentially reflex action and he gets a good glove on it"

"bouncer, hook, appeal for caught behind! The on-field decision from umpire Joel Wilson is not-out but South Africa go for a review. Over to you, Paul Reiffel. Inconclusive evidence on HotSpot but there's a massive spike on Snicko as the ball goes past the bat and Santner has to walk back. This short ball was too quick, it climbed too high, Santner was also looking to drag it from outside off. Basically a list of 'oh nos' fior a batsman"

"pulls brutally past a diving short midwicket, but the ball has plenty of distance to cover and the deep square leg moves across to his right in time. Neesham definitely trying to up the ante"
"catch is the cry and this will be a brilliant take it if happens. Behardien is the man tracking it, running such a distance from long-on, puts in a dive, sticks out his left hand and it only just evades it. Neesham goes for an ill-advised loft - he kind of has to at this stage of the game - and mistimes it badly.

"oooh, the inside edge nearly trickles onto the stumps. de Grandhomme would have been expecting the ball to singe the turf through cover all the way to the boundary - that's how hard he hit it, without entirely moving his feet, and that's perhaps why he mis-hits"
"the googly to start off, and it appears there is a bottom edge. De Kock's reaction certainly suggests it, but there is no way he could have caught this. He picks the googly, but the inside edge means the ball sneaks under his gloves"
"back of a length, steers it to sweeper cover"
"comes in off the pitch very quickly - not often has that happened today - and de Grandhomme, looking to pull, is hit on the body. Flipper, beautiful"
"is this a catch? Or wait, is this a run-out? In the end it's four runs, after overthrows! It all begins with de Grandhomme winding up, but being dragged too far outside off stump to make contact with the ball - lovely bowling from Tahir, tossing it up wide. The mis-hit lands out of the reach of the third man and point fielders running after it. The throw them comes to the keeper's end, which Neesham is safe, but de Kock goes for a direct hit at the bowler's end, knowing de Grandhomme is struggling. Could have been out had Tahir been behind the stumps to collect the ball and flip the bails off. Then again, there is plenty of heat on this throw"

"shifts his weight back, makes sure his bat is straight enough and that is why he is able to time this short-arm jab through to deep midwicket"

"that's rather tame. No one even appeals because everyone knows its out. Neesham is cramped as he goes for a pull, and he's into his shot too early as well. Gets only a glove on it and the ball arcs over straight into de Kock's gloves. Rabada's like, 'Yeah, I do that all the time, man. No big'"
"short of a length and outside off, Southee actually manages to stay in line with it and block to cover. He's in proper batsman mode"
"that's well played, but the fielding effort trumps it! Behardien again! He tracks down a superb upper cut from Southee, running to his left, eyes on the ball and then puts in the slide to catch the ball low to the ground. But his momentum is taking him through towards the ropes. So instinctively he pops it back into the field, but then raises the question of the catch again. He believes he had the ball in control.

digs it in short and makes it climb over the top-edge as Southee goes for a hook off his front foot

"flicks it to midwicket, Shamsi nails the stumps at the bowler's end, but de Southee's safe. Phew, too much action."
"goes for the yorker, with the ball tailing in, de Grandhomme works it to midwicket and gets off for a single. He's ab it slow to do so and would have been out had Tahir hit the stumps"
"beaten for lack of pace - brilliant work from Rabada, going for the slower ball outside off once he saw Southee clearing his front leg. But they pinch a bye. Only just though, de Kock's relaty to Rabada and then his throw at the bowler's end could easily have run him out"

"carves it to the right of the sweeper! Not too many cricket balls have been hit harder than that. Especially considering Southee was backing away at the start, then has to reach out with Morris bowling wide outside off."
"there's a little luck going New Zealand's way. It's a bouncer on middle and leg, Southee goes for a hook and gets a top edge over the keeper. Southee and de Grandhomme yanking the game back to neutral"

"<b>big turn</b>! The ball ends up in slip's hands, turning past the outside edge as Amla goes for the expansive cover drive over the top."
another loopy delivery - devoid of pace - Amla tries to make it all himself and mistimes it to short cover
"<b>absolute snorter</b>! This is by no means a flighted delivery. It's meant to be a dart, meant to pin Amla in his crease and refuse him the liberty of freeing his arms. Amla is set up for the flick but then has to hurry into playing with a straight bat as the ball simply cuts 90 degrees to the other way. Squares the batsman up, going past the outside edge"
"fuller delivery, seaming away off the pitch, de Kock guides it to point"
"stands tall and thwacks a shortish delivery outside off to cover. Good timing, not quite so with the placement"
appreciable swing away from the left-hander and de Kock does well to play with soft hands and drive to short cover

"lovely shot again, the clincher being how late he plays it, hanging back in his crease against a short ball and steering it to deep third man"
"back of a length and outside off, Amla shoulders arms. He's assessed the new ball is too risky to trifle with. He's assessed South Africa have the hitters at the back end to make up for the dots now"
"screams away to the fine leg boundary! With Santner bowling over the wicket into leg stump, de Kock takes a very safe and very profitable option - the sweep, past leg slip and short fine leg"
"moves himself onto off stump to open up the leg side again, and this length ball is flicked to backward of square"
"ooh, Taylor at leg slip is in play. Good change of pace from Santner, held the ball back just enough, lines it up on leg stump and preys on the batsman's natural instincts to flick out of that line. de Kock realises the risk just in time to soften his hands and make sure the ball drops in front of Taylor's dive to his right"
pushes a length ball outside off into the covers
"oooh, lovely bowling. On a pitch that is giving plenty of turn, Santner spears the arm ball in on middle and leg. Amla going back to try and carve it through the off side has to temper those instincts to stay alive"

<b>extra bounce</b> from Boult as he leaves de Kock disgruntled after a short ball outside off beats his cut shot
flicks a length ball on middle to midwicket
"that's well done, de Kock was preempting the ball to be short and into the body, but Boult sticks to keeping it in the corridor outside off stump. The batsman then has to weave his torso back to get the room to scythe it with his wrists behind point"
"beautiful line from Boult, pitching in on middle and leg, darting the ball off the seam and squaring the batsman up as he blocks"
"<b>leading edge</b>, but it lands safe enough. The dangers still apparent on this slow pitch. Boult exploits it beautifully by pitching it up on middle and leg stump and tempting Amla to flick across the line. Credit to the batsman though for softening his hands"
"jumps up off his toes to blunt a short ball at his body, and places it well enough tp find a single at midwicket"
"short and wide outside off, Amla goes for the cut, but his timing is off because the ball comes on a lot later than he thinks"
nudges the short delivery off his hips behind square leg
"gorgeous cricket. Straight out of a Test match. Southee nibbles for the outside edge with a fuller delivery that weaves away in the air and off the pitch. Amla, prepares to play, but at the last instant realises he could leave it without any damage to his stumps"
excellent placement! Amla is so switched on. He has been keeping the good balls out - and he's got plenty of them - but when the bad one comes - like this short and down leg side - he pulls it past short fine leg's left
"<b>indecision</b>. Amla is shaping to move back and across to block a shortish delivery outside off - thinking it would come into him - but it holds its line. Amla tries to leave it, but the ball thuds into the open face and goes behind point"
"shortish and outside off, taps it to cover"
gets in line with a fuller delivery on off stump and rolls his wrists to send it to midwicket
that's a very very slow bouncer. Amla could have had a spot of tea out on the pitch before preparing to play. Set up for the pull shot - waits an age in that pose - and then connects only to find midwicket
"shortish and into the pads, Amla nudges it to long leg"
"moves around the wicket for a length ball outside off, de Kock will be peeved he couldn't lash this behind point"
"like that! Hangs back, makes some room on the leg side and smears a short delivery outside off to deep point. Rapier-like"
through the gap between point and cover as Amla cuts the back of a length ball
"starts well with a length ball on off stump and Amla, using the depth of the crease, slides it to point for a quick single"
"reverse sweep first ball, and he has to do a lot of effort to make the kind of connection he can profit from. This is a quicker delivery, almost down leg, and he has to drag it with his wrists"
leans into the drive and looks so pretty doing it. Broom at short cover dives to his right - looking equally awesome - to keep it to a single
mild appeal for lbw as de Kock plants his front leg across and plays around his front pad a bit. Inside edge saves him
"there it is! Or not. We have to wait at least until the third umpire takes a call on this lbw appeal for de Kock has reviewed the on-field decision of out. This is a lovely ball again, tossed up high over the batsman's eyeline, making him play a flick, without being properly balanced at the crease. The ball pitches on middle and turns very sharply. Should be missing leg and ball-tracking confirms it"
finishes it off very nicely with a good length ball that seems to zip onto de Kock as he looks to go deep in his crease and flick. In the end he offers no real shot and takes it under the hip
"back of a length and outside off, turns it to square leg"
a little width outside off and de Kock slices it to point
"goes for a cover drive on the up, looking to muscle the ball through, but can't find the gap"
"top shot! He is clued in to de Grandhomme's line - it'll always be outside off - so he moves across, gets a short ball too, which is perfect and he pulls it to the square leg boundary"
now the line is shifted even wider outside off. Pace is taken off as well and with de Kock going for a full-blooded square drive - the bat face opening - the ball skews high over point
"back of a length and outside off, dabs it to third man"
"perfect legbreak on this pitch. It drifts in on middle and leg, brings the batsman forward. A less careful player might have flicked across the line, but Amla plays with a straight bat"
"plants the straight bat down in line with the ball on middle and off. Not much turn yet for him, but his control is quite good"
"pulls his length back and Amla picks it early, moves back and punches it through point"
"magnificent reverse sweep. He turns a perfectly decent delivery, tossed up on middle stump, into something almost abysmal. That's pure talent and timing."
"goes for a reverse sweep again, but this time Sodhi bowls it slower and lines it up outside leg so de Kock has to work harder to drag the ball across. Premeditation doesn't always work every time"
"good length ball on middle and leg, nudges it to midwicket"
"shortish and outside off, dabs it to deep third man"
yanks a short ball from outside off to deep square leg with a pull
"backs away and smashes a short delivery just outside off to the left of short cover. Williamson has a lot of work to do, running to his right and diving to stop the ball"
takes on a bouncer on off stump and pulls it to deep square leg
"belts it back down the ground. These aren't the shots a batsman can play easily on a slow pitch. De Kock helps his case by coming down the track, making his own pace and thumps a back of a length ball past mid-off's left"
"he's just having fun now, having put in the hard yards when the new ball was swinging around, or holding in the pitch. Short, slow and outside off. but de Kock jumps across his crease and pulls it past fine leg's right."
"gives it a lot of air and makes it dip on leg stump, Amla waits and waits and waits before he guides it to point"
"plays against the turn, leaning over the tossed up legbreak on off stump. Gets an inside edge to fine leg. Could have been a candidate for lbw there"
"set up for the reverse, so the bowler pulls his length back. De Kock adjusts to it, waits in his reversed stance and then makes solid enough connection to find a single at third man"
moves back and flicks a flatter delivery - googly too - to the right and in front of mid-on
"pulls out the orthodox sweep, taking a length ball on leg stump and sending it to long leg"
opens the face to deal with a fuller delivery outside off when he realises he couldn't quite get to the pitch of it.
"shortish and outside off, de Kock cuts through cover"
""
"a little turn outside off, which dissuades de Kock from hitting the back foot cover drive as hard as he would like"
the angle into the pads helps de Kock there as he gets down leg and sweeps powerfully to the long leg boundary. Magnificent batting. It was in the picking of the line that made the shot
"good length ball, pushes it through cover"
"stays around the stumps to the right-hander, and he pitches it way down leg side"
"pitches on leg stump and Amla shifts inside the line of it to try and get another wide. Williamson thought he had it too, falling down to his haunches, but umpire Joel Wilson simply says 'over'"
"'catch,' is the cry of great hope as de Kock top edges a sweep shot. The ball goes to the right of the long leg fielder and falls short of him as well"
"tosses it up, from over the wicket, onto off stump, defends"
whips a fuller delivery from the base of off stump to one of two short midwickets
"dainty little lap sweep now and with the long leg fielder moved squarer for when the connection is a lot more harder, Sodhi has no chance. One of his best fifties. De Kock is at his best on a true pitch with pace on the ball, but he here has persevered through the early stages when the ball did tricks and is now profiting handsomely"
"comes down the track, but Santner flattens his length and doesn't allow de Kock to get the leverage he wants. The batsman nudges behind square leg"
"advances again, but this slower delivery seems to kick up off the pitch a lot more than de Kock expects and he is hit on the body"
"drags a tossed up delivery from outside off and sweeps it powerfully to deep square leg. Santner does excellently, racing to his right and diving to stop the ball inches from the boundary"
"pops it back to the bowler, Williamson has gambled and he has won. He came into the attack looking for a bit of luck and he creates it by bowling wicket to wicket. Amla tries to manufacture a shot, coming down the track and flicking it, looking for wide mid-on. Mistimes it, to his great detriment and New Zealand's great joy"
"stays around the wicket, as he was to Amla when he dismissed him. This is a tossed up delivery on off stump, flicks it through midwicket"
"whoa, perhaps he wanted to remind the folks that he is still a part-timer? Anyway, this is a loopy old full toss on off stump and de Kock tees off over long-on"
"backs away to try and cut a short ball behind point, but it bounces up a bit more than he prefers and ruins the timing"
"oh come on, if that isn't a cry from the universe to tell Kane to stick to batting, nothing is. He plops up an offbreak that pitches in his own half, then pitches again before reaching de Kock, who thrown as he is, manages to hit it to cover"
"tosses it up outside off, du Plessis inches forward just a tad, does his best to account for the turn, but he miscalculates. Ripper of a ball, beating the outside edge of one of the most in-form batsmen in the world"
"<b>even better</b>. This is a tossed up delivery on off stump, drawing Faf forward to block, with a bit of a closed face. All seems okay now, but as soon as the ball starts dipping, there is trouble. It grips into the pitch, turns sharply, bounces madly and beats the batsman all ends up"
shifts back and punches down the ground to long-on
"shortish and outside off, attempts a cut, but he is beaten. Plays a touch too early"
""
"stays leg side of a flighted delivery and launches it over extra cover. Boult is the man down there, gets half a scare as he doesn't collect the ball properly. But it is still inside the field"
"premeditates a sweep, which allows the bowler to shorten his length, on off stump and makes sure it goes off the top edge to square leg"
"loops it up outside off, Faf jams it out to cover and gets across to the other end"
"huge appeal for lbw as de Kock goes for the sweep again, planting his front leg in line with off stump. That's seriously close, but New Zealand are happy not to review. HotSpot reveals why - glove and then onto front pad"
"this is a googly, and de Kock picks it, rocks back and pulls to deep midwicket"
<b>turns square</b>. Faf does his best to meet it with a polite forward defensive but the ball simply thumbs his nose at him and instead shows some love to the wicketkeeper
works it into the midiwcket region
goes back to a flatter delivery outside off and drills it through cover
"darts it outside off, trying to make de Kock reach outside the off stump. Mistimed cut through cover"
backs away and carves the flatter ball outside off through point
waits on the back foot on off stump and flicks it through midwicket
"tosses it up on leg stump, de Kock clips it to the right of midwicket"
"tosses it up on middle and off, Faf steps beside it and drives to cover"
"shortish and outside off, de Kock pulls to midwicket"
"he's a bruiser. Leans back to hammer a short offcutter down the ground. Not his best shot of the night, but certianly effective"
"shortish and outside off, slices it to deep third man"
"moves to around the wicket for an offcutter on off stump, Faf du Plessis is very squared up as he tries to defend and nearly pops a leading edge back to the bowler"
"backs away to a short delivery outside off and carves it towards the third man boundary. Sodhi is the man there, moving to his right, trying to get his body behind the ball, but it pitches on the half-volley beside his hand and goes past"
"this is a top edge, three men are hunting it, but the short ball, which secured the mis-hit, lands right in between third man running in and point and the wicketkeeper running back"
"pins him in front. This is a beautifully tossed up legbreak, pitching on middle, dipping under the cross-bat shot as du Plessis sweeps. Is it turning too much? The batsman pins his hopes on that as he goes for a review. The impact is with the front pad first, that'll help Sodhi. No bat there, that'll also help Sodhi. Ball tracking says pitching in line, hitting in line and grazing off stump (umpire's call)"
"good length ball outside off, defends"
"viciously hit. He lunges forward, the front leg moving across and outside the line of the stumps, his head gets low to watch the ball carefully and then those powerful forearms belt the ball behind square"
"goes for another sweep, and though he misses the shot, his front pad is outside the line of off stump to negate the lbw appeal"
drives it to long-off
shifts back and flicks a flatter delivery on off stump to deep square leg
appeal for a caught behind as Boult's short of a length delivery moves in off the pitch and cuts de Kock in half. Took the top flap of the pads and through to the wicketkeeper
"short and outside off, de Kock smacks it through cover"
"taken at short midwicket, Boult does it for his team yet again! This is the slower short ball and de Kock looks to muscle it the only close-in fielder on the leg side. The lack of pace does just enough to spoil his timing and Taylor moves quickly to his right, reaches out with both hands and comes up with a sharp catch"
"<B>that's a beauty</b>. Boult's control of length is just so good. This is an offcutter, and he could basically pitch it on a hanky on a good length area. Benefits from the grip available on this pitch and cuts the new batsman in half"
"goes for the bouncer, good ploy against a man yet to establish himself on this pitch. Duminy ducks"
"now for the yorker outside off, Duminy steers it past point"
"utterly deceives him! Oh this is fantastic bowling. Full and angled into the leg stump from around the wicket with the sole purpose of making Duminy flick and close the face of the bat a little early. The slower ball does that job beautifully, takes the leading edge and ends up back in Southee's own hands"
"he's on a hat-trick! Hamilton roars in delight. This is top-class bowling on a pitch affording so much to them. The offcutter pitches on a good length just outside off, Behardien moves forward tentatively to defend, leaving a slight gap between bat and pad and half a second later his stumps are in disarray. That's a 120 kph R Ashwin offbreak"
"it's the slower ball again, this time though it is lined on leg stump, Morris clips to short midwicket"
"back of a length and outside off, taps it behind point"
"good length ball on off stump, Morris defends, and has to yank his bottom hand off the bat. Offcutter again, this one bouncing up to hit the shoulder of the bat"
"shortish and outside off, de Villiers gets close to it and tries to run it down to third man. There's not enough pace to do that"
"back of a length on off stump, nudges it past square leg"
lovely little nudge through square leg as de Villiers waits until the very last second to commit to his stroke
"back of a length and outside off, punches it to short cover"
"gets some swing on this full delivery outside off, Morris hits with it to long-on"
"angled into middle and leg, de Villiers flicks it through to deep square leg and he races across for the second run. He knows he has to do most of the legwork now"
"hands back, gets low and plays a shot in between a pull and a flick to deep square leg"
presents the full face of the bat to a top-pace delivery outside off. No run to cover
"that is an outrageous shot! This is only his 10th ball, but he looks like he's been playing for hours on this slow, tacky old pitch. Waits for the offcutter to arrive in his arc and then flicks to the midwicket boundary. Couple of bounces and away it goes"
"shortish and outside off, cuts to deep point. This one's the legcutter"
"112 kph, freakish offcutter, it pitches in a line close to sixth stump, on a good length, and then hurtles in at the batsman. Bounces too, hits him on the body, beating the inside edge"
"pushes out to try and block a good length offcutter outside off, but Southee doesn't allow him to get to the pitch and that means the ball can grip the pitch, turn sharply, bounce too, and hit the shoulder of this bat"
"this one's at full pace, angled into the body, Morris nudges to deep square leg"
"back of a length and outside off, Morris is not sure whether he should cut or stand up tall and drive. Plays something in between and is beaten"
"one-bounce four between long-on and deep midwicket. This is a length ball, doesn't move off the pitch, just sits up for the slog"
<b>beats him</b> with an offcutter that doesn't come in as sharply as Morris thinks. Defends inside the line and is lucky to have his off stump still standing
gets a single into the covers
mid-off is up and Morris goes over him. Good batting. He gets a length where he doesn't have to worry about the cut on the ball - half-volley - and hits through the line
"shortish and outside off, cuts to cover"
spots the line of the ball to be on leg stump and quickly gets in position for the paddle sweep. Even comes back for the second run. AB in high pressure. AB in cruise mode
"good length ball on off stump, de Villiers presses forward, then waits for the turn and hits with the turn through point"
"massive gamble from Morris to go for the reverse sweep, and it pays off. He hasn't looked perfect defending the ball, so it seems he's taken it upon himself to hit out of pressure. Takes the full, slow delivery on middle and swats it past point and short third man"
"that's high, it's not long, it's another chance for New Zealand and Boult takes the catch running in at long-off. Lovely bowling from Santner. He sensed Morris was going to go and slows it down. The batsman looks to hit against the turn, looking for long-on, the leading edge is taken as the ball dips and turns just enough. Good catch completes a good play"
"slow, short and outside off, de Villiers cuts to deep point"
shifts his weight back to flick a flatter delivery from outside off past short leg's left. Absolutely middled that so it can't be called a drop. Deflected off Broom's shoulder
"runs in from around the wicket for an offbreak at the base of off stump, Andile does well to keep the bat face straight"
tries to smash a short and wide slower ball over point but gets a thick outside edge to third man
"the emphasis he has put on playing the ball late is allowing de Villiers to bat like he is at another level. Here he waits on the shortish offcutter outside off and though it bounces a bit more, he is able to rind it and find a single behind point"
backs away and hammers a short and wide delivery straight to point. Prompts his captain to come down and have a chat
"outside edge but the wicketkeeper can't collect it. This is probably go down as <b>a drop</b>. The offcutter again, from around the stumps, angled into middle stump, squaring the batsman up who was pushing at the ball way earlier than it arrives. The nick balloons up to the left of Latham, who runs and dives, but just can't get underneath it"
"slow, short and outside off, de Villiers is able to one-up the extra bounce and pull it through square leg"
"shortish and outside off, cuts to deep point"
goes deep in his crease to cut a flatter delivery outside off to deep cover
"well bowled. He slows it down, tosses it up on middle and off. De Villiers looks to drive through cover, but with the ball dipping and turning, his outside edge is taken"
goes for a reverse sweep against a tossed up delivery on middle. Finds cover and then walks down to chat with his partner. Tense stuff.
lobs up well wide of off stump - he could have gotten an actual wide had he left it alone - but de Villiers flat-bats it down the ground to long-off
"tosses it up on middle, defends"
"full delivery outside off, de Villiers drives along the ground to deep point"
"slider, and the left-hander misreads it, going for the sweep. It goes on with the angle outside off, hits his pad and wanders off for a leg bye"
"gets into the sweep, and this ball is seriously full for the shot. Has to make the connection, to save himself from an lbw, and he does so. Single to deep square leg"
"misfield at short fine leg, on top of a poor ball down the leg side. Andile mistimes his sweep, but still he manages just enough to beat Taylor on his left"
"drifts it across the left-hander and Andile continues to sweep, on length, finding a single to deep square leg"
"tosses it up on off stump, he defends through cover to retain strike"
"shortish and into the body, de Villiers clips it behind square leg"
"shortish and on off stump, Andile lets it come on and dabs it behind third man, doing just what he needs to do at this situation, give the strike back to his captain"
"aims a yorker on off stump, from wide of the crease, with a round-arm action. De Villiers stays steady and flicks it through midwicket. Great composure"
"takes on the short ball, mistimes it though, and that helps him out with a man in the deep running to his right to try and catch it. Doesn't carry to Santner down there"
"back of a length and angled into middle stump, de Villiers backs away and punches to deep point"
"this is a low full toss, tailing into the batsman, Andile goes for a heave over midwicket, and misses"
"<b>massive turn</b> as Sodhi loops the ball up, asking for the drive. De Villiers goes for it, but with the ball dipping and turning sharply, he is easily beaten"
"goes for a reverse sweep, de Villiers goes for a reverse sweep, but doesn't make any connection. Sodhi goes up for an lbw decision, umpire Wilson says not out, but New Zealand go for a review. Impact might be outside off. No bat there. Williamson would have hoped the ball hit de Villiers on the full so that the ball will then have to be tracked as going on with the arm. No luck"
"that's a big hit in the context of the game! Andile goes for the reverse sweep, taking a length ball from leg stump and belts it over short third man. Must have picked the googly"
"another googly, this one shorter and outside off, Andile goes for a whip through midwicket and mis-hits it for a single"
"sweeps a flighted delivery from outside off past short fine leg, but deep square is there"
"pushes it through just outside off - the emphasis on not giving up boundaries - for the final ball of the over and Andile can only cut it to point. Good finish, Sodhi"
good bowling. He's keeping it away from AB's swing and the wide yorker works perfecly. The batsman is shaping to move to leg to free the arms but he has to reach out and jam it through the covers
"<b>what a beauty</b>. This is a full delivery, aiming for the base of off stump, tailing in as well. Andile clears his front leg looking for a boundary over long-on, but the ball sneaks under his swing and then cuts away to the wicketkeeper"
"slower ball, banished! Andile has the room to swing free. And he can get under it as well. Straight over long-off. Good area to hit. Massive hit in the context of the game"
"lands the yorker on middle, squeezes it out to cover for a quick single"
the wide yorker again at 136 kph and he beats de Villieres' slash to third man. Beats the inside edge
"smears a yorker well outside off through cover. He should be able to retain strike. Oh wait, he's going for a second run"
"length ball outside off - it's the offcutter - beats the big slog. Could have been a dot, but Latham fumbles behind the wicket"
"slower bouncer, de Villiers tries to get on top of it and swat it into the leg side. Misses. They collect a bye too. Oh, and the height is too much. Called wide by the square leg ump"
"carries over the long-on boundary! This is a mis-hit. His balance is all over the place, leaning back from the shot, so he gets a toe end and yet it carries all the way. Short boundaries for the win"
"nails the yorker just outside off, Andile tries to dig it out but is beaten for pace"
"goes full and straight, Andile tries to flick, gets a leg bye behind square leg"
"smacks it down the ground to win it for South Africa! Outstanding inning from de Villiers. Although to be honest, this might have been the easiest shot he's played on the night. Half-volley on off stump - Southee misses the yorker - and it's been biffed between the bowler and mid-off"
