"good line, tight to off stump and good carry through, but not express. Cook leaves alone, as you'd expect"
"a hint of outswing to the left-hander, again on a good full length. Cook lets it fizz by once more"
"ploughing a furrow outside off, a touch wider this time, and Cook still has no desire to put bat on ball. He'll leave it all session given half a chance"
"outside off once more, Cook waves it through, drawing the sting on this traditionally frantic first morning"
"and bat on ball this time. An ironic cheer as Cook pokes forward with utter conviction, playing the ball late and firm back down the wicket"
"an angled prod, and how often has Cook got off the mark with that shot? Soft hands, played late, squirted through the gully. That's how he rolls"
"oof, that's a good line! Pitching full, nibbling back and passing over the stumps. Well left in the end"
"good line again, nipping away from the left-hander this time"
"another good leave as Hazlewood finds another fine line outside off, nip off the pitch but dying through to the keeper. There's juice in the deck but it tends not to last in this heat"
"another good line, another good leave. This is compelling already"
"forward and blocked, that's a good ball, pitching middle and leg and nipping to off. Met with a full face"
forward and pushed to cover. A well negotiated over
"well bowled, a very full length, targetting the base of off, and forcing Cook into a late decision. Right under the eyes and pushed back to the bowler"
probing away at the off stump. No way through there
"on the back foot, probably for the first time this series. And defended with great ease back down the wicket"
"edged and gone! Cook had no choice but to play the line, but the ball kissed the edge with a hint of outswing, and comfortably pouched by Handscomb at first slip!"
"on the pads, the right-hander reaping the rewards of Starc's left-handed line, and tucking an easy flick off the hip to open his account"
"back of a length, solidly into line on the back foot"
plugging away on an off-stump line to the left hander. Stoneman defends
"outside off, no stroke this time"
"through to the keeper, a confident stride from Stoneman to leave the ball alone"
"played down off the hip, Handscomb at short leg is briefly in business, but can't get close to the half, quarter-chance"
blocked on the back foot. So much more time to think on back foot than front
"left alone with a waft of the willow. Stoneman is looking composed. And yes, that is clearly a kiss of death, but hey, it's true!"
"outside off, left well alone"
"driven beautifully! That is James Vince at his best! Right under the nose, full and tempting, Vince strides out to meet it, clobbers it along the deck, and that is England's first boundary of the Ashes"
outswinging yorker! Well played in the end as Vince jams down late and squirts a non-chance into the cordon
"full again, Starc targetting the yorker, and Vince once again sizes up the drive. Comes off the toe this time, but the intent is plain"
"short, but leg-sided. Vince flinches, but the ball is out of harm's way. And Starc had a word at the end of his followthrough. It probably ended in 'grrr'"
"full again, a bit of wobble on a tight line. Vince blocks and Starc is in his ear again. Feisty!"
"round the wicket, given Stoneman something to think about on the angle, and chiselled up to mid-off"
"pumped through the covers, very full from Hazlewood and Stoneman eases it into the gap. Good positive batting"
"squirted through backward point, good use of the angle from Stoneman, playing on the width"

"excellent from Stoneman, drawing the sting with composure"
"very full again, punched into the covers"
"outside off, and through to the keeper"
"outside off, through to the keeper once more with a hint of outswing"
"outside off, banged in a touch shorter, Vince drops his hands well and Paine - the recalled gloveman - has to bend to gather"
"inswing from Starc, and lots of oohs from the cordon there! Vince played it well in the end, but that was curling back in sharply by the time it reached the bat"
"down the leg side, that's a pleasing waft off the pads from Vince"
"back of a length, tight line, blocked"
"short but straight, Vince shapes to cut but it's too tight to the body to get it past point"
"on the back foot, a firm punch to cover"
fully forward and blocked
"a probing length, and determined defence"
"over the wicket, very solid line and length, and a pleasing tock of willow as Vince props forward"
very full and that was utterly <I>pinged</I> back down the pitch by Stoneman. A beautiful connection but Starc's left boot denies him any runs
"very full again, almost a full toss in fact, Stoneman flicks insouciantly across the line and connects well enough"
"banged in short, a nastier line but Stoneman watched it well. Not many short ones so far today. Full and fuller has been the norm today"
"down the leg side, a one-day wide"
"outside off, through to the keeper as Stoneman withdraws his bat"
"blocked once more, back down the pitch"
"banged in short outside off, left alone"
"that's a confident stroke! Back of a length from Cummins, and Vince strokes it sweetly into the covers. Doesn't go all the way, but used his height very well to crunch into the gap"
"round the wicket, met on the angle with a full face and pushed to mid-off"
"blocked down the ground, mid-on swoops round to gather"
"that's a more aggressive ball! Banged in short, and Stoneman stumbles back as he ducks, partly because the ball didn't actually get up much. Still, one for the cameras!"
on the pads and that's a fine flick into space at midwicket. Good intent
"driven, and that's another fine stroke from Stoneman. Not picking off the boundaries, but working the gaps with intent"
"punched back to the bowler, not quite to the pitch of the ball this time"
"forward and blocked, and nearly wriggles through the gap between bat and pad! No real alarm but the slips were excited"
"good inswinger from Hazlewood, well met with an inside-edged drive, and that's an angry shy in the followthrough! Aggro!"
"shot of the day! Overpitched, strode handsomely forward, head over the ball, crushed through the covers like a latterday Michael Vaughan! Vince is bang up for this ..."
"on the pads, tucked to the leg side, and into the rope! Two in two, and suddenly England are clicking up a gear as the hour mark approaches"
"wide outside off stump, Stoneman lets it go by"
solid in defence
"up on the toes, attempted punch off the back foot, inside-edged down into the crease"
"edged, but doesn't carry to third slip! Good soft hands from Stoneman, killing the pace"

through to the keeper once more
fully forward and blocked back down the pitch
defended once again
through to the keeper from back of a length
"on the hip, flicks down the leg side as Stoneman withdraws the bat on impact. There's no-one lurking at leg gully so no danger there"

"full outside off, angled across and left alone"
"on off stump, defended with a slightly open face and the ball runs towards gully"
gets nicely forward into this full delivery and drives to mid-off
"shorter in length, outside off, travels reasonably gently through to Paine"
"a short ball at 85mph/137kph, but comes pretty slowly off the surface and Stoneman has plenty of time to drop his hands"
"finishes the over with a full one outside off, left alone"
"short at off stump, swivels onto a pull and sends the ball behind square"
"short of a length on the hip, flicked down to long leg...not a million miles from the man who is now position behind square under the helmet"
"another good-looking drive from Vince, on the up, it wasn't a half volley, through the covers although not quite timed perfectly"
"huge appeal for a catch down the leg side! Aleem Dar not interested. Smith doesn't call the review. Stoneman went to flick it away. There was a noise, but came off his leg"
"good length at off stump, 88mph/141kph, confidently onto the front foot and finds mid-off"

"angled in at middle stump, pushed back to the bowler"
"this one gripped as well, was just outside off this time, tapped towards backward point a little uncertainly"

"this is nicely worked away off the stumps, uses his wrists to tuck it through square leg"

"this one turns, is a little shorter, defended on the back foot into midwicket"

"full again, punched back to the bowler who shapes to hurl the ball back but keeps hold of it"
"bangs in a short ball at off stump and this barely reaches Paine on the full as Stoneman sways out of the line, the delivery dying through to the keeper"
"pushes this down the leg side, Stoneman can't catch up with it. A tumbling take for Paine"
"back outside off, 91mph/146kph, and it's driven back to Starc who gets low in his follow through"

"full and straight, clipped off the stumps through the gap at midwicket and the three brings up both England's fifty and the fifty stand"
"short of a length at off stump, defended to the covers"

"short outside off, he steps back and cuts into point but only for the single"

"fuller, at the pads, flicked firmly into short leg"

"outside off, good turn and bounce, fended back down the pitch"
big turn from outside off. 'Beautiful Gary' says Tim Paine. He's right... he is

"fully forward, full face of the bat. Blocked"
"width, and a fraction back of a length. Turns and bounces as Vince punches off the back foot with hard hands. Can't quite squeeze past backward point"

"that is tremendous! Overpitched, and Stoneman leans into an on-drive, just waiting for the ball to arrive under his nose, and dinking it past mid-on. Shot"
"outside off, good leave in the end, as this one angles in and nips away"
left alone through to the keeper

"tight lines from Gary, no liberties on offer here"

did that go straight into short leg? Root flicked off the back foot and it scooted into Bancroft's shin guard on the full
defended coming forward
"round the wicket, short of a length, defended on the back foot"
"full outside off, left alone"
"fuller at off stump, angling in at Malan, defended"
low full toss which he aims to work to the leg side and gets a leading edge towards point
"a lot happens here! Malan goes for a pull, the ball takes him high on the back leg. An appeal for lbw (too high) and then the ball lobs towards short leg, but no bat involved and didn't reach him"
"another attempted pull, gets a bottom edge towards towards Paine"
leans forward on off stump and defends
"spins away outside off, left alone"
another one dangled outside off which Malan leaves alone
"nearly pushes at this outside off, on a teasing line and length, very late to withdraw the bat"
touch wider as he leaves alone
"straighter, on middle and leg, worked to the on side"
left alone outside off
"on off stump, defended"
"back of a length outside off, 87mph, through to the keeper"
"that one came back quite a lot! Just back of a length, perhaps came back more on the angle of the delivery as Root shouldered arms"
"full, defended on the front foot"
"nicely bowled, straightens a touch off the seam from a good length as Root gets behind the line"
defended down in front of the catching point
"dragged down short, a rare poor ball from Lyon today, Malan plays back then threads it through backward point with a well-placed cut"
"back on a full length, left alone"
"massive spin! Pitches around off stump, turns sharply away to beat Malan's edge by a long way"
"and again, this time Malan holds his bat inside the line as the ball spins away"
"a little shorter, defended on the back foot"
"full outside off, left alone"
"very full, dug out towards backward point"
this is taken on the rise by Paine as Root lets it go through...perhaps a touch more pace in the surface now?
"massive moment! Huge appeal for lbw, given not out by Erasmus, and Smith has called the <b>review</b>. Root falling across a full delivery, trying to play it too square, the bat got caught behind his pad. This looks very good. Smashing middle!"
gets the bouncer first up and takes a glancing blow on his back as he ducks
"good length at off stump from round the wicket, defended to mid-on"
left alone outside off
presses forward and defends
"slips this down the leg side, takes a tickle wide of Paine...can't call that a chance, really!"
"plays this late with an open face, dabs towards the second slip...risky"
"fuller, left alone"
"this one doesn't spin, instead it slides on and Malan holds his bat inside the line...natural variation, perhaps"
"full and straight, sweetly flicked wide of mid-on with a nice piece of timing to get off the mark"
"short of a length, deflected down in front of short leg"
"that's a handsome shot! Malan comes out of his shell, big stride forward, and drives on the up through the covers"
"angles back from wide outside off, through to the keeper"
slips out a low full toss which Malan misses out on as the drive picks out mid-off
"a short ball, down the leg side, Malan bails out of thoughts of a pull shot"
played off the back foot to mid-off
"fuller, at middle and leg, defended"
"on off stump, straightens a little, dabbed to the off side"
goodness me! Moeen has gone down on his back knee and fetched that from outside off with a slog-sweep which skims over the rope at deep midwicket. First six of the series
flicked off the pads through midwicket
left alone outside off
"full, outside off, Malan opts against having a drive at this one"
"gets forward with bat and pad together, defended to cover"
"threads another drive through the off side, gets a good stride in against a full delivery. Lovely shot"
"and now he goes through the leg side! Whippage, fetches it from full outside off and sends it wide of mid-on with plenty of bottom hand"
"switches to over the wicket, full at off stump, defended"
"drives at another full one that's a superb, one-handed diving save by Warner at mid-off"
"punches off the back foot, and it's the air for a while! Doesn't reach short cover"
left alone outside off
"quicker, touch flatter, on the stumps and defended"

"full outside off, can't quite beat mid-off to his right"
"full outside off, left alone"

left alone outside off
"plays forward with his bat in front of pad, defends wide of gully"
"jeepers! Moeen misses his cut at a shorter ball, so close to getting a bottom edge. Smith thought there was one. The ball was there for the stroke"
defended to the off side
"full at middle, leans well forward"
"dragged down short outside off, this time Moeen makes contact but doesn't get any timing or placement as he finds cover"
"angled across outside off, good length, Malan plays inside the line"
"nearly gets through! A yorker, with some late shape back in at Malan. Just manages to keep the ball out with the cue end"
"short of a length, bit of lift through to the keeper"
"back of a length, left alone"
"fuller, gets forward and drives to cover"
"bang! Dropped in short and Malan is quickly on a pull, hammered it wide of square leg"
defended off the stumps to the leg side
"nice spot, full outside off, brings Moeen stretching forward"
left alone outside off
"another ripper! How good has Lyon been today? So close to an edge, again, as this spins from around middle stump and defeats Moeen as he plays forward"
can leave this one alone as it spins again
"touch fuller, defended on the front foot. This has been some outstandingly classy offspin today"
"good start, full at off stump, defended...85mph"
"back of a length, straightens a touch on Malan who adjusts late to play to cover"
"huge appeal for lbw! And Smith calls the <B>review</b> again. This was very full. Unless he's hit it...he hasn't hit it, but it's actually sliding past leg stump. Not even clipping, so that's a review lost"
"leg-sided to start his day's work, but rising into a back-foot defence on the pads"
"on the pads, and tucked all the way to the rope! it just dribbled over in the end, but good aggressive intent from the outset"
"better line from Starc, curling away from an off-stump line, well left"
"outside off, left alone as the ball tails towards the cordon"
"full length, outswing, pushed back down the pitch"
"angled bat, defended into the off side"
"back of a length, a bit too short to threaten the edge. Moeen just hangs on the back foot and waits for the ball to hit the middle of his bat"
"crikey, that looked for all money as though Moeen had dollied a loose drive to mid-off, but he's tonked it up and over, a couple of bounces into the rope! Well, why not... if it's up there...!"
left alone this time. Circumspection to the fore
"leaning into the drive, punched to cover"
"clobbered! Floated up outside off stump, Malan planted his front peg and wafted his cover drive clean through the line. Huge intent already from this pair"
"fuller length, angled into the legs, and nudged to midwicket"
"banged in short, Moeen drops his hands and lets the ball hop through to the keeper"
"onto the front foot, pushed into the off side"
"back of a length, defended with a hop into line"
"fully forward, and smothered back down the pitch"
"back of a length, nibbling off the pitch a bit like an offcutter. Moeen waits on his shot and deflects with soft hands to gully"
"up on the toes, defending on the back foot under the eyeline"
"seeking the back-foot cover drive, but holding his intent in check. Tapped to cover"
"outside off, that's a nice area, making Moeen think about whether to play or leave. He elects for the latter"
squirted into the leg side
"banged in short, Moeen ducks"
"pokey and loose from Moeen! This one sticks in the pitch outside off, and Moeen has a dart, the ball scoots in the air into the off side, just short of short cover ... close!"
"lose full toss, Moeen eases it into the leg side"
push-driven into the covers. Starc aiming very full and at the base of the stumps
"short, Moeen swings into a languid pull, and is through the stroke before it reaches him. Not having everything his own way in the last couple of overs"
"big stride, meeting the pitch of the ball and letting it sail by"
pushed into the covers
"outside off, a languid leave"
"round the wicket, fuller length, attacking the pads. Malan squares up to defend"

"round the wicket first up, and blocked on a full length"

full length once again
ploughing a furrow outside off from round the wicket. Left once more
"a firm drive, with a pleasingly perpendicular bat. But straight to cover"
"outside off, no stroke offered"
"outside off, through to the keeper. The drive is on, but England are resisting temptation"
"good delivery, bending back into off stump from round the wicket. But another judicious leave. England have just throttled back a touch after a rapid start this morning. Content to bide their time now"
"forward and solidly blocked, head over the ball"
through to the keeper again
drawn forward on a middle and off line. No lateral movement in prospect whatsoever
"solid line, solid length, solid block. Australia are knocking at the door, but no-one's answering"
"round the wicket, lifting through to the keeper and left well alone"
"pulled, in the air... but short of square leg! Moeen was never really in position for the shot, and just as well, because he got no power into it either. Looped up, but well short of the man. In fact, it came right off the toe"
"banged in short, the first bouncer of the day, but it really didn't get up"
"outside off once again, no stroke offered"
"edged down into the ground, well short of the cordon. That's the lack of pace in the deck"
"short, and Malan hauls his neck out of harm's way. That had a little more venom, but all things are relative. England are looking pretty serene"
"right on the money straight away, round the wicket, straightening off the deck, defended"
"blocked to the leg side, hint of turn again"
"Moeen leans back, lining up the cut, but lets the ball turn past unhindered"
"wow, that is a snorter! Flight, drift, dip, bite, and fizzes just over the top of off! Moeen played back, which was his only error!"
"fully forward and smothered this time, that's more like it from Moeen"
tucked to leg for the fifty stand
"sharp delivery, lifting into the ribs, but deflected easily enough in the end, to midwicket"
"on the back foot, defended with a hop"
""
absolutely flogged off the front foot. But intercepted well at short cover
short and reasonably sharp. Malan limbos out of harm's way
through to the keeper
forward and blocked
"Moeen was so lining up the slog sweep, just as well he's not a poker player! Bails out in the end..."
"big turn and bounce outside off, left alone"
"shorter and wider, big spin, waiting for Moeen to gallop down and be stumped..."
left alone once again
"areas, Garry. Moeen keeps his counsel in a game of cat-and-mouse"

"outside off, through to the keeper."
"back of a length, and blocked down into the ground"
"another crashing drive, and another good intercept at short cover"
"round the wicket again, blocked on a good length back to the bowler"
"over the wicket, outside off, left alone as the ball angles across Malan's bows"
more sharp spin from an off-stump line. Moeen leaves alone
"this one spins less, but still too much to take out off stump. A tight leave from Moeen all the same"
"swept, and nailed! Clean through square leg. Bosh"
"up on the toes, cracked hard to point"
"over the wicket now from Lyon, Moeen adjusts his lines to push a defensive block to the off side"
stretching forward to block on middle and leg
punch-drive to mid-off
"outside off, Malan plays inside the line as the ball scoots across his bows"
"short, and that's well pulled, rolling the wrists on impact and gathered in the deep with a tumble by Starc, who has ripped his knee on his team-mate's spikes! Shaun Marsh was sliding in, and slashed Starc's trousers as they all but collided. Gosh, that could have been nastier than it was. Starc strides off to replace his strides..."
"outside off, no stroke offered, as Malan hauls his bat almost behind his back"
"fuller and straighter, right under the nose, and punched to mid-off"
"wow, that's a flashy drive! Nailed through the covers to keep England ticking along"
"over the wicket, spinning from outside leg, and flicked wristily through midwicket"
"straightens from middle and leg, blocked on the back foot to the off side"
"shorter, wider, oodles of time to place it through point. Malan cashes in on a rare loose one from Lyon to pick off his tenth four"
another snorter! Bursts off the pitch and explodes past the stumps and the edge. Malan would do well to lay bat on that!
"solidly forward this time. 'Love it, Garry, love it!' yelps Paine behind the stumps"
"another another beauty to finish! Dips late, spins hard, and fizzes past a tentative prod. Some absolute rippers in that over, but Malan survives, and in fact, is thriving"
tight lines from Cummins
"round the wicket, back of a length, tucked to the leg side with a hop"
"round the wicket, still charging in"
turned off the hip

"short of a length, he's back in the crease and nudges towards boot hill"
"short again, this time Malan connects cleanly with his pull, rolled his wrists over the ball, and finds long leg"
tucked off the pads wide of short leg
"hops back in the crease as Starc stays short-of-a-length, works this off his hip to leg gully"
"he's hammered that into short leg! Struck the pull very sweetly, clatters into Bancroft's shoulder, via the grille of the helmet. Malan checks he's okay. Shrugs it off"
"short outside off, Moeen will feel he misses out as he rocks back and cracks it to cover"
"floated up on off stump, defended"
"nice use of the crease, goes deep and then drives off the back foot but finds short cover again"
left alone outside off

"bunts this off his hip, slightly uppish, but lands safely short of deep square leg"
"short, wide down the leg side, lets it go through"
"short again, 88mph/141kph, and that's a brilliant pull from Malan, completely in control, gets over the ball, rolls his wrists, and sends it wide of deep square. Super placement"
"the line is outside leg this time, another pull but finds leg gully"
"this nearly goes wrong for Moeen, aiming a slog sweep and gets a toe end which loops in the air towards cover"
"in control this time, plays back to a short ball, pushes to cover"
"fuller, on middle and off, defended on the front foot"
"was this in the air to short leg? Moeen flicked it with strong wrists, couldn't get it to ground, hands on heads for the Australians. Not sure it carried. Very tough either way"
nudged off the pads behind square
defended past silly point who had just been brought in
"a flamboyant whippish pull from Moeen, off one leg, to deep square"

"the batsmen crossed, Moeen pulls this short ball along the ground to mid-on"
"another bouncer, over leg stump, Moeen ducks...the crowd have come alive with that wicket"

"over the wicket, a bouncer, Bairstow ducks his first ball"
pushed down the leg side
"short outside off, Moeen rocks back and drives wide of the short cover, the deeper man does the tidying up"
"double breakthrough! Moeen is given lbw. He's called for the <b>review</b> but this looks pretty good. Pitches around middle, straightens a fraction. Hits him low on the front pad. No bat involved. It's hitting the top of middle! (Umpire's call, so review retained)"
"round the wicket, another appeal as this spins in at Woakes but easily missing leg"
"on middle, defended"
whipped with bottom hand just wide of Lyon in his follow through...not sure it reached him on the full for a chance
"goes for the yorker, not far off! Bairstow keeps it out with the toe end...Australia sense a chance to keep England under 300"

"tight line, on middle and off, no width for Bairstow as he defends back to Starc"
"a wide yorker, dug out towards point"
"a good bouncer, 84mph/135kph, JB keeps his eyes on the ball as he says out of the line"
"it's a collapse now! Lovely bowling, but a poor shot from Woakes. Driving against the spin. Tossed up outside off from round the wicket, Woakes tries to go through covers, the ball turns back to hit off stump"

"another short ball, doesn't quite up as much and isn't too far from Broad's helmet as he ducks"

"width outside off and Bairstow latches on, leans back and cuts it strongly wide of gully"
"he played this well, got cramped for room as he aimed to play through gully again. Nipped back from short-of-a-length. Kept it down"

leans forward and pushes into the covers
strides forward then leaves alone outside off
"angled into leg stump, pushed down the on side of the pitch"
"a very nice drive from Broad, big stride forward and eases a full delivery through the covers"
"nearly through him! Driving at a full delivery, gets an inside edge into his back leg then ball flies wide of off stump"
"a half-hearted appeal for lbw as a back-of-a-length delivery nips back, takes Bairstow high on the pad...angling down leg as well"
"reward for Cummins! Tries to take him on, goes for the pull against a short delivery, gets a top edge which flies straight up in the air just behind square and Paine trots around for a simple catch"
"short on leg stump, Broad back in the crease and defends with a little hop"
"a beauty which skims past the outside edge, short of a length and pushed across Broad who is caught in the crease"
"short, down the leg side, that one doesn't pose much danger...a few words between Broad and Cummins"

"goes back to a slightly shorter ball, exposes his stumps, drives to cover"
"take that! Ball brings out an impressive sweep, connects very sweetly wide of deep square"
"and another! Lyon switches to over the wicket, drops it a touch short outside off, Ball elegantly rocks back and cracks it square through point"
"nearly through him this time! Driving against the spin, giving himself a little room, gets a thick inside half of the bat which dribbles towards mid-on"
"round the wicket, the bouncer at 84mph/135kph, Ball ducks"
"somehow he finds the gap! A well-directed short ball, Ball fends it away fine of gully...just one slip in place with the leg-side catchers"

hops inside the line of a short-of-a-length ball and clips it in the air behind square
"round the wicket, short outside off, left alone"

"a short ball at the chest, Anderson fends it round the corner short of a very vocal Warner at leg slip"
"deep in the crease, blocked down in front of short leg...not sure Anderson will get many in his half of the pitch"
"big swing! Anderson steps to the leg side and has a heave across the line of a short ball, the top edge flying over the keeper. I'm sure Warner will have a few thoughts on that"

"takes this on the arm, short around leg stump, fended down behind square"
"good bouncer, Broad has to hurry to get underneath it"

slips down the leg side
"smacked through the leg side, pulled from outside off through midwicket...Broad isn't blocking"
"300 up for England...Broad pulling again, gets it between deep square leg and deep midwicket. Bonus runs. Broad punches his bat"
"that's short and sharp, flies over Broad's back"
"short of a length, down the leg side, Anderson can't catch up with it"
"short of a length at the body, neatly played as he works it around the corner down to long leg"
swing and a miss at a short ball down the leg side...worth a full one outside off? Try and get a nick

"outside off, left alone with caution"
hops across the crease to let a gentle outswinger fly by
"fully into line, and defended back down the pitch. Better ball from Anderson, tight and threatening"
"angled defence, down through third man, and Cameron Bancroft has his first runs in Test cricket!"
tucked into the leg side
"threre's the inswinger, but it starts on the wrong line and Bancroft clips it through backward square. A confident start to his Test career"
solidly into line to block back down the pitch

"angled into the right-hander's pads, Bancroft plays into the leg-side, gathered at mid-on"

"flipped out to deep midwicket, up on the points of his toes to work Anderson off middle and off"
"my goodness, that's a tough ball to play, angled across the left-hander, bouncing and straightening and just missing the edge. This wicket is definitely quicker now"
"full length again, blocked"
through to the keeper once more

"tighter to the stumps, blocked tentatively on the back foot"
through to the keeper
"on the pads, worked to the leg side"

"curling onto a good length outside off, and blocked"
"tight line, left alone outside off"
"back of a length and an attempted pull. Looked good, but lacked impact"
"a touch too short, short-arm-pulled round the corner, a good take by Bairstow as the shy comes in from the deep"
"crikey, that looked close, and he must have nicked it, because Broad barely appealed! Pushed right back into the crease, pinned to the crease, it would have been stone dead!"
"stabbed back down the track, on the front foot with pre-determined intent. Broad half-gathers in his followthrough"
"on the back foot, tapped to cover, another single as he pierces the gap"
"squirted off the hip, out through square leg. Good contact"
dangle-batted defence outside off stump
"tossed up full and wide, Warner spanks a drive into the covers"

"back of a length, Smith steps back to flick to leg"
tucked off the toes through square leg and he's off the mark
"round the wicket, punched off the back foot. That's the end of a very successful over"

"outside off, pushed to the covers"
goes back and nudges a length delivery into short leg on the bounce

"length angled in to off stump, Warner gets well forward"

"even fuller, clipped off his toes and finds midwicket again"
"just a hint of width and that's a lovely late cut, gets it fine of short third man"
nudged off the pads into square leg

"full outside off, 89mph/143kph, left alone"
"dragged down short outside off, pulled out to deep square leg"
"round the wicket, back of a length, smart batting as he opens the face and places into point"
"that's huge! Ball has got a key wicket. Short of a length, angled in at Warner who tries to pull through the leg side, can't keep the ball down and he finds Malan at short midwicket - taken with a bit of a juggle, relief on Malan's face"
"what a lovely start, punches a short-of-a-length ball outside off through point"
"back of a length, tucked into the leg side"

"straighter, full at middle, defended towards mid-off where Broad makes a sprawling stop"
"poor ball, short and wide, Handscomb square cuts in front of point...the ball slows up as it reaches the rope and it gets flicked by Vince but they can run four"

"on the pads, tucked to the leg side"
"outside off this time, blotted out to point"
"deep in the crease, and blocked back to the bowler"
"tight line outside off, nothing spectacular. Anderson goes a touch wider on the crease but the same defensive result"
huge appeal! Handscomb is so far back in his crease as Anderson fires in the yorker. Was that missing leg? England don't think so and <B>review</B>! There's no inside-edge ... this could be a critical moment of the Test. And it is smashing leg stump!
"jeepers, that's a good welcome to the crease, a touch of movement outside off stump, and Marsh does well not to be drawn in. A fine over"
"on the back foot, defended"
coming down the wicket with aggressive intent
"good bowling! This one slides straight on, and Smith is playing for the turn. Nearly grazes the edge"
solid stride forward to block
"flicked out to midwicket, a good stretching stop"

"back of a length, outside off, dabbed to point"
"outside off, curling away from the left-hander. Left alone"
"crunched through the covers, that's a lovely strike. Waited for the ball to arrive and didn't over-hit it"

"slower and loopier through the air, round the wicket, left alone"
"fuller length, tighter to off stump. Blocked"
leaning onto the front foot
"tossed up, tempting Marsh with extra flight. A silly mid-off joins the party"
forward and squeezed through the gully
"full and straight, tucked to short midwicket"
"attacking, aggressive line from Anderson, targetting the stumps, but every ball subtlely different. This one nips back into the pads"
"wider on the crease, Smith plays with a closed bat-face to defend"
worked from middle and leg to short midwicket
flicked to the leg side once again. Time to swing it the other way now?
"attempts the variation, but it comes out as a full toss. Clipped hard but straight to midwicket. A let off"
leaning forward to defend
angled block
slow and loopy like a hand grenade. Defended to cover
"on the pads, Root crowding the bat on the off side"
stands tall on the back foot to defend
flicked to mid-on. Another maiden

"banged in short, no stroke offered"
tapped round the corner to backward square
forward and blocked to mid-off
"case in point, another ball attacking the top of off, but this one loops down the pitch, almost gathering pace from back of a length. Marsh has to be on his mettle to block it out"
"crunched on the up to point, a smart sliding stop from Vince"
"wider of off stump, left alone this time"
outside off and through to the keeper
ploughing away outside off and through to the keeper again
"fuller length, wider line, Smith shapes to drive and lets it go"
tucked off the hip for another single
"a big stride down to meet the ball, drilled down to long-on"

ploughing away
Marsh is watchful as Moeen targets his off stump
tapped to the off side
big stride forward to block once more
"outside off, Broad ploughing away on a fourth-stump line, making Smith come to meet him if he wants any runs"
"banged in short, Smith ducks"
"fuller length, demanding a stroke. Dead-batted out to the off side"
"Broad rolls his fingers on this one, through to the keeper"
"short, and a bit wide. Smith isn't interested in that one"
defended once again
"ooh, hello, Marsh is bored of being stuck to his crease, and tries to advance into a drive. Not this time ..."
""
"advancing again, this time for a clip to leg"
worked with an open face through gully
solidly blocked
there's the loose drive! Marsh advances  but doesn't connect properly ... the ball skews out to gully
"banged out on a good length, wide of off stump"
"squirted into the off side, on the back foot, covering the stumps"
well played. Steps across the crease as Broad comes too straight. Speared gloriously through mid-on
pulled across the crease to defend to the leg side
"wider outside off stump, no stroke this time"
left alone once again
"width outside off stump, chopped through point"
"fully forward, ludicrous mid-off gathers in one hand"
defended to the off side
blocked to cover
"clipped on the up to mid-on, looking for the single, but it's not there"
"shorter and wider, and that's good patience from Marsh, waiting for the bad ball and cutting firmly to the edge of the rope. A good diving stop to save the four"
"and there's <b>review</b> straightaway as Marsh pads up to Broad who is round the wicket. Not sure it's done quite enough. It's hit the back leg, doesn't matter where it's hit of course, and it's missing off stump so England lose that one. Not Root's best"
"outside off, left alone"
defended from off stump into midwicket
"full, pushed down the leg side, Marsh can't catch up with it"
gets forward and pushes up to mid-off
"back of a length outside off, comes back with the angle, through to the keeper"
edged! But dies in front of slip. Pushing forward at a reasonably wide delivery which didn't spin

"full at the pads, clipped firmly to midwicket"
"full at off stump, delivered from quite wide, clipped firmly to mid-on"

"slips onto the pads and that's clipped away wide of leg slip, back-to-back boundaries for the captain"
pushed off the back foot into the off side

flicked with a bit of a flourish from outside off to midwicket
pushes his bat in front of his pad as he defends
"shorter, allows him to go onto the back foot and play to mid-on"

"flatter, clipped into the leg side"

"solidly onto the front foot, dragged down to meet the pitch of the ball"
a yawning leave outside off stump to finish the over
"outside off, back of a length, Anderson hasn't quite got his length right this morning. Punched firmly to the cover sweeper"

"another one in the slot from Anderson, speared in to Marsh's toes"

"outside off, tapped to cover, Smith settles for the single"

"short, wide outside off, left alone"
"that's brilliantly played, leans back and upper cuts a short ball over backward point down to third man"

"on the legs, Smith keeps the strike, Australia trail by 5..."
"that was an utter pie from Moeen, a genuine long hop, but Stoneman under the lid is perfectly placed to intercept with his knees. That would have hurt but for the padding"
"too short again, pumped into the off side this time"
"leaning forward, blocked to the off side"

"outside off, gathered at short third man. Smith is boshing it, but keeps hitting the field"
"short and Smith attempts the limbo-glance, but doesn't connect. He's cross with himself"

Lyon survives with ease
"worked off the pads, lots of leg-side freebies sneaking in now"
defended
"tucked off the face of the bat, and that is pocketed at leg slip! Just trying to work it around the corner and couldn't keep it down. Neat catch"
"and there's an appeal! But it's a false alarm. Slides down the leg side, Cook looks to flick it away. You can feel the excitement"

"there we go, pushes this up fuller outside off, left alone"
"hooked to long leg! Oh boy, what has Cook done there?! Maybe he doesn't want to go full. A well-directed short ball, over middle and leg, Cook can't get over the ball was he hooks, it's a big top edge and superbly held on the boundary by Starc. Ran around and got down low to grab it. A poor match for the former captain"

stabbed through the covers for another simple single
"well flighted, defended on the crease"
stretching forward and pushed to the cover ring. 'Beautiful Garry!' is the cry!
got him! The overspin does the trick as Stoneman is suckered by the one that slides a touch straighter. Grazes the edge and scooped low at slip! Beautiful indeed from the Goat. Extra oats for him tonight!

"short of a length at off stump, defended on the back foot"
cuts in front of square without much timing

"angled into the pads, clipped through midwicket and that's his fifty...about a third of what England need from him"
"he won't go further than fifty! Full, straight, nips back off the seam, and given by Aleem Dar. Root ponders for an age then decides against the review. Almost a carbon copy of the first innings. Resume those conversion-rate debates. Is that the decisive blow of this Test. Replay shows it was three reds"

leans forward and defends

an aggressive flog through point
"onto the front foot, looking to be forceful through the covers"
"back of a length, Moeen hops into line and sneaks the single to leg"

"a false stroke from Bairstow! This one nipped the other way off the seam, and Bairstow was lured into a flat-footed stab. A momentary lapse of concentration"

solidly onto the front foot and pushed to cover
"massive turn, and Paine whips off the bails! This one is <strong>going upstairs</strong> for the stumping...Moeen's toe is on the line, but is there anything behind it? I don't think there is. ... this is a big call. The stump cam implies there might be a millimetre in it, but I think there'll be a riot if this isn't given. <strong>The decision is OUT!</strong>"
"round the wicket, bat and pad together to defend"

"stays round the wicket, short of a length, shoveled into the leg side"

"gets right across inside the line of this short ball, misses his flick and it carries over middle stump"
"goes for the full one, Paine is up for the catch! Smith has called the <B>review</b>. Starc didn't appeal. Full outside off, Broad jabs the bat down. Think there's a Hot Spot on this! A white speck as the ball passes the bat. Paine was spot on. He's had a super session."

"snorter. That's the spot for Anderson. Tight to off stump, nipping away, climbing past the end"
"wider line, left alone"
"outswing again, but too wide to lure a stroke"

"left alone outside off stump, and through to the keeper"
"attacking the stumps on the angle, but that's neatly clipped by Bancroft, behind square where Ball takes a tumble at fine leg in attempting the intercept. Got to be careful on this sandy outfield... We all remember Simon Jones..."

"on the pads, and worked round the corner"
"attacking angle into the right-hander, Bancroft plays it late, right under the eyes. Good defence"

"on the back foot, and blocked"
"clipped off the pads, and Warner finds the gap at square leg"
