"pitching outside leg, spinning way down leg for a wide"
"shorter on middle and leg, he tries to give room but bunts it back to the bowler"
"wrong un, he drives and <strong>times this so well past cover!</strong> What a shot. It beats the man at deep long off"
"<strong>given out LBW!</strong> Maxwell<strong> reviews </strong>after a long discussion with Short. It pitches on middle, he tries to whip to leg, it beats the inside edge. Definitely no bat. Ball tracking says it pitched in line, and spinning down leg! Missing leg. Maxwell survives. Great review."
"<strong>LBW!</strong> Again a long discussion and Short <strong>reviews!</strong> He tried to sweep, Krunal from around the wicket, it pitched in line, no bat involved. Ball tracking says it was in line, hit in line and was hitting! They lose the review this time. That was plumb."
"<strong>LBW!</strong> Given out sweeping! He's on a hat-trick! First ball sweep shot, this was tossed up outside off from around the wicket, pitches outside, he tries to sweep, it slides on and hits the back leg, and Gerard Abood says it hit in line with off!"
"around the wicket, pitching on middle, he turns this with the spin to square leg"
"tossed up outside off, he pushes off the front foot to cover"
"shorter length, he's back and punching to long off"
<strong>beaten</strong> this spins sharply past the edge as he drives
"a tad short, making him reach outside the off stump. Carey chops it in front of point"
"loops it up onto off stump, Maxwell drives to extra cover"
"seems like a top spinner, going through flat on off stump and not spinning a great deal. Maxwell goes back, perhaps wondering if he can cut it, but then has to block down the pitch"
"good length, spinning into him, Maxwell tries to pull, but it doesn't rise as much as he wants"
hits to long off. Probably picks the googly
"loads up a big old sweep, dragging a tossed up ball from way outside off away to deep square leg"
"goes short, the ball rising up to his chest. Carey gets up on tiptoe and nudges it to short midwicket"
"looks for the clip through midwicket again, but he's underestimating Khaleel's bounce. In the end, the ball lobs off his thigh and into Khaleel's followthrough"
helps the back of a length delivery on off stump away to deep square leg. Short-arm pull done right
"<b>top-edge</b>! It can happen, with the left-armer's bouncer going across the right-hander, and him going hard at a ball rising above his shoulder. Not easy to get on top of it to muscle it through leg. But you do have every chance of pinging a boundary right behind you"
"goes for the pull, but here, Khaleel is able to sneak under the bat and through to the keeper"
"shortish and outside off, dabs it in front of point"
"seam-up delivery, I think, on a good length on off stump. And Maxwell knocks it back to long-on"
that's beautiful work from Carey. Waits for the tossed up slower ball to arrive and then hits it smoothly over the field at cover.
"quicker delivery, hoping to catch the batsman cutting just because the length is short. But Carey is alive to the threat it poses to the stumps and deflects the ball to point"
reaches out in front of him to sweep a well tossed up delivery to deep square leg. Lovely variations in flight from Kuldeep
"tries to make room to crash the ball through the covers, but Kuldeep follows him, and bowls so very slow too, refusing an antsy batsman any pace to work with"
doesn't pick the googly this time as a good length ball on middle and leg spins away and takes the leading edge as he tries to flick it
"taken at long-on! Maxwell clears his front leg and tries to launch the ball into orbit. And really, this ball is there to be hit, pitched short of a length and not even pretending as if it'd turn. The batsman makes room, hits as hard as he can, but he can't clear the straight field. Simple catch to Rohit, who makes up for the earlier drop"
sweeps the fuller delivery outside off to deep midwicket
whips the flatter delivery on middle through midwicket
"<b>over cover</b>! Insane timing. Carey does nothing more than extend his hands, and a straight bat. And the full toss outside off just disappears to the boundary"
"works it down to long-on, dragging it from outside off"
"good length on off stump, taps to point, and runs"
back of a length and strays too far outside off for the umpire's liking
"goes round the wicket for a length ball outside off, Lynn slides it away to deep point"
"full on off stump, Carey dinks it down the pitch and Khaleel doesn't let it go past him on his left"
"low full toss outside off, steers it to the boundary at cover. Simple timing again. Has a solid base. Keeps his eye on the ball. Plays as it's said in the text book"
hacks away a back of a length delivery from outside off to deep midwicket
"looks like the slower ball, banged into the middle of the pitch. The 118 kph delivery is pushed to extra cover"
"offcutter again, but in trying to play hide and seek with Lynn, he slants this ball way too wide outside off"
"gets into the pull shot a little too early and only gets a toe-end on this short ball outside off. Good over from the left-arm quick. Excellent plan to change the pace and pull his length back against the big-hitting Lynn. Denies him that big, baseball swing"
"full and outside off, Lynn drives to the left of long-off and pinches a second run"
"slips down leg as Lynn misses his sweep shot, the bat coming down a little too late to catch up with the ball"
pushes the flatter delivery on leg stump to long-on
"beautiful shot, over cover! The left-armer coming round the wicket drifts the ball across the left-hander. And he just plants his foot forward and extends the arms. Breathtaking clarity."
"knows the bowler will go short and wicket to wicket, so he is ready with a reverse swat, taking the ball off middle stump and smuggling it to the third man boundary"
"finds deep midwicket! It's the tossed up delivery. It's on middle. It's there for the sweep shot and Carey's been timing them like nobody's business. Except here, as well as he hits it, he can only find Kohli on the boundary"
nudges it through vacant square leg
"takes the pace off and pitches it short as well. Stoinis can't adjust to the lack of pace. And he doesn't have any room to free the arms. Tries to flick, but it lobs off his body towards where silly point would have been"
"looks like a legcutter, which Lynn smashes it deep point. Stands tall and flat bats it with venom"
"back of a length on off stump, Stoinis gets an outside edge to point"
lashes it to the point boundary. Decent plan to bowl slow at a hard-hitter of the ball. So too is the length - short on these big Aussie grounds can be useful - but there is too much room on it and Lynn takes full toll
"targets the base of off stump, Lynn skews it away for a single at long-off"
"holds his shape, even though it seems like he only just picks the slower ball, and taps it to the right of Bhuvi for a single"
"back of a length and outside off, Stoinis punches to the sweeper"
"<b>mix-up, direct hit, Lynn's gone</b>. Oooh, this is silly, silly stuff. Stoinis starts it all by dabbing the ball gently towards point and wants a single. Lynn isn't keen on it at first but then just as he commits to it, Stoinis is haring back into his crease, leaving him no choice but to race back to the bowler's end. But Bumrah is on the balll, he takes aim and he throws down the stumps. Super stuff"
"another slower ball, the offcutter kicking up off the pitch and unsettling Stoinis, who nicks the ball almost onto his stumps"
"short and outside off, he slaps it to deep point"
nails the yorker on middle and Coulter-Nile is awake to it's considerable threat. Single towards mid-on
slices the full toss on and around off stump to the point boundary
"yorker on middle and leg, Coulter-Nile works it to deep midwicket"
"looks for the blockhole again, Coulter-Nile hits it down the ground to long-on"
good length and outside off - but there's no pace in it. Stoinis blocks to point for a single
legcutter flies away off the outside edge. Tiny bit of room for Coulter-Nile to free the arms and he latches onto it well enough to get four over point
pin-point yorker on off stump and Coulter-Nile is only just able to dig it out
"carves the length ball to the left of long-off. Bhuvi misses his mark and Coulter-Nile clears his front leg and sends it racing away across the SCG turf, singeing the grass"
"bouncer! Hoicks it away over midwicket! And then looks at the bottom of the bat! Honestly, if it travels the distance on an Aussie ground, that bat must be magic"
sends it to long-on
"slower ball outside off, Coulter-Nile prepares to flat bat it over the bowler's head but the lack of pace makes him drag it to long-on"
"back of a length slower ball targeting the wide line, Stoinis thumps it down the ground to long-off"
heaves the short ball out to long-on! They want a second run. It's risky. Coulter-Nile dives. Has he made it? <b>The third umpire needs to check this</b> Yes! He has. And it's all because of a sensational dive! Full-length. Perfectly timed. And he gets to his crease in the time it takes for Bumrah to collect the ball and break the stumps
loses his shape as he goes for a slog and the dipping slower ball outside off wanders away to the keeper
"goes for the pull, gets an inside edge, and slips away to the left of the diving fine leg fielder. Hm, 164 then, that's a pretty decent total all considered."
"142kph, good length, hint of swing in to off, runs off the edge along the ground to third man"
"146kph, good length outside off, he tried to launch this with a cross bat, chops it off the bottom edge into the pitch"

"145kph, good length angled into middle, he works this with the angle to midwicket"

"138kph, good length into leg stump, cramping him, he works to square midwicket"
"125kph slower ball, good length on middle, he defends on the front foot to cover-point"
"good length outside off, he drags it off the bottom half of the bat to midwicket"
"steps back and across early and <strong>pulls behind square!</strong> Great batting, he moved early, created the shorter length and pulled it fine of the man at deep square"
"good length on off, he defends with soft hands close into the off side, and an easy one is run. Great batting"
"144kph, swinging wide of off, he flashes and misses but it's called wide by Paul Wilson"

"145kph, back of a length into middle, he turns it with the angle to midwicket"
"145kph, tailing into the pads, full, he misses out trying to whip it away, it was going way down leg so no shout for LBW"
"139kph bouncer, he tries to pull hard but it comes off a touch slower than he expected"
<strong>cracking off drive!</strong> This was a half-volley and he leaned into the drive and placed it perfectly past mid off
angled down the leg side and rightly called wide
short into the hip and he pulls with the angle up and <strong>over fine leg into the crowd!</strong> What a shot. Too easy for Sharma
"137kph, good length, fourth stump, he defends with soft hands running into the gully"
"126kph, good length, middle and leg, he defends on the front foot"
"116kph, slower ball bouncer, he waits and pulls to deep square leg"
"slower ball, back of a length, he hammers a slog sweep over deep midwicket into the crowd again! Wow!"
slower ball again and driven on the up straight of cover! Superb batting from Shikhar Dhawan. He has clobbered this on the rise into the gap
"128kph, good length into leg stump, he turns neatly off the front foot to midwicket"
"crunch! A front foot pull over long on! Just a fraction short at 126kph, Rohit read it and flat batted this over long on and it goes all the way"
"127kph, good length on off, he turns with soft hands to square leg for a single"
slower ball full toss that slipped out way wide. It didn't land on the pitch
"launched over square leg way back into the stands! My goodness! Again he drops short on the hip and he massacres this pull shot and it goes way, way, way back into the crowd!"
"102kph slower ball, good length, he sits waits and slaps it back over the bowler's head, three bounces over the rope!"
"pulled over mid on and it lands just short of the rope! Wow! This was 129kph, short and way wide, he stands up and hammers a pull flat and straight over mid on. It was only metres short of another six!"
"129kph, good length slower ball on off, he defends with soft hands into the off side for a simple one"
"driven through cover! 128kph slower ball, half-volley, he picks it, waits and places this inside out past cover and it flies to the rope. What batting this is"
"full and straight, 145kph, into middle, did it hit pad before bat? Umpire says not out to the shout. Australia <strong>review</strong>. It was tailing in, definitely hit pad first. Ball tracking says it's hitting leg stump! Out <b>LBW!</b>. Great review from Finch. Great work from Starc"

"tossed up leg break, very full, driven back to the bowler"

"flipper, fired into off, he defends on the front foot"
"<strong>bowled him!</strong> This was fired in at 91kph, good length, Sharma played back and tried to work against the line through square leg, it skidded on off the surface, hurried him, inside edge onto pad and then onto the stumps!"
"tossed up outside off, he drives straight to cover"
"135kph, good length, he walks a pace down to the line and whips this sumptuously wide of mid on for two. What a way to get off the mark!"
"132kph, short ball, he's pulling but gets it off the toes of the bat and rolls it around to deep fine leg"
"136kph, good length, fourth stump line, checks a drive to cover"
"<strong>pulled over deep square!</strong> 132kph, back of a length, he picked up the length so quick, pulled it off the bottom of the bat but he hit it hard enough to sail high over the man in the deep at square leg!"

"stays back in his crease against the googly, picking the variation, waiting for it to turn into him, and them flicks it sweetly to deep midwicket"

"mis-hits it over point! Kohli is trying to make room, trying to one-up Maxwell who has been trying to deny that. The ball drifts away from him just enough to make him lose his shape"
turns the length ball on middle through square leg
"shortish and outside off, he stands tall and pulls it through midwicket"
"caught at long-off! He's been trying to dominate the spinners, trying to put them off their lengths by charging at them, or reverse sweeping them. But it never looked like coming off. And this time, he's even found the fielder. A trip down the pitch and a desperate slash is taken very very easily by Coulter-Nile"
"caught behind! This is poor. He needs pace to play a shot like this - the pull to the fine leg boundary - but that's the one thing Tye denies. The slower bouncer outside leg stump sneaks up on Pant, rising up at him, lobbing up off his glove and settling in Carey's waiting hands. Australia, without anyone noticing, are getting on a bit of a roll"
