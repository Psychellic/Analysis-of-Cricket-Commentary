"pitched on a length, de Kock watches it go by"
"short and wide, de Kock cuts but only finds the man at point"
"short again, some width and de Kock tries to slice it to third man, misses altogether"
"full, driven to mid-on"
"straighter, whipped to the onside for South Africa's first runs of the day"
"Amla leans into an overpitched delivery that clears the offside field, and runs two off his first ball. Decent first over from Cottrell."
"great delivery. Pitched on a length and moved away from the batsman, who, according to the umpire, edged it to the keeper, who takes an excellent one handed diving catch. de Kock has reviewed straightaway though, and it shows the ball came off his arm instead. <b>Decision reversed</b>."
"shorter, wider, eased into the covers"
"too straight this time, and glanced away to square leg. Amla to face Roach for the first time now"
"good ball first up to Amla, quick and wicket-to-wicket. Amla blocks"
"shorter, and came back into Amla, who just about fends it off"
defended into the slips. One from an excellent over.
defended
"short but de Kock pounced on it. Didn't nearly have the zip it required to trouble de Kock, who managed to clear the infield without quite finding perfect timing on it. It was a long chase for the fielder, and they run three."
"a tempting half-volley for Amla, who leans into it effortlessly, guiding the ball past point for South Africa's first boundary of the morning"
closer to yorker length this time. Amla tries the same shot but it goes to a fielder on this occasion.
"this is too easy for West Indies! Amla got done by a bit of <strong>extra pace and bounce</strong>. Far too late rising with the ball to meet the bounce. It rushed the batsman, clipping him on the gloves and spooning to the slip fielder. Comfortable catch, and <strong>South Africa lose their first</strong>."
"short, fended off. Great start for the West Indies, this"
dragged much too far down the legside
"full, but too close to drive, as de Kock finds out, getting an inside edge that comes back into his pads"
guided to the onside to turn over the strike
"Markram drove somewhat uppishly, but well clear of the mid-on fielder"
no timing on it as its driven into the offside
fuller and flicked to midwicket
"<strong>lovely shot</strong>, this may get Markram going. Full and slightly wide of the stumps. Markram steps into it, and transfers his weight beautifully through the ball, and just evades a diving Holder"
short and de Kock attacks once more. In the air for slightly longer than perhaps planned but never a catch candidate
"this short ball troubled de Kock more. This one rose and got big on him, and the fend off from the left-handed scooped straight into the air. Much quicker, and de Kock wears an expression of alarm and surprise"
driven elegantly to mid-off. Wanted to get it either side of him
in the air again as de Kock square cuts. A diving Roach at the boundary saves two runs
dragged down slightly. Half-hearted lbw appeal
"this is what de Kock is so good at! width at a comfortable pace, and the batsman latches on to it. Whipped through point and races for four. Productive over for South Africa for a change."
"short, blocked"
"stump-to-stump line, defended stoutly"
"another bouncer, but not well-directed enough to worry the batsman, sails over comfortably"
guided to the onside as Markram gets off strike
driven to extra cover
driven straight down for another couple. Three from a tight over
"and <strong>Cottrell snares another one</strong>! Targeting Markram with the short ball, into his ribs. The batsman tamely flicks it, trying to run it down to fine leg. Gets a slight tickle on to it instead, which a diving keeper pouches. Markram barely even waits for the decision, walking off in disgust"
"starts off with a hostile bouncer to the Proteas' skipper, who stays low"
"tight line, du Plessis defends"
"rose on him sharply,. The batsman thought about a quick single, but de Kock was wisely sent back"
"looks to hamstring the batsman, no opportunity whatsoever to free his arms. West Indies bowling to a plan, and executing brilliantly"
wicket maiden comes to an end as du Plessis blocks
slightly more room and run down third man.
"rising short ball, but outside off stump so du Plessis can afford to shoulder arms"
"another short ball, rears from the ground and du Plessis wants nothing to do with it again"
