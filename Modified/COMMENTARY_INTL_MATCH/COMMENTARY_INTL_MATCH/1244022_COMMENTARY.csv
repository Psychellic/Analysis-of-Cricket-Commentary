Ambris just appeared to over-balance as he was looking to work this away. Doesn't seem to have taken the edge, so the question could only be now about where it pitched, and whether it may have done too much.

He's beaten, and then da Silva does well to whip the bails just off even as Tamim's back leg fails to drag back into the crease. If only West Indies had a few more runs to play with..."

Stops a bit on Shakib, who shapes to cut, but realises the ball has spun back in and cramped him for room. He ends up playing it with the face of the bat...on to his stumps. Muted celebrations from the West Indies camp. They may go on to lose this, but they may have found a star in the making in the young left-arm spinner"
