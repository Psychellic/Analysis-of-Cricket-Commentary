"very full on fourth stump line at 142 kph, Shahzad pokes at it with little footwork as the ball dribbles toward point."
<strong>bowled him. Or has he! They're checking the front foot with the third umpire. </strong> It was very full on the stumps. Starc could see off the previous ball that Shahzad's footwork wasn't engaged this early and he got this one to swing in but this time on the middle stump line. Shahzad was late trying to stab it out playing slightly across the line. The front foot is deemed to be just okay in the end. Super start for Starc.

"shin high full toss going down the leg side, Zazai misses out on a freebie with a belated flick as the ball hits the pad straps on the way through to the keeper."

"bouncer, Rahmat is late on the hook and skies one to midwicket, caught on the ring but with a free hit they are able to swap strike as Coulter-Nile takes the grab shuffling left."
"<b>ooooooohhhh big blow to nab the big bashing lefty!</b> Another victim down to no footwork. Cummins angled this across on a good to full length, not nearly full enough to drive especially with his front foot going nowhere towards the ball, Zazai gets a healthy edge easily snapped up by Carey."

"good length ball on the stumps, Rahmat defends with a touch more footwork than his peers."
"good length ball, some bite off the pitch as a touch of extra bounce climbs on Rahmat defending on the front foot. The ball takes the shoulder of the bat but he's able to keep it down with soft hands. Eventful start by Australia's new-ball pair!"
"overpitched on off going for the yorker, Shahidi just gently leans forward and stabs this out through extra cover."
responds with a bouncer on the stumps. Shahidi ducks animatedly.

"fullish but very wide outside off, <b>where is the footwork from anyone!</b> Shahidi drives with his arms outside off, beaten for pace. Afghanistan looking nervy still."
"attempted yorker, strays on the legs and Shahidi flicks it off his feet to long leg Zampa."
"short of a length on the stumps, knocked down off the back foot into midwicket."
good length ball going down leg. Big noise as it passes through. Sounded and looked like it was clearly off the pads. Finch isn't sold by Carey enough to go for the review. Replay shows clearly went off the thigh guard/hip of Rahmat.

"<b>top edge flies over the keeper</b> and goes into the boundary. Well directed bumper, rising up to target his face and he went to pull it, but the ball got big on him. Draws the edge but it lands in the safest spot there is. No fielder behind the keeper once you've left your school days behind"

"too short, he clears his front leg, rocks back and pulls it hard. There's protection at deep square though"
"<b>beautifully done by Zampa</b>. That is a proper legspinner's dismissal. Tossed up and getting some drift across, the length draws him well forward.

Smith takes a step left before diving full extension to knock it down with his left hand. Nabi set off without hesitation believing he placed it wide enough for a safe run. But Smith, the puma in the ring! Gulbadin never left more than a few yards from the non-striker's end seeing Smith's effort but Nabi is so far down that Smith has time to get up off his knees and deliver a firm throw to Carey at head height on his way to the stumps and knocks the bails off with Nabi three yards short scampering back in vain."

"<b>snorter from Starc</b> but Najibullah has got to <b>fifty</b> from it. That was a pacy bouncer, homing in like a laser-guided missile onto his head. Najib had little idea about it and by the time he was trying to fend it and sway out at the same time, the ball had already hit his bat high on the shoulder and sailed over slips to the boundary"
"<b>oh he's thrown it away</b>. Short ball outside off and he wanted to fetch the pull from there to midwicket. Doesn't come off and the ball just zooms up in the air and towards where short leg would have been. Carey runs forward and settles under it. Crucial wicket, at a crucial time. Clever bowling by Stoinis, he bowled it slower which meant Naib couldn't get the timing right."
"fuller outside off, driven to mid-off"

"length ball outside off, steered to point's left"
"<b>two in two to the short ball</b>. Looked like an off-cutter, and Najibullah is also gone. Was giving himself room to thwack this over extra cover, but only gets a top edge that loops up straight to Carey. Both set batsmen gone within minutes of each other and suddenly, Afghanistan are collapsing"
"quicker bouncer that time, outside off, Rashid ducks quickly and lets it sail through"

"length ball outside off, looked like Dawlat was expecting it short again, but he adjusts to get behind it and block it back to the bowler"
"back of a length, and nice carry (to Carey). Yes I know, terrible pun. But good bowling. Outside off and moving away a touch, the batsman connects with air trying to cut"
"and he's chosen to shoulder arms, perhaps safest option to a ball outside off"
"<b>that's a strange shot but he'll get a boundary</b>. Another sharp short ball, and Dawlat stayed static and went for the pull, but he was also getting his head out of the way and almost connect without looking at the ball. Luckily for him, connection was good and he gets a boundary to square leg"
"can't do it twice in a row against Cummins! This time the short ball is directed over leg stump, so Dawlat's short-arm-jab-I-won't-look-at-it pull isn't quite as effective and he feathers an edge through to the keeper"
"another short ball, but well outside off and easily let go"
"back of a length, nipping in from outside off and patted away towards mid-on"
<b>Rashid Smash</b>! That's some audacity. Skips down the track and absolutely clubs this with a flat bat over long-on
"good length on off, defended towards cover"
"<b>after the force, the timing</b>. Takes another half-step down the track, and picks this off his toes to clip it past midwicket and into the boundary"
<b>clobbered</b> Rashid's having fun! Too short and too wide outside off and he slogs it over a mid-off and to the boundary
"<b>Oh my Rashid</b> he's just taken 21 runs off this over! This was the most stunning shot perhaps. Short ball, climbing onto his head and he gets back and across to be in great position to hook it over square leg"
"swing and a miss. Take a single Mujeeb! Backing away to hack this over the legside, but it wasn't that short"
<b>Mujeeb can hit em too!</b> I take back my words about him needing to take a single. Why do that when you can swat a length ball from the stumps through midwicket for a boundary?
"ooh that's an angry response from Cummins. Bouncer that flies past him on middle stump, and is already on the way to the keeper by the time he finishes swishing air while triyng to pull"
"<b>ho ho ho, Afghanistan's spinners are having fun - with the bat!</b> That's a top edged six. The downside to bowling quick is that when a Mujeeb backs away to pull, and gets a top edge, it flies over fine leg!"
"oooh, that might be painful. Struck on his fingers, back of a length ball cutting in. Cummins was following the batsman who was backing away and Mujeeb had to fend it off from near his chest towards midwicket"
"another bouncer, but outside off this time and Rashid doesn't connect with the attempted upper-cutting steer. Still, another productive over for Afghanistan."
"fuller on leg stump, clipped to deep midwicket"
"<b>smoked straight over</b>. If Rashid can't read leggies, who can? Down the track, got to the pitch and lifted this straight up and over with arms extended and a free swing of the bat. Up, up and over"
"<b>and he's reviewed after being given out lbw</b>. Went down to sweep this length ball that was spinning into him from off stump, but misses the ball and the umpire's finger went up immediately. Don't think he'll survive this. No edge, and three reds on ball tracking. End of a super little cameo."

"heaves this to deep midwicket but doesn't get aerial, goes of the inside edge"
"leg spinner on a length on off, and he gets behind it to defend this nicely"
"<b>that's some interesting play</b>. Mujeeb was walking across very much, but Cummins followed him with a short ball that he ends up having to fend in ungainly fashion from in front of his face"
"it's all over. This time Mujeeb was backing away but Cummins didn't follow. Kept it full, fast and straight to rattle the stumps. Ends the innings but Afghanistan will take heart from that lower order resistance"

<strong>inexplicable overstep. Cummins did the same thing with his first ball of the match in the second over and now Dawlat matches him with a strange mental lapse.
