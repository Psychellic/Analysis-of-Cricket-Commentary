"a bit of width outside off, testing the bounce in the pitch, Bancroft leaves alone"
"tighter line on off stump, Bancroft squares up to defend"
"<B>huge appeal!</B> Wow, Bancroft played all around that, so full, angled into the stumps, Morkel went up twice, he was so convinced, but umpire Dharmasena was unmoved. We go for a <B>review</B>, and sure enough, that was hopping high over the leg stump... plenty of bounce, clearly, though Morkel would have preferred some skid..."
"full again, tapped into the leg side, pinned on the crease for now"
"and now the edge - controlled this time - as Morkel pulls his length back to attack the splice. Three slips in place, and the second of them fields the ball on the bounce"
"full and attacking, speared into the toes, and squeezed into the off side. That's a very feisty first over"
"full and floaty to launch his spell, dipping on the crease as Warner leans forward to defend"
"outside off, tapped into the off side, taking the pace off the ball, and an instant call. Good running as the shy comes in from the covers"
"big swing from a full length, but Bancroft is comfortably forward, steering a calm drive into the covers to get off the mark"
"a crunching drive from a very full, inswinging length. Short cover wears the shot rather than fields it. But no run either way"
"outswinger this time, Warner picks it early and lets it go"
"through to the keeper once more, a probing start from both ends"
"bouncer, the first of the morning. Good morning indeed, Mr Bancroft. He ducks, shrugs, and takes his guard again"
"lovely strike, Morkel strays in line, a freebie on the pads, and whittled through backward square with a cuff of the wrists"
"full and probing, attacking the base of the stumps, punched on the up to mid-on"
"a bit of width outside off, no stroke offered"
"in the blockhole, attacking the base of the stumps, punched to mid-on"
"banged in short once more, but well wide of off stump and swinging away"
"threatening swing from Philander, so hard to line up, especially when he bowls a full length. Poked to the off side with soft hands"
"solidly forward, smothering the lateral movement with a big stride and firm block"
"defended once more, very cautious in these early stages"
"full, and threatening to swing back through the left-hander's gate. Warner is striding into an attacking position, then has to cover up at the last minute"
fully forward once more to defend
"aggression this time from Warner, and that constant threat that he poses pays dividends. Slightly overpitched, so he unleashes his forearms and biffs a drive through long-off"
"squared up on the back foot, poked to cover"
leaning onto the front foot to defend
"very full, tailing into the stumps, blocked into the off side"
"banged in short, over the shoulder as Bancroft ducks"
nudged off the toes out to midwicket
"back of a length, good bounce on off stump, tapped to point with a half-committed stride"
"lines up the inswinger but misdirects the line, tails into the pads and tucked behind square"
"good leave! Or fortunate... who knows. Either way, Warner left a very full ball on length, and the ball <I>just</i> hopped over the top of off..."
"solidly onto the front foot, a smothering stride to defend back to the bowler"
"thumped pleasingly out through the covers, not hitting the ball too hard, but piercing the off-side ring all the same"
"got him! Perfect bowling from Philander, outside off, climbing off the deck with a hint of outswing, kissing the edge and de Kock does the rest! Bancroft's non-existent form continues, and South Africa have their first incision ..."
"outside off, a hint of outswing, deflected into the off side"
"banged in short, on the hip, nudged round the corner, there is thought of a second run but they opt against it"
"on the pads once more, another tickle to backward square"
"absolutely <i>battered</i>! Too much width, full length, Warner climbs into a Popeye-forearmed drive through the covers. No holds barred!"
"tighter line, much better, and blocked to the off side on the back foot"
"bouncing off an awkward length, into the hip, and squeezed uncomfortably to the leg side"
"'wait on ... yes!' is the call, as Warner defends stoutly straight back down the pitch, and pauses for a beat to be sure that the ball has eluded Morkel in his followthrough"
through to the keeper as Warner leaves alone on the angle
striding forward to block back down the pitch
"on the pads, flipped urgently into the leg side"
"very full, a hint of wobble on a full length, Warner defends with a loosely held blade, on the front foot"
"probing stuff from Philander, targetting the edge, and nudged into the gap"
"cracked on the up, out to point. Looking to be positive"
"squared up on the back foot, poked softly to the leg side"
"that's a properly sharp bouncer! Over the wicket to the left-hander, across the bows and leaping at the lid. Khawaja watches it late then hauls his neck out of harm's way"
"cracked fiercely through the covers! No qualms about getting back onto the front foot following the short ball, head over the ball, bat flowing through. Lovely"
"another short ball, this time swinging harmlessly over the shoulder and down the leg side"
"leg-sided once again ... de Kock gathers the ball and tosses it high in a fairly convincing appeal. Warner's response is to look for the single! Nothing doing, but good intent from the vice-captain..."
solid in defence once more
"tapped into the covers, and through for the single"
"too short, and leathered through the leg side with a dismissive pull. A bit powder-puffy from Philander, just skidded on nicely and begged to be spanked"
"over the wicket, fuller length, and ghosts a late outswinger past a tentative edge. <I>That's</I> more like it from Vern!"
"on the pads, nudged to short midwicket"
"full length, solid block"
through to the keeper once more.
"<strong>and a huge appeal first up! </strong>Another <B>review</B> coming up, and well, this looked incredibly close. Big grip from outside off, hits the back leg, which could be crucial ... and there's no inside edge, so are the timbers going to be shivered... and it is <B>missing</B>! South Africa have burned both of their reviews in the first hour!"
stretching forward to block on a good length
"another big stride, and a respectful block, into the covers. That first-up ripper was a big warning shot"
flipped off the pads to square leg
"blocked once more, more big rip from the footholes as Warner works with the spin"
pushed right back onto the stumps to defend
"very full, 143kph already, blocked on the crease line"
"extra pace, 147kph this time, but Khawaja is unmoved by the speedometer. Slightly off-line and whipped emphatically through midwicket. Top shot"
"stoutly forward on off stump, 149kph, he's getting quicker with every ball. Pushed to mid-off"
"edged, and <B>that is a stunning grab from the keeper!</B> Rabada was getting closer with every ball, and fourth-up, he found the ideal length to match his fizzing pace. Angled across the left-hander, demanding the stroke, and de Kock did outstandingly to salmon-leap in front of first slip and snaffle the chance in an outstretched left mitt!"
"inswinger on the off stump, firmly blocked"
"<B>edged and through third man!</B> Off the mark, but not in the ideal fashion... but they all count"
"uses the feet, charges down to put pressure on the bowler and punches one wide of mid-off"
"round the wicket, tossed up on off and blocked"
"looped up, straightening a touch on off, Smith gets forward"
"flighted, Smith dances out this time, whips the ball to the right of mid-on and hustles the single"
"gives this some air, wide of the stumps and Warner sticks out his front leg, lets it pass by"
"tossed up nice and slow, Warner blocks on off"
"glides in and hits a length, Smith gets across"
"slightly back of a length, 14o clicks and kicks like a Moscow mule as Smith rides the bounce"
"shortish, defended down into the leg side"
"perfect length, 141kph/88mph around off, shaping in a touch as Smith plants the front foot and defends to extra cover"
"hangs this slightly wider, good length but Smith lets it go"
angled in with the arm and Smith taps it away to the on side
"flighted, touch too full and Warner seizes on it, the jaws snap shut as he clunks four through point, punchy drive and there's no one out there"
"tossed up straighter and Warner comes down, works through mid-on - <b>that's the Australia 50 up</b>"
"full and flighted, wristy flick from Smith but he picks out midwicket"
"flatter, comes across and pushes to cover"
tossed up and defended towards mid-off coming forwards
"gives it some air, Smith again looks to hit against the spin, whips it hard to midwicket"
"banged in short, Warner gets in a tangle on the hook... but gets it away safely between the two men out for the catch! Took his eye off but played it well in the end, that <i>flew</i> between deep square and fine leg"
"hammers a length, 145kph and Warner gets into line"
"woof, that's nearly decapitated Quinny de Kock! A good leave from Warner and it has exploded from a length, climbed over off stump and kept rising"
touch too straight and worked off his pads
"pitched up, speared in on off stump, Smith rambles across and works to midwicket"
"length ball, 146kph/91mph around off stump and defended"
"tossed up outside the line, pushed into the covers coming across"

"tossed up, little bit of turn as Smith stretches out, played off the outer half of the bat to backward point"
"nice and slow, straightening on the stumps, blocked back to the bowler"
"lobbed up and Smith latches on to this, clipped with wristy impunity high over midwicket and away for four"
"length ball, comes across and blocks"
"angled on off, Warner pushes into the off side"
"length ball, trying to drag Warner over to the off side, he stubs it down towards cover again"
"slightly tighter line, 138kph and Warner defends"
"now goes for the nip-backer, extra heat at 147kph/91mph, Warner stays back and gets a thick inside edge to the leg side for one"
"giving nothing away here, back of a length and blocked on off"
tossed up from over the wicket and blocked
spinning back in and defended playing back
"flighted, around the line of off and driven, Maharaj gets a hand on it and the ball rolls to mid-off"
"tries to batter this through the covers, skipping down but flaying a drive straight to the fielder"
tight lines and this is tapped away
"floated up around off stump, defended"
"good pace and carry in the channel outside off, wide enough to leave"
"touch short of a length, 148kph and Smith gets into line to block"
"short, width on offer and Smith jumps at the chance, mistimes a chop in front of point"
"dug in, lacking some oomph, though, 130kph and Smith limbers up to crunch a pull wide of fine leg"
"short, rising to hit the thigh pad as Smith hops across his stumps"
"good length, 143kph and defended towards mid-off"

"flat on the stumps, punched through mid-on"
"floated up from round the wicket, punched to cover"
"full and flighted, tapped back"
"Smith gets him away again, brings out his own personal protractor and whisks Maharaj from outside off through midwicket for another boundary"
"only a touch short but this is superbly played, Warner just opens the face and uses the pace of Rabada, guided through gully for four to third man"
"fullish, quick and bouncy, hung outside off but left alone this time"
"length on the pads, 149kph and Warner skims it fine of the man on the rope for a couple more"
too straight from Rabada again and Warner clips through midwicket for another brace
"better line, 140-plus on a length around middle and off, shows it a straight blade"
sliding down the leg side again and Warner flicks fine for two more
"round the wicket, floated up full outside off, stabbed into the covers"
"slows his pace up, straighter line and pushed down the ground as he comes forward on middle and leg"
tossed up on the stumps and nurdled for one
"gives it some air, outside the line of off and defended"
Smith presses on to the front foot to block
tossed up on the stumps and Smith crabbily flicks it away through midwicket for one more
"short of a length, 137kph and worked off the body"
Warner gets across and taps it away
"staying over the wicket, 145kph on a length around middle and off, defended stoutly back to the bowler"
"pushed through in the corridor, Warner prods it into a gap for one"
"ooh, <b>is that a misjudgment from Smith...?</b> No stroke played, hit on the pads outside off, Morkel implores for lbw, but S Ravi is unmoved - rather like Smith, who shakes his head and looks disgusted you would even ask the question. Looked high, actually and probably didn't come back enough"
"fuller, angling in and met solidly coming forwards"
"wobbles in and puts it on a length, Warner gets across his stumps"
"length ball in the channel, this one zips through"
"good length around off, 136kph and Warner judiciously dabs it down into the off side"
"tight to off stump, looking for a little nibble either way, hits the inside half of the bat as Warner defends"
"keeper up to the stumps now... and Warner responds by sitting deep in the crease and thrashing a cut away through gully <b>to raise his half-century!</b> No warm-up matches, no problem for Davey W"
"probing away on a length, defended"
"length, climbing through outside off, Smith lets it be"

back of a length outside off ans again he can't persuade Smith to engage
"pitched up a touch more, 137kph/85mph but wide again and Smith ignores after doing his familiar do-si-do across the stumps"
"short of a length, driven off the back foot into the covers"
"goes straight now, into Smith's areas and he uses the pace against the bowler, 144kph but just a tap on the backside sends it skimming to fine leg. Welcome to Smiffy's world"
"de Kock still up as Philander trundles in, blocked on the stumps"
"tight lines, little bit of seam movement and Warner shows it a straight bat"
Warner shuffles into line and clamps down in defence
"middle-and-leg line, Warner works it off his pads"
"diligent lines from Big Vern, blocked back down the track once more"
"gottim! Philander strikes, <b>Warner fending a lifter to second slip!</b> A punch in the gut for Australia, just as they were preparing to sit down for their vittles... Yeesh, didn't see that coming, so compact and watchful has Warner been. The ball just bit into the surface and rose more than expected, took the shoulder of the bat and <i>flew</i> to de Villiers, who was also standing fairly close but clasped it safely as he tottered back. Some extra sauce for SA at the interval"
"on the off stump, tailing in, blocked with soft hands back down the pitch"
"tailing into the toes, clipped with the angle out through square leg"
another whipped flick through midwicket. There's a leg slip in place but this angle is bread-and-butter to Smith
"outside off stump, enough width for Smith to leave well alone"

"through to the keeper, outside off stump this time. Good carry and a hint of movement"
"good areas once again, outside off, staying a touch low this time"

"outside off, back of a length, punched with loose forearms into the covers"
stout block on the line of off stump once more
"flung out, well wide of off stump. Smith sizes it up but lets it go"
"width once more, but much shorter this time. Smith has all the time in the world to rise up onto his toes and pick off his first runs through the off side"
"fuller and tighter line, no stroke this time as the ball dies through to de Kock. The nip seems to be going out of this pitch as the ball gets older"
"full length, wide line, through to the keeper"
"tight line to the left-hander from over the wicket. Met on the back foot for another dot ball, the seventh of his brief stay"

stabbed out to cover with urgent footwork
"full and straight, on the spot once more with de Kock standing up to the stumps to give Marsh something more to think of"
good nip off the deck this time as Philander finds extra swing across Marsh's bows. De Kock gets his gloves in the way but can't gather cleanly
"full and leg-sided, a poor finish to the over as Marsh gets his first runs with a neat tuck through square leg"
short and thrashed through midwicket with a languid pick-up-and-pull! Saw the length so early and pivoted into the stroke like a latter-day Ricky Ponting
"on the back foot, waiting for the short, straighter delivery. Blocked"
"fuller length, wider line, Smith engages but lets it go"
"opens the face and glides through third man. Technically an edge, but beautifully soft hands so always going down"
stabbed into the off side
no way through
"plugging away on that line outside off, swinging the ball towards de Kock's gloves as he lurks right behind the batsman"
a hint of movement off the seam as Marsh lets that one thud into the keeper's gloves
"well bowled again, tailing away to the left-hander on a very tight line"
forward and poked into the covers
keeps a touch low after seaming across the left-hander. Lining him up nicely for the inswinger here ...
that's a beauty. Big swing and seam from a good off-stump line and length. Marsh keeps his bat just about inside the line as de Kock gathers
"up onto the toes, blocked back down the pitch"
"good length delivery, left alone outside off"
no stroke once more as Rabada plugs away
"through to the keeper, extra nip off the seam"

forward once more but leaving well alone outside off stump

"keeps low on off stump, Smith exaggerates his defensive block to make the point as the ball skews out to square leg"

"stabbed into the off side, more solidly behind the ball this time"
"swing from the hand, Smith lines it up and ignores it outside off"
"very full, looping towards the toes as Smith plays French Cricket to punch it into the off side"
"round the wicket, full length, cautious defence into the gully region"
soft hands on the back foot to defend back to the bowler
"that's a sumptuous smite through the covers! Just enough width to free the arms, and Marsh played it supremely, at the top of the bounce, to pick off a second boundary"
"tighter line, fuller length, drawn forward with bat and pad together to block to mid-off"
"on the back foot, blocked back down the pitch"
"on the back foot from round the wicket, made to hustle by some extra bounce"
firmly onto the front foot
"a hint of width once more, and Smith is drawn into something more extravagant. Can't time his back-foot punch though"
"swing, and a mother of leaves from Smith, who finishes with his bat pointing ostentatiously towards the midwicket floodlights"
"squared up on the front foot, blocked back down the pitch"
no stroke once more
"hint of swing away from the right-hander, left alone again. Another maiden"

"working with the spin, picked up on the leg side"
"drilled to mid-off, good intent, but no way through"
"good areas straightaway, on off stump and maybe just a hint of reverse as Smith blocks watchfully"
"too wide to tempt a stroke this time, keeps low as de Kock scoops up behind the stumps"
"better line and length, much fuller and on a fourth-stump line. Smith lets it go"
"pounding out a good length, outside off. Still no stroke"
"tailing into the stumps, blocked to the off side"
"good areas once again, wide on the crease and attacking the stumps, Ntini-style. Definite hints of reverse swing towards the end of that over as Smith hangs back in his crease to counter the threat"
tossed up and poked back to the bowler
squeezed back down the pitch
"flipped in the air for a split-second, towards the very close catcher at silly mid-on. But just short"
worked to the leg side with good wrists
striding onto the front foot and stabbed back to the bowler
"probing areas, round the wicket, threatening to pop from a good length under the batsman's eyeline. Fenced into the covers"
"lifting off the deck from back of a length, Marsh won't be tempted there"
"short and too wide, this time Marsh knows the shot is on, an emphatic back-foot spank past gully"
"outside off, better carry off the deck. Through to the keeper"
"that's the length, a touch too wide but tailing away, and forcing Marsh to make a decision. This time, the decision is to leave"
"<B>huge appeal!</B> Perfect length again, and this time bursts back off the seam, thudding Marsh's pad, but they've used all their reviews! Probably going over, indeed it was..."

"tossed up, and tapped down to long-on"
"on the pads, nudged behind square"

"leaning onto the front foot, beaten outside off this time"
"solid stride to meet the full length, head right over the ball to see off the threat"
"Rabada continues round the wicket, 136kph just back of a length outside off, Marsh shows it the maker's name"
"fuller, draws Marsh on to the front foot, holding its line outside off as he shoulders arms"
"dug in, 146kph but it bounces high and leg side and the batsman can evade"
"back of a length outside off, waved through again"
"short and wide, 143kph but Marsh can't collar the cut and picks out point"
Marsh plants the front foot and defends to cover
"tossed up and nudged into a gap, <b>Smith trots through to bring up his fifty</b>, another granite knock - and, ominously, he tends to go on. Of his last 12 50-plus scores, <a href=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/267192.html?class=1;filter=advanced;orderby=start;orderbyad=reverse;runsmin1=50;runsval1=runs;template=results;type=batting;view=innings>eight have been converted</a>"

"in the channel, slightly too wide to induce a stroke"
"full, sprayed into the pads and Smith skelps it aerially down to fine leg for one more"
"fires in the attempted yorker, Marsh is falling over... <b>but not given by umpire Dharmasena!</b> Was there some bat involved? Looked mighty close to hitting leg stump, but SA of course don't have any reviews left. It <i>did</i> hit the bat, but only after thumping the front pad"

waits in the crease and works the ball square for a single
tossed up and stroked into the off side
"oh, someone pass the Kryptonite - <b>Smith is gone!</b> Jubilation among the SA players as umpire Ravi's finger goes up and Smith stalks from the field. Needed a bit of luck but Maharaj has made the breakthrough; Smith was trying to cut, got a thick edge that deflected into and out of de Kock's gloves but then ballooned up for de Villiers to jog from slip and bag safely. Smith won't convert this time, SA have landed the big one"

"in the channel, slightly back of a length, SMarsh leaves it be"
"fuller, 136kph and punched into the off side"

presses out and defend
"eep, this skids on a touch low, 141kph and thundering into the bottom of the bat as Marsh jumps back on off"

"finally, a boundary for Paine and a nicely snaffled one too, opening the face as Philander offers just enough width from back of a length, Firmly through third man"

worked out to cover once more
opens the face in an attempt to work a single to backward point

"fizzing down the leg side, Marsh attempts a pull but can't make contact"
wafted off the pads to backward square
short. Cummins ducks. Keeper gathers
"angled into the pads once again, and Cummins gets off the mark with a well placed clip behind square. Morkel hasn't quite found his length yet"
"outside off, left alone once again"
"Vernon whirs in and puts the ball on a length, it buzzes back like an angry bee, Cummins swats it down"

"another teasing length ball on fourth/fifth stump, Cummins throws his hands up and lets it go"
back of a length outside off and Marsh dabs it square for one
"whoosh, that's not far from the poles! Morkel brings it back off a length, but Cummins knows the bounce from that height is always likely to take the ball over and shoulders arms confidently"

pushed a little straighter and Cummins brings the bat down to block this time
"round the wicket, banged in short but it climbs through above the batsman as he ducks"

"tossed up, defended coming forwards again"
"plays back, tucked to the leg side"
"bowled 'im, <b>mind the gap!</b> After the praise, the fall... Cummins pressed forwards but was feeling for the ball, bat in front of pad and there was room enough for the hard nut to skid on through without turning as much as expected, rattling the timbers. Third scalp for Maharaj"
"over the wicket, tossed up up outside off, blocked coming forwards"
steps across and defends into the covers
"dug in halfway down, skipping on as Marsh pulls, comes off the splice in front of square for one"
"length ball, Starc plays an expansive shot on the up, thick-edged past the closer catcher and Maharaj has to five chase from square leg, he then slips over as he approaches the boundary and can't stop the ball trundling for four"
"rising from a length, defended into the off side"
"woof, prancing ball, takes the gloves - <b>but clears slip and runs away for four!</b> Starc was both trying to get his hands up and avoid playing the ball, ended up punching it clear of the leaping Amla at second slip"
"another boundary, this one stroked through extra cover with the grace of Gower! Pitched up by Morkel and Starc leans on a drive, all timing to the rope"
"flighted, whumped back at the bowler, who gets a finger on it but can't prevent a run"

"oh, so close, <b>didn't quite carry to short leg!</b> The ball flew off the inside edge but was <i>just</i> short, I think, zipped under the hands"
tossed up and worked for one
"touch short outside off, Marsh drops back and cracks a cut through the infield"
"four more, Starc is wielding the willow like a light sabre, plants the front foot and clatters a sweep away to deep square leg"
Marsh comes across and pushes watchfully into the off side
"pitched up and lashed for four! Brutal power, in front of the man in the deep, <b>that is a half-century for Marsh</b>, who has played very well again, continuing his form after being recalled during the Ashes"
gets a bit too straight and Marsh flicks the single off his pads
"banged in, Starc takes another blow on the glove, <b>this time clears short leg!</b> It got big on him as he closed the bat face, think it hit the shoulder of the bat then jammed into his bottom hand - he shakes it off at the non-striker's end"
"another bumper, Marsh wear it on the body... Tough man, that came out at 139kph"
touch short and zipping in to hit the body as Marsh hangs back
tossed up and nurdled to leg for one
"flat outside off, Marsh rocks on to the back foot and cuts in front of square"
"quicker ball, spinning down the leg side, into the gloves as Starc stays back"
"WALLOP! Tossed up full, Starc is down on one knee and carts the ball on to the grass banks at deep midwicket, a disdainful slog-sweep - one of his favourite shots - and it came right out of the screws"
comes across and taps the ball away

"sliding on a little quicker outside off, opens the face and runs to backward point"
pushed through flat and Marsh tickles it into a gap in the covers - <b>up comes the Australia 300</b>

forward and defended to midwicket
"hustling pace, on the back foot, deflected uneasily into the leg side"
"width outside off stump, no great carry as de Kock scoops up on the second bounce"
"tremendous timing! A full length outswinger, not a bad ball at all, but Marsh lines it up, presents the full face, and eases a drive straight back past the bowler"
"another pleasingly solid connection, this time a punch into the covers"
"oh, well bowled, nibble off the seam from just back of a length, Lyon comes half-forward, but is nowhere near the ball as it jags away"

"tight line, in the channel, left alone with a waft of the bat"
"on the back foot, and nudged into the leg side"

solidly forward to defend
"big leave outside off stump, and no stroke offered"
"inducker on a good length, firmly pressed to point with bat and pad tight together"

more circumspectly onto the front foot to push to the leg side
"well bowled, but unlucky... tossed up, looping into the toes, and a nutmeg of an inside-edge flies through Marsh's legs down to fine leg, where Philander makes a meal of his boundary fielding, but just about saves the four. He's into the 90s..."
"worked back down the pitch, into the gap at mid-on"
defended on the back foot
fenced to short leg
"fenced through third man... they all count, especially in the 90s!"
"<B>goes for glory, and holes out to mid-on!</B> Oh Mitch... a length delivery, his eyes lit up, a big heave through the line, but he found the tallest man on the field. Morne Morkel reaches out to snaffle the chance, and Australia's linchpin has to depart"

"swept again, and up comes the 350 with another finely connected biff. In front of square this time"
"that's the way to do it. Lyon attempted another mow, this time down the ground, but a big miscue loops calmly into the covers, for Maharaj to claim a richly deserved five-wicket haul!"

"inswinger, played from deep in the crease and worked into the leg side"
"squeezed into the leg side, they look for the quick single and pick it up with ease"

"tapped into the covers, that's a sensible single, see off the new ball from the non-striker's end"
defensive prod into the off side
"nip and bounce from a good length, Elgar wears this one in the midriff, and nearly knocks the ball onto his stumps in the process! Another medal for the old campaigner"

"back of a length, 146kph but wide and left alone"
"short again, Markram slugs merrily and gets a thick outside edge over the cordon for four more! Bit wild and woolly but it only adds to Starc's frustrations"

"banged in back of a length around off stump, 144kph and Markram gets in behind it"

"floated up outside off, Elgar leans out and lets it go"
"oh, brilliant from Lyon, <b>a full-length diving catch off his own bowling</b> - Elgar is a goner! The GOAT is amongst 'em, kicking open the door with the new ball! We knew there was turn in this surface and Lyon locates a tricky spot straight away, gets the ball to straighten from round the wicket and Elgar's leading edge spooned back towards the bowler, who swoops to his right to grab a low catch with both hands"
"over the wicket, tossed up and spinning in as Amla comes across"
"significant turn here, tucked down towards short leg on the bounce"
"another one goes, two in the over for Lyon! <b>Squeezed to short leg via bat and pad</b>, Bancroft snaps up the chance! Huge wicket, the eternal Amla lasts just three deliveries... Lyon was on the money straight away, never mind the change in angle of attack, and Amla didn't look comfy; he lunged forward as the ball gripped and turned, hit the splice and then presented a straightforward catch to the man under the helmet"
"looped up and turning in on the stumps, safely defused to finish a magnificent first over from Lyon - <b>a double-wicket maiden with the new ball!</b>"

"fired in from wide on the crease, hits the outer half of the bat and runs square"
"short of a length, 139kph over the top of the stumps, blocked"
"full outside off, 142kph and drilled to cover this time - maiden, but not for want of trying on de Villiers' part"
"flighted, turning in from outside off, tapped down safely"

"<b>fended to short leg</b> - Cummins strikes! Easy as you like, banged in at the body and Markram simply pops another catch to Bancroft. A lapse in concentration from Markram?

"width outside off stump, no stroke offered"
"<strong>sharp bouncer </strong>and Faf is entirely in control of his swatted pull! Lands short of fine leg, but that was good aggression from Cummins"
de Villiers follows suit as Cummins bangs it in short once again. Fine leg in business once again as he rolls his wrists on the shot
"much fuller, flicked into the leg side with a waft of the wrists"
"<B>sharp turn!</B> Lyon tosses it up, lets it grip outside off, and it thuds into the pad. But safely outside the line on that occasion"

"watchfully blocked, into the leg side with a perfectly perpendicular bat"
"turning again, short leg is in attendance, and gathers off the face of the bat"
"<B>another big ripper!</B> Beats the inside edge, but Faf is well lined up outside off as his pad is thwacked again"

right behind the line to defend
"on the hip, a flick of the wrists out towards square leg, but short leg's shin fields well"
"angled bat, into the off side"
"worked down the ground with a firm punch. Paused for a moment to ensure the ball was past the bowler, but they safely make it for the single"
"<B>superb yorker! </B>Attacking the base of off with late outswing, but that was watched all the way onto the toe of the bat"
stretching forward to defend
"a crunching sweep, planting the foot outside the line of off, and flinging his hands across the line. Nailed it"
"well bowled again, 'gorgeous Nathan!' is the call from behind the stumps. And who am I to argue?"
forward and blocked to the leg side

"pushed onto the back foot, blocked back down the pitch"
"head over the ball, worked down to mid-on"
"<B>pops from back of a length</B> and had there been a leg gully, that would have been guzzled! Right at the body, and awkwardly fended off"

"short and leg sided, no need to play at that one"
"back of a length, nudged into the leg side"
"tossed up and driven, firmly through the covers. Such quick hands, picking off the fractional over-pitch. Sublime"
"nudged into the leg side, down the ground, and they jog through"
"now then, South Africa are on the march after lunch, as Faf this time is the one to take the initiative, advancing down the track to loft a mighty clip onto the grass banks at wide long-on"
"back of a length, from round the wicket, chopped to point. Three close catchers still in attendance"
blocked into the off side
"wider outside off from over the wicket again, a bit of grip as it is fended away off the back foot"
"full and straight, tapped back to the bowler"
probing line and length outside off stump. Left alone

"wider on the crease, angling into the stumps, but the same result from AB, full face of the bat in defence, head over the ball"
"well judged leave, very tight to off,  but AB is in a good place in this innings..."
"sumptuous. A fraction too full, in the arc for the drive, and mown through the covers"
"width outside off, and left alone"
"<B>perfect from Starc!</B> Around the wicket, wider on the crease, straightens it off the pitch. Du Plessis is committed on the front foot, defending the angle back into his stumps, and grazes an edge to Paine!"
"another threatening ball to welcome the new batsman, hitting the seam and beating the edge outside off"
"through to the keeper once more, tormenting the edge as it goes by"
"left alone, slightly wider line this time and gratefully ignored"
"pushed onto the back foot, blocked in front of off"
"full length, bending in towards middle and leg, and blocked to the leg side"
"angling into the right hander, big stride in defence to press the ball back down the pitch"

left alone with bat held high. Kept low through to the keeper too
"through to the keeper, no stroke offered"
"round the wicket, wider line, de Villiers leaves well alone"

"round the wicket, hauls the bat out of harm's way as the ball fizzes through"
firmly into line to defend
"full length again, and not quite timed this time as the ball pings into the covers off the toe of the bat. Safe enough"
"nurdled into the leg side as the ball pops up into his hip, and de Bruyn is off the mark"
firmly into line
through to the keeper
"short, and slap-pulled out to deep square leg, where it is gathered with a slide. Always in control of the stroke"
sliding down the leg side. Hazlewood hasn't quite nailed that dogged line and length so far
"tailing into the right hander, who stands tall to defend on the back foot"
"round the wicket, such a nagging line and length, reversing back into the right hander with a constant threat of seam movement. Blocked this time"
"outside off, and left alone"
no stroke offered as Starc strays wider
"such sweet timing! Inswinger, fractionally too straight, but what a riposte from de Villiers, punching with perfect timind through midwicket"
"another firm strike, this time into the covers. He's middling everything"
nudged off the hip to square leg
sliding down the leg side. Not quite on it at the moment
"better line and length, outside off and bouncing through to the keeper"
"wider on the crease, piling in towards the timbers. Blocked again"
"sharp bouncer, but AB is onto it, flashing a pull over his shoulder and down to backward square"
"<B>sharp bounce</B>, into the ribs, and that is gloved <I>inches</I> wide of the stretching Paine behind the stumps! So nearly..."
nudged to the leg side
"<B>driven and gone!</B> De Bruyn is suckered by Starc's deadly angle, into the stumps, nipping away. Stuck on the crease, he tried to hit his way out of a hole, and succeeded only in a fat edge to Paine!"
full length
"over the wicket, such a full length, de Kock is flat-footed as he stabs down at the crease to defend"
"well bowled again, wobbling on a full length, and stabbed into the leg side"
"more threatening late movement, back into the toes of the left hander. Blocked with caution on the crease"
fully forward and squeezed into the leg side
width and cracked through point. Up comes AB's fifty and he has looked utterly supreme throughout. Such a lot resting on him making it a big one though...
"tighter line, solid block"
"full length from wide on the crease, squeezed into the off side"
"better line and length now from Hazlewood, offering nothing to hit as he zeroes in on the top of off"
"very full and strikes the pad, but never a danger of lbw"
fractionally overpitched  but for once AB can't put an attacking stroke away. A slightly mistimed biff trundles to mid-on
"on the pads, and whipped away. Sweet timing and placement, and that'll help settle him into his role"
"over the wicket to the left-hander,  very full length and blocked back down the track"
"onto the front foot, pushed into the covers"
"line and length, probing away outside off stump"

"flighted, de Villiers skips down and clips through mid-on"
"round the wicket, another left-hander in his sights, defended"
"drops a touch short, de Kock latches on a raps a cut shot behind point for a boundary"
"angled in, QdK shows it a solid forward block"
"pushed through around middle and off, defensive"
"flat, gripping a touch but de Kock lines it up well and blocks on middle and off"
"shortish outside off, lets the ball fly through"
"angled in a touch straighter, de Villiers presses out and deflects a run off the inside half of the bat"
"round the wicket to Quinny, who does well to get on top of a frisky little bumper from Patty C"
"Cummins puts his shoulder to the wheel, hits a length around off, defended"
"angled in back of a length, 138kph and turned down towards midwicket"
"bit of width and it's lashed through the covers, de Kock moves into double-figures"
AB gets on to the front foot and pushes back to the bowler
"tossed up and stroked through the off side, eased away through the infield for a couple"
"steps out early but Lyon spots him, fires the ball through with a lower arm and AB defends"
"ooh, a slight misjudgment, I think, worked the ball short of midwicket on the bounce"
"floated up wide of the stumps, de Villiers slaps the ball to cover"
"this spits and bounces as ABdV plays back, manages to keep it down"
drops back in the crease and slices one past point
"over the wicket, pitched up and tickled towards mid-off half forward"
"ooh, the timing on that, checked back towards the bowler and although Cummins gets a toe on it the ball just keeps picking up speed"
comes across and taps the ball into the off side
angled in at the body and worked away to the leg side
"four more for de Kock, who watches the ball sit up and beg before rattling a pull through midwicket!"
"floated up outside off stump and AB goes down to sweep, hit on the boot and there's half an appeal - looked outside the line, maybe some bat too"
"tossed up from round the wicket, defended"
"pushed through, de Kock covers the line and blocks"
"angled in with the arm, tapped away"
"flighted, QdK comes across"
"flat on the stumps, defended standing tall"
"yowch, the new (old) ball introduces itself to de Villiers via a rap on the gloves! Dug in short by Cummins and AB leaps to get on top of it, takes a whack on the top hand - but he's okay to continue"
gets across to defend on off
"length delivery, met with a defiant straight blade"
"powering through in the corridor outside off, lets this one go"
"targeting the stumps, almost looked like it might sneak through to hit the pads before de Villiers flicked it away disdainfully to fine leg"
"back of a length in the channel outside off, driven through cover point for a couple, nicely controlled"
"flighted, outside off and de Villiers sweeps low through backward square, <b>raises the SA 150</b>"
"round the wicket, tossed up and defended on off"
"flatter on middle and leg, tapped away"
"Lyon finding his groove to the southpaw, fizzed through and blocked coming forwards"
"flat offbreak on off stump, de Kock smothers it"
gives this a bit more air but de Kock continues to line him up well in defence
"back of a length, comes across to turn to leg"
"short, rising up around off stump, 148kph but de Villiers just <del>licks his palm, smooths his hair, checks his reflection in the mirror</del> taps it down"
"hammers the ball in short, AB is across and then sways out of the way"
"length, 143kph in the channel, stunned into the turf towards extra cover"
"pushed in with the arm, whipped to leg from in front of the stumps"
"good-length delivery, defended coming forwards on off"
"and now Lyon strikes, straight through de Kock! SA nerves jangle as the sixth wicket falls - they need someone to stick around. Looked like de Kock should probably have got forward to that ball but it skidded on past the bat as he camped in the crease, before applying the fatal kiss to the top of off stump"
"over the wicket, tossed up and blocked"
Philander presses on to the front foot and stabs the ball away
floated up and blocked coming forwards again
"angled in, worked away to leg off the back foot"
comes across and tucks the ball to leg
"short of a length, blocked on off stump"
"comes across and pokes through the covers, picks the gap and they come back for two"
"bumper from Cummins, testing the No. 8's mettle, Philander ducks"
"back of a length, 140kph, defended with a straight bat"
"good length around fourth stump, Philander prods it away towards cover"
"round the wicket, dug in at 140kph, how's the ticker, Vern...? Just fine, thanks: he rocks back and swats a pull for one to deep square leg"
"flighted, dipping around off stump, punched to mid-off"
floated up and blocked on off
goes back this time and works with the spin
"ooh, that's a juicy cover drive, tossed up invitingly and Philander eases out to crunch the ball for four"
"pushed through flatter, steered square"
"looped up, Philander drops into the crease and blocks"
"fullish length, 140kph to start off with, dinked back towards mid-on without timing"
"testing line, whirring back late in the channel, judged pretty well as he sticks out the front pad and watches it by"
"good length, 145kph/90mph a foot outside off, left alone again"
pitched up and tailing in - maybe a touch of reverse for Hazlewood? - punched back to the bowler as he comes across
"tight on off stump, defended again"
"full length in the channel, scoots through a touch low as de Villiers shoulders arms"
"oof, Philander reaches for the drive, <b>edged short of second slip!</b> Was a skimmer, never quite carrying"
"in the channel, Philander props forward and is beaten... Hang on, Australia are <b>reviewing</b>? There was barely an appeal but Smith must think he heard something. Ultra Edge is equally baffled, though, nothing on the reading, so Australia will lose a review"
"no doubt this time, <b>that's a jaffa!</b> Full and straight, demanding a stroke, then fishtailing away at the last moment to snick the edge with Philander off balance and groping for the ball! Fiendish, rapid and reversing - though Philander didn't help himself by trying to play through mid-on. Not dissimilar to the Vince ball from the Ashes, without the spectacular stump flattening (or the aid of a crack)"
"pitched up on off, bunted away"
"goes for the stump-rattling reverse-swinger again, there's half an appeal as Maharaj blocks - think bat struck pad before intercepting the ball"
"oof, this zips through past the edge as he hangs back and wafts outside off"
shortish and worked off the hip for one - no protecting the tail here
"length ball, rising up as Maharaj jumps into line and blocks"
"timbeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! <b>Hazlewood plucks out off stump!</b> Australia are running amok, Maharaj completely kippered by a heat-seaking delivery that demolishes his resistance, big gap between bat and pad as he hung back tentatively. Not sure AB's trust was warranted"
"stays over the wicket, touch short outside off and jabbed down from the crease"
"full and angling across, Rabada has an airy swipe that fails to connect"
"fired in full, Rabada clips it off his toes to midwicket and they scamper through - so he'll keep the strike. I can see this going wrong again"
"over the wicket to Rabada, pitched up in the channel and driven, timed nicely for a couple"
"yoinks, <b>that's stone cold!</b> The reverse-swinging yorker crashes into Rabada's pad and, although he <b>reviews</b>, this is going to be curtains! Brutal delivery from Starc, not many No. 10s in the world will keep that out... So befuddled was Rabada that he must have thought he got some bat on it, but not a chance. Smashing into middle and leg"
"length in the channel, zips through as Morkel pokes at it"
"<b>knocked 'im over!</b> Full, fast and Morkel didn't have a hope, the ball clattering off stump via his pad! Starc screams in celebration, he wraps up a five-for with a final thunderbolt to roll South Africa over as the shadows lengthen"
"steams in and finds his length, swinging away but the line is wide and Cameron Bancroft can move across and leave comfortably"
"angling back, touch short and the ball doesn't make Bancroft play"
"rising from just back of a length, 136kph and left alone outside off"
"into the body, roughing him up and Bancroft decides to wear it, dropping the hands and taking the blow"
"short and climbing in the channel, 143kph but again the line is wide enough to ignore"
"dug in as Bancroft tries to get across, head-hunting bumper to finish the over and Bancroft has to have his wits about him to get his pineapple out of the way"
"pitched on a good length around middle and off, this rears up and hits the splice of the bat as Warner comes forward - variable bounce into the mix, too"
"tight lines, not much in the way of lateral movement yet and poked back to the bowler"
"slightly overpitched, 130kph on the stumps and Warner pings it back down the ground, no need to whack it, just timed out of the middle for the first runs of the innings"
"pushed across in the channel outside off from close to the stumps, left alone"
"pitched up, holding its line a fraction, tapped back to the bowler"
"length ball, 132kph on middle and off, Warner chops down on it in defence"
"length outside off, 137kph and this goes through a little low"
"fuller, gets Bancroft coming forward and he feels bat on ball for the first time"
"short and on the hip, clipped past the attendant close catcher and it races away, picks up four"
"banged in short and wide, again the batsman can happily ignore"
"Bancroft skips across and steps out to a length delivery, dabbed into a gap in the covers and they hustle the single"
"back of a length and pushed across the bows, 140-plus kph and Warner slices it towards point, where Markram leaps to cut it off"
"pitched around off stump, Bancroft gets into line"
"probing on a length, looking for some nibble each way, defended"
"teasing line, this does nip back at the right-hander as he shuffles across, nudged away from in front of the pad as Philander throws his hands up"
"slightly too straight, worked square off with a turn of the wrists"
"now, this keeps low, <b>flicks the bottom of the bat</b> but the ball dies in front of de Kock... looked like Bancroft was trying to withdraw at the last moment but just got a tickle on it"
"length ball, 135kph in the corridor of squeaky bottoms, left alone"
comes across to defend around off stump
"touch short and wide and Warner drops back to cut, sliced through gully for a couple"
"full, driven firmly as Warner steps out, well taken on the bounce by Markram in the overs"
"Morkel drops short, worked off the hip for a single"
"back of a length in the channel, zipping through as Bancroft shoulders arms"
"short outside off, 135kph and Bancroft attempts to cut, doesn't time the shot"
"length ball, snaking on leg stump, clipped in business-liked fashion off the pads and Warner bellows 'Yeah, yeah, yeah!' for the second as Morkel runs up from fine leg"
"good length, comes forward and taps down the track"
"angled across outside off stump, Warner lets it go"
back of a length but it doesn't quite bounce as much as expected and Warner takes it in the midriff
"sidles in and puts the ball on a length around off, 133kph and dabbed square"
"woof, that's the line for Big Vern, tempts Warner to have a fish and the ball skips flirtatiously past the outside edge"
"Morkel spears the ball in full, on target but Bancroft is alert and drops the portcullis on it"
"short and a touch leg side, worked away for a couple in front of square this time"
"climbing from back of a length, 138kph and Bancroft has to ride it, stabbed down square"
"dug in and jabbed away, square leg scurries after it"
"whipped off the pads, Maharaj has to give chase out towards deep backward square... puts in a valiant dive but replays suggest he still had the ball in his hand as the knee touched the rope, so that'll be four"
fired in and Warner defends from the crease
"Philander continues to probe away outside off, poked to cover"
"plopped on a length, 131kph but gun-barrel straight and Bancroft punches to cover"
"fuller, 136kph and met with conviction coming forwards"
gets across and lines up another forward block
"touch short, nibbling back in but flicked neatly behind square, off the inside edge but it flies fine and runs for four"
"back to the channel, asking the question and this time Bancroft keeps schtum, shoulders arms"
"and Warner goes after him first ball, tossed up and swept hard, races away to deep backward square"
presses forward to block outside off
"floated up full, Warner comes down and works one through mid-on"
"round the wicket to Bancroft, straightening on the stumps but clipped nicely through midwicket for a couple"
"tossed up and Bancroft comes down, not quite to the pitch but he gave it a firm smack and got it away fine of mid-off for another boundary - looking a mite more comfortable today"
"flatter, gripping a touch as the batsman goes back and defends"
"tight lines from Philander, blocked on middle and leg with bat thrust out next to pad"
"too straight and Warner is advancing, struck powerfully off the legs and the ball trundles away over the outfield for four more"
"good length, Warner showing lots of intent in both defence and attack right not, blocked to mid-off"
"off-stump line, not much he can do other that poke it back to the bowler"
"touch short, 132kph/81mph and jabbed square off the hip"
"miserly stuff from Philander, defended back to the bowler"
"pushed through, Warner's footwork is good as he moves across and then sways back to clip in front of square, there's a man at deep midwicket but they put Rabada under pressure with the call for two and he doesn't collect cleanly"
"tossed up and he goes for the slog-sweep, comes off the bottom edge and flies flat to midwicket"
"short, the ball sits up outside off and Bancroft cuts crisply to the deep point boundary"
"angled in from round the wicket, worked away through square leg and they push hard for two again, <b>bringing up the Australia 50</b> in short order"

"in the channel, rising through to the keeper as the batsman comes out and shoulders arms"

"cranks up the pace, 150kph on off, defended"
"touch full, not quite there for the drive, shows it a solid block"
"over the wicket, pushed through and tapped to cover"
"flighted, spinning in and blocked late from the crease"
"Maharaj is aiming for the footmarks, nicely flighted and Warner tries to come forward before reverting to solid defence"
"tossed up and Warner attempts to paddle, flips it in the air behind square leg and they take the single"
"round the wicket, angled in and worked to leg"
"tossed up on off stump, blocked"
"oh, he's thrown it away! Rabada slings down a half-tracker and all Warner can do is <b>swipe a mistimed pull to mid-on!</b> Warner throws his head back in disgust, he did <i>not</i> want to do that... Slightly cramped by the angle from round the wicket, it was quick, too, but the shot was a gift. SA have their opening"
"off and running right away. Full and wide, swinging away, Khawaja leans into a drive and finds the gap through cover. 'Wait' followed by 'yeah, yeah'"
"signs of a surface that isn't getting any quicker. Dug in, around off. Khawaja gets underneath. The ball bounces well in front of the keeper."
"back of a length outside off, keeps climbing this time but Khawaja. Lets it go nicely. Lifts his bat vertically"
"full outside off, generating decent pace is Rabada. Another watchful leave."
"<strong>beauty</strong>. Pitches and seams away. 147 kph, back of a length in that fourth-stump channel. That angle means Khawaja is lulled into playing but the ball ducks away to beat the bat. Play that, out-of-form batsman."
"tossed up around middle, worked away to midwicket"
"tossed up outside off, Bancroft runs down again and skews a drive to cover"
"the flatter one, 85 kph, quick and straight, nudged to square leg. Some oohs and aahs and whoas"
"79 kph, nicely bowled, flight outside off, Bancroft runs down and pushes the ball towards short mid-off"
"full outside off, nice loop. Bancroft is indecisive, but his eventual decision is a dab back"
"definitely clear in the mind this time. Sees some flight, runs down and drives with the spin to long-off. A controlled single"
"back of a length around middle, 146 kph, nudged to midwicket with the angle"
"full delivery outside off, driven back towards mid-off"
"full and wide, 148 kph, a neat drive to short cover, but that timing isn't there"
"good leave. Don't need to play every ball. Back of a length outside off, 142 kph, left alone"
"140 kph, digs this one in. Plenty of pace to force Bancroft to hurry underneath"
"runs! Leg byes! Four runs to Australia. A wild full toss that drifts down the leg side, just clips the pad en route to the fine leg boundary."
"87 kph, flat outside off, Khawaja looking for the sweep but the ball is short enough to bounce over the sweep, hit his glove, then the body, then the bat, then the ground"
"shortish outside off, Khawaja reads the length early, goes back and blocks"
chips down the track and defends this back
"ooh, doesn't quite account for the spin. Flat outside off, swept fiercely to deep square leg. The shot means the ball will keep spinning away from Rabada, who ran to his left, but the ball beat his dive and went away"
"shortish outside off, nudged towards square leg."
"80 kph, flight outside off, skids on as was evident with the ball taking the outside half towards point."
"full outside off, blocked to cover"

"140 kph, holds its line, excellent bowling. Back of a length outside off, tapped away towards point"
"drifts on the pads this time and Bancroft helps himself to four through backward square leg. Looking for the one that ducks back in sharply and hits Bancroft in front, but he drifts too much"
"full delivery outside off, 145 kph, driven to cover"
"a good length delivery outside off, the ball is too wide to draw a stroke, left alone"
"the reverse sweep! Bobbles up off something to the keeper, there is an appeal from SA. No, says ump Ravi, just forearm he thinks. <strong>SA review</strong>. A good one too because replays show the ball hit the glove before lobbing up. Khawaja's stuttering form continues. It's a slow surface, meaning the ball does not come on as quickly as Khawaja anticipated. He was through the shot far too early."
"slow outside off, the ball turns away, 82 kph, off the outside half towards backward point"
"short, flat and wide. Smith asks what is that? Left alone"
"slow and straight, 80 kph, pushed away to midwicket"
"oh that's nice. Slow and loopy outside off, not as full. Smith strides out, hits the outside half to point"

"141 kph, back of a length outside off, Bancroft lets this one go."
"a low full toss outside off, 143 kph, Bancroft drives back towards the bowler. Rabada sticks out his left hand to stop the ball."
"should long-on be back? Flat on leg, driven to long-on for one. I'd want Smith hitting over mid-on when he is on 0"
"that's a boundary that du Plessis should not  mind. Bancroft comes down, and hits the ball over mid-on, despite not quite getting to the pitch. Plenty of risk"
good batting. Faultless. Bancroft chips down and drives towards a deepish mid-on
"flat outside off, hit back to the bowler"
"lovely bowling, slow outside off, the ball drops late and <strong>spins to beat Smith's outside edge</strong>. Yes, beat the edge."
"slow outside off, driven to cover. More a block than a drive actually"
"gets it through, and four! Short and wide, a loosener. Bancroft doesn't let that one go, just scythes the cut in front of point"
"137 kph, some inward movement. Back of a length outside off, a thick inside edge towards square leg for one"
"140 kph, short and wide, carved to backward point."
"shortish, back of a length and wide, 137 kph. Lets this one go."
"a short delivery down leg, Bancroft lets that one pass too. Could have easily gloved that down leg, not a bad strategy"
"past backward point's left this time. Four more. Back of a length outside off, Bancroft gets on top of the bounce and cuts. With Morkel's height and a slow surface, it's a perfect cutting option. Slashed away."
"slow outside off, spinning away, pushed back to the bowler"
"nice and slow around off, driven to short cover"
"lovely batting. Flicking against the spin, on middle and leg, worked away past midwicket's left for two"
"slow outside off, driven to cover from the back foot"
"smashed away for four more. Short and wide from Maharaj, tripe. Carved away through cover point for four. Too many runs leaking from a SA perspective."

"a short delivery around off, Smith sways, not ducks."
"back of a length outside off, chopped down to Amla at first slip"
"shortish around off, pulled down to fine leg for one, 135 kph"
"short again, and smashed to midwicket. <strong>Bancroft's fifty</strong>. That will help him a lot, in terms of confidence and otherwise. Sits up for Cam to pull over midwicket"
"another short delivery, lets this one pass harmlessly by"
"another fierce pull. I can't understand that tactic on a slow pitch. It's hardly troubling them, why persist? Short on middle and leg, so much time that Bancroft rolls his wrists and pulls to deep square leg without so much as a thought"
"flight outside off, Bancroft chips down and drives to long-off"
"drilled through cover, four more. 79 kph. runs are flowing. Flight outside off, Smith transfers his weight onto the front foot and crisply hits the ball past the infield."
"flat and straight, a better length, 88 kph, spins and takes the outside half to point"
"82 kph, short on middle and leg, nudged to square leg"
"wants to come down but Maharaj flattens it out. Full and wide, pushed to point"
"nicely tossed up around off, pushed towards the bowler. 'Not now,' says Smithy. His wish commands."
"full around off, 138 kph, pushed to mid-on. 'Not now,' says Smith. Then 'wait on'. Du Plessis hits the stumps at the batsman's end, the ball ricochets and out comes another 'not nowww'"
"full and wide, sliced off the open half towards deep cover. There is a run now."
"144 kph, full on middle and leg, Bancroft falls over a flick, clips the pad for a leg bye to fine leg. That's a much better length on this surface. May have been sliding down"
"'not now' again from Smith. Full outside off, a solid bunt to cover"
"short, a bouncer on middle and off. Using it sparingly, as a surprise option is a much better way to bowl a bouncer. Smith ducks."
"141 kph, full outside off, blocked back to Smith. A tidy over from Morkel, much better change in length."
"and he strikes! Wow, that was uncanny. <b>That is terrific bowling against a batsman set on using his feet</b>. He knows Bancroft has been coming down often and driving him straight so what he does it toss it up (to invite him down) but bowl it discernibly wider (so that the ball spins away with Bancroft nowhere near the ball). That's exactly what happens. Bancroft is left stretching and the ball evades him. De Kock takes off the bails."
"slow outside off, Marsh keeps the ball down as he defends"
"short outside off, hurries on. Marsh goes back to defend. Looking for the footholes outside off"
"Marsh comes down and defends, not quite to the pitch but watchfully defended"
"runs down and drills the ball to the right of mid-on for four. That's well played. Hit with the spin, using his feet, all safe options with the angle of spin."
"slow outside off, defended by Marsh. End of a wily over. <strong>That's lunch on day 3</strong>"
"bustles in and hits a length around off, defended by Smith"
"full in the channel, Smith practically turns around and reverses across, punches to cover"
"touch short, Smith's rapier blade flashes through a standing square drive for a couple, well fielded in the deep by Markram"

"round the wicket, lobbed up and turned to leg"
"skidding on, raps the pads, <i>huge</i> appeal from South Africa... not given by S Ravi! But the <b>review</b> is quick to come and this looks close. He was playing for turn but the ball went on with the arm, the main question is did it hit him outside the line? Flicks the front pad first, he was well back, so it's certainly hitting off stump... don't think any bat involved. It's <b>umpire's call</b>, by millimetres! There wasn't quite 50% of the ball in line on impact, Lady Luck blows a raspberry at Maharaj and Smith will continue"

"fullish, up in the 140s and Marsh taps away"
"skiddy and straight, thudding into the pads, again SA want the lbw! Rabada is convinced and again du Plessis goes for the <b>review</b>, but I think this may have pitched outside leg. Yep, Dharmasena has got this right, the ball was a touch short and zipped on, but didn't land in line; so <b>SA lose one of their reviews</b>"
"slams in the bouncer as a follow-up, Marsh weaves under it"

"over the wicket, lets go a full toss which Marsh clips down the ground"
"tosses up a full delivery, Smith tries to paddle sweep and <b>is struck in front!</b> This time Dharmasena gives it, though Smith looks aghast and immediately <b>reviews</b>! No saving him this time, however, it's a beauty from Elgar, drifting and straightening down the line of leg stump and it sends Smith packing!"
"flight outside off, driven to cover"
"<strong>smashed through cover</strong>! Very loopy outside off, Mitch strides forward and says not to me, mate with a languid drive through cover."
"a waft. Back of a length outside off, shaping away, Marsh's prod goes nowhere, the ball evades him"
"good length outside off, driven to mid-off. Rabada getting the ball to move away from Shaun M."
"full and straight, driven to mid-on. A checked shot. He has to be careful of that ball ducking back in."
"full outside off, the ball moving away just a touch. That's a good length for this surface, skewed to point"
"back of a length outside off, climbing steeply. Marsh lifts his hands vertically to let it go"
"nailed! But straight to midwicket. A shortish delivery sits up for Shaun to pummel, but he picks out the fielder."

clipped to midwicket
"excellent maiden. Very probing. Shortish around off but quick, so not much time for Shaun Marsh to skip forward, nudged to square leg"
"edged and gone! It's the other one, the one that pitches and moves away. Sweet reverse-swing bowling. Good length outside off, the shine of the ball is the other way so it moves away from the right-hander, who feels he has to play because there is the big possibility of the one ducking back in. A thick outside edge at a comfortable height for Amla at first slip. SA have many problems, but slip catching isn't one of them. <b>Amla's 100th Test catch</b>"
"135 kph, good length around off, tapped towards gully"

"<strong>another big shout for lbw</strong>! Flat outside off, Marsh went right back, but the ball spun back in and hit him outside the line of off. <strong>SA review.</strong> Marsh was beaten on the inside edge, but he was so deep in the crease that SA felt they needed to review. One red, followed by two umpire's calls on HawkEye. To be fair to umpire S Ravi, that one didn't look out. Wasn't a howler either, so what's the problem? Carry on."

"full again, 136 kph, the ball takes the outside half and slices away behind point for a couple."
"<strong>how did that miss off stump?</strong> Full and swinging back in, Paine is far too late on that, the ball somehow beats his back pad and his bat (that has come down as a tomorrow afterthought) isn't close to the ball."

"133 kph, another good single. Full around off, pushed to mid-on. Paine realises Rabada has just bowled a spell so he calls yes"
"full and swinging down! <strong>A big big appeal from Philander</strong>, but that one was moving too much. A full delivery is moving back in late, Marsh misses a flick. Faf, Vern and QdK deliberate, they decide to review but Dharmasena says no more time left."

"taken at short leg! But is there bat, or just pad. No says umpire Ravi. But yes, says Faf. No, again says the umpire. <b>They've taken too long again.</b> And it saves them a review because the bat was nowhere near the ball."
"on the bounce to midwicket, tossed up outside off, worked away but on the bounce to the fielder."
"<strong>and taken at slip</strong>, on the stroke of tea. Maharaj takes three. Paine wants the third umpire to check if it has carried. De Villiers raises his finger. So does S Ravi for the soft signal. For many of these catches, there is some hesitation, but this one isn't even close to the ground so Australia lose their sixth. Another nice piece of bowling, slow and wide outside off, not full not short, drawing Paine forward and then the ball spinning away."

"<b>dropped!</b> Lyon reaches outside off and diverts a rapid chance towards second slip, AB de Villiers got both hands up <b>but shelled the chance!</b> Maybe didn't pick it up quickly enough. Groans echo around Kingsmead"
banged in short and Lyon ducks it
"touch back of a length, 130kph and punched through the covers off the back foot"
"bumper to finish the over, Cummins is quickly down on his haunches"
"edged and gone! 139 kph, and Lyon nicks off to first slip. Real danger for South Africa now. A lovely delivery, good length in a channel outside off, the ball pitches and moves away. Lyon drives, gets a thick outside edge which flies low to Amla at first slip, who gets forward and takes a good 'un."
"a full delivery outside off, 140 kph, driven to mid-off."
"short and wide outside off, 140 kph, right in the cutting arc but Hazlewood makes no contact."
nicely played. Morkel is too full and driven through mid-off and that takes <b>Australia's lead over 400</b>
"a languid drive through cover for three to begin the day. 141 kph, full and angling away. A leaden-footed drive through cover. Elgar chases it down."
"back of a length around off, 135 kph, nudged to midwicket."
"flight outside off, Hazlewood uses his long reach to defend"
"the wild sweep, tossed up outside off, Hazlewood gets low but misses the heave. Struck on the body"
"88 kph, quick and full, smothered back"
"84 kph, flat outside off, another attempted sweep, another appeal as the ball hits pad. But that looked like it struck the pad outside the line. But <strong>Faf asks why not review</strong> and makes the T sign. No bat. Well outside the line of off says HawkEye, so poor review. Needless."
"flat on off, Hazlewood works the ball through square leg for one"
"slow around off, 85 kph, nicely kept out. Good length from Kesh"
"back of a length delivery, angling away, punched to mid-off from the crease"
"the bouncer around off, 144 kph. Hazlewood sways and looks to dab the ball over the slips, but he's not a good enough batsman to make contact with the pace of Morne"
"<strong>lobs to mid-on, on the bounce!</strong> A slower ball, a lovely variation to the No. 11. Hazlewood is through his shot too early, just pitches in front of Faf. A direct hit at the bowler's end asks for the third umpire to check, but all good."
"a length delivery around off, Cummins clears his front leg and swats one to mid-on. T20 terminology in commentary, rare!"
"another short, slower ball. Cummins watches the ball onto his bat and then guides the ball over AB at second slip. Just evades the fielder"
"full and wide, 137 kph, pushed to cover. Already a frustrating morning for SA"
"heaved away into no-man's land at midwicket. Slow through the air, around middle. Morne at long-on runs around"
there's six for Australia. A tossed up delivery is deposited into the grass banks over midwicket with a well-timed slog sweep!
"slow on middle and leg, Cummins blocks"
"dragged on, and Maharaj has four. He tossed that up wider outside off, Cummins chooses to drag the slog sweep instead of hitting through the off side. It's a risky option. The ball takes the inside edge and clips the side of leg stump. Australia all out for 227, setting <b>SA 417 to win the first Test</b>"
"swing! <b>Almost knocks down off stump</b>. I guess that's a good leave. Full delivery outside off, pitched outside and swung back in. Would have broken a fifth stump"
"a low full toss and SA are away. A full toss, swinging in the air, punched away into the gap at cover for four. Easy runs."
"good length delivery outside off, 141 kph, fifth-stump line, some inward movement. But off the middle of the bat to point"
"a good length delivery around off, 141 kph, off the outside edge towards gully for two, to the right of the fielder"
"goes short does Starc, 144 kph bouncer outside off, Markram ducks"
"full delivery around off, 147 kph, blocked to mid-off. Nice defensive stride"
"full delivery outside off, pushed away to mid-off. Interestingly, a short cover in place, no third slip."
"back of a length around off, solidly defended towards point"
"through that gully region for four. Fullish length, the ball angling away. Elgar gets a thick outside edge which dies down and races away through the vacant region."
"on a length and straight, 138 kph, defended back confidently"
"full and wide outside off, 134 kph, left alone"
"dug in short around off, Elgar gets underneath"
"full and wide, angling this away. Markram goes reaching at that, under-edges that through to gully."
"a nice punchy push through cover. Back of a length outside off, Markram stands tall and punches through cover for one. Nicely played."
"a length delivery outside off, 148 kph, Elgar stands tall and lets this one go"
"good length outside off, left alone, 146 kph."
drifts on the pads and Elgar clips him away easily through square leg. Starc strays and nicely worked behind square for four.
"full delivery outside off, solidly defended to cover"
"shortish and wide outside off, Markram sees width, his eyes light up and he cuts fiercely through backward point. Nice"
"goes short this time, 138 kph. Markram pulls, a top edge on the bounce to fine leg. Starc gets across"
"a full delivery outside off, Elgar looks to drive but mis-times it towards mid-on"
"full and wide outside off, asking Elgar to drive. Not yet. Left alone"
"goes short, on middle, 136 kph, Elgar takes his bottom hand off the bat as he defends. It actually raps him on the glove."
"good length but too wide outside off, left alone again"
"'there it is,' is the call from someone in the slips. That's how he got out in the first innings. A short delivery on the ribs, Markram gets on top of the bounce to keep it down towards short leg"
"past point for four. A short delivery outside off, Markram gets on top of the bounce and cuts in front of point. Races away. This is good proactive batting from Markram"
"full and straight, the ball attacking the pads, Markram defends back with the full face."
"another well-directed short delivery on middle, Markram is hurried but chooses a good shot, ducks underneath"
"back of a length outside off, 142 kph, defended towards point. Dharmasena has a chat with Starc, probably something to do with walking near the danger area"
"148 kph, drifts down leg, Markram wants to attack but it's too far down. Would have been close to wide to a left-hander in white-ball cricket."
"on the pads, full. No flick this time as Elgar defends"
"strays down leg, nudged past short leg for a run. That will make him feel better"
"shortish and quick, outside off, Markram goes back and lets that one go"
"ooh, plays for more turn than there is, flat outside off, plenty of drift. <strong>Beaten on the outside edge</strong>"
"shortish outside off, watchfully patted back"
"strays on the pads, 89 kph, nudged to deep square leg again."
"too straight again and Markram flicks him away again. Short down leg, clipped away through midwicket, three more runs. Vast expanses of unoccupied real estate"
"full delivery outside off, defended, 143 kph, no need to play at that one"
"good length and wide outside off, 144 kph, left alone. Nearly a no-ball!"
"full outside off, driven towards mid-off. Elgar thinks of one before rightly calling 'waaait'"
"edged and gone! There's Australia's first. A back of a length delivery outside off, the ball bounces extra. Elgar is lulled into playing but the ball keeps climbing. Elgar tries to withdraw the bat, but it's too late, he can't improvise quickly enough against a bowler with Starc's pace. He gets a thin edge through to T-Paine."
"goes short first up. The good thing is that it's excellently directed and not a wasted bouncer. Amla stands tall and plays it back down the pitch very well, but that's sure to wake him up!"
"'that's gorgeous bowling,' says Paine. Slow outside off, defended back."
"83 kph, off the inside edge but well past short leg, some flight around middle and leg, through to deep square leg"
"plays it later and inside the crease, very watchfully defended"
"slow around off, turned away to midwicket. 87 kph, playing it typically late"
"short around off, turns back in, played neatly into the leg side"
"very nicely played, goes right back and works the ball to deep square leg to get off the dreaded pair."
"a good length delivery outside off, not much movement. Left alone."
"<strong>edged, short of second slip!</strong> Full delivery outside off, a thick outside edge to second slip, but that's Amla's very soft hands at play."
"a wasted delivery, full and pushed very wide outside off, moving away. Looking to get the ball to swing away. Left alone"
"full around off, and middle, those were the deliveries that went past Amla in the reverse series in Australia. Defended back nicely this time, right behind the line, head over the ball, eyes are on it."
"full again, on middle and leg, 145 kph, played away to midwicket"
"full around off, defended back with the full face."
"turn and bounce, <b>half a chance for short leg!</b> Lyon nearly bags his first, the ball spits at Markram who punches it past Bancroft, he got a hand up but was never catching it"
"tossed up and Amla skelps four through the leg side, wristy magnificence and it beats the man in the deep"
"pushed through outside off, lets this go"
"flighted, stays in the crease and works the ball with the spin for one"
"looped up, Markram is quick to come down, smothers the ball in defence"
"floated a touch wide of the stumps, tapped towards cover"
"good length, 144kph around off and Amla gets into line"
"pitched up, drifting into the pads and it's flicked neatly behind square for a couple"
"back of a length, 144kph, rising in the corridor as Amla shoulders arms"
"banged in, ticklish bouncer and Amla tucks his arms in as it heads leg side"
"goes straight, raps the pads, and after a prolonged appeal <b>up goes Dharmasena's finger!</b> Amla has missed it... but he asks for a <b>review</b>, possibly in hope more than expectation. He had crept across his stumps and this looks to be hitting: yep, <b>umpire's call</b> on the top of leg stump and he has to go, removed by Hazlewood for the sixth time in Tests"
"back of a length wide of off stump, 140kph and de Villiers lets it bounce through"
"looped up outside off, spinning a touch as Markram comes across to defend"
"HUGE appeal, Markram defeated on the back foot... outside the line? He jumped across and the ball kept low, thudded into the back pad; but <b>Australia don't review this time</b>"
"uses the feet, tapped down the leg side and Bancroft slow-motions an underarm towards the stumps as Markram returns to ground his bat"
"tossed up on off, defended"
"excitement behind the stumps, Smith is dancing up from slip... <b>Beat the outside edge</b>, into the gloves and then Paine dislodges the bails for good measure, but it's as you were"
"oh dear, <b>de Villiers is run out at the non-striker's end!</b> Calamitous! What is going on here...? Markram worked the ball behind square on the leg side, de Villiers called and was halfway down when Markram indicated he wasn't interested - having initially taken a couple of steps - Warner then fired a flat throw to Lyon and AB was nowhere near getting back, desperately stumbling and diving for the crease! Utter shambles, and Australia have knocked another brick from the wall"
shortish and worked away off the body to square leg
"good length around fourth stump, defended coming across"
fired in straight and du Plessis taps it away to the leg side
"touch short outside off, 146kph/90mph and zipping through as Faf shoulders arms"
"jumps wide and angles the ball in, chopped down in defence"
"jeepers, that's a <b>searing attempted yorker</b>, 140kph and zeroing in on middle and leg stump, but du Plessis plays it <i>superbly</i> and pings four through midwicket, jammed the bat down to keep it out and the pace takes it to the boundary rope"
"tossed up wide of off stump, Markram blocks"
uses the feet and gets out to smother the danger
"gives it some loop, again met on the front foot"

"pitched up, 144kph/89mph and tailing in towards off, Markram blunts a drive to cover point for one"
"flighted, dipping outside off and defended pressing forwards"
fizzing through and clipped towards cover
"Lyon probing away around off stump, more steadfast defence from Markram"

tossed up and met with a forward block
"Lyon gives it some air, steps down and pushes a single through mid-on to keep the strike"
"starts with a nagging line, just back of a length, 145kph and defended on the back foot"
"touch straighter, waits in the crease and turns one through midwicket"
"<b>off stump out of the ground!</b> Cummins you relentless beauty! Du Plessis is run through, he left a bit of a gap and Cummins sought it out like bloodhound picking up a scent, perfect length to hit the top of off and send it cartwheeling several feet back. What a sight that is, Australia are running rampant"
tight line on off and de Bruyn gets across to block
"dug in short, feisty bumper that whirs through at head height, TdB ducks"
"lickety-split from Cummins, touches 150kph as the batsman comes across to defend"

"sliding in straighter, tapped to leg from in front of middle stump"
"flat offbreak, defended on the back foot"
"tossed up wide and TdB sticks out his front pad, there's a concerted appeal for lbw, as he's not playing a stroke - but S Ravi isn't interested"
"whoosh, pace and bounce and the ball screams past the outside edge as Markram flirts with a back-foot drive"

"dug in short, 145kph and jabbed down past the lurking short leg"
"tossed up outside off, Markram plunges on to the front foot and defends"
faster delivery and this time he adjusts to poke it away on the back foot

"terrific batting. Overpitched outside off, de Bruyn offers the full face of the bat and nails the straight drive to the right of mid-off. 149 kph"
"good length delivery around off, defended into the cover region. Starc has a monologue with de Bruyn"

"144 kph, full outside off, the ball pitches and <strong>moves away to beat the bat</strong>. Starc is seething now. He has overstepped."
"back of a length delivery around off, de Bruyn is right behind the line. A sarcastic smile from Starc and some words. What an over that was. 13 runs, lots of words, some chances."

"on top of the bounce and pulling to deep square leg. Short around off, pulled away for one"

"four more, runs leaking now, on the pads from Hazlewood and de Kock picks a big gap at midwicket to gather four"
"overpitched outside off, driven to mid-off with the full face"

"<strong>beats the outside edge</strong>. Angled away, full, lulls de Kock into a drive but there is too much movement."
"tapped past gully for four. 134 kph, moving away, opens the bat face and carves the ball. Lots of runs."

"full on off, defended into the off side"
"back of a length on off, right behind the line, 141 kph"
"that was a badly-judged single but he makes it! Full on off, pushed to mid-on and calls for one. A valiant dive leaves his shirt with gravel on it, but that means <strong>Markram gets to a sensational hundred</strong>. One of the better fourth-innings hundreds you will see, burdened further by AB's run-out."
"into the gap and four. <strong>De Kock gets to fifty too.</strong> Full and wide, and caressed away into the gap. Starc nullified after tea"
"four more! 141 kph, full, wide outside off and flies off the outside edge through the vacant gully region. His feet were rooted to the crease but he still finds the gap."

"full outside off, 134 kph, a very positive, confident leave."

a punchy push in front of point this time. Mitch Marsh labours across to his right to save some runs.
"another boundary! Back of a length down leg, looking to nudge but the ball takes the face of the bat and away for four to fine leg."
"it definitely hit the helmet! But was there some glove on it too? <strong>Smith opts to review</strong>. That's a sensational bouncer, aimed for the badge, hits the badge, and lobs to Smith at first slip. He wanted to sway, then duck, then just wore the blow: that's as good a bouncer as you would find. Missed the glove. <b>Australia lose their review, they have none left</b>."
"hit again on the body! Back of a length down leg, off the elbow to short leg, who takes the catch and hits the stumps at the batsman's end. Three fielders have their arms up in appeal. The umpires decide there is no appeal. <strong>Huge swelling on that elbow, that forearm. </strong>"
"flat on the pads, a thick inside edge to fine leg"
"on middle and leg, nudged into the gap at midwicket for one"

"short around middle, 132 kph, de Kock wanted to flick through square leg but failed to make adequate contact."
"shortish and wide, a more forceful cut to deep point for one"
"pulled away. 137 kph, short down leg, helped along to fine leg. Looks like he will play that shot hereon."
a mis-timed pull off a 139 kph bouncer. Hurried on the pull. This is terrific short-ball bowling on a slow pitch to hurry batsmen in their backyard.

"slow outside off, defended"
nudged away to midwicket with the spin
"the quicker one, on off, worked to midwicket"
"too good, as soon as Lyon overpitches, he goes through with the shot. A languid drive through cover for four. So full that he can play against the spin."
"short on off, worked to deep midwicket for one."
"slow around off, de Kock is right forward to defend"
"another short delivery, another pull. he is in control of that pull, rolls his wrists and finds the gap behind square. Starc gets across to save two"
"another pull into the gap behind square. Lyon gets across from deep square leg, but two more."
"it is outside off, on a length and punched past cover for two more. The deep point fielder can't stop two."
"another short ball, controls the pull down to fine leg for one. Seven off this over."

"yet another controlled pull, de Kock gets over the bounce and pulls to deep square leg."

"oh well bowled. Sees de Kock coming and shortens the length, but QdK does well to improvise a dab to point."

"shortish outside off, carved to point"

flatter trajectory and Markram covers his stumps in defence

"Cummins charges in and pitches the ball up outside off, gas a bit low now, 130s kph and de Kock drives, picks out extra cover"
"full and punched on the drive again, Warner can grab it first time in the covers and they scamper through"
"length ball, Markram is on to the front foot in good order and splunks a couple more in front of the sweeper"
"banged in, Cummins cranks it up to 142kph and the ball is quickly on Markram as he pulls, comes off the glove/handle and loops behind short leg. On another day..."
"full length in the channel, inviting the drive and again de Kock strokes it to the man at short extra cover"
"Lyon floats the ball up wide of the stump, left alone"
"played with the spin, tapped down and short leg grabs the ball as it threatens to spin away for a single"
"smashed back at the bowler, <b>Lyon can't get a hand on it!</b> It was at a catchable height, but that's about as close as it was to being a chance, absolutely belted by Markram, umpire Ravi had to dive for cover"
pushed through quicker and dabbed away behind square
"flat and spinning in, works on more off the hip"
more noise around the ground as de Kock presses out and spanks an overpitched delivery through the covers! <b>South Africa's requirement comes down below 150</b>

"sliding across the left-hander, de Kock stays back and angles a single"
"good length and worked off the hip, they're ticking over without fuss here"

He was trying to run the ball off the face and sent it straight into Tim Paine's gloves, but he did superbly to hold it. The SA team stand in the dressing room to clap him in - it was a fantastic knock, gargling on grit, but as he walks off the light returns to Australian eyes"

"touch short, he hops into line and defends"
"play and a miss, feeling for it outside off stump"
"<b>stumps shattered!</b> Starc the barbarian does it again! Maharaj is helpless here, a reverse-swinging rocket that veers as if by remote control past the groping bat and smashes into middle and off! This spell should come with a Parental Guidance warning"

tossed up around the line of off and Morkel dead-bats it once again

Thought there might have been an inside edge, but no, it beat the bat as de Kock drove, would have hit leg stump. So <b>Australia wrap up a 118-run win</b>, finishing the innings off without drama on the final morning"
