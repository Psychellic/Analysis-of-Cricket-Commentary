"carved over backward point. Wow, that's some hit. Backed away to cut but the ball got big on him. So he readjusted to hit this behind square. Monstrous hit"
"direct hit at the bowler's end may have been interesting. This was a length ball that was deflected to point, the no-striker was more than halfway down the pitch when he was sent back"
backs away to squeeze it behind point but is deceived by the slow off cutter. Beaten
"he's clobbered that into the third tier at the Ricky Ponting Stand. Too full on the pads and Quiney simply unleashes a monster hit. Those wrist, forearms. everything into play as the ball sails over"
"<b> run out opportunity missed. </b> Quiney was on the floor as he tried to negotiate that full delivery. Then he hared halfway down the pitch in anticipation of a single, only to be sent back. The bowler went across and hurled a throw at the striker's end even as Quiney dived, but missed"

gets forward and works this with the angle towards deep midwicket
steered into the deep point region
"excellent yorker, right into the blockhole which the batsman couldn't get underneath as he tried to deflect it behind square"
"pulled but the bottom hand came off the grip, which meant he didn't generate the kind of power he would have liked. Turns out to be a simple catch for deep midwicket. It was a slower delivery as well, which meant Quiney had to force the pace, but he got this off the toe end too. Has the wicket come a little too late, though? Super knock from Quiney"
"backs away to flick, but gets an inside edge that flies between his legs and into the fine leg boundary. Broad beat him in this mini-contest, but still saw the ball race into the boundary. Anguish, I tell you"

"gets the yorker to tail back in to strike Hussey on his right foot as he looks to swing across the line, they'll take a leg bye"
"no chance for mid-off. That was simply smashed with immense power. Too full, Maxwell drilled it and knew straightaway that it was four"
"so, so clever. Too full again, this time Maxwell goes over the infield. No risk if you can muscle the ball like Maxwell does. Top shot"
turns a yorker length delivery outside off towards the man coming in from long on
"short, and he's crunched that one bounce into the deep midwicket boundary. Ricky Ponting would have been proud of that. Picked the length early, transferred the weight back, and boom!"
"bowls another leg stump half-volley, which Maxwell has flicked between deep square and deep midwicket. This is sensational stuff. Just a roll of the wrists and the ball raced away"
"can't squeeze that past the bowler. Yorker length outside off, digs it out and Broad fires a throw in frustration at the striker's end"
"stunner at midwicket. Hussey picked the bones out of that short ball, but Sangakkara, throwing himself to his right like a goal keeper, pulled off a one-handed catch. That was hit with some power. Wow, Sangakkara shows no sign of pain. That surely must sting for a while though."
"bang a length ball into middle and leg, Faulkner backs away to play but is hit high on the thigh pad and they scamper a run. Broad ran to his right and fired a throw at the bowler's end, hit direct too but the batsman was well in"
"it's all over. Full toss outside off, he backs away and slaps that over cover. How easily have they chased this down? Beauty of a wicket, and the crowds have got their monies worth"
