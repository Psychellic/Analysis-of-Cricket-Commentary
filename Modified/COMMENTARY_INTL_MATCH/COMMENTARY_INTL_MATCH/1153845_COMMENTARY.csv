"starts with a length delivery around off, confident little forward lean from Tamim to block it"
"pulls this one a tad shorter and swings it in too, troubles Tamim with the bounce as that hits him in the abdomen"
"132.6kmh, back of length around off again, this time he stays back and defends nicely"
"towards the leg side again, he tries to tuck it fine but gets a leg bye for now"
"134.4kmh, just back of length and angling in towards middle and leg, he defends it towards midwicket"
little straighter on middle stumps and he defends it back
"nice shape straightaway, swinging it away from Tamim outside off, he leans into it and drives into the covers"
hint of outswing as the length is pulled back a bit and Tamim shoulders arms this time
"mixes it up with a bouncer, Tamim ducks under it pretty early"
"on length just outside off, nice seam position for the outswing, Tami blocks it back with a straight bat"
"137.3kmh, hurries him up a little by banging it shorter and little wider, Tamim defends from the top half of his bat while taking a hand off"
"<b>beats him</b> on the last ball. Good shape to swing the ball, pitches it on good length outside off and it makes Tamim poke and miss off the back foot"
"back of length outside off, he steers it late towards third man"
"on middle and off, no movement and Tamim closes the face of the bat to tuck it to leg"
"135.3kmh, here comes the bouncer from Henry. Tamim watches and sways away from the line of the ball to let it go"
watches it late and defends the length ball around off into the off side
there was a sound as the ball is put down by Latham down the leg side. It's called a wide though
"<strong>run-out chance</strong> and Tamim survives because of a wayward throw from Williamson at cover! He pushed the length ball into the covers and wanted a run that didn't exist, he was sent back and could have been dismissed had the captain sent the ball in towards the keeper, and not make him dive with that throw to his right"
more on the leg side and it's tucked off the pads towards square leg for two
"that's an <b>excellent catch</b> running towards the boundary from Lockie Ferguson. Boult has struck early again and will Liton be happy with that shot? Came down the track and lofted that pretty high on the leg side with a straight bat, but he hardly got anything on that to get the distance he would have liked. Ferguson from mid-on runs back towards the boundary and does just enough to get both hands to it without having to put in a dive"
pushes him on the back foot with that length and he defends it close to himself
"and opens him up a little this time with the swing after pitching it on middle and off, swings away just a hint and Tamim gets a thick outside edge to third man"
"tries the yorker first up to Soumya, it's just a tad inaccurate towards the leg and he flicks it away just behind square, almost losing his balance. They decide to come back for the second as the fielder doesn't chase it at full speed"
"much shorter on the leg side this time, tucked away more confidently for one towards long leg"
"pretty accurate on the off stump, no room whatsoever, and he defends it to leg for a quick single"
leans into the ball on the off side to push it into the covers
"on length around middle and off, Tamim closes the bat a bit awkwardly to defend it to leg"
pulls the length a bit shorter and that gives Tamim some time to tuck it to leg for one
back of length on the stumps and he steers it to third man
"similar length around 132kmh, on the off stump this time and he defends it back"
"stifled appeal from Henry as he brings the ball in from middle, hits Tamim on the thigh pad. There was bounce there and probably going down leg too"
"slightly wide outside off with the outswing, left alone easily"
"fuller now and closer to off, pushed straight to cover point  without much footwork"
"short ball at 138kmh, it's headed towards his head and he adjusts well to pull that behind square, while taking his eyes off the ball, but does enough to beat fine leg for the first four of the morning"
"shaping away a little, pushed nicely into the covers again"
"back of length this time on off, good bounce and he defends it off the back foot to point"
"nice and teasing line outside off with the away swing, but he lets it go"
"back of length on middle, he stays back and defends it back to Henry"
"much louder appeal than the one in his previous over, the umpire says no and NZ decide not to review. It was a close call but might have pitched outside leg. It pitched just outside leg, the replay confirms, and straightened just a bit to clip leg stump"
goes back because of the shorter length and is surprised by the bounce outside off while defending into the covers
puts his weight on the front foot a bit and the inswing takes a thick inside edge to leg
"much <b>closer lbw shout</b>, looked like it pitched in line and is headed for the stumps, the finger goes up soon enough and <strong>Tamim reviews it</strong>. No inside edge there, fair gap actually, and ball-tracking says it has pitched in line, and it has straightened enough to just clip the top of the stumps so the decision stays out but Bangladesh do not lose their review because of the umpire's call"
"right on target with the length ball on middle, he blocks it with a straight bat"
"nice outswing from wide of the crease, Soumya doesn't move his feet much and drives into the covers"
"drives on the up and <strong>just over cover point</strong>. This one was swinging away too, again minimal footwork while driving the ball away and that just about evaded the fielder on the off side for two"
sends in a bouncer this time and Soumya lets it go easily
"pitches it up nicely and there's swing too, Soumya digs it out to drive into the covers"
"pitching on leg and swinging in, Mushfiqur takes it on the body as he's cramped for room"
"140kmh, full around off, hint of inswing and he drives that down the ground nicely with a straight bat. That's straight enough to go to the right of mid-off for three"
ooh <strong>risky leave</strong> that from Mushfiqur. I wonder if he left that on length - it was just short of length around off and nipped in a bit to go just over the off stump
much wider this time outside off and easier to let it go
pushed down the ground on the up and it stayed in the air for a bit but fell a few yards short of mid-on. Was angling in nicely from length towards middle stump
"back to outside off, he waits on the back foot and defends towards point"
"bit too full this time, straight-bat drive and Henry stops in his follow through"
"<strong>thick edge </strong> and that rolls away to third man. It was on that good length outside off, tempted him to drive and he did away from his body to get a thick outside edge that was in the air for a bit"
a bouncer to start the over that he ducks under early
"short again, this time he pulls confidently and hard and it races away to a sliding Henry at fine leg"
"<strong>edged</strong>, doesn't carry and goes between the two slips for four! Boult pitched it up and probably had the batsman in tow minds but he used soft hands nicely to hardly give the ball distance and it fell short and wide of first slip"
"beats him outside off again! Much shorter this time, good pace, almost holds its line outside off and goes past the outside edge as he tries to defend on the back foot"
nicely defended off the back foot to cover point this time from outside off
"errs with the line on the last ball and it's four leg byes. Fullish and going down leg, he tries to flick but gets only the pad and the team will take those four extras on the last ball of the Powerplay"
"just back of length around off, he stays back and defends to leg"
pushes that straighter ball down towards mid-on with that flick-push Mushfiqur plays
<strong>dropped at midwicket</strong>! Short ball and Mushfiqur pulled that really hard to Todd Astle who put his hands up at the right time to his right above the shoulders but the ball went through them
"in the air again, this time Soumya plays on the up but luckily for him it goes well over cover point for two"
much more confident shot this time. He gets a full delivery just outside off and he waits before steering that between point and cover point by opening the face of the bat on the off side. Very nicely executed and he gets four
"around the off stump and swinging in, he lets it go on the length"
"angling away from off stump, he leans into it a bit and pushes the ball into the covers"
"bit straighter this time on middle, he waits and defends it back nicely"
"short, pulled, and a one-bounce four! It wasn't a nasty short ball, rose just around chest height and Mushfiqur pivoted just enough on the back foot to send it in the air to the square-leg boundary. Didn't hit that very hard or it might have gone for six"
swinging in a bit and Mushfiqur taps it to the leg side behind square
"full, outside off, opens the face of the bat to steer it to third man"
"good length again, swinging in from around off and it's pushed down to mid-on"
starts with a wide down the leg side
"and another one, this one with more inswing and one more extra"
"well outside off now, uses the angle and the batsman lets it go easily"
"oh that's the biggest wide of the over, and the morning, swinging further away from the batsman after pitching"
"and he's taken a wicket after all those wides! No dangerous pace, hardly any movement - just enough with the angle - but it's the accuracy outside off that tempts Soumya to drive. And as he does, the ball takes a thick outside edge to fly to Taylor at wide slip"
"oh my, a wide for a right-hander too. This one well outside off and swinging away too"
"better line now, outside the off stump with some shape and left alone"
"fifth wide of the over! Down the right-hander's leg side this time, might have been a sound there but the umpire doesn't think so"
"this one stays just inside the wide line on the off side despite the swing, legitimate delivery number four of the over"
"too wide and short, hardly any pace and Mithun stays on the back foot to punch that with some power through the covers for four"
"first ball of the over on the stumps, Mithun pushes it down towards mid-on"
"143kmh, full outside off and a nice, late drive to beat Neesham at short point. Driven quite square of the wicket and he gets three for that"
"angling in from just outside off, defended into the covers for one"
"angling in sharply into Mushfiqur this time, it went off the thigh pad towards off and the batsman had no idea where that went"
"<strong>dropped at first slip by Taylor</strong>! That was just a straightforward catch, it's hard to believe Taylor put it down. Teasing line outside off, he drove away from the body for a thick edge and it went towards Taylor's right where he got both hands easily but it didn't stick in"
"a short ball down the leg side but not given a wide. Was probably just over the batsman, but close call"
"that is way too wide down the leg side, it even misses the keeper and has gone to the boundary"
""
nice outswing but it's too full outside off and he does well to go down on a knee and drive it nicely square of the wicket in the gap for four
"better length and closer to the stumps, he stays back and defends"
"123.6kmh, on the stumps again and on good length, solid straight bat stuff from Mushfiqur"
"away swing, wayward line and it's well outside the line for another wide"
outswing again and I think it was <em>just</em> outside the wide line but he got away with it
"oh this one shapes in after pitching outside off, short of length, and Mushfiqur watches it go"
"back to his outswing now, it's inside the wide line so that's the end of the over"
"<strong>dropped by Taylor at slip again</strong>! What's going on?! Just back of length outside off and Mithun pokes at it, gets a thick outside edge and it should be a regulation slip catch. But Taylor goes to his left, gets both hands again around knee height, and he juggles yet again to spill it"
off the middle off the bat this time outside off for a single towards cover point
"short ball outside off, some room too and Mushfiqur plays the upper cut towards third man"
"punched off the back foot just behind square, and Nicholls puts in a dive to his right to save a few. Might make Ferguson feel a bit better"
short ball just about down the leg side and it's not called a wide. First bouncer of the over
"back of length jut outside off, he defends close to the pitch and wants one but is sent back immediately"
"nice line and length outside off, opens the face of the bat just a bit to defend to off"
hint of room outside off and the slow pace allows Mushfiqur to tap it late to third man
yet another wide from de Grandhomme. This one on length but well down the leg side
little full outside off and driven hard to cover where half a dive stops the ball
"on middle and leg, no room and he defends to midwicket this time"
"straight bat, head down a a solid defence for the length ball just outside off"
"too full and just outside off, straight bat again but this time there's some power in it as Mithun drills it down the ground, just past the bowler for four"
back of length outside off and he helps it to point off the back foot
"145kmh, beaten for pace and bounce outside off. Bangs it in on back of length outside off, Mushfiqur chases and misses"
more confident foot work from Mushfiqur as he leans a bit into the ball outside off and drives it between point and cover point for three
"bit of extra bounce outside off, there's a bit of room and he helps it late to third man"
bit of forward lean on the off side and he pushes it into the off side
"oh he's <b>chopped on again</b>! Outside off from Ferguson, just enough room for the batsman to push it towards point or third man but Mushfiqur doesn't use his feet at all and stick his bat out, gets a thick inside edge and onto the stumps. Big relief for Taylor and Ferguson"
"short of a length and shaping away outside off, cut to sweeper"
"full and down at the pads, flicked with the angle to fine leg"
"full and down leg side, can't get bat on this"
"length on leg stump, dropped in front of midwicket with soft hands"

"short and wide outside off, cut to point's right but can't beat his leap"

<b>appeals</b> for catch behind are turned down and Mashrafe has reviewed it. No appeal from the keeper. Some sporadic ones from in front of the wicket - maybe two or three. Short ball outside off that he was looking to pull. Seemed to have climbed over the outside edge..and there's nothing on HotSpot.  Or Snicko. <b>They'll lose the review</b>
