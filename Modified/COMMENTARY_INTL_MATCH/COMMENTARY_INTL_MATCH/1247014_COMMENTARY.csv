"worked away to fine leg. Good pace from Shaheen, well into the mid 140s each delivery"
"angling into the stumps, driven across his body to mid-off. Looked like an lbw candidate for a brief moment"
"nice pick-up towards cow corner from Banton, more of a chip than a slog, and he picks up a couple to round out a tight over"
"lovely cover drive from Ayub; it was fast, a half-volley and Haris is lucky smart work in the covers means he only concedes the one"
"short of a length again, struck in the air towards square leg on the bounce"
poked into the offside and the pair are smart enough about their running to exchange ends
"timing the ball nicely, little jab towards midwicket. He's finding the fielders for now but good signs for the young Englishman"
"and there's the jinx, because of course it had to be! <strong>Banton horribly mishits one</strong>, a pull intended towards midwicket ends up taking the outer edge and sailing towards third man instead, where Ahmed Daniyal completes an easy catch"
defended to backward point to round out a successful over for Lahore
"tried to york him but the big man was down quickly! Slightly strays down leg and the Jamican flicks it past fine leg, absolutely speeds away for four"
"tried another york,er but a knee high full toss instead. Gayle works it to midwicket and gives Ayub the strike"
"<strong>rather extravagant shot from Ayub, went through it too early and it loops up to mid-on</strong>! Great start for Lahore Qalandars! 149kph from Shaheen but still found the bottom of Ayub's bat, with the teenager nowhere close to controlling his shot"
"Sarfaraz just opens the face of the bat and gets it fine enough to beat third man. Canny little shot from Sarfaraz, who knows how to manipulate the gaps so well"
"sumptuous from Sarfaraz, such a great timer of the ball. Slightly too full, and he works it away off the hips into midwicket. great start from the Quetta skipper"
"comes back with a bouncer that stings Sarfaraz's gloves. Eventful over, that"
"didn't get to the pitch of the ball, hit it slightly uppishly through the covers"
"leading edge from Gayle, which scooped up very high. Mid-on was in business, you thought, but it lands just short"
"struck on the pad, excitable appeal from Hafeez. Gayle struggled against him and glad to get off strike"

"pace off the ball, and Gayle couldn't find the timing as he tried to hammer it through the offside"
"quicker one on this occasion, and gets some zip off the pitch, too. 139kph, and the extra bounce means Gayle swings and misses"
"brilliant over, just one off it. Driven to mid-on"
opens the face and the pair exchange ends. Looks like that Hafeez over was just a one-off
takes a single to mid-off
rolls his wrists over it and works it down to square leg. Lahore won't mind conceding singles in the PP
"good pace, but it bounces a touch too high, and the umpire calls it a wide"
"lots of bottom hand, and he finally muscles one for four. Too full, Gayle clears the front leg and smacks that over mid-on to send it for a one-bounce boundary"
"smashed to deep midwicket, <strong>was that a catch?</strong> No, it bounced just short and looks like it's done some damage to poor Rashid Khan's fingers. He's grimacing, and walking off. Bit of a concern for the bowling side"
"majestic timing from Sarfaraz once more, driven back past Rauf and it hurtles away to the straight boundary. Strong finish from the Gladiators, but this has been very much Lahore's PP"
"in the slot, and Gayle doesn't care that the PP's done. In Gayle's arc, and he frees his arms and <strong>clobbers it in front of square for six</strong>"
"could comeback, followed him down the legside with the yorker. Dug out and he takes a single"
"full from Daniyal again, thick inside edge to fine leg"
"hits the top of the bat, <strong>but Gayle's been dropped at cow corner</strong>! Poor Daniyal looks distraight, what a first wicket that would have been. Had two bits at the cherry, but Agha Salman shells it"
"inside edge onto the pad, nearly went through the gate"
runs it down to third man. Ten off the over and a very costly drop
Sarfaraz dances down the wicket and pokes it to the onside. No run

"yorker to round out the over, worked away to midwicket. And Peter's coming in to take you thorugh to the end of the innings"
"<b>dropped! Oh what a simple chance on the deep midwicket boundary!</b> Good length ball on middle, Gayle heaves this flat to the man in the rope Salman Agha who runs in 10 yards and settles under it perfectly for a thigh height chance, it clangs in and out of his hands. 5/10 on difficulty for a boundary chance. Didn't come with a lot of heat on it. Had to be taken."

"too short again from Rashid on fourth stump, Gayle goes back and cranks this high and deep over long-on, Wiese leaps up at the rope in vain to try to knock it back but it cleared him by two yards. <strong>Gayle's first PSL 50 comes up in 32 balls, having been dropped multiple times. </strong>"

Goes to pull and a top edge swirls behind Dunk. The keeper tracks back 15 yards and takes a sharp catch (at least by this fielding innings' standards) over the shoulder in stride on the edge of the 30-yard ring."

"another slower ball, this time lands full on off stump, prodded into the off side."

Very difficult chance to be fair but nothing much is sticking in this innings in the field. </strong> Slower ball lands on a good length, Azam swats this flat over the bowler, it hangs in the air for Afridi to run across and dive full stretch, he got two hands to it at shin height and looked like it would stick but it just pops out. He slams his hands into the turf in frustration. 9/10 on difficulty. He did all the hard work just getting to the ball in the first place by covering 25 yards, and the easier part he bumbled."
"attempted yorker on the legs, flicked to deep midwicket and they take on the throw for the second."
"slower ball lands short on sixth stump at 114 kph, swats this flat to cow corner for a long single."
"another slower ball lands on a good length on the legs, flicked to wide long-on for a long single."
"length ball at 134 kph on off stump attempted slower ball offcutter, but it just sits up in a hitting zone to heave over wide long-on."
"full toss at knee height on off stump, should've gone for a boundary but swats this along the ground to deep midwicket for a single."
"attempted yorker jammed out to short third man, shy at the stumps at the striker's end is wide and Afridi mishandles it trying to collect, now grabbing at his hand in pain and the sloppy backup by Afridi allows them to pinch an overthrow."

"another yorker jammed into the legs, flicked out to long-on."
"attempted yorker lands full on the legs, flicked out to deep midwicket."
"length ball offcutter on off stump, Azam tries to heave this over long-on but mistimes it and it flutters toward Afridi charging in from the long-on rope. He covers 20 yards and slides on his knees to take this very well. Almost carbon copy chance on height to the ones dropped by Salman Agha earlier. Afridi made this one look straightforward."
"slower ball lands short on middle, pulled flat behind square for one."
"another slower ball lands short, pulled to wide long-on."
"wide yorker, perfectly directed on seventh stump, Nawaz can't jam this out to the off side."
another yorker stabbed out into extra cover.
"slower short ball lands on sixth stump at 108 kph, flat batted by Cutting to long-on, sliding stop on the rope by Afridi turns four into two."
"<strong>too good from Afridi, even better from Nawaz!</strong> Spears in the yorker on leg stump, Nawaz steps across with a premeditated paddle scoop/ramp with fine leg up in the ring and connects cleanly past that ring fielder to the rope."
"waist high full toss on fourth stump at 142 kph, freebie for Nawaz to swat anywhere, and he's got a hole in his bat as he swings through this. It just fizzed past the off stump bail."
"slower ball lands on a good length on off stump, hangs back to heave this over wide long-on for six. Afridi oversteps as well so a free hit is coming up! His foot landed beyond the line by a good two inches."
"bouncer on the stumps, cramps him for room going for the pull, top edge lands safely short of short fine leg, no real effort made to catch the ball as it was a free hit so a single would've been run regardless."

"<strong>brilliant from Haris Rauf. Yorker sends Ben Cutting's middle stump cartwheeling</strong>! 147kph, and the Australian's wild slog was nowhere near the ball"
"hung back in his crease and clobbered it to long-off, where David Weise collects on the bounce"
"takes the pace off it, and Nawaz cannily tucks it to midwicket and pushes Anwar to come back for two. Really good running"
"<strong>that's over waist height; it's a no-ball, and Nawaz has deposited that over square leg for six</strong>! Lahore Qalandars are losing the plot and Nawaz is playing a blinder of an innings here"
"misses the bat, but no worries, because it trickles down to the third man boundary for four leg byes! Quetta Gladiators have really grabbed the game by the scruff in these late stages"
"in the slot and Nawaz hammers it through the onside. He rushes back for two and makes it comfortably, and that is a glorious finish to a very prolific Quetta Gladiators innings. They finish with 31 in the final two overs, and Lahore need to chase 179. We'll see you back here in about 10 minutes."
block into the onside and Lahore sneak a single
driven through the offside
"thick outside edge to short third. Quetta do have a slip in, mind"

"nice off stump line, Sohail gets behind it and blocks"
angling in at pace and nearly went through him
"wicket-to-wicket to start, decent pace, not much swing at first glance"
driven through the covers
"that's the first boundary! Bit too much width on offer there from Hasnain, and at that pace Fakhar only needs to help it along, which he does"
drifts down the leg side. Hasnain hasn't quite found his radar just yet
"length ball at 141. Good bounce, too, got a little big on Fakhar and hits him high on the bat"
"that's exquisite! Fakhar is known for being a power hitter but that was lazy elegance at its best. Driven on the up, and Hasnain is punished for providing too much width again"

pulled away to fine leg first up
"back of a length, pushes him on the back foot, driven back to the bowler"
rolls his wrists over it to take a single to in front of square
"danced down the wicket, steered to midwicket and he scampered towards the non-striker's end. It's a direct hit, but Fakhar had his bat well grounded and there are no problems"

"miscued pull shot, goes straight to mid-off, and Shinwari ends a tidy over"
""
picked up off the hips and guided to square leg
"that was decent pace - 146 - but I'm afraid it's right in the slot for Fakhar Zaman. Length ball that sat up, and it's clobbered to cow corner for a boundary"
"short ball this time, and it gets the same results. Freed his arms and tonked that away to midwicket for another boundary"
uses the pace to guide it through the offside. He's timing the ball brilliantly at the moment
"low full toss to round out the over, and Lahore have started this chase brightly"
"over the wicket to the left-hander, a touch of seam movement away from him. He gets a single to short third"
"change of pace that Sohail doesn't quite adjust to. Another dot ball, and he's taking his time settling"
"nice little pickup off the hips from Sohail, which gives midwicket a bit of a chase. The pair come back for two"
"short and wide, but the bowler gets away with it. Crunched through point, but it's straight to the fielder. Either side and that had four written all over it"
"that's the issue with the field he's set, there's no offside protection. Slightly short and he's timed it through point, with the ball racing away to the boundary"
bit of a wild slog outside off to finish the over
"loosener to start from around the wicket. Tailing down the leg side, and he rolls his wrists to tuck it past short fine leg for four"
chrages down and places it to cover-point
"slashed over short third man. It was a poor delivery again, but it still needed putting away, and Sohail does that to perfection. Up and over the ring fielder, and Sohail looks like he's getting some touch back"
opens the face to cover-point. Straight to the man though
tucks it to midwicket with a wristy flick. Saim Ayub had some work to do on the boundary and Sohail picks up another couple

nudged into the onside for a single
wrong'un. Fakhar attempted to run it past third man but is beaten
opens the face but this time guides it to the man at 45
wonderfully placed. Read the googly early and slashes it through point. Sarfaraz felt Azam Khan could have put in a dive
"too short, and glorious timing from Fakhar once more. He had plenty of time and it was carved through extra cover to allow the opener to pick up another boundary"
Single to round off another really productive over for Lahore
Fakhar is capitalising on any width really smartly. Guides it through backward point and picks up another couple
punched down the ground for a single
guided back to the bowler. Sharp work from Nawaz prevents the pair from rotating the strike
"gets some turn and beats Sohail all ends up. Even Sarfaraz spilled it, so he's fortunate there wasn't a nick"
driven back to Nawaz. Tody over so far
finishes with a dot
a quick single in the in-field. Sarfaraz is getting a little excitable as the pressure mounts
"slightly back of a length, and a backfoot punch to sweeper covers fetches a single"
"had a heave at that, did Fakhar., Went down on one knee and swept, only to find it hitting his pads. Big appeal, but the umpire's not interested"
"<strong>Sohail Akhtar falls to a wonderful googly!</strong>That's a proper legspinner. Gave it flight and ripped it through the air. Deceived Sohail, who left a huge gap between bat and pad, and a stuttering innings from the Lahore captain comes to an end"
flighted and hit through the air first up by Hafeez. Long-off collects on the bounce
dot ball to extra cover rounds off a successful over for Zahid

"half-volley, but Hafeez's drive only finds the mid-off fielder"
"tucked down to long-on, with the fielder just pushed back, for a single"

"<strong>dropped at deep midwicket! Goodness what a dreadful game by both sides in the field. Saim Ayub this time! </strong> Length ball on fourth stump, slogged flat to Ayub's left, he tracks 10 yards to his left and settles himself in stride to clutch at this across his body to his left at waist height, fumbles it very badly. On par with the horror of Salman Agha's drops in the first innings, although Agha had to dive for both of his. Ayub was upright, 4/10 on difficulty, had to be taken at this level."
good length ball swatted through the ring and placed well for a pair.
"fullish length on fourth stump, driven along the ground to long-on."
"fullish length ball on sixth stump, Hafeez shuffles across trying to flick/ramp this over fine leg, but it's too full for the shot and goes under the bat."
"goes for wide yorker, but gets the length wrong and Hafeez makes him pay! In the slot on sixth stump, smokes a glorious extra cover drive that sails flat over the rope by 20 yards. To make matters worse, Shinwari has overstepped... barely. Extremely harsh call from the umpire. Argument could be made that he had something behind the line when he landed. Regardless, a free hit to come."
length ball sits up on fifth stump for Hafeez to muscle past extra cover with a vicious thump. Sarfaraz gives Shinwari a piece of his mind afterward. Last legal ball costs the Gladiators 11 runs.

"full length ball on middle, pulls out the three-wood again to drive this cleanly over wide long-on for another six."

"wide yorker, scuffed out again this time into the leg side."
"slower bouncer on the stumps at 122 kph, goes to pull and top edges this into no man's land in vacant midwicket in the ring."
"another attempted wide yorker, driven to extra cover, sloppy misfield by Nawaz turns a dot into a single."
"starts with a slower ball, Fakhar welcomes him back by carving him over long-off for six. Too full with the delivery on fifth stump, enough width to free the arms. Sarfaraz just dips his head and says nothing. Saving his vitriol for the locals apparently."
"full toss at thigh height, slapped straight down the ground and they scamper back for a sharp second."
"goes for wide yorker, but Fakhar is too too good for this. Was really trying to just jam this out through point but he smothers it very hard into the turf for the bounce to clear backward point on the ring and go to the rope."
"length ball on the stumps, mishits this through square leg for one."
"the Professor is giving quite a tutorial today in driving proficiency. Full and wide, almost on the guideline, effortless drive sliced high over cover, sails 15 yards over the rope."

"wide yorker on sixth stump, jammed out with an open face to deep third man, tumbling stop on the rope."
"goes for yorker, lands it full on fourth stump, jammed out through mid-on."
"<strong>dropped! Again! This was very tough to be fair, Tom Banton the culprit this time running back from cover on the ring. </strong> It was full on leg stump, tried to flick this over midwicket, leading edge is skied over extra cover from the ring. Banton covers 15 yards trying to catch this over the shoulder. He gets there in stride and looked settled under it but it bursts through his fingertips. 7/10 on difficulty. No matter the degree of toughness, everything seems to be going down in this match."
"attempted yorker on middle, lands full and driven to extra cover on the rope."
"length ball lands wide on sixth stump, goes to pull and drags this through square leg."
"length ball on fifth stump, sits up for Hafeez to smoke over midwicket, splits deep midwicket and long-on boundary riders perfectly."

"Hafeez doffs his university commencement cap! Overpitched on middle searching for the yorker, doesn't get the length right, Hafeez smokes a drive flat over the non-striker's stumps that whistles past the umpire to the rope."
"drags the length back on the stumps, another back of a length ball sits up for him to swivel and heave flat high and deep over midwicket."
"slower ball lands too short on fifth stump, pulls this gently to deep midwicket."
"full on fourth stump, driven firmly but straight to mid-off."
"<strong>another drive by Hafeez to the rope appropriately finishes it. </strong> In the slot wide on sixth stump, leans forward and smokes this flat over extra cover. Whistles away to end it. The teams shake hands. Gayle wants to have a look at The Professor's bat. Even though Gayle made 68, he's a bit envious of what Hafeez did out there just now. What a performance, arguably overshadowing Fakhar who ended with nine more runs that Hafeez but the Professor seals a nine-wicket win with 10 balls to spare."
