"poor delivery. Gives it too much air and ends up bowling a full toss, also gives Mendis all the width he wants to gift-wrap it to Mendis who reaches out and drives wide of extra cover. Bottom hand comes off, so no entirely in control of it but the timing is good enough to carry it to the boundary"
"fuller ball, presses forward and blocks"
"short and wide, cut square of the wicket, sweeper cover runs across and slides to his right to pull it back and keep it down to a brace. Great effort, just in front of the boundary"

"short and sliding into middle and leg, swivels back and pulls it down to fine leg"
"<b> top edge, a swirler and all the way! </b> Got lucky, bigtime. This was an excellent short ball, Gunathilaka completely beaten for pace but he goes through with the pull. This one was a curving and swirling with the heavy wind, Masakadza never looked settled at fine leg. He also had to be mindful of the ropes. In the end, he could only watch the ball swerve away."

"yorker on leg stump, squeezed out to square leg"
"short of good length ball, Gunaratne again has to contend with a serious lack of pace. Besides, he has to fetch it from outside off so had to entirely rely on his power. Finds the top edge that is held at deep midwicket"
"shot. Short of a length ball, angled in and Tharanga backs away and uses the pace to steer it fine of third man for four"
"very full on leg, clipped out through midwicket"
"slower short ball, ducks early and then puts the bat up to pull it away to deep fine leg"
"fuller ball, sprayed down the leg side. Misses the attempted clip, optimistic appeal from the keeper but there was no bat involved. Zimbabwe have gone up for a review. Hang on, does not seem like a wide. No bat definitely but it seems like the ball has brushed the pad. Not out is the call and the wide call has been taken back as well"

"floats this length ball on middle and leg, worked wide of midwicket as they scamper back for the second"
"looks to whip this to square leg, gets it off the thigh pad, deflects to fine leg"
<b> Malinga has made a right royal mess at third man. </b> This was steered using the pace. Malinga couldn't have asked for an easier stop. This was coming straight to him but he didn't bend down fully. Bursts through his hands to the boundary ropes.
"crisp drive but back to Malinga, who stops this on his followthrough this time"
"banged in short on middle and leg, this flies over Masakadza's head. Wide called and rightly so"
"slower and fuller on middle, Masakadza deadbats that"
punches the length ball back to the bowler. Once again curled away just a wee bit
"dreadful shot to a loose delivery that should've been whacked for four. Masakadza was way too early into the pull as he gloved this down leg side to the keeper. <b> Oh, hang on. </b> The umpire's are having a look. This could be a no-ball. Looks like there was just about a millimetre behind the crease at the point of impact. Very, very close."
"looks to dig a yorker-length delivery angled across, misses."
flicked into the gap between midwicket and mid-on. Excellent running. Great balance as he put away that half-volley on the pads quite easily.
"rip roaring bouncer angled across at over 140 kph, Ervine sways out of the way, just whizzed past the grille off the helmet. Keeper was airbone as he collected that in front of his face"

"just manages to flick this over midwicket. Slow, dipping full toss. Through with the stroke early, got it off the toe-end of the bat"
has he gloved this? One bouncer for the over. Looks to take him on with the hook shot but was beaten for pace. Whizzed past the glove. Malinga working up some pace
"he's smashed this into the midwicket boundary at the rate of knots. Little too predictable. Too short, Mire was ready for the pull and got hold of it superbly. Square leg umpire was in the firing line and had to take evasive action"

plays outside the line of a length ball to defend one off the inner part of the bat
excellent stop at midwicket. Flicked superbly though. Malinga gets away with a juicy half-volley

no feet movement. Just looks to smash this over point from the crease but is beaten for pace
"right behind the line of the length ball on middle, defended to mid-on"
"full and sliding down  leg, he sweeps and misses. What's happened here? Dickwella has effected a stumping, a very late stumping. But was the ball dead? Both umpires checking. There's no soft signal from Ian Gould, who is also a keeper. He waited and waited for Mire to walk out of the crease before breaking the bails. But at the point of the bails coming off, his backfoot was inside. Not sure Mire knew where the ball was, though."
"sharp turn as the ball spins back in to beat the inside edge and hit Mire on the pad. Ball would've taken it down leg, the umpire signals"
excellent diving stop at short fine keeps the paddle down to a single
"through with the sweep way too early, looked to fetch it from way outside off. The length wasn't there for the sweep anyway. Beaten"

right behind the line of the short of length ball as he defends
"ducks under the short ball on middle and leg, whizzes through to the keeper"
sweeps and misses. Is he blindly swinging them? Looked to play it with the spin but once again this spun back in sharply to hit the pad
"sharp turn once again, he stabs outside the line and works this with the spin. Fails to roll his wrists, so this is in the air for a while. The short leg fielder Kusal Mendis stays low and rides the bounce, moves low to his left <b> but there's a big gap between his fingers as the ball pops in. </b> Shadow underneath the ball at one point. Even if it didn't hit the ground, it's so hard to give these out. Benefit of doubt always to the batsman. Looked like the fielder scooped it off the ground in a split-second, so he would've have known either."

"touch short, he rocks back and punches this into the gap at sweeper cover"
"makes room to pull, readjusts to punch this down to mid-on instead"
"this was just a matter of time. Both batsmen were completely in a tangle against spin. Ervine looks to sweep this and gets across a long way to play the shot, had to hit it against the stiff breeze. Didn't get any power behind the shot as it lobbed straight to the man stationed at deep backward square leg."
"walks across the stumps, exposes all three, and plays the lap sweep down towards fine leg"
looked to reverse sweep but played too early. The ball lobbed off his forearm to the slip fielder. The umpire raised the finger even before the appeal finished. Mire reckons there was no bat or glove before it hit the forearm. Correct decision in the end. <b> Decision overturned </b>

"slow turn into middle, defended from the crease."

"drifting into middle and leg, defended off the backfoot"
"sharp turn from middle, worked across the line. Lazy effort from the man coming in from deep midwicket. Excellent running. Gunaratne the culprit"
"picked the bones out of that one. Too fast, too full and into the pads, swept fiercely into the deep square leg boundary. Delightful timing and placement"
"too full and sliding down leg, paddled fine. Malinga does a dash across from deep backward square to pull it back in with his boot at fine leg."
"this one pitches outside off and skids on, Williams played for the turn and is beaten"

"full, angled across,left alone outside off"
"direct hit at the non-striker's end. The umpire refers this upstairs. He has made his ground quite easily.

"this time the reverse sweep is a lot finer, to the right of Malinga at point. No chance of him getting to it as it's well wide of him"
"what kind of a field so you set for such shots? Aponso is trying to bowl to the field with a sweeper cover in place and pitches it up outside off. Doesn't matter, Mire fetches a sweep from outside off and middles it beautifully to send it screaming into the deep square leg boundary"
