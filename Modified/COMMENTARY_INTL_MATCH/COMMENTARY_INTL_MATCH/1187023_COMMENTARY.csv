"leading edge that rolls to mid-off, quick single taken"
"there's the edge and Rohit's gone, much to the relief of the West Indies. This was much-needed. Holder bowls a length ball, this one bounces touch more than Rohit expects, kisses the edge as the ball darts away and the edge is pouched nicely by Hope."

flayed on the up to sweeper point
"bunts this down to third man, you'd think he was cramped for room, but Kohli still managed to manufacture a single"

"not in control of this pull, no timing, down to deep square"
"short of length outside off, invitation there for the slash or upper cut, Rahul lets it go"
"he's gloved this to the keeper! This is pure pace from Alzarri, skids through the pitch to hurry Rahul into the attempted tuck off his hips, lobs to the leg side and Hope takes a dolly. He's missed a hundred for the taking, will be mighty disappointed but let's acknowledge a fine knock that could give the team management plenty of selection headaches when Dhawan gets fit again."

runs it down to third man for an easy single
eased to third man for another single
"attempted short ball but this doesn't rise as much as he expected, just about evades Iyer as he ducks"
"not sure what he was trying to do. Backed away and slashed at this to get a thick outside edge, third man runs over the ball"
"has he found the fielder? Yes, he has. Iyer has whipped this straight down the throat of fine leg. Alzarri is claiming the catch. Short ball angling into the body, Iyer hops across and tries to help it along. He's rushed into the stroke because of the pace on the delivery and Alzarri takes a good, low catch. So he can't get a fifth straight half-century in ODIs"

"short of a length and just outside off, mistimed pull to midwicket"

"short of a length outside off, defended to point off the back foot"
forces him to duck the bouncer. He shuffles into the off side and that forces him to get under this and let it go

slower short ball at leg stump. Pulled along the floor to fine leg
"length outside off, driven on the up to mid-off"

"length on off stump, pushed to point from the crease"
aaaand picks the gap again.Doesn't waste those loose balls in chases. Low full toss on the pads and he stays still and uses his wrists to bisect fine leg and deep square

"<b>bowled him!</b> Jadhav has played all around this one and that is a boisterous salute from Cottrell, timed in sync with the fireworks at the ground. This is an overpitched ball.

<b>down leg and past the keeper.</b> Overpitched and too much for both Jadeja and Shai Hope
<b>nearly run out with a kick.</b> Short of a length slower ball dropped pitch side on the off side. Cottrell v Kohli on the sprint. They're neck and neck until Cottrell unleashes a big right boot. Direct hit would have got Kohli

"length outside off, pushed to extra cover"
<b>whips it to the midwicket boundary!</b> Pierre's natural trajectory and pace just feeds this Kohli favourite - length and fast and angled into him. He picks it up from outside off and sends it racing between long-on and deep midwicket

"full outside off, leans in and drives to mid-off"
"bouncer in the corridor, gets very steep. Too much for him to go through with the hook"
<b>lofted over extra cover!</b> This has been very mature so far from Jadeja. Using the safe boundary options. This was an overpitched ball very wide outside off. Expands his arms and drills it

"slower length ball at off stump, shuffles and pushes into the midwicket region with soft hands"
"whew, some serious timing on these Jadeja pull shots. Short in the corridor and this is pummeled to deep square's right. Pooran does superbly to stop to his right"

"<b>plays it on!</b> Keemo Paul injecting life into this contest every time he comes on! It is an innocuous delivery though, not unlike the one that got Pant. Length and wide outside off. Drives away from the body and it pings off the inside edge. He missed one trying that against Holder not so long ago. This time he doesn't have that fortune. Kohli falls short of the finish line"
<b>hello!</b> Thakur with an absolute world class drive through the covers. Stunning shot. Length outside off and he he whips out at it and gives no one a chance

"length on off stump, punched on the rise to long-off"

"length and in at middle stump, tapped to deep midwicket"
slower short ball outside off. Spanked on the up to deep midwicket
"<b>run out appeal</b> but surely Thakur has been let off by mid-off. Full ball on off, driven firmly to mid-off. Thakur takes off and is sent back from about halfway up the pitch, slipped on his backside and had no chance. Except....the fieler decides to lob it back to the bowler and it is high and not useful at all. Thakur comes back"
<b>calmly done.</b> Slower bouncer down leg side. Allows that to come on and watches closely before nudging this fine
"length outside off, leans in and punches to sweeper's left with some elegance. Got his weight nicely into that and picked up two to <b>tie the scores</b>"
"full on middle stump, drilled straight to mid-on and this time it's Thakur saying no to the run"
<b>run out appeal is sent upstairs</b> but the TV umpire has said that Keemo Paul has overstepped. <b>Thakur had made his ground anyway.</b> It was a length ball pushed into the leg side and the underarm throw hit the striker's stumps
