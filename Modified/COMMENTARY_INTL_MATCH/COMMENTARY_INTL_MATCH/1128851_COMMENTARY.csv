"another appeal, but a stifled one. Went for the pull but was hit on the right thigh. Impact was just on off. Islamabad chose to review, replays confirm this would've gone on to hit middle and off. This was a zooter that Shadab didn't quite execute as well as he would've liked, but it doesn't matter because he's got the wicket. <b> Decision overturned </b>"

Buut he dived dull length forward and ensured it was a soft landing with the ball not bobbing out despite his elbows hitting the turf."

"this is a superman effort from superman Chris Jordan. You will not see catches better than that. This is magnificent. Short ball, skiddy ball on middle stump, Shadab looks to go through with the pull but hits hit high on the bat. Jordan at mid-on ran to his right but this was dying on him, and so he dived full stretch to his right to pluck that. Hasan Ali gave Shadab a send-off too, not sure that was needed but there's life in this game and how."

"length on middle and leg, tucked to fine leg"
"<b> Kamran Akmal has put down a skier running backwards. Dropped! </b> What's worse is that the ball has gone to the boundary, overthrows as well.

The fine leg fielder Gul ran in to throw, no one backing up, and that went away to the boundary."
