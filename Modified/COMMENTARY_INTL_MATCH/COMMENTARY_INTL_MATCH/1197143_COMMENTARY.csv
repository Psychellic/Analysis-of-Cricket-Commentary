"eased down to long on, one more"
hurled a bit too far down the leg side now
"<b>confusion!</b> Mushfiqur flicks to square leg, Shakib calls for the single and sets off. It's his call, but Mushfiqur says no. Shakib turns and dives back to the crease. Tension in the middle"

"<b>chipped down Williams' throat!</b> What kind of a shot was this? Shakib leaned forward and checked his drive at a full ball, lobbing it softly out to Williams at long off. He barely had to move, just walking in a few metres from the rope. There was no power at all behind the shot. Burl can't believe his luck. And Zimbabwe have another one!"

"a touch wide, but his dabbed cut goes straight to short third man"
"straighter this time, and he's picked off the pads for a single"

"he backs away before the ball is delivered, but Ndlovu follows him and he can only flick to midwicket, in the deep"

"quick and flat, on his pads, and it's glanced to deep midwicket"

"flicked off the toes, just the one"
"Mushfiqur jumps down but Williams spots him, pulling his length back. Dabbed to third man"

"and now he aims wide of off, ripping one past Mushfiqur, who had backed away to leg"
"on the drive now, down to long off. Sharp work from Burl keeps them to one"

"very full, on his toes, and he's flicked out to deep midwicket"

"attempted switch hit, but the ball fizzes past him into Taylor's gloves"
"nicely bowled, full and straight. Tino also fields well off his own bowling, diving across towards mid on"

"legbreak, a touch wide outside off, but the cover sweeper cleans up and keeps them to one"
"cutter to start, but it goes <i>just</i> down the leg side. If Mahmdullah had stayed in his normal position, he would probably have glanced that, but he'd walked across to the off side"

"legbreak, wide outside off, and it's fetched down to long on with a bit of an ungainly swipe"
"<b>beaten</b>, outside off, by another legbreak. It was the bounce that did it"
"<b>gone this time!</b> Excellent work by Taylor behind the stumps. Mushfiqur swipes across the line at another one that bursts off a length, getting a thin top edge. The ball bounces up at Taylor, who parries it to his left and then grasps it at the second attempt. A difficult chance, but he's held on"

"another full toss, outside off, and it's slugged down to long off"

"another full toss, on his legs, and it's swatted into the leg side. They hurry back for the second."
"legcutter, outside off, and Mahmudullah is up to all sorts of tricks in the crease. He sets himself for a paddle-scoop, then moves across to off for a reverse. In the end the ball rushes past him outside off"
"<b>short, and pulled into the stands!</b> This time he stayed still in the crease, rocking back and slugging a muscular pull well over the rope to <b>bring up his fifty</b>"
"fuller this time, and he's on the drive down to long on"
"<b>edged, and caught!</b> Afif steps to leg, making room, and aims a flashing drive into the covers. But he has to reach for it, and ends up feathering an edge through to Taylor, who tumbles to his left to hold on"
"slower legcutter, outside off at 113km/h, and it's cracked to point"
"<b>picked up over fine leg!</b> This wasn't such a bad delivery, Mpofu slightly missing his mark attempting a yorker. It slipped out as a low full toss, dipping in towards his toes, but Mahmudullah got down low to lift it cleanly over fine leg"
"another low full toss, chipped down to long off"
"nicely bowled, a yorker on middle, but excellent running brings two as it's dug out to long on"
"<b>another full toss, and he picks out the fielder!</b> Mahmudullah was aiming for the stands beyond midwicket, but couldn't get enough on it, picking out Williams near the rope. The umpires want to have another look at this, as the full toss was quite high ... but replays show it was dipping just under waist height, and he's got to go."
"<b>action replay!</b> Another high full toss, another swipe into the leg side, and he gets more height than distance to pick out the fielder. With two rank full tosses, Jarvis is on a hat-trick!"
"not this time, as he digs this one in short and it's pulled off the front foot, down to long on. Again they take on the fielder for the second run. Should he have gone for another high full toss?"
