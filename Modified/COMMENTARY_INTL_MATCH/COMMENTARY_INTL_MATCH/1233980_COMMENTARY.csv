"clobbered! Length ball angling in, Allen shuffles across and whips it away to deposit this over deep midwicket. Clean strike. Has nailed this off the middle of the bat"
"how much height? So much height. So high that you could've driven from Auckland to Hamilton. Mahmudullah at mid-on moved to his right, got into position but somehow was on the move as this descended and <strong>put it down.</strong> That was really, really hard."
"looks to wallop this pull, hit high on the body but they scoot through for a leg bye"
clears his front leg and belts this up and over the ropes. Went so high that the fielder in the deep had all the time in the world to leap over the hoardings and catch that if he wanted to. Not the kind of welcome Taskin would've liked. Massive
"nice and full on off, punched to mid-off for a quick single"
"mistimes this hoick, but this is an excellent catch at square leg. Naim had to wait an eternity for that to come down, but he kept his eyes on the ball, watched it lodge right in as he took the catch with his palms facing the sky."
tucks this through square leg to get off the mark
cramped for room as he bunts this to point for a quick single
"<strong>extra bounce off a length to rap him on the glove!</strong> Conway withering in pain as he tries to get out of the way, ball lobs into the gully region as he spontaneously takes off for a risky single. Could've so easily been run-out at the bowler's end"
works this down to long-on
<strong>beaten by a lifter!</strong> This one took off as well. Conway was looking to ride the bounce and steer it to third man
"steps out and lofts through the line to clear mid-off, the ball plonks just before the ropes but they'll pinch a third. Not timed as well as he would've liked, got more elevation than distance"
beaten as he looks to wallop this flick behind square leg. Wide called as it was down leg
"length ball on middle and leg, tucked between square leg and midwicket"
"low full toss, belts this straight to the edge of the ring at cover where a misfield allows them to take a single"

punched straight to mid-off as he gets through for a single
"<b> brilliant catch at short fine! Taskin, you beauty! </b> This is full on the pads, Guptill looks to play the pick up shot but gets it off a thick inside edge. This flies nonetheless and Taskin throws himself to his left to pluck this one-handed stunner. He's surprised that it stuck, don't think he can still believe he caught that. Bangladesh have a second, Guptill walks off in utter disbelief."
"Got him! Deep square takes a dolly as Conway goes now, Bangladesh roaring back. He's looking to whip this away but the ball bounces extra to leap off a top-edge. Easy catch"

"big appeal as he's struck on the pad sweeping. Went a long way outside off. <strong>Bangladesh ain't interested in the review.</strong> Impact in line? 50-50 really, should've gone up."

"full at off stump, exposes the stumps and drills a drive straight to sweeper cover"
"<b>survived a run out chance at the non-strikers!</b> Phillips looks to slog this arm ball into the leg side, it floats pitch side on the leg side and Young takes off, and has to turn after getting halfway. The keeper's throw misses. Would have been out by a long way"

"full on off stump, inside edge onto pad on the sweep"

"slows it down on a length outside off, beaten on the slog sweep"
"full at leg stump, hurriedly clipped to short fine"
"<b>got him!</b> Fantastic comeback from Mahedi after that first ball. Changed up his pace and had him in all sorts of trouble. Steps out to this loopy length ball outside off, doesn't get to the pitch and is forced to swipe all over it. Young's struggle ends"
"length and sliding into the stumps, hangs deep in the crease and shovels to long-on"
"oh that is unreal! He's skipped onto the back foot and <i>cut</i> him over the extra cover boundary! Typically a shot you see against the new ball, against pace, in a powerplay. He's managed to clobber that off a spinner. Sensational"
"short of a length outside off, jags away and beats the outside edge as he looks to swish away from the body"
"short outside off, gets on top of the bounce and pulls to deep square's right"
"full and just outside off, looks to drive through the off side. Gets an inside edge that the bowler has taken in the follow through. <b>And he appeals for a catch.</b> The umpires have sent it upstairs with a soft signal not out. Checking if that pinged off the batsman's shoe. It did - but it bounced before. Decent shout from the bowler"
"low full toss outside off, punched out to long-off"
"short and wide outside off, springs up and slashes at that. Thick outside edge sails over short third man"

"length at off stump, check-drive, aerially towards long-off"
"full on middle stump, driven to long-on"

"length at middle stump, punched off the back foot to long-on"
"yorker length at leg stump, flicked out to deep midwicket. <b>A late call from upstairs for no-ball.</b> Free hit for Mitchell"

"<b>misfield</b> at deep backward square. Nice yorker at the toes, he digs it out off the inside edge. Naim lets that slip after a sprint to the right. Recovers and manages to pull it back in before the line"
slams it in at a hard length and cramps him on the back foot. All he can do is defend into the off side
"<b>another misfield.</b> Same area, different fielder. This is full and tailing in at leg stump. Stands tall and looks to blaze it straight. Thick inside edge to fine leg's left. Looks like Saif there with the fumble"
"<b>another slip for Saif!</b> This time at sweeper cover, but it's in his sight as he throws it back in. That was drilled at him"
"short outside off, cut to deep extra's left and Saif puts in a neat pick-up-and-throw"
"<b>high full toss sent long over deep backward square!</b> That's a full toss at about thigh height, slipping out of the bowler's hands. A clean, free swing for Phillips"
"full at leg stump, swipes that away to deep midwicket's right and comes back for the second that brings up a <b>27-ball fifty</b>"

"tossed up at leg stump, leans in and flicks wide of deep midwicket"
"yorker into the stumps, digs it out pitch side"
"swiped between deep midwicket and long-on. Attempted slower ball, it appears. Short of a length and sitting up nicely for the pull. Gets it off the front foot"
clubbed to the deep midwicket boundary! This is overpitched and into his swing at leg stump. Half a stride and full intent to put that away. Not quite off the middle but hit well enough

mistimes this slog across the line to midwicket
punches this straight to point
"sliced over the infield, down to sweeper cover"
"<b> he's picked out the lone man in the deep. </b> The pull isn't timed well and Phillips, diving forward, has taken an excellent catch at deep square. Liton backed away to pull but the ball skidded through faster, catching him off guard, and so the timing wasn't right with that one and he has to go."
"overpitched and drilled through extra cover! Loose and he was up for it, couldn't have asked for a better delivery first up"
"<strong>raw pace, pure pace! Beaten.</strong> Hustles through at 145kph. Yorker-length and angling away, late on the shot, beaten"
"beaten by one that nips away! Soumya late on the shot, beaten for pace once again"
"beaten as he looks to help this over the slip cordon, this one at 147kph"

"swing and a miss. Looking to slog this over the covers, into the stroke too early"
"lovely timing! Uses the pace and a hint of width to glide this behind point, raced away"

bunts it into the off side for a quick single
steered down to third man
"beaten as he reaches out to cut, slipped out of Sodhi's hand possibly"
cut away to sweeper cover
"reverse-swept over short third! So adventurous. Sodhi went full outside leg, Soumya changed stance and hit him fearlessly"
"big mow! This is way back into the stands at deep midwicket. Too much flight on middle, Soumya right underneath the flight as he muscled it away"
"goes, gets another one! Tossed up a touch wider, Soumya anticipates that, shuffles across and gives it a whack! Terrific stuff"
punched down to long-on
beaten by this flipper that skids across
"full and into middle stump from around the wicket, clears the front leg and swishes across the line. A thick inside edge sprints out to the square leg boundary"
"<b>pumped over point!</b> Some shot, this. <B>And it's a no-ball for overstepping!</b> This is short and rising in the corridor. He backs into the leg side to make room and sends it far away with this upper cut"

"full at leg stump, backs away and drives to extra cover"
"<B>oh Phillips nearly pulls off a blinder!</b> Full at leg stump, steps out and toe-ends his slog. It goes high and hangs in front of Phillips running in from deep midwicket. He sprints some 20 yards and dives forward a few more - full stretch. Gets two hands on it but can't keep that in. Dropped perhaps because he was...too athletic?! He was moving at some pace there"
