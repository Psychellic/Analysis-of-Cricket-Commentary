"wide outside off, a nice sighter for Cook who leaves well alone"
slightly tighter line but still no need to lay bat on ball
"oof, that's the line! Morkel honing in on the top of that off stump from round the wicket and Cook does very well not to nibble as the ball zips past his edge"
"down the leg side and a fine one-handed take from de Kock, as the ball kisses Cook's thigh-pad"
"outside off, and genuinely beaten by a combination of pace, bounce and movement. Lovely ball"
"another ripper. That's an outstanding welcome to the Test match - full again, and exploding off the deck to beat a flimsy push"
"and good morning to you too, Mr Jennings. Outside off and beaten"
half-forward and an ironic cheer as England lay bat on ball for the first time this Test
"on the pads, sweetly clipped, through backward square to open England's account"
"tentatively forward, bat and pad together, loops off the pad flap off a fat inside edge, and <B>dropped</B> by a despairing Rabada, galloping forward in his followthrough, reminiscent of Devon Malcolm v Gary Kirsten at The Oval in 1994 ... but a different result this time... what price a short leg?"
uneasily onto the front foot
"fended away, so nearly another failure for Jennings... can he make this one count?"
squeezed into the leg side off the back foot
"outside off, welcome respite from decision-making"
"on the back foot, squeezed into the gully"
"raps the pad to loud acclaim, but clearly sliding down"
"pushed back into the crease, and worked to the leg side"
"another ambitious appeal, as Morkel angles the ball into Cook's pads from round the wicket. Needs to straighten it appreciably to get any joy there"
tucked off the pads through midwicket
"beats the outside edge, albeit with a slightly ballooning delivery that hops rather than bursts off the pitch"
forward and patted back down the pitch
"ambitious appeal again, full length as the pads are struck, but that looked both to be going over, and potentially outside leg"
"big jag off the seam from outside leg to off, that went like a fast offbreak, and clipped the outside edge as it went through. Played down into the pitch"
zipping across the left-hander's bows. Through to the keeper
"up on the toes, a touch of width, punched through point for Cook's first runs of the Test"
"full length, zeroing in on Cook's shins, and fended into the leg side"
"outside off, leaping bounce off the seam but from a wide line. No stroke offered"
forward and defended
"pushed deep into the crease, strikes the pad flap. Good aggression from a full and attacking length"
"full again, Cook leans into the drive, but inside-edges into his legs. Streaky, and a sign of the pressure being applied"
fenced into the off side
"standing tall on the back foot, punched to the leg side"
forward and blocked  back down the pitch
"swings late, down the leg side, another fine-handed take from de Kock"
"outside off, left alone"
"short, ducked. over"
"overpitched, in the slot, a genuine half-volley, met with a measured full face, all along the ground through mid-off. Shot"
"on the back foot, squelched into the leg side with a complete disregard for aesthetics, but finds the middle of the bat to pinch the single"
"outside off, angling in, left alone, as Jennings aligns himself to Morkel for the first time today. And vice versa"
blocked into the off side with a half-stride
"outside off, through to the keeper"
"sliding into the pads, rolls up the flap, onto the back of the bat and away to relative safety. Not a chance at such, but another reason to consider a short-leg..."
"outside edge, played with soft hands into the cordon"
blocked
"stout defence on the back foot, protecting the off stump for all it is worth"
"punched into the covers with minimal footwork, bat flipping into the line of the ball with the mechanical determination of a pinball machine"
"outside off, too short, slapped through backward point. That's well timed and placed"
"up on the toes, pushed into the off side"
"short and woolly, Jennings swings across the line and fails to make contact. And so ends the debate about his three in three!"
"full length, exploding off the pitch and beats the edge. Well bowled"
"outside off, and through to the keeper"
"short and wide, slammed through point for a very welcome boundary"
"tighter line, through to the keeper"
loose drive from a full length
"another beauty, tight line, full length, beating the edge as Cook just about plays inside the line"
sliding down leg
"through to the keeper, that's a very good leave on length as the ball passes over the top of off"
"tight defence on the back foot, pushed into the off side"
"full length, Cook jabs down late and steals a brace through square leg off a fat inside edge"
"back and across, blocked back down the pitch"
"full once again, swinging in late and striking the back leg, but pitches outside the line"
"well played, reward for patience as Olivier serves up a half-volley outside off, and is punished through the covers"
"hanging back in the crease, defended into the off side"
into line to defend again
"outside off, no stroke offered"
"over-pitched once again, a solid push back down the line of the ball. Calm accumulation"
"short, sharp, Cook flaps into a pull, gloves it over the keeper's head and away to the fence! De Kock leaps but doesn't get close ... another fine bouncer to one of the better players of the short ball in England's ranks..."
"more circumspect, onto the front foot to block"
"outside off, blocked into the off side"
"squirted into the leg side, half-forward"
pushed to the off side
pushed to cover
"there it is! The edge finally comes, another good length delivery, Jennings is half-forward without conviction, a standard snick and into the keeper's gloves."
"outside off, zips off the seam, a pleasing sighter for Westley, reminiscent of his first ball in Test cricket at The Oval last week"
"banged in short, zips through as Westley lines it up and pulls his gloves inside the line"
"well bowled, lovely shape from a full length, curls past the outside edge as Westley covers his off stump"
"banged in short, ducked"
"flicked firmly off the toes, half-stopped at short midwicket, but he jogs through for his first run all the same"
"through to the keeper, wide of off stump"
"nips off the seam, sliding down as Westley is rapped on the back leg"
through to the keeper once again
through to the keeper once again
"blimey, that did everything and nothing! Big jag off the seam, into the thigh pad, away to the cordon, past the diving de Kock, into Amla's hands at first slip ... then out again. But no bat involved, so on we go!"
Cripes! Westley is living a charmed life as this one bounces down into the crease and over the top of the stumps...
"lovely delivery, banging out that same line and length and letting the pitch do the work. Nibbles past the edge"
through to the keeper with less drama
"wonderful timing as Cook meets the fuller length with a dead-straight bat, and that whistles past the bowler, stumps and away to the rope"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
"on the pads, clipped backward of square for another single"
"through to the keeper, a hint of outswing, left alone"

"length ball around the line of off, Cook defends square from the crease"
"nipping away, fractionally back of a length and Westely can watch it through"
"pitched up, this swings away appreciably but early enough for the batsman to size it up and leave"
"pitched up and curling away, full but wide of the stumps and left"
"in the channel, probing on a length, no stroke"
"ah, that's the line, 85mph and holding its line, gets Westley reaching forward and the ball then nibbles away off the seam, past the bat and into the gloves"
short on the hip and flicked down to fine leg for one to finish the over
Westley gets on to the front foot and blocks solidly around off stump
"length ball, 139kph/87mph in the channel, rising sharply as he comes forward and shoulders arms"
"good length, Westley drives at it on the up, thick-edges towards square leg"
"in the channel, wide enough to leave"
dug in short and Westley sways out of harm's way
"woof, that's a juicy ball, sliding in and then straightening as Westley stays in the crease and pokes unsuccessfully at it"
"over the wicket, tossed up outside off, Cook lunges out to block"
pushed through and tapped back into the on side
"flighted, outside the line of off, defended coming across"
plants the front foo and defends again
"slower pace, drifting away from Cook, who is again well forward to smother the ball"
"angled in straighter, tucked to the leg side from the crease"
"beats the bat, pitched up and Westley has a dip, again the ball seams past the outside edge"
"good length, nipping away in the corridor, he's able to leave this one with more certainty"
"full, angling in... and crumped back down the ground for four! Westley's first boundary, slightly closed face as he drives again but it's a sold connection and rattles away"
"length ball aiming for the top of off, 87mph and defended"
"short and wide, slung down close to the tramlines, Westley drops the hands and ignores it"

"pushed through and played off the back foot, worked behind square for a single"
"round the wicket to the right-hander, flighted and gets him driving, pinged past extra cover along the carpet to mid-off, who's set back a little but they don't risk a single"
"good length and Cook reaches for it, thick-edges past his pads"
"pitched up in the channel, Cook leans on a drive, not got all of it but the ball runs away through cover for a couple"
sliding on to the body and worked away fine for one
"good length around off stump, presses forward to block"
"more good bowling without reward from Morkel, draws him out and then takes the ball away, through to the keeper"
"touch wider, again holding its line, Westley shoulders arms"
"wobbly full ball down the leg side, Cook flicks and misses"
"pitched up, looking for some nibble off the straight, Cook prods at it warily"

"floaty stuff, full and fading away outside off stump, left alone"
"full and gets him driving, looped towards point... but it sails away to his left and lands short as they scuttle through"
"sliding across the left-hander, who watches it through. No sucker punches - yet"
Westley gets forward and defends on off
"whipped off the pads for four! Westley's go-to shot, he steps across and times the undercrackers off a clip through midwicket to the fence"
"angled in on a good length, blocked from the crease"
lets this one go in the channel
"seaming away off a length, <b>clips the outside edge</b>... but lands short of the cordon! Westley angling the bat and managing to keep it down"
pitched up and blocked coming forwards
"full and dobbly, defended on the stumps"
"floated right up towards the blockhole, 70mph and Cook misses out, plinking the ball towards mid-off off the toe of the bat"

"tighter to off stump, gets forward to defend"
"back of a length, Cook pockets a single with a nudge behind square"
"slashed on the up, <b>big top edge - but it clears first slip!</b> He went hard at that, just got enough on a swaggering cut shot to get it over the cordon for four"
"length in the channel, 134kph/82mph, leaves this one be"

forward and blocked into the covers
left alone outside off
"outside off, sharp turn, wafted uppishly into the off side in a loose not-quite cut"

"width, poked firmly through the covers. Inelegant but highly effective"

"another of Cook's effective pokes back down the line of the ball. Into space behind mid-off, choosing the gap and forcing the fielder to make the chase"
solidly into line on off stump

"outside off, squeezed into the gully"
"back of a length, punched aggressively off the back foot into the covers"
forward and driven to cover
blocked into the off side
forward and blocked

"bat and pad together, stabbed to cover"
"outside off, a flowing drive but hits Bavuma at point before it can reach the rope"

"full length, whirring arms, defended on the crease"
"chopped firmly, not especially short but Cook rose onto his toes to make the most of it. Through backward point for Bavuma to chase well"

"outside off, not interested in this one"
"on the pads, clipped into the leg side"
"squared up on the back foot, and fenced to the leg side"
"full length, blocked"
squeezed into the on side
"onto the front foot, a loose drive as the ball hangs in the breeze and goes on with the arm, and that's a thin edge to the keeper! Cook pauses for the verdict but doesn't review. No doubts there. A surprise breakthrough against England's most obdurate presence, but a hugely timely one!"
"fully forward, and blocked"

"tight line, threat of movement off the seam, defended compactedly back down the pitch"
"<strong>what a catch from de Kock!</strong> A stunning dive, full to his right, to snaffle a thick edge in his outstretched glove. Bob Taylor would no doubt have walked across to grab that one, but a dramatic interception nonetheless, to cut off a promising innings. Good line and length from Rabada, just straightening and lifting off the seam"
"yeehar! Steady on old chap ... Malan flings a hard-handed drive at a 90mph delivery outside off, avoids the nick but only just"

thunders down the pitch but settles for a determined block
"outside off, Root cuts firmly but backward point is lurking"
"back of a length, defended back down the pitch"
"a huge shout! This one jags off the seam and crashes into Root's back pad. Rabada is aghast, he wants a second opinion, but du Plessis is unmoved on height ... and he's right. Good call, skip"
"dangles the bat on the back foot, another 90mph exocet, fenced away uneasily"
"short and sharp, but down the leg side"
"outside off, zings through to the keeper, just missing the edge! This is a searing spell from Rabada, and England are officially on notice"
"onto the front foot, a measured guide into the covers, Malan is off the mark and in a calm manner too"
"fractionally overpitched, and Root too is off the mark, whistling a drive from right under his nose through the covers. Well played"

"chopped through point with a welcome show of force, capitalising on a hint of width"
"bat and pad together, blocked into the off side"

"on the pads, Root walks across his crease and helps the ball round the corner to backward square"
"keeps a touch low does it? Either way, Root is grateful for another inside edge, as that would have been excruciatingly tight, right back on the crease as the ball thumps the pads"
"pitched up, Root follows it, driving away from his body... and he gets a thick edge wide of the two slips in place for four!"
"fired in full on leg stump, 86mph and deflected square off the pad"
"pushed through wide of the stumps from over the wicket, Malan sticks out his front pad and the ball zips through into de Kock's gloves"
straighter line and worked back to the bowler
"spinning in and worked away off the back foot past short fine leg for a couple... Bavuma nearly does himself a mischief as he picks up and attempts to throw, the crowd rather uncharitably cheering his slip. Just a sore backside, rather than damaged cruciates, though"

"flighted, defended coming forwards"
"tossed up around middle and off, Root pats back to the bowler"
"sliding in with the arm, blocked towards extra cover"
"full, bit of dip and Root comes forward to drive, sends it to mid-off along the carpet, he's set back but they don't attempt to run"
"pushed through outside off, Root drops back and steers a single behind point"
"angled in, beats Root on the inside, Aleem Dar turns down the lbw appeal... but du Plessis decides to <b>review</b>. Did this do too much? Height and leg stump the main questions, I'd say; Root was struck on the knee roll as it came back at him, the line looks good - but Hawk-Eye has it just clipping the bails, umpire's call! So Dar's original decision stands (which would have been the case if he'd given it out, as well)"
shortish outside off and Root skelps a couple through backward point
"good length, fading back in from wide of the stumps, shoulders arms"
"on the stumps, touch short and flicked through backward square leg"
pitched up and driven crisply but straight to mid-off

"pitched up a little more and Root comes forward to drive, not timed"
"fullish outside off, punched on the front foot, gets an inside edge on to his front pad"

"tossed up on middle stump, Root again attempts to whip it away off the pads but picks out a fielder"

"pitched up around off stump, presses forward to defend"
shortish and swatted through point off the back foot
"round the wicket to Malan, defended coming forwards"

shortish in the channel and steered through backward point from the crease
lets this one go outside off
"chases a wide one <b>and the edge is taken at second slip!</b> The change of angle works for Morkel, round the wicket in the previous over, over in this one... and it's all over for Malan, after another somewhat flimsy innings"

"<b>given lbw!</b> Root calls for the <B>review</b>. He came across and down the pitch, but this looks very straight. No bat involved. Hit in line and taking leg stump. So that drop didn't cost South Africa too many"

"back on off stump, pushed to the bowler"
"huge appeal for lbw, given not out by Dharmasena and the <b>review</b> is called for. Well, now it seems Dharmasena has given him out! Now he sends it upstairs. Confusion here. He's given Bairstow out caught now and it's being checked for the clean catch. Certainly a big edge into the pads. But has it carried to Elgar at slip?! Soft signal was out. Has Elgar got his fingers under it? Third umpire doesn't think so and it's not out! Well, well. A lot happened there."
"full, defended back to the bowler"
"touch shorter and quicker, pushed off the back foot"
"fuller, driven to mid-off"

"angled in, opens the face and steers into the covers"
YJB moves into line and defends square on the off side

"full toss from de Bruyn, a dirty loosener and Stokes grabs it by the lapels, slaps it around the chops a few times, and crunches four through cover - and Theunis had overstepped as well"

"can't stop himself this time, throws the hands and thick-edges past his stumps for one"
Bairstow gets forward and pushes a single back past the bowler

floated up on off and defended coming forwards
pushed through and chopped into the ground off the back foot
uses the feet and prods the ball back down the track

floated up on the stumps and tapped away
comes forward to the pitch of the ball to defend
fullish around off stump and Stokes blocks diligently

"testing line, climbing off a length in the channel, think he played inside this one"
"pitched up, Stokes drives, <b>gets a thick outside edge... but it flies through vacant third slip!</b> Du Plessis watches it whizz away to his left, surely wondering as it did so why he hadn't packed the cordon?"
"flung down wide and Stokes hurls himself after it, failing to connect. Questionable shot-making but he survives"
"that's right to the money to start with, shortish and steepling past the bat as YJB feels for it on the back foot"
"length ball, gets into line to block on off"
"touch short, Bairstow rocks back and cuts, struck powerfully but point takes the pace off it and they only get one"

"good length on off, YJB comes across and blocks"
"fired in on off, turned back towards mid-on as he comes across"
"beats the bat as Bairstow follows it, this swings late and also foxes de Kock! He gets a glove on it but can't prevent byes"
""

"sliding through in the channel of inflagrante delicto, Stokes avoids the temptation to chase the ball"
"ooh, that's zipped through, perfect length from Rabada, just does a bit of the seam, Bairstow left pushing down the wrong line!"

full length and driven along the carpet to mid-off
"angled across, Stokes pushes at it and gets an inside edge on to his pads"
"slanted across and Stokes opens the face to runs the ball through backward point, that's four more - and the England 250 as well"
"<b>bullseye!</b> Rabada silences Old Trafford with a searing yorker...! He screams at the sky, Stokes widens his eyes in appreciation of the ball that has just demolished his stumps... What an intervention, in the penultimate over of the day! Full, fast and thundering into the bottom of middle and off as Stokes tried to get his bat down in vain"
"oh, nearly plays on! Comes back in at him, Bairstow gets a thick edge into his pads and then kicks it away"
"overpitched and crunched through the covers, a bristling response from YJB as he steps out to drive"
"probing away on off stump, comes across to defend"
"good length in the channel, tries to leave... and edges wide of the slips for four more! Not what Bairstow was aiming to do but, unlike Amla at The Oval, he gets away with it"
"line and length, a foot outside off, judges it well and leaves"
"plugs away in the channel, Bairstow is across and waves his bat out of the line, safely negotiating his way to <b>stumps</b>"
"angled in on a full length, good sighter, squeezed to point off a leading edge"
left alone outside off. Good carry to the keeper
strding confidently onto the front foot. Pushed back down the pitch
"standing tall on the crease, finding enough bat to fend off another angled delivery towards middle and leg"
"a bit of a whoosh outside off. Fuller length from Rabada, luring the drive, but finding late swing to beat a tailender's slash"
well bowled. That's a lovely way to join the dots. Ghosting in and beating the edge by a whisker
"beautiful start, living outside off on a tight line and beating a windy back-foot drive"
textbook forward defensive. Striding forward and smelling the leather
"blocked once again, half-forward this time"
"full length, wide line, no stroke"
nothing on offer once again
"back and across, blocked to cover"
"full and straight. Rabada has one aim, and one aim only. To splinter some timbers"
"on the pads, squeezed behind square, a slight fumble from QDK behind the stumps gives TRJ a chance to escape the strike"
"banged in short, but leg-sided. Another untidy gather from de Kock, albeit he was at full stretch"
"back of a length, dabbed into the leg side"
worked to leg
leg-sided. Bairstow keeps the strike
"another corking delivery, save for the overstep - Morkel's first since his fateful transgressions at Lord's. Beats the edge as it explodes off the deck"
fenced into the gully
"back and across, defending into the leg side"
"huge appeal, very full and strikes the pad on a leg-stump line. But that was always sliding down"
"another appeal, there's a definite sound as the ball straightens on an off-stump line and grazes past the edge. But it's pad, not bat. He's not having much luck in this match..."
"another pearler, straightening once more past the edge"
"on the pads, clipped through square leg. Morkel strains too hard for the magic ball, seeing as brilliance isn't cutting it this morning. And gives away a freebie four"
"cracked through the covers, in the slot for the shot, and he has a tonk. Well played"
"oops, too much confidence from the tailender, and another expansive drive skews into the hands of Bavuma at cover, who has to search for the ball initially but sights it comfortably in the end. Still, the nightwatchman did his job up to a point ... much as a chocolate tea-pot tends to hold at least one serviceable cuppa"
"banged in short, Moeen is getting used to the banged-in welcome in this series"
sways inside the line again
up on the toes to drive to cover
"tight line, full on the legs, and that's a glorious punched on-drive. Timed to perfection through long-on"
"full length, tight line, left alone"
"full and wide, and Bairstow has a thrash outside off. Was aiming rather straighter, but a thick outside edge skews off through third man. That'll do"
"full again, straighter this time, pushed back to the bowler"
crashed through the off side. Morkel must be ready to throw his sweater in by now
defended back down the line of the ball
"on the pads, whipped fine. QDK can't cut that one off, and the runs are suddenly flowing"
"round the wicket, back of a length, defended"
"short, rolled through backward square, he just needed to get a nudge of bat on that and it was four"
"up on the toes, drilled to the off side"
pushed into the off side once again
forward and defended into the covers
"too short, Moeen is primed for that length now, and the line was too wide as well. A yawning pull through midwicket, and England are galloping now"
tightens up on off stump to defend
"through to the keeper, no stroke offered"
"on the pads, attempted tickle through backward square"
"tapped into the gap at backward square, a ripple of applause greets the ... 299?"
"width, chopped down into the ground, through backward point to bring up both the 300 and Bairstow's fifty. Another invaluable knock"
"outside off, Bairstow plays inside the line, QDK does the rest"
dabbed back to the bowler
"edged and gone, a lifter from Rabada, Moeen doesn't quite get into line as the ball nips off the seam on the angle, and a good tumbling catch from du Plessis at second slip"
"full length, tapped into the covers to get off the mark, and Maharaj looks in some bother as he sets off in pursuit. He left the field with a leg injury yesterday ... that's not a good sign"
"well bowled, fizzing through to the keeper on a full length"
"stabbed down into the crease, via a fat inside-edge, and ooh, squelch! Bairstow deserves a breather after that deflection ... he gives himself a minute, and resumes his stance"
"on the pads, gratefully tucked behind square"
"outside off, patted to deep point to grab a single"
"full length, Broad lamps the bat through the line and squeezes a fat edge hard through the gap in the cordon. If you've got to flash, flash hard"
"<B>success for Morkel!</B> He's worked so hard for this, his second wicket, when he might have had six. Full and straight, Broad lines up a loose drive, plays all round it, and loses his off stump"
"forward, solid as a rock, and a huge cheer greets his successful negotiation of his first delivery"
"back of a length, outside off, left alone"
more or less into line to defend into the cordon
firmly drilled into the covers from a full length. A single is on offer but Bairstow declines
"edged and <B>dropped!</B> Oh dear, de Kock is having a shocker, after that thrilling take on the first day. And Rabada is denied his five-for too! A regulation nick from a full length, keeps low but eminently takeable"
"outside off, no stroke offered"
"pushed through third man, superb running turns a steady single into a scampered two"
"full length, ghosts past the edge"
"squirts the single through the gap in the covers, 'yes, yes, yes, yes!' is the cry as two men converge but neither can intercept. He's snaffled the strike"
tapped into the off side
"tight line, a fat inside-edge into the pads"
"open face, punched into the covers"
"on the pads, whipped into the leg side"
Anderson survives the first of two balls in this over
"down the leg side, and another over is notched up"
"banged in short, no stroke offered"
"full length, stabbed to cover"
"wallop! Over-pitched and Bairstow was onto it in a flash, firmly onto the front foot and crunching through the line"
"leg-sided, lots of bottom hand to whip through midwicket"
"zipped through, Anderson stays out of harm's way"
dead-batted defiance. Anderson makes it through to <B>drinks</B>
"length around off stump, comes across to block"
"lovely timing, slightly straight from Morkel and YJB finds a gap at deep midwicket, wristed off the legs and it beats the man in the deep, adding a few more to England's hills of beans"
"fullish outside off, steered square coming forwards"
"pitched up in the channel, punched down the ground to long-off, again Bairstow opts to keep the strike"
full outside off and larruped in no-nonsense fashion through the covers for four more! YJB takes advantage of the men coming in to belt Morkel through the off side
"wide of the stumps, Bairstow moved across early and opened the face, steered to the right of gully, who dives to stop it but can't prevent them scampering through for the single that keep YJB on strike"
fullish and poked back to the on side
"sliced through point, this time Bairstow wants the run and he's placed the ball between two men and gets back for a second"
"fired in straight, this time he picks up a brace off his pads... SA getting increasingly irritated by this stand"
"full, this seams in a fraction as Bairstow plays and misses"
"lashed through gully for four more! YJB is rollicking along here, slaps another boundary dropping back on off stump and taking advantage of width"
"and he pinches a single off the last ball again! Shortish and nudged square, somehow there's no one to cut it off and they amble through comfortably"
fullish in the channel and bunted down the ground to long-off
"length, outside off stump, YJB swishes and misses"
"brings out the ramp now, gets it away to fine leg, another boundary and another poke in the eye for du Plessis' tactics!"
"smoked down the ground! Bairstow rumbles into the 90s, this is marvelous batting with only No. 11 for company... Pitched up by Olivier and YJB just bullocks it back over his head in dismissive style"
"length on off, comes across and defends"
"wide of the stumps, Bairstow gets it through again! But SA do manage to keep Anderson on strike... Touch short and he was back and across to slide it wide of third man, moves on to 94 as England go past 350"
"close! Skidding through outside off, past the edge as Anderson pokes at it"
"now Anderson goes for the reverse-sweep....! He's hit on the pad, not given but SA <b>review</b>. Think this is a bit optimistic, it was turning from off to leg and hit him above the knee roll, no bat involved - and just clipping the bails, according to Hawk-Eye!"
"pushed through on off stump, diligently watched on to the middle of the bat in defence this time"
"flat outside off, nicely swatted square off the back foot, he's actually got this through for a boundary!"
"arm ball, sliding on past the bat into the gloves as Anderson props forward"
"tossed up a foot or so outside off and Anderson draws his bat deliberately out of the way... A low cheers rolls around the ground, he's survived and YJB has his window of opportunity"
"pitched up and pushed back down the ground, no runs there"
"comes forward and steers a drive wide of long-off, he wants a second and Anderson makes it back, diving on his shirt front as the throw comes in"
"two more, in front of deep cover! Driven and placed expertly again, he's haring back as the fielder collects and knows he can't get the throw in in time"
"low full toss from Olivier, pushed square... and he's takes the single on offer. Two balls for Anderson to survive, with Bairstow on 99!"
"short and down the leg side, not a million miles from the glove as Anderson sways and fends at it"
"back of a length, stabbed down safely past short leg... again the crowd celebrates a dot ball to Anderson, with Bairstow waiting at the other end"
"round the wicket, tossed up on off stump and defended"
"flighted, comes forward and blocks calmly"
"tossed up and this time he leaves the crease to drive, wanted to force it past extra cover but doesn't succeed"
"goes for the sweep, slides on to hit the pad - <b>and Kumar Dharmasena gives it!</b> Groans reverberate around the ground but Bairstow <b>reviews</b>, was he outside the line? No, Hawk-Eye has it umpire's call, by the slenderest margin! Struck on the front pad and there was just a scrap of leather in line with off stump, which means Bairstow has to go"
"full and swinging late across Elgar, who jabs down, there's a chunky sort of sound as the ball passes... but Bairstow can't hold on! Was that an edge? No, think it was bat hitting the ground"
"down the leg side this time, YJB dives to his right but again the ball eludes him and skitters away... Cook leaps impressively, having given chase from slip, to save a couple of runs down by fine leg"
"<b>pinned on the front pad, up goes the finger!</b> Anderson has a wicket, he's keeping his end up for England...! That looked pretty hook, line and sinker, straightening on leg stump and Elgar doesn't bother to review. SA's opening stand lasts just three balls this time, as Old Trafford basks in immediate success for its man"
"sliding in with the arm, Amla calmly nudges the ball behind square from back in the crease to get off the mark"
"ooh, tempter, pitched full and swirling away as Kuhn thinks about following it..."
"oh, a leading edge this time! Jiminy Cricket, it's going for Anderson, shaping late as Kuhn brings the bat down on a slight angle, the ball flies low towards point"
"glides in and hits a fullish length, Amla shows it a solid block on off"
"touch straight, no lateral movement for Broad and Amla works a couple off his pads"
"back of a length, this nips in at the batsman but he fends it away through backward square for two more"
comes across and dabs down defensively to the on side
"good length, in the channel but Amla isn't drawn into playing"
"pitched up a little more and this <i>just</i> holds its line, Amla gets a low leading edge towards mid-off trying to play to leg"
"nicely bowled, full outside off and straightening as Kuhn reaches forward and is beaten"
"full on middle stump, Kuhn twocks it firmly through midwicket for four, didn't do enough as it angled in and his closed bat face wasn't in danger"
"pitched up and met coming forwards, blocked"
pitched up and again he lines it up well to defend on the front foot
"fullish, around off stump, closes the face a fraction as he works to mid-on"
"woof, a jaffa to finish, leaping past the shoulder of the bat as Kuhn comes bravely forward again"
"dabbed into the off side, backward point comes racing in as Amla hesitates... but the throw misses! Think he might just have made his ground, anyway"
"shortish and wide of off, Kuhn swipes at it... and nearly chops on! Not a particularly assured-looking stroke, once again"
"rising in the channel, Kuhn chases it again and is beaten as it zips through the Bairstow! Nervous moments"
"length around off stump, defended with a straight bat coming across"
lets this one go in the channel
"fullish, 85mph and a foot or so outside off, left alone once again - which means SA get to <b>lunch</b> without further damage"
"back of a length, fenced into the off side with a hop into line"
"similar ball, similar shot, Amla hanging back to line up the swing, and dabbing to gully"
"inswinger, Amla picks it from the hand and works it to mid-on"
"back of a length once more, wide on the crease, shaping in on the top of off"
"poked back down the pitch with a firm-handed block, slightly squared up on impact"
pushed to the leg side
"wide on the crease, defended with a straight bat"
"wider line, Kuhn opens up his stance in preparation for the cut, and lets it fly by"
this time he does unleash the cut and clocks it firmly down to deep point
"up on the toes, worked into the off side with a scamper"
"big stride, bat held high, no stroke offered"
"wide on the crease, fuller length, fended away"
"full length, zeroing in on the stumps. Blocked whence it came"
"shoulders arms on a good length, through to the keeper"
"just overpitched a touch, straining for the swing, and Amla doesn't miss those chances to free his arms on the drive"
into line
"punched into the gap in the covers, Moeen gives chase"
left alone outside off stump
"stands tall on the back foot, this one kicks off the deck, into a punch to point"
"good threatening delivery, finding some extra bounce from a full length and challenging the technique on the front foot"
Amla slides back this time to push to cover
"fenced down through the cordon and Bairstow, in his pads, sprints and slides to put his cordon to shame. Hauls it back in the nick of time. Go Jonny Go"
squared up on the back foot
"driven with a thick outside edge, not really to the pitch of that one, but effective all the same. Runs stacking up since the resumption"
"through to the keeper, this one keeps low and clobbers Bairstow on the end of the thumb. A wince from the keeper to match that he gave to Dharmasena this morning"
defended back down the pitch with one hand off the bat
"through to the keeper, a good leave outside off"
"outside off, and cut through point with a fling of the hands"
"full length, wobbling through the air, negotiated with a long-limbed stab back down the pitch"
"full again, punched to mid-off. Not a lot of swing since lunchtime"
"full length, a touch wide, no need for a stroke this time"
"onto the front foot, crunched into the gap at mid-off. That came onto the bat nicely, and went off it like a sonnet"
"up on the toes, punched sweetly into the gap at extra cover. Placement to the fore as Broad drags his length back, but Amla is equal to the challenge"
"width outside off, no stroke offered"
"opens the face, glides into the off side"
"tighter line, that's a better length too, six inches closer to off stump and Kuhn would be obliged to play at that. But as it is, it's a fine leave"
"full length, straining for some swing, but easily stabbed to midwicket"
swished to mid-off
"fenced into the leg side, off the back foot"
"cut out to gully, as the ball keeps low to force a late adjustment. Food for thought for the team batting last, but as things stand, this pitch is very good for batting"
better carry this time as Kuhn shoulders arms
"inside-edged, down into the pitch, nearly the drag-on, but not quite"
"back of a length, tucked into the leg side"
"on the pads, that's a freebie for Amla, who picks the gap at backward square with impeccable timing"
"oh good grief, TRJ makes it three in three against Amla, with the softest dismissal of his career! A leg-stump long-hop, another attempted glide, but he undercooks it, steers a thin tickle off the face of the bat, and Bairstow flings the ball in the air with glee!"
"solidly forward, blocked into the off side"
"angled defence through the gully, the slip cordon give chase down to third man, but end up impersonating the Beatles on Abbey Road zebra crossing as they take turns to step onto the kerb"

"wide of off stump, and sure enough, no stroke once again"
forward and pushed to the off side
"gosh, that's a good leave, late nip back to the stumps perhaps coming close to making it a foolish leave ..."
"extra nip off the deck this time, the diminutive Bavuma wrings his hand as he wears one on the glove in defence"
"outside off again, through to the keeper"
"cracked off the back foot, rising onto his little tippy-toes to turn a length delivery into an opportunity for a back-foot drive"
"fuller length, strikes the pad, a hearty appeal. But umpire Dar is unmoved. Outside the line, probably. In fact, it was going over the top"
"very full length, attacking the stumps"
solidly onto the front foot to block
solid defence once more
tight line again
"keeps fractionally low, perhaps exaggerated a touch by the shot"
"angled into the legs, tucked square to complete a maiden"
"outside off, still mindful of any expansive shots"
fenced into the leg side
banging out a solid line and length just outside off stump. Left alone once more
"chiselled into the leg side, that's a very well timed and placed stroke. A long chase at deep midwicket from Malan, who does well on the slide"

"pitched up, gets Kuhn reaching for it, a thick inside edge runs down to third man"

"length ball, comes across and pushes towards cover point"
"There's a mix-up here, <b>should be a run-out... but Moeen misses the stumps!</b> He gathered the throw from mid-off - not the best it has to be said - but swung his arms round with Bavuma diving for the line, failed to connect and then by the time he had broken them, the bat was grounded"
"tossed up and he goes for the sweep, did that come off the glove? Bairstow was trying to get around the stumps for a half-chance but the ball lands safely"
"flighted, draws him forward, <b>Kuhn nicks a low catch to slip!</b> Drama off every ball in this over and Moeen now has a wicket! Stokes grasped it low, his knuckles grazing the grass, Kuhn was happy to walk straight off and although the umpires converge for a chat, he's sent on his way.

"left alone again, keeps lower as it dribbles through to the keeper"
pushed back into the crease to defend as Morkel angles this one back into the right-hander
"well played, cashing in on the over-pitched delivery and drilling a drive through the gap in the off side. A bit of a thick outside edge in the final analysis, but it races away through backward point"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
"stands tall on the back foot, defended"
sharp delivery with good carry at 88mph. But wide enough to ignore as Jennings continues to bed in

"that one got up more tastily, as Westley winds his neck in"
"outside off, nibbles off the seam but safely past the edge."

Not shot, so obviously doesn't matter where it hit him but it's not turned back enough. Comfortably missing off. A waste of a review. Was just a gamble"

"short of a length outside off, he back-cuts and finds gully"
"short again, pushed with an open face into the backward-point area"

flicked uppishly into the leg side
"leg-stump line, firmly pushed away"
"that is poor, poor, poor from Jennings. Shorter, but not as wide as he thought, and an attempted cramped cut fizzes, catching-practice style, into the hands of Amla at first slip! The shot of a man who senses the bailiffs are circling for his borrowed time..."

down on one knee and panned through the leg side
swept fiercely out to deep square leg to get off the mark
tight line and defended
"on the pads, worked to the leg side"
"on the pads, tucked into the leg side again"
"Rabada's line has deserted him a touch in this over, consistently angling down the leg side, and this time he pays the price, a fine deflection beating the field"
"that's better, attacking the top of off with extra bounce, and ricocheting off the midriff to the cordon"

glided into the covers off the back foot
"up on the toes, a slip and backward short leg in place now"
forward and blocked into the leg-side
"bites the rough, leaps into the splice, off the knee-roll, pops into the hands of short leg. An absolute lollipop of a catch, and another strike in a spirited showing from South Africa! Malan struggles to convince once again, and England's dominance is dented a notch"
more sharp turn and bounce out of the left-hander's rough. There's plenty in this pitch
forward tentatively
"a huge appeal! No stroke as Stokes pads up to a spitting cobra from the rough, but du Plessis burnt a review on a complete guess this morning, and decides not to gamble. Rightly so in the end as that was missing off, but golly!"

"it's no fun being a left-hander to Maharaj at the moment! Lots of turn and bounce, as Stokes leaves this one alone"
defended on the back foot

"inside-edged onto the pad .... but it flies straight down the pitch, instead of into short leg's hands!"
"down on one knee, and that's an emphatic response from Stokes. Sweeping out of the rough, working with the spin, rolling the wrists and picking the gap behind square"

"beats him this time! Well bowled, brings Stokes forward away from his body and this shapes past the edge"

Moeen reaches forward to defend on off
"tossed up outside off, Moeen rolls out the reverse-sweep and manages to nutmeg Elgar at slip for four!"

"<b>dropped!</b> Banged in short, flies off the shoulder of the bat, du Plessis sprints back from slip, soars full length and almost takes an absolute screamer - <b>but it pops out as his arm hits the ground!</b> Fabulous attempt by du Plessis, going for it one-handed and he had the ball in his hand but couldn't hold on! And he's taken a whack on the shoulder in the process"

dug in again and pulled for one to bring up the England 200 to more leery cheers around the ground

"short stuff to welcome him to the crease, not quite the right line and Broad can away under it at the last moment"
"Mo mo mo! How do you like it? How do you like it? Not very much if you're Keshav Maharaj, who's planted into the stands at deep square leg... The crowd lapped it up though"
skips down again and drags a leg-side heavy through backward square leg for one
"tossed up and swept hard from outside off, straight to square leg"
"flighted outside off, gets Broad poking and it loops wide of slip"
pushed through and he sticks out a pad this time
"on the stumps, worked into the leg side, another dot ball"
"the shots keep coming, this time he pumps Rabada straight down the ground, in the air for a while, and mid-off has no chance"
"a straight full toss, takes an outside edge towards point where it's not stopped cleanly"
"starts off with a full-length delivery angling away, Broad just leans forward and caresses this into the extra cover boundary"
"edged, and into the gap between second slip and gully. This length ball deviated a wee bit from middle, brushes Broad's thigh and deflects to the third man boundary. Good call from the umpire. Looked like a big, fat edge there, but no."

"zips across on a good length, plenty of movement off the seam and then in the air, Bairstow takes it in front of first slip"
"touch fuller, outside off, Elgar hides his bat behind the pad as he allows it through"
another solid front-foot push finds mid-off
"short of a length at off stump, that's well played as he drops it into the off side and rotates the strike"
"another ripper, round the wicket, bounces from a good length, squares up Elgar and takes him on the back arm. That's another bruise"
"full outside off, left alone"
"<B>what bowling! Elgar edges behind</b>. Another crackerjack delivery. Just short of a good length, angled in at off stump, he has to play, then it straightens off the seam and grazes the outside edge"
"back of a length at off stump, defended to the on side"
gets inside the line and tucks this off the hip but it's well stopped by Malan at quite a deep short leg

lets it go through to the keeper
"does well to keep this down, jumps from a good length and takes the shoulder of the bat but falls short of third slip"

"this one nips, that's the variation from Anderson, takes Kuhn high on the pad"

"fuller, he comes forward and defends to cover"
"short of a length outside off, this one nips back but he's able to leave it alone"
"beats him with a full one outside off, feet stuck in the crease, playing away from his body"
what a ball! Done all ends up. Moves away off the seam from just outside off and he's beaten again
"touch wider to end the over, left alone. A fantastic spell from Broad"
"full outside off, 82mph, left alone"
"huge appeal for caught behind, given not out! And Root calls for the <b>review</b>. Looks like the bottom of the bat may have clipped the boot if anything. No mark when ball passes the bat"
"angled into the pads, clipped behind square"
"back of a length outside off, moves away, left alone"
"a little shorter, left alone"
"full at off stump, defended back down the pitch"

nicely forward into a full ball and punches to cover
"touch shorter outside off, left alone"
"short of a length, on the hip, clipped into square leg"
"full at off stump, plays across the ball a little but it's safely into point"
"full at off stump, defended to cover"
"full outside off, left alone"
"boy oh boy, what a delivery! He's bowled some gems in this spell. This jags away from just short of a good length and climbs past the shoulder of Bavuma's bat"
defended back to Broad who tries some football skills (slightly better than Morkel's attempt yesterday)
"full at off stump, he's onto the front foot and drives sweetly to square cover"
"this takes a thick inside edge, a length delivery, and is threatening to spin back towards the stumps before Bavuma sticks his boot on it. The bowlers won't like the stud marks"

"full, wide outside off, left alone"
"finds the edge, a full ball at off stump, but it went along the ground wide of fourth slip"

that's a tighter leave! Shades past off stump to bring cries from the slip cordon
gets nicely forward into a full delivery and pushes to the covers
"back of a length outside off, pushed to point"
"over the wicket, spins from wide outside off, loops off the pad to short leg"
sweeps a full delivery from outside off to deep square leg
"and Amla sweeps as well, slightly shorter delivery, sends it through short fine leg"
"he sweeps again, whacks into short leg - Jennings - and flies away through midwicket. That's a nasty blow"
"an appeal for a bat-pad catch as Bavuma plays back, this spins from outside off and takes just pad to Jennings"
forward outside off and works to the leg side

"across onto off stump, defends a short-of-a-length delivery to point"
"<b>strikes with the last ball of the session!</b> An appeal for caught behind! Not much from the bowler and it's given not out, but Root eventually calls the <B>review</b>. Bavuma pushing away from his body. There is a click! And there's a spike on Ultra Edge! This will be out...Roland-Jones strikes with the last ball of the session. Broad played a key role in calling that review. Like with his first Test wicket, Roland-Jones wasn't convinced"
tossed up and driven to cover
"sharp turn from outside off, Amla slides back to defend, but has to be watchful of the lurking short leg"
another one pops off the pitch and deflects off the hip
"tight line, good turn, Amla walking way outside off to combat the turn, and finds the single through backward square"
pushed back down the pitch with a full face of the bat
fully forward and blocked back down the track
"lovely ball, perfect length, exploding off the seam to take the glove"
"and again, Amla wrings his hands in pain as Anderson rears a good-length delivery into his fingers"
rising on the back foot to block again
"squared up on a tight line, pushed back down the pitch"
"outside off, and jabbed into the cordon"
wide outside off and through to the keeper
"pops up, off the pad flap and inches short of the stretching short leg! Was there an inside-edge? Looked close ..."
a judicious sweep to release the pressure
"right back on the stumps, deflected to the leg side"
"huge appeal! Outside the line perhaps, but that was jolly close. He didn't look like a convincing attempt to play a shot... and sure enough, it was outside the line  but smashing middle"
"thunked away once more, on the front foot"
worked to leg. A tight over
"lifting outside off, and jagging off the seam"
chiselled into the leg side
"outside off, lifting through to the keeper"
"up on the toes, punched back to the bowler"
"my God, that is just too good for any player on earth! Nipping, seaming, climbing, like a leg-break, missing the edge by a whisker and flicking the back leg!"
tucked to the leg side to diffuse the drama a touch
"onto the front foot, limp-batted defence to the leg side"
tapped into the on-side
"forward, a touch gingerly"
an aggressive sweep but doesn't quite connect
"back and across, pushed to the bowler"
"soldily onto the front foot, another maiden. Back atcha Jimmy..."
punched back to the bowler
left alone outside off stump
"solid block outside off, and defended"
into line again
ploughing away on an off-stump line
"stabbed to point, another probing over"
"tossed up outside off, Faf lines up the sweep but can't connect"
connects well on the sweep this time. Jennings at deep square leg tidies up
"reverse sweep, pad well outside the line as the bat misses its target"
"another reverse sweep, Stokes sees it coming and gallops across from slip to intercept, but can't quite manage it. Good anticipation though"
stabbed into the leg side
"full length on off stump, dead-batted defiance on the front foot"
"good start, rising into the splice from a good length. Amla takes his hand off the bat in defence"
"driven, in the air, and through point. A boundary, but a streaky one. Not entirely to the pitch of that one"
"wide on the crease, squared up in defence and pushed to mid-on"
"very full length, speared to mid-off"
well played and placed. Driven sweetly through the covers
"solidly onto the front foot, and drilled through mid-off. Runs suddenly flowing for Amla, that muffed drive through point has clicked him up a gear"
"held back in the flight, dead-batted defence through third man"
speared into the off side
tapped to mid-on
"reverse sweep, he's using that shot well today, and nails another one through third man"
nudged to leg
back and across to defend
"firmly onto the front foot, angled bat to third man"
"wider on the crease, fuller in the length, defended"
"this one stops on Faf a touch as he plays too early with a straight bat, and Broad at mid-on is nearly in business..."
"ouch, that one exploded! Du Plessis dances inside the line at the last minute but can't avoid being clanged in the ribs. Stokes at gully is most amused by that"
"good response, solidly into line"
"swished high and hard down to third man, didn't go where intended, but it went quickly and that's just as important"
forward in defence
"another reverse-sweep, doesn't connect"
stretching onto the front foot and pushed to cover
"looped up, calm defence into the leg side"
firm block into the off side and a well-judged single
leg-sided and gathered at backward square
"wide on the crease, attacking the stumps, defended"
"lifts a touch off the pitch, jabbed to gully, bat away from body"
"slightly overpitched and pumped hard back down the ground, but TRJ does well to intercept in his followthrough"
"back and across, worked to the leg-side"
"driven and effectively so, through the covers and escorted to the rope by an ambling Anderson"
climbing through to the keeper
punched into the off side
"sharp turn from back of a length, beats everything and whistles past Bairstow's gloves for byes"
"fully forward, presenting the pad as first line of defence, outside off stump"
"padded away again, to point"
"up on the toes, calmly dabbed to third man"
"slog-swept, firmly,  out to deep midwicket. Picked up from a full length but well combatted"
crunched back to the bowler as Broad overpitches. Gathered in the followthrough
"better length, lifting outside off and poked to cover"
half-forward to meet Broad's traditional angled delivery into the stumps
rolls his fingers on this one and it skids low as a result. Well watched by Amla as he keeps his pads safe
punched to cover
"that is magnificent. Meeting the full length with an arrow-straight drive, clean through long-on"
whipped classily through the gap at square. Not a lot wrong with the ball but brought the bat through at a fierce pace
"outside off, left alone"
"short, and pulled fine to complete a very fine half-century for the masterful Amla. These are seriously tough conditions but he's made it look, if not easy, then possible"
through to the keeper again
"fuller length, wider line, lures a loose thrash outside off"
through to the keeper again
"forward, not entirely convincingly, and squeezed off the toe, just past his stumps"
"on the toes, flicked very fine and the runs keep flowing!"
forward and pushed to the off side
"ooh, that keeps low on a good length. Du Plessis digs it out"

climbing through to the keeper
"down the leg side, careful now, don't want to be strangled again"
squared up in defence
crashed back to the bowler on a full length

whirring away on a good length outside off. Blocked
"outside off, through to the keeper on a good length"
"lovely lift off the deck, but wide enough for Amla to let it fizz by unharmed"
through to the keeper again
"back and across, and blocked on the back foot. Keeps a touch low again, but supremely watched onto the bat"
banged in short
back onto the stumps in defiant defence
driven ... in the air ... but just short of Stokes in his followthrough! Through it too soon as Stokes rolls his fingers

"wider on the crease, fenced with the angle to midwicket"
"forward, half-forward to be precise, dead-batted to cover"
"in the air again, but finds the gap into the covers with a checked drive"
"on the pads, neatly clipped to midwicket. South Africa's resistance continues, and that will be <B>drinks</B>"
"full outside off, left alone"
"through to the keeper, not tempted to drive at that"
"full at the toes, clipped to deep square leg...there you go, Darryn"
"this one jumps from a good length outside off, du Plessis takes his bottom hand off the bat"
"this one nips back, fending round the corner behind square"
"gets away with this one, forcing off the back foot and gets an inside edge over the stumps to fine leg"

"full, wide outside off, left alone"
"short of a length at off stump, worked to the leg side"

uses his feet then traps this between inside edge and pad
"wide line outside off, squeezed down by his feet"
"a short delivery, rolls his wrists on a pull to deep square"

worked towards mid-on who is deep enough to allow the single
padded away outside off

"quicker, flatter, flicked out to deep square leg"
"outside off, defended"
gets an inside edge into his boot as he aims to work this to the leg side
sweeps a straight delivery to deep square leg
"short of a length outside off, driven off the back foot towards mid-off where Anderson lets it through his legs and is then slow chasing after, which means they get back for a second. Poor cricket from England"
"length ball at off stump, defended to short mid-on"
"<B>in the air, just past the bowler!</b> Du Plessis bunts a full delivery to Roland-Jones' left in his follow through  and he can't react in time"

"straight, back of a length, worked to midwicket"
worked off the stumps into square leg
"<B>Moeen makes the breakthrough, Amla is lbw!</b> Huge appeal as he is well across his stumps and misses his flick to leg. Dharmasena says not out. Root calls the <b>review</b>! He's in front of middle and off...this will be very close! Has he hit it? There's a small mark, but third umpire Joel Wilson says there's a gap between bat and ball, which the pictures do back up. It's hitting leg stump! That's three reds"

"sweeps again, from wide outside off, drags it deep into the leg side"
uses his feet then defends
"<b>edged, taken at second slip!</b> The dangers of driving out of the rough. It's full and tempting, pitches in the dust, de Kock can't resists, and it's a sharp, low catch by Cook"
"over the wicket, full at off stump, defended"
"<B>and another, edges to slip!</b> Wonderful bowling from Moeen, this one is outside off and doesn't spin. De Bruyn playing back and it takes the outside edge low to Stokes, who grabs it down by his bootlaces"

"this keeps a touch low, lots of 'oohs' and 'aahs' as he jabs down on it"
"tight lines, fired in by Anderson, blocked on off stump"
"good length, Maharaj continues to get in line and show it a straight bat"
"off-stump line, 134kph/82mph, not much in the way of lateral movement - don't think England have achieved much in the way of reverse so far today - and it's kept out to complete a maiden over"
"tossed up from over the wicket, du Plessis leans out and blocks"
"flighted a touch more, watches it from the crease and defends on off stump"
"shuffles across, worked through midwicket for a single to the man in the deep"
pushed through and tapped back down to the off side
stays back and plays with the turn safely into the turf again
"flighted, comes forward to drive, sends it along the carpet to mid-off"
"<b>swats at a wide one - and nicked to the keeper!</b> Du Plessis walks, Anderson has got South Africa's captain and their last hope of a miracle! Not his best ball of the day by any stretch but Faf swung from the hip, he was a tiny bit late on it and grazed the ball through to Bairstow. The rearguard endeth"

"flatter on off stump, stays in the crease and blocks"
"tossed up and Maharaj smashes it back to the bowler's right, Moeen gets a fingertip on it and the ball ricochets into the stumps... He appeals, but replays quickly show Rabada had his bat grounded. They pinched a run, too"
"tossed up from round the wicket, leans into a block"
gets on to the front foot and defends again
"pushed through a little quicker, Rababa chops down on it in front of his stumps"
"short and a touch wide and Maharaj doesn't muck about, belts four off the back foot past gully"

"reaches for this one, squirted off the outer half of the bat through backward point for a single"

"clouted back down the ground, an easy-breezy swing of the bat from Maharaj, sends it fine of mid-off and away to the rope"
flatter and straighter and worked away for one into the leg side
"tossed up outside off, Rabada leans out and lets it spin through to the keeper"

"goes round the wicket, 82mph, slightly short of a length, defended"

"dragged down a touch, Maharaj whirls his arms and pulls flat to backward square leg"
"on the charge, muscular swing of the arms <b>and it sails over long-on for six!</b> Maharaj is going to go down swinging, it seems"
"flighted, keeps tossing it up outside off, driven to long-off along the ground"
"Morkel looks to join in with the humpty - <b>but picks out mid-off!</b> He's gone for a second-ball duck, didn't get the elevation and the backpedalling Root held another above his head"
"<b>nicked to slip, gone first ball - and England win by 177 runs!</b> Moeen finishes it again, two in two, the ball drifting and skidding on, flicking the edge to be snapped up by Stokes once again... Can SA send in the 12th man so he can try for another hat-trick?"
