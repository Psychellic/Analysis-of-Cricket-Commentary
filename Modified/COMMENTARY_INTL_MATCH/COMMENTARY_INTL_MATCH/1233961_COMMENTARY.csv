<b>hints of swing into him</b> as Guptill keeps his front pad out of the way and blocks to mid-on
"<b>inside edge</b> as once again the ball nibbles into Guptill just a little more than he's ready for. The batsman is going for a cover drive seeing it full and outside off, but it wanders to midwicket instead"
<b>slower ball b-e-a-uty</b>! It's the offcutter and he's completely deceived Guptill. Hits a good length on middle. Has the batsman playing too early. And then rips across the outside edge like a legbreak
tests the middle of the pitch this time - this over has had almost everything - and Guptill pulls to long leg
"<b>ooooh, he really is feeling it</b>! Only a man in form can hit a cover drive on the up first ball. This is a superb over from Shaheen and he hasn't done much wrong with this ball either, pitching it up and across the right-hander. But Seifert is so in control of his game, so confident, that he presses forward strongly and drills it between mid-off and cover"
"good length and cutting back into the right-hander, immediately denying him the room that he relished in so recently. Seifert defends"
"<b>misfield at cover</b>. It's Hafeez there, who ends up overrunning the ball, which was short and outside off and got a Guptill punch for its troubles"
keeps to his crease against a fullish delivery on leg stump and blocks
"<b>flashes at it and comes up with nothing</b>! This is neither a cross-bat shot, nor a straight bat punch. He simply wants to force a short ball through the off side and it doesn't happen for him"
blocks a back of a length ball on middle
<b>he's McCullum-ed it!</b> He has absolutely McCullum-ed it! That man absolutely loved charging at 150 kph fast bowlers and tonking them over the top of the off side. And his protege is following suit. Sensational shot over point.
"that shot inspires a little <b>extra venom</b> from Hasnain, running in harder, hitting the deck better, and he gets extra bounce to beat a tame cut shot attempt"
takes on the short ball on leg stump and pulls it sweetly to deep square leg
"he lofts it, but he hasn't quite timed it. Comes possibly off the bottom of the bat as he goes after a full ball on middle and mid-on catches up with it fairly easily"
"whips it away. The idea is right. You need to tuck a batsman like Seifert up on leg stump, but Afridi goes a little too full, allowing the batsman the chance to flick it sweetly"
defends a good length ball on off stump
"<b>top edge</b> but it sails away! Poor poor Afridi. He watches yet another good ball go to the boundary. Makes this climb up to the batsman's throat, but the instinctive hook from Guptill returns a profit"
works it to deep square leg
"good length ball outside off, Guptill is looking to smash it down the ground, it sneaks under his bat"
"shortish and into the body, cramps Guptill up as he tries to flick it through midwicket. He's too slow on the shot"
<b>oh that's clever</b>! He's probably been waiting for that. He knows the bowlers are trying to tuck him up. He's seen fine leg up inside the circle. This short ball is a bit too leg side and so immediately he whips it away to the fine leg boundary. Good batting
turns a short of a length delivery on off stump to deep square leg
<b>beats him</b> as Guptill looks to force a short of a length ball square on the off side. Might have been a touch too close and bouncing a little too much for such shenanigans
<b>thumps it down the ground</b>. This is a baseball biff! The front leg is lost. It's gone. It's out of the way. It doesn't matter. It's all about hand-eye here. A short ball outside off - it's well above the waist and climbing - yet Seifert is able to get right on top of it and launch it over the bowler's head. <b>Special hitting</b>
"full on off stump, works it to mid-on"
"<b>inside out and down the ground</b>. He really is monstrous the moment he can go down the ground. He makes that possible against this full ball on leg stump by staying beside it and then it's all about that big, powerful bat swing. Guptill has definitely hit form!"
"<b>taken at mid-off</b>. Tries to recreate the magic from the last ball. Tries to pull off that inside out loft down the ground again. But two things are amiss. One, the length is shorter. And two, Rauf has pushed this ball so much more into his body, meaning he just does not have the leverage to go over the top. Poor shot selection and he's gone"
"full on off stump, defends it with an open face down to third man"
punches a short of a length ball on off stump to cover
"<b>past mid-on</b>. It's a tough stop. But Seifert didn't quite time it as well as he could have. He definitely wants to drill this down the ground, but it comes off the bat a little higher than he would like. Shaheen is the fielder needing to dive to his left, and he lets it through"
stands tall and punches a short of a length ball outside off to point
"<b>stays low</b> and possibly even sticks in the pitch a little as Williamson, setting up to play against a short ball, is actually off his feet and instead realises he has to push his body downward to meet the ball outside off and work it to midwicket"
"<b>chops on</b>! That's happened a few times before. It's short. It's wide. And oddly enough, his footwork, moving back and across, works against him here because he gets too close to the ball and ends up reducing the room he had to cut the ball. That little reduction is enough to secure the inside edge onto his stumps. Williamson hunches over his bat and stares at the pitch as if it's betrayed him. Maybe he thought that ball would come onto the bat more, bounce more?"
<b>beats him</b> outside off as he comes around the wicket and gets a shortish ball to straighten past the left-hander.
defends a fuller ball into the covers to get off the mark
stays back and turns a shortish delivery on middle towards mid-on
lovely start as he gets a legbreak to drift into middle and turn just enough to keep Seifert honest
"<b>top edge.... and it carries all the way over square leg</b>! Seifert is reaching for this. He's premeditated the sweep, allowing Shadab to hold the ball back and angle it wider outside off. And yet Seifert comes out the winner. Man, these big fat bats!"
rocks back and cuts the flatter delivery outside off to the sweeper
nudges a good length ball on off stump to deep midwicket
dabs a shortish ball outside off to point
shifts leg side of the tossed up ball on middle and lifts it to long-off. The fielder didn't see it clearly with the sun in his eyes. Not a catching chance though and he recovers well enough.
"whip drive, those wrists putting power into the full ball outside off, and finding a single at deep point"
"<b>knocks him out</b>! Oh this is lovely bowling. It's the magic of the wobble seam. You don't let it stay upright. You make it dance as the ball comes out. And when it pitches on the surface, it does whatever it pleases. Here, it decks in off a good length, cuts Seifert in half, and takes out his off stump. The on-the-up drive was the worst shot he could play given the trap that was being set. Ashraf has been brilliant today!"
defends a full ball on off stump
"<b>inside edge</b> and almost onto the stumps! Ashraf's wobble seam ball is creating mayhem! He keeps targeting the top of off stump. He doesn't let the batsman cut or pull. He may tempt them on the drive, but like Seifert, they'll be doing that at their peril. Here, since Phillips is still new at the crease, he is on the back foot trying to punch the ball through the covers. Instead, he gets a single to fine leg"
"full and outside off, smashes it through the covers"
clips a good length ball on off stump to the right of mid-on
"<b>beats him</b> with an invitingly tossed up legbreak outside off. Oh, Pakistan are feeling it!"
"good work at long-on, Shaheen falling right on top of the ball, potentially hurting his collar in the process. A straight drive from Phillips, full of power, is stopped right on the edge"
<b>falls in between three fielders</b>! Midwicket runs back. Deep midwicket runs up. Long-on races to his right. All of them tracking a huge slog from Phillips. And all of them come up short
"slices to point, but there's no run there, oh wait, the fielder's throw is so far to the keeper's right that it becomes an overthrow"
<b>huuuuuge apppeal for lbw</b> but umpire Brown says no. This googly might just have pitched outside leg as Conway is beaten on the sweep
"full and on middle, he drives inside out through the covers"
comes down the track and <b>lifts it over mid-off</b>. Calculated strike from Conway. He sees the fielder up inside the circle. He knows Ashraf has been thriving by hitting a good length on off stump. So he wants to put him off that and he does it beautifully.
"<b>fiiiiiiierrrrrrce strike</b> as he charges out of his crease again and isn't perturbed by the bowler going short to confuse him. Conway, who may have been looking at a straight bat shot at first, unleashes a cross bat slice that may well have beaten the sweeper, who only had a couple of yards to move to his right. It had that much power"
steers the back of a length ball - he's back around the wicket to cramp the left-hander and deny him off-side shots - to third man
pushes a back of a length ball outside off down the pitch
<b>top work at point</b>. Phillips has really smashed this. It's short and wide and he's very good against those types of balls. Hasnain the fielder takes the pace off the ball
pulls a short ball out to deep square leg
"wrong'un, batsman misses a swipe across his body, hits the pad. Huge appeal from Shadab - <strong>who decides to review</strong>. And it's not out. There was a spike on the bat, though I remain somewhat unconvinced it was bat. Was missing off anyway, it looked like"
"tipped to short fine leg, and they scamper a single"
"nicely flighted, gets a bit of spin, but Shadab gets unlucky. Genuine outside edge that races fine of short third man. Fantastic diving effort on the boundary and saves a run"
"googly, batsman angles it to backward point. Decent over so far"
"drives it back to the bowler, who's alert enough to ensure a single isn't stolen"
"flight once more, and he's played a nice inside-out drive, but only for one. Tight over from the Pakistan captain"
"targets the batsman's hips, whose swivel-pull couldn't quite connect"
"pushed him onto the backfoot, Phillips tried to pull it out of the ground, but only succeeds in getting it high up in the air. Lucky to see it drop between two fielders"
driven down the ground and hit's the non-striker's stumps
"slower ball, poked into the onside and they exchange ends smartly"
""
well' he's cut that away for four. No time taken to reset after that little break
dances down the ground and guides that to long-on
"leans into that cut. A bit short from Shadab and Phillips had tome to ease that to point. It should have been a dot ball, in reality, but woeful fielding means NZ are gifted four"
poked into the offside and they exchange ends
"pushes him onto the backfoot, Conway eases that through the covers"
"short again, and that cut shot is Phillips strength. No chance for anyone in the covers this time, or the man sweeping in the deep. <strong>Brings up the hundred for NZ</strong>"
long hop - this is a poor over to end from Shadab. He rocks back and bludgeons that to midwicket to pick up a third boundary off the over
"flicked off the hips for a single, and Phillips - the man looking more and more like a threat - back on strike"
"off cutter. He struggled to find any timing on that. Thick, fortuitous inside edge for a single"
"cramps Conway up for room as he runs down the crease. Good pace, too, 144.1 kph. Conway struggling for fluency at the moment"
"more of the same. <strong>Excellent pace from Hasnain, that was 147.2 kph</strong>. Beaten as he tries to help it to square leg"
"succeeds this time in helping it to the onside for one. 145.4 kph, this one"
a leg-bye finishes off a really good over from Hasnain. Undoes some of the damage of the previous one
"<strong>and Shaheen strikes first ball.</strong> Pakistan are pulling things back now. Looked like it was cleanly struck, but went higher that it did long. Slower ball does the trick as Haris Rauf has all the time in the world to get underneath it and sent the dangerous Phillips on his way"
"that's classy. A bit of a loose half-volley from Shaheen, and Conway just leant into that drive and split the gap between mid-off and extra cover"
"carbon copy. Perhaps even more beautiful in its execution. Shaheen doing nothing with the ball, just throwing it out there and allowing the batsman to use his pace. Conway suddenly looking good again"
"Shaheen bowls short, and Conway tries to dispatch him over square leg. not quite timed, and the man stationed there collects it on the bounce"
opens the face and guides it to third man
"cut away and COnway keeps the strike. 11 off the over, despite that Phillips wicket"
"opened the face but Hasnain beats his outside edge. Bit of a muffled appeal, but no real interest from the bowler"
"another dance down the track - Hasnain has him on a piece of string right now. Manipulating where he stands, how his feet move, and the shots he (tries to) play"
"and of course as soon as I say that, <strong>Conway nails him to square leg for four</strong>. He had been trying that shot for a while, but finally connects"
"takes the pace off, but he eases it to long-on and they push hard and come back for two. Some lack of urgency in the field"
eased to third man
keeps the strike with a little dab down the onside
didn't know much about that. thick inside edge onto the thigh
"clears the front leg and has a baseball-style swing at it. Neesham's not hitting any home run, though. It flies up into the air and Shadab completes the most straightforward catch"
"timed it beautifully, but unfortunately for him that pull shot went straight to the fielder. A yard either side and that would have been four"
leading edge of the bat down the ground and Conway's back on strike. He's suddenly crucial to New Zealand's hopes of putting up 165-175
bunted down the ground for another single
clears the front leg and smashes that to cow corner for a couple
"slower ball, but it's a full toss. Conway has enough time to <strong>carve that to cover-point for four</strong>. Excellent start for NZ"
driven back to the bowler
"holy moly, that's the shot of the series. That timing is sensational. Uses Haris's pace to just glance it over square leg, where it soars over the boundary for six. <strong>That brings up Conway's half-century off 39 balls</strong>"
gets off strike with a dabble to mid-on
"yorker, he knew absolutely nothing about that and is fortunate to get an edge on that. he was plumb in front if he missed"
"classy shotmaking. Driven back down the ground and the timing just sees it race away for four. That's an expensive over for Pakistan, and NZ suddenly well on track for over 170"
clobbered away from Kuggeleijn. That is poor bowling. Just put in the slot to allow him to clear the front leg and club it to cow corner
"<strong>and again, except this time it's six</strong>. Slower ball this time, but it's still very much in the batsman's hitting arc, and he hammered it over square leg for six. NZ up to 159 now"
"and finally he falls, but NZ won't mind that. He's done his job. Tried to deposit that over the cow corner boundary once more but this time the timing was only good enough to find the fielder stationed there"
opens up the offside and carves him past extra cover for four. The runs flowing along nicely for NZ now
"clubbed to the onside, but this time the fielder's alert enough not to allow two"
that was deftly flicked away to square leg and Southee keeps the strike. <strong>16 off the last two overs each</strong>
a beamer to begin the final over from Rauf. Southee gets out of the way and earns himself a free hit
smacked to the onside and Conway's on strike
"that's a top edge from Conway, which goes up so high Rizwan lost sight of it. Three people converged around it, and Rizwan was chasing after it, but appeared to leave it for one of the others. Faheem got closest to it, but no one touched it"
"<strong>and Conway finally falls</strong>. Top edge gives extra cover an easy chance, and a magnificent innings from Conway ends. There was concern about the slow start, but his 63 off 45 is what's held this innings together"
swing and a miss. Rare welcome dot for Pakistan
worked down to long-on and the two come back for a couple. 171 with a ball to go now
"sliced to deep backward point, and of course the innings ends with another midfield that allows NZ to come back for two. <strong>NZ have put up 173</strong>. Looked a bit doubtful they'd get there when they lost Phillips, but remarkable batting from Conway and some big blows from Kuggeleijn have got them there"
"<b>pristine shot</b> down the ground. He doesn't go too hard it at it. Just presents the full face to a pitched up, inswinger. Good work from Rizwan keeping his pads out of the way"
<b>inside edge onto pad</b>! Boult getting to dart the ball in is danger signs. And it's moving sharply too. Is it because of the lights taking effect? Rizwan is setting up for the cut shot and then suddenly has to worry about his stumps.
"<b>only just kicks the ball away from the stumps</b>! Boult's getting the ball to nip both in the air and off the seam. Rizwan's nervous block followed by an even more nervous kick is, well, both funny and effective"
whips a fullish delivery on middle and off stump trough square leg
"<b>lashes it away</b>! This is the shot he's been craving all over. The slap through point. Boult didn't let him with his inswing, but here he gives him width"
clips a shortish delivery on leg stump behind square leg
"<b>another ball that tries to trickle onto his stumps</B> but Rizwan stops it just in time, this time with his bat. Southee gets a shortish delivery to straighten on the batsman, whose block is not quite as perfect as he originally thought"
<b>kicks up off a length and thuds into his stomach</b>! A simple Southee special turns into a scene of violence as a ball he wants to straighten off the pitch thumps into the batsman and makes him hop around in pain
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
drops a good length ball into the point region and sprints through to the other end. Good batting that. Get off strike. Keep getting off strike until the ball stops misbehaving
"looking for lbw as he gets a fuller ball to angle into the right-hander. It almost happens, with Haider's front foot planting on off stump and his bat driving outside the line of the ball and getting an inside edge towards mid-on"
defends a good length ball on off stump from wider of the crease
tucks a shortish delivery in front of square leg
pulls a back of a length ball skidding into him to deep backward square leg
"<b>sharp bouncer</b> and Haider knows better than to trifle with it. Shapes to hook, but then realises it's got too much oomph."
<b>he's picked up the slower ball and how!</b>. He clears the front leg and waits for the full ball on off stump. Waits and waits and waits until the perfect moment to smear it over extra cover. Great batting
stands tall against a back of a length ball outside off and guides it to point
whips a shortish ball on leg stump away to deep midwicket. Good running gets them two as well. Pakistan have started very well tonight.
defends a fuller ball - slower as well - towards midwicket
"<b>outstanding shot</b>! It's a half-volley, fine. It doesn't need much more than a simple straight bat coming down on it. Sure. But Rizwan does it all so very very well."
"slight inside edge as he tries to work around his front pad, and a good length ball on off stump wanders away to midwicket"
"low full toss, sliding into the pads, he flicks to deep square leg"
"<b>gorgeous shot</b>! They're picking the slower balls. Those are the most dangerous balls on the pitch. Or at least they seemed to be when it was dryer in the evening. Now though, maybe with the impact of dew, it simply continues to come onto the bat. Rizwan pulls this one - it's so short - away to the square leg boundary"
works a fuller delivery on middle and leg through midwicket
"<b>pooooooooor start</b>. With fine leg up, he drags a length ball down the leg side and Rizwan has the very easy job of flicking the ball over the top and to the boundary"
"back of a length on middle, Rizwan tries to whip it again, but the natural extra bounce that a 6'8' bowler messes with his timing"
defends a back of a length ball on off stump
blocks a fullish ball into the covers
looks for a quick single after dropping the back of a length ball in front of point. Phillips though came in very quickly and denied him the chance
pulls it away over fine leg. An over that started poorly ends in exactly the same way as the bowler goes too straight and Rizwan is set up on the back foot to exploit that so so well.
"<b>dropped</b> but boy, was that ever hit hard. Haider has put everything into the shot. It's flying to Guptill. He sees it well. Moves to his right with both hands. The ball flicks the fingertips and slips off into the covers"
"<b>that is a ripppaaaahhhhhhh!</b> A one-handed rippppaaaahhhhhh! Guptill had just stepped away to take care of those fingers that must be burning right now. Daryl Mitchell came in as a sub and immediately he has pulled off the impossible. A back of a length ball that stops on the pitch gets a leading edge as Haider, who plays with hard hands, who succeeds with hard hands, here watches the ball spoon over the off side infield. He might think he's got enough on it to beat the man tracking back. But Mitchell keeps his eye on it as he runs sideways and back from cover, then propels himself further with an acrobatic dive and finally thrusts his right hand up and behind him and it sticks. IT STICKS!"
"shortish delivery on off stump, blocks it"
<b>dude's in form!</b>. He sees the short ball early. He swivels on the back foot. And it soars over to the midwicket boundary.
"full and outside off, drills it to point"
brings him forward with a good length ball angled into off stump and Hafeez is able to nudge it behind square leg
rocks back and slices the shortish ball away to the sweeper
defends a tossed up ball on middle and off stump
premeditates a sweep and Sodhi does just about enough to deny him his timing. Drags the ball outside off. Pulls his length back. Adds more overspin and makes it bounce enough to take a top edge past fine leg's left
"loops it up outside off, Rizwan wants to lash it through the covers, but it dips on him and he doesn't get the timing he likes on it"
"short and spinning away outside off, he rocks back and pulls to deep midwicket"
works a flighted delivery on off stump down to long-on
pops a length ball on off stump down to long-on
"full and outside off, Hafeez wants to drill it through the covers, but it comes on slower to the bat and so he gets a inside edge to midwicket"
"<b>amazing timing</b>! It looks like a gentle little flick. The kind that only gets you one run. Except the moment it leaves the bat, it absolutely flies. Sodhi is the man at long leg, racing to his left. He dives at the ball, lands awkwardly on the back of his thighs, seems to have injured himself and has let the boundary through too"
"angry fast bowler responds with a bouncer, climbing well past Hafeez's right shoulder. He shouldn't be hooking at those, but he still tries to, and is beaten."
"back of a length and outside off, steers it to deep third man"
turns a good length ball on off stump to deep square leg
back of a length slower ball that Hafeez taps down to third man
"full and swinging into the pads, Rizwan falls over as he tries to flick, half an appeal for lbw, but was going down leg"
short-arm pull to long leg.
"fuller ball outside off, he defends to point"
gets under the short ball outside off stump and scoop-pulls it over the fine leg boundary. <b>He's in special form</b> here.

tucks a fuller delivery on middle to midwicket
drops a shortish delivery on off stump to the right of the wicketkeeper for an easy single.
pulls a short ball from outside off away to the left of long leg

"short ball to end the over, he pulls it to midwicket"
""
"fuller, Rizwan gets onto the front foot and drives it down to long-on"
opens the face and runs it down to third man
slower ball with a touch of width. Angled to third man
"crunched through the covers, but straight to backward point. A bit either side and that had four all over it"
poked into the offside and they scuttle through for a single
"<strong>clears the mid-off fielder!</strong> That looked like Williamson's leap might just allow him to get a mitt on that, but it clears him by centimetres"
rocks back and pulls him away to square leg
"made room for himself and smashed to backward point, but straight to the man. Rizwan needs to be getting a move on"
"Boult comes around the wicket and Rizwan slaps a forehand through the covers. <strong>That brings up the 50-partnership in 38 balls</strong>, and Rizwan moves to 48"
gets it off the splice of the bat and watches it trickle down to fine leg
"that's given wide, huge appeal from New Zealand! Hafeez pulled loosely at a legsidish ball, and NZ were convincing with their appeal. Once given wide, though, Boult has a cheeky smile on his face. Good umpiring"
"gets the bouncer horribly wrong. Wayyy over everyone, and the keeper did well to endure it didn't go for extra runs"
yorker length and Hafeez digs it out to keep the strike.
"off-stump line, Hafeez eases it into the covers for a single"
"takes a single down the onside, and <strong>that brings up his first T20I half-century</strong>. It's a decent innings in a vacuum, but with Pakistan chasing a somewhat steep total, you would like to see him bring it up at a better strike rate"
"shorter length, defended back to the bowler"
"that's glorious. Huge six from Mohammad Hafeez, and <strong>it bounces off the roof!</strong>. Short ball, but Neesham doesn't really have the pace to intimidate Hafeez bowling at that length. Hafeez rocks back, and plasters him over square leg!"
"worked to backward point and calls Rizwan in for a quick single. The keeper needs to put in a dive and he needed it, because that was a direct hit"
"smears it to midwicket, another flat-batted shot. Only finds the fielder, though. Set up for a very exciting finish, this."
"slower ball, and Rizwan latches on! <strong>Huge six over cow corner</strong>. He's really beginning to come into his own now, and he clears that boundary by some distance. Pakistan beginning to edge closer to the driving seat now"
"another slog, but got nothing on that one. They do scamper through for a legbye, and now it's Kuggeleijn to Hafeez"
"<strong>and he strikes. Huge, huge blow for Pakistan - is that the one that seals the whitewash?</strong> Drove him on the up without quite getting it out of the middle and Phillips on sweeper cover gratefully pouches it. Massive, massive blow for Pakistan"
"starts off with a quick delivery, blocked back to the bowler"
crunched away to the boundary but only finds the fielder. Rizwan's importance to this chase only growing now
strong finish to a good over from the bowler. Rizwan nearly got a tickle on that poke through to the keeper
swings mightily but nowhere close to connecting
opens the face and runs it down to deep cover-point
"wow, that's outstanding fielding from Mitchell. He isn't half having a day in the field! That swipe had four written all over it, and Mitchell sticks out a paw and saves a couple of runs"
driven down to long-on for a single
guided to backward point and they scamper through
"that's down the wrong line, Southee's lucky he didn't put that away four four. Just the tickle down for one"
that's in the slot and Khushdil has an almighty heave to midwicket. Front foot out of the way and that's in the arc for him. Kuggeleijn should really know better
went wide and Khushdil went searching for it. Good comeback
"<strong>glorious shot from Rizwan</strong>. That missed the yorker by no more than two feet, and he bottom-hands it comfortably over long-on"
"ho ho  ho! That's cracked right into the top tier! Right in the slot and Rizwan crunches it over cow corner. <strong>This is a sensational innings from Rizwan, given all the pressure on him</strong>"
"beats him with the slower ball, and Rizwan picks up a legbye"
single to keep the strike for Khushdil
"slower ball, but it's a half-volley and clobbered down the ground. Pakistan getting these runs in a hurry now"
"<strong>but Neesham strikes back, and this is still game on</strong>. Short and wide, Khushdil tried to loft him over the long third man boundary. Who but Daryl Mitchell lies in wait to take that catch?"
single and now Faheem on strike
rocked back and a single down to square leg to start off
<strong>six from Rizwan</strong>. He's looking to get this done in a hurry! Length ball and he moves across and smashes him over square leg
wider and he reaches for it and keeps the strike
"wide full toss, lucky not be punished with four. A sloppy throw to the non-striker's end, though, and they still scamper through for a couple"
"that's a wide yorker, but a bit too wide for NZ's liking. Umpire calls it, too, nearly on the outer line"
"clever slower delivery, Rizwan can't quite get a hold of that"
that area is proving really productive for Rizwan. Slower ball but he goes back and across and clubs him over square leg for four
flat batted that short delivery. Didn't quite manage to get on top of it but it lands safe among two fielders
"good ball, right in the blockhole. Driven down to long-on for a single"
"<strong>that's a knee high full toss, and Rizwan punishes it</strong>! Slaps him to cow corner and it nearly goes all the way. Asking rate under six for the first time now"
"<strong>gets the wicket of Faheem! </strong>Is there life in this contest still? Nothing special about that ball, short and wide and there to be hit, but he only manages a faint edge, and Pakistan lose their fourth"
<strong>Two in two</strong>! Shadab gone for a golden done. A little too close to cut and he only manages to get an edge through to Seifert. Are Pakistan going to blow this?
"that hat-trick ball was on the money. Tailing back in to Iftikhar and he gets a thick inside edge. Three dot balls in a row, and this is getting tricky again"
"an ungainly hoick, there was nothing convincing about that but no fielder out there around cow corner on the boundary. NZ had one too many in the ring and Iftikhar manages to punish them"
"that one's timed better, but fine leg will cut it off. Iftikhar gets another priceless two, though"
short ball and Iftikhar keeps the strike. Sensible batting
"full ball to start off. Carves it down to cover point for a single, gets Rizwan on strike"
"this has gone straight up, and <strong>Pakistan lose Rizwan!</strong>This game is still alive. Rizwan thought it was in the slot and he looked to deposit it over cow corner like he's done so often this innings, but it goes high up. A glorious knock comes to an end, and Pakistan still need three"
"short and wide, that cut shot needed to be a metre either side of backward point. <strong>Three off three now</strong>"
"<strong>Iftikhar seals it with a HUUUUGE six! that's it, and Pakistan finally get this done. It was in the slot and Iftikhar swing for the fences - and connected!</strong>. Pakistan win by four wickets, they finally get the job done. That'll do them the world of good after a difficult month in New Zealand, and maybe, maybe give them a shot in the arm before the Test series"
