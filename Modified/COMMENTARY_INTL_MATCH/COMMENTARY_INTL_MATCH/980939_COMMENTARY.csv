"banged in on a good length on off, nips back in and swerves in to beat Ajinkya's inside edge. off his hips towards point."
pushes the length fuller and comes back in again. Rahane is half-forward but a thick inside edge gets Supergiants off
very tight start from Morne. Disciplined stuff. Du Plessis forced into a defensive push off the good length delivery on off
"and again, on and around off. Faf stays in his crease and then dabs to point. Not much movement."
"a bit of width but goes under Faf's bat. Kept low, very low and Faf made it look even lower with a late crouch as the ball passed bat"
"back of a length on middle and leg, faf tucks to square leg. Quick run. Good response from Rahane"
full immediately. On off and Faf pushes to mid-off for a quick run. Nicely done.
"another good run. Russell is quick on a good length outside off, rahane stands tall and plays a delicate dab with soft hands, towards gully. Easy single"
"a bit of  a fumble gives Faf one. Punched off a good length, to cover who reaches out to stop but parries it away"
"slowish delivery. At least, looked like it. 141 kph says the speed gun. Rahane defends"
"wonderful stop from Satish. And four KKR fielders run to him for a congratulatory clap. Outside off and Rahane leans on the cut. Satish leaps to his left and stops it, feet off the ground."
"full and straight, Rahane looked at a gap in the 'V', but the ball flies off the inside half towards deep square leg"
"lovely from Rahane. Just a pick-up. Poor line though. Full on leg, Rahane sees the opportunity early and just whips it with discernible use of the wrists. Over square leg for six."
"125 kph, good adjustment from Morne. Full on off and Rahane defends"
leg side-ish again from Morne. But pulls the length back. Hustles Rahane for pace who is late on the flick. Struck on the body
"lovely gap-finding skill. There was this big gap over midwicket, and Rahane picked it. Got a length delivery on middle and straight-batted a whip for four. As straight as a bat can be for that shot"
worked off the hips towards square leg. Another single
"hmm, interesting from Faf. He gets across the line and attempts a fine lap-dab to fine leg. Trusted the bounce and that trust saved him. Morne's good length flies over middle and leg stump."
"ooh, drifter to start. Good length on off, Rahane goes back but the ball skids on. Plays it away towards cover"
"another exotic dive from Satish but may not have needed it here. In fact, that exuberance could have cost KKR two. Flat on middle and Rahane flicks to deep midwicket. Satish gets across and dives but parries it for four"
"a touch too short on middle, Rahane hurries back and uppishly tucks to deep midwikcet"
"flat again, too straight and Faf rocks back to pick a gap at midwicket"
"slower through the air at 80 kph. Rahane works to square leg, off the pads again"
"beauty. Faf is beaten. Most batsmen would have got out to this. Shakib goes wider of the crease, pitches it on off and the ball straightens. Faf did not play for that late movement, and the ball crashed into off stump. A ripper to get rid of one of Supergiants' in-form men."
"lots of spin on this occasion. From outside off, it rips in towards off. Rahane shaped to cut but had to improvise late."
"flat outside off, not much turn. Rahane goes for another cut but the ball bounces over Rahane's outside edge"
"straighter this time, driven off the back to long-on"
"a tad too short, allowing Smith to rock back and punch to long-on"
"92 kph, on a similar length and line. Rahane goes back and plays a similar stroke. To long-on"
"fuller on middle, Smith gets a thick inside edge to short fine leg. Rahane calls him through and Smith hurries through"
"flat down leg, worked off the pads to short fine leg"
"this is much slower, but on leg again. Smith goes back and works to deep midwicket, one more"
"much fuller on middle and leg, nurdled away towards midwicket. Rahane doing it nicely, in typical fashion"
"ooh, almost got through this time. Flat on middle, a thick inside edge to square leg"
"this is down leg and Smith pummels the sweep, but straight to square leg. Pathan does well to prevent it from going through"
"a bit of width outside off, Rahane scurries back to slap a cut to extra cover. Tight over"
"Smith in action. Over the past few years, this has been one of his most productive shots. On off from Russell, Smith shuffles across and whips it off in front of midwicket. A manufactured stroke"
"closer to middle this time, and Smith works to square leg"
"superb shot from Rahane. Banged in on a back of a length, Chest height on middle. Rahane doesn't go back, but keeps his eyes on it and hammers the pull in the gap at backward square leg"
pushed to midwicket
"change in pace, slower delivery on off. Rahane executes a dab to third man to get one"
"oh my. What timing. A yorker on off and Smith tucks the ball in front of midwicket, for four. Lots of power in those wrists. Raced away for four."
"just short of cover. Slower outside off, Rahane slaps a cut uppishly, but safely in the end"
worked from off to midwicket with soft hands. The pair think of two because of how delicately Rahane played that.
"lovely pace from Shakib. Slowed up outside off and full. Smith is early through the drive, cover cleans up"
a touch short and worked into the midwicket region for one more
"tossed up on off, drilled down to long-off with the turn"
"yorker on off and middle, a punchy drive finds long-on"
"ripping turn for Piyush. Pitched outside off, the legspinner rips past Smith's flat-batted attempt at a pull."
"again, lots of turn. But this was much slower, allowing Smith enough time to go back and work from outside off to midwicket"
"superb placement. Lovely batting. Much straighter from Piyush, and Rahane smashes the sweep in the gap in front of midwicket. Fantastic execution"
"tip and run, played with soft hands to point, and a quick single ensues"
"flatter trajectory, Smith goes back to push to long-on"
too flat from Piyush. No turn. Rahane rocks back to flick to long-on to get one.
"fullish and straight, wicket to wicket stuff. Worked to midwicket"
too straight this time and worked to short fine leg. Another easy single
"drilled down to long-on. Easy singles, Rahane and Smith biding their time"
"very slow offcutter outside off, Smith struggles for timing, and chops it back towards the bowler after playing too early"
"yorker on middle, nudged to deep square leg. Decent over so far"
"worked with soft hands to midwicket, Smith wanted two straightaway. And he scurried back, made it easily. Good running"
"flat on off, Smith is quick to rock back and cut in front of point, another couple"
"ugly stroke that from Smudge. Googly outside off, a cross-batted swat finds long-on"
"superb delivery. Lovely pace and length. Forcing Rahane forward with a ripping legbreak and Rahane prods forward, a thick outside edge races away past short third man. Gambhir hunts it down to save one"
"in that gap again, two more. Really clever batting. Worked in the gap at wide long-on"
"flatter outside off, slapped to the sweeper cover"
"full and straight, driven to long-on. Another boundary-less over, but 10 off"
"a carrom ball outside off, Rahane goes back to punch to long-on"
"another delivery that swerves away, Smith comes forward to play towards point. Smith comes down for one but is sent back"
"flat and short, Smith goes back and swats the ball in the gap at midwicket. Fantastic placement from Smith"
"just a nudge with soft hands to midwicket, and two more. Classy batting"
"flat outside off, no turn. A square cut finds point"
"another flat delivery outside off. this time, Smith comes forward and consciously pushes to point with soft hands to enable the run"
"slow and fullish from Satish outside off, a cross-court forehand to long-on for one"
"gone, Smith is gone. Not the best way to go. Rahane pats Smith on the back as he walks back. A very slow delivery on leg, Rahane backs away and drills it back to Satish, lands just in front of him but he collects cleanly. Smith was well down, looking for some momentum. Satish whips off the bails and Smith is run out again"
"low full toss outside off, nurdled to deep midwicket"
"full outside off, bludgeoned to long-on"
"fullish on off, clipped to the deep midwicket fielder"
"ooh, the offcutter whiskers past the stumps. Thisara was looking for a big heave over midwicket but the movement took the ball past the outside edge"
"leg side-ish delivery to start, on leg and worked to square leg"
"flat outside off, no turn. Skewed to point."
not that short but Thisara pulls in the gap between deep square leg and deep midwicket for two
"strays down leg, Perera misses the pull this time, but the ball rolls to short fine leg off his thigh pad"
"carrom ball outside off, smashed to the sweeper cover off the back foot"
"a better throw and that could been KKR's third. Worked to deep midwicket, and Perera labours back for the second. The throw is slightly wide to the keeper, and Uthappa has to reach out to collect and then take off the bails. Perera is just in."
"another fifty from Rahane. Quality knock, a typical fifty. Full on off and nudged to deep midwicket"
"flat for six. Yikes, that was muscular. Another offcutter outside off, Perera plays it like he would to a spinner, the slog sweep just clears deep midwicket"
"not very well timed to long-off. Bowled it wider, out of the batsman's reach"
offcutter but ill-directed. Down leg and Rahane helps it on its way to short fine leg
"another cross-batted heave and Perera goes. Slowish delivery on off and middle, Perera is quick through his shot and the ball creeps in to rattle the stumps. A timely wicket for KKR, but more signs that spin and slow bowling is crucial on this surface"
"a slower delivery outside off, pushed to cover for a quick run"
"very full with a flat trajectory, a leading edge rolls away to the sweeper cover"
"just short of cover. The legspinner outside off and Rahane plays too early, the reason it went to cover instead of point"
straighter on middle and Rahane tries to sweep. A thick inside edge onto the body. Pressure building
"connected with that. Flat outside off, Rahane backs away, clears his front foot, and times the lofted drive over long-off. Fantastic timing"
"googly outside off, Rahane shaped for a hard cut but had to improvise and dab to point"
"good end. Flat on off, Morkel is forced to defend"
"Umesh's first ball is a slower delivery on leg, worked to short fine leg."
"full and quick outside off, 141 kph. Smeared to long-off"
"another slower delivery on leg, 115 kph. Squeezed to deep square leg with a badly timed pull. Rahane could have/should have done more with that"
"big appeal, but pitched outside leg. The slower delivery skids off the surface and beats Morkel's pull. Off the pad towards short third man"
"lovely from Rahane. Walked across, exposed all his stumps dangerously but was aided and abetted by a naughty full toss on middle and leg. Flicked over short fine leg and it flies into the stands"
"another slower delivery on middle and leg, tucked off his hips to short fine leg. 19 of the last two overs. Sets it up for the last three"
"Rahane goes. Just like the Smith wicket, Rahane backs away and hits the ball straight back to the bowler. Good height for Narine, though and Rahane has to go. Narine used his wiles to fire it on leg, cramping Rahane for room. Quality knock, but is it enough?"
flat on middle to start and Dhoni respects the delivery with a defensive block
a slight bit of width and Dhoni scythes a cut to deep point.
"huge. Nope, humongous. Morkel stays in hiss crease, bends his knees, gets in shape and slog-sweeps the full delivery way over deep midwicket. How big was that? 800 metres, I'd say."
"six more. Parried for six. This was the offcutter and Morkel attempts another slog sweep. This time, he doesn't time it well enough and the ball skews off towards long-on off the toe-end. Suryakumar Yadav at long-on leaps and tries to throw the ball back in, but ends up parrying it over"
"slower outside off, patted to point"
"bowled im. May not seem like it, but this is a massive wicket for KKR. Could be the difference between 150 and 160. Morkel backs away, looking for a cut, but the ball was nowhere near short enough for that stroke. Brings his bat down late on the fullish delivery and chops onto the off bail. Good length from Umesh"
"full on middle and leg, Bhatia closes the bat face to send the ball to square leg"
"oops, Uthappa concedes four free runs. Good chnage in pace from Umesh. Good length outside off but he takes all the pace off it. Dhoni misses an attempted steer. The ball lands in front of Uthappa and the ball goes through his pads."
"very intentionally played. Length on middle, Dhoni gets inside the line and pulls fine, past short fine leg. Two to backward square leg"
"full toss on leg, Dhoni could have sent this into the square leg stand but decided to bunt it away to deep midwicket and scamper back for two."
"smashed. Full on off, in Dhoni's arc and he goes after it but fails to get under the ball. Flat to long-off and he is happy to keep strike"
"good start from Morne. Yorker on off, smeared to wide long-on and Dhoni comes back for two"
"another flat six. This time Dhoni. Back of a length on off, Dhoni sat back and waited for that. Pulled with enough power to clear backward square leg"
"too early through the pull this time. Morkel bangs it in on a back of a length again, but takes all the pace off it. Dhoni is through the pull, hits his glove and bounces on the top of his helmet before landing safely"
"very full, fantastic bowling. On leg.  But Dhoni's hands are quick , he gets his front foot out of the way and whacks the ball in the gap at midwicket. Amazingly, he finds the gap too"
"four more. Dhoni doing what he normally does. Another bouncer on middle and leg, Dhoni gets inside the line and helps it fine, over short fine leg. Four clever runs"
"good end from Morne but 17 off the last over. Yorker on leg, skewed away to square leg for one. Dhoni wanted two but Bhatia didn't. Would have been run out anyway."
"given first ball. Big big wicket and Morkel has struck. Fullish length on middle and leg, Uthappa shuffles across and misses a flick. The umpire had no hesitation. Morkel has a wicket off his first ball for his new franchise. Was that hitting leg stump, though? Now, KKR's line-up will be tested"
"drifts down leg, Dhoni dives but can't collect cleanly. Concedes the extra"
four to start from Gambhir. Very intentionally played. A good length outside off with a hint of away shape. Gambhir steers the ball past slip for four. A very test-match like glide
"four more. Lucky this time. Shortish outside off, plenty of width for Gambhir and he goes after it. A thick outside edge flies over Dhoni"
wonderful running. Gambhir pats the ball towards backward point and sets off immediately. Good response from Suryakumar
"rather full on off, SY drives with the full face of the bat to the bowler who stops the ball in his follow-through"
"width and punished. Short and wide, Suryakumar laces a cut past a diving point. Eventful over, 15 and a wicket"
"very full on off, nudged away to fine leg. Not much swing on offer"
"quite full outside off, SY strides forward to block."
"ooh, wrong shot selection. Very full outside off and Suryakumar looks to flick through midwicket. Beats the outside edge"
he tries to steer one down to third man this time and some extra bounce takes the ball past the edge.
"gets that stroke this time. Shortish outside off, Suryakumar dabs it late to the third man boundary. Short and wide, poor bowling again"
"better adjustment. Good length on off, dabbed to third man"
"amazing shot. Too full from Morkel and straight, Suryakumar lays into an on-drive and times it beautifully. Races away for four past mid-on"
"too full again. Not a great start from Supergiants' bowlers but take nothing away from that shot. Full on off and Suryakumar flicks into the gap, past midwicket. Wonderful use of the wrists"
"pulls the length back a tad, on off and middle. Worked to short midwicket"
another well-executed stroke. Morkel takes pace off a fullish delivery outside off but Suryakumar executes the late glide to third man
"gone, poor call from Gambhir. Gambhir is distraught. Good length on off, clipped towards midwicket. He wanted two immediately but he clearly misjudged it. Tiwary ran in from mid-on, picked up cleanly and fired a good throw to Dhoni who had to just take off the bails. Gambhir's desperate lunge doesn't save him and Pune have the openers."
good tight start to Shakib. Good length on off and tapped to point
"flat on off, a hint of turn. Pushed with the spin to mid-on"
"91 kph, full outside off, pushed towards point for one"
"some flight on leg, Shakib drives back to the bowler"
"slightly flatter on leg, nudged to short fine leg"
"clears the long-on boundary easily. Flat on leg and middle., Suryakumar offers the full face of the bat to clear long-on. Lovely execution"
"spin, flat there. Down leg and well collected by Dhoni. Suryakumar doesn't lift his leg though"
"and another. Flat down leg, Dhoni collects. Another wide"
"nudged with the angle, to short fine leg. KKR getting a lot of free runs"
another deft steer but Dhoni has brought third man finer. He cleans up.
"nips back in late. Very late, taking Shakib by surprise. Hits him high on the pad, but sliding down leg"
"good length outside off, an angled bat deflects the ball down to third man"
"quite full on off, bunted to mid-on."
"lovely shot. On the up and past mid-off for four. Fullish again outside off, Suryakumar strides forward and hits the ball past the bowler. Races away"
"jags back in from outside off. Suryakumar lunged forward again, and cut out the amount of swing. Played a steer to third man for one more, productive shot so far for him"
"lots of ripping turn, down leg again and wide again. Starts the offbreak outside off and the spin takes it down."
lovely shot again from Suryakumar. Plants his front foot down and then lifts the ball over long-on. Straight bat again and picked his spot
"flatter and fuller on off, driven with the spin, to long-on"
"flat on middle, a hint of turn. Shakib goes back to work to square leg for one."
"very flat and quick on off, 95 kph. Played back defensively"
"flat again to finish, on leg and worked to deep midwicket."
no flight from Ashwin. Fired in outside off and cut to point.
"good length on off, wicket to wicket stuff. Not very quick. Chipped to long-on"
"offcutter on off, pace off the ball. Pushed to cover."
"bowled. 99 kph on off, another offcutter. Shakib is into his drive too early and gets a thick inside edge which clatters into leg stump. Pace off the ball has worked again, but Shakib, it seemed, played around that."
"legcutter outside off, and some deviation off the pitch. Too slow, though and Yusuf goes back to punch to long-off"
"another legcutter outside off, Suryakumar plays the dab. Dhoni sticks out his leg but the ball goes through his feet. Short third man prevents one"
"fuller than a good length on middle, pushed to long-on. Good over, stalled KKR's momentum"
"darted in on off, SY goes back to shovel a flick to midwicket hurriedly"
"suicidal run. No run there, at all. Pathan defensively pushes towards midwicket. Dhoni is quick on it, picks up, swivels and fires an inaccurate throw at the batsman's end."
""
"a low full toss on off, driven to long-on"
"some turn. Slower outside off, Suryakumar pats it to point and gets one"
"skiddy delivery on off, cut to point. A fumble gives the batsman one"
"full on middle, 107 kph. Quick. Almost through Yusuf, a thick inside edge gets four Pune fielders after it. Just one though"
"legcutter on middle and leg, punched to long-on"
"another legcutter on leg, clipped to midwicket. Faf runs around, dives and prevents it from going through"
"another cutter on middle, Yusuf nudges to midwicket for one."
"full length on middle, 122 kph. Changing his pace every ball. Driven to long-on. A lull in play"
a legcutter to finish. Yusuf works to midwicket. He should be doing more with these. Only going to increase pressure on himself with dot balls
"whoa, lots of turn to start. On a good length outside off, the legbreak takes it further outside off. Played away towards cover"
"well bowled, dragged his length back to prevent a ball in Yusuf's arc. The legbreak spins past the outside edge"
"googly on middle and leg, Yusuf reads it late and works the ball past short fine leg. Races away"
"flatter trajectory outside off, scythed to the sweeper cover"
another late cut to short third man. Flat outside off from ashwin
"82 kph, good pace. Nice length too - fuller than a good length. Suryakumar waits for the ball to turn before pushing to cover"
sees yusuf coming and pulls his length back. A bit of spin and Yusuf cuts to point
"shortish length outside off, pushed to deep cover. Good bowling, hitting nice lengths"
"flat on off and middle, Suryakumar defends. Pressure building."
"a bit of width outside off, full. Driven to deep cover. Just two of this over so far"
"another dot ball. This was flatter outside off, and extracts a hint of turn. Chopped back"
"good length outside off, Yusuf pushes, with the spin, to deep cover"
"pushed wider outside off, Pathan laces a cut to deep point. RRR climbing"
"slower through the air, but good lines and lengths. Outside off, played to short third man with an angled bat"
"84 kph, slightly quicker outside off. SY finds cover with a push"
"first fifty for Suryakumar in the IPL. Flat outside off, Suryakumar goes back and punches to long-on"
"another dot. Pathan struggling. Flat outside off, Pathan misses a routine cut"
the first delivery that is full and Pathan lays into it. Pathan clears his front foot and swats the ball over long-on with a short-arm slap.
"nicely played. Full on middle, driven past the stumps. Long-on gets around to keep it to one"
"poor line. Yusuf helps a cutter from leg to the backward square leg boundary. M Ashwin dives and half-stops it, but the ball trickles away to the fence. Vital boundaries"
"big slog. In the slot, though. Full outside off, the legcutter helps the ball swerve past yusuf's wide bat"
"another slower delivery on off, driven off the front foot to long-off"
"91 kph. Pace off the ball, on middle. Shovelled to deep midwicket"
"good delivery to finish. Full and straight, no pace for the batsmen. Nudged to midwicket for one"
"in the arc and smashed for six. Can't bowl so full to Yusuf. Full on off, Pathan uses his long arms to loft the ball over long-on with ease. Made it look easy"
"the googly this time, turns back in to middle and Pathan flicks to backward square leg. Two more"
"short and wide, a late cut in front of point gets Pathan one"
tries to push the ball wider and the legbreak is too wide. Called
"tossed up outside off, Suryakumar cuts to the deep point fielder."
"very full outside off, a dangerous length but since it was so wide outside off, it was relatively safe. Drilled to long-off"
"slow outside off, driven to deep cover. 13 off it, KKR prising out productive overs"
"nice stroke. Not placed as well as he wanted. Slower ball on middle, Suryakumar gives himself room to drive over cover."
"straight and gone. Yusuf misses a straight delivery. Full and fast, Yusuf shuffles across, anticipating another of those cutters but the quicker delivery skids on and strikes Yusuf in front of off. Impact just inside off, easy decision"
"cutter to start on leg, worked to square leg for one"
"full on off, skewed to midwicket with a closed bat-face."
full and straight at 111 kph. Kept out with a defensive flick to midwicket
another cutter to finish a great spell from Bhatia. 4-0-19-1. Nurdled to deep midwicket.
"very short outside off, lots of spin on the legbreak. Consciously avoiding a full length. Chopped to cover"
"full to Suryakumar and he gets four. Lofts the ball, with the spin, over cover. Smith hustles across from long-off but cannot cut it in"
"googly, befuddles Suryakumar. Did not read that at all. And it spun too. Past SY's inside edge, even Dhoni cannot collect"
"oh lovely. Slowed up outside off, and the legbreak rips past the outside edge. Beauty"
"gone, big wicket. Ashwin strikes. The googly does it again. Suryakumar doesn't pick the variation and plays all around it. It spins back in, like an offbreak, and strikes Suryakumar right in front. Was it going over? Was it sliding down leg? Doesn't look like it. Should clip the stumps, at least. The set man goes. An end has been opened"
"another dot to finish. Flat outside off, skids on. Keeps low too. Satish fails to connect with his cut."
"good length on off, Russell can only drive to cover. Lovely lengths these"
"shortens the length again, very conscious of not bowling full. On leg and middle, nudged to midwicket"
"flat but a good length again, nurdled to wide long-on. Sathish wants two. Russell doesn't. Smith hits the stumps at the bowler's end but a full-length dive saves Sathish"
"nop, can't bowl there. Very deliberate efforts to prevent bowling that length previously but errs on this occasion. And pays for it. Russell lays into the lofted drive over long-off. 98-metre hit. Wonderful timing"
strays down leg and through Dhoni's legs. Two plus a wide. Nine off one legal ball. Pune now under pressure
still too full and that will be six on most days. Clears his front foot and hammers it over long-on. Did not get all of it but enough to clear the fielder. Big over
"much better length. Short on off, with a hint of spin. Driven back to the bowler who gets across and stops it with a dive"
"legcutter to start, Sathish looking for one to get Rus back on strike. Pats it back to the bowler instead"
"another legcutter outside off, Sathish attempts a lofted drive but a thick outside edge falls short of Dhoni, ricochets off his pad to short third man. Clever bowling"
"decent delivery. Very full, on leg. Russell taken aback slightly by the line but flicks nicely to deep midwicket"
"full, wide, slower ball outside off. Squeezed to deep point"
"there it is. Humongous wicket. Another slower ball, back of the hand. Russell waits for the ball to come to him but waits too long. Mis-times his big heave and it travels to Faf at long-on, who will not drop such opportunities. Does that make Pune favourites?"
"very sloppy from Tiwary. Full and wide outside off, Chawla scythes a cut over point. Tiwary runs around from deep third man, gets to it, gets low, gets a hand on it but doesn't stop it. The ball trickles across for four. Huge boundary"
"Satish swings it in KKR's favour. Has it swung decisively?  A slower ball on off, Satish presents the full face of the bat and clears long-on. Big blow"
"good length on off, dabbed to short third man. That is all they need, suddenly"
"offcutter on middle, Chawla works wide of the bowler for one. Morkel makes a desperate dive at midwicket"
"across-the-line heave. Satish goes. RP Singh is ecstatic in the dugout. Full and straight, Sathish attempts a flick but plays all over it. The middle and leg stumps are rattled. So are KKR."
"down leg and wide, Dhoni is not at all happy, a vexed expression on his face. Not great from Morkel"
"another sloppy piece of fielding. Not easy but that should have been stopped. Full on middle, driven straight back at Morkel who gets low to half-stop it. The fumble gives the pair one."
"picked up from leg to deep midwicket. On the bounce, but just the one"
"good length on middle, worked to wide long-on and Smith fumbles. Steven Smith. They get back for two. Wow. An immediate apology from Smith."
taken. Steven Smith makes up for it immediately. Great catch. Absolutely no need for Chawla to be the hero. He goes for an unnecessary heave and holes out to long-on. Good change in pace from Perera. Gambhir has his head in hands.
"it's all over. Umesh does it. Oh my. Gambhir's emotions have changed in a ball. All smiles. Another slower delivery from perera but some may say, he was too full. Umesh clears his front foot and heaves the ball over long-on. Massive. Umesh did not bother running, knew how far he hit that. Dhoni not too happy. But that is the format's design. Another loss for Supergiants. Another win for KKR while chasing."
