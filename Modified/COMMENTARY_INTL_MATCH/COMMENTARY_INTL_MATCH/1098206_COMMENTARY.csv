"hmm, interesting. Some swing. Good length outside off, pitches well outside off and deviates further away. Called a wide. Didn't look wide."
"good length outside off, defended into the off side. 132 kph. Not much pace from the look of things"
full again. Rather wide outside off. Rahane strides forward to defend towards point. Easy press forward.
"131 kph, angled away outside off. Inviting a drive. Clever bowling. Rahane doesn't like carrots and lets it go"
"better. First runs off the bat. Full outside off, some swing. Moving away. A thick outside edge to third man earns Rahane a run. Well bowled. Just a little more movement and that's dangerous bowling"
"good length outside off, fifth-stump line. Dhawan defends towards point. Nicely played"
"gets too straight this time. On a length down leg, worked towards square leg for a single"
"too full from around the wicket. Overpitched outside off, caressed through cover. The fielder dives to his right and saves runs"
"digs this in, short on off. Dhawan plays it quietly down towards square leg."
"oh no. As so happens. Short and wide, don't bowl there. Dhawan hammers a punchy cut through point. Beautifully played"
"better line. Full and straight, slightly too full. Driven back to the bowler who gets down to stop"
a loopy bouncer loops over Dhawan. Too short outside off. Dhawan thinks of pulling before bailing out
"nice run. Overpitched on off, Dhawan drives to mid-off and calls yes immediately. Makes the run with ease. That's India's strength. West Indies may not have seen too much Champions Trophy, but they have to be careful of those singles"
"short and wide outside off, Rahane plays with a straight bat, instead of a cross bat. That means, he fends well away from his body. Pushed towards backward point, who dives to his right to save one"
"drifts down leg again. Off the thigh pad or bat, or both. Down to fine leg for a single. Thigh pad for me."
"full and wide, some swing. Away movement. Left well alone."
"good length outside off, dabbed down to third man for a single"
good areas. Back of a length on a fifth-stump channel. Played down towards point. Keep it there to Dhawan
"a tad too full. Overpitched on middle, skewed towards midwicket with the direction of swing, for a single"
"good end. Fullish around off, goes slightly wider of the crease. Played into the off side"
"in the air, in the gap, four. Full and wide, gets Dhawan forward. But that's good bowling. Keeps it full. Dhawan skews a drive through point for four. Not in complete control but vacant areas"
"superb running. That's why his strike rate is always high. Good length outside off, pushed towards cover who is slightly deep. Makes it easily."
"back of a length outside off, no movement, but pacey. 134 kph. Left alone"
"sloppy. Good length outside off, played down towards second slip, who moves to his right and lets this go. Can't do that"
"too short. On a slow surface, it will just stand up to be hit. Dhawan pulls over square leg for a couple. Not in complete control again, but picked his area nicely"
"terrific. A very good delivery - full, around off - is pushed to mid-off for a quick run."
"back of a length on off, some away movement. Moves off the deck. Goes towards gully. Hits Dhawan on the arm, for which he requires some attention. Out comes the physio."
"back of a length on the pads, moves back. Hits Dhawan on the thigh pad"
"full and wide outside off, some movement back in. Skewed towards point. Good stop"
"back of a length down leg, clipped down to fine leg for a run"
"full and wide outside off, a very discernible change in line. Just to invite a drive, but Dhawan leaves."
"full outside off, pushed towards cover. Good end from Holder"
""
"back of a length outside off, seam movement back in. Guided towards slip. On the bounce"
"nice line, full around off, moving back in. Pushed towards mid-on from the crease"
""
steps forward and blocks the length delivery towards point
"neatly struck. The slightest bit of room given, and Rahane responds to that with a lovely punch through point. Straight-bat shot. Just opens the face"
that's not a good delivery. Full and very wide outside off. Slashed to point from the crease. That should have been put away. Some pace off the ball maybe?
"lovely line. Good length on off, no room, not straight enough to hit through the leg side. Dhawan can only block"
"that's far too wide. Short and excessively wide. Dhawan jumps all over it. His feet both in the air, gets under the length and slaps the ball over cover. Didn't even bother keep it down. Why should he?"
"nope, poor bowling. Short and wide, 118 kph, sits up for Dhawan to cut to point"
"good comeback this. Keep it there. Full, around off. Dhawan gets forward and pushes to cover, and yells 'nooo'"
"back of a length on off, stays on top of the bounce and defends"
too straight and Rahane clips through square leg for a couple. Nicely played. Just accrue what you can
"a yorker on off, nicely bowled. Rahane digs that one out."
"eeks. There for the hit though. Short and wide outside off. Some more oomph in the delivery generates some extra bounce, flying over Rahane's attempted cut"
"excellent single. 139 kph. Good length outside off, pushed towards cover for one."
"lovely bowling. Slower ball on off, not much movement. Defended."
"another good single. The lower-ranked sides, including West Indies, should see what these two are doing. Just pushed towards cover and they get one. That's a single off a good ball, which means it's not a dot ball."
"fantastic stop. Carter saves four. But don't bowl there. Back of a length outside off, carved behind point. Carter dives to his right"
"yikes, hit on the elbow again. Fullish delivery around off, pushed towards cover for a quick single. Kieran Powell picks up cleanly and hits Dhawan flush on the elbow. Ouch. Out comes the physio again!"
"nice. Full around off, Rahane comes forward to defends"
"a slower ball outside off, pushed towards cover for a tight run. Lewis misses the stumps at the batsman's end and concedes an overthrow. An earned extra, I'd say"
"that's filth. Short and wide, sits up for Rahane on a slow surface to slash through point. Got on top of the bounce to keep that down. And timing gets him four"
"bowling two lines currently. This is down leg, drifts down and Rahane helps himself to a run down to fine leg"
"too full. A half-volley outside off, Rahane presses forward and caresses a gorgeous cover drive. All timing again. These surfaces play right into Rahane's hands, build an innings"
"good comeback. Close to off, nudged towards square leg"
"slightly too full outside off, Rahane pushes to mid-off."
"good length outside off, carved towards gully"
"too wide again. 135 kph. Full and wide outside off, driven elegantly but finds cover"
"135 kph, full and wide outside off. Rahane wants nothing to do with this"
"nice start. Some flight on off, not much turn. Dhawan defends"
"flat and wide outside off, still a hint of turn. Sliced to the sweeper on the off side"
too wide. That'll run away. Short and wide from Nurse. Rahane looks to cut but gets an under-edge which flies through third man for four. Not quite in control
"beautiful. 90 kph, may not have seen it on television. Let the ball come to him and then just slyly opened the face to hit the ball through point instead of cover"
pushed in front of cover again. Just wrist work
"and again. That was a lot easier though. Flat and wide outside off, dabbed towards point for one."
"Rahane wants to have a look at the new bowler. Gets an overpitched delivery outside off, but leaves"
"shortish and wide outside off, comes back in. Guided to point. Straightish face of the bat. Insight into the mindset of Rahane, who doesn't quite want to play with a horizontal bat unless he has to"
"back of a length outside off, punched to cover"
"thwacked away. Drops short, on off. Cannot err short on a slow surface, allows so much extra time. And Rahane pulls - a cross-bat shot - through midwicket. Simple"
"full and straight, played back to the bowler. Better channel"
"overpitched outside off, 139 kph. Kept out"
"oh, bowled. Flat on off, gets some turn off the pitch. Dhawan is squared up, defends"
"overly full on off, jammed out."
"use of the feet, runs down and drives to cover. Hitting with the direction of spin. Played, despite not getting to the pitch"
"flat, quick, straight. defended"
"very tidy bowling. Quick on off, very accurate. Nurse' MO. Defended"
"sees Dhawan coming and fires this down leg, but Dhawan gets his pad across to keep it out. Excellent over to keep Dhawan without a run"
"spinning around and around, no idea where the ball has gone. In the end, the ball does its own thing. Good length outside off, chopped towards the stumps, and over it. But rahane has no idea because he is spinning wildly looking for it"
pushed away towards mid-off. Good set of balls these
and then Rahane gets forward and lets out a shot of all elegance. A full-faced drive through mid-off. Beautiful.
"drifts down leg, wide."
"excellent comeback. On a length around off, seam movement back in. Rahane is forced to defend"
"full around off, moves back in. Blocked back"
"looked very awkward. Back of a length on leg and middle, Rahane takes his eyes off the ball but gets a thick inside edge down to fine leg for one"
"flat outside off, spin back in. Nudged through square leg"
"Dhawan comes down and hits the ball to cover, off the pad. A 'howzay' from fielders around."
he's had enough. Gets low and nails a sweep behind square. Beautiful batting. A high-percentage stroke with Nurse not bowling too quick
"tossed up outside off, played to point"
"flat and straight, a thick inside edge towards square leg"
"short on middle, that's tripe from Nurse. And Dhawan makes him pay. Swats it through midwicket"
"full outside off, Rahane gets forward to defend"
"full delivery, some seam movement back in. Rahane lets this one go"
"too straight from Cummins, Rahane flicks him away to deep square leg. Looking for two, but they decide against it"
another good run. Point is slightly deep so Dhawan taps the ball towards point and sets off
"too wide. Cut down to third man. Kieran Powell almost over-runs it, but does well with that spin"
"another poor ball. Short down leg, not enough pace to trouble Dhawan, who has enough time to roll his wrists on it and keep it down. Pulled behind square, fine leg gets across but can't quite stop it from trickling to the boundary"
"flat outside off, punched down to long-on from the back foot"
"too full outside off, driven down to long-off with the spin"
"too straight again, clipped to deep backward square leg for one"
"overpitched again, drilled to long-off. Very simple batting, but quality through these middle overs."
"flight, straight and full. Played away towards midwicket"
"quick, and slightly short. Rahane punches to long-on for a single. That's drinks."
"loops it up, gets a touch of drift onto leg stump, Rahane defends for turn but there isn't any so he gets hit on the pad"
steps forward and blocks a flighted delivery on off stump
"hangs back to a flatter delivery, but with it being of good length, and coming on with the arm, Rahane gets an inside edge past leg stump. Lucky"
"loopy delivery on off stump, bunts it back to Bishoo"
"rocks back to the shortish delivery, but with there being no room, he can only punch it back to the bowler"
"allows the fuller delivery to come to him - hanging like a cool cat, deep in his crease - to flick to backward square leg"
opens the face and steers a full and wide delivery to deep point
"places the ball to the left of mid-off and skips along to the other end. Yes, he skips along, singing la-de-daa."
"fuller delivery on off stump, defends towards cover point"
"looks to squeeze the near yorker out through point, but the ball doesn't give him enough room to manoeuvre. Outside edge to third man"
"appeal for a catch down leg to the keeper, but that struck nothing. Or maybe a little bit of pad considering it isn't called wide. Slower ball, almost does Dhawan"
blocks a good length ball to short cover
"<b>huge appeal for lbw</b> but umpire Dharmasena shakes his head. Looks adjacent, so Rahane must have got an inside edge. Bishoo is specialising in bowling straight balls, skidding onto the bat. Rahane is specialising in playing for turn where there isnt"
"eases it out to cover point, Dhawan sprints over for a quick single but Rahane is not too keen. The no comes just in time for a direct hit not to amount to much"
clips through midwicket
pulls his front leg back and out of the way to drill the shortish delivery to long-on
"solid sweep shot, picking the ball on line, with it sliding down. Good work on the deep backward square leg boundary"
pushes to long-off
steps down the pitch and spooks Cummins into lining the ball down leg
"on the pads again and Dhawan whips it to the right of long leg, who seems flabbergasted by the timing the batsman had put into this shot. Nearly lets it through"
little top edge as he pulls a short delivery over to deep square leg
hits right across the line of a length ball pitching outside leg. Struck on the pad. No need to appeal for those but Cummins tries his luck. No dice.
"full on middle, Dhawan gets an inside edge onto pad and his partner pulls him through for a single"
blocks a length ball on off stump
"outside edge, but he'll take it. Almost an apologetic raise of the bat to celebrate a <b>fifty on comeback</b>. He would have much preferred this full delivery screaming through the covers - as he had intended - instead of streaking off to the right of the wicketkeeper"
"stays a touch low as Dhawan rocks back, shaping to cut and then presenting a fuller face of the bat"
hangs back and controls the cut as the slower pace on the ball makes it grip into the pitch and bounce outside off. Single to point
"pulls to long-on, using the entire depth of the crease"
gets down the pitch to turn a full delivery into a full toss and drives to long-off
"tosses it up on off stump, defends"
"shifts back, seeing the flat trajectory, but the ball pitches only about a foot in front of him. Slow surface means he can still play it out without much trouble"
and he's been dispatched over deep square leg! N-o-n-c-h-a-l-a-n-t. That's the fourth time in six innings that he's got to <b>fifty</b>. That blue on his shirt is starting to look shockingly purple.
"back of a length on off stump, dabs it in front of point"
slices the short ball to third man
"slower ball, reads it like his favourite book and then sets it on an imaginary bedside table at point"
"good length ball on off stump, defends to cover"
<b>no slips</b> and the thick outside edge flies away to the third man boundary
"too short, and Dhawan pulls it strongly to deep midwicket"
"works his wrists over a flighted delivery on off stump. It goes to long-on, he goes to the other end"
another short ball and this time Dhawan finds the gap. Waiting a little more on the pull to place it to the left of the deep midwicket
"another shortish delivery, this time Dhawan prefers to back away and cut through cover"
"tosses it up on off stump, drives to long-off"
"slow through the air, pitching just in front of middle and leg. Rahane leans over it and whispers sweet nothings"
drills to cover. A little either side of the man and Dhawan could have had a boundary
"back of a length on off stump, blocks"
"plays it nice and late and that is why even though the short ball doesn't give him much room, he is still able to slice it to third man"
bangs it in short and the batsman avoids it like the weird kid who picks his nose in the cafeteria
races down the pitch to haul a short ball through to deep midwicket
"scoops it up - totally deceived by the slower ball. Not the first time lack of pace has been Rahane's undoing. He likes the ball coming on, hitting through the line, all that. Joseph disallows that luxury with an offspinner, a teasing one. Rahane steps forward, looking to hit over mid-off, but skews it instead straight to the West Indies captain at mid-on"
drills a shortish delivery on middle to short midwicket
rocks back and flicks the straight ball through midwicket
nudges a length ball through to deep square leg.
"shortish on off stump, pats it to long-off"
"<b>massive turn</b> and it takes Kohli's outside edge too. Somehow it's thick enough to wander past Holder at slip. The Indian captain was set to clip it away, before the slow turn off the pitch made him change his mind. Even then he mistimes, shows you how many revs Bishoo put there"
hangs back to the length ball and blocks on off stump
opens the face and runs to third man
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
makes him hop with a short ball climbing up towards his left ear. Kohli defuses it towards square leg
"very little room, and some bounce as well. But Dhawan gets on top of it, plays late and crunches it through cover point"
chops the horizontal bat on top of a short and wide delivery to find a single to deep third man
"it went that far even though he was off balance. Tells you a thing or two about his bat, and his form. This is a slow short ball. Dhawan cottoned onto the length early, but not the lack of pace. Adjusts his bat swing and somehow launches it over deep midwicket"
"tosses it up on off stump, defends"
gets inside the line and drives to long-off
drives to long-on
"tosses it up on leg stump, Kohli drives inside out to long-off"
short-arm jabs it through short midwicket. Lots of bottom-hand in that shot
moves back to a reasonably fuller delivery and has to hurry into a defensive push to cover
opens the face and runs the shortish delivery to point
on the pads and Dhawan deflects it to the square leg boundary. Did it with the ease of swatting a mosquito
beats him with a pacy yorker just outside off
"low full toss outside off, Dhawan lashes it to the right of mid-off"
"ooh, that's fun. Cummins goes for the bouncer and it thuds into Kohli's gloves as he awkwardly tries to fend it away"
hopping up again to deal with a short ball outside off.
works a tossed up delivery on leg stump to long-on
"looks for that forceful cover drive, but with Bishoo giving no pace to work with, Kohli mistimes the shot"
"flatter and quicker on leg stump, drills to long-on"
"pulls a short delivery, moving away from him, through midwicket."
"tosses it up outside off, Kohli, pressing forward, drives to the left of cover"
"shortish on off stump, punches to the right of midwicket"
"good length ball on off stump, blocks to short cover"
gets up with the short ball outside off and guides to gully
"shortish on off stump, Kohli looks to glide it to third man, but gully foils him."
"wafts at a short ball, needing to get on his tippy-toes to get on top of the bounce. Even then the ball did go in the air to the right of gully. Not the usual risk-free style he likes to employ"
"low full toss on leg stump, clips it to deep midwicket"
"predicts the length will be short and the line will be just outside off, so he sets up on off stump, starts moving across, and pulls the ball through vacant midwicket. Clever batting. Spotted the gap in the field, adjusted his stance to exploit it"
"sweeps a full, straight delivery to short fine leg"
on the pads and Dhawan deftly works it in front of short fine leg
moves away to leg to flay a flighted delivery just outside off to cover.
flicks a flatter delivery on middle to short midwicket
"takes his time, does Dharmasena, but up comes the finger. Dhawan's lbw. But wait, he's called for the DRS. This is pushed through off the front of the hand. That is why it skids through to hit the batsman - playing across the line towards midwicket - low on the front pad. Snicko indicates no bat. Ball tracker says it pitched in line and will hit the stumps as well. That's three reds and he's outta here"
"tosses it up on off stump, defends."
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
shifts across onto off stump and so the straight ball becomes easy pickings. Leg glance for a couple between long leg and deep square leg
thumps a short delivery between cover and point
"fuller delivery on off stump, blocks to cover"
blocks a short delivery on and around off stump with a whirl of his wrists
"shortish and outside off, taps it to deep third man"
"lashes a full delivery on off stump to cover - and he is able to do so because of his lightning footwork, taking him outside leg"
lunges at a good length delivery - and because he has to reach so far in front of his body - he mistimes the drive to cover
spills a full delivery on the pads and Kohli flicks to deep midwicket
"blocks a full, slightly quicker, delivery on off stump"
"stays back, but with the lack of pace on this ball, Yuvraj isn't able to pick it away"
"steps down, and Bishoo spots it early and fires it quicker. Yuvraj pushes it back to the bowler, and makes Kohli do the splits at the other end to get back to safety"
"on the bounce to fine leg. I can recollect a few times he's got out like that. A bouncer on leg, well directed. Kohli's top-edged pull lands safely, in front of fine leg."
a well-timed dab to third man. Opened the bat face. Nice bowling. They'd like wickets though
"nice single. I'll say it again, it's India's strength. Full around off, pushed towards mid-on for a tight run"
"short on leg, well directed. Clipped down to fine leg. Not a bad length."
and then he goes full and wide outside off. This is a good plan to Kohli. He gets forward and crisply drives to cover though
"easy brace. 'Bowler's end, bowler's end,' yells one of the fielders. Good game awareness. Flicked through square leg for a couple. Nice hands, nice awareness of the field from Kohli."
"darts it in on off, punched to long-off."
"flat outside off, caressed through sweeper cover. Bishoo careful not to flight one"
"that has plenty of flight, on middle. Driven languidly to long-on"
"darted in on leg, clipped down to fine leg. No run there"
"pushes this through. A low full toss on off, drilled to long-off. One more."
"finishes well. Quick on leg, pushed through. Defended. Bishoo and Yuvraj will be happy with that result."
"good length around off, played to point. Kohli wants one, Yuvraj doesn't."
"excellent bowling. Sees Kohli walking across and fires in a yorker on leg, worked to midwicket"
"finds midwicket! All those dot balls and all that pressure. And Yuvraj feels he needs to do something. Gets across to a nothing delivery on leg. Full on the pads. Since, Yuvraj feels he needs a boundary, instead of a single, he tries to hit a gap past midwicket. All he does is pick him out to perfection. At least, the timing was sensational."
"a yorker outside off, left alone."
"strays down leg, nudged down to fine leg for one"
"short on off, a slower ball. Kohli gets inside the line and pulls down to fine leg for one."
"nice start. Full around off, pushed back."
"a slower ball outside off, guided wide of point for a single"
"the running will good in this stand. Full and wide, chopped towards point. Kohli calls Dhoni through. They make the run in 0.03432 seconds"
driven to the left of cover. This time no run
"tight around off, kept out with a defensive nurdle. Wanted to hit that through midwicket"
"122 kph, full around off, Kohli comes down and misses his flick. Struck on the pad. An appeal is quickly withdrawn."
slides into the pads and Dhoni glances it to long leg
"gets in line with a shortish delivery on off stump, glides it to the left of point"
"inside edge onto pad, which then ballooooons towards midwicket. Bishoo races in to keep them to nothing"
"loads up the pull, but seems to be a touch too early on the shot - well, a glide really. Dhoni just became a revolving door with the bat sticking out of it. Inside edge and the ball goes nowhere fast"
put away through cover and that is how you deal with a low full toss outside off
gets across for a little nudge to long leg
"slower ball outside off, Dhoni comes down and shovels a drive to the sweeper cover"
"too straight, Kohli flicks to deep midwicket for a run. Nicely played"
"a very slow, wide delivery. Called. Too wide from Carter"
