"not much swing but the perfect line and length. Good length on off, a bit of away movement, enough to force Guptill into a defensive push"
"Guptill now has 2 IPL runs. And what a way to get them. Strides forward and taps it past point, just a forward prod. And it scurries past Morgan at point"
"good length outside off, Guptill doesn't bother with this"
"gone. Bhuvi has the wicket. Guptill's IPL debut has not gone to plan. But not much any plan could do for that delivery. Fullish length on a fourth-stump line, Guptill comes forward and defends, but a hint of away movement helps in taking a thin feather through to Naman. Great start this for Sunrisers and Bhuvi"
"good length outside off, significant away movement. Steered to a well-placed gully"
"excellent over. Hits a perfect length on off, and Rayudu is forced into a defensive tap. No run"
"Sran, too, gets some movement first up. A good length on middle and leg, tucked to short fine leg. Lots of hesitation but they get through eventually"
"too much width and smashed away, short and wide outside off. rayudu stays in his crease, arches back and clobbers a cut past point."
"a good length on middle and leg, swings back in. Beats Rayudu for pace and it hustles him, struck on the thigh pad"
"full and swinging in to middle and leg, a thick inside edge makes its way towards midwicket for a couple"
"136 kph, not bad pace. Back of a length delivery outside off, Rayudu pokes away from his body but dabs to third man"
"134 kph, full outside off, swinging away. Pushed into the off side, towards mid-off"
"good length on middle and leg, nipping back in. Rayudu is late on picking the swing, worked towards square leg"
"poor delivery, started the outswinger too wide and it carried on, right into Parthiv's slot. Thrashed away to backward point where it is excellently stopped by Morgan"
"better from Bhuvi. Fuller length on off and middle, driven to mid-on against the direction of swing"
"short and wide again, another offering that Parthiv cannot utilise. Chopped into the surface towards Morgan at backward point"
"good from Parthiv. Good length on off, tight lines. Driven to mid-off for a quick single"
tight end from Bhuvi. He has conceded just four off his two. Around off stump without much swing but defended with the open face to point
"yikes, Parthiv has resorted to an ugly hoick after failing to put away a couple of cuts. A good length on middle, Parthiv comes down and looks for a swat towards mid-on. No connection"
Parthiv stays back on this occasion and gets a delivery to aid his pull. Smashed over midwicket for four
"fullish on off, a bit of away swing. Parthiv backs away and drills a drive to cover"
"slower ball but badly directed, well down leg"
"another loose stroke. Parthiv backs away, makes room, gets a full delivery outside off and looks to go over mid-off but the swing helps in taking the ball past the outside edge"
"whoa, loopy tennis ball bounce. Parthiv bends under and looks as it flies over his head, like an airplane"
"fullish again, Parthiv stays in his crease and bunts the ball past mid-off. Parthiv gets four more. Not timed too well"
"short and wide, inside the tramline but Parthiv misses the cut. Wide called. Hmm"
"got im. A lot of swinging has resulted in Parthiv's dismissal. Out the back of the hand, the slower variation cuts back in late, like a slow inswinger, and goes in between bat and pad. Parthiv slogs and misses. Receives a send-off in the process. Lovely delivery."
"pushed off the front foot, to mid-off"
swing for Moises. Outswing. Rayudu shimmies down and drives the ball back to the bowler after yorking himself
nice length. Fuller than a good length but Rayudu hangs back to punch to cover
"slower delivery, pace off the ball. 115 kph. Steered to third man with the open face"
"beauty. Full on off, but the ball swings away quite late. Rohit too fails to pick the swing, attempts a nudge to midwicket but the swing takes an outside edge to third man"
massive to finish the over. Henriques bowls a full toss on middle. A perfect delivery for Rayudu's swat. Way over midwicket. Poor finish from Moises
"133 kph to start from Mustafiz. Shortish and wide, played down to third man"
"loose fielding from Bipul. A bit too straight from Mustafizur and Rayudu clips it off his hips, Bipul runs across from short fine leg and puts in a dive, but his feet gets stuck in the surface and he lets it go through"
"full and wide, driven past cover and it looks set for four before Warner gets across and stops it."
chopped into the off side
"another one of those inch-perfect yorkers from Mustafizur. The only problem was it was a bit too wide, allowing Rohit to open up the bat face and guide to third man"
"out comes the offcutter to finish the Powerplay, on off and Rayudu defends"
"full on off, tight, wicket to wicket. Defended"
"slower delivery at 110 kph on off, driven to mid-off"
"too straight, 123 kph. Worked down to fine leg for one."
"slower delivery on a good length, probably anticipating the advance from Rayudu. Pulled away to square leg"
"what timing on that, full and wide, outswing. Crisply creamed to deep cover"
"shortish on middle, hurries Rayudu who can only find midwicket"
"tossed up on off, pushed to cover and Rohit calls Rayudu for one. But Rayudu disagrees. There was never one there. Rohit scurries back, but the throw is decent. Yorks Naman who picks up beautifully and whips off the bails. Rohit puts in the dive a bit too early and his bat bounces up. May have been in had the bat been down but clearly gone. Has himself to blame."
"slowed up really nicely, a touch of spin. Defended"
"short on middle and leg, nurdled to deep midwicket for two."
"tossed up on off, slow through the air but too full. Driven with the spin to long-off"
"quicker and flatter this time, defended"
"81 kph, on off with a bit of flight. Pushed to long-on"
"another cutter, the offcutter on off. Rayudu defends towards point and sets off for an easy single"
"what a start from Buttler, length on middle and leg, whipped away with a straight bat to find the gap at backward square leg. Made it look so easy"
driven to long-on
"full on off, a sweetly-timed drive is fielded by Moises in his follow through"
"a bit of width outside off, cut away easily to third man"
"nice shape on that drive. A bit of inward movement on middle and off, Buttler drives delectably but finds mid-off"
"some flight on middle and leg, Rayudu steps down but improvises a checked defensive stroke"
"flatter on middle and leg, goes on with the arm. Flicked to deep midwicket"
"ooh, looking for a massive hit. Comes down, maybe gets too close to the ball, and skews one to long-on"
"ugly stroke from Rayudu, steps down too early and Bipul has time to shorten the length. Squeezed to square leg"
"flat on off, Buttler rocks back quickly and executes a punchy drive to deep cover"
"short on middle and leg, turned to short fine leg"
"looked like a cross-seam delivery. Back of a length on middle and leg, Buttler tucks to midwicket"
"slower delivery outside off, Buttler shuffled across but driven to mid-off for one. Warner hurries but can't prevent the single"
"back of a length on leg, Rayudu backs away but is hustled by the pace, hit on the ribs. One run"
"oh no, what a way to go. Strangled down leg. A poor delivery down leg, and Buttler tries to help it on its way to fine leg, but is too late on it. The ball kisses the glove and Naman takes a good catch. Mumbai in serious trouble."
"back of a length on off, worked to midwicket"
"132 kph, on middle and leg, and flicked away to deep square leg for one"
"slowed up on middle and leg, hit to deep midwicket with a wristy flick"
"floated up outside off, a hint of spin. Rayudu drives to cover"
"flat down leg, Rayudu plays a fine paddle for a couple, short fine leg cleans up"
"fired in on off, Rayudu stays back and forehands to deep midwicket"
"flat again on leg, Pandya sweeps to square leg."
"too full this time, nice pace though. Worked away against the spin, to deep midwicket. Six off the over"
full and straight. Rayudu advances and mistimes a drive to the bowler. Just struggling with timing
"again, late on the pull. Banged in on off, Rayudu flat-bats a pull past the bowler for a scurried run to Warner at mid-off"
"good length outside off, 132 kph. Pandya goes for a deft late cut but misses"
"good-looking stroke but again poor timing. Good length on off, Pandya hits it on the up, to long-on"
"very wide. Very short on middle, loops over Rayudu"
"another offcutter on off, steered down to third man. Just the singles for the moment"
"what is happening? Rayudu may have run himself out, now. Full on off, worked to short third man and Pandya sets off without looking at his partner. But Rayudu wasn't interested in the run. He finally decides to go through with it. And makes his crease with a full-length dive. Not sure what has happened, but the third umpire isn't called for."
"skied but lands in no-man's land. Flat on off, no spin. Pandya looks for a mow over midwicket but top-edges it towards mid-off. Dhawan runs around from cover but cannot make the distance. Falls right in front of his valiant dive"
"big, huge six. Tossed up on middle, Rayudu runs down to the pitch, gets there, gets under it and gets six. A lovely swing of the bat through the ball, right over the bowler's head"
"flat on middle, swept to short fine leg"
"six more. Poor bowling, in the slot on middle and leg. Pandya swings and connects adequately. Over midwicket for six more"
"and again, this is even bigger. Gets down on one leg, and Pandya slog-sweeps this way over midwicket. Into the stands it goes. This is match-changing batting from Pandya. What an over so far"
"six more. Four sixes in the over. Mumbai suddenly have all the momentum. Full on middle and off, Pandya gets down and shaped for another slog sweep but because the ball did not spin, he went through with the lofted straight drive, right over the bowler's head. Huge over"
"135 kph, quicker delivery on middle and leg, tucked to wide long-on for two. 100 up for Mumbai"
"four more. Runs leaking. Another sweetly-timed straight drive from Rayudu, Warner runs across but fumbles and lets it go through. Not easy but Warner will be disappointed to have let that go through"
"back of a length on middle and leg, turned to square leg"
"full toss outside off, driven back into the surface, Mustafizur can't field in his follow through. One to mid-off"
"offcutter on off, patted to point"
"sloppy from Ashish Reddy. Full outside off, quick delivery and Pandya drills a drive to wide mid-off where Ashish gets around, but dives over the ball. Four more as momentum is swinging wildly again"
"legcutter on middle to start, pushed to the sweeper cover as Rayudu gets fifty. Nice rearguard knock this"
"full and wide, just inside the tramline though. Pandya shuffles across but cannot connect with his attempted cut"
"clever batting, knew the gaps in the field and found one brilliantly. Yorker outside off, well bowled, but that is not the best delivery with this field. Steered past short third man for another four"
"very full on middle, better delivery, skewed to wide long-on, two more"
"slower cutter outside off, Pandya backs away this time and struggles to reach this."
"well-executed yorker on off, jammed back to the bowler."
"quick offcutter on leg, bunted to long-on"
"full toss outside off, Pandya shuffles across but misses a routine flick. Big appeal but struck him outside off"
lovely offcutter again on leg from Mustafiz. Rayudu plays it out
"the second full toss of the over, smothered to square leg and Rayudu hurries back for two"
superb. Unplayable. Rayudu comes down but the offcutter swerves past Rayudu's outside edge
yorker on leg to finish. Rayudu backs away but drives to long-on. Good over for Sunrisers
"scythed but straight to point. Full and wide, good line. Rayudu reached out for it but fails to keep it down. Straight to Henriques at point and Rayudu's good rearguard effort ends"
"slower delivery outside off, Hardik is way too early into the drive, edges one to third man"
"whipped for four. Very quick hands to get his bat down and the placement. Full on off, Pandya uses some wristy power to get it behind square for four"
"another loopy wide, the third of the innings. Pandya goes after it but cannot connect"
"very full outside off, at 137 kph and Krunal is unable to get under it. Drills to Morgan at mid-off"
"big swing but Hardik misses. Full and wide, Hardik looks for an expansive stroke down the ground, misses"
"excellent finish, another canny slower ball from the back of the hand. Hardik is way too early through his slog."
"yorker outside off, very good lines but Krunal gets across and works it to deep midwicket, badly timed and therefore they get back for two"
"another yorker outside off, Krunal opens the bat face and steers to third man"
"offcutter this time outside off, Pandya skews this with the angle, down to third man who fumbles. Just the one though"
"low full toss outside off, chipped to long-on. Great bowling"
"Hardik's misery ends. A low full toss on leg, Hardik just misses a swat. The pace rushes him and the ball clatters into middle and leg stump. Mustafizur has his first of the day"
very wide full toss down leg. An extra run for Mumbai
"beauty. Slower ofcutter on leg, Harbhajan loops it back, and it lands just in front of Mustafiz in his follow through"
full and wide outside off. May have been wide had Krunal not gone after it. Sliced behind point for a quick couple
"very full, good yorker on off, drilled to long-off, just one this time"
"slower legcutter outside off, Harbhajan misses an expansive stroke. No bye either"
"wonderful execution of the yorker, outside off. Jammed to point, just one"
"slower delivery outside off, Krunal toe-ends it over cover, Moises mis-judged it a touch and laboured back instead of going full-tilt. The one-handed stunner over is head is not pulled off"
"superb end from Bhuvi. Amazing yorker to finish, Krunal get bat on it and he ends up with 49"
"wide down leg to start, fullish with plenty of swing. Ill-directed though"
"nice run. Full on off, immediate adjustment from Southee. Pushes to mid-off for a quick run"
superb from Southee. Lovely insiwnging yorker. Dhawan is struck on the leg before he could even think of bringing his bat down. He is left floored by the swing
a bit of width and slapped through point for a couple
"lovely lines. Very full on middle, late swing. Dhawan gets his bat down late, and inside-edges onto his pad"
"Dhawan's struggles continue. he has failed to adjust to Southee's swing for the whole over and this time it does him. Very full, in fact a low full toss, looks like it was heading down. Off the pad onto middle stump, uproots it."
"139 kph, full on off, another inside edge onto the pad. Southee on fire."
"that is one way to deal with these swinging New Zealand opening bowlers. Short and wide, Warner lays into it with all his might. From the crease, he doesn't bother moving his feet. And then pummels the uppish cut way over extra cover. Yikesy"
"back of a length outside off, punched to cover. Sweet timing again"
"four more. Warner looks in some touch. Shortish and wide, laced through cover with an exquisite cut, got on top of the bounce"
"<strong>left</strong>. Fullish and wide, nice away swing and Warner chooses to leave. This is very typical Warner, in Tests, ODIs and T20s"
looks to force it through the off side again. Gets on top of his toes and muscles a drive to mid-off
"good change-up. Shortens the length, a good bouncer and Warner ducks"
"ooh, beaut. 136 kph from Southee, good length outside off and some lovely away shape beats the outside edge"
a bit straight and worked away down to fine leg. Henriques will be happy with that result
"too straight again, worked off his pads towards backward square leg for a brace"
"more runs. Poor length to this man. Short bouncer outside off, sees it early, picks his shot and then upper cuts over the slips. Phew, almost gone the distance."
"dropped. But what an effort from Rohit Sharma. Slow delivery on off, Warner is deceived and through the stroke too early, lobs it to wide mid-off where Rohit dives but cannot hold on to the one-handed special"
"shortish outside off, swatted to mid-off from the front foot"
good bouncer again from Mitch M. Warner is happy to duck underneath
"goes for another late ramp over the slips. Back of a length on off, Warner sways out of the way but under-edges to slip on the bounce"
"good length on off, nurdled to square leg for a run"
"back of a length again on middle, nudged to square leg for one more"
"overly full outside off, tapped to cover. Not timed too well."
"short and wide, dabbed to short third man. Looked to get it past but couldn't find the gap"
"disdain from Warner. Full on off, squeezed to wide mid-on for one"
loose from Moises. Stays in his crease and looks to hit on the up. Feet nowhere. Ball swerves past
"fullish length outside off, a thick outside edge to third man. Another edgy stroke"
"nice offcutter on middle and off, played away to cover"
"good delivery. Very full on off, Warner gets his bat down in time and pushes to mid-off for a quick run"
"ooh, almost went through. Henriques struggling. Very full on off, the ball moves away late. Somehow, MH gets bat, to third man"
"slower on middle, worked away to midwicket"
"flat on leg, comes in with the arm. Warner backs away and muscles a drive-cut to cover"
"and again, a repeat. Fired in on middle and leg, smashed to extra cover"
"width this time, but Warner cannot capitalise. Chopped to short third man"
"was that a missed opportunity? Slower down leg, Warner misses and over balances. Parthiv cannot collect, very hard chance"
"flat again, Warner works off middle to square leg"
"very quick on off, drilled to long-on. Harbhajan collides with Warner and hangs on for a second before letting him go, finally."
"that slingy action takes the ball on middle and leg, whipped off to square leg"
"ooh, great fielding from midwicket. Worked to that fielder and sets off for one but is sent back just time in time. Warner returns and makes it with a full-length dive. Splendid fielding, but an inspirational dive from Warner saves himself. Buttler at midwicket"
nurdled down to short fine leg
"Bumrah executes a lovely yorker on off, Henriques keeps it out. But he oversteps."
"good bowling. The same reaction to a free hit from Bumrah like the previous match, full and wide outside off. Jammed to point"
"slower delivery on off, played out"
"another offcutter on middle, Warner doesn't want to attack one of Mumbai's best, plays it back"
"flat down leg, Henriques comes down, looking for a big hit into the leg side but fails to connect. Off the pad to point"
"the topspinner? On middle and leg, bounces a touch extra and Warner cuts to the sweeper cover"
"fantastic fielding from Mitch M. Full and wide outside off, slashed to short third man where Mitch M dives to his right and stops it"
massive. That is huge. Henriques comes down and slogs it way over midwicket. Looked like it went a 1000 metres. Humongous
"flatter delivery on middle, pushed back"
deft touch from Moises. Flat outside off and Henriques opens the face to guide the ball past short third man for four.
"119 kph, easy paced short ball, Warner saw it early, not that he was taxed. It was banged into the middle of the deck. Pandya ideally shouldn't be bowling those. Warner bashes it over midwicket"
"veers to the leg side to try and cut a shortish ball through point and short third man. Took it off the stumps, but cannot place it well enough"
"the keeper went up straight away, the bowler too was very vociferous. The ump silenced it quickly enough. There seemed to be a noise, but it came almost after the ball passed the bat. Henriques was looking to force the ball away with a closed face. Too much bounce, and the ball seamed back in to refuse him the leverge he wanted. Snicko says there wasn't contact with the bat"
clips it off his hips to deep square leg
"banged in short, Warner gets under it"
""
slashed through the covers as Bhajji tosses one up outside off
"saw him coming down the track and pulled his length back. Good work from Harbhajan, kept the batsman to a single to long-on"
picks the length ridiculously early. Short and he leaps back to pull it to the right of deep midwicket. Two taken
another couple. Big ground in Hyderabad and Warner is picking the gaps nicely. Waited a second extra to cut the ball to the right of the sweeper
that time his option to cut was a little too ambitious. Bhajji slowed it up and tossed it up. Should have been forward
"muscled over cover! Clears his front leg, takes a flighted ball on off stump, opens the face of the bat and then concentrates on getting it over the fielder inside the circle because there is no one behind him"
"beauty and picks up the wicket straightaway. Banana swing and Henriques is lulled into a loose stroke. Full and wide with that away swing, Henriques drives loosely, his feet nowhere near the ball. A thick outside edge is easily taken by Parthiv. The move has worked."
massive appeal. What a delivery from Southee. He is getting the ball moving this deep into the innings. Very late inswing yorker tails back in too late and too much. Missing leg. Morgan clueless. Any batsmen would have been.
"not a bad delivery but Morgan picks the length so early, the shortish delivery outside off is dragged over midwicket"
"quite full on middle, pushed to mid-on with the swing. One quick run"
"slower delivery on middle, 121 kph. Chopped behind point for one"
"ooh lucky. Full down leg, off the pad to the keeper. Parthiv does well to prevent it from going through"
so quick is Warner to pick up a short length. Hurries back and pulls in the gap at midwicket for two. Superb.
"in the gap and four more. Shortish on off, Warner hurries back and cuts between point and short third man. Warner using this outfield to accrue loads of runs"
short yet again. Thrashed to deep point
"tossed up on middle, worked to deep midwicket."
"and again, harbhajan doesn't learn. Drops short once again and Warner laces a cut to the sweeper cover off the back foot"
brings out one of his most productive strokes. Stays low and helps the ball between point and third man with a reverse sweep he was always in control of.
"slapped in front of cover. Rayudu does well to save one though. Superb fielding. Fifty for Warner too, what an innings, His second of the season. Using these large pockets so effectively"
"slower variation on off and middle, played away back to the bowler"
"another slower delivery, but poor line. Tucked to square leg"
"lobbed over cover for two more. Did not intent that there though. Shimmied down, looking to go down the ground but skewed off the outside half"
"another slower one, tight - on middle. Nudged to midwicket"
"too straight and worked away to midwicket, another productive over for Sunrisers"
"ooh, struck Morgan on the shoulder. A good bouncer on middle, and Morgan missed his pull. Everything seems alright"
that shortish length from Mitch M again. Morgan swivels into his pull to long-on
"Warner anticipated the length, knew what was coming and executed perfectly. just awesome batting this. Gets inside the line of the bouncer and hooks over short fine leg. Easy"
"short and wide this time, Warner cuts in front of point for another couple."
late swing from Mitch M. 135 kph. Yorker outside off and Warner cannot get any bat on it
"slower short delivery outside off, forehanded to mid-off for a quick single"
"good length on middle, powered to mid-off from the crease for one"
"excellent short delivery, and an even better catch from Hardik Pandya running in from deep midwicket. Back of a length on middle, Morgan is hustled for pace and pulls in the air. Looked for that gap over square leg, but it hit the upper half of the bat. Hardik Pandya came running in and dived low to take a good two-handed catch. Held on even as his arms hit the ground. Rolled over to ensure he did not let go off the ball."
"Warner showing how to do it. Gets a good length delivery and swivels into his pull, past square leg, four more"
""
"positive intent right away from Hooda. Full outside off, the ball still swinging and it was that away movement responsible for Hooda not timing the lofted drive. Over cover"
"another yorker on leg, jammed to point. The throw to the batsman's end is needless and Sunrisers get an overthrow"
"yorker outside off, squeezed past point for a couple. Good running"
"lovely. Another short delivery outside off from Pandya, and another boundary. Quite predictable that length. Hooda backs away, and ramps the ball to the third man boundary"
"wow, what hand speed. Another short delivery from Pandya, very poor bowling. Hooda forehands this into the gap at midwicket. Amazing hands. So high the ball was and to get as high as he did to roll his wrists over the ball, Great effort"
"slower delivery on off, tapped to point"
"slower delivery on off, pushed to long-off. Warner may not need to take a risk at all"
wide yorker and two more. Steered past a diving point fielder for a couple.
"huge six from Warner to put the game to bed. Wow, what a swing. Shimmies down and lofts the ball over long-on with such a free flow of the bat. Wonderful timing."
another slower offcutter but Warner backs away to steer to short third man
"too straight, Hooda flicks past short fine leg for a couple to backward square leg"
"full outside off, pushed to deep cover"
"very full outside off, skewed off the inside half of the bat, to mid-off"
bouncer to finish. Deviates towards Hooda's body and he is cramped on his attempted upper cut
"no, that has not gone for six, has it? It has. My gosh. Short delivery outside off, Warner hurries on his toes and bludgeons the ball with a cross-bat over mid-off. Amazingly, he has enough power behind it to carry over the boundary. My, my, my."
""
"that's it from me, says Warner. Finishes it with another six. Bouncer on middle and Warner pulls the ball high and long, over square leg. <strong>Sunrisers post their first win of the season</strong>"
