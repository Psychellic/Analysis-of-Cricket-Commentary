"extra bounce does Babar there. He attempted to cut it to third man, but the ball reared up high"
"this is what he had been trying to do the previous delivery. Cut delicately, and the bounce holds true this time. Just helped it along, and third man was never going to cut it off. Too fine for that"
"the other side this time. Morris overcompensates and this one's a tad too straight. Babar flicks it to fine leg, and the fielder there is too square. Had been a good over from Morris until then, but ends with Pakistan having managed 11 from it."

"cut away to point. Decent over to start off for Pakistan, could have had a wicket"
"big appeal from Amir. Swing straightaway, but appeared to have done too much. <strong>Pakistan will review</strong>, though. big call. And he's gone! Hawkeye shows the ball would have clattered into leg stump. Pakistan needed early wickets from Amir, and they have one off his first ball"
"shorter this time, and blocked"
"absolute peach once more. This is the Amir Pakistan have wanted to see. Great length and shapes it rapidly, knocking du Plessis to the floor. Amir goes up for the appeal again, but the umpire's unmoved"
"du Plessis flicks to midwicket, and gets a couple to get off the mark"
"good delivery once more, but du Plessis flicks it to fine leg and gets another two"
no swing this time. Brilliant first over from Amir. It feels like Pakistan are already on the charge

"fuller, defended"
"wide off off stump, and Faf watches it go by"
left alone again
"three in a row. Shaheen content to operate outside that off stump, and Faf happy to watch it sail past for now"

"short, de Kock defends through the offside"
"lovely bowling from Amir. When he finds that swing, he's a different bowler. Whooshes past de Kock's outside edge, the opener was nowhere near making contact with that one"

"fuller this time, run down to third man"

excellent delivery. du Plessis looks to drive but finds his bat nowhere near that one as it goes through to the keeper
chooses to leave it this time
"driven to point, the top hand comes off the bat handle. Another tight over, but South Africa look to be prioritising wickets"

du Plessis keeps finding that point fielder

"short ball, de Kock flatbats it, but no timing"
"right at the stumps, de Kock defends solidly"

"clatters into the pads. A muffled appeal, but it was always going to miss leg"
"looks to find the gap between mid-off and cover, but can't quite find the timing. South Africa are falling behind the asking rate"

"<B>lbw appeal, and given!</b> Miller reviews. This was full on middle, and turning across Miller. He misses the sweep, and ball hits front leg. But was it spinning too much? Replays say that it hit him in front of middle stump, but there's a thin under-edge. Miller survives!"

"hits the deck hard, blocked"
"width, and cut away to deep point, where a decent bit of fielding from Imam saves a few runs"
"bouncer, but is wide enough to allow Morris to free his arms and guide it down to third man. Shaheen came around the wicket, presumably to tie Morris up, but didn't quite execute"
"one of the shots of the day. Driven in the air, followed the line of the ball, which is deposited into the stand behind long-off. Morris still believes."
"full toss that Morris failed to time. Was in the air for a precariously long time, but Babar couldn't quite get to it"
"driven to mid-off, only a single"
"googly, but is a bit too short. Allows Andile to make some room and slice it away to deep point"
"Shadab got away with that one. Dragged it down, but Morris couldn't beat the man at long-off"
"slog swept. Shadab bowled the conventional legspinner, and ANdile was quick onto it! Right to cow corner, where it reaches the boundary after one bounce"
"flat, quick ball. Nearly caught the batsman out"
"scooped up again. Phehlukwayo is going after everything now. Only one this time, though. 8 off the over. Decent, but not nearly enough"
"quick from Wahab, as you might expect. Tails into him, and perhaps for the best he gets off strike quickly"
"does the job, as Wahab has for much of this tournament. 92mph, and while Morris might be good for a bash or two, that speed, combined with the leg stump yorker length, is just too good for him. Another nail in an already well-sealed South African coffin, you'd sense"
right on the money. Perfect yorker. Rabada does well to keep it out
"driven to mid-off, and Rabada gets off strike"
"short ball, but it's well over the batsman's head. Called by the square leg umpire"

full and wide. Wild swing and a miss
"dragged down to the leg side, a knee high full toss. Rare bad delivery from Amir, and Phehlukwayo punishes him by finding the gap at cow corner again"
"slower bouncer, and Andile will swing at everything now. Gets the top edge and sees it trickle down to the fine leg boundary. This will hurt Pakistan's NRR, which, in the end, is all it could come down to"
attempted yorker. Tails back in  but slightly overpitched. Rabada gets an inside edge or it would have uprooted middle stump
thick inside edge gets him to the other end
"beaten for pace outside off stump. Phehlukwayo looked to cut, and found himself late on the shot"
fast and into the body. Punched down the ground
"this had been on the cards ever since Wahab began bowling to Rabada. Another full toss that he gets to swing back in. Full toss again, but the tail is enough to penetrate the gap between bat and pad, and take middle stump with it"
"too good for Ngidi, that. Wahab came around the wicket, and the reverse swing took it away from the expansive drive the number ten was looking to play"
"full and wide, much too wide on this occasion. Right, Amir will be looking to wrap this up."
"slower ball. Phehlukwayo swings, as they say, like a rusty gate"
"squeezed behind square. That's a nice dig from Andile, who's putting together a nice, if inconsequential, innings. Shaheen dives at the boundary, but can't stop it trickling towards the rope"
driven through the covers. Ngidi on strike. Is this Amir's chance to take the lead at the top of the wickets charts?
"swing and a miss. It was another cutter, but Ngidi didn't quite look like he spotted that"
"another slower ball, and poor Ngidi didn't have a clue about that one. Just missed the off stump"
"chunky edge down to third man. They take the single, which means Ngidi will face Wahab next over. That could be fun ... for Wahab"
"144mph, that one. Had it been on target Ngidi would have been walking back"
"he is now. Length ball this time which moved away, perhaps off the seam. Ngidi's bat nowhere near the line of its trajectory, and Pakistan are one wicket away"
"what was going on there? Imran Tahir blocked, and just set off like a man who had determined he would not be facing one more ball from Wahab than necessary, Direct hit would have been curtains"
"slower ball, driven down to deep cover. Here's Wahab's chance to pick up a four-fer"
"gets his bat on that one, straight to mid-on. Last ball of Wahab's spell. Will it be the last ball of this contest?"
"nearly. Nearly. Came back over the wicket, but Imran just about got the outside of his bat to it"
"spanked down the ground from Phehlukwayo. Comes back for two, and that brings up South Africa's 250"
"didn't middle that at all, but the edge was thick enough to take it square of third man, and they come back for a couple"
top edge. Shaheen Afridi never quite charged at it like he might have done. Is that a run out? They've gone upstairs. No it's not. Carry on
"driven through the covers. This one was middled nicely, and a sloppy attempt on the boundary by Fakhar means South Africa get a four"
"rapped on the foot. Right, can Andile get his half-century. Needs a six ti make it happen"
"full and on the stumps. Phehlukwayo tonks it down to cow corner, but there's a fielder there this time. <strong>Pakistan have won by 49 runs</strong>, and are very much alive in this World Cup"
