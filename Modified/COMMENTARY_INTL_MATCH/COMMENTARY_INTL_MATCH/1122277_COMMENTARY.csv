"<b>and he hangs on to a deflection off his stomach!</b> A bizzare shot, but it was coming from Elgar. Ashwin was making him dance, really. He steps out, premeditatedly. It's back of a length from Ashwin so he's never going to reach the pitch of it. Forced to drive on the up. Hits it aerially into a jumping Vijay's mid-riff. It gets jammed there fractionally, between body and right elbow. He reacts quickly to juggle and hold on. That might have even carried to short extra if silly point wasn't there"

The umpire is confirming with multiple angles...he's taking some time with it too...His bat is on the line as the bail comes off. It's not behind it...there it is. Don't know why it took so long. Parthiv had nudged this ball through gully, they'd picked up two and AB was chasing it from third slip. Picked up, swiveled, threw it on the bounce. QDK was quick with his hands as he broke the stumps. It was Ngidi who put in a slide at the boundary and parried the ball back to AB, chasing it from backward point."
