"<b>scoop goes wrong</b> he went down early but didn't get hold of the scoop. It flew off the edge towards fine leg, where Mustafizur ran and dived forward to take the catch. But there's some doubt about whether he has taken it cleanly. Replays seem to indicate the ball touching the ground. Mavuta survives. Third umpire Dharmasena is confused about what the soft signal was and keeps switching between over-turning it and upholding it. It turns out, the soft signal was out - and the decision is overturned"

"stinger! This one leapt off a length, zipping off the surface and beating the outside edge. It dipped a little on the way through to Taylor, and he's left wringing his hand in pain no major damage though."
"this one hits a wobbling seam and thuds into Liton's front pad. There's a huge appeal from both sides of the wicket, and Umpire Rod Tucker raises the finger ... The batsman's not convinced though, and calls for a <b>review</b>. And that's a good call! The ball actually seamed a little too far towards leg, and the ball tracker shows it would have missed leg stump."
"first runs off the bat, and they come via a neat little punch through the off side. In front of square, but to the left of extra cover, and they scamper back for the second."

"cracking delivery! Chatara goes wide on the crease to deliver an outswinger on a good length, and Das is caught a little flat-footed as he gropes outside off."
"not much foot movement here either, but he's <i>laced</i> this through cover point. Right on top of it, eyes over the ball, and a lightning quick outfield does the rest."
"on the leg side this time! Chatara over-corrects, shooting one down at his pads and Das sends it on its way to the square leg boundary with a flick of the wrists."
"Chatara finds a better line outside off with another outswinger, but Das won't be tempted into a shot."
"<b>edged</b>, but it drops short of second slip! This one from Jarvis went like an offcutter, and Kayes thrust his hands out at the ball even as it left him. Moor tumbles to his right at second slip, but the ball drops well in front of him,"
"a touch straighter, and this time Kayes moves a little more fluently into position to push to mid-off"
"Jarvis belts out an appeal after a length delivery pings off Kayes' front pad, and when it's turned down they consider a review ... there's nothing going though, and Masakadza says no. He's right, too - it pitched well outside leg."
"on a length, and Kayes presses his weight forward to push defensively at the ball."
"a length delivery rises off a leg stump line, and Kayes rides the bounce to pick up a single to fine leg."
"Jarvis finds a tight line on off stump, and Das offers an equally tight backfoot defence."
Kayes looks suspiciously at the track after this one grips the surface and cuts across him to find the leading edge of the bat. The ball trickles safely into the off side
"Chatara's line has been a little erratic, and he fires this well down the leg side. Good take from a tumbling Taylor"
"a booming drive, but Kayes loses his shape in the shot and it ends up as a bottom-handed toe-end to mid on."
"flicked off the hip, and an easy single is the result."
"sublime! Das just leaned over this leg-stump half volley, and once it had the beating of mid-on the fielder could never catch up. Chigumbura puts in a dive, but succeeds only in tumbling into the rope himself."
"Chatara is a little straight once again, but this time he pings the leg-side field."
"that's a little sloppy from PJ Moor. Das flicks one almost straight to him at midwicket, but he over-runs it and allows a single. Is he struggling with that hand still?"
"excellent running from Bangladesh's openers. Das was back and across to get into line, and because the fielder is one the edge of the circle at mid off and the call is immediate, there's an easy single"
"comfortably nudged through square leg by Kayes, and they amble through once again."
"tight lines from Jarvis, and Das is happy to tap it back down the track."
"fetched! This wasn't even all that short from Jarvis, but Das goes deep in the crease to whip this pull firmly through square leg."
"outside off this time, and Raza sprints to his right at extra cover to intercept the drive."
"Das' bat has quite some middle to it. Again, Jarvis is short of a length rather than short, and Das is up on one leg to send the ball to wide long on with a short-arm jab."
Kayes is forward to slide one off the blade and through backward point for a single.
"punched firmly to point, but Mavuta gets down to it and palms the ball to cover."
"was this a slower one? It looked like the offcutter from Chatara, but Das picks it and glances off the front foot through square leg."
"in the air, but past a diving Mavuta at backward point! Chatara floated the ball full and wide and Kayes through himself into a scorching drive. He didn't bother to keep it down, the ball evades the field and he finds the boundary."
"that's a much better line, on a length and honing in on off stump. Kayes defends"
"once again Mavuta goes aerial as Kayes flays through point, this time to his right, but the ball beats him. Third man scoots round to keep them to a single."
"Kayes rises to meet a length delivery and punches to extra cover, but it's straight to the fielder, Sean Williams."
"fuller this time, and there's a one-two-three step shuffle down the track from Kayes after he leans forward to defend. He's looking for a single, but Das rightfully sends him back."
"off the face of the bat, and Kayes collects a single to third man."
"there's been precious little lateral movement through the air for him tonight, but Jarvis has managed to stick to a frugal line right at off stump, as he does now. Solid defence is the response"
"Das steps forward to drive at a full one, but Jarvis bends low in his follow through to stun the ball"
"Jarvis ends an excellent over with a slow offcutter, Das hopping back and across to nudge to cover."
"just a hint of nip away from the left hander, and it's angled down behind square for one"
"Das is a little more forthright in his intentions as he chops down on this one, but third man keeps them to one."
"using the pace cleverly! Tiripano bent his back on this one, but Kayes held his bat out and ran it off the edge and very fine down to third man. There's no slip in place, with the extra man in front of the wicket"
"a touch fuller from Tiripano, and it's tapped back towards him."
"Kayes hasn't quite figured out how to time them on this wicket yet. Tiripano floated one full, and Kayes heaves at it, only for the ball to dribble mid on. He lost his shape again, and perhaps it didn't quite come on to him."
"this is timed a little better! Too short from Tiripano, and without the pace to trouble him Kayes hammers a pull out into the deep. They've got protection at deep square, just the one."
"more metronomic stuff from Jarvis. He angles a length delivery across Kayes' bows, and the batsman shoulders arms"
"just a touch to straight, and there's no fuss in Kayes' flick to leg."
"probing delivery from Jarvis, right up to Das, who digs it out."
"slower from Jarvis, rolling his fingers over it. Das spots the change of pace early and collects a single to third man"
"full, straight, and Kayes roots himself to the crease as he defends to point."
"Kayes whips behind square on the leg side, and Chatara has to give chase as the ball passes to his right at short fine leg. He runs it down to keep them to two."
"hurled down outside off, and Das hangs his bat out to collect a single behind square."
"some timing here for Kayes, but the placement is lacking and his backfoot punch goes straight to mid off."
"<b>fifty up!</b> Tiripano comes round the wicket, and Kayes turns him round the corner for a single that takes his team score to 50. Fist bumps all round in the middle."
"Das leans forward to drive, but hits cover."
"slower ball from Tiripano, and he has his hands on his head as Das mistimes a drive."
"once again, a backfoot punch hits cover."
"flatter one on length, spinning back in from middle, tucked to square leg for an easy single"
"shorter in length, works this from outside off towards midwicket"
"too short, he makes a bit of room and steers this into the gap at deep point. Cleverly done, but some fine tag-team effort in the deep keeps this down to just two."
toe-ends this pull to short fine leg. Wanted to hit it a lot square.
"this is poor bowling, drops short and is lucky to get away again. Much more authority in the pull but straight to deep backward square leg."
driven with the spin to extra cover.
"length on off from round the stumps, Imrul walks down the pitch and bunts it to cover point."
"slips this down leg, tickled to beat short fine. Delicately done by Imrul, was aware of the fielder being inside the ring and directed this just wide of him."
glides this down to square third man for an easy single
"skiddy bouncer, Liton shaped to pull but decided to duck under it finally. Hardly carried to Brendan Taylor  behind the stumps."
works this off his hip to deep square leg
stands tall and punches this length delivery to extra cover.
goes right back and across to blunt this shortish delivery.
"the slog sweep and boy, he's cleared the long-on boundary quite comfortably. Brave, because he was hitting it against the turn. Didn't get underneath the length but went through with the stroke too."
"too much flight outside off, drilled to sweeper cover for a single."
"tossed up but down leg, the keeper fumbles as he can't get across, so in addition to it being a wide, they'll also scamper a bye."
"steps out and brings his powerful wrists into play to whip this length ball against the turn from outside off. Bounces into the gap between wide long-on and deep midwicket. Superb from Liton, he knows what he's doing. Is happy to take the calculate gamble and at the moment, they're all paying off."
sensibly dabs this into the off side for a quick single.
works this from outside off towards square leg.
worked into the gap at square leg for an easy single.
looks like he was ready to swing across the line but accounted for the dip and defended.
cuts but straight to short third man
"whips this length ball from outside off towards deep square, loopy throw allows a second. Lazy work in the deep."
"swept into the gap at deep square. Risky stuff, this was too full, he went across the stumps and picked the bones out of this with all his might."
"rocks back and pulls this into the gap at deep backward square again. Tripe bowling, too short, he opened up the leg side and powered the pull."
"looks to cut, but is beaten."
paddled to short fine leg
works this off his hip to deep square.
gets to the pitch of the ball and drives to sweeper cover.
"stunning shot. Makes room, gets to the pitch and goes inside-out to clear extra cover. Bullet hit, exhilarating batting this."
"short on middle and leg, pulled to deep square leg"
"slider, looks to turn to midwicket but gets an inside edge to square leg."
"short and sliding into middle and leg, he gets down on one knee and powers the pull to deep square leg"
gets outside the line of the stumps and dabs into the off side for a quick single.
"backs away to go over cover, drills this down to long-off off an inside edge."
"shortish on middle and leg, whipped to deep midwicket"
"the man at deep midwicket was too far inside the boundary, and so when the pull arrived, he had to run across and leap to grab. <b> This just eludes him </b> and bounces away to the boundary. Poor ball but they could've yet been lucky, tonight doesn't seem to be Zimbabwe's night."
mistimes this cut to point.
"short, slips this down leg and Imrul plays a superb short-am jab to beat deep square leg. In trying to put in the dive, the fielder ended up slipping and going over the ropes. Kyle Jarvis the fielder."
gets on top of the bounce and defends into the off side.
works this off a length from outside off towards deep backward square leg.
works this off his hip to deep square leg.

"slants one back in full, Liton shows the full face of the bat in defence."

"banged in short, Imrul ducks under this short delivery."
"drifts in a short delivery into the stumps, worked towards midwicket"
"wrists this into the wide long-on region, wanted two but a single is all they will get."
"too full and angling in from round the stumps, driven back."
"too short, sitting up nicely as he uses the width to thrash that to sweeper cover. <b> Half-century off 57 balls for Imrul </b>"
"too full, he makes room and then unfurls his wrists to drill this into the gap between the two cover fielders, top-notch stroke-making this from Liton."
leading edge that rolls wide of mid-off as they jog a single.
"scintillating drive that beats cover. A bullet drive that kept gathering more pace on this dewy outfield. Long-off had no chance despite an Usain Bolt-like dash. Stunning timing, magnificent placement."
"slides one into middle and leg, turned to deep square leg."
works this against the turn to wide long-on
"reaches out to drive, but gets a thick bottom edge as this rolls to cover."
turns this gently with the angle to square leg.
"reverse sweep but this is a good stop by Chatara, tumbling to his right at short third man."
"slices this cut, but straight to point."
driven back towards the bowler for an easy single

"makes room and punches to point, frustrated with himself at not finding the gap."
lunges forward and defends back towards the bowler.
right to the pitch of the ball as he works this to midwicket
"sharp turn back in from round the stumps, bunted towards point."
did the ball slip off his hand? Sprays this too far wide outside off.
"drifts in to pitch on leg and spin back in further, keeper collects."
mistimes this extra cover drive to the fielder.
steps out to launch this over long-on but ends up getting a thick edge to beat short third man.
"brings out the reverse sweep, but hits this straight to short third man."
eases this with the spin to long-on for an easy single.
"gentle dab into the off side, straight to backward point."
"<strong>dropped by the keeper!</strong> Thick edge as he shapes to cut, tough chance but should've been taken."
"makes room, gets underneath the flight and lofts this cleanly inside-out over extra cover. Bit of a tease for long-off as the ball appeared to have plonked but it just managed to touch the skirting."
steps out and works this gently with the spin to the leg side.
makes a hint of room and cuts to point.
makes room and then cuts this into the gap between cover point and backward point. Excellent improvisation.
"steps out and slices this straight to cover point. Didn't get to the pitch of the ball but went through with the stroke. Raza got this to drift away a wee bit, hence ended up eliciting a slice and this is nicely taken at the edge of the ring. Muted celebration, Liton has missed a great opportunity at making a hundred here. Bangladesh lose one against the run of play."
"he's full and straight to start with, and Kayes stands up to drive to cover"
"Jarvis slings this one down short, but it's the slower ball and Kayes is much too early in his pull. The ball takes the cue end and bounces through to Taylor."
"Jarvis is keeping things very tight, and once again this is defended."
"Oops, but his fielders aren't! Kayes scoops a drive towards Zhuwao at mid-off, but the fielder fluffs his stop and they're back for a second."
"in the air, but it <b>drops short!</b>. Kayes' timing evades him as he swivels into a pull, deliberately in the air. Fortunately for him he times it so badly that it falls well short of the fielder running in."
Jarvis ends a solid over with another ball aimed full and zoning in on off stump. Kayes steps into a neat front foot defence.
"looped up on middle, and Mahmud lunges forward to smother the ball."
"just a little wide of off, and he's back and across to punch to cover."
"speared down a little faster through the air, and Mahmud hurries his defence"
and this one he holds back. A defensive prod sends the ball to gully. Good over so far from the bowler
"What's happened here? Is this a <b>stumping</b>? Raza floated one up and Mahmud skipped out to meet the ball, but he over-balanced and missed it. Taylor juggles his take, and by the time he can disturb the bails (his arms tucked up like chicken wings to hold the ball), Mahmud is scurrying back to the crease. The third umpire is brought into service, and he's short!"
"well, there's a little turn! Raza fizzes an offspinner in to Musfiqur, who dabs at it with a somewhat hurried defence"
"dug in by Jarvis, and again Kayes struggles to time the pull. But he places it wide of square leg, so there's a single."
"there's a touch of wobble on this one, in through the air, but Mushfiqur keeps it out with studied defence"
"slower ball, and Mushfiqur has to wait on it before he pushes towards point."
"a nicely placed drive has both the mid off and cover fielders racing after it, and they hunt the ball down short of the rope to keep them to two."
"Jarvis pushes one too far down the leg side, and Umpire Rod Tucker calls wide. That's his first wide of the match"
"there's a bit more intent in this delivery, and it rises and shapes away outside off. Mushfiqur leaves alone, and Taylor lets the bowler know he likes the delivery"
"Jarvis hones in on at that nagging off stump line, and Mushfiqur presses watchfully into the covers."
"looped down full and straight, and it's tucked to leg."
"pushed to the off side this time, Raza giving nothing away."
Kayes comes forward to defend it right under his eyes.
"off the <b>leading edge</b>! This track is definitely starting to slow up and turn a little. Kayes goes back to one that dips on him, and the ball turns away to take the outer half of the bat. It falls safely, but conditions are getting a little tricky."
"too much width, and it's thrashed through point for a brace."
"Kayes is forward now, and he drives to long off to keep the strike."
"Tiripano's line is a little too close to leg stump, and Kayes collects a single to short fine"
"wide of off, and Mushfiqur chops down at it to add another single to third man"
"aimed right up at his toes, and Kayes chips his flick out into the leg side for a single."
"Mushfiqur steps confidently forward at a full ball, but he's into his drive before the ball has quite got to him and can only find mid on"
"Tiripano's return to the attack has been a relatively accurate one, and he keeps Mushfiqur quiet with another length delivery on off stump."
"there's a push into the covers, and a single results as Raza scurries across but can't quite stop it cleanly."
"this starts a little too wide of off stump, and Mushfiqur eases a single to short third man"
"looped up on off stump, and there's a bread-and-butter single down to long off"
"interesting variation from Raza! I don't think this was a leg break, but it pitched and left the batsman, beating his cut."
"floated up, the regulation offspinner this time, and Mushfiqur defends"
"swept, in the air but in the gap and over the fielders inside the circle on the leg side. There's a man out in the deep to keep them to one"
"very full, almost a yorker on his toes, and Kayes jabs a single down to short fine leg."
He starts with a slower bouncer that balloons up and past Kayes' pull
"<b>dropped!</b> Tiripano is livid. Kayes hasn't been nailing his pull strokes in the last half hour or so, and he pulls this in the air and to the right of Mavuta at midwicket. But he drops it, and they scamper through for two. Is the ball a little wet? The fielder pulls his cap down over his head in shame. It's hard work for bowlers on this wicket, and harder still if your fielders don't back you up"
"on a length, outside off, and he glides to gully"
"firmly punched off the back foot, and deep extra cover keeps them to one"
"Mushfiqur loses his balance flicking this into the leg side, running and then tumbling forward. But he recovers quickly enough to complete the run"
"whipped with plenty of bottom hand into the leg side, but it's cleanly stopped at midwicket."
"cool as you like, Mushfiqur skips out and sends the ball arcing cleanly over wide long on. He got right to it and followed through beautifully"
"Raza holds this one back, flighting the ball right up, and it grips and turns in to Mushfiqur as he cuts late to short third man"
short enough for Kayes to hang right back in his crease and thump a single out to deep extra
"very full on off stump, and he steps into a drive out into the deep"
"eased down to long on, and Bangladesh tick closer to a series win"
"floated up well wide of off, but Mushfiqur misses with his dab"
"speared down wide of off from around the stumps, and Kayes cuts very late down to third man. Chatara hares after it and times his dive well to flick the ball back into play and save a run"
"flat and fast from Williams, and Mushfiqur is struck on the thigh aiming a glance into the leg side."
"this one is held back a little, and the batsman is forward to thread a drive through the off side"
"pushed right up to Kayes, and he picks it off his toes for another single"
"much too short, sitting up off the track and asking to be hit. Mushfiqur rocks back to pull, but there's protection in the deep"
"gripping a little to turn in to Kayes, who stays deep in his crease and takes his score to 80 with another single into the leg side"
"Mavuta starts round the wicket, and pushes a top spinner through to have Kayes cutting to point"
"now he's back over the wicket, and Kayes steps back to defend a legbreak"
"this lands on middle and leg and turns, and Kayes is untroubled collecting a quick single into the leg side field"
"the wrong 'un, and Mushfiqur reads it a little late, but well enough to defend"
"a full toss, and it's dealt with accordingly. Mushfiqur bent low to meet the ball and hammered his sweep in the air over long leg. There's no fielder there, easy runs"
"pushed down the leg side, and Mavuta's troubles continue as he concedes an extra"
"this is a legbreak, but it's a little too short and Mushfiqur waits in the crease to punch a drive out to deep cover"
"pitching on off and spinning away, allowing Mushfiqur to slap a single through the covers"
"worked to the left of Mavuta at midwicket. He sprints and dives to stop it, and they decide against a chancy single"
"clubbed back at the bowler, who gets across the crease to cut it off"
"much too short, and Kayes latches on to it powerfully. He didn't bother to keep his leg-side heave down, and the ball bounces and skids past Moor in the deep to take Bangladesh's score past 200"
"nudged into the leg side, and with the field spread that's one more"
Mushfiqur stays very deep in the crease and places his backfoot punch into the gap at cover
"a wrong 'un comes out ... wrong, and it's slipping down the leg side before Mushfiqur jumps back to pull to short fine leg. Jarvis stops the boundary in that position, but not the run"
"Mavuta switches to around the wicket, and he's worked into the leg side by Kayes"
the singles continue to flow as the intensity of the game drops. Mushfiqur has acres of space to aim for on the off side
"looped down the leg side, and there's one more in the extras column"
"another wide? No, this one pitches on middle and leg and flicks the edge of the pad on the way down the leg side"
"a touch short, and it's pulled powerfully out into the deep."
"that's a better delivery. This looked like a slider of sorts, and it hurried on to Mushfiqur as he stepped back into his crease. He was looking for a leg side shot, but had to defend instead"
he starts with a full ball on off stump and Kayes defends.
"Jarvis tests Kayes with a short one, and he manages to control a leg-side hack for a single"
"a slower ball from Jarvis, and Mushfiqur reads it well enough to defend to cover"
"Mushfiqur dances down, but he telegraphed his move and Jarvis saw him coming. He drags his length back and also drops his pace, and the best Mushfiqur can do is run the ball to third man"
"as he has done all night, Jarvis continues to hit a length there and thereabouts, and Kayes taps to point"
"another short one, but this time it's met with a little less control and a little more violence by Kayes. But he still rolls his wrists on the shot to keep it down, and the ball rolls to the man at deep fine leg"
"Raza starts around the wicket, and he immediately finds a good line on middle and off"
"Kayes stays deep in his crease to slap the ball at the back foot, but it's straight to cover"
speared down the leg side
"Kayes holes out! Was this necessary? With just a few runs needed, and ten away from what could have been two consecutive hundreds, Kayes has given it away. Chigumbura was placed down at long off, but Kayes dances down and tries to beat him with a lofted drive, but he wasn't quite to the pitch and didn't get all of it. In fact, the ball was dying in front of Chigumbura and he had to get in quickly to catch it. Raza strikes again, but is it too little too late?"
Mithun is rooted to the crease as he has a look and pushes to cover
again the batsman stays very deep to work a ball that's just a little too short through extra cover
"in the air ... but short of the fielder in the deep! Mithun is wasting no time, and he was aiming for the second tier with this slog sweep. But he didn't get the timing he needed, and the ball hung in the night air for an age. But the fielder charging round from midwicket couldn't get there in time"
neatly punched through cover for one
"a short ball from Jarvis, and Mithun has a good old look at it as it fizzes past his left ear. No shot played"
"slower one from Jarvis, the cutter, and Mithun's backfoot punch is intercepted at cover. They've added extra protection in that region for Jarvis"
"smell that! Jarvis bent his back on this bouncer, and this time it drew a hook shot from Mithun, but he's late on it and the ball ricochets off bat, grille and body before hitting the ground"
"this is canny bowling. Jarvis floats down a slower ball, full and wide of off, and Mithun can't lay bat on it with a flat footed poke"
"another short one, but this time it's slower ... and also misdirected down the leg side"
"Mithun is back and across to push to cover, and that ends another fine over from Jarvis"
"a flat-batted drive is stopped at cover, no run to be had"
"ah, Mushfiqur's missed out on a full toss outside off here. He slashes at the ball but sends it straight to point"
"a much better delivery, and it's treated as such. Worked to leg"
"deft touch from Mushfiqur, as he sends the ball down to third man with a delicate late cut"
"Mushfiqur was looking to work this to leg, but the ball takes the inside edge into his pad"
"nudged down to third man, just the one"
deflects this down to third man for an easy single
squared up by the length but carefully defended nonetheless.
"picks the length early, swivels back and pulls in front of square towards deep midwicket"
"too short, sitting up nicely outside off and he slaps this between midwicket and mid-on. Easy pickings. Picked the bones out of that"
right behind the line as he defends this incoming length delivery
"grip from length just around middle and off, he gets on top of the bounce and defends. Bounced over the stumps!"
"tossed up and drifting in from around the stumps, defended back."
"eased down to long-on for a single, but hey, wait. He has over-stepped. Cardinal sin. <strong>Free-hit coming up</strong>"
right in his swinging arc but he slices this lofted hit to sweeper cover.
"too much flight, drills this straight to cover."
eases this with the angle towards midwicket
"short and angling in towards middle and leg, worked to deep midwicket"
clears his front leg and eases this with the spin to long-off.
steers this length delivery behind point for an easy single
"deflects this length delivery towards point, swift work by the man inside the ring by running to his left."
"this time, he plays the delicate little late cut towards third man who is square, so they jog back for the second. <strong>Mushfiqur ran right down the middle of the pitch</strong> but escaps the umpire's hawkeyes"
"slower length ball outside off, once again he opens the face of the bat to hit this very fine. Heavy dew so the ball just chugs along, the fielder can't stop despite a slide"
"eased behind point, looks for a single but is sent back"
stands tall and defends back.
drills the drive to cover.
"too short, he rocks back and slaps this into the wide long-on boundary. Within one more boundary of victory and a series win"
"skids one back in on a length, defended."
"steps out and works this down to mid-on, he was already three steps outside the crease so completed the run very easily even though mid-on was inside the ring"
nurdles this towards the man coming in from square leg
"skids back in from outside off, defended back"
"<strong>game, set, match and the series!</strong> This is a friendly long-hop, he rocks back to open up the leg side and muscles this short delivery to clear deep square."
