"nice start from Boult. Full and straight, not much swing though, pushed away to cover."
"on the pads on that occasion, drifting on the pads. There is some swing too. Worked away through backward square leg for a couple. Very neatly tucked away"
"yep, some swing! Boult usually gets swing. A good length delivery on middle and off, the ball moves back in, in the air and off the pitch. A thick inside edge saves Rahane."
"excellent lines. Not much Rahane can do. On a length, straight. Defended into the off side. Typical Boult, naggingly accurate."
"eeks, that's an ugly swing. Full and straight, moving back in. Rahane comes charging and hoicks the ball away through midwicket via the inside half. Pulled in just inside."
"inside edged, just past the stumps. Back of a length outside off, Short looks to punch into the off side, a thick inside edge just evades the stumps."
"a poor delivery. Short and wide, slides on, with plenty of width and Short says thanks mate with a cut through cover"
"Short is run-out again! That's ridiculous running. A complete breakdown in communication from Short and Rahane. AGAIN. Short is run-out for the second time in successive matches. He taps a length delivery to deep midwicket. Rahane completes one easily and comes back for two. Why? Because there are large dimensions in this ground. Short isn't sure, he hesitates and comes back but a direct hit and Short is at least five metres short."
nudged to deep midwicket
"flat on the pads, worked away to square leg. No turn at all"
"quick and straight, worked away to long-on for a run."
"clipped down to short fine leg. An iffy single, but Rahane makes it with a dive. A very tentative start from Rajasthan."
"beauty! Stokes has had to face deliveries like these right through the Auckland Test. Now, the white ball swings away and leaves Stokes' bat hanging"
"full and moving away outside off, Stokes is neatly behind the line this time to defend"
"Stokes comes charging and drills the drive through cover, wide of mid-off. Created enough room and let his powerful arms do the rest."
"nudged away towards midwicket, on a length and straight."
"back of a length around off, worked away to midwicket"
"well bowled. A wily change in length, going short on leg. Rahane is very late on his pull, the ball flies past his glove."
"full and straight, 132 kph. A thick inside edge into the pad as Stokes looks to clip that through midwicket"
"not quite timed, but finds a gap over backward point for a couple. Full outside off, Stokes came charging that time and skewed his drive away"
"excellent bowling, never a bad time for the yorker. Full outside off, jammed to mid-off"
"picks the length of that! Back of a length down leg, Stokes gets under the length of that and pulls over square leg for six. Plenty of timing and power behind that stroke"
"back of a length down leg, Stokes looks to pull but is beaten for pace, struck on the arm."
"a length delivery outside off, Rahane comes down again, looking to drive the ball over mid-off. No connection."
"edged and taken! 142.2 kph, it's a sensational delivery. A good length delivery, pitches outside off, the ball moved away just enough, not enough to beat the bat but to take the outside edge as Stokes is squared up. Gets a thick outside edge, flies away to Pant's left, and takes a really good catch."
"good length outside off, carved away to point from the crease."
"lovely placement. Full and wide outside off, 146 kph. Samson opens the bat face and carves his cut through backward point."
"six! Back of a length on middle and leg, some swing too. But there is no deep square leg so Samson can go from  bottom to top and pull. Enough elevation and timing, over square leg"
"good length delivery outside off, punched to the deep point fielder"
"it's through the fielder for four. A shortish delivery down leg, pulled away towards square leg, who takes his eyes off the ball and the ball spins around him like water around a rock. And then trickles away to the boundary, like a river."
"a poor delivery, strays on the pads does Morris. And worked away elegantly through midwicket for three. A lovely chase and stop by Nadeem, to save one."
"nicely played, back of a length outside off. Rahane opens his bat face and guides the ball to third man"
"good single. Full outside off, pushed away to mid-off and calls for a quick single. Makes the run easily"
"a slower ball outside off, tapped down to third man, 124 kph."
"a shortish slower ball on the pads, clipped down to short fine leg for one."
nicely flicked away to deep backward square leg for one. At least a run off every ball that over
"lovely shot. Shami goes short first up, on off. Rahane swivels easily and pulls into the gap behind square with so much ease. Great batting."
"back of a length outside off, chopped down to third man"
"on middle and leg, pushed to long-on"
"back of a length outside off, guided away to backward point"
"a slower ball around off, Rahane looks to turn that ball to square leg but fails to connect well. A thick inside edge into the pad."
"another pull, but he picks out deep square leg. Short on middle and off, heaved away for one. Tidy comeback."
"extremely full on middle, pushed to long-on."
"nicely bowled, flat down leg, pushed to midwicket. Maxwell dives to his left"
"slow down leg, nudged to fine leg for one."
"flatter trajectory, on middle. Punched away to long-on"
"slow down leg, Samson wants to turn that to square leg, finds his front pad instead."
"very flat down leg, clipped to deep midwicket. Four off that over, very tidy stuff."
"picks the length early of that, rocks back and pulls to deep midwicket. That's exceptional batting, the key was how quickly he read a scoring opportunity"
"that's very neatly played. Shortish and wide, carved away off the open face through the vacant slip region."
"slow on the pads, worked to deep midwicket"
"slow outside off, worked away to long-on"
"a slider, coming back in with some drift, pushed to long-on"
"short outside off, punched away into the gap at midwicket for a couple. Very easily done."
"flat and quick, on off, punched away towards point for a run."
drilled right back at the non-striker's stumps. Tewatia dives to his right. Samson dives back. Tewatia didn't get a hand on that.
"picks the gap and gets four. Tewatia drops short, Rahane rocks back and pulls that neatly into the gap at square leg for four. Lovely shot."
"flat and quick on middle and leg, worked to midwicket"
comes down and drives to long-off with the spin
"quick and straight, driven to long-on for one. Good comeback again."
"slow down leg, pushed to long-on for two. Very soft hands, and Rahane comes back"
"flat outside off, punched to long-off"
"nicely bowled, sees Rahane coming and so he slows the pace down and shortens the length. Pushed to long-off well, good improv"
"flat down leg, nudged to deep square leg for one"
"flat and wide, the ball slides in again. Punched to deep cover for one."
"bowled! A flat delivery, drifting back in, Samson stays low and looks to heave that sweep over midwicket. He gets a thick inside edge into his back leg, the ball then ricochets back and hits off stump. He was waiting for the right delivery which he could attack, but didn't quite execute with this one."
driven with the spin to long-off
gets right across and paddles the ball fine for a couple. Fast outfield but two as Shami gets across
"the reverse paddle. Tewatia goes short outside off, Buttler wanted to hit that, but because the length was shorter, he had to wait and force the ball through third man"
"short and wide, chopped away to cover for one."
"this is neat batting from Rahane too, full outside off, driven to long-off"
"flat and wide outside off, drilled away to cover. Nicely timed that."
"comes shimmying down and slices a hurried forehand past cover. Wanted to go over mid-off, but the ball hurried onto him so he had to slice the ball past the fielder's right. Mid-off was up"
"<b>Boult has taken some absolute stunners, almost another</b>. It's a good change in length, the bouncer outside off, pulled away over midwicket. Boult runs to his left, and sticks out a left hand, but the ball bursts out and goes away. He covered so much ground."
"full and wide, a yorker. Jammed to point"
"looking for one to third man, flat and wide, but the ball misses Rahane's open-faced dab"
"two fours, followed by three dots. A low full toss, looking to bunt that through midwicket but the ball slices to cover"
"a slower one outside off, pushed to long-on for one"
"shortens his length as he sees Rahane coming, nudged to deep midwicket"
"flat outside off, drifts back in, pushed to long-on for one."
"pops over extra cover for a couple. Flat outside off, the ball comes back in. Rahane reverse-paddles that, terrible timing but enough to clear the fielder."
"taken at point! A short, straight delivery, the ball turns away. Rahane looks to work that away over midwicket, but didn't account for that turn. Gets a thick leading edge which lobs to Morris at point."
"flat outside off, pushed to cover"
"shortish and quick outside off, punched to the sweeper cover"
"good length delivery on leg, nudged away to midwicket. Dot."
"a slower delivery outside off, an open-faced dab to deep point for one"
"a low full toss on middle, bunted away to mid-off. Rajasthan losing momentum"
"nice and full on middle, worked away towards midwicket"
"a naughty misfield from Gambhir. Full outside off, driven to cover, and the ball pops out. The pressure was building on Tripathi."
"an excellent yorker, ends with a straight yorker. Driven to long-on"
"Buttler premeditates a forward shimmy, comes down and the bowler shortens his length, nudged to midwicket"
"flat down leg, swept away neatly to deep backward square leg for a couple more."
"another one, too short from Tewatia, helped along wide of short fine leg for two"
"slides down leg, Tripathi plays another sweep, but finds short fine leg this time"
"92 kph, keeps it down leg, a top-edged sweep lobs over short fine leg for one."
"strays down leg, wide. He's not altered his line at all, all well down leg."
"overpitched on leg, driven away wide of long-on for a couple. A tidy end to a tidy spell."
"taken on the deep midwicket boundary, but tries to throw the ball back in as his momentum takes him over the boundary. His throw back in is futile because he has stepped over the boundary. A slower ball is smashed over deep midwicket"
"full and wide outside off, a thick outside edge down to third man for a run"
"gets under that and sends the ball very very high. Does not quite get the distance. Maxwell circles under the ball,  but he too can't haul the ball back in as he steps over the boundary at long-on"
"shortish outside off, Buttler misses his swing."
"short and wide, too much width. Cut over backward point for four. That's very clever batting. Nicely chopped away."
"142 kph, a full toss down leg, would you want it anywhere else? Buttler did not expect such a friendly delivery and reaches the ball very late. The ball hits the front pad, sliding down."
"gets underneath the length, gives himself room and knows exactly what he's doing. Lofted cleanly and easily over long-off, too easy."
"on the pads, skewed away to square leg"
"139 kph, strays down leg. Buttler misses a flick. Just clips the pad to the keeper."
"and out of a yorker! That's Buttler bread and erm...butter. But he misses this. Buttler walked right across, looking to scoop the ball over fine leg, but it's a slower ball on leg. And very very full. Despite his excellent hands, he can't quite improvise fast enough to that delivery. Misses and the ball hits leg stump."
a short loopy bouncer over the head.
"drifts down leg, flicked away through backward square leg for a couple."
"a diamond duck for Munro! A flat start from Gowtham on the pad, the ball ricochets towards square leg. Munro comes charging down, looking for the leg bye but Maxwell sends him back. Munro turns around and heads back, but the throw is on the bounce to the bowler, and Gowtham takes the bails off, with Munro well short."
"a low full toss, a yorker. Pushed to long-on. Not much Maxwell can do with that."
"smashed for four. Pant comes running down, gets close to the pitch and nails his drive over the bowler. Good-enough timing."
"a flat delivery, on middle and leg. Pant comes down but the trajectory is much flatter. Inside-edged into the pad, and then into the off side. Gowtham runs to the ball to prevent one."
"a flat delivery down leg, Pant stays low and heaves the ball over short fine leg for four. That's a poor delivery."
"a nice low full toss, driven to long-on, 108 kph. An easy 10 off the over."
"a slower ball on middle and leg, Pant stays low and aims to help it along over fine leg, but can't make contact. Struck on the body. One body bye."
"excellent bowling. Maxwell is backing away, Dhawal follows him with a very full delivery. Almost a yorker. The ball hits the back leg, one leg bye."
"a very wide delivery outside off, called a wide."
"full delivery outside off, it's absolutely belted to mid-off for no run. Smashed."
"excellent bowling again. The offcutter with the wet ball is a brave ball. To get some cut and flummox the batsman is even more impressive. Pant is too early into the shot, toe-ended to the keeper."
"oh my. That's right in the arc. A short offcutter on middle and leg. Maxwell attempts a ramp over short fine leg, but shuffles across and is through his shot too early. Goes over leg stump"
"terrific bowling. A full, straight delivery is hit away to mid-off for one. Excellent end to the Powerplay."
"a swing and miss! A very wide delivery outside off, Maxwell walks across, looking to heave into the leg side. The ball is too wide to drag. Wrong shot selection."
"3 off 7 for Maxwell. That was right in the slot. He has just gotten off an airplane. Full outside off, it's in the hitting arc and Maxwell misses his slog again."
"three wide deliveries, three dots! A full and wide delivery that is brilliantly bowled. Inside the tramline. Maxwell can't get bat on ball again."
"136 kph, it's full and wide again, may have been a wide had Maxwell left that alone. Maxwell swings, gives the ball everything he has. A thick outside edge flies over short third man."
"that is maaaasive! Wheee goes the ball over long-on. It's a 116 kph offcutter outside off, and by now it's predictable. Maxwell shuffles across, gets underneath the length and says not every ball, mate. Pummeled over long-on."
"134 kph, four more. Three dots and three boundaries. Very predictable again, full and wide, but inside the tramline. Maxwell slices over point for four. That was a good comeback from the batsman after losing his shape."
"a low full toss, a nice delivery. Drilled down to long-off, a misfield, rather understandable with these wet conditions. Two anyway easily made."
"Laughlin's trademark slower ball. The offcutter. Full delivery outside off, Pant throws everything he has at the ball. <strong>The ball goes reallllly hig</strong>h, long-on runs in towards the 30-yard circle but the ball pops out. Tripathi the fielder. Three fielders converging. Dropped!"
"an excellent yorker, on off. Jammed away to cover. Superb delivery by Laughlin, three very good balls, but five runs easily made."
"the slower one, 113 kph, the ball pitches and swerves away. Maxwell backs away and swings himself off his feet almost. Some floaty, swervy bowling, maybe the knuckle ball? A thick outside edge is easily taken by Buttler. This has been a terrific over from Laughlin."
"again, the slower floaty away-going delivery, beats Morris' drive. DOT!"
"<strong>that's a match-changing over</strong>. Just seven off it. A full, wide delivery outside off, sliced through backward point for two."
"a nice, slower delivery on middle and leg. Pant swings to deep midwicket, the ball goes very high but lobs in no-man's land."
"well played, four. Again, the wide yorker. Morris slices the ball through backward point for four. Third man is up, point is back, which is why he bowled that line."
"well executed from Rajasthan, good from Rahane and Unadkat. A low full toss very wide outside off if sliced away to that deep backward point fielder."
"116 kph. A slower delivery down leg, Pant pulls that, but gets the ball behind square for a boundary. Over fine leg. He's too early through the shot, but he won't care. Four."
"was that required? Gambhir ain't happy with the shot selection. A full delivery on the pads. Pant looks for a switch hit, because third man is up. But the ball goes past and hits Pant on the pad."
"that's very, very high and taken by Gowtham! A slower delivery is right in the slot, he would not want it anywhere else? It's on the pads too. Pant swings too early again and hits the ball in the air, backward square leg runs in and takes the catch, a very good, smart, hold-your-composure catch."
"a length delivery outside off is swung away to deep midwicket, it shapes away again."
"smashed on the helmet! This is a terrific delivery again. Doesn't bother with the slower ball, goes short and fast and accurate. Morris can't connect with a pull, the ball pings him on the helmet."
"full outside off, chipped away over cover. Wild cheers from the Rajastahn crowd because they've won this game without any extras in the next three balls."
"takes the catch! A slower ball on leg, Shankar bunts the ball away again to long-on. Stokes runs in and takes a simple catch to seal Delhi's fate. A match-changing 10 balls from Laughlin."
"full and wide outside off, smashed over cover for four. But doesn't do much to the crowd or Delhi's mood."
"a six to finish! Another swervy slower delivery outside off, Morris stands in his crease and smashes the ball over long-on for six. Rajasthan enjoy their hoemcoming too, <strong>beating the Delhi Daredevils by 10 runs</strong>"
