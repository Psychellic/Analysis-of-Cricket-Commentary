"<b> big appeal for lbw first up </b>, but umpire Tim Robinson is unmoved. Swing in the air. This one comes back in from outside off to hit Tamim on middle as he plays outside the line. Perhaps height was in question. Super start for Multan"
"looks to step out and swing this to neighbouring Abu Dhabi, beaten. Wild, wild swing towards cow corner this time. Pretty poor."
"right into the blockhole, dug out towards short midwicket. Tamim made to stretch a long way as he completes the run"

"length delivery slanting in towards leg stump, he's struck on the thigh pad as he tried to defend"
"slants one down leg, Tamim looks to whip this behind square. Good take by Sanga"
beauty! This one wobbled away just a bit to square him up. He was looking to defend but with minimal feet movement
the bounce troubles him this time. Short of length ball that jags back in sharply to hit him on the stomach. Tamim caught on the hop as he looks to work this behind square.
"ultra edge says nothing. Tamim survives and the review is successful. Tamim was in all sorts of trouble as he shaped to hook the short ball, got into a bit of a mess but the ball whizzed past quicker than he anticipated. <strong>Given out initially, but overturned</strong>. What's worse? It's called wide"
walks across and punches this length ball to cover point where there's a misfield
"beaten for pace, takes on the short ball and skies it straight to square leg. Kamran Akmal's stay is a short one. Was in no position to play the pull. Mohammad Irfan is Multan Sultan's first wicket-taker in PSL history. The guy who captain Malik didn't remember at the toss takes the catch."

turns this full delivery on middle and leg towards square leg
"squared him up with the length. Full on middle, this one nipped away late to roll off a thick outside edge to point"

"full on leg stump,  Smith looks to flick but is overbalanced and misses it as the ball strikes his pad"
"skiddy bouncer on middle, Smith sways away and watches this zip through to the keeper. <strong>That was way over his head</strong>, good call from the umpire"
"the good old french cut that sneaks past leg stump. On another day, the leg stump would've taken a walk. Smith pokes at this delivery outside the line, gets a massive inside edge. Lucky break"
shows the full face of the bat in defence
"walks across the stumps and whips this incoming length ball behind square to fine leg. Premeditated stroke, used the bowler's pace and bounce to good effect this time. One bounce into the ropes."
"steps out, takes it on the full and belts this through extra cover. In stepping out, he also moved across outside leg to make room. Lovely from Tamim."
"helped to fine leg where Junaid Khan has taken a stunner. Picked up the ball even as it may have been hovering around the ring of fire, ran in a couple of steps and dived full length forward to complete it. Tamim was beaten for pace this time even as he tried to repeat what he just did a couple of deliveries ago. Walked across to help it along but not to be this time."
"excellent delivery, excellent leave. Slants across a short of length ball just around off, Hafeez gets on top of the bounce but doesn't bother playing at that"
"steps out but in doing so, he nearly yorks himself. Ends up squeezing it towards cover"
"full and angling away from wide of the crease, left alone"
"what a welcome to the crease. Starts off with a juicy half-volley, Smith simply wallops this back over his head. Lovely punch, disdainfully done"
"mistimes this slog back to the bowler. Looked to drag this over mid-on but toe-ended this. Junaid threatens to throw this back to Smith, glares exchanged."

"disconcerting bounce, Hafeez is off balance as he dabs this off his toes to the off side"

"low full toss which he creams through cover, excellent work by Saif Badar, who runs across from the infield to cut that off"

starts with a slider that drifts in to beat the inside edge and hit the pad
"fired in again, Smith shows the full face of the bat in defence"
"long-on was in business briefly but he can only watch this sail over. Smith sees the flight and goes over the infield, ended up dragging it just a touch but got enough bat on it. First six of PSL 2018"
"gets his man this time and Tahir is on his lap of honour. Oh, wait. He's stopped because the batsman has reviewed. Smith is beaten by the googly as he pushes outside the line. Hit on middle. Smith checks with his partner and takes the review. Did he get an inside edge? Unlikely because he would've gone up immediately if that was the case. The only question is height. Given out on the field, and the umpire's call will be overturned as <b>ball tracking shows it would've gone over. </b> The ball flew off the pad, beat the keeper and raced to the boundary. There's confusion over whether that was a dead ball or should've been given four leg-byes. <b> Dead ball, we're informed. </b>"
"heaves this towards deep mdiwicket, off a thick inside edge, good fielding"
"pulled but not all that well, into the gap at deep midwicket though"
"floats this full delivery in from wide of the crease, Hafeez plays outside the line and gets a thick inside edge to square leg"

<b> dropped! </b> This was a tough chance on his followthrough. Hafeez was looking to go over the top but hit it high on the bat. Opportunity nonetheless
"pulled but not in control, just rolls past square leg"
clobbers this pull from outside off to the deep midwicket boundary. Pickes the bones out of that
looks to squeeze this behind point but missed. Bowler went full outside off this time

eased with the spin to extra cover
steers this to backward point
"fired full on off, eased back towards the bowler"
"flat hit but straight to Pollard, who has big, bucket hands at wide long-on. Nicely tossed up, Smith ends up hitting this full delivery across the line from way outside off when he may have been better off looking to hit straighter. Big wicket, big moment possibly."
"fired in at length on middle, turned to the leg side"
good length and in at off stump. Defended off the back foot
back of a length outside off and he can't get this dab off the outside edge past Pollard at slip. It bounces off the big man though
"back of a length on leg stump, clipped to deep square"
full and just outside off stump. Tapped back towards the bowler
short of a length and down leg side. Can't get bat on the attempted glance
"short ball on leg stump, swivels and plays a controlled pull to deep square"
<b>dropped.</b> Pollard grasses it low to his right at slip. This length ball jags in and cramps Hafeez who is trying to dab to third man again. It's an outside edge that's dying on Pollard who manages to get under it but can't hold on
<b>clears the straight boundary</b> after a delightful jump down the track to reach the pitch of this. It's a length ball on off stump and he gives himself enough room for a clean swing
"length on off stump, driven along the floor to long-off"
"length on off stump, driven to sweeper cover"
"full on leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
<b>is that dropped?</b> Yes it is. Thick edge sneaks through Sanga's attempt. Short ball outside off and once again he gets an edge after being cramped on the late cut
"back of a length on middle stump, gets low and carts this to deep square's left. The fielder puts in the sprint and the slide to push this back in"
"good length on off stump, driven on the up to mid-off"
"<b>slapped away.</b> No edging business here. Bang off the middle of the bat as he meets this length ball on the up, wide outside off. Sweeper has no chance to his right"

"short of a length outside off, dropped into the off side with soft hands"
"short of a length outside off, pushed to third man with the angle"
<b>chipped into the leg side</b> as he closes the face early on the glance. But it lands between the bowler and midwicket. Short of a length ball got too big on Haris
<b>sliced to the extra cover boundary</b> after stepping out. It's slanted across him on a good length and he doesn't get all of this. It's off the bottom part of the bat but it's placed well
"good length on middle stump, pushed back towards the bowler"
"back of a length on middle stump, swatted straight to deep square"
"nicely timed punch as he backs away, but he finds sweeper cover. Another short of a length ball from Junaid"

"cramps him with a length ball at off stump, he leaps and drops this pitch side on the off side"
back of a length and angled across of stump. Tapped to midwicket off the back foot
"<b>swipes and misses.</b> Backs away in anticipation of Viljoen's cramping line. He's predicted well, but there's too much pace for him as he looks to bludgeon this. It sails over the stumps"
<b>holes out to long-on.</b> Similar shot attempt as the last ball. Backs away and sets up for the pull. It has extra bounce this time and is still pacey. Slices a running catch for long-on
"short ball outside off, Hafeez wafts and misses. Or so it appears. It dips to Sangakarra's left and he takes it one-handed, in the nick of time. And he thinks there's an edge on that. The only one appealing. And they <b>take the review</b> for it after the umpire says no. The decision stands. Nowhere close to an edge"
"length on middle stump, flicked to deep square"
"full at off stump, driven through cover"

"back of a length on off stump, tapped into the covers from the crease"
"length on middle stump, punched to long-on off the back foot"
short ball slanted across off stump. He has premeditated a ramp over short fine. Looks awkward as he tries to contort to keep up his strategy. Beaten while he's at it
"slower ball, full and wide outside off. Reaches out with a long stride and manages to carve this wide of mid-off. <b>That's his fifty</b>"
short and just outside off. Hangs deep in the crease and lifts this square on the off side. Point and third man are in. Nicely done from Hafeez
"yorker on leg stump, can't get bat on the flick. Deflected into the covers"
"<b>top edge</b> and it clears the fine leg boundary. Tanvir bowls short yet again, despite having third man and fine leg in. Not that fine leg would've reached this. The hook flies off the top edge and it's really fine"
"<b>superb hit!</b> Tanvir misses the length on his yorker. It's overpitched on leg, he gets the front foot out of the way and lifts this over long-on with a check drive. Unreal stroke."
"full toss outside off, stands his ground and lifts this with control. Over the non-striker, wide of long-off. One bounce and four"
<b>pulled straight to square leg.</b> A change of pace and length. Dug in short on middle stump and he drags it straight into the mid-riff of the fielder there
"low full toss wide outside off, sliced to point's right and he manages to get down and stop that. Nearly squeezed that through"
"buh-bye! Full toss, knee height, outside off. That's good pace, that's good height, that's enough room. Sammy sends it flying over wide long-on"
overpitched wide outside off and he's creamed it flat to the extra cover boundary. Makes full use of his reach and gets to this despite having the front leg out of the way and in the leg side
"slower ball, short on off stump and he nearly gets another wicket at square leg. Sammy chips this and it falls short of the fielder there"
"full on off stump, drilled straight to extra cover"

"full on off stump, driven to long-off along the floor"
"<b>gets it wide of long-on.</b> Slower ball, dug in short and wide outside off. Sammy reaches out and spanks it on the rise. Poor from Tanvir"
<b>outside edge</b> straight to the keeper. It's a length ball with a lot of room. He looks to club across the line without too much feet and ends up too far from it. The perfect T20 innings from Sammy. It's over
"slower ball, back of a length on leg stump. Hangs back in the crease and looks to tickle this fine. Gets a glove on it and it's only a single"

super stop at point by Asghar. There was width and Shehzad struck this well. Sammy goes all the way from mid-off to high five his young colleague
"he's whipped this straight to deep fine leg. Shehzad wasn't in any control of the stroke. Was caught on the hop as he tried to work this behind square, the ball flew off the blade to the man in the deep."

"looks to force this through cover, can't pick the gap"
"steps out to go over the top, the bowler sees him charging and fires it in, eased to mid-on. There's a direct hit at the bowler's end, but Sanga was well in. Third umpire being called in lent some artificial excitement. <b> Pressure building on Maqsood </b>"
"connects, finally. This is too short, he makes room and punches this through cover. Lovely timing"
dabs this towards the man coming in from cover for a quick single
amazing how one shot has a boomerang effect. Maqsood swivels back and helps this short ball way over the fine leg boundary
"Smith has made a mess of it at deep square, but it was a tough chance alright. This was too short from Hammad, once again Maqsood is ready for the pull, hits it well too. Gets a move-on, finally."
"swing and a miss, this was much fuller and moving away from off stump."
"picks the length early as he muscles this pull on the bounce to deep midwicket. At 120kph, bowling short is a crime. Very poor from Hammad"

"looks to smack this too hard over cover, ends up getting the bottom part of the bat"
"that's the end of Maqsood show. He was trying to hit every single delivery, ends up slicing this to long-off. Stepped out to go straight over the bowler's head but didn't get underneath the flight, went through with the stroke only to find the big hands of Jordan."
