"fuller, and slightly wide again, and flat. He tries to cut it again and misses"

"slower, and a little short. Simmons shuffles to off, clips it gently to the deep midwicket area, and they hustle hard to get a couple"
"slider, pitching on off stump and sliding across the batsman. Simmons cuts it to the offside sweeper for a single"
"quicker ball, pitching on off stump and straightening. Pooran tries to squeeze it square on the offside again, but can't beat the point fielder"
"shortish, outside off, clubbed down the ground to long off for a single"
"back of a length and sliding across Pooran, and wow, he has been good with that cut shot today. Again, it's not very wide, but he gets a ridiculous amount of power into it, and hits it backward of point for a boundary. Wonderful timing"
"slower one, offcutter I think, pitching on leg and maybe turning a little. Just pushed towards cover for a single"
short of a length on off stump. Just played back down the pitch where Mathews scrambles across to prevent any thoughts of a single
"length just outside off. Simmons tries to heave it to leg, but doesn't connect very well, and it travels to long on for a single"
"slower one again, and Pooran tries to squirt it square again. Dasun Shanaka gets across quickly from backward point to prevent a single though"
"shorter one, googly to start. Simmons runs down the pitch but doesn't read it. It spins into his pad and dribbles off to leg. They take a leg bye"
"another googly. This is pitching on off and turning away. Pooran tries to club it cross-batted, and collects only fresh air."
"<strong>ho dang!</strong>. Another googly, and Hasaranga gets a wicket off his third ball. This is similar to the previous ball, pitched just outside off, sliding across the left hander and turning away. Pooran tries to launch this against the turn over deep midwicket, but it's turning too far, and he can't connect very well. Flies neatly into the hands of the fielder on the boundary, who has to run in a bit to compete the catch."
"googly again. That's four in a row. Pitching outside off this time, but Russ is expecting it. Comes forward and defends"
slider this time. No turn. Very quick at 99kph. Beats Russ and thuds into the keeper's gloves.
"legbreak this time I think, the first one he's bowled. Pitched on about off, but still quite flat and fast. Russ tries to slam it over leg, but mis-hits it and it travels off towards long on."
that's a bad start to the over. And it gets Russell going. This is a low full toss on middle stump. Russell gets low and wallops that - a slog sweep - over cow corner. Carries over the rope and lands about a metre outside the boundary. Pressure on Sandakan now.
"and another boundary. This could get ugly. This is pitched very wide of the stumps, straightening almost on that tram line. Russell gets low again, on that front knee, and launches it down the ground in the air for a boundary. No fielder can get close to that."
"pressure telling. This is a googly, pitching wide and turning away even wider."
"googly again, I think, but better line. This pitches on leg and turns to off. Russel just taps it back to the bowler."
this is as wide as wide can be. Pitches almost off the strip. Kusal Perera does well to get across and catch it.
"Russell is rocking now. Flatter, but full, and again he gets low, gets the slog sweep out, and that goes flying over deep square leg, into the grass banks at Pallekele. It wasn't even that great a connection, but such is the power of the man."
"flatter, faster, shorter, turning away from Russell, so it's the googly. Knocked towards deep cover for one."
"flat and fast again, but full. Simmons paddles it around the corner but can't beat Malinga at short fine leg."
"flat, but full, and Russell is powerful enough to get under that. He hits it in the air, wide of long on, and although Hasaranga wishes the fielder did better, he couldn't have really stopped that."
"shorter and faster, clubbed to deep midwicket"
worked to the square leg area
"this is a proper hail of sixes. Fullish and wide. Russell gets onto that front knee, frees the shoulders again, and suddenly the ball is zooming away down the ground, into the sightscreen. He's 29 off 11!"
"carved away to short third man, where Thisara Perera gets quickly to the ball and sends a throw in at the stumps. Russell wants a single and is sent back, and just about manages to get back in the crease before the direct hit disturbs the stumps."
"OHHHH. One more to finish the over. Again, Hasaranga goes a bit wide, and Russell is eating those up today. The powerful shoulders open up, and wallop that high and long down the ground. Goes over the sightscreen."
"Length on the pads, turned aroudn the corner to short fine leg. They scamper one to get Russ back on strike."
"dear sweet heavens. What a contest. Maybe the best T20 bowler ever, against the hottest T20 player on the planet. The maestro triumphs this time with a special delivery. It's the yorker, what else. Where the ones at the top of the innings were swinging away from the right hander, this tails in deliciously late. In between Russell's bat and pad. Into the base of off and middle stump. Vintage Malinga."
"an attempted yorker again, tailing in again, but the length is not quite there- it's slightly overpitched. Pollard digs it out to long off"
"yorker again, or almost a yorker at lest. A bit legside-ish though, and he flicks this away behind deep square leg for a couple"
"length outside off stump, cut away nicely by Simmons, but Shehan Jayasuriya makes a leap at backward point to stop it and keep it to one"
another swinging almost-yorker. Pollard digs it out to long on for one. Terrific over from Malinga.
Slider down legside. Wide
"googly, pitched outside off and turning in a little. It's flat fast and clubbed down to long on"
"slider pitching on about off, and sliding into middle. Turned to midwicket where Simmons finds some space and takes an easy two"
"another fast googly, and Simmons is down the track trying to launch this into the next galaxy, over midwicket. But he misses, it hits his pad and shoots off towards point. They take a legbye."
"flat fast, and a legbreak I think, but turned to midwicket from just outside off for a single"
"another fast slider, and Simmons goes back to try to squirt this square on the offside. Misses with his shot thoug"
"another fast googly. Simmons can only push this down the pitch, and Hasaranga gets across to make sure there's no run."
"swinging low full toss on the pads. Poor ball, and Pollard, in his 500th T20, puts that away behind square on the legside almost nonchalantly."
"Pollard's putting Malinga under serious pressure here. Slower ball, I think. Length wide of off stump. Pollard frees his shoulders and pumps that over cover for another boundary"
"this is a yorker, but that's fantastic running. Dug out to long on without a lot of power, which means that there's enough time for another two"
"Malinga's radar is off this over. This is straying into the pads again, another swinging yorker. Pollard helps its on its way by turning his wrists. No chance for short fine leg to stop that."
"inswinging yorker once more, but outside off stump. Thumped down the ground, quite straight. Long on has work to do so they scamper two."
"another yorker, just outside offstump. Again Pollard gets it down to long on, and again they run two, as the fielder has to run across too far. Super batting."
slider I think. Simmons gets in a tangle trying to launch this over leg and misses. It passes through his legs
clubbed to long on
"Pollard backs away, sees the slider, and bludgeons it over deep cover for a six. Clears the boundary by about a foot."
"Runs at the bowler, but Hasaranga sees it coming, and fires it in on his toes. Pollard can't do much but let it hit his pads."
"hit hard down the ground, but Shanaka gets across to cut it off. It was traveling."
"punched down the ground again for a single. They think about two, but decide against."
"this is way wide of off stump, and Kusal Perera can't collect the grubber. It dribbles off towards short third man and they take a single to make it two wides"
"<b>This is the best shot Pollard has hit</b>. Fullish outside off. Overpitched actually. But he's powerful enough to get under it and get some serious, serious distance on that shot. That's into the sightscreen. That also takes him past 10,000 T20 runs - the second batsman to the milestone after Chris Gayle"
"gets under this one a little too much though, and I think that's a slower one from Udana. He slams it high to long on, where Avishka Fernando comes in off the rope and gobbles it"
"fuller and wide, carved away to deep point for a single."
"slower one just wide of off stump. Walloped away, though not with a lot of power, down the ground. Long on has to run across so they take two happily."
"poor keeping that time. That was a low-ish full toss from Udana, which bounces into the grass behind the pitch, and Perera can't collect. It is deflected off his gloves to third man."
"full, wide yorker, drilled hard, but straight to cover. They can only take one, and fall four short of 200."
Avishka's one-day form is carrying into the T20s apparently. Does not care that this full delivery on off stump is the first of the innings. Swings it high over midwicket anyway. Sri Lanka are off.
"midwicket's gone out to the boundary now, and Avishka has found him with a pull, off a short of a length Cottrell ball into the body"
and why shouldn't Kusal Perera hit a four off his first ball as well. This is length-ish outside off stump. He takes a tiny shuffle forward and crashes this on the up through the covers for a four. Wonderful timing.
"should have done better with that one though. Shortish on leg stump. Perera tries to shovel this to fine leg, but misses and it hits him on the body."
"top edge, but safe. Short of a length outside off. He tries to pull again, and seriously mis-hits it. But it's far enough from the short fine leg to land safely."
fires this well down leg.
"sligntly overpitched, but close enough to be a yorker on the stumps. Clipped away square on the legside, and deep square leg rushes across to keep it to one."
"fullish on the stumps, and Avishka whips that away to deep midwicket for a single."
"length, wide of off stump. Kusal tries to flay that away through the offside, but doesn't get hold of it. They hustle one as it dribbles away toward cover."
"<strong>Gone</strong>. This is a bouncer at 140kph, which Avishka tries to clobber away through leg, but it's climbed more than he'd expected, and the it takes the top edge which flies to Pooran behind the stumps. The keeper palms it up on the first attempt, but snaffles it on the second."
"no doubts about that wide. Full, and well wide of the batsman's pads on the legside."
Mendis gets behind this one nicely. Length on off stump. Defended into the offside.
"<strong>he's out straightaway. </strong>Disappointing for Jayasuriya. He saw this short, wide ball, threw his bat at it, but didn't connect properly. It's a top edge and it flies almost directly to Cottrell on the third man boundary, where it is easily swallowed. Sri Lanka in a bit of grief early."
length ball on off stump. Defended into the offside.
back to the legside stuff. Too far down leg.
"<b>what a stunning over for Thomas.</b> It's the pace that's messing with Sri Lanka. This is short and legside-ish. Mendis tries to shovel this over his shoulder, but it's too fast, and he only gets an glove to the ball, and Pooran easily collects that one. Three wickets in five balls for Oshane."
"length on the pads. Defended into the legside, far enough from a fielder, and they scamper through"
short of a length outside off. Mathews opens the face and runs this down to third man.
"Kusal Perera isn't letting the wickets at the other end stop him. This is a bouncer into the shoulder, and Kusal is back and into the swivel-hook very quickly. This goes flat over the fine leg fence for six."
"short of a length this time, into the hips. Swivel-pulled with serious power again, to beat both short fine leg and the legside sweeper"
"slower one, length on the stumps. Pushed towards midwicket and they take one."
short ball on off stump. Mathews shovels that somehow through a vacant square leg for a single.
"Mathews has got inside the line of this one. This is back of a length on the stumps, but Mathews shuffles to the offside and tries to glance this to fine leg. He gets a thigh pad to it, and it skips off the fine leg boundary. Called runs by the umpire though."
"this is almost over leg stump, but because Mathews is moving to off, the umpire has called this a wide down leg. Bit harsh."
boom. That's a vintage Mathews shot. Length on off stump. He clears the front leg and slams this straight of a wide mid on for four.
this is definitely wide. Way down leg.
"fast and short again, and Mathews misses this time. I thought I heard a nick, but neither the umpire nor West Indies are interested. This is traveling around chest-high over the stumps. Mathews tries to club it but it flies through to the keeper"
"<b>nasty hit on the helmet.</b> This is into the shoulder, and Mathews is late on the shot, such is Oshane's pace. It hits his shoulder first and cannons into the side of the helmet. Mathews looks ok though."
"this is yet another bouncer. Head-high this time, and outside off stump. Mathews swings at it again, but doesn't get close to that one."
"<b>Russell with a teriffic running catch</b>. Oshane's pace is wreaking serious havoc. This is length on the stumps, and again, Mathews seems to be done in by the pace as he tries to launch this over midwicket. Mis-hits it seriously, and it flies into what seems like empty space in the outfield. Russell has somehow got across from long on and takes a wonderful sliding catch though."
Length outside off. Shanaka gets an outside edge to this one and the fine leg does well to keep it from the boundary
"short ball outside off, Shanaka leaves it alone"
wide-ish yorker. Shanaka tries to drill it through the offside but misses
fullish on leg. Shanaka tries to glance it but misses again. Flicks his pad on the way to the keeper
"fullish outside off, delivered from wide of the stumps. Just defended into the covers."
"short of a length angled into the body from Cottrell. Shanaka tries to bludgeon that away to leg, but finds midwicket with his mis-hit."
short and wide. Too wide.
"short of a length, angled across, and only slightly wide, but Kusal has pounced on that. Just a little shuffle forward and that's clubbed through cover-point for four"
"clears the front leg and tries to bash this fullish, wide delivery again, but he can't get hold of it. Just bounces away to cover."
"that's the best shot Kusal has hit today. This is short and slightly wide again, and that short-arm cut is brutal. He lifts this high over backward point, and incredibly, although he didn't seem to hit it so hard, carries over the boundary."
"short of a length ball, into the body. Fended away in the direction of pojnt and they can take one."
One more fired way down leg. That's Oshane's seventh wide.
"short ball, chest-high bouncer. Shanaka ducks underneath it."
"Thomas is winning this single-handedly. Again it's Oshane's pace that does it. Shanaka expects this full delivery to be going down leg, and shuffles across, trying to glance this to the fine leg boundary. But he's misjudged the line. He misses the shot, and it clips leg stump. Oshane has a five-wicket haul, and he's only bowled three overs. Wonderful stuff."
"length on the stumps,  shoveled towards deep midwicket where a misfield allows a third run"
and he becomes the third Sri Lanka batsman to hit a boundary off his first delivery. This is length outside off. Hasaranga opens the face and squeezes it between backward point and short third man for a four.
"fullish outside off, driven to long off"
"length ball, slightly wide, hit away to the offside sweeper"
"full and wide of off stump, carved away to third man for one"
fullish outside off. Driven just far enough to the left of cover to allow a single.
"Hasaranga's in good touch. This is short of a length, but not very wide. But this is square driven, almost, and timed so sublimely that it beats backward point and third man can't even dream of getting there"
"short of a length again, and tighter into the stumps. Just defended this time."
142kph bouncer. Hasaranga ducks under this one.
"length outside off, pushed past cover to the offside sweeper for a single"
"bouncer into the helmet, which is where it hits Kusal. It flies off to fine leg and they scamper one."
"bouncer again, which Shanaka ducks beneath"
"fullish, outside off stump, and Perera gets under that one, slicing it wth an open face, and gets it behind backward point for four. Didn't time it that well, but got enough on it."
"length on the pads, just knocked into the legside infield for a single"
"fullish, on off stump. Driven back to Pollard."
"yorker outside off, and Hasaranga opens the face of the  bat again and gets it between short third man and backward point. Not a lot of power in this though, so they chase it down to the boundary and haul it in just inside the rope"
"full ball, slower one I think. Again Hasaranga carves it past point, and the offisde sweeper runs across to cut it off"
"he's been prolific through that region. This is slightly short, and wide and Hasaranga is on the back foot squrting it powerfully enough through that short-third man and point gap again. This one has the legs to get to the rope."
"full toss, slightly wide. Slapped away through cover and the cover sweeper has to run across to cut it off."
"slower ball, almost a yorker, outside off. Perera tries to squirt it square on the off stump, but gets an under edge that dribbles behind the wicket. They scamper one."

"full toss outside off. smoked hard through the offside, but cover just gets a hand on it and stops it from screaming to the rope. Cleaned up by the offside sweeper."

"length around off, calmly steered to short third where the fielder does well to his right to keep them to a single"
