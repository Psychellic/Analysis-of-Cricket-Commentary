"length, 138kph and speared in to hit the pads as Roy moves into line, there's a half-hearted lbw appeal but it looks a touch high and leg side"
"got him, slashed to point - <b>Roy goes second ball!</b> Full and quite wide but there was swing for Hazlewood and Roy was reaching for a loose drive without having got his bearings, Smith snaffles the low catch and Australia have nipped out an early one again"
"pitched up in the channel, shaping away a touch as Hales shuffles into line and lets it go"
"length, 138kph on a fourth-fifth stump line, Hales shows it the maker's name in defence"
tapped into the off side coming across
"short and wide, Hales throws the bat and misses... not far off feathering through, from the looks of it, but the umpire decides Hazlewood should bowl that one again"

"tight stuff so far from Hazlewood, giving up nothing for free, steered towards point"
"Cummins trundles in, hits a good length and Hales defends"
"<b>bowled 'im!</b> Superb ball from Cummins and England are two down for spit! There's been some nip off this fresh surface and Cummins locates the perfect length, it jags back appreciably as Hales presses forwards, flicks the front pad before rattling the off pole"

"length, 142kph and rising up over off stump as Root shows it a straight bat"
"touch fuller, skidding on as Root hangs back but lines it up well to block"

"on the stumps, Bairstow watches it under his nose and defends"
"pitched up, <b>finds the outside edge</b> - another one goes! England are tottering like aunty on the gin... Hazlewood went wide on the crease and slid the ball in, enticing the drive but there was <i>just enough</i> seam movement to shift the line and kiss the edge of the bat.

"hammering a good length, Root continues to watch them on to the face of the bat"
"dug in, Root wafts at a pull, gets a big, ballooning top edge... <b>and Hazlewood pockets the catch at fine leg!</b> Root bags a duck and England are four down! Good pace and bounce, the bumper got too big for Root and he sent it right down the fielder's gullet. This could get <i>ugly</I>"

"zips off a length, grazes the outside edge! <b>ENGLAND ARE 8 FOR 5!!!</b> (Or 5 for 8, if you're that sort...) Brilliant ball from Hazlewood, not too much fault with the batsman here: perfect length, seaming a fraction as Buttler felt for it in defence, flicks the bat and Paine swallows another!"

"touch short of a length, left alone in the corridor"
"flying through, 141kph as Moeen stays back and shoulders arms"
"shout for lbw! Was there bat involved...? Australia decide not to review, Morgan was a little tucked up trying to drive. Hazlewood seems to indicate that he hit it, although replays suggest otherwise"
"skips down and attempts to hit Hazlewood off his length, comes off bat and thigh pad, loops short of the slips"

"length, shaping away a fraction in the channel as Morgan leans out and sniffs the sea breeze"

"length ball, touch leg side to start with and Moeen skims it to fine leg"
"full, outside off and driven, mistimed towards mid-off again"

"pitched up, 134kph and swerving in late, Morgan has to jam the bat down late again, outside-edged towards gully"

"plugging away around fourth stump, tapped into the off side"

"pushed across the lefty, Morgan steers one more through point"
