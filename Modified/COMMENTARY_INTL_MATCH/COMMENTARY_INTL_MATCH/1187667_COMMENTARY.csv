"slower ball on the pads, Parkinson fumbles it slightly at fine leg but recovers in time to avoid a second"
"quicker ball, slightly full of a length in the channel, blocked back to the bowler"
"bumper, but 129kph/80mph and not quick enough to trouble Guptill, who flings his bat at this like he's swatting a fly and fires it to the fence for four!"
"<b>great catch running back by Tom Curran!</B> Knuckleball from Brown, length outside off, Guptill looks to smash him over the top but doesn't get much on it... it skews up, and looks like it's running away from Curran, but he takes a sharp catch sprinting back from wide mid-off and Brown gets his Worcestershire team-mate!"

"length ball on fourth stump, shovels it to midwicket for a sharp single"
"good catch and <b>England have another!</b> Slower ball - offcutter from Curran, fullish on leg stump, but he doesn't pick it trying to hack it over square leg... outside edge skews up in the air and Saqib Mahmood snaffles the catch diving forward at third man"

"back of a length outside the off stump, pace off again and he can't get it away through the covers"
"<b>whacked</b> over deep backward square for the first six of the innings! Back-of-a-length slower ball, but too straight and too short and this is hammered onto the grass bank! Another expensive over for Mahmood"

"oh wow, <b>horrendous shot from Seifert</b> and Parkinson has a wicket in his first over! Reverse-slog-sweep from Seifert, a la Stokes at Headingley, but he gets nowhere near it and it somehow manages to nutmeg him and trim leg stump.

"ooft, <b>that's an unbelievable shot!</b> In-to-out over extra cover, a beautiful checked drive over the head of the man in the deep and that's an outrageous hit for six!"

"quicker ball, 132kph/82mph yorker outside the off stump and squeezed out to point"
"hard length from Gregory, de Grandhomme can only push it back at him"
"a touch straight, flicked off the pads out to midwicket. Gregory hares after it off his own bowling and stops the second"

"misses out on the free hit, sharp bumper... oh but it's harshly called a no-ball again on height! Turning into an expensive over"
"length ball on middle-and-leg, throws his hands through it and it flies away just over the rope at backward square leg for six more!"

"tries to hack this through midwicket, quicker ball and yorker-length and inside edges through his legs"

"<b>bing, toe-ended over midwicket into the wind</b> and <i>just about</i> escapes the grasp of the leaping Brown at deep midwicket! Nearly a spectacular effort, Brown tried to push it back to Tom Curran but couldn't quite get it back into the field of play"
miscued into the leg side for one
"<b>big appeal, and gone!</b> Length ball, fairly straight and Taylor doesn't get any bat on it and is struck on the back thigh pad. Mahmood goes up, and it's given. Neesham seemed to want him to review, but Taylor wasn't interested."

"full and fired down the leg side... slightly sloppy from England with the ball, as that's called wide again"
"<b>bowled 'im!</b> Little hint of reverse from Curran, shapes in from off stump, tails in and smashes into leg stump! Not quite a yorker, but a bit of nibble to deceive Neesham and New Zealand lose their sixth"
thumped out towards long-off but it's only a single
"nails his yorker, and Southee can only bunt it out to long-on"
"back-of-the-hand slower ball, nailed down the ground cross-batted and Vince's throw isn't quite right, meaning they get back for a couple"
"misses the yorker this time, low full toss and Santner <b>nails this down the ground</b> for four! Great shot from Santner, showing his power at the death"
"suffles across to the off side, flicks it off his pads straight to the man at deep midwicket and hits it so cleanly that there's no chance of getting back for two"

"slow, full and wide, a tasty offering for Malan, <b> who skelps a regal-looking drive through cover!</b> Drilled through the infield and away"
"clipped off the toes, bit of a push to come back for two... he actually slides and nearly takes out Tim Seifert in the process. But they're both back on their feet pretty quickly"

"short of a length, 134kph/83mph and Gregory swats across the line without making contact"
