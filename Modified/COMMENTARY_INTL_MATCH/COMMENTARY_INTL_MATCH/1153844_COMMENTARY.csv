"shortish down the leg side, poor line to start the match, and Tamim merely tucks it off his pads, fine enough for a four"
"much better line. Angles it away a bit, well outside off on length so left alone"
"short of length on middle stump, no room and Tamim helps it to midwicket"
"opens Tamim up a bit with an accurate line on off stump, he opens the face of the bat and runs it to third man"
"nice and accurate line outside off, Liton defends it watchfully"
"bit closer to the off stump now, Liton stays back and defends again"
"finds swing straightaway, lovely away movement but it's pretty wide and just inside the wide line. Left alone"
"such accuracy, and he strikes! Boult pitches that up on off stump, making Tamim drive but there's some outswing and he's edged it to the keeper. Tamim, though, was driving with a closed bat towards the leg side, instead of driving it straight down the ground. Boult did his job though with the length, the away movement and the edge"
right in the block hole now to welcome the new batsman. No margin for error whatsoever and Soumya digs it out of the ground
almost a replay of the Tamim wicket delivery and Soumya watchfully blocks it by getting behind the ball
that's short and Soumya does well to get on top of that and pull that away to the square-leg boundary. Not sure what Boult tried with the short ball but it was a bit too short and Soumya pulled it away with style
back to his outswingers outside off and the batsman lets it go but withdrawing his bat just in time
"on the pads, loud appeal from Henry, but it's angling in a fair bit after pitching on middle and would've probably missed. Liton tried to clip it away to leg but missed and was hit on the front pad in front of leg"
"teases him with an away-swinger outside off, he pokes and misses"
"bangs it in short, there's some nice shape too, and Liton stays back to defend it on his toes"
"angles it in towards the stumps again with a length delivery, Liton helps it to fine leg with a thick inside edge"
"length delivery on leg stump, Soumya defends it back with his head down"
bit too wide and what a beauty from Soumya. Stays back absolutely still and caresses that though the cover-point region with a back-foot punch by using the angle of the ball
"<b>loud, loud appeal for lbw</b> as he swings this one in, Liton hasn't moved his feet at all and is trapped on the back foot. But the ball is bouncing a fair bit and that probably saves Liton"
on the stumps from Boult and he defends it on the leg side
"creamed through the covers this time, four more! He needs only a bit of room, some outswing, and Soumya leans into that drive to send it rolling along the ground in the gap in the covers"
back towards the stumps again and Soumya defends it back
"headed right towards off and middle, Soumya stays back and blocks it off the middle"
"full on off, hint of outswing, and Soumya flicks it to mid-on by just checking his shot"
"that's gone right through Liton! No footwork whatsoever from him as the ball nips in from length outside off, he leaves a wide gap between bat and ball, not accounting for the line and the movement, and the ball goes on to clip top of off stump. He was looking out of place against Henry in the previous over and the bowler cashed in on that"
"accurate line on the off stump, length delivery, and he defends carefully"
"slightly wide outside off, het shoulders arms this time"
"makes him play this time with an off-stump line, nice bounce and Mushfiqur defends with a straight bat"
"from slightly wide of the crease to bring the ball in with the angle, Mushfiqur watches that and blocks again"
"more towards the leg stump now with the angle, he defends towards midwicket now"
"nice shape and swing just around off stump, pretty full, he pushes it into the covers"
"towards the pads now, Soumya needs only a small error from the bowler and he clips that away nicely in the air through the vacant midwicket region for a four"
"short ball, he hooks, gets a top edge, shouts of 'catch it' but it's gone slightly fine to beat long leg and gets four more"
eases into that drive nicely to send it in the cover region for two in the gap. Bit too full and nicely done by Soumya
"angling in a bit this time into Soumya, he tucks it to midwicket"
"loud, loud appeal for lbw, umpire S Ravi won't move at all, there were two noises probably and <strong>NZ review that</strong> after Williamson walks in from cover. The length delivery is swinging in, he looked to clip it to leg and got an <b>inside edge</b> just before the ball hit the pads. New Zealand lose their review"
"angling in towards the pads from length, clipped straight to midwicket"
"pretty short and wide, Mushfiqur gets room and cuts but only bottom-edges it towards third man"
"what a shot for six! That looked like a normal short ball towards Soumya but he saw the length so early, and smacked that to the square leg boundary, hitting a six out of nowhere! Almost breathtaking"
"back towards the stumps, no use bowling short to him, and it's pushed into the covers for one"
"off stump line from Henry, no room at all, and he blocks it back"
"gives him the charge by dancing down the track, Mushfiqur is not going to get dominated, makes room too and he smashes that down the ground, straight enough to beat mid-off"
"little bit of away swing outside off, Soumya pushes it away from his body and gets an inside edge to fine leg"
"Mushfiqur has been <strong>hit on the helmet</strong>, but he looks fine. That was a nasty short ball on the leg side, Mushfiqur went on his toes and took his eyes off the ball with his hands in front of his face, and the ball bounced enough to bounce off the helmet to reach Guptill at square leg"
oh another bouncer! This one around middle and off and Mushfiqur lets it go easily
"nicely pitched just outside off, bit of angle, tempting line to poke but Mushfiqur resists the temptation and leaves it"
"length delivery on off, Mushfiqur watches carefully and defends by leaning into that delivery"
"oh, he's chopped it on! Mushfiqur was doing well in that over after taking a blow on the helmet. He was judging the lines well, leaving and defending them. This delivery nips in just a bit after pitching outside off, Mushfiqur goes for the cut and the movement takes his inside edge to rattle off stump"
"length delivery around off, driven straight to cover off the front foot"
"Soumya has been bounced out here and Bangladesh lose the biggest wicket of the day. Henry banged it in short, Soumya went for the hook and got a top edge that went high enough for Henry to run towards the short leg region to get under it just in time"
"targets the off stump from wide of the crease, on length, Mahmudullah gets an inside edge to fine leg. He's off the mark"
"takes it away from his first ball, that teasing line outside off, he goes for the drive and misses it completely"
"pushes this one into the covers again, but it nips in a bit and takes an inside edge to the leg side"
uses soft hands to guide that length delivery towards third man
"starts with a leg-stump line on the pads, doesn't bounce much and he helps it to leg"
"bangs it in, another bouncer from Boult, and he ducks under it"
pushes that full delivery down the ground towards mid-off and takes off for the single immediately to make it in time
"tempting line outside off to have a go, 141kmh, good angle too but he lets it go"
"<b>stifled appeal</b> for lbw as he swings this one in, Mithun is falling over while trying to clip it. It pitched on leg, maybe just outside, and was going down further to not move S Ravi again"
"tries a similar delivery but it's too full this time, a low full toss, and Mithun gets enough bat to clip it fine for four. Bangladesh need those runs"
just outside off and he defends it away towards point
"uses soft hands this time for the length delivery outside off, gets a thick edge to third man"
"outside off again, he watches carefully and defends"
little too wide this time and het lets it go
"back towards the stumps from length, no room at all, and he defends it back"
"back of length around off stump, he stays back and defends it towards point"
"too wide outside off, he reaches out for it away from his body and drives it square. Point gets a hand to it with a dive and they take two"
"better line closer to off stump, almost makes Mahmudullah play that one. He pokes and misses"
"a bouncer this time on the leg side, he ducks under it easily"
"too wide again outside off, Boult losing his line a bit, and it's left alone again"
"the short ball has done it, looks like an edge because of the sound but Mahmudullah has <strong>reviewed straightaway</strong>. Boult banged it in short, it opened the batsman up who held his bat in front of the shoulders. Snicko and replays show there was nothing off the bat, it was the right shoulder instead. DRS to the rescue"
"beats the outside edge again with that teasing line, away movement and accuracy. He pokes and misses"
"shapes it away nicely but well outside off, left alone"
"nipping it in this time towards off stump, he pushes it back"
"some away swing again well outside off, Mithun throws his hands at it but finds mid-off"
"well outside off, Mithun waits and then sticks his bat out to help it to third man"
"121kmh, pretty innocuous outside off, pushed down to mid off again"

"from well wide of the crease and angling in sharply towards middle and leg, Mithun brings his bat down just in time to defend"
"similar release point but it's outside off now, he leans forward a bit and pushes it on off"
"short ball this time outside off, Mithun hangs back and keeps the ball down for a single to third man"
"pushes at the short of length ball away from his body outside off, inside edge beats leg gully for one"

"beats the outside edge! That was 150kmh, that was on length, that was something he wanted to defend but could not, Mithun"
"length delivery on middle, he defends it back"

bouncer dug in too short and climbs over his helmet
"<b>taken, second attempt!</b> Taylor reacts quicker to that than the batsman, but he has catching up to do as well. 150kph again from Ferguson. It's short and in the corridor, slanting in at the batsman. It's there for the cut, and that's what Mahmudullah looks to do. But this is just too quick for him and he gets the outside edge. Taylor lunges to his right and pops it up before keeping his head and grabbing it as it lobs behind him at first slip"

"<b>stumping appeal</b> down leg side as Sabbir slips attempting a sweep. Lost his footing...<b>and he is short as he looks to get the back bat in.</b> That's unfortunate. It's a length ball down leg. His front heel slips on the surface as he chases this. He's in a tangle with both feet out of the crease and his body on the floor. Panic as he looks to sweep the bat along the ground and into the crease. Latham's taken some time with that stumping, but there's enough going against Sabbir for him to be marginally short"
"full on off stump, driven to extra cover"
"<b>lifts it over mid-on.</b> Safe, in theory. Length ball at off stump. Steps out and hits it on the up, against the turn"

"<b>Santner wins the battle!</b> They're both intelligent cricketers, Santner and Mehidy. Mehidy's footwork was top-class so far and he was maneuvering Santner all over and picking him off. Almost as a pattern, all of Santner's sixth balls were quicker, but this time he hangs it up wide outside off on a length. Mehidy wants to sweep to the backward square boundary after shuffling, but his top-edge is easy for short fine to get to with a jog to the left. Neesham there"
