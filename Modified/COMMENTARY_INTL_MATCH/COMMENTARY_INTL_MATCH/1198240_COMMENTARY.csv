"<strong>he's gone first ball!</strong> Glorious start for Australia! Drives one on the up, it was perhaps a little too short to be a half-volley, but Roy didn't shy away from flashing, and it goes straight to backward point. Phenomenal start for Australia"
"<strong>big appeal, and he's gone too</strong>! Starc is on a hat-trick! Swinging in to the batsman and Root misses the drive. It looked like it was smashing into leg stump, and no, he won't be reviewing it!"
"went for the magic delivery, looking for the one that swings away. Ends up tailing down leg stump, and he gets pad on to it"
"opens his shoulders and gives himself room. The timing was perfect, as was the placement through cover-point. First runs of the day"
fourth stump line and Morgan opts to shoulder arms
good length that looked like it was rearing slightly. That concludes a <strong>tremendous first over</strong> for Australia
"inside edge onto the pad, Hazlewood bang on the money from the start"
perfect probing line and decent bounce off the pitch. He lets it go
tailing into the stumps. Driven crisply to mid-off
"short of a length. Bairstow rocks back and pulls it, but no real timing and it goes straight to short midwicket"
"first real poor delivery. Half-volley, sat up to be put away, and he was onto it in a flash"
"dragged it down leg side, and it needed sharp work from Carey to ensure it didn't trickle away for four leg byes"
strays too far wide to start
"on the money, pitches it up, and Morgan can only drive it back to him. The open stance of the England skipper suggests he's still looking to be positive"
"as I say that, he brings out the most classical forward defensive shot to a delivery that was otherwise heading for middle stump"
"didn't get his feet sorted to that one. It was back of a length, and he looked to push it through the offside, but ends up getting beaten"
"shorter once more, and he looked a little uncomfortable fending it off"
"once more, he needed to ensure it didn't balloon off his bat. The right hand came off it but he manages to keep it down"
"beats the outside edge. At the moment, Starc's on top in this little mini-battle, and it's not that close. Another probing over that cost just the extra comes to an end"
a straighter line aiming for top of off. Cautiously defended to the offside
"crunched past backward point. Bairstow takes advantage of the shorter ball and cuts it away, and the bounce beats the man stationed in the circle"
"gets a genuine outside edge on that, but it bounces well in front of the slip cordon"
pushes him back with one that's slightly short of a length. Poked into the offside
"banged in short and Bairstow ducks under. Doesn't seem chuffed by the umpire deciding that's not a wide, which Bairstow wanted on height, apparently"
prodded into the offside to end the over
wayward to begin. Dragged well down legside
"half-volley and while Morgan didn't quite time this as well as he wanted, it nearly races away to the short boundary. Sharp work from Pat Cummins keeps it to three"
pitched on a length and his drive isn't quite middled
"full toss at 89mph. Baitstow might have been disappointed not to put that away. At that pace and with the angle, though, even the full tosses look like they could be tricky"
"confidently chipped over midwicket. That was brilliant, picked up the line early and was onto it in an instant. It races away to the short boundary"
"knew little about that. It was a short ball that Bairstow anted no part of but as he swivelled trying to pull out of the shot, he gets a fortuitous edge that takes it sailing above the keeper"
"driven back to Starc. Decent over, that, for England, 12 off it"
dances down the wicket and makes room for himself to carve the infield on the offside. Races to the cover boundary
pitched outside leg stump and hits the pads. They ponder a run that's never really on
"there was a hint of inswing, and he was right to be wary as he blocks that into the onside"
"short ball at 85mph. It seemed like Morgan had a touch too much time, and was almost set up for the hook shot. Nicely middled and Zampa had little chance of cutting that off at fine leg. England ticking along smartly now"
angled down to third man
jabbed into the onside and they manage to run three on what is a very long boundary. Anotehr expensive over
"defended to short cover. <strong>This, by the way, is England's highest Powerplay total already this series</strong>"
exquisitely picked up and dispatched to cow corner. Made Cummins look a medium pacer with the audacity of that shot. Just fractionally short and he jumped on it immediately
"struck on the pads, but too high for the fielders to be legitimately excited"
"flicked away through cover, and England continue to recover nicely from that disastrous first over. Little wrong with the delivery other than that it was perhaps a tad wide of off stump, but Bairstow punished it."
defended back to the bowler. Decent comeback
"a bit of a slog sweep that he lost control of. Got a faint inside edge but it bounced before reaching Carey, who was sharp enough to ensure it didn't trickle away for any"
opens the face and runs it down to third man
clipped through legside. Poor running and sharp work by Cummins keeps that to just one
prodded into the onside
"pitching outside leg stump and angling in, squeezed down to short fine leg, and England bring up the 50, as well as the 50 partnership!"
a leave! Seems like it's been awhile since we had one of those
finishes poorly. Dragged down leg side and tickled down past short fine for a boundary
Cummins strays slightly wide down legside
same line but this time Morgan gets a faint tickle on to it and runs it down for another boundary. This is a little too easy for England right now
angling away. Morgan opened himself up but realised it was too close to cut through the offside
"similar line, and Morgan gets a thick inside edge. Better last couple of deliveries"
"again, gives him no room while ensuring he doesn't stray down leg side. It's a very delicate balancing act, but Cummins needs to nail it constantly"
been a pretty good comeback this over. Cramps Morgan up once more
excellent end to it. Poked away to the onside. Just 5 off it
"an attempt at a swivel-pull, but when you don't make contact, it looks like an ungainly pirouette"
<strong>squeezed through </strong>the two men behind square on the offside in the circle. A dive from short third gets a hand on it but can't prevent it racing down to the boundary
banged it in short and he gets out of the way
"tucked away to square leg and they come back for a couple. Hazlewood continues to leak runs, and that's not something we say often"
makes room and Hazlewood follows him. He manages a single down to fine leg Smart bowling
"whacked through the onside and he keeps the strike. It's ended up being England's Powerplay, arguably, and that's quite the comeback after the first two balls"
"starts with a flighted one outside off, driven back"
"<strong>and he gets the breakthrough! </strong>Morgan looks pretty unimpressed with himself, and so he should. He struck it well, but attempting that short with Starc stationed at mid-off was much too risky"
worked through cover and he gets off the mark
nicely flighted and Bairstow was a little careful in how he approached it. Might not have been that wary had he still got Morgan at the other end
drives nicely but straight to extra cover
driven down the ground and he keeps the strike. Best over for Australia in ages
"suddenly, Cummins looks more dangerous. Cross seamed ball that moves ever so slightly away and nearly nabs the edge"
kept a shade low. Bottom edge through to the keeper on the bounce
driven through the cover region
short ball that Bairstow gets out of the way of
angles it down to third man
defended. Just three runs off the two post-Powerplay overs
nice shape and drift from Zampa. Sliced away for a single
"leg stump line, Buttler blocks"
plants the front foot early to block. Looks like he'll treat Zampa with respect for now
"carbon copy. Decent little period, this, for Australia"
was there an edge? Perhaps not. Buttler lunged at that with a bit of belligerence but was beaten completely
"defended. Another excellent over for Australia, just the one of"
"pushes him back with one slightly short of a length, defended"
took his eyes off that but manages to pull that down to midwicket
defended to mid-on
banged in short and Bairstow gets under it. Perhaps a tad fortunate not to be called wide given it was tailing down slightly
"good length, wicket-to-wicket line. Dropped it down to mid-on and they scamper through for a single. England have to find a way to keep the runs ticking along"
"that one will finally be called. Another short ball and this one was straying a bit too far down leg for the umpire to overlook. Shane Warne, though, has lost his rag on commentary talking about it"
"worked own to midwicket, and they're not crazy enough to take on Stoinis' arm"
"gives it a bit of air, driven down to long-off"
gets a big stride out but can only defend it to the offside
"low full toss, that was the opportunity for a put-away. He timed it well, but straight to the one man stationed in the inner circle"
"thick outside edge and it was uppish, with short third interested for a little while. It lands well wide though and they come back for a couple"
"fuller from Zampa, and it's driven down for a single"
nudged into the onside
"length delivery gunning for the top of middle, worked down to mid-on"
targeting the stumps. Defended back to Cummins. Buttler hasn't really got going just yet
"opens the face and carves it through the cover region. They curry through for one, and even Warner's direct hit isn't enough to threaten a fairly routine single"
clipped off the front foot to short midwicket. England are finding the fielders a little more frequently now
an 88mph short ball that Bairstow tried to pull through midwicket. Didn't quite get it there but a thick inside edge squeezes it down fine and <strong>that brings up the half-century </strong>

"ripped through at a fair lick, dipping on off stump and clipped to midwicket"
"firmly pushed into the covers once more. Five from the over, which is perfectly adequate at this stage"
"flipped off the toes to the leg side, just a touch too straight from Marsh this time"
"rising from a full length, tight line on middle and leg. Blocked with hard hands"
"pops a touch from back of a length, short midwicket is in business for a split second.."
"nurdled to the on-side, can't create the angle as Marsh finds a touch of outswing from a full length"
"banged in short, Bairstow ducks as the ball zips over his shoulder"
"<B>climbs into a pull, and I reckon he's faced that to fine leg!</B> Yep, through the shot too soon, and wears it on the teeth, like a really badly timed leap for a header to the near corner. The grille does the needful though. On we go"
"lots of air, and <B>Buttler's holed out cheaply again!</B> Massive wicket, Buttler tries once more to go inside out through extra cover, and Finch is right in situ to scoop him up in the covers! Reward for probing bowling, and good thinking, inviting the skimmed drive, and getting the reward!"
"tossed up first ball, and stoutly blocked"
"pressed with a full face down the ground to mid-on, and Billings is up and running"
"head right over the ball, blocking for all he's worth"
"whipped from outside off stump, and gathered at midwicket"
"skidding on faster and flatter, and <B>Zampa is very excited!</B> It seemed as though Bairstow got bat on that, but he was beaten by the change-up, did it flick pad first? If so, it's tight. Australia <B>review</B>. Nope, lots of bat. On we go"
"outswinger on a full length, Billings watches it onto a forward defensive"
"<B>jaffer!</B> That's a lovely piece of bowling, late jagging outswing, curling past the edge on a perfect length. You do well to nick those..."
"poked with very hard hands, back down the line of the ball. Solid"
"round the wicket now, curling on a full length, back into the right-hander, firm in defence"
"back of a length, a slower and shorter cutter, banged into the middle of the pitch, and a languid pull to the man behind square"
"back over the wicket to Billings, <strong>who chops wristily past backward point!</strong> That's firmly played and well placed, to keep the scoreboard ticking. The hundred is up"
"nudged off the pads behind square, finds the gap well"
"Bairstow shuffles to the pitch, and finally takes on that alluring short boundary, waiting on the stroke and flicking calculatedly through the gap at midwicket. Solid"
"tapped off the toes, a touch quicker through the air"
"lots of air, Billings advances but yorks himself in the process. Tapped to mid-on"
"better use of the feet this time, shuffling to the pitch and he's halfway through the quick single as Marsh gathers at mid-on"
"right up to the toes, nudged to leg, another gap picked as England find some momentum against Zampa at last"
"leg-stump line, clipped square. A huge leg-side boundary for Maxwell"
"tossed up, outside leg this time, tapped with the angle back to the bowler"
"advancing to the pitch once again, flicked uppishly off the toes, out to the leg side"
"Bairstow shimmies at the crease, threatening to advance, but instead rocking back and stealing a single off the pads"
"lively footwork, blocked with a tangle of limbs on middle and off"
rising on the back foot to defend to the leg side. Tidy over
"tight line, just back of a length, flicked with an open face down to a fine third man"

"bashed with intent into the covers as Bairstow rises into a drive, but can't pierce the field"
"rare width from Starc, and <B>Bairstow is in the mood to punish it!</B> Rolling the wrists on a thumping drive in front of extra cover"

"much fuller length, wide line outside off, a big swing and a miss"
"cutter, tight line, nibbling back into the right-hander, who works with the angle to defend off the legs"

"tucked off the pads, can't find the gap"
"fenced to the on side, head over the ball. Maxwell twirls through another tidy over"
"crashes into the pads, but too straight and too high on first impressions. No reviews left either way..."
"<strong>another big appeal!</strong> More going for this shout as Cummins finds late movement into the pads on a full length, but doing too much. And an inside-edge too"
"blotted off the front foot, into the covers, a loud shout of 'no!'"
"full and straight, very solid block back to the bowler"
"misdirected this time, but fine leg is well placed to mop up a flick off the pads"
"short-arm pull, not quite short enough for the stroke as Bairstow under-edges to the leg side. That's a good comeback over"
"tossed up on leg stump, as per..."
<B>reverse swept through the covers!</B> Panned in front of square. Hell of a stroke...
"another appeal, again leg-sided as Billings works the ball behind square"
"a very delicate sweep off the legs, very very fine past the keeper"
"fired in flatter, outside leg, and Bairstow misses his pull as Carey wears the ball on his shoulder to gather it. Turn and bounce..."
"another sweep, brings up the fifty stand"
a bit of turn and bounce again as Bairstow wears this on the thigh pad. England just beginning to up the ante against his all-sorts...
"walks across the stumps, whips with the angle behind square"
cracked behind square as Bairstow attempts a cut but is just cramped a touch by the line and the bounce
<B>careful now!</B> Signs of reverse as Billings makes room for the late cut and so nearly drags on in his haste to readjust
"an eager cut, climbing into some rare width but can't pierce the field"
"a whistling air-shot, as Billings lines up something expansive over midwicket, and nearly loses his off stump in the process"
forward and blocked into the on-side
"back of a length, very tight line, Billings waits on the back foot and taps the single to backward point. Good ball, but robbed by some slow reactions in the field"
"drawn onto the front foot, solid push back down the wicket"
"whittled off the toes, out to midwicket. Marsh keeping it admirably tight so far"
"leg-sided, England settle for another nurdle off the hip"
"looks for the big wind-up, but settles for the front-footed block into the covers"

"open-faced steer to third man, can't pick the gap"
"good finish to the over, cutting back into the pads, and cramped outside off stump"
worked away to midwicket
"a little hop down the wicket, but he ended up dropping it dead on the offside and scampering for one. A bit of football from Marsh as he tries to effect a run out"
"runs down the track and has an almighty thwack at it. Doesn't hit the ball, but fresh air gets a wallop"
"this one's jabbed down to cow corner, lots of bottom hand in it. Stoinis does well to keep it to two with the dive"
strays down legside with a short ball
poked into the onside
"slower bouncer, and this one's well targeted. Billings lets it go"
sliced away down to Adam Zampa at third man
driven crisply down to mid-on. Billings looks good when he middles it even when it doesn't fetch any
"well, he connected nicely with that one, and nearly paid for it with his wicket. Straight back at him, but those need to stick. In this case, it popped out of that left hand"
"<strong>brilliant fielding from Cummins at square, that's excellent from him again</strong>. It was clubbed with some force, and Cummins got out the dive to cut off the boundary"
"well, no one's stopping that. It was in the slot, poor delivery, in truth. Billings rocked back and gave it a thump, and this time gets it perfectly right. Sails away past cow corner and into the car park. They might  need a new ball here."
"pulled at a short ball, and the keeper went up as if he'd got a tickle on it. No reaction from Starc, though"
languid push down to long-on
"<strong>that's a no-ball. Finn's law applies! </strong>He's knocked the bail over, and they've got a run down to third man"
clears the front leg and slaps it down to square leg as they pick up a couple
"went slightly shorter this time, angled to short midwicket"
nurdled down to fine leg
slower delivery to finish off. It's clumped down to the cow corner boundary
"driven back to the bowler, which sends the non-striker scrambling to get back into his crease"
"inside edge, and what should have been a cover drive becomes a squeeze down to fine leg"
"that's impressive hand-eye coordination, what a shot. Got down and across and laps it over fine leg. It <strong>carries all the way for six</strong>"
"slight change of action from Starc and its jabbed into the onside, only to find the fielder"
slower ball and it balloons into the air on the offside through a vacant cover region. The pace of the ball deceived him completely but he gets away with it
yorker length and he just about digs it out. Finch has a shy at the stumps and whacks Starc in the leg instead
"low full toss, driven down to mid-off"
dances down the wicket and slaps it through the wide mid-on region. Looked like Warner might have been in business but he can't quite get to it
"hops down the crease once more, only to be forced to poke it to the offside"
"a touch short, and he pulls it away to midwicket, and <strong>that's his 50</strong>! Lovely innings in what could be a match-winning partnership"
this one's overpitched and he's smacked that through the empty cow corner region. Zampa's been put under pressure straightaway. Let's see what the leggie has up his sleeve
"bowls a little slower and gives it air. Rewarded with grip off the pitch and it scooped up in the air, only to fall short of any offside fielder"
"driven down to mid-on, and that <strong>brings up the 100-partnership</strong>. It's come in 112 balls, and from 95 for 4, it was desperately required. Kept England well in the game"
driven to the offside
opens the face and carves it down to deep point as he moves to 95
took the pace off that one and Billings squeezes it down to fine leg
"that was a bit too close to cut, as Bairstow nearly found out to his cost when he nearly chopped it on to his stumps"
"<strong>that's an unbelievable shot, even more so given it brings up his hundred</strong>. Just a short-arm jab to a ball at 89 mph. So casual, and yet it clears the square leg boundary comfortably"
"crunches it back down the ground to finish the over with aplomb. Brilliant batting from Bairstow, and England are moving through the gears now"
beaten in the air and nearly scooped to cover-point. Clever bowling
pushed down to long-on
<strong>reverse sweep and Billings gives it away!</strong>. He didn't get that anywhere near the middle; it caught the top of the bat and flew up straight to the man at 45. He goes for an attractive half-century
full and flighted to begin with. He slaps it past mid-off to get Bairstow back on strike
"nice shape on that, got a bit of turn and Bairstow opted to shoulder arms"
"crunched through cover, and makes that look so easy. It races past the fielder in the deep, and what wasn't a bad over from Zampa is slightly tainted"
"slower ball, Woakes gets low and pokes it to backward point"
"another one that had the pace taken off, Woakes finds the same fielder"
"driven crisply to extra cover, well fielder and he keeps him on strike. Nice over from Marsh so far"
another one finding that fielder. Are we really on track for a maiden?
no we're not anymore. Clumped down to long-on and Bairstow has the strike
gets on the front foot and punches it through the offside. <strong>Just one off it</strong>
full and well flighted. Driven to mid-off and he gets Bairstow on strike early in the over this time
"good bowling. Good length, a bit of air and some turn. Cut away to the backward point fielder"
"driven back and it smacks the stumps at the other end. Woakes was stranded out of his crease, but Zampa didn't get a hand on it. Lucky break for the England allrounder"
"eased down to long-on for a single. Decent couple of overs for Australia, out of nowhere, really"
"pushed through the offside, for sweeper cover to cut off"
"googly, tapped into the onside for a single"
"<strong>Makes the breakthrough</strong>. Rolled his fingers over it and it spins in sharply to pierce the gap between bat and pad and knock off stump back! He has to go for a magnificent century, and Australia have a bit of wind in their sails now"
"Curran blocks it back. It hits the non-striker's stumps again, but this time Woakes is well in"
"another slower ball. Curran looked like he was set up for it, though. Nudged into the offside"
"rolls his fingers over it once more. The last three overs, Australia have really pulled England back"
blocked. We may be looking at a wicket maiden 41st over
"dabbed into the onside, just that one off it"
nudged down the onside after he dances down the crease awkwardly to ensure he didn't get stumped
nudged down to mid-off
"googly, clipped through the onside"
"leg stump line on that occasion, and he works it away down to fine leg. They tried to push for two, but Starc was too sharp to allow it"
lovely bowling. Gripped and turned and nearly took the bails with it. Only a thin outside edge saves him
"dot ball to finish a really solid spell. Nine wickets and 51 runs, often coming on when the batters were attacking"
opens the face and guides it down to third man
"off stump line, good length. No timing on it from Woakes. Cummins looking to finish strongly"
targets the short boundary once more. Lots of bottom hand into that clip to cow corner and England pick up a much-needed boundary. A first in nearly 5 overs
"rolled his fingers over it, and he eases it down to third man"
another slower ball and that's guided into the gap past extra cover
defended to long-on. That's Cummins and Zampa both done!
squared him up almost. Hits the pads
slapped back over the head of the bowler. It's gun-barrel straight and it <strong>splits long-off and long-on in half</strong> as Woakes picks up his second boundary
"tucked into the onside, and clever running brings them back for two. England need that urgency now"
slower bouncer. Woakes hangs the bat up above his head and flicks it down to fine leg
"another short ball, pulled to midwicket"
loose ball down legside
tickled down to fine leg. A despairing dive from Carey doesn't quite cut off the single
chipped to long-on on the bounce
pushes him back with a quick ball that Curran just about fends off away from his body
slower ball and Curran looked very hesitant dealing with it. Ended up trying to guide it to third man and got beaten
"slashed away, didn't quite middle it and they pick up one to third man"
"drops this one shorter. Woakes tried to smear that down to midwicket, but beaten by the (lack of) bounce"
"full toss, but it was menacingly targeting the stumps, and Woakes can just about carve it to a cover fielder. Decent over"
"slaps that hard back to the bowler, and after a bit of confusion, they scamper through"
drags this down legside. Australia have been a bit untidy today with the extras
"took the pace off it, and an ill-timed slog finds long-on along the ground"
"low full toss, and Woakes smiles wryly at missing another one of those. That was one he really should have capitalised on"
that ones very nicely placed. Made room and carved the short ball over the head of the man stationed at 45. Intelligent batting
squeezed to extra cover and they exchange ends
"tucked into the square leg region, and Starc looked a little awkward cutting that off. It enabled England to come back for three, but Australia a shade concerned for Starc, who's supposed to send own the next over"
"Curran connects well with one, and Starc has been slapped down to cow corner. It was in the slot, and he lay in wait anticipating adelivery of this sort, and executed the shot perfectly. Starc under pressure right from the off"
<strong>gets his revenge</strong>. Sends down one of those unplayable yorkers he's the best in the world at. Got revrse swing to moves it away from the bat and clatter into the base of off stump
clipped down to mid-on and he gladly gets off strike
"gloriously picked up and Woakes lifts it over extra cover to send it trickling away for four. Starc going for the yorker again, and only just missed it. Woakes was good enough to capitalise"
digs it out and runs it down to third man
wide yorker and a dot ball to end
"slower ball, crunched down to deep cover"
"that is an unplayable yorker, and too good for Adil Rashid. Shame it just missed off stump, because there was little he could have done about it"
this one only just misses the leg stump as Rashid steps away and tries to smear it through the onside
"slower ball, chipped through the onside and the lack of pace on the shot and the long boundary means there's time enough for a couple"
squeezes it down to third man
"firmly struck back past the bowler, who snatched at it. Goes down to long-off, though, and he keeps the strike"
clears his front leg and has a baseball-style slog to cow corner. Wasn't quite timed as well as his other shots  though and it's cut off at the boundary
"this one was a bit too wide, which meant Woakes couldn't quite middle it. Flew up off the bottom edge, but as has happened so often today, it lands safely"
"Ho ho ho! That was as premeditated as they come. Rashid moves across and shows all three stumps, but smashes it over square leg. That came cleanly out of the middle, and he's joined in the fun"
helicopter shot from him this time. Whips it down to long-on and gets a single
the full toss was carved down to the cover boundary
"moved across and Starc responds with a bouncer. Rashid tried to smear it anyway, but he's beaten. Eventful over, that"
"that's a ridiculous shot. Went across and initially appeared like he'd lap it to fine leg, but opens the face and squeezes it fine of short third instead. Brilliant thinking"
charged down the track but the change of pace bests him
"lobs it over cover, and a diving stop from Labuschagne prevents what looks a certain boundary"
"poor bowling. Full and wide, and that one was punished as it should have been. Carved through the gap past backward point and Woakes is one away from a priceless half-century"
"slower ball, smeared down to cow corner for two. <strong>50 for Woakes</strong>, off just 38. Such a clever innings, and how these runs might matter in three hours or so"
"shorter from him to end. Slapped to long-on and Woakes calls Rashid back for another two, and they <strong>finish with 302</strong>. That's an excellent effort given they had the specialist batsmen all gone by the death, and lost the first over off the first two balls. England the happier side going in, but this is a fantastic wicket for batting. We've got a phenomenal chase coming up."
"tight line, but clipped off the hips with<B> exceptional timing</b>, towards the short leg-side boundary. Quickly on, quickly off ..."
"back of a length, Woakes just adjusting his line a fraction to avoid those hips, tapped to mid-on"
"probing from Woakes, blocked on the line of off stump as he pushes the ball across the left-hander"
"back of a length again, Woakes already veering towards hitting the pitch rather than attacking the edge. Blocked in a rush"
"fuller length this time, Warner drills a drive from under the eyeline but straight to cover"
"nip from just back of a length, into the thigh pad as Warner is tucked up. Good adjustment from Woakes to close out that over"
"fired down the leg side, albeit with some encouraging inswing to the right hander"
another one veers down the leg side. A lovely curling ball to a left-hander...

"long-hop outside off, 90mph, but flogged a touch floppily into the covers where Morgan fields well. He got away with that one"
"<B>compact cover drive</B>. Fractionally over-pitched but that's to the longer side of the ground so would have been a certain four on the standard measurements. As it is, they run the fourth anyway!"
"pounded on the up, and <strong>over long-off!</strong> Loose so far from Archer, hasn't found his length for this deck yet"
"rolls the fingers on the slower ball, and finds a good channel outside off"
"<B>a whistling edge, flies over the heads of the cordon!</B> A genuine nicked drive, good pace. But first and second slip just looked and shrugged. Not reaching that!"
"very full, outside off, drilled back to the bowler, who stops well in his followthrough and sends Warner sprawling for his crease with a feigned shy"
"a thick outside edge, they all count, into acres of space at deep point"
"<B>beauty!</B> Excellent length, hint of nip off the seam, Finch is trapped flat-footed on the crease as the ball rears past his splice"
"half an appeal as Woakes thumps the pad, but that's sliding down"
"<B>massive appeal, bang in front! Gone!</B> Finch doesn't blink as he turns on his heel, shaping in, thumping a pad that was positively Watto-esque in girth. That was smashing the lot, and England have their breakthrough!"
"plopped onto a perfect full length, attacking the top of off, and blocked with a full face"
"sharper areas from Archer to his bunny Warner. Hitting the pitch hard outside off, 'Wait on, no!' is the cry as he stabs to cover"
"leaning onto the drive, and <B>pumped through the covers!</B> Sweet timing, and even better placement"
"Archer drags his length back, and Warner is in all sorts of bother on the not-quite-cut. That was 92mph, and he struggled to get over the stroke"
"thumped into the covers once more. It's a duel out there, and though he's clearly not settled, Warner does at least have some momentum to his innings"
"very full length, hint of shape away from the bat. Blocked to the off side"
"outside off, left alone"
"panned on the up, and <B>straight through Archer at mid-off!</B> He barely had time to see that, let alone catch it!"
"hitting the pitch hard outside off, and blocked to the off side"

blocked on the back foot

"slower ball from Woakes, Stoinis didn't pick it and tries to flick to the leg side, gets an edge to Morgan at short mid-wicket"

"shorter ball, worked off his pads to the leg side"
"on a length on middle and off, he works towards cover"
"good line, he jabs away towards square leg"
"length ball outside off,he leaves it alone"
"back of a length, tucked off the hip as Archer hits the deck hard on a middle-and-leg line"
flicked around the corner for a quick single
"head right over the ball, and pressed into the off side"
drawn forward on the front foot
"lifting on an off-stump line, played very late with soft hands, steered out to the gully as he probes the angles behind square"
"through to the keeper, skidding through very low, left alone"
"flashed down to third man, a touch of width to help with the angle"
"dead-batted block, soft hands as he waits for the length ball to come onto the bat"
"flipped off the pads, into the gap at deep square leg"
"firm in defence, as Woakes rolls the fingers on the cutter, perfect probing full length"
"another cutter, slo-moing into the pads and clipped into the gap"
flicked on the up to the leg side
"length delivery, shaping into the legs, and nurdled square"
"on the up, punched into the covers, they thought the third was on ... but decided against it."
"attempted leave outside off, thumps the under-side of the bat, and down into the crease"
"outside off, dabbed to third man, probing away in the channel"
"<B>pinged with intent through midwicket!</B> Wood sits up, and Warner is waiting for him! Timed sweetly as well. That's the danger of speed on this surface"
"<B>great follow-up!</B> Beaten all ends up outside off, zipping through to the keeper. Pace is pace innit ... (as they say in Hackney)"
"decent turn from just outside off, clipped calmly to the leg side"
"round the wicket, a fraction short, Warner clambers into a pull, almost kneeling at the point of impact"
sliding down the leg side as Warner heave-hos into a wild slog with the line. It's a jolly small boundary out there...
"dipping into the toes on a fuller length, Warner responds with a prod behind square"
tucked off the pads to the leg side
"<B>bowled him!</B> Wow, Warner has been opened up like a can of peaches! Big spin as Warner retreated to leg to make room, but was utterly undone from a middle-and-leg line. Gripping, ripping, clipping the top of off. Wow! Who needs Archer as your nemesis, when Joe Root is on the scene!"
leaning onto the front foot to block back to the bowler
"trapped on the crease with a full length, leaping into the thigh pad, good shape into the right-hander"
"whippy into the leg side, solid connection from outside off, but can't beat the ring"
"blocked on the back foot, rising into the splice. Good wheels from Wood, who has licence to cut loose now as Australia concentrate on regrouping"
"right up to the blockhole, solid connection on the drive, but no timing as mid-on swoops round. I think he's broken the toe of his bat with that one..."
"huge appeal, sliding into the right-hander, but perhaps doing too much. That was up to <B>93mph</b>, as Wood's handbrake starts to slip ..."
"back of a length, rising into a compact hopping block. Wheels"
"on the back foot, and tucked to the leg side"
"down on one knee, flicked high over the shoulder, bobbles away behind square"
"looped onto a good length, pressed back to the bowler"
"<B>flicked across the line, is there an inside-edge on that? You bet there is!</B> A fat deflection, onto the knee-roll, a simple lob to Buttler as he jogs round from behind the stumps. And suddenly Australia's challenge is in free-fall!"
"fired in flat from round the wicket, and slids on towards a very deep-set back pad. Just about digs it out!"
"pre-meditated reverse sweep, tapping the ball with the turn to backward point. Golden-arm sees off another over"
"outside off, pinged through at 92mph, back of a length, poked out to point"
"crashes into the pad on the full, but outside leg stump"
"leaning onto the front foot, and driven back down the pitch"
"Wood bends his back, and sizzles a skiddy bouncer through at 95mph. Carey limboes, as well he might!"
"round the wicket, attacking the left-hander's stumps on the angle, and flinched from deep in the crease to mid-on"
"full length, and pushed down the ground to mid-on. Excellent from Wood, rising to the opportunity to crank up the heat, and Australia are going nowhere fast"
nurdled to the leg side
fizzed through on a tight line outside off
"stretching forward, and worked off the toes to the on side"
"round the wicket now, and <B>that's a fine stroke</B>, down on one knee for the sweep, and hauling the wide-of-off line through square leg with powerful timing"
"up on the toes, blocked on the back foot, back to the bowler"
"nurdled around the corner, flicking with the spin from outside off"
"Gets an inside edge and it bounces up into the air. He ensures it doesn't drop onto the stumps by deflecting it away with the bat. I wish that wasn't allowed, personally. One of my pet peeves"
pumped down to square leg off the back foot
"comes round the wicket, tucked down to fine leg"
targeting the stumps. Driven down to long-on
"wide of off stump, <strong>very lucky he didn't chop it on</strong>. Runs down to fine leg"
good pace and bounce. Defended back to the bowler
"slightly short, angled down to sweeper cover"
"squeezes this one through the cover region, and it races away. Slightly overpitched and Labuschagne leans into it and finds the gap"
"quick single, a direct hit might have sent him back! Had to get a full length dive in, and he still wasn't making it if the stumps had been hit"
sliced to backward point
"dropped into the offside and another quick single, and this time it's a run-out! The keeper collects cleanly and removes the bails, and moments after getting a warning, Labuschagne has to go!"
pushed into the offside
"slower ball to start off, just 75 mph. When I bowl 75, though, my shoulder's sore for days"
picked up and disdainfully dispatched over cow corner. Maxwell isn't hanging around. Targets the short boundary and clears it comfortably
worked away down to deep point and they comfortably come back for two. Good start to the over for Australia
comes back with a well-directed bouncer. Maxwell does well to get his nostrils out of the way
"change of pace, cut away through the offside"
"short of a length, defended. 9 off that over thanks to Maxwell's pugnacity"
gets very sharp turn once more. Maxwell completely lost his shape on that one as it threatened to squeeze past his bat
""
"that went on with the arm, tucked into the onside"
"brings it back into the right hander dangerously again, defended to the onside"
darted though and defended
"eased away for one, and Maxwell keeps the strike for the Archer over"
pace off and that kept low. Went underneath the bat and nearly took off stump with it
"clobbered away to cow corner, but Morgan has another man in place there now. Good captaincy"
"nasty bouncer from around the wicket. Carey didn't know much about that, and it hit the handle of the bat"
"<strong>he holes out this time! Soft, soft dismissal</strong>. Oh, wait, that's a big, big no-ball. Carey survives! He had chipped that straight to third man where Adil Rashid took an easy catch, but Australia have a reprieve"
nails it in front of square leg. Set up for the slog and cleared his front leg to hammer it into the onside
top edge off a short ball and that flies over the keeper's head for four. You can see the anger radiating from Archer's face at the moment
"back of a length, and Maxwell defends this one. Another costly over for England, in more ways than one"
nudged into the offside
eased to archer at mid-on
opens the face and carves it through the offside
"slightly wide of off, kept low and spun, but he squeezes it through the cover region and they come back for a couple"
"whizzes this through wide outside off, Carey watches it go"
"clipped to mid-on, and Australia scuttle through for one. Archer tries the direct hit, but misses comfortably. Not a fun five minutes or so for him"
keeps low and hits the bottom of the bat
"length ball, poked away to backward point"
defended to the offside
"took the pace off, clipped to short midwicket on the bounce"
"driven firmly to the offside. Stellar start, this, from Curran"
"<strong>maiden over.</strong> He thought about a quick single, but the fielders swirled and he decided otherwise"
opens the face and slices it away to sweeper cover
"dropped the ball slightly short of a length and quicker, cut away for one"
pushed into the offside. Australia content to take the singles off Root
"as I say that, he punishes a long hop by clattering this through the onside. Races away for four. It was a rare poor delivery from the offspinner"
prodded to deep cover
Spun back in and struck him on the pad. Eight off that over
"wicket-to-wicket line from close to the crease, targeting off stump. No nonsense, basic bowling that's squeezing the runs"
"clever slower ball, Carey can only nudge it to short extra"
skips across the line to lap him to fine leg. The first run he's conceded in nine balls
"slower once more, runs it down to short third man, but doesn't quite beat the fielder"
"back at the cricket, though, we've got Curran tonked away for four over extra cover. Made room and lofted it above the infield, and a diving Morgan on the boundary can't cut it off"
"crisp drive to mid-off, no run"
"well flighted, pushes him back. A bit of bounce and turn"
another little dab to the onside. Root rushes through his overs so quickly
"he won't rush through them now Maxwell's slapped him over his head for a colossal six. That was right in the slot, and Maxwell couldn't have asked for a better ball to clobber away"
steps back but can only defend to mid-on
run down to long-on
"darted through and flicked past short third. Eight from that over, and Australia managing to build something resembling a partnership, finally"
"slower ball, dropped dead and they scamper through for a single"
"scythed down to third man, where Bairstow. sharp as he is, can't prevent them coming back for a couple"
wide yorker that's a touch too wide
very similar delivery but this time Maxwell decides to chop it away through the gap between backward point and short third to send it racing away for four
"gets a leading edge, but drops harmlessly on the offside"
"that struck him in front, and might even have got an inside edge, so they appeal excitedly. Umpire doesn't think so, and Morgan opts against reviewing. Height might have been an issue"
takes on the arm of Jason Roy at backward point. Needed a direct hit but they run through for one
"nearly squared him up. Was drifting in and Maxwell, realising he had moved too far across, defends"
"once more, gets into that awkward position and ends up defending"
"runs it down to deep sweeper cover. Now, Rashid to Carey"
starts off with a googly that is left alone
"<strong>slog sweep to the short boundary, and that goes for six - just!</strong>. Root was stationed underneath and it looked like it was going straight down his throat. But the breeze is blowing in that direction, and Carey gets away with it"
"guided through the offside. Nine off that over, but could have been so, so different"
"good length at pace, poked into the onside"
"fuller this time, driven straight back to him"
"knocked away to backward point, but no run to be had. Another solid start to the over from Curran"
"rolled his fingers over that, it's helped down to third man"
"doesn't matter this is a long boundary, that's clobbered to the long onside boundary. Got into position and found it was right in the slot, and picked it up and sent it the way of the car park!"
"dragged down legside, England appealed to no avail. But it's not given wide, so that's what they might have wanted after all"
driven to short extra cover
"beaten all ends up by an outstanding googly, popped up in the air on the offside as he tried to smear it through midwicket"
"slightly short, and Maxwell is incensed he didn't punish it"
watched it carefully and prodded it into the offside
"another googly, this is crunched to sweeper cover and they come back for a couple"
helped down to midwicket. 5 off that second Rashid over
pushes him onto the back foot. Good pace and carry
opens the face and guides it down to third man. That's bowled at over 85mph and it's so fine third man has absolutely no chance
"starved him of room and Carey tries to chop it down to third man, almost chops it onto the stumps"
tucks this into the onside and they exchange ends
rocks back and slogs this to cow corner. Doesn't get the timing right and only fetches him the single
cramped him again. Squeezed down to third man as Carey keeps the strike
angling across from over the wicket. Punched down to mid-off
"chipped the slower ball into the vacant region over midwicket, and that brings up his <strong>fifth ODI half-century</strong>. He needs to do a lot more to keep his side in this"
defended to the onside
driven to mid-off
"clipped down to mid-on, and Archer, cutting it off, slips and lands flat on his backside. They should have come back for two, while Archer looks down in a bit of embarrassment"
poking away at that nearly brought the outside edge
eased to midwicket and Bairstow keeps it to a single
"goes for an almighty heave over extra cover but misses completely. Buttler fails to gather, but Maxwell had his foot inside"
angled to deep cover-point
"darts this one through, and sloppiness kicking in for England. Australia scamper a single, and no back-up from the through allows them another one"
drove in the up but got a thick inside edge
"Maxwell tries an immense reverse sweep, making a mess of it and collapsing to the floor. England appeal, and <strong>upon being denied, review</strong>. It strikes him on the arm, but may have taken the glove band on the way. Umpire thinks so, and gives it not out"
"back of a length, nudged to the leg side, another single to the cause"
pushed firmly back down the ground
"shaping into the legs, tucked into the gap at midwicket. Singles suddenly on offer everywhere"
"tight line, solid defence on the back foot. Very full length tailing into the pads and blocked, a hint of reverse maybe?"
"flicked behind square as Woakes hits the deck just back of a length, angled into the body"
"good finish to the over, full length again, attacking off stump, defiantly blocked on the back foot. Just the four from the over to restore some control. England rather need a wicket"
"<strong>a flappy slog-sweep, and that's plugged in no-man's land!</strong> No contact of any note, and just as well, plops safely to bring up a run-a-ball hundred stand"
"shuffling onto the back foot, fenced firmly through the covers, and that's an excellent double-stop on the rope, a sprawling dive first-up, then a well-judged pick-up"
"defended on the back foot, Rashid probing a full length"
"<B>clattered on the up and over cow corner!</B> Maxwell has bided his time, and this time he gets right underneath a full-blooded launch, down on one knee! Shot!"
flashed to the leg side
"down on one knee, and swept firmly behind square. 12 off the over and the magic isn't happening yet for Rashid. He  needs a hand to break this one down ..."
poked off the back foot in defence
"attempted pull, underedged off the toe and out into the covers. A scampered single will suffice"
"full-faced defence, right back down the line of the ball. Solid"
"another measured pull, hopping inside the line of the slower-ball bouncer, and worked behind square"
"<B>lovely ball</B>, a cutter, full length, tight line, zipping off the deck and past the outside edge. Beaten"
"another slower ball, stabbed to point off the back foot, that's an excellent over in the circumstances, as Morgan turns to his Mr Reliable to wrest back control. Just two runs there"
"<B>monstered into the Point!</B> That is absolutely huge! Second tier of the massive great red monolith at wide long-on, and who's going to rescue that? Some bloke has emerged with gloves on to return the vector of disease... Wallop!"
""
"width and slashed, a fat edge through a wide vacant cordon. Loose but gets away with it"
"down on one knee, swept to backward square"
"a toe-ended slog, wide line, hauled through mid-on. Rashid offering up tempting width"
"another sweep to complete another leaky over from Rashid. I wonder if it's time to call for Jofra... England still have options after all, thanks to Root's early spell"
"on the back foot, clipped square, another hasty single to the cause"
"thumps the pad on the full length, deflected to the leg side. Another single"
"hustled on the back foot, but stabbed solidly into the gap at midwicket. Singles singles ..."
pulled firmly to the leg side
"full and fast, angled across the left-hander and flashed with an open face to third man"
"fast once more, fired down the leg side, there's a definite noise as it goes by but England agree with the umpire, that's flicked the pad. A dot at least, rather than a wide."
"down on one knee, and swept again to bring Maxwell back on strike"
"attempted reverse paddle, misses the wide legbreak as he does so"
"good ball, right up to the bat, dipping under a wild slog, and turning past the off stump"
"<B>flat and fast, belted through midwicket once more!</B> Too straight, and Maxwell is in his element, kneeling into the stroke to mow it hard"
"down on one knee, Maxwell slaps a pull from wide of off stump, forced into a drag from outside his eyeline"
Carey ticks into the gap with another sweep. Job done for Australia in that over. Chiselling away at the requirement
"good pace and carry from Wood, lifting outside off and through to the keeper"
"worked to the on-side, hopping into line"
"banged in short, a clawed pull to mid-on, and Archer's shy at the keeper's end almost takes out Wood in his followthrough!"
"whistling down the leg side, shape on that delivery, but misdirected"
"hits the bat hard, as a pushed prod flies in the air and just short of mid-off"
"another wide, Wood bending his back and going for it, but straight occasionally veers to the leg-side"
"full and straight, better areas from Wood but met with a straight bat from Maxwell, pushed to mid-on"
eased on the front foot to wide long-off. Easily back for two. And Australia continue to head deeper and deeper into their pursuit
clawed out to deep midwicket
"round the wicket, cramped on the legs, can't work the angle off the pads"
"<B>open-faced flash through third man!</B> Excellent batting, meeting the back-of-a-length delivery with an angled bat, where Rashid can't cut it off!"
"hits the bat hard on a fuller length, poked to the off side"
"cutter, full length, tight line, solid in defence to mid-off"
"rolls the fingers again, but it's a wide line and Maxwell slashes at it hard... and straight to backward point. A loud groan of annoyance ... a precious dot to close out the over"
"hopping onto the back foot, tapped to cover, and up comes the 150 stand from 144 balls. Proper job!"
"banged in short, swatted to the leg side, ducking into the pull"
"fizzed through outside off, Carey is slashing hard on the back foot but can't connect"
"thumps the pad hard on a full length, but outside leg, and deflected into space at short third man"
"<B>whoosh!</B> Loose from Maxwell, throwing the bat through the line, and missing it entirely. Length and pace from Wood. But through him too soon"
"banged in short again, well bowled but well enough played, hauled out to the leg side, with enough pace off the ball to force the sweeper to run in from deep. Five off the over ... Australia are taking this to the wire..."
"round the wicket, fired down the leg side as Archer followed Carey's shimmy to the leg side, but overcompensated"
"blockhole ball, much better length, right up to the toes, and Carey can't create any pace on the ball"
"this is good from Archer, Pinning Carey to the crease with inswinging yorkers. He connected well, but predictably, straight to short cover"
"A change from Archer, banged in short, and <B>Carey rocks back for an uppercut!</B> Brilliant response, so nearly over the rope, just plugs inside... Archer's good work undone there..."
"followed Carey once more, fired into the pads, chipped off a leading edge, but safely over the bowler's head. Just the single..."
"slower ball, flapped hard out to the long cover boundary, where Bairstow's bullet arm dissuades them from coming back for three"
"flashed on the up to the on-side, another single to the cause."
"<B>pinged fine, and Wood's pace means he pays the price!</B> A huge wind-up from Maxwell, who underedges his pull behind square. A big start to the over!"
"tucked up on the back foot, but another single as Carey calls him through with the ball at his feet"
"full length, and whittled out to deep midwicket"
"flashed hard into the covers, pace from Wood, but wide line this time"
"pulled again, rolling the wrists out to deep midwicket"
"pushed back onto the stumps, flicked off the hip to backward square. That's nine off the over, and concerns for Morgan now. Woakes has been reliable, and Curran is a gun at the death. He's got six left ... and here he comes."
"hitting the deck hard outside off, and dying off the pitch as Maxwell swings into an air-pull"
"rolls the fingers well, just back of a length on off. Maxwell responds with a cautious push back past the bowler. The singles will suffice when the big shot isn't on ..."
"round the wicket, an optimistic appeal as Carey flicks down the leg side, but that's pad through to the keeper. Another dot though..."
"very full again, solid stab back to the bowler, all determined full faces of the bat at the moment"
"width, and <B>Maxwell clobbers it brilliantly!</B> Very full, almost too full to get under, but Maxwell's wrists are something else. Bunted over wide long-on"
"wide again, an uncomfortable dragged pull to midwicket, he's not so hot on that stroke, but the single is ample. Another over of more than a run a ball. The requirement keeps very much in sight"
"thumps the pad on a leg-stump line, Buttler scuttles to limit the damage"
"back of a length, slower ball, flashed across the line with a cramped pull to mid-on"
"slow and wide, this is cunning bowling, taking all the pace off with offcutters, and Maxwell flat-bats to point"
"a round-house pull, connects well to deep midwicket, Billings sweeps up and his shy is flat and true to the keeper's end, but that's <I>just</I> home with a dive... good awareness from Carey"
"another excellent cutter, tight line, full length, inside-edged to backward square. Another single"
"flicked to the on-side, a dab into space at midwicket and Maxwell instantly calls for the second. That's eight off the over with barely a shot in real anger..."
"round the wicket, Carey makes room to leg to work a nurdle behind point. Another single..."
"<B>battered high and hard, and Maxwell has his hundred!</B> Brilliant from Maxwell, seizing on the length, getting right underneath it and flogging it high over the sweeper!"
"poked to cover, anotther single to the cause,  and Maxwell off strike to take stock, which is no bad thing either..."
"rolls the fingers, on a tight leg-stump line, worked to square leg to take Carey into the 90s too ... what a turnaround since that no-ball reprieve!"
"hoicked to the leg side, a bit of a biff, but it's effective enough. That six basically won the over..."
another single to complete the over. Australia are walking this all of a sudden. Extraordinary
"on the pads, and <B>smoked over square leg!</B> Carey is onto 99... and this game is cooked!"
"on the pads, flashed through square leg for a <strong>raucously received hundred! </strong> Superb gutsy innings, and now Australia believe!"
"whipped to the leg side, back of a length from Woakes. Just the single"
"full length, wide line, slower ball. A bit of a windy woof of a drive, makes no contact"
nurdled behind square. Australia picking them off with ease now
"flat-batted pull, almost a tennis smash as Woakes hits the deck. Swept up in the deep to complete the over"
down on the knee for a measured sweep first ball ... finds enough of a gap
"<strong>huge wind-up and a top-edge!</strong> Rashid goes to his big legbreak, and Maxwell goes to his down-on-one-knee swipe!"
"<strong>another mow, another top-edge, and that's the wicket!</strong> Oh my! Rashid went for the slow wide one, tossed right up to tempt the glory wipe... and Curran at short third man just about clung on with a juggle as he leapt forward!"
"swept again, Rashid offers the googly to the left-hander. I suspect it'll be big leggies to the new boy!"
"back and across, fenced through backward point to a ripple of grateful applause from the balcony. Who knew such tension was possible in an empty September ground!"
"big wide googly, Cummins slaps a drive to long-off... he'll keep the strike. 14 needed... two good overs or three good strokes?"
"speared into the pads, good contact from Cummins, patted to square leg, over to his senior partner"
"firmly drilled as Archer nails a full-length inswinger, but Curran intercepts superbly at mid-off... looked like a four, only a single"
<strong>thumped on the wrist as Cummins limboes into the short ball!</strong> Trying to make room but that just followed him!
"good scramble from Cummins, on the back foot and blocked to cover. The shy would have been tight, but it's wide..."
"<strong>well bowled,</strong> Carey made room, Archer dangled it just inside the tramline, and he can't make contact! Precious dot!"
"<strong>that one is a wide though!</strong> Tried for the same ball, but just the wrong side of reachable. Good option though ... I wonder if he'll try it again..."
"<B>stunning catch at third man!</B> Mark Wood! Tumbling forward, like a mirror image of Simon Jones at Edgbaston ... swooping low, as Archer banged in the short wide one! The umpires are taking a look to make sure, but that reaction was unequivocal! Dipping out of the lights, amazing athleticism, stretching to the pitch, and suddenly, the key man is gone, and perhaps as importantly, it's another dot!"
"<strong>High and handsome!</strong> Archer's back on the rope at long on... but Starc has nailed the googly! Right in his slot, Rashid went for the wrong option there, and the new man was waiting for it!"
"another googly, clawed into the leg side, Bairstow is lurking at deep midwicket, and it's just as well he didn't make better contact... another run ticked off!"
"back of a length, thumped hard to long-on, just the single. Two to get, three balls..."
"<B>swept, and nailed through backward square!</B> Australia win the match, win the series, end England's unbeaten home run! Scenes!"
