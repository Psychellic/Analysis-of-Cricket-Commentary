starts around the stumps with a slip in. Good length ball nurdled into midwicket
"swift takedown of an lbw appeal from Shamsuddin. The reason - an inside edge. Round-armed dart on leg stump, Dhawan defends and gets some bat on it"
"pushed through on leg stump, Dhawan is cramped up as he tries t odefend"
attempts to combat Yusuf's flatter trajectories by running at him. The offspinner bowls it flatter still and the batsman pushes to mid-on
"meanwhile, Warner contends with spin by staying deep in his crease. Clipped to midwicket"
strides out to meet a shortish delivery outside off and punch it through to long-off
"back of a length on off stump, defended. Not particularly solidly because of the pace and bounce"
"fuller delivery outside off, Dhawan tries to hit through the line but his frontfoot drive finds mid-off"
"and he comes in handy straight away. Good length ball outside off, driven into the covers"
"ooh, Narine made it to the ball but didn't bend down enough. A hint of room, and with Morkel's pace, Dhawan had no qualms about slashing hard at the ball. It takes a thick outside edge, and third man is unable to stop it"
breathtaking! Dhawan has picked up a length ball and deposited it to the midwicket boundary.
"was that really necessary after back-to-back boundaries? Dhawan was skipping away to the leg side, to try and open up that short boundary at point and third man. In the end, all he does is give the fast bowler a free line of sight of the stumps and Morkel does the sensible thing and aims for middle. Dhawan's cut misses. And he has to walk back"
"good bowling. He's keeping a good length, and he's making sure the left-hander gets no room. Add his rapid pace and Warner doesn't have much time to manouevre the ball either. Defended"
"tucked away through midwicket, but his job isn't done yet. Walks up to the new batsman Henriques for a little chat"
"rather full on off stump, but Henriques plays all spin off the back foot, reading any turn off the pitch. Worked to long-on"
"that one did turn, and bounce. Warner kept back and softened his hands to knock the ball down on the leg side."
"nudged back to down the pitch, a few yards to the left of the Pathan bowling around the stumps"
"good length on off stump, driven to cover"
"he's running hard, wanting two, but mid-on makes his way to his left to prevent the dink into the vacant midwicket region from bleeding too many"
"full on off stump, driven to short cover"
"a tad too straight, Henriques plays a beautiful flick, but he finds midwicket"
"pushes down the ground and gets across to the other end, because Warner is the main man and he wanted to do well in the first six overs at the toss."
that's the first sign of unorthodoxy. Warner stays put in his crease and tries to use his wrists to whip a back of a length ball through wide mid-on. Doesn't time it.
"that was risky! Warner has become excellent at this shot. For all those saying he is only a basher, he saw the back of a length ball, perhaps even preempted it because it's Morkel bowling, waited for the ball to pass him outside off and gently tapped it past the wicketkeeper. Ojha dives to his left, but he can't reach it. Late cut, calculated to perfection"
"saw him coming! Henriques is feeling the pressure, and Yusuf in his third over is keeping it up. The batsman was advancing, so the offspinner dragged his round-arm delivery short and wide outside off. Henriques reaches out, panicking about being stumped, and gets an inside edge"
"fired in, aiming at the top of off stump, driven past the diving Pathan"
"punched through midwicket, and Pandey running in from the boundary keeps it to two."
"<b>dropped</b> by Pathan! Warner had laced this back foot thwack, and it came right back at the bowler. Yusuf tried to get down to it, but the ball hits his fingers and deflected away. Yusuf is in some pain here. A delay in play whilst that is sorted. Warner has been pushed to play a few too many strokes with the Knight Riders bowlers controlling their length so well. Here he had to throw his front leg aside to hit a ball that had very little width. Could easily have been a wicket"
waits on it and plays a neat late cut to third man
"tonked over midwicket! Yusuf messes up off the last ball. Was he expected Henriques to advance on him again like before? This is short and the batsman was waiting on the back foot, with a big back lift. Then down it comes for a pull shot"
"excellent awareness. Narine starts off with a rare lose ball. It was too far down leg, so Warner moved back, tucked it past the right of square leg inside the circle and to the left of the man on the boundary"
"another one down leg, Warner goes for the pull, and it could have been painful with fine leg inside the circle. No connection"
"tossed up offspinner on leg stump, Warner defends knowing its threat"
closes the bat face and turns the good length ball to square leg.
"flighted on off stump, Henriques reaches forward to tap it to long-on"
"that was almost the ball that got Warner out the last time. But in Delhi, he has overdone the flight. It was on leg stump, and Warner got into better position. In Kolkata, he had made room and was done in by the dip. Here he stayed behind the line of the ball, got under it and whipped it over midwicket"
driven through the covers to retain strike. That's the end of the powerplay. Forty-two on the board.
"shortish and outside off, Warner slices it to point"
"back of a length on off stump, Warner attempts the cut shot, gets under the ball and pulls on his bat like a chainsaw. Finds mid-off"
picked away off his hips to deep midwicket
turned to long leg. Henriques is getting some stability.
"that's a good stop at cover. It's back of a length and just a shade outside off, Warner manages to get on top of the ball and flat bats it to the man there"
"went for the yorker, which tailed in as well, Henriques works it to long leg"
"pitches on off stump and cuts it back into the right-hander, Henriques stays back and drums it to long-off"
"a helmetless Warner reaches forward, unsure of the way the ball will turn. This is the googly that hits Warner on the pad. Looks adjacent enough for an lbw appeal, which comes straight away, but perhaps it would have slipped down leg. Beautiful control"
comes down the track and driven to long-off
that one is a little short and Warner leaps back in his crease to cut to deep point
"second googly of the over, Henriques gets in good position, deep in his crease, waiting for the shortish delivery. Punches to long-on and hares across for a second"
"slows it down and gets the leading edge. Excellent bowling from Kuldeep. It seems to be the wrong 'un again, Henriques did not pick this. Having been sucked into the flight, he was on the front foot looking to flick the ball and mis-hit it to point"
"offcutter, and the batsman has seen it and clips to deep square leg"
"low full toss on off stump, pushed to long-on"
"another rising delivery on leg stump, Warner is cramped for room as he plays a pull shot on one leg, doesn't connect. As Ian Bishop has pointed out on the broadcast, Warner has not had anything to hit through the off side, which is his strength."
"Sunrisers need that. Both the runs, and where they came from. Henriques goes after the short ball and plays an authoritative hook shot"
"that's another bouncer, and it's directed just outside off and it gets good height too. Henriques has to drag it down from over his right shoulder to deep square leg"
"lands a yorker on off stump, Warner pushes it into the off side for only a single"
"pitches a tad short on middle stump, Warner kicks his front leg away and cuts to long-off"
"good batting. Henriques races down the track, gets to the ball before it pitches and drills the ball to long-off"
"that didn't seem like a strong enough connection. Came off the bottom of the bat, and it skewed towards long-off because it was the googly. But with the small boundaries here, Henriques gambles and wins"
"beautiful comeback! It was a flatter delivery, the batsman picked that up early and set up for the heave over midwicket. Only, he connects with the back of the bat and goes straight up! The bowler takes the catch himself. Beautiful wrist-spin bowling from Kuldeep"
"'come on!' Kuldeep yells, much like Warner has done in his own career. The Sunrisers captain is walking off furious with himself. Succumbed to a flat-bat shot soon after his partner did the same mistake. This was the one that comes into the left-hander. Warner went for the sweep, but the ball was a little too far away from him to make a solid enough connection"
"flighted a little outside leg, Hooda keeps out the hat-trick ball"
gets behind a good length ball and defends
""
"a littler shorter and quicker, and it turns as well. Blocks it again"
scooped! It was on leg stump and he simply played the line. Went down on one knee and lifted it over his right shoulder. Slip takes off after it
"flighted on middle and leg, defended"
"turns right past the face of the bat! Narine's taking over. This is the offspinner, pitched not quite where Yuvi's front foot can reach. So he has to predict how much turn the ball will get and accommodate it. Narine trumps his calculations"
"good length ball on off stump, driven towards extra cover"
strides forward and drills a drive to long-on
"offcutter, Yuvi gets down on one knee and slices it to deep third man"
"another offcutter, which gets some grip on the pitch, Hooda does well. Gently turns it to deep square leg and returns for a second"
stands tall behind a good length ball and pushes it to long-on. Hooda looks composed. Question is how long can he stay that way
"slashed to the third man boundary. That's the problem with part-timers. Their proclivity to bowl that one bad ball is a little higher than the specialists. This is wide outside off, Yuvraj throws his bat at it and gets a thick outside edge over the fielders inside the circle"
goes back and flicks a good length ball to deep midwicketa
top shot! A glimpse of the Yuvi of old. The bat whirling down on a flighted delivery and lifting it over wide long-on
encore! This time he strides out towards the pitch of the ball on middle stump and lofts it straight down the ground. Magnificent strike
"changes his length. It is a tad flatter, so Yuvi is wary of running down at it. He still has to play off the front foot though, and is beaten by the away spin. Top bowling"
turned away through midwicket
that's the googly. Driven to cover.
"starts with a yorker on off stump, and Yuvi can't do much more than keep it out"
"there's the short one on off stump, Yuvi moves outside the line and pulls to fine leg. Not much timing"
"140 kph, it's back of a length and outside off, slapped through cover after he had made some room"
"yorker on the base of off stump, from around the wicket, Yuvi digs it out towards point"
"shortish and just outside off, chopped to deep third man"
"top bowling. From around the wicket, digging it in, getting it to home in on Yuvi's nose. The batsman moves outside the line to try and hook it but is beaten."
takes the length ball and hits it with the turn. Massive front stride forward and that gives him the leverage to free the arms
tucked away through midwicket
"beautiful bowling! Narine pitches it up, and keeps it quick. Which means Yuvraj can't adjust once he had set up for the forward defensive. Beaten"
this one turns the other way. Lovely. Yuvi reads if off the pitch and keeps it out. He keeps his line so close to the stumps
"pushed through outside off, Yuvi attempts a half-hearted cover drive and is beaten"
belted down the ground. That was overpitched so it didn't matter how the ball will turn. Yuvi strides forward and gleefully damages the sightscreen
"he has a lot of power, this bloke. And he has his areas. Long-on and midwicket. Any ball that envisages his accessing those regions - like a length ball on the stumps - he never holds back. Flat hit"
"so the fast bowler goes short and takes the ball wider, Hooda cuts it to deep point"
"the speed gun has that at 150kph. It really can't be. Anyway, well done Yuvraj. Took on the short ball, knew fine leg was inside the circle and helped it over that man"
"ah, well bowled! Yuvi made his intentions too early by moving away to the leg side. Holder responds with an offcutter past the batsman's reach"
"another run-out for Hooda! He keeps throwing it away. Kuldeep again! Yuvi pushes to mid-off, took a few steps forward. Hooda, the junior partner at the other end simply took off, only to realise it was a half-hearted attempt at a single. Yuvraj stopped. Hooda couldn't. Kuldeep gets to the ball, knew he had the time to take aim, and fires a dead-eye throw."
great shot! This short ball just did not rise up and Yuvi strode onto the front foot and crashed it to the midwicket boundary. Sheer disdain. That's always been a quality of his strokeplay. Like punishing the bowler for thinking he could get away with such silly tactics
"that was text book. Cutting is the designated hitter and he decides he has to go straight away. Kuldeep must have sensed it. Threw the googly up wide of the batsman's reach, beat his frantic slash and is stumped"
"flighted on off stump, driven down the pitch and Kuldeep throws himself to his left to stop it"
"shortish and outside off, chopped to point and chaos! Yuvi had raced forward looking for a single. Ojha wasn't keen. Uthappa sensed a run-out opportunity, gets to the ball and takes aim at the bowler's end. It would have been curtains for Yuvi, except the throw hit his boot. Read - he did not come in the way of the throw. The ball simply hit him. That's why KKR didn't appeal. And as the ball was deflected away, Yuvi makes his ground"
comes down the track and drives through point
swept away to deep midwicket. Yuvi is starting to look imperious. Spin is not troubling him one bit. He's just getting under the ball and powering them away
comes forward and heaves the flighted delivery to the long-on boundary
""
"great work from Satish at deep midwicket! This ball was travelling, but he raced to his right, eyes on the ball all the way, dived after it as he neared the boundary and slapped it back inside the field"
swept away to deep midwicket
"shortish and outside off, cuts and misses"
"gets down the track, Narine had shortened his length and slaps it through to the sweeper"
"that's a top edge and it's the kind batsmen love. Yuvi set up for the front foot pull - should indicate that the ball really wasn't all that short. But it's that stage of the game where the batsman has to go. Goes for the swipe, and gets a boundary to third man despite Morne's big dive"
"ooooh, so close to the off stump. It's a good length ball on off stump, Yuvi is caught on the crease and prods at it. Uthappa has stayed down enough to collect the ball well and was even watching the back foot of the batsman, in case Yuvi overbalanced"
lashed to long-off
"moves around the stumps and tries to bowl the wide yorker, but it goes a little too far past that guideline"
that's fairly close to another wide. Skimmed right over that line. Yuvi attempts a cover drive against a low full toss wide outside off. Can't connect
"another example of clever, switched-on bowling from Knight Riders. Yuvraj premeditated a move to the off side to try and scoop the ball over short fine leg. But Holder trumped him by going full and straight. Bit too full to get under, and Yuvraj almost seemed to positioned himself too far from the ball to connect anyway"
"shortish and outside off, guided to point by the new batsman Bhuvi"
"short and slow and wide outside off, Ojha goes after it and misses"
"big appeal, did it carry? Umpire Shamsuddin says yes. It's a full delivery a shade outside off, Ojha swings across the line, gets a feather that carries to the wicketkeeper. Great work from Uthappa again, coming forward and diving in front to take the catch"
"back of a length delivery with not much room, Bipul tries to chop it away, gets an inside edge"
"launched over long-off! Doesn't matter if you are one of the premier bowlers in the world. If you put the ball on a length, you will disappear. Bipul moves to leg to make some room and hammers it away"
"shortens his length, Bipul moves away from the ball, tries a cut but can't connect"
"wallooppppp! This could prove very very costly for KKR. It was a short delivery on middle and leg, Bipul cleared his front leg and flat bats it straight down the ground"
"attempts a bouncer on and around off stump, Bipul goes for a hook but gets only an inside edge"
"a little juggle from Pandey, but he holds on. It's a back of a length delivery that the batsman goes after and toe-ends it to mid-off. Couldn't get on top of the ball. Pays for it, does Bhuvi"
"has he missed a full toss? Yes he has. But they do get a bye. Morkel went for the yorker outside off, but Bipul's habit of moving away from the fast bowler - that's fear - hurts him."
"and he finds swing right away! Back of a length and ducks back in, Uthappa prods with his feet paralysed to the crease. He drags an inside edge that runs away past the leg stump"
"full one, pitches outside leg, and swerves in, Gambhir rolls it off his thigh to the leg side"
"full and angling outside off, run away past wide slip"
"full and outside off, punched out to mid-off"
"back of a length and angled in on off, Uthappa presses forward and pushes it back to the bowler"
"full and outside off, Uthappa eases forward and plays a punchy drive to mid-off"
"shot!  Full and angling away wide outside off, enough width to work with. Uthappa cuts it firmly to the cover boundary"
"shorter and outside off, dabbed to backward point. Cutting misses the direct hit and the ball runs through square leg. Dhawan chased the ball and dived, but the ball reached the boundary. Bonus for KKR"
"fullish and angling in, clipped through square leg"
"full and swings in on off, Gambhir stays back and taps it to mid-on for one"
"width, again! Uthappa picks out short extra cover, and Warner pumps his fist. Back of a length and angling away outside off, he hits on the up. Slaps and finds Henriques"
"full and cuts back in just outside off, Munro goes across the line and misses"
"starts with a good length ball on off stump, Gambhir backs away to cut to cover"
"moves into the left-hander, who does well after backing away. Didn't go with a horizontal bat shot. Defends"
"tossed up into the blockhole, Gambhir works it to midwicket"
"flighted on off stump, Munro drives through the covers"
"that was overdoing the darts. Hooda goes short, it sits up on this pitch and Gambhir rocks back and pulls it over the square leg boundary"
"good length ball, slower through the air, Gambhir comes forward to block"
"looks like a frustrating night for Sran. Bowls a shortish delivery at the left-hander's pads, Munro works it off his hips to the fine leg boundary"
seemed a little slow on the pull shot. The short ball was a tad too close for the shot anyway. Manages to get enough to lift it over midwicket and mid-on
"fearsome strike to the midwicket boundary! This is a back of a length ball on off stump, and when it comes at hip-height, Munro can swat it away all way."
"the short-ball tactic is not going to go away. Sran directs it better - on fifth stump - and gets it to bounce higher. Munro tries to pull off the front foot, gets struck high on the bat"
"that's the second part of the old one-two. The fuller ball, just outside off, Munro drives to the right of mid-off"
"well played. Gambhir had seemed to move across for a moment, but as soon as he realised this ball was tailing into him and looking for the blockhole, he made sure his feet got out of the way. Slices it to point. Fast adjustment"
"low full toss on leg stump, Munro pats it to mid-on and yells 'yeah, yeah, yeah!'"
so very crisp! There was very little wrong with the ball. Back of a length and angled across the left-hander. But Gambhir has timed his back foot extra cover drive to perfection. Beats Warner.
"shortish and on the pads, Gambhir turns it to square leg"
"through him! Lovely yorker from Bhuvi, at 137 kph too. And this looked properly pacy. Munro was barely into his shot when the ball was settling into the keeper's gloves"
"that's the offcutter, 122 kph, but Munro is able to make the most it because it is on the pads. Clipped to deep square leg"
"another low full toss, as he looks for the yorker, on leg stump. Pushed to mid-on"
"back of a length on off stump, defended into the covers"
"gets some kick, signs of the offcutter. Munro thought it was simply another back of a length ball and hoped to glide it away. But it moves into him and makes him inside edge the ball"
opens the face to the shortish delivery outside off and finds point
"yep, that's another cutter. A fastish one. Gambhir attempts to slice it behind point, but the ball dips under the bat."
neatly done. A little too much room on the slower ball and Gambhir rides it down to third man off the back foot.
"ah, 126 kph cutter foils Munro's drive through the off side. It holds up in the pitch, turns towards the inside edge and ends up at midwicket instead"
runs the shortish delivery outside off past point's right
"comes at the medium-pacer, who shortens his length as a natural counter. Gambhir manages to slide it to deep third man"
"banged in short on middle and leg, Munro leaves it"
sold straight bat comes to answer a back of a length delivery on leg stump. Single to long-on
"that's excellent batting. Moved across onto off stump, got on top of the bounce, and uses his wrists to send it backing to deep square leg. Magnificent timing and placement"
"direct hit at point! Yuvraj Singh has produced a bit of magic! One stump to aim at, and he hits the target before Munro could make his ground. Gambhir had dinked the ball to point, Yuvi hurtled up to it, got control of the ball in both hands, and whirled the throw in flat."
"starts around the stumps for a shortish delivery just outside off. Straightens after pitching, defends towards point. Gambhir sets off again, just like in the run-out the last ball, but Manish is wary of Yuvraj now and says no. A little frustration from the KKR captain"
"shortish and outside off, Gambhir attempts a cut and misses"
moves inside the line and clips the ball towards the square leg boundary. Gambhir's timing on the leg side has become phenomenal since he opened up his stance
"slower ball in the slot, Gambhir nails the cover drive, but there is a fielder right there to stop it"
"cramps him with a rising delivery on middle and off, Gambhir slices it to point"
shot! Gambhir takes a short delivery from outside off and pummels it to deep midwicket
"flighted on leg stump, Gambhir moves back and across outside off and nudges it around the corner"
"big lbw appeal, at least from the keeper as Bipul beats Pandey for lack of turn. Impact was just outside off, I think. The batsman couldn't quite get forward as he tried to defend a slider."
"dances down the track, gets to the pitch of the ball and heaves it to long-on"
"tucked to deep midwicket, where Hooda keeps it to a single"
"slower through the air, but round-armed in. Worked towards mid-on"
"comes down the track, but he doesn't have the room to free the arms because it's a flat delivery on leg stump. Turned through midwicket"
"miscue... miscue... terrible miscue and much like the Sunrisers' innings, KKR have lost their captain after a time out. It's a short ball, which rises a bit too high for Gambhir's comfort. He is surprised by the bounce, cramped by the lack of room but had already committed to the pull. Gets it high on the bat so it goes down to long-on instead of midwicket"
"shortish and on the hips, Pandey works it to deep midwicket"
"shortish on middle, Pathan pats it towards midwicket and gets across for a single. Nearly a collision between Cutting and Pandey"
"goes wide of the crease for the shortish delivery just outside off, Pandey attempts a push through the covers but instead winds up with an inside edge"
"goes for a slower short ball, cuts into the right-hander, Pathan gets inside the line to try and hook it away. Gloves it down to the keeper"
"length ball outside off waiting to be smashed. Yusuf tries, but gets an inside edge because he didn't move his front foot far enough"
good shot. A little bit of width tagged to this short ball and Pandey gets on top of it with a cut
"full on middle, Yusuf drives towards wide mid-on, but Bipul Sharma from midwicket cuts across to his left and prevents the single"
stands up tall against a back of a length delivery outside off and hacks it to long-on
"belted to deep cover. Pandey's getting his timing right. This was back of a length on middle and off, he makes a little room and laces it away"
"ahh, that's unfortunate. Yusuf has timed this flick so well, but because of that, it carries all the way to deep midwicket. Magnificent take from Bhuvi, running in from the boundary and diving forward to snaffle it up."
"slower ball on middle and off, worked to long-on"
"the return of the spinner is to Pandey's liking. Charges down the pitch, gets to the pitch and heaves it over the long-on boundary"
"the next ball is predictably flat, Pandey  works it to deep midwicket, where Warner races in with such fearsome speed. Would have fallen over himself had he been going any faster"
"good length ball outside off, driven into the covers"
moves back against a flatter ball and pushes it between long-on and deep midwicket
"flighted outside off, driven to long-off"
waited on the shortish delivery on off stump and pushes it into the covers for another single. Pandey doing the right thing by taking the singles and pushing the chase deep
"Pandey knows what I'm talking about. Steps forward to a good length ball and carves it over extra cover. Excellent connection, and placement because the man was up inside the circle"
"full on leg stump, whipped to long-on. That's at top pace."
"oh, the cutter foxed him! He does so well in target it. Pitches it on leg stump to tempt the batsman to play. Surya was pushing at the ball, hands leading far away from the body, with the open face, and still it takes the outside edge because of the turn"
"good length ball, driven through the covers"
"almost a run-out at the non-strikers'. Push towards long-off and both batsmen instinctively thought of a single but Henriques moved swiftly to his right, dived after the ball and flicked it at the stumps. Could have had Pandey had it hit"
"he has scooped the Fizz to fine leg! Brave shot that, but it was an appropriate one to a low full toss on middle and off stump. Ordinarily, it might have been flicked for a single through midwicket. But Surya is a jack-in-the-box and he plays the scoop very well"
"slower short ball on leg stump, Pandey has a vertical bat coming down on top of the ball to hack it to midwicket"
goes short and Surya pulls it to the left of deep midwicket. Good placement
"that's the fuller one, tailing in a bit as well. The batsman flicks all around the ball and wears it on the pads. Would have slid down leg"
pushed to long-on.
"looks for another yorker on the base of leg stump, Surya manages to dig out out for a couple between midwicket and long-on"
"oh, that was dangerous. Premediated his movement outside leg and left his stumps open. Cutting went after them and would have had them too if the inside edge hadn't intervened"
neatly done. He stayed put noticing the line outside off and slid it to deep third man
"comes down the track, the left-armer goes shorter and takes all the pace off. Whipped to long-on"
"<b>dropped</b> by Mustafiz at the third man boundary! It's off the outside half of the bat that was sailing towards the ropes. The fielder had to move a bit to his right, and it was coming at him at head-height. Had moved in, and misjudged the catch in the first place. Couldn't adjust thereafter. Didn't look comfortable in that position and the ball pops out and over the boundary"
"shortish on off stump, directed to third man again"
"cut, but can't beat the off side ring. Surya comes up for a little chat with Pandey"
"shortish and outside off, chopped to long-on"
"that offcutter stayed a touch low, Pandey slogs it to deep midwicket"
"short and wide, Pandey belts it to the right of the sweeper cover. He wanted a second, but can't get it and is quite displeased about it"
"stands and slogs the slower ball to long-on. Lack of pace working for Henriques. Surya could not time that at all, even if it had been a short in length"
"well bowled again. Wicket-to-wicket and back of a length. Pandey, who was coming down the track, can only push to long-off"
"taken by deep square leg! Surya goes for the pull, this one's the short ball at top pace and the batsman hasn't middled the ball. Dhawan runs in from the boundary, moves to his left, dives to get underneath and takes it very well indeed. Bit of a swirler, so excellently done."
"fuller ball on middle, turned to short fine leg to retain stirke"
brilliantly struck. Pandey had kept his front leg out of the way to drill an almost yorker into the covers. Doesn't find the gap
"ohhh, that's the batsman-fall-over-yorker! Fires it in on leg stump, Sathish just about manages to squirt it to fine leg"
"another yorker, and this one goes straight through the batsman. Aims outside leg stump at this stage because the batsmen try to make room. Never gives them any"
"looks for the base of middle this time, and the 138 kph yorker is very well kept out. Pandey kept his eyes on it excellently and took a single to the keeper too."
"back of a good length, pitching outside leg and cut across the right-hander to hit him below the hip. Sathish was slogging across the line and can't get anything on it. Takes a leg bye though"
"massive strike! Not in terms of distance, but in terms of how well he read Mustafizur. Knew he would go yorker again, so walked at him, rattled him, got a full toss and smashed it to midwicket. Pandey has read the Fizz very well tonight. So much that he has been attacking him. Checking if its four or six. It appears like the ball has pitched an inch inside the advertising triangles. Lots of replays. Lots of angles. And finally, it is decided as a four"
"another yorker on middle, inside edge off the boot and into the covers. The bowlers executing these gun deliveries - yorkers, bouncers, cutters - in this match has been superb"
"that's KKR's last hope. It's a low full toss, following the batsman who had made room outside leg, Pandey lifts it up hoping to clear the long-on boundary. But Hooda is down there, waiting for the catch"
"through his legs! Bhuvi has been jamming those yorkers down under pressure excellently. Sathish was backing away, Bhuvi followed him"
low full toss on leg has been mis-hit. Only just cleared the 30-yard circle when he should have been tonking them over the boundary
comes down the track and inadvertantly makes a length ball as a yorker. Inside edge to long leg
"full on middle, Holder clips to deep midwicket for a couple"
"falls short of the long-on hurtling in! It's the offcutter, pitching outside leg and making the batsman slog across the line. That's how Mustafiz gets his wickets, because then the offcut has every opportunity to take the edges."
"that's another cutter at 125 kph, moves wide of the crease and makes the angle across the right-hander work for him. Holder cleared his front leg to hit over long-off. Misses"
and now he lands a leg stump yorker at top pace and beats Holder all ends up. Through his legs as he attempts a flick
"just over mid-on! Holder does well against this leg stump line. Cleared the front leg like the other batsmen, but played with a straight bat. Gave himself the better chance of middling the ball even with the cut"
"goes for a reverse dab, and it looked entirely premeditated. He was in no position to make a connection. Hits him on the body. Sathish is mindful of sneaking a quick single."
"yorker on leg stump, Sathish jams his bat down and gets it to long-on for a couple."
"aims for the pads, with the batsman moving towards leg. Holder looks to whip it to midwicket, can't connect."
"that's how! 140 kph yorker on middle stump, Sathish misses, Bhuvi hits. Leg stump goes for a walk and Warner yells in delight"
"this is outrageous bowling! Landing yorker after yorker after yorker. This one is wide of off stump so Narine, the new batsman, can't reach it"
"shortish and slower, Narine heaves it to deep midwicket"
"another slower ball, Holder wasn't quite well balanced when he went for the loft towards long-off. The ball hit high on the bat and carried only as far as long-off"
"offcutter outside off, dot ball! Take a bow, Bhuvi! Narine squirts it to third man, looks for a single, can't find it. Done and dusted."
