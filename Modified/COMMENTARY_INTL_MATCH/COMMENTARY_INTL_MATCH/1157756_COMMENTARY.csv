a hint of seam movement has Powell playing away from his body. Dinky old dab to short cover
lets the back of a length ball come to him and so looks more in control as he defends towards point
gets a little too straight and Powell knocks it between midwicket and mid-on. Excellent timing - and that's all he concentrates on. No need to overhit on this flat pitch and fast outfield.
"homes in on middle and off, Powell presents the full face"
"<b>beats him</b> as Powell flirts with a shortish delivery outside off. The cut doesn't work, largely because his feet don't really bring him across and in position to play the shot"
gets across in line with a shortish delivery on off stump
forces the left-hander to leap off his feet to handle a rising delivery on off stump. Hemraj taps it towards point
"brave leave, as a length ball pitching on middle stump is allowed to carry on with the angle. It was a different story with a red ball and Keaton Jennings on strike"
"appeal for lbw, but it might well have pitched outside leg. Hemraj is caught on the push forward by Bumrah's pace and a fullish delivery raps him on the back pad. Only after securing an inside edge, though"
he's up off his feet again to handle the extra bounce of Bumrah. Dabs towards point
gets behind it and defends to the off side
plays inside the line - he was certainly trying to play the ball though - as it zips past the shoulder of the bat and through to Dhoni
"lovely drive from Powell, inching forward and not over-hitting the ball, which Bhuvneshwar pitches up outside off"
width on offer and Hemraj slices it in front of point. Spotted the short ball coming a mile away and took advantage of it beautifully
tightens his line immediately and Hemraj employs a defensive bat to deal with a stump-to-stump delivery
"on middle and leg now, Hemraj knocks it down by his feet"
"flicks it off his thighs, but he doesn't quite time it properly. Slots it straight to short midwicket"
"it's there for the pull shot, the ball short and slipping down leg. Hemraj goes for it, but makes no connection"
"fullish delivery on off stump, blocks"
"strikes him on the pad and goes up in appeal, knowing full well he's pitched it outside leg, and might not even have struck him in line. He should be disappointed. As should Powell for not flicking that to the boundary"
'<b>catch</B>' is the cry from the slip cordon as Powell plants an angled bat out to a shortish delivery moving across him. Very close to the outside edge
"looks much better coming on the front foot, driving smoothly to mid-off. Top running between the wickets as well. They look a little nervous, but that's par for the course early in an innings"
"<b>too quick</b>. Hemraj sees width and throws his bat at it, but the good length ball looking for the outside edge just zips past him"
"taps it between point and cover, hoping for a single, but it's not quite there. Good work from India. They're very alert."
"<b>huuuuuge lbw appeal</b>. Umpire Shamsuddin says no, but Bumrah looks certain he has his man and Kohli goes for <b>a review</b>. Not sure it's a good one though. Might have pitched outside leg. It does do good work, catching the left-hander in his crease. That suggests it has too much pace for Hemraj to deal with. He's slow in bringing the bat down to block it. But he'll get away with it because the ball pitches a foot outside leg. <B>India lose their review</b>"
"looks to clear the infield on the off side, but the ball seems to stop on him. That makes driving on the up dangerous, but Powell gets just enough bat on it to beat mid-off on his right"
"slower-ball bouncer, which Hemraj reads off the pitch and swivel-pulls to deep square leg. Replays indicate it's the knuckle ball as well"
"neat little flick to the left of midwicket, Powell waiting for the ball to get to him and playing it right under his eyes"
"on the pads again, but this time Powell is only able to find midwicket. This pitch seems to be a little bit two-paced."
"oooh, the dipping yorker on middle stump. Powell is awake to its threat"
"strikes the back pad again, but Bhuvi knows to do that from over the wicket, the ball originally has to pitch outside leg and he doesn't even go up in appeal"
"wild slog, all across the line, to a ball pitching outside leg and moving across him. Terrible shot from Hemraj. He's put off by the very full length"
"lunges out at a 141 kph delivery outside off, but it doesn't happen quick enough, and as a result he is still on the move when the ball strkes the inside egde and nearly bowls him"
"launches it over cover and gets himself some breathing space. That was a shot brought about by the pressure put on him. The lack of runs. The constant thudding of the ball into his pads. Affter all that, he spots a full an dwide delivery and just throws his bat at it"
"that's better! He pummels a short ball on off stump over long-on, standing tall and swinging through the line. It's risky, but it's also breathtaking"
"<b>eeeeeeeepic catch from Dhoni</B>. The moment the ball hits the top edge, he starts racing towards the backward square leg boundary, tracking it over his shoulder and even putting in a full-length dive. Is that a statement to the selectors? He doesn't really dive nowaways but a day after he's dropped from the T20 team, he pulls out all the stops. Looks 10 years younger as he hunts the ball down and gets India their first wicket. Top bouncer from Bumrah too, climbing up towards Hemraj's throat, giving him no room. He looks like a batsman who doesn't trust his defence and so will always go for the riskier option to get out of trouble. In this case, that is the hook shot"
139 kph and it kicks up off the pitch as well. Powell is surprised by that as he pokes and misses outside off.
sliding into the pads and Hope sends it scurrying away to the man at long leg
<b>inside edge</b> as Powell steps forward to defend a back of a length delivery outside off.
"on the pads again, he flicks it down to long leg"
defends a back of a length delivery towards point
gets the ball to dart in off the seam and Hope is right behind it.
"angled bat, in the hope of picking up a single behind point, but he doesn't place it quite well enough"
"<b>beats him</b> with his first ball of the match. In the corridor of uncertainty, and an upright seam ensures there is some deviation off the pitch. Powell is stuck in his crease as he pushes his bat out"
launches it over deep midwicket!  He doesn't look like he has the pace to be bowling that short. This one's only 128 kph. Powell actually pulls off the front foot and it is <b>gloooooooorious</b>!
pitches it up now and Powell drives towards extra cover
thuds into the middle of the bat as he hits a good length outside off.
"swivels in his crease and helps the short ball, coming into him, away to the square leg boundary. Splendid batting. Bowler makes a mistake, you capitalise. That's basic. And beautiful."
"shortish on middle, Powell knocks it to mid-on"
"<b>ripper</b>! Play that, Bumrah says. Powell tries. He tries so hard, but all he can do is get squared up and nick off to first slip. A 145 kph snorther from India's spearhead. It pitches on and around leg stump. Then moves away off the seam. That puts the left-hander in an awkward spot, because he has no choice but to defend this delivery. Phew. That's basically the rudest wake up call ever. Rohit takes a superb grab too, moving quickly to his right, which is usually the wrong side for a first slipper, and taking it around chest-height."
"fullish on middle and leg, pushes it to mid-on"
drives a full delivery on off stump over to mid-on
"goes wide of the crease to further arm the ball that he <b>straightens off the seam</b>. Hope knows that plan and so he plays with soft hands, ensuring the ball goes down before it goes to Dhawan at second slip"
punches the back of a length delivery away to deep third man
"<b>traps him lbw</b> but Samuels goes for a review. This appears to nip in off the seam and it beats the inside edge to strike him on the knee-roll. Samuels is also on his toes, although he is right in line with middle stump. That may have prompted umpire Wilson to give him out but DRS says the ball would be missing the stumps altogether. <b>Great review from WI</b>"
rises up off his toes to blunt the short of a length delivery outside off
works it off his hips to deep backward square leg
"stands up tall and slams the ball through the covers. Exquisite cricket from a man who doesn't know how good he is according to his coach. Picks up the short ball early, gets in position to punch it through the covers with a vertical bat and never at any point does he overhit"
"stops on him, does this full-length delivery, and as a result Hope rolls his wrists as he tries to drive on the up, solely to keep the ball down before it reaches cover"
"back of a length and outside off, taps it towards point"
"beats him on the outside edge as he goes searching for a better length, closer to the batsman. That's where he should be. That's where his left-arm angle is most dangerous"
"full and flat on leg stump, comes forward and smothers the turn"
"back of a length, spinning away on off, shifts back and punches to cover"
"full on middle and leg, gets forward and drives to long-off"

taps a length ball through the covers for one
"pitched up outside off, opens up at the sight of width and slams it hard through the covers"

"pitched up on middle, gets forward and pushes it back"
"full on leg, hammers a drive down to long-off"
comes down the track and pushes it out to long-off
"short and straightening around off, makes room and cuts through cover"
"was there an edge? Definite noise, and yes, Samuels walks off. A brute of a short delivery from Khaleel, very straight and tight, absolutely tucks him up and pushes him back, grazes the glove as Samuels tries to get on top of it and Dhoni gets down in front to snaffle a low catch. And look at Khaleel take off with arms spread wide. This wicket clearly means something to him"
"short of good length, nips in off the seam and gets an inside edge that <b>just misses the stumps</b>"
"just back of a length, angled into off, Hope jumps up and keeps it down into the on side"
"shot, beautiful from Hope. Just gets the foot forward and easily punches a length ball off the front foot, neatly splitting the field in the extra cover region"
gets on top of a short ball and drops it wide of the slip cordon
"<b>just past mid-on</b>. Fails to get on top of a short one, ends up having to fetch it from well outside off and drag it into the leg side"
"full on middle and off, clipped off the pads to deep midwicket"
"flat and fuller outside off, defended off the front foot"
lets it spin in from outside off and backs away and cuts to cover
"back of a length, spins into middle this time, makes room and drags it to long-on"
"full, gets forward and blocks with the turn into the off side"
gets on in his arc and gets down on one knee to pick it up from a middle stump line and heave it over deep midwicket with a big slog
"full on off, driven to long-off"
"pitched up on middle and leg, gets down and sweeps behind square"
"gets a fuller one on middle, swept fine"

attempts a sweep with no room and the ball lobs up off the glove after pitching outside leg
"slants a fuller one across on middle and off, crunches a drive to cover"
clips a fuller one to square leg
"full on middle and leg, comes forward and pushes it out to the right of sweeper cover"

now he comes down the track and drills this fuller one straight between long-on and long-off
turns a fuller one away into the on side
shifts back and tucks a length ball to deep square leg
"tossed up outside off, squeezed out to cover"
"flighted and dipping outside off, pushes to cover off the front foot"
rocks back and whips this back of a length ball against the angle to deep midwicket
"turn and bounce from a shortish length outside off, moves away and cuts through point to beat the sweeper sprinting to his right"

nudges a leg-side length ball towards fine leg
gets some disconcerting bounce outside off and sways away and cuts to point
comes forward and blocks a fuller ball
pushed to long-on off the front foot
"poor delivery, very full and on the pads, gets down on one knee and whips it off the pads over deep backward square leg. Great swivelling motion and lots of power"
comes forward and drives this fuller one to long-off
"looped up on middle, pushed back past the left of the bowler off the front foot"
"Kuldeep lets slip a full toss and Hetmyer is too good to miss out on those, swats it over cow corner"
gets a fuller one on middle and off that's driven to cover
"has there been a stumping here? Dhoni quietly raises one hand up and the umpires go upstairs, but he should be fine here. Hetmyer gets down for a big slog from outside off. Has the backfoot come off? Nope. But, hang on. It may not be in the air but it seems to be on the line. The second angle seems to further confirm this. India celebrate. We should have the red letters OUT.. Yup, off he goes. Nicely done by Kuldeep, pitching it up and inviting him to go big but taking it away from him with his angle"
"back of a length, spinning into off, blocked down the pitch off the backfoot"
"<b>ooh, narrowly misses off!</b> Looped up across off and just goes on with the arm to beat the outside edge"
"again beats him smartly with a slider that deceptively goes on, refusing to turn. Dhoni whips the bails off but his foot's in the crease"
waits on the back of a length delivery and dabs it towards point
"thump! That ball sounds so sweet when it flies off Hope's bat. And he doesn't look half bad too, with that high-elbow after a back foot push through the covers"
"full and outside off, he presses forward to defend"
"quick single - and he just about makes it, beating Rayudu's throw from point. It's cool that West Indies are looking for runs like these, and Powell plants the ball in front of point to enable the endeavour. Yuck. Did I really type that. That sound so formal..."
works it away into the midwicket region...
"<b>kicks up off the pitch</b> and forces Hope to not only abandon his, well, hope to punch through the covers but also to yank the bottom hand off. Good reactions to keep the ball down"
"half-volley outside off, Powell hits it along the ground to long-off"
"pulls his length back and drags the right-hander across his off stump with his drift. Then the ball pitches and turns sharply into Hope, securing his inside edge"
another lovely lunge forward to get as close to the pitch of the ball as he could and then blocks
drills it to long-off
"goes back to block a googly, that he seems to read off the pitch. The slow pace of Kuldeep helps the batsman decipher him better. Especially when he pitches it short"
defends solidly on off stump
spears a drive to sweeper cover as Khaleel hits a full length outside off
"the angle from round the wicket helps him cut the ball into the right-hander, and here, the ball slips under the bat as well, with Powell looking to cut a ball that doesn't have enough room to be doing so"
"shortish on middle, Powell defends into the leg side"
"thick outside edge, with Powell looking to launch the bowler over his head, and instead settling for a couple to deep third man"
"<b>sharp bouncer</b>! He was pummeled every time he went after that length, but here, he gives it everything, hitting the deck on middle stump, getting the ball to follow the right-hander and whoosh past his left ear. Futile pull shot from Powell"
"fullish and outside off, he defends with an open face"
excellent footwork from Hope as he shifts back to nudge the short ball off middle stump to deep square leg
"goes around the wicket and beats the outside edge! That's special. And of course, it's the googly as well, spinning away from the angle after drawing the batsman forward to defend"
"drops it short this time, allowing Powell to read the turn off the pitch and cut to point"
"huge ungainly heave in the leg side, against the turn. And not only is he beaten by the turn, he's also done in by the pace. The slow, delicious pace of Kuldeep. The ball seems to strike the outside edge of the very bottom of the bat - clear signs he's too early into the shot - and it hangs in the air, to the right of Dhoni. Waiting to be pouched. And <B>Rohit, at first slip, dives across in spectacular fashion and holds on to a stunner</b>! What reactions from India's vice-captain!"
"loops it up on off stump, Holder nudges it to mid-on"
"full and outside off, drives towards mid-off"
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
"full on off stump, he drives smoothly but straight to mid-on"
rocks back and cuts to deep point
flays the short and wide delivery out to third man
opens the face and runs it down to third man
"lovely, free-flowing swing of the bat as Holder glides a back of a length delivery to point"
"glorious! He knows there is no danger in driving this half-volley through point. Because who cares how the ball turns if he can get to the pitch of it. After that, it is all a matter of placement"
knocks it down to long-on
"stays back, even though the ball is fairly full, and defends in front of middle stump"
"that's Holder's ploy then. Play the wristspinner from the crease, hoping to read him off the pitch. But that doesn't work quite well when Kuldeep starts bowling full. As is the case here. He only just about nudges it behind square leg"
presses forward to block outside off
"rocks back, seeing the flatter trajectory, and works it through midwicket"
"plenty of pace from Bumrah, and that little bit of seam movement away as well. All of it troubles even Hope, who gets squared up and lets a leading edge wander to point"
"leans into a pristine cover drive, the front foot near the pitch of the full ball and a straight bat giving him maximum control of the shot"
"full and outside off, jabs it to the sweeper cover"
firm punch off the back foot through the covers. His footwork - the quickness and the decisiveness of it - all through the innings has been special. Tells you he's picking the length of the ball early and everything else is happening off muscle memory
surprises him with a bouncer and Holder gets hit on the front of the helmet. That takes some doing. The WI captain is six foot seven inches tall. And he's not often beaten for pace either
steers a back of a length delivery outside off to short cover
"full and outside off, he drives back at the bowler"
pushes him back with a quicker and flatter delivery. Hope has a straight-bat response waiting
"looks for a single through midwicket, but the dip on the ball foils those plans and he's struck on the pads."
"<b>lightning quick at taking the bails off</b>. Dhni is insane behind the stump,s but Hope is aware of the threat and never lets the back foot stray. Sure, he's beaten by the big-turning legbreak. But he does everything else right"
"full and flat on off stump, Hope is forward to block"
"<b>appeal for lbw</b> and it looks adjacent too. But umpire Shamsuddin shakes his head. It's the legbreak again, drifting in from Chahal, and that is what does Hope in. He ends up playing outside the line, gets truck on the pad. <b>India don't have reviews</b> and ball-tracking says it would have been umpire's call on hitting the stumps"
"oh, that is special. Holder doesn't do any more than extend his defence and his timing, and this fast outfield, takes care of the reste"
"goes on the up again, but this time he finds mid-off"
pokes it to mid-on
"back of a length and outside off, pats it to extra cover"
blocks the good length ball on and around off stump
uses his wrists to drag a short ball on off stump over to short midwicket
"goes back seeing the flatter trajectory - and that's a mistake because the length isn't all that short. Even so, Hope is in such good form that he can adjust and pull the ball to long-on"
"eases forward, playing the ball under his eyes on leg stump, and picking up a single at square leg"
"lovely drift into middle stump, Holder keeps it out"
"slows it down, and pulls his length back as well. But the key here is placing it wide of off stump, tempting Holder into a big shot. The WI captain only just realises the danger and then checks his shot. Single through cover"
goes back to defend a much quicker delivery on off stump
"tosses it up on off stump, he defends"
"<b>in the air, and Bumrah misses it.</b> Very tough chance, Bumrah had to judge it well, nearly gets his hands around it after running back from mid-on but the ball drops just in front. Short of a length from Bhuvneshwar, Holder doesn't get hold of his shot as he tries to heave it over"
punches a length ball to mid-on
tries to force a pull with the angle and gets an under edge to deep fine
"short of a length, backs away and the bowler follows him to narrowly beat the inside edge"
"good length outside off, punched to cover"
"slower length ball, picked up by Holder as he waits and slaps it past cover, deep point gets around it"
"pitched up on off, driven to cover"
"full on middle and leg, gets opened up as he pushes out to point"
"full on leg stump, pushed to long-on"

"short of a length outside off, opens the face late for a single"
"short ball, take that Khaleel, Holder gets on top of it and swats a pull through midwicket"
"short of good length outside off, punched to point"
pokes at a length ball late to dab it down off the outside edge to third man
"short outside off, crunched to deep point after getting on top of it. <b>Fifty for Hope</b>. Very measured knock"
"pitched up on middle, clipped to midwicket"
picks the line early and gets down to guide a sweep very fine
shuffles across and dabs a length ball into the on side
gets down for another sweep very fine and gets nothing more than a glove to the left of Dhoni
turns this away with the turn behind square on the leg side
"short of a length, spins away, punched to long-off"
"back of a length outside off, opens the face to third man"
"that's a nice help-yourself from Khaleel. Runs in from around the wicket, bangs it in after angling it into the batsman. But it's slower and in the slot for Holder who picks it up, waits and heaves it muscularly over deep midwicket"
pinches a single to long-off off a fuller one
"full again, blocked into the covers again"
"short of a length, angling in late, swats at it and misses"
"back of a length, slower ball, keeps very low, he stays back because of the length but manages to knock it to mid-on"
"floated up on middle, pushed down the ground"
"leg side fuller ball, finds short fine with the sweep"
"<b>dropped</b>. Pitched up on off, shovelled straight back at the bowler, and the ball grazes Kuldeep's hand. Was that a catch? Ah, yes, missed chance, seems like"
pinches a single down to long-off
shifts back and tucks this to square leg
"full on leg, turned away to square leg"
"full outside off, slaps to mid-off for a quick one. Bumrah has a shy at the stumps and concedes an overthrow"
"shortish outside off, tries to get on top of it and force a slap but chips it towards mid-off on the bounce"
tucks a length ball to midwicket
"back of a length, angled in at off, opens the face to third man"
turns a fuller one away off the pads to midwicket. Rohit has a shy at the non-striker's end with the batsmen having thought of a run. Another overthrow with no one backing up
that's been brutally thumped back. Overpitched in his arc and Hope shovels it straight over. Bang into the sightscreen
""
"as effortless a six as any you'd see. Again, too full, on leg stump, Holder clears the front leg, and thumps it over wid elong-on"
"fuller around off, pushed down the ground to long-off"
"gets too ambitious and has a wild swing at a wide slider, gets beaten as he loses shape"
stays back and punches this back to Kuldeep
"India belt out an appeal for lbw, Shamshuddin is unmoved. Comes forward and turns in to hit him in front of middle and off after pitching outside off. Might've turned past the stumps. No reviews left"
tucked through square leg
"back of a length at leg stump, knocks it towards mid-on"
"short, bit of width, slapped to the sweeper at cover"
chips tamely to long-off. Holder gets too ambitious and tries to heave this back of a length delivery over the in-field. Perhaps didn't get behind ti enough as he can only find the toe end of the bat
"short of a length on middle, tucked behind square"
"oh, beautifully played. Hope's played some glorious drives today, and this is as good as any he's played. A one-handed push off the front foot, with his weight right behind it, and neatly picking the gap through extra cover"
rides the bounce and drops it to backward point with soft hands and an open face
"extra bounce from Kuldeep, that may be what turned the lbw against him as Hope presses forward to defend and gets hit on the pad"
nudged away to square leg for one
"loops it into off, driven to long-off"
gets the foot across and turns it away into the on side
"pitches one up across his off-stump, and Hope sends a drive crashing through the covers"
comes forward and dabs it to cover for a quick one
"pulls the bottom hand off to slot the ball through square leg. The intention is to play it softly enough to get two, but Dhawan rushes in off the boundary to prevent it"
"looks for the pull shot - and it's there for it too, short and on leg stump. Problem is, it's a slower ball and Allen ends up wearing it"
"another slower ball, this time fuller in length. Allen turns it to midwicket"
exploits the angle of the left-armer going across him and cuts the ball to the third man boundary. Very intentional. Very clever
cramps him on off stump. Allen defends the short ball
"he's wise to the slower ball plan now. Delays his block well enough to make good contact, but he can't hit the ball any further than the adjacent pitch on the leg side"
"rocks back, making room so he can take full toll of the short ball, But as well as he cuts the ball, it goes close enough to Rohit at point that he can stop it with a dive to his right"
"loops it up on leg stump, Hope tries to flick it away, but the ball keeps drifting past his reach. In the edge, they settle for a leg bye to long leg"
"goes for the big one - India would have been hoping he would and Allen doesn't disappoint. The ball goes straight up, because he isn't close enough to it to slog against the turn. And Pant is waiting at long-on to complete an artfully crafted dismissal. It's trademark Chahal really. Toss the ball up, let the big-hitter go for the big hit across the line, then smile for the cameras"
"tosses it up on off stump, defends"
"defends it again, in line with the stumps"
"knocks it down to long-on and moves into the nineties. More importantly, he retains strike"
"full on off stump, defends in front of point and picks up the single on offer"
"back of a length on off stump, defends into the covers"
picks the change of pace well and nudges it through square leg
"goes off the splice of the bat as Hope tries to drive on the up. But the older ball sticks in the pitch, comes off slower than the batsman expects and luckily for him, ends up where no fielders are behind point"
smacks the short ball on and around off stump to the sweeper
slices it to the right of point
"hurtles in at the stumps, and Hope looks a little awkward as he tries to protect them. In the end, the ball, which is straightening off the angle, takes the outside edge and wanders to third man"
"full on off stump, he drills it to mid-off"
goes back to block a good length ball between the non-striker and the stumps
"fuller and outside off, steers it to third man"
"yorker! Through him! And those stumps are a mess! Pune roars as the No. 1 ranked bowler in the world takes out the last remaining threat in the opposition. Hope couldn't do anything about it. How could he, when it keeps tailing in so sharply. And late. The bat comes down in a last ditch effort but by then the stumps are rattled. Splendid innings from Hope. He was especially good against spin today, and for a strokemaker like that to bat so freely on a slow pitch, is something special"
"looks for another yorker, but the fast bowler in Kemar Roach warns him of the threat and he keeps it out"
"quicker delivery, speared into the pads. Nurse nearly falls over himself as he tries to deal with it"
misses out as he gets a short and wide delivery and gets beaten in the end
"launches it over deep midwicket. Mighty slog sweep from Nurse, getting into the shot the moment he spots Chahal giving the ball a little air on middle stump"
"this time he's ready and waiting for the short ball, rocking back deep in his crease and hammering it through point. Great power!"
blocks it into the covers for a single
finishes his spell with a slow legbreak on leg stump. Roach defends it rather gingerly
"drives to extra cover and goes sprinting. Pant has enough time to take aim and throw down the stumps at the non-strikers', but he misses by inches!"
knocks it down in front of point and gets across to the other end. Good work from Roach
"steps out of his crease and ends up yorking himself. Still, he has the skill to place the ball wide of extra cover and secure the single"
strikes him on the pad as he goes for the yorker again. Roach's flick shot comes in second best. A distant second best
"bouncer - and it's a good one, rising up towards the throat of the batsman, and if he cares to pull it, he has to then drag it from outside off. Roach isn't keen on the option and sways away"
blocks to point
"slips down the leg side, even though the length is spot on. Right in that annoying blockhole"
shows his stumps while knocking the good length ball in line with them down to long-on
opens the face to find a single to the left of cover. West Indies are clearly trying to bat out the overs
heaves a length ball on middle stump away to long leg
gets it to come in off the seam - only slightly - and Roach gets an inside edge onto pad
flicks the fuller ball on middle and off down to long leg
thumps it over long-on! Roach gets the change to get under the ball. So he clears his front leg and unleashes a full swing of that big bat
pitches it up a bit more and cramps Roach for room. Gets the pleasure of watching him twist his body like a pretzel
"the low full toss tails into the right-hander, at high pace. Nurse puts it over to long-on"
"113kph, pitched-up slower ball outside off. Roach is completely deceived by it"
"tries to squeeze a full and wide delivery through point, but no luck"
"142kph, pin-point yorker again - and it tails into the right-hander, into those stumps. Roach just about digs it out. Btw, that ball seems to have done damage to Roach's bat. He's going to need a replacement"
"back of a length on middle and leg, Roach dabs it towards cover"
wraps things off with - you guessed it - another yorker. Roach and his stumps stay standing. But they know they're being hunted
mid-off is up and Bhuvi tags his slower ball with a little too much width. Nurse spots the bowler's mistake and makes him pay with a sensational slap over long-off
"very clever! This is by no means a bad ball, but Nurse gets down low with the wide yorker, opens the face and splits the gap between short third man and point. Top-class, level-headed batting"
strays a little too far outside off in an effort to prevent Nurse's big hits
"muscles it past cover! This is pure, unadulterated torture on the cricket ball. There's width on it and Nurse just belts it away off the front foot"
that's where he needs to be. At the base and in line with the stumps. And even the big-hitting Nurse can only work out a single to long-on
"another yorker, on off stump. He blocks it to extra cover"
"that is insane! The ball is a low full toss on off stump. But Nurse steps out, even as he is moving across his stumps, waits for a second, and then whips it to the backward square leg boundary. <B>That's 21 runs off the over</b>"
"slants a full delivery into the pads, Roach swings at it, but only gets a leg bye to third man. <b>Brings up the fifty partnership for the ninth wicket</b>, in only 35 balls"
flicks it to long-on
<B>dropped</b> by Bhuvi at long leg. Granted he needs to make a lot of ground running to his left at long leg. And in the end he has to dive too. But the ball slips through his hands. Roach benefits despite being surprised by a bouncer that kept following him
"swings and misses, but Nurse is alert to the chance of a bye. That's great cricket"
"lbw in front of middle, but Nurse goes for a review. More out of hope than anything because he has moved well across his stumps and this is a perfect yorker from Bumrah too. Ball-tracking shows three reds and Shamsuddin's decision stands"
"full and outside off, he swings and misses, so does Bumrah, on a five-wicket haul on his return to ODIs."
"loads up a cut shot, but he finds point. Plenty of width, but perhaps a little more bounce than he bargained for"
gets forward and shoulders arms to a good length ball outside off
"pristine! This is why he was picked in the Test squad for Australia. For his back foot play. And boy, when he punches through the covers, it doesn't even matter how many runs he gets. Just the shot is enough to send people to rapture"
pitches it up outside off and that ensures Rohit remains circumspect. Lets it go and gets ready for more
"short of a length and angled into off stump, Rohit plays it nice and close to his body"
"corrects his line, going straighter to cramp Rohit. The batsman taps it down the pitch"
goes back and blocks a shortish delivery on middle
"good tight lines from Holder, refusing to give Dhawan the room he loves so much. As a result, the left-hander can only defend from the crease"
nudges it off his pads to long leg.
"oh, he makes it look so ridiculously easy. Sure it's a half-volley. Sure it's asking to be hit. But Rohit treats it so sweetly. Sorry, love. You just have to go he says as he times the ball through cover point"
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
"<b>ripper! Absolute ripper!</b> There is precious little Rohit can do. It's pitched up, but not so much that it is a half-volley and the batsman can easily push forward for the drive. It's in that inbetween length that makes them freeze in the crease. And Holder's skill is such that he makes the ball swing away as well. And that's enough to beat the outside edge and crash into middle stump. What a sight. What a glorious sight for the WI captain, who for some reason, is always a target for everyone's criticism. This man is pure gold, people. Believe it"
"good length on off stump, defends it"
goes for the drive on the up and places it just to the right of mid-off
"good length and outside off, Kohli lets it go"

"back of a length and outside off, ignores it again."
slips down the leg side. Dhawan will feel annoyed he doesn't get any bat to it
lets the back of a length ball come real close and then slices it to point
"not the best place to bowl, even to Dhawan, who had to work on his leg side game. But now it's pretty good and he flicks the ball to the square leg boundary with considerable ease"
"<b>squares him up</b> with a ball that hits the seam and decks away. Might have held in the pitch a bit too, with Dhawan early into his clip through midwicket"
"turns it to the left of mid-on, with soft hands, and pinches a single. Good batting from Dhawan"
on the pads and that's far too easy for Kohli  Gets off the mark with a simple leg glance. And it runs away so fine too
"good length ball on and around off stump, Kohli knocks it down. No fuss"
"tight on middle, Dhawan blocks. West Indies are doing well against the left-hander, keeping it in line with the stumps, not allowing him to get away with easy shots through the off side."
"oh wait, there it is. The release. It's only a shade outside off, but Dhawan is so well practiced in picking those gaps. In staying leg side of the ball and crunching it through the covers"
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
he's onto the flick a little too early and the back of a length delivery lobs off the pad into where silly point might be (in a bygone era)
"slower ball, and even Kohli is playing a little too early, the bat leading his body. The alarm bells ring early enough though and he pulls the bottom hand off, allowing the full ball outside off to drop before it reaches midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, keeps it out"
"good length on off stump, blocks it"
"outstanding shot! And it's made by the footwork. A long, confident push forward to get him close to the fuller delivery. (not half-volley, mind you) and then it's all a matter of balance at the crease and the timing he gets playing with a straight bat"
<b>beats him</b> with an insane delivery cutting back in off the pitch. Even Kohli is surprised as he comes forward to block and gets done in on the inside edge
"angled into his body, and he picks it away to long leg"
pushes it to long-on
"thinks about paying this back of a length delivery on fourth or fifth stump, but then hoists his bat high over his head"

"back of a length, jumps back and blocks into the off side"
"extremely full on leg stump, pushed out to mid-on"
"room, so much of it outside off, Dhawan opens up and slaps it through extra cover with disdain. Brings up the <b>fifty of the partnership</b>"
"short outside off, again a world of room outside off, this is some tripe, another help-yourself for Dhawan who crashes it through the covers"
"now he bowls it too full, just his good fortune that Dhawan finds mid-off with his drive"

"too much room and too short again, another easy cut to sweeper cover"
"pitched up on off, driven to mid-off"
"leg-side length ball, Kohli glances it very late, edges onto the pad and runs down to fine leg"
"there's really no challenge anymore. If it's not leg side, it's off side; if it'snot short, it's full. This one's a wide fuller ball and Kohli eases into a straight drive to the right of mid-off"

"Dhawan tries to force the pace and gets pinned in front. The boundaries had dried up, and knowing Dhawan's temperament, you could see this coming.

drives it sweetly to long-off
rocks back and slaps the shortish delivery on off stump to the sweeper cover
"another fluent drive, to the left of the bowler"

"spots the shot ball early, makes room and launches it over to deep midwicket"

turns it into the vacant midwicket region

"a little turn on middle, Rayudu opens the face to handle it, but point is on hand to stop the single"

spins so sharply that Rayudu is beaten while trying to go for a leg glance
eases it down the ground to long-on and raises India's hundred

good stride forward to drag a full delivery outside off through to deep midwicket
goes back in his crease to thump the shortish delivery outside off to mid-off
swats a flatter delivery on off stump through midwicket
"lovely batting. He waits and waits - on the front foot, which is in tune with the tossed up ball - until it turns in and then angles the face of his defensive bat to pick up a single at third man. West Indies are trying to build pressure with their spinners, and both of them are holding a good line and length. But India keep managing to rotate strike"
"<b>beats him</b> as he searches for a dab to third man, pushing at the ball"
"<b>leading edge</b> as Kohli looks to flick the ball on leg stump, without reading the pitch of it, and yet he gets two runs because of his supreme fitness"
"short and outside off, slams it to sweeper cover"
drives straight back to the bowler
"full and outside off, he drives to long-off"
"lovely placement! It's one thing to hit over the top, but quite another to ensure that it hits an area that is completely unmanned. Kohli goes forward and whirls his wrists so that he sends the ball soaring over wide long-on."
"full and outside off, pushes it back to the bowler"
slips down leg - and it's short too - and that means Rayudu has a free hit. Gets down on one knee and pulls the ball to the right of short fine leg
"a masterclass against spin! The way these two kept singles was awesome on its own. But here, Rayudu runs down the track, gets to the pitch of a good length ball outside off and creams it over extra cover."
"goes round the wicket, and Rayudu simply pushes it down to long-off. He knows India have more than enough in this over"
"nudges to midwicket, where a misfield from Hetmyer allows a single"
"goes back, deceived by the flatter trajectory of the full length ball, but by keeping himself low, he's able to defend the ball and pinch a single at cover"

"taps it to long-on, a roll of the wrists keeping the ball down"
carves the full and wide delivery to sweeper cover
"charges out of his crease, making room to blast the ball over the off side. But Allen's angle into the right-hander ensures he only gets a inside edge. Good bowling again from the debutant"

"100kph, very very quick on off stump, but KOhli's ready for it, whipping it down to long-on"
gets up off his toes and tickles the ball off his chest and through square leg
"full on leg stump, works it through midwicket"
opens the face and dabs the shortish delivery outside off to point
"plays on! So the extra pace works. West Indies' plan works. Rayudu was looking so comfy against spin. But here, with McCoy, and his <b>steepling bounce</b>, he shifts on the back foot, tries to block it behind square on the off side, but only ends up breaking his own stumps"
"<b>dropped</b> but this really had to stick. And Hetmyer is flying, he's parallel with the ground when he tries to grab hold of the ball with his left hand. Sheesh. This is so tough, but he believes he should have caught it, hits the ground in disgust. Pant, meanwhile, survives after playing a rasping cut shot, but not quite placing it well enough"

"full on off stump, defends"

"picks the slower ball, adjusts his backlift, and neatly turns it away from middle stump to deep square leg"
yanks the bottom hand off as he drives on the up through the covers
"lets the shortish delivery come to him outside off and taps it on top of the bounce to third man. Kohli's done the recalibrating. He's back to playing anchor, prepared to play through to the end of the game"
"carves it over the mid-off, and although he is reaching out in front of his body, and is taking a risk in trying to clear the infield, he makes solid enough connection - and he picks an area of the ground where there aren't deep fielders"
"bouncer, which Pant ignores"
"flirts with a back of a length delivery outside off and is beaten. Actually, check that, he's lucky not to nick off"
"powerful hit through midwicket. He picks up the slower ball, waits until it's ripe to be pulled away and executes his shot to perfection"
stands up tall and crunches a shortish delivery to long-on
"gorgeous hit! And it's riskless too. Presses forward to the length ball and smacks it straight over Allen's head. Boy, Pant has outstanding reach when he decides to go over the top"
"works it towards short fine leg, Kohli thinks there's a single, but Pant says no and sends his captain diving back into his crease."
works a short ball off his hips to deep square leg
"looks for the inside out cover drive, but Allen gets the ball to dip just late enough that the Indian captain has to check his shot"
<B>uppish</B> but the late cut falls short of third man inside the circle. A bit of extra bounce surprises Kohli.

"tosses it up on middle, Pant defends"
hard-handed push to long-on
works the flatter delivery off his pads to square leg
"<b>Kohli could have been run-out</b>. He shifts back and neatly slots the ball to square leg and is again looking for that quick single. However, there might have been a little hesitation between the two batsmen, and had Nurse picked up the throw from Allen and broken the stumps, India's captain would have been out"
carves it through the covers - too short and for a set batsman that's just an invitation.
turns it through wide mid-on
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
ticks it behind square leg
"shortish and outside off, chops it to short third man"
stays put in his crease and thumps the ball to short cover
"<b>huuuge appeal for a caught behind</B> but umpire Shamsuddin is unmoved and so West INdies go for a review. The excitement is the result of a ball slipping down leg and Pant shaping to sweep, while standing up. It's a great credit to Hope that he collect the ball, whilst being blinded by the batsman. But we'll need UltraEdge to confirm this call. And it says there's a feather as the ball passes glove.  Another great review by West Indies."
"<b>extra bounce</b> but Dhoni deals with it well, pushing back away from the ball and knocking it down with a straight(ish) bat through the covers"

"full and fast on off stump, Dhoni stays put in his crease and blocks it well"
tickles it around the corner to square leg

"fairly risky, sliding a ball - a very quick ball - on middle stump to short third man."
"steps down the pitch to try and open up a gap at midwicket, but no luck"
tosses it up outside off - and he gets some lovely drift too. Dhoni defends with a big stride
smacks it behind point and gets a couple of runs for his cut shot
"that's all there is to scoring boundaries. Pick the length earliy. Know where the field is. And manipulate the heck out of it. Here, Roach deals out a bouncer outside off and Kohli just ramps it to the third man boundary, well to the left of the fielder in the deep"
"short and outside off, he hammers it to point and so powerful is the shot that Allen misfields. <b>Into the nineties</b>"
"<b>keeps low</b> as Dhoni, moving back and across to face it, chops to cover"
gets a thick outside edge as Roach gets a fuller delivery to straighten off the angle while targeting off stump.
"full and outside off, he and his wrists work it back to the bowler"
opens the face and runs the back of a length delivery to deep third man
"gets off his toes to deal with Holder's extra bounce. And deals with it well, except for the flick to midwicket finding the fielder"
"short and outside off, he pulls to deep square leg"
works the short ball off his hips behind square leg
waits on the back of a length delivery to arrive and then gently glides it to deep third man
"<b>caught behind</b>! Excellent bowling from Holder. That innate ability he has to get bounce off any pitch has Dhoni falling rather tamely. He's looking to ease the ball square on the off side, but  the ball kicks up more than he expects and he gets a good chunk through to the keeper. West Indies have the game in the balance again, right on the stroke of drinks"
"intimidates him with a short ball, angled over Bhuvneshwar's shoulder as he ducks"
gets the foot across and taps this to point
"too full, enough room outside off, and a brute of a pick-up shot from the Indian captain, just shovels it straight past towards the sightscreen"

"short of good length on off, defended to point"
"short ball, pushes him back but Bhuvi jumps and drops it into the on side as they cross over for a quick one"
"is that it? Nope, not quiet. Swivels and pulls a short ball but deep square leg sprints to his right to get around it"
"there it is! Arches out of a short ball and gently pulls to deep backward square leg. Muted celebration from the captain. But he's created history: <b>first Indian to score three successive ODI tons, tenth overall</b>"

"short of good length, angled in, worked away to fine leg"
"full toss, fails to capitalise on it as he drives one-handed to mid-off"
holes out to sweeper cover. Pressure mounting on India now. Bhuvneshwar throws his hands at the sight of width and slaps it over the in-field. But nowhere enough meat on it to take it past the fielder in the deep
"chips a fuller one in the air, gets a leading edge as he closes the face trying to flick it off the pads, one-bounce to long-on"
"full outside off, flicked from outside off to midwicket. Turns the strike over to Kohli. That's all he needs to do"
"back of a length, tucked with the inward angle to square leg"
"short ball, climbing but well away from him and he keeps the bat inside the line"
opens up at the sight of width and slaps it to long-off
""
"bowled him! That should be the game. Kohli goes big, across the line. Looks for a big pull but the ball was drifting into him, and as a result, gets tucked up. Misses the ball altogether as it goes straight through and crashes into middle. Kohli had to take a chance against Samuels, and so he did. And he pays for it with his wicket. Top innings from the captain"
"back of a length, spinning in, punched to long-on"
"full on the pads, flicked to square leg"
gets some room and he opens up and cuts to backward point
<b>run out chance missed</b>. Kuldeep cuts to the left of point. Chahal takes off for a run. Kuldeep is not interested at all. The bowler fails to gather the throw and that's the only thing that could've saved him here

"pulls a short ball, but doesn't get hold of it at all, goes along the ground to deep midwicket"
"angles a shortish ball into him, and Chahal stays legside of it and blocks"
the short ball does it against Chahal. He isn't comfortable against that length at all. Swings almost instinctively at this one and gets a top-edge that deep fine leg settles under

stays back and defends this in front of middle and leg
gets forward and plays half-heartedly as the ball goes past the edge

turns a full toss away to square leg
"back of a length, waits and opens the face through backward point"
"very full into the pads, drilled down wide of long-on"
ramps a short one over to third man
nicely one. Backs away to manufacture room against Samuels' stifling angles and cuts off the outside edge to third man. Beats the fielder chasing it down
"gets down to sweep and gets rapped on the pad. In front of middle and off, it seems. Give, but Kuldeep reviews. Was there bat on it? Or glove? A bit of glove, as snicko confirms. Pings him on the wristband. Should be overturned, and is"
"back of a length outside off, punched to sweeper cover"
"pitched up outside off, slogged to deep midwicket"
"short and wide, cut to sweeper cover"
that's another one gone. Or so it seems. Khaleel walks off. Drags the backfoot out as he swings wildly across and makes no contact. Easy stumping for Hope
"sort outside off, pulled without any timing to midwicket"
"fullish on middle stump, looks for the single to long-on but midwicket moves quickly to intercept"
"slower ball, angling into leg stump. He saw Kuldeep looking to make himself room and followed him smartly. Blocked back to the bowler"
"back of a length, angling down leg. Probably second-guessed Kuldeep's intentions there. He didn't try to make room on this occasion"
"full on off stump, clipped to long-on"
"very full, angling into off stump, defended into the on side"
"length ball, looks like the legcutter. Pitches a fair way outside off stump and Bumrah chooses to leave it alone"
"comes down the track and pushes to long-off, and refuses the single"
"chips a length ball over the bowler, between long-on and long-off. Again, run not taken"
"short, backs away and cuts to sweeper cover"
that will be all. Bumrah caught at slip. Tries to get cheeky and open the face but the bounce is a little disconcerting and he gets an edge to Holder
