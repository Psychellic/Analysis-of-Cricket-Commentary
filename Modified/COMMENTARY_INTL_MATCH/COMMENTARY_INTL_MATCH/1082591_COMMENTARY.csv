"141 kph delivery to start. Pace, bounce, carry. Short of a length outside off, Warner slaps a cut to cover. That should ease some nerves all around"
"138 kph, full and straight this time, not much swing. Not much movement. But the pace is there. Worked to square leg. Warner wanted one, Dhawan didn't. Still nervy out there with so much noise"
"Warner may not have had a great Test series against India, but he's right at home here, in the format, in this competition. Back of a length delivery outside off, Warner opens the bat face and guides the ball through point. Somehow finds the gap"
"good length outside off, Warner allows the ball to hit the bat, instead of going towards the ball. Hit to cover"
"yikes, wayward. 146 kph though. Drifts down leg. Jadhav, RCB's new keeper, fumbles the collection"
"145 kph, harrying Dhawan for pace. Full on leg, no swing. So when it hits Dhawan's pads, it looks like it's sliding down. It is"
"decent start from both sides. Good length on the thigh pad, Dhawan misses a flick. Off the body towards square leg for a leg bye"
"good length delivery outside off,  a hint of swing. Not much. Dhawan pushes towards mid-off and sets off for a single. A quality run. Intent matters, and adds a run too."
"over mid-off. Sees a full delivery, and lets his hands through the line of the ball. The stroke was accentuated with width. Full and wide outside off, Warner bends his knees and lifts the ball over mid-off. Shot"
"the first no-ball of IPL 10. Full delivery on the pads, Warner misses a flick. Off the pad towards the keeper"
"that's the first six of IPL 10. Back of a length delivery outside off, Warner stays back. Picks the length early and swats a pull very high. But got elevation and distance"
"there's the first wicket of the season. It's all happening. A loose stroke by Warner. Full delivery outside off, there is some swing too. Warner lets his hands go through the line, an error because there is some movement. The ball skews off the outside half and carries to backward point, a reverse-cupped catch. Hard hands."
"full delivery outside off, some swing back in. Dabbed away to gully. Good stuff from Choudhary"
"smashed for four. A good length delivery outside off, Henriques stays in his crease and cracks a cut through point. Too much width from the debutant"
"looking for a yorker. A full toss on middle and leg, worked to backward square leg for a run. Should have been two. There's one run that Sunrisers should have got that they didn't"
"lovely stroke. Back of a length outside off, Henriques scythes a cut towards backward point. Using the pace."
"141 kph, full delivery, close to off stump. Henriques plays it down by his feet."
"lovely stroke. Good length delivery on off, Henriques flicks his wrists and the ball through square leg. Played that discernibly late to get it that fine. A fumble allows the third"
"that's a poor ball. Back of a length down leg, Dhawan works the ball down to fine leg. Lovely stroke."
"really good single. Full delivery outside off, pushed towards cover. Calls 'yeah, yeah, yeah' immediately and gets the run easily"
"nice. Pushed through on middle and leg, blocked"
worked away through midwicket for a run. Just a tad too straight there
"lovely. Flight on off, Dhawan presses forward to defend. A hint of turn too"
worked away through midwicket for a single. Too straight again. But it's good defensive bowling in the Powerplay
"nicely played. Flat delivery outside off, pushed to long-off for a run. Whoa, miscommunication. <strong>Henriques should have been out</strong>. The fielder eases in, and throws the ball to the keeper. Dhawan called yes, Henriques hurries down for the second, and gives up but returns quickly when he sees the throw is to the keeper"
flicked to deep midwicket
"good length delivery outside off, 129 kph, pushed towards cover. An easy run with so many fielders on the ring"
pushed away towards mid-on for a single
"a mow. Dhawan runs down and slaps a length delivery to mid-on. On the bounce. Binny fields, but there's a run"
"goes over the infield. Very intentional. Full delivery outside off, carved over extra cover for a couple"
"that's rubbish. Back of a length down leg, Henriques pulls and finds the boundary behind square. Easy pickings."
"big appeal. A thick inside edge. Flat delivery on off, Henriques hits the ball into his body"
"starts off with a hip-high short ball on the leg stump, Dhawan happily swats it away through backward square leg"
"boom. Dhawan races down the track, takes it on a half-volley and simply belts a drive between Watson and Henriques. Drilled straight down the ground. 50 up in just 5.2 overs"
"Watson goes for the wide yorker outside off, cross-seam, Dhawan can only squeeze it back to Watson"
"Watson goes for the wide yorker again. The execution is bad. This is a full-toss outside off, Dhawan this time stretches forward and crunches it past the covers"
"chest-high short ball on middle and leg, fine leg is inside the circle, square leg is inside the circle. Dhawan rolls his wrists and pulls it away to the square leg boundary"
"really full and outside off, driven through the line  for one. <strong>17 runs off that over</strong>"
"dragged down short outside off, Dhawan sits back and pulls it along the ground to deep midwicket"
"length ball outside off, slides off the deck, no real turn. Negotiated on the back foot"
"full and straight on off, driven on the front foot to long-on"
"skids on outside off, chopped to backward point. There was no run there. Mills picks the ball up and throws it wildly well wide of Jadhav and concedes an extra run"
chopped to the covers
"tossed full and outside off, Dhawan stretches out and drives a single down to long-off"
"full and slides on off, Dhawan opens the bat-face and dabs it gently to point"
"fired on middle from around the wicket, Henriques punches a single to long-on"
Dhawan uses his feet and drives a length ball to long-on running in
"speared across off, 91ks, Henriques forays down the track, gets close to the pitch, and launches it with great authority over long-on"
"another one that slides across off stump, this is shorter, cut away to Mills at backward point"
"tossed up on the pads, Dhawan sits back and works it in the gap at midwicket"
"Dhawan steps out early, Chahal lobbed it really wide outside off. Asks Dhawan to reach out. He can only toe-end it over a leaping cover fielder"
"short on the leg stump, swatted away to deep square leg"
"tossed full on middle, driven to long-on"
"looks like a googly outside off, Dhawan swats it away to deep midwicket"
"short and wide outside off again, slashed away to deep point"
"fired outside off, forced away in the direction of long-on. Head runs across from deep midwicket, takes his eyes off the ball, and lets it through his hands for an extra run"
"Dhawan advances down the track, aiming for a pull over midwicket, this is dug in shorter, and bounces over the leg stump"
"full and wide outside off, nearly 140ks, Dhawan forces a single to the off-side sweeper"
"short of a length on middle and leg, Aniket hits 140ks, Henriques sits back and clips it away to midwicket"
"Dhawan skies a pull and gets away. Short of a length and outside off, Aniket hustles the batsman for pace. Hits the splice as Dhawan pulls. Watson follows the ball from mid-off, does not really attack the ball, midwicket moves to his right. But the ball lands in between them"
"overpitched on leg stump, picked off square of long leg"
"banged in short and outside off, Dhawan has a slash at the ball and misses. Jadhav can't collect the ball cleanly"
"half-tracker outside off, pulled away to wide long-on"
"slower length ball outside off, Dhawan goes down on one knee, picks it up and laps it away square of short fine leg"
Dhawan can't clear long-on! Dhawan uses his feet and looks to slug a length ball from outside off over the long-on boundary. He isn't really a big six-hitter down the ground. He can't get enough power and distance. Holes out to Baby
"good length and floated in on off, tapped down to long-on"
"just short of a good length and outside off, Yuvraj opens the face and glides it through backward point"
"Binny rolls his fingers across this slower offcutter, Yuvraj waits on it before opening his face and running it down to deep third man"
"length and angled across off, run down to third man"
"good length on off, dabbed to backward point with soft hands"
"good length cutter outside off, Yuvraj waits for the ball to arrive, then glides it down to third man"
"short and wide outside off, flashed away to square third man"
"this is a Yuvraj special. Back of a length and just outside off, picks it up and whips it with the wrists over midwicket"
"length and outside off, helped down to third man again"
"short of a length and outside off, Yuvraj attempts a pull and ends up inside-edging past the leg stump. Rolls away fine on the leg side. Aniket can be skiddy"
"this is vintage Yuvraj, just driving through the line. Full and outside off, Yuvraj opens up his arms and lofts it over extra cover"
"poor bowling. Hip-high short ball outside off, Yuvraj camps back and nails a pull over midwicket for back-to-back boundaries"
much better. 134ks banged short and flies through to the keeper. Yuvraj lets it pass
"really full and wide outside off, makes a mess of the wide yorker and goes too wide. Off-side wide. Jadhav does not look comfortable behind the stumps"
"back of a length and outside off, crisply cut away square of Mills at deep third man"
"<strong>Dropped</strong>! Aravind shells it at deep square leg. Aniket ventures shorter and outside off, Yuvraj does not shy away from the pull. He hits it well enough, does not get enough distance on it, but gets away. Aravind makes a mess of a regulation chest-high catch. He attempted a reverse cup, the ball hit his chest, and went down"
"hip-high short ball outside off, got to get the ball up higher, Yuvraj picks it up and stylishly picks it up over midwicket"
"full and wide outside off, throws his bat at the ball and edges it to third man"
"full and straight, clipped through midwicket"
"Yuvraj, standing on off stump, moves across off further, meets a full-toss on a fifth-stump line, and whips past midwicket"
"change-up. Slower and wider outside off, Henriques reaches out but can't touch the ball"
"really full on middle and leg, pushed down to long-on for one"
"Henriques jumps down the track, Aravind goes shorter and outside off, slapped away to the right of Chahal at sweeper cover"
"back of a length on the leg stump, worked to square leg"
"Yuvraj launches another one into the stands. If you want to bowl short, you have to target the badge. This is a hip-high short ball outside off, possibly a slower one, picked up and pulled over midwicket"
"another hip-high short ball just outside off, stylishly whipped to deep square leg"
"just short of a good length on off, another slower ball, this one sits up. Henriques picks it up and dumps it over midwicket"
"full-toss on middle and leg, misses the yorker, punched to the midwicket region"
"a flat delivery on off from Chahal, pushed back"
"taken at the boundary. Full delivery on off, Henriques runs down, but doesn't quite get to the pitch. He goes through with the stroke, and gets more elevation than distance. It goes straight up. Long-off takes a good catch at the boundary. A reverse-cupped catch. They're having a look at the no-ball, but he's fine. Just!"
"what? how? It's happened again. A googly on middle, Yuvraj looks to pull but gets a <b>leading edge which plonks near cover</b>. Watson labours towards it. Safe. Another life for Yuvraj"
worked away to deep midwicket
"oh, fantastic stuff from Mandeep. A flat delivery outside off, so wide would have been called had Yuvraj let that go. But he goes after it. Yuvraj lays into a lofted drive towards long-off. Mandeep runs to his right, and puts in a leaping, diving, one-handed effort. The ball just bounces out of his hands as Mandeep is mid-air. Five runs saved. Didn't look to save the runs, wanted the catch. Fantastic stuff."
clipped through square leg for a run
"good length outside off, dabbed away to third man"
beaten for pace. Superb from Mills. Back of a length and close enough to off stump. Yuvraj misses his dab to third man
"four more. A bouncer on off, Yuvraj pulls, doesn't keep it down, but hammers the pull into the gap in front of square"
"there is that slower ball. Good length outside off, slapped to cover for a run"
"flummoxes Hooda. The slower bouncer, back of the hand. Hooda thinks it's pacey, but it isn't. Ducks underneath."
"another slower variation to end the over. Good length outside off, dabbed towards point"
"parried for six. RCB's woes continue. A slower ball on middle, Hooda swings. High in the air, Chahal moves back slowly, conscious of the boundary. In the end, he reverse-cups the parry over the boundary"
"over point for a run. A full toss on off, Hooda's slog skews to deep point"
"full and very wide outside off, called"
"another wide called. Full and excessively wide outside off. Outside the tramline, called"
"sliced over point for four. Yuvraj makes fifty. Off 23 balls. <strong>His fastest in IPL. </strong>Full and wide from Choudhary, not a bad area to bowl actually. But then why isn't the sweeper finer, towards point"
"full and wide again, carved to deep point on the bounce. The fielder is a lot finer now"
"excellent bouncer. Back of a length on leg, Hooda, beaten for pace, gloves his pull over the keeper for a couple. Good change in length"
went right across. Went behind the stumps too outside off. Choudhary misses an opportunity by not bowling that full and straight. Hooda flicks to deep midwicket. Probably did that to convert a yorker into a full length
"another back of the hand slower bouncer. Hooda is beaten, but then so slow is the ball that he pulls to deep square leg. Good improvisation"
"lovely shot. Full and straight, all pace. Yuvraj was setting himself for the slower ball and was prepared to improvise if the ball was quick. It was and he did well. Just a flick past short fine leg"
that sits up for Yuvraj. A back of the hand slower ball that is bowled short. Yuvraj picks the length and boom. Swatted over square leg. A lovely sound off the bat
"bowled this time. And Mills is pumped. 143 kph. That is quite an ideal delivery. Good length on middle, not full, not short. That indecisive length. Yuvraj looks to hit that through midwicket but fails to connect. Beaten for pace too. Clips the top of the bail on leg and middle. A spectacular effort from Yuvraj."
"a length delivery on middle, pulled to long-on for a run. Nice length again."
"good end from Mills. Considering the damage, this hasn't been a bad debut from Mills. Length on leg, Hooda wants one to third man but fails to connect"
"full and wide, well bowled. A thick outside edge to third man for a run. Good options from Watson. Takes the six over square leg/midwicket out"
"excellent bowling. 133 kph, extremely wide. Hooda reaches out and guides a run to point"
"all power. Full and wide outside off, Cutting stays in his crease and lofts the ball nonchalantly over deep cover. So much power behind that stroke"
"a low full toss this time, hit over the bowler for a couple. Superb ball-striking off some pretty good bowling"
a bouncer. A nice change in length. Cutting ducks underneath
"huuuge! Length delivery on off, sits up for Cutting. Hammered over square leg for six. Can't bowl that length with medium pace."
"full outswinger outside off, Gayle opens the face and guides the ball down to third man for one"
"back of a length and angling away just outside off, 141ks, Mandeep is hurried onto an off-side drive. Ends up skewing the ball through mid-on"
"back of a length and outside off, no lateral movement, Mandeep flays it straight to extra cover"
"short on off, Mandeep sits back and shovels it away to the right of mid-on"
"full on middle, right in the hitting slot, Mandeep opens up his hips and swings it over midwicket. The fielder in the deep was squarer"
"back of a length and angling across off, Mandeep reaches out and punches it serenely past backward point. Beats square third man running to his right as well"
"full and angling away outside off, Gayle has a leaden-footed swish and only connects with thin air"
"full on middle, Gayle stays back and pushes to off"
"good length and angling away outside off, Gayle opens the face and steers it through point"

"back of a length and outside off, flashed away to point"

"another hip-high short ball outside off, Gayle swats it away to deep square leg"
"full on middle and leg, Mandeep swings it nice and clear over wide mid-on"
"really full and wide outside off, squeezed down to third man"
"Gayle gets into his groove. Length ball outside off, Gayle extends his arms, and lofts it disdainfully over the long-on boundary. Sends it soaring into the stands"
Mandeep skips out and drags an inside edge through square leg. He wasn't close to the pitch
"pitched up on off stump, Gayle lays into it, putting Bhuvneshwar over the long-on fence with a clean, powerful swing"
"short on leg stump, Gayle was sitting back for it, tucking to deep square leg"
"full-toss wide outside off, left alone. Too wide that it's called a wide"
"good length on middle, Gayle pokes it to the covers"
"slower offcutter from Bhuvneshwar, 115ks, Gayle waits for it to arrive and gently pats it down the ground"
"142ks, full from Bhuvneshwar, too full, a fierce whirl of the wrists from Mandeep sends the ball to the wide long-on boundary"
"begins with a bouncer on the leg stump, aimed at the head, Gayle ducks under it"
"change-up, slower cutter, 118ks, Gayle was already through with the slog. Beaten for the change of pace"
"just short of a good length and outside off, Gayle hangs back and flat-bats it to mid-of"
another slower one. Really full and cuts away wide outside off. Gayle throws his bat at it but can't reach it. Wide
"back of a length and outside off, Gayle has a big mow to leg. He can't connect"
"short and outside off, Gayle makes some room and flays the ball to cover"
"length and outside off, Gayle has a leg-side slog and ends up dragging an inside edge over midwicket. An excellent over, nevertheless"
"full and slides on outside off, Mandeep backs away and shovel-drives it like Kohli to extra cover"
"too full and outside off,  Mandeep backs away and shovel-drives it again, this time he finds the gap at cover and the boundary"
"darted short and outside off, chopped to cover"
"<b>Rashid strikes in his first over in the IPL</b>. Googly? No, this is the quicker one, that skids off the deck. Mandeep plays back, is fooled by the trajectory, and drags an inside edge back onto the leg stump"
"short on off, worked to leg on the back foot"
"very full and outside off, driven through the line to mid-off"
"darted outside off, chopped to cover"
"this is a massive, massive blow from Gayle. Full-toss outside off,  Gayle stretches forward and smites it into the night sky"
"six and out! The offspinner takes down Gayle. Length ball outside off, this does not turn much. Gayle steps out, aims for an encore. He miscues this. Warner runs to his right from long-off and pouches it well. He lets out a big roar"
"full and outside off, pushed to cover"
"full and outside off, driven down the ground"
"good dip for Hooda, Jadhav eyes up the leg side, and ends up leading-edging the ball towards mid-off"

"really full on off, drilled back to the bowler, who lets it bursts through his hands in his followthrough"

"Head shimmies out, and whips a full-toss to Dhawan at deep square leg"

"short on off, stands tall and forces it to wide long-on"
"just short of a good length and outside off, slogged away off the inside half to deep square leg"
"<strong>Ripping throw from Cutting</strong>. He effects a direct hit on the full, nailing the top of the stumps at the striker's end from long leg. Kedhar premeditated a lap sweep. He went low, took a length ball from outside off and lapped it away to long leg. Cutting swoops down on the ball and splatters the stumps. What a throw - full-toss hitting the stumps from the deep - to catch the batsman miles short on the second"
"short and outside off, stands tall and punches to sweeper"
"short and outside off, flashed to point"
"fired outside off, driven to long-off"

"flat delivery on the pads, Baby misses a flick. Struck on the pad"
"shortish on off, hammered to long-off"
"pushed through, it's a good length, but Watson is very strong on the pull. Hit to deep square leg"
"taken. Bipul gets one. Henriques takes the catch. RCB falling away rapidly. A flat, full delivery on the pads. Baby wanted to hit that over midwicket, but the ball slid on with the arm, resulting in a leading edge which hung in the air. Henriques back-tracks and takes a simple catch, made that look easy"
punched to long-on from the back foot. Tidy over so far
worked away through square leg for a run. Good stuff from Bipul
nudged to square leg for one. Excellent length. Ensuring it's tough to hit
"a googly, worked away through midwicket"
"the googly, Binny doesn't read it off the pitch or in the air. Convincingly undone. Hits Binny on the pad"
"just outside off. Flat delivery outside off, Binny didn't pick the previous one, so the obvious reaction was the sweep. Rashid knew that so he fired it full. Gets underneath Binny's sweep. <strong>Big appeal, impact outside off</strong>"
"cut to short third man, googly"
"brute power. Back of a length on middle, can't drop short to Watson. He rocks back and pummels a pull over long-on. So strong. Muscle was enough, Add timing and the result is pretty clear"
a legcutter outside off. Sprayed wide outside off intentionally. Creeps underneath the bat
got that alright. This one is straighter. Binny stays in the crease and thwack. Waaay over midwicket. Timing again
"what was that? Short third man backtracked instead of coming forward. That should have been taken. Complete misjudgement. Back of a length, Binny looks to dab the ball over short third man, but can only lob it towards the fielder. Absurd. Never seen that before. <strong>A regulation catch if he went forward or even sideways. </strong>"
"a slow legcutter outside off, driven up to mid-off. Watson sends Binny back"

"a low full toss on leg, clipped to deep midwicket for one"
"a nice yorker outside off, hit up to long-off for a run"
"oh phew. <strong>Naman Ojha has shelled a sitter</strong>. The fielding in this game has been appalling. A slower delivery outside off, Binny's slog results in a leading edge which hangs in the air for quite a bit. Naman shuns everyone away. But gets underneath it and lets it go through"
an excellent wide yorker. Just inside the tramline
"another wide yorker, outside-edged down to third man for a run"
"this is an easier opportunity and taken. This is lovely bowling. It's a length legcutter on off. The legcutter has some skid, some pace. Binny is hurried on his pull and just bunts a catch to Yuvraj at backward point."
"full delivery outside off, a swing across the line makes connection with nothing but air."
"doesn't look quick. A low full toss on middle and leg, swept away to deep square leg. Watson labours back for two"
"there it is. Turns down the single. A full delivery down leg, Watson misses a sweep. Off the pad towards midwicket"
"that's the game. A full toss on middle and off, the ball moves away in the air. Watson cannot time his heave. Gets a leading edge which hangs in the air for a bit before settling in midwicket's reverse-cupped hands. Simple."
"bowled. Clean through. Araving gives himself room, but Nehra is full and straight. Smashes into leg stump. Zing bails go everywhere. <b>Nehra gets to 100 IPL wickets</b>"
"ooh, just past the outside edge. Full and wide outside off, Chahal is beaten on the outside edge"
"and again. Full and wide, Chahal plays a drive too early and is beaten. Two wickets for Nehra in his spell"

"full and straight, defended to mid-off"
"slower ball, nudged down to fine leg for a single"
"smashed for six. Full and wide outside off, Mills unleashes a square drive over point. Way into the stands, Surely a better No. 8 than Aravind"
"very very high in the air, and Warner takes it. A slower delivery on middle and leg, Tymal Mills gets underneath the mow. Soars high, Warner settles underneath and claims the catch."
"legcutter on middle, worked to midwicket. A couple of wickets for Bhuvi too, does his job"
"good length delivery outside off, pushed away towards point."
"good length delivery on middle, pulled towards midwicket. The fielder gets across and misses the stumps at the bowler's end. Out if he hit."
"nice way to start your IPL batting career. A bouncer on leg, Choudhary gets a thick top-edge which flies over fine leg for six."
"Chris Jordan makes his appearance in the IPL. A slower short delivery on middle, pulled on the bounce to Jordan at midwicket. He picks up cleanly, and throws the stumps down at the bowler's end as Choudhary sent Chahal back. It's <b>RCB's worst loss - in terms of runs - since April 2013</b>. Not the best way to start the season"
