"starts with a bit of a drifter down leg, Kayes has no hope of connecting with it."
"back of a length, pushing it across the left-hander. Kayes ignores it"
"<b>ripper</b>! Rabada hits the deck and makes the ball seam past the outside edge. Pitches on leg stump, so Kayes has to play and is lucky not to nick off"
"tucks him up with a shortish delivery on middle and leg. Kayes tries to flick it away, but can't pull it off"
defends a back of a length delivery on off stump. Rabada's getting just enough inward movement off the pitch to the left-hander
"134kph, gets back in line with a shortish delivery on off stump"
"shifts across in his crease and the 140 kph delivery strikes him on the thigh with the outside half of leg stump behind it. Half an appeal from Rabada, but that might not have hit the stumps. Height and line, the issues"
"some curl through the air, but that only takes the full delivery onto the right-hander's pads. Das clips it neatly to long leg"
"blocks a shortish delivery on off stump. Kayes thinks about a single, but Miller, that 100 ODI veteran (feels weird to say that), is wise to those drop-and-run tactics."
"<b>outside edge</b> flies away to the third man boundary and the crowd roars - a substantial portion of it is carrying Bangladesh flags. They might not have liked how the runs came about, with Kayes pushing at the ball, panicking upon seeing the full-length ball swinging away so late."
"strikes on the thigh pad, which brings out an appeal from the debutant. But the ball must have pitched outside leg. Umpire Dar signals leg byes as the ball wanders out to deep third man"
"brings out a straight bat to handle an inswinger at 137 kph. Good shot, keeping the front leg from moving too far across."
"blocks a good length ball, shaping in, against the angle moving off the pitch. Kayes defends with an inside edge"
"excellent leave as a 132 kph delivery hits the deck and darts past, just a sliver or two outside off stump"
"opens the face and guides a good length, 130kph ball behind point"
whips a full delivery on leg stump to mid-on.
"<b>hostile</b>! This is 130 kph, but it darts in off the pitch, off just a shortish length. So the batsman doesn't have too early a warning that he has to duck. Das sinks to his knees and sways his torso back to avoid damage"
now the other one - angling in through the air and moving away off the pitch. This is <b>class bowling</b>. Beats the right-hander's tentative poke
not so much this time with the full ball at 140 kph straying down leg. Clips to long leg
"good length ball at 139 kph, blocks it to cover"
"fine shot! That's a statement. A pull shot to tell the bowlers that they can't bully this team with bounce. Das picks the length early, and swats the ball well in front of square"
pitches it further up and that makes the batsman be a little more circumspect. Straight bat block
"moves back, and towards leg, to nudge the shortish ball meant to cramp him towards cover point"
presses forward and crunches a full delivery at 138 kph to cover. He Das look good.
"<b>superb shot</b>, just a gentle push down the ground, and it seemed set to go to the long-on boundary, until Imran Tahir throws himself to his left and keeps it to a single"
"138 kph, good length ball outside off, Das, without moving across to cover his stumps, leaves the ball. Brave. Especially with Rabada nipping the ball in off the deck"
<b>extra bounce</b> as Das pushes forward to block and the ball thuds into the splice of the bat
"141 kph, that's the ole teaser! Nearly a half-volley outside off, draws Das into the cover drive, with no feet. Then he outswing takes it past the outside edge"
"143kph, full on off stump, turns it to mid-on"
"a bouncer now, digs it in quite short, Das lets it go"
"another short ball, Das balls himself up under it"
drills a full delivery at 137 kph to mid-on
"full and outside off at 135 kph, Kayes drives superbly to cover"
lets the short ball come to him and then deftly taps it through to deep third man. Super cricket.
smashes it through point. A little width outside off and Das places it to the right of the fielder and trusts his timing
"back of a length on off stump, tucks it to midwicket"
"sensational drive down the ground! Moves forward serenely to meet the full length ball and taps it to the right of mid-off, concentrating on keeping his shape, and making sure the placement is right"
"hits the pad and goes to de Kock, who doesn't collect it cleanly - but wait, the umpire calls it a wide down leg. And Bongani Jele's right. It's the sound of the bat hitting his pads as it comes across the line"
"full on off stump, defends"
"goes short, but it wanders down leg again. Kayes lets it go and collects the extra"
steers a full delivery outside off to point
clips a shortish delivery into the midwicket region. He is into the shot a touch too early and has to adjust his batswing
<b>falls short of gully</b>. Teasing the left-hander with wide stuff almost works. A touch more bounce than Kayes expects as he hangs out the fishing rod.
"firm push to mid-off, pulling his front leg back to make sure he can bring the straight bat down on a ball curling into him from outside off"
"<b>chaos</b>! Having taken the effort to push the full length ball to the left of cover, but Paterson moves quickly to cut the angle and send in a sharp throw. Kayes is sent back just in time, and he puts in a desperate dive as well. No direct hit, and replays suggest it wouldn't have mattered either"
checks his pull - because the ball seems to stop on him. But there is enough timing on it for the ball to dawdle away to the square leg boundary
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
"nice shot, hanging back and beside the short ball to chop it on top of the bounce to deep third man"
"walks at the bowler and then hacks all across the line. For all that effort, he only gets a leading edge that soars away to the third man boundary. Terrible shot, but no arguing the outcome"
"bangs it in short, and in venting his frustration, he forgets to hold his line properly. Goes down leg and Kayes has an easy put away to long leg. All the pressure on him is being released"
"117kph, slower ball, down leg again, Kayes works it through square leg"
steps forward neatly to a 145 kph full ball on off stump and gently pushes to mid-off. Not at all ruffled by high pace.
"145 kph again, and Das is onto it again, driving sweetly down the ground. If not for a well-placed boot from Rabada, that would have been a boundary"
pulls his bat inside the line of a back of a length delivery that seams away off the pitch at 137 kph
"cuts back in off the seam at 141 kph and Das, with his habit of pushing the front leg across too early, gets closed off and is struck on the body"
"139 kph, short ball, angled into the right-hander. Das ducks and collects a wide. Pitched on off stump, and moved in off the seam"
"<b>caught at second slip</b>! But confirmation of that will have to come from the third umpire. And it looks like Das will have to go. Outstanding bowling from Rabada. Pitches on a good length. Makes it move away, against the angle and off the pitch. The batsman lunges forward to block with hard hands and looks back to watch Faf du Plessis snapping up a good low catch moving to his right"
drills a full delivery at 140 kph to mid-off
"quicker delivery on middle, clips to square leg"
drifts down the pads as Kayes nudges it to short fine leg.
blocks another faster delivery on off stump. This at 91 kph
"<b>dropped</b>, is it? Kayes goes for a reverse sweep and the ball lobs over the wicketkeeper - it's a googly, so he does try to hit with the turn. But ends up almost gloving it behind - the deflection is too much for de Kock"
nudges a shortish delivery to deep square leg
steps out and works a full delivery to mid-on
blocks a full delivery on off stump at 139 kph

"good length ball on middle, Kayes whips it to mid-on"

"tossed up outside off, misses the sweep and he's hit on the pad. Rolls away to the left of the keeper and they run a leg-bye. Struck him outside the line, I think, but they've still reviewed. It's the googly, so it's probably hitting the stumps, but he stretched a fair way forward and across and it's definitely hit him outside the line"

"slower length ball on the pads, clipped to the left of midwicket"

"another slower bouncer outside off, plays a controlled overhead smash to deep square leg"
"sharply spinning googly, cramps Mushfiq after pitching just back of a length. Tucked to midwicket"
skips out now and Tahir bowls it full at his legs. Clipped to midwicket
"goes for the sweep, top-edges, and he's lucky that falls into a gap. Doesn't quite get his head over the ball, and the bounce causes him to send a top-edge looping high in the air, but it falls between deep midwicket and deep backward square leg"

"back of a length on middle and leg, Mushfiqur clips it behind square leg"
"backs away - but by doing so far too soon, he allows the bowler to follow him with a shortish delivery. With no room on offer, he can only defend"

"slower ball on off stump, defends"
"waits on the shortish delivery, dabs it to the right of the wicketkeeper, they think about the quick single, but de Kock dives to his right and prevents them from doing so. And we've got <b>drinks on the field</B>"
pushes forward to a 137 kph good length ball outside off and blocks to point
"that's a bouncer, at 134 kph, and Mushfiqur sways out of its way"
width on offer and Mushfiqur flays it through to the sweeper cover. He's been so well balanced at the crease
"that's a monster hit! The short ball comes in 140 kph, but it's gone off the bat way quicker. Phew. Mahmudullah runs down the track at South Africa's quickest bowler and then tonks him over deep midwicket. Flat, hard, six"
"the riposte is a bouncer, on middle and leg, Mahmudullah sways out of the way"
blocks a good length ball at 140 kph to cover
"reads the slower bouncer well and then pulls it out to deep square leg. Only 96 kph on that offcutter, pitching in Pretorius' own half of the pitch"
"fuller delivery outside off, Mahmudullah defends through the vacant cover region"
"nudges a shortish delivery off his hips, but square leg is on hand"
a little bit of room outside off and Mushfiqur chops it away to deep third man
prepares to leave the short ball. Then he realises there is no pace on it and perhaps he could catch up with the ball and pull it away. But by that time the ball has passed over his shoulder to the wicketkeeper
"shapes to steer the back of a length delivery to third man, but the deflection goes too fine and for half a second he fears he might be caught behind. But the ball falls short of de Kock diving to his right, and because of that he can't collect it cleanly"
swivels on his back foot and pulls the slower short ball to deep square leg
"gets up with the short ball on middle and clips it to midwicket. Amla ambles in, but over-runs the ball and almost gives up an extra run"
angles into the right-hander and cramps him well enough that Mahmudullah gets an inside edge onto his thigh
"legcutter, which takes the outside edge and scurries to the third man boundary. Change of pace bites into the pitch, moves off the straight and takes enough of Mahmudullah's bat to elude the diving de Kock"
"short of a length on off stump, defends"
"he's getting some nip into the right-hander, more so it's happening so very late off the pitch that Mahmudullah can't quite read it. Only just manages to save himself from trouble with an inside edge"
wicket-to-wicket again and this time Mahmudullah is able to block it well
"good length ball on middle and leg, turns it to midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
"try, try and try again until you scoop a fast bowler to the fine leg boundary and laugh in his face. Sensational shot. Picks the perfect ball for it too. Full one, sliding down leg, easy pickings"
so out comes the slower bouncer - seems to be his go-to - and the ball soars over the right-hander's head as he tries to pull.
"picks the off-pace bouncer, waits on it, his body already in position for the pull shot and then whisks it over midwicket fielder. Super stuff. Not really easy to hit those balls well enough that they almost carry to the boundary"
"back of a length on off stump, pushes to midwicket"
"back of a length and outside off, hacks it away to midwicket"
"back of a length and outside off, goes too far outside off. Mahmudullah ignores it and collects a wide"

punches a shortish delivery through the covers
"full on middle, Mushfiqur swings right across it and somehow sends the ball out to deep square leg. Could easily have been bowled there"
hauls a good length ball on off stump out to deep square leg.
"that's gone straight up.... and falls perfectly in Miller's hands. Fine catch, he has to keep his eyes on it against the sun - the shades help with that - has to run back a bit from cover and then take it reverse-cupped before falling over. Big wicket for South Africa, engineered by Pretorius' slower ball. That's all he's cared to bowl in this spell, banging it into the pitch and making batsmen forget about ever trying to hit straight. Mahmudullah tries to make his own pace by running down the track for a flay over cover. Doesn't succeed"
nudges a shortish delivery out to midwicket
swivels on the back foot to pull the short ball from outside off to the backward square leg boundary. Lovely shot
"on the pads, clips to backward square leg"
"defends a fuller delivery on off stump, no room on offer, not quite the length to get under and launch over the bowler's head either"

"pushes it through on off stump, Sabbir punches it to cover"
"he's unsure how the ball will turn, and this one, pitched further up adds to his anxiety. Eventually, he reads it as a legbreak off the pitch and even then only outside edges to point"
"fires it in on off stump, Sabbir defends"
"seems to be the googly, which is turned away behind square leg"
"sliding onto the pads, Mushfiqur attempts to dab it to fine leg. Doesn't make contact. Sabbir, though, is haring down for a single and has to be sent back"
"shortish and outside off, Mushfiqur pats it to extra cover"
"there's a noise as the ball passes the bat, and bounces over the stumps. Mushfiqur goes for the good old heave ho, across the line of a length ball, and has nothing to show for it"
spots Mushfiqur's front leg being pushed away and so looks for the wide yorker. Perfect ball to unsettle a batsman premeditating
"launches it over square leg! Amazing strike! And it's taken a little bit out of him, because he's stretching his legs, seemingly cramping up. Get some fluids in, man. You're in prime form. Keep going. Just like this - taking a ball that isn't all that short and clobbering it over the boundary"
"full toss, right over the wide line. Mushfiqur, after that attack of cramps, can't quite reach that far and is bewildered that that isn't penalised by the umpire"
"another yorker outside off, with Mushfiqur trying to keep leg side of the ball to slog. Splendid execution, by the debutant"
"three on the trot - another yorker, skirting the wide line and though Mushfiqur is prepared for it, he still can't get bat to ball. So five dot balls and a six, not a bad over at all."
gets down the track and drives with a straight bat to long-off
"pushes the legbreak into leg stump, and Mushfiqur, despite making room, is still too cramped to free the arms. Has to settle for a single to cover"
sweeps a full delivery from outside off to deep square leg
shapes for the reverse sweep - and that's a fine shot because third man is up and the line of this ball is well outside off. Lovely batting. <b>Highest score by a Bangladeshi batsman against South Africa</b>
defends a tossed up delivery on off stump. He's definitely having trouble moving around because of cramps
"another reverse sweep! Mushfiqur has had a splendid day today, and it continues with him taking a good length ball on off stump - which otherwise would have been a single down the ground - becomes four past point's left"
steps out and smears a length ball outside off to long-on
moves across outside off to be in position to reach the wide yorkers - and it works as Mushfiqur slices the ball to deep third man. The crowd's revving itself up. Brilliant atmosphere.
"fine leg comes up, so Sabbir tries a scoop. Only problem, Paterson keeps executing the wide yorker with pin-point precision. Lands just inside the wide line and does not allow the batsman to access the leg side"
"superb hit! This is in the blockhole, outside off stump, but Sabbir is waiting for it. Opens the face to beat the man at point inside the circle and then the timing is good enough to beat the man in the deep too"
"launches a full toss over deep square leg! Outstanding hit, taking full toll of the bowler's length going wrong. Yorker sits up to be smashed"
"continues backing his strength and delivers a stinging, inswinging yorker to end the over with a dot ball"
nudges a full delivery down to long-on. He's three shy of a well-deserved century
jumps back quickly enough to slice a shortish delivery off the stumps to point

turns a slower than usual ball on leg stump to long leg
picks the googly and nudges it away to deep square leg

"another short ball, this one is top-edged to midwicket and Rabada wraps up with four wickets"
