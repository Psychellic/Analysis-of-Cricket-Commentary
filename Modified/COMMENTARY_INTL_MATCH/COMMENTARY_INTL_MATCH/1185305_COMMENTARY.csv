"on a length and he hits that crack, it draws the edge as it moves away <b>and Root is gone!</b> Very important wicket for South Africa as Faf du Plessis gobbles up the catch at slip"
defended just in front of point
that one sprang up and sailed high over everyone
"full and on middle, he defends to the leg side"
"short and angling in, he does well to dart underneath that one"
he defends towards mid-off
"length ball, outside off and he is watchful as he leaves"
"on leg stump and angling in slightly, he dabs it back down into the pitch"
"short, just outside leg and lifting, South Africa appealing for caught behind! It's not given ... but they call for a review. Replays show <b>contact with the glove!</b> It looked like it might have grazed his armpit but there was a definite spike of noise as it passed the glove and he's gone for a pair."
"line and length outside off, a solid blob of bat on ball to start the morning"
"shoulders arms outside off stump, and no stroke offered"
"firmly onto the front foot, and poked into the covers"
"solid in defence once more, probing away outside off"
"shorter and sharper, Sibley leans inside the line of a lifter through to the keeper"

"round the wicket, a hint of turn from the rough outside the left-hander's off stump"
down on one knee and sweeping behind square
"defensive line into the pads, tucked off the legs"

"shaping into the pads, Stokes attempts a flick off the legs but can't connect"
"head over the ball, blocked back down the track"
"wide on the crease from round the wicket, tailing into the left-hander who blocks with intent on the front foot"
"punched on the up, width from back of a length. Can't beat mid-off"
<strong>punked through midwicket!</strong> That's an extraordinarily dismissive stroke. Just a forearm jab as Pretorius's lack of pace is thoroughly exploited. Lose your length by a foot and pay the price
padded away as Maharaj tests Sibley's patience on that leg-stump line
"back and across, into line and blocked round the corner"
tidy length again and Sibley can do little about that
"flicked off the toes, opportunistic from Sibley, and bringing both a leading edge and lbw into play as he squirts one past leg slip"
padded away once more as this one kicks from just outside leg
firm in defence. Just the two runs in that over
"<B>gadzooks!</B> This is dismissive! Stokes has all the time in the world, getting right underneath a full-length wobbler, and dumped with power and disdain high over the bowler's head!"
"<B>reverse clobber past gully!</B> Extraordinary power, range and precision. Pretorius has nowhere to hide right now!"
"decent length from round the wicket, and this time Stokes props forward in defence"
"dipping into the toes, and clipped to midwicket"
"full face of the bat, pumping through the line once more, and midwicket tumbles to gather"
"leans on another push through the on-side. If that over hasn't hastened the new ball, who knows what will"
down on one knee and paddled round the corner
"<B>out comes the proposal!</B> One on one knee, outside off, a massive flourish, high over cow corner. Tonk-tastic!"
flashed into the leg side once again. Stokes is in a mood this morning!
"<B>yee-har!</B> More twirly lengths outside off, and Stokes has another monstrous heave to nothing. Misses this time, much to Maharaj's relief"
"hops across the stumps, some hint of turn as Stokes' intentions are undermined"
solid in defence to see out the over
line and length on off stump. Sibley strides forward to defend
"lifting away from the right-hander, outside off, and left alone"
"curling away on a full length, and through to the keeper"
"head over the ball, leaning onto the front foot, blocked back down the track"
"defended with the bottom hand leaving the handle, evidence of Philander's extra nip with that new ball, off that awkward crack"
"nipping away, through to the keeper, no stroke this time. Sibley content to bide his time for now"
"standing tall on the back foot, punched to mid-on"
"round the wicket and defended, line and length shaping in towards the off stump"
""
"<B>a flirt outside off!</B> Sibley is a bit nonplussed by this change of approach, bringing the stumps into play and demanding a decision"
blotted into the covers
a bottom-handed shovel into the leg side. Slightly ungainly response to an attacking line
"<strong>a filthy hack off a good length!</strong> Well, why not... he didn't let one medium-pacer settle, why bother with the other? Tidied at deep midwicket"
"patted into the gap, much straighter lines from the straight-laced Sibley. One closer ..."
"inswinging attempted yorker, and <B>pummelled off the toes through the gap at square leg!</B> Reminiscent of his field bisector in the World Cup final. You remember the one..."
"pumped into the off side, up comes the 300 as Stokes crosses for the second"
"banged in short, and wide. That's dross from such an experienced bowler, but he's clearly rattled by the lack of respect being offered by Stokes, who rises onto his toes to <strong>clobber through  backward point</strong>"
"advancing down the track, Philander sees him coming and fires it out wide. Under-edged to the keeper"
"leaning onto the front foot, and blocked"
"firm in defence, as Maharaj attacks the top of off once more from round the wicket"
"short and wide, but Sibley misses out.... an attempted chop through point, but not timed"
"on the hips, back of a length, so offering the opportunity to shuffle across the stumps and work another couple into the leg side. Into the 90s..."
defensive line into the pads once more. Nudged away with no stroke
using the pad once more to negate the leg-side line
"back of a length, no liberties from even the liberated Stokes, who hops back and across in defence"
"<strong>a murderous wallop high into the leg side!</strong> A massive top-edge ... who wants this? Not Malan, that's for sure. He's best placed at fine leg, but de Kock with the gloves calls for it, sprints, dives... <strong>and drops it!</strong> The rebound thumping him in the face for good measure!"
a knee-high full-toss outside off? Oh go on then! <B>Panned through mid-on!</B>
"a round-house wipe into the leg side, to keep the strike"
"<B>finds the gap!</B> Cheers from the England supporters as Sibley finds a rare opportunity to pierce the covers with a bottom-handed jab. Nearly a four, but clawed in well on the edge of the rope. In fact, it's been over-turned on review"
stretching onto the front for a solid block back down the pitch. Enough progress for one over!
"turning into the legs from over the wicket, flinched behind square"
patted away off the toes
dabbed behind square as Maharaj slides a touch short from over the wicket. One more to Sibley's bid
"<strong>reverse sweep</strong>, sweetly timed, Rabada slides round to gather but they hustle back for two"
punched off the pads to the on side. Stokes moves to within one of his own landmark
"over the wicket, fired into the pads, no stroke offered there"
"hauled behind square, and there it is! <strong>Stokes has a ninja-quick fifty,</strong> and England's morning has been nigh on perfect so far"
blotted back down the pitch as Rabada targets line and length
"firm in defence, nothing shall rush Sibley at this critical personal juncture"
"line and length, and blocked back to the bowler"
"outside off, through to the keeper, no stroke"
"<B>edged, but clean through the vacant third slip!</B> Yikes... that was South Africa's best ball of the morning... but it's taken Sibley to 99 ..."
"width, flashed through backward point"
"advancing to the pitch, tucked down the track, Stokes wasn't sure if the single was on, but they jog it easily enough in the end. Sibley on strike ..."
"padded away, with a leg slip in situ for extra jeopardy"
skims off the pad as Sibley pads up again
"<B>swept, nailed, century!</B> Supremely struck, pounded out of the rough, timed to perfection through backward square, and off comes the helmet! That's a moment to treasure. Quite possibly his first sweep of the Test too, trusting his eye and the set-up of the field. Well played young man!"
padded away off a leg-stump line
pushed with vertical lines back through the ball
"extra zip outside off, Sibley hauls his gloves out of harm's way"

"saunters out, free-wheeling swing through the line, <b>smooshed over the rope at long-on!</b> Clicking into Beast Mode again"

"shortish outside off, Stokes throws the hands and fails to connect"
"fullish length, maybe a cutter and this is punched through the covers"
"length ball, 143kph/89mph and clipped through cover to the sweeper for one"
"short ball, angled across outside off and Stokes is up off his toes to swat down through mid-on"
"back of a length outside off, Sibley leaves alone"
"good pace, 140kph/87mph in the channel, again he's happy to leave alone"
"but he won't be getting to 100 today... <b>slapped to long-on</b>, Stokes' fun is over! Didn't get the elevation, hit hard but van der Dussen held it well as he came across. Stokes shakes his head in frustration, and that may provide some respite for SA after a damaging 75 minutes"
"pushed through outside leg stump, kicked away"
"floated up, Pope brings out the reverse-sweep and gets his first run away through point"

"length on the pads, Sibley nudges this fine and gets it past the diving Rabada for four! <b>England's lead passes 400</b>"
Sibley sticks out his front leg and pads the ball away
"goes across, attempted scoop... <b>tickled to the keeper!</b> Buttler walks and Nortje has a third, no sense of England slowing down. Just came off the face on its way through over the stumps"
"short of a length outside off, 141kph/88mph and steered through point"
"banged in short outside off, Sibley clambers down the fire escape"
"fuller, 142kph/88mph, pushed square on the off side coming across"

"shortish outside off, 123kph/76mph and slapped on the cut through backward point for a couple"

"over the wicket, slides past the outside edge, beaten. Tight lines"
"advances to the pitch, blotted back to the bowler. An exploratory foray"
"rocks back to pounce on the long-hop, the fruits of mixing it up, but he's only gone and <strong>wellied it straight to midwicket!</strong> A long trudge back to the pavilion, as Maharaj gets a bonus wicket to massage his bruised figures"

"tucked up on the legs, rapping the glove and pushed down, past the lurking presence of Elgar at short leg"
<B>sniffing leather again!</B> Broad hops back and across as the ball batters the splice and loops up into the off side. Root holds his head in his hands in the dressing room. Itchy fingers from the skipper yet?
"<strong>reverse sweep!</strong> Tremendously executed, hauled from the rough outside leg, and slapped through backward point"
"conventional sweep this time, well played behind square, but intercepted this time"
"spannered through long-on, as Broad unleashes his erratic levers on a slog-pull"
"swept off the pads, a delicate deflection on a tight leg-stump line, but short fine leg is well placed"
"another reverse sweep, Sibley keeps on engineering the gaps, this time into the covers"

"tighter line, but still shaping to leg with no obvious sign of swing. Dabbed square"
"<B>that's the spot!</B> Outside off, shaping in, left alone as the ball <I>grazes</I> past the off stump! There are two types of leave..."
... and that's the right type of leave as well! Extra kick off the deck as Malan shows his intimate knowledge of his off stump
"a fraction wider, trampoline bounce from a full length, left alone"
"excellent line, excellent leave. Six of those an over, and Anderson will be in business"
"round the wicket, full and wide, and <strong>eased through the gap in the covers!</strong> Broad emulates Anderson with a first-ball freebie"
"three slips lurk as Broad tightens his line from round the wicket, Buttler takes with a tumble"
nudged off the pads for the strike-rotating single
"<B>massive appeal!</B> This looks utterly plumb, but for the slight suspicion of an inside edge ... England <B>review</B> ... what will the replays reveal? Nope, nothing there, <B>or is there?</B> Yes, imperceptible on the first replay, but there's a clear spike on ultra-edge! On we go"

hustled to short cover
"<strong>a yawning launch down the ground!</strong> Elgar doesn't time it as the ball plugs at long-on, but there was intent in his stroke as he used his feet to reach the pitch!"
"<B>huge appeal!</B> Massive delay as the umpire weighs it up, but the finger's gone up finally and <B>Elgar reviews!</B> He was stretching forward, thrusting his bat at the line of the spinning ball, and it was seriously adjacent as ball passed bat. <B>Now then!</B> There's a tiny disruption on Ultra-Edge ... so small that it could have been static... but it's sufficient for the on-field decision to be upheld!"

"finds the line, finds the edge, <b>finds the breakthrough!</b> Beautifully bowled, reversing enough as Hamza pushed out, scrambling off the seam and catching the blade before dipping low into Buttler's gloves! Hamza looks distraught, but he has to go"

jag off the seam on a very tight off-stump line. Well left on length
"<B>huge appeal!</B> Anderson nips one back off the seam again, and there's a slender sound as well as ball passes body! Will England review? No ... and it's <B>flicked the top of the pad</B>. Good decision, from umpire and England"

"wider line again, another big stride with bat raised high"
"wide line again, fuller length though, so Maharaj slaps into a purposeful drive. Straight to cover though so no damage done"
"<B>utterly plumb!</B> Done like a kipper this time. Anderson's off-stump line suddenly morphs into a middle-stump line, with a notch of late in-duck to beat the inside edge. Maharaj hardly waited for the decision, let alone to consider the review! Smashing middle and leg, I reckon"

"back and across, standing tall on the back foot to defend"
"solid once more on the front foot, defended"
"outside off, through to the keeper, no stroke again"
"<strong>ambitious appeal!</strong> Definitely tailing in from Anderson, but Malan looked to have got his front pad outside the line. Hint of inside-edge too. England decline the one remaining review, with good reason. Slipping over the top of middle"

"firm in defence, back down the track, as Broad goes wider on the crease in response to Dharmasena's warning"

"tailing in, and pressed to cover"

solid in defence once more

firm in defence once more
"bending into the stumps, and <B>nearly wriggles through!</B> Du Plessis sets off for a reflexive run to square leg, and <B>jeepers, Curran's shy is nearly curtains!</B> Sharp work, but Buttler can't quite claw it onto the stumps. He had to turn around Anderson, which took vital strides out of his second run"
blocked to the off side

"loose from Curran, a loopy leg-stump full-toss, and gently dabbed behind square to the rope. A 400% strike-rate will get SA's victory bid back on track!"

"<strong>a floppy pull, toe-ended past the off stump!</strong> Whoops ... that wasn't quite as he planned. vdD's defensive mindset leaves him a little reticent on the attacking stroke, and Buttler can't intercept"
tapped to the on-side
"over the wicket, sturdily blocked to the on side. See? He can do it..."
glided serenely to deep backward point as Curran offers a fraction of width

"wider line, a yawning leave as QDK leaves well alone"
pushed back down the pitch
"solid in defence once more, mid-on gathers as Broad probes on a middle and leg line"

pressed to mid-on to escape the strike

"looped up, dipping into the footmarks, driven without conviction back to the bowler"
nurdled off the legs to midwicket

"right back on the stumps, tidy lines from Bess, and fended away with intent"
"tossed up, and <B>de Kock is beaten by the dip!</B> Drawn out of the crease, and a <B>missed stumping too!</B>Might have been a slender edge to disrupt the take"

"once again, immaculate areas, keeping South Africa firmly under wraps"
extra bounce out of the rough again as de Kock rocks back on an attempted cut but can't get much leverage through the stroke
"big loop, dipping into a wafting slog-drive, but gathered at mid-on"

pressed into the off side
"wheeling away, fenced past the lurking silly point with an exaggerated push of the bat"
"sharp turn, vdD rides the bounce, taking the bottom hand off the bat to defend"

"wheeling away, no apparent discomfort in his followthrough as Buttler gathers at waist height"
"pokey defence, hopping into line on the back foot outside off"
"lifting through to the keeper, the ball dies as it reaches Buttler. 79mph that time, whatever that is in kph"
left alone with a flourish outside off. Perfectly serviceable line and length from Anderson
a grunt of effort as Anderson whizzes that one through. Buttler looks intently down the pitch to assess his team-mate. Not much reveal in that body language

"wider line, left alone with a high raise of the bat"
"without projecting too much, that looked laboured from Anderson. Very full outside off, no stroke offered"

"turns his stance inside-out in an exaggerated defensive flourish, lining the ball up on fourth stump"

"outside off, and through to the keeper"
"wider line, through to the keeper with no alarms"
"fuller length, attacking a middle-and-leg line, and defended with caution back down the track"
"<B>snorter!</B> The first ball to misbehave in hours, for the seamers at least. Hits a beautiful length, explodes off the seam, skims past the outside edge, as Broad rolls his fingers on the cutter"

"back and across, fenced back to the bowler"
"floated into the foot-holes, panned to cover with minimal footwork"
"blocked on the back foot, leaping turn, though not at a sharp pace"
"rolling legbreak, into a defensive push off the back foot"
"<B>another brain-fart!</B> Denly has done de Kock with the long-hop! Crawley at short midwicket clings onto a screaming pull above his head, and for the second time in an otherwise immaculate rearguard, one of South Africa's linchpins has given it away with a surfeit of aggression! The shot was on, insofar as he had to hit it somewhere, so why not to the rope, but the trap was also set!"
"over the wicket, looped into the toes, and solid in defence"
"padded away, and <B>England are very excited about this!</B> Did the ball roll up his body and flick the glove through to silly point? We are going to the <B>review</B>... nope, that looks like elbow ... nope, <B>it's not even elbow! </B>Missed everything by a foot! Whoops ..."
"full face of the bat, pressed towards the two close catchers in the covers. Suddenly, there's a different texture to this contest"
"outside off, rising off the deck and through to the keeper"
"speared into the toes, short leg is alert to grab an attempted clip with a sprawl to his left"
"outside off, no stroke offered once more"
stabbed out to point as vdD hops across his crease to defend on a fifth-stump line
"banged in short, and through to the keeper. Another over notched off. It's a ball-by-ball game, as Dean Elgar put it last night..."
"twirled into the blockhole, and pushed back down the wicket"
"outside off, squeezed to silly point with a firm press of the bat"
"head right over the ball, smothering all intent"
"well bowled again, tossed up again, and Philander leans forward to kill the spin"

"right back onto the stumps, defended down into the turf, and <strong>watch that backspin ... </strong> Safe enough in the end"
"back and across, standing tall to push to short cover"
"outside off, left alone with a big flourish, a minor jag off the deck but nothing extravagant"
"leaning out of the crease, kneeling into a forward press"
tapped into the leg side
"very full, dipping into the blockhole as Rassie dead-bats it back down the pitch"
"<B>good leave in the end!</B> Broad jags one back from a tight line and grazes the outside of off stump (metaphorically) to collective oohs from the cordon, and elsewhere!"
"leaning forward with low hands, pushed to the on side"
"stabbed off the pads to short backward square. Two men catching on the off side, two on the leg"
"tossed up, a fraction too short, and turning down the leg side"
back and across to defend
cracked into the covers with a flourish
"this one <strong>bites and bounces</strong>, spits into the glove, though without enough venom to lob to leg gully"
"misdirected, fired down the leg side"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
"attacking the toes, right up to the blockhole. Dug out"
shoulders arms as this one doesn't get up much outside off
"fired into the legs, <strong>another utter sucker punch!</strong> The man had just been placed at leg gully, precisely for that steer off the toes, and he barely had to twitch as the ball plopped into Anderson's waiting hands! Jimmy had been at mid-on a moment earlier, I wonder if vdD had even twigged that gap had been plugged! Brilliant from England, thinking outside the box to a degree that has clearly taken their opponents by surprise"
"outside off, pounding the deck. Left alone"
"twirl on a probing length, blocked from the crease"
"back and across, fenced to short leg. A man comes in behind square to make it three close catchers on the leg side now"
solid press to mid-off
probing length from Bess but Philander's levers are equal to it
"head over the ball once more, defended"
"outside off, kicked away with gloves held high. Words exchanged between Philander and Buttler at the end of the over. The tension is mounting."
"pressed back down the pitch, as <B>Broad gets a second official warning for running on the danger area</B>. One more and he's off"
"wider line, as you'll expect. Solid in defence"
"leaping off the seam, hits the mythical crack and explodes towards the cordon. No danger of edging that!"
"banged in short, mixing it up nicely"
"full length, pressed into the covers with a dead-straight bat"
dabbed into the covers. 18 overs remain in the day!
"<B>zips past the outside edge!</B> Bess changes his angle to round the wicket, Philander plays for the turn as it slides straight on"
"oooh, aggro from Philander! The close field like that, a bottom-handed shovel back down the track"
low full toss .... rubbish gets wickets ... but not this time as Philander bashes back to the bowler
"conventionally forward, big stretch to the pitch to smother the spin"
"outside off, big grunt of effort, silly point gathers"
"on the back foot, nudged to short leg. Gutsy in defence, as another over ticks by"
"swinging away, fairly gently, outside off. No stroke"
attacking the pads on a full length. Ridiculous mid-on gathers a defensive push
"full length, fourth-stump line. Solid dead-batted thump of bat"
patted back down the line of the ball
"up on the toes, fenced out to point as Pretorius slides in behind the line"
"<strong>a waft outside off!</strong> Goodness that was close! A rare delivery that kicked off the seam, jagging away from Stokes' natural angle into the right-hander. Nearly!"
"stabbed back down the track, as Bess rips one into the splice. Did well to middle it, else silly point might have been in play"
"good areas from Bess, bowling to his field as Philander props forward"
"another full toss, slapped back to the bowler who gets one hand down in defence"
"wheeling away, testing those defences... nothing giving yet..."
"<B>smoked through the covers!</b> South Africa's first runs for donkeys' years, creamed along the turf as Bess over-pitches by an inch"
"<B>hard-handed jab, and so close to short leg!</B> Flew at pace, but perfectly bissected the gap on the leg side. Philander breathes, as <B>drinks</B> come out to the middle."
"Stokes steams in and bangs down a short ball, heading leg side as Pretorius moves across"
"oooh, <b>a wobbly waft!</b> Length ball, jagging away at 141kph/88mph and Pretorius feels for it"
"<b>even better, straightening at 146kph/90mph</b>, over the top of off stump as the batsman plays inside!"
"<b>shooter, but he keeps it out!</b> Pretorius did so well to get the bat down there, as England's fielders threw hands to heads"
"shortish and reversing away at 140kph/87mph, again beats the groping bat"
"banged in short and defended in front oft he stumps, Pretorius survives"
pushed through on the stumps and tapped to leg
"goes fuller, Philander is coming forward and taps it away"
"on off stump, blocked solidly"
lobbed up full outside of the eyeline and Philander presses out
"very full, jams the bat down on it, squirted past silly point"
"flighted, wide of off stump and Big Vern steers this away through point... but he declines the single. Has Pretorius volunteered to see off Stokes?"
"short of a length, heading leg side and blocked capably"
"back of a length, 135kph/83mph and blocked solidly on off"
"<b>Stokes gets his man!</b> Steered to slip, England erupt! Finally he gets the outside edge, the ball sails low to the right of first slip, where Root scoops it up! Newlands is echoing to Barmy Army cheers as Pretorius slopes off, leaving SA eight down"
"<b>taken first ball, juggled at third slip!</b> Crawley was the man to palm it up at the first chance, then pluck it casual as you like while sitting on the turf! Bang-bang from Stokes and England are on the brink! #SCENES"
"round the wicket, <b>144kph/89mph full toss</b>, Rabada bunts it back through mid-on... but they don't run and it won't go all the way to the rope"
"over the wicket, short of a length around off stump and Rabada gets in behind it"
shouts of 'catch!' as the ball ricochets up off a close fielder
tossed up and met on the front foot
"flighted, spinning in and Philander is well forward to smother it"
"pushed through outside off, Philander steers it into the turf wide of slip"
"flighted, spinning in and defended"
"tossed up, bit of width and Philander crunches it through the covers for four... England not too bothered about that, Philander ran the one hoping that it wouldn't go"
"round the wicket, back of a length and seaming in to hit the thigh pad"
"bangs down the bumper, 132kph/82mph and sailing through above the ducking Rabada"
"good length and squirted away through midwicket with a close bat face, they take one"
"short ball over middle and off, 138kph/86mph and he defends calmly"
"digs in the bouncer, wide of the off stump and Philander sways out of the way"
"pitched up on off stump, 143kph/89mph and Philander blocks it to the man in the covers"

"length outside off, 142kph/88mph and holding its line, no need to follow this one"
"hits a good length in the channel, 136kph and this one comes back with the arm, again he's able to leave"
"fenced to gully! <b>STOKES DOES IT!!</b> Fierce length, rising like the kraken, smashes the upraised glove and the catch is gleefully accepted! Philander's last stand is in a losing cause, England succeed in sacking Fortress Newlands, and it is their man of 2019 who brings them a first victory of 2020"
