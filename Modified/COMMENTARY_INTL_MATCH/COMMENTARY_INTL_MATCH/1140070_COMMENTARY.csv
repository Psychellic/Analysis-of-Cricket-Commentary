"appeal for lbw as this angles back in from wide of the crease to crash into the pad. May have been been sliding down leg? Babar looked to flick but missed it completely. Mohammed went up for a referral, a very optimistic one. Can't overturn that because more than half the delivery should've hit the stumps. <strong>Hawkeye shows this would've clipped.</strong>  On-field call stays, but they won't lose the review"
