"starts off with a gimme ball, too short on leg stump and an easy putaway for Dhawan, who has to place his paddle-pull past square leg"
"length ball, patted to mid-off"
"misses the slog across the line and is struck on the pads going down on his knees, but that ball pitched outside leg"
"<b>good stop by Miller at extra cover</b>. Fuller on the stumps, and Dhawan timed it sweetly but Miller moved to his right and dived to save the ball."
"<b>huge appeal for lbw</b> but I think it was going down. De Kock seems to agree and opts against the review. Oooh, on replays it looks closer. Spun into Rohit sharply from a length and caught him on the crease, hitting his back pad. Still think it would have been not out on review, but possibly on umpire's call. We'll have to wait for the ball-tracking to confirm"
"fuller on the stumps, turned to midwicket for a quick single"
starts off with one straying down leg and he'll have to re-bowl that
"that's a rubbish ball, short and waaay down leg side, so that even a diving de Kock can't get to it. Pitched far down leg and was going further away"
"<b>a third wide in a row!</b> down leg side again, getting some movement, but can't seem to get his radar right, Rabada"
"finally one on the stumps, fuller length on leg stump. Tries to flick it away but it rolls off the pad towards square leg"
"length ball on leg stump, worked to fine leg from the crease"
"<b>creamed</b> over cover. Fullish outside off, same spot roughly that he was bowling to Dhawan, but it's the right-hander Rohit on strike and he carves it over cover with a full swing of the bat"
this one is even better! Full outside off and he transfers weight forward to stroke this past extra cover with exquisite timing
"finally a good ball from Rabada, back of a length and moving away. Rohit tries to flay it with static feet but doesn't connect"
"length outside off, and he opens the face to send it over point. Third man collects on the bounce"
"angling well across Rohit, who leaves it alone outside off"
"<b>got him in the slips!</b> Rohit was stuck on the crease, probably thinking about the ball coming in. Great bowling by Hendricks, who pulls his line a lot straighter. Rohit jabs at it, but it holds its line, going with the angle to fly off the outside edge to a waiting Reeza Hendricks."
"fullish on the stumps, driven confidently to mid-off"
straighter line and Kohli deals with it by moving across and tucking it to square leg
"tight single, but they make it. Good ball, nipping in off a length and Dhawan jabs it towards point, who rushes in and under-arms it but misses the stumps"
"and Hendricks goes across the right hander again but Kohli plays it close to his body, moving across and pushes it into the offside"
"starts off with a short ball on the stumps, Dhawan rocks back to pull but doesn't time it well. Carries over the in-field though so they'll get a single"
"<b>thick edge falls short of third man</b>. Kohli had a good old heave-ho at it, was targetting downtown Bangalore. Full and wide outside off, he threw his hands at it. The hand came off the bat"
"that's some timing by Dhawan. Moves very far across and Andile follows him with a length ball, but it comes slowly off the pitch and Dhawan just stands still and punches straight"
"down the track, giving himself room and gets four - but not where he intended. It's a thick edge that flies very fine. India are attacking Andile, and getting the runs, but not at all times where they intend to"
"length ball, punched to mid-off"
"good length on a tight line outside off, possibly came off the pitch a bit quicker than Kohli expected as he was late on his attempted flick, ends up dropping it near his feet"
"another wide ball, too far from de Kock who is diving to his left and gets a glove to it. That slows it down enough for Rabada to run across at third man and dive to prevent the boundary. Pitched well outside off and was moving further away"
"great follow up, on target bouncer with Dhawan taking a step down the track. Goes whistling past to the keeper as Dhawan tries to adjust and upper cut"
"great ball again, moving away off the seam from the off stump to have Dhawan feeling for it and having a waft"
"moving across and that's good bowling again, a yorker on the toes, which Dhawan can only squirt out to mid-on"
slightly short and Kohli goes on the back foot to pull to deep square leg
"length ball on a tight line, gets it up to Dhawan's waist. He stays in his crease and flays it to cover"
"gets another bouncer on target, and Dhawan is looking to be aggressive, takes him on, but doesn't really connect with the hook. Didn't try to over-hit it though so it falls safe, where the man at deep square leg collects"
"up and over! Fuller and in the slot outside off, takes a step forward and lifts this way over long-on, clean swing of the bat, great connection"
"<b>you send a man to long-on, I'll go over long-off</b> says Dhawan. Skips down the track, gets to the pitch and lofts it over. Sweet timing on that"
""
"misses the sweep and it rolls off the pad to fine leg. Loud appeal but no review. And replays show it might have pitched outside leg, was spinning back in"
"fuller on the stumps, driven to mid-off"
"fuller on the stumps, takes a step forward and clips it but straight back to the bowler"
"back of a length on off stump, goes deep in his crease and works it to long-on"
"down the track, and is that a <b>drop</b>? Kohli drills this flighted ball straight back at the bowler, at around shin height. Gets down quickly, and gets both hands to it, but the ball is hit so hard it just bounces off his palm before he can close his fingers around it"
"bam. Flat length ball on leg stump, and Dhawan is quickly down on one knee to sweep it hard through backward square leg"
"back of a length on off stump, chopped towards backward point"
"sees him stepping out and shortens his length on off stump. Stops on Dhawan a bit as he looks to punch towards long-off, and it travels a little uppishly, but too far to the right of the bowler for him to make a serious attempt"
"on the shorter side of a good length, angling into the stumps, punched down to long-on"
"down the track and Shamsi fires it flat at his feet to deny him swinging room. Driven firmly to long-off, all along the ground"
"down the track comes Dhawan once more, and that's a nice bit of bowling. Perhaps he gave Shamsi too early a sighter, and he slowed it down and pulled his length back a bit. Dhawan is not as close to the pitch of it as he'd like. He wants to hit it over long-off, but the ball stops and turns and he slices it high in the air, over extra-cover, where Phehlukwayo backtracks, catches it, and holds onto the ball while falling over backwards"
"back of a length on leg stump, worked away through square leg"
"flat length ball outside off, the wrong'un. Pant presses forward, shaping for the dab to third man, looking for the stock ball. Adjusts late and pushes into the covers instead"
"a bit fuller, on the stumps, worked away to deep square leg"
"flighted and full on off stump, whipped with the turn to deep midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, gets back and across and tucks it to deep backward square leg"
back of a length on off stump. Lets it come on and dabs gently into the cover point region
"gone, Kohli departs, going for the aggressive option again - a clear sign of India looking to add more urgency to their T20 game. It's fairly full, angling into middle and leg, and Kohli whips it high in the air, to the left of deep square leg, and Bavuma, running to his left on the edge of the boundary, does very well to keep his feet inside the rope as he completes his catch, despite his momentum threatening to take him over. Didn't time it as well as he'd have liked, Kohli"
"length ball on middle and off, clipped to midwicket"
"shot! Full-toss, perhaps getting the attempted yorker wrong, and Pant whips it from just outside off stump, to the left of midwicket"
"back of a length, close to off stump, lets it come on and dabs gently into the point region"
"shortish outside off, grips and turns sharply. Was looking to push into the covers initially, but then he pulled out of the shot as he saw the ball rip away from him"
"flat length ball outside off, steps across and drops down to one knee to flick-sweep on the bounce to the left of deep square leg"
"wrong'un, pitched fairly full outside off. Gets nicely forward to drive to long-off"
"in the blockhole, just outside off stump. Was initially shaping to play that to long-on with a straight bat, but chose in the end to jab into the covers, and not risk a leading edge"
"flat length ball outside off. Steps across and plays another odd-looking flick through backward square leg, this time all along the ground"
"loopy and very full on off and middle. Wants to step across and clip through midwicket, but doesn't place it as square as he'd like, and Shamsi runs after it and cuts off the single"
"shortish slower ball just outside leg. No pace on it to really swivel and pull fine on the leg side. Hits the glove instead, and the ball drops just short of de Kock diving right for the catch"
"short again, on leg stump, pulled to the left of deep square leg"
"back of a length close to off stump, opens his bat face and steers it through backward point"
"back of a length, slanting across the left-hander. Waits on it and cuts to the left of third man"
"back of a length on off stump, slower one. Wants to use the pace and steer it past backward point, but there isn't enough of it and the fielder can move in and cut it off"
"shorter still, and again he's rolled his fingers over it to take all the pace off. Looks to pull, ends up under-edging into the ground, and it rolls backwards, a foot or so wide of off stump"
"length ball angling across to off stump. Presses forward and pushes gently, square on the off side, and both batsmen immediately set off for the quick single"
"slower length ball outside off, sliced uppishly towards sweeper cover"
"fullish on off stump, shows the full face and punches to mid-off"
"slower length ball, pitching on off stump and angling away. Pushes forward and looks for another soft-hands single, but this time the ball rolls too quickly towards backward point"
"shorter now, close to off stump, slapped to backward point"
"what a shot. He invites flak when it doesn't come off, but when it does, wow. It's a length ball on leg stump, and he gets down quickly on his back knee and half-sweeps, half-scoops it over the fine leg boundary. To be able to hit the ball in that direction - actually hit it rather than just use the pace and help it along - requires a phenomenal amount of skill"
"down the track to the flighted ball on off stump, flat-batted firmly to long-off"
"steps out, maybe a touch too early, and Fortuin flattens his trajectory and shortens his length on off stump. Clipped gently into the wide mid-on region"
"fired in flat on middle stump, and Iyer opens up at the hip and swipes it down to long-on"
"gone. That was pretty clever from Fortuin, slanting it across Pant from left-arm round and bowling it wide of off stump, making him reach for the ball. Had the field for it too, with sweeper cover back and long-off quite wide. Wanted to launch that over long-off, but the ball didn't turn as much as he expected and he sliced it wider than intended. Long-off moves to his right and takes a simple catch"
"flat and full at leg stump, and he clears his front leg and drives it powerfully, along the ground, to long-on"
"got him! Iyer jumps down the pitch, and Fortuin saw him coming. He fired it flat and full down the leg side, and by the time Iyer could bring his bat down and try to flick it, it was already past him and on its way towards Quinton de Kock's gloves. Smart bit of bowling again from Fortuin"
"flat, at the pads, worked away through midwicket"
"shortish, not too much width, waits on it and chops it to the right of backward point, where Fortuin dives right and gets a hand to the ball but can't bring it under control"
"full on off stump, driven to extra-cover"
"once again some flight, on off stump. Driven firmly to the left of extra-cover, where the fielder dives and gets a hand to the ball but can't stop the single"
"flat on the pads, clipped to deep backward square leg"
quick turn outside off. Not short enough to cut and the ball beats his bat
"turn again. Flat and full, fired into the pads, and he looks to flick and ends up sending a leading edge into the backward point region"
"shortish outside off, Hardik's feet aren't really moving and he's beaten trying to punch through the covers"
"shortish again, steps back and across now and slaps to sweeper cover"
"edged, and Hendricks strikes again! He's been getting the ball to seam around and bounce today, and this is a good ball, back of a length in the corridor and straightening away from the left-hander. Looks to guide it towards third man, maybe, and only manages a thin edge to the keeper"
"similar ball to the one that got Krunal, but Jadeja has been playing a lot of Test cricket lately and he pulls his bat inside the line and allows himself to be beaten"
"again that seam movement and bounce in the corridor, and Jadeja plays and misses, looking to defend off the back foot"
"shortish, angling into the stumps, steps across and tucks it away to fine leg"
"a bit of luck for Jadeja. Length ball close to off stump, and it nips away slightly as Jadeja looks to push through mid-off while being slow getting onto the front foot. Thick edge runs away through where a slip may have been"
"length ball angling into middle stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"length ball on off stump, and all kinds of confusion as Jadeja looks for the quick single after pushing towards mid-off. Bavuma, sprinting quickly towards the ball from extra-cover and throwing himself at it, contributes to the mix-up, with Hardik sending Jadeja back. In the end, all's well"
"back of a length on off stump, dabbed down to third man"
"fullish on off stump, punched firmly back to the bowler"
"interesting. Hardik made an incredibly early trigger movement, his back foot going deep into the crease and across to off stump, when Phehlukwayo was still in his run-up. The bowler knew he would look for the big hit over the on side, and bowled a full, loopy slower ball outside off. Hardik swung hard, but missed"
"back of a length on off stump, lets it come and drops it gently into the off side for the quick single"
"short, a bit of width, slapped to deep point"
"down the track and Hendricks shortens his length on off stump. Looks to swipe through midwicket, ends up inside-edging into his body and the ball rolls away slowly into the covers"
"very full, slanting away from off stump. Looks to jam his bat down and force it through point, but can't connect"
hits a hard length on off stump and Hardik - in that ready position with his back leg deep in the crease - can't get the room to free his arms. Jabbed down the ground to long-on
"short now, gets up to shoulder height, and Jadeja swivels to pull through backward square leg"
"back of a length on off stump. Looks to make room but can't make enough, and he chops to backward point"
"length ball close to off stump, and Jadeja finally puts one away. Clears his front leg and launches it straight back, high over the umpire's head"
back of a length on middle stump - he knows Jadeja is looking to make himself room. Lets it come and dabs gently into the covers
"slower bouncer, fairly wide of off. Again Hardik made that early trigger move, and he looked to pull it away but the spongy bounce off the surface beat him on this occasion"
"on a length on middle stump, punched with a straight bat through midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, gets behind the line to work it into the square leg region"
"down the track as Phehlukwayo floats a fullish one away from off stump. Flat-batted into the covers, no real timing"
"Phehlukwayo has dealt with Hardik's hitting threat very well so far. Again goes deep in his crease, open at the hips, looking to hit over the leg side. Gets a slower ball, back of a length and wide of off stump. Looks to hit over the covers but can only slice it in the air, without much timing, on the bounce to the right of deep point"
"again he's back and across well in advance, and again Phehlukwayo goes for the slower one outside off. Big swing and a miss"
"slower short ball outside off, pulled along the ground to long-on"
"slower ball, full on middle and off, swiped along the ground to deep midwicket"
"shot. Another slowie, on a length, but far too wide of off stump on this occasion. Pandya holds his shape on this occasion and slaps it firmly to the right of extra-cover, generating enough power to beat long-off easily to his left"
"length ball angling across to off stump, and Jadeja clears his front leg and looks for the big hoick over the leg side. He sends it high in the air, off the top edge, and Rabada calls for it himself, runs towards where a short midwicket might be, and does well to catch it. That went reeeeeaaaaallly high and gained plenty of speed as it descended"
"full slower ball, angling in towards off stump. Doesn't miss off stump by much after Hardik swings and misses, looking to hit over midwicket"
"full on off stump, whipped in the air, on the bounce, to deep midwicket"
"shot! Was initially shaping to step across his stumps and aim towards fine leg, but he didn't commit fully. Rabada bowled it short and at pace, over off stump, and Washington leaned back and ramped it crisply over the keeper"
"run-out, going for the bye. The perils of last-over batting. Short, down the leg side, and he swings and misses. Hardik calls for the bye, and he responds, but he's a long way out as de Kock passes it to Rabada and the bowler throws down the stumps at his end"
"now Hardik holes out. Fullish, angling into the stumps, and he can't get enough power on this attempt at a whipped six, ends up picking out long-on"
"slower one, angling into leg stump. Saini, looking to make room and carve over the covers, misses, and they chance a bye and get it, de Kock missing the stumps at his end with an underarm flick"
"some turn first up from a length outside off, tickled round the corner off his pads"
"it is a driving length, but de Kock's timing and execution mean it races through cover point for a boundary"
"length ball, quicker on the stumps, punched to cover"
"fuller, angling into him, turned to midwicket, where Hardik fires in a return throw"
"flatter and darting in, worked off the back foot to mid-on"
"fuller on the stumps, punch-driven to cover, where Rohit dives to his right to pull off a good save"
"it's all happening - a steered edge that bounces to slip, and Kohli throws down the stumps at the striker's end seeing de Kock look for a run, but the batsman gets back in time"
"length ball outside off, coming in a touch, steered to the man on the point boundary"
"oooh that's some nice movement away from the right-hander. Chahar thinks there's a nick, but he's the only one who does. Length ball that might have been there to be punched through cover even with feet static if it was straight but it was jagging away and beat the bat"
"swing for Chahar and the batsman is beaten completely. In the channel and moves away, but he's played that with bat close to body, inside the line and resisted the temptation to follow the ball"
"length ball on off, pushed back to the bowler"
"fuller, and this one is coming back in after he's taken the others away. Full enough to drive though, but he can't pierce the gap and it's straight to cover"
"given some air, fuller on off, he stays low and chops it to backward point"
flighted again from wide of off but yorker length and Rassie can only bunt it to mid-on.
"nice turn and rapped on the pads but that's going down leg. comes in with the angle, and he plays around it, hits his pad, but hits it outside leg and going further down"
"if you can beat Jadeja in the field you have to have hit it well - and that's what de Kock's done. Laced through cover with exquisite timing and though Jadeja is sprinting from a widish long-off, even he can't get to it quick enough to stop it"
""
"slightly short of a length and he goes back to whip it, but misses and is hit on the pads - clearly going down leg"
"length ball outside off, stays on the back foot to push this to extra cover. not timed well so they get a single"
"length on off, flourishing drive but there's a packed off-side cordon and he can't pierce it"
"backing away, and Chahar keeps it on a length outside off. The ball isn't coming on and de Kock only toe-ends it towards cover"
"back of a length, and the ball swings back in sharply as de Kock looks to stay leg-side of the ball and stab through the covers, beats his inside edge, and skims over the top of leg stump"
"back of a length, more off-stumpish this time. Jabbed into the point region"
"bad ball. He gets it to swing away from the batsman, but starts it too wide, and on a shortish length too. Reeza stands tall and slaps it authoritatively through cover point"
"<b>wham</b>. Length ball on leg stump that hardly bounced, and de Kock did his stand and deliver routine, clearing his leg and whacking this over deep square leg"
"under edge goes past leg stump and brilliant work by Pant to hare across and stop the ball. Good ball, quick one back of a length and de Kock was backing away, but too close to cut. He plays it with a horizontal bat"
"oh that one's just dismissive. Too short and he opens his hips, rocks back and pulls mightily over square leg. Deflating to see that as a bowler"
"still back of a length and he goes back to pull once again. Doesn't quite nail it though, and deep midwicket is able to run around and field"
"good length in the channel, coming in a touch, stays in his crease and opens the bat face to steer to short third man's left"
"brilliant fielding by Iyer at cover. Too short and going across, de Kock lashes it powerfully off the back foot and that seemed headed for the cover boundary but Iyer dives full length to his right and stops the ball"
"angles across him and ends up well wide of off stump, de Kock throws his bat at it and sends it to deep point"
"that's a bad ball and put away. too short, and sits up, and he pulls it with force to the midwicket boundary"
"gets some shape into the right hander but gets the line wrong, and strays down leg. He'll have to re-bowl that"
"hit on the pads and <b>they've gone for a review</b>. Deepak Chahar was convinced and told Kohli to go for it, but I think that was going down leg. Change of pace but still swing and beats him completely, but he's struck the pad outside leg stump! And going further down. That was never going to be out"
"bowls a good surprise bouncer but de Kock is seeing them so well and able to play late so he stays still and upper cuts it, though he can't beat short third man"
"length ball angling across, de Kock gets down low and strokes it through cover"
"another bouncer, but dealt with well, pulled in front of square from outside off, but there's protection there"
sneaks in under the bat. Given a rip but goes straight on outside off and he misses the cut
"too short and though it's turning, he has plenty of time to see it and smash it, pulling between deep midwicket and deep square leg for a boundary"
gets on the front foot to sweep it through midwicket
"good length on off, spinning away, he's backing away to make room and punches, but straight to cover"
"<b>loud appeal</b>but there's no review left! That looked way closer than the one on which the review was lost. He was going across to sweep and was beaten, pitched on middle and leg and turned a mite to strike him on the pad"
"backing away to give himself room but Washington follows him to deny room, and de Kock jabs it away from closer to his body than he would have liked through cover"
"nicely struck, but there is protection at deep midwicket. Went down to sweep hard and connected well"
"slightly short of a length outside off and he's gone back in his crease to give him the space to punch through cover. Iyer has to run around to his right and slide and save. Oh wait, that's a four! He couldn't push the ball away before his foot brushed the advertising triangles on the boundary"
"flatter and wider outside off, slapped through the offside"
"length ball on the stumps, but de Kock backs away to square drive this through point"
"stopped on him a bit and popped in the air, but well to the right of the bowler. Length ball, he goes back and across to push. It hangs in the air and goes to long-on"
"wide, but that ball was doing things. Pitched outside leg and turning away, sharp turn and steep bounce, making it a difficult fumbling take for Pant"
"brings out the reverse sweep and nails it sweetly through point, but there is a man deep who cuts it off"
"good length, spinning in from outside off, pushes it through cover-point with his hands going through"
"not that short, but de Kock goes deep in his crease and absolutely leathers this over long-on. Pure force, rather than timing and clears the boundary"
"given a bit more air, but drifts down leg and is tickled to backward square leg"
"ooh that's a quick one, 97 kph and beats the attempted cut outside off"
"that one skids on from outside off, but he's playing him by going deep and across and whacking it from in front of his pads. Does that and gets it through midwicket"
"good length angling in on middle and leg, turned to short fine leg"
"popped up in the air but safe. de Kock goes well across and tries to flick it, intended to go more square but the ball's stopping on occasion and he pops it into a vacant deep mid-on region"
eased down to long-on
"tossed up, well wide of off, he goes down on one knee to try and drive through extra cover. Gets it lower on the bat and mistimes it to long-off"
goes back and across to tuck this to short fine
"flatter outside off, goes for the big heave, fetching the sweep from there, but doesn't connect cleanly. Sends it rolling through midwicket"
keeps going deep in his crease to flick it from in front of the stumps into the short fine leg area
"<b>brilliant catch by Kohli at mid-on</b>. Dug this into the pitch, and those are not coming on. Reeza tries to fetch the pull from outside off but has no power or timing on it. Kohli moves forward, anticipating well and then dives in front to pluck it low. Excellently done"
"new man, feet not moving perfectly in alignment as they should, he lunges forward to drive and gets a thick edge that rolls to fine third man"
"too short, and you can't bowl those gimme balls to de Kock when he's in this touch. Sits up to be whacked and de Kock obliges, carting it to the backward square leg boundary"
"better length and tighter line, on the stumps, pushed to mid-off"
"slower ball but loses his radar. Digs it into the pitch short, but it grips and turns a long way. Was the off-cutter but got turn like a spinner and ended up wide of de Kock outside off"
"inside out cover drive from down on one knee and what a way to raise <b>fifty</b>. He's done pretty much what he wanted with the bowling apart from that slightly fortuitous lbw reprieve. This was another off cutter but not as short and not as wide of the stumps, allowing him to pull off the stroke"
quick bouncer to end after a couple of slower balls and he beats the batsman's attempted pull
"full shaping into him, driven crisply back and the bowler fields"
"brilliant stop by Rohit at slip. The ball is clearly gripping on the pitch because this was a healthy edge, but bounced well in front of Rohit, who dives to his right and stopped it nevertheless"
"nicely done, walks across and forward to flick this off his pads to deep square leg."
"that's even better. Fuller length and he converts it to driving length by taking a decisive step forward and going inside out, driving over extra cover and into the fence"
"the pressure tells and he bowls a full toss on the pads, which Bavuma elegantly flicks to the deep midwicket boundary"
"back of a length, steered to point"
"finds that tough back of a length outside off that sucks the pace out of the ball, de Kock slaps it from outside off but can't go past the in-field"
"and now he goes short and across, it grips hard but goes too far wide of off and is a wide"
"de Kock knows what's coming, and he just dismisses it. Another back of length ball on the stumps, he's waiting for that line and he opens his hips and swings his bat in a pleasing arc to cart this over square leg"
"the bowler compensates by going outside off, back of a length and de Kock seems to have read his mind because he's in position early and flat bats a drive over extra cover"
"length ball closer to off stump, punched to cover"
too short again and de Kock unleashes a pull but keeps it down this time so only a single to deep square
"fuller on the stumps, turned from the crease towards midwicket"
"fuller on off, and he spots the length early, goes down and paddles it fine"
"fuller again, Bavuma enjoys the sweep shot and he fetches it from outside off, times it sweetly to deep square leg"
"whipped off his hips to deep square leg, from slightly short of length"
"just short of cover. A bit early into the shot, or the ball just stopped a bit and he punches it. Falls short of the fielder"
"hisses past the outside edge. On a length and he's coming forward to push, but is beaten with sharp turn"
tries the reverse sweep but connects only with air to a full one outside off
"regal stuff by de Kock. full and wide outside off, goes down on one knee and unleashes a cover drive that goes over the in-field pings into the fence"
slapped past point
"slip won't come into play with that length, full and darting into him, flicked off his toes to deep midwicket"
"slog-sweep time, and that's another one nailed to perfection. Confident step forward goes down on one knee having picked the length early and corks it over deep midwicket"
pulls through midwicket and that's the second consecutive <b>fifty-run stand</b>
"good length outside off, Bavuma stays inside the line and pushes it to point's right"
"reverse sweep to one that is pitched on leg, but he can't go past short third man"
there's that bounce and turn. On a length and grips and spins past the bat
a bit short and he stays back to punch this through cover
"goes back and works this off his pads to short fine leg, using his wrists"
"paddled fine, fetched from outside off, to fine leg"
"quicker and flatter on off, tapped to deep midwicket"
slightly short of a length and de Kock was looking to pull through midwicket but gets it a bit higher on the bat to send it rolling to long-on
"angled in on the stumps, defended solidly on the front foot"
"fuller on the stumps, and he paddles it fine once again, nicely done, to fine leg. Scores level"
"fuller on the stumps, flicked to square leg. But they won't win yet because Jadeja swoops in and rifles a throw to the keeper"
"finishes it in style! Short ball and he rocks back and pulls it powerfully and with good connection, muscling it over wide long-on"
