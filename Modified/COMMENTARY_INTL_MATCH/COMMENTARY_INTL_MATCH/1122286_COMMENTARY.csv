"absolutely dead in front? Yes, says the umpire. But Dhawan reviews right away. <b>Did he get some bat on that</b>? It's a ball that swings in, around middle and leg, the ball swings back quite a bit, takes the inside edge and then onto the pad. So a big inside edge, a decision overturned first ball. The benefits of reviews in T20Is. Good news for SA is that there is swing early."
"and again, more swing. 136 kph, good length on leg. The ball bounces and moves back in, hits Dhawan in front of leg, on the thigh pad. Excellent start for SA"
"135 kph, a wild swing from Dhawan and he wears the ball again! Full on leg, the ball moves back and hits Dhawan on the back leg, the ball was swinging too much."
"AND AGAIN! What a start today. Full on middle and leg, the ball pitches, moves back in and takes a thick inside edge of Dhawan's bat again, and then onto the back pad. Four replays in four balls"
"the first ball that is slightly wider, good length outside off, Dhawan awkwardly leaves that one"
"maiden from Morris. If SA wanted a good start, they have it. And it's not like Dhawan didn't try to score. A low full toss is bunted to cover. Excellent start."
"139 kph, plumb in front this time! No review from Rohit and that's SA's first. This has been some start from the hosts. They have been bowling it full, enticing some swing, and the conditions haven't let them down. Pitched full outside off, it seams back in prodigiously to hit Rohit in front of middle and leg. A golden duck for Rohit. Not much he could do with that delivery. Has to accept the luck of the draw."
"135 kph, full delivery outside off, driven to cover. A long stride"
"India's first runs. 137 kph, full and wide outside off, sliced off the open half towards point for a couple. Nice timing too"
"137 kph, edged for four. Full and wide delivery outside off, Raina's back foot stays where it is, the balance is back, the ball moves away, takes the outside edge and flies past second slip. Raina, perched on the back foot, waiting for the short one"
"back of a length outside off, tapped away towards point."
"too full, so full that it didn't even need feet movement, to Raina's glee. He stays where he is and times a bunt through mid-off for a couple. Slow outfield due to the rain, it's pulled in."
"a tad short and Dhawan picks that length so early, he stays back and then swats a pull through midwicket without any trouble. It's the length India are waiting for, but SA need to be much, much fuller"
"Highveld air. That's the way to play on this ground. It's short again, Dhawan goes from bottom to top, gets underneath the length and pulls it into the grass banks over backward square leg. Too easy"
"short again, short and wide, Dhawan cuts easily through point. It's an easy put-away with that length. Morris has got to adjust, limit this over's damage"
"133 kph, a slower delivery well down leg, Dhawan misses a simple clip, takes the pad en route to the keeper. Dhawan says 'yeah', Raina says 'nahh'"
"after a maiden, this is turning out to be a shocking over. A slower ball down leg, would you like it anywhere else? Dhawan picks the length, the short length, and then pulls easily over fine leg. Six more."
"goes full and there is no run. Full down leg, Dhawan misses a flick. Hits the pad, then towards midwicket. A muted appeal."
"well bowled, good start, on a length around off, fourth-stump channel. Raina is behind the line to defend"
"and again, the exact same delivery. On a length, on off, defended"
"flies away for four. It's not a bad delivery at all, good length just outside off. Raina backed away, opened his stance and cut that away through backward point with ease. That's a manufactured boundary"
"flat-batted to mid-off. A good length delivery around off, Raina backs away and slaps the ball to Behardien at mid-off. The ball hits him somewhere, <em>it's there</em>, it's painful"
"smashed through midwicket. Lots of shots. Full delivery outside off, Raina shuffles across and flicks the ball with immense power through midwicket"
"too straight and four more. Full, on the pads, Raina needs some bat, he finds it, and gets four to fine leg."
"88 kph, short around off, it sits up for Dhawan to rock back and pull through midwicket"
"aargh, it's worked. A low full toss around middle and off, Dhawan comes down, meets the ball before it pitches, looks to hit the ball through mid-on, but gets it too straight. The bat handle may have turned in his hands, the full toss may have taken him by surprise. One way or another, Dhawan has picked out mid-on!"
"tossed up outside off, some drift, Kohli looked to hit that through long-on, but the angle of the ball took it to mid-off"
"lots of flight on middle and leg, drilled to long-on"
"more slidery. Flat delivery down leg, the ball pitches and moves on, hits Raina on the pad as he misses a flick"
"and this one turns. Slow around off, not full, Raina gets forward, the ball spins and takes the outside half to point"
"excellent line, full around off, defended back with the head over the ball, and eyes on it."
"a 140 kph, length delivery around off. Fuller than that. Kohli sits in his crease and defends."
"gloved and gone! KOHLI FAILS! It's a snorter of a delivery, back of a length, some extra bounce and climb as the ball moves away too ever so slightly. That's all you need for a man in form (not too much movement to beat the bat). It bounces, takes the glove and carries low to Klaasen. It's another jaffa. Two of them today for two wickets."
"a full delivery outside off, driven to mid-off"
"back of a length around off, 138 kph, played towards cover with that awkward leg-side technique"
"good length around off, pushed away towards cover, 136 kph. Another maiden"
"flight outside off, punched to long-off with the direction of spin"
"a short delivery outside off, the ball sits up for Pandey to push to long-on"
"very full around middle. Raina flicks, against the spin. He offers very less of the bat, an inside edge into the pad, one to midwicket"
"lots of flight outside off, driven to long-on. Don't think SA will mind this too much."
"on middle and leg, worked away to square leg for one"
"slow down leg, the ball drifts down for a wide."
"the slog over midwicket for two, the Pandey swing. Tossed up on off, Pandey inside-halves that towards midwicket. Dala runs to his left and cuts the ball in, terrific effort"
"flat and wide outside off, cut away to deep point for a run"
"overly full around middle and off, another inside-half slog through square leg for a couple. Good relay work from Phehlukwayo and Behardien"
"flat and straight, Pandey walks across and works the ball to deep square leg"
"shortish and wide, the topspinner? Slapped to cover. 'Finish well here, Shammo,' says Klaasen"
"the googly on middle and leg, it spins in, not sure if Raina read that. Hits the pad towards square leg"
"86 kph, lots of flight outside off, hit away towards cover. Not great timing"
"a full delivery outside off, chopped away towards cover for a run. Good period of control for SA"
"a full delivery outside off, the ball moves on and beats the bat of Pandey, on the outside edge. 127 kph"
"a full delivery outside off, drilled to mid-off. No run there. The fielder picks up, and hurls a throw at the bowler's end. Misses. <strong>Out with a direct hit.</strong> Pandey even gave up"
"a full delivery down leg, a thick inside edge to short fine leg"
"edged for four. Breaks the pressure slightly. Good length delivery outside off, skids on. Pandey is still staying slightly leg side of the ball, so a thick outside edge races to third man"
"a shortish ball around middle, swatted to long-on for a single"
"in the gap for four. Not exactly a sweep, more a sweep-slog, not a slog-sweep. It's on middle and leg, Pandey is looking for the slog, but ends up morphing the stroke into a half-sweep, half-slog."
"a googly on off, Pandey uses his wrists to flick the ball through backward square leg for a couple"
"flat and wide, Pandey opens the face, and slices the ball to short third man"
"in the arc, and this is the trademark slog-sweep. He stays low, gets underneath the ball and then goes boom, over midwicket."
"six more. It doesn't matter if he's reading it or not with that length, full around off, Pandey gets underneath the slog-sweep and launches six over midwicket."
"a googly, shortish and wide, pulled to deep midwicket on the bounce. Good over for India, shifts the balance slightly."
back of a length and in at the pads. Goes deep in the crease and jams it into the square leg region
"offcutter in the corridor, goes back and opens the face to try and steer this. He's beaten"
backs away and launches this over extra cover. There's a skip down the track as well as he does this. It's a length ball on middle and he gets under it nicely
"<b>swipes across the line</b> and misses. Looks like a legcutter. It's a full ball on off stump, he walks across and swings to try and find the square leg boundary. There's a hint of this possibly sliding across and missing off, but it's not conclusive. Raina is convinced he's out, no review"
"length and in at middle stump, pushed to mid-on from the crease"
<b>inside edge</b> trickles past the keeper. Short of a length ball is too close for the cut
"good length on off stump, defended on the front foot into the covers"
"tossed up at off stump, steps out to meet it on the full and drives to long-on"
back of a length and flatter. Pushed at middle stump. Defended off the back foot

short of a length and in at middle stump. Steps out and gets cramped. Taps it back to the bowler
slower ball slapped to the wide square leg region. Shuffles backwards in the crease and makes room against this short ball at middle stump. Bisects deep square and deep midwicket
<b>top edge</b> is too fine for third man. That's one way of playing a climbing ball in the corridor. Opened the stance again and looked to pull it away
"slower ball, on a length at middle stump. Pushed through midwicket off the front foot"
"back of a length outside off, steered to point with an open face"
bouncer has Dhoni tangled up. It's climbing into his chest and he's looking to push this through square leg with soft hands. Appears to have got glove on it and it won't go too far away from pitch side
<b>one bounce</b> to long-on. Gets too close to this after stepping out and is forced to drag this from a middle stump line
"<b>hello!</b> Slap on a wig and you'll recognise this guy. Dancing down the track to a left-hander, getting leg side of the ball and spanking it straight and flat"

"back of a length on middle, steps out and pushes it back to the bowler after being beaten in flight"
"tossed up on middle stump, drilled with an angled bat past Dhoni. Straight to long-on"
"back of a length on leg stump, tapped to deep midwicket off the back foot"
slower ball at a length and in at middle stump. Steps out and looks to open the face for a single through cover. Gets an inside edge that allows two at midwicket
"full outside off, driven to sweeper's right and Pandey calls loudly for the second before completing it"
"short of a length outside off, leaps to cover the bounce and guides this to third man"
"slower ball short and wide outside off. Slapped powerfully, straight to sweeper"
"legcutter, back of a length on middle stump. Stands back in the crease and tickles this to short fine leg"
"sweetly timed cover drive, but he'll only get one to sweeper. <b>That's his fifty</b>. A performance far removed from what we saw in the first T20I"
"<b>cooooool</b> from Pandey, like a veteran tennis ball cricketer in a corporate league. Length ball outside off, settles behind this without having to move too much and swings a clean swing across the line. It's 15 yards into the crowd at midwicket"
"short ball outside off, slashes at this and can't get bat on it"
yorker tailing in at off stump. Squeezes it into the point region off the toe-end
<b>steps out</b> and leaves. We had a glimpse of young Dhoni in ODIs. This is an image from the longer format. Short of a length ball from Morris outside off
short and in at the chest. Looks to get on top of it but is stuck halfway as he hurriedly taps this into the leg side
"yorker on middle stump, squeezed to deep midwicket"
"back of a length at off stump, cramped as he looks to cut and it's a harmless tap to mid-off...who lines up and throws. No one backing up. Pandey gets four extra at long leg"

"back of a length on middle stump, dabbed through square leg"
"full on off stump, clears the front leg and drives to long-on"
"back of a length outside off, tapped to sweeper's left and Dhoni's call is '<i>nahi hoga</i>' (not possible) as Pandey looks for a second"
full and following him down leg. Swipes and gets it down to long-on
<b>ducks and then hooks</b> as he realises this is a slower ball. Dug in short and he makes room above his head before steering this towards the long leg boundary. Deep square puts in a slide
"<b>shot!</b> Stunning placement from Pandey. This length ball is climbing up outside off. He appears to have made too much room, but somehow he gets his hands under this and slices it over point. Sweeper dives to his left but that has skid across the turf after landing"
"nicely timed slice again, but he finds point. Short of a length outside off and he can't find the gap"
"Manish Pandey, murderer of spinners, inventor of wacky hooks. Gets inside the line of this, expecting a bouncer. He's given one. And it's slow. Moves all his weight into the off side and swivels as he lifts this over short fine"
"he's hitting it well. Only one this time. Length ball outside off, drilled on the up to sweeper cover"
"slower ball on a length at off stump, pushed back to the bowler"
yorker dug in nicely at off stump. He gets the front leg away but can only get this past his partner at the other end
<b>bisects deep midwicket and deep square.</b> Dhoni decides to get inside the line rather than make room. Morris misses the yorker and Dhoni whips this on the full

back of a length and following him down leg. He taps it to long-on on the up
<b>dropped at deep midwicket.</b> It's a short ball and he gets under this with the attempted pull. Dala runs to his right from deep midwicket and has it covered. But the ball slips through between his reverse cup and body
superb bowling. Yorks Dhoni and has him trying to balance as this dips in sharply. He'd stepped out. Completely beaten
"length ball on leg stump, gets the attempted slog off the inside half of the bat"
<b>six over extra cover!</b> He has walloped this short ball! It's an attempted legcutter and he gets his hands through this to send it over the boundary. Flat.
"<b>swatted past square leg</b> and it's four more. Full and angled in at leg stump. Gets the front leg out of the way, pivots on the back toe and uses the angle to get this to deep square"
"<b>inside edge</b> and it's four past short fine this time. Dhoni swinging hard, Dhoni succeeding. Length ball on off stump, nowhere near this ball and his head's not in the greatest of positions. But both fielders square on the leg side are in the circle and this is four from between them"
<b>falls short of Miller</b> at long-off as he dives forward and manages to parry it in front. Dhoni has <b>fifty</b>. This was a length ball outside off and he appears to have carved it
<b>short-arm whip</b> but he gets it straight to deep midwicket on the bounce. A full toss from the bowler on middle stump and he stands tall as he whips this. India have 103 runs off the last ten over

"good length outside off, punched towards cover from the crease. Tidy start"
"shortish delivery down leg, hurries Hendricks on the pull, takes the glove towards Dhoni."
"ooh, what was that? 114 kph, the knuckle ball? A short slower ball that is so slow that Smuts bails out of the pull very late"
"this is tidy bowling, on a length around middle, worked to midwicket for a run. Chahal is slightly deep, on the edge of the circle"
"full around middle and leg, pushed towards Unadkat at mid-on for a tight, but well-judged single."
"no pace at all, Smuts is through the shot too early, another slower ball outside off, the offcutter that keeps low and creeps underneath Smuts' bat"
"wow, shortish and wide outside off, some extra bounce as the ball bounces over the bat. Variable bounce is no batsman's friend"
"the first boundary of the innings. Full outside off, Hendricks is looking to go straight but the ball slices off the outside half over backward point"
"a legcutter-type slower ball down leg, clipped towards backward square leg for a single"
"another slower ball on middle and leg, worked away towards square leg for a single"
"over mid-on. Full around off, 123 kph, Hendricks gets underneath the length and lifts the ball easily over mid-on. Good, proactive batting. Not really his game, but he has to"
"a full delivery outside off, opens the bat face and guides to third man for a run"
"another slower ball, around off, Smuts is deceived again but improvises a checked push back"
"no man there, four. A full delivery outside off, Hendricks is trying to force that through cover, but the ball slices off the open half over backward point for four."
"poor ball, short and wide outside off, 120 kph, carved away towards the sweeper cover boundary. All timing on that."
"135 kph, back of a length outside off, carved off the open face to deep point for one more"
"140 kph, back of a length around middle and off, pulled to mid-on, on the bounce. SA falling behind DLS. All pressure with rain around."
"a slower ball does Smuts in, again! He was struggling right through his innings, another slower delivery from Unadkat. It pitches, comes on much slower because of the pace taken off from the ball. Smuts tries to bail out of the stroke but the ball still has an unhindered path to the leading edge of the bat, hits the edge and balloons to cover"
"more variable bounce. Good length outside off, keeps a tad low, passes the inside edge and then climbs towards Dhoni. A slow pitch made quicker because of the moisture around"
"swatted away over mid-on. There you go, DLS pressure. His first ball is a length delivery outside off. No sighters, Duminy clatters a swat over mid-on."
"a slower ball down leg, worked away into the gap through square leg for a couple more"
"undoubtedly <strong>playing for the DLS target now</strong>. A slower ball around off, Duminy helps this along behind square for a couple more."
"a slower ball around off, swatted away towards mid-on for a single."
"that's four. A slower ball, 133 kph, a wild heave from Hendricks, takes the thick outside edge and it flies over third man for four."
a short ball outside off that is far too wide for legality. WIDE!
"taken at deep square leg! What a play that was from Thakur. A slower ball around off and middle, Hendricks is through his shot too early, the ball takes the leading edge and travels all the way to deep square leg. Pandya takes the catch and runs off the field. We have a game now, and India are well ahead."
"a slower ball outside off, beats Klaasen on the outside edge"
"a slower ball around off, Klaasen stays in his crease and muscles a pull over midwicket for six. Way back. All about DLS."
"another slower ball outside off, Klaasen runs down and misses a wild swing. Kept quite low that one"
"whenever the bowlers have changed the pace, it's done something off the surface. Another slower ball outside off, creeps under Klaasen's attempted cut."
"another slower ball, but he picks that, stays in the crease and pulled over long-on. No feet movement. Who cares? It's thin, moist Highveld air, so it travels"
"a slower ball outside off, creeps underneath the cut again."
"short and wide outside off, tripe from Pandya, Duminy clatters a cut behind point for four. Sublime timing. But that's a poor ball"
"back of a length outside off, Duminy looks to pull but the ball goes underneath Duminy's pull. Wrong shot choice, another cut was surely the better option. But pressure ..."

"walks right across, it's darted in around off, shovelled to deep midwicket"
"flight around off, Duminy comes down and pushes the ball to long-on."
"that's six, and <strong>SA should creep ahead of the score now</strong>. Some flight around off, Klaasen gets underneath the length and smashes the ball over long-on."
"but Klaasen doesn't care. Some flight outside off, takes the leading edge and lobs towards third man for a couple. That's poor game awareness from Klaasen, you not only lose a wicket but go behind DLS with a wicket. You don't need to take a risk"

"slow down leg, worked away towards point for a run. SA are now above par"

"another wild heave. Full around off, a wild swing results in a thick inside edge towards deep square leg. Very good finish from Thakur."
"<b>oh yesssssssss.</b> Sensational from Klaasen. Walks into the leg side, makes a lot of room as he follows him with a loopy full one and then he caresses it over the extra cover boundary"
"makes room again, but this time it's short of a length. And very slow. Spins away from him and he just gets bat on this to tap it to long-off"
"length ball pushed flat outside off, on a good length. He drives to extra cover's right"

"it won't make a difference. Klaasen follows the same method. Makes room, goes outside leg stump. Gets down on a knee and reaches out to club this slog sweep"

"<b>Unadkat and his offcutter!</b> They combine to bring India the wicket. That's the end of Klaasen. Back of a length ball angled in at middle stump, and straightening after pitching.

"smash. Dropped short, the googly. Duminy transfers the weight and slaps it past extra cover"
