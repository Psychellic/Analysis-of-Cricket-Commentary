"full on leg stump, Rance backs away and muscles this over the infield, but no distance behind that shot. Comfortably taken by Fakhar at long on. Swing of the bat, and enough wood behind it, but safely caught by the Navy man"
"short on off stump, the batsman backs away thereby missing the shot completely. Flies over his bat"
"short on middle stump, slower ball and the pull induces another top edge. Flies over the keeper, but short fine leg races behind to complete the catch. <b>Pakistan win by 48 runs!</b>"
