"sharp turn, and Dhoni's appealing for a stumping! And Warner's walking, Nicely bowled by Harbhajan, bowled it slower and held it back a little. It's dropping onto a good length just outside off, not quite full enough for the slog against the turn, and Warner is early on the shot too. The length forces him to reach for the ball, and that causes his back foot to slide out of the crease. The rest is left to Dhoni's fast hands - excellent work, since the ball bounced quite a bit, and he had to rise to his toes to collect the ball and then complete the stumping"

"slower length ball, can't get enough power on this slog and it bounces well short of midwicket"

"slower ball, back of a length, fifth-stump line. It seems to take an age to reach Watson, but that's also because he's in position so early, back foot deep in his crease. He waits and chops it away fine, and finds the gap to the left of short third man"

"slower length ball outside off, Rayudu slices it in the air, with an open face, to the left of deep point"
"bouncer, rises over Watson's right shoulder. Looks to hook, and doesn't catch it cleanly. There's an appeal for caught-behind from Bhuvneshwar, and it's finally given. Tiny bit of glove on it, and Watson falls four short of what would have been a repeat of his hundred in last year's final. Fantastic knock - he took his time early on, but once he was in, there was no stopping him. Great catch from Bairstow, by the way, diving to his left and completing it with a tumble"
"back of a length close to off stump, shuffles across to clip to midwicket"
"back of a length outside off, chopped away to the left of deep point"
"jumps out of his crease and Bhuvneshwar tucks him up with a slower short one at his hip. Looks to flick, only manages a bit of thigh pad into the leg side"

"looks to step out and make room and Bhuvneshwar cramps him again, angling a shortish offcutter towards leg stump. Flat-bats it back to the bowler"

"full, angling into leg stump, flicked to short fine leg. If he'd placed that better he might have got four"
"wow, that's another brilliant stop at the boundary from Manish Pandey. Or is it? Jumped down the pitch and turned this ball into a full-toss on the legs. Flicked it and timed it very well, well enough to clear the boundary to the right of deep midwicket. But Pandey, running to his right and jumping past the rope, pulls it back with one hand. But replays show his foot landed before he could paddle the ball back, and that will be six"
"shuffles down the pitch, drives this full one outside off firmly to mid-off, who's stationed deep enough to permit a straightforward single"
"bouncer over off stump, and Rayudu's fallen with the scores tied! Opens up and looks to pull, but it's a hard one to drag from over his right shoulder, and he ends up miscuing it high, offers a simple catch to Vijay Shankar at mid-off. Vijay Shankar catching Rayudu's just what this match needed, I suppose!"
"full on off stump, and there's a little bit of drama here but the winning run is eventually taken. Drives it powerfully towards mid-on, except it ends up hitting the non-striker's right foot as he jumps up to evade the ball. The ball ricochets towards the cover fielder, who sprints in, picks up, and underarms a throw at the non-striker's end and hits the stumps direct, but Jadhav was safely home by then"
