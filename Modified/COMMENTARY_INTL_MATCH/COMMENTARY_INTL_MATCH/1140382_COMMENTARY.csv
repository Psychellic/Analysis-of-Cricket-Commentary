firmly punched to point
"stabbed into the off side, collected at mid-off"

"tossed up into the blockhole, worked into the covers"
"tossed up, this breaks back into the front pad, concerted appeal from England... but turned down, and Morgan elects not to review. Maybe outside the line of off?"

"floated up on middle and leg, Dickwella sweeps firmly for one"

"on the stumps, flicked away to the leg side"
"pushed through, straightening on off into the front pad... and Reiffel gives it! Dickwella <b>reviews</b>, though it looks like a hopeful one. Yes, it's red-red-red on Hawk-Eye, Dickwella is a goner! Hit him on the arm, actually, but that's still lbw in the Laws. Nicely bowled, but he's basically missed sweeping a straight one, and having played the shot so well today"
"<b>missed stumping first ball!</b> Dhananjaya was left stranded having danced down, the ball drifting away past the drive... but Buttler's gloves were made of iron and the ball popped straight out as he despondently broke the bails, to no avail"
"Rashid now hits the pads - <b>that's plumb!</b> Two in three balls for England, another failure for Kusal Mendis! Easy decision for umpire Hannibal, Mendis deep in the crease and jabbing across the line as it skidded at him, rapped on the knee roll in front of middle and leg"

"on the stumps, flicked into the gap"
"oh dear, <b>should have been a run-out!</b> Buttler with a poor throw this time, with Shanaka having to turn mid-pitch after being turned down for a quick single.

"comes across, tapped back to the bowler"
pushed through on the stumps and flicked into the leg side
"nicely played, driven through the off side for four! Only one man out and he's was much squarer, laced to the rope"

"pushed through and punched through the covers off the back foot, nicely timed for a couple"
tossed up and defended
"<b>dropped for six!</b> Hales misjudges this on the rope... Big slog-sweep from Shanaka, went high towards deep midwicket, but Hales was maybe a foot or two in front of the boundary, couldn't close his hands around the ball as it cleared him and then landed beyond the rope.

nudged into a gap for one more
"tossed upon the stumps, Dhananjaya defends"

"length ball on the stumps, turned to the on side, another dot"
"pitched up, 136kph/85mph on off, punched into the covers - that's a maiden for Curran, SL just beginning to lose their momentum again"
"length ball, 135kph/84mph outside off, cross-seam and then shaping in as Shanaka fiddles at it off the back foot and misses"
"thumped in short, ballooning over the batsman's shoulder... in fact, well over his head, but umpire Hannibal signals one for the over. Perhaps needed some help from his partner, there"

goes back and across and glides one to third man
"back of a length, zipping through in the channel as Dhananjaya plays and misses on the back foot"

"drifts into the pads, clipped fine and that's going to run away... first boundary in five overs"
"gone, <b>tickled through to the keeper!</b> Curran strikes, just when Sri Lanka were looking to get going again.

"<B>chance for a run-out!</b> A suicidal single, sent back, the shy is lobbed back to Woakes from short cover, and he's six inches short. What a shame for Shanaka, Sri Lanka, and this contest too. He was in the mood to set England something significant"

"width on offer, Roy accepts and clouts four more through the covers, <b>bringing up England's 50 in the process</b>"
"gottim, <b>Dickwella whips off the bails</b>, and he knows straight away! They send the decision upstairs but it's clear that Hales has just leaned too far forward, his back foot is outside the crease - and that's the first wicket for Sri Lanka! Hales was drawn out by Dananjaya's first ball, beaten past the outside edge, and was then too slow in pushing his toe back over the line. Not the impression Hales was hoping to make"

"tossed up from round the wicket, Root taps to midwicket"
"gives this a bit more air and Root is down early to sweep, picks up one to deep backward square"
"legbreak this time, straightens on leg stump to hit the pad... Dickwella screeches an appeal, not given by umpire Hannibal but Sri Lanka <b>review</b>, and this is quickly proved to be a good call! Pitched in line, Roy missed with a flick, and he's been DRS-ed by Dananjaya's liquorice allsorts for the second innings running!"
