nice start for Qdk. Gets a back of a length delivery on his hips and he gleefully nurdles towards square leg to get one. Not much movement
another leg side-ish delivery. Some inswing for Stuart. Easily clipped towards midwicket
"poor delivery. Strays down leg, would have been wide had Qdk not interfered but he did. And rightly so. Just a tickle gets the ball racing away to the fine leg boundary."
"again, the line is not adjusted. Good length but swinging into middle and leg. Qdk whips the ball in front of square leg and comes back for the first of many twos tonight. Binny has to adjust his line"
"better. Back of a length on off, Qdk stands as tall as he can to block"
uh oh. Wide this time. A decent amount of swing. Quite a good delivery to the right-hander but Qdk is left. Wide down leg
again down leg. Poor over from Binny. Nudged away comfortably to deep square leg. Not a great start for RCB
"<strong>dropped? </strong>Did it carry? Back of a length, short and wide. Should have been smashed to the boundary but he did not get over the bounce. May be a bit of extra bounce. Lobs to Jordan at backward point who dives in front of him, just about carried but the ball bounced out"
"no doubt about this one. Caught behind and RCb have one. Back of a length delivery outside off, nice carry. Pant doesn't move his feet and tries to punch on the up, but the ball holds its line and flicks the outside edge of Pant's bat. A thick edge."
"leg stump line- on Nair's hips, worked towards square leg for a quick run. Nice start"
"fullish and wide, inviting the drive but de Kock leaves. Not much movement there"
darts back in from outside off to ping de Kock's back elbow. Ouch. Through to the keeper on the bounce
"short and wide, another loose offering. Chopped into the surface towards cover for one. Reached out for it. Would have been wide"
"poor start. Full delivery down leg, easily nudged to fine leg. uppishly flicked but it doesn't matter if he holed out because Jordan has overstepped. Free hit coming up for Nair"
"full and wide. Nair was anticipating that line and length, goes back and tries to muscle a drive. But can only skew it off the outside half. Taken by sweeper cover"
"lovely shot. Fullish outside off, crisply driven to his South African captain AB at mid-off"
"better line this from Jordan. Goes much straighter. Full on middle, not great timing and so it goes straight to the bowler who feigns a throw"
"another poor delivery. Hmm. Short and wide, de Kock tries to get on top of the bounce but slaps a cut to cover"
"oh yes. Superb. Full on off, overpitched. Smashed. Sweetly-timed straight drive to the long-off boundary. Terrific shot"
"slower ball outside off, very wide and full. De Kock can only hit to cover after reaching out for it"
"lovely batting. That has carried over the boundary. Overpitched, but that length was made by de Kock who ran down the pitch, met the ball as it pitched and lofted it neatly over mid-off"
shortish length but closer to off. De Kock tries to lace a cut after making some room  but is cramped. Beaten
poor. Short and wide. De Kock scythes a cut straight to backward point
"not a bad delivery at all but de Kock manufactures four. Good length, honing in on that off bail. But Qdk shuffles across and helps the ball to the fine leg boundary with whippy use of his wrists"
shortish on a sixth-stump line. Thrashed to deep point
"back of a length on off, patted to backward point for a quick run. Clever"
"oh nice. Full and wide outside off, comes back in after pitching. Nair goes for a drive but the ball sneaks through to beat the inside edge"
"just over Gayle at slip. Good length on off, Nair tries to draq the pull but the ball moves away and so it takes the leading edge and goes straight up. Gayle labours after it, and doesn't put in a dive"
"good length and closer to off, defended"
"nah, not great shot selection. Fullish and wide outside off, not nearly short enough to pull. But tries to swat and the ball sneaks under"
"that is how good this pitch is. Short and wide, Nair goes after it and helps the ball with an upper cut. Much better shot selection. Enough behind it to carry over third man. Way over too"
"slower delivery outside off, defended"
"that is one of Qdk's favs. Tossed up on off, de Kock gets down to sweep behind square but toe-ended to midwicket"
flatter and straighter. Qdk backs away and slaps a cut to mid-off
"superb catch from Kohli. Brilliant, just brilliant. Tossed up on off, Nair plays a delightful drive. The loft, with a straight bat, looks like it has carried easily over mid-off, but Kohli scampers from mid-off and gets there after a sprint. A catch not many could have got to. He keeps his eyes on the ball all along and takes it in front of him"
"flatter and fuller outside off, miscued to midwicket"
"much shorter length on middle, flat-batted to mid off again"
"much fuller and slower, nudged to midwicket to get one"
"Binny is bowling his second, and starts with a shortish delivery on middle. De Kock wristily flicks to backward square leg. A highly productive area"
"back of a length. Drifts on Samson's hips, tucked to fine leg"
"short and wide, slapped to deep cover"
"nice lines. Nagging away around off, but Samson opens the face to dab to third man"
"back of a length down leg, picked off his ribs to fine leg"
"oh nicely bowled. Full outside off, discernible away shape takes the ball past Samson's half-prod"
"googly, back of the hand. Down leg, easily nudged to deep midwicket"
"superb. Excellent use of the feet, runs to the pitch, gets there and then he can easily wallop the heave over long-on without bothering about spin. Sensational batting"
"now a bit too full on leg, drilled to long-on"
"long-hop, too short. On off, swatted to wide midwicket. Could have put it in one of those pockets but with Kohli there, just the one"
"another flat googly on middle, bunted to long-on awkwardly"
too short. De Kock places the pull this time. Down leg and Qdk pummels the pull in front of square leg. The fielder runs across but cannot haul it in with a full-length dive. <b>Kohli ran around  but couldn't get there</b>
"fullish and wide outside off, steered to third man"
"good length on leg, worked to midwicket for a run. The throw is ricocheted by de Kock's stretching bat. They won't run though"
"good length on middle and leg, off the pad to third man"
"slugs in the surface. Back of a length outside off, Qdk is through the pull too early and the ball goes through"
"shaped to play a pick-up behind square but the ball was full, too full. And so he improvised a drilled drive to long-off"
"full and swinging. A low full toss but that swung late away from Samson, in the air. Easily pushed to long-on"
"drifts down leg, clips the pad of Samson. A big appeal but not given."
"shot. May have been premeditated but beautifully executed. Tossed up outside off, Samson gets low and drags the sweep past midwicket. Got enough power behind it despite reaching out for it"
flatter and wide outside off. Big appeal and given. Samson tries to dab a steer to third man. And the ball is taken by Rahul who throws the ball up immediately in celebration. Inconclusive replays. Samson certainly didn't believe there was bat or glove. Umpire Oxenford had no hesitation
"immediately brings out the innovation. Really good batting, doesn't bother taking one ball to defend. He paddle sweeps to fine leg for two"
"runs down to the pitch to clip, against the spin, to square leg"
"flat and wide outside off, pushed to long-off"
"slowed up on off, Qdk shuffles across and works to square leg"
"nicely floated up on leg, blocked"
"flatter on off, Billings gets down to paddle sweep again"
"superb. Short and wide outside off, de Kock scythes a cut past point. Sweeper cover gets across for a couple"
tucked to deep midwicket. Kohli is hunting and prevents the second
"well bowled. Sees the batsman coming and pushes it much wider outside off, Billings jams it out"
"full and wide outside off, laced to deep point. Nicely played, not enough room to hit that"
"what a catch. Kohli may not have the catch of the day after all. Short and wide, a poor ball, must be said. Billings doesn't keep his cut down, and it carries to Gayle who leaps and <strong>takes a diving catch </strong> to his right. Not sure how but it is taken."
"good length outside off, blocked to cover"
"fullish line outside off, defended back. Negi has got to look at strike rotation at least"
"another dot ball. Short and wide, Negi shimmies down but swats it to mid-off."
"<strong>dropped. Aravind drops a clanger, again</strong>. Short and wide outside off, Negi upper cuts to third man, doesn't keep it down. Carries to Aravind at third man who runs in, and lets it drop low in front of him. The ball bounces out. Deja vu"
"nicely bowled. Flat on leg, Negi backs away and chops to cover"
"overpitched and wide, drilled to cover. Just the one"
"flat on middle and leg, nudged to deep midwicket. Another single"
"edged. Beats the keeper and a couple to third man. Slowed that up nicely outside off and extracted just enough turn to take the outside edge. Flicked Rahul's gloves. Goes down as a chance, but isn't really"
"flatter down leg, off the thigh pad towards fine leg"
flat down leg. Negi was backing away. So Gayle followed him. Drifts down leg
"yorker on middle and leg, skewed away"
"yorker outside off, sliced to backward point for a run. Another fifty for de Kock. Quality knock. Daredevils need more though"
"swing. Full and wide outside off, Negi pokes with leaden feet and the outswinger goes past"
"another dropped catch. Shortish length outside off, swatted back to the bowler who just puts his hands in front of him. The ball goes past for a run to long-off"
"low full toss on middle and leg, punched back to the bowler who fields this time"
another yorker is carved to the sweeper cover. Daredevils falling behind their race to a 160-plus score
"Negi struggling for any timing. Slower ball outside off, Negi backs away and then goes back to reach the ball. Lobs the ball towards cover"
"flat down leg, Negi backs away but mis-times to midwicket"
Qdk backs away and then comes back inside the line. The ball drifts down leg for a wide
"yorker on leg, squirted to point"
"gone this time. Negi's faltering innings ends. Flat on middle, Negi runs to the pitch but drills the drive in the air and straight to AB at long-off. He won't drop em. Negi may have costed his side plenty of momentum"
"flat down leg, worked to deep midwicket for just one"
"another well-executed yorker on middle, jammed away to cover"
"gone. Gayle gets another. Daredevils struggling here.Another fired delivery outside off, Brathwaite squeezes it out and the ball carries straight to Watson at backward point. The umpires want to check if it has carried and it has. Comfortably done."
"low full toss on middle, drilled back at the stumps. Bursts through for a run to long-on"
"back of a length down leg, nurdled to fine leg"
"slower delivery on off, scythed to point for a run"
"half-volley outside off, driven with nice timing to mid-off. Just the one again"
"smashed for four. Superbly played. Full, slow delivery outside off. Pummeled past cover for four. Much needed"
"overpitched and straight to finish, skewed to long-on for a run to finish a decent over"
"another wicket. Daredevils falling away quickly. Flatter delivery outside off, de Kock backs away and flat-bats a stroke to Jordan at long-off. The umpires want to check if Chahal has overstepped, very marginal call. I'd be giving that a no-ball, seems Chahal has nothing behind the line. Given out"
reverse swept straight to short third man
"flat and wide outside off, slapped straight to Kohli at cover"
"slower and wider, called this time. the legbreak rips past"
"Morris will get four this time. Another flat legbreak outside off, Morris tries to reverse and gets some bat on it. Clears Gayle at slip and to the third man boundary"
"shortish and wide, bunted to Kohli at cover who fires a throw to the bowler's end. Goes through Chahal for an overthrow"
"slowish outside off, Morris has enough time to rock back and work against the spin to deep midwicket"
"shortish delivery outside off, sits up for Morris who waits for the ball before upper-cutting over short third man"
"good length on off, bunted back to Watson"
"very full, overpitched on middle. Neatly clipped to deep midwicket for a couple"
"back of a length slower delivery on middle, slapped away to deep midwicket again and even Kohli cannot prevent two"
"low full toss on leg, pushed to long-on for the one"
"slower legcutter outside off, a thick outside edge goes flying towards short third man"
"tossed up outside off, driven to deep cover"
"low full toss, clipped to backward square leg. Daredevils going nowhere in this innings"
"flat and wide outside off, slogged to long-on"
"another reverse sweep for four. Slow outside off, Morris gets low and finds the gap between short third man and point"
"flatter outside off, Morris shuffles across to sweep to square leg"
"slow and wide, a thick outside edge carries to third man for a run. Another tidy over from RCB"
"nicely bowled.  A well-directed short delivery outside off, Jayant stretches out but no connection"
"nicely bowled again. Sees Jayant walking across and then full down leg. Missed leg stump by not too much. Good call by the umpire, or non-call"
"yorker on leg, smeared to long-on"
well bowled. A yorker on off. Morris mis-times his drive to long-on but has timed it so badly that he gets two
"low full toss outside off, Morris backs away and misses a loose delivery. A cry of anguish after missing"
"another low full toss, badly miscued to cover. Jayant runs back for a non-existent second and is comfortably run out."
"full and wide to start, lots of movement. 133 kph. Left alone"
again much fuller and wide again. Gayle smears a drive to mid-on. Ugly.
"nice bowling. Good length on middle and leg, pushed to midwicket for a quick single"
"through immediately and four. Shortish and wide, plenty of width and Kohli leans into his drive. Through the covers for four. Easy peasy."
"great delivery. Back of a length outside off but angled away. Kohli leaves, that's how good the ball was"
"fullish on off, Kohli presses forward to defend with a straight bat, ball under his eyes. Technique on show"
"chopped on. Big wicket for Daredevils. Good length delivery outside off, shaping away. Gayle stays back but doesn't move his feet. Pokes at it away from his body and gets a thick inside edge into his stumps. Morris is pumped."
"good length but strays down lg, not much movement. Clipped to square leg"
"nice movement this. Hits a back of a length, swerving back in. De Villiers is hurried as he plays away to point"
"easy. Too easy. Good length on middle and leg, AB picks the length early and then a cross-batted help over square leg. Four easy runs"
"uh oh. Short delivery, too short. Banged in and goes over AB, Qdk isn't very tall but was way over him as well. Just de Villiers' mere presence"
"good length delivery, coming back in. Hits AB high on the thigh pad."
"nice running. Good length outside off, dabbed with an angled bat to third man. AB knows its wide of the fielder and comes back for two"
"too straight from Zak. Easily nudged to midwicket to get off strike. Impressive stuff from Kohli, not taking his form for granted. Respecting some good  bowling"
nagging on off. De Villiers defends with an angled bat to point
"AB runs at Zak. Shortish and wide outside off, AB misses an exuberant drive. Some extra bounce"
"got im. Game on. De Villiers goes. Good length on off, the ball bounces extra, too much for Ab who was into his drive and didn't bail out. Some inward movement too. The bottom hand came off the bat, and the ball just lobs to extra cover where Jayant dives low in front of him to keep Daredevils alive"
too straight. On Rahuls' pads and clipped to square leg
"full and wide outside off, steered to third man with the angle"
"full on off, nice bowling. Met with a straight bat from Kohli who drives to mid-off. Not going through that defence"
"good length on leg, defended away into the leg side"
"back of a length outside off, Kohli opens the bat face at the last moment to glide to third man"
"good length, honing in around off stump. Rahul gets behind the line to defend. A proper scrap now"
"shot! A test-match beauty. Full and wide, overpitched. Rahul dispatches it with such ease. Leans into the drive and caresses it through cover. Shot of the day"
"slightly looser this time. Morris has a word with Rahul. Full and wide again, 148 kph. Thrashed away, away from his body. Not in control and the ball goes over point. Four more for Rahul"
"nope, this is the shot of the day. Wow. Not overpitched  but full. Kohli shuffles across a touch and on-drives this with sensational timing"
oohs and aahs. The closest Daredevils will come. Good length but close to off. Kohli wants to get off strike with a dab to third man but its too close to him. A thick inside edge just misses the stumps and to the fine leg boundary
"good length outside off, blocked"
a tad too straight. Kohli clips off his body to deep square leg
"edged but falls short. A touch wider outside off, pace off the ball. Rahul gets an under edge to the keeper"
another offcutter squares Rahul up. A leading edge travels to third man
"full again outside off, nips back in just a touch. Skewed to midwicket. Morris chuntering away with Kohli. Zaheer puts his arm around his bowler"
"uppish but safe. Full outside off, bunted past cover. Played that too early"
"lands just in front. Oooooh. Full outside off, just enough away movement to get Kohli's outside edge. Bounces in front of Nair at slip. How badly did Daredevils need that?"
"nicely played. Back of a length outside off, steered away to third man. Got on top of the bounce well"
"soars over fine leg. Morris is bemused. Lovely short delivery, hustles Rahul for pace who pulls but no control at all. A top edge sails high in the air and just enough for six over fine leg."
"144 kph, outside off and glided to third man"
"slow and flat, nudged to deep midwicket"
"flat on middle, skids on with the arm. Kohli's angled bat takes the ball towards midwicket"
"some excitement from Qdk, but that was out of reach. Flat outside off, miscued to long-on, past Negi"
"flat trajectory again outside off, a drilled drive to long-off"
"strays in line, leg side and easily tickled to the midwicket area"
"a slider on off, carries on with the arm. On off and blocked"
"nicely floated up on off and middle, driven to cover who parries to long-off after a dive"
"too straight, 91 kph and full. Shovelled to long-on"
nicely played. Was the googly but the premeditated stroke was still executed pretty well. Rahul was jogging through thinking it was four. Kohli isn't happy. The reverse sweep was well played past point
"worked away to long-on, a misfield allows the second. The wheels slipping off"
"well played again. Knows where the field is, gets low and paddles the sweep to the fine leg boundary. Fantastic execution"
"long-hop and put away. Short outside off, sits up for Rahul to wallop through midwicket. Beautifully placed. Rahul playing a gem"
"superb. Overpitched outside off, Kohli leans into the drive and times it to absolute perfection. Past cover for a boundary"
"floated delivery on middle and leg, pushed to long-on"
"full toss on off, driven to cover"
"ooh, too close to cut. Flat outside off, chopped to third man"
too full and easily pushed to long-off
nicely bowled but not much turn and so it is easy for Kohli to flick from the stumps to deep midwicket
tosses it up and extracts turn straightaway. Inside-edged into his pad
"flat outside off, turns in and Kohli gets another inside edge onto his pad. Went deep in his crease to play it"
"errs in length. Too short outside off, slapped to wide long-off for a couple. Went back again, using the crease well"
"shortish outside off, punched to long-on from the back foot"
"short down leg., Rahul is through his pull too early. A leading edge spoons over the keeper"
"superb. Very late cut. Short and wide outside off, Kohli goes very deep again and almost plays it off de Kock's gloves. To the third man boundary, easily done."
"chops on. Kohli is distraught. Fullish outside off, Rahul defends but played with such soft hands that the ball bounced back off the pitch and spun to clatter into the off stump as the off bail came off. Kohli furious, rattling is bat onto his pads. Brathwaite sliding tackles in ceplebration"
"good length on off, tapped to point"
"another defensive stroke gets one to point. Well played, soft hands"
good length from wide of the crease. Comes back in and worked to deep midwicket
good length on off and middle from around the wicket. Defended to midwicket
"full and wide outside off, pushed to point from the crease. A run-saving dive from Negi"
"flat and wide outside off, pushed to deep cover"
"googly but too full outside off, smashed to long-off"
"ooh, beauty. Shortens his length and gets enough rip off the pitch to help the ball go past the outside edge"
"another iffy stroke. Flat on off, outside-halved to long-off"
"another googly down leg, off the pad towards midwicket. VK wants one but SW doesn't"
googly. Another one not pickled by Watson. Thuds into his thigh pad
"leg side delivery, easy pickings for Kohli as he flicks to fine leg. Seems intent on carrying this through"
"tight lines. On and around off, blocked"
"strays down leg, worked away to deep square leg"
goes wide of the crease and angles it full on middle and off. Calmly driven to long-on
"poor line. Full down leg, nudged to fine leg"
that will be four. Strays down leg now and Kohli wristily flicks to deep square leg. A fist pump too from Virat
"tossed up outside off, driven with the spin to cover"
"flat and wide, slapped to long-off"
"googly, not picked. Slides on and strikes Watson's pad before bat. Absolutely plumb, but a withdrawn appeal from de Kock"
"tossed up on off, Watson bends one knee and slogs it away to long-on, the fielder parries it over for six. We have seen those taken in this tournament"
an outside edge to short third man. Watson deceived by the turn again
"flat on leg, pushed to midwicket. Zaheer prevents the run with a dive"
"shot. Overpitched on off, drilled past cover for a couple to wide long-off"
"full on off, driven back to the bowler. Skids on"
"flat down leg, nudged away to wide long-on. Placed well for a brace"
"some flight on leg, smeared to long-on. An absolute cruise"
"some flight on leg, shovelled to long-on"
"gone. Negi has a wicket. Some flight on leg and middle, Watson gets down on one knee and slog-sweeps it in the air. Doesn't time it at all and straight to the deep midwicket fielder. A rather unnecessary shot. An aggressive shot can be on the ground too, but not Watson's style"
"tossed up googly outside off, pushed to long-off"
"flat on off, the legbreak. Played into the off side with soft hands, done so easily. Wow"
"another googly on off, Binny steps out to defend"
"oh nice shot. Flat down leg, Binny gets low for a nicely-executed scoop-sweep for four to fine leg"
nicely flighted outside off but wristily flicked to wide midwicket for a couple more. RCb inching in on their second spot
"googly on off, tucked to midwicket"
"overpitched on leg, gently driven to long-on. Fluency"
back of a length down leg. Played away off his hips to fine leg
"fifty for Kohli. Fantastic, just superb. A total different innings, more quality. Clipped to deep midwicket"
"another drifter down leg, nudged to wide fine leg for a brace"
"slower ball outside off, pushed in front of cover. Binny thinks there is one but is sent back. Probably one there"
skewed over the infield for a couple. Looking to go straighter but that wide of the crease angle takes the ball into the inside half of the bat
"slammed but to deep cover. What timing. Full and wide, clobbered cover drive"
"slower delivery outside off, quietly played to cover"
"oh. <strong>Kohli is beaten</strong>. Slower delivery outside off, Kohli misses an exuberant drive and lets out some anger. Distraught that he missed"
a thick inside edge to the keeper. Another offcutter outside off from Zak.
"five. Short and wide outside off, that extra bounce takes the ball way over Binny and de Kock's heads."
"what a shot. Shimmies down outside off and wristily times the flick over midwicket. Yikes, one of the shots of the day. Superb."
"132 kph, slower delivery, steered to cover"
"there it is. Slower delivery is pushed to mid-on for the quick single. Kohli is overjoyed, he is ecstatic. Pumped as he jumps up in celebration. <b>Royal Challengers qualify as the second-placed team </b>"
