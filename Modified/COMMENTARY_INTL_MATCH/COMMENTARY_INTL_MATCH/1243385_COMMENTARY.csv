"back of a length outside off, gets on his toes to punch to backward point"
"back of a length, nips back in towards Rohit's front hip. Can't connect with the flick and he's hit on the body"
"and again, a bit of inward movement from just back of a length. Misses the flick and he's hit on the thigh pad. The release looked like he was trying the legcutter, but it went the other way"
"full outside off, gets a good stride forward to push to wide mid-off/extra cover"
"in the blockhole on off stump, defended to that man at extra-cover. There's no orthodox mid-off"

"back of a length, hurries onto the batsman on an off-stump line, defended back to the bowler"
"shortish outside off, the speedgun says 124.3kph but it's surely quicker than that. Chopped to extra-cover"
"misjudgment from Gill, and Stone has a wicket in his first over of Test cricket in India! No hesitation from Nitin Menon, and Gill doesn't review either. Good-length ball, nipping in from not too far outside off, and Gill fatally shoulders arms. The ball hits him on the front pad, on the knee roll, and there's little chance of it missing the stumps from there. Hitting the top of off according to ball-tracking"

"length ball on middle stump, clipped towards midwicket"
"full, angling into off stump, defended to mid-on"
"full, close to off stump, not much of a stride forward to defend, but soft hands as you'd expect. The ball straightens, finds the edge, but drops well short of the cordon and scoots away to the right of the diving second slip fielder"
"full, close to off stump, driven firmly back and Stone gets a bit of his foot to it to slow it down, allowing mid-off to stop it. It was going for four if he didn't make that half-interception"
"length ball, not far outside off, Pujara watches it closely and leaves it alone"
"length ball close to off stump, defended into the cover region"
"excellent short ball, rising steeply over off stump, left alone, swaying his upper body away from the line. Speedgun says 142.3kph this time"

"length ball in the corridor, good stride forward and a good leave. 143kph"
"length ball on off stump, defended to extra-cover"
"full outside off, and that's nicely timed by Rohit. No real footwork, but it's full enough for him to reach out with his hands and play a checked drive into the point region"
"length ball, top of off, defended to wide mid-off/straight extra-cover"
"length ball in the corridor, and Rohit is unsure whether to play or leave. Makes the late decision to leave, and the ball hits his inside edge as he lifts his bat up, and bounces towards the keeper. <strong>Could easily have gone back onto his stumps</strong>"
"shot. Similar line, but a touch too full, and Rohit simply shows the full face and drives between the bowler and mid-off"
"length ball outside off, looks like the attempted offcutter. Stays a little low as Rohit leaves it, but it's well outside off"
"length ball on of stump, defended back towards the bowler. 141.9kph"
"full, but fairly wide outside off, left alone. 141.5kph"
"ooh, skiddy again. Back of a length at 138kph, and the ball nips back in a little as Pujara looks to fend it away, hits him somewhere on the body and rolls into the point region. Looks like it may have hit his right hand, actually"

"length ball, fourth-stump line, gets right behind it to defend into the covers"
"big appeal for lbw as Rohit plays around his front pad to try and clip into the leg side. It's an issue in his technique, because of that short front-and-across stride. A bit of inward movement, but there's an inside edge on this occasion"
"length ball outside off, defended into the covers"
"wow. That's full on off stump, and it stops on Rohit a bit as he comes forward to drive. Checks his shot, and ends up playing what looks like a half-deliberate chip that flies quickly over mid-on. Somehow managed to time that like a dream"
"length ball in the corridor, and the ball stops again and straightens. Pujara is initially looking to defend, then he pulls his bat away from the line and lets himself be beaten. Or it looks like that, and he's been genuinely beaten. Didn't let his hands get drawn away from him by the movement, though"
"back of a length, angling into the stumps, lets it come on and tucks it gently into the square leg region. Just a defensive pat with a slightly closed face"
"length ball on middle stump, clipped to the right of midwicket"
"short and wide, and he stands tall and cuts it away fiercely to the right of the diving gully fielder. May have ended up going a little finer than he intended, but he hit that hard and kept it down"
"a bit of inward shape in towards off stump, on a length. Jams his bat down just in time to block it back to the bowler, keeping his front pad out of the way"
"again short outside off, but this time the ball stops on Rohit, and he has to abort his attempted cut and play what ends up as a horizontal-bat defensive jab to mid-on"
"tossed up slow outside off, definite turn there, and Pujara pushes it into the cover point region with an open face. Bounce too - it hit the sticker of his bat"
"quick length ball on middle and leg and Rohit defends into the on side. Again his front pad went towards the leg side as he came forward, much like his footwork when he got bowled in the second innings of the first Test"
"sliding down leg this time, and Rohit stretches out to try and lap it fine. Decent lbw appeal, but it isn't given. England have a long thing, and decide to review... Seems to slide past the inside edge or brush it on the way to hitting the pad. No, it's missed the edge. sliding down leg this time, and Rohit stretches out to try and lap it fine. Decent lbw appeal, but it isn't given. England have a long thing, and decide to review... pitching just in line with leg stump, but it doesn't straighten enough, keeps going with the angle and strikes his thigh pad outside leg stump. England lose a review"
"full on middle stump, driven down to long-off. Not a bad position against Rohit, even this early in his innings"

"length ball, closer to off stump, punched to cover"

"tossed up a bit fuller, similar line, defended towards mid-on"
"back of a length outside off, punched towards the fielder at cover"
"wham. Short, angling into middle and leg, and it sits up to be pulled. May have actually stopped on Rohit a little too. Goes after it despite there being a deep square leg in place, and he gets it into the gap to the left of the fielder. Just clears the rope"
"short again, gets up to waist high just around off stump, and this time he can roll his wrists over the ball and find the gap to the right of deep square leg"

"Leach goes wide of the crease, pushed through on off, Rohit stretches out for the sweep, meets it on the full, and smacks it to the left of the short-leg fielder and the leg umpire. Pinged away to the square-leg boundary"
"dangled up on middle, Rohit deploys a big stride and plays it back to Leach"
"and again. <strong>Rohit brings up a 47-ball half-century!</strong> Rohit stretches out once again, takes another delivery on the full, and sweeps flat and hard to the square boundary. Rohit 50. India 60 for 1"

"here comes Pujara: down the track once again, whipped with the wrists to the left of short leg, finding the gap at square leg"
"Pujara uses his feet once again, Moeen has dragged his length back, finding drift once again. Off the pad and loops to Stokes at slip"

"speared into off, even fuller, played back to Leach"
"Leach belts out an appeal for leg-before. Not given. <strong>Stokes at first slip gesticulates that the impact may have been outside the line</strong> of off. Pushed through on off, Rohit presses forward and is struck on the front pad. Okay, the tracker returns umpire's call on impact and suggests it would have bounced over the stumps as well"
"on a length and outside off, Rohit delays the sweep and gets it finer on the leg side"
"flatter and quicker on the stumps, defended"
"dropped short and wide outside off, spins away further, Pujara goes right back and rifles a cut wide of backward point. Burns, I think, chases hard and keeps it to a double"

down the track and forced down to long-on
"too full and outside off, Rohit drives sweetly to the left of mid-off hanging back"
"<strong>edged and third-time lucky for Stokes</strong>. This loops into his hands at slip. Leach tosses it up outside off and finds turn, Pujara jabs at it slightly away from his body, probably aiming to steer it down to third man past slip, but he can only nick it off"

"fired on middle, defended"
"non-turner on middle, tapped down to mid-on"
"tossed outside off, Rohit stretches out and drives it down to long-on"
"<strong>wow, Moeen has knocked over Kohli for a duck</strong>. The India captain hangs around. He can't believe what has just happened! Moeen tosses it up, finds drift outside off, then it rips back in so very sharply to hit the top of off. This offbreak dips sharply as well, creating distance between the bat and the pitch of the ball, making Kohli's attempt to drive through the covers look a whole lot worse. Moeen just burst through the gate and silenced Chepauk"

"lovely flight on a middle-and-off line, clipped back towards the bowler"

Length ball on middle, Rohit goes low and sweeps it with control, placed fine of long leg. Quite fittingly, he gets to the landmark with a sweep.

"big appeal for lbw as Rohit misses another sweep. Nitin Menon shakes his head, and England choose not to review. Good ball from Moeen, slowed it down and beat the batsman with lack of pace. Impact was just outside off, though"
"back of a length on off stump, lets it come on and defends towards point"

"flighted, pitched up closer to off stump, gets forward to whip to midwicket"
"steps out again and Moeen bowls it slower and gets it to drop a little shorter than Rahane wants, outside off. Stretches out and blocks with bat and pad close together"

"there's that reverse inswing again, and he manages to beat Rahane's defence and hit his pad, but he's taken a big stride forward and made sure the impact is outside off. Ah, and a thick inside edge too"
"and again. This time there's no inside edge and the appeal is louder, but again Rahane's stride has got him outside the line of off stump. England think of reviewing and decide against it"
"full-toss on off stump, punched down the ground to long-on"
"tossed up slow, wider outside off, good stride forward to block into the covers"

"fuller outside off, jabbed back towards the bowler"
"sharp turn and bounce, and Rahane, looking to make room to cut, is beaten on the top edge by a distance. Superb take from a jumping Foakes behind the wicket. That was leaping almost vertically at him"

"tossed up wide of off, swept to the fielder at deep midwicket, who's stationed quite square"
"once again that line wide of off, quite full, and Rahane looks to drive against the turn. Possibly gets too close to the pitch of it, and gets a thick edge that runs away wide of slip"
"now Rahane employs the sweep from that wide line outside off, out to that man at deep midwicket"

"tossed up fairly wide of off, presses forward to defend with soft hands into the off side"
"looped up on that wide line, and Rohit sweeps again, this time to the left of deep midwicket. Bess, who's on as a substitute there, sprints then gets his knee stuck in the turf as he slides into position, and misfields into the boundary. That soft outfield could be very dangerous"
"back of a length outside off, leans back and plays the late dab wide of slip"
"goes for that sweep again, from that wide line. More topspin on this occasion, and it's bowled slower too, so he top-edges it to the left of the keeper. Didn't get down into a stable position, and nearly lost his footing as he swivelled through his shot"
"flatter, skips back and makes room to punch through cover point"
"quicker, closer to off stump, goes back and defends right by his feet"

"fired into the pads, clipped to the right of short leg, who makes a diving stop"

"quickish on the pads, clipped to short leg"
"flat one fired across the stumps, skips out and blocks it back"
"down the track and he fires it at Rohit's feet. Flicks hurriedly and in the air, but Pope can't grab onto it at short leg. Went very quickly to him, so you can't really call it a chance"

"<strong>top ball from Leach</strong>. Goes past Rohit's outside edge and Foakes whips the bails off. Fullish, drifting in, then gripping and turning away in the channel. Leach drags Rohit forward and beats his outside edge. The keeper gathers the ball and breaks the bails. Is Rohit's back foot on the line? Looks tight, but the TV umpire Chaudhary reckons Rohit may have got some part of his back foot behind the line. Rohit survives in the end"

"After having survived a stumping in the previous over off Leach, Rohit now holes out to deep square leg. Pushed through on middle, Rohit sweeps from the stumps, but does not get it off the middle.

"<strong>four, four, and out?</strong> Pant calls for a review. On a length, angling in towards off, making Pant play. It grips and turns, did that take the outside edge on the way to Foakes who rides the bounce and collects the ball? No bat involved, the review saves Pant"
"pushed through on leg stump, explodes from the deck, Ashwin jabs to where silly-point may have been"
"darted on leg stump, defended"

"blocks out a short ball at 143 kph, pulling the bottom hand off the bat, the hand that was hit in the last ball"

"flat, quick, on leg stump, tickled around to short fine leg"
"flat one slanted across to off stump, stays in the crease and blocks with soft hands"
"beaten. Quick length ball fired across the stumps, and Axar defends from the crease, playing for the turn, and it goes on straight and past his outside edge. Foakes fails to gather cleanly, shockingly"
"fuller, on middle and off, defended into the off side"
"a touch shorter on leg stump, goes back and defends to short leg"
"length ball wide of off stump, padded away and there isn't too much of an enthusiastic lbw appeal, because it wasn't spinning back enough to hit the stumps"
"back of a length close to off stump, punched down to long-off"
"got him, superb work from Foakes, and a lovely delivery too. They go upstairs, but I think Axar knows he's a goner. Dangled up loopily outside off, and it dips to make Axar reach out to drive. That causes him to lift his back leg, and the ball turns past his groping bat and into Foakes' gloves, and the bails go off before anyone can catch their breath. Superb"
"flighted ball fairly wide of off, big stride forward to defend"
"got him, Moeen has struck with a full-toss. Tossed up, angling into the stumps, and Ishant fails to read the length and is also a little late getting forward for the attempted sweep. Ends up top-edging it, and short midwicket runs a couple of steps to his right to take a simple catch"
"full, angling into off stump, gets forward to smother it"

"flat length ball skidding on towards off stump, goes deep in his crease and makes room to stab it out to third man. He runs the first one hard, but there's no second run on offer"
"full, wide of off stump, gets his head over the ball and pushes to point with an open face"
"flat length ball on off stump, no turn, stretches out to defend and the inside edge rolls to the left of backward square leg. A single was available but they decline it to bring Pant on strike for the next over"
"hit hard, and it's past the bowler before he can react. May have grazed his fingers at just around shoulder height. Steps out, meets this quick one on the full, and drives it back incredibly hard. A half-chance, you might say. No way long-off was cutting it off to his left"
"down the track again, converts another ball to a full-toss. This one's just around thigh high outside off, and he steps away from the line to make a bit more hitting room and wallop it straight of long-on"

"tossed up outside off, stretches out nicely and defends to silly point"
"soft hands, and the edge doesn't carry to first slip. Gets on the front foot again, but this one lands on a slightly shorter length and turns away. You'll have to say he played that well, didn't let his bat go too far from his body in defence"

"got him, excellent follow-up delivery. Back of a length close to off stump, straightens just a touch, and you can see Kuldeep was expecting the bouncer there. His feet go nowhere, and he gets squared up as he has a nibble at it, looking to run it down towards third man probably. Thin edge through to Foakes"
"short outside off, and Siraj makes a bit of extra room and uppercuts it crisply over the backward point region"
"tries the same shot, but this time he fails to make the contact he wants. Short again, outside off, and the attempted uppercut ends up as a bottom-edge through to the keeper"

"fuller, again some movement away from the left-hander, but it starts quite wide and he can leave comfortably"
"big appeal for lbw, and Virender Sharma thinks long and hard and finally raises his finger! Burns has reviewed, again after a lengthy consultation. He was caught on the crease there. Length ball, nipping back in past the inside edge of his defensive push. The ball strikes him in line with middle and leg, fairly deep in his crease, and ball-tracking returns an umpire's call verdict on where it's projected to strike leg stump. Superb bowling from Ishant, he's given India the early breakthrough. The lack of footwork from Burns got him in trouble there, but that was brought about by the length Ishant hit"

"ooh, jags in with extra bounce from a  good length. Ishant is really testing the batsmen here. Looks to defend, and the ball passes the inside edge, hits the unprotected right elbow - a glancing blow - and ricochets down onto the back leg"
"full, angling into off and middle, steps across to clip to the left of long leg"
"fullish on middle and off, defended towards mid-on"
"length-ball offbreak from Ashwin, defended back to him"
Lawrence stretches out and pushes this with the spin towards mid-on
"was that a carrom ball? Not quite sure, it disturbs the surface as well. Blocked off the front foot"
"this largely slides on with the arm outside off, Lawrence searches for turn and is emphatically beaten on the outside edge"
tossed-up liberally and dips sharply on Lawrence as he shuffles across off stump and does not make contact with a sweep. The lbw appeal is quickly shot down
"another lovely little offbreak from Ashwin, dips and turns in, Lawrence aims for the sweep again, ends up edging it to leg-slip"
nice and full as Ishant explores the channel outside off. Sibley isn't tempted (yet)
"fullish and on a fourth-stump line, quietly blocked back to the bowler"
"Ishant snags the outside edge, but it streaks away past the cordon. Ishant keeps it full, angling in, and straightening a wee bit to kiss the outside edge and roll away past the right of Rahane at gully"
"very full and homing in at off stump, blocked towards midwicket"
"a touch too full, Ishant brings this ball back in as well, Sibley deploys a solid stride and drives it to the left of diving short midwicket and right of mid-on for a charming boundary"
"<strong>Ishant adjusts his length.</strong> He drags it back and gets it to hold its line in the channel. Sibley fiddles with it as the ball passes the outside edge. The opening batsman did well not to stab at it, though"
"full and skidding in on middle, as Ashwin hurries Lawrence into a defence"
Lawrence steps out and drives a length ball only as far as short midwicket
"on a length and breaks in, quicker,<strong> disturbs the surface</strong>, played back to Ashwin"
"Ashwin slows this up, holds this one back, dips into off stump, forward and smothered"
prodded in the air but doesn't carry to short leg or short midwicket
fractionally short and spins in at the top of off. Lawrence is right back to close out a maiden
"Ishant hits the full length again, swerves back in and <b>stays low</b>. Sibley stoops low to jam it out"
"full and slanting in, this doesn't keep as low, so easily negotiated by Sibley"
"back of a length and outside off, not close enough to off to make Sibley"
"good length and nipping in towards middle, forward and bunted to short midwicket"
Sibley presses forward to this length ball slanting in at off and drops a single to cover
Lawrence now presses forward to block out this length ball on off
"has it straightened enough to threaten the stumps. Not given out lbw, India don't review either. Pitches in line, has Sibley toppling over"
"another appeal by India, this one's for the catch. Not given once again. <strong>But India choose to review this</strong>. Did this brush the glove on the way up? Pushed through on middle, Sibley goes for the sweep, but Ashwin finds extra bounce. Sibley thinks he's gone and walks off. Ultra Edge confirms that it kissed the <b>back of the bat on the way to Kohli at leg-slip</b>"
"shortish and outside off, punched to point"
"full on off stump, drops to one knee and sweeps to deep square leg"
"on a length and sliding across off, run away to point with soft hands"
"back of a length and quicker on off, Lawrence diffuses it"
"turn and bounce right away! On a length, spins away outside off, Root plays back and edges it with soft hands wide of silly-point. <strong>Axar raises a puff of dust first ball in Test cricket</strong>"

"skidding on and staying low outside off. The batsman stoops low, but still can't touch it"
"on a length and turns in, defended back off the back foot"
"88ks from Ashwin, full and attacking off, defended"
"pushed through on off or just a shade outside off, hauled away through midwicket with a firm sweep"
"back of a length and slides in at off, negotiated off the back foot"
"top-edged into the lap of Ashwin at short fine leg. <strong>Axar roars and celebrates his maiden Test wicket.</strong> Axar loops it up just a shade outside off, disturbs the surface, Root dares to sweep against the spin with short fine in place. The ball bounces, hits the top edge, and that's a dolly for Ashwin. Rohit felt that the sweep wasn't quite a risky option for him because England hadn't posted a short fine leg for him. But here there's a fielder to gobble it up. Massive wicket for India"
"slides on outside off, Stokes plays for turn and is beaten on the outside edge"
"fuller on the stumps, pushed down the ground"
"wide of the crease, arm ball, fizzes off the pitch to beat the inside edge and hit the front pad above the knee-roll. Probably, this delivery was doing too much. Ball-tracking suggests umpire's call on leg stump. No inside edge"
squirted away past silly-point
"turn for Ashwin, of the slower variety, full, played back to him"
Lawrence stretches out and clips it with the spin to short midwicket
"tossed-up offbreak, dips sharply, Lawrence is forward, but isn't close to the pitch. Jabbed into the covers"
"darted into the pads from around the wicket, flicked to midwicket"
"Lawrence is tired of blocking. He steps out, but is beaten in flight. He ends up dragging the ball in the air to the right of mid-on. Ashwin won't mind this at all"
"pushed through outside off, Stokes rolls out a sweep and places it fine of long leg"
"darted into off, some spin for Axar, Stokes has a short stride and defends to the off side"

"wide of the crease, drifting into the pads, deflected away towards square leg"

"on a length on middle, Lawrence closes the bat-face and blocks to the leg side"
"Lawrence uses his feet, Axar drags his length back and pushes it on middle, clipped away to the right of mid-on"
"tossed-up offbreak outside off, Lawrence advances down the pitch, closes the bat-face, Ashwin draws a leading-edge to the covers. No silly-point in for Ashwin"
down the track and whisked away to the left of short midwicket and right of mid-on for a single
"tossed on off stump, Stokes presses forward to smother it"
"<b>another top ball from Ashwin</b>! He thinks he has Stokes lbw and coaxes Kohli into a review. Fuller than a good length, drifts in from around the wicket, beats the edge as Stokes has a defensive push at it, breaks away to hit the flap of the back pad. Stokes it squared up and can't touch it. The tracker suggests that it would have bounced over off stump. Kohli isn't too pleased"
"fired on off, stabbed to the covers"
"full and dips in at off stump, Stokes can't connect with a sweep"
"on a length, drifts from outside off and spins away past the uncertain prod of Lawrence"
"on a length on off, 97ks, defended to the leg side"

squirted through the cover-point region
"darted on middle from round the wicket, pushed to mid-on"
"full and pushed through on off, blocked"
"Lawrence has been put out of his misery - out off the last ball before lunch. He slumps to his knees. Ashwin pushes it through, attacking the stumps from around the wicket. He finds turn and bounce, another ball that disturbs the surface. Lawrence jabs in front of his body and pops a catch to Gill at short leg"
"back of a length, spinning into the stumps, goes back and defends down the pitch"
"back of a length again, starts a bit wider outside off without too much turn back in, goes back and punches through cover point"
"again he lets him stay on the back foot with a marginally short length outside off, stabbed to the left of backward point"
"goes back to one that doesn't turn, looks to cut, and <strong>nearly inside-edges back onto his off stump</strong>"
"now there's flight and turn from a line just outside off. Sharp, sharp turn to beat the front-foot defensive"
"wow. Straighter one, then one that rips away, then the one that goes with the arm again. Goes back to make room and punch, and he's lucky to inside-edge onto his back leg"
"tossed up full on off stump, driven to mid-off"
"flat one slides on towards the pads, clipped wide of mid-on. No one at midwicket"
"he's living dangerously here. Ashwin has a man out at deep forward square leg for just this shot, the top-edged sweep from outside off. Agarwal runs in towards his right, but the ball falls short of him"
"back around the wicket to Stokes, quick length ball outside off, left alone"
"tossed up slower and straighter, on off stump, gets a good stride forward to block it back to the bowler"
"looks to flatten his trajectory and ends up bowling a long-hop on off stump, pulled away to the left of deep square leg"
"back of a length outside off, steep bounce and turn after Pope leaves it"

"turn and bounce outside off, left alone"
"tossed up slower on off stump, good stride forward to defend, off the inner half of the bat into the on side"
"again he plays for more turn than there is. Comes forward to defend one pitching on off stump, hits the inside edge and then his front pad"
"tossed up slower, just outside off, swept along the ground to the left of deep square leg"
steps out now and he can't get to the pitch of this flighted ball outside off. Blocked back towards the bowler
"flat, angled across the left-hander, defended off the back foot into the off side"
"ooh, finds the edge with one that keeps going with the angle. This is so difficult to negotiate on a turning pitch. Comes forward to defend with an open face, and the edge doesn't carry to Rahane at slip"
"now this one straightens with a lot of extra bounce, on a leg-stump line, manages to keep it down to the left of leg gully"
"turn and bounce again on that leg-stump line, this time he rings Stokes forward to defend, and it brushes the inside edge, then pops up off pad to the right of Kohli at leg gully. He can't get to it with the dive"
"flat length ball close to off stump, presses forward to defend with the turn"
"fuller outside off, gets forward for the defensive push into the covers"
"flat length ball on middle and off, goes back and defends into the on side"
"bowled him, Stokes has missed a half-volley. It can happen when the bowler gets the kind of drift Ashwin does, but Stokes might still be disappointed with himself. Drifted in, and he looked to clip that towards midwicket, and that's a dangerous thing to do from a stump-to-stump line. Turns past his bat, and hits off stump"
"greets him with a flighted carrom ball on off stump, defended into the off side. The no-ball klaxon sounds for the first time in this Test match"
"tossed up outside off, clipped to midwicket"
"turn from a full length on off stump, clipped watchfully to short leg"

"goes with the arm again, towards middle and leg, goes right back to work it through square leg"
"quickish, angling into the stumps, goes back and works it through square leg"
"ooh, beautiful. Drifts away from off stump and drops on the batsman a little. Comes forward to defend, and it turns just enough to take the outside edge, but again it falls short of Rahane at slip"
"quicker, close to off stump, goes back and blocks it back down the pitch"
"slow flight outside off, and Foakes' front foot makes a double movement to cover the line of the ball, before he defends into the on side. Clear sign of the ball doing things in the air."
"again that double front-foot movement, to defend this one into the off side. The line was wider on this occasion"
"nicely bowled again. Drifts this across Foakes as he looks to step out, and he has to stretch out to cover the length. Doesn't turn as much as he expects, and it rolls to the left of backward point off the outside edge"
"length ball on off stump, stays around the wicket to Pope, and he goes back to tap it into the point region"
"tossed up close to off stump, good stride forward to block to silly point"
"steps out now and can't reach the pitch of this. Looks to work it across the line, he's hit on the pad, but outside the line"
"nice length close to off stump, quicker than the previous two balls, defended into the covers"
"a bit of bounce, but not so much turn, as he comes forward to defend this one pitching just outside off. Hits the inside half of the bat and rolls into the midwicket region"
"fuller, on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"slider, keeps going with the angle, with the round-arm release helping it along. Goes back and defends, and it hits the inside edge and then his back pad"

"probing off-stump line, brings Pope forward to defend. Off the outer half of the bat towards gully"
"quicker, gets a half-stride forward to block to silly point"
"he's been looking for the marginally short ball, and again he rocks right back to cut this, from an off-stump line, towards backward point"
"huge appeal from Axar as this one goes with the angle and hits the pad as Foakes plays slightly across the line in defence. Not given, and Kohli has a think before <strong>deciding to review</strong>... The front pad went across and came in the way of his bat swing there. No bat. Kept going with the angle, struck him in line with middle stump, but it's carrying on past leg stump and bouncing over according to ball-tracking. Kohli was indicating when discussions were on that the ball would bounce over."
"fuller now, on middle and leg, clipped into the on side"
"straightens along an off-stump line with a bit of extra bounce. Slightly leg-side of the ball while defending this off the front foot, manages to squeeze it into the point region off the outside half of the bat"
"nice length, spins back from fairly wide of off. Presses forward, waits, and defends with soft hands, and the ball rolls backwards, not too close to the stumps  but producing some excitement from the close catchers"
"goes back now, to tap this one into the point region"
"slower, stretches out to sweep but can't get to it, hits his arm after beating his bat"
"steps out, can't reach the pitch, stabs it back to the bowler"
"quicker now, on off stump, goes right back to hurriedly defend towards short leg"
"flights this full, inviting the cover drive, does well to roll his wrists over and drive it straighter, to mid-off"
"length ball sliding on towards off stump. Half-forward to defend, rolls off the inside edge into the square leg region"
"beauty. Sharp turn from a middle-and-off line as Pope comes forward to defend, rips away, beats his edge, and bounces over off stump. Pant can't collect cleanly either"
"a touch short on off stump, and he's immediately right back to cut it to the left of backward point. Agarwal chases back and pulls it back with a sliding stop"
"round-arm, a touch short outside off, no turn, goes back to chop to backward point"
"slower outside off, a bit of turn and a lot of bounce, left alone"
"huge appeal for lbw, two appeals, and Virender Sharma says not out. This one looked closer than the previous one to me. Impact may have been the issue. Came forward to defend, and the ball slid on with the angle, and ah, there's an inside edge into front pad. Great decision. Struck him just in line with off stump, I think"
"quicker one, goes on straight towards off stump, goes back and defends it back down the pitch"
"much slower, and Pope thinks of coming forward then goes back to defend it, close to off stump"
"down the track now as Ashwin gives this one air as well, clipped to mid-on"

"quiick and full on middle and leg, defended down the pitch off the front foot"

"full on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"tossed up on leg stump, clipped to short leg"
"goes on the back foot to try and flick one that turns sharply from middle and leg. Misses, and Pant appeals extremely loudly and repeatedly, but it isn't given. Maybe a bit of back pad on that one. Yup, past the bat and off the thigh pad"
"down the track to this one tossed up on off stump, gets close to the pitch and works it with the turn into the square leg region"
"tossed up outside off, spinning back in, good stride forward to defend towards extra-cover"
"oooh, he's beaten by one that's full enough to be a half-volley. Floated across the right-hander, wide of off, inviting the cover drive. Goes with trhe angle and beats his outside edge"

"on a length and outside off, tip and run to the covers"
"full and spins in at off, much slower through the air, forward and smothered"
"another stock ball from Kuldeep, but a bit too full and straight, neatly clipped through midwicket off the front foot"
"Kuldeep goes full and shifts his lines wider of off, so Pope goes low and sweeps it over square leg. He sees the wider line and brings out the sweep"
"<strong>first-ball wicket at home for Siraj</strong>! Wow, Pant throws himself to his left like a goalkeeper and plucks it out with one hand. Pant draws big cheers from the Chepauk crowd. Slightly short and slanting down the leg side with that angle, Pope can't get enough bat on it and tickles it behind. Pant athletic intervention provides India the breakthrough. It popped out of the webbing once Pant landed on his elbow, but he just about clings onto it. He has Chepauk chanting: Rishabh Pant! Rishabh Pant! Rishabh Pant!"

"inswing this time, and Foakes seems to be prepared for it, staying slightly leg-side of the ball while looking to drive into the covers. No real stride forward, though, and a thick edge runs away wide of gully"
"and he gets his man immediately. Another acrobatic grab from Pant, diving full-length to his left to take it one-handed. This is superlative bowling, angling into the fourth-stump channel, forcing Leach to play, and the length means his feet go nowhere. Just pushes at it, and the ball straightens away and takes a thick edge. Pant had to go for that, because the only slip was a wide slip."

He's been getting in that back-and-across shuffle to Moeen in this innings, to get himself outside off stump before the bowler releases, and closer to the line of the flighted ball wide of off.

"<strong>Mooen nabs Kohli for the second time in the match.</strong> Kohli calls for a review of the on-field out decision. On a length, Moeen gets this length ball to turn against the angle and bounce into the batsman. Kohli goes back and is pinged above the knee-roll of the front pad. Has Kohli nicked it or is this bouncing over the stumps? I think this will miss the stumps. Ultra Edge detects no edge and ooh the tracker returns umpire's call on middle stump. Clipping middle and enough for umpire Menon's original call to be upheld. Moeen ends an excellent innings from Kohli"

"<strong>slides in from around the wicket, pins the pad</strong>, and the finger goes up. Kuldeep has asked for a review, but this seems fairly plumb. Nice and full, strikes the front pad below the knee-roll as Kuldeep pushes outside the line, probably playing for turn. No edge and that's clattering into leg stump. Another good call from umpire Menon"

"on a length and on a fourth-stump line at 129ks, patted to the covers"

"back of a length on off stump, no real turn and slow off the pitch too. Gets on the back foot to push to the left of mid-off"
"missed stumping, wow. Kept low, in Foakes' defence. Steps out to try and launch this over long-on, but the ball didn't turn as much as expected, and skidded through low. Foakes was moving to his left, expecting more turn, and had to reach to his right with his gloves while also dipping at the knees because of the low bounce"
"tossed up on off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"down the track again, and this time he gets closer to the pitch of this off-stump ball. Doesn't really middle this big hit, lands it in the big gap between long-on and deep forward square leg"

"shot. Full, angling into the pads, clipped to the left of long leg to get off the pair"
"tossed up very full outside off, jams down on it and keeps it out"
"now Ishant gives Moeen the charge, and why not. Why not if you can get right to the pitch of it and launch it with the turn over wide mid-on? Finishes classically with his bat over his left shoulder, and Kohli punches the air in the dressing room"

"tossed up slow on off stump, looks to get forward and work it with the angle, and the leading edge rolls into the covers"
"taken, excellent catch from the fielder running to his left from backward square leg. Tossed up a bit slower, and Ishant looks to sweep from just outside off. Too far from the pitch of the ball to control it, and Stone runs to his left and finishes with a slide as he gets under the top edge"
"wow. That's marginally short, straightens towards middle stump, and he rocks back, opens up at the hip, and absolutely hammers a pull to the left of midwicket. Superb shot"
"smartly done. Makes room against a slightly back-of-length ball on the stumps to dab it wide of slip. He could have run two, but he takes just one to keep the strike"

"quicker, on off stump, goes right back to defend into the point region"

"goes for the sweep again, and he just manages to elude deep square leg running to his right. It's in the air, but mostly off the middle of the bat, and the fielder puts in a dive, but he can't quite reach it on the full. Manages to palm it away into the boundary. Broad the fielder."
"looks for the reverse-sweep from outside off, rolls back to the left of the bowler off the toe end"
"tossed up, ripping away with extra bounce from middle stump. Easily past the edge as he gets forward to defend"
"goes on the back foot this time, defends from an off-stump line, back to the bowler"
"goes back to a slightly fuller one spinning from middle to off, defends with the turn"
"quick turn away from off stump. Goes back to defend and it zips past his edge. Bat came down at an angle, slicing across the line"
"and again, past the edge with a quick length ball spinning away from off stump. Goes right back to defend, can't get near it"
"full, on middle and leg. Squeezes it back to the bowler off the outside half of the bat. Again his bat came down at that angle, and he could easily have gotten a bigger leading edge on it. But he's done brilliantly to survive the over"
"quickish outside off, gets back to dab with an open face to the right of slip"
"wow, <strong>nearly drags it on</strong>. Pitches on or outside leg stump, and Ashwin is through his reverse-sweep too quickly. Bottom edges into the ground, and it bounces over the stumps and beats Foakes as well"
"length ball slanting across and straightening towards off stump, goes right back to defend it back to the bowler"
"on the back foot again, defends this one spinning on from outside off, and does so comfortably, towards silly point"
"tossed up fuller, and it spins past the inside edge of his forward defensive to hit the thigh pad. Extra bounce too, so no appeal, and it struck him outside the line"

"tossed up full close to off stump, blocked to short extra-cover"
"sharp turn and bounce from an off-stump line, and Ashwin's feet don't go anywhere. Pushes at it and the ball rips past his edge. Excellent length"
"now it's delivered a bit slower outside off, and he gets the stretch out to defend into the covers"
"tossed up full on off stump, driven smoothly past the bowler, to the left of long-on. Doesn't take the single, hmmm."
"shot. Superb shot. That's a length ball spinning away from off stump, and he rocks back and make room to cut it to the right of backward point. One of the shots of the innings. His back foot is so deep in the crease when he hits it"
"tossed up, angling into leg stump, stretches across and sweeps firmly, but short fine leg is there to cut off the single"
"tossed up wide of off, and Siraj gets the single. Stretches out to defend to the left of short cover, and Ashwin sets off immediately. Siraj takes an age to respond, but they still complete the run with ease"
"floated up full on off stump, driven to mid-off"
"wow. Tossed up on off stump, and he clears his front leg, sinks back on his back knee, and slog-sweeps this with a sweet, sweet clunk off the bat, easily clears the midwicket boundary"
"flighted full-toss on middle and leg, driven inside-out to the left of long-off, far enough from the fielder to run two and move to 99. Chepauk explodes in a chorus of whistles"
"edged for four, and what an innings this has been! Fifth Test hundred, and it's such a catartic moment for a man who went through a genuine batting trough for two years. That innings in Sydney has rejuvenated his batting once again. Steps out to the flighted ball outside off, has a big slog at it, and the edge flies wide of slip and runs away for four. He punches the air, and Siraj punches the air with even more fervour at the non-striker's end"
"more lucky runs, and the lead grows and grows. Looks to sweep from outside off, and he doesn't connect cleanly. Either the bottom edge or a bit of pad - impact would have been well outside off - and it runs away to the left of the keeper, very fine"
"tossed up outside off, and Siraj can have fun now. Clears his front leg and slogs it away, not middled, but into a gap somewhere in the square leg region."
"goes right back to one straightening just outside off, defends solidly into the point region"
"what a shot. Straight bat too! Not a half-volley, on off stump, and he leans forward and extends his arms through a straight drive to launch it high over the bowler's head"
"bounce, from a middle-stump line. Goes on the back foot and tries to fend it away, hits the bat handle and falls just short of Pope diving forward from short leg"
"tossed up outside off, stretches out to defend to short cover"
"down the track, and that's <b>dropped</b>. Difficult chance, got right to the pitch and flicked this firmly in the air, from just outside off. Root throws himself to his left at midwicket, gets both hands to it, but can't wrap his fingers around it"
"length ball close to off stump, defended into the covers"
"stand and deliver. Fullish, a bit of width, and he just leans back and drives powerfully, but short cover dives left to stop it"
"full-toss on off stump, hip high, pulled to deep square leg. Doesn't take the single"
"short, just outside off, clears that front leg and plays another straight tennis pull, to mid-on"

"down the track, can't get to the pitch of this one spinning away from off stump, and stretches out to prod it to the left of extra-cover"
"looks to pad away a ball pitching outside leg, and it hits his back shin and ricochets onto the helmet behind the keeper. India don't get five runs, because he didn't offer a shot"
"back of a length, turning from outside leg, goes back and works it to the right of midwicket"
"wham. Tossed up, stump-to-stump line, and he clears his front leg, sinks down on his back knee, and slog-sweeps powerfully over midwicket"

"back of a length outside off, punched to the left of mid-off"
"short, plenty of width, slapped to the right of deep point"
"full, just outside off, clears his front leg and looks to swipe it straight of mid-on. Doesn't quite middle it and the fielder can cut it off"
"bowled him. Back of a length, fairly close to off stump, and Ashwin was looking to go after pretty much every ball now. Looks to open up and pull, and he bottom-edges into the top of off stump. The end of a special, special innings, and he raises his bat to the crowd as he walks off"
"full inswinger, but Ishant strays on the pads. Burns has this tendency to shuffle across, but this time he picks it up and flicks it uppishly. The ball pings the square-leg fence"
"uppish drive to follow the uppish flick. Full and wide outside off, Ishant has the opening batsman reaching out for the ball. Carved away between point and covers"
"Ishant slightly pulls his length back and gets this to swerve into middle and straighten away late, Burns shuffles across once again and is hit high on the thigh pad. Not quite threatening the stumps"
"very full and veering down the leg side, away from the reach of the flick. Burns seems to be on the move while meeting the ball"
"full and outside off, Burns reaches out, plays away from the body and slices it to point"
"on a length and simply comes back in with the angle, but does not pose a threat to off stump. So, Burns watches it through to the keeper"

"on a length and slides into middle, clipped away off the back foot to short fine leg"

"sharp turn away from off stump, excellent length, left alone"
"short, wide, cut away to the right of cover point"
"all three of those fielders are there for the turning ball, but this one doesn't turn as he looks to sweep from one that's on or around off stump. Risky. He misses, and the ball hits his thigh pad. Given out on the field, and Stone has reviewed... No bat. Did that strike him in line? Umpire's call on impact, and the ball is going on to hit off stump. India are one wicket away now. And Axar has a five-for on debut. What a moment for him!"
"looks to sweep a quick one from just outside off. Sharp turn to beat him and hit the pad, but it's probably spinning too much to hit the stumps. Barely had time to get down properly to sweep that"
quick turn from outside off as he hangs back to defend. Off the inside edge into the square leg region
"steps out and smokes another six over long-on. Tossed up outside off, a puff of dust when the ball hits the surface, but Moeen gets into a great position to launch it handsomely with the turn"
"replay. Axar is looking to hit one of many rough patches outside off stump, and Moeen steps out and gets into just the right position again, close enough to the pitch of the ball to be able to negotiate the turn, but just far enough from it to create swinging room and get the elevation he wants"
"tosses it up wider, and Moeen jumps out, uses the extra room, and hits it straight back over the bowler's head. Stunning hit"
"shot! Every now and then he'll play a shot that reminds you of the old allrounder days. A touch overpitched outside off, and he gets a big stride forward to drive to the left of cover point"
"tossed up, spinning away from off stump, Broad misses the sweep"
"wrong'un, not too much turn from just outside off. Presses forward and blocks square on the off side"
"looks to sweep one spinning into the stumps from outside leg, misses and is hit on the pad"
"full on off stump, blocked to short extra-cover"
tossed up slow close to off stump. Presses forward to defend and the ball rolls into the square leg region off the inside edge
quickish length ball spinning from leg stump after angling in from around the wicket. Defended back towards the bowler
"steps out, looks to hit Ashwin out of the park, but it's much harder when it's spinning away. Doesn't get to the pitch of it but he manages to skew it over mid-off"
"six more! Tossed up a bit wider, and he gets down quickly to sweep it over the forward square leg boundary"
"length ball on leg stump, swept to the left of Kuldeep at deep square leg"
"flat, angling into the pads, looks to come forward and flick, doesn't turn and hits his pad"
"quick arm ball skidding into the left-hander as he comes forward to defend. Polite appeal from Pant, but there may have been an inside edge. Possibly going down leg too"
"tossed up outside off, steps up and makes room to drive that inside-out through cover. Superb use of the wrists there, drills it between short extra-cover and cover point"
"got him, and Rishabh Pant ends this Test match with another acrobatic stumping. This was coming. Steps out once again, and Kuldeep dangles it up slower and wider. Doesn't reach the pitch of it, and it turns too far from him to be able to reach with another attempted drive. Pant has to catch it with his arms extended fully to the left, and from there he dives towards the stumps to end the Test match"
