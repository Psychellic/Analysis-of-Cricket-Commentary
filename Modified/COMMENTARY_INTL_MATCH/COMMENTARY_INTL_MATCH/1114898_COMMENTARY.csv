"fuller, very wristy again as he whips it from outside off towards mid-on"
<b>chopped on</b>. He's been trying to manufacture something out of nothing for a while now. Was very effective on a couple of occasions but not this time. This one's by far the closest to him and his bid to get cheeky and open the face very late towards third man results in an inside edge
"full on the pads, flicked off them into the leg side"

"oh, good lord! Three in a row. He's running in and bowling the same, not learning from his mistakes. This is a repeat of the first delivery. Too short and pulled to deep square leg"

A back of a length delivery, head slaps it straight back at the bowler who cannot latch on and lets the ball pop out of his palm. He then throws at the bowler's end with Weatherald backing away. Archer at mid-off is too busy ruing the dropped chance and had his hands on his head. As a result he does not see the ball go right past him"

"<b>dropped</b>. D'Arcy Short at deep midwicket does well to get around it but lets it pop out. He ran forward, slightly more than required, then arched back as he went at it with reverse-cupped hands. Holds his balance well but the ball doesn't stick on. He judged it decently as it went pretty high up in the air but in the end that was a catch that should have been taken"

aaaand the ball makes another trip to the deep midwicket stands. Uses the angle and pace for a short-arm whip off the pads. That was all bottom hand
overcompensates with the length and drops it short and it's pulled through midwicket. <b>Brings up the 200 for the Strikers. This is also now the highest score in a BBL final</b>
"can anything go wrong for the Strikers? Archer can't believe what's happening. Ingram slashed at a shortish delivery but had no room and missed. They steal the bye and there is a direct throw at the bowler's end. Before we can confirm if he was inside the crease, they steal an overthrow off the deflection off the stumps.

Siddle appeals confidently for a leg before and gets it in his favour. After some deliberation. Seemed like it may head down leg as McDermott missed this hoick over the leg side. That's what the angle looked like anyway but the umpire thinks otherwise
