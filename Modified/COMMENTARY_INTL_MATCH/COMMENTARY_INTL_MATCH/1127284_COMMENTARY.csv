runs into the leg side off a thickish inside edge as he plays forward
"<B>cleaned him up!</b> He's basically played all round this one. Pitched just outside off, looking to work it too square really and completely misses. Went straight on. To be fair, the previous one did spin a bit. So a nice set-up by Shadab"
"over the wicket, full outside off, goes straight on and is left alone"
"<b>and another! Edged to gully off the pad</b> The slide continues. Think this may have been the googly, spun back a fraction, he was on the back foot looking to work to leg, gets an inside edge into his pad which loops to the close catcher"
"leans forward on off stump, defended"
"touch shorter, pushed square through the off side with an open face"
"full outside off, left alone"

"gets forward to a length delivery, comes off an inside edge into his front pad"
gets down early and plays a neat paddle-sweep through short fine leg...taken from around off stump
"another googly, he presses forward and defends"
"wider outside off, a little shorter as well, think Wilson just pulled his bat inside the line at the last moment"
"full on the stumps, defended"
"fuller still, at off stump, dead-batted to the off side"
defended on the back foot
"good call from Wilson, O'Brien squeezed this between his legs, defended a full delivery, to the on side and wasn't sure where the ball was...Wilson alert to chance to get through"
"another sharp run...short of a length, defended off the back foot towards the covers"
"full at off stump, defended on the front foot"
"back of a length, a middle and leg line, defended to the leg side"
"nicely bowled, pushed up fuller and angled across outside off, encourages a drive and beats the outside edge"
"short of a length, pulled through square leg and there's a man out on the boundary"
"a strangled appeal for lbw, think there was an inside edge. Another wrong 'un. No bat, it was just sliding down leg"
defended to the leg side
"full at the stumps, he comes forward and blocks"
"touch more air on this one, full and straight, decent stride forward"
"dragged down a little short, driven off the back foot to deep cover"
"full outside off, Wilson across his crease and defends with a slightly open face"
"a half volley outside off, nicely driven off the front foot but he picks out mid-off"

"good length at middle and off, defended from the crease towards point"
"flung across wide outside off, he doesn't play"
"short of a length on leg stump, nudged off the hip towards square leg. He seems to coping okay at the moment"
"this scoots through low outside off, under the bottom as Wilson aims to play square"
"straighter delivery, full at middle and off, stride forward to defend"
"nicely tossed up, much fuller, takes an inside edge into his pad but bobbles safely away"
"a little shorter, he's onto the back foot and pushes square to the off side"
"a terrific delivery! Perfect leg-break. Pitches just outside off, draws him forward, spins past the outside edge"
"straighter one to end the offer, skids on a little, pushed to the leg side...very nice stuff from Shadab"
"over the wicket, good length at middle, defended to point"
"lovely-looking shot but without the placement, onto the front foot and drives a very full delivery straight to mid-off"
"not so full this time, but again O'Brien is driving confidently, this time he picks out cover"
"<b>straight to cover!</b> O'Brien has been keen to have a drive. Goes for it again, this time more on the up, can't keep it down and it's a neat snaffle by Imam at cover"
"gets the bat down to a full delivery outside off although he certainly wasn't getting forward, trickles off the edge towards the slips"
"excellent yorker! Almost gets through, and it's a good effort from Rankin to jab the bat down quickly enough"
"full at off stump, defended"
"across to off stump, played with bat and pad together"
drives a full delivery to cover
"that's a beauty! Was it an edge? Not sure. A leg-break that spun past the bat, beat off stump and wasn't gloved by Sarfraz"
"runs off a thick inside edge as he plays forward, past short leg"
"straighter delivery, drifts in towards middle, defended to the off side"
"neatly played, a length ball angled into Rankin who tucks it past square leg"
"huge appeal for lbw, not given! Was it sneaking down the leg side? Length ball which nipped back, struck the back leg, he was a long way back but, yes, angling down leg"
"back of a length outside off, pushed to point"
"full and straight, a hint of Rankin staying leg side of the ball, defended to mid-on"
"full at off stump, played up to mid-on"
gets across the crease this time and defends a full delivery outside off to the covers
"a little short outside off, gives him the chance to drive off the back foot to deep cover...he's content to expose Rankin to the strike"
"through him, and misses everything! Tossed up outside off, Rankin eyes a booming drive, is beaten by the spin and goes past leg stump. <B>Lot of dust out of the rough</b>"
"and now this one goes straight on, beats the outside edge"
"bat on ball, rolls off the outside edge wide of slip"
"<B>dropped</b> by slip! Very full outside off, Wilson drives and gets an edge which glances off Sarfraz's pad and beatsslip. A tough one, to be fair, with the deflection"
a googly comes off the inside edge to the leg side
"full outside off, left alone"
"angled across, good length, shoulders arms"
"just short of a length, a little wide, left alone"
"fuller, he comes forward and pushes to the off side...comes from the bottom of the bat"

"fuller, doesn't make him play, angles in a little from round the wicket but left alone"
"spins in from outside off, takes the pads as Rankins tries to work through the leg side"
"much fuller, brings an lbw appeal...didn't look a bad shout as Rankin whips across the line. Maybe going down leg, but it was <i>very</i> full"
driven towards mid-off
takes an inside edge to the leg side
"a wider line outside off, brings Wilson forward and he pushes towards point"
"short of a length outside off, pushes towards cover...Rankin was keen for the run but it wasn't there"
"a bouncer, which evades everyone and everything...it's a good effort to get one over Rankin's head, Sarfraz can't gather with a leap"
"back on a full length outside off, pushed to the covers"
"full again, not much footwork from Rankin, played towards point"
"a yorker nearly gets through! Late dip in towards off stump, takes the inside edge as Rankin brings the bat down and it squeezes past the stumps"
"another very short bouncer, loops over Wilson's head, Sarfraz takes it one-handed moving towards first slip"
"length ball, pitches outside leg stump, clipped to the man at leg gully"
"good length at middle and leg, defended to mid-off"
"over the wicket now to the left hander, pitches around off stump, defended on the back foot"
"nearly gets through with a fuller one which brings a drive, inside edge into his pads"
"big appeal for lbw, Nigel Llong says no. Not a bad shout. Straightened just a little. Took the front pad"
a ripper! An unplayable googly...Sarfraz does very well to take it as it bounces up towards head height as it spits past Rankin's edge
squeezed out to short leg
"another lbw appeal! And another not out. Again looked pretty straight, perhaps a better stride from Rankin this time. Very close. Pitched on leg stump. Looked to be heading that way, too. He nicks the leg bye, which Pakistan probably won't mind"
"over the wicket, full at off stump, defended"
"plays back, works with a hint of spin, turned off the pads behind square"
"round the wicket, a little short and wide, square drives and finds point"
"tighter to off stump, a good stride forward to defend"
"finds the edge this time, but it dies quickly and is well short of slip"
"a shorter delivery, driven off the back foot towards point"
"full outside off, and he's happy to let it go. The ball stays low as Sarfraz collects"
"raps his pads, but too high! Pitched on leg and went straight through. He missed the back-food defense, and the ball hit him above the knee roll"
"fuller on off, and he pushes at it off the front foot. Mistimed to cover point"
"good length on leg stump, and that's been clipped off his pads behind square. First runs after tea"
"full just outside off, and through his defense! Between bat and pad, and through to Sarfraz"
"full just outside off, and shaping away slightly. He shoulders his arms to see the over off"
"floated up outside off, and angling into Rankin. He tries to defend off the front foot, but the ball sneaks past his outside edge and hits his back leg. Big appeal for lbw, but turned down. That looked close, but the umpire suggests 'too high'"
"full on off, and defended off the front foot"
"good length outside off, and fended away towards the off side"
"good length on off, and worked off his pads to square leg. Man there"
"width offered outside off, but the ball spins into the left-hander. Mistimes his cut to point, and allows Wilson to get back on strike"
"full just outside off, and a bit of spin away from him. He rocks back and blocks it with soft hands"
goes short! Forces Rankin to take his eyes off the ball and duck under the ball's line
"full on middle, but angling into his pads. Tries to nudge it towards the leg side, but misses. Appeal for lbw again, but 'no' says the umpire. Would've probably gone down leg anyway"
"good length outside off, and pushes at it off the back foot. Takes an <b>outside edge</b> and creeps past the packed slip cordon. <b>That's hundred for Ireland!</b>"
"full on off, and once again hitting his front pad as Rankin misses the defense. Hits his back leg, but the appeal's soft. Because of an inside edge"
"good length on leg, and that's been clipped fine down the leg side! No one's there at fine leg, and Rankin moves on to 16"
"good length outside off, and his punch doesn't come off! Goes past his outside edge and through to the keeper"
"full just outside off, but spinning further away. Tries to drive but eventually pulls out of the shot"
"full outside off, and pushed off the front foot to sweeper cover. They walk across for the single"
"<b>caught and bowled? Nope! Dropped.</b> He's only got himself to blame. Full outside off, and the straight drive popped in the air. Shadab stuck both hands in front of his face, but the ball hits his palm and popped out"
"full outside off, but stays low! Does well to get bat to ball"
"lifted over the non-striker, but a fielder's manning the long on boundary. Full ball"
"flighted on middle, and turning into his pads this time! Well negated by tapping it towards the leg side"
"full just outside off, and driven to cover. Man there cleans up in a flash"
"good length outside off, and he lets it go through to Sarfraz"
"good length outside off, and punched off the back foot. Finds the fielder at cover once again"
"full just outside off, but angling into Rankin. Shuffles towards the delivery and blocks it back to Abbas"
"fuller on off, and forces the batsman to play at it. Driven back to the bowler off the front foot"
"good length outside off, and that's been inside edged! Nicely taken by Sarfraz, who had to run across to his right. Rankin tried to drive, but the ball zipped in, and then took a feather edge off the bat. Ireland lose their ninth"
"full on off, and swept off his toes to the leg side"
"tries the paddle, but doesn't come off! Tossed up on off, and he tries to lap it fine. Hits his toe instead, and the appeal for lbw is turned down"
full on off once again. Big stride forward and fended back to Shadab
"flighted on off, and he defends with soft hands. Played to point"
"full on off, and he comes walking down the wicket before defending towards the leg side"
"full on off, and that's been swept away! Keeps his eyes on the ball, and swings it square. Races away to the backward square boundary"
"good length just outside off, and left alone by Murtagh"
"good length outside off, but Murtagh goes onto his back foot and blocks it towards cover"
"short on off, and he's pulled this away! Played in front of square, and despite it coming off the bat's toe end, the shot has enough legs to find the boundary"
"good length outside off, and he backs away to try and cut it over the cordon. Fails to connect"
"<b>edged over the cordon!</b> Full on off, and he tries to drive it towards mid on. Induces the edge, but the ball goes over the three men at slip"
"full on off, and flicked to midwicket. They want a quick single, and Wilson's sliding effort saves him! But looks like he's slightly hurt. Shakes it off though. All good except for the dirt on his sweater"
"<b>fancy!</b> Reverse sweep. Full on off, and he's quick to change his grip and whip this past backward point"
"good length on off, and he rocks back to fend towards Shadab"
"full just outside off, and it's the wrong'un. But Wilson blocks it off the front foot. Eyes on the ball"
"cut past backward point! Just wide enough for Wilson to cut it away from his body. Backward point goes chasing after it, but that's futile"
"good length outside off, and turning away from him. Left alone"
"quicker one! Full on off, and gets onto his body early. Squeezes it away to midwicket though"
"good length on off, and blocked off the back foot. Shuffled across to the off side to get inside the line of the ball"
"fuller on off, and driven back to Abbas. Played with soft hands though"
"good length outside off, and shoulders his arms on this occasion. Too wide for Wilson to even bother engaging with"
"full outside off, and Wilson commits to the drive. Attempts the shot, but the ball zips in and goes past the bat's inside edge and through to Sarfraz. Could've easily taken the inside edge"
"tries to cut, but misses completely! Enough width offered outside off for Wilson to go chasing after it. Just can't connect though"
"full outside off, and slashes hard at it! Carves it over the man at gully, and that's four more for Ireland. Babar Azam did jump, but the ball was always going to go over him"
worked off his pads to the leg side
"<b> they're all out! </b> Clipped to short leg. It was a length ball on off, and his attempted whip behind square goes straight to Imam. Smiles all around among the visitors as Murtagh and Wilson make their way back. <b>Ireland are bowled out for 130</b>"
"full outside off, and shaping away from the left-hander. Joyce shoulders his arms"
"yorker on off, and Joyce gets behind the line of the ball. Blocks it away towards cover point"
"<b>dropped?</b> Nicked for certain, but did it carry? Full just outside off, but the ball shapes away slightly, and takes the outside edge. Drops in front of first slip, but definitely a chance for the keeper, because he stands slightly forward. Nervy start"
"good length on off, and he rocks back deep inside his crease. Defended back to Amir"
"<b>shape!</b> Perilously close to the outside edge of his bat. Good length outside off, and shaping away from Joyce. He tried to defend off the back foot, but the ball went past his outside edge"
"good length outside off, and punched towards cover off the front foot"
"good length outside off, and angling further away from Porterfield. Left alone"
"good length on off, and going across Porterfield once again. Happy to let it go"
"full on middle, and forces Porterfield to take a big stride forward. Defends it back to Abbas"
"good length on leg stump, and shaping across his bat's face. Porterfield goes onto the back foot and defends it towards the off side"
"good length on off, and angling away from him. Close to the outside of his front pad, but goes past it and through to Sarfraz"
"good length on off, and going away from the batsman. <b>Two maidens to start off</b>"
"good length outside off, but moving away after pitching. Joyce attempts to defend but keeps his bat inside the line's ball. Through to the keeper"
"good length on off, and this time it's angling into his body. Joyce shuffles, and clips it off his pads to square leg"
"full on off, and forces Joyce to go onto the back foot. It stayed low too, so he does well to get bat to ball"
appeal for lbw! But the umpire's not interested. It was a good-length ball on middle and angling into his pads. Fails to whip it away towards the leg side
"on off, and shaping into Joyce once more. Worked off his pads to square leg once again"
"full just outside off, and blocked towards the non-striker. Still no runs for Ireland"
"good length at off stump, probing away, defended to cover"
"and Ireland off the mark in their second innings, a positive drive from Porterfield as he reaches to a wide ball and places it through the covers"
"brings the line back to off stump, also not as full, defended with a slightly open face towards gully"
holds the bat inside the line as this angles across him
"gets forward to a fuller delivery and pushes square past point so Joyce is also off the mark, from his 15th delivery"
"comes round the wicket, full outside off, he's well forward and defends"
"full at off stump, searching for some swing with the new ball, driven firmly to mid-on"
"a length ball this time, angled in at the stumps, played with a slightly closed face towards midwicket"
"shorter and dragged wide outside off, comfortably left alone"
"beats the outside edge with a back-of-a-length delivery, some zip off the pitch and though Porterfield pulled the bat away pretty sure he played at that"
"<b>dropped</b> again! This time Porterfield gets the life. Another missed chance off Amir. Good length on off stump, shapes just enough to take the edge and that was pretty simple for Azhar at third slip"
"and now he gets one through the field, a fuller ball outside off, driven square past point"
"round the wicket, full outside off, left alone"
top shot! Gets well forward into a full delivery and drives strongly through the covers
across the stumps and tucks a full delivery to mid-on
"he's making an effort to move across his crease to cover any late movement, defends straight down the pitch"
back over the wicket and pushes this one down the leg side
"pushed across outside off, good length, Joyce holds the bat inside the line"
"short, down the leg side, goes for the pull without making contact"
"short outside off this time, Porterfield tries to play through the off side with a horizontal bat but just gets a bottom edge into the pitch"
"that's a lovely delivery! <b>Late swing</b> from just short of a good length and it curves past the outside edge. Being harsh, perhaps needs to be a touch fuller"
"this is fuller but also wider, left alone"
"booming late swing on this one, but again started a little too wide and it's left alone"
"short of a length outside off, climbs through at head height to Sarfraz but a pretty harmless delivery as was too wide"
"edged, but this one doesn't carry to second slip. Good length at off stump, Joyce a little caught on the crease, the nick dies"
"back of a length at off stump, defended to cover"
"outside off, a little short again, copped into the point area"
"nicely controlled stroke, opens the face to a good length ball outside off and steers it through backward point"
"round the wicket, full and straight, flicked to mid-on"
"full, comes forward to drive and doesn't get much timing in the stroke. Dribbles back to Abbas"
"very full, some late swing, dug out to the off side"
"and again, targetted off stump this time with a very full length, not quite a yorker, jabbed to the leg side"
"dragged wide outside off, left alone"
a little closer to off stump but then shapes away and Joyce is able to shoulder arms
"short and wide, put away in style by Joyce as he stands tall and square cuts powerfully in front of point"
"now he overcompensates, goes very full outside off, Joyce gets onto the front foot and drives through the covers"
"over the wicket, good length outside off, left alone...a bit of wobble with that first ball"
"too short and that is also sent to the boundary, Porterfield stays just leg side of it and throws his hands through a back foot square drive"
"short again, another boundary, although a little less convincing this time as it flies off a top edge over the slips"
"a better length, fuller at off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"his eyes light up at a chance to take on another shortish delivery, opts for the pull but he misses and gets taken on the back leg"
"finally gets it full, outside off, left alone"
"short of a length outside off, the slips are appealing as it flies through to Sarfraz but that was nowhere near anything. Bizarre appeal!"
"on off stump, short of a length, hops into line and defends"
"flings this down the leg side, Sarfraz palms it away as he dives across so that's an extra to the total...Pakistan looking a little frustrated"
"full outside off, driven to mid-off"
"swings away outside off, left alone"
"a shorter delivery, Porterfield raises the bat high out of the line"
"full outside off, left alone, and he's overstepped. Tight one."
bit more zip on that delivery as he moves across Joyce from back of a length and is left alone
"very similar delivery, doesn't move quite as much, Joyce watches it closely as it goes through"
"full at the stumps, defended"
"full at the stumps, onto the front foot and defended to cover"
pushes a full delivery straight of mid-off who is able to get across but not in time to prevent the single
"good length outside off, left alone"
"round the wicket, outside off, played with the turn into the leg side"
"big appeal as this spins quite sharply from the rough outside off, beats the inside edge and takes the front pad but he's well outside the line"
worked towards short leg
"fuller, he plays with his bat well in front of his pad this time"
"more nice spin from outside off, a lone appeal from him because Joyce is miles outside off stump"
"pushes this up fuller, driven off the inside part of the bat to the leg side. Probing start from Shadab who could have a lot of work in this innings"
"short of a length at off stump, defended to midwicket"
strongly clipped off his pads down to long leg
"well, well, that climbs considerably from just short of a length and Sarfraz takes it well above his head"
"and now there's some seam movement for him, back of a length, nips past the inside edge and takes his back leg"
defended to the off side
"almost drags this off the inside edge into the stumps, defending a length ball...encouraging over from Ashraf"
"back of a length, turns in towards leg stump, shuffles across and tucks this to deep square leg"
"looks to sweep, and that's a <b>big lbw appeal</b> from Shadab! Missed it completely, but he ensured he got a big stride across to it, so the impact was outside off stump"
"length ball outside off, bunted gently into the cover point region"
"floaty and full, dipping on middle and leg at almost yorker length. Misses the flick and the ball hits his pad, but that's probably slipping down leg. No appeal"
"tossed up wider outside off, stretches out to block into the covers"
"tossed up quite full, looking to pitch outside the left-hander's off stump and turn it back in, blocked back without any fuss. He's probably pitched this too full to really trouble the batsman"
"fullish, slanting across to off stump, defended to extra-cover"
"back of a length, slightly down leg. Shuffles across and looks to glance, but the shuffle ended up taking him too far from the line of the ball"
"in the blockhole on middle and off, blocked down to mid-off"
"full on middle stump, clipped to midwicket"
"length ball angling in towards off stump, a bit of inward movement to accentuate the angle as well. Presses forward to drive down the ground and the ball beats his inside edge and hits pad, outside the line of off though"
"good ball, this one angles into the fifth-stump channel and then straightens. Joyce plays away from his body in defence, but with soft hands, and the ball drops into the gap between second slip and gully and runs away for four"
"tossed up full on leg stump, clipped to midwicket"
"back of a length, turns in towards leg stump, tucked away to deep backward square leg"
"looks to sweep, and it's hit something and rolled away towards the fine leg boundary. Tossed up outside off, and I think he bottom-edged this. Ended up going way finer than he intended"
"short, wide, slapped away with ease to the cover point boundary"
"top-edges a full-toss angling down the leg side, but no worries, clears leg gully comfortably but lands well short of the man at long leg"
"flighty full-toss outside off, and Joyce brings up Ireland's 50 with a little jab towards backward point"
"good ball, draws Joyce forward to defend with his length and corridor line, and then gets it to straighten past his outside edge"
this time he stays in his crease and gets behind the line to defend a similar delivery - with a bit of nibble away in the corridor - towards extra-cover

"length ball in the fourth-stump channel, angling in from round the wicket. Joyce plays a flat-bat drive to mid-off"

"tossed up full and a fair way outside off, blocked into the point region"
"stays back to a length ball turning in from outside off, defends towards extra-cover"

"back of a length, a bit of inward movement from a fifth-stump line, but Porterfield watches it well and leaves it, secure in the knowledge that it won't hit his off stump"
"fuller, along the same channel, and this one leaves Porterfield and kicks up. Well left. The keeper takes it above his head"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"there's the bouncer - outside off, though, and Porterfield ignores it"
"fullish now, angling into the fourth-stump channel and leaving Porterfield off the pitch. It's a beaut of a delivery, and it beats his attempted forward defensive. This is <b>excellent bowling</b> - pushed him back with the bouncer, and he was a little late getting on the front foot to this one"
"back of a length, angling into off stump, defended into the covers"
"back of a length, fifth-stump line, left alone. Now Sarfraz comes up to Amir for a chat. Put in a gully, Sarfy! Or a short leg!"
"tossed up outside off, gets forward and dabs with an open face, gently, into the point region to pick up one"
"tossed up on middle stump, defended to midwicket"
"nice length this time, a bit quicker on middle stump. Doesn't get forward quickly enough to defend, plays for a little more turn than was there, and it squirts away into the point region off the outside half of his bat"
"a touch shorter, on middle stump, goes back quickly to nudge towards square leg"
"Short, angling into the rib-cage, tucks it away nicely to long leg, keeps it down comfortably"
"back of a length outside off, punched to extra-cover"

"back of a length, angling into off stump, gets behind it and blocks into the on side"
"length ball, a little wider outside off, left alone"
"length ball close to off stump, defended into the cover region"
"back of a length on off stump, defended back towards the bowler"
"ooh, lovely. Fullish outside off, and sharp inward movement off the seam thereafter, but it starts wide enough for Porterfield to leave with a certain degree of confidence. Good cricket all round"
"length ball, a little closer to off stump to start with. Pushes at it with slightly hard hands in defence, and the ball goes to midwicket off the inner half of the bat"
"back of a length outside off, jumps across and opens his bat face to pick up a single to third man"
"back of a length on middle stump, tucked away to the left of midwicket"
"full outside off, nice stride forward for the defensive push to mid-off"

"back of a length on off stump, jumps across to defend into the on side"
"length ball close to off stump, nice stride out to defend into the covers"
"back of a length, angling down leg, too far away from Porterfield for the tickle to fine leg, and Sarfraz has to dive to his right to stop it from running away for byes"
"full and fairly wide of off, goes into the drive too early, and the bottom hand kicks in to play that towards mid-off rather than into the covers as he intended"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"shortish, a bit of width, slashes at it and misses, playing too far away from his body without necessarily getting his back foot across"
"length ball, nips away slightly from a sixth-stump line. Joyce leaves it, playing a shadow-defensive a long way inside the line"
"fullish on middle and off, and he clips it to the left of mid-on and calls for a quick single in the last over of the day. Complete it comfortably, with Babar having to run across to pick up and throw with his right hand"
"length ball on off stump, defended to mid-off"
"full on off stump, and that's a lovely shot late in the day, a neat clip wide of mid-on. Good chase from Babar to dive and pull it back just short of the rope"
"and that is that, Ireland go to stumps without loss in their second innings. Back of a length in the corridor, a bit of shape away, and Joyce keeps a beady eye on it and leaves it, playing deliberately inside the line of the ball"
"tight line outside off,  but a judicious leave, just a little wary of the one bending back into off stump"

"outside off, through to the keeper as O'Brien hauls his bat inside the line"
"<B>good grief, how did Porterfield survive that?!</B> A jab down into the crease from O'Brien, an instant call for a single, no response from the striker, a collision with the fielder as they converge on the ball, then a desperate dive back to the crease!

"<b>given lbw, umpire says pad before bat!</b>. A big inswinger from Abbas (reverse swing?), on a good length, tails into Stirling and, yes, that looks an excellent decision by Nigel Llong. Struck the knee roll just before the bat came through. Perhaps not a decision we'd have seen in a pre-DRS era (I know there's no DRS this match, but umpires now think differently)"

left alone once more
"<strong>width, slashed, gone!</strong> O'Brien is gone to his first ball of the morning! He forgot that he wouldn't necessarily still be seeing it like a planet today, and his feet weren't moving either. Big outswing, he lined up the mow through the covers but snicked it straight to slip!"

"<B>bowled him!</B> Angled across the left-hander, Rankin is caught in two minds, tries to leave but under-edges onto his own timbers! Abbas kicks the turf in a mixture of joy and frustration. Pakistan are one away from embarking on their run-chase"
a bit of a woolly swish to launch the innings. Feet going nowhere. Careful now!
"<B>battered back past the bowler!</B> That's the way to do it! Just back of a length, so Murtagh went for the big wind-up and slotted his slog through long-off. A few more of those will be very handy..."

a stand-and-deliver slash from deep in the crease. Keeps low as Kane's blade whizzes through the line
"<B>all over!</B> Five for Abbas, who performs the <em>sajda </em>after shattering Kane's stumps via an inside edge. It's been a valiant effort from the bowler, and the Ireland batsmen too. <B>And the target is a tantalising 160</B>"
"full length, a hint of shape but nothing extravagant. Punched back down the pitch and into the non-striker's stumps"
"a pre-meditated march out to meet Murtagh's length, and an urgent clip out through the leg side. A show of intent straightaway"
<strong>another gallop down the pitch!</strong> Murtagh hauls his length back in response and the cordon go up in excitement rather than expectation
"<B>edged and gone!</B> Goodness me, this is a huge breakthrough! Murtagh refused to stray from his strengths amid all of Azhar's prancing, and just found some lovely shape on a good length, a bit of new-ball bite, a tentative prod, and a flying edge to first slip! That is how to use the conditions, and now then, Pakistan, what's your response?"
"a left-hander in Murtagh's sights now, more shape back into the pads, and more yelping from the cordon"
"<B>flashed uppishly through point!</B> It's four, but it's another moral victory ... drawing anxious strokes left, right and centre! A bit of width this time, but more movement to disrupt the flow of Haris' bat"

"met on the back foot, and blocked back down the pitch"
"big stride down the pitch, nothing doing there"

"pushed onto the back foot, good tight line"

"outside off, keeps low as Imam leans onto the front foot"
"on the back foot, and worked into the covers"

"<B>beats the edge from round the wicket!</B> That's more like it from Rankin, a fuller length and a bit of nip off the seam"

"on the back foot, fenced to the off side"

"round the wicket, very full length, punched to mid-on"
pushed on the up to point

"left alone outside off, keeps a touch low"
"back of a length, and <strong>thumped firmly through point</strong> to take the target into single figures!"
"big appeal, and <strong>nailed on the knee-roll!</strong> Thompson is rewarded for his perseverence... kept a touch low as Sarfraz shaped to pull and up goes the finger! He doesn't look best pleased, might have been sliding leg-side, but Ireland have a late reward for their efforts"
