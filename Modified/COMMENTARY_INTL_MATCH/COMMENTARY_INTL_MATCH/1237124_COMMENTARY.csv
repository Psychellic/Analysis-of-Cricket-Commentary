"pitched up, shaping a little on middle and off, de Kock squirts an inside edge through square leg to get going"
"length, angled across from over the wicket, Bavuma dabs it in front of point and they scamper through as Roy dives after it"
"pitched up and worked across the line, wide of mid-on"
"seam movement, 129kph/80mph and a touch shorter, jags back to hit Bavuma on the hip as he plays back"
"back of a length outside off, 122kph/76mph and steered down towards point"
"tight lines, Bavuma settles for a considered punch into the covers and another risk-free single to finish the over"
"glides in and hits the pitch just back of a length outside off, jabbed down to backward point"
"<b>jaffa!</b> Perfect length, 135kph/83mph and then straightening off the pitch past Bavuma's outside edge... Archer grimaces at such a near miss!"
"drop short, this is slapped hard without foot movement, but picks out cover"
"full length, 136kph/84mph and punched coming forwards, sends this to mid-off"
"full on middle and off, Bavuma tucks this in front of mid-on and scuttles up the other end"
"length ball, 139kph/87mph and pushed across the left-hander, de Kock gets an inside edge on to his pads and jogs the one"
"shuffles across and looks to whip the ball past short fine leg, Archer is there and has a shy at the non-striker's end - might have been close!"
"first boundary of the day, <b>hooked through square leg!</b> Dug in but he was waiting and sent this powerfully and flat for four"
"<b>blammo!</b> Bavuma swings Curran disdainfully into the stands! Not all that short, and just a pick-up jab from the batsman, but he really connected"
on the stumps and flicked through backward square
"slower ball, 119kph and this is nurdled around the corner to square leg"
"length on the pads, another cutter from Curran, nudged towards fine leg - good over for SA, gets the innings thrumming"
"pitched up on off, Bavuma taps this into the off side"
"fizzing through in the channel, steered past backward point for a single"
"tight around off stump, 139kph/87mph and de Kock chops down in defence, Archer fetches it from around the batsman's feet"
"<b>pancake flip for four to fine leg!</b> Cute stuff from Quinny, shifting across late and using Archer's pace, gets it away"
"pongo! <b>Slugged off a length over deep backward square!</b> De Kock unleashes a fearsome hit, similar to one off Archer the other day, moving into line and again making use of pace on the ball to send this bouncing into the building site"
"dug in short, this time QdK rides it for a single into the leg side"
"on the stumps, slower ball and he works this behind square on the leg side"
"shortish outside off, room for Bavuma to broomhandle one through point to the sweeper"
"slower ball, a floater wide of off stump that de Kock swings at and misses"
"<b>miscued to mid-off, Jordan gets QdK again!</b> Using those changes of pace to good effect, this one skipped on at de Kock attempted to club him over the top, instead the ball looping gently to Curran, jogging back into position for a safe catch. England strike in the Powerplay"
"slapped into the covers, Stokes fields and hurls at the non-striker's end... <b>direct hit and Bavuma would have been short</b> (lolz)"
fired in and nudged for a single
"on the stumps, 128kph/79mph and Hendricks defends watchfully"
tucked off the body leg side
"fullish, Bavuma whips this away slightly uppishly, into a gap at midwicket for two"
"slower ball, the TC offcutter I think, dabbed into the covers"
"<b>edged beyond the reach of Buttler!</b> Hanging back and he had a dip, went quickly off the edge - actually got his glove tips to it, did Buttler. Tough one, though arguably goes in the book as <b>dropped</b>"
on the stumps and pushed away
"pushed through, slightly short and pulled for one"
"lobbed up on middle and off, Hendricks defends"
"<b>lovely bowling</b>, tossed up and spinning with Hendricks frozen, beats everything outside off stump"
"flighted, on to the front foot, stroked through the covers"
pushed through and tapped into the covers coming across
"<b>munched over cow corner!</b> Full and tempting, Bavuma's eyes light up as he humps a clean strike beyond the ropes, into the Newlands building site once again!"
"full and wide, begging to be hit - and that's what Hendricks does, <b>mullering a drive to the cover boundary!</b> Slotted"
"shortish outside off, dabbed off the back foot through backward point"
"dug in short, Bavuma thinks about pulling then jerks his head out of the way"
"bit of width, steered away through backward point and they'll come back for two"
"pitched up, 135kph/84mph and Bavuma plants it fine of long-on for a couple more"
"<b>gottim!</b> Bavuma plinks another catch to mid-off! Soft dismissal with the opener going nicely, like de Kock looking to hit over the infield, this went straight to Jordan at a very catchable height"
"tossed up full, Hendricks paddles a sweep but finds short fine leg"
"pushed through, clipped for a single off the pafs"
tossed up and tapped away coming across
"flighted, du Plessis is forward and strokes this towards cover"
spins the legbreak on off stump and Faf shows it a straight bat
tossed up wide of the stumps and this is steered through cover point
"pitched up outside off, Faf is across and chops down on the ball  for one through gully"
"length ball, pace off at 115kph, Hendricks stuns it straight to cover"
"<b>Stokes does it again!</b> Another slower ball, Hendricks looks to force it off the back foot, gets a thick low edge through to the keeper... They are going to check this, but looked to have carried pretty comfortably. Things are happening all right for England's firestarter"
"back of a length, maybe pace off again, he waits and defends calmly from the crease"
shortish and whipped away off the hips by RvD²
"dug in, 133kph/82mph and Faf pulls through backward square leg for one"
"flighted, spinning outside off, du Plessis cuts but gets it off the toe of the bat"
"full on the stumps, swept this time, straight to short fine leg"
"drags this down, Faf is across and swats a pull through midwicket for one"
"tossed up, Rassie is forward and opens the face as he defends, gets it in front of point"
"flatter delivery, punched off the back foot out to the cover sweeper"
"pushed through, van der Dussen sits back and works one more down to long-on"
"length on off, 134kph/83mph, RvD² strokes this in front of the cover sweeper for a couple"
pitched up and pushed back towards mid-off
"fullish length, this is punched a little too firmly to the boundary rider to risk a second"
<b>scooped fine as he walks across!</b> Du Plessis innovates to bring SA their first boundary since the eighth over
"length ball, 135kph and Faf nudges this off the hip to midwicket"
"short ball, Rassie gets hold of it - <b>smoked over deep square leg!</b> Nailed the pull, and these are vital blows for SA"
"tossed up, du Plessis aims a mow down the ground, comes off the inside edge into the front pad"
"shouts of 'catch it!' as Faf goes inside out down the ground, not got the connection to carry"
"drops short and van der Dussen latches on, <b>crumps a pull to the deep midwicket rope!</b> Beats the fielder, back-to-back boundaries for RvD²"
tossed up and steered through the covers
"gives this some air on leg stump, du Plessis sweeps and misses... half an appeal from Buttler, but I think that was heading down"
"uses the feet, Rashid draws his length back, Faf pokes it straight at cover"
"length outside off, RvD² stabs it through point for one"
"touch full, 136kph/84mph and <b>du Plessis hoicks it through midwicket!</b> Makes a bit of room and bottom-hands it away to the rope"
"legcutter from Archer, this jumps off the deck to kiss the splice, maybe raps du Plessis a blow on the knuckles, too"
"pace off, nudged into the on side and they take one as Archer ambles after it"
swung away through backward square leg
"full toss, maybe a slower ball gone wrong, du Plessis biffs it off his pads through midwicket"
"back of a length on the stumps, 134kph/83mph and whipped off the body through midwicket"
"short on off, pace off this time, Rassie swings with all his might and toe-ends one to long-on - <b>that's the SA 100 up</b>, still 30-odd balls to add to it"
"pitched up, 144kph/89mph, not quite yorker length and du Plessis slugs it down the ground"
"wide of the stumps, length ball and van der Dussen cuts, gets a bottom edge... Buttler is up quickly and shies at the bowler's end. Think Rassie was well in"
"fullish length on off, <b>145kph/90mph</b> and Faf can only slap it away to the deep cover sweeper"
"low full toss, 146kph but this time RvD² uses that to his advantage, steps out and <b>crunches four to deep midwicket!</b> Besmirches a good over, Jordan looks a bit peeved"
"<b>hang time!</b> Du Plessis climbs into Curran again, <i>smashing</i> his first ball straight back down the ground, on to the seats in front of the sight screen!"
"pace off in the channel, beats a wild swing as Faf comes out again"
"back of a length, du Plessis is leaning away as he swats one to long-on, <b>brings up the 50 stand</b>"
"short and pulled away through midwicket, they'll come back for two"
"dug in, van der Dussen swings a pull out to deep backward square leg"
"<b>belted unceremoniously into the empty seats!</b> Du Plessis has enjoyed facing Curran's variations this series, and he fetches six more over deep backward square leg with a mighty swing of the blade. Properly boofed!"
"<b>hoyed over deep midwicket</b>, van der Dussen hang around this time! Pace off, I think, and he stayed still, carted it over the fence"
"<b>thumped down the ground!</b> Uses the pace this time, bat turning in the hands, and Stokes fails to cut it off - looks to have hurt his hand on the boundary boards, too"
"<b>larruped back past the bowler</b> - three boundaries in a row off Archer! You don't see that often, RvD² tearing it up now... Just stepped out and belted it, no chance for the bowler to get a hand in the way"
"digs this in short, van der Dussen ducks the challenge"
"<b>146kph/90mph length ball and it goes the journey!</b> Not sure what Archer was trying to bowl there, but it didn't trouble van der Dussen, who swung it away leg side once again!"
"short ball, Rassie pulls firmly for a couple, <b>brings up a 23-ball fifty!</b> Joy for van der Dussen, his first half-century of the series, and SA are motoring towards a useful score now"
"<b>hammered over long-off!</b> Faf comes to the pongo party! Missed the yorker, and suddenly this game has changed, the ball is flying out of the middle hither and yon"
"looking to open up his stance, Jordan fires it right on to the guideline outside off, no shot from du Plessis"
"<b>beamer!</b> Du Plessis yelps like a scalded cat as he fends the ball away! Smashed into his bat handle, that's going to be a no-ball"
"sends a searing yorker through past the base of off stump! Can't get bat on it, brilliant response"
"fires this in full and straight, du Plessis can only whip it for one through square leg"
"pitched up a foot or two outside off, <b>147kph/91mph</b> and Rassie can only toe a drive for one"
"fired full in the channel, struck firmly by Faf but straight to backward point and RvD² sends him back"
"sprayed full and wide, but too wide as Rassie looked to pounce"
"fullish, out towards the tramlines and van der Dussen advances, chips a couple over the covers"
"sliced up and over point, <b>but it won't carry with two fielders converging!</b> Archer and Curran were running up, but it bounced a few yards short of both"
"loose again from Curran, full and wide and gives up another extra"
"low full toss, this is <i>just</i> inside the tramlines as Faf swings and misses. He doesn't seem to agree"
<b>clattered in front of deep point!</b> Wide half-volley and he munches it for four on bended knee!
"pitched up and <b>crashed through extra cover once again!</b> Opens his stance, bottom hand powering through, picks up another boundary"
"<b>slices a full toss wide of short third man</b>, back-to-back-to-back fours and that's a half-century for Faf du Plessis! Applause from his team-mates, and SA look to have themselves a fighting total, with one over still to go"
"full on the pads, <b>145kph/90mph and swung through backward square!</b> Jordan guilty of not bowling to his field there, and the runs continue to flow"
"<b>gives it the full Christmas hamper over long-off!</b> Goes for the wide yorker but misses his mark, and Rassie slugs it flat into the stands!"
"pitched up and clubbed leg side, Archer misfields in the deep as they come back for two"
"full outside off, swings hard but dings it back to the bowler in his follow through"
<b>kerplunked!</b> Another wide half-volley and RvD² gives it the treatment over long-off - his fifth six of the innings!
"short ball, swung away to leg, <b>Sam Curran takes the catch but then throws it away on the boundary!</b> Not sure he was actually going to touch the rope, and there wasn't enough on it for Archer to complete the relay catch. Just a couple to finish, but SA have been brutal at the death here!"
".round the wicket, tight line and length, and Roy presents the fullest face of the bat imaginable to press it to mid-on"
"flashed into the covers, a hard-handed wipe to a slightly wider line. He's off the mark, and the strike"
"twirled onto a good length from round the wicket, and whipped to mid-on"
"shuffling at the crease, trying to open up the covers, but under-edges through to the keeper"
"tossed up, dipping on a full length, chiselled to mid-on. This is excellent so far"
"back and across, trying to make room, but despite a solid crack on wood, that's rifled straight at short cover. No width or length to work with, that's a mighty opening gambit, with England needing more than nines from the outset"
punched on the up into the covers
"tight line, right up to the toes, and Roy feels solid bat on ball as he whittles a single to backward square"
"good length, tight line, pressed with a straight bat into the off-side"
"jabbed down to third man, just riding the pace outside off"
"hanging back on the crease, more solid contact as Nortje hits the bat hard, but cover is in situ to gather"
"short, and clawed out to the leg side, not quite timed but placed well enough into a gap. Buttler is off the mark as England's cautious start continues"
"flogged with intent but lots of control, up and over the in-field. That's a decent range-finding strike, hitting in to out with oodles of space to aim for"
"sliced out to point, as Roy attempts to impart some pace into a tight lined delivery. Well bowled"
"miscued to backward square leg, pressure building!"
"A frantic slog-pull, hitting down on the ball, on one knee, and getting enough bat on ball to race behind square"
"'oh no!' says Roy, as he misses out on a gimme of a long-hop, outside off, smacked hard into the covers"
"<B>That's more like it from Roy!</B> A bit of frustration in the stroke, but enough commitment to go with the flow, as he strides to the pitch and lumps through the line, high over the bowler's head!"
"<B>absolutely yeeted into the stands!</B> Crikey, that's a hit, picked up from outside off, and it was gone before the bat had completed its arc across the line. Shot!"
thumped into the covers to keep the strike rotating
"full length, firm strike, biffed with purpose back through Nortje's followthrough. This is hotting up!"
"<B>clattered on the pads and up goes the finger!</B> That was full and fast, and Roy's attempted whip was far too late on the stroke. His instinct was right, it was heading leg-side, but it was probably still straight enough to hit leg stump, and Roy doesn't waste the review"
"slightly short, and <B>Malan pounces on the pull!</B> No messing around for a man in form. Straight into the action with a fierce swing of the blade"
"<B>harsh wide!</B> That looked like it was perfectly aligned to take Malan's head off, had he not hauled his neck out of harm's way. We'll have that again. Fierce wheels! <B>95mph/152kph!</B>"
"<B>the faster they come, the faster they go!</B> Malan lined up a firm-handed drive, but the ball was already beating him as it did so, and skidded off the edge through third man. 16 off the over, despite the wicket. This is tasty!"
"inside-edged drive to the leg-side, placing the bat through the off-stump line, and taking the single on offer. And there's a <B>no-ball</B> that the scorers haven't yet clocked at the ground. A delay as the umpires get the message across. And a <B>free hit coming up</B>"
"<B>panned into the stands!</B> That's a nervy half-tracker, into the body, and Malan has no reason not to go hell for leather at that one, honking it up and over midwicket!"
"into the ribs, and tucked behind square"
"slower ball, tighter line across the left-hander, who blocks down into the crease"
"<B>love-er-ley delivery!</B> That's just dangled like a carrot on a teasing full length, shaping back in all the time and beating a loose drive on the inside edge. A good recovery from a horror start"
chipped to the leg side with a flick of the wrists. Can Sipamla escape from this over with a cheap finish?
"slower ball on the pads, Malan waits on the back foot, and chips to the leg side"
"<strong>full and straight, and crashing into the pads again!</strong> Ngidi goes wide on the crease, but that's a very tight line on impact, and it's hard to see this one being overturned. But Malan is <B>reviewing all the same</B>. He was toppling across the crease as he aimed towards midwicket ... this is touch and go. And <B>yes, it is pitching outside leg!</B> Gosh, a big moment"
"offers up too much width, <strong>and that's a freebie for Malan!</strong> A half-tracker, right in his arc, shaping away, and helped even further through the covers with a flow of the blade"
"better line, tighter and fuller, and Malan is forced into a more cramped push-drive to cover. Gets the single away all the same"
"angling into the right-hander on a full length, flicked with those firm wrists to midwicket. Buttler is content to play second fiddle for now"
"full length, just outside off, Malan waits on the back foot and dabs with an open face, down to third man"
"<B>pumped through the covers!</B> You can't bowl them there, just floated onto a dangerous length outside off, dangerous for the bowler that is, as Buttler destroys those for breakfast, lunch and dinner"
"tight line on the pads, Malan can't get it away through the leg side"
"stabbed to the on-side, urgent calling from Malan but just the single as midwicket gathers"
"open face, and eased out to deep point"
"crunched out to extra cover, tight lines from Linde, keeping both batsmen honest"
the first signs of improvisation as Buttler reverses his hands but can't get the sweep away
"advancing to the pitch, Linde sees him coming and holds his length back. Canny bowling, as Malan settles for the push to long-off"
"<B>no sighters for Malan!</B> That's outstanding batting, a reverse sweep, telegraphed early, and belted through the vacant backward point, irrespective of Shamsi's line or length. Shot!"
"width outside off, Malan stretches with a fishing-rod bat and toe-ends the single"
"spin outside off, Buttler slices a cut, and nearly picks out backward point"
"turning into the pads from a middle-and-off line, Buttler closes the face and settles for the single to the man on the 45"
"turn from a good length, away from the left-hander, and another pinched single even though the ball goes straight to short third man"
"twisting into a rifled pull over the leg side as Shamsi drops short, but Buttler doesn't quite nail it as backward square gathers"
"outside off, and crunched to point"
"<B>reverse sweep, and Buttler is through it too soon!</B> Luckily he doesn't drag his toe as de Kock gathers and threatens the stumping"
"biffed out to deep point, flashing blade across the line"
"<B>dumped with such heavy power through the covers!</B> A stride to the pitch, waiting at the top of his backswing like a mallet, and clobbered to the rope!"
"chiselled to the leg side, and they hustle for two. Bavuma is onto it like a comet, and the shy is good too... this will be out if de Kock gathers, but <B>he's fumbled it!</B> He's broken the stumps with his elbow, and Malan survives! He wasn't even in the frame, which is testament to Bavuma's superb athleticism. Deserved better!"
"another flick from a leg stump line, out to Bavuma in the deep again, and this time there are no liberties from the England batsmen! An easy jog"
"down the leg side, that's a poor ball, and Malan simply has to get bat on ball as he wafts the sweep very late and fine, rolling the wrists to elude fine leg"
"drawn forward, full face, head over the ball, and blocked to cover"
"twisting back into the right-hander, Buttler shuffles onto the back foot and picks off another single to midwicket. He's ticking like a waiting-room clock"
"another single, picked off to the leg side, no risks needed at this stage"
"width this time, and belted with fierce power,  but straight at short cover"
"back of a length, into the legs, tucked to the on-side for another single"
"<B>into the slot, and slotted into the building site!</B> Dangled into Buttler's arc like a ball of wool into a kitten's bed. And savagely cuffed away, high over long-on!"
"back of a length again, and <B>bludgeoned high into the night sky!</B> He aimed almost vertically upwards, going for height as much as length, and knowing that the two would even out over distance. Suddenly, from a run-ab-ball 21, Buttler is doing a Malan!"
"skidding out to the sweeper as Sipamla serves up another hittable length, with Buttler deep in his crease"
"<B>much better ball, and unluckily called a wide!</B> A cheeky slower-than-slow bouncer, hopping over Buttler's head as he had time to play about four shots, and miss them all"
"still deep in the crease, pouncing on the width with another urgent cut, but gathered at sweeper cover"
"full and straight, dug out on the crease-line, and pushed up to long-on"
"width on a full length, and <B>now Buttler is in full flow!</B> Waiting with his hands raised, deep in the crease, and panning the drive in front of the cover sweeper!"
"swished off the legs, not the best delivery, but Malan's timing is off on this occasion as the ball plugs at backward square"
"<B>massacred into the stands again!</B> This is too good, tossed up into the slot, or what is suddenly the slot, as anything pitching now counts as Buttler's slot. Fierce wrists, rifling high over the leg side!"
"nudged to the leg side, to keep the strike ticking"
"<B>sublime drive to complete another fifty!</B> Holds the pose supremely, and purposefully, as if guiding the stroke perfectly into his pre-ordained gap at extra cover. Strewth"
<B>down on one knee and lashed over midwicket!</B> It hangs in the breeze and drifts over the rope. Easy pickings!
"an open-faced glide into the off side, and England have got their claws deep into this one"
"back of a length outside off, a roundhouse pull to the leg side and a rare fumble from Bavuma as the ball half-volleys him"
"banged in short, Malan was retreating to leg to open up the off side and ended up cramping himself as Nortje pounded it into his ribcage"
"flogged firmly along the deck, as Nortje pitches up outside off, half-stopped at point"
"outside off, slower ball, shaping away, can't connect on the wide-handed wipe"
"full length, dipping into the pads, and plinked off the toes, to fine leg, and up comes a 34-ball fifty ... and an even more rapid 25"
"tapped into the covers, a sharp single to keep the strike. A decent over from Nortje, but South Africa need better than decent now"
"clubbed along the carpet, into the covers, meeting the full length with a full swing"
"<B>Christmas Cactus, that is huge!</B> The most preposterous wind-up, as Ngidi serves up a hopelessly telegraphed slower ball outside off, and Malan smokes that into the brewery, 94 metres away!"
"<B>fast and full, far too full for de Kock!</B> Malan misses the full toss, the ball pitches beyond the stumps and takes a wild bounce off the edge of the pitch, and through the keeper! Lucky he didn't wear that on his nose!"
"a big wind-up, can't connect properly as he flings his hands through the length ball"
"very full, aiming for the yorker, decent ball, Malan wafts through the line and is called through for the single as de Kock swoops behind the stumps"
"fired past the legs, this is getting desperate now for South Africa. Nothing going for them"
"cracked hard out to deep cover, a good finish to the over as Buttler is made to wait on the back foot and settles for the single"
"... <B>nope, is the immediate answer!</B> Back of a length, and Buttler really doesn't get hold of this one, scuffed off the top half of the bat but Hendricks at cow corner can only watch it drift over his head"
"clawed out to the leg side as Shamsi serves up his wrong'un, or legbreak to those of you still baffled by left-arm wristies"
"reverses the hands, and <B>dabbed fine through third man!</B> Literally so, as the fielder fumbles. Whoops"
and now the bowler errs... ho hum
"big spinner, slow through the air, big bite off the turf, as Malan rocks back to cut"
"<B>munched off the back foot, over extra cover!</B> How much time does Malan need for his strokes tonight! This is the innings of a man at the absolute pinnacle of his game"
"<B>vast once more!</B> Down on one knee, launched like Sputnik over long-on! High, higher, and mighty!"
"closes the face on the full length, and chips the single to the leg side"
"humptied up and over point as Malan climbs into the back-of-a-length delivery outside off. Doesn't get hold of it this time, but more runs to the cause"
"well bowled, tight line on a full length, and Buttler responds with a high-elbowed push to point"
"closes the face to nurdle a length ball to leg, and there's no run despite Buttler's best intentions"
"yorker, might have done for a less well-set batsman, but Buttler was able to adjust late and stab it out to cover"
"gets out of the over well, serving up the wide yorker that Malan can't lay bat on. It's all over bar the shouting, surely, but another over like that might just take it deep"
"wafted out to the cover sweeper, searching for the yorker and can't quite find the length"
"<B>well, even when Malan's beaten, he's nailing it!</B> Swings into a cramped pull, beaten for pace, but the spiralling top-edge from the 95mph Nortje swirls to the very edge of the rope at fine leg!"
"open face, pressed to cover"
"<B>crushed through point with such power!</B> Dismissive from Buttler, Nortje offers too much width to go with his extreme pace, and the net effect is bread and butter for Buttler"
"slapped into the covers, this time he can't beat the field"
"right up to the toes, punched from under the eyeline back past the bowler"
"back of a length, tapped down to the leg side to hand the strike back to Malan. A century would be the fitting finale here..."
"<B>that'll help!</B> In the slot, and utterly pelted over long-on once more! Sipamla's lengths have been too predictable, too full, and too easy to butcher!"
"a wild wide, barely hits the cut strip. That won't help Malan's cause!"
"<B>inside out, over extra cover, scores are level as Malan reaches 98!</B> Eased into the gap, South Africa have been flogged here"
"good delivery, and <strong>dabbed into the covers, for the single!</strong> Malan thought he had more runs to play with! That may atone, in Eoin Morgan's mind, for the non-run bye in New Zealand last year.  He finishes on 99 not out, but more importantly England win by a canter to seal a 3-0 series win!"
