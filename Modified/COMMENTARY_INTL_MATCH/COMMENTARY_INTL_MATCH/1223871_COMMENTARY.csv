Got a glove on it and the ball loops up behind Pant. He turns around and dives, the can't hold on to it but he's falling quicker than the ball is, and in the same direction, so he makes another grab at it as he's falling down. Did he get his gloves around the ball in time or as it hit the ground? The umpires have ruled it was ball hitting ground first. And on second viewing, it appears the right call. The ball hit the ground first before being gathered cleanly."

comes on the front foot to work this to backward square leg
"oooh, he had skipped down the track but got it only to short leg. Was well out of his crease, if the man there had collected cleanly, had an opportunity to flick it to the stumps. But that's a tough take, with the batsman coming down the crease and hardly any reflex time"
"swept hard, but straight to backward square leg"

given room and he goes deep in his crease to create the length to this tossed up ball to punch through cover. Superbly timed
"a bit shorter, he goes back this time and uses wrists to flick this through backward square leg. A bit sloppy from the fielder moving to his left, should have intercepted that.

The throw ends up being not great, which is fortunate for Pucovski because he had gone three quarters of the way down for the third run while Marnus hadn't moved. In the end he turned around and had enough time to get back before the relay throw came to the keeper"
"not fully in control but safe. Another short ball, he has to fetch it from outside off without quite having moved decisively across and the ball hangs in the air but there's no one at deep midwicket and it drops safe"
"length on the stumps, goes back to clip this with the turn towards mid-on"

"<b>thwack</b>. The angle from around the wicket gives Marnus room to work with outside off, and it's a tad short, so he rocks back and absolutely thumps it through point"

"bouncer first up, but directed down leg side, so Cummins is able to not get bat near it."
"another loud shout but he was struck outside the line. Siraj wants a review, but Rahane isn't convinced. Length ball jagging in, and actually that's not too much outside the line but it does look like it would go over the stumps.

"<b>Steven Smith has got a hundred and the cricket gods are smiling</b>. Outstanding knock. He's shown some rare emotion on getting there too, punching the bat in the air.

"length ball angling in towards the batsman, Gill once again stays beside the line and defends"
"length ball around off, stays back and blocks"
short of length coming in towards the rib cage. Tapped on the leg side
"fuller around off, half and stride forward and blocked under his eyes"
"peach first up. Pitched just outside off and seamed away, leaving Rohit feeling for it, having squared him up"
"length on a sixth stump, Rohit's happy to let it pass"
"full outside off, Rohit comes nicely forward to defend to cover"
"goes straighter now, targetting the stumps, tailing in a bit at the end, Rohit's bat twists in his hand while defending - probably gripping it loosely so that he can play with soft hands - and he defends it"
"bit of excitement from Hazlewood about a possible lbw but not enough for a sustained appeal and certainly not for a review. Good bowling, inswinger on a length and Rohit's playing down the wrong line as the ball tails in and hits him on the pad. Might have gone down leg and over the stumps"
more solid in defence to this length ball outside off
"banged in short, but a bit too short, so Gill can duck under it fairly easily."
"length, homing onto off stump, defended from the crease"
"fullish on off, comes forward to meet it, gets a thickish outside edge but he's not totally not in control of it, as he played it with soft hands to have it rolling along the ground"
"fuller on the stumps, pushed back to the bowler. Cummins goes down in his follow through to field it and slips a bit. No damage done and he gathers the ball too"
inswinger but Gill was coming forward having read the length and is able to defend solidly enough to send the ball trickling towards midwicket
"super shot but straight back to Cummins who manages to stop it. Full ball on the stumps, punched crisply back"
"length ball nibbling around that off stump, tapped to the bowler's right"
"bouncer on the stumps, he spots it and ducks under"
"goes straighter, and Rohit tucks him off his pads, but can't go past the midwicket fielder"
"Another one that raps the pads, but the height would have taken it over. Hit on top of the pad, to a ball coming into him, as he misses the flick"
"goes fuller now, outside off, but it's full enough for Rohit to come on the front foot and defend"
"keeps it in that channel, tailing into him, but is presented with a solidly straight bat in defence"
"fuller on off, Gill gets his bat down in a hurry to defend it"
"digs it in short and close to off, but Gill deals with it well, punching from close to the body to go through extra cover"
"length on off, gets nicely behind it to defend"
"<b>shot</b>. Stayed really still, watched the short ball rise up outside off and lifted his bat at the last moment to steer it through point from just below his shoulder"
"bouncer, very short though and he has to only bend a little to stay under it"
"that one came into him from a length and he was a touch cramped trying to tuck it away. Hung very fleetingly in the air I think, but fell well short of midwicket"
"tossed up wide of off, comes on the front foot to defend"
"tossed up on that sixth stump line again, Rohit stretches forward to defend"
"closer to the stumps, defended once again on the front foot"
"tossed up, Rohit comes on the front foot and clips it back to the bowler"
"some swerve into the batsman, full length on the stumps, tapped back"
"and that's the length he wants to hit, not quite as full as the rest, but drawing Rohit forward and dipping, takes a thick outside edge off his forward defensive to roll towards the slips"
"back of a length, moving a touch away, punched into the offside"
"well fielded at point. Full ball outside off, jams his bat down to defend, gets a thick edge. Gully dives to his right to stop it"
"almost cut him in half. Back of a length that comes in, gets an inside edge off the high part of the bat onto body. Drops down and Gill has the presence of mind to quickly kick it away before it rolls on the stumps"
"length outside off, defended to cover"
"good length coming back into him, which makes this a brave and confident leave from Gill. But he knew that the ball wasn't coming back enough to threaten off stump and would have gone over the stumps too"
"length on the stumps, defended"
"tossed up on off, defended on the front foot."
"<b>up, up and over</b>. Rohit's had enough of hanging around and defending, spots the opportunity to dance down the track, gets to the pitch of the ball with beautiful footwork and one long languid swing of the bat sends the ball over long-on"
"flatter and quicker, he goes back and works it backward of square. That previous shot made Lyon change his pace"
some turn from a length but Gill stays in his crease and taps it through square leg
"floated up wide of off, stretches well forward to defend"
"this is masterfully done by Rohit. He knew there was no one at fine leg and that Lyon was going to bowl wide of off, so went down early and paddle-swept him fine."
"back of a length outside off, left alone with bat tucked behind body"
"homing in on off stump, Gill stays in his crease and blocks it"
"short ball, too short and easy enough to duck under for Gill"
"good length, hitting that spot that targets the top of off again, but Gill equal to it and defends solidly into the offside"
"back of a length but still in the channel, punched off the back foot to cover"
"first bad ball by Cummins, but it's also brought about by Gill being solid to the good ones, full on the pads and flicked through midwicket"
tossed up on off and Rohit has a textbook forward defence for that

"full outside off, comes confidently on the front foot to defend"
"keeps it on off on a length, Gill happy to defend"
"<b>appeal for caught behind</b> but the umpire's not having it. And no review from Australia. Good delivery, seams in off a length and goes past Gill's inside edge as he's coming forward to defend. Flicks pad on the way to Paine. The noise caused the excitement"

"<b>Wade cops a blow from a Rohit sweep</b>. And no, Rohit didn't tell him 'that's' for Hanuma Vihari'. Went early and swept hard, Wade at short leg cops a painful one"
big appeal for lbw as he's stretching forward to defend but is beaten by the turn to be struck on the pad. Hit outside the line methinks
"nails the sweep this time, clear of Wade, and there is work to do for deep midwicket, running to his right"
"a bit quicker, turns from outside off into him, stays back and pats it down towards where leg slip would have been"
"fuller on off, driven to mid-on from the inside half of the bat"
"<b>super shot</b>. Banged in short but doesn't rise so high, he is in full control as he swivels to pull this off his ribs and times it superbly to find the midwicket boundary"
"<b>That's gone over Tim Paine</b>. Hazlewood wants to show Gill what a real bouncer looks like, and he bangs it in so short it sails over the batsman and keeper"

"a bit flatter, same line, he goes across and taps it towards midwicket"
"length ball, getting some turn is Lyon, that one spins back in from well outside off, but Rohit defends solidly"
"<b>Lyon has won the battle with Rohit</b>, says the umpire. But Rohit reviews a bat pad decision. Good bowling, has forced Rohit to try and manufacture something so he comes down the track, the ball spins from outside off and past his bat. And doesn't look like there is an edge, that might have gone off the pad to short leg.  Unless there is a hint of glove on it. Nope, no glove. Rohit survives. The battle continues. He must have known he hadn't touched it because he reviewed straightaway"

"length on off, tapped to point"
"full on off, driven to cover. Not timed well"

"bouncer on middle and leg, he spots it early and ducks under"
"<b>chips it back to the bowler</b>. Slightly anticlimactic end to the opening stand. Rohit's too early into the push and ends up popping it back. Good reflexes by Hazlewood to grab it in his follow through. Fairly simple grab, with the ball not travelling fast and coming straight at him."

"<b>he's chopped on</b>. Pat Cummins, as he does so often, has produced something. Back of a length outside off, and jagged in appreciably. Too close to cut, which is what Rahane was looking to do, and didn't bounce as much as he expected it to either. Ends up getting the bottom edge of the bat to crash into the stumps"

"tossed up on off, lobs to short leg. <b>Australia are reviewing this, they think they've got him bat pad.</b>. The umpire was not interested in the appeal and Pujara didn't look flustered either. Nice loop and dip, pitches and turns past his defensive push. Doesn't look like there is an inside edge onto pad on that one. Nothing on hot spot and nothing on snicko either.

"good length from Lyon, Pujara was looking to step down again, but couldn't quite get to the pitch and ended up defending"
and Pujara's use of his feet means Lyon bowls it too short this time. Pujara's waiting on the back foot and cuts it nicely through point to collect another boundary

"too full on off, Pujara presents the straight bat and merely pushes it down the ground past Hazlewood's dive that also beats mid-off for four"
"bit over pitched again towards the stumps, Pujara defends it back this time"
"short of length and angling in, Pujara goes on his toes and keeps it down on leg"
"angling into him again from around off on length, he stays back and defends"
"a muted appeal from Paine for a catch down leg, umpire not interested. Much shorter and angling down leg, Pujara looked to play and then withdraw his shot so it went off his hip"
"fullish around off stump, driven down to mid on"
"touch wider but with turn, he goes across on the back foot and defends carefully"
"turning into the stumps again from length outside off, tucked to leg and blocked by short leg"

"towards the stumps again, he defends off the back foot"
"well outside off to end the over, no movement, and Vihari punches it to extra cover"
"comes down the pitch again, takes it on the full and whips the ball to mid-on for a quick single"
"that's a <strong>direct hit</strong> from mid-off and Vihari is barely even trying to drag his bat in! Vihari came down the pitch, pushed the ball down to mid-off and set off for the quick single that probably didn't exist because he was about three-fourths down the pitch when Hazlewood struck the stumps with a direct hit. What an effort from Hazlewood. He put in a dive to his right and somehow threw the ball while falling on the ground and even hit the stumps! Could be the lack of scoring from Vihari that pushed him to go for this"
"Pujara comes down and pads the ball outside off, well down the pitch, and there's an appeal from Australia"
stays back and punches the ball to cover
"stays back again, this one turns into him and he defends it back"
"on the back foot, ball turns into him and he offers the straight bat"
"full toss, Pant won't mind that, and he pushed it down"

"just outside off this time, he opens the face again and finds gully this time"
"bit too full, Pant leans into it and drives this to mid-off"
"bangs in the short ball around off stump, Pant sways out of the line and lets it go. Oh, Starc also has a few words for Pant after that ball. Pant doesn't reply"
just short of length and Pant punches that nicely through the cover point region in the gap for two more
"well outside off, Pujara plonks his front foot well forward and offers the pad"
goes on the back foot this time and gets one by pushing into the covers

"more drivable length outside off, teasing line and length, but he lets it go"
"outside off without much turn, he lets it go"
"closer to the stumps and touch fuller, he blocks this time"
goes a bit wider while delivering and Pant blocks this in front of the stumps
goes back to outside off and Pant leaves again
"touch shorter and hint of room again, Pant slices that for one"
"too short outside off, and plenty of room for Pujara to pounce on that and punch it away for a cracking boundary. Rare poor ball from Lyon"
in the driving zone and Pant pushes that into the covers for a quick second
"shorter ball towards the hips, he helps it to fine leg"
"short all into the batsman from wide of the crease, Pujara doesn't offer a shot and gets hit on the arm guard"
"bangs in a short ball again, Pant is hurried up, he tries to play and at the same time take evasive action and ends up getting some glove as it balloons behind square on leg. Got him into an awkward position for sure"
"short of length and outside off, left alone"
"short of length towards off stump, Pujara hops and blocks it back"
"<b>loud, loud appeal</b> for caught behind down the leg side off Labuschagne's first ball! Paine takes the catch and looks very confident, he quickly consults the bowler and takes a review. Slow motion shows the ball is very close to the glove as Pant tries to pull a short ball, nothing on HotSpot, and no spike on Snicko either. There's a bit of gap between ball and glove in fact. So it stays not out"
"around length on off, Pant takes out the big and powerful slog sweep and smacks that with the turn to the midwicket region for four"
"better length, gets some turn into Pant who gets a thick inside edge to leg"
"turns it away from Pujara outside off, he leans forward and defends"
"nice turn outside off, Pujara leaves it and lets it turn away"

there's the short ball but it's wide outside off and he takes out the upper cut to send that flying over the third man region for four more
this short ball down the leg side which Pant moves away from happily
"the bouncer around off stump this time, good bounce so Pant sways away from the line easily"

"fullish on the stumps, helped along to leg for one more"
"nice turn outside off, Pujara lets it go and it even goes past Paine, but Smith does well to grab it with his left hand"
"left alone again outside off, Paine takes it this time after it turns"
outside the off stump with the angle and Pant leaves it alone
"stifled appeal for lbw as Pant is hit around the leg stump line, but it pitched outside the leg stump"
"oh, short ball that rose towards Pant and he ducked under it just in time"
"back of length around middle and off, Pant stays back and defends close to the pitch"
"around the off stump again, keeps Pant on his toes as he defends this one on off"
"on off stump, Pant defends it towards mid off and realises there's a quick single. Calls for it a bit late but makes it well in time"
turns this one down the leg side past Pant
"better line around off, there's turn and Pant blocks it"
"pretty wide of the crease, this one is fuller and Pan drives it to long on"
"turning it away from the batsman, punched into the covers for one"

"outside off on length, he helps it towards point"
"decent pace and carry outside off, and outside enough to be left alone"
ends the session with a bouncer and Pant ducks under it
"tossed up outside off, padded away to slip"
"fuller on the stumps, stays back to it and plays it on the legside"
nice drift from Lyon - wonder if that will play a part in when the second new ball is taken? - and Pujara defends from the crease on off
"fuller and straighter, comes on the front foot to work it towards midwicket"
"good length, stayed back to whip it. Hung in the air for a mite before bouncing to midwicket"
"length, stays back and whips it off his pads through backward square leg"
"starts off with an almost yorker length ball tailing into him, ends up on the pads and is flicked through square"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"back of a length but slightly too far down leg side, which means Pujara can leave it well alone. Was on a fifth stump line to a left-hander"
"fuller on leg stump now, and shows the full face of the bat to pat it towards mid-on"
"length ball in the channel, left alone."
"fuller but angling well across him and an easy leave outside off. appreciable bounce, as Paine gathers it head high"
"length ball on the stumps, pushed towards mid-on"
"full on off, Pant stays legside of it and plants his front foot forward to drive with authority, but can't go past extra cover"
"full on the stumps, shuffles a bit and taps it to midwicket"
"<b>chopped to the third man boundary</b>. Short ball outside off, and Pant almost seemed to decide on the shot at the last moment, was shaping to cut it but then held himself back a bit and sort of guided it through a fourth slip region"
"length outside off, left alone"
"good length, going across him, he shoulders arms and lets it through"
"length ball, going across him, left alone outside off"
"full but still on a fifth stump and with his angle from over the wicket, that's a straightforward leave everytime"
"length on the stumps, stays beside it and punches it to point"
"slips in the bouncer that time, on leg stump, but short enough to spot early and duck under"
"good length, gets it on the stumps and Pujara brings out the textbook forward defence"
"back of a length on the stumps, gets this to zip past Pujara, who was half forward to defend. Bat close to body though so no danger of the edge coming into play with the ball moving away"
"fuller outside off, Pant leans into the drive, not sure the weight transfer was smooth enough but he gets enough on it to stroke through cover"
"<b>past the outside edge</b>. Pujara's hands are so good, he doesn't follow it. Pitched in the channel and held it's line. Pujara stays inside the line which is why the edge has not come into play"
"length on the stumps, blocked into the legside"
"too full and on the pads, clipped to square leg"
"fuller on the stumps, defended solidly from the crease"
"bouncer outside off, he arches his back to keep out of the way"
"length outside off, defended"
"yorker on the stumps, driven to mid-on"
"<b>beaten</b>. Inviting the drive outside off, and angling the ball in. Pant is a bit too legside of the ball and the stride is not big enough to meet it, goes for the drive and misses"
"this one is straighter, and Pant tries to work it off his pads, but doesn't connect"
"short one, and Pant goes for the pull but cops a blow on the arm. Painful. He's down on the ground now, physio coming out. This was coming into him and up to rib high, he expected it higher though which is why he couldn't connect with the pull and the ball pinged into his left forearm."
"It is indeed short but Pant isn't fazed, and essays the same shot he tried the previous ball - except he connects this time. Controls it well enough too, keeping it on the ground as deep square leg runs to his right to field"
"oooh, was tempted into having a feel for it. Full ball, well outside off on a seventh stump line and Pant drawn into driving at it with feet nowhere close to the ball. Doesn't get the edge"
"this one was bowled closer to off, in the channel, but Pant shoulders arms"
"good bouncer and well dealt with. Rising straight up at his throat, but Pant stays still and defends to keep it down"
"full outside off, nice stride out and Pant meets the ball well, punching it to extra cover"
"back of a length on off, solid in defence is Pant. On the back foot and behind the line to block"
"length on off, again nicely behind it to defend"
"good length in the channel, left alone"
"<b>and now Pujara wears the ball on his body</b>. Sharp bouncer from Cummins again, and Pujara can't get out of the way so he merely turns his body and cops the blow on his left shoulder. Phlegmatic as ever after being hit"
"and perfect riposte, in Pujara fashion. Length ball outside off, opens the face while coming on the front foot, plays with soft hands too, and gets the timing perfect for the ball to race to the third man boundary"
"length coming into him, clipped to square leg"
"fullish on the stumps, tapped towards mid-on"
"bouncer outside off now, but Pujara has to just stay still and tilt his head slightly out of the way to avoid that one"
"another sharp bouncer but Pant does okay with it, though in a bit of a tangle. Spits up from back of a length to his grille and Pant gets hands up and fends it down towards square leg"
"fuller on the stumps, nudged through midwicket to raise a<b>fantastic fifty</b> for Pujara. Battled all the way through it but has stood firm."
"fuller outside off, strides on the front foot to defend towards point"
"<b>taken at first slip</b>. Pant has not been his normal self since that blow to the forearm, and is drawn into another expansive drive to a full ball outside off. Edge flies to Warner's left at first slip, and he holds on. Important breakthrough for Australia, with the new ball"
"bouncer outside off first up, but Jadeja doesn't need to get anywhere near it. Staredown after the ball though, with Jadeja piercing Hazlewood with his gaze and Hazlewood returning it with interest. Ends in smiles for both"
"fullish outside off, defended to cover"
"bouncer, but directed well down legside"
"<b>jaffa</b> and Pujara is caught behind. Back of a length, and he put some shoulder into that as he got it to bounce appreciably. Pujara has been so good at not letting his hands follow the ball but there was nothing much he could do about this. Tries to rise up with it to defend but the ball takes a thin edge off the shoulder of the bat and goes to Paine. Magnificent bowling by Cummins"
"ill-directed bouncer, way down leg. Ashwin doesn't need to get anywhere near it"
"and that's gone through him. Just about missed the outside edge. Full ball on off, straightens and he's left feeling for it"
"fuller on off, comes on the front foot to steer to gully."
"fuller on off, tailing into him, played into the legside on the front foot"
"full outside off, comes on the front foot to punch crisply to extra cover, where Starc fumbles and allows a single"
"length outside off, on the front foot to punch to mid-off"
"short ball, down leg again, Ashwin ducks slightly to let it pass"
"<b>shot</b>. Elegance from Ashwin, with a peachy cover drive to a full ball outside off"
"back of a length, uneven bounce almost got Ashwin in a tangle. He was expecting it to rise to his ribs and had to hurriedly adjust as the ball came to just above waist. Manages to tap it down to the leg side"
"fuller, clipped through midwicket"
"on length and coming in towards the stumps, Jadeja pushes it back"
"little shorter and angling in from outside off, Jadeja taps it towards cover point and wants one but is sent back"
there's the short ball and Jadeja ducks under it
"targets the stumps once again from just outside off, Jadeja pushes it to mid-on this time"
"and another short ball angling in and rising towards Jadeja, he ducks once again"
"back of length and coming in towards the batsman, he hops on the back foot and defends it back"
"turning in from outside off, Ashwin defends on the back foot"
comes down to take the ball on the full and drives that nicely past mid-off for his second boundary
goes back again and helps the ball to leg with the turn
lets the ball turn into him and defends it to the right of short leg
forward lean this time well outside off and he blocks it
"touch tighter, Ashwin leans forward once again for the length delivery outside off and blocks"
"slightly full outside off and slanting away, he leaves it alone"
"looks like another run-out, Ashwin falls short this time! Jadeja dug out this half volley to the right of mid-off and called for the single quickly but Ashwin, not the quickest among the wickets, doesn't give it his all and Cummins does well to throw the ball to the keeper's end"
"welcomes Saini with a bouncer, it's quick and he ducks under it"
towards the pads now and Saini gets some bat and pad to get off the mark with a single to fine leg
he hops on the back foot and defends the short of length ball
"just outside off on length, Jadeja lets it go because of the angle"
lunges forward at the last second and defends the ball to off
"goes on the back foot this time and lets the ball turn in, defends again"
"nicely bowled, Saini neither forward nor back this time, and defends on off again"
"bit more towards middle and leg, Saini goes back and defends"
"full and flighted on middle, Saini drives it hard and back, and Lyon collects it quickly"
"turning in from outside off, Saini defends on off and he keeps strikes with a single"
short ball as expected but it's down leg and Saini doesn't have to move much
"back of length on the stumps, Saini defends on his toes and a misfield at cover from Pucovski gives them two"
"quick short ball, Saini lobs it towards the vacant short cover region, Australians excited, but he's safe"
"cranks it up to 145kmh, another nasty short ball and this time Saini gets the top of the bat towards gully, and sends Jadeja back. Starc has a big smile on his face"
"this is like catching practice. Similar short ball like two balls ago from Starc, Saini is cramped up and hands a dolly to short cover"
it's a bouncer and Bumrah ducks under it quickly
"gets just a bit of room, and Jadeja rocks back to cut that behind square for a handy boundary"
"nicely flighted around off, he lunges forward and blocks this time"
"more towards middle now, leans forward and blocks again"
"on length and quicker at 90kmh outside off, he cuts to point"
"Lyon errs on the pads, and Jadeja happily nudges it to deep midwicket. Settles for one even though there might have been two"
he does well to lean forward to the pitch off the ball and block it
"starts with a short ball that's slanting across, he lets it go"
"proper bouncer, this one closer to Jadeja but he can duck under it easily"
"<strong>another direct hit, third run out of the innings</strong> because Jadeja wanted two. Jadeja flicked this one off the pads just past short leg and he easily got one but he wanted one more to retain strike, and turned around quickly, but Labuschagne did well to quickly pick up and fire a throw at the bowler's end where Bumrah is short"
"short ball, not a bouncer, Jadeja pulls and misses"
"little full, Jadeja goes after it and slogs it down the ground past mid-on and picks up four"
"outside off, Jadeja heaves again and this time gets an edge thick enough to beat Paine's dive to the right side for another four"
"short ball to end the over, Jadeja drops his hands at the end. Siraj on strike for next over"
short ball for Siraj and he lets it go
"wonderful delivery at 141kmh, on length and only a whisker outside off, Siraj drives without moving his feet and misses it"
expects the short ball and ducks under it quickly
tries the yorker this time but it's a low full toss and Siraj pushes it down the ground for two
"that's a cracking cut from Siraj! Makes room early for the ball outside off, and scythes it away past point. He'll be pleased with that"
"bouncer to end the over, he ducks under it. Six from the over"
"starts with the short ball, Jadeja attacks with a hook and he gets enough on that to beat fine leg and it lands just inside the boundary rope"
"goes for a big heave, doesn't middle it at all and the ball goes high right behind the keeper towards the boundary. Lyon chases it from third man and Jadeja hurries back for the second"
"length delivery outside off, Jadeja pushes it into the covers and that's another quick two"
"awkward short ball towards the ribs, makes Jadeja hop and he defends."
"<strong>almost taken at short leg</strong>! Jadeja flicks that and it went quickly to Labuschagne's right, he did very well to get a hand to it but it didn't stick in"
"short ball outside off, Jadeja ramps and it's hurrying towards the boundary where Lyon does very well to slide and save a few. Jadeja keeps strike"
Jadeja makes room early for the short ball and scythes that fine to third man. They decide against the single
"the short ball barrage continues, Jadeja lets this one go"
goes for the cut outside off and misses this time
"short ball rising on Jadeja, he stays back and keeps it down"
"another run out on the cards, not a direct hit this time. Jadeja nudges the ball to leg and Siraj wants one so that Jadeja keeps strike for next over, he's sent back quickly and the midwicket fielder misses the stumps at the bowler's end"
"short, pulled and that's four! Useful runs for India but it means Siraj on strike against Starc in the next over"
"oh, he's ducked under it almost as soon as it's been delivered. Siraj sees the ball come out of the hand and ducks, and then has a smile for Cummins"
"makes room early this time, it's short again and he tries to get bat on it but misses"
doesn't move much this time and ducks yet again under the bouncer
"It's a length delivery that's close to the stumps, and it's actually been given out because Australia believe there was an edge. Wasn't much of an appeal there but he was given out almost immediately. India review and Snicko confirms there was an outside edge as Siraj tried to poke after backing away a bit"
"length on the pads and glanced to fine leg to get off the mark straightaway. Oh that came off the pad, so it's a leg bye. Warner not of the mark yet"
"length on a fifth stump line and moving away, left alone"
"moving away again outside off, and he shoulders arms again"
"good length on off, defended into the offside"
"this one nips back in from outside off, and Pucovski defends solidly"
"bouncer, and dealt with superbly by the debutant. Climbs on an offstump line but he gets into good position to pull this to deep midwicket with authority. The momentum of the swivel made him lose balance and fall down, but after the shot had been hit. There was no need to run anyway"
"on target, attacking the stumps and hitting a good length, defended from the crease"
"back of a length outside off, pushed into the offside"
"hurried him a bit, coming into him from a length and he jabs at it from the crease, keeping it out"
"fuller, defended back down the pitch"
"good bowling, after bringing them in, he jags this one away, going across Warner, who was coming forward to defend and can't stop his hands from a tiny movement following the ball. Movement is enough to elude the edge"
"fuller, tapped to mid-off"
"fuller on off, defended towards mid-on"
"length on the stumps, defended on the front foot"
"<b>cracking shot</b>. Too short outside off, doesn't really rise, so he has the room and length to essay a superb backfoot punch through cover"
"fuller on off, comes on the front foot to defend"
"length outside off, defended to cover"
"length, closer to off, bat close to body as he defends to cover"
"<b>that one kept low</b>.  Length ball outside off, it's a brand new ball, should have been zipping through but it scoots at just above ankle height."
"fuller outside off, driven to cover on the front foot"
"length, going across him, stays in his crease and punches to cover"
"fuller, going across him, lands outside off and going further away"

"length ball coming in on off, pushes at it, gets a thick inside edge to square leg"

"length on the stumps, closes the bat face while keeping it near his body to get  a couple through midwicket"
"fuller outside off, defended to cover"
"<b>gets the outside edge</b>. Superb ball, not much Pucovski could do. Banged in on a hard length and gets it to move appreciably away. Pucovski shaping to defend but the ball kisses the outside edge and Saha dives to his right to hold on."
"full on the pads, and he turns it, using wrists, to get off the mark with a brace through midwicket"
"tired the yorker I think but missed it narrowly, which allowed Warner to on-drive beautifully, to the long-on fence"
"length outside off, punched to cover"
"back of a length outside off, cuts it forcefully but straight to cover"
"length on off, coming into him, defended"
"homing in on that off stump is Bumrah, but Warner's moving confidently now. On the front foot to defend solidly"
<b>shot</b>. Gets a bit of margin and makes it count. A mite too full outside off and he's on that front foot to punch through cover
"full on off, defended back. Siraj has a shy at the striker's end, except the ball is nowhere near the stumps. Saha jumps up to collect and prevent an embarrassing four overthrows"
rocks back to this short ball and pulls with authority through square leg. Nicely transferred weight back and swivelled to generate power while also controlling it
"length outside off, defended"
"length outside off, pushed into the offside"
"fuller on leg stump, flicked off his pads to square leg"
"angling in on off, fuller ball, defended"
"fullish, angling into him, tucked through midwicket"
"short ball outside off, thought about pulling but decided against it, so wafted the bat over the ball to ensure he wouldn't touch it"
"<b>magnificent</b> and disdainful. Bit of a gift, short and wide outside off, but he deals with it in a manner so pleasing to the eye. Stands tall and slaps it through cover with superb timing"
"length coming into him on off, defended towards mid-on"
"room outside off again, and on the shorter side, stays beside it and punches through point"
"full and wide outside off, he goes for the drive and connects smoothly. There is a sweeper back though, so he mops up"
"fuller, comes on the front foot to defend"
"<b>he's trapped him lbw</b> but Warner wants to review this, almost immediately. Was floated up on a length and going straight on, Warner went for the slog-sweep. The ball wasn't full enough for it, so he misses it entirely and is struck on the back leg. <b>Hawkeye says umpire's call on impact</b>, so Warner will have to be on his way. Ashwin has had the wood over him historically, and does it again."
goes back and whips this through midwicket
"fuller, uses wrists to turn it through square leg, staying back in his crease"
dances down the track and gets to the pitch to drive through mid-on

"<b>beaten</b>. Goes for the drive to a length ball that's nipping in outside off, and doesn't connect"
"length on the stumps, clipped to midwicket"
"muted appeal, but I think that's sliding down leg. Ashwin is convinced and he has convinced Rahane to take a review. This was tossed up on leg stump, Smith went for a hard slog-sweep and missed it, beaten by the loop, but the ball pitched and was turning into him. Surely sliding down. And after a delay with Hawkeye, we finally confirm that was missing leg stump. In fact it was <i>just</i> clipping, so India get to hang on to their review."
"lovely bowling, nice loop on a length and turning  in from off, Smith defends"
"tossed up a bit fuller, and Smith pushes it gently. The fielder at mid-on who is almost beside the non-striker gathers"
goes back to this and opens the face to half-edge and half-steer it through gully
"length outside off, punched back to the bowler"
turn for Ashwin. Marnus was making room to punch but it spins sharply into him and he ends up softly patting it towards silly point
"back of a length outside off, straightens a touch, jabbed towards backward point. Got it higher on the bat, with the bounce a touch more than he expected"
length ball defended back to the bowler
"length on off, defended"
low bounce again. Back of a length and Smith was looking to pull that into oblivion but the ball sneaks under bat to thud into his thigh pad
"length on off, turned to backward square leg by closing the bat face. He's overstepped though, so that's a no-ball"
"fuller on off, defended to cover"
"length on off, turned to midwicket."
"slow full toss at 84.6kmh, Labuschagne sweeps that away in the gap on the leg side for a four"
"too short and wide, he cuts and finds the fielder"
"turning in towards the stumps now, he goes back and tucks it to deep midwicket"
shouts of 'catch it' as Smith also goes back and nudges the ball with the turn off the pads for one

short and wide for the second time this over and this time Labuschagne cuts it wide of point for three
"targets the stumps with a good-length delivery, he defends it to leg"
"<strong>just short of gully</strong>! Outside off, Labuschagne pushes at it away from the body for a thick edge, Rahane dives to his left with both hands but it doesn't carry"
closer to the stumps and this time it's steered to deep point
"angling into the stumps for Smith, he goes across and works this wide of mid on"
"too short, Labuschagne gets on top of it with a pivot on the back foot and pulls it away with style for four behind square"
"short on off this time, he slices it to deep point and keeps strike again. Lead over 150 now"
works this ball with the turn to the leg side for one
"flighted around off at 85.5kmh, Smith leans into it and drives to long-on"
"<strong>beats him</strong>! Labuschagne lunges forward for the off break outside off, it turns a long way and hits him on the pad but was probably hitting him outside off"
bit quicker and he defends it back
"comes out of the crease, Ashwin slows it down and the batsman works it to leg for one"

"doesn't time it as well but still gets it over long-on! This was not as full as the previous one, more bottom hand in this as he doesn't get fully underneath. Goes flatter than the last ball but still sails over long-on."

"<b>take that</b> says Green. If you bounce me, I'll send you over the fence. And not just that, I'll do it on the front foot to a ball that's homing in on my head. Bumrah banged it in hard and it was rising, but Green hooks it on the front foot over square leg."
"and now the length ball, nipping in, Green stepping away to thrash it again, but is beaten. Or is he? Saha's gone up in spontaneous appeal and the umpire has given it. Green takes a pause and then reviews. There is a spike as the ball passes bat, and it does look like it took a feather of an inside edge, so Green's entertaining knock ends. Bumrah has some reward at last, having bowled his heart out."

"length outside off, punched to mid-on"
"length on the stumps, defended"
"<b>he's been caught at backward square leg</b>. Rohit will be filthy with himself for that dismissal.

"length outside off, spinning in a fair bit, Rahane goes right back and flicks it off his pads"
"<b>got him at short leg</b>. Australia have their early breakthrough and it's a big one. Rahane was coming on the front foot to defend, Lyon bowled this on the perfect length so that Rahane couldn't get to the pitch even with a full stretch.

there's the short ball - I expected one a bit earlier to Pant actually - but it's too short and he ducks under easily
"another short ball, outside off and Pant decides to go for the shot, but he doesn't go hard. Had to fetch it from over his left shoulder, ended up just sort of lobbing it into the legside. Square leg is back at the boundary so it lands safely. Might have winced a bit while playing that shot too, perhaps that elbow is hurting him"
nicely behind it to defend to mid-on
<b>was that a thin edge?</b> Not such a thin one actually. Nice loop outside off and Pant gets the edge going forward to defend. Paine can't hold on to that will go down as a <b>dropped chance</b>. Got the bottom of his gloves
