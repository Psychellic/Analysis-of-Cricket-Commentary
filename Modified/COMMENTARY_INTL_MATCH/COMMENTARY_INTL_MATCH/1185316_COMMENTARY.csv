"back of a length, bit of width, 84mph/135kph and Warner <strong>carves it away through the covers off the back foot</strong>! Bit of a freebie to start, nicely timed with a cross bat"
"<strong>Warner goes second ball, and Steyn is pumped!</strong> Length ball, plenty of bounce, found the top edge as he looked to flick it into the leg side, and it flew up to Shamsi at long leg on the boundary. Steyn brings out a slow-motion chainsaw celebration, and Warner looks disgruntled at the extent to which that shot up from a length"

"bit of width outside off, driven to extra cover where Phehlukwayo <strong>makes a superb stop low to his left</strong>. Saves three runs"
"shuffles over to the off side, and Steyn looks to fire one in at the ribs. Called wide, harshly I'd suggest. Good bounce and carry"

"short ball, whirled on the pull towards short fine leg, Zampa cuts it off"
"top-edged on the pull, this is going to be a tough one... <b>but Zamps holds it running back!</b> The ball stayed up for an age, after Smuts failed to get hold of it, and Zampa must have been running around in circles from short fine leg, as he suddenly shot into view and grabbed on, before falling back and slamming his head into the turf.

"pushed through from over the wicket, turned with the spin for a couple"

pushed through on the stumps and nudged behind square on the leg side
"fired across the bows from round the wicket, Rabada slaps a cut to deep backward point"
"<b>pegs back leg stump!</b> That's a bingo for Agar, who has career-best figures! Dirty ole slog across the line from van Biljon, the ball gripping just enough as it skidded on underneath the bat. South Africa eight down and hurting"

"drops back and cuts, gets it through for a scrambled single"
