"appeal for lbw and caught behind! But the umpire says no to both. Full on middle, and the sweep hits his pad and then goes to the keeper. Was there glove off QdK? And was that lbw if it was pad first? Sri Lanka are reviewing, so let's find out. Looks like the ball hit his pad, and so the umpire says not out for the catch. <b>But why isn't the umpire looking at the lbw?</b> Looks like Mathews is protesting. And now the third umpire checks for the lbw: not out there too. All good."
