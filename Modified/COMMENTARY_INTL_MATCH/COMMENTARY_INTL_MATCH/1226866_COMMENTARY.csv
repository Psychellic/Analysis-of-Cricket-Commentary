"arm ball, good wobble into the bat as Heazlett defends awkwardly"
"drops a little short of a length, Heazlett nudges towards mid-on"
"gives himself room, stepping outside leg stump early. Green bowls full at off stump, but Heazlett swings hard through the ball and crashes it through the covers for four!"
"goes again, this time lofting <strong>inside-out over the covers for four more</strong>! Goes again, backing away, and Green gets his line slightly wrong. Heazlett doesn't time it well, but gets it over the ring and it trickles over the rope"
"<strong>three in a row!</strong> Bit of width outside off and slightly too short, and Heazlett finds the gap at point with a cut shot"
"fullish outside off, slashes hard and outside-edges over point for four! Looked to go over cover, but it skewed away off the outside of the bat and flew over point"
"flat legbreak, worked out to deep square leg"
legbreak on the stumps which flicks Heazlett on the pad as he shapes to work to leg. Strangled appeal but sliding down leg

"length on the stumps, defended towards mid-off"
"142kph, full on off stump, and pressed out to long-on for a couple"
"slower ball, out the back of the hand I think, but Bryant stands tall and picks it. He clubs this dead-straight down the ground, and it flies over the rope after a couple of bounces. <strong>Great shot, great start for the Heat</strong>"
"slower ball, back of a length, and Heazlett eases into the pull, clubbing him over square leg for four! Bit of a pie to start, to be honest"
"<strong>picks out deep backward square!</strong> Back of a length again, pace-on this time, and Heazlett finds Ross on the rope. Straight down his throat - couldn't have offered him an easier chance if he'd tried - and it's a straightforward catch"
"angled across him, steered out to backward point"
"slower ball, completely foxes Bryant who prods into the channel and can't lay a bat on it"
"short ball, <strong>top-edged over the keeper for a two-bounce four!</strong> Good bounce and carry, despite this only being at 133kph. Bryant tried to swat into the leg side, but only managed to top-edge over Holt's head"
pressed into the leg side to complete the powerplay
"sharp legbreak, Lynn comes forward to prod towards mid-on and it <strong>rips past the outside edge and narrowly misses the top of off stump</strong>. What a start for the leggie"

"wrong 'un which skids on, pressed out to deep backward point"
"down the leg side, clipped to deep midwicket"

"tossed up wide of the off stump, chipped to Ferguson at extra cover on the edge of the ring who <strong>takes a good catch!</strong> That's the end of Bryant, just as he was looking to get himself going. Cook sets him up well, first bowling from wide on the crease and skidding it into his pads, then floating one up wide and inviting the big shot. Top stuff"

"loopy legbreak down the leg side, Lynn mistimes it completely and it loops harmlessly into the leg side"
"<strong>Lynn's 150th BBL career six</strong>. Tossed up outside off, and Lynn frees his arms, drilling this over wide long-off for a maximum"

"full yorker at leg stump, dug out back to the bowler"
"wide outside the off stump, crashed over the off side again, one bounce. Sangha has started trying to bowl defensively, but it's short and wide enough for Lynn to crunch him over extra cover. <strong>That's 50</strong>"
"flatter and straighter, looks to work into the leg side but it squirts out to cover via a leading edge"
"full on the stumps, Lawrence digs it out back to the bowler"
"gives himself room on the cut, but can't beat backward point in the ring"

"full and straight, fired through quickly, and Lynn punched out to long-off"
"half-hearted appeal as Lynn is struck high on the thigh getting down to sweep, and it dribbles into the off side for a leg bye"
"tossed up, Lawrence gives it the big heave-ho and sends it <strong>dead-straight back over the bowler's head for six!</strong> That's the first time he's middled one in this competition, and he sends it 82 metres down the ground. 50 stand."
"big wind-up to the wide-on-the-crease ball, Lawrence sends it to third man on the bounce"
"<strong>picks out Hales at long-off!</strong> Important wicket, just as Lawrence was getting going. Tried to go down the ground once more, but not a good connection this time, and found Hales 10 yards off the rope. Gave himself a bit of room, but Cook followed him nicely"
"flat and wide outside off stump, crashed out to deep cover"
"full on fourth stump, pushed out to long-off to keep the strike"
shapes to reverse-sweep but misses it by miles. Not sure that's Cooper's shot

"length ball, on the stumps, clipped to short midwicket for one"
"quick legbreak, good turn away from the bat, and Cooper steers to deep point"

"wrong 'un slides onto the bat and Lynn checks his shot, punching towards mid-off"
"slides a full ball across him, which Cooper thuds out to long-on"

"low full toss, miscued to midwicket on the edge of the ring for a sharp single"
"full on the pads, clubbed down the ground to long-on on the bounce where Cutting gets round to cut it off brilliantly. Just a single, too"
"uses his feet to come down the pitch and give himself a little room. A fraction full of a length, angled across the right-hander, but Lynn <strong>threads the gap between deep cover and long-off</strong>. Super shot, chipped nonchalantly"
"<strong>rips out off stump!</strong> No better sight for a fast bowler. Cooper had shuffled across to cover off stump, McAndrew missed his yorker by a fraction and this was probably in the slot, to be honest. But Cooper couldn't get bat on it, and turned around to see his stump flying towards the Tasman Sea"
"length on fourth stump, nudged to short extra cover"
"charges down the wicket, drilling this straight to Ferguson at short cover. Raced out of the middle but Ferguson got down well"
"short ball, Wildermuth lines it up early and <strong>pulls over deep backward square for six!</strong> Didn't get all of it, but still flies 74 metres onto the concourse. Don't think he saw it that early, but more than enough on it to beat the man"
lofted straight over mid-off. It plugs in the outfield and Cutting cuts it off running back
"length ball, Lynn lines him up and <strong>clubs straight down the ground for six!</strong> Didn't get much of it, but it landed <i>just</i> over the rope. Can't be bowling length balls to Lynn at the death..."
"yorker, clipped to midwicket for one"
"Lynn sends this up, up, up... and <strong>straight down deep midwicket's throat</strong>! Lynn was hitting into the wind, and that has helped the Thunder. Length ball from Green, not what he would have planned. But Lynn didn't get all of it looking to heave over the leg side, and after it swirled in the Canberra breeze, Alex Ross was underneath it and had enough awareness of his position to avoid treading on the rope"
"yorker on fifth stump, guided down past short third man for a couple"
"full toss towards the base of off stump. Clubbed into the breeze again, and Ross is settling under it at deep wicket... <strong>but it clears him by a matter of inches and drops the far side of the rope!</strong>"
"Wildermuth shuffles across to the off side, Green follows him but it's too short and right in his hitting arc. <strong>He slog-sweeps, and clears Ross on the rope more comfortably this time!</strong>"
"full on the stumps, clipped out to square leg for one more, keeping the strike for the last over"
"wild full toss outside off, <strong>crashed over wide long-off for six!</strong> Shin-high full toss at 133kph, and that's a freebie for a man in good touch. Clubbed 70 metres into the stands"
"cutter, slightly full of a length on leg stump, and miscued up to Sangha at short third man. Catch is taken, and that brings a thrilling cameo to an end. Great stuff from Wildermuth, just what the Heat were missing in their first game."
"full on fifth stump, gets low to swipe out to deep midwicket"
"slower-ball, yorker just outside off stump. Steketee swings and misses, and is sent back trying to scramble through for a bye"
"slower ball, lands halfway down the pitch, and Steketee swings hard. He is miles away from getting this off the middle, and swings mightily at thin air"
"<strong>nicks him off!</strong> Or does he? Full outside off, Steketee swings hard, gets a tickle through to the keeper, and everyone stands there. The umpire doesn't give him out, they don't attempt the bye, and Steketee walks off - but is he walking, or just walking off for the interval? Sams' expression suggests it's the latter, as he looks absolutely seething not to have been given a wicket. Looked and sounded like he had smashed it, but the umpire reckons otherwise!"
"over the wicket, fullish at 137kph and punched for on into the cover coming forward on off stump"
"<strong>timberrrrrrrrrrrr!</strong> Hales is bowled through the gate first up! Lovely angle from Wildermuth, the fresh Kooka coming back in off the seam - through a sizeable gap left by the batsman, it's probably fair to say. Perfect start for Heat with the ball"
"full and driven square, bit of 'Yes', 'No' from the new pair and Ferguson eventually ambles back"
"shortish outside off, seaming in a fraction again and defended towards gully"
fuller length on off stump and punched int the covers half forward - another dot
"<strong>plinked to mid-off and Wildermuth has two in the over!</strong> Tough to hit him off that length and Ferguson perishes with a flappy drive that barely reaches the edge of the ring... Two big blows and Thunder are 1 for 2 (or 2 for 1, if you really must)"
tossed up and <strong>biffed through the covers!</strong> Khawaja clips his first boundary to get Thunder back in the black
shortish on leg stump and Uzzie pulls this down towards deep backward square for a couple
<strong>rocks back and carves this over backward point!</strong> Not all that much width on offer but he manages to hack it away through the circle for four more
"quicker ball, nicely bowled and it beats Khawaja attempting to dab off the back foot"
tossed up on the pads and nudged square
<strong>full and swept and that's four more!</strong> Ross latches on to his first ball and dispatches behind square
pitched up full and driven off the stumps to cover
"hard length, 138kph and shaping back in as Ross chops down for a single fine of gully"
"<strong>smunched over midwicket on the pull!</strong> Short ball, sat up for the shot, and he nails it"
"<strong>charges and slashes, Peirson snaffles the edge!</strong> It's the Hour of the Be-Wildermuth (one for the Badly Drawn Boy fans out there)! Three wickets in ten balls for the allrounder, and Thunder are threatening to go with barely a squeak"
"140kph in the channel outside off, carved down to third man"
"back of a length, Ross comes across and rides the bounce"
"hammers a length, 145kph and punched square coming across, picks up the single"

"tight stuff, hitting the splice as he again opts for defence on off stump"
short of a length outside off and dabbed square
"length ball, comes across and pushes this for one"
"dug in at 138kph, Ross rides the bounce and takes a single dropped into the off side"
"<strong>smoked over midwicket!</strong> The bumper sits up outside off, and Holt whirls it away confidently for his first four"
<strong>edged wide of the diving Peirson!</strong> Wildermuth draws another indeterminate prod on off and nearly bags another!
"back of a length, jabbed into the covers"
"<strong>whipped off the pads</strong>, Steketee loses his line and gives up a gimme four"
"length ball outside off, Ross comes across and glides one to third man"

"hits the deck on off stump, Ross steers this gently down into the covers for a quick single"
"fiendish length, 136kph and Holt is feeling for it, the ball zipping away past the bat through to Peirson"
short outside off and he drops back to run one behind square again
"<strong>close to a run-out at the striker's end!</strong> Holt is slow to respond to the call, but Dan Lawrence can't hit one-and-a-bit stumps running up from backward point"
shortish and chopped through backward point for one more
"pitched up on the stumps, 134kph and worked through square leg - that's Wildermuth done, a sterling 3 for 23 from his four"
"floated up full, Ross reverse-sweeps through backward square"
full on the stumps and Holt sweeps in orthodox fashion for a couple
"<strong>appeal for lbw</strong>, Holt pinned on the front pad trying to reverse... think he got some glove on the shot"
fired in and this is tapped back watchfully
"pushed through on middle and leg, Holt attempts to reverse again, misses but so does Peirson... given as byes"
"drops short, Holt swings this away to deep square on the pull"
"length ball, wobbling around the line of off, steered through backward point"
fullish and prodded towards mid-off
"<strong>swatted high over mid-on!</strong> Not a clean hit as it got big on Holt's pull, but he just about got enough on it"
"angling in with the arm, dinked towards cover"
"<strong>whipped past the dive of short fine leg!</strong> Sliding on to the pads, Mujeeb stuck out a hand but it flashed by him"
<strong>crunched!</strong> Innocuous bouncer from Laughlin and Ross muscles it out towards cow corner on the bounce
"pushed through quickly on off, Holt is beaten and there's an appeal for lbw... maybe high, outside off"
"<strong>chipped tamely to long-on!</strong> Mujeeb breaks the stand, they had to try and get after him in pursuit of the bonus point, but Holt couldn't get under a flat, skiddy ball"
fired in and hoicked leg side as Ross shuffles across
"lobbed up on off stump, textbook straight drive through mid-off for Cutting's first run"
"fired into the pads as Ross sweeps, looked like a legbreak from Mujeeb but not straightening enough"
"full on off, 92kph and toe-ended back to the bowler - so Heat swipe themselves a Bash Boost, too"
"tight line and length from round the wicket, compact drive to long-off"
makes room to the leg-side and<strong> flogs an inside-out drive through extra cover!</strong> Lovely strike
swipe across the line and a top-edge over the keeper's head. Safe enough
"<strong>splat!</strong> Ross is hampered by a groin strain, apparently, and that's not going to help his stretching. A slow-motion yawn of a pull across a length ball on off stump, and back goes the peg with the bat arcing into a different realm!"
"back of a length, 'excellent speed', is the cry through the stump mic as Sams pumps his drive off the back foot"
"nudged to mid-on, the end of a successful over as Heat tighten their grip"
driven with a compact stance into the covers
"line and length, and firmly pushed to cover again. This is very standard"
"less standard, as Laughlin serves up the slower ball, and Cutting plays over the top of it with a loose cut"
"drilled with an open face, straight to short cover, and Cutting groans audibly on the stump mic"
"<strong>inside-out, and donked over the top!</strong> So deep in the crease, and it's only a checked drive, but the timing is spot on, as Cutting chooses his moment to launch!"
"back of a length, thumped firmly into the covers but can't beat the field this time. Still, he's going at a run a ball, so that's something"
"wicket to wicket line, just held back in the flight as Sams drills a drive to cover"
"slow through the air, tempting the batsman to make something happen, but Sams simply tucks the length ball to leg"
beaten off the pitch as Mujeeb finds that awkward in-between length. Cunning bowling
"<strong>that one's in the slot!</strong> Sams has seen enough, and slogs across the line, picking it up on the half volley with aplomb over midwicket!"
flipped off the toes to midwicket
"back of a length, outside off, and <strong>crashed through point!</strong> That's ferocious boshing, right over the stroke, and some impetus at last"
"battered down the ground as Laughlin bangs one in short! That's excellently picked up, a tennis smash back past the bowler, with the ball at eyebrow level"
"aimed for the tailing yorker, and thumps Cutting on the knee, just enough in-movement to elude his fizzing bat"
"Cutting makes room to leg, Laughlin spears in the length ball outside off. Well bowled, and no stroke as he's off balance"
"<strong>dumped through long-on!</strong> A loud groan of 'no!' from the bowler, who knew instantly he'd overcooked that one, right in Cutting's arc, and one bounce inches inside the rope"
"<strong>straight and savage!</strong> After a sluggish start, Cutting is taking it to his old team-mates now! The chat at the start of his innings was designed to rattle him but he's finding his poise now. Holds the poise with a high blade!"
<strong>bouncer! Rowdy cricket!</strong> Cutting limboes inside the line as the ball zings through. Battle is joined!
"<strong>jeepers, how did that miss!</strong> Inswinging yorker, and misses leg by the slenderest of whiskers!"
"misses his mark, and <B>flicked with disdain off the legs!</B> A languid pick-up and that's gone many a mile!"
"good response, round the wicket, spearing the ball across the right-hander on a very full length, and the new angle confounds his attempts to drive through the line. A precious dot"
"<strong>missed the mark again, and pounded over cow corner!</strong> A knee-high full toss, and Sams timed that so sweetly! A heavy bat and good timing on the heave!"
"width outside off, but Sams can't connect on the wipe through point. Takes the toe-end out to the fielder"
"banged in short, and Sams gloves his attempted pull past the attentions of short backward square. A long chase and that's 15 off the over despite three dots... this one is going to the wire!"
"back of a length, very hittable, but short cover is well positioned as Sams slaps his drive"
"wrong line, and <strong>hauled around the corner!</strong> Sliding down leg, and that was a gimme for a well-set batsman"
lobbed into the outfield at midwicket
"attempted helicopter shot from outside off, Dhoni-style, minus the power or timing, out to midwicket"
"battered with a crossed-bat, back past Mujeeb in his followthrough. Long-off gathers"
"Good finish to the over, and his spell. Length ball, drawing a respectful drive back down the pitch"
"wide line, Sams threatens to follow it, but pulls out, and gets the extra"
"<strong>inside-out poundage</strong>, over the covers off the back foot! That's tremendous power and placement, and it's put Thunder right in the driving seat at the start of this over"
"flashed into the covers, to rotate the strike"
"moshed off a back-of-a-length, back over the bowler's head, one bounce to long-off as he hurtles round"
"good variation of pace, down to 85kph that time, poked to cover"
"waiting with bat raised, on the back foot, flogged out to cow corner, but there's a man back to tidy up"
"tapped to long-on, that's 11 off the over, more than adequate to stay up with the rate"
"<strong>powerful biffage off a full length</strong>, and that draws a fumble at long-off, to allow Cutting to hustle back"
"<B>gottim!</B> Steketee responds with a perfect length offcutter, slapping the top of middle as Cutting swings across the line. And don't the Heat love that! They've had the final word against their old team-mate, but can Cutting's new chums get the last laugh?"
"<strong>Heat from the Heat!</strong> A seriously sharp short ball first-up, and Green misses on his pull... didn't so much miss in fact as Steketee hit! Flush on the arm"
"slower ball, clever response, another cutter, and this one hops over the bails where Cutting's found its target. Green's wipe was through too soon"
"<strong>crucial boundary!</strong> Just enough length to work with, and clubbed through long-off!"
"a violent drive back through the line, and a deflection off the shins! Probably saved another boundary"
"<strong>oh my, that's a terrible freebie!</strong> Surely an attempted yorker, but Laughlin spears in the beamer, and gets dispatched over square leg for his sins... that could have changed the game..."
"full and straight, so near to the base of leg, Sams walks across his stumps so he gets away with the wide. Well bowled"
"well bowled again, a yorker outside off, Sams can't lay bat on it as he attempts a steer through third man"
"<B>another full toss, and Sams slams another six for his fifty!</B> Just 23 balls, and that's another horror ball from Laughlin. Outside off, juicily in the arc, and munched!"
"<strong>back of a length, same result!</strong> Hammered, up up and away, onto the grass banks at cow corner where there's an utter frenzy to gather these freebies!"
"<strong>Inside out over extra cover, and Thunder have won by a landslide!</strong> An utter meltdown from Heat, and what a response from Sams! In the slot for a free swing through the line, and he nailed it again!"
