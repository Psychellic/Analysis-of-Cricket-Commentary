"goes full and straight, veers in late and Warner gets a thickish inside edge to midwicket. <strong>A misfield allows the single</strong>"
"<strong>beamer!</strong> Oh, my. Bairstow had to duck for cover. First ball in the IPL. <b> Prasidh receives a first warning </b> and Bairstow gets a free-hit"

flicks this tossed up delivery to midwicket
"<strong>pierces the gap!</strong> This is flatter and fuller, Warner makes room and blasts this through cover"
"huge appeal but this pitched way outside leg. Warner struck on the pad as he misreads the googly. DK discusses very animatedly and takes a review. <b> They may have miscalculated big, KKR lose a review. </b> Move on, don't waste time, please."

full toss and he's flicked this nicely to deep square
"clears his front leg and goes over cover, the timing not quite there and the cover fielder hares back to stop the ball"

flicks well but Dre Russ stops well with the dive at mid-on. <strong>Saved three runs</strong>
"he's clubbed this to the midwicket boundary. Poor ball, too short and Warner was waiting."
"excellent googly, breaks back in sharply from outside off. Bairstow looks to whip through midwicket but appears to have missed it. But snicko shows a small spike as ball passed the bat. <b> Saved by a very minute deviation. </b>"
"drifting into middle and leg, tucked wide of midwicket and they scamper back. Shubman Gill had to come in a long way from the ropes."

"<strong>beaten for pace!</strong> Lovely delivery, yorker-length just outside off, Bairstown feels for the ball, beaten on the inside edge"

squirts this full delivery off a thick inside edge to midwicket
"<strong>another beamer!</strong> This one nearly knocks Warner out as he's on the floor in trying to negotiate that. Somehow manages to get bat on it, just lands short of Uthappa at midwicket. <B> Poor call, not given a no-ball </b>"

makes room and punches to sweeper cover

"swung away, one bounce to deep midwicket"
"fired full on the stumps, punched to deep cover again"
"this one goes away, pushed to the man coming in from point"
"stuck on the pad with one that spins back in. Bairstow plays all around it but <strong>KKR can't review because they burnt one.</strong> This looked quite close, possible it impact may have been just outside off but need replays to confirm that"
looks to wallop across the line but toe-ends this length ball to midwicket
full toss that has been driven to deep point
chops this to point for a quick single. Didn't have the room
"<strong>crash! No one moved</strong>, hit so hard. Length ball angling away, Warner makes a hint of room and wallops this through cover. Narine put his hand out to stop, but this one chipped his nails. Ouch, that must hurt"
"short and angling away, Warner reaches out to upper cut that over third man. What a way to bring up his half-century, <strong>his 37th in IPL</strong>. Both feet were off the ground as he swiped at that"

"quicker and flatter on the stumps, flicked off his legs to wide long-on"
"floated up around off, and clubbed this down to long-off"

"quick ball on the fifth stump, Bairstow goes to drive with feet static, gets an inside edge that misses the stumps and rolls to short fine leg"
"length ball on the stumps, Warner chops it off the back foot into the cover region. He didn't time it that well so the ball wasn't travelling quick. But Warner is quick on his feet and spots the opportunity of a second run, runs like the wind to make it"
"full toss on the leg stump, lost his length going for the yorker. Flicked off his hips to deep square leg"
"quick one back of a length down leg, so quick that Dinesh Karthik can't gather it cleanly. No signal from the umpire when they took a single, so maybe a bit of glove on that. Yes there was, so that is a <b>drop</b> by Karthik! Costly one"
"<b>unlucky for Lockie</b> Bairstow goes for another pull without feet moving too much, gets another inside edge. This one runs past the stumps very fine and for four"
"another quick bouncer, jags in from outside off. He's too late on the pull and gets pinged below the shoulder. they take a single with the ball rolling towards short third man"
"googly, overpitched, he goes back and makes room to chop it into the offside"

"sweeps it square this time, but there is protection i nthe deep"
"another googly, Bairstow was backing away, ends up being cramped for room and pushing it into the offside"
"<b>another googly gets him</b> pitched a little short of length and Bairstow wanted to smash it through midwicket, went for the pull but he was too early into the shot and the ball sneaks under his bat to knock back off-stump. The opening stand has been broken"
"fuller on the stumps, clipped to mid-on"
"some turn there, pitches on off and goes further away"
"he was moving very far across, because Narine is bowling it wide, gets an edge that bounces to short third man and they run a quick single"

<b>into the stands</b> Vijay Shankar's confidence is showing. goes down on one knee and slog sweeps him over the midwicket fence
"shorter, he goes on the back foot and nudges it gently to fine leg. Played softly enough to allow them to come back for a quick second"
"fuller on off, pushed into the offside"

"full outside off, slows it up, Vijay waits for it and glides it to third man"
"<b>swing and a miss</b> He was clearing his leg and looking to send this high over deep midwicket, but he bowls a slower offcutter and Warner misses it entirely. Bounces over the stumps"
"fuller on the stumps, steered to point's right, where he tumbles to save"
"full on the stumps, pushed to wide long-on"
"Warner made as if to back away but stayed put, Prasidh bowled it down leg. Tried to tickle it fine but too square and only a single to short fine leg"
"yorker on leg stump, patted down to long-off"
"another slower ball, back of a length outside off, he waits for it and glides it to third man"
"<b>that is some power by Warner</b> it was a slower ball, so he had to manufacture the pace himself. Backed away and just clubbed this back of length ball back over Russell's head and into the sightscreen. hit with a horizontal bat"
driven to cover
"yorker on the stumps, pushed to extra cover for a quick single"
"<b>brilliant catch by Uthappa at cover</b> this was too full, and Warner drove it powerfully from his crease. That looked headed for the fence but Uthappa tumbled to his left to pluck the ball just inches from the ground. End of a fabulous innings, who would have ever thought he's been away?"
"slower ball, yorker length on the fifth stump line, he gets down on one knee to unleash a beautiful looking cover drive. But there is a sweeper cover back, so only a single"
"great ball, went slightly wider of the crease and a yorker on middle stump. Yusuf can only dig it back out to the bowler"
"goes for the pull and misses it completely, slower bouncer. But DK doesn't gather cleanly so they get a bye"
"goes for the big cover drive but he gets a thick outside edge that travels quickly to third man. Narine is quickly onto it, so only one run"

"gets some shape on it and bowls it at almost yorker length outside off, but he guides it superbly by opening the face of the bat to third man's right"
"back of a length, slowed it up a bit, Vijay clubs it off the back foot but straight to long-on. He's admonishing himself, wanted to place it better"
"<b>castled</b> Yusuf had been softened up by Lockie, and Dre Russ builds on that by bowling a beautifully disguised slower ball. Rolled his fingers along the ball and got it yorker length. Yusuf wanted to flick it away, was too early into the shot and the ball homed in on the base of the stumps"
"<b>upper cut first ball</b> bouncer outside off and he guides it over the keeper, one bounce to third man"
"fullish on off, driven - but straight to cover"
"<b>pierces the gap</b> another slower one, he cleared his front leg and slapped this, perfectly placed between cover and mid-off, all the way to the boundary"
"tailed into him on the pads, low full toss, he misses with the flick. They take the leg-bye with the ball rolling back to the bowler's left"
"fullish on the fifth stump line, driven to long-off. Came off the toe-end of the bat"
"<b>picked up the slower one</b> he dismisses it, having read it perfectly. Cleared his leg, saw it was a slower one,  and heaved it over midwicket, putting a lot of body into the shot"
"good comeback, wide yorker outside off at normal pace. He doesn't connect"
"<b>lbw appeal given and the batsman has reviewed it</b> That tailed into the batsman late, he wanted to flick it away but the movement defeats his bat and hits the outside half of his front pad. Was that going down leg? That's the only question. Hit on the full, so that will be advantageous to the bowler. Even if it clips, he'll be out. No bat on it, but it's missing leg stump! So Vijay stays on. Good review"
<b>cleverly placed</b> fine leg was in the circle and this one was tailing in too. He manages to get enough on it to place it beyond the fielder in the circle and to the fine leg boundary.
"good length outside off, slower than normal pace, stroked through cover"
"yorker on the fourth stump line, dug out off the toe-end to long-on"
"yorker on the fourth stump again, he was expecting it, so moved a little back and clubbed it forcefully, but straight to long-on"
gets hold of the short ball and pulls it to the midwicket boundary. Moved on the back foot and got enough on it to beat the man at short midwicket
"good fielding by Prasidh at the long-on boundary. Quick yorker, but dealt with very well, clearing his front leg and almost helicoptering it straight down the ground. Prasidh slides and saves"
"full toss outside off, carved away to deep cover. They push hard for the second, and he's just made it. That's some excellent running to steal that second run, even though the throw came in quickly"

"looked to wallop across the line on the pull but this one skids through to keep low, lobs off the toe-end of Lynn's bat and the cover fielder takes an absolute dolly. Superb bowling, this was the arm-ball from Shakib at 95kph. Rashid can't ask for an easier catch"
"smeared into the gap at cover point. Stood tall and punched it away on the up, super timing. <strong>Has Rashid done some damage</strong> in trying to stop that? <strong>Burst through his fingers.</strong>"

"nice and full on off, pushed into the covers"

"slower ball, on the pads, he waits for it and nudges it to square leg"
"another slower ball, but he got enough meat on it to send it to the long-off fence. He clubbed it down the ground, and beat a diving mid-off. Once past that, it was always going for four"

full outside off and driven fluently by opening the face of the bat to deep point. <b>Sixth IPL fifty</b> for Nitish Rana
"goes down for a slog sweep to one pitched on middle and spinning into him and misses. Rashid goes up for an appeal, but that is surely missing leg. He had given himself room and wanted to slog-sweep from leg stump. Oh wait, they have gone for a review. This is a bad move, I suspect. And it pitched outside leg too. KKR had a terrible review when they bowled, now SRH have returned the favour."
"<b>shot</b> given room outside off, this is flatter but on the sixth stump line and he transfers eight back and cuts it powerfully past point"
goes on the back foot to turn this leg-break backwards of square

"misses the sweep again, struck on the pad"
"tossed up outside off this time, too full though and allows him to sweep it from outside off to deep square leg"

"<b>strikes first ball after the break</b> lights out at Eden, now lights out for KKR? This was the leg-break, pitched on middle and spun in just enough to beat his attempted drive back with a straight bat, strikes him on the pad. Loud appeal and the finger goes up. Rana doesn't review, walks off"

"smart bowling, keeps it very wide outside off and just inside the tramline, has Russell reaching for it and he can only chop it away into the offside for a single"
"another pinpoint yorker, and Gill clips it off his toes to short fine leg. Brilliant bowling"
"<b>fantastic bowling</b> yet another yorker, and all Russell can do is jab his bat down to dig it out. Jammed into the ground hard enough that it bounces over Bhuvneshwar and they get a single"
"<b>boom</b> too full, half-volley on leg stump and Russell clears his leg and swings through the line to send it soaring over deep midwicket"
"<b>take that</b> He's coming to the party late, but how. Low full toss now and he muscles it over the bowler's head. Bottom of the bat, but such is his power that he sends it over the rope"
"that was hit incredibly hard but straight to the man at deep midwicket. Length ball outside off and he swiped it with power, but went flat and one bounce to the fielder"
"full ball outside off, he swings too, but gets a thick inside edge to deep midwicket"
"<b>clubbed</b> stand and delivery by Dre Russ. Back of a length and wide outside off, he threw his hands at it and sent it powering through extra cover"
"full toss outside off and Russell wanted to belt the cover off the ball, but he mistimes it, and sends it to Warner at long-off, who is quick to relay the ball back. But Russel's kept strike for the next over"
"<b>Russell's power is something</b> full ball on leg stump, and he gets his leg out of the way to power it through midwicket for a four"
<b>that's got some air miles on it!</b> Russell is turning the heat on. clears his front leg and lifts this full delivery from leg stump so high over midwicket it might need a visa. Way into the crowd
"<b>incredible</b> this was a yorker that was perhaps off by just millimetres, but Russell power-drives it by going deep in his crease from leg stump to long-off. Mid-off's despairing dive not enough"
"rare dot ball, goes wide outside off, and Russell was backing away again so doesn't connect with the swing"
"<b>oh my this should be illegal</b> that's a mis-hit. A total mis-hit. And it's gone over the extra cover boundary. How does he do it? Bhuvi kept it wide outside off, and Russell moved slightly across, was almost falling over but clubbed it off the toe-end of the bat. And still sent it over the fence"
"powerfully struck again, but there is a sweeper cover so only a single. Again, it means Russell is on strike"
Russell stays put and Shakib second guesses him by firing it down leg. That will be a wide
almighty heave but only gets an under-edge to deep square leg
"<b>Shubman's around too, he reminds us</b> down the track, reaches the pitch of the ball and lofts it well over long-on. Beautiful use of the feet, beautiful, clean strike"
"flatter outside off, tapped back to the bowler"
"<b>Shubman wins it with a six</b> What a remarkable chase by KKR. Incredible scenes at Eden. Down the track again, takes it on the full and send sit into the sightscreen. Eden goes ballistic"
