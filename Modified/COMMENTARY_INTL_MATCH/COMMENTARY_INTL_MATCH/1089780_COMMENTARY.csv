"yorker - or a near yorker - on off stump, he jams his bat down and keeps it out. Right on the money is Gabriel"
"good length, angled in on off stump, Noor Ali is half-forward as he defends into the covers"
"good length, again, but this holds its line outside off, carefully angled down to deep third man for one. Noor Ali and Afghanistan off the mark"
"Gabriel shortens his length. This one starts outside off and <strong>seams back in sharply</strong>, Ahmadi is surprised. The ball zips past the inside edge. Hope flies to his left to stop the ball"
"jumps from a back of a length outside off, the batsman rises with it and fends it wide of backward point"
"overpitched and outside off, Noor Ali simply leans into it and caresses a drive through the covers. The outfield is slow but the ball outruns the chasing fielder. The boundary spoils what could have been an excellent over"
"back of a length, Holder uses his height and generates extra bounce outside off, no shot"
"starts outside off and swerves away further, off-side wide"
"back of a length and angled in, clipped straight to midwicket. Noor Ali sets off for a single, there is a silly, old mix-up. Lewis swoops down on the ball, but can't nail the stumps down. A <strong>direct hit could have sent the non-striker packing</strong>"
"fuller than a good length, beats the flick, deflects off the pad and rolls away to square leg. Lewis moves to his right and swoops down on the ball again. Excellent dive and pick-up, and this time he<strong> throws the stumps down at the striker's end now</strong> - all in one motion. Spectacular effort from Lewis. Ahmadi dishes out a full-length dive, and that just saves him. The TV umpire looks at various angles and rightly gives it not out"
"re-set the radar, another off-side wide"
"just short of a good length, denies him swinging room, chopped out to point"
jumps onto a top short ball outside off and flays it straight to backward point
"pitched up and outside off, firmly driven off the front foot, extra cover flings himself to intercept the ball"
"full and outside off, defended onto the pitch"
"short and wide outside off, Ahmadi stands on leg stump and reaches out for the ball with hard hands. The ball whistles past his reckless slash"
"banged in short and outside off, blocked to cover, with the head right over the ball. Much better"
and again! Back to slashing is Ahmadi. Gabriel teases him with a back of a length ball outside off - not really short for the cut. Beats the swinging bat again
"Ahmadi just can't resist. Pitched up and wide outside off, draws a loose away-from-the-body drive, <strong>edged</strong> between slip and gully. That would have carried to second slip - if he was there"
"length ball outside off, no shot now"
"good length and very close to a wide outside off, Holder gets away with it, left alone"
"good length and outside off, leaps off the surface, Ahmadi loves bat on ball, beaten again. Loose"
"back of a length and wide outside off, ignored"
"wide of the crease, but this length ball holds its line outside off, left alone again"
"wide of the crease, again, this is angled into the thigh, diverted to square leg"
"Holder ventures wide of the crease, angles it down leg, leg-side wide now. Holder has bowled both sides of the wicket"
"too straight in line, helped wide of long leg, a weak throw ensures Afghanistan take two off the extra ball"
"fullish and outside off, run away to point"
"excellent ball from Gabriel. Back of a length outside off, extra bounce, splice-jarring length. Ahmadi does equally well to loosen his grip and fend it off to cover point"
"flashed in the air to the right of a diving extra cover. Floated full and outside off - half-volley - driven on the up, flies past Lewis. First real bad ball from Gabriel"
"another rising short ball outside off, hops, skips, and fends to point"
"Has he gloved it behind to the keeper? The umpire shakes his head.  Pops off the right forearm to the keeper. Hurled in short, angled in, the batsman was late to sway away and drop his bat. Good call from the umpire"
"short and slanted a long way down leg, left alone. Hope flies to his left and saves four for his side"
"full and outside off, drives early, drives on the up, but does not carry to short cover"
"Holder hangs it up very wide outside off, tempts the batsman into a drive, he resists. That was past the guideline. Umpire Shamsuddin does not deem it a wide. He was tempted, though"
"full on a sixth-stump line outside off, no shot"
"good length and outside off, left alone again"
"fuller than a good length and angled in the corridor, no shot again"
"wide of the crease, back of a length and angled in, no shot again. Five dots in a row"
ends an over of leaves. No bat on ball. West Indies playing with Afghanistan's patience or the lack of it
"short, angled in, chest-high ball, swivels on the back foot and hooks it to long leg. Chase chases to his left from square-ish long leg and swats the ball in before collecting it"
"just short of a good length and outside off, dabbed to the right of gully with soft hands"
left alone outside off
"short and angled in on off, slams the splice, and rolls down to gully. Gabriel running in hard, hitting the deck harder"
"tight line on off, pushed into the covers again"
"hurled short and outside off, rides the bounce and plays it to backward point"
"The pressure tells on Noor Ali. He had not put bat on ball against Holder in the last over. He could have evaded this. Instead, he lobs a return catch. This was a top ball, though. Banged in short and aimed at the head, the batsman looks away, taking his eyes off the ball. He has a half-fend, half-hook, or something in between, and chips it back to Holder"
"banged in short and angled in, draws another leading edge, this does not carry to backward point"
"short and really wide outside off, past the guideline, another off-side wide"
"back of a length on a fifth-stump line outside off, no shot"
"back of a length and angled in on off, hops and fends it to mid-on"
"length and in the corridor, left alone again"
"Is this a repeat of Miller-Du Plessis? Looks just as ugly! Both batsmen are at the striker's end. Lewis hunts the ball down and throws it to Holder, the bowler, who tips the bails off at his end. This was on a back of a length and angled in, tucking up Rahmat for room. He taps it to the left of short midwicket. There is an awful mix-up between the wickets, and Ahmadi is the one who is short at the striker's end. What an over for WI! Two wickets"
"short and outside off, aims a forcing cut and chops it behind to slip"
"short and angled in on the leg stump, cramps the batsman up for room, half-fended and half-hooked to long leg"
"rapid bouncer on leg stump, ducks under it"
"splice-jarring short ball, kicks up on off, Gabriel keeps hitting the deck hard. Fended onto the pitch"
"Bounced out! Gabriel bangs in another short ball on the stumps, head-hunting lifter, harries him for pace. His response is a weak, top-edged pull. Square leg comes in and settles under the skier"
"hurled in short again, attempts the hook, miscued in front of square leg now"
"wide of the crease, angled in, picked off the hips to long leg, just a single"
"overpitched and outside off, he capitalises on it, and simply drills it through the line, mid-off (Chase) dives to his right, replays suggest he just dived over the ball. A rare boundary"
back of a length and angled in grazes the thigh and rolls away to square leg
"short and angled into the hips, cramps him for room, the ball lobs in front of square leg"
"short and angled in on off, he puts his bat up like shield and saves himself from being hit"
"glances the helmet and balloons over the keeper? Given as runs. Might have been a top edge. Dug in short and quick on off, no room to play the hook and he is also late onto the shot. He gets away with it, though"
"big appeal for lbw! Given out. But reckon the angle would have taken it down the leg side. Shenwari has to depart, though. Full and angled in sharply from over the wicket, Shenwari is pinned to the crease, he plays all around his front pad. But this would have missed leg. No DRS in this series"
"short and angled in, gets inside the line and helps it wide of long leg for a couple"
"ginger run-up, short and angled in on off, still hits the bat hard. Fended back to the bowler"
"dragged short on off, hurries the batsman for pace, and raps the glove as the ball drops to the leg side. Big front-foot no-ball"
"bouncer outside off, flies off the deck, flies over the hook. Another front-foot no-ball"
"floated full and outside off, opens the face and bunts the ball to point"
"short and attached with loads of width outside off, carved away to the right of deep third man"
"lifter outside off, rocks his head out of the way"
"short and angled in on the stumps, fended to leg"
"wide of the crease, holds its line outside off, sneaks under the big cut. That did not get up at all"
"back of a length and outside off, sits back and pushes the ball to the cover-point region"
"short of a length and angled in on off from wide of the crease, barely rises up to the chest, clipped away to square leg"
"leg-side short ball, he aims a flick, gloves it fine past the keeper"
"back of a length, angling into middle and leg, tucked away to long leg"
"bouncer, angling in and gets up to a testing neck height, but just outside off stump and Nabi can sway away fairly comfortably"
once again digs it in short. This time Nabi shuffles across and works it off his ribcage into the leg side
"back of a length, angling into off stump, defended to midwicket"
"shortish, doesn't really get up high enough for the pull. It's about stump-high, on off stump, and Stanikzai drags it towards square leg, all along the ground"
"shortish, rising over off stump, gets on his toes and defends into the point region"
"flat on off stump, not much turn, goes back to punch to long-on"
"a bit of flight now, outside off, gets a big stretch out to defend back to the bowler"
"goes back to a length ball on off stump, works it into the square leg region"
"shortish, spins in towards off stump, punched back to the bowler"
"slower now, full on middle stump, clipped through square leg"
"shortish, a touch of width, and that's well fielded by backward point diving to his right. Made room and cut that quite firmly"
"goes back and across to a length ball on a fourth-stump line, defends into the covers"
"shortish, close to off stump. Big step back and across from Nabi. Looks to play into the on side with the angle, closes his bat face, the ball pops off the leading edge towards point"
"short again, this one's wider outside off, opens his bat face and slices it uppishly over Nurse at short third man"
"that's a proper, nasty bouncer, and Stanikzai can't do much about it at all. I'm not sure too many batsmen in international cricket could, to be fair. Fast, rising to head height, and angling in towards the badge of the helmet. The pace, especially the pace off the pitch, left Stanikzai with no time to move across, sway, or duck. He just stood there, flung his hands up to protect his head, and popped it high and loopy to the keeper off the gloves"
"full outside off, driven to backward point"
"the short ball again, goes wider of the crease and slants it in. Ducks hurriedly and it passes over Zazai's back"
"back of a length on off stump, punched into the covers"
similar length and line - in terms of where it pitched - but this didn't turn. Looks to cut and misses
"straighter and quicker, blocked back to the bowler"
"back of a length on off stump, punched into the covers"
"tossed up fuller and wider, stretches out to defend into the off side"
"ooh, sharp chance. Not really a drop, because Holder didn't get a hand to it. He was at slip, and he took a step to his right when he saw Nabi shaping to punch this back-of-a-length ball outside off. The ball went very quickly to his left off a thick outside edge - no turn again - and he stuck his hand out but too late"
"bouncer close to off stump, Nabi sways his upper body away from the line"
"back of a length, close on off stump, defended into the point region"
"another testing short ball, another wicket. This one angles in and gets up towards Nabi's left ribcage. He just fends awkwardly at it and fends a loopy, simple catch to midwicket running to his left"
"oh man. Naib was expecting the short ball even before Joseph delivered. Backed away from leg stump and ducked, and this ended up as a length ball that just about bounced over off stump, maybe a few inches wide of it"
"this one is short, but outside off, left alone fairly comfortably"
"this really isn't the greatest of starts from Gulbadin. Length ball, fourth-stump channel, and he clears his front leg and slogs and fails to connect"
"slower yorker, right at the batsman's feet. Nice change-up given how nervous Gulbadin's looking. He keeps his eye on this one, though, gets his front leg out of the way and defends"
"dangerous, from Zazai. Gets forward and across to a ball pitching on middle and off, and nearly gets his pad in the way of his flick towards short fine leg"
"nicely bowled. He's been getting a bit of drift away from the right-handers, and he floats this up slow and wide of off. Pokes at it, plays the initial line, and gets a thick outside edge that rolls away past slip"
"back of a length, straighter, goes back to punch to midwicket"
"quickish length ball on off and middle, stays back to defend to midwicket"
"back of a length, wider outside off, this is the one that goes with the arm. Watches it well and defends towards point"
"quickish length ball on middle stump, defends towards midwicket"
"ooh, good ball. Lovely length outside off, invites the drive without quite pitching full enough for it, and the ball zips past the outside edge"
"shortish, rising to hip height over off stump. Gets a little opened up but defends reasonably comfortably down into the pitch"
"another sharply rising ball, over off stump. Goes back and across to defend, hits high on the bat and pops in the air but well short of the fielder at cover"
"bouncer, angling a touch down leg. Steps across and lifts his bat over his head to make sure he doesn't get a touch on it"
"shortish in the corridor, goes back and across and plays that well, nice and late, with soft hands into the point region"
"ooh, good ball. Again Zazai plants that front foot across. This one's a length ball angling in towards off stump. Defended into the on side"
"back of a length on off stump, gets nicely behind it to defend back to the bowler"
"back of a length, turning in towards leg stump, worked to midwicket"
"full, close to off stump, presses forward to block back to the bowler"
"slower, wider, gets a good stride out, waits, and defends into the cover point region"
"floats this up a lot wider outside off, driven to sweeper cover"
"full outside off, defended into the covers"
"short, fairly wide. Goes on with the arm, though, and beats the cut. He'd made himself room, and the lack of turn meant he ended up too far from the ball to connect"
"short ball, as expected, outside off. Made room and shaped to uppercut, but decided in the end to leave it instead"
"bam. This time, instead of backing away from leg stump, he takes a premeditated step back and across towards off stump. Gets a full ball just outside off stump, and slogs it away crisply over mid-on"
"bouncer now, as expected. Gets his front leg well away from leg stump and leaves it"
"back of a length, angling into middle stump from wide of the crease. Stays leg-side of the ball and blocks into the covers"
"slower length ball outside off, lets it come on and punches to mid-off"
"short ball outside off, pulls and doesn't quite middle it. Hits the outside half of the bat and floats up into the big gap at deep midwicket"
"full outside off, defended into the short extra-cover region, the bowler does the fielding"
"a bit more flight outside off, driven to long-off"
"nice flight and a bit of drift just outside off, good stride forward to defend"
"slower now, gets a stride forward and then realises this is dipping shorter than expected. Waits and defends with soft hands"
"shortish outside off, not enough width to cut and it stops on him too. Drags it back to the bowler instead"
"goes back to a length ball outside off, ends up beaten by lack of turn while trying to defend"
"shortish, rising over off stump, lets it come on and defends into the point region"
"back of a length, angling down leg, Zazai misses the glance"
"back of a length, angling in towards off stump, defended towards point"
"back of a length, angling towards leg stump. Misses the flick and deflects off the edge of his thigh pad. Hope dives left to prevent leg byes"

"full on middle stump, clipped through square leg"
"fullish outside off, stretches out to block into the covers"

"back of a length outside off, tiny bit of nibble away. Goes  back to defend, rolls off the outside half of the bat to the left of backward point"
"shuffles out of his crease this time, premeditatedly. Ends up slogging too early across the line and missing a length ball outside off"
"back of a length outside off, nips in a touch, defended off the back foot"
"full on leg stump, flicked to the left of Joseph at long leg. Moves quickly to keep it down to one"

"length ball close to off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"flat, angling into middle and leg, clipped to backward square leg"
"got him, that's a lovely bit of bowling. Saw Zazai stepping out and bowled it wider outside off, made him stretch out to defend. A bit of drift away and no turn back in, and the thick outside edge goes to slip at waist height"
"flat, back of a length, just outside off, goes on the back foot, looks to whip into the leg side but the lack of turn forces him to play it more defensively and straighter than he'd like"

"floated up wide of off, stretches out and defends into the cover point region"
"bouncer, angled down leg, the batsman evades it. Wide call. The short-ball barrage continues"

"shoulder-high short ball just a shade outside off, Rashid is late onto the hook and watches the ball sail past him to Hope"
"off-stump yorker, which is dug out to gully"
"wide of the crease, tennis-ball bouncer outside off, Rashid looks to upper-cut it to third man. No dice"
"more short-ball barrage. Dug in short on middle, chest-high ball, cramps the batsman for room. He hooks and top-edges it in the air. Joseph at long leg looks to settle under this skier. The ball, however, sails over him. Joseph tried to toss it back into the field of play. No dice. He lost his balance and tumbled behind the boundary. He seems to be in pain. Looks like he has done damage to his ankle"
"short and angling away outside off, from around the wicket, Rashid has a big leg-side slog at the ball and only edges it behind to the keeper. The finger goes up. Afghanistan eight down and sinking"
"tossed outside off, no turn, Naib sizes it up. It was right in the slot. Launched over the bowler's head"
"fuller and slower, blocked to the off side"
"dropped short and outside off, slapped away to sweeper"
"drops short of long-off running in. Tossed up outside off, skies a loft, it does not carry to Bishoo, who is subbing for Joseph. Good effort"
tucked around the corner for one
"short and wide outside off, goes deep in the crease and flat-bats it away to the right of sweeper"
"slower, full ball on off, Naib picks it and dares to take on the long-on fielder. Clears him. Clears his front leg and muscles it over the boundary"

"bouncer outside off, tennis-ball bouncer, Naib drops his hands on it"
"slower full ball on off, quietly blocked to the leg side"
"rides the bounce of this short, wide ball and upper-cuts it past backward point, third man runs to his right and tidies up. Picks up a couple"
'howzaaat' is the shout from Holder. This was pretty full and angled down leg from over the wicket. No bat involved. Brushed the pad en route to Hope
"non-turner, back of a length and outside off, punched to cover on the back foot"

"length ball on middle, clears his front leg and hoicks it away to long-on"
"Zadran shuffles across off and puts the bowler off. Angled down leg, wide"
"near yorker - very full on off and middle - tucked away through backward square leg. Zadran sets off, Naib agrees to the single"
"length ball, slider on off, played back"
"Holes out to Lewis at deep midwicket. Lewis falls awkwardly on his right shoulder but clings on. Pushed through flatter and faster on middle, Zadran wants to slug it over midwicket. Dares to clear the long boundary. But Lewis runs across, dives, and completes an excellent catch"

"short and angled in on middle, swivels and pulls to deep backward square"
"bouncer outside off, hooks and misses"

"Naib pre-meditates, steps away outside leg, the bowler follows him with a flat, full ball, and cramps him for room. Naib looks to go big. But gets more height as opposed to distance. Finds long-off"

"back of a length and angling across off, defended to cover"

"short and loads of width outside off, Lewis latches onto it. Scythes a cut over backward point. Flies to the boundary. Raw power"

"fuller than a good length, swerving away, much closer to off, Lewis is stuck to the crease as he jabs and misses outside off"

"googly pitching outside leg, looks to sweep and misses, hit on the pad"
"back of a length on middle stump, worked to deep square leg"
"and he's struck in his first over! Excellent googly, quick and fairly full, pitching on middle and off. Powell was a little late coming forward, and as a result had to push away from his body to meet the ball. Thick edge, deflected off the keeper's left pad to the fielder at slip"
"another googly, huge turn from outside off. Presses forward to defend without getting anywhere near the pitch of the ball, and he's beaten on the inside edge. Huge appeal for lbw, turned down. I think that spun too much, and would probably have missed leg stump"
"full on off stump, driven into the covers"
"tossed up, a bit of width, nice square-drive there, got his head right over the ball, but Rashid springs to his right from backward point to deny him any runs"
"ooh, nervy shot. Floated this up outside off and he clears his front leg to try and slog this away. No turn, and the slowness really made him reach for it. Beaten comfortably, and he nearly lifts his back foot as well"

"goes back to a length ball close to off stump, defends into the covers"
"back of a length outside off, punched to short extra-cover"
"back of a length, sharp googly, short enough for Hope to stay back, watch, and punch it back to the bowler"
