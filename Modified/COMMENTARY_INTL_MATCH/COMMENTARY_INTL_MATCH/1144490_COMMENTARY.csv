"fuller, down the leg side, and he shapes to flick but cannot get any bat to it. Bowled at <strong>137kph</strong>"

"length, outside off, and he leaves"
"length, outside off, and he plays it defensively"
"sharp, length ball, angles across him, and takes the inner edge of de Kock's bat and nestles within his body. Bowled at <strong>137kph</strong>"
"shorter in length, and rises further as it angles across de Kock. Started off from outside off, so he let it go. Dhoni collects this in front of first slip"
"length, angles across him, and beats the outside edge. De Kock was looking to defend this, but it just rose and moved away with the natural angle"
"first loose ball, full and on the pads and he gets this away towards fine leg. Hurries Jadhav up and takes two, but <em>had to put in the dive</em>"
"length, angles away from him, and also a hint of swing, as it cuts him in half. <strong>De Kock looking to defend, and beaten all ends up!</strong>"
action replay of the previous ball. Starts from around leg and middle and then shapes away from him and leaves him with a sheepish smile as it beats his outside edge
"length, and width, and he eases into a square drive. Gets it past point and all the way for the first boundary of the day"
"length, jags back into him and he has to defend watchfully. The ball trickles away towards point"
"length, width again, and he cuts this away towards third man. Kuldep Yadav stationed there"

"length, outside off, and a bit of shape away from him as he shoulders arms"

"<strong>GOT 'IM!</strong> Good length, just outside off, and makes Amla defend from the crease. The extra bounce takes the outside edge, and Rohit Sharma pouches this at second slip, moving slightly across to his right. <strong>Just reward for what has been a terrific opening burst by Bumrah</strong>"
"fuller ball, outside off, and he chops this one down to fine leg! Hands on head from Bumrah, because <i>that didn't miss the leg stump by much</i>"
"length, moves back into him at <strong>141kph</strong>, and he defends. Again off the inside of the bat into his pads"

"shorter in length, straight ball, and he cuts this one on bended knee, down towards third man"
"fuller ball, straight at the off stump, and he defends this from the crease. The ball skittles away towards extra cover and there's enough time to go through for a quick single"
"<strong>Bumrah has TWO!</strong> He's bowled better balls than this one, to be honest. Throws it a bit wide, but still fuller than most, and de Kock has a swish at it, and the outside edge carries it through to Kohli at third slip. That's one major blow for South African hopes"
"fuller ball, outside off, and he does well to press forward and ease this away towards extra cover. Will get off the mark with two"

"length, moves into du Plessis, who defends close to his body from the crease"
"length, outside off, and he lets this one pass"
"outside off, a bit fuller, and he defends again. Du Plessis looks like he wants to set in for the long haul here"
"length, outside off, cuting back in, and he plays another exaggerated forward defence from the crease"
"fuller, straighter, and he clicks into gear to flick this through midwicket for four. Terrific bit of timing, and helped that he transferred his weight perfectly as the ball shaped into him"
"length, outside off, and he goes back and punches this one towards extra cover. Some good scurrying from the point fielder keeps it down to just one"
"length, and he punches this towards the bowler"
"length, and <strong>some bounce </strong>as it moves into him. Faf is up on his toes to defend, and takes his bottom hand off as he lets it hit his bat. Another great variation"

"length, outside off, and he defends this towards point. Just no escape"
"length, outside off, and he defends this from the crease. Good pace again, as it was honing in towards his off stump"

"spins in from outside off, and du Plessis goes back and whips it away towards deep backward square"

"fuller, turns into him, and he tucks this away towards deep backward square leg"
"short this time, and goes on with the arm, and van der Dussen has read this well. Cracks this between extra cover and point and gets it through the infield. Four once it pierced that gap in the infield"

"short, angles into him, and he plays this with a flick of the wrists towards square leg"

"full ball, outside off, and he drags a sweep down towards deep midwicket"
"length, outside off, and he gets this to turn just enough to beat du Plessis' outside edge as he shapes to defend"
"thrown fuller, and he drives hard. Half-stopped by Dhawan at extra cover, but the knock-on towards long off allows them to return for the second"
"gets the sweep out again, to a length ball, and Bhuvi makes a meal of a regulation stop from deep midwicket. Should have been two, but he lets it go through for four instead"

"Rassie hops and angles it down square of third man, Kuldeep hauls it in but not before they're back for a second"

"dug in short by Pandya, Rassie ducking underneath it in good time"
"another short one, and for a moment it seemed Rassie wanted to duck this one as well. But instead, he rolls his wrists over a pull and collects a couple out to deep square"

"<b>beaten</b> on the outside edge, the ball gripping and spinning past Rassie's defensive poke"
"quicker, flatter, and rushing on straight. Rassie is deep in the crease to defend"
"nice loop and flight, and it's dug out to cover"
"Rassie spots some width, but possibly over-hits it, bottom edging his cut hard into the turf"
"flight and drift from a full delivery, Rassie digging it out off his toes and towards long on for a single"
"aimed at the stumps, Rassie coming forward to push to cover"
"on a length and in the channel once more, but van der Dussen's feet get him in the perfect position from which to defend"
"nudged off the hip and into space on the leg side, quick single"
"Faf waits in the crease for the ball to reach him, defending right under the eyes into the off side"
"thumped very hard into the covers, where KL gets a hand to it to take the sting out of the shot, but can't stop the single"
"Rassie is half forward to glide a single down to third man, keeping the strike"
"<b>GOT HIM!</b> That is not pretty. Not pretty at all. Legspinners can do this to batsmen: make them look foolish. And that's what happens when Rassie telegraphs his intentions to reverse sweep, getting into position very early. But the drift takes the ball towards leg stump, and the rip sends it clattering into the timber. He's already planted his front foot, and can't reach around at the ball. Bowled around his legs!"
"flatter from Chahal, and Miller slugs it back to the bowler"
"spin takes this one down the leg side, called wide"
"Miller skips out, getting to the pitch, but finds short midwicket"
"and now he is off the mark, playing with the spin to square leg"
"this one rushed on straight at him, out of the front of the hand perhaps. But Faf's bat comes down in time"
"<b>not this time!</b> Faf gropes forward, but he's not read it and the ball sneaks straight through the gap between bat and pad. Chahal has his second in the over, and the South African captain falls!"
"chipped uppishly, but safely through mid off and down to long off for one"
"Duminy's off the mark straight away, bending low to sweep hard out to deep square"
"a touch too short, giving Miller the time to rock back and chop a cut out to the sweeper"

"googly, but Miller reads it off the pitch and forces down to long on"

"floated up high, Duminy coming forward to push back to the bowler"

"full, and again Duminy pushes it back to him"
"excellent bowling, Kuldeep stringing the dots together as another one is pushed back to him"
"<b>the pressure tells!</b> This one was slightly quicker through the air, skidding through to hit Duminy - playing right back - on the pads. It looks adjacent, it's given out, but <b>Duminy reviews it</b>. Needlessly so, it turns out, as three reds come back and he's got to go. It was a little desperate, but given the game situation, Duminy had to ask for another look. South Africa sink ever further"
"flicked off the toes, and they rush back for the second. Good running"
"and he skips out this time, getting to the pitch and cracking a drive to long on"
"zipped through on an off stump line, Andile stretching well forward to keep it out"
<b>powerful reverse sweep!</b> Phehlukwayo isn't going to go quietly in this game. He gets himself into an excellent position and absolutely hammers this reverse
"<b>chipped back over the bowler!</b> Was this intentional? Didn't look like it. He tried to drive down the ground, and is fortunate that Chahal can't reach it"
"tapped down to long off, just the single"
"Miller waits on one that doesn't spin, whipping across his front pad to collect a single through square leg"
"flight and drift from Kuldeep, but Phehlukwayo is equal to it, getting forward to defend"
"Kuldeep is even more generous with the flight on this one, but Phehlukwayo waits on the shot appropriately, threading a drive through cover for one"
"nice crack off the bat as Miller gets nice and low to sweep, but there's protection in the deep so it's just the one"
"eased down to long off, one more"

"length, angles across him, and he defends from the crease"
"full ball, and he digs it out and plays it towards short cover"
"length, angles across him. He plays it towards short cover and sets off. Miller has to put in the dive at the striker's end as Kohli has a shy at the stumps...and misses"
"full ball, but on the pads, and he plays an exquisite flick towards deep midwicket. Gets it wide of the man inside the circle, and then it just keeps running away further from him. <strong>Top shot!</strong>"
"length ball, angles across him and he defends"
"short, and he goes back and cuts this towards backward point"
"floated up outside off, and he drives it back to Jadhav"

"<strong>takes a dolly!</strong> Chahal continues to impress with every over. Was there ever a doubt over his place in the XI? He's quelling them now. Nicely tossed up, this drifted away and spin back in, Miller doesn't quite get to the pitch but looks to work it back, gets it high on the bat and Chahal takes an easy return catch."

"works this down to long-off, not entirely off the middle"

"looks to swing blindly, off a thick inside edge to midwicket"

Steps out to hoick with the spin but didn't get to the pitch, the ball breaks back in to beat the swing, the inside edge as MS Dhoni effects a stumping after a brief stumble. He was blinded by the swing initially and that may have thrown him off gear. The ball bobbled but he had so much time to regain his composure because Andile was so far down the pitch."

hops back into the crease as he defends this short of length delivery
"<strong>this is a corker of a delivery</strong> that Rohit had no clue about! Pokes forward, this one angles in and straightens. Plenty of ooohs and aaahs."
"<strong>lobs over point's head! </strong> Oh, dear. Lifter that raps Rohit on the shoulder of the bat as it lobs. <strong>Was Duminy too far inside?</strong>"
"takes him on with the short ball, not timed all that well but it still trickles into the square leg boundary. Dhawan got it higher than he would've liked, but this just breaks the shackles a little. Dhawan was ready for the pull"
"squared up by the length, but he gets on top of the bounce to defend that."
"short of length ball at 139kph outside off, Rohit lets it go"
the incoming delivery thuds the top of Rohit's bat as he hops back to defend. Superb bowling this

"mistimes this slap wide of cover, scampers across for a single. Rohit can heave a sigh of relief"

onto the backfoot as he defends this pacy short of length delivery into the off side
punches this back to mid-off
"if ever someone deserved a wicket, it's Kagiso! What a ball. Dhawan feels for the ball from the crease, is opened up the deviation off the pitch as he feathers an edge to de Kock. Big wicket for South Africa. Rabada is pumped, absolutely pumped. Dhawan never looked in and he's been put out of his misery. Huge wicket and an early boost for South Africa."
"welcomes him with a ripper of a bouncer, at 146kph. Kohli takes his eyes away as he ducks under the bouncer. The three slips right behind him chirp. This is a contest. Don't go too far away, folks."

right behind the line of this incoming length ball as he defends
"has he gloved this? Nah, doesn't matter. De Kock doesn't grab it but does outstandingly well to fling himself to his left to stop this. Got his direction wrong this time, did Rabada"
"width and he brings out a ferocious cut! Got on top of the bounce, both feet in the air as he made contact. Would be an understatement to say he picked the bones out of it. Cracking from Rohit"

punches this flatter one down to long-on
"short, wide and he's spanked this to sweeper cover"
"huge appeal, a massive plea. Was this missing? Faf and his team converge. <strong>They review.</strong> My impression: going down leg. This one skidded on much faster than Rohit anticipated, was looking to work this to across the line, hit on the flap of the pad. No bat, height and line in question possibly. Ball tracking comes on and it says this <strong>would've clipped outside of leg.</strong> So the onfield decision stays. NOT OUT."
cut away but straight to point again

"no timing again as he looks to work this full delivery past midwicket, rolls to mid-on instead"
"pulled imperiously! Fetched this from outside, felt this right off the middle. Not enough pace to dig it in, Kohli was ready when it arrived"
"this has to be the catch of the day, of the week, and maybe the tournament when we look back four weeks later! <b> Sensational, absolutely sensational from de Kock. </b> Kohli has a waft at this away from the body as Andile gets this to straighten a hint, there's extra bounce on this and so he gets a thick edge as he tries to run it down. The ball was on the rise but de Kock dived full length to his right to pluck this magical catch one-handed even as it kept going away from him."

"<strong>DROPS JUST SHORT OF SLIP!</strong> Great bowling by Morris, as he gets a length ball to just shape away a touch, and takes the outside edge of Rohit's bat, but it dips on its way to Amla, and he just fails to get to it in time. Sigh of relief for the batsman, and agony for the South Africans"
