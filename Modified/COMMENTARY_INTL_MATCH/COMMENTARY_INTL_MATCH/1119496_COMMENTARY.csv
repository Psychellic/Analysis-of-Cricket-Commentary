"wide of the crease but this full and largely holding its line outside off, 139ks, Rahane presses forward and drives it through backward point"
"<strong>zipping through outside off to Wade</strong>. He grabs it in front of his head. Short, Cummins hits the deck hard and the ball flies through to the keeper"
"much fuller, angled in, and shapes away around off, Rohit's back foot moves across leg stump as he opens the face and runs the ball towards point"
"back of a length and skids through the channel again, left alone. Wade takes it beside his head again"
and again! Cummins hits 140ks and hits the gloves of Wade. Shorter than the previous ball and seams away outside off. Rohit had let this pass too
"back of a length, angled in, but the line is too straight, allowing Rohit to tuck it away to the right of midwicket"
"back of a length and outside off, Rahane meets the ball with an open face, and glides it to point"
"Coulter-Nile ventures wide of the crease again. This ball, though, holds its line outside off. Rahane opens the face and runs it to the same fielder"
"pitched up outside off, <strong>swings away a bit under overcast skies</strong>, Rahane presses forward, shelves the drive, and lets it go"
"length-ball awayswinger, starts just outside off and veers away, left alone again"
"short and wide outside off, 138ks, Rahane goes after it, upper-cutting the ball. But there is protection in the deep at third man"
"Coulter-Nile cranks up to 141ks, finds that gentle outswing again, Rohit isn't tempted. Excellent start from the two Australia quicks"
"tight line on off, no lateral movement now, Rahane stretches out and smoothly pushes to cover"
"good length and angling in on off, Rahane presses forward and pats the ball down to mid-on"
"good length - and not a half-volley - outside off, Rahane presses forward, drives on the up, and finds the gap at the covers"
"short of a good length and skidding in towards middle and leg, <strong>144ks</strong>, Rahane leaps off his feet and fends the ball to leg"
The direction is wrong from Cummins. He spears a back-of-a-length delivery down the leg side. Left alone
Rahane loves the ball coming into the bat. He late-cuts it from outside off to the left of backward point
"short ball outside off, 140ks, think this one got stuck in the surface. Rohit shapes to pull but ends up  short-arm flapping in the gap between midwicket and mid-on. Rohit gets only two"
"pitched up and slanted in on off, nearly 140ks, played back to the bowler off the front foot"
"full and on off, Rahane twirls his wrists and works it to mid-on pressing forward. Cummins' front foot had strayed. No-ball"
"there's the bouncer, defeats Rahane's hook. Banged in outside off, beats Rahane for pace, and slams the gloves of Wade. One for the over, says umpire Erasmus"
"Australia find reward for their tight lines and lengths with the new ball. Coulter-Nile puts it on a length and wide outside off, swings away further - it ended on a set of stumps outside off. Rahane throws his bat at a drive and only snicks it behind. Wade, who has been busy this afternoon, moves to his right and snags the catch. Rahane falls for 5 off 15 balls on return"
"very, very full and wide outside off, just inside the tramline, asking Kohli to drive. The Indian captain says 'Nah, not now'"
"much fuller and closer to off stump. Dangled up in the channel, hint of away movement,<strong> Kohli reaches out for a biiiiig drive and watches the ball move past the outside edge</strong>"

"on a length and outside off, run away to backward point"
"much fuller and outside off, Rohit checks his drive and finds mid-off"
"<strong>Smith falls to his right from second slip to track down this edge but can't cling on</strong>. He slaps the ground in frustration. Back of a length and zips through outside off at 147.3ks, Rohit looks to open the face and run it past the cordon. He gets away"
"Kohli can't get away. Maxwell at backward point pulls off a belting one-handed catch over his head. Kohli has been dismissed for a four-ball duck. This was full and wide - wider than a set of stumps outside off again. Kohli had left his first ball. He chased the second one with a big drive. The big drive comes out again, he slices it into the air. Maxwell propels himself at backward point, sticks out his right hand, and grabs the ball, and lands. Great reflexes from Maxwell"
"dug in short on off, 140.8ks, Pandey fends it off"
"Is Pandey out nicking behind as well? Australia are sure they have their man and keep celebrating... but umpire Erasmus asks them to hold on. Was it a bump ball? He refers it to the TV umpire. Very, very full and swinging away so very late outside off, Pandey jams his bat down on the ground. The ball did not touch the ground, though; takes the outside edge and floats into the gloves of Wade. Clean catch. India left at 11 for 3 in 5.3. All three batsmen out flirting in the channel"
"on a length outside off, swings away so very late, left alone. Past the tramline. Wide"
"overpitched and outside off, just too full,and Jadhav leans into a square-drive, drilling it to the left of backward point. <b>First boundary for India</b>"
"back of a length and outside off, defended"
"back of a length, starts on a fourth-stump line, and darts away. Jadhav is caught between playing and leaving. He does a bit of this, a bit of that, and watches the ball dribble past the leg stump off a fortunate inside edge"
"just short of a good length on off, opens the face and steers it wide of backward point"
"pitched up and outside off, presses forward and pushes it to cover"
"full and angling in on off stump, Jadhav does not have a big front-foot stride, but drives it between midwicket and mid-on for his and India's second boundary"
"really full on a sixth/seventh-stump line outside off, swings away late, Jadhav thrusts his hands out and is beaten past the outside edge"
Australia's plan is to bowl full and wide outside off. Jadhav reaches out for the ball with his hands and flashes a drive to third man
"chest-high short ball on middle, <strong>150ks - pace like fire</strong>, rushes Rohit into a hook. He hits it in the air but the ball does not carry to Zampa at deep backward square leg"
"wide of the crease, holds its line outside off, Rohit plays with soft hands and dabs to backward point"
"very full and wide outside off, 139ks, Rohit throws his bat at a drive with his front foot nowhere close to the pitch of the ball. Toe-ended down to mid-off"

"short, rising outside off, Rohit secures a single to third man with an upper cut"
back of a length and angling into a front-foot defence on off

"on a length and outside off, driven on the up to mid-off"
"full and outside off, presses forward and pushes it to the covers"
"Jadhav races down the track, Faulkner drags his length back and cramps the batsman for room. He might have eked out an inside edge onto the pad. Faulkner's front foot is on the line - harsh call - no-ball"

"zippy short ball outside off, Jadhav pulls his bat inside the line, and lets it climb through to Wade"
"good length, slight tail down leg side. Thuds him on the pad as he looks to flick"
short and angled towards the corridor. Not so much room. But he goes for the cut. And he deposits it backward of point to beat third man's slide to the right
"back of a length outside off, poked to sweeper cover"
"good length, in at off stump. Reaches way in front to poke this back to the bowler"
"clean. Length at off stump again. He takes a small step down the track while getting the front leg out of the way to make room. Then he hits through the line, straight over the bowler"

"good length at off stump, defended to extra cover"
"<b>holes out to deep square leg.</b> An ordinary shot. Stoinis has been easily picked off with short bowling. But this one is 5 kph quicker than the last ball. Rohit goes for the hook, but the ball is way outside off. It's a regulation top edge and a regulation reverse-cup for Coulter-Nile. Umpires check for no-ball, but the crowd has already begun shouting <b>Dhoni! Dhoni!</b>"
<b>a misfield and he's way!</b> A slip was on place for Dhoni. This is back of a length and lifting away from outside off. He gets a thick outside edge and backward point lets it through
"full outside off, poked to sweeper off the front foot"
"back of a length outside off, a slider, chopped to backward point"
"back of a length at middle stump, pushed to midwicket"
do. not. bowl. short. to. him. A long-hop at middle stump. Kedar Jadhav is a murderer of spinners. Climbs into the like one. Slaps it flat towards the midwicket boundary. It lands just short of the rope

full one at off stump. Jadhav steps out and yorks himself. Manages to keep it out though
"full at off stump, driven down the long-off...to applause from the crowd"
oh close. Full at middle stump. Yorks himself and gets inside the line. Just manages to get bat on it and squeeze it to short fine. He was reaching out in the end as this drifted

"back of a length outside off, spinning away, left alone"

"short one outside off, sways away from it"
"good length outside off, looks to whip this past mid-on on the up. Mistimes it. Dribbles to mid-on"
nicely played. Doesn't lean in too much. This is still rising as he brings the bat down and taps it past extra cover on the front foot
"glorious shot, but extra cover gets a hand this time. Fuller and outside off. He leans into it this time and times it perfectly. The fieder sticks out his right arm as he dives and makes life easy for mid-off who might have had to run to fetch that"
"short and down leg side, doesn't go after it"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"back of a length, spins and bounces outside off. Watchfully dabs it to short third man"

"quicker one, pushed flat on a length at the pads. Hurriedly flicked to midwicket"
"<b>is that a drop?</b> Sounded like it. A full, dipping ball outside off. Jadhav goes for the slog sweep and heaves hard. Seems to be an under-edge as this zips into Wade's pads and deflects towards short fine"
"full outside off, swinging away. Dhoni leans in for the cover drive and he's beaten"
"<b>nearly run-out.</b> Dhoni is furious. He pokes this length ball to extra cover's left and takes off. Halfway down the track, he's told to go back by his partner who hasn't moved. He slips and nearly falls. Stranded, he watches as the fielder can't hit the stumps direct"
"<b>caught at midwicket.</b> Short one at off stump. Once again, a batsman looks to drag Stoinis' short one into the leg side. Once again, slow on it. This one is bunted off the high part of the bat. An easy catch"
"back of a length into the pads, dabbed to fine leg with soft hands...and they come back for the second."

"good length at off stump, looks to poke it through the covers. Can't get his wrists to move quickly enough. It's back at the bowler"
"good length outside off, defended into the covers"
"<b>shot.</b> But superbly fielded. This was coming in at middle stump, handsomely pushed past the non-striker. It's running away to the long-on boundary but Warner has hared across from mid-off. Puts in a huge dive to pull it back"
"full outside off, hard hands as he looks to drive through the line. No feet at all. Aerial for a moment, straight to mid-off"
"full in the corridor, slight shape away and then a big seam movement away. Once again, hard hands and no feet as he looks to drive. Beaten"
"<b>what a shot.</b> Come to me, he says. I'm not going to hit you. The ball, dug into the pitch and rising in the corridor, is lured. It's coming into him, cutting out the angle for any shot. Then, at the last moment, Pandya springs a surprise. A bat, shaped like a ramp, deflects this over slip. Subtle, unlike his haircut"

<b>goes through Smith at slip.</b> An aimless stab in the corridor from Pandya. A nothing shot. It's headed straight to Smith but he sees the open face and starts moving to his right. Means he is already up as this flies low to his left. Would've taken it if he wasn't moving
"full at leg stump, flicked to fine leg's left"
"good shot, but there is that straight mid-off. Nicely timed straight drive to this fuller delivery, but mid-off quickly down to his right"
"back of a length outside off, opens the face and runs it down to third man"
"short ball, doesn't quite come on. He watches it closely and pulls it to fine leg along the floor. There's been a third-umpire referral here. It's a direct hit from the deep. Pandya plonks his bat..and that prompts the referral. He was well in."

"Pandya now advances down the track, hits a short ball from outside off to mid-off"
"back of a length and skids low outside off, not sure if that was the offcutter, Pandya swings for the hills and does not make contact. The ball dies in front of Wade, bad bounce, and it beats him to the boundary. Indeed, it was the quickish offcutter"

"banged in short on leg stump, cramps Dhoni for room, flapped away behind square on the leg side"

"slider on middle, hit back to Zampa"
"Zampa flights it up on the middle stump, asks Pandya to go for it. And he holds nothing back. He clears his front leg and smites it over the wide long-on boundary. <strong>He hits the roof again</strong>"
"middle-stump yorker, dug out"
"Zampa has his revenge. Pushed through flatter and faster on middle, 92ks, no flight at all. Pandya goes low for a slog-sweep against the break, aiming wide long-on again.

"just short of a good length and outside off, Dhoni jabs it away towards backward point. There is a brief moment of hesitation but Dhoni and Bhuvneshwar make it. Dhoni raises his bat and thrills the crowd - this is his <strong>66th ODI fifty</strong>"
"back of a length and outside off, punched into the covers"
"short, wide outside off,<strong> 150ks</strong>, scythed to deep third man"
"back of a length and angled in on off, gently clipped to midwicket, gentle enough to earn two"
"back of a length on middle and leg, worked away through midwicket again"
"and he charges down the track, this is dug short on the leg stump, weak pull over midwicket"
"slower ball from the back of the hand, 114ks, dragged away through square leg"
"hip-high short ball on the leg stump, Dhoni sizes it up, picks it up with the wrists and launches it over short fine leg. Once-bounce four. Cheapuk goes: 'Dhoni!Dhoni!Dhoni!'"
"looks like the back of the hand slower delivery outside off, Dhoni has a big whooosh.... and misses"
"Dhoni surges down the track, Faulkner goes full and wide outside off. Dhoni extends his hands and scythes it over extra cover for a six. Stunning shot. Extra cover isn't really Dhoni's zone"
"Dhoni showing off his smarts. Anticipates the back-of-the-hand slower ball outside off, shuffles across off, takes a length ball from the stumps, and laps it away fine of the man in the deep"
"back of a length and zipping through outside off, Bhuvneshwar presses forward, swings.... and misses"
"middle-stump yorker, excellent ball, dug out"
"very full on middle, backs away outside leg and carves it through cover point"
"slower, back of a length and outside off, check-pushed to point"
"Bhuvneshwar slinks away outside the leg stump, the bowler chases him guided to third man. Dhoni pushes on for the second, Bhuvneshwar responds. Wade can't collect the throw from Faulkner cleanly"
"back of a length on middle, rushes onto Bhuvneshwar, 145ks, he is cramped up for a pull. Ends up splicing it in front of cover. The ball does not carry to Stoinis who was diving forward"
"slower, short ball on the leg stump, all Dhoni has to do is to pull it away to the fine-leg boundary. Well, well, it's a front-foot no-ball as well"
"Faulkner aims for a yorker, goes too full on the pads, Dhoni picks it up with his powerful wrists and whips it with the bottom hand over square leg. Coulter-Nile slides to his right and stops the ball. Dhoni did not even run"
"he doesn't need to run when he can launch it for sixes. This is <strong>vintage Dhoni</strong> and the crowd soaks it in. He surges down the track, meets a length ball outside off and lifts it imperiously over long-off"
"back-of-the-hand slower delivery outside off, Dhoni aims for a club over midwicket. No dice. Beaten"
"Dhoni forays down the track again... this time holes out to long-off. Faulkner's front foot is fine. Faulker pulled his length back, seeing Dhoni step out, on off stump. Dhoni gets it high on the bat and splices it to Warner for a head-high catch"
"Bhuvneshwar shuffled a long way across the off stump even before Faulkner delivered the ball. Length ball outside off, paddled away stylishly to the fine-leg boundary"
"back-of-the-hand slower ball outside off, Bhuvneshwar swings for the hills... and misses"
"back of a length, swinging in at the pads. Tucked to midwicket who is close in"
"back of a length, shaped in at middle stump. Defended off the back foot into the leg side"
"good length, swinging down leg side and past his attempted flick"
"back of a length, bending in at the thigh guard. Late to get his bat around and he awkwardly bunts it into the leg side"
"back of a length outside off, just angle this time, no swing. Pushed to point with an open face"
"slower ball, full outside off stump. Looks to clatter it through the off side but he's forced to check his drive. A knuckle ball from the bowler"
"back of a length at off stump, lifts off after pitching. Takes the thick outside edge but he was playing with soft hands. Dribbles backward of point and they run through"
<b>shot.</b> Beautiful from Warner. This is overpitched on off stump. His front leg's out of the way but the bat comes down nice and straight. Punched past mid-off
"back of a length on the pads, skids in quickly. Nudged off the inside edge to short fine, via thigh guard"
"back of a length at middle stump, defended to midwicket off the back foot"
lovely line. Good length and angled into the corridor. Late on this forward push as it straightens and zips past the outside edge
"length and into the pads. Looks to tickle this fine, but he can only get pad on it. Dhoni collects down leg side. Feeble appeal is turned down"
"back of a length in the corridor, defended into the covers"
"slower ball, full and wide. Chases it with hard hands. Can only slice it to deep point. Uppish, but safe"
"<b>narrowly misses the off stump.</b> Superb seam presentation. Good length, in at off stump and just flies through from above as Cartwright offers a big gap between bat and pad on his push"
<b>outside edge</b> falls short of slip. Length and swinging away from the corridor. Wafts at it on the up and gets a big edge that lands to Rohit Sharma's right. He parries it towards third man
length and swinging into the pads. Warner leaps to smother the bounce and whips it well to the left of deep square. Used his wrists and timed that perfectly
"full and swinging away from middle. Whips against the angle, straight to midwicket"
"back of a length, swinging into his mid-riff. Bit of theatrics from Warner in his stance. But he can't tuck this past midwicket who hares to his right after Warner pushed towards mid-on"
"offcutter, good length and in at off stump. Cops him in the back thigh as he stretches forward. Didn't pick that slower one. They scamper through and he has half-collapsed. Perhaps that was a little right of the inner thigh"
another slower one. This one spits off a length outside off. Shoulder of the bat and into the off side as he fends in front
"back of a length at off stump, pushes too hard as he looks to steal a single in the off side"
"good length at middle stump, tapped wide of mid-on off the back foot"
"<b>bowled him!</b> Bumrah's length is tough to pick for most, let alone a debutant. He sits on the back foot. And swipes across the line on length. It's just short of good length and skids through, as it does for Bumrah. Just above knee height and into the off stump"
"short and wide, slashes hard at it. It bounces rapidly over the outside edge"
"back of a length in the corridor, pulled off the toe-end to long-on"
"back of a length in the corridor, pushed to point off the back foot"
"back of a length outside off, turned to deep square off the back foot"
"<b>in the air</b> but he's safe. It's a slower ball, climbing on him from a length at off stump. He goes across the line but has to check his shot. Manages to chip it over midwicket"
"<b>strikes him on the pads</b> and he's on the back foot trying to shovel this into the leg side. Loud appeal. It hit him on the knee roll. No problem on height for sure. Deep in the crease. <b>They've reviewed.</b> Well, I'd make a terrible umpire. It hit him in line, but that was probably going over. Umpire's call. He survives"
"<b>out the next ball!</b> If you think Bumrah's bowling action is queer, you should see this catch! This is a length ball, on middle stump. Straightens and climbs as he looks to flick this into the leg side. It's a top edge that flies over Bumrah at short fine leg. He runs backwards in pursuit...only to realise he has overdone it. By the time it comes down, he's facing the crowd. Extraordinarily, he arches backwards, puts up a reverse-cup and follows this swerving ball to hold on. As if the ball from the crowd! Stunning"
"good length, spins back in at off stump. Stretches forward and pokes it back. Extra cover dives to his left to field"
"short and wide, spins away a long way. Toe-ended cut to sweeper"
"good length at middle stump, reverse sweep, straight to point"
"good length at leg stump, tucked into the open square leg region off the back foot"
"back of a length outside off, cut past backward point and to sweeper's right"
"tossed up at middle stump, driven firmly to long-on"
"slower ball, full at middle stump. Driven to sweeper with an open face"
back of a length into the pads. An offcutter. Whipped uppishly to deep square's left
"slower ball, short at middle stump. Looks to parry it past short fine but he's got a leading edge that lands in front of Kuldeep. He's too keen on the run out and is shaping to throw before gathering it. Fumbles and lets them through"
"<b>caught behind.</b> Offcutters, slower ball, knuckle balls. Australia have not been able to get themselves in at all. This is a knuckle ball pushed wide, back of a length. Head has plenty of room. But he's early on the shot. Swings hard and gets an outside edge that lobs harmlessly through to Dhoni - almost dipping on him - and he completes a simple take"
"back of a length at off stump. MAxwell already skipping leg side to make room. Slashes this hard, straight to sweeper cover"
"another offcutter, good length and on the pads. Flicked past short fine's dive. Deep backward square keeps it to one"
"back of a length at leg stump, pushed through square leg off the back foot"
"incredible shot. This is full, almost an overpitched one at middle. But he middles the sweep after getting right down. Gets it past square leg. Deep midwicket runs 20 yards to his left and slides to save the boundary"
"full at middle stump, jammed out to midwicket"
"wrong'un, good length at off stump. Deflected off the inside half of the bat as he pushes forward at this"
<b>didn't pick it.</b> On the back foot to this length ball at off stump. Spins away as he pokes at it
"<b>good catch!</b> It's a slider from Kuldeep. After the slow one that turns away from the corridor. This is straight through at the same line. Warner goes for the cut and gets a big outside edge. Dhoni takes a sharp one that nearly slides out of his gloves. A slight juggle to hold on to it. Kuldeep is ecstatic. Warner, less so."
"144 kph. That was quick from Pandya. Maxwell was backing away early, so he followed him with a bouncer. Too quick to even attempt the shot. A stare from Pandya to cap it all"
"yorker at middle stump. Inside edge, onto pad and straight to mid-on via the bowler's fingertips"
"<b>lands wide of mid-on</b> who was backpedalling. Good length ball, slow and outside off. Looks to slice it over extra cover but it's off the toe and lobbed over the umpire. Pandey can't get to it"
"well played. Shuffles around, camps in the crease and waits for the shot ball to come to him. Third man is in and he slices this over him"
<b>whack.</b> Some force on that from Maxwell. Old-fashioned slog after setting up deep in his crease. Midwicket was in and he picked this slower ball from outside off and slapped it past him
"knuckle ball. Dug in short. He backs away to try and slap this behind square on the off side, but the change in pace does him. Beaten"
"short one on the leg stump. Looks to force it off the back foot, awkwardly. It lands pitch side on the off side off the leading edge"
"a stumping referral to the third umpire. This one was outside off at a length. Spun away rapidly as he pushed right forward. His leg is in the air...but in the next frame, as Dhoni flicks the bails off, it has landed. He's safe."
"no idea, Stoinis. Walks across to the off side. Not sure whether to go forward or back. Stuck in between. Awkward poke and he's trapped on the pad. HE was outside the line"
full and fast at middle stump and he goes for the sweep. Just manages to get bat. Just. Turned to short fine
"length at middle stump, forward block"
"tossed up outside off, driven past extra cover and wide of long-off. Back for the second"
"good length, outside off stump. Switches to a left-handed grip and tries to waft this over backward point. Cops it in the body."
"short and spinning down leg. Pin drop silence as the crowd see Maxwell swivel and launch this over short fine. One bounce, into the long leg boundary"
"good length at middle stump, not to the pitch with the slog sweep but he goes through. Gets under it, and lifts it over the midwicket boundary"
"<B>oh, so clean!</b> What a striker of the ball. This is in his slot. Nicely looped full at middle stump. A short stride to get to the pitch and clobbered flat into the sightscreen"
<b>uff! This is what they pay him for.</b> Full one on leg stump. Slightly flat but he's down quickly. On one knee. Lifts it cleanly over the square leg boundary
"back of a length, wrong'un. Spins past his attempted switch-hit. He's beaten outside off"
makes room early. This is full on middle stump. He slices it to sweeper cover
full on leg stump. He goes for the sweep and it flies to square leg. Appears to be a bump ball. And the soft signal is not out as he goes upstairs...<b>not out.</b>
"full outside off, down the track to drive through the off side. Mistimes it. Straight back at the bowler"
"full outside off, misses the reverse sweep. An emphatic, wild reverse sweep attempt"
ohhhhh yesss. Pushed through at leg stump. Down on one knee again. It's so close to him but he gets under and launches it over square leg
"<b>holes out to long-on!</b> Tossed up wide outside off. The perfect place for someone slogging across the line. On length, it's still hittable. But it's also turning away. He gets it off the toe and straight to the fielder. Chahal holds up his arms like everything was planned."
tossed up at off stump. Wrong'un. He's beaten and Dhoni has <b>missed the ball</b> and the stumping. Stoinis was outside
"good length at middle stump, spins into his mid-riff as he pushes forward"
"wrong'un. Good length outside off. Crouches early to set up for the slog sweep. But again, it's spinning away. He lifts it high towards deep midwicket and Jadeja takes it cleanly"
"full toss at leg stump, tickled straight to short fine"
"full at leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
"wrong'un, strikes him in front of off. He didn't pick that on the front foot. Not out says the umpire. May have been going over. There was also the sound of an inside edge"
"Chahal lobs up a middle-stump full-toss, Faulkner flicks the ball out to deep midwicket"
"<strong>Chahal has dropped a return catch</strong>! It wasn't an easy chance. Wade forays down the track, takes it on the full and drives it back to the bowler. Chahal sticks out his right hand but the ball does not stick. Not even on the rebound"
"tossed outside off, Wade runs down the track again, slugs it away to the left of Pandya at deep midwicket"
"pushed through flatter and faster, starts outside leg and spins in to beat the sweep and rap the front pad. The lbw appeal is shot down"
"looks like a googly, turning away from Wade outside off, he slogs at it and the edge swirls to where short third man may have been"
"quickish slider, too full, Faulkner goes low for a slog sweep but is struck on the pad"
"full and sliding down leg, glanced easily to long leg"
"yorker just a shade outside off, jammed out through cover-point"
"full on the pads, whipped away wide of deep midwicket. Faulkner hustles back for the second"
"just short of a good length and outside off, Faulkner chops it hard to deep point"
"full cutter, floats down the leg side as Wade falls over a paddle sweep. Leg-side wide"
"<strong>Wade is hit on the grille of the helmet</strong>. Slower, short ball on leg stump, Wade is through with the hook. Ricochets into the helmet off the arm. India have been excellent with their cutters and slower balls"
"hip-high short ball outside off, which is shovel-pulled away to square leg"
"really full and wide outside off, the batsman backs away outside leg and flat-bats it back to the bowler"
"<strong>Chahal drops another catch off his own bowling</strong>. Tossed outside off, grips, and turns away. The batsman eyes up a swipe across the line, against the turn. The ball balloons to the left of Chahal. He runs to his left, gets both his hands onto the ball, but can't cling on to this edge"
"Wade steps down the track and flashes hard, Chahal drags his length back outside off and darts it wide outside off, well past the batsman's reach. Dhoni collects it and whips the bails off. Chepauk raises itself to a big roar again. More questions over Wade after a poor series with the bat in Bangladesh"
"length-ball googly, breaks back in and bounces over off, Cummins aims to hit down the ground. No dice"
"regulation legbreak outside off, slashes and sends a thick outside edge past slip"
"<strong>Rahane runs in from long-off and drops it</strong>. Tossed up on middle, Faulkner backs away outside leg and lofts it to long-off, where Rahane shells it"
"pushed through outside off, Faulkner drags a slog-sweep from outside off to deep midwicket"
"Faulkner uses his feet, shorter on middle, punched to long-on. Pandey runs in and fumbles. The result is three"
"shortish on middle, flat-batted right back to the bowler, who takes some pace off the ball. It rolls down to long-on"
"really, really full on the leg stump, Faulkner squirts an inside edge to square leg"
"shortish and outside off, powerfully heaved across the line to the right of deep midwicket. Cummins can smack it alright but is this beyond Australia"
"backs away outside leg, meets a short ball and crisply forces it to the sweeper"
"full on off, possibly a slower ball, as Faulkner swats it across the line to deep midwicket"
"The asking rate has ballooned. Cummins aims to prick the balloon with a slog over midwicket, against the break. But a top edge balloons to short third man. It started on middle and turned away to claim the edge"
"tossed-up legbreak outside off, Faulkner clears his front leg and clatters it into the sightscreen. Lofted straight down the ground"
"faster and flatter on off, shovel-pulled away to deep midwicket"
"flat dart on off, whipped out to deep midwicket"
"skidding into leg stump, beats the flick, and raps the pad"
"legbreak, starts outside off and spins away, slugged away to deep midwicket"
"just short of a good length and outside off, Faulkner throws his bat at the ball and sends a thick outside edge through where slip may have been"
"Bumrah searches for the yorker, misses his length and offers up a full-toss on off, which is belted ram-rod straight down the ground, so much so it strikes the stumps at the non-striker's end"
"The batsman moves away outside leg but Bumrah still troubles him with a yorker, jammed out for one"
"full-toss on off, punched down to long-on. The call from Faulker is for two but Australia have to settle with just one"
"change-up slower ball outside off, 109ks offcutter, NCN swings early... and misses"
"another one, slower, fuller, wider outside off. Coulter-Nile does not spot the lack of pace. He slogs way too early"
"middle-stump yorker, dragged to long-on off the toe end"
"wide of the crease and floated very wide outside off, well past the guideline, off-side wide"
"Heaved flat and hard to Jadhav at deep midwicket. Good length slower one at 114ks, not sure if that was a knuckle ball. Coulter-Nile can't clear the man in the deep. Rohit gives Jadhav a leaping high-five"
"full and straight on middle, drilled down to long-off"
"off-stump yorker, squeezed out"
"full and wide outside off, scythed away through the covers"
"back of a length and outside off, punched on the up to extra cover"
very full and the exaggerated angle makes things difficult for Faulkner. Flicked away through midwicket. Faulkner farms the strike
"Faulkner extends his hands, slashes, and edges it behind. The ball dips on Dhoni who dives forward and gloves the ball. But he isn't sure if it's a clean catch. He has a wry smile. The soft signal from umpire Erasmus is out. They go to the TV umpire. Nope, Dhoni has grassed it"
"slower short ball outside off, past the wild swing, off-side wide"
"really, really full on off, not a perfect yorker, squeezed down to long-on. There is a mix-up between the wickets. The throw from the deep, though, hits Faulkner on his back side"
"full and wide outside off, 109ks, Zampa slices it in the air, Jadhav races in from sweeper cover but the ball drops short of him"
"dug short and outside off, another slower ball, swatted to long-on"
"Bumrah nails a yorker on middle, squirted away to short fine leg. That is that. <strong>India win the series opener</strong> by 26 runs (D/L method). This is Australia's ninth successive ODI loss on the road, in completed matches"
