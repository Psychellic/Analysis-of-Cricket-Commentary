Low-arm slider from Jadhav, comes on even slower off the pitch, Neesham stretches across for a sweep and misses. He is struck outside the line. Neesham, however, strays out of the crease. He isn't aware that the ball rolls behind to Dhoni, who takes a couple of quiet steps, appeals for the lbw; then under-arms it onto the stumps and steals a wicket from right under Neesham's nose. For a change, Dhoni jumps and celebrates a wicket. He is quite thrilled with his effort. We don't often see Dhoni celebrate a wicket in such animated fashion these days #CoolcatMSD"
