he goes on the back foot for the first ball and steers the back of the length ball to point
"much straighter and on the stumps, he taps it back to Shakib"
"the crowd appeals as Amla is struck on the pads, but well down the leg side"
"dances down the track after three dots and flicks that away with the wrists and in the air, between mid-on and midwicket for four"
clears his front foot a bit and drives this full one from outside off nicely to long off
it's pitched up and Mosehle uses a lot of power and hard hands to loft that over the covers for a cracking four! Doesn't need time to get his eye in
full and on the pads. Not a good idea to bowl to Amla there as he can flick with his eyes shut. But there's a fielder in the deep so only two runs
"much tighter from Taskin, good length ball around off. He pulls the length back a fair bit and Amla defends with a straight bat"
"shuffles across this time and he flicks it beautifully along the ground. He knows the field so well, he goes across and flicks it pretty wide of deep midwicket to get four this time. It wasn't a bad ball at all"
"some room this time, Amla slashes with a big follow through but finds point where a dive saves them four runs"
"bangs it short to Mosehle, who stays back in the crease and taps it behind square for a single"
"it's a short ball, there's a deep midwicket in place, Amla pulls! Has he fallen for the trap? No, he has absolutely middled that pull from just outside off and the fielder watches the ball sail over him for six!"
"he taps the ball to point and set off, almost a mix up but he returns back to the crease in time and no damage done"
"tries to paddle it against the turn now, from outside off. Takes it on the front pad amid a stifled appeal"
"that's gone through! Mosehle goes back this time as Shakib slips in a flatter one that goes with the arm, Mosehle wants to work it to leg but misses the line completely. The ball deflects off his pads and gets the top of off stump"
"pretty full around off, tucked straight to midwicket"
takes a step down to take the ball on the full and gets off the mark with a single to long on
"tosses it up nicely, Amla waits for it and flicks against the turn to leg for one"
"just outside off with his offspin, it's helped to the leg side by Amla for one"
"angled in towards JPD's legs, it's full and he drives it inside out to long off"
plonks his front foot forward and lets his wrists do the rest - flicking with flair to deep midwicket for two
<strong>there's an outside edge</strong>! Nicely bowled outside off and it didn't turn as much as Amla expected. He looked to drive it to leg with the turn but the outside edge flew towards short third man
just outside off and Duminy cuts it to point
"goes down on a knee and tries a slog sweep against the turn of the full ball, gets an inside edge onto his pad and survives the lbw"
"a misfield at backward point! It was a fairly short ball, Amla rocked on the back foot for that cut and it went straight to point and straight through his legs"
uses his feet and dabs the ball towards mid on
goes back to cover the stumps and helps the ball towards square leg for one
"a very straight-bat lofted drive from Duminy after coming the track, that's gone very high as fielders are trying to come under it. Liton runs back from mid-off and dives, but it was out of his reach"
taps the straighter length ball back to the bowler
"the stumps are knocked over again, it's time for the captain to walk back! A flatter delivery from Shakib does it again, it was full on middle stump and looks like Duminy tried a premeditated sweep. Goes right under the ball and hits middle and leg"
"length ball outside off, easily worked down to long on for one"
"slightly quick on off and middle, AB flicks to deep midwicket to get off the mark"
"a length ball around off stump again, Amla works it to the deep again for a single on the leg side"
"lots of drama! AB charges down and hammers it back, Mehedy gets both hands on it and rams into Amla who loses his balances but inside the crease"
uses his feet a bit and taps it down to long on again
it's down the leg side and Amla changes his bat angle quickly to paddle it very very fine in the gap for a four!
"lots of flight and lots of room outside off, AB waits and drives away from the body. A quick single is completed as the throw was slightly wayward from the cover fielder"
"Amla walks down, Shakib floats it a bit slow on middle and Amla helps it down to long on"
well outside off again to AB who drives it easily to Mhedy at cover
"AB tries to fox the bowler by shuffling and coming back, then drives the ball to sweeper cover for one"
"nicely angled in from wide of the crease towards off stump, Amla blocks"
"pulls it a tad shorter on off, that's enough for Amla to rock back and work the ball to midwicket for one"
there are two fielders down the ground but Amla bisects them with a superb lofted straight drive straight over the bowler's head
goes back in the crease this time to help the ball towards square leg for one
"<strong>crackalicious</strong> from AB! He dances down the ground and takes the ball on the full to absolutely hammer that from outside off, and it sails long and high over long on for a massive six. It's out of the ground and into the trees"
"not a great strategy to bowl a full toss after that six, he wanted to give a lot of flight I guess. AB caresses that along the ground from outside off and beats sweeper cover"
""
"pretty flat and shortish on off and middle, Amla works it to deep midwicket for one"
bangs the first ball short to Amla who goes on his toes and cuts to third man
"a short ball to AB as well, he drives it off the back foot towards sweeper cover"
"just back of length and not much room outside off, Amla dabs it with delicate hands to third man"
"length ball with some width outside off, AB swings with a big follow through for a single to sweeper cover again"
"slightly full outside off, Amla middles that cover drive but finds cover too"
mid off goes deep but Rubel pitches it slightly short with some room and Amla pounces on that by scything it between point and third man for a cracking four
the batsman backs away first ball and Saifuddin does well to bowl it wide outside off
"fuller and closer to the off stump, AB flicks it with hard hands to deep midwicket"
"outside off and little short, Amla runs it to third man for one"
"makes room and sees a full toss coming towards the stumps, AB tries to smash it back but doesn't quite middle it. Gets two runs down the ground between long off and long on"
"smashed down the ground this time, it's going to go over the boundary, but no! Imrul Kayes is waiting at long-off and times his jump to perfection to grab it with both hands. That was going at some speed, I must tell you. Great effort from Imrul"
superb over from Saifuddin comes to an end as Miller drives the length ball back and it's stopped by the bowler
drives this one nicely through the covers for one and that's his <b>half-century</b> off only 32 balls
"<b>dropped</b> but that an effort that was from Mushfiqur! Rubel banged in his short ball, Miller pulled but got only a glove onto that down the leg side, the keeper put in a full length dive and caught it too but it popped out at the end. Snicko confirms there was a bit of glove"
drives this fullish ball towards mid off for one
"back of length ball angling in, Amla taps it towards fine leg for one"
"he taps the length ball on off stump close to the pitch and takes off, Amla responds and they complete a quick single"
hint of room for Amla and he drives it to deep cover for one
"just back of length outside off, Amla hops and sends it square on the off side for one"
"that's gone high on the off side, three fielders come under it but it lands right in between them! What luck for Miller. He used his feet and tried a lofted drive, but it was a slower delivery and he couldn't middle it. It went high over the covers but landed safe"
towards the pads now and Miller flicks it behind square on leg for a single towards short fine leg
"angling in from outside off, Amla gets a thick inside edge towards long leg, it's gone a bit wide of the fielder and they return for two"
this one is around off too and Amla calls for two as soon as he sends the ball between long on and deep midwicket
"gets some width, it's a bit short too and Amla cuts it nicely between third man and point for four. Not the delivery Saifuddin would have wanted for the last ball and he concedes 12"
"he gets a chance to free his arms finally with some room outside off, swings for the drive and gets four through the covers"
"good ball from Taskin, bangs it short outside off and it nips in towards Miller's chest, hardly getting any bat on it"
uses his feet to come down this time and taps the ball towards mid off for one
"back of length outside off, Amla waits till the last second and dabs it fine towards third man. A good diving effort from Mahmudullah saves a couple of runs"
he's in such good nick today! Amla middles that drive and it's running away but Saif puts in a good dive running to his left from deep cover and he saves two too
"short ball outside off to end the over, Amla waits again and pokes his bat for a ramp kind of a shot over the slip cordon (there's nobody there) and it's gone for four!"
"angles ball in towards the batsman, he works it away to leg for two"
'catch it' says a fielder or the keeper as soon as Miller charges down and slams that full delivery to the leg side. Long on might have thought he had a chance but it went well wide of him to his left
"what happened there - he tries the sweep and misses, but the ball deflects off the pad and then off the back of his bat and around the keeper to the off side for one"
it's a short ball and there's enough room for Amla to rock back and unleash a beautiful square drive to collect four more on the off side
"another paddle shot from Amla and it's four more! It's down the leg side, he closes the face of the bat quickly and sends it fine"
more towards the stumps this time and it's driven down to long on for an easy single
turns the ball in a bit towards Amla who works it away to deep midwicket
"flattish outside off, Miller scythes it to deep point"
hint of room outside off now and Amla steers it away on the off side
"oh, he survives again, such luck for Miller! He came down a long way and made room, the bowler pitched it wide and Miller only got an edge on it, the ball rolls back towards the stumps and misses it by a few centimetres only. Miller also dives back to avoid the stumping and Mushfiq can't believe it!"
"that won't hold him back though! He charges down and slams that from the middle of the bat over the long off boundary and sends the flying for six! Oh my, looks like that hit a boy's left shoulder in the crowd"
""
"there's <strong>direct hit</strong> and they've gone upstairs, gets a big cheer from the crowd! Miller tucked the ball angling in towards midwicket and it went straight to the fielder but he set off for the single, and just made it in time"
"short ball, looks like Amla wanted to go for a big heave but he eventually gets a thick edge that flies over the slip region and goes fine for four"
"short again outside off, Amla punches that square on the off side for one"
"tries the block hole and Miller opens his stance in time, also connects well and dispatches it to the cow corner"
"makes room early, Rubel pitches it on length on the leg stump but Miller absolutely tonks that very high over long on for six!"
he has disturbed Rubel's rhythm. That's a wide down the leg side
"that's almost like a replay of 15.4. Rubel wants to hit the block hole but is not very accurate, Miller gets his front foot out of the way and bludgeons it to the wide long on boundary"
Saifuddin shows how to get the yorker right. Right on target and Amla digs it out
"he goes across early and wants to scoop it fine on leg, Saifuddin has a good reply by sending it slightly wide outside off and Amla misses it completely"
"slow ball at 97.1kph from Saifuddin, what a spell he is bowling as he gets Amla now. It was slow and outside off, Amla went for the heave but he targeted the midwicket boundary. That was a long distance to cover from outside off and he finds Soumya in the deep"
"he makes room as soon as Saif starts his run up, the bowler tries the yorker but it's a low full toss and Miller gets four with an orthodox drive through the covers and in the gap"
on the leg stump and he works it square on the leg side for one
almost in the block hole and Behardien runs it down to long off for one
"pretty short and coming in, the batsman pulls it a bit awkwardly behind square on the leg side"
"in the block hole, Behardien manages to work it down to long on for one"
"sends the slower ball at 116kmh down the leg side, bounces a couple of times before reaching the keeper"
"a bouncer to follow the slower one, Miller hooks and gets a top edge flying high and fine down the leg side to get to his <b>half-century</b>"
"what a sound that was from the middle of the bat. Nobody move! Tries the block hole, Miller gets a freebie because it's a full toss around the off stump and he smashes it with such a sweet sound to the wide long on boundary!"
"much better from Taskin, a slower one on the legs. Miller tries to work it to leg but is deceived by pace, gets a leg bye. It wasn't far from the stumps though after deflecting off the pads"
"Tasking will be happy with the last ball. Full and wide outside off, Behardien reaches out for it but gets only an edge to the keeper. It bounced, obviously"
he tries the slower one but it's pretty full and Miller picks it. He waits and then swings his arms to send that sailing over wide long on again. That's the first six off Saifuddin in this innings
"full and outside off, Miller picks the length early again, gets under it nicely and drives it inside-out over the covers, taking the fielder out of the equation for six more"
"make that <strong>three in a row</strong>! It's on his legs as he shuffles across a bit, another full delivery and Miller simply times the flick well and that's gone behind square on leg for six more"
"four out of four, what's happening here! SA are over 200 already! Another full delivery down leg, another way to get the legs out of the way and another flick that dispatches the ball over the long-leg boundary"
"those two fielders can keep staring and track the trajectory of the ball sail over them! <strong>Five in five</strong>. It's short this time, Miller is in the crease and pulls it over the leg side"
"oh, Miller has driven that along the ground after going down on a knee. The disappointment shows on his face as soon as the ball goes off his bat. Saif bowled it full and wide and survived"
"oh, he loses his balance while trying to reach for the full  ball outside off, gets enough bat and he's flat on the ground but gets four too!"
"tries to smash this low and wide full toss, gets only a thick under edge and that beats the keeper on the off side for four more"
"it's bowled on the legs, he flicks and gets two between deep midwicket and long on"
"fullish outside off, he drives, he wants two and he gets two. What a <strong>century</strong> that is from David Miller when everyone was thinking Amla would get there!"
whips the ball to midwicket but doesn't get the middle of the bat
digs this last ball out to cover and the bowler runs to his left to fetch the ball. Miller turns around quickly and they get two on the last ball
not a bad start from Imrul! The bowler strays too much down the leg side and it's flicked to the leg side for a first-ball four
"pulls the length shorter and into Imrul, he taps it to leg for one"
"first-ball four for Soumya too! He spots the short ball early and pulls it off the middle of the bat, between mid on and midwicket for four!"
"what a shot! It's straight and full, maybe Soumya expected that after the short ball and he sends that straight and high down the ground for a six. The Bangladeshi supporters have woken up!"
another short ball and it's gone down leg for a wide
"good-length delivery towards off stump, Soumya defends it into the covers for a single. Good thinking, not getting carried away"
"just back of length around off, it's steered towards cover point"
"<strong>dropped</strong>, that went straight to Frylinck at mid-on and popped out. Soumya charged down and slapped it with a heave to mid on, the fielder had it around his knees but could not hold on"
slashes outside off and gets a thick outside edge just past the keeper. It's all happening here
"shorter ball, he pulls it in the air, shout of 'catch it' from the keeper but it lands well short of the fielder"
""
"he makes a lot of room, Duminy bangs it in short and quick, Soumya tries to dispatch on the off side but misses. The ball deflects off the keeper to short fine leg"
"a chance of a run out! The keeper said 'keeper-keeper' as soon as Soumya slammed the ball into the covers. Miller was there, he collected the ball cleanly and threw it quick although a bit wayward. But Mosehle did well to go to his left to collect the throw and then crash into the stumps to his right. Imrul was well outside the crease"
goes for a heave and only gets an inside edge to the leg side
"not much room around off, Shakib defends it to get off the mark"
"on the pads, that's easy for Soumya to flick nicely over the leg side and he gets a one-bounce four for that"
"slower ball at 117kph, it's short of length too. Soumya waits and taps it square on the leg side for one"
"just outside off, slightly short, Shakib hops and punches the ball to cover point"
"almost hands a catch back to the bowler. It was a slower one again, he spotted it just in time and defended the ball back but it bounced once before reaching Frylinck"
in the air again as Shakib plays the ball on the off side on the up and sends it towards cover
"Duminy was bowled by Shakib and now Duminy turns it around! Shakib made a lot of room for the off side but Duminy made sure he targeted the stumps, sending it at 82kph, Shakib wanted to flat-bat it on the off side and missed it completely. The music come on at the ground"
lobs the ball from outside leg to midwicket and gets off the mark
waits for the ball to turn a bit and taps it to backward point for one
"goes for a big sweep even though it pitched outside off, misses it though"
pushes this one down to mid off for one
just over the stumps as Mushfiq makes room and tries to work it to off but misses
"another one goes down, Bangladesh are crumbling! He had been making room too often, this time he went to the off side to scoop the ball over the keeper and only got a faint edge behind the stumps"
"good length ball headed towards the stumps, solid defence in reply. Something we haven't seen too much of today"
pitches it wider outside off and he lets it go this time
"pulls this back of length ball, doesn't quite middle it and gets one to mid on"
"slightly slower outside off at 122, Soumya heaves and misses"
"short one first ball, Sabbir lets it turn in and lofts it nicely over the bowler's head with a straightish pull for a one-bounce four"
he wants more but hands the easiest of catches to mid off! They are four down in the Powerplay. Sabbir came down the track and went for a half-hearted swing and only found the fielder
what a shot to get off the mark. Saw some width outside off and he caressed that along the ground with a square drive for a smooth four
works this one to leg along the ground for one
"lots of room outside off, he reaches out for it and gets a single to mid off"
goes back in the crease and taps the ball to midwicket for one
"pitched up, Soumya stands tall and drives that in the air and down the ground with such elegance. Mid off is in so hardly any risk in that"
"there's no stopping Soumya! Got a slightly short ball, it wasn't that short, and he pulls it with some power to beat deep midwicket for four"
angled outside off now and he runs it down to third man for one
"almost in the block hole, he digs it out to the leg side for one"
"poor ball on the leg side, Amla is at short fine leg in the circle and Soumya places it wide of him with a pull that goes wide for four"

"just short of length from round the wicket, Soumya goes back and works it to leg and comes back for the second"
outside off this time and he patiently taps it to short third man for one
"bit of flight and very wide outside off, he reaches out for the drive and gets an edge back to the bowler"

"on length outside off, he defends into the covers for a quick single"

sends that well outside off for a wide
"not too far from the stumps, Soumya goes for a slog sweep and misses it"
"full toss on the pads, Soumya goes down on a knee to accept that freebie and sweeps it wide of short fine leg for four"
better length from Phangiso and he taps it to leg for one
"angling in towards the pads, worked away for one behind square for one"
"holes out to deep midwicket, right at the boundary. The well-set batsman has gone too. It was the seventh ball of the over because of a wide and it's too costly for Soumya. He went for the slog sweep and connected well but needed another couple of yards to clear Hendricks in the deep"
"length delivery around off, pushed down with soft hands towards long on and they come back quickly for the second"

"turn and width outside off, Mahmudullah makes room too and cuts it to sweeper cover"
little full this time and it's driven to deep cover for one
"short ball straightaway, Liton hardly moves his stance and pulls it away over the deep midwicket fielder for a six!"
he wants more and swings hard but gets a top edge that goes high behind square. Frylinck had dropped a sitter earlier but this time runs back from short fine leg and takes a tough catch with both hands. Six down
"shortish outside off, Liton slap-pulls it to wide long on"
"tests him with the short ball straightaway. It was a well-directed bouncer that pitched on leg and went towards Saifuddin's chin, he couldn't duck or sway out of the line and managed to get some glove in front of his face"
towards the leg stump again and it's helped to midwicket for one
"hardly any room outside off, Mahmudullah pushes it to backward point"
"on leg with a bit of turn, easily tucked to backward square leg for one"
"drives the full ball inside out and in the air, it bounces once before reaching deep cover"
"<strong>falls just short</strong> of fine leg, despite a forward dive. Mahmudullah swept it behind square and Phehlukwayo thought he was placed fine in the deep but realised a bit late that it was going to land in front of him. He put in a dive in front at the last moment but was too late"
"gone this time as Mahmudullah charges down and Phangiso angles the ball, he misses it completely and it's an easy stumping for Mosehle"

"that's a bit too short from Phangiso, Saifuddin rocks back and pulls that away for a clean six over deep midwicket"
tries another heave and misses this time outside off
"tight line outside of, Saifuddin closes the face of the bat early and gets an outside edge on off"
he pushes the length ball to off but no time for a run
"the last ball angles in, he helps it along behind square on the leg side and gets one, but there's an overthrow for another run"
"rolls his fingers over that slower delivery on middle and leg, Saifuddin works it to leg for one"
"direct hit creates some excitement. Mehedy makes room and Phehlukwayo pitches it up, he slams it down to mid off and Duminy hits at the keeper's end but Saifuddin had made it"
"goes for a swing outside off as the ball angled away, but misses"
"nearly gets Mehedy's head on the way as he slaps that short ball straight down, for a four towards mid off"

starts with a slower and inaccurate ball down leg for a wide
pitched up now outside off and he bunts it down to cover for one
"another wicket falls, it's the first for Phehlukwayo as he sends down a slower bouncer. Mehedy waits and makes room, and then goes after it with a horizontal swing but only top edges it. It goes high on the off side and the keeper comes under it comfortably"
"length delivery on the pads, gets a leg bye after the ball deflects off his pads towards square leg"
"superb yorker from round the wicket, Taskin is beaten for pace and takes it on the shoes. That could have been plumb bit but Phehlukwayo overtepped"
"a wild heave from Taskin, gets an inside edge and that beats the keeper to go for four to the fine leg boundary"
"that's a nasty high full toss from Phehlukwayo, it hits Taskin on the arm off the edge as he tries to pull. He is clearly hurt there and Saifuddin wants a single and is face to face at the batsman's end. The fielder picks the ball and throws to the bowler's end for an easy run out. It was a no ball for the height"
"that's gone pretty wide on the off side, he wings and misses and it's called wide again"
"pitches it up on the stumps, he swings and finds deep midwicket after a bounce"
"full delivery on the stumps, he jams it to midwicket"
"a full toss to start the over, he gets a single to third man"
