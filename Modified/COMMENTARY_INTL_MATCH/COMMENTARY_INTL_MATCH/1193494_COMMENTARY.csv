"short of length on the stumps, punches it towards long-on"

"short and wide, rocks back and smashes it between cover and extra cover to end the over with another four"
"nippy delivery on a length, coming back into him, nudged off the inside half of the bat towards mid-on. <b>sloppy fielding means they get an over throw</b>. An under-arm flick towards the stumps that misses and no one's backing up"
"hint of swing but too full, driven crisply to wide mid-off's right"
"slogged across the line but clears the long-on boundary. No fielder there, so it's a safe shot. Not short enough to pull, he gets it down the end of the bat and it goes very high in the air"

"fuller length outside off, gets nicely on the front foot and drives, but extra cover moves to his right and slides to stop it"

"throws this wider of off and spinning away further, Hetmyer was giving himself room and has to stretch out and glide it through point"

"floated up fuller and closer to off stump, he pats it down to long-off"
drifts down leg and Hetmyer wants to smash a sweep shot but doesn't nail it. Complete contrast in rhythm between the two batsmen
"fires in a yorker, but Lewis goes inside out, drives it off his toes to deep cover"
"<b>fifty for Lewis</b> and it's come off just 26 balls. He goes for finesse over power this time, sweeps it fine from the leg stump and gets the timing and placement perfect to beat the man at deep square"
Rashid corrects his line to bring it more middle stump and Lewis works it backward of square
"that's the shot of a man feeling the pressure of not scoring. Tried to hit his way into form, ends up squirting it off an expansive drive, to deep cover"
"fuller on the stumps, flicked off his toes to wide long-on"
was giving himself room and going back but it's a quickish slider that he ends up bunting back to the bowler
too short and Hetmyer's not going to look this gift horse in the mouth. Goes back and absolutely leathers a pull shot that clears deep midwicket comfortably. That shot will make him feel good
"clever ball first up, goes for a slower ball that's pitched back of a length. Lewis is lining up to smack it but ends up completely lost, drops his wrist and lets it go to the keeper"

shows the full face of the bat to punch it down the ground very straight
"goes down on one knee to sweep it hard, but there's a sweeper in place at deep midwicket"
beaten him that time. Hetmyer was giving himself room but Rashid sent this in quicker and he misses the flick off the back foot
"<b>got him this time</b>. Might have been a wrong 'un, though Rashid tends to bowl his leggies without too much change of action. Was very full and Hetmyer went for the big slog sweep, ends up edging it onto pad and it loops up for the keeper to come forward and take the catch"
"length outside off, nudged to long-on"
"length ball nipping back in, steered to short third man"
"good length going across the left-hander, who stays inside the line and punches through cover"

"another slower one, this time he waits for it and drives firmly to mid-off, who has a shy as they take a risky single. Results in an extra run. <b>If Rashid at mid-off had hit, Lewis would have been out</b>"

"good ball, well wide of off stump but inside the tram line and bowled back of a length. He has to reach out for it and doesn't connect"

"Lewis tries to counter the line by moving well across and outside off. Tries to send it to Kanpur from Lucknow with an almighty swing of the bat, but doesn't connect"
"<b>Naib has earned that wicket</b>. Frustrated Lewis into mis-hitting that one after a succession of balls that the batsman didn't even connect with. This one was a mite shorter and Lewis wanted to pull that into oblivion, but ends up getting a top edge that settles comfortably into long-off's hands"

goes back and punches this to cover
"skids on and almost catches him in front, but he manages to get the bat down in time to jab it into the offside"

"another slower ball, he has to wait for it and ends up pushing it into the offside"

tapped off the back foot to long-on
"length on off, Pollard lunges and pushes it to the bowler's left"
outside edge goes fine but short third man makes a good stop by tumbling and diving. Pollard pushing forward again but this turns more than he though and takes the edge
"length ball on the stumps, punched through cover"
giving himself room to flay it through the offside but gets an under edge that bounces to the keeper. Just misses the stumps too
<b>knocked him over</b>. Floated up a slower ball yorker and Ramdin is way too early into his slog sweep. The ball sneaks under his bat and shatters stumps

"length well outside off, steered to backward point who makes a mess of it. Slides and it pings off his body towards extra cover, which gives them an extra run"

"length on the stumps, he goes right back and flicks it off his pads to short fine leg"
"fuller, flicked off his toes to deep midwicket"

"bowls the bouncer quicker that time, but Pollard is equal to it and pulls to deep midwicket. There's a fielder there to clean up"
"<b>got 'im!</b>. Saw the batsman giving him the charged and bowled the offcutter, while also pulling his length back. The ball sneaks into the rather large gap left with Rutherford attempting to swing for the fences, and knocks over the stumps"

too far outside off and he'll have to rebowl that
"slower ball now, angling into him, and Allen not able to read it, ends up pushing to cover"

"throws the kitchen sink at that one, similar line and length well outside off but he goes towards the ball that time and gets a goodish bit on it. One bounce to deep point"
"slower ball on the stumps, Pollard's too early into the drive and mis-times it totally. Goes off the inside half but very straight and in no man's land. Long on runs around and fields"
"throws his bat at it again, trying to pull it through midwicket. Ends up getting it off the toe end and straighter. The dew is evident in how Afghanistan are sliding to stop the ball"
slower ball again outside off this time. Better connection but straight to long-off
"slower ball and he mis-times it, goes in the air but lands short of deep midwicket. Was clearing his leg to give himself room but Naib has had some wonderful changes of pace that no West Indies batsman has mastered. Ends a fine spell"
"going across him, took the pace off. Pollard had cleared his leg and was almost front on, wanted to really whack that. Doesn't connect"

"length ball around off, smashes it but straight towards the extra cover fielder"

"good length going across him, ends up feeling for it and it passes the outside edge"
"<b>leading edge just clears point</b>. Zazai had no clue about that, early into the shot, trying to turn it to the legside and ball flies off the leading edge. Fortunate that it didn't go to hand"
"<b>straight into short fine leg's hands</b>. Moves across his stumps to flick this length ball fine, but gets the placement and control horribly wrong. He's distraught but has to go"
"length outside off, defended carefully back to the bowler"
"outside edge, falls just short of the slip fielder. Length outside off, took the shoulder of the bat, but he played it with soft hands too"
<b>shot</b>. Goes on the front foot and lofts his cover drive over the in-field. The dew means the ball slows up enough for the fielders to hare after it and pull it back before the boundary
"length on the stumps, tucked off his thigh pad to deep square"
"not a debut to remember for the youngster, who goes to pull this back of a length ball outside off, but is undone by the ball getting bigger on him than he though, ends up spooning a simple catch to midwicket, with the ball going straight up in the air"

"length outside off, taps it towards cover for one"
"short of length around off, pulled towards deep square leg"

"slower length ball, pulled away towards deep square leg, in the air. And a brilliant catch by Keemo Paul, coming in and diving forward, or is it? Paul is not sure even though Pollard is celebrating.
