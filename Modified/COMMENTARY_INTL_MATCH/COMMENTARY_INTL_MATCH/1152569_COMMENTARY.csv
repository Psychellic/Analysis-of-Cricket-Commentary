"that's an even bigger wide, dragged short, barely lands on the cut strip"
"goes full and is sent straight down the ground, a meaty thump by Harris as he opens his front leg to allow him to swing through the line"
"drags the length back, on off stump, clumps a pull over midwicket without much timing"
that's an excellent shot! Steps to the leg side and finds perfect timing as he square drives a back-of-a-length off-cutter

"nearly a run out! Lot happening there...Harper walked right across outside off, shape to scoop this, then blocked it and was then sent back by Finch"
"<B>huge appeal for lbw, Worrall can't believe it, then would have been run out with a direct hit!</b> Another slower ball, very full, Harper misses his flick. Taken on the boot, the ball deflects to backward point. Outside the line for lbw, good decision. Miles out if Bird had hit"

"short of a length, another cutter, inside edge into the pad"
"short of a length, angled in at the body, Finch misses his pull and gets taken in the ribs"

"<B>big googly, loops short of backward point!</b> Harvey struggled against the leggie, plays back to a shorter delivery and it comes off the splice of the bat"
"<B>skids on, lbw!</b> Terrific bit of bowling. Was beaten all ends up. Just back of a length, doesn't turn, slides straight on and he's back in the crease. Probably taking leg stump"

"back of a length, straight, big appeal for lbw but not given...height the issue"
"yorker length at middle stump, jammed out to midwicket"
<b>oh you beauty!</b> Zampa with the goods. A top class googly. Tossed right up at driving length and he looks to get it down to long-on. But the front leg is out of the way because he expects this to turn in. This keeps him short enough from the pitch of the ball to allow it to turn from middle and tonk the top of off
length ball sliding through at leg stump. A watchful bat-pad poke into the leg side
<b>yorks himself</b> by stepping out and jams it into the midwicket region. Length ball pushed through flat at middle stump and he's completely tangled

"lovely bowling. Length and dipping outside off. Steps out and is beaten in flight, but manages to poke this through the covers"
"length and down leg side, subdued reverse sweep to backward point"
"<b>stunning</b> work from long-on. Cooper picks this googly from wide outside off and swipes between deep-midwicket and long-on. The latter sprints to his right and whips it back in, a completely one-handed effort"
<b>run-out chance missed</b> as Maxwell's throw climbs over the stumps at the non-striker's end. Length ball pushed hurriedly towards long-off. Maxi gets across and throws from extra cover with Cooper having given up
"length just outside off, chopped to point"
"length on middle stump, punched to long-off with the turn"
<b>walks into the off side</b> and ramps this fine. It's almost like they've been waiting for the all-pace attack that will greet them from now on. This is at a length on off stump and he gets it to the fine leg boundary

"length outside off, shuffles and mistimes a slog to deep midwicket. It's off the inside half"
"<b>smokes it over sweeper cover!</b> What a hit. Overpitched outside off, gets the front leg into the leg side and opens the face to slice this from under. It's flat and it just clears Bird's outstretched hand"
"yorker on middle stump, jammed down to long-on"
"yorker length outside off, allows it to come on and guides it to sweeper's left"
full and swung in towards off stump. Shuffles and clips to mid-on's right

"<b>slower ball</b> gets him on the back thigh. Lobbed up, around the wicket again, and he misses on the slog sweep after setting up for it deep in the crease"

slower ball at a length outside off. Inside edge onto thigh as he looks to slog sweep again
"short of a length just outside off, stabbed to extra cover's right off the back foot"
"<b>attempted legcutter</b> is a slow loopy full toss, wide otuside off. He waits on it, stretches across and slashes it over extra cover"
"legcutter, short of a length on leg stump. Cramps him on the pull and it's an inside edge, pitch side on the leg side"
"<b>one too many!</b> Worrall goes for yet another legcutter, but Cooper is waiting for it. It's loopy and it's overpitched on the leg side. He waits for it to come on and drills it over the midwicket boundary"
"full outside off, driven to extra cover off the toe-end"
"<b>full toss</b> on leg stump and he whips it away to the long leg boundary. Worrall losing his length again. This was there, it was pacey, and Cooper helped himself"
"<b>past mid-off</b> but long-on cleans up. Another attempted legcutter, flighted full outside off. Got the front leg out and bisected mid-off and the bowler"

"overpitched outside off, slanted across him but he can't get his drive past mid-off"

"inswinging yorker at middle stump, steps out and toe-end the drive towards extra cover"
"<b>clubbed over midwicket!</b> Stunning balance from Cooper. Hasn't been too fluent today, but he's calm as he gets deep in the crease and sets up for this slower ball. It lands on a length and he nails the slog"
"<b>overthrows</b> after a missed run-out chance at the non-striker's end. Yorker from Bravo, deflected pitch side after he digs it out and the throw from the bowler climbs over the stumps and no one is backing up"

falls short of deep midwicket. Short and rising up at middle stump. Pulls on the front foot and the fielder runs to his left to grab this on the bounce
<b>past point.</b> Short of a length in the corridor. Allows it to come on and angles the bat late to guide this to the fielder's right. <b>That brings up his fifty as well</b>. Solid knock.

"oh sweet timing, but extra cover springs to the right to stop. Length outside off, gets his weight into this drive with the full face offered"
"<b>oh hello.</b> Handscomb with his contribution to the make-this-final-close cause. Runs down the pitch, seemingly to lift this over mid-off. But he's swishing with all the grace of a cow tied to a revolving door, because this ball's gotten big on him from a length. Slices and mid-off runs to the left to hold on"

"dropped short outside off, backs away and chops it past point. Sweeper cleans up to his right"
"<b>he's got a wicket off his last ball!</b> Dunk will be furious at himself for this. So solid all evening, but he looks to crunch this one despite long-off being quite straight. It's overpitched on off and he drills it flat to that fielder"
"<b>oh boy!</b> In less than three overs, Stars have completely handed the momentum to Renegades! Another ordinary shot. Short of a length ball coming in at his pads. He wants to use the pace and the angle to ramp this towards the long leg boundary. But he picks out deep square, a few yards inside. <b>4 for 6</b> this collapse!"

"yorker at leg stump, jammed down to long-on"
"<b>and they get the wicket!</b> Gurney goes around the wicket and bowls a slower ball that slants across from a length on middle and leg. He's down early for the paddle/ramp, probably a good option, but he doesn't account for the slower ball. Has to check the shot and he gets a top edge that lobs up harmlessly for finch at short fine"
"<b>he's picked out deep midwicket!</b> Oh dear, oh dear! That makes it 6 for 15 in 26 balls! Offcutte,r full on leg stump. Leans into it and makes good connection on what is an intentional chip. But the boundary is big there and you need to get the angles absolutely right. He doesn't"

"slower ball at a length on middle stump, shuffles and mistimes slog to deep midwicket's right"
"<b>White takes it at point!</b> And he has no idea what sort of a celebration to pull out. Awkwardly lobs it up. Not sure anyone can comprehend this collapse right now. Bravo has managed to get a leading edge on a leg side full toss. That's what pressure does. Could have tickled it fine, could have clubbed it over midwicket, but it's a swish with the top hand coming off"

"slower ball wide outside off, reaches out and jabs to point"
"full and wide outside off, can't get bat on that"
"<b>close call on the run out here.</b> And a bizzare one if it is out. A slower ball is dragged to deep midwicket's right and his throw is wide. As the keeper looks to retrieve it and take the stumps out, Zampa slides his bat into the keeper's leg. As a result, it doesn't slide into the crease. But his back leg just makes it in as the stumps light up"

"yorker at middle stump, gets behind the line and jams it into the leg side"

"offcutter, a low full toss outside off. Walks into it and chucks the bat at it. Thick inside edge to deep midwicket's right"

"slower ball at a length outside off, shuffles to get behind the line and spanks it flat over the boundary"
"length at the stumps, backs away and swipes to deep midwicket's right"
"<B>inside edge</b> onto toe and that is it for the Stars. Another loss in a final. Slower ball from Christian, swings across the line and can't do more than get this pitch side"
