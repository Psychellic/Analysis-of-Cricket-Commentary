"neatly punched past point. Short of a length and shaping away just outside off. Just has a stab at this after allowing it to come close to him. Head on top of the ball, a last minute opening of the face and it beats third man comfortably to his right"
"122.7kph, length at off stump. Jabs at it from the crease, a bit too hard to get the single at mid-off"
"length at off stump, steps down the track and gets leg side of this. Punches firmly but straight to mid-off"
<b>dropped!</b> Length ball floating into his pads. He flicks aerially. Dasun Shanaka is a couple of yards in from the boundary at deep square leg and takes some more inwards as this is hit towards him. Ends up having to leap to his left and tips it into the boundary
"short of a length and just outside off, chopped to third man"
"<b>oh glorious.</b> A gentle outswinger in the corridor. In this form, that's a throwdown for Rahul. Nice stride out and a flowing drive to beat cover's left"
"and again. Length outside off, leans in and punches between cover and point again. That's 120kph wherabouts. It looked like they had put a sweeper out briefly, but clearly called him back in"
full and hooping in at his pads. Gets it across the stumps and his head is in the off side as he looks to flick. Cops it on the front pad
slower ball sliding in at leg stump. Watchfully tucked to short fine's right with the angle. That was 111kph

"short of a length on middle, punched to long-on off the back foot"
"dropped short outside off, pulled to deep midwicket"
"<b>smoked over deep midwicket!</b> This was on the cards. Hasaranga pushes this at a length wide outside off, sliding on nicely and he makes a lot of swinging room with the front leg in the leg side. A brute of a slog sweep"

"tossed up on middle, swept along the ground to deep square leg"
"top edges the reverse sweep, but he had picked his shot wisely because there was no third man, so it landed safely. Dhawan set himself up for the reverse hit early"
"<b>swept hard but straight to deep midwicket</b>. Dhawan was looking good after initial jitters, so he'll be unhappy with that. Struck the sweep well enough, but didn't place it well. Tossed up on off, didn't quite get it off the middle, more towards the end of the bat and Sri Lanka have a breakthrough"
"<b>first ball six!</b>. He leaned into the off-drive and seemed to have not hit it very hard, but he finished with a flourish and the ball carried all the way over long-off"
"drags it down short, but it keeps a bit low. Rahul goes back and across and uses his wrists to whip through midwicket"
"fired in on the pads, worked to long-on's right"
"<b>plumb in front</b> and Samson won't review. He's walking off. Googly on a length outside off, and he didn't read it at all, played down the wrong line. The ball strikes pad, in line with off. That was hitting the stumps. Six and out for Samson."
"tossed up full on off, driven on the front foot to long-off"
"drags it down short and Rahul pounces. Rocks back and pulls this from low down, hard and in control, through midwicket"
"good length, floated up on off, he takes a big stride to meet it and strokes it through cover"
superb placement and great effort by the man running to his left from square leg. Rahul spotted this one full and swept it fine. Didn't get a boundary but will raise a fine <b>fifty</b>.
<b>smoked</b>. Low full toss on off and he absolutely uncorked on it. Pandey had to duck quickly because otherwise it would have taken his head off. Straight into the boundary
"<b>beautifully bowled</b> and I think Rahul's in trouble here. And yes, he's not got his foot back in time, so he'll be out stumped. Nicely tossed up googly, that dragged him forward to drive. Was bowled wider of off too, and Rahul beaten all ends up, cannot connect. The bails are off in a flash and he didn't have enough time to drag his back foot back over the line"
"another googly, but wide of off and spinning away, gives Iyer the room to go on the back foot and cut this through point"
"<b>another one goes down!</b> India are crumbling after a rollicking start. Wristspin winning the day. Sandakan once again follows a bad ball with a very good one, slows it through the air and bowls with an enticing loop. Iyer is looking to punch down the ground, way too early into the shot and ends up popping it back for the easiest of return catches."

"fuller on the stumps, flicked off his pads to wide long-on"
"too full outside off and a nice sound as Pandey cracks this through extra cover, giving himself a bit of room"

"too short and punished. Kohli saw the length, went deep in his crease and uncorked a fierce pull between long-on and midwicket"

"full on middle, driven to long-on"
"length ball on leg stump, tapped gently to short fine leg"
<b>googly skids on and almost has him</b>. But Pandey's penchant for playing late saved him. He hadn't read it but jabbed his bat down in time to get an inside edge onto pad

"length ball on the stumps, Kohli works it to midwicket on the front foot with soft hands. Man is deep so they get two"
"<b>bang</b>. As good a straight drive as you'll see, doesn't matter if he's at 3 or 6. Big stride out to convert this length ball into a fuller one and unleashes a drive with the full face of the bat, sending it all the way over the bowler's head"
"fuller on the pads, flicked to midwicket"
"gets this to swerve into the batsman on a yorker length, he jams his bat down to send it to mid-on's right"
"<b>Kohli special bottom hand whip</b>. Full toss on the pads and those powerful wrists come into play, as does his spatial awareness of where the fielders are to pick the gap behind square perfectly"
"fuller on the stumps, he walks across and flicks this to the same area as the last ball, but this wasn't hit as powerfully so it allows the man at deep square leg to run to his right and put in a sliding stop"
<b>dismissed</b>. Too short and Pandey clears his front leg to swat a pull shot to the midwicket boundary
"full on off, he goes deep in his crease and drives it to long-on's right. The fielder moved quickly and was in position to field"
"<b>suicidal second</b> and Kohli's gone. He was looking supremely in command but there was no need to go for that run when there wasn't one and Kohli is run out by a long way. Fuller on the stumps, he flicked it to deep square leg. There was a fielder there. Kohli was charging down for the second, probably took even Pandey by surprise. The throw was accurate and Kohli is gone"
"<b>upper cuts it straight to third man</b>. digs it in short outside off, Sundar makes decent connection but that's poor placement and third man gobbles it up"
"short ball on off, he stays beside it and chops it to third man"
"he ducks under the bouncer and that's been given a wide. No country for bowlers, is T20 cricket. That was a borderline call. On another day, that would have been a fine bouncer to end the over with."
"fuller on off, punched to mid-off"
<b>slam</b>. That's been dealt with disdainfully. Slower short ball outside off and he just unleashes a baseball style swat over midwicket
"fuller on off, he goes for  a big swipe over cover, gets a leading edge that swirls over mid-off and lands safe"
"lovely shot, goes deep in his crease and drives it straight, showing the full face of the bat. Long on and long off both converging on it and they manage to stop the boundary"
"<b>shot</b>. Manish Pandey's showing his class. He's going very deep, and that allows him to take advantage of this slightly shorter and wider one, cuts it beautifully through backward point"
"gives the bowler the charge but Malinga keeps his length shorter, so Pandey can only flat bat it to long-off"
"yorker on off, but bowled at slower pace. Shardul's dealt with it comfortably enough, using wrists to flick to deep midwicket. Only a single though, so he'll still be on strike"
"gives himself room and comes down the track, hits this full ball hard and straight down the ground, but can't beat long-on running to his left and tumbling to save"
"<b>whoa, that's some hit</b>. Length ball on off, he was clearing his front foot and hit a punch on the up almost. But hit it so well that it just kept flying and went over the straight boundary"
Kumara's bowling the same length and Shardul just gives himself room and swats it nonchalantly over extra cover. He's not letting India feel the absence of Kohli
"full toss on the stumps, bunts it to mid-off"
"<b>boom</b>. Pandey's putting on a mini masterclass. That was a super shot. Dug in short, he transfers weight back and rockets it to the midwicket boundary."
"good ball to finish but dealt with well. Yorker on the stumps, but Pandey goes deep again and punches it straight. They sprint between the wickets to get two and go over 200"
"length on leg stump, flicked down to fine leg. No swing on that"
"short and wide outside off, just a little too much steepness on that and he's beaten on the cut"
short of a length and just outside off. Stays leg side of it and looks to steer this between point and cover. Can't beat Iyer to his left

"length on leg stump, mistimed punch towards mid-on, allows him a single with a quick call"
"yorker down leg side, can't get bat on that"
"<b>dragged straight to mid-on.</b> Poor position for the pull short. This is 141kph, short and rising across him. Feet are rooted, there's no pivot as he makes the connection and he's just too far away from the ball to get it off the middle. Sundar has time to get side on and watch it into his hands"
"short of a length and swung away just outside off, punched to point off the back foot"
"<b>smoked it! Wow.</b> That is a sweet connection. Short of a length on middle stump, absolutely minimal feet on this, but a clean swing across the line to get this slug over the midwicket boundary"
"<b>steered to cover.</b> The same static feet that allowed him room for the previous shot have cost him this time. Short of a length, rising and moving away outside off. Has to reach out and slice at this on the rise. Finds Iyer with precision"
length and swung away in the corridor. Defended cautiously in slip's direction
"<b>beaten.</b> Has a stab at that outswinger. Doesn't look like he knew what was happening there. It curved away from a length outside off, he chased with his hands"
"<b>more nervous prodding.</b> Short of a length and hooping away from him. Thinks of the cut, thinks of withdrawing. Just caught in the middle by the end as this sails through to the keeper"
"full and very wide outside off, left alone"
<b>lifts it past the outside edge.</b> Short of a length and some late swing away from middle and off. Skips and has a poke at this
"length, marginal late movement away in the corridor. Feet rooted to the crease as he stabs this into the covers"
<b>beaten on the hoick.</b> 141.7kph. Short and just outside off. Jumps into the leg side and is too late to connect on that swipe
<b>looks to flick</b> but that ends up rolling towards mid-off. Short of a length and across him. Comes on too quick for him to even manage to close the face. It's off the outside half of the bat
length and swung in at leg stump. Stays tall and flicks. Sundar sprints to his right and gets his body behind this to stop
<b>mean bouncer.</b> It's tough going for Oshada so far. But does well to sway away from this. 141.5kph and lifting dangerously towards the throat. Lets it go
"<b>appeal for lbw while Pandey swoops in from point to take the stumps out.</b> It's a full toss on leg stump, Perera is rapped on the pad as he looks to flick. Doesn't look a bad shout that. In the meantime, he's run down the pitch, possibly doesn't know where the ball is. Oshada doesn't want it but reluctantly goes in the end. Pandey sprints to the stumps and completes the run out"
"length ball outside off, swings away late. Left alone"

"length at off stump, anxiously pushed into the covers as this squares him up a tad"

"short of a length just outside off, pushed to cover's left from the crease"

slower short ball at leg stump. Looks to pull but is through it too quickly. Trickles out to midwicket
"short of a length on leg stump, punched to mid-on's right off the back foot"
<b>hammered to the midwicket boundary.</b> Short at a middle stump line. Mathews is already down the pitch and into the leg side so he was both room and momentum. Gets his weight into that front foot pull
"<b>a repeat against the left-handers!</b> Yorker speared in at middle stump. Perera backs into the leg side and looks to jam his bat down at this. He's got it down alright but down the wrong line. This is past his inside edge and crashes into the stumps, much like the wicket last match of Gunathilaka"
"short and wide outside off, left alone"
"<b>shot!</b> Elegant from DDS. Short of a length and just outside off, quickly onto the back foot which jumps into the off side, connects right under his eyes and opens the face late to get this past point"

"short of a length and just outside off. Another glorious punch off the back foot but can't beat Pandey at point, who feels the sting of this"
"length at off, defended into the covers"

"length on the stumps, he thought it was shorter than it was and was shaping to pull, but adjusted well to play a checked sweep shot to fine leg"

"good comeback, pinpoint yorker on the stumps that he can only defend back to the bowler"
<b>whoa</b>. That's an incredible shot. Flat-batted sweep shot that goes over wide long-on for six. No fielder would have had a chance. The bowler's not giving himself much of a chance by bowling so full either
"<b>caught by Pandey at long-on</b>. Washington invited the big shot again, but this time he floated it up well wide of off, making Mathews fetch the flat-batted sweep. He gets it off the toe-end.

"goes wide of off stump and he'll have to rebowl that. Tight call, that perhaps started within the tram-lines and swung away"

"length in the corridor, defended into the offside"
"<b>direct hit by Chahal at mid-off</b>. This was a yorker gone wrong, ends up as a low full toss. Punched forcefully to mid-off and that is some casual, casual running between the wickets.

"<b>caught at third man</b>. Sri Lanka's last bit of resistance has ended. Good short ball by Sainia, outside off. Dhananjaya wanted to slap it over point, but ends up not middling it and slicing it straight to third man. Was at an awkward height to play that shot"
"low full toss on off, he was clearing his leg to crash it through the offside, gets a thick edge to third man"
"<b>spoons a catch to mid-off</b> and India have won the series 2-0. Another short ball, too well directed for a tailender and too quick also. Malinga wanted to thwack that over cow corner, gets it high on the bat because he's too slow on it and it goes off the toe-end to the fielder there, who happens to be Kohli."
