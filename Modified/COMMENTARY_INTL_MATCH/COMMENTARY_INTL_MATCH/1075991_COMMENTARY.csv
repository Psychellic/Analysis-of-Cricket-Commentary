"fires this flat on middle from around the stumps, punched to cover"
"gives him the charge! Steps out, gets underneath the flight and lofts him over mid-on. Crisp hit"
"drifting into middle and leg, worked to mid-on for a quick single"
gets back into the crease and defends to the leg side
"shaped to sweep but changed his stroke in the end, dabbed to the off side"
"see you later, Baz. The plan of starting with left-arm spin, which McCullum said was a challenge at the toss, has worked. Looks to pull, but this wasn't all that short, and so he couldn't get much power on the stroke and Malan took the simplest of catches at deep midwicket."
walks across the stumps and flicks the leg-stump half-volley to the fine leg boundary. Easy pickings
"full-length delivery outside off, thumped to mid-off. Looked to go over"
"another one bites the dust. Yesterday's half-centurion is gone. Steps out to go over mid-off but hits it flat to Jordan there. He times his jump well to complete a straightforward catch. Trouble for Lahore, joy for Hasan Ali."
beauty! Nips away late to beat him on a forward push
gets on top of the bounce and punches the short of length delivery to point
"what is happening there? Let's get a selfie says skipper Sammy. This is an outstanding catch by Hafeez at second slip. Umar Akmal chases a wide delivery, but can only manage a thick edge. The ball flew, make no mistake, and Hafeez moved swiftly to his left to complete a tumbling catch. Second duck in three innings for Umar Akmal"
"wickets have fallen, so what? Zaman steps out and whips him into the midwicket boundary."
gets forward and bunts the in-drifter to the off side
"biffed into the wide long-on boundary. That sounded really sweet as he made contact. Advanced down the track and met the ball on the half-volley. Power of his swing did the rest. Long, long way back into the stands"
worked with the angle to long-on as they jog the single
nearly a leading edge back to Hafeez. Looks to work it with the spin to the leg side
steps out and turns it with the spin to short midwicket this time
"full and angling away, he gets forward and thrashes this into the gap at cover."
"swung away to the leg side, Jordan from mid-on hares across to pull that  back in near the deep midwicket boundary"
"what was all the fuss about? We saw a decision yesterday too, where Sanga wasn't sure if he took it cleanly, but was given out. Sammy wasn't sure if his fingers were completely underneath the ball, but it turns out that he actually has taken it cleanly. Back of a length delivery that jags away from off stump, Elliott hangs his bat out and gets a thick edge into Sammy's bucket hands at slip."
"he's moving it both ways. This one comes back in from outside off, Rizwan shoulders arms"
"there's some fizz on this length ball outside off, the probing length again, he shoulders arms"
"moves away off the seam from outside off again, left alone. Cracking over"
whips a length ball on the pads to the deep midwicket region
"not much room this time, bunts the away-going length ball to the off side"
"extra bounce, this one gets him high on the thigh pad as he looks to whip it off his hip"
"one bounce into the deep midwicket boundary. Zaman, you beauty. Pitched up on the pads, free swing of the arms as he lets the bottom hand take over. Walloped."
"slants this across the batsman, who watches it through to Akmal"
leg-stump half-volley hat has been worked into the gap between deep midwicket and long-on
"looks to pull this to Abu Dhabi or somewhere, but swung too early. It was short and the stroke was on. Hasan's pace too good for Rizwan"
"play and a miss. Looks to steer it down to third man with an angled bat, the ball deviates late"
"just manages to clear Jordan at mid-on. Sashays down the pitch and pulls, was cramped for room but went through with the stroke. Intent very clear"
biffed into the square leg. Swivels back and slaps it with gay abandon. What's worse? It's a no-ball. Free-hit coming up.
"thumped down the ground but not timed as well as he would have liked, Jordan running backwards from mid-off, covered 20 yards or so and then dived full length to get his hands on the ball but couldn't hold on. Outstanding effort, but wouldn't have mattered anyway"
bunts a length ball to point
uses the pace of the bowler to run this down to third man
"skiddy length ball angled across, chopped to point"
"his game was bordering on the thin line between being aggressive and over-aggressive, and has paid the price for it. Nowhere near the pitch of the ball as he looks to go over mid-off to slices it to Morgan who comes running in from deep cover, keeps his eyes on the ball and judges the catch to perfection. It was swirling around for a while, but Morgan made it look easy."
turns a length delivery on middle and leg to short midwicket
"aims at Narine's ribs, loses control. Floats a length ball down leg"
"caught on the back foot to a full delivery, bunts this to point for a quick single"
works a length ball to the leg side for a quick single
"hustled for pace with a short ball, Narine looks to whip but miscues. Fortunately on the bounce to deep fine leg"
brain freeze. Nothing else can describe what we're seeing. Looks to smash Hafeez into the stands at long-on but can only pick out Jordan in the deep. Why would you want to do that when you're already five down with 13 overs to play? Inexplicable
"tossed up on middle and leg, pushed to short midwicket"
bunts an in-drifter to the leg side
gets forward and eases a full delivery back with the spin to Hafeez
"full delivery on middle and off, punched to mid-off"

"short of length delivery outside off, pushed off the back foot to cover"
opens his wrists late to steer this to backward point
beaten by a beauty! This one jags away off the seam to beat him on a forceful drive. Looked to play him on the up
"squared up by the length, but somehow manages to get some bat on it. Point comes in quickly to prevent the run"
"this is self-destruction at it's very best. Six down, plenty of overs left. Why would you try to hit it to mid-on and take a run as risky as that? Tanvir was deep inside his crease as he played that short-arm jab. And so he had just that much more ground to cover. Took off late and in the end had given up as the throw hit the stumps direct at the bowler's end. He also made the stupid mistake of running diagonally, which isn't obviously the best way to."
thick edge and past the slip fielder. Third man vacant and so this is a welcome boundary
"fires in a full ball from wide of the crease, defended to the off side"
"short, wide. Cut away to deep point"
"width outside off, steered to Sammy at backward point"
turned with the spin to square leg
beaten by the fizz. This one spins away sharply to beat his forward push. 92kph
"dragged on! This one was fired in at length, Bhatti goes onto the back foot to whip this away but gets into an awkward tangle. Plays all around it as the ball deflects off his pad back onto the stumps."
"superb catch by Kamran Akmal moving to his left! This is too full for him to ease it behind point, gets a thick edge which Akmal anticipates early and dives to complete the catch."
"all over. Short ball has done the trick. This was coming back in at some pace. Too late on the pull, gets a glove which Kamran Akmal accepts gleefully. <b> This is the lowest score in PSL's short history. </b> Look of disbelief in the Lahore camp. Happened all too quickly. Why? Brain freeze. Too many batsmen came out playing million dollar strokes when the need of the situation was to bide time and play out the overs."
"off the mark in PSL 2017. Gift of a full toss on the leg side, punched to long-on"
"purchase off the pitch. Squared up by turn and bounce, defended off the back foot to the off side"
"on the pads, whipped to deep square as they jog the single"
gets forward and turns the incoming delivery to short midwicket
makes a bit of room and cuts it straight to point
"this one swerves back in from length outside off, worked to midwicket"
"slants this full and across Hafeez, who is half-forward as he defends"
"slower and fuller delivery on middle, Hafeez plants forward and defends with the full face of the bat"
"steps out to smash this over mid-on but is beaten by the late away movement. Why Hafeez, why?"
hit high on the thigh pad as he plays all around a length ball on middle. Woefully out of touch
"too full on middle and leg, nurdled to deep square leg"
"down the track and across the line a little too much as he looks to flick, but the ball swings back in a long way from outside off. Looks like it hit him on middle and leg. The ball still had some distance to travel but Aleem Dar felt it would have hit the stumps."
play and a miss. Shaped to play for the turn but this went straight on
"got him, got him. Ripper from Narine. Hafeez completely foxed by the turn. Played for one that goes away, this one sneaked through the big gap between bat and pad. Simplest of stumpings for Rizwan. What's happening here? Hello! Hafeez's dreadful run of form continues"
floats a slider across Morgan who lets it go
"I really don't know how this missed the off stump. Ripper. Squares Morgan up, he plays inside the line."
"beaten again! Tentative again, clueless in defense, played for the one that comes in maybe, this one went away to miss the edge."
"touch too short on middle and leg, worked wide of midwicket"
"crunching cover drive. Touch too full, Morgan presses forward and eases that on the up. Well done by Irfan, who pulled it back in"
dabs a length delivery on off to point
"angles a length ball into middle and leg, tucked wide of midwicket"
toe-ends an attempted drive down the ground to mid-on
"slants a back of length delivery on off stump, punched to mid-off"
"this one hits him high on the bat, and so there isn't much power on the drive, straight to cover."
gets a long way forward to smother the spin
"touch short but this skids on, Morgan bunts it to the off side"
"chipped into the leg side, deep midwicket comes in to keep it to a single"
"gets across the stumps and punches a short ball to cover, again"
"seam-up that swerved in and then jagged off the seam, defended back down the pitch"
"room, but he fails to make full use of it. Cuts it straight to short third man"
"angles a full delivery across Morgan, hint of movement away too, left alone"
"third man was in business, but he ran in a little too much and then saw the ball sail over. Narine would have gobbled it up had he been on the boundary. Opportunity missed. Poor cricket."
crashes the short ball to Narine at third man
"yorker length delivery on middle, squeezed behind the wicket, the slip fielder comes in and has a shy at the stumps at the bowler's end, misses"
"indecision from Morgan, looked to dab it gently and pinch a run but was sent back. He turned late but got in full stretch. Umar Akmal, coming in from point, anticipated early and under-armed the flick to the stumps at the striker's end. All the good work for nothing"
steps out and wallops the length ball over mid-on. Didn't get to the pitch of the ball but went through with the stroke. The confidence of a man who made 80 in the previous game
""
"flayed over the infield, on the bounce to third man"
was he looking to test the bounce off the surface? This is way over Morgan's head. Rightly called wide
"short of length delivery on middle and leg, nudged into the gap at midwicket"
"looked to hit this too hard through cover, rolled off a thick inside edge back towards the bowler"
"back of length delivery outside off, bunted to point"
drops it gently into the off side as they complete a quick single
""
"excellent catch coming in from deep cover. Qalandars making Zalmi fight for every run. Kamran lofts it up and over the infield, but couldn't generate the kind of power he would have liked. It wasn't a chip, neither was it a full-blooded stroke. Poor from a seasoned campaigner."
gets forward and blocks
would you believe it? He's defended a tossed up delivery gently to the off side
whipped wide of midwicket
"flatter delivery on the pads, worked behind square on the leg side as they jog the single"
"drifting into middle and leg, he gets forward and deadbats that"
"edged but safe. Lucky, though, to get a boundary as the gully fielder dives over the ball. Late movement troubling Morgan"
gets forward and defends gently the length ball to the off side
"leans into the drive and eases it to cover, sensible"
"short outside off, he looked to help it over the slip cordon but the ball bounced a little more than Afridi would have liked"
there was some sound as the length ball snaked down leg. Afridi flicked and missed. Good take by Rizwan
"angles a length ball into middle and leg, whipped to deep square. Wanted the second but the fielder anticipated that early and swooped in quickly"
"looks to pull, ball thuds into the bat because of the pace. Impact makes bat face turn in Morgan's hand, rolls to mid-off"
play and a miss. Looked to cut but was beaten by the fizz
"have you ever seen Afridi try to drop and run in recent times? That's what he tries to do, but point comes in quickly to prevent that"

"width outside off, he cuts but straight to point again"
"big heave to the leg side, except he connected with the humid Dubai air. Deceived him flight"
"pushed through quicker on leg stump, he's back into the crease as he defends"
"gentle push wide of cover for a quick single, looked up, mere eye contact and off they went"
"short, wide and walloped into the point boundary. Much-needed for Afridi, he was edgy"
"this has been walloped down town. Didn't get to the pitch of it but went through with the stroke. Pure muscle, just eludes long-on"
what does he do next? Shows he can defend solidly too
"he's hit this towards the longer boundary, where Elliott takes a simple catch at deep midwicket. His daughters didn't approve of the shot. Once again didn't get to the pitch of the ball and ended up dragging it leg dside."
driven with the spin to extra cover
one-handed stop by McCullum at cover point. Flung himself to the left to stop that
"drifts in a flat delivery from wide of the crease, defended with soft hands"
"ripper of a catch from the skipper. There's life in this contest yet? The dip has got him the wicket. Maqsood was through with a booming drive, but didn't account for the turn, neither did he get to the pitch of the ball and simply chipped it to the off side where superman in the form of McCullum dived full length to his left to pluck a one-handed stunner"
"touch short, Sammy rocks back and steers this wide of point to get off the mark"
"Aleem Dar thought long, hard, really hard. Even harder. And then raised his finger. This delivery was full, spun back in to beat Morgan's push and hit him on the pad. The ball deflected to short leg. The only question was if it would have missed the stumps, but it looks like Aleem has give him caught. Snicko showed nothing."
"not all that short for him to cut, beaten"
"yorker-length delivery outside off, squeezed to point"
"width again, bunted to deep point"
"length ball outside off, high backlift on the defense"
hops across the stumps and whips the length ball to midwicket

pushed back to the bowler
"tossed up on off, Sammy stretches forward and blocks"
played outside the line and is lucky to get some bat on it as he defends
"you beauty! The wrong'un was coming, Sammy was completely foxed as he shaped to drive, played outside the line, got a big inside edge that deflected off the boot and onto the middle stump. Yasir does a Tahir, takes off on a 100-metre dash. What is happening here? <b> If ever there was a manual on how not to approach a modest chase, this is it. </b>"
"out, surely? Big, big, big appeal. The ball drifted in full from wide of the crease, went for a sweep and was struck on the back pad. Aleem Dar didn't think it straightened enough. Proved right by Hawkeye"
thumped on the up to deep cover
gets on top of the bounce and bunts an incoming length delivery
"hustled for pace. Skiddy, straight and hits him on the elbow as he looks to defend off the back foot"
"too short and way over the batsman's head, thinks square leg umpire Aleem Dar. Fair call. Little too high"
"once again it's too quick for him to play a short-arm jab, hit high on the body."
"looks to wallop this across the line, struck on the pad but umpire Illingworth is firm. Was missing leg stump"
hit high on the thigh pad again. Looks to go back deep into the crease to whip it away

"poor delivery first up, too full but down leg. He looks to paddle and misses. That's one run struck off the five they needed"
stretches forward and defends the full delivery
swung across the line to long-on
looks for a single but is sent back. Backward square leg swooped in on the ball very quickly
"width outside off, punched to cover. There's a direct hit at the bowler's end but the non-striker was in. What awareness from McCullum"
too late to pick up and release. McCullum not happy with the effort at short fine leg
"<B> game, set and match. </b> Too full outside off, he squeezes this into the gap between point and short third man. Hardly any smiles in the Zalmi camp. Relief more than elation. They've been made to earn this win courtesy some aggressive captaincy from McCullum backed up by some outstanding bowling, especially from Yasir Shah"
