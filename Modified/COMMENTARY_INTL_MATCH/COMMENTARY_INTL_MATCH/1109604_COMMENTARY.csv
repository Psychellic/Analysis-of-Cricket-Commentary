"a loosener, in terms of pace. 130 kph. Full outside off, Saha gets forward and defends into his pad"
"shortish and wide, Saha stays in his crease and punches gracefully through extra cover for a couple. The deep point is more towards deep backward point, so plenty of ground to cover"
"Saha finds gully. Not the greatest ball, but they don't care. Good length delivery outside off, Saha looks to use the pace on the ball and deflect it past gully. But he can't keep it down nor find the gap. Dilruwan takes a sharp catch at gully, to his right. The fielder may have been just a touch forward to cut off the angle. That would have meant that if the ball came to him, it would be at a decent pace, but Vishwa's medium pace ensured it wasn't as tough a catch as it should have been."
"yikes, that's awful shot selection. Full outside off, Kuldeep gets his pad right outside off and looks to tuck that through square leg. Struck on the pad just outside off. Actually, Kuldeep seems to have hit his pad. The ball went straight through"

"back of a length on leg, nudged to fine leg"

"after bowling too full, he drags the length back on this and gets a thick outside edge. Given, by umpire Illingworth. Kuldeep reviews inexplicably, but he has got a thick outside edge. A big spike on UltraEdge. Dickwella follows the ball and takes a good catch. That wicket is down to the length - left Kuldeep wondering whether to come forward or go back - and a little bit of spin - not too much to beat the edge"
Pandya will look to attack now. Gets low and nails a sweep to deep midwicket. Takes the single

"clears long-on. Sandakan sees Pandya coming so fires a wide googly, but even though Pandya has far from middled that, he still clears long-on, who got around to his left"

"another short and wide googly, this one beats Pandya's cut. A fifty was there"
"flat and straight, pushed back to the bowler"
steps out and drills a drive to long-off. Shami very hands too
pushes this to long-off for a run and <strong>gets to his fifty.</strong> Brings out the 2-2 Dhawan celebration in jest.
"flat and straight, quite full too. Blocked"
"that was close. Chandimal looks around and chooses not to review. That was definitely worth it, in my opinion. An inside edge actually. Flat and straight. Good call from Sri Lanka and umpire Tucker."
"pushed away to the sweeper cover, another easy single for the No. 10"
"82 kph, outside off, under-edged to slip"
"and another one. Tossed up outside off, Shami looks to hit that through mid-off, but the ball takes the inside half of the bat and skews back to the bowler. Sandakan takes an easy reverse-cupped catch off his own bowling."
"shortish and wide outside off, sliced away to deep point"
"a googly down leg, swept to deep backward square leg. Pandya refuses the run"
that's why he refused it. Comes down and hits that googly with the spin over long-off. His power did the rest. Fantastic execution
a googly that is far too wide for Test match legality. Called
worked away to deep midwicket for one. That is the more easiest last-ball single I've seen
"hammered for four through midwicket. Flat and straight, swept powerfully to deep midwicket. Great stroke"
powered for four more. Hurtling across now. Runs down and smashes that past the bowler. Pushpakumara belatedly gets his hand close but the ball goes past easily. Four to long-off
"4, 4, 6. Flight on off, Pandya comes down and lofts that easily over long-off. Just clean striking. These are big runs in the context of the game"
"4, 4, 6, 6. The benefits of T20 cricket. India get to 450. Shimmies down and hammers a flat six to long-off. Flat and straight. Sensational striking. Pushpakumara going over the wicket doesn't help"
six more. Where has this guy been in Test cricket. Comes down and blitzes this over long-on. Fantastic hitting technique this
he has missed an easy flick through midwicket. Wow. A leg side delivery on the pads and somehow Pandya misses that. I'm willing to bet that may have been six if he wanted to go after that
"good stop by cover. Tossed up outside off, drilled to cover's left"
"big bat-pad gap and the ball goes through. Full outside off, goes between that gap. Just one bye, even though it almost made the boundary"
a wide? Sees Pandya coming and fires a googly well outside off. Wide called.

"flat on middle, hammered to deep midwicket for a single. That's just too easy."
"back of a length on leg, defended. Wild cheers from the crowd. Pandya will be looking for those twos. A chance of a run-out"
"another six. Gets inside the line of this, gets underneath the bouncer and pulls over backward square leg. Moves to 90. Again, that's just tremendous hitting technique. T20 style cricket changing a Test match"
"fullish delivery on off, thick inside edge onto the pad"
"full delivery outside off, pushed to long-off. Still says no"
"good bowling. Sees Pandya moving across and bowls this on leg stump. Pandya though is in fine form, won't miss that flick to fine leg for one"
"a low full toss on leg, pushed to mid-on. Umesh's bat breaks, a big wide crack through the middle. Not quite the equipment Kumara was hoping to break. Something better than nothing, I suppose."
"slow outside off, Pandya lets this one go."
"a wide googly outside off, another wide."
"another googly outside off, smashed to deep cover"
"another googly outside off, under-edged through the keeper's legs. Slip cleans up"
"that's way over midwicket. He was waiting for that, a ball in his slot. He gets low and hammers that easily over midwicket for six. A googly. He may or may not have picked that, but if it's that full, it's easy"
"just bunts a ball through extra cover and calls for two, gets it easy"
"80 kph, another wide. India upto 476. A googly that is far too wide outside off"
"flat and straight, looks for one to long-on, but Sandakan gets across to his right and stops the ball. Good stuff"
"143 kph, full and straight, pushed back to the bowler who parries it away. Umesh wants one, Pandya doesn't. There was no run there. Good stuff from Pandya"
"a yorker on middle and leg, kept out."
"a short slow bouncer outside off that is watched away. Not a bad option, but awful execution. Have to make Umesh duck or sway"
"full and wide outside off, pushed away to point's right. Enough time for one"
"gets past and Pandya makes his <b>first international century</b>. Full and straight, pushed back towards mid-on, who dives valiantly to his left. The 2-2 celebration. What a fine effort this has been."
"a good bouncer on leg, but Pandya stays underneath the length and ramps it over the keeper. This is simple batting, on the merit, but match-changing. Sri Lanka, it seems, have no answers or plans"
"tossed up outside off, driven back towards cover"
"the googly outside off, pitches outside off and beats the bat. Well bowled"
"flight outside off, defended away"
another googly outside off beats the bat
"75 kph, full and straight, defended. Good defensive technique"
gets right forward to defend that. Well done Umesh Yadav. Used his long reach to smother the spin
"125 kph, a bouncer on leg that is far too high for legality. Another extra"
"slower ball on off, 71 mph, defended"
a low full toss is hit to long-off but Pandya's secure at the striker's end.
"an offcutter outside off, Pandya picks this early and leaves. He moved his delivery position so early that I picked the offcutter before release"
"a short bouncer down leg, 81 mph. Pandya gets underneath that"
"an offcutter outside off, another leave"
"full outside off, blocked to cover for a run."
"overpitched outside off, drilled to long-off"
"flat and wide outside off, Pandya doesn't change his batting stance at all"
"and taken. The first over after lunch. A googly outside off, Pandya looks to go over long-off, but the googly takes the ball away from the bat. Skewed off the outside half of the bat, sliced away to the deep cover fielder. That's a five-for for Sandakan, a fine effort from the left-arm wristspinner. The break has done for Pandya."
starts with a well-directed bouncer that forces Karunaratne to duck. Saha flies away to his right.
"good length delivery, swerving back in. Defended, eyes on the ball, head over it"
"more movement. Inside-edged into the pad. Full outside off, but substantial in-shape"
"good length and very wide outside off, no trouble in leaving that"
on the hips and Karunaratne flicks through backward square leg for a couple. Played that nicely
"phew, good leave. Full delivery outside off, movement back in. Karunaratne leaves. Saha takes it low to his right."
"good length outside off, left alone. 134 kph."
"134 kph, good length outside off, pushed to cover for a run. A nice punch"
"far too wide outside off, even though the length is full. Left alone."
"full outside off, better line and length with the new ball. Karunaratne drives to mid-off with the full face. Kohli dives to his left."
"134 kph, one of the better shots of the day. Tharanga presses forward and just times the pants off his cover drive. No cover in place. Elegant, holds the pose too"
"wides, five. Full and very wide outside off, that was angled away actually. Bounces in front of Saha. Seen wider ones not called."
"fantastic end. Fuller than good length on off, blocked back."
"good length outside off, left alone"
"full and straight, nudged with the angle to square leg. Kuldeep misfields and allows one. Poor fielding"
"edged and taken! Tharanga nicks off. <strong>And reviews it.</strong> I'm not sure what's happening with these reviews, why would he chat with his partner and then review? It's another absolutely awful review. Shami gets this to come back in, but the key is that it didn't swing as much as the previous ones. Tharanga played for more swing than there was and got a thin edge. Saha dives away to his right and takes a good catch. But that's just awful cricket post the event from Tharanga. A terrible mis-use of the system, and should be held wholly accountable if a middle-order player gets a howler. A big noise too."
"excellent use of the short ball, quick and straight. Mendis gets under that awkwardly"
"lovely. 144 kph, quick, and extra zip off the surface with the new ball. Another bouncer outside off, Mendis somehow avoids that, eyes off the ball."
"back of a length on off, defended well enough this time"
"<strong>out with a direct hit?</strong> Mendis turned slowly. Good length outside off, defended to point. Karunaratne says 'no, no, no, no'. Mendis turns in a circle almost. A direct hit would have had Mendis."
"off the pad to fine leg. Good length down leg, beaten for pace. There's some zip on this surface"
"ah, terrific shot. On a length but on the thigh, and Kusal says keep it there. Flicks through backward square leg with a nice deflection off his pads."
"full and straight, the ball seams back in after pitching and hits Mendis in front of leg, but sliding down leg."
"133 kph, too straight from Umesh. Mendis flicks away in front of midwicket this time. A slow outfield but great timing. Four more"
"movement. That's a better place to start if you're getting inswing. Slightly outside off, a thick inside edge into the body."
"fullish delivery outside off, 145 kph. Keeps a tad low. Karunaratne defends. Nice length from Shami"
"comes back in. Good length around off, inside-edged into the body again."
"terrific bowling this. Full again outside off, Karunaratne plays for some swing - like he has been doing through the innings - but this one doesn't move as much. So similar to the Tharanga dismissal. A thick outside edge and taken by Saha. Exceptional bowling. Not sure you can control the amount of swing you get, but he has done Karunaratne in with that length and plenty of doubt. At least, there's no review this time. They check the validity of the delivery - a legal front-foot delivery - and the catch - that's legal too, carried comfortably"
"there is that short delivery outside off, this is mis-directed. Way outside off, left alone"
"142 kph, terrific bowling. Fullish delivery around off, nips back in and hits Chandimal on the back thigh. An appeal is withdrawn. Just a touch high but closer than i initially thought. Over the stumps, says HawkEye"
"full delivery outside off, this one seams away. Chandimal defends"
"that's closer. Still a touch high? But <strong>Kohli reviews.</strong> Fuller than a good length on off, moves back in again, beats Chandimal on the inside edge and hits him on the back thigh. No bat. Umpire's call on height after two reds. Not a howler of a review. Another sensational over from Shami"
"good length outside off, moving away, 142 kph, carved to point. Umesh has to keep his line there, and let variable movement do its thing"
"full delivery outside off, defended"
"lovely bowling. Full delivery outside off - a set of stumps outside off - Mendis plays the line and is beaten by a mile. Actually, that's a good leave"
"good length outside off, defended to cover. Much better channel from Umesh, maybe a few inches fuller keeps Mendis' footwork indecisive"
"well bowled. Pushes Mendis back with a short ball, ducks"
"superb shot. On the pads after five good balls and Mendis flicks aerially, and safely over square leg."
"full delivery outside off, left alone. Good leave"
"terrific bowling again. Full delivery, moving away late, a thick outside edge dies in front of Kohli at third slip. Good stop"
"full but far too wide, left alone, 137 kph"
"145 kph, full and straight, blocked"
"lovely stop from mid-off. Full and wide outside off, driven towards Pandya at mid-off, who sprints to his right to save four."
"sublime lines. Making Chandimal play, full and straight, blocked"
"good length around off, 84 mph, looking for that top of off line. Blocked"
"that's not a bad ball, but Mendis' wrists take that through square leg. Full and straight, Mendis takes the risk of using as less of the bat as possible, as opposed to a straight bat. High risk, high reward"
"full and wide outside off, 136 kph, left alone"
"on the pads, clips to square leg."
"136 kph, good length outside off, pushed to cover for a nice run."
"around off at 134 kph, kept out."
"good length on middle and off, 88 mph, flicked through square leg. Those wrists again"
"outside off on a length, defended towards point"
"superb shot but don't mind that Shami. Overpitched slightly outside off, a sublime straight drive with the full face through mid-off. Waited for one closer to him"
"drags his length back, good length outside off, defended to cover"
"what happened there? Firstly, that's terrific stuff from Ashwin. Full and straight on middle and leg, flicked to mid-on's left. Ashwin dives to his right, gets up and throws at the non-striker's end even though Mendis is halfway down. Chandimal, aware of the stop, sends his partner back too late. Mendis turns back to see Ashwin's throw miss the stumps at the non-striker's end. He thinks he's safe and labours back, but Kuldeep Yadav is backing up closely at short cover. Picks up and throws the stumps down at the bowler's end. Mendis is still short. In all this time, Shami has no idea what's going on after the throw evades him. There was a slip too from Mendis."
"138 kph, good length delivery outside off, a hint of away seam movement and the ball beats the bat. Sensational bowling"
"full and straight, defended easily by Mathews."
"attacking the stumps, full and straight, defended"
"and another one. 135 kph, this time from Pandya. Full and straight from the bowler, this one seams back in and beats Mathews' inside edge. That may or may not have been sliding down leg, but Mathews can't even consider reviewing because of Tharanga's review. He walks off. Just a little bit of seam movement doing for Sri Lanka. India have done well to make the batsmen play, the variable bounce and movement (off the pitch, off the seam or off the hand) is doing the rest. All reds on HawkEye."
"full and straight, towards off, defended. No feet movement. India's spinners haven't been needed yet"
"nicely hit. Full and wide outside off, overpitched, and Dickwella lays into a crisp cover drive"
"full and straight, a thick inside edge into the pad."
"back of a length outside off, dabbed backward of point for a late run. 'No' followed by 'yea'. Rahul throws at the batsman's end and concedes an overthrow"
"140 kph, full and close to off, Chandimal gets forward to prop a defensive stroke to point"
"good length outside off, left alone, 141 kph"
"full and wide outside off, driven to the left of mid-off for a quick single"
another neat cover drive earns Dickwella three. No movement there. This should be Shami's last over of the spell too
"143 kph, overpitched outside off, driven upto mid-off"
strays down leg for an ODI wide
"there is that hard length, a bouncer-ish delivery on off, Dickwella sways out of the line comfortably"
"did it pitch in line? No, says Rod Tucker. India don't bother reviewing. Full on leg, Dickwella misses a flick and is struck right in front. Two definite reds in a would-be HawkEye. Yes, pitched well outside leg"
"good length outside off, defended to point"
drifts down leg again for another ODI wide
"good length on off, defended to cover. Good over from Pandya"
"full outside off, no spin, defended"
"slow on middle, full again, inside-edged to short leg"
"looks for the sweep, pitched well outside ;leg, Chandimal misses a sweep and is struck on the pad, eliciting an optimistic appeal"
"flat down leg, swept away to the deep backward square leg boundary. I'd definitely have a deep backward square leg as a catching position even, a few feet in front of the boundary"
pushed to mid-on for a quick single.
"uses his feet this time, gets to the pitch and drives to wide mid-off for one."
comes down and drives to mid-off neatly
"the sweep, well in front of square this time. Full enough to keep Ashwin interested of going under the bat, but clean connection"
"flat on off, drifts on with the arm, a thick inside edge towards midwicket. Well bowled"
"more Moeen Ali-type drift, flat outside off, moves on with the arm, defended to cover with bat and pad close together, defended to cover"
"fullish and straight, Dickwella goes back to something he should have been forward to. Awkwardly defended"
a thick inside edge through square leg for a single.
"the googly on middle and leg, Dickwella does not pick that, goes back to cut, chopped to point"
"just short of midwicket. Flight down leg, Dickwella runs down and flicks aerially"
"plenty of turn. Flat and wide outside off, sliced away towards point. Something always happening when wristspinners are bowling"
"quick on leg, 83 kph, pushed back to the bowler"
"<strong>does him in with an absolute gem</strong>. Chandimal did not read that at all, it was <strong>too full to read him off the pitch</strong>. The googly on off, beats him all ends up"
"another nice delivery. Quick on leg, awkwardly played into the off side"
"good length outside off, punched to deep point"
"full outside off, pushed away towards extra cover."
"full delivery outside off, 132 kph, driven to a shortish cover"
"good length outside off, too wide to draw a stroke from Chandimal"
"nicely hit through extra cover. Good length outside off, crashed away through cover off the back foot. A slap"
"well bowled. Full and wide outside off, 136 kph. Chandimal looks for an exuberant drive through cover, no connection."
"tossed up on off, defended to mid-off. 80 kph."
"there is the first. Flight outside off, Dickwella gets low and creams his slog sweep over midwicket. Got underneath that enough"
pushed to mid-off for a quick single. Good batting from Dickwella
"a googly on leg, this is short enough for Chandimal to go back, read him off the pitch and defend"
"slowish and full on leg, defended"
"full outside off, spinning back in. Easily defended to mid-off"
"good length on middle and leg, shovelled towards midwicket for a quick single. Dickwella doing this nicely"
"good length on middle and leg, easily worked through square leg for a couple. Seems the ball has lost its zip as it has got older. Or Pandya's pace isn't as high as normal"
"good length outside off, left alone"
"138 kph, on a length outside off, defended towards cover"
"full around off, Chandimal plays the ball slightly early and the ball slices off the outside half to deep point"
"good length outside off, 135 kph, dabbed to point"
"that's a poor delivery and put away. Short and wide outside off, Chandimal goes back and hammers his slap through cover. Easy"
"four more. This is overly full outside off, Chandimal lets the ball come close before dishing out a well-timed drive through cover. Two bad lengths from Kuldeep to start - had to be somewhere in between"
"fullish and straight, played away into the leg side"
"too full again and four more. Overly full outside off, Chandimal laces another powerful drive through mid-off."
pushed away to mid-on
"the googly, on middle, sliced to point"
"too straight from Pandya again, flicked through square leg for a couple. The fifty partnership between these two"
"good length on off, defended back"
"good length delivery outside off, defended away to deep point. Met the ball at the right time to get one"
"smashed over mid-on. Full on off, Dickwella stays in his crease and lifts the ball easily over mid-on. Wow, fantastic ball-striking. Counter-attacking cricket"
"138 kph, an easy single. Full outside off, pushed to cover. Pandya comes in Dickwella's way as he completes the run. Pandya ain't too happy, nor is Dickwella"
"short and wide outside off, slashed to deep cover. Umesh makes contact with the boundary and the ball at the same point, at the boundary. Another boundary"
"floated up on leg stump, hint of turn, Dickwella sits back and works the ball defensively to midwicket"
"slower and fuller on middle, a sweep-happy Dickwella secures a single to fine leg. Paddled away. <strong>SL bring up 100 in 21 overs</strong>. Kohli had called it a high-risk shot. It looks good when it comes off"
"And it looks ugly when it doesn't come off. Dickwella ventures another high-risk shot and sees himself get stumped! Looped up higher - this is the googly - Dickwella forays down the track and aims to launch it down the ground or possibly over the leg side. The ball breaks back in with bounce, sneaks through the gate, Saha moves nimbly to his right and whips the bails off without any fuss"
pushed through and sliding across the crease-bound prod of Perera
"lobbed up, really full on off, this time Perera presses forward and smothers it back to Kuldeep"
"even fuller on the legs, clipped away straight to short midwicket"
"good length and holds its line in the channel, Chandimal does not go after it"
"he hits 140ks and finds seam movement! Back of a length and swerves in, hunting for the top of off, Chandimal's bat intervenes"
"speared fuller on a fifth-stump line, Chandimal covers his off stump carefully and lets it go"
"even fuller and keeps low in the channel, left alone again. Saha endures an unkind bounce and believe it or not the ball beats him! Four byes against his name. The ball rolls away to the boundary behind"
"on a length and outside off, Chandimal takes it on the up and drives the ball to mid-off"
"back of a length on off, Chandimal uses the bowler's angle to his advantage and simply tucks the ball behind square on the leg side"
"Dilruwan Perera pulls a rank half-tracker straight into the lap of Pandya at deep midwicket - the only man on the leg-side boundary. What a banner day for Pandya. A maiden Test ton, the wicket of Mathews, and a catch to boot. This was darted on middle, deserved to be smacked over the boundary. Instead, Perera picks out the fielder. You can't get away from Pandya"
"tossed on middle, defended"
"sliding across off, Pushpakumara plays with soft hands and edges it past slip"
Chandimal deploys a long stride and defends it with the break to short leg
"this skids on off stump, full in length, presses forward again and defends"
"shorter and spins away outside off, Chandimal uses the depth of the crease and punches it away past the left of Ashwin at mid-off"
"slower offbreak, starts on a fourth-stump line, and turns in, defended on the front foot. Will keep short leg interested"
"another loopier offbreak, defended to short leg"

tossed up on off and turns away past the outside edge. <strong>Pushpakumara did well not to thrust his hands at that wrong'un</strong>
"slid outside off from wide of the crease, left alone"
"another googly! Pushpakumara has no clue about this. He plays for the one that breaks in. Tossed up and curves away outside off, he plays inside the line and allows himself to get beaten"
"this one turns into him, from a length, and Pushpakumara has no problems in glancing the ball behind square. Chandimal turns down the single"
"length-ball offbreak, clipped with the spin to the right of short midwicket"
"tossed up slower and higher, hint of turn again, deflected to short leg on the bounce"
"<strong>a big appeal for caught behind</strong>. Did the glance the glove on its way? Saha and India think so. Umpire Tucker had shot down the appeal. India challenge the on-field not-out decision. Replays confirm there was no bat or glove involved. The ball bounced over the low hands and the bat. 'Clear daylight, and am happy there is no contact between bat and ball,' says TV umpire Illingworth"
"pushed through flatter and quicker, played back to the bowler"
"tossed up outside off, prodded into the covers"
"Chandimal goes low again for a sweep, this time there isn't extra bounce to trouble him and he doesn't play early. Rolls his wrists and directs the ball through backward square leg. Well played"
pitches on middle stump and breaks just past the leg stump. Chandimal sweeps far too early again
"tossed up slower and on off, squirts an inside edge to square leg. He takes the single and trusts Malinda against Kuldeep"
"wide of the crease, slid in on off, Malinda pokes it to cover-point"
whipped from outside off to the left of short midwicket
"lobbed up full on middle, Chandimal eyes up a big drive, checks his shot and taps it back to the bowler"
"skids into the leg stump, or even outside, just too full for the sweep. Chandimal dares to attempt that shot but does not make contact again"
"good take by Saha. Flat down leg, well down leg. Beats Pushpakumara's sweep"
"that's a lovely stroke. Short and wide outside off, spinning back in. Pushpakumara lets the ball spin before cutting late, a very very late cut to the third man boundary"
"quick on the pads, worked to midwicket"
"quicker outside off, more drift. Defended easily enough"
defended towards cover
"goes wider of the crease, tossed up on leg, beats Pushpakumara on the inside edge, struck on the pad. An appeal is quickly shot down"
"flight on off, defended away"
"overly full outside off, Chandimal's drive jams back to the bowler"

skewed away towards midwicket
"more flight outside off, defended away by Pushpakumara, who gets right forward to keep it out"
"81 kph, flat delivery on off, Chandimal misses a flick and is struck right in front of off. Umpire Tucker says no to Ashwin's appeals"

"shapes for another sweep, but bails out, drives back"

"tossed up outside off, Chandimal defends comfortably"
"another carrom ball, on leg, worked to midwicket"
"worked straight into the hands of leg gully. Plenty of flight outside off from Ashwin, spins back in. Chandimal sees that flight and complacently tries to work that into the leg side, but the ball takes the inside half of the bat, ricochets into the pad and then to leg gully. A soft dismissal."
elegantly worked to midwicket with the spin
an overpitched straight carrom ball is kept out
"invites a drive with plenty of flight outside off, skewed away to midwicket"
"plenty of flight outside off, defended towards cover. No, says Pushpakumara. A long run"
"that's great captaincy by Kohli. Brought in silly point for that ball, Kuldeep tossed up a googly on middle. Pushpakumara could not help himself from attempting an exuberant cover drive into the vacant cover region. Misses the ball by a considerable distance and the ball hits the stumps. Crowded out."
"flat outside off, spins back in and almost goes through a big gap between bat and pad. Inside edge"
"on the pads, played away towards short leg"
"nicely bowled. Plenty of flight outside off, inviting the drive. Miscued back to the bowler"

"drifts down leg, starts it outside off, Sandakan misses a defensive stroke"
"50 mph, another carrom ball, pushed back"
"another nice lofted stroke. Gets close to the pitch and hits over the bowler this time. Not great timing but good placement, earns four"
clipped away to square leg
"the legspinner, just too full outside off, gets underneath the bat."
"just short of slip. A googly on middle and leg, Vishwa jabs at it, gets a thick outside edge which lands in front of Rahane"
"this is the legbreak outside off, goes through a big gap between bat and pad"
driven into silly point's feet
"the googly down leg, defended"
"gone through bat and pad, and ricochets into the stumps via the pad. Lots of flight on leg and middle, the ball spins back in. Fernando doesn't have an idea of which way the ball is spinning (there were two googlies and two legbreaks before this ball in the over), and finds a big enough gap. Another fine wristspinning performance in international cricket. Teams have to know by now that a wristspinner is a match-changing option in all formats."

"82 kph, more variation, the carrom ball outside off, defended"
"flight on middle, Sandakan wants to send this into tomorrow but gets a thick inside edge into his pad"

"a nice positive stride, pushes to mid-off."
"too straight from Shami, worked through backward square leg for a couple"
"too straight from Shami, flicked away merrily through midwicket. Not a great start from Shami. starting his inswingers too straight"

more drift back in to the batsman who defends
"more flight on off, Tharanga gets forward to defend"
"quick and straight, no turn whatsoever. Defended"
"there's plenty of flight on that, outside off. Tharanga leans on a crisp cover drive. Fine stroke."
"full delivery outside off, rather wide. Leave-able. But Karunaratne drives, hit back to the bowler"
"smashed <strong>on the neck. That's very nasty</strong>. A very well-directed bouncer, keeps following Karunaratne with some inswing. He ducks into the ball, eyes off it. The ball goes on and hits him on the shoulder blade. The physio needs a look. Serious discomfort. Extremely unfortunate, not what SL need"
"no, he goes with another bouncer. 142 kph. When he has bowled short, it's been with intent. Gets underneath this time"

shovelled with that inswinging angle towards midwicket
"back of a length, straying down leg. An ODI wide. Not a bad surprise option, have a batsman strangled down the leg side"
"chopped on! Tharanga has a defeated look on his face. Good length outside off, Tharanga plays away from the body, his feet stuck in the crease, possibly due to the length of the ball or some weariness or some complacency. Either way, the ball takes the inside edge and knocks into off stump. A 45-degree bat to a ball seaming back in - how much ever it moves - is a dangerous option fraught with risk. Not the first time it's happened to Tharanga this series."

"beaut! Flight on off and middle, draws Karunaratne into a forward defensive stroke but some ripping turn takes the ball <strong>past the outside edge</strong>. That will put some doubt"
"and the wicket. Another terrific delivery. Flat and quick outside off, Karunaratne has no idea if it's the slider or the one that turns. His feet are nowhere and he fiddles at the ball, chases after the turn and gets some glove/shoulder of the bat on it. Easily snaffled up by slip. He could have played that better, just played the line, but that's easier to say than play. A deserved wicket for Ashwin, did him in with that previous delivery too. The pace was good too, he didn't let Karunaratne come forward or go back decisively"

"141 kph, a bit of width from Shami and Mendis climbs all over it. A flashing cut along the ground beats point"
"full, straight and given! No review from Mendis. Sri Lanka tottering. Beaten for pace. Goes full on leg, Mendis misses a flick, and you just can't miss straight deliveries. Umpire Tucker's finger goes up almost instantaneously. Umpire's call? Sliding down? A straight midwicket meant Mendis tried to use as less of the bat as possible, to hit the ball through square leg. To make that possible, he uses a cross-ish bat. Umpire's call on HawkEye, clipping by the slimmest of margins."
"143 kph, Mathews is expecting the bouncer or the straight delivery, but it's just a good length outside off. It's lethal because Mathews thinks he has to play. The ball just beats the outside edge. Another terrific over from Shami."

Full on leg, Dickwella gives himself some room and tries to find the gap either side of gully, but hits it close enough to Rahane, who gets his hands quickly to his left to complete a sensational reflex catch.
