"much fuller and angling away outside off, Guptill is stapled to the crease. He reaches out for the ball with hard hands and toe-ends a drive back to the bowler"
"good length and angling away outside off, Guptill attempts to drive on the up again, ends up mis-timing it to cover"
"just short of a good length and slanting away outside off, Guptill miscues it to cover. He inspects the toe end of the bat again"
"chest-high short ball on the off stump, skids on, and Guptill has been bounced out. This ball rushes Guptill into a hook and cramps him for room. He skies a biiiiig top edge. Thampi tracks it down at long leg. The extra pace from Sangwan surprised Guptill. Good work from Sangwan though, he had encouraged Guptill to drive, then got one to zip onto him quickly"

"back of a length and largely holds its line outside off, Marsh stands up tall and punches to cover"
"pitched up and outside off, crisply driven through the line, seems like that did not come onto the bat. Faulkner moves to his left from straight-ish mid-off and keeps it to one"
"Amla keeps timing the ball but keeps finding the fielders. Full and angling away outside off, another on-the-up drive, this one is hit straight to cover point"
half-volley on the pads. Sangwan will get a thank-you note from Amla after the match. Twirls his wrists and flicks it away past midwicket
"this is even better. Amla, standing outside leg, shuffles across the off stump. This is full and outside off, possibly a slower ball, the speedgun says 120ks, Amla flows forward and drives it through the covers"
"Amla jumps across off stump again, this one skids on, following the moving batsman. Amla eyes up the leg side, attempts a flick, and manages a leading edge, which does not carry to the bowler"
Amla walks at the bowler. Kulkarni is wary of it and shortens his length outside off. Punched down towards mid-off
"back of a length on middle, good bowling. Don't give Marsh room. Tucked away to deep midwicket"
"Amla stands outside leg, this is short and heading for the top of off. He shuffles across and punches to cover, where the fielder fumbles and allows a single"
"full, slower ball just a shade outside off. Marsh does not pick the change up. Looks to cut early and manages an inside edge onto the pad. The ball rolls towards cover and they pinch another single"

beats the outside edge right away. This wasn't all that short for the cut. The width was there with the ball angling across off. Marsh looks to cut.... and misses
"Marsh simply loves width. Pitched up and outside off, frees his arms and flashes an outside edge wide enough of backward point"
"<strong>Jadeja nearly pulls off a cracking catch</strong>. Short and wide outside off now to Amla, he cuts hard in the air. Jadeja propels himself to his right from backward point, attempts the catch with both hands, but it bursts out. Very difficult chance"
"back of a length and a hint of movement into Marsh to cram him for room, an inside edge trickles down the ground"
"That was so easy on the eye. This was on a good length on middle, it wasn't a poor ball. Amla made it look bad by backing away outside leg and driving it inside out over extra cover. He took it on the up and crunched it"
"short and attached with width outside off, Amla throws his bat at the ball and flashes it away towards Smith at cover point"
"and Amla welcomes him with a beautiful six. Good length and angling away outside off, Amla hits on the up and prospers again. He presses forward and lofts it through the line, clears mid-off and the boundary"
"back of a length on the hips, deflected square through the leg side. Amla did not get hold of the flick"

"floated up outside off, driven off the front foot to long-on for one"

"pushed through on off stump, Amla brings his wrists into play again, directing the ball to deep midwicket"

"flighted, full on middle and leg, driven with the wrists to long-on"
"tossed on middle stump, Marsh stretches forward and milks a single down to long-on"

"dropped short and spins away outside off, Amla misses a scoring opportunity. Chops straight to point"
"tossed up outside off and breaks away further, regulation legbreak, Amla aims to mow it over midwicket. Beaten lavishly"
"another tossed-up legbreak outside off, this time he does not look for the mow over the leg side. He lofts it through the line, putting the ball over the long-off boundary. All class from Amla. Smart too, given the straight boundaries are quite short at this venue"
"starts a new spell with a slower offcutter outside off, opens the face and angles it to point"
"another slow ball, back of a length, too straight in line, flicked through square leg"
"third slower ball in a row, 114ks outside off, Marsh opens the face and guides it in the gap at cover. He <strong>brings up his fifty off 37 balls</strong>"

"off-stump yorker, Amla is equal to it, slicing it away square through the off side"
"Marsh toe-ends a catch to Finch at long-on. Kulkarni breaks the stand. Good length ball on the leg stump, Marsh can't get under it. He skies it to the man in the deep"

"overpitched and outside off, smeared to cover"
"good length on off, 141ks, punched on the back foot through cover"
"this is just 90ks, slower ball on the leg stump, about 50ks slower than the last ball. Amla manufactures all the pace. Opens up his hips and tonks it over midwicket. The key to all this: a stable base"
"off-stump yorker, Amla clears his front leg and drills a single down to long-on"
"Maxwell backs away outside leg, Thampi nails the yorker. Superb execution. Right in the blockhole on off, Maxwell digs a single to cover point"
"whoa, shot (please give me a moment to pick my jaw up from the floor) Amla shuffles across off, aims for the scoop fine over leg. Thampi spots it and fires a low full-toss outside off. Amla changes his shot, but maintains his balance, and scoops it fine of short third man. Amla proving finesse and timing has a place in the T20 world"

"banged in short and just a shade outside off, Maxwell is rushed into a hook. Top-edges it over the bowler's head and gets away"

"hip-high short ball just outside off, poor length, Maxwell pounces on it. Sits deep in the crease and muscles it over deep midwicket"
"good length and outside off, Maxwell hits it against the angle. Mis-hits it, gets more height and enough distance. Clears long-on"
"Maxwell pre-meditates to reverse-paddle it fine on the off side, this is speared wide outside off. Maxwell only connects with a whole lot of thin air"

"slower short ball on middle, forces a pull to deep midwicket"
yorker on the leg stump - or a near yorker - shovelled away to long-on with the bottom hand
<strong>Amla reaches his second IPL hundred with a six!</strong>. This is a cross seamer - full and outside off - Amla creams it inside out over cover for a flat six. Sublime innings. He had reached his last ton with a six in the last over of the innings as well. Nice symmetry
"Thampi nails the yorker, this swings in a bit and raps him on the front pad. He plays across the line and is pinned in front. What an innings, though. He walks off to a rousing reception"

"bouncer over off stump, good follow-up. Smith ducks under it."

"back of a length, slanting across Kishan. Defended to midwicket"

length  ball on middle stump and Smith just leans on it and shows the full face. Flies off that bat face and mid-on has to throw himself full-length to his left to stop it from running away for four
"back of a length, angling into off stump, stays on the back foot and plays through midwicket with a straight bat"
"short, wide, that just sat up. Looked like the attempted slower bouncer but it was just too wide. Smith had a lot of time and he used it well, waited and slapped it into the gap between cover point and extra-cover"
"ooh, good ball. Straightens from just back of a length. Smith was looking to use the initial angle into off stump to play through midwicket, closed his bat face early, and it popped up off the leading edge and bounced away to the right of third man"
"back of a length on off stump, punched to mid-on"
"back of a length, angling into off stump, punched to mid-off, who's stationed deep enough to allow a straightforward single"

"short outside off, rises quite high and Kishan is off his feet to slash that away to the left of third man"
"full on middle and leg, this time Smith stays leg-side of the ball. Smart adjustment, he knows he has a bit of outswing to play with, and that mid-off is in the circle. Hits it slightly inside-out, to the left of the bowler and the right of mid-off, and hits it crisply"
"back of a length, angling into the body. Looks to pull but it isn't short enough, rolls off the thigh pad into the square leg region"
"full, angling into the stumps, clipped to midwicket. No-ball called - he's not overstepped, I think. The umpire is indicating something. Were there were more than two fielders outside the circle? Or did he not inform the umpire of his change to around the wicket? Smith's position suggests it may have been the latter."
"full on middle stump, swiped away along the ground to long-on. Too full to get any elevation on that"
"length ball on off stump, and that's such a sweet hit. Again he stayed leg-side of the ball and hit inside-out, this time driving on the up between mid-off and extra-cover"

"length ball on middle and leg, Smith clears his front leg and clubs it away. Doesn't quite middle it, but he clears the infield comfortably and gets a one-bounce four"
"<b>dropped</b>, Miller drops a dolly! Slower ball, offcutter, slightly back of a length outside off. Smith had cleared his front leg again and had to reach out a bit to try and slog it over mid-off. Didn't catch it well at all, and it went waaay up and down to the man at extra-cover, Miller, who drops the easiest of high catches"
"back of a length on leg stump, tucked away to the right of short fine leg"

"<b>dropped, another</b>! Short ball, and he leans back to club that hard, down the ground. Gurkeerat, diving forward, gets both hands to the low chance but can't hold on"

"gone, this time Miller holds on. Fuller this time, angling into the stumps, and Kishan, taking a stride down the pitch, slogs it to the left of deep midwicket - not as far to his left as he'd have liked - and Miller takes a good tumbling catch"
"ooh, inside-edge first ball.  Back of a length, he wanted to push that into the covers, the ball nipped back a bit, hit the inside edge of his angled bat, and rolled down to fine leg"
"That means long-on is back, but Smith is okay with that. Full on middle and leg, and he gets his front leg out of the way and just jabs that, rapid bat speed, and it soars high over the fielder at long-on"
"back of a length, a bit of inward movement maybe. Looks to stay leg-side of the ball and punch to mid-off, ends up inside-edging into the leg side"

"Raina shuffles across, tries to work this back-of-a-length ball through square leg, and gets undone by the slower ball. Misses, the ball gets jammed in his pad and drops by his feet. He thinks there's an opportunity for a leg-bye but turns back quickly when he sees the bowler sprint towards the ball. Pitched outside leg, so no appeal"
"bouncer, and Raina clobbers that, tennis-style. Clears his front leg, sits deep in his crease, and slaps that wide of midwicket"
"short ball at the body, Raina jumps across and shovel-pulls off his hip and finds the gap to the left of fine leg"

down the track and Sandeep shortens his length just enough while cutting down on room. Karthik defends to the on side and calls Finch through for a single
"slower short ball, chest-high outside off. Finch spots it late, plays a controlled pull through square leg. The lack of pace on the ball allows them to run two"
"another bouncer, not the slower one this time, and it takes off steeply. Finch, looking to pull from over his right shoulder, gets a thin edge through to Saha, and are Kings XI back in this?"
"slower ball on a good length outside off. Jadeja doesn't pick it, slogs and misses"
"Is that the third wicket of the over? If so, it's a run-out! Very full on the stumps, Jadeja clears his front leg and swipes to the right of long-on. They chance a second, and the dive saves Jadeja at the keeper's end, just about"
"slower length ball on off stump, eased to deep point with a straight bat"
"back of a length, angling into the body, and that's a highly fortunate six from Karthik. No boundaries in 17 balls before this, and he has a big slog at this. Top-edge, over the keeper, and it just keeps going and going and soars into the stands. Aaron's pace worked against him there."

"fuller now, angling into off stump, flat-batted firmly to long-off"

"in the blockhole, leg-stumpish. Clipped down the ground to long-on"
"Dot ball! It's the wide yorker, attempted at least. Ends up as a full-toss. Karthik swings hard, gets a thin outside edge that bounces a second time before reaching the keeper"
"and that is that. There was no one on the boundary, and Karthik puts the slower length ball away calmly, hitting inside-out over extra-cover, and it rolls slowly to the boundary to give Lions a six-wicket win."
