"and just like Australia in Pune, India are away with a boundary first ball of the Test. Renshaw edged that one, but here Rahul is more in control, driving a full and wide ball away through point. Slightly risky shot"
pulls the length back from that driving zone. Left alone outside off
"on a length, just outside off, Rahul leaves it alone. Bowled at 144ks"
"Starc goes full again, and Rahul drives again. Through extra cover he sends it for a couple. No swing so far"
digs this one in short. And he hits the top glove. Rahul not wearing an arm guard too. Rahul is a little surprised and fends at it. Lucky it has not popped up
"Starc looks for the one-two with a full sucker ball. Rahul drives with just his hands, gets a thick edge and it flies wide of gully for four more"
"Hazlewood on a length immediately. Around off, slight shape back in. Abhinav defends off the front foot"
perfect ball for a right-hand batsman. Starts outside leg for Abhinav and then swings further away. Wade puts a dive in to prevent byes
solid forward-defensive to a length ball. The ball rolls towards cover
"good leave. Hazlewood has been around off with the first and the third ball. This time he goes slightly wider, Abhinav pushes forward to cover his stumps, and then shoulders arms"
"on a length, starts around off, and then angles away. Left alone"
"this is a touch straight, and hits the pad as Abhinav looks to work it away to leg"
"short of a length, angles away after pitching outside off. Good carry for Starc. bowled at 144ks"
"that is a good ball. On a length, on off, holds its line slightly. Can't drive that, and can't leave that alone. Defended solidly by Rahul"
"short ball, into the hap, Rahul stabs at it with the bottom hand off. Gets a single to fine leg"
goes for the yorker first up. On off stump. Abhinav good enough to keep it out. A much better over from Starc so far
"and Abhinav has played all across a straight full toss. It looks to me like it is misis9ng leg, but the umpire has given him and India have not reviewed it. Back to the ball then: Starc is really good but this is a poor shot from Abhinav. Starc goes for the yorker, but ends up bowling a full toss on the pads. Abhinav doesn't play straight. He goes across it. Misses it. Hit in front of leg. It was more reviewable than anything India reviewed in Pune, and I say that without watching any replays. I stand corrected: the replays show it to be hitting the leg stump. Don't know how the projection made it swing, though. On a third look, the HawkEye is correct. The ball swung before it hit the pad. poor shot, though"
"there is the dummy. Show him the short leg, bowl the yorker. This one is outside off, though, and Pujara keeps it out"
"swing for Hazlewood. On a length, just outside off. Perfect delivery. Rahul defends from the crease"
defends a length ball back
"<strong>no third slip</strong> but wouldn't have carried to him. Lovely bowling. Short of a length, just outside off, then holds its line. Rahul stabs at it again, and the outside edge goes for four"
"full wide ball, Rahul drives away from the body, can't beat the deepish point. Wants a single but Pujara sends him back"
"short ball, outside off, a slightly ungainly leave as Rahul leaves his bat hanging. Decides really late to leave this"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
swing. Swing. This is a good sign for Australia. A length ball swinging back towards the top of off. Defended off the front foot
slightly short of a length. Left alone outside off
sucker ball outside off. Pujara doesn't go after it. Rahul would have
"lovely bowling. A beautiful bounding run, digs it in at 147ks, gets great carry from just short of a length. Just outside off, so Pujara drops his hands under it and watches it sail head high to Wade"
"Pujara is moving forward to the one pitched up. So that is a good sign for India. Not the most authoritative of drives, though. Can't beat mid-off"
<strong>hits the handle of the bat at 142ks</strong>. This is excellent fast bowling on a flat pitch. Pujara fends as Starc bowls this short one at his body. He is lucky it has not lobbed up. How many more overs does Starc have in his first spell?
Hazlewood meanwhile keeps pegging away. A length ball outside off. Slight shape away. Left alone
"lovely bowling. On a length, just outside off, holding its line. You have to defend it, and you have to do so without reaching its pitch. Rahul is squared up a touch"
"Hazlewood is dragging Rahul inch by inch towards off stump and then slips in a straight ball. Rahul defends this length ball, though"
"tries the short one but gets the line wrong. Down the leg side it goes, and Rahul watches it go through under his armpit"
"wide length ball, left alone"
goes fuller. Subtle changes of line and length. Rahul defends off the front foot
"length ball, starts outside off, and angles away through to the keeper"
goes for the lbw ball but slips it down leg. Wade has to dive to his left to prevent byes
another lbw ball goes too straight. Goes for a leg-bye as Pujara falls over on the flick. The ball is swinging
"short of a length, and Rahul stabs at it again. He is just playing the short balls more with hope than conviction. Manages to keep it down, but the ball has hit the shoulder of the bat and you can never be in control if it hits that high"
"<strong>goes for the yorker after the short one</strong>. Bowled at 141ks, hits the inside half of the bat on the full. It just swings late"
bouncer. proper bouncer. Wade collects it overhead after Rahul leaves it alone outside off
"on a length, on off, defends off the front foot. No turn"
Pujara down the wicket immediately. Drives to short cover
"on a length, slight straightening of the line. Defended off the front foot. Not to its pitch"
drives this one on the up. Away from the body. Gets a single to long-off
"down the wicket, not to the pitch of the ball, gets an inside edge on to the pad but the ball rolls back to him"
"full ball, driven right into the shin of silly mid-off. Gets a single off the ricochet"
"high full toss at 147ks, and swinging in late. Hits the inside half of the bat. Rolls to midwicket. A misunderstanding between the wickets, but all is fine"
"short of a length, down the leg side"
"on a length, swinging back in, defended solidly. This is right on the money"
"on a length, no shape back in. Angles away from just outside off. Left alone"
"short of a length, on off, defended to short leg"
yorker from Starc. Just outside off. Dug out by Rahul
"on a length,86ks, outside off. Holds its line. Left alone"
"closer to off, 89ks, defended back to him"
no turn this time. Pujara not to its pitch. Is hit on the inside edge
"flatter, shorter, punched to mid-on"
forward defensive
"flighted outside off, some dip there, and defended back to O'keefe after charging out"
"on a length, straight, worked to wide of square leg for a sharp single"
"on a length, aimed at top of off. Hits the inner half of the bat"
fuller ball. Pujara's feet are stuck and he drives uppishly towards short cover
forward in defence this time as Hazlewood stays on a length outside off
"<strong>edged</strong>. Just the slight holding of its line from a full length. Runs off the outside edge, along the ground, to gully"
"<strong>another edge</strong>. Lovely bowling. Goes wide on the crease, makes him play the angle, straightens the length ball, takes the edge, but it dies and rolls to point"
"<strong>huge lbw shout</strong>. Beaten on the inside edge. That's not good batting. He plays for the turn, and is hit in front of middle and leg. I think it was clipping leg. Not given. Missing, says the replay"
defended off the front foot
flatter skiddy delivery. Stays low. Kept out by Rahul
"flighted outside off, defended off the front foot"
"tosses it up again, and Rahul dances down the wicket to defend"
"nice loop and dip, middle and leg, driven uppishly towards cover. Inside out. That's an ambitious shot"
"short, into the ribs, Pujara not comfortable with it. He is stabbing at it. Hit on the rib for a leg-bye"
"full, outside off, defended from the crease"
"full, straight, going for the lbw ball, and Rahul is equal to it. Clips in front of midwicket"
full and straight. Rahul plays across the line. He is lucky to get a leading edge back to the bowler
"short of a length, seaming back into the ribs. Defended past short leg"
"he had to hit this one to relieve himself. Wide length ball, and Rahul throws his hands at it to drive it in front of point for four runs"
"slightly short of a length. Pujara waits for it, waits for it, and then turns it to leg for one"
"nice drift, middle and off, defended back to him"
"wider on the crease, 87ks, has Rahul jumping out of the wicket, but can only defend"
"full, on off, driven back to O'Keefe"
right forward to defend a flighted delivery
tries to skid one through. Bowled at 81ks. Rahul goes deep into the crease to defend
"full and straight, pushed to the right of O'Keefe at mid-on. Takes a single to the wrong side of the fielder. Good awareness"
"full and straight, Rahul again looks to play across, gets a bit of a leading edge back to Hazlewood"
"wide on the crease, angles a length ball in. Defended to mid-on"
"on a length outside off, defended to gully with an open face"
good full ball to tease him outside off. Slightly short of half-volley. Rahul appreciates that and leaves it alone
"good shot. Hazlewood goes wide on the crease but loses control of his length. Gives him a half-volley, which Rahul drives between the stumps and mid-on. They have earned the odd bad ball"
"slightly short of a length, and Pujara goes back to work it around the corner for one"
not to the pitch of the ball as he defends. Misunderstanding between the batsmen as Warner is chasing it at cover. They eventually get the easy single
down the wicket to drive this confidently to long-off
"<strong>dropped</strong>. They had the fielder there. The plan was there. Short leg for Rahul had been at silly mid-off. Rahul is out of his crease, not to the pitch of the ball, and pushes at it. Goes low to Handscomb's left. Difficult difficult grab. Gets a hand to it, but can't control it. Handscomb took blinders in Pune but this one travels too fast to him"
"oh nearly. Rahul not picking which way the ball is going nor reaching the pitch of it. This one slides in, hits the bottom edge as he goes back but doesn't go on to the stumps"
"plays in front of his body again. Uppish again, but gets a single to point this time"
dug in short. Not as much sting as they had earlier. Rahul works this to leg for one
"short of a length, wide outside off, left alone"
"errors creeping into Hazlewood's game, who is bowling his seventh over now. Tries the yorker but slips it down leg, and Pujara clips it away for four"
length ball but a touch too straight again. Worked past square leg for one
"straight, on a length, Rahul late in defence but the bat does come down just in nick of time"
"Hazlewood tries a full wide teaser with what should be the last ball of his spell, but Rahul steers this beautifully and to the left of deep point for four"
defended off the front foot
"Pujara waits for this length ball to work to leg, but they have plugged that single with a bakcward square leg now"
"down the wicket to take this on the half-volley, but can't beat midwicket"
forward defensive now
another forward defensive without reaching the pitch of the ball. You can trust this pitch and do it
"slightly flatter, punched to point"
"on a length, 126ks, slight extra bounce. Rahul is squared up in defence. Hit on the outer half of the bat"
slight low bounce from a length. Around off. Defended from the crease
"on a length, at the stumps, 124ks. Defended to leg"
"on a length, just outside off, 127ks. Defended off the front foot. Nothing to drive or pull or drive so far"
"misses the line, slides down leg, but they have a short midwicket in place to plug that single"
"slightly short of a length, and Rahul is always looking for runs. He dabs down on it and bounces it over gully for a single. Kohli might have come back for the secone, but you don't want to risk that with Pujara"
"half-volley, driven to sweeper cover for one"
"down the wicket, clips it to midwicket after reaching the pitch of the ball"
"on a length, just outside off, defended off the front foot"
"slight drift in, and he picks it up off the toes for a single to leg"
"round arm, from wide on the crease, on a length, no turn, and defended back to him"
"nice dip. On a length, straightens just outside off. Defended off the front foot"
"length ball outside off, 125ks, left alone"
"on a length, 128ks, Pujara comes forward to defend"
"short of a length, outside off, steered away for a single"
"stays on that length, just outside off, 128ks, defended from the crease"
"fuller, straighter, defended back to Marsh"
"hits the glove. Some extra bounce or just that Rahul has played forward to a ball that he should have stayed back to? He looks for a forward-defensive, and is surprised by the bounce. Takes the bottom hand off, and is hit on the glove"
flat delivery to start off with. Worked past shirt leg for one
extra bounce from a length outside off. Rahul is back as he defends
nice paddle sweep. Uses Lyon's pace to guide this length ball from middle and off. He has edged this but it is quite a safe shot with no leg gully in place
"Rahul not quite in control. Defends an offbreak, is hit high on the bat"
"flighted outside off, Rahul is right forward to smother the turn"
<strong>lbw shout as he plays the conventional sweep</strong> but Rahul has got himself outside the line. Umpire Llong says the same and Rahul gets a leg-bye
"on a length, outside off, easily negotiated"
"on a length, outside off, left alone"
"<strong>nearly gone</strong>. Short of a length, outside leg, looks like easy runs on the leg side but the ball stops on him. He is early into the flick, and lobs it off the glove. Doesn't carry to square leg"
"there is some swing still. From a length, and hits him high on the inside edge and onto the thigh pad"
"<strong>nearly played on</strong>. Sucker ball outside off, Rahul looks to drive, but is uncertain. Just plays it with his hands. No feet. The inside edge hits the pads"
"bouncer, just outside off, he sways out of its line"
"down the wicket, not to its pitch, defends it to short midwicket"
"Pujara leaves the crease again, and Lyon gets some drift this time to beat him in the air. The inside edge rolls along to short midwicket"
stays back to defend a length ball
"<strong>turn and bounce</strong> early in the match. Pujara not in control of it, but gets a single through backward short leg"
"<strong>natural variation this time</strong>. The offbreak that doesn't turn. Rahul is beaten on the outside edge. The ball stays low, and squeezes through Wade's leg"
"<strong>reverse sweep</strong>. Not in control. It flies off the back of the bat, and goes where leg slip would have been for a single. It hits the helmet too"
"on a length, on off, no swing. Defended from the crease"
"full and straight, slight shape back in. Defended back to him"
"short, into the ribs, he fends without control. Hit on the bat handle, and he is lucky this has not popped up. Big 15 minutes for Rahul. He looks really edgy"
"on a length, just outside off, solid in defence this time"
"short, outside off, 141ks, Rahul behind it in defence"
full toss. No swing this time. He drives this beautifully through cover
"Pujara not to the pitch of an offbreak outside off, but keeps it down in defence"
"flat offbreak, defended off the back foot"
punched off the back foot but Marsh's dive at short midwicket denies them the single
good bounce from Lyon as Pujara looks to work this off the back foot. Gets a single around the corner
"looks for the paddle sweep, the ball lobs up towards the vacant leg slip. No short fine either. So in that regard this top edge is a slightly safe shot"
"down the wicket, takes this on the half-volley, gets a single to long-on"
"ordinary shot from Pujara. Wide length ball, and Pujara just drives at it without feet. Lucky not to edge it"
"on a length, middle and off, hits the high part of the bat as Pujara defends"
"full, on off, Pujara defends from the crease"
"bouncer, at his body, at 140ks, Pujara ducks under it"
"good bouncer and good leave. The last one was pitched just outside leg, this one is on middle. Gets it higher too. Pujara gets low and sways away from its line. Drops the wrists too"
"short of a length, doesn't get too high, worked to long leg for one. That's Starc done for this session"
stays back to defend a length-ball offbreak. Plays it late
"down the wicket, beaten in the air, thrusts his pad forward, and the ball ricochets into his armpit off the top of the pad"
"flights this outside off, defended off the front foot"
"tossed up outside off again, Pujara right forward in defence. Hit on the inside half of the bat"
"Lyon has got Pujara just before lunch. This should be lunch. Pujara has not been very certain in picking the length today. He makes a forward press, and then sees the flat trajectory  and goes back. There is enough turn and bounce on this pitch for the ball to break back and take the inside edge onto the pad. Lobs up for an easy catch"
"stays back to an offbreak that doesn't turn. He adjusts late, gets an inside edge onto the pad. All happening"
yorker to begin with. Dug out to gully
"on a length, on off, defended with an open face to short cover"
"on a length, on off, defended with a slightly open face"
"<strong>stayed low</strong>. Short of a length, within the stumps, and almost shoots through. Rahul keeps it out. Does well"
"on a length, middle and off, hits the inside half of the bat"
"<b>stays low again</b>. Short of a length, outside leg, defended in front of the stumps"
too full from Lyon and Kohli drives him to long-on for one
down the wicket to reach the pitch of the ball and pushes it down to long-on for another single
"not driving length, and Kohli shuffles across to defend this to leg"
stays back to work an offbreak past the backward short leg. Not the safest of shots considering the leg slip is there
"nice flight and dip outside off, defended back to him"
nice dip again. Rahul defends watchfully outside off
this is the contest. Sarc bowls a yorker at 143ks. Just outside off. Kohli watchful in defence
full and outside off. Kohli drove at a similar ball and edged it in Pune. He drives again. This time he is hit on the inside half of the bat
"good leave. On a length, on off, and allowed to angle away. He covers the stumps when he does so"
"on a length, middle and off, defended off the back foot"
"poor shot. Extra shot and bounce does that to you. You are out of your comfort zone. This ball at 10ks slower, Kohli is never going to chase. This one he does. It is short, outside off, and rises higher than the chest. He looks to guide it. Almost as if giving slip practice. Misses"
what a reply from Kohli. Starc follows the short ball with a full one. Kohli is moving forward and meets it with a full face. Places it between cover and mid-off. It rattles along for four
"on a length, outside off, defended from the crease. Looking unsure in his footwork"
"<strong>glove</strong>. Again Rahul unsure with his feet. He is looking to always go forward but Lyon bowls a length that he knows he can't reach. Ends up pushing at it. The ball bounces and hits the glove, but it doesn't lob up"
"this time he goes back to a length ball, bounces in front of short leg, and takes the single as it goes over that man. That brings up a fifty. Not the prettiest but it can be a huge innings if he can double the score"
"nicely played. Kohli picks the length early, goes back and works this between forward short leg and backward short leg for one"
defended outside off
pushed wide of cover for a single. With Pujara this single wouldn't have been possible
"on a length, just outside off, hits the high part of his bat as he defends"
"full, outside off, driven to mid-off"
"length ball, outside off, he gets a stride in and shoulders arms"
"short of a length, no room, defended from the crease"
he has not looked comfortable against the short ball today. He stabs at this one. This is only hip high so he is able to tuck it away for one to long leg
"Starc tries to go behind Kohli's pad after having bowled outside off to him, but Kohli is equal to it and clips this straight ball away for a single"
"turn and bounce for Lyon. Kohli stays back, is beaten and is hit straight on the thigh pad. <strong>Just half a shout for a catch</strong>"
"lovely shot. Lyon asks Kohli is he wants to drive against the turn through the vacant cover region. Kohli says hell yeah. He stretches forward, and uses his wrists to keep this cover drive down"
"the line gets straighter, and Kohli defends to leg"
another defensive shot to leg
"what has Kohli done here? Out twice in a row when padding up. And this is a really really 'big batsman' review from Kohli. Kohli has just left alone an offbreak headed straight for the stumps. This is plumb as. Kohli has a chat with Rahul, and for some weird bizarre reason, 'the best batsman' in the team eats up a review. And he sees the replay on the big screen and walks off even without any confirmation. The crowd is hushed. You can hear a pin drop. Anyway here is what happened? Kohli went back to look to work this to leg, but then for some reason shouldered arms to one pitched just outside off and on a length. It was hitting middle and leg. He expected it to turn more than it did"
"tossed up outside off, pushed wide of point for a single"
"full, outside off, driven back to him"
left alone outside off
"length ball, into the pads, worked away to long leg"

stays back to defend a length ball
"flighted outside off, pushed wide of mid-off for one"
stays back to defend a length ball. Lyon in amazing rhythm. Good overspin
"tossed up outside off, defended off the front foot"
"Rahane leaves the crease, is beaten in the flight, and defends well in front of his body"
"flatter, quicker, Rahane goes back to defend this to short leg"
"on a length, slight nibble back in, defended towards mid-on. Hits the toe end too"
<strong>height saves Rahul</strong>. Again that nibble back in from just short of a length. Hits the thigh pad after beating the inside edge
"slight swing back in, defended to short midwicket"
"full, outside off, pushed wide of mid-off for one"
"short of a length, outside off, left alone"
front-foot defensive to end the over
forward-defensive
stays back to defend a length ball
"again stays back, and is hit low on the bat as he defends"
extra bounce as he stays back to defend. He manages to keep it down
"<strong>big shout for lbw</strong> but big turn too. Rahane stretches forward, is beaten on the inside edge, but this one is turning too much. It has either hit him outside the line or is sliding down. Lyon tells Smith as much, and they don't review"
"sharp turn and bounce. Beats the inside edge, and lobs off the thigh pad. <strong>Half a shout</strong>"
"short of a length, on off, defended from the crease"
"on a length, stays a touch low, in front of off, and hits the bottom of the bat"
"full and straight, and they have a strong leg-side field to deny them the singles"
"short of a length, rising towards his chest. Rahul fends this down"
"<strong>no slips in place</strong>. Half intentional. Short of a length, nibbling back in, he opens the face but it also runs off the edge. Fine of gully it goes"
"short of a length, straight, stays a touch low, and is worked away past square leg for one"
<strong>no turn</strong>. Natural variation on that offbreak. Rahul does well to keep it down as it hits the outside half of the bat
"turning into middle and leg, worked past short leg, although uppishly"
"stays back to a length ball, <strong>which nearly shoots through</strong>. Hits the toe end of the bat"
"Rahane takes the calculated risk. He says he doesn't want Lyon to keep bowling in that zone. Jumps out of the crease, and lofts an offbreak towards deep midwicket"
"no turn on  this offbreak, and it runs off the outside edge as Rahane defends"
"short of a length, he goes back to punch this to deep midwicket for one"
"flat, on the pads, worked away for one"
"flat, middle and off, 86ks, turns away a touch. Defended from the crease"
"slows it down now, more importantly tosses it up. Defended away from the body, outside off"
"tossed up again, driven square without reaching the ball, keeps it down with the wrists"
moves across to defend this to that short mid-off
"flatter delivery, Rahul picks it and goes back in defence"
presses forward but then is stuck on the crease as Lyon keeps this flat. Manages to keep this down
"overpitched, driven against turn, but can't beat mid-off"
"shimmies down the wicket without reaching the pitch of the ball. He is getting beaten in the air, and that shot over midwicket has been blocked. Defended uncertainly"
"flatter, quicker, straighter, turns from off and middle and past the leg stump"
stays back to open the face on a quick delivery. Can't beat point
"on a length, on off, a lot of overpsin on it. Rahane defends from the crease"
"full, on off, defended back to O'Keefe"
stays back to defend a length ball
nicely tossed. Rahul defends off the front foot

slight turn from just outside off. Stays back to defend
"slightly quicker, 87ks, just outside off, defended in front of the body"
"stays back to play a length ball. The ball gets big on him, but he rides the bounce well and places it well between the two short legs. Keeps it down, more importantly"
stays back to a fullish offbreak. Defends it but is hit on the inside half of the bat
"<strong>don't call this a drop</strong>. Rahul has nailed this paddle sweep and it's going over leg slip. Warner is at leg slip, and has very little time to react. He gets his hands up in time, but it doesn't stick. Can't make the rebound either. It will be unfair to call it a drop"
hard hands as he is not close to the pitch of the ball as he defends. Falls short of short midwicket
defends from the crease

"slight drift into the pads, worked away for a single"
"tossed up outside off, defended off the front foot"
"no turn, hits the inside edge as Rahane defends, playing for the turn"

"flat offbreak, worked off middle and leg for an easy single"
"nice turn and bounce. Rahane stays back and keeps it down, but this is looking dangerous"
"flighted outside off, solid front-foot defensive"

"full and straight, defended back to O'Keefe"
"flatter delivery, he goes back for the back cut but can't beat backward point"
<strong>shouts of catch</strong> but it has lobbed between the two short legs. There might be a bit of a glove
"flighted outside off, defended off the front foot"
"<strong>missed stumping? No it isn't</strong> Natural variation there. Rahane skips out to an offbreak, the ball doesn't turn, he is beaten on the outside edge, Wade fumbles but so far out is Rahane that he has time to gather it again and break the wicket. Another hushed silence at the ground. Apart from no turn, there is also drift to take the ball away from Rahane"
"flat offbreak, goes back, is beaten by the turn, and gets a leg-bye"
"front-foot defensive, but he is not to its pitch. Hit high on the bat"

"nicely played. Just a touch too full, and he works this to leg from off-stump line. Knows there is no time for the ball to turn and he can close the face on this"
"full and wide, he would have needed a ladder to reach it"
"on a length, outside off, angled away. Left alone"
"on a length, on middle and leg, and wristily clipped away past square leg"

"on a length, middle and leg, holds its line, defended"
"plays the sweep, looks to play it in front of square, and gets a top edge to deep midwicket. Not that risky a shot"
defended off the front foot this time
"length ball, outside off, defended"
"ice shot. Unlike the other Indian batsmen so far, he has picked the length early and played late. He goes back to play the back-cut and beats backward point"
"<strong>turn</strong> from outside off, beats the outside edge, hits Wade's glove and ricochets to Smith at slip"
driven uppishly. Loose shot well away from the body. Gets a single to deep point
"good leave. This is just outside off, and is angling away. Nair strides forward and shoulders arms"
"full and outside off, and another leave"
"another nice shot. Starc goes for the yorker, but bowls a full toss. Nair plays it late, and uses all his pace to guide it past square leg for four"
"good calling and running. Nair uses soft hands, places this wide of cover, and they steal the single"
"drives away from the body, to the right of deep cover, and he calls two immediately. They are looking busy"
"<strong>turn there</strong>. From off, and turns past the bat. Nair does really well to play the line, and not follow the ball"
"that turn has done the tricks. Nair leaves the crease with no plan whatsoever. O'Keefe bowls it slower in the air and shorter than the previous ball. It falls short of Nair's reach, who looks to play a forward-defensive now that he has been foxed. The ball turns past him, Wade stumps him in a flash"
"fires this one in, and misses his area completely. Four byes down the leg side"
<strong>shooter outside off</strong>. Squeezes under his punch
<strong>sharp turn</strong>. But from well outside off. Wade collects it one-handed
this one doesn't turn but is wide enough outside off to leave alone

"drives away from the body, in front of deep point, comes back for two"

"stays back for a shortish offbreak. Plays it late, and places it between the short legs"
"flighted outside off, Ashwin right forward to defend it"
"her has gloved it straight to backward short leg. Lyon has got him moving forward again and again, and has then pushed one in. From middle and off it turns and bounces. Ashwin meets it hip high and down the leg side. Warner doesn't make a mistake with this one"
nice dip outside off. Saha defends from the crease
"full, on off, driven down to long-off for one"
flighted high. Saha steps out to drive it on the half-volley for one to long-off

"flatter, quicker, defended back to him"
"slightly short, but Rahul's punch can't beat the short straight cover"
"another flat delivery, he looks to work it away, but it doesn't turn and he has to recalibrate his shot. Can't beat short midwicket now"
"<strong>bottom-edged into the pad</strong>. He sweeps this into his boot, and his hand in his followthrough keeps it down. Otherwise he was gone because this would have lobbed up"
""
stays back to defend a length ball

"slower in the air, middle and leg, defended with soft hands to leg"
"down the wicket, looks to push this to long-off but can't beat short extra cover"
"flatter, middle and leg, defended off the front foot"
slows it down now. Saha right forward in defence
flat offbreak again. Middle and leg. Punched away for a single
"too full, driven straight but can't beat that short straight cover"
"Lyon has five now. if O'Keefe doesn't get you, Lyon will. This is just the natural variation, but the change in trajectory has to be credited. It's a length-ball offbreak outside off. It's flat. Saha goes back to defend it, but the ball doesn't turn, and takes the outside edge. Smith juggles it at slip but doesn't let it fall"
"flat offbreak, outside off, left alone"
"Jadeja gets a loose ball. It is short, and he has punched it square of sweeper cover for two"
"<strong>inside edge saves him</strong>. Jadeja is one of those old-fashioned batsmen who plants his front foot across, which leaves him vulnerable to the ones that don't turn. This one doesn't turn, hits him in front but takes the inside edge on the way"
"nice hang time on the ball. Rahul drives with an open face, gets a single to deep point"
"flighted outside off, some turn back in, and Jadeja defends"
"full, middle and off, driven to O'Keefe"

"flatter delivery, and he goes back to defend it"

"flighted outside off, defended to leg"
"slightly too full, and he knows he can use his wrist to manoeuvre it through midwicket for one"

"full, just outside off, slight shape back in. Jadeja solid in defence"
sweeps from outside off after getting outside the line. Gets a single as he keeps this down
"<strong>double-play shout</strong>. Both for lbw and a bat-pad catch here. This is a length ball, on off. It doesn't turn, and goes straight on. <strong>Given not out on the field, and Australia review it</strong>. Llong thinks this is going down leg. However, Jadeja has got a small, minute inside edge onto the pad and it has lobbed to first slip. He is out caught bat-pad. No. 6 for Lyon, who is already the most prolific Australia bowler against India"
defends a length-ball offbreak from the crease
right forward to defend an offbreak
nice dip and turn back in. Umesh defends with an open face
"full, nearly a yorker, dug out by Umesh"
"<strong>lbw review but more out of optimism and proximity to the 80th over</strong>. Rahul looks for the big sweep, is beaten, but is hit on the shoulder so it is clearly bouncing over the stumps"
"full, on off, driven hard but can't beat cover. He turns down the single on the fumble and walks away in discomfort. <strong>Has he done the shoulder again?</strong>"
beaten on the reverse sweep but is hit outside the line
says back to punch a length ball in front of point for one
"full, on off, dug out. Crowd cheers"
"round arm, wide on the crease, defends a length ball back"
"Lyon gets seven. Rahul is desperate now, and he tries an unlikely shot. Looks to cover-drive this spitting offbreak, and ends up double-hitting it to mid-off. The ball hits the top of the bat and gets another whack from the toe as the bat completes it follow-through. He has played really well, but he has been stranded and has had to play low-percentage cricket of late. Gets a standing ovation from the home crowd"
"Eight for Lyon. He will be on a hat-trick in the second innings. This is a lame No. 11 shot. He tries to defend a sharp offbreak, inside-edges it into the pad, and short leg takes a sitter"
"on a length, on off, defended from the crease"
"on a length, outside off, runs off the outside edge for a single to third man"
"on a length, on off, left alone with the angle. Doesn't carry to Saha"
another length ball hits a crack outside off and lands in front of Saha
wide length ball. Just one ball on target this over

<strong>big shout for lbw</strong>. Beaten on the inside edge by a straight delivery. Given not out because the umpire thinks it is headed down leg
"<b>almost identical</b>. Another big lbw shout. Again Renshaw gets into a tangle after planting the front foot across. The ball straightens only a touch. Umpire suggests it is headed down leg, and again India don't review. Replays show this is bouncing over"
this time he gets bat on ball but that front foot has to go straight down the pitch and not across towards the off stump
another no-ball. full and straight. Defended to mid-on
"<strong>dropped</strong>. Rahane drops at gully. This is another catch gone. At least 24 for this season. This length ball stops at Warner, and goes to the left of gully at a comfortable pace. Rahane dives, gets both hands to it, but it doesn't stick"

"Ashwin outside the leg again, Warner shimmies down and pads away"
"short of a length, outside leg, Warner pads up again. It turns more than expected"
"<b>shout for catch</b>. Ashwin gets closer to leg stump, and that makes Warner play. The ball turns away, squared him up and flicks the back pad on the way through to Saha. Correct call from Umpire Llong to say not out"
"goes back outside leg, and Warner uses his bat this time"
"slightly fuller, slightly closer to him, and Warner defends off the front foot"
Ishant down the leg side again. Lucky Renshaw doesn't get any bat on this one
back to hitting his length just outside off. Renshaw defends off the front foot
"on a length, angling in, worked away from around the middle-stump line for a single"
"short, wide, punched away, in front of deep point. This is not good bowling, and on the other hand Warner is a great frontrunner, and he will make you pay for every small error"
"good comeback. The fast bowler getting his own back. Bouncing a batsman who is standing outside the crease. Goes over the right shoulder. Warner is fending without any idea where the ball is, and is lucky to not glove it"
on a length and straight. Stays a little low. Kept out by Warner
"short of a length, outside leg, defended off the back foot"
"<b>bat-pad</b> but it loops over short leg. This is on a length, outside leg, and Renshaw defends. The ball doesn't turn much, and takes the inside edge. Short leg not tall enough. Needed to have stilts"
pads away now
"pads up again, and this time the ball turns extra to hit the inner half of the pad. Brings some excitement"
"this time he is slightly fuller and closer to leg, so Renshaw defends"
"attacks the stumps as a change-up, and Renshaw goes back to defend"
"on a length, on off. Defended towards mid-on"
wide length balls help. Driven to deep point

"length ball outside off, left alone. It kicks off and reaches Saha chest high"
"digs one in short. Renshaw rides the bounce, and fends it down"
again the ball kicks off a length outside off. Except that it is too wide to make him play. Called no-ball too
"length ball outside off, and left alone. This one dies through to Saha"
"Ashwin has struck. That rough outside leg has worked. Ashwin is pumped up. Warner is caught in two minds to this one pitched well outside leg but turning towards the stumps. Warner shapes up to pad up, but sees the extravagant turn and tries to chase the ball with his hands. The ball spins past the bat and hits the off stump. The crowd has found its voice. It will sound strange to those who don't know cricket but had Warner committed to not committing to this delivery, he could have padded it away easily"
"half-volley first up, pushed to long-on for one. A bit of a tangle between Ashwin and Renshaw but all is fine"
Ashwin tosses this on off. Left alone by Renshaw
"on a length, outside leg. On any other pitch these balls would be padded away eyes closed but because it turning so much from there, Renshaw plays at it"
kicks one away from outside leg
"straight, just outside leg, and Renshaw defends"
"length ball outside off, and Smith moves across to defend"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
another exaggerated leave outside off. This is charged-up cricket
shooter from a crack but wide outside off. Smith doesn't need to play at it
"this is clever bowling. Slower offcutter at the stumps, and Smith is beaten by the movement and lack of pace. <strong>Big lbw shout</strong> but it is sailing over. On the replay, this is not an offcutter. It just moved off the pitch"
another exaggerated leave outside off. Smith is charged up too
"short of a length, middle and leg, defended off the back foot"
"down the wicket, beaten in flight, kicks it away with the bat close to hi"
"leaves the crease again, beaten in flight again, hit on the inside half of the bat as he defends"
flat length ball. Not much turn. Defended off the back foot
"down the wicket again. Flat, into the pads. Defended to short leg"

"on a length, just outside off. It jags back in off the pitch and takes the inside edge on the drive. Smith is safe here, though"
shuffles across to defend a length ball back to him
"another shuffle across, and Smith gets a straight ball. He thinks he can clip this to leg, but it stays low, and he is watching it close enough to change his shot and defend"
fuller this time. Smith goes across to bunt it wide of point for one
length ball outside off. Holds its line. Left alone
"bouncer, into the ribs, Renshaw ducks and gets inside its line"
stays back to defend a length-ball offbreak
"looks to move forward, a sees a flatter trajectory, and stays back to use Ashwin's pace for a single past point"
"<strong>this is going to cause doubts</strong>. Length ball pitched well outside leg. Renshaw pads up, but the ball turns a mile, misses both his pads, and also misses the off stump"
"flatter, shorter, outside leg, punched away to deep square leg for one"
"too full, and Smith pinches a single to mid-on, where Umesh Yadav is slow to react"
"half-volley on the pads, and he has protection at cow corner to keep them down to one"
"dug in short, chest high, and fended down by Renshaw"
"short of a length, angling in, fended down. Ishant has tumbled over in his follow-through"
"into the ribs, he fends at it, fails to keep it down, but has played it wide of short leg"
<strong>shooter</strong>. Rolls through to Saha. Smith is done in but he is lucky this is outside off
"on a length, on off, Smith exaggerated in saying no and reacting to Ishant. Kohli at slip is in splits looking at the faces Ishant is making"
"stop the press: Ishant doesn't make a face at Smith in his follow-through. Smith defends this one solidly. This might look funny, but this is serious stuff. India are fighting today to keep the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in play"
"full, outside leg, kicked away by Renshaw"
"full, outside leg, defended back to him"
kicked away again
"looks to pad one away, the ball turns past front pad and hits the back pad and lobs to Rahane at slip"
"flat, into the pads, defended to short leg"
"on a length, on off, defends off the front foot"
"short of a length, outside off, punched to cover"
"full, just outside off, defended with soft hands"
"short of a length, and it sits in the surface and kicks at him. Smith has to abort at the last moment the punch he is looking to play. Keeps this down"
<strong>and now a shooter from a similar spot</strong>. Squeezes under his bat but well outside off
"on a length, outside off, defended from the crease"
"short of a length, outside off. Extra bounce and slow off the pitch. Smith manages to keep it down again"
"full, outside leg, within his reach. Driven to deep midwicket for one"
"offbreak, into the pads, lobs off the pad to backward short leg. Smith in two minds here. Perfect length"
"shimmies down, and pushes a flatter delivery back to Ashwin"
"<strong>Smith in two minds again</strong>. Not given out on lbw, but India have reviewed it. And this looks like a good review. Ashwin has bowled a flat topspinner here. The seam is almost upright. Smith has misjudged the length completely and gone to pull a ball that is not short enough. It pitches on off, hits him on middle and leg, and returns an umpire's call on the leg stump. Phew that is close. Smith gets to bat on. All is happening. I forgot to tell you Renshaw nearly ran himself out trying to come back for a second leg-bye"
"full, middle and leg, defended"
strides forward to smother the turn again
"short of a length, outside off, defended off the back foot"
"<strong>oh this is close</strong>. Length ball, hits the pitch, holds its line, stays low. Smith watching it close, and gets the bat down in time"
"stays low again, and Smith does well to get his bat down in time. Oh this pitch is getting more and more difficult every passing ball"
"short of a length, outside off. The bunce is reliable this time. Defends"
leg-cuts from short of a length. Smith squared up in defence
"<strong>how well has Smith played this?</strong>. This is a shooting offcutter. Not that Umesh intends to bowl it this way, but it hits a crack outside off and jags back in. Stays low for good measure. Smith is watching this very closely and plays it late and keeps it out"
"flat, short of a length, no turn, slight low bounce. Renshaw keeps it out"
defended off the front foot as he pitches it up
"flighted outside off, and left alone"
"flatter, but still on a length. Renshaw defends off the back foot"
tossed up outside off. Doesn't play at it
"flatter, short of a length, angling in, and defended to leg"
"on a length, outside off. Smith squared up in defence, but he is watching it very closely"
"full this time. He plays with soft hands, and steals a single to point who is deepish"
"that is an edge but should be some relief for Australia. On a length, middle and off, and he has to play at it. The angle takes the edge, which dies immediately and goes wide of slip for four"
<strong>another edge dies</strong>. Renshaw is squared up as this one cuts away off a length. Soft hands and low bounce mean it doesn't carry to first slip
"<strong>play and a miss</strong>. A length ball on off, and it jags away a touch. Renshaw plays at it, and is beaten"
"<strong>another educated edge</strong>. This is a full ball so Renshaw thinks he can drive down the ground, but the ball still moves away to hit the edge. Flies between the first slip and the wider slip. Wouldn't have carried to second slip anyway"
"half-volley, clipped to the right of Jadeja at mid-on, and takes the single"
"teasing him with a half-volley, asking Renshaw if he fancies a drive. He doesn't"
draws a forward defensive with a flighted offbreak

"full, on off, stays back to sort of flick it to mid-on"
"short of a length, at off, defended from the crease"

"too full outside leg, and worked away to deep square leg for one"
"on a length, close to off. Defended back to him"
"down the wicket, beaten in the flight, flicks it uppishly towards short midwicket"
"flatter, fuller. Defended back to him"
"flat again. Stays a touch low, and he defends this to leg"
"full, on off, defended watchfully"
this one jags away from around off and kicks off too. Beats the edge. Renshaw does well to play the line and not follow it
"<strong>another edge goes for four</strong>. Dug in shirt, Renshaw looks to fend, gets an edge, which falls to the left of Kohli. He gets a hand to it, but doesn't dive forward. Was he up too early? Kohli almost upright at the time the ball meets the bat"
"superb delivery. On a length, on off, nips away, and beats him"
"on a length, on off, stays low, and Renshaw does well to keep this out"
Umesh goes for the full and straight lbw ball but Renshaw is equal to it and defends it back

wide length ball. Easy leave
"on a length, jags away after pitching on middle and leg. Beats the edge"
"plays inside the line as this one jags away again. Too much movement, and Renshaw smiles back to Umesh"
"<strong>beaten again</strong>. Renshaw has to play the angle, and the ball holds its line outside off"
"full and straight, and because Renshaw is hanging back he is squared up a little. The ball hits the soft outside off, and rolls to the cordon"
"short of a length, angling in, defended from the crease"
"overpitched, but driven straight to short cover"
"down the wicket, and steals a single to Ishant at mid-on"
"looks for the paddle sweep, but is beaten. However, he has got well outside the line"
"commits to sweep early, exposes his stumps, and Jadeja aims at those stumps. Beats him and hits the glove. The lbw shout rightly negated"
defends a length ball
"shapes up for the sweep early, and does so. It is nearly a quick yorker, but he manages to place it past short leg"
"a length ball, angling in, defended"
"on a length, angling in towards off again. Renshaw defends from the crease"
"down the pads, flicked uppishly to deep square leg for one"
"on a length, just outside off, Smith defends with soft hands"
"stays low around that off stump, but Smith is watching them and playing them late"
"short of a length, outside off, punched to short cover"
"this is not good from Ishant. Renshaw hits a ball straight to him at mid-off, and steals a single"
"the natural variation from Jadeja does it. The pressure has worked. India have been at them all morning, and now they have broken through. Length ball, middle and leg, Smith plays a defensive shot, looking for some straightening of the line, but the ball slides on to hit the inside edge and the pad. Saha runs to his left and puts in a dive to catch it"
"full, outside off, defended back to him"
shimmies down to flick one to mid-on
and Marsh picks a single to that man who has just moved back at mid-on
"on a length, middle and leg, defended off the front foot"
"on a length, on off, defended back to him"
"on a length, outside off, 143ks, left alone"

Ashwin dives to his right, gets it in one hand, but the ball pops out as his elbow hits the ground. However, the ball lands one on his arm and not on the ground. Ashwin shows quickness then to quick retrieve it off his arm. Slight luck involved there but a good effort from Ashwin"

"full, middle and off, defended to mid-off"
"<strong>dropped by Saha</strong>. Having said that, this is a catch the last India wicketkeeper wouldn't have gone for. Short of a length, middle and off, nips away, squares him away, takes the outside edge. Saha puts a dive in, gets his left hand to it, but it doesn't stick"

"short of a length, straight, defended from the crease"
"<strong>Starc is lucky with this one</strong>. He looks to drive a length ball, which stops on him, and the hard hands mean it lobs towards extra cover. Jadeja picks it a little late, and it clears him. I have never seen Jadeja react so late to a catch"

pads one away outside leg
stays back to defend a flat delivery
"slows it up, Wade defends outside leg"
"slightly quicker, Wade defends off the front foot. Not padding up even though it is pitched outside leg"
"<strong>wade plays at one again</strong>. Pitched outside leg, turns and kicks away, and goes off the glove for a single wide of slip"
"on a length, middle and off, he runs it towards point with a single"
"full, outside off, runs off the outside edge through the vacant point region"
"on a length, angling in, defended from the crease"
"short of a length, angling in, Wade defends from the crease"
"on a length, pretty straight, watchfully defended. He is playing like a man who wants to come back and bat tomorrow"
and solid in defence again
padded away to short leg as Ashwin bowls into the rough outside leg
"straighter now, makes him play. Starc defends towards mid-off"
and he is back to kicking it away outside leg
"arm ball, pushed through outside off. Another leave. Quite an ordinary last over. Starc will love it if he doesn't have to play at these balls"
"full, just outside leg, defended"
a solid forward-defensive to end a solid day for Australia
"and kicks off a length immediately. Wade has to take the glove off, and is hit high on the bat"
"wide length ball, left alone"
"length ball, a set of stumps wide outside off, left alone"
"wide length ball, another leave"
"well bowled. Gets closer to off, makes him play, and the ball then seams away against the angle. Beaten"
"on a length, closer to off, Wade shimmies down to defend it to point"
"tossed up outside leg, defended off the front foot"
pads this one away
"full, really full, makes him play. Starc misses it, and it goes between his pads"
"byes. Too far outside leg, Starc looks to kick it away, and it goes between his legs and past Saha. Actually not past Saha, through his legs too"
"outside leg again, sweeps this away for a single to deep backwards square"
"full, outside leg, but not too wide. Wade defends it back"
"length ball, into the pads, clipped away to deep midwicket for three runs. Off line here"
"gets his line back to outside off, and Wade defends"
"beaten again. You have to play at the angle once the length ball is close to off. Then it leaves him, and misses the edge"
"wider this time, and Wade shoulders arms"
"moves to off, knows his stumps are covered, and shoulders arms as soon as he sees the line is outside his eye line"
"closer to off, making him play. Wade does so and drives it back to Ishant"
"full, just outside leg, makes him play. Starc defends"
"tries the slog sweep this time, and is beaten. Hit on the thigh pad"
"shorter in length, and defended off the back foot"
"shapes up for the sweep, and the shot is beaten by excessive bounce. He is hit on his shoulder. And he is a tall man"
"full, outside leg, defended to square leg"
"half-volley, just outside leg, pushed to the right of mid-on for one"
Starc plays indecisively at a length ball just outside off. It hits the bottom half of the bat and bounces over the stumps
"down the leg side, and they get a leg-bye"
"length ball, straight, defended to leg"
"on a length, just outside off, makes him play. Defended to mid-on"
"bouncer, down the leg side. Left alone"
"short of a length, just outside off, defended watchfully"
pads one away outside leg
"short of a length, big turn. Starc gets behind it, and aborts any attacking throughts"
"arm ball outside off. Flat, so he goes back, and steers it between slip and gully for a couple"
"looks for the sweep this time, but is beaten and hit on the thigh pad"
"tries another sweep, misses again, and is hit on the pad. If he keeps missing, he is getting hit on the pad so this is not a high-risk shot. India need a short leg to prevent him from doing this. Because then he will be worried about bat-pad"
"<strong>gloved but no silly point in place</strong>. Starc looks to defend a length-ball offbreak that is pitched outside leg. It hits his glove, but falls safely"
"fullish this time, on off, and Wade defends off the front foot"
"that is lucky for Wade. He throws his arms at a length ball outside off, and the edge goes wide of the two slips. <strong>Lead over 60 now</strong>"
"length ball, outside off, allowed to angle through to Saha"
another leave outside off
"short of a length, pitched outside leg, easy runs, two of them past midwicket"
"wide full ball, and Saha does the rest"
"full, outside the leg, defended"
"more sharp turn from outside leg, and it goes for two byes. This one beats Saha to his left"
kicks one away outside leg
"<strong>desperate lbw appeal</strong>. Pitches outside leg, hits a crack, turns the other way, and cannot be given on that"
defends one outside leg
"another offbreak that hits a crack and goes the other way. Pitched outside leg, and Starc lets it hit his pad"
"flat, on a length, defended off the back foot"
"paddle sweep from the stumps, gets a single to fine leg"
"this one is short of a length. The fear of the Starc slog. Starc, meanwhile, punches it into the covers"
"fired in outside off. Wade goes back, and bunts it into the off side for a single. The fielder that would have been there had just moved to plug the paddle sweep"
fired in again. Starc pushes at it outside off. Gets two off a soft but thick outside edge. <strong>Lead over 70 now</strong>
"flat outside off. Starc looks to steer it, and is beaten"
"full, just outside off, and he smothers the turn"
"full and straight, defended back to Ashwin"
"into the pads this time, defended to leg"
down the wicket to look to drive to long-off but can't beat Ashwin
"less turn on this one, and Wade recovers well to defend in front of leg"
no turn. This should excite India but Wade gets his bat down at the last moment
"short of a length, outside off, pushed wide of mid-off for a single"
"<strong>that's a Cowan for Wade</strong>. Sharp turn from off. Hits the pad, and is missing leg"
stays back to defend a length ball
"slower in the air, middle and off, defended to leg"
"tossed up outside off, defended with an open face"
"beautiful shot. Down the wicket, reaches it on a half-volley, and push-drives it between Jadeja and mid-off. All along the ground"
<strong>Starc has reviewed this call immediately</strong>. Given out caught-behind when trying to steer a flat delivery from Ashwin. Beaten. Completely beaten. Nothing on the Ultra Edge. Ashwin can stop celebrating
"full, middle and leg, driven to long-on for one"
"flat, outside off, left alone"
hits the glove on the forward-defensive. Doesn't lob up
down the wicket to push it to long-off for one
"Jadeja missed one chance yesterday when he didn't pick the ball at extra cover, but he has pulled off  a beauty here. Starc slog-sweeps against the turn, Jadeja is at deep midwicket but not all the way back. So he has to judge it, run back, and take it overhead. They look easy on TV but when you have a 360-degree view for these, the way you judge the catch is key, and this is superbly judged"
hard hands on this forward defensive. Goes uppishly but well in front of short leg
pushed wide of cover for one. They don't take the second on the misfield
"full, just outside off, bunted into the leg side for a single"
"tossed up on, on off, O'Keefe moves forward to smother the turn"
forward to defend another length ball from Jadeja
"flat, short, pushed back"
"full, middle and leg, defended back"
misses out. Flat delivery down the leg side. Fails to get a touch on it
tossed up really high and full. Defended back to Ashwin
"short again, and Wade goes back to tuck it past midwicket for one. The number of short balls from Ashwin increasing. Happens with the number of overs he has been made to bow"
"<strong>offbreak that goes the other way</strong>. All down to the rough. This pitch is not getting any easier. Lands in the rough, goes against the desired spin, and beats the outside edge"
"half-volley this time, and push-driven past cover for two"
"<strong>that is close</strong>, given out lbw and Wade has reviewed it immediately. This has turned back sharply against his round-the-wicket angle, from a length and from outside off. Beats the inside edge, hits him in front of off, and would have gone on to hit leg. The decision stays, and Jadeja has his fourth"
"Jadeja is on a hat-trick. Well hang on, Lyon has reviewed it. This looks plumb to naked eye, but I think Lyon thinks he has hit it. Lyon goes for a sweep to a really full and straight ball. He is hit bang in front of middle, but he reckons he has hit the ball. Replays show, though, Lyon hits the pitch with his bat and not the ball. So the on-field call stays. That completes a five-for for the bowler who has bowled the least overs among the specialists"
"on a length, outside off, Hazlewood pushes it defensively for a single to cover"
"flat, quick, punched back to Jadeja"
"<strong>sharp turn</strong>. That's brutish. Length ball, beats the O'Keefe defence, and hits him on the shoulder. That 85 looks like a big lead when you see balls like these"
"flat, outside off, defended"
"full, middle and leg, defended back to him"
solid front-foot defensive from Hazlewood
"full, really full, Hazlewood has a go, and inside-edges it into his pad"
"on a length, outside leg, really slow, and defended back to him"
another forward-defensive from Hazlewood. Deciding against padding these away
defends off the front foot to end the over
"no turn. O'Keefe reacts off the pitch, and manages to keep it out"
too short as he looks for sharp pace. Punched to long-off for one
"on a length, middle and off, defended back to Jadeja"
"Jadeja gets a six-for. Hazlewood looks for the big swipe, and ends up skying it to long-on. Jadeja 6 for 63 in 21.4 overs. Every specialist bowler bowled more than him"
"Starc starts short of a length, and Rahul takes a single to long leg"
"short of a length, swings away, and a nervous poke from Abhinav. <strong>No edge</strong>"
that one goes away like a legcutter. This pitch is crooked. Just that it starts outside off and goes further away. They get a bye
"<strong>has an inside edge saved him</strong>? Yes it has. This is the perfect inswinger, headed for the lower half of the middle stump. Rahul plays straight and that is why he gets an inside edge. Oh there is swing too"
"Starc starts too straight, and this time Rahul glances it away for an easy boundary. How valuable those runs are"
"swing again, hits the inside half of the bat after pitching outside off. Rahul takes a single to wide of mid-on"
starts with a wide outswinger. Wade has to dive to his right to prevent byes
wide outside off again. Left alone. Collected head high by Wade. Takes off a length
"full and straight, and Rahul takes the opportunity to push-drive it between the bowler and mid-on. <strong>Deficit under 80</strong>"
"short of a length, just outside off, opens the face to gully"
"short of a length, straight, and he works it around the corner for one"
Abhinav is off the pair by flicking a straight length ball past midwicket for a couple
"no swing. On a length, outside off, left alone"
"kicks away from short of a length. Rahul does well to leave it alone. This is a quick delivery, and he has to react fast"
"<strong>play and miss</strong>. Loose drive outside off, the ball swings/seams back in to beat the inside edge. Wade is surprised by the bounce, and fumbles to concede a bye"
"yorker, but too wide to make him play. Also it shoots through to Wade, and he does well to get behind it and collect it cleanly"
"<strong>edged</strong>. Abhinav stays back to a length ball that moved away to take a thick edge. Rolls wide of gully, but M Marsh makes a diving save"
"that is the ball that got Abhinav in the first innings. Low full toss on middle and leg, but this Abhinav gets bat on it, and takes four past midwicket. <strong>Deficit under 70 now</strong>"
"just short of a good length, around off, nips back in. Defended"
"wide on the crease, on a length, pushes it off the front foot, gets a single in front of point"
"short of a length, outside off, holds its line, left alone. Wade collects it chest high"
"short of a length, this one goes with the angle and stays low. Abhinav does well to keep it out"
"on a length, at the stumps, pushed to mid-on"

"on a length, angling in, defended off the front foot"
"wide on the crease, angles a length ball in, Rahul defends solidly"
"goes wide on the crease again, angles it too far down the leg, and is tucked away for one past square leg"
"dig in short, Abhinav looks like he wants to duck, but the ball stays low. Goes rib high, but Abhinav recovers well to play it with the bat. Keeps it down"

"on a length, just outside off, defended with an open face"
"slightly short of a length, Abhinav goes back and punches it to short cover"
"drifting in, but still a touch short. Abhinav defends off the back foot"
"short again, punched off the back foot, but Warner at point saves three runs with a full-length dive"
sharp turn from outside off and short of a length. Uppishly flicked to short midwicket
"sharp turn from again, turns past the inside edge and is headed down leg. No shout for lbw"
"short of a length, pushed in front of point. A good call for a single. That is good intent"
"short of a length, outside off, left alone"
low full toss from wide on the crease. Pushed wide of mid-off for a single. Alert running again. India's highest opening partnership this series
"short of a length, down the leg side, Starc lucky to get away with it. Wade dives to right to collect"
"short of a length, into the ribs, no short leg. Mukund keeps it down"
"<strong>top-edged six</strong>. Is this the luck India need? Abhinav has no clue about what has happened. Brutish short ball into the ribs, he just pulls it with hope, and the top edge flies over fine leg"
"slightly short, and Rahul goes back to punch this square on the leg side for one"
"offbreak, just outside off, left alone"
defended off the front foot outside off
sharp turn from just outside off. Left alone
"fuller, flatter, middle and leg, defended back to him"
<strong>how has that missed the off stump?</strong> Abhinav doing his best to replicate Kohli's second-innings effort in Pune. Leaves alone an offbreak just outside off. The ball doesn't turn. It passes the off stump as close as you can without actually giving it a peck
"fired down the leg side, lucky to not concede runs"
"flighted outside off, pushed wide of point for one"
"flighted on middle and leg, flicked to midwicket"
goes back <strong>but this is a shooter</strong>. He does well to keep it out

"short of a length, just outside off, defended off the back foot"
"fuller, just outside off, pushed to cover. Wants a quick run, sent back"
steers a length ball to deep point for one
"bowled him. I said Hazlewood on a cracked pitch with uneven bounce is going to be a handful. He shows it here. Just short of a good length, just outside off, gets the seam movement, hits him plumb in front, but the ricochet flattens the off stump too. He was lbw first but these are recorded as 'bowled'"
"positive start from Pujara. Length ball, straight, and he has worked it away past square leg"
"on a length, outside off, pushed with an open face to deep point for a single"
"sharp turn, appeal for lbw as he beats the inside edge but it has hit him outside the line"
"good running from Rahul, he just drops and runs, and there is no man at cover"
"fuller than that rough patch, and Pujara drives it through cover for two"
<strong>natural variation</strong>. An offbreak that doesn't turn enough. Pujara gets <strong>a thick edge</strong>. It hits Wade's outer pad and lobs up safely. Could have gone anywhere
"<b>bat-pad</b> but doesn't carry to forward short leg. After that last ball Pujara stays back, and this one jumps at him, takes the inside edge, but luckily it doesn't carry"
"too full, pushed to the left of Lyon who fields it with his left hand and throws it back to Wade with the left hand. Powerfully too"

"digs one in short, chest high. Rahul fends it uncomfortably. Manages to keep it down"
"fuller, just outside off, pushed to mid-on"
"nicely played. Plays a length-ball offbreak late, works it between the two short legs"
"<strong>dropped by Smith</strong>. Natural variation. Doesn't turn as much as he expects, and goes off the outside edge. Low chance to his left, but Smith can;t hold on. Nearly sticks there. He has got up early, I think"
stays back to work this short ball to leg for one
"down the wicket, takes this on the half-volley, gets a single to long-on"
"<b>nearly gone again</b>. Down the wicket, not to its pitch, plays with hard hands, and it reaches the diving short midwicket on the half-volley"

"Pujara looks to sway out of that short ball, the ball seams back in and hits his glove and bat handle. Lucky it falls safely"

"kicks at him a touch. Looks like a cutter. Off a length, it hits the bat high. It stays down, though"

"Rahul attempts the sweep and gets outside the line. Beaten, draws half a shout but he is safe"
"flighted outside off, defended with an open face"

"<strong>half-volley to gully</strong>. Loose push away from the body, and the outside edge doesn't carry"
"gets the loose ball and cashes in. Too full, too straight, and Rahul loves it. Glances it for four. Perhaps Hazlewood tried too hard for the lbw there"
"on a length, just outside off, solid front-foot defensive"
"looks to ramp this short ball by swaying out of its line. The ball cuts back in, and that means he is in a tangle. Beaten"

"flat length ball, stays back to defend"

solid front-foot defensive as Lyon loops this again
too short from Lyon and Rahul whips it off the pads. Pujara gets only one ball from Lyon this over
"nicely played by Pujara. Actually he doesn't play it. This one turns and bounces from outside off, and he gets his gloves out of the way and lets hit his thigh pad"

"on a length, on off, defended to mid-off"
"lovely shot. This is full and wide, and he reaches it on a half-volley with his long reach, and crashes it wide of cover. All along the ground. India feeling it now. Crowd getting into it too"
this one stops at him as he looks to drive. Hits the inner half of the bat
"length ball, too straight, clipped past midwicket, 'push' is the shout, and they take a second too"
"on a length, just outside off, leans into a defensive shot"
"<strong>fifty for Rahul</strong>. What a wonderful innings on a pitch that everybody has struggled to bat freely on. All right-hand batsmen have struggled, and the left-hand ones are not scoring fast. Rahul on another plane. Steers this length ball to cover. The crowd rises. He needs to carry on, though"
"how late is he playing. Stays back, watches a length ball closely, and even if it stays low, he works it past short leg"
"slightly short, Pujara works it off the back foot, but he finds the shin of the short leg"
half a shout for lbw but this is turning too much
"another half shout as Pujara is beaten on the defence, but he has got outside the line"
"picks the length early, stays back, works it past backward short leg for one"
"<strong>gets the inside edge</strong>. Soft hands from Rahul, and it is also wide of Warner at leg slip. He puts in a dive to save runs"
"short of a length, and punched to long-off for one"
"oh what a ripper. Smith dropped one earlier, but this is a stunner. Australia needed something like this to pull themselves back into this contest. Full outside off, Rahul drives, gets a thick edge, this is flying wide of slip, but Smith flies to his right, and takes this behind himself. This is one of the best catches given the situation of the match. The Aussies all gather around their leader. The man. Steven Smith"
"cover drive first up, gets a single to deep cover"
"slightly short, Pujara cuts, in front of point, Lyon puts in a dive, but can't control it completely. They get two. <strong>Scores level</strong>"

short from Lyon and he has been picked away for one
stays back to defend a length. Not in that rough patch
"bowls the right length now, draws a forward-defensive from Kohli"

good bounce from just outside off. Hits him high on the bat as he defends
"flighted outside off, defended to mid-on"
down the wicket to defend this to short midwicket
"flat and short, and Pujara picks it early to pull it away. There could be two, but they get only one. Kohli talks to Pujara, and the chirp from behind the wicket goes, 'He is getting angry again.'"
"natural variation. Length ball outside off. He defends, and gets an inside edge for a single. No turn there"
"flat, short, goes back to defend"
some turn there but Kohli right behind it as he defends off the back foot
"flighted outside off, and Kohli leaves it alone after getting a stride in"
"<strong>sharp turn</strong>. Wider on the crease, flatter in the air, draws a forward-defensive from Kohli, and then turns sharply past the bat. O'Keefe appeals but not given. Rightly so"
"this one doesn't turn, but unlike Pune, Kohli is right forward to defend"
"too full, defended easily to short midwicket"
"slightly too short, and he goes back to defend"
"too full, and Pujara down the wicket to drive it to long-on for one"

"goes back to play a length ball, gets a single in front of point"
"full, just outside off, defended back to him"
"too full, Pujara plays it late, dropping it into the leg side for one"
flighted outside off. Teasing him. Kohli doesn't drive
solid front-foot defensive to end the over
right forward to smother the turn. Too full from Lyon
"down the wicket, beaten in the flight, is hit on the pad, but he has got outside the line"
"short again, and punched away off the stumps"
stays back to defend a length ball. Letting it turn and then playing it
"too full, driven to long-on for one"

"too full, Pujara defends to midwicket"
"flat, on a length, middle and off, draws a defensive shot from Pujara"
"short of a length, into the ribs, Kohli moves inside the line and glances this fine of fine leg for a couple"
"<strong>shooter</strong>. Given out lbw immediately. And Kohli has reviewed immediately. Must have hit it. replays show it is very close on whether it hit the pad first or bat. Toe of the bat is close to the ball when the ball hits the pad. This is all too close. It is taking a lot of time to ascertain. Remember the on-field decision is out. Look to me it has grazed the pad before hitting the bat. Only just. The Ultra Edge shows an impact at around the same time. Umpire Kettleborough says 'there is no conclusive evidence to confirm it's bat first'. So we are going to Hawk Eye. And it shows 'umpire's call' on impact. Given on the field, and that call stays. 'No conclusive evidence to say he hit it first.' Those are the words that seal this decision"
"on a length, outside off, defended"
"full, angling in, defended to mid-on"
"short of a length, just outside off, left alone"
<strong>another big appeal for lbw</strong> as this one seams back in from around off. Seams to much. Going down here

"on a length, just outside off, defended"
<strong>another big lbw appeal but still going down</strong>. Hazlewood seaming it in from a length just outside off
"shimmies down the wicket to defend. Wade says, 'Got him to do what we want him to do.' Yes the forward defensive is what Australia want"
stuck on the crease to a length ball. This one doesn't kick but this is where Lyon wants him
draws the forward defensive again. Hits him high on the bat
"tossed up outside off, he kicks it away to draw half a shout"
"flatter, shorter, Pujara goes to pull, but it stays low. <strong>Lucky to get an inside edge</strong>"
"this time Lyon gets bounce. His best over in a long time. Pujara goes back, and it kicks at him. Lobs up but doesn't <strong>carry to backward short leg</strong>. First maiden of the innings"
"that seam does it for Hazlewood. Full, draws a drive, the ball seams back in, and hits the middle of middle. Not a pitch to be driving on. Promoting Jadeja was a good move, but he didn't play well. Australia, I think, didn't play a single drive against the quicks"
Hazlewood on target again. Hits him on the glove. Short of a length. Rahane wrings his hand
"length ball, driven on the up, falls short of mid-on, but this is not the shot to be playing here"
"on a length, on off, Rahane defends off the front foot"
"nicely played. Short of a length, outside off, steered past gully. Lyon misfields at the third man fence - his hand doesn't come down - but the foot behind him saves him. Lucky to save two runs there"
"seam back in off a length, and defends"
"byes straight away. Lyon fires one outside off. Pujara looks to pad it away, but the ball scoots through straight. It beats everything"
full toss. Pujara shimmies down to drive it square on the off side. Eight runs for India in two balls after tea. Every run is important here
"down the wicket, to the pitch of the ball, defends it back to Lyon"
defended off the front foot. That's what Lyon wants him to do
"sharp turn from short of a length, tucks it away. The deep fine leg has been brought in to backward square leg. No run"
forward-defensive to end the over
"length ball down the leg side, tucked away for a single to long leg"
"length ball, outside off, defended to short cover"
defends a length ball off the front foot
"short of a length - seems like it might have slipped out of his hand - short-arm jab to leg, and M Marsh makes a diving save at square leg"
"short of a length, middle and leg, worked away to long leg for one"
driven on the up. Not the thing to do on this pitch. Hit straight to mid-off
"on a length, just outside off, defended off the front foot"
"down the wicket, drives it to Lyon's right, who fields it in the follow-through and throws the ball back to make Pujara dive for safety"
"down the wicket, not to its pitch, has to defend"
"slightly short, and he goes back to punch this to deep midwicket for one. Lyon has to keep bringing him forward"
stays back to defend a length-ball offbreak
"stays back to a length ball, the <strong>ball kicks at him</strong>, and goes quickly over backward short leg. Warner gets a hand to it overhead but you can't call this a drop"
<strong>shooter</strong>. Nearly gets him. Dead in front. Rahane's bat just comes down in time. Off the cue it goes for one
"on a length, just outside off, defended off the front foot"
"short of a length, rising towards the chest, Pujara rides the bounce and keeps it down. Wants a run but is sent back"
"length ball, middle and leg, worked between square leg and midwicket for one"
<strong>shooter again</strong> but this time Rahane is lucky it is outside off stump. Beaten on the bottom edge
punched off the back foot gets a single to deep cover
"full. Rahane looking to sweep, sees the length late, and makes the last-second adjustment to keep this out defensively"
forward-defensive outside off. Lyon wants that
"swept off a length this time. To the left of Hazlewood at long leg, but they take only one. <strong>Lead over 50 now</strong>"
nicely pushed off the front foot. Straight of short midwicket. Gets a single
"pushes at a wide length ball defensively. Gets an inside edge onto the pad, and takes a single. Actually it is pad first but called a run"
"stays back for a length but it bounces at him, and he has to take the bottom hand off to keep it down"
"short of a length, stays a touch low. Rahane does well to defend"
"short of a length, gets the width on it, and Rahane cuts down hard on it. In front of deep point for four"
"on a length, pushed straight of mid-on for one"
<strong>shooter again</strong>. Again Pujara is lucky this is outside off and hasn't cut back in
"short of a length, middle and leg, worked to leg"
"on a length, outside off, Pujara defends off the front foot"
"tossed up outside off, defended off the front foot"
"<strong>turning too much</strong>. From a length from wide outside off, it comes in to hit him in front of leg"
"swept away off a length, gets a single to long leg"
"stabs at it in front of his body, and he is lucky this has gone straight of short leg and hasn't carried to short midwicket"
"too full, easy to smother the turn on that"
sharp turn and some dip from outside off. Hits him in the midriff but he has got outside the line
"short of a length, outside off, dabbed to gully on the bounce"
this one stays low but Rahane is equal to it. From short of a length and with the angle
"short of a length, angling in, pretty straight. Rahane gets across the line and works this to fine leg for one"
"goes for the yorker, bowls a half-volley on the pads, but Pujara can't beat short midwicket"

"on a length, outside off, pushed with an open face. Gets a single"
"short of a length, punched to deep cover for one"
"looks to cut, the ball stays low, hits the under half"

stays back to defend
"flighted on off, and he presses forward to smother the turn"
"another forward-defensive, not to its pitch, and is hit high on the bat"
"good length ball, outside off, from around the wicket, Pujara covers his stumps and leaves"
"a little shorter and outside off, he carves it to cover"
"looks for the short ball, targeting the body, but the line slides down leg. Pujara glances it fine"
"goes wide of the crease for a full, straight delivery at 143 kph. Rahane whips it to long leg. Lovely roll of the wrists"
"firm, straight bat meets a 143 kph fuller delivery on middle. Good batting"
"nicely done, and a good call for a single behind point. Rahane presses forward to a good length delivery outside off, but ensures he plays late and allow the ball to come to him. Angles the bat to pick the gap"
"that's tight. The pace is quicker, the length is full, the idea is to get Rahane lbw pad before bat. This time though its bat before pad"
"lunges forward, ever intent to push his pad outside the line of off stump as he defends a full ball on off"
"meets a tossed up delivery on off stump with a gentle, straight-faced bat"
"loops it up, a little wider as well, and Rahane drives a little more forcefully to cover"
"puts bat in front of pad to make sure a full delivery, sliding onto middle and leg is kept out"
"good work at cover, Warner diving to his left. Rahane gets an overpitched delivery outside off but his drive isn't quite strong enough"
"starts with a back of a length delivery on off stump, Pujara gets up on his toes to blunt it"
"that's a bit of legcutter, on middle and off, Pujara defends"
"into the pads, looking for that legcutter again, Pujara clips it to the short midwicket"
"<b>that's too much movement for the lbw shout</b>. It has everything else going for it - sharp cut off the pitch as the good length ball hits the seam. Keeps low as well, having hit a crack. Pujara is no match for it because it changes direction so so late. The bat is on off stump, he is struck on leg, would be going down"
"back of a length and outside off, dabs it into the covers"
"on leg stump again, Pujara's weight his forward, his bat is straight, and at the last second he rolls his wrists for a single in front of square leg"
"tosses it up on middle, Pujara smothers it"
"<b>oooh</b>, he isn't to the pitch of this flighted delivery and it kicks up a bit to hit the shoulder of Pujara's bat as he defends. No short leg"
"presses forward to block a fuller delivery on middle, gets an inside edge past Handscomb under the lid"
"good length ball on off stump, defends. Handscomb is at silly point for Rahane"
"<b>slides on</b>, and Rahane pushing back to try and force the ball into the off side, has to worry about his sticks. Luckily he didn't go full horizontal bat and is able get an inside edge onto pad"
pushes to the left of the bowler. Batting still ain't easy
waits on a shortish delivery on middle and taps it to the right of short midwicket
puts a straight bat in front of a shortish delivery on off stump. Doesn't quite come on as quickly as he thinks
"cuts back in off the deck, but with the length being short, he is able to adjust to the movement, pull the top hand off and nudge the ball down on the leg side"
"shortish on middle and leg, defends"
"the inward movement he is getting is working against him a bit because he has to bowl straight - to exploit the variable bounce. Occasionally it goes down leg, like now, and Pujara, by virtue of playing late, finds runs at long leg"
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
"<b>beats him on the outside edge</b> as a quicker delivery pitches and turns. Pujara is playing for the straighter one, which isn't the worst ploy"
"<b>massive appeal for lbw</b>. Is it pad first? The umpire give it runs and Illingworth's right. It's all bat, in fact, for a single behind square leg. Stil the danger for a batsman is apparent. This is a good length ball that skittles into the right-hander, who is setting up to make room and punch into the off side. <b>India have a lead of 70</b>"
"tosses it up on middle and off, defends"
"slides onto middle and leg, Rahane slinks back and ticks it down"
leans forward to a flighted delivery outside off and keeps it out
"tosses it up outside off, offers no shot"

"digs it in short and Pujara, seeing that its bouncing properly, ducks"
"pulls the bottom hand back, to handle a back of a length delivery that kicks up a bit on middle and off"
gets in line with a shortish delivery on off stump and walks off to indulge in a well-earned drink
"a bit too full for his first ball, and Rahane eases it through the gap at cover"
"picks the length as short early, and then thumps it with a straight bat to the bowler's right. Lyon gets across to it"
"a touch of indecision there, with Pujara possibly thinking about advancing. In the end, perhaps Lyon's quicker pace, makes him defend from the crease"
"this time he does come down, and almost yorks himself outside off. Those lovely wrists bail him out though, with a whip to long-on"
"does well to pick up a couple through point, because he pushes it with a straight bat, and not the horizontal one. Still the ball is turning and bouncing out of that  5 m area outside off stump"
shifts back on middle and leg and nudges the offbreak away harmlessly
"neat little late cut to third man. Hangs back against the shortish delivery, watches the ball all the way onto his bat, which he angles to make sure the ball goes down first - because there is a slip - and then past Smith because he is superman in the field"
"back of a length and outside off, cuts behind point"
"shortish and outside off, carves it through point to bring up the <b>fifty partnership</b>"
"good length on off stump, defends to cover"
<b>grubber</b>! But Pujara is able to spear his bat down sharply enough that he is able to save his middle stump. Never can feel in on this pitch
"fuller delivery on off stump, Pujara works it, on the up, with an exaggerated roll of his wrists because it bounces a touch, to mid-on"
tosses it up onto middle and off - he gets drift away - Rahane blocks with bat in front of pad
"superb sweep. It seems almost too full for the shot, but Rahane benefits one by standing on off stump - which means the chances of his being lbw is limited while playing this short - and two by not overhitting"
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
"another good shot, this against the spin through the covers. The Bengaluru crowd finds its voice as they watch a fluent drive to an overpitched ball"
"leg slip saves Australia some runs, Warner sharp there. Gets low quickly and covers a proper lap sweep from Rahane. Poor ball, going down leg, lucky to be a dot"
"<b>extra bounce</b>. Even after being in no rhythm in that over, he pulls off his beauty. It pitches on a good length outside off and leaps past the bat onto Rahane's glove. All of this happens rather slowly off the deck though"
"back of a length and outside off, that's paradise for a batsman here, he can leave those without a thought"
lays into a cover drive - forget that he is hitting on the up. Warner at short cover moves to his left and saves a boundary. Rahane can go for this shot because the line is outside off
"fuller delivery on off stump, defends"
"goes wide of the crease for a shortish delivery on middle and off. Rahane defends with soft hands. And for good measure, yanks the bottom one off"
gets a gimme ball - short and wide outside off - but his fierce cut shot is half-stopped by Handscomb at point. Saved two runs

pushes forward to a full delivery on off stump and blocks
"he's hit one of the close-in fielders on the leg side with a full-blooded sweep. Handscomb, the man in the firing line, but he stays in line, crouching low. Brave"
sharp turn and bounce from outside off - the 5m mark from which he caused so much problems in the first innings - here Rahane is shuffling across to block and suddenly realises he should pull his bat and gloves away because of the <B>huge bounce</b>. Warner has to dive to his right to stop the ball running away to the boundary

plants the bat in line with a tossed up ball on middle stump
"<b>India have a lead of over 100</b> as Lyon drifts into the pads and Pujara sends it away with a little leg glance. Hazlewood is the man chasing it, and even as he slides and tries to push the ball back, his knee touches the advertising skirting"

"shifts back to a quicker, length ball on off stump and whips it through midwicket"

"<b>so close</b> to lbw again. It's the slider from SOK, coming in with the arm, onto off stump. Rahane defends and just manages to make contact with bat first"
"that's a top shot. He leaps back, reading the length quickly, and then nails the flick shot through midwicket. Brilliant hit, made possible by his decisive footwork"

"<b>sharp bounce</b>. Pujara is set up to defend a good length ball, but is suddenly met with one that comes up towards his rips. Goes off his glove, but doesn't carry to short leg"
"<b>another toughie</b>. Hits a good length outside off and spits up at Pujara, who has to change tactics from a flick shot to now playing with softer hands and making sure it falls down harmlessly by his feet"
"comes down the track, yorks himself on leg stump, pushes it back to the bowler"
brings a straight bat down in line with a length ball on middle and off
"<b>wild turn</b>. For the longest time, O'Keefe was simply getting the ball to hold its line on off stump or slide on with the arm to middle. This one rips past the outside edge of Rahane's bat as he pushes forward."
"good length ball, pitching outside off, turning further away. Leaves it"
"half-volley on off stump, drills it to silly point"

races down to the pitch of the ball and whips it from outside off to long-on. Good shot. Good footwork
"goes straight on with the arm, with Lyon shifting around the wicket. Rahane waits, opens the face and it's all because of his soft hands that he handles it all so well"
"shortish delivery on middle and leg, bounces sharply, and turns a bit more than Rahane expects. A little inside edge, but no silly point, where the ball balloons"

"down the leg side, and he misses out on a glance"
"what a shot from Ashwin. is that a statement or what? Wide length ball, and he drives on the up, and smacks it in front of deep point for four. In hindsight, not the best of shots, just throwing his hands at it"

"<strong>stays low</strong>, hits him in front, they get an lbw shout, not given, and Wade doesn't the chances on the review. Hazlewood bowls wide of the crease, and hence it is missing leg"
"what has Yadav done here? There is Saha with you, just bat with him. Loose shot. Swings hard at a length ball. No way you can be driving this. Hits the bat high, and goes to mid-off for an easy catch"
"<strong>beaten</strong>. On a length, holds its line outside off. He pokes at it, and is beaten"
legcutter. Not that he means to. Just kicks away from a length outside off. Ishant leaves it alone
"straight length ball, Ishant plays it with a straight bat. It goes into the leg side but Saha turns down the single"
"pitched outside leg, hits the pad, draws half a shout"
"full toss outside off, hit straight to deep point. Will get only one so he turns it down"
"another low full toss outside off, again Saha turns down a single"
"bouncer from Starc this time. This one stays a touch low, but the good part is Saha is not ducking. He is just trying to stay inside the line. Low bounce not a problem"
"on a length, Saha winds up big, and the ball cuts away to make sure Saha can't play a big shot. Defended"
and yes it is a bouncer. Saha hooks and is beaten. Hazlewood now has Ishant Sharma in his sights
"on a length, angling in towards off and middle. Ishant does well with the defence. The back lift is low. Better than Yadav"
"length ball outside off, stays low, but Sharma's low back lift means he brings the bat down in time"
tries the short ball. It hits the pitch and goes down leg. Wade dives full length to prevent byes
Hazlewood back to bowling a length just outside off. Sharma does well to defend again
"<strong>short, and Sharma fends</strong>. In front of his chest. Sharma gets tall, rides the bounce, and manages to keep this down"
"<strong>the lbw ball</strong>. Hazlewood goes wide on the crease, angles a length ball. It stays low. Everybody is excited, but Sharma defends solidly. Brings the bat down just in time"
"length ball, angling into the pads, hit straight to deep square leg. They don't take the single"
dug in short. Stays low. Dabbed to deep point and they turn down the single again
"goes for the yorker, ends up bowling a low full toss, dug out to deep midwicket. Again the single is turned down"
"short of a length, just outside off, Saha opens the face, is beaten"
"swinging yorker, hits the toe, but is missing leg"
"Starc tries to bluff him with a full ball, but Saha is doing this well. He is prepared for the bluff, and chips this over mid-off for four valuable runs"
whoa. This might just be the first time Sharma has swept a ball. From that high. And he has nailed this. Gets four through square leg
now he bunts this past short leg for one. How impressive is Ishant Sharma. Never throws his wicket way. Now can Saha hit Lyon?
"full toss outside leg, and Saha misses put. Gets just a single to short fine leg"
"<strong>the offbreak that doesn't turn</strong>. Sharma defends for the turn, and it beats the outside edge"
"big step down the wicket, hit on the pad, and given not out. He has got outside the line"
"turning into the pads, and beats the inside edge to lob up to backward short leg. Only half a shout"
Lyon saves four runs. Saha gets a thick edge fine of third man. He should have run for this because there was no way they could have prevented the second. Lyon puts in a dive. <strong>Saha makes his first errors</strong>
"short of a length, just outside off, defended from the crease"
"on a length, angling in, worked to leg. No run again"
"full, outside off, defended off the front foot, and he takes a single with two balls to go. Saha showing a little more faith in Sharma now"
"on a length, cuts back in, defended from the crease"
"down the leg side, and Sharma survives"
"looks to shimmy down, Lyon bowls flat, he opens the face. Saha doesn't want to the single, but he gives in to Ishant who is haring up to his end"
shaping up for a sweep. Lyon bowls it really full. Ishant pulls out and defends
"quick, almost seam-up delivery, punched to deep midwicket for one"
goes back to steer a flat delivery to third man and takes the single
"full, outside off, Ishant gets forward to smother the turn"
"gets the offbreak on a length, but it hits the inside half of the bat and doesn't pop up"
"full outside off, driven to deep cover. No single"
"short of a length, gets high to hit his glove. Saha not in pain"
"on a length, on off, played to deep cover. No single again"
"on a length, straight, and Saha takes the single this time"
"bouncer, at his adam's apple. Ishant ducks it"
"<b>celebrappeal from Hazlewood as this one stays low to hit Ishant on the knee roll</b>. Not given, and Australia review it. Hazlewood so sure he starts celebrating right away. This is oh so close. There is an umpire's call on the leg stump. I would say 49% of the ball was hitting the leg stump there. The not-out call stays"
"sweeps first up, and takes the single"
"pitched up, driven into the shins of the silly point"
right forward to defend a quick full ball
"flat, short, some turn, and Ishant defends off the back foot"
"too full, and Ishant smothers the turn"
"full, slow, high, and Ishant defends it. Applause from the crowd. They are right into it"
"short of a length, into the body, tucked away, but doesn't take the single"
"<strong>this nearly takes the glove and the off stump</strong>. It kicks off from just short of a length, hits the glove as he takes it hand off, and then it nearly rolls on to the stumps"
"short of a length, into the body, worked to leg, and he turns down the single"
kicks at him from short of a length again. Saha arches back and manages to keep this down
"<strong>Warner flies to nearly take an impossible catch</strong>, and there is a run-out appeal too. All happening. Saha looks to pull, gets the toe end, Warner flies from mid-off, miraculously he gets a touch on that, and knocks it to mid-on. Ishant is wandering somewhere and is sent back. He plonks his bat as opposed to sliding, but he does so just in the nick of time"
"slower short ball, and beats his pull to keep Ishant on strike for the next over"
"Ishant will be disappointed after having shown so much of application. Loose drive to a length ball, and it chips to short cover for a catch"
"first ball stays low, Warner pushes at it, steers to deep point for a single first up"
"short of a length, just outside off, hits a crack, seams away, reaches Saha on a half-volley"
"wide length ball, kicks away from a crack. Called a wide. They decide against running off a Saha fumble"
"four lucky runs. Ishant gets the length right, draws a poke out of Renshaw, who uses his soft hands, and the edge goes wide of second slip. Wouldn't have carried to third slip"
"on a length, outside off, left alone. Saha collects this one head high"
"straight length ball, Renshaw does well to keep it out"
"on a length, just outside off, solidly defended off the front foot"
"four byes. This is pitched up outside leg, Warner pads up, the ball hits a crack and goes the other way like a legbreak. Saha has no chance"
looks to sweep fine from outside leg. Beaten. There is a short fine leg in place for that shot
"down the wicket, reaches the ball on a half-volley, and steals a single to mid-on. And the man is Jadeja so this has to be really quick running"
"looks to pad one up, the ball turns big, and he defends. Good to see a second line of defence too. Unlike Warner in the first innings"
"full, middle and leg, draws an on-drive, draws a leading edge that dies. They get a single to cover"
"short of a length, outside leg, bunted around the corner for a single"
"length ball, just outside off, defended solidly. Better angle for Ishant"
"short of a length, stays low, into the pads, and he has worked it past short midwicket. They think of a third, but decide against it. Rightly"
"length ball, angling in, defended back to him"
"superb punch shot down the ground. Length ball, angling in, hits the middle of the tree trunk that Warner carries. Goes straight of mid-on for three. No follow-through. Just an intentful defence"
"<strong>big big shout for catch at the wicket but this ball is just too good to take the edge</strong>. On a length, holds its line, Renshaw is squared up, beaten on the outside edge, and this hits the back pad. Even on lbw this is a close close shout. Might have returned umpire's call on whether the impact was in line. India don't review it"
front-foot defensive to end the over
"Warner looks for the big slog, and it goes off the inside half to square leg"
"<strong>nearly a repeat of the first-innings dismissal</strong>. Dip, turn from outside leg, beats the outside edge, and somehow misses the off stump"
<strong>sharp turn</strong>. Warner squared up again. Gets a thick outside edge. Doesn't carry to gully
"<strong>again nearly that first-innings dismissal</strong>. Again dips on him, and makes him play. The ball turns sharply from outside leg, kisses the back pad and goes for four. Called byes but should have been leg byes"
"flat, quick, and Warner defends to leg"
"full, outside leg, and kicked away by Warner"
"full, on off, defended to mid-on"
"wide length ball, left alone"
"Renshaw is walking. Ishant strikes. This has taken off from a crack. A length ball, angling in to Renshaw, who has to play the angle, but the ball kicks off and leaves him a touch. Takes the glove on the way. India are back into this"
"<strong>big big lbw shout first up</strong>. Cuts back in from outside off, but hits Smith on the thigh pad. Too high"
"<strong>too good</strong>. Makes Smith play the angle on a length ball, and the ball cuts away to beat the outside edge. Too good to take the edge. Again the cracks at play"
"short of a length, angling in, defended back to Ishant"
<strong>reverse-sweep</strong>. Beaten. The ball rolls back to him
"tossed up outside leg, kicked away"
again pads one away as Ashwin pitches it outside leg
"shapes up for the sweep, looks to withdraw, but the ball bounces and hits the bat as opposed to bat hitting ball, and goes for a single to square leg"
"swept away first up. Gets it a touch too full, and he sweeps it through midwicket. This is not his favourite shot, mind you. What adjustments he has made"
"full and wide, looks to go mid-on, gets a thick leading edge through cover for two"
"short of a length, outside off, runs this wide of gully for a single"
"wide length ball, Smith shuffles and defends"
"on a length, angling in, Smith shuffles across, he is plumb if he misses, but the bat comes down in time"
"short of a length, outside off, punched away, but straight to cover"
"on a length, outside off, pushed straight of cover and wide of mid-off for a single"
"on a length, just outside off, defended to mid-off"
flight and dip. Smith defends this back to Ashwin
sharp turn and low bounce. Smith watches it till the last moment and keeps it it out
"shorter this time, and punched to deep midwicket for one"
"looks for a big fine sweep from outside leg, gets some bat for a single to fine of short fine leg. Actually a leg-bye"
"too full, driven to long-on for one"
"Warne takes Ashwin on. That is a big risk but he has pulled it off. This is a really difficult pitch to loft an offspinner over mid-on for six. You have to be right to the pitch of the ball. Warner does it. Jumping out of the crease, taking this on the half-volley, and lofts him over wide long-on for a six against the turn. It looks ugly if it fails. That's all I can say about this daredevilry"
"holds its line outside off, gets a thick outside edge that dies right down. Rahane dives to his right at gully. Saves four"
"short of a length, outside off, pushes this to the left of short cover and steals a single"
"short, into the body, tucked away towards deep backward square leg for a single"
"on a length, outside off, straightens to hit the outside half of the bat and goes to point"
"<strong>Saha saves four</strong>. Shooter from Ishant, hits the toe, seems to be going between keeper and slip nbut Saha gets a full-length dive in"
"<strong>too good from Ishant</strong>. Good on Smith too to pull the bat out of the way. This is a length ball that hits a crack and goes against the angle. Smith has been good at playing the line this series, but this time he withdraws inwards. Beaten. Not nicked. That's all that matters now"
"lbw first ball. Long long chat, and they decide to review. Warner doesn't look convinced, but he has reviewed it. Warner has picked a ball too full to sweep and is beaten. The question is, has he got an edge or has it straightened enough? This is pitched outside off, the ball has straightened, and I don't see any part of ball in line. However, the machine is showing 'umpire's call'. I don't know how. I must be wrong, but I will need an explanation from somebody here. Don't see any part of ball in line. They show umpire's call. Both on impact and the stumps. On many more replays, perhaps one mm of the ball hit him in line. Oof"
"full, on off, pushed to cover"
"no turn, hits the inside half of the bat, and goes for a single"
"sharp turn, hits the pad, but has hit him outside the line"
"sharp turn again, defended to leg, keeps it down"
"more sharp turn, and he lets it turn and bounce, and then turns his wrists to take a single through backward square leg"
"short, wide, cut away to deep point for one"
"short of a length, kicks at him, Marsh manages to keep it down with an open face. Takes a single past gully"
"<strong>dropped by Kohli at slip</strong>. He drops quite a few there. Although this is a really difficult chance. Kohli is wide at slip. Smith is squared up for an edge that would be a regulation chance at first slip. Kohli dives to his left, gets a hand to it, but fails to latch on"
"gets inside the line to bunt this short ball into the leg side, and steals a second, picking on Pujara"
"short of a length, outside off, steered to deep point for one"
"short of a length, stays low, hits the toe, into the pad"
"down the wicket, gets a soft leading edge back towards the bowler"

"flat, on a length, just outside off, defended back to Ashwin"
"<strong>the lbw ball</strong>. No turn, no bounce. Marsh is on the back foot. The bat comes down just in time"
"lovely shot. Down the wicket, reaches this on the half-volley, and drives this with an open face. Always in control of it, and all along the ground. Beats cover to his right"
"gets away with a full toss. Hit straight to mid-on. Just wide of it, actually, and gets a single. This one should have been punished for four"
"on a length, on off, defended back to him"
"on a length, outside off, defended by Marsh. Bowled at 95ks"
"fuller, closer to Marsh, defended back to him. Only 74ks"

"quick, sharp, fizzing. Marsh plays for the turn, this one goes straight through, and beats the outside edge"
"short of a length, straight, defended back to him"
"shimmies down, beaten in the flight, gets into a tangle. Lets it hit the thigh pad"
"poor ball. Ashwin drops short and wide, and he goes back to cut it for four. Can't have fields for these bad balls"
"full and straight, pushed to short midwicket"
stays back and defends. Watching like a hawk. Makes the adjustment as the ball doesn't turn
"short of a length, straight, whipped away off the pads for a single to deep square leg"
"full, on off, no turn, runs off the inside edge to deep square leg for one"
<strong>beats him</strong>. Holds its line against the angle after pitching on a length. Too good to take the edge
"short of a length, angling in, dabbed wide of cover-point for a single"
"short of a length, on off, Smith shuffles across to defend"
"full and straight, always excites a bowler with the batsman staying back and moving across. Smith's bat, though, comes down in time, and gets a single to leg"
"length ball, angling in, Marsh defends from the crease"
"<strong>no shot offered</strong> and given. This is short of a length, hits a crack, and comes back in. Given out on the field, Marsh and Smith have a long chat. They are both unsure, but because they have only one review left, they don't take the final challenge. Had the Warner review not been erased, Australia would have definitely challenged this. <b>This would have missed by a long way</b>. Finally Australia have made a DRS review. How much of a difference has that proverbial mm in the Warner decision made?"
"fired down the leg side, he misses out on easy runs"
"into the pads again, worked away for one"
"full, on off, defended"
solid front-foot defensive
"tossed up outside off, left alone"
"fired in quick, hits the inside edge of the forward-defensive bat"
"on a length, straight, worked to leg for one"
"full, just outside off, pushed with an open face to deep point for one"
"short of a length, just outside off, defended off the back foot"
"<strong>grubber</strong>. Short of a length, skids through, angles in, is headed for his pads in front of middle, but Smith is watching it like a hawk, and his bat comes down in time"
<strong>inside edge saves him</strong>. Again the ball stays low and kicks back in. He gets an edge onto the pad. No back lift here
"full and straight, Smith is shuffling across, <strong>everybody is excited</strong>, and his bat comes down in time again"
"length ball into the pads, defended to midwicket"
"full, on the pads, defended back again"
"on a length, no turn, straight, hits the inside edge, avoids short leg"
"slows it down, on a length, middle and leg, defended to leg"
sharp turn this time but from outside off. Handscomb doesn't play at this one
"fullish, uses his wrists to keep this down and get a single to deepish mid-on"
slight shimmy down the wicket to defend a short-of-a-length delivery
"down the wicket, and misses out on a length ball well down the leg side"
"kicks off short of a length, hits him in the midriff as he is walking down the wicket. Hurt but not defeated"
still charging down. Umesh bowls down the leg side again. No run

"on a length, just outside off, defended in front of his body"
"length ball, middle and leg, defended with soft hands"
"down the wicket, takes this on the half-volley, finds midwicket"

"goes for the yorker, bowls full on toes, and is clipped away past square leg"
"short of a length, just outside off, steered towards deep point for one"
"it needed something like this to get Smith out. A grubber to end all grubbers. This is short of a length, and doesn't leave the ground at at all. Hits him on the boot almost. Bang in front of middle. No doubt about that decision. This would have almost bounced twice before reaching the stumps. Smith has a chat with the non-striker, he also looks at the change room for a clue, but the umpires stop him. And even as the umpire prevents him from doing it, Kohli also intervenes. Umpire Llong tells Kohli also not to butt in"
"short of a length, regulation bounce, defends"
"length ball, looks for the drive, gets a thick inside edge for a single to long leg"
"<strong>too good to take the edge</strong>. Unplayable delivery. Length ball, outside off, hits an edge, cuts away, misses everything"
"wide length ball, driven to cover. Doesn't get a single"
sharp turn from a full length now. Marsh doesn't play at it
"fast, on a length, angling in, hits him in the thigh pad"
"full, on off, turns away to hit the outside edge and roll to point"
"<b>that looks plumb</b>, India appeal big time, but not given on the field. Kohli has a long chat and reviews this. Jadeja has bowled this flat, Marsh is on the back foot, is beaten on the inside edge and is hit just over the flap of the back pad. The replays return an umpire's call on height on the leg stump. Saved by the skin of his teeth"
"similar delivery, aiming at that lbw, but Marsh gets the bat down this time"
"on a length, angling in, middle and leg, defended to short midwicket"
down the wicket to defend a length ball that is swinging back in
"wide length ball. He throws his hands at it. Drives it square for a four. That quietens the crowd a little, but there is a long long way to go"
"length ball, stays low, headed for off, and Handscomb defends off the back foot"
"full, into the pads, clipped away for a single to deep square leg"
"lovely shot. Driven on the up, all along the ground, through cover for four. Risky, but perhaps they need to take a bit of risk because India are not letting them breathe at the moment"
"flighted on off, smothered"
"quicker, on a length, no turn, hits the inside edge onto the toe"
"flighted outside off, defended to short straight cover"

"full, just outside off, runs this towards deep point with a slightly open face. Gets a single"
lovely shot. A touch too full. Marsh punches this hard. Straight of mid-on. Sizzles away to the boundary. Straight of mid-on
"on a length, tails back in, driven to mid-on. 'Hard hands,' shouts some Indian fielder"
gets the length right now. Tailing back into off. Marsh defends from the crease
"nicely played. Slightly short of a length, holds its line, but Marsh watches it till late, and then opens the face at the last moment to guide it between slip and gully. Keeps it down"
"down the track, takes this on the half-volley, places it to the right of short midwicket, and also right of cow corner. <strong>Gets a couple to bring up the 100 for Australia</strong>. Under 90 required now. Warner applauds"
"leaves the crease again, drives to mid--off. Beaten in the flight, that's why he doesn't look for the cover gap"
"slight shimmy again, defends to short midwicket"
"down the wicket, beaten in flight, lets the ball turn, works it past backward short leg for one"
"sharp turn from outside off, defended off the inside edge"
"this is how Lyon took all those wickets in the first innings. Marsh goes back to a length ball, the ball kicks and jumps, he follows it with his hands and gloves it onto his thigh pad. Nair at short leg is so exited he starts celebrating before taking the catch. His hands flick his helmet as they go up to complete the catch, but the ball is a long way from the helmet"
"flighted on off, defended back to him"
"full, middle and leg, smothers the turn off the front foot"
"tossed up on off, right to its pitch and defends"

"flighted on middle and leg, defended"
"looks for a big drive on a wide half-volley. Hits the crack, beats everything, and hits Saha's toe"
middle and leg now. Defends
stays back to defend a flat ball. Everybody excited
"And Jadeja and Ashwin have produced another wicket before tea. Saha takes a great catch too. An offbreak on off. Wade plays for the turn. The ball doesn't turn, hits the inside edge onto the pad and lobs towards the vacant short leg. Saha dives full length. Nay he flies. Takes it with both hands"
"on a length, Starc well forward to defend it"
"short of a length, wide, steered to third man for one"
"length ball, angling in, pushed past midwicket for one"
"on a length, middle and leg, pushed to mid-on"
"short of a length, straight, defended back to him"
"full and straight, pushed back to him"
"length ball, middle and leg, clipped to midwicket. Too straight, but he has a fielder in place for that"
"full, on off, defended back to him"
jumps at him from a length. Lucky it doesn't pop up for a catch at short leg. There is no short leg in fact
stays low. Stac stays back to defend
"full ball, no turn, and India are three strikes away. Natural variation again. Starc defends for the turn, but there is no turn on this offbreak, and he has had his off stump pegged back. Off the underarm too. India ecstatic. The jack in the box gone. Credit to Ashwin, watching the replay. This is the topspinner with the seam upright"
shimmies down to defend this
"full, outside off, defended off the front foot"
"short of a length, seams back in, defended from the crease"
"on a length, on off, stays back to defend"
defends a length ball to leg
"short of a length, straight, defended to short leg"
"short of a length, on target, no room, defended off the back foot"
"short of a length again, this one kicks up at him, and hits him on the glove"
full outside off. Forward defensive. Gets a single off the outside half of the bat
"on a length, turns back in, Handscomb lets it turn and works it past short leg for one"
"full, outside off, too full, and defended easily"
"sharp turn from a length, worked to square leg. <strong>Hesitation there</strong>, and nearly run out at the non-striker's. Throw from square leg is wide"
<strong>is this the carrom ball?</strong>. No this is a flat-seam offbreak that doesn't turn. Beats the outside edge. Ashwin now showing all his wares
"moves across to a sharp offbreak, works it past short leg for ne"
"full, on the pads, clipped away to deep square leg for one"
"short of a length, straight, flicked to square leg"

down the wicket and drives it back to Ashwin
down the wicket to defend a flighted off break
"down the wicket again, the ball dips on him, and he has to defend this to leg"
looks to sweep. Ashwin pushes one through flat. Handscomb is beaten but he gets outside the line
"full, middle and leg, played back to Jadeja"
"Jadeja too good. He has created many wickets today, but now he gets one in his own ledger. O'Keefe plays a forward defensive to a length ball. The ball hits a crack, refuses to turn or bounce. It rolls along the ground to hit the stump mic on the middle stump. India two wickets away"
stays back to defend a flat delivery
pushes forward to a defensive shot
"length ball, angling in, defended off the inside half of the bat"
expansive drive outside off. The thick edge falls short of cover
"tossed up on off, driven back to Ashwin"
"that's a 25th five-for for Ashwin. Is this another topspinner? No it is a regulation offbreak. Handscomb tries something desperate with only tail for company. Jumps out of the crease, doesn't get to the pitch of it, and hence tries a slog. The ball, though, explodes from the pitch and stands up to take a massive edge for Saha to claim running a few metres back"
Lyon gets off the pair with a thick outside edge past slip
"Ashwin ends it with a return catch and throws the ball to the moon. Classic offspinners' dismissal to get the rival offspinner out. Tosses this up outside off, draws a drive, beats him in flight and accepts the catch himself"
