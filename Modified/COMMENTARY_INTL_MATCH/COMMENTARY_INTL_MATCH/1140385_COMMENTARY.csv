"swing first up, but a confident prod to mid on by Burns"
"good line outside off, defended again"
the embers of Jerusalem ripple through the Galle air as Burns gets up and away. And the outfield's in decent nick too. On the pads and flicked in style through mid-wicket
"on off again, and a confident defence"

"again on off, Burns in no mood to attack just yet"
"oh hello! Lovely footwork from Burns, down the track. And oh dear, the bobble takes the ball over Herath at mid on and away for four"
"<strong>indecision!</strong> Good rotation of the strike, but there was a moment's hesitation"
"proddingtons from Jennings, who gets his front foot forward and defends"
"a smidgen short, and Jennings plays this to point. A hint of spin"
"solid line and length, Burns pushes this back to Lakmal"
"<strong>edged, but just short of slip.</strong> Played with soft hands, and the lack of pace in the pitch also means this doesn't carry"
"<strong>no such luck this time! </strong>Strangled down leg. Swing from Lakmal, on a good length, and Burns thinks this is easy runs. Doesn't get enough of it though and it's a good take by Dickwella. End of Burns' first Test knock."
"<strong>what a ripper! Two in two!</strong> That's sexy from Suranga. Round the wicket straight away, wide of the crease, and he's made Moeen Ali's off stump take a vacation. What a start for the hosts!"
"terrific delivery, honing in on off. Root solidly defends"
"in that corridor, and Root's not interested. What an over for Lakmal."

"a touch more solid from Jennings that time, pushing a full ball to point"

"back of a length, defended solidly"
"<strong>ooh, risky from Root</strong>. A hint of swing, Root goes for the drive but gets the inside edge. Fortunately for him, it's into the pads, and not leg stump"
full this time and solidly punched back to Lakmal
"nice, very nice. Nothing wrong with the delivery, pitching it up, but Root confidently punches it down the ground and it scurries away for four"
"back of a length on the hips, and that's good running, as they realise the two is on"
"<strong>reverse sweep ahoy!</strong> Expect to see plenty of those this series. There's a gully in place, but Jennings has the confidence to crash that away"
pushed to cover as Dilruwan aims this on middle. A smidgen of turn there
more solid defence. Jennings slowly growing into his innings
too full and driven with gusto. Big stride and scythed through point

"<strong>edged</strong>, but doesn't carry. Spin on offer already for Dilruwan"
"back of a length, Root defends into gully. A loud no from the skipper"
"a hint of movement back in, defended again"
good probing line and defended back. Lakmal not giving Root a buffet ball for him to tuck into
"class in a biscuit tin! Full and with too much width, and Root unfurls a doozy of a cover drive. Glorious to watch"
good riposte. Full again and Root's caught on the crease. Just about manages to get his bat on that
"more runs for Root, as he plays this outside off delivery with soft hands and gets it through the gully area and away for four. Amidst the choppy waters, Root is starting to guide the visitors to the safety of port. A <em>long</em> way to go though."
Jennings sweeps him straight away. Ricochets off short leg's legs and away for a single
"turn on offer, and it's pushed round the corner"
"plenty of turn from back of a length. Revs from off to leg, Root leaves"
"misses out on a boundary. Shortish once more, Root brings out the pull, but hits it straight to the man"
"<strong>he doesn't miss out this time!</strong> That is a crisp, crisp sweep shot. Nothing wrong with the delivery, but Root's got the confidence to get down nice and low and sweep firmly"
and now he's off for a dance! Root down the track this time and clipped confidently through mid-wicket. <strong>England going at 5.63 runs an over.</strong>
"round the wicket, but Jennings isn't interested in going for a drive. Assertively leaves"
"again, Lakmal is looking to tempt Jennings to drive, but Keaton is in no mood to bust a cover drive out here"
"tighter this time, and a bit more back of a length. Defended this time by Jennings"
"fuller this time, Jennings takes a big stride, and there's a moment where Jennings looks like he wants to play this. Then decides to just let the ball pass through"
a loud bark of 'no' as Jennings pushes this to point off the back foot
"another loud yelp, as Lakmal goes fuller. A maiden"
sound the buzzers klaxon! Jennings nearly caught ball watching as short leg takes aim at the non-strike'rs end. No-one backing up and they get two
solid defence once more as Akila goes back of a length
"Dickwella is begging for this to be given! Marais Erasmus isn't interested, but after an age, <strong>Sri Lanka review</strong>. This looked to be outside the line of off stump. No bat involved as Root looks to sweep. This actually goes over Root's bat. Down to ball tracking... impact outside. A wasted review"
driven down the ground as Root comes out for a wander. Plenty of dip from Akila
Jennings goes back and is beaten by some delicious turn
"<strong>edged, and a tough, tough chance!</strong> Neither Dickwella or Mathews could get there in time. Some turn and bounce on offer and Jennings gets a clear edge on this. It kisses Dickwella's glove, beats Mathews, and away for four"
"back of a length, and Root pushes to point"
solid footwork and trigger movements from Root as he defends this to cover as Lakmal keeps him honest
pushed to gully. Root's looking to play with soft hands. He's settling England after a nervy start
"full from Lakmal, trying to get it to move back in, and Root's in no mood to let this pass. Defended with the solidity of butter straight from the fridge"
"and again, Root shows us the full maker's name on the bat with a solid punch back"
"probing once more from Lakmal, back of a length moving back in a fraction, and Root defends it into the leg side"
"<strong>I adore Dickwella's vigorous appeals!</strong> We've got another review, as Dickwella's certain he's edged this. Jennings was looking to sweep but is beaten by the bounce. However, as much as that appeal alone deserved a wicket, there is nothing on Ultra Edge. Both appeals wasted in the first hour."
"more turn, and pushed to point. Good running from these two and they take a single"
"worked round the corner, and it's a meandering single from Root"
"worked into leg by Jennings, as he waits for the turn and nudges it into the leg side"
clipped confidently to mid-wicket as Akila goes full

"<B>big turn!</b> Ripping back into the pads, as the ball bobbles through the gate and way to the slips... no reviews left though!"
squared up as Root dances at the crease to combat the spin. Short leg is alert and nearly throws down the stumps

"too short from Akila and that's meat and drink for Jennings, rocking onto the back foot and flogging a flat pull through wide long-on"
"nudged firmly to square leg, England continue to gallop along"
"picked up with a flourish, out over the leg side, a decent tumbling stop at square leg to cut off the boundary"
"whipped off the front pad, out through square leg"
"punched through the covers, a slight misfield as Root gets his skates on"
"drilled into the off side once more, the intent is plain from England. Get the runs before one with your name on comes along..."

slides onto the back foot to defend into the off side
"tucked to the leg side, negating Herath's wiles"
"<B>edged... dropped!</b> A dolly to Mathews at slip, looping into his cupped hands and straight out again... was he deceived by the lack of pace? Or by the fact that Jennings was playing to leg and misread the googly?"
nudged into the covers
hoicked to the leg side
"dancing at the crease, punched into the covers"
"leaning onto the front foot, tapped into the covers"
tucked to leg to complete an eventful over
"<strong>Root has galloped down the track and yorked himself!</strong> Well, there we go, Root's intent costs him dear, and that is Herath's 100th wicket at Galle! There was no real need for such recklessness, but to be fair, his positive intent had hauled England off the canvas in the first hour ... but not the second."
"solidly onto the front foot, head over the ball to defend"
"advancing to meet the pitch of the ball, and whittled down to long on to get Stokes off the mark"
"big appeal, but that's standard from Dickwella! This does turn back into the pad, but way outside off"

"stretching forward, padded away"
"fired into the pads, another nudge round the corner to fine leg"
"advancing out of the crease, defended back whence it came. Solid from Stokes"
"<B>bowled him!</b> Beaten by the angle, the change of pace from the skiddier offspinner, coming round the wicket and firing it in flat, rattles the timbers as Jennings finds himself cramped on the cut. A fine innings as far as it went, but it's over too soon for England's liking..."
"stands tall on the back foot, and blocked into the off side"

"round the wicket, very full, stabbed back down the pitch"
<B>beats the inside edge but did that straighten enough?</b> Marais says no ... and Sri Lanka have no reviews... academic on this occasion
"<b>Stokes walks across his stumps on the sweep, and is bowled round his legs!</b> Crikey, this has been an all-action morning session! A poor choice from Stokes on that occasion, trying to get too cute with the angles, and hearing the death rattle ... he slams the pitch with the toe of his bat, that took out middle stump, which is an indication of how much room he gave himself"

"this one rises a touch more, Buttler not entirely keen as he defends there"
"that's delightful from Buttler. Stands tall to punch it off the back foot through the covers. Will it make it to the fence? Just about, despite a heroic chase and dive by the fielder. Kaushal Silva the man who warrants the Chariots of Fire theme"
left alone outside off. Minimal movement from Lakmal now with the ball softer
"he's still sticking outside off, a solid defence from the Buttler"

worked nicely round the corner where Kusal has to give chase to pull this back in
"plenty of turn and bounce, but Buttler rides it to work it round the corner"

"<strong>right on drinks, Sri Lanka strike!</strong> A moment's indecision from Buttler, who is caught on the crease as he's unsure how much this is going to turn. Takes the edge and that's a smart low take from Dickwella"

Foakes and short mid-wicket - they've got a thing going on

"full outside off, Kaushal gives a look of disdain at that, even though it was there to be encouraged to drive. Curran a bit skew whiff at times that over"
"Anderson's keeping it full, and once more Karunaratne respectfully defends it back"
"<strong>appeal for LBW</strong>, but this is back of a length and looked from the naked eye that it pitched outside leg. Yep, that's a country mile outside leg"
"back to outside off, Karunaratne solid once more"
"this one keeps a bit lower than the last couple, and the defence squirms itself to point"
"<strong>edged</strong>, but played with soft hands and doesn't carry to slip. Consistent line and length from the Jimmster this morning, and Karunaratne is making sure he isn't exposing his stumps"
<strong>leaves on length</strong> and this crashes into his thigh guard. Risky business on a wearing pitch
"outside off with no swing, let through"
pushed to point and there's no chance of a single there. Kaushal looking sturdy this morning
on off stump and confidently pushed to mid off. Lots of focus from the camera work on Kaushal's movements after the ball is played
a teaser outside off once more. Kaushal waves it through
"tight line on off, defended into the off side and there is a brief thought of a single. Would have been riskier than playing hungry hippos with an actual hippo!"
"attempts the short stuff, but it's at lower rib height and pulled to deep square"
"continual probing from Jimmy, Karunaratne pushes it through square"
"honed on off, Kaushal defends"
<strong>in ducker pins Kaushal on the pads</strong>. Height making that a no go for a big appeal
"back of a length, minimal swing on offer and defence once more. Anderson just looking to keep things tight rather than hoop it round corners"
"outside off once more, and it's pushed to point once more"
inside edge grubbers off the bat into the boot
"<strong>oooh, that's a Wasim Jaffer</strong>. Karunaratner goes prodding as Curran is still looking for swing"
solid defence once more after his fort was nearly breached last time. Karunaratne 9 off 42; safe to say he's not going to go into T20 mode any time soon
"lovely attempt at a yorker, dug out to mid-wicket and they scamper a single"
"outside off, and that's worked behind point and it skips away. The outfield still showing the pace of John Regis in his pomp despite the deluge last night"
"<strong>take that!</strong> Great riposte by Curran, getting this to fizz past a forward prod"
"slightly back of a length on off, and defended once more"
"Anderson round the wicket this time, and this is confidently clipped between mid-wicket and mid on"
"<strong>edged</strong>, but the soft hands of Karunaratne ensures it doesn't carry to Burns at third slip"
"hones it on off, and it's pushed back to the bowler"
"just a kitten's whisker of movement, but left alone"
and again. Karunaratne seems ready to bat for both days. I wouldn't put it past him!
finishes the over with a defiant block that you could set your watch too.
"back of a length from Curran, and Kaushal's happy to defend"
"nice and smooth, like gravy. A flowing push through the covers and they trot through comfortably for a couple"
"too leg side this time, and tickled to fine leg for a single"
clipped out to deep backward square. Sri Lanka in milkingtons mode at the moment. A confident start
"round the wicket, goes full, but Kaushal happy to block to mid on"
"again, Curran goes full, and once more, mid on gets to see the meat of the action with some fielding"
"punched with the subtlety of a Parisian detective down the ground, and they get back for a couple"
fuller this time from Jimmy and defended. Karunaratne takes his glove off after looking slightly uncomfortable defending it
"again, Anderson keeping it tight, but Karunaratne has already rang the Galle B&B, and he's looking set to book himself in for the next 36 hours"
"a wafer thin hint of swing, but solidly defended"
<strong>you ain't getting through that!</strong> Karunaratne blocks in style
"that's the sort of delivery that, had there been a hint of swing, Karunaratne might have fiddled at it. However, he's in no such mood today"
"a hint of turn, and defended into the off side"
"too full that time, and it's pushed out to the point boundary rider"
a bit of a shimmy from DK to meet this on the full. Leach fields off his own bowling
"no movement this time, and a stoic defence"
"down leg with a hint of turn again, Karunaratne looks to clip this but misses"
much better there from Leach and Karunaratne defends
"full from Anderson, nothing more than a push through point and they hurtle back in first gear for a couple"
"Anderson refuses to budge from the off, outside off line, but Kaushal isn't budging"
"again, more tentative probing, and again Kaushal doesn't budge"
nothing more than a push down to third man and Leach scampers after it like a otter scurrying after its young to cut it off
"Kaushal's solid once more. Jimmy's giving it his all, but to no avail"
"again, the line is decent, and it's dogged work by Anderson, but Kaushal's bedded in for the next few hours"
"shorter from Leach, with a hint of turn, and worked through square"
<strong>steady now Kaushal!</strong> Thinks about a single that is never in a million years
"more solid defence. Meanwhile, Bumble's distracted by some synchronised flying fish in the sea"
"a quick single, and a moment of whoopsie daisy from Root as his throw goes nowhere"
good diving work by Pope at short mid-wicket to ensure no single there
"driven straighter than the A30 between Camberley and the Jolly Farmer roundabout, but no run"
<strong>first signs of a sweep</strong> today as Moeen goes comfortably outside off
"<strong>dropped!</strong> That was delicious from Moeen, but Stokes can't hold on. Karunaratne prods forward and that's a healthy edge, but it's put down"
solid defence this time
plonked back to the bowler. Stokes cannot believe he's put that down
"full on off, DK smothers this"
"pushed to mid off and they get through for a single. Positive signs for Moeen straight away. If he and Leach get on a roll here, Sri Lanka could be in trouble"
"round the wicket, defended to mid-wicket"
flicked down to fine leg as Karunaratne takes a big stride
on leg stump and nurdled down to fine leg. Good work in the deep keeps it to one
"worked from back of a length to short mid-wicket. Another good diving stop by Pope, who's on as a sub"
"it's time for an Argentine tango, as Karunaratne advances to meet the ball and gracefully trombones this down to long on"
"honing in on the pads, but no spin, so defended"
on middle. Defended once more
"a touch shorter, DK goes back and carves it out to cover"
"Kaushal goes into his best Dick van Dyke impression with a powerful sweep, but there's a man out there, so just a single"
<strong>off the inside edge</strong> as Karunaratne prods at this. Beats short leg and that's the <strong>50 up</strong>

"angled into the pads, and tucked to the leg side"

"twirled onto a fuller length, a measured push to long-on to complete the over"
"tossed up from round the wicket, just probing away on a full length"
"<B>biffed back to the bowler and England have their second!</b> A loss of discipline from Karunaratne, charging down the pitch, lamping a drive through the line of the ball and scudding a return chance at waist height to Moeen's right! A fine catch, that was travelling quickly, and there is his <B>150th wicket in Tests!</b>"

"clipped to square leg, Burns was momentarily in business under the lid"
"fired down the leg side, Foakes makes that take look easy. It wasn't"
"pressed into the off side. Nothing much doing in that over, as England are content to turn the screw and wait for their chances"
"<B>now that's how to do it!</b> Three men round the bat, so Dhananjaya dumps a lofted drive clean over the bowler's head, a glorious swing of the blade, allied to positive footwork"

"pushed into the covers, head over the ball"
"firmly forward, repelling Rashid's wiles"
"back of a length this time, good bite from leg to off. Blocked again"
"this one is dragged down, and <strong>Mendis makes no mistake!</strong> A violent flog through the leg side. Still, no harm in England keeping Sri Lanka interested in playing strokes, I guess..."

sliding onto the pads and worked square
thumped down to deep midwicket with a very cautious pull - another drag-down from Rashid but he was wary of kitchen-sinking it due to the man back on the rope. Good awareness at least
"a better length, but no great consistency to Rashid's offerings so far"
"driven into the covers, Leach - by contrast to Rashid - is getting his line and length spot on"

"outside off, Root probing away well"
"legbreak from Root, he's got all the tricks these days"
"forward once more, stretching to the pitch"
another legbreak to mix it up. He's been watching Akila Dananjaya too much
"<B>wide line, a horrid waft, he's been given out!</b> De Silva <b>reviews</b> but England were so confident! But, <B>no!</b> No spike on UltraEdge, and the decision is overturned! The least confident man in that saga was umpire Erasmus, who I think gave the decision on England's reaction, rather than his own conviction"
"<B>edged, gone this time!</b> Ben Stokes makes things happen once more! Playing away from the body, as Stokes angled it in from a wide line and kissed the edge of a flimsy poke. Root at slip stooped low, gobbled the chance, and England are in total command now!"
"<strong>welcome to the crease Mr Mathews!</strong> A tasty bumper first up, and Angelo has to duck and weave to get out the way"
"in that corridor, and Mathews happy to leave this time"

"bang on the money straight away, a thickish edge to backward point and it's a single"

"full on off, defended to short cover"
"a dance of yes, no between Kusal and Mathews as this is defended to point. No damage done"
<strong>tasty!</strong> Terrific bumper and Kusal has to go down a rabbit hole and to ground to get out the way
"back of a length into the body, and Kusal is ordered back as he goes for a lunatical single"
an early call of no as he defends this into short leg area
"Kusal is down the rabbit hole, but looks to fiddle with a periscope of an uppercut. Very, very odd shot given the situation"
"again, a tempter wide of the crease outside off, but too wide for Kusal to even contemplate it. England trying to build pressure here once more"
"a prod forward, then back, and pushed to point. Not much spin for Leach"

forward prod from Mendis and no run there
"a gazumping sweep out to deep mid-wicket, but just a single"
"very full this time, and caressed down the ground"
a slight hint of turn but Kusal smothers this and it's another block
"wide of the crease again, Mathews defends. Stokes, as ever, giving it his all for the cause"

<strong>wristy whippage</strong> on the sweep from Mendis. Too much on the pads and crunched hard through backward square leg
"short, but bunted to point"
fierce short ball and pulled down to fine leg. A clear plan against Mathews this
"very full, enticing the drive, but Mendis hits it straight to the fielder"
"good pace back of a length, and once again defended"
<strong>why on earth are you doing that Mendis?! </strong>It's utterly bonkers to go periscoping when the situation requires you to dig yourself a trench
"back of a length once more, defended to Moeen"
"<strong>oh that's a brute of a delivery.</strong> Sharp, wide of the crease and Mendis nearly edges this. Fine effort from Stokes"
"full from Leach, clipped to mid on"

"back of a length and punched down the ground, just getting past Leach trying to field off his own bowling"
"probing line, but with minimal spin on offer, easy batting for Mathews"

"another brute of a short ball, works this one to leg slip"
this one doesn't get up as much and <strong>Mathews has cracked this straight into Burns' shin</strong>. Mathews immediately checks he's okay
"wider short ball, but clothed it to mid on"

just too short for Mathews to seriously be concerned

down leg and carefully defended once more
<strong>first sign of indecision</strong> as Mathews was playing for more turn. Inside edge onto pad
much better this time. Forward and defended

<strong>dropped!</strong> He nearly got his reward. Mathews cracks the absolute gubbins off of this straight to Anderson at mid-wicket who puts it down. Huge chance!
tentatively worked down to fine leg for a single
"<strong>just wide of short leg! </strong>Stokes is making things happen here. If someone can find some replacement Duracells, he could keep going"
less pace on this one and worked round the corner for one
Mendis ducks as he predicts early this will be short
"length this time, and Mendis defends. Stokes <strong>finally</strong> signals he needs a rest, and looks the colour of a beetroot. He has ran himself into the ground there."
"outside off, pushed to extra cover"
another nudge through the covers and they take a single
on leg and carefully defended
"<strong>hello hello!</strong> Mendis goes for a qucikstep down the track and launches over mid off. Moeen's a fair way back, but it's over him"
"<strong>he has thrown away!</strong> Utterly bonkers. This is not smart cricket from Mendis. He's already shown Leach his intent, but now surely just work it for a single and keep the momentum up?! Not a chance say Mendis, as he goes dancing once more and skews it to Moeen. All that hard work done to see off Stokes, and he's chucked it in the gutter"

inside-out drive to the leg side
"bending towards the off stump, pushed to the off side"
"<B>massive inswing, and is that a drop from Foakes?</b> I think it is, but it's a mighty effort, stretching to his left after having to adjust late to snatch at the inside edge. He saved four at the very least"

"devious inswing now for Anderson, a very full length and clipped anxiously out to the leg side"
speared into the leg side for the single
"round the wicket, lobbed onto a good length, just testing the patience on an off stump line"

"pushed deeper into the crease, slip and silly point lurk to no avail"
"full face of the bat, stretching down the line of the ball"
"dangerous shape now from Anderson, swinging late on a full length, but defended into the covers"

"squeezed into the covers, Leach settling for relentless accuracy over magic balls"
"<B>now there's the magic!</B> Perfect line and length, drift into the pads, a bit of bite off the deck, and back goes the off stump! Chandimal's lack of mobility perhaps played a part, as he ended up playing down the wrong line, but he was done in by the flight and beaten off the pitch"
"round the wicket, into the pads of the left-hander, and pushed back down the pitch"
eased into the leg side
"round the wicket now for Anderson to the left-hander, back of a length and pushed into the off side"
"sturdy on the front foot, head over the ball, poked to cover"

"nudged to midwicket, no run on offer there"

"<strong>zippy length, lovely shape!</strong> Bursting past the splice as Dickwella is caught on the crease"
"an angled bat, capitalising on just enough width to pinch the single to third man"
"back over the wicket to the right-hander, and there's that sharp bend back into the stumps. Defended, but threatening"

shorter and watchfully defended
tighter line and defended once more
nudged round the corner as Moeen keeps it tight. Gets him off the mark
"<strong>risky!</strong> Angelo has danced down here half heartedly, gets an inside edge that goes out to deep square leg. If Sri Lanka are to have any hope of making this to Day 5, Mathews can't afford shots like that"
