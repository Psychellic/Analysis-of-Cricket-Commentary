Jadeja is quickly back up, shapes to throw at the striker's end, but maintains his composure and stops. Finds the non-striker's end is the way to go and sends in a throw on the bounce.

"short on off stump, and Bhuvi chooses to let this ball go. Looks at the square-leg umpire, who says it's <i>not a wide</i>"
"<b>crunched!</b> Full on off, and Bhuvi clears his front leg and check-drives right over Rubel's head! Soars over the long-off boundary as the crowd erupts in delight"
"full on middle but going down leg. Hits his front leg, but they manage to pinch a run anyway"
"back of a length on middle stump, and Jadeja rides the bounce to defend off the back foot"
"full on middle, and driven to mid off for a quick single. Jadeja's got to hurry, but he makes it across easily. The fielder's throw was nowhere near the non-striker's stumps"
"back of a length outside off, and he tries to steer a late cut to third man. Finds the fielder poaching at backward point. India need 18 off 23 now"
"good length outside off, and the square cut finds backward point once again! Carbon copy of the last shot. 18 off 22 now"

"<b>clipped!</b> And it runs away for a boundary. India have the advantage once more. Full on leg stump, and Bhuvi closes his bat's face and tickles a shot to the fine-leg boundary!"
"back of a length on off, and he punches to short mid off for a quick run. The fielder tries to run Jadeja out at the bowler's end, and he misses. Nobody's backing up, so India pinch a second run as well. Oh dear"
"<b>tickled!</b> But the umpire doesn't raise his finger. <b>Bangladesh are reviewing.</b> It was a length ball angling across Jadeja. He tried to drive away from his body, and there was a faint noise as the ball went past him. UltraEdge says 'out' and Bangladesh get a last-gasp hope"
"back of a length just outside off, and flicked away to the vacant square-leg region for a single. Jadhav hobbles across for one"
"slower ball, full outside off. Worked away to the leg side, but straight to midwicket"
"back of a length just outside off. Tries to steer this to third man, but it's too close to his body. Played to point"
"good length on middle, and he uncomfortably punches down the ground. Bhuvi will keep strike. India need 9 off 12."
<b>taken by the keeper!</b> Angling away from Bhuvi and he looks to drive away from his body. The keeper dives to his right and takes an excellent diving catch! Twist in the tail?
"full just outside off, and he defends towards cover. But the ball takes a leading edge towards the leg side instead. India won't mind how they come"
"full just outside off, and the push goes straight to backward point. Says no to the single. India need 8 off 9 now."
"good length just outside off. Angling across Jadhav, and he taps this away to point. Can't find the single"

"length ball on off, and that's been cut away to deep point for a couple more. India need six but Kuldeep will be on strike"
"full just outside off, and caressed down the ground to wide long off. Gets Jadhav back on strike"
"full on off stump, and worked off his pads to square leg for a single. Gets Kuldeep back on strike. Are India going to do it in singles?"
"<b>swings across the line!</b> And in the gap. Kuldeep runs back for the second run. Full on off, and he's slog-swept this over the midwicket fielder. Cheers among the Indian fans"
"round arm ball, full on off. Wedged away to short cover. No chance of a single"
"full just outside off, and he mistimes a leg-side slog onto his pads. The ball trickles away to the keeper's right and the batsmen scamper across for one!"
"full on leg stump, and Jadhav misses the flick off his pads. The ball hits his leg and runs away to the short fine-leg boundary! <B>India win by three wickets!</b> The fireworks go off! Kedar Jadhav, you beauty. The Bangladesh boys have a smile on their faces though. Played with excellent spirit."
