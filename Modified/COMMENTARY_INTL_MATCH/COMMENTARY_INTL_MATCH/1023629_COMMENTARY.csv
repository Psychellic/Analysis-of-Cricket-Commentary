starts off with a length ball just outside off that is pushed back to the bowler off the front foot
on a length again but angled in to the left-hander and Hughes pushes it off the front foot just wide of mid-on for a very quick single
backs away to make room and finds cover on the cut shot
backs away to make room and chips this just over extra cover who runs back and across a couple of steps and stretches out his right hand but cannot get to it. Close
"very full and outside off, squeezed out to backward point"
stays in the crease to this fullish length ball and tucks it to midwicket who runs in and fields it
some width on offer outside off and Lumb stands tall on the backfoot and punches it past the diving cover-point fielder for the first boundary of the evening
comes down the track and meets the pitch of this ball before carving it uppishly over mid-off. Shouts of catch it but it goes well wide of the diving fielder and into the boundary
"fuller ball on the pads, tries to tuck it away and does not make contact"
"short of a length down the leg side, swinging further away and Lumb makes no contact as he tries to tuck it away. The wicketkeeper does well to collect it after flinging himself to his right"

"good length ball on off, shuffles across and tries to flick it away but gets it off the inside edge to square leg"
"short ball on the stumps, does not time the pull shot to square leg"
"full and outside off, comes down the tack but yorks himself and squeezes it out to the off side"
"fuller ball, clipped away to midwicket where James Vince dives to make the stop"
"backs away and backs away too far. Green does well to adjust late and fires it wide, but in line of off-stump. Lumb cannot make any contact as he reaches out for it and the ball takes out off-stump"
"fuller ball, comes down the track and drills it straight to mid-off"
"fullish, pushed along the ground to mid-on who swoops down and gathers it as they jog for the single"
"flighted and sliding in on leg with the arm, clipped away with the angle to backward square leg"
"back of a length and angling across, tucked off the hips to midwicket. The fielder is stationed deep and they think of the second but he is swift in running in towards the ball and picking it up, so they decide against it"
shuffles across to this length ball and jabs it straight back to the bowler
"short of a length ball, swivels around with the pull to short fine leg"
"back of a length ball, does not bounce as much and he gets the pull shot off the bottom part of the blade to short fine leg"
comes down the track and swipes. Not much room but he makes good connection and lofts it away over the deep backward square leg boundary. Brathwaite thought for a moment he had his man ut it seals clean over the boundary
"slower short of a length ball, tucked off the backfoot through the backward square leg region. There is a fielder in the deep and he keeps it down to a single"
good use of the feet. Advances down the track to get on top of that before drilling the drive past the diving extra cover fielder
"fullish and on leg stump, pushed gently down to long-on for a single"
"very full ball, yorker outside off, jams the bat down and digs it out"
"fuller outside off, gets an inside edge on the push and the ball goes away to square leg"
backs away to make room for himself but the bowler follows him and Hughes is forced to chip it towards long-on and the ball goes on the bounce
"fuller and on the stumps, pushed out to wide mid-on"
walks across the stumps early so gets cramped for room as a result and cannot make contact on the attempted cut shot at this short ball
comes down the track and gets it off the bottom part of the bat but the lofted drive still has enough to comforably clear the mid-off fielder and go all the way to the boundary
"full and wide outside off, chases it and cannot make any contact as he flashes at it"
"short ball, not much pace, swivel around with the pull to short fine leg"
plumb! Walks a long way across the stumps and Watson fires a yorker bang on the stumps. He tries to clip it away to the leg side but the ball swings back late and pings the batsman bang in front of stumps. Looked out the moment it his him on the pad and the umpire takes little time to give his decision
"short of a length outside off, drops it into the off side off the backfoot"
"very full ball, clipped away to deep midwicket"
"fullish and sliding in on middle and leg, blocked off the front foot"
"slightly flighted and some width outside off, slapped away off the backfoot"
"tossed up outside off, tries to flick across the line and gets a leading edge to cover-point"
"flighted on off, plays across the line and does not make contact. Takes the backfoot off and the wicketkeeper takes the bails off. They go upstairs to check and he seems to have done okay"

"flighted and pushed across the left-hander from over the wicket, pushed down along the turf to long-on"
"flatter and just outside off, backs away and tries to cut but there is not enough room and it keeps a tad low as well, so he gets beaten. Misses the off-stump by a very narrow margin"
"tossed up outside off, clipped away to midwicket"
tucked to midwicket
comes down the track and goes inside-out over extra cover. Controls it well after meeting the pitch of it and the ball goes a couple of bounces and over the boundary
"flighted and on leg, comes forward and pushes it in front of long-off. Think of the second run for a second but rightly decide against it"
wrong'un that bounces a bit more than he would have liked. It is on middle and off and spinning away instead of in to him and he does not middle the attempted slog. Gets it off the splice and skies it to the midwicket region where Green runs in from the deep and settles under it fairly comfortably
another attempted slog and another wicket. Gets a lot of drift on this flighted ball. He tries to go against the spin and slog it big over the leg side but gets a leading edge and skies it towards the covers region. Ryan Gibson is the fielder this time and he settles under it between cover and extra cover
"lovely tossed up ball, driven off the front foot to covers"
"fullish ball outside off, drills it hard straight down the ground"
"short of a length outside off, swings weakly. It's a nothing shot and he makes no contact"
"short ball outside off, gets up and Haddin lets the ball go to the keeper"
rolls his fingers over this fuller ball outside off. It's a half-volley and comes on at a gentle pace and Hadin drills it between mid-off and extra cover on the front foot drive
"good length ball, swings hard on the pull shot and gets a top edge that balloons to deep midwicket. Kurtis Patterson runs in a few steps forward to take the catch. Made it look very easy but that stayed up a long time and he had to cover a little ground. Never easy to judge those"
"very full ball, presses forward and pushes it back to the bowler"
comes forward and drops this fuller ball in front of extra cover for a sharp single
"flighted wrong'un, pushed across at a nice angle and beats Munro who pushes at it without feet"
missed everyone. Second wrong'un in a row. Munro tries to flick it across the line and the ball spins past the outside edge. It bounces more than the wicketkeeper anticipates and it misses him as well
flat legbreak that spins back in sharply and Munro was backing away looking to slap it through the off-side. No way there was enough room to do that and he pays the price for the wrong selection of shot. Misses the ball completely and it crashes into the stumps

"tossed up full ball, driven down to long-on"
backs away to this back of a length ball and steers it to sweeper cover

comes forward to push this fullish length ball and gets it off the outside edge towards backward point
"flighted on leg stump, closes the bat face early as he looks to flick it to the leg side and chips it over the bowler who leaps with his right hand outstretched but cannot get to it"
"beats the outside edge to end a fabulous spell. Shifts back in the crease and sticks his bat to this short of a length ball. He is nowhere near it, stuck his bat out from very wide of the crease and the ball spins past the outside edge"
"good length ball, angling in from outside off, chops the defence to the pad"
straight through. Pays the price for playing across the line. It was a length ball and straight as an arrow. Misses the flick as he closes the face of his bat just a tad early and the ball crashes into the middle stump
"near-yorker on leg, jams the bat down and works it behind square to fine leg"

"back of a length, not much pace again and he waits for it before pulling it into the deep midwicket region"
Brathwaite's dabs are back. This one really seemed like a good hit that would go the distance but it goes straight to the fielder at deep square leg. It was a good length ball and Lyon swipes hard as he pulls it. The ball goes a long way up in the air and he seems to have got good distance on it as well. But guess what? Kurtis Patterson does not have to move an inch as he snaffles it at deep square leg

"yorker outside off, jams the bat down and carves it out to sweeper cover"
walks across early to this short ball but there is absolutely no pace on it - it is fired just at 114kph. He misses the pull shot and the ball goes to the wicketkeeper and it is not called a wide. Good call as it went over the shoulder of the batsman
backs away and swipes across the line as he looks to go big over the leg side. Misses and takes off a couple of steps as he looks for a bye and is sent back. The wicketkeeper fires a throw and misses the stumps. But direct hit and he could have been gone
"comes down the track to slog and makes no contact as the ball goes to the wicketkeeper. He fires a throw at the striker's end and takes the bails off even as the batsman makes his way back. He could be run out here and they go upstairs. The throw is fired and the batsman is outside the crease, but giess what? The bails take forever to come off. The ball brushes the stumps and goes a further couple of feet away before the bails finally come off by which time the batsman makes his way back. Bizarre!"

backs away a long way and drills this length ball to the left of the bowler
tucked to square leg and they jog the single
"shorter in length and Patterson stands firm on the front foot, gets on top of the bounce and whips it powerfully with a flat bat through mid-off. Too easy for Thunder"
and they are really cruising. Comes down the track to get on top of the bounce and lofts it over mid-off as the ball goes on the bounce over the boundary
gets a top edge on the attempted pull. It is shorter in length but comes on to him quickly. Gets a bit hurried and skews it to short fine leg where Bird settles under it and snaffles it reverse-cupped
"fuller ball on the stumps, pushed off the front foot straight down the pitch"
"short of a length, tucked off the pads to deep square leg"
"fuller ball outside off, wide half-volley and Watson dismisses it through covers. Gets down on one knee as he crunches the drive and lovely follow-through of the bat"
goes for an ill-advised cross-batted slap to a ball that is not as short. Does not get up much as a result and he gets beaten
