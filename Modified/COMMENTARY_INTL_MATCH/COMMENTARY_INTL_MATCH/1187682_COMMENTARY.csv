"short of length outside off, punched to cover"
"nice shape away, Shaw leaves"
"looks to whip it from outside off through midwicket, gets an inside edge onto the body"

"full on middle, hint of movement away, Shaw defends with a straight bat. <strong>Maiden to begin with</strong>"
"on the pads, Agarwal looks to tickle fine, off the pad to fine leg"

"another one! Shapes away, Mayank is squared up again. <strong>Beaten</strong>"
"full and moving away from the fifth stump, left alone"
<b> saved by umpire's call! </b> Agarwal late on the shot as he hops back to defend. The short of length ball nips back in and rushes him into the defensive stroke. Both feet up in the air. The only thing that could've saved him is an inside edge. Nothing there. Ball tracking shows the ball would've only clipped top of the stumps. So Langton Rusere's call stays.
responds with a magnificent cover drive on the up! Can imagine Ravi Shastri whirring in the background saying it was a tracerrrrr bulllet
"a direct hit from Sodhi at mid-on and Agarwal could've been in trouble! Squirted off a thick inside edge to mid-on, he decided to rush through for a single and gets lucky"

beaten as he chases a wide ball

leaves this full delivery outside off
defends this full delivery with his bat close to the pad
glides this down to third man
"nibbles at one and has to go! Shaw was looking to stay leg side and run it down, the hint of movement leaves him in two minds. By the time he tried to withdraw the bat, it was too late. Straightforward catch for Latham"
ripper of a bouncer! Agarwal looking to take him on but had to bail out in the end
pulled away over square leg. Not hit as well as he would've liked but that is a slightly short boundary that side.
good leave to a full delivery outside off
"he's flayed this straight to point. Agarwal can't believe what he's just seen. Not Southee's best ball. This was short, enough width and he goes after that. Hit it absolutely off the middle, but Blundell takes a sharp catch."
"driven back nicely, good stop on his followthrough"

"pitched up and holds its line outside off, draws a weak drive to cover"
"much fuller and on off stump, check-driven to mid-on off the front foot"
"nice and full again, on a fifth-stump line, signs of a slow pitch as the ball isn't quite coming on. Kohli checks another drive and chips it instead to mid-off"
"chipped away in the air....once bounce to Sodhi at long leg. Kohli shuffles across, gets inside the line of this full ball and doesn't make enough contact with a whip"
"shorter and angling into off, Iyer is pretty solid in defence"
"short and holds its line outside off, punched on the up. You can't get it past Santner at short cover. Decent start from Neesham"

"Iyer drives on the up from outside off, but Southee throws himself across to stop it or rather take some pace off it and deflect it to mid-off"
back of a length and angling down leg as Kohli shuffles out and doesn't connect with a flick. Front-foot no-ball from Neesham
"there's the loose ball, there's the release. Neesham floats a rubbish full-toss outside off. Kohli lines it up and drills it past the outstretched left hand of the bowler and Santner at mid-off"
short and wide - wider than a set of stumps outside off - NZ want to make Kohli play a long way away from his body. An <strong>outside edge streaks away to deep third man</strong>

"shorter and outside off, tap and run to midwicket"

"on a length and outside off, tip and run to the covers"
"Neesham strays onto the pads, and Iyer finds some breathing space wit a glanced four with the inswing past the left of the keeper"
"shorter and just a shade outside off, run away to point"
"on a length and outside off, dinked to point off the face again"

dabs it gently into the gap at cover
"floats this full and wide outside off, Rahul leaves anticipating it to be wide, not given"

"hit superbly over extra cover. Picked the slower ball, held his shape and hit it cleanly"
