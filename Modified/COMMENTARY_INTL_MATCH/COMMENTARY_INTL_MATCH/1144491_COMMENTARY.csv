"Henry finds a touch of lift in the channel outside off, but Tamim rides it well to defend to point"
"fuller this time from Henry, searching for any early movement. Tamim is forward to smother it"
"<b>flicked fine!</b> There is some swing for Henry, but it's in to Tamim and starts too straight. Tamim's just got to help it on its way to collect four, and noise erupts from the stands"
"<b>good riposte</b> from the bowler, who pulls his length back and straightens his line to burst a length ball past Tamim's outside edge"
"and now he aims full again, but again it's a little too straight. Tamim flicks off his legs, but finds midwicket inside the circle"
"and Henry ends the over with another length delivery, Tamim propping half forward to defend. Did this keep a little low? Seemed like it, from Tamim's reaction"
"some shape away from the left hander first up, and Soumya thrusts his hands out at the ball to collect a single to third man"
"zippy from Boult, and Tamim lets it through outside off"
"snaking away from an off stump line, and Tamim holds his back inside the line to let the ball pass him"
"fuller of length this time, but the line is slightly too straight and he's clipped into space at midwicket for one"
"excellent line from Boult, attacking the top of off, and Soumya is only half forward as he taps it to cover"
"Soumya's a little squared up by this one, and a thick outside edge rolls through gully, allowing a single"
"there's a yelp of alarm from the bowler as this one shapes in and almost sneaks through, but Soumya's bat comes down in time and he picks a gap at midwicket for a brace"
"angled across the left hander, who steps into a forward push to cover"
"<b>massive swipe across the line!</b> What's he thinking? Henry has strung a couple of dots together, and so Soumya lines up a huge mow into the leg side, hitting nothing. Fortunately for him, the ball flies wide of the off stump and through to the keeper"
"Henry gets this one to spit off a length, and there's a touch of fend to Soumya's defensive push"
"another big drive from Soumya, and he's a little too early into the shot. Instead of going through mid off, where he was aiming, the ball rolls to mid on"
"nippy finish to the over from Henry, curving a 139km/h delivery in towards middle and off. Soumya's defence holds firm, however"
"<b>through the hands of extra cover!</b> That's a misfield, and it's brought two runs. Tamim stood tall to spank a length ball to cover, and it was hit really hard, but the fielder got hands to it and should have stopped that"
"a touch fuller from Boult, and this time Tamim defends"
"<b>bouncer</b> from Boult, and Tamim hurries to duck underneath it"
"<b>exquisite</b> from Tamim! Boult pitched this right up, searching for swing, but Tamim just flicked his wrists through the line to send the ball scorching to the midwicket boundary"
"forced, on the up, to cover, where Neesham tumbles to cut it off"
"Tamim hops into a defensive push to end the over, and the field closes in to stop any thoughts of a single"
a neat forward push is quickly stopped at cover
"full, straight, and it squirts off the inside edge of a thrusting bat, the ball bouncing down to fine leg for a couple"
"<b>gun barrel straight, down the ground!</b> Henry did pitch it up, inviting the drive, but Soumya slugs it straight back over his head for four"
"Soumya steps into a fluid drive, but Taylor is at short extra and stops it cleanly"
"and now it's Santner who stops a thrashing shot in the off side field - at backward point this time, Soumya having gone at it off the back foot"
"<b>edged</b>, but there are no slips! Third man scoots around to keep them to one. It was a cutter from Henry, and just nipped away from the bat a touch"
"too straight, and it's nudged off the hip for a single"
"crack! Tamim rocks back and hammers this pull, but de Grandhomme is in exactly the right spot at midwicket to stop it"
"outside off, and Tamim holds his bat inside the line to let the ball through"
"Tamim is forward this time, driving smartly but straight at mid off"
"smell that! Boult pushes Tamim back into his crease with a bristling bouncer, successfully evaded"
"this one was headed down the leg side, but Boult gets away with it as Tamim can't get a good connection on his leg glance. Just the one"
"Tamim steps into a drive, and mid on is deep so there's a quick single to be had"
"<b>thrashed through extra!</b> Henry aims full, and just wide enough to draw a flowing drive from Soumya. The ball flies in the air, but in the gap. And it was travelling!"
"Henry pulls his length back a shade, Soumya angling his blade for a single to gully"
"and Tamim follows suit, an angled bat sending the ball bouncing down to third man"
"<b>thundered through the off side!</b> When he spots width, Soumya swings his bat like a battle axe. He gives everything to this forcing stroke through cover, and collects four"
"Henry adjusts, aiming straighter, and he's nurdled to leg for one"
Soumya stretches forward to poke a drive to point
"a sliding stop saves runs! Boult offered up a freebie, headed down the leg side, and Soumya happily helped it on its way. It looked like four all the way, but de Grandhomme makes excellent ground at fine leg, putting in a dive to cut it off and saving two runs"
"angled down to third man, and he turns the strike over"
"tapped to cover, but there's no way through the field"
"<b>handsomely pulled!</b> Boult tests him with a short one, but Tamim gets into a great position, maintains his balance, and hammers it away"
"good comeback from the bowler, zoning in on off stump with a bit of wobble. Tamim does enough to keep it out, if a little awkwardly"
"short of a good length, and Tamim hops to ride the bounce and guide a single to third man"
"angled across Soumya, who looks for a glide to third man himself, but picks out gully"
"<b>the breakthrough!</b> And Soumya has given it away. He'd looked so good until this point, but he's undone by an ugly hoick into the leg side. Henry aimed the ball nice and full and Soumya looked to target the leg side, but the ball rushed on to him, taking an inside edge and bouncing off the pad onto the stumps."
and he's off the mark straight away with a tip-and-run single to mid off
"full, and it's dug out back to the bowler"
"Tamim leans forward into a checked drive, left elbow held high, but his shot once again hits the field"
"full, and Shakib's forward to drive, the shot pinging the field"
"forced off the back foot this time, but he can't get it past point"
"this one seemed to nip in off the seam, but it starts too straight and Shakib collects two with a flick through midwicket"
"definitely some nip off the seam this time, and it cramps Shakib for room as he's rooted to the crease"
"Boult tests Shakib with a bouncer, and he rolls his wrists well in the stroke to control it, but can't find the requisite placement"
"Shakib thrusts his bat out at a full one, the ball coming off the inside half of the stroke and rolling to mid on. There's <i>just</i> enough room for a quick single"
tapped softly to cover
"Henry flings down a full, wide yorker, and Shakib likewise flings a drive out at it ... but ball zips under bat, and it's a dot"
"crunched out to deep point, and there's <b>fifty up for Bangladesh</b>"
"he's forward now, on the drive, but mid off is around in a flash to cut it off. Just the one"
"outside off, and chopped down to third man for a single"
short and Shakib turns into a controlled pull out to deep square
"and he starts with a waspish lifter outside off, Shakib dropping his hands as the ball buzzes past him"
"<b>a better throw might have had him!</b> Shakib clips a straighter one through midwicket, and he immediately wants two. Tamim doesn't! Boult runs across to field, but he's off balance as he throws and it's slightly wide, allowing Tamim to get home"
"just short of a good length, and straight, Tamim hopping to defend"
"Tamim throws his hands into a drive, and the bottom hand takes over a little too much, sending the ball rolling through mid on"
"there's some width offered outside off, but Shakib chops it straight to gully"
"a bouncer to finish the over, Shakib buckling his knees to get underneath it"
"and he's full to start, inviting the drive, but Tamim's shot is stopped by a driving cover fielder"
"full and straight from de Grandhomme, and Tamim taps softly to cover once again"
"Guptill at gully scoots across to stop an attempted glide to third man, another dot"
"but he's off strike this time, whipping across his pads for a single to leg"
and now it's Shakib's turn to flick a little single off his pads
"angled across Tamim, who helps the ball down to third man for one, sending it fine of Guptill at gully this time"
"dug in halfway down by Ferguson, and it's also misdirected down the leg side. Wide called"
"snorter! Again Ferguson digs it in, but this time the ball is directed with vim and vigour over the top of off. Tamim is fortunate to get his bat, and hands, out of the way"
"<b>pulled, spliced, skied, caught!</b> Ferguson stuck with the short-pitched attack, and this is another well-directed bouncer at scorching pace: 144km/h. It's too quick for Tamim, who's not quite in position to pull as the ball rushes on to him, but does so anyway. The ball takes the splice of the shot, looping simply to Boult at midwicket"
"it's straight, and Mushfiqur nurdles into the leg side"
"rising outside the off stump, Mushfiqur hopping to defend to point"
"and short it is, the ball coming off the thigh pad and bouncing down to fine leg. Ferguson's bowling with some serious heat, this one clocked at 145km/h"
"and yet another short one to finish the over, Mushfiqur ducking as the ball sails over him at 141km/h"
"angled across Shakib's bows, and he has a little fiddle but can't put bat to ball outside off"
"punched back at de Grandhomme, who gets a touch on the ball before it hits the non-striker's stumps, but Mushfiqur was safely home"
"nurdled into space on the leg side, a quick single the result"
"<b>no shot offered and he's struck on the pad!</b> De Grandhomme bellows an appeal, but Umpire Reiffel's not interested"
"full, in the channel outside off, and it's defended to cover"
"nudged into space in the covers, and he's called through for a quick single"
"Mushfiqur squirts one to leg, the ball coming off the inside half of the bat, and they chance a quick single, challenging the fielder. Tight, but safe"
"Ferguson shoots a length delivery across Shakib at 143km/h, a measured poke rolling to mid off"
"rising towards his hip this time, at 142km/h, Shakib hurrying a glance to leg for one"
<b>that's a jaffa!</b> Ferguson storms to the wicket and delivers a 145km/h thunderbolt that leaps past Mushfiqur's groping outside edge. He didn't know too much about that ...
"and now, to keep him honest, a bouncer that rises over leg stump. 'One for the over' says Oxenford"
"full and straight this time, Mushfiqur driving back towards the bowler, who lets it through his hands. But mid off cleans up, and there's no single to be had"
"some shape in to the batsman, who tucks to leg"
"full, and pushed across him this time. Shakib drives to mid off, and there's room for a scampered single"
"a bit of cut back in off the track, and Mushfiqur taps it watchfully to leg"
"<b>hoicked into the leg side!</b> That's woken the crowd up - first boundary since the 8th over. Mushfiqur jumped down the track and slammed it in the air, and wide of Boult at deep midwicket. Boult made plenty of ground, but couldn't get there"
nudged gently to leg
"flicked down to fine leg, just the one"
"length ball  but down the leg side, targeting Mushfiqur's rib cage with the leg gully in place but misdirected"
"length and angled across, beats Mushfiqur who is rooted to the crease expecting a short one, just fishes at it with his hands, tentative stroke"
"<strong>nearly works!</strong> Another quick short one, hurries onto Mushfiqur who fended at it awkwardly, lobbed up towards the leg gully but just eluded him despite the hang time the ball had"
goes fuller and across Shakib and beats him outside off as he pushes at it meekly
"length on middle and leg this tinme, Shakib can't tuck it away and it nearly rolls back onto the stumps off the thigh pad"
"another quick, short one, Shakib sees this one early and ducks under, but he can't keep doing this forever, needs to find a way to score"
"a fast yorker on middle to finish, Shakib jams his bat down on it and squeezes it away towards square leg"

"<strong>run out chance but Shakib survives!</strong> Length, angled in, tucked away towards midwicket, Shakib took off with the shot before Mushfiqur sent him back and by then it was almost too late.

"<strong>Mushfiqur's run himself out here!</strong> Length on middle, pushed towards cover, Mushfiqur took off with the push to the off side, it was to the Guptill's left but he got there quickly and returned a throw right over the stumps, with no response from Shakib, Mushfiqur was stranded mid pitch and the belated attempt to turn around proved futile."

"swing for Boult, but it starts too straight and hoops down the leg side"

"<b>past the outside edge!</b> Boult bent his back on this one and found some lift off a length as it hit the seam, going over the top of Mahmudullah's wafting cut"
a firm drive sends the ball bouncing out to deep cover
"chopped down behind point, using the angle offered by Boult's line"

"full and straight at 139km/h, the drive rolling straight to mid on"
"<b>is this a drop?</b> Mosaddek through his hands into a cut, and the ball flew to Guptill at point ... actually, it's bounced just in front of him. A stinger, and he wrings his hand in pain"
"a firm push to cover, and a dot ball, ends the over"
Mahmudullah lunges forward and pushes a single through cover
"<b>edged!</b> No slip in place, and the ball bounces down to third man. It was a genuine edge too"

"full, straight and it's dug out down the ground"
"short and rising outside off, Mahmudullah guiding it down to third man"
"nudged into space on the leg side, just the one though"
another quiet single through cover. Bangladesh needed someone to blast
"<b>flapped to cover!</b> Santner really held this one back. The ball was delivered at only 76km/h. Really, really slow. Mahmudullah tried to wait for it, but didn't wait long enough, flashing his stroke in the air and straight to Williamson at cover"
"Saifuddin is forward to drive, finding cover"
"<b>misfield at third man!</b> Saifuddin aimed a late cut down in that region, and it was Henry who set after it. He did the hard work, chasing it down, but then fluffed it at the last moment, letting the ball over the rope"
and a little backfoot punch ends the over
"tickled very fine off the legs, down to fine leg, just the one"
"<b>edged!</b> But short of Latham. It was the slower ball from Ferguson, a legcutter at just 118km/h. Mosaddek got a healthy edge, but it didn't quite carry"
"and a quicker follow-up, up to 143km/h, the ball chopped down to gully"
"Mosaddek times his slash down to third man well, but can only place it well enough for a single"
"quick and rising off a length at 143km/h, but his shot finds point directly"
"a 141km/h yorker is dug out into the leg side, just the single. Excellent death over from Ferguson - just three from it!"
"slapped out to deep point, off the back foot"
"a touch too short, but Mosaddek doesn't try anything fancy, working a single into the leg side"
"Saifuddin aims an ugly smear into the leg side. The timing's not there, but it's placed well enough for them to hustle two"
"pushed across the left hander, and it just keeps going with the arm. Saifuddin misses his cut, and it's quite wide ... but not quite wide enough to be called as such"
"<b>we have a review from New Zealand</b>, for an lbw shout. Saifuddin walked right across to the off side and set himself for a paddle sweep, but missed and was struck in the pad. Umpire Reiffel wasn't convinced, but Williamson has a punt. But Ultra Edge shows some contact of bat on ball, so the decision stands. Not out"
"<b>BOOM!</B> Santner has enjoyed a frugal day with the ball, until now. The very last ball of his spell is smeared up and over long on for six. There had just been the one boundary off him until this one. And it's a biggie"
"tapped down behind square, and they take the fielder on for a quick single"
"around the stumps comes Ferguson, mixing things up with a slower bouncer. Saifuddin can't do anything with it"
slapped out to cover point
"Ferguson steams in and unleashes a bouncer outside off, Saifuddin dropping his hands to let it pass him"
"<b>heaved to cow corner!</b> Not the prettiest stroke, but effective. It was a length delivery angled in to him, so the shot was on. And was well executed"
"slower ball, 119km/h, and Saifuddin can't lay bat on it but they steal a single off the pad"
"and he starts with a yorker, on his toes, that's dug out into the leg side"
"<b>Mosaddek holes out!</b> He was hoping to take that six count to two, but he got rather too underneath this attempted loft down the ground. It's Guptill who settles under it at long on, and he makes no mistake. Another Bangladesh batsman trudges off, having failed to really get going"

"Boult aims for a yorker, but it slips out as a low full toss that kisses the pads and rushes down the leg side for four"
"<b>excellent yorker, but it's gone for four!</b> How has Saifuddin got this away? It was a pinpoint delivery, and Saifuddin was lucky just to put bat to ball. He was luckier still that the ball took an inside edge and raced past short fine to the boundary"
"strong finish from Boult, forcing Saifuddin to dig a full one out back to him. And that ends his work with the ball today"
"full, wide and Mashrafe slashes it down to third man where Boult, who had just been placed down there, holds onto a simple catch"
"<b>two in two!</b> Saifuddin plants his foot and heaves to leg, but the ball is very full and bursts past him, shattering the stumps. Henry has his fourth, and Bangladesh are bowled out four balls short of their full fifty"
