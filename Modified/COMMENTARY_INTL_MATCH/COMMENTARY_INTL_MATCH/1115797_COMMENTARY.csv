"decent start from Cottrell. Good length again, on the hips, a rather routine flick through square leg for one"
"132 kph, persisting with a shortish length, around off, defended to point"
"runs down at Holder, a full delivery swinging in takes the inside half of the bat, skewed away towards deep midwicket for a couple. Make the second easily"
"<strong>terrific from Holder</strong>. Gets some extra bounce, angles it away from Munro too. A thick outside edge goes straight to a Test match gully, but there is no man there. One to third man"

"poor ball and put away. Short down leg, Munro whips the ball with a cross-batted swat through backward square leg, lovely timing"
"full on middle and leg, 136 kph, worked to mid-on"
"an early wicket for West Indies. Cottrell turns around, marches and salutes towards the dressing room. Not the best shot from Worker. It's short and a tad wide outside off, I reckon he picked the length early but just didn't choose the right shot. Worker tries a pull, instead of a cut, and the ball takes the under-edge onto the stumps. Playing that into the off side definitely the better option"

"a low full toss, 132 kph, driven to mid-on"
"135 kph, Cottrell strikes again. Shortish and wide outside off, he looks to cut the ball through third man, but the ball isn't there, it's too close to his body. Gets a thick edge on his cut, which carries at neck height to Gayle at wide slip."
"full delivery around off, driven to mid-off. Some pressure now on Munro to stay there for a while"
"good length around off, 133 kph, pushed to mid-on from the crease"
"one more! New Zealand in big trouble here. It's short again, and wider. That much was enough for Munro to go through with a cut, but there is extra bounce in this surface. Holder's angle takes it wider outside off too. All he does is get a thick edge on his cut which flies to Gayle at neck height at wide slip, AGAIN!"
"big, big appeal. No says umpire Shamshuddin. <b>But Holder reviews</b>. Is it high? Definitely pitched in line, full delivery, seaming in just a tad. Latham plays the line, but the ball finds a gap between bat and pad to hit Latham in front of off. No bat, nothing on HotSpot. Will come down to ball-tracking. It's going over the top of off, so West Indies lose their review. That's not a bad review, even though it seems a bad error."

"131 kph, good length around off, nudged to square leg"

"a masssssive appeal. No says the umpire. West Indies seem convinced, but they have no reviews left. There's no sound as the ball passes bat. Nothing on Snicko either. It's short around off, Taylor tries to swat the ball through midwicket, but no contact. <b>Wonder if the umpire should have given that out if he was 50-50, just to ensure the right decision was made?</b>"

"it's a nice short delivery, but there isn't enough zip on the ball. Latham swivels into a pull behind square leg. Gabriel runs around from fine leg to his right, puts in a dive, but the ball finds a way to the boundary. Good effort"

"full delivery outside off, defended into the off side"

"and again. Taylor is quick on the cut again, but can only find backward point"
"edged, but no slip. Overpitched outside off, Taylor looks to drive, but gets a thick outside edge, flies through the vacant slip region. That's unfortunate for Gabriel."

"one bounce to deep backward square leg. Flat around middle and leg, slog swept away, Taylor's favorite"

"flat and straight, pummeled straight past Taylor. Holder at long-on runs around to his right"
"lovely placement. Flat around middle and leg, another slog sweep, right in the gap. These are valuable runs. Nice cameo"
"one bounce to long-on this time. Flat, full and slog-swept away with as straight a bat as possible with this shot. Holder at long-on keeps them down to one"
"how did it go there? Full and straight from Gabriel, Nicholls gets underneath it and scoops it, the traditional way, but it somehow goes over slip and gully and to the third man boundary"
"overpitched and wide, the wide yorker, not a bad option, drilled to mid-off."
"smashed. A low full toss around off, Taylor walks out and whips the ball elegantly through the vacant square leg region. Can't miss your lengths, especially with a slippery ball"

"length ball, nips in late towards off, stays in the crease and punches"
"fullish outside off, throws his hands at it and gets an outside edge down to third man"
huge shout for lbw. Umpire Chris Brown takes his time to raise his finger but does eventually. This seems a very dodgy call. Kyle Hope is looking for a flick but the ball slides into him from a length and pins him on the pad. That really seemed to be heading down leg. By some distance. But Brown thought otherwise. This is where the non-striker plays an essential role but Hope walked away after seeing no response from Walton

"off-stump pegged back. What is happening here? Nine runs on the board, half the side gone. This is a scorching yorker. Got to feel for the batsman. This really was unplayable. Hits the blockhole and gets it to swing back in enough to take out the off-stump. Walton jams the bat down hurriedly but can't get anywhere underneath it. 3-0 seeming inevitable now"
