"gentle swing to start. Good length, swerving back in towards off. Rohit stays back to push to cover. So much time"
"oh shot. Swung away this time, and as a result, offers Rohit width. Rohit says thanks with a scythed cut through point. Nicely played."
"ooh yes. This one held its line. Not much movement. Good length outside off, Rohit pokes and is beaten"
"nice lines. Fullish around off, calmly defended into the backward point area"
"too full this time, but coming back in from outside off. Driven on the up, towards Baz at cover. A nasty bobble just as it was about to settle into his hands"
"this is some shot. Good length on middle and leg, Rohit gets high on his toes, both feet off the ground and clips to square leg. Races away, superb execution from Rohit"
"well played. Back of a length on off, not much movement. Guptill taps it towards point, looking for one but none on offer and so Rohit yells 'no, no'"
"a bit of movement this time. Fuller length outside off, Guptill comes forward to drive towards point."
"fantastic work from baz. Fullish and wide outside off, Guptill drives to his former opening partner at cover. Baz puts in a full-length dive to save some runs"
"poor delivery. Short and wide, what do you expect? Rohit thrashes a cut in front of backward point. A quarter-stop from Jadeja"
"ooh, bat says umpire Nandan. There was no bat. There were two pads.That was out, I guess. Fullish and swerving back in, Rohit pokes from the crease. The inswinger comes back in and strikes him right in front. Plumb"
what a response. Rohit shimmies down to the full outswinger outside off and lofts it with a clean swing of the bat. Way over the wide long-off boundary. Nicely done
"clever batting. Slower delivery on off, turned away to midwicket"
"fullish outside off, no movement at all. Blocked from the front foot"
"another slower delivery outside off, 112 kph. Rohit stays in the crease and works to gully."
superb batting. Rohit on fire. Another slower delivery but short and wide outside off. Rohit drags his pull and times it exquisitely to the midwicket boundary. Fantastic
"another slower delivery but closer to off, whipped to wide mid-on"
another slower delivery to finish. Outside off. Guptill chooses the right option. Punches off the back foot to Baz
"nicely played. Good length outside off, glided off the open face to third man for one"
poor delivery. Leg stump line on Guptill's pads who easily flicks to deep square leg
132 kph. Nagging lines around off. Driven to cover from the crease
"six more. My oh my. This is awesome. Backs away, makes room, gets a full delivery. And powers the lift over long-off. Clean. Superlative timing"
"gone this time. What an innings that was promising to be, but it has ended. Concludes with another superbly-timed pull. Back of a length on middle, Rohit pulls but fails to keep it down and hits it exquisitely. Maybe a bit of arrogance thinking he could clear the boundary, and didn't bother rolling his wrists on the pull. Massive wicket"
"excellent shot. Back of a length on middle, Rana hammers is pull over square leg. Did not bother keeping it down because square leg was up. Nice"
good length on off. Nice start. Defended off the front foot
"awful delivery. Strays down leg, Guptill helps the offering on its way to the fine leg boundary."
"poor shot and Guptill goes. Smith gets one again. Good length outside off, Guptill chooses the wrong shot. Chooses to drag the pull instead of the off side. As a result, he struggled to get enough behind the ball. Toe-ended to Bravo at mid-on"
"too much width. Shortish delivery outside off, Krunal rocks on the back foot and punches the drive through point. Lovely stroke, easily hit"
"better line. Fullish on off, patted to point"
"and another. Smith gets another. What is happening? Back of a length on middle, Krunal chooses to pull but cannot keep it down. More of a top edge and carries all the way to square leg. Finch runs across and holds on."
full on off to start. Buttler strides forward to block
"slower delivery on off, another defensive stroke after a lunge"
hoing in around that off stump. Buttler blocks to point
"beaten. Good length outside off, some away movement. Buttler pokes and is beaten."
"whew, this one deviated back in prodigiously. Back of a length outside off, the ball jags back in and goes through bat and pad. Yikes, Buttler cut in half."
"ah, strays this time and pays the price. Down leg and Buttler tickles it away, to the fine leg boundary"
"the first ball Rana is playing after 12 balls. Full and wide outside off, ramped off the open face to third man with an angled bat"
goes wide of the crease and bowls a  nippy outswinger outside off which is defended
drifts down leg and worked to deep square leg
drifting down leg this time and nudged to midwicket
"excessively short and wide outside off, Buttler shaped to play but bailed out wisely. Wide called"
"slower delivery outside off, pushed away to deep cover"
"nice end. Another short delivery on off, climbing steeply on NR who sways out of the line, his hands by his stomach. Well played"
"flat on middle, pushed to long-on against the spin"
"flatter trajectory on off, not much spin. Punched to cover"
another flat delivery outside off. Rana picks the length very early and unfurls a scythed cut to point. Good stop at point by Dhawal
"flat again but down leg, nurdled away to midwicket"
lovely shot again. Much too short from Jakati. JB has enough time to rock back and swat to wide long-on
"hmm, was that a chance? Tossed up outside off, miscued back to the bowler. May have landed in front of him, and through him for a run"
"what a shot. Short and wide, poor delivery. Buttler cuts and places it nicely. Gets it in front of point and races away to the point boundary"
"wider of the crease, jags back in. Pushed to cover"
"yorker on leg, jammed out towards the keeper. Buttler calls his partner through"
"nice short delivery. Down leg, Buttler surprised by the length takes his eyes off the ball and plays a nothing pull. Missed"
"nicely played. Buttler's timing is good. Fullish on off, pushed past a diving cover for a couple"
"another short and wide delivery, Buttler shapes to pull but withdraws late"
"good length delivery on off, Rana opens up his bat face to get one to third man"
"slower delivery, picked by JB. Whipped past midwicket. A half-stop but two nonetheless"
"drifting down leg, clipped to midwicket"
"shortish and wide, Rana backs away in attempt to chop over point but no connection"
"another slow delivery on leg, Rana gets very low to sweep on the bounce to deep square leg"
"yikes. Another poor shot. Back of a length outside off, Buttler misses his forehand pull. Off side would have been a better place to hit to"
"flat down leg, worked to short fine leg for a run"
"flat on off, tucked to deep midwicket. The pair are happy with one  but a misfield allows the second"
"flat on off, punched off the back foot to long-on"
"just enough to clear long-on. Flat delivery outside off, again not a great shot. But Rana drags a sweep over long-on. if he gets enough on it, who am I to argue? Nice execution"
turned to short fine leg
"lovely shot from Buttler. Flat on off, comes on with the arm. Buttler stays back and laces a cut wide of point. Sublime timing. Buttler looking ominous"
"may be above waist. yes, No ball called. Very high outside off, Rana wanted to punch towards cover but surprised by the height he gets there late. the ball skews off the outside half past point for four"
"the free hit is punished. Full on leg, Rana clears a front foot and clobbers the swat over midwicket. Nice timing"
"yorker on off, jammed out to point"
"another misfield allows another run. Fullish and wide outside off, driven to cover. Finch tumbles over"
"121 kph, shortish length outside off. Awkwardly dabbed to point"
"109 kph, the slower delivery is clipped towards midwicket"
lost his line totally. A short and wide delivery to the right-hander. But well down leg to the leftie
"short and wide, 120 kph. Rana gets off his feet to cut but no connection"
"drifts down leg, works to deep midwicket"
"89 kph, flat and straight. Rana backs away but mis-times his cut to point."
"low full toss, drilled to long-off"
"flat and full outside off, rana gets to his heave a bit early and mis-times to midwicket. Just the one again"
"flat and short on middle, sits up for JB to smash to deep midwicket. What a shot"
"oh no, Jakati has erred too full and pays the price for it. Rana lunges forward, clears the foot and slog-sweeps over long-on. Crunchy sound of the bat. Easily over the boundary"
"127 kph, full toss down leg. Worked down to fine leg"
"nice batting. Picks his spot. the slower delivery outside off. Rana lofts the cover drive, aware that mid-off is up. A well-executed boundary"
"slower delivery on off, ramped off the open face to third man"
"128 kph. good length outside off, punched off the back foot to point"
"what a catch! Very similar to the Mishra dismissal earlier this season. Overpitched delivery on off, Buttler drills his drive back to the bowler. Bravo sways out of the line of the delivery and then sticks out his hands, the ball sticks and Buttler had his head down immediately"
"Pollard shimmies down, Bravo digs a short delivery in. Bunted back, bravo comes and picks up. Walks up to Pollard and bumps into him. No smiles this time. A hard, cold stare between the West indians"
"tossed up this time on off, smashed back to long-on"
"lots of flight on off, pushed to long-off. A fumble from Bravo but no damage"
"swatted into the midwicket boundary. Jakati erring in length again, cannot bowl so full to Rana. Rana gets on one knee and slogs away gleefully"
"oh beauty. The variation. Came off like a legspinner, carrom ball? The ball moves away and beats the bat"
short and pulled into the midwicket boundary. Jakati drops one into Rana's arc who stays back and wallops it
"what a shot. Shortish and wide, Rana picks the length so quickly again. Gets low and scythes the cut away beautifully done"
"back of a length on off, Pollard stands tall and punches back to the bowler"
"another shortish length delivery outside off, pushed to mid-off and calls for the run immediately"
"miscued over point for a couple. Rocked back deep in the crease, got a full delivery outside off and looked to go over cover. But skewed off for two"
"short and dispatched. Massive. Just a touch short, Rana picks the length and crashed away with a cross-batted swat. Just clears the midwicket fielder on the boundary"
"slower delivery on leg, nudged to square leg"
"nice stop from Raina. Fuller than a back of a length, pulled with decent timing to midwicket where Raina dives full-length to prevent the ball from going through. Fell over the ball"
back of a length on leg from around the wicket. pollard closes his bat face too early and is struck in the midriff. A leg bye to point
drifts down leg and a wide called
slower dipping yorker outside off. Rana misses his drive after shimmying down
"another slower delivery and smashed. Gets low, and then somehow gets enough power behind his swipe to the midwicket boundary"
"another slower delivery on off, slashed to deep point"
"full down leg, Pollard misses a routine flick off his thigh pad. Another leg bye"
"slower delivery works. A good length delivery, moving away from Rana who is through his smear too early. Ended up just lifting the ball in the air to deep square leg who settled under the sitter. But a fantastic knock from Nitish R"
"shortish down leg, helped on its way to fine leg. Just the one"
"how has he got enough on that? Seemed like a mis-hit but it has flown over long-on. Short delivery on off, Pollard mis-timed his pull. A bit of a top edge too, and it still clears the fielder. Hmm"
"amazing change up. Speared in very wide outside off, but just inside the guideline. Polly is beaten"
"and again. A low full toss but very wide outside off, all Pollard can do is dig it back to the bowler"
"missed his length and he gets rewarded for it. Dhawal gets lucky. Full toss outside off, Pollard mis-times his big hit. Spliced off the outside half, Smith runs in and takes an easy catch at long-on"
"a naughty full toss outside off, Pandya comes down but misses his drive"
short delivery outside off. Too high and called
"good length on middle, Bhajji is cramped for room and pats it back to the right of Bravo, who is bowling from around the wicket. Bravo dives but can only half stop"
"slow dipper on leg, pummeled away with discernible use of the bottom hand. Square leg fields"
"slower delivery outside off, inside-edged onto the body but an easy run at this stage"
yorker. Speared in. Jammed back. Excellent bowling. Exemplary over so far
"superb yorker again. Pandya can't do much. He backs away to try to make some room, but Bravo follow him and crushes Pandya's toe."
"shortish outside off, bunted to long-off for a run"
speared in the blockhole on leg. Kept out
"slower delivery this time outside off, Harbhajan swats the legcutter in the air but straight to deep midwicket. Raina runs in, settles underneath and completes the reverse-supped catch with plenty of ease"
"shot! Overpitched on off, missed his yorker by so little. Panyda clears his front foot and drills it back, to the long-off boundary"
"another yorker, skewed to long-on. Just the one, good fielding from Jadeja prevents the second run"
"another slower delivery outside off, toe-ended to cover for one. Impressive variations these from PK"
"low full toss on leg, Pandya clears his feet but miscues a catch to long-on. Did not get anything behind it. Bat turned in his hand"
zip with the new ball! Pitches on a good length on middle and leg and hits Finch on the thigh as he played across the line with a closed face
"lovely delivery! Full, straight and plumb. Finch was again playing across the line, and he was stuck on the crease while doing so. Should have come forward to negotiate the length better. As such he allowed the ball to pitch and skid on. Can't bring his bat in line with it either because the front pad was in the way"
"fuller ball outside off, pushed into the covers"
jumps up to get on top of the bounce of a shortish delivery on middle
"backs away, but Vinay follows him. Cramped for room by a back of a length delivery, Raina clips to midwicket"
swing and a miss! Raina cleared his front leg and gave it everything he had. Problem was he had made too much room and the ball simply whizzed tamely past off stump. <b>Wicket-maiden</b>
"goes for his favoured length straight away. Yorker-ish, but in the process he has sprayed it down leg. McCullum flicks and misses"
"aims for Baz's toe again, the batsman manages to get the toe of the bat in the way and save himself a bruise"
"straightens and in doing so, has missed off stump! A mightily full delivery angled into off stump, McCullum gives it the full whack and misses. The ball pitches and seams away from its target"
yorker gone wrong and the low full toss has been drilled past mid-off's left
awful delivery. Completely loses his line. Strays well down leg
goes wider of the crease and jags a length delivery back. Baz scythes it away to backward point
"134 kph. Another drifter, goes down leg. McCullum gloves his pull towards the keeper"
a short delivery is nicely pulled to backward square leg for a run. Nice direction from Bumrah
"oh no. uh oh, uh oh. Fullish and wide, sweetly driven to Hardik P at cover. Goes through his hands and through his legs too. Four lucky runs"
"shortish delivery outside off, Raina anticipated that length but slapped to mid-on. bounced just in front of a diving Krunal P. A bit of miscommunication, but Baz has made his crease at the bowler's end"
"another short delivery outside off, Raina backs away but inside-edges to the keeper"
another swat from the back foot. Just waited on the back foot for the short length. Gets it and toe-ends the pull over midwicket. Still enough for four
"another one. Backs away, a short delivery outside off and cut away intentionally over extra cover. Didn't bother keeping it down, lovely batting from Raina"
"another short delivery. Poor stuff from Mitch M. Too predictable. Short and wide outside off, Raina backs away again and lays into the cut. A bit of a top edge and it flies over third man"
"phew, what happened there? A low full toss on leg, McCullum drilled it back. The ball struck Vinay's foot in his follow through. Quite lucky that it hit the shoe. Could have been much much worse"
"loses his line. A low full toss down leg, clipped past square leg for four easy runs. Knew the location of the fielders, placed it nicely."
"good riposte. Fuller than a good length on leg, pushed back to the bowler"
"nicely stopped from Pollard. Fullish and wide outside off, driven towards cover. Pollard gets across and stops the ball with a dive"
"139 kph, Raina backs away but this is fuller. He mistimes his drive back to the bowler. vinay may have got some hand on the ball, but Baz made his crease. A single to mid-on"
"smeared away. Low full toss on middle, badly miscued to wide mid-on where a dive prevents the boundary"
"what a shot to greet him. Full and wide outside off, McCullum reaches out for it and then gets enough behind is lofted drive for four over cover. Nice"
"fantastic effort from Hardik. Short on middle, pummeled pull to wide square leg. Hardik runs around to the ball from midwicket to stop the boundary. Great stop, saves his brother some runs"
"not very sweet but four. Tossed up on middle, Baz runs down and mis-times his swipe to the long-on boundary. Mid-on had no chance"
"ooh, flat on middle. Baz misread the length and played back. Somehow got bat on his cut to short third man. he is very late to react but gets there in the end. A good throw would have had Raina"
"slowish on middle and leg, clipped to deep midwicket"
short and six! Sits up for Baz on the back foot who takes on the deep midwicket fielder. baz wins as the pull soars over the boundary. Fantastic stroke-making from BM
"lucky, and four too. A slower offcutter deceives Raina who gets low to sweep. A thick outside edge lobs over the keeper, and in between short third man as well. Scurries across the outfield to the third man boundary"
"back of a length down leg, Raina swivels into his pull but straight to short fine leg"
"mis-timed but enough. Wow, these aren't particularly long boundaries. Fullish on leg, Raina clears a foot and clobbers the cross-batted swat. Way over midwicket. Caught by a sub in the dugout"
"dropped. Bumrah did not expect the return catch to return so slowly. But that was because it was a slower ball.. raina mis-times his drive and carries at head height back to the bowler, who gets his head out of the way after panicking. A chance goes down"
"four more. Low full toss down leg, easily worked away to the backward square leg boundary. Not good bowling at all"
"another slower delivery outside off, plenty of width for Baz to lace. A powerful drive is muscled over cover. What batting. Making this look seem so easy"
"oh no, that is not what Mumbai needed after the time out. Short and wide, an easy offering and Raina's well-timed, well-placed cut earns him four"
over adjusts his line and four more. Down leg and Raina just turns the flick past short fine leg. Scurries away
"flat outside off, punched to long-on"
"flat outside off, mcCullum runs down but defends it back. Good improvisation"
"so quick on the pull. Flat on off and middle, McCullum goes back and sensational bat speed hurries his pull to midwicket"
"slowish outside off, played away towards point"
"another poor start. Short on middle and leg, McCullum eases into his pull to deep square leg. Easy as you like"
"four more. Short outside off this time, MCCullum clatters his cut in front of cover. The sweeper cover - H Pandya - gets there but cannot stop it. Four more"
"much slower and straighter, pushed to long-off"
"short and wide, cut straight to point. Another poor delivery"
"oh nice. Slowed right up outside off, Raina misses a square drive"
"81 kph, slow on off, pushed to long-off"
"shortish delivery again on leg, clipped to deep square leg"
shot again. Shortish delivery with a bit of width. Slapped away to deep point
a nice delivery on off but Raina shuffles right across to get inside the line and flick to fine leg
"back of a length on off, pulled in the gap at square leg but Pollard gets across with a full-length dive to save the boundary"
"nice. Rolled his wrists over it. Back of a length on off, Raina got over the ball to pull to deep square leg"
"full down leg, another poor delivery. He gets away with it as Baz misses a flick. The ball thuds into the pad and on to square leg for an extra"
a much slower variation from Bhajji. Baz waits for the ball but is still through his pull too early. Struck on the body
"what's happened there? May have been the topspinner outside off, McCullum misses another pull as the ball swerves past his bat. The ball comes back in to clip the off bail. An anti-climax as McCullum has to go. Bowled."
"tossed up but down leg, worked away to short fine leg"
"flatter delivery on off, Raina hurries back to punch to long-on"
"too slow. Lots of air on leg, Karthik easily nudges to square leg"
"mis-hit. Flat on off, Raina runs down to hit over cover but the ball drifts onto the bat, and therefore off the inside half of the bat"
"poor delivery yet again. Short down leg, Raina helps it along its way. Past short fine leg for four to bring up yet another IPL fifty."
and again. Mumbai aren't doing themselves any favours by bowling like this. Another hit-me delivery on leg and Raina swivel-pulls over short fine leg. More easy runs.
"134 kph, good length outside off. Raina runs down and bunts a drive to mid-off"
"good length, swerving back in. Nudged to fine leg"
"awful lines. Full down leg, Vinay lucky that Raina didn't get bat on it. Off the pad to square leg"
"given! Karthik is not happy at all. And he has the right to be. Back of a length down leg, off the thigh pad to the keeper. Umpire Chaudhary has got this one wrong. Another poor delivery from Vinay, but the thin sound that was heard was plausibly responsible for the umpire's decision"
"flat down leg, clipped to square leg"
"flat outside off, pushed to midwicket"
"whew. What a shot. Slightly short on middle and leg, Smith gets low, gets the length and clobbers the pull way over square leg. What timing, what power."
"slightly short again but much wider outside off, pushed to long-off from the back foot"
"much fuller outside off, Raina tried to inside-out drive over cover but not quite got enough. Mis-timed to the sweeper cover"
"another short one, down leg. Whipped to square leg"
"back of a length on off, nips back in. Clipped to deep midwicket"
straight up and taken. Another awful awful delivery from Bumrah but it has resulted in another wicket. Raina tried to help it on its way but went too hard. A thick leading edge is skied. A white object against a dark background descends into Buttler's gloves
"back of a length outside off, punched to cover"
"dispatched with disdain. Good length on off, Smith stands and thumps the ball back over the bowler. How dare you, Smith says"
"another nippy inswinger with the angle on middle and leg, nurdled to midwicket"
"fullish down leg, Smith misses a flick and is rapped on the pads. Sliding down leg"
"slowed up but on Jadeja's pads, flicks to midwicket"
"well bowled. Slowish but flat on off, Jadeja strides forward to defend"
"slightly short and wide, slapped easily to deep point"
"tossed up and whacked. In Smith's arc on middle and leg, he gets low and slog-sweeps it easily over midwicket after getting underneath"
"short and wide, tear-your-hair bowling. Smith smashes it off the back foot. Goes back and crunches the cut through cover."
much fuller on off and easily driven to long-off
"four more. Not a bad delivery but four more. Good length on off, Smith pulls and gets it off the inside half of the bat, that helps take it behind square and in the gap"
"good length on off, punched back off the back foot"
good lines. Nagging away on off and middle but Smith makes his own room by backing away and punching to cover
"138 kph, good length on off. Steered to backward point"
"what was that? Fullish on off, Smith tries an unnecessary scoop but gets in an awful position. Hits it into his own body and it balloons up for a run"
"fullish and swerves back in. The movement is responsible for the inside half being found, again. In the gap and to the midwicket boundary"
"good length on off, Smith pummels a drive to mid-off. Goes through the fielder, some awful fielding this time by Rohit. So hard that was hit. Nothing going right for Mumbai"
"fullish on middle, Smith misses a heave but the ball sneaks in to hit Smith on the back leg"
"an ugly hoick. Back of a length on off, squeezed to deep midwicket"
"134 kph, loopy tennis-ball bounce over Jadeja's head for a wide. Mumbai's fate all but sealed"
"back of a length outside off, badly hit to mid-off. Wanted to hit that straighter but went to Pollard at mid-off"

"slower delivery outside off, pushed to cover"
overpitched and drilled to long-on for one
worked to short fine leg for a run. A direct hit at the striker's end ricochets away towards sweeper cover. Smith lazily runs back for the overthrow but has just made his crease in time.
"112 kph, symbolic of the whole innings. A slower delivery down leg, Jadeja gets bat on his tickle to the fine leg boundary"
"back of a length and closer to off stump, played down towards point for one"
"overpitched on off, squeezed to deep point for one more"
"strays down leg, wide. Shocker"
"back of a length on middle, clipped towards midwicket. The bowler gets around to stop the ball"
"yorker outside off, squirted to deep point"
a good length delivery is pushed away to point. Jadeja wants one but is sent back
good short delivery. Surprises Jadeja who decides not to interfere
"full and wide. Oh my, that is Guptill. Not sure if things can get worse. Driven to the sweeper cover where Guptill rushes onto it and lets it go through his legs. Yikes."
"that is it. <strong>Gujarat Lions have confirmed their playoffs spot</strong> with a quality chase. They finish top two as well. Fullish and wide outside off, skewed over the off-side infield for the winning runs"
