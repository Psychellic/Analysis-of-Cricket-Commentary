"length, goes across him as he shapes to work it away through fine leg. No touch, as it goes through to the keeper"
"short, angles in, and he takes on the deep backward square leg in place. Just evades him, to his right, with a hook"
"back of a length, decent pace at <strong>133.9 kph</strong>, and he defends from the crease"
"short again, and this time he plays a really attractive short-arm jab towards deep square leg. <strong>Flat six!</strong>"
"fullish, around off, and he drives towards extra cover"
"length, angles in,and he works it off his pads towards deep square leg"
"length, angles back in, and he defends towards short mid-wicket"
"length, a bit of nip away off the seam, and he presses forward to defend"
"back of a length, hit towards point"
"back of a length, looks to go towards mid-wicket, but that hurries on to him. Possibly off the toe-end of the bat, and drops on the off side"
"this is fuller, and he whips it off his legs. That has carried a long way into the deep mid-wicket region"
"lofted straight drive, to another fuller ball. Strange tactics from Adair, who was doing quite well when he was bashing it just back of a length. Ahmadi leans into a fuller ball on the stumps, and gets it to the long on fence on a couple of bounces"
"full, but on the pads. <strong>Don't bowl to Gurbaz there!</strong> There's a deep square leg in place, but he can only watch as this has been flicked to his left"
"length, around off, defended"
"<strong>good ball!</strong> Pitches outside off, and just seams away a touch. He's beaten as he belatedly tries to withdraw his bat"
"<strong>and then the in-dipper!</strong> This is good bowling from Craig Young. Fullish length, just around off, and perhaps a shade of movement back off the seam, but Gurbaz has played all over it. Looks to press forward and drive, but in the process leaves a substantial gap between bat and pad. The death rattle behind him tells him it's time to go. He'll live and learn from errors like these"
"length, around leg stump, and defended towards short midwicket"
"length, around off, driven to mid off"
"back of a length, and he rocks back within the crease to pull this away. There's a sweeper in the deep at mid-wicket, though"
"back of a length, and he defends"
"fuller length, driven back to the bowler"
"length, but strays down the pads a bit, and he can work it off his pads towards deep backward square. Two runs on offer for him with some hard running"
"hits a hard length, but starts way outside off, seaming further away. Called a wide, as Rahmat lets it pass"
"length, swings away from outside off, and he shoulders arms to this"
"length, angles back in from around off, and he defends after getting behind the line"
"<strong>that's not far from a catch at deep mid-wicket!</strong> Young bangs it in short, and Ahmadi takes on the pull. The ball lands just short of McCollum in the deep, who dives to his left. Just goes past him to the boundary in the process"
"goes fuller, but cannot find the yorker length. Angles into Ahmadi, who whips this away in front of square. Much better control and placement"
"length, around off, and he takes the invitation to go over mid-off. This has gone higher than far, though, and Mark Adair goes back and takes a <strong>superb catch over his left shoulder</strong>! A bit of a rush of blood for Ahmadi, who had already extracted eight from two balls, and in trying to make it 12 from three, has ended up offering the Irish a chance, that they take beautifully. Credit to Young as well, for continuing to hit a good length despite the boundary off the previous ball. Adair caught that while tracking back, and over his head, with his hands extended beyond his head"
"length, just angles down leg and Rahmat, now on strike, can defend"
"<strong>Shah is gone!</strong> Length ball, outside off, and he looks to go for the drive, but ends up skewing it towards point. Tector leaps to his right and times his jump perfectly, getting both hands on it, to end Shah's stay. He looks on in disbelief, and then starts to drag himself across the ground"
"length, worked off his pads towards deep mid-wicket. No protection there, so they can come back for the second"
"fullish ball, and beats the inside edge as Shahidi looks to defend. Stifled appeal for leg before"
"this straightens a bit more, and strikes him on the pad again! Another sfitled appeal. Both balls probably just going down leg"
"goes back and lofts this towards deep mid-wicket. There's a man at deep square leg, who is able to get around and keep it down to two"
works one angling into him on to the square leg region
"strikes him on the pads again. Quickish ball, that perhaps will go down leg"
"this turns across him from outside off. Not much that the batsman can do about it, expect admire. And be thankful it doesn't catch the edge"
"length, down the leg side as he shapes to glance"
"yorker, cramping him for room, and he can only glance this off the inside of his bat to fine leg"
"length, straightens into him from around leg and middle, and he defends"
"length, around leg, worked away towards deep fine leg"
"length, presses forward to meet this under his eyes with a dead bat"

"fuller, driven through cover. Will pick up two"

"length, around off, and defended from the crease"
"length, a bit of width, and Afghan goes back to punch this. Off the inner part of the bat, down to ground, on the off side"
"length, angles across him from off and middle, and he blocks, pressing forward"
"<strong>what a good ball!</strong> Possibly an off-cutter by the left-arm seamer, that just angles across Afghan as he shapes to defend. Very close to the outside edge as it goes through to Tucker. The bowler and wicketkeeper react with excitement, but they don't bother with the review"
"length, goes back to punch this towards cover"
"shorter, and he goes back again. Cracked to cover yet again"
"fuller, faster, and defended after shuffling back and across"
"tossed up just outside off, and he stretches forward to defend"
"<strong>what a ball!</strong> Tossed up, around off and middle, and then turns sharply across him. beating the outside edge, the off stump, and also evading the full grasp of Tucker"
defended with a forward press
"length, around off, defended towards cover-point"
"length, angles across him and he defends"

"length, defended towards cover-point off the back foot"
"length, and he defends off the back foot"
"length, around off, and defended"
"length, turns across him, and he waits on it, before guiding it just to the left of first slip. Will pick up a single"
goes back and works this with the turn towards square leg
"fullish length, and he presses forward to meet it. Off the inner edge, and runs away towards fine leg. They pick up two, but it's far from convincing"
"fuller length again, and <strong>it catches the edge</strong>, but goes to the left of second slip! Shahidi does well to not push at it, and that takes it along the ground towards third man"
"sweeps from outside off. Struck on the pads, and a loud appeal for leg before, but they don't review"
"<strong>gone this time!</strong> The field placements work, as McBrine gets this to pitch around off and bite sharply. Hashmatullah Shahidi is looking to defend, but it flies off the edge, and the man at second slip, now stationed at short gully, is Balbirnie himself. Sharp catch taken"
"length, outside off, and he smacks this hard, but straight to cover"
"length, just around off, and he defends"
"fuller length, angles across him, and <strong>beats the outside edge</strong> as Afghan looks to press forward to defend"
"wide of off, and full enough to allow a drive wide of mid-off. Single on offer, and taken"
"length, just around off, and a bit of seam movement across the right-hander. Nabi defends, bat close to body"
"back of a length, surprises Nabi with the bounce. He aims to push to mid-off, but gets it off the inside edge, running towards backward square"
"fullish length, and he looks to press forward and defend. It runs away to fine leg, but given as byes. Superb bowling yet again! Just kept a bit low, and ended up nutmegging Tucker"
"length, presses forward to defend"
"fired in a touch quicker, just around off. Nabi presses forward to defend"
"worked with the turn towards mid-on. They pinch a quick single, as the man there has to move quickly to his right"

"length, worked towards square leg"
"fullish, around off, driven in the air, but through the gap between point and wide cover"
"back of a length, and he defends"

"short, close to his body, and he lets it pass. A change-up at <strong>120 kph</strong>"
"length, punched towards point"
"length, around off, and he looks to press forward to defend. Off the inner part of the bat, on to pad, and falls away to cover"
"length, around off, and he gets outside the line, and unleashes a good, flat sweep. McBrine won't mind that, as he exposed a lot of his stumps in doing so"
"length, outside off, and he puts in a massive forward stride to defend"
"length, and he goes back to work it with the turn towards mid-wicket"
"tries the sweep again, but this is wider on off. Perhaps got a bit of glove, but anyway went into his body and dropped by on the off side. Bowled much slower by McBrine"
"length, invites him to stretch forward, and he defends"

"short of a length, and he works it to short mid-wicket"
"short, and he goes inside out with a drive. Cannot beat extra cover"
"length, goes on with the arm, and he drives to cover"
"down the wicket, and <strong>holed out to deep mid-wicket</strong>! This is clever bowling from Simi Singh. He has put enough pressure with a sequence of dots. Gets this one to hang out a little around off, and invites the lofted drive from Afghan. I think the captain was trying to go straighter, but ended up turning his bat during the shot. Easy catch in the end for the sweeper out in the deep"
"length, and he pushes forward to defend"
"forceful swipe across the line, to one pitching outside off. Gets it along the ground to deep mid-wicket"
"oh dear! What a shot from Zadran. Goes for the reverse sweep off the first ball he faces from Tector. It goes off his gloves and pops up to the left of slip, where Stirling has the easiest of catches to complete"
"sharp turn from outside off. Some extra bounce too, as Rashid leaves"
"slapped towards cover, and nearly carries to Balbirnie placed there"

"fullish, driven back towards long on"
goes back to punch this against the spin towards cover-point
"length, and he presses forward to defend"
"<strong>oh, smart bowling!</strong> This was almost a seam-up ball, delivered flatter and quicker. Rashid looks to stretch forward to defend, but is beaten on the outside edge"
"struck as he looks to sweep. Not given leg before, but <strong>Balbirnie reviews</strong>! Just a question of impact, I reckon. It's a good ball, accurate as always, and strikes Rashid almost around his waist, but he has gone really low in an attempt to sweep. Might stay with umpire's call, though. No bat involved, as that bounced over the outside edge. That might also be an indication of the excess bounce on this. Impact is outside the line, in fact, so <strong>Ireland will also lose this review</strong>"
"length, around off, defends with a forward press"
"full, around off, and crashed away to cover-point"
"length, sharp turn back into him from outside off. He backs away and nudges this towards point"
"length, and he walks across his stumps and looks to work it away on the on side. Tector appeals, but looks like that has gone through the gap between the batsman and leg gully. It's gone through his legs, in fact, down to fine leg"
struck on the pads as he goes back to play. Perhaps a bit too much turn from outside off
"length, turns across him, and he shapes to flick. Taken by leg gully, but no bat on it. Just off the thigh pad"

"length, just outside off, at about 131 kph, and he defends to point"
"slower ball, the cutter outside off, and he lofts it as he looks to check an intended drive. Through the vacant extra cover region to the sweeper in the deep"
"length, presses forward to place this to the left of cover. They go through for a quick single"
"<strong>was that a drop?</strong> Slower ball, taken on the full by Rashid. Plays it right back to Young's right. And he gets his fingertips to it, but cannot hold on"
"short, slower ball again, cutting back into him. Rashid defends with a little hop"
"fullish, outside off, driven towards extra cover. The fielder in the deep has time to sweep, but they come back for the second"
"swings this across the line, fetching it from outside off. Deep mid-wicket gets across to his left, around cow corner, and pulls it back. Great effort from Simi Singh"
"length, goes back and punches this with the turn towards long on"
"length, and he skips down the wicket and goes big over long off. In the end, hasn't cleared it by a whole lot, but it's effective batting at this stage"
"length, goes back and plays this towards mid-wicket"
"fullish, and he defends with a forward press. Seemed to catch him by surprise with some excess turn"
"walks across and looks to play this towards fine leg. Called a wide, as it turns sharply across him"

"length, looks to whip it away towards mid-wicket. Off the inside edge, and hits his pads. Rolls away towards the keeper"
"<strong>that's an interesting shot!</strong> He anticipates a short ball, and ducks under it. Young does bash it in short of a length. And he swats this above his head, towards fine leg"
hangs back and punches this past point towards the sweeper in the deep
"length, around leg and middle, and he swings this around towards deep mid-wicket. On a couple of bounces through to the sweeper"
"length, pushes it with the turn towards short midwicket"
"length, down the leg side, as Naib shapes to flick. Tucker whips the bails off instinctively, but his back foot was well inside"
"<strong>GOT 'IM THIS TIME!</strong> That's a crucial wicket at this stage. Simi gets this to start from closer to off stump, and then turns in. Naib shapes to play down the wicket -- nothing wrong with his shot selection per se -- but is perhaps surprised by both the turn and the pace at which it comes through. Goes between bat and pad and strikes the top of middle. Simi Singh lets out a little pump of the fist in celebration"

"length, and he skips down the wicket. Heaves it down the ground, along the floor to long off"
"fullish, driven to backward point"

"slower ball, but down the leg side"
"length, runs it towards deep backward point. The man at deep point gets across this time, and is able to keep them down to two"
"length, and he drives to the left of cover. Quick single to retain strike"
"dropped short, and he looks to slap this over mid-off, but cannot clear him! Little comes around the wicket, and bowls that slower-ball bouncer into the pitch. Rashid goes back and across, and perhaps would have earned himself a wide if he had left that lone. Plonked to the man at mid-off, just to his right"
"slower ball, nudged towards third man. Oh, what timing on this! It runs away wide of third man, and just keeps on going. Using whatever little pace was on offer, no pun intended..."
"dug in shorter, and he gets this on this pads as he hops to play it away on the on side. Leg bye pinched before cover and point can converge on this"
"length, works it off his pads towards deep square leg"
"short of a length, outside off, and he plays a late cut down on the bounce to third man"
"length, swatted away down the ground. There is long on in place, but has no chance as this rifles past him to his left"
"fullish, and he walks across to expose his stumps. Wants to lap this towards point, but ends up getting it away to fine leg. Perhaps a late adjustment just to clear the keeper"
"yorker, and he moves away to play this towards point"
backs away and reverse scoops this over third man. This is quite extraordinary late order batting!
"back of a length, punched towards wide cover"
"goes across to play the reverse lap again. <strong>Given out leg before</strong>, but he chooses to review this. Nothing in this innings surprises me anymore. It looks fairly adjacent. Fairly full, and he seems to have made up his mind to play that. It's actually got an inside edge, though. So this will have to be reversed!"
"short, and strikes him just below the right shoulder as he looks to swing it away. Pops up towards short third man"
"length, around off, cutting back in, and he defends"
"length, outside off, and he looks to drive through covers. Off the inside edge, and down towards the keeper, along the ground. Another cutter, I suspect"

"<strong>foxed hm completely!</strong> Slow, loopy bouncer, outside off, and Stirling has a swipe at it but cannot connect"
"length, around off, nipping back in, and he defends"
"length, punches towards point. A slight misfield, or a half-stop to be more precise, allows a single"
"slower ball, perhaps back-of-the-hand stuff, from outside off, and he is forced to block this towards point"
"length, down the leg side, and he attempts to get a glance going. Off the pads, and a good collection low to his left by Gurbaz"
"fullish, and he gets this past cover with a drive. Wide cover goes chasing after and can keep it from going to the fence"

"gone for the sweep, but has been struck outside off, as he picks one out of the line outside off. Loud appeal, but no review"
"this is closer. Gets one to straighten from around off. McCollum is looking to stretch and defend, and has been <strong>struck in front</strong>. Given out leg before, and they run out of time while discussing it. Not much wrong with the decision, I reckon. Perhaps didn't turn as much as he anticipated, which is why he ended up playing outside the line. Would have gone on to hit leg stump"
"short of a length, slower again, and he hangs back in his crease, and bashes this through the gap between mid-wicket and mid on"
"length, and he guides it off the back foot towards short third man"
"short again, and he pulls this between mid-wicket and mid-on. Asghar Afghan goes chasing after,and nearly able to pull it back in with a dive, but the flick he puts in eventually reaches the rope"

"fullish length, driven back to the bowler"
"slower ball, way outside off, driven to point"

It's good bowling from Nabi, who gets it to straighten from just outside off, but Stirling has put in a good stride to play this. Wants to work it away on the on side, and we can see the leg stump here. It'll be a shame if this stays umpire's call, especially as even the height was substantial. Impact is outside, though. So Ireland will retain their preview, and Stirling will stay in"
