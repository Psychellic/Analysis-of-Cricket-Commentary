"gone, Bangladesh have lost their second! Liton swept this to the left of short fine leg and called for a single before realising the ball was too close to the fielder and sending his partner back.

"back of a length, turning towards leg stump, and that's another run-out! What is happening here! Tucks this to short fine leg and again the non-striker, Liton, goes haring out of his crease. Why!

Bangladesh are committing suicide here"

"what a catch that is, Samiullah Shenwari! Full now, angling into off stump from wide of the crease, and Shakib drives it cleanly, flat, inside-out, and would have got four runs for it another day. Today, however, Shenwari flies to his right at extra-cover and is parallel to the ground as he plucks this catch one-handed. Outstanding"

He was won it for Afghanistan. <strong>They whitewash Bangladesh 3-0!</strong> Another googly, but the length is shorter and outside off, hoicked away hard and flat to long-on. Will it go over the boundary? Nope. Shafiqullah leaps to his left and attempts to catch the ball. He can't catch it but manages to swat it into the field of play even as the ball swerves away from his reach. Then the ball somehow finds its way to wicketkeeper Shahzad, who breaks the bails, to run out Mahmudullah on the third. The third umpire is called in to see if Shafiqullah had stepped beyond the boundary when he flicked the ball back into the field of play. It is a matter of an inch, but he had not. And if Bangladesh had pilfered the third run, it would have been a tie. Shahzad does the <i>nagin</i> dance now. Go for it, champ. Rashid takes flight in joy. Celebrations in full swing in the Afghanistan camp. Madcap finish in Dehradun"
