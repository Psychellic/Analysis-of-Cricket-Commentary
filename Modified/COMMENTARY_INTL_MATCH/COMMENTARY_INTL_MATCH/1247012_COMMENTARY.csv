"<b>gone first ball!</b> What a start. Hits the good length right away and in the channel moving away, Imam could have left it alone but dragged bat away from body to poke at it, thick outside edge goes straight to the keeper. Shaheen makes the star pose made famous by the other Afridi and is mobbed by team-mates."
"and this one has caught him on the crease and rapped him on the pads. Shaheen belts out an appeal but maybe that was going down leg. Length ball swinging into him, rolls off the pad into midwicket"
"another one that bends back in viciously. Kamran driving on the up gets an inside edge that thuds into pad. Without that edge, plumb in front. Without the pad coming in the way, stumps shattered. Shaheen's had quite a start"
"length ball, tapped back down the pitch to the bowler"
"and now he makes one hold it's line, bowled in the channel, on a length. Kamran shoulders arms for a well judged leave"
"fuller on off, goes for the big off-drive but mis-times it to cover"
"extravagant movement away from the right hander. Good length on the stumps and moves away a lot, and Malik is drawn into feeling for it. Doesn't get bat on ball"
"fuller on the stumps, gets behind it to defend solidly."
"a more confident shot now, fuller outside off, and driven crisply, but straight to cover"
"and he finds the gap that time. Fuller again on off, comes on the front foot and cracks this through cover"
"yorker gone wrong, ends up as a half-volley on the pads and Malik says thank you while clipping it beautifully through midwicket"
"better length now, hits the good spot on leg stump and gets it to move away a bit. Malik slightly squared up as he pushes at this, goes to mid-off from the outside half. Not hit well which means they have enough time to pinch a single"
short ball that he wasn't ready for. He was looking to move across but this was back of a length and reared up. Malik drops gloves and lets the ball go through at chest high
"length on the stumps, jagging back, he manages to squirt this off thigh pad towards square leg"
"length ball again, but just outside leg. <b>that's been given a wide</b> but I thought there was a noise there, of the ball going from the thigh pad. Malik moved across to tickle it fine, no bat on it, but that's a bit of a harsh wide call"
"that's going to be a more clear wide. Bouncer mis-directed down leg, he ducks under easily"
"length ball on off, goes on the front foot to meet it, inside edged onto pad and it rolls to square leg"
"<b>edged but doesn't carry to the lone slip</b>. Afridi keeping the batsmen on their toes. Yorker on off, and Kamran attempted to drive it with bat away from body, got an edge that bounced between slip and keeper, but the slip did well to to dive to his left and stop it"
"good length on off, straight bat offered to mid-off"
"length on leg stump, worked off his pads to square leg"
"back of a length on the stumps, doesn't bounce as much, Kamran tries to flick it away but mistimes it and it rolls back down the pitch"
"<b>slashed for four</b>. Kamran had been kept quiet but climbs into this one. Short, wide outside off and he hacks it over point"
"<b>caught at deep midwicket</b>. He was caught in two minds there. Went for the flick, but appeared to not want to hit it so aerially. Length ball on the stumps, perhaps not enough room to pull off an uppish flick. Kamran hits it in that in-between fashion, not enough to carry over the deep fielder."
"full and wide outside off, driven crisply to mid-off"
"<b>caught behind first ball</b>. Second top-order man to go first ball, caught by the keeper. Mirza hits the perfect length and his angle from over the wicket means the ball's going across the right-hander. It's not there to drive but he goes for the big drive anyway, only managing an outside edge. Dying slightly on the keeper who does well to scoop it up"
"extravagant movement away from the batsman again, slanting across him and moving further away to be well outside off for an easy leave"
"full outside off, comes on the front foot to drive. Mid-off runs to his left to cut it off"
"full outside off again, Malik wants to flick it through midwicket but is a little late on it and ends up sending it more straight. Rolls past the bowler and mid-off collects again"
"length outside off, stays beside it and opens the face to steer to backward point"
"<b>lovely shot</b>. Minimal movement of the bat, but great timing. Gets a half volley on the pads and flicks it through midwicket"
now he moves across to another full ball and clips this to backward square leg. The man on the boundary has to run to his right a fair bit so they get two
"back of a length this time outside off, he's pushed on the back foot but punches softly to cover. They're alive to the quick single and sneak one in"
"too full on the pads, flicked away but straight to midwicket."
"<b>cracking shot</b>. back of a length going across him, he's quickly transferred weight and essays a superb punch off the back foot that bisects the offside field and races to the extra cover boundary"
"better length, shorter and rising up to above his waist on leg stump. He's moving across and is a bit tucked up, glances it to backward square leg"
<b>regally done</b>. Second ball for Bopara and he leans into an off-drive to a full ball and it just purrs to the boundary
"length ball going across him, waits for it and taps it to third man"
"digs it in short, gets it to chest height but he saw that coming and was in position to tap it down, wanted to get it to third man but not fine enough and point fields"
"length on off, starts with a fast one, 97.4 kph. tapped to cover"
"given more flight and fuller this time, carefully defended on the front foot on off stump"
"given some air again, but a bit too full, allows him to clip it to long-on"
"faster one again, but he takes a big stride forward to meet it almost on the full and punch to cover"
"length ball on off, comes on the front foot to push it"
"quicker one, googly I think but didn't turn much. 98.7 kph, slightly short, stays back and uses a horizontal bat to tap to midwicket's left"
"<b>shot</b>. Slightly overpitched on off, and Bopara comes on the front foot to drive it straight back past the bowler"
"length on the stumps, turned to deep square leg"
"angling into him from over the wicket, ends up too straight and is flicked off his pads to deep midwicket. They sprint hard to get two"
"<b>Wiese has made the breakthrough</b>. Back of a length outside off and Malik wanted to cut it fine, ends up edging it behind for another keeper's catch. Key wicket for Qalandars with Zalmi having looked like they were rebuilding nicely"
"length ball going across the left-hander, left alone"
"wide outside off, he throws his bat at it, but can't beat point"
"googly, he stays back and punches to long on"
"tossed up on the stumps, he comes on the front foot and woks it to deep midwicket"
"tossed up a bit fuller, comes on the front foot to drive to long-off"
"tossed up on leg stump, comes on the front foot again and works it to fine leg"
"strays on the pads to the right-hander this time, and it goes to short fine leg via a thickish inside edge"
"googly again, he's stayed well back to this, read it off the pitch and hurriedly jabbed it back"
"slower ball on leg stump, he waits for it and flicks to deep midwicket"
leading edge falls safely. Done in by the change of pace and was too early in trying to flick off his pads. Leading edge plops up towards cover. No fielder there
punched to mid-off
"full toss on the pads, and is imperially flicked away to deep square leg's left. Wasn't too far from the fielder but hit so well that he couldn't stop it"

"length on the stumps going across him, stays legside and steers to third man"

"goes for yorker again targeting the legs, slower ball at 123 kph that Rutherford chips off balance toward long-on for a very simple catch by Agha Salman running in 15 yards from the rope before stumbling forward on his knees to complete the take."

"Afridi's day continues to get better! Back of the hand slower ball lands on a length on fifth stump, miscues this high toward mid-off where Afridi charges forward and puts in a superb athletic dive forward to claim this catch inches from the ground. It kind of bobbled off his left hand into the right hand. Looked peculiar but the ball didn't look like it hit the ground. <strong>The third umpire decides differently though! Declares it not out.</strong> It was definitely a strange sequence of the ball clanging off both of Afridi's hands, but it did not appear to hit the grass at any stage."
<strong>missed runout! Afridi again! </strong>Full and wide yorker carved to mid-off. Afridi has a shy at the non-striker's stumps with Wahab six yards short. He decided to fire a bullet at the base of the stumps when a simple relay to Daniyal would have had Wahab clearly out and the throw goes wide.

"<b>slugged over midwicket</b>. takes toll of the bad ball. Too short, sat up for him, he rocks back and unleashes on the ball baseball style, sends it powerfully over midwicket"
"and he's got that through the in-field. Full on off, he makes a wee bit of room to punch the off-drive, beats mid-off and there's no one else back there, so he collects a boundary"
"fuller, comes on the front foot to defend"
"<b>lofted straight to long-on</b>. Sohail Akhtar will be unhappy with himself for taking a risk when one wasn't warranted. Skipped down the track and got to the pitch of the ball, but perhaps too close to it still. Went for the big golf swing to send it over cow corner but got too underneath it and didn't get the distance. Easy catch for the fielder"

"fuller, straying on the pads, uses wrists to flick it, but can't beat midwicket"
"that's the one that turned away from the right-hander. He was completely beaten, pushing forward in defence and it flies off the outside edge. Just past slip's right. Good work by Imran at the boundary, chasing after it and flicking it back in before it goes over the ropes"

"length ball, comes on the front foot to push into the offside"

"slower bouncer that doesn't bounce, he had to wait for it and ends up pulling it from thigh height towards fine leg"

"tailing into him on a full length, but he comes nicely forward to pat it to long-on"
bad line and punished. Length sliding down leg and all he has to do is move slightly inside the line and tickle it fine. Gets bat on it and it's four
"length on the stumps, goes back and taps it to midwicket. They set off for a risky looking quick single. Hafeez makes it but a direct hit would have had him out"

They were already walking back to their marks immediately after calling for the review. Called for it simply as a byproduct of having an extra one to burn."
"full on the stumps, jammed out."

"<strong>reverse swing finally rips out middle stump at 136 kph!</strong> Lands this one on a good length to encourage him to swing across the line instead of trying to jam it out in defense, Samit has a big ole heave-ho and the movement is too much to handle. Nips back and clatters the furniture. That was on the cards in his previous over."
"fullish length ball nips in again toward middle and leg and traps Wiese on the crease, <strong>big lbw shout denied! And they go for the review again. No jokes on this DRS signal. </strong> Live it looked like a 50/50 call. Could be umpire's call as it hit just above the knee roll on the crease. <b>And it's better than that!
