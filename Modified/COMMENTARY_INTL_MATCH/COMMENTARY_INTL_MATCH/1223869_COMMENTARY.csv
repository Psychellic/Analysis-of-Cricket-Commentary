good length and a hint of curve into the corridor. Shaw on his toes to get behind the line of this and defend with soft hands
"<b>inside edge and bowled!</b> There are two problems Shaw is contending with recently - jabbing away from the body and the ball that comes in. This is a combination of both. It's an inswinger from a good length, just a touch wide of the corridor. He's looking to drive on the rise and it's for the initial line. Gap between bat and front leg and half a stride. Not a great looking shot and it'll feel like a long walk back for him. For Starc - just another day with the pink ball. Fantastic start"
"good length, bit of shape in at middle stump. Solidly defended down the pitch"
"<b>just short of first slip!</b> Starc's inswinger - even the lack of it - is already playing on their minds. Pujara pushes at this length ball going across him. Caught inside the line. He always plays with soft hands though, and that probably saves him here"

"<b>lobs off the bat</b> but lands safely in front of gully. Short of a length this one, rising up as he looks to defend off his toes. It catches the shoulder of the bat"
"full and just outside off, springs onto the front foot and jabs it through the covers for his first run"
"a little unsure, Pujara. Short of a length and pitching on off stump. Watches it carefully, bat ready for the one that comes in. It goes away and he doesn't follow with his hands"

"good length and angling into off stump. Leans in and and loses his grip on the bat a touch, but gets the weight through this cover drive. It's dribbling into the cover boundary when Wade, running to his left from mid-off, lunges to scoop it back into play"
"<b>past the outside edge.</b> Still tentative, is Pujara. Short of a length and into the corridor. Hangs his bat inside the line of this and it straightens just a touch to beat him"

"<b>nearly pats it straight to short leg.</b> Travis Head with a hurried stretch to his right, one-handed. Can't get down quickly enough. It certainly didn't die on him, but he was a little late on that. Short ball at the ribs, Mayank off his toes and closing the face on this"

"bowled him, what a delivery. Agarwal a little late getting forward, his front foot lands on its heel as this ball from the fuller side of a good length nips in from just outside off.

"wow. Length ball, straightens in the fourth-stump channel and climbs steeply, towards the shoulder of Pujara's bat. Does very well to keep his bat close to his body and let himself get beaten. It's been a feature of his innings so far, not letting his hands get drawn to the movement"

"steps out and there's a <strong>huge appeal</strong> after the ball lobs off the pad to the fielder at leg gully. Not given, and Australia have reviewed. They did so especially because Pujara seemed to start walking before stopping in his tracks, and you can see why. Lyon's made the big breakthrough here. His changes of pace today have been excellent. Just a bit quicker, and Pujara can't get anywhere near the pitch of it to kick it away. Has to try and defend hurriedly, and there's extra bounce, and he gets a thick edge into pad, which lobs up to that man at leg gully. Huge breakthrough just when Pujara seemed set to turn the momentum around"

Smart bowling from Starc, slants out a full, wide tempter, and Saha throws his hands at it, looking to drive through the covers. All he manages is an edge through to Paine.

"<b>Kohli lunges low to his right and holds on at midwicket!</b> We saw Lyon extracting bounce from this pitch, and Ashwin has done that with this ball too, albeit it's a short one turning into leg stump. It's there for the pull, but pulling in front of square is hard when there's bounce. Green looks to go over midwicket, it hits the high part of his bat and floats out to Kohli's right. He tracks it and times the leap to his right perfectly. These can be hard if you go early. Kohli goes with both hands and completes the landing perfectly before he takes a bow. Not a bad first innings from Green at all, certainly looked comfortable at the crease, but he doesn't do it long enough"

"big appeal for lbw as Umesh gets one to keep low, and it's given. I don't think there's much doubt in it, unless it's sliding down leg. Labuschagne thinks long and hard before reviewing, and then he does. Back of a length, and Labuschagne is up on his toes but the ball stays down at knee height and skims below his bat to hit his pad, on the knee roll. No bat. Okay, that's plumb. Struck in front of off stump, and from there it's not going to miss the stumps. Hitting middle and off, says ball-tracking."

Slices it to gully, where Green seems to have taken a clean catch low to his left, but they're checking anyway. Soft signal is out. He caught it a few inches above the turf, but the issue is whether it slipped momentarily from his grasp on his way down. There seems to be a bit of a juggle, but it's hard to tell, given he's landing in an area of shadow, so it stays with the soft signal"

"full, slanting away from off, left alone"
"length ball on the pads, worked away through backward square leg"

"back of a length, angling down leg. Looks to work it away but all he gets on the ball is thigh pad. Four runs either way, though"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"overpitched outside off, gets forward and drives with an open face to the right of backward point"

"bouncer, angles well down the leg side. Wade ducks without too much discomfort"
"short, at the hip, gets across and gets closed-off again. Can't get his bat around his body in time to flick it off his hip, so just steps across and leaves it instead"

"a touch shorter, goes back to work it to backward square leg"

"length ball skidding on towards off stump, goes back to punch it back to the bowler"
"flighted ball on middle and leg, bat has to come down at an angle to defend in front of his pad"
skips out but comes too early. Ashwin shortens his length a little and he stretches out to defend into the off side

"tossed up invitingly outside off, left alone. This went with the angle"
"tossed up fuller outside off, presses forward and blocks to cover point"

"tossed up just outside off, dips on Burns a bit, forces him to clip to midwicket rather than straighter as he'd hoped"
"back of a length, tucked off the hip to long leg"

"length ball on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"angles into the pads now, clipped to long leg"
"shortish, rising ball on off stump. Hits the shoulder of his bat as he looks to defend, squeezes it away between gully and backward point"

"full, angling into leg stump, clipped to short leg"
"oh well, India will take that. Bizarre dismissal. Down the track and Ashwin spots him coming and fires it into his feet. Clips into the on side, straight into Shaw's right leg at short leg, and the ball rolls quickly to Saha with Wade well out of his crease. He picks up quickly to his right and gets a backhand flick between his legs without looking. A direct hit with Wade slipping and caught well outside the crease"
"<b>Shaw's lost the ball as he takes an evasive stance at short leg.</b> Marnus down the pitch, beaten in flight looing to hack it into the leg side. Not sure if there was an inside edge on that. Lobbed to Shaw's left and he was looking behind initially. Couldn't spot it"

good length and turning down leg. Gets on the back foot and dabs to fine leg
"short of a length and turning into the corridor, deep in the crease to chop to point"
"<b>taken at mid-on.</b> Ashwin still on the mark like he was in the first innings. Beautifully dipping length ball just outside off, slowing it down because Labuschagne has looked impatient. Steps out and looks to cart it over midwicket. It drops on him and then gets big. He can only sky it"
"tossed up at middle stump, leans in and defends to short leg"
"good length on leg stump, shuffles and clips to deep square"
"<b>slashed past point.</b> Good length and sliding on wide outside off. Half a stride out, reaches for it with his hands and drives it into the ground"

<b>beaten.</b> Short of a length and just outside off. Burns looks to roll his hands over that and steer it behind point. Gets too big on him
"short at middle stump, on his toes to defend into the leg side"
"<b>tipped over by fine leg! A win for Australia, a fifty for Burns.</b> Short ball climbing up at leg stump, shifts his weight back and across and hooks aerially. The fielder at fine leg lunges backwards and to his right, one-handed. Gets his hand on it but can't keep his balance"
