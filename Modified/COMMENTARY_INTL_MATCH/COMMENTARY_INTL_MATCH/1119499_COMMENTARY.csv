"full outside off to start, no swing, driven hard to mid-off. Not great timing."
"creamed. Swing for Shami, overpitched and wide outside off. Finch strides forward and nails his square drive through point."
"full delivery outside off, seaming back in, left alone"
"there are signs <strong>already of low bounce</strong>. Short and wide outside off, Finch cuts, his under-edge goes towards Dhoni who can't stop the ball cleanly.  Bounced awkwardly in front of him too."
"tight line, around middle and leg, defended into the leg side"
"short and wide, a touch of width, chopped into the cover region. Not going to be easy to execute cross-batted strokes with variable bounce"
"nice start from Umesh, full and wide outside off, plenty of away shape. 133 kph, lands well short of Dhoni. Not good signs these"
"carries at ankle height this time. Full and wide outside off, left alone. Just a hint of away shape"
races away down to fine leg. Nothing wrong with this outfield. On the pads. and Finch flicks away down to fine leg. Shami races to his right to save two. Good running too
"a thick outside edge down to third man. Full outside off, Finch plays the line. Umesh gets some away movement"
"ooh, sloppy from Kohli. Good length outside off, punched towards Kohli at cover who gets to his left but fumbles, allowing a run"
"full and straight, skewed to midwicket with a closed bat face"
"beautiful. Just a straight bat and put away. That is the right length for the overhead conditions but the wrong length for this pitch. Full outside off, checking if there is swing. Hardly any, and Warner can drive through mid-off"
"on the pads this time, adjusts his length, but the line isn't great. Clipped through square leg."
"fullish length around middle, <strong>the perfect length</strong>, Warner doesn't know whether to come forward or go back. A thick inside edge hits his pad"
"fullish outside off, defended into the cover region"
"full on off, Warner runs at the bowler and clips him away to mid-on. Trying to put Shami off his length."
"a thick outside edge and no catching up with that on this outfield. Full and wide, Warner plays the line, but some angle takes the ball away, taking the edge. Wide of gully and too fine for a square third man."
"ooh, that's tripe. Short and wide, swinging away. Finch wants to hammer through the line, without feet movement, chopped back up the pitch"
"that's a lot, lot better. Just timed away. Short and wide, Finch watches the ball onto his bat, transfers his weight into the ball and punches his push through extra cover"
"adjusts his line straightaway. Straighter and fullish, worked into the leg side"
"poor delivery. India's new ball bowlers looking very rusty. A slower delivery on the pads, flicked through square leg for four. Focussed on timing, not power."
"drifts down leg this time, wide. 137 kph, Umesh struggling. Bowling two lengths and two lines"
"good length on middle and leg, nudged to square leg"
"another awful delivery. Short and very wide, Finch can't connect cleanly with his cut, the ball trickles towards mid-off"
"full outside off, Finch drives hard into the ground towards cover"
"full and straight, pushed to mid-on. Finch wants one, but quick singles are not easy here because of the pace of the outfield."
"excellent from Shami, much much better. Fuller than a good length is the perfect length to most batsmen, Finch in particular who likes to stay back. Defended back"
"width. Not a lot, which means Finch can only go at it with an angled bat (45 degrees as opposed to the routine 90), and finds a short point"
"terrific over so far. On a length outside off, forcing Finch to defend"
"maiden for Shami. India's best over so far. Full outside off, Finch strides forward and drives to mid-off. Found his length there, helped by a good field from Kohli/Dhoni"
"141 kph, Umesh is too full and as soon as it is, Warner goes over the infield. Full outside off, Warner gets under the length and lifts the ball comfortably over mid-off. Not great timing but enough"
"drags his length back right away. That's where he should have been off the first ball. Full on off, defended towards cover"
"a slower ball, drifts down leg, wayward line again, 118 kph, off the pad down to fine leg"
"good from Umesh. On a length around off, blocked back. Keep it there for the rest of the over, make Finch make the play"
"oh no, short and wide at 127 kph, Finch doesn't find his timing but finds cover with a slap"
"drifts down leg for a wide, 130 kph"
"hurries Finch for pace. A nice short ball down leg, Finch is late on his pull, gloves it down to fine leg"
"that raced away. 141 kph, full delivery on off, Finch wants to go over mid-off but the ball skews off the inside half through square leg."
"Australia have respected that length, why move from there? Good length outside off, sliced towards backward point where Pandey dives to his left"
"poor delivery. Short on middle and leg, pulled away merrily through square leg. Too easy"
"146 kph, full around off, driven away towards Kohli at cover. India chasing the game already"
"139 kph, digs this in short on off, Warner think of pulling but bails out late."
"a yorker to finish, 142 kph, pushed back to the bowler."
"late movement. Full outside off, Finch goes chasing but luckily for him, doesn't catch up with it. Beaten on the edge"
"full outside off, defended into the cover region"
"a slower ball around off, defended into the cover region. Dug that in, sat up"
"good length around off, pushed away towards mid-on"
"guided down to the third man boundary. A slower ball outside off, Finch opens his bat face and guides the ball down to the third man boundary. Nicely played"
"full and straight, worked away to midwicket"
"a slower ball around off, driven to Kohli at cover who has an unnecessary throw at the bowler's end. Softening the ball"
"good length, around middle and off, pushed to Kohli again. No run there"
"a slower ball outside off, carved away to extra cover"
"short on middle and leg, a half pull to square leg. Well played, kept it down"
"a slower delivery on middle and leg, clipped to square leg"
"good length outside off, punched to cover from the crease."
"that was poor. Short and wide from Umesh, chopped away to point. Pandey runs to his left and lets it go, Pandya runs to his right and lets it go. The ball goes through for four."
"in the gap this time, short and wide outside off, powered through cover for four. Just a slap"
"on the pads, worked away to square leg this time"
"shortish outside off, pushed to mid-off for a quick single. Makes it easily"
"141 kph, on a length on middle and leg, worked to midwicket"

"flat and wide to start, pushed to cover from the crease"
"quick outside off, watchfully defended into the cover region"
"short outside off, driven towards cover. No turn."
"runs at Axar this time, but the length is terrific, worked to midwicket from the crease"

"short on middle and off, driven back to the bowler from the crease"
"wow, that was waaay down leg, wide. Dhoni saved four by moving quickly"
"short and wide outside off, nailed away to the sweeper cover"
"beautifully played. A shortish delivery outside off, not very pacey, Finch stands back and drills a drive through cover. No chance for the sweeper cover running around"
"a shortish delivery on the pads, nudged to midwicket"
"superbly hit, but mid-off does well. Good length outside off, pushed through cover, Umesh runs around to his right"
"133 kph, good length outside off, defended"
"smashed through cover again, a slower delivery. The cover fielder gets around this time"
"full outside off, stabbed into the cover region for one. Nice timing"
"quick outside off, darted in, driven to long-off"

"drifts on the pads again, Warner misses some runs, off the pad to short fine leg"
"full and straight, the ball moving in, driven back to the bowler"

"short and wide outside off, slashed to the deep point fielder"
"good length around off, outside-edged towards point"
"good length delivery outside off, nicely hit through point for one. Sweeper cover runs around"
"good length outside off, punched away to the sweeper cover for one"
"flat and straight again, nudged to midwicket"
"short outside off, defended watchfully. Tight lines these from Axar"
"the big reverse sweep. Flat on middle, Warner switches his stance, not his hands, finds third man"
"picks the length early and smashed. Short on middle, Warner picks the length early and nails his pull over midwicket. Six"
"that's Warner's fifty. Short and wide from Axar, Warner sits back and crashes a cut through point. Too easy"

"short outside off, pushed away to cover"
"lots of flight on that outside off, driven to long-off"
"good end, quick on leg, pushed back to the bowler and that will be drinks"
"overpitched on off stump, and that's a good stop from Umesh at long-off, sprinting hard and sliding to his left after Warner shows it the full face and sends it racing towards the boundary. Is it a clean save, or has his foot touched the rope? Replays indicate it's the latter. Still, a good effort from the fast bowler"
"back of a length, angling across towards off stump, chopped down towards short cover"
"full, a fair bit outside off stump this time. Warner eases it away towards deep point after shuffling across"
"full, a lot of width, Finch throws his hands at it and opens his bat face slightly to get the placement he desires, a fair distance to the left of Axar at sweeper cover"
"length ball outside off stump, presses forward to drive towards cover. Was in the air for a moment, but he was more or less in control of his shot"
"goes wide of the crease to angle a length ball towards off stump. Finch shows the full face and pushes it down the ground, past the diving bowler, and mid-off moves right to stop it"
"flat, angling down leg. Finch can't get bat on it as he tries to glance"
"back of a length, angling into the pads, tucked away to the left of short fine leg"
"tossed up on leg stump, and Warner gets down low, front leg planted just next to the line, to slog-sweep hard and flat over midwicket"
"quicker ball on middle and off, defended without too much footwork back to the bowler"
"goes back to a length ball that's only inches outside off stump and plays a controlled cut through cover point. Most batsmen would have played that off the front foot, into the covers"
"slows it down and gets some turn, rips in and hits the pad as he comes half-forward to defend. Clearly headed down leg, so not much of an appeal"
"flat, back of a length, goes back and works it off his pads through square leg"
"back of a length, turning in towards middle and off, defended to midwicket"
"length ball, goes on the back foot again, Axar gives him no room and he clips towards midwicket"

"down the track now, gets to the pitch of a slightly tossed-up off-stump ball and whips to long-on"
"length ball angled in towards off stump, slightly lower arm on this. Defended towards point"
"flat, and he goes back, plays the trajectory rather than the actual length, which isn't short enough to pull. Inside-edges it and drags it a short distance into the leg side. Could easily have played on there"
"down the track and that's six more. Not much Chahal can do about this. He looked to bowl it a little shorter, at his body, and not give him swinging room, and he just clears his front leg and swats it away over square midwicket"
"full on off stump, driven to long-off"
"length ball pitching on middle and turning away, makes room and slaps it away to sweeper cover, past Kohli, who moves to his left from extra-cover but doesn't get down in time to stop it"

"down the track to one bowled slightly slower on off stump. Doesn't get to the pitch, punches it back to the bowler"
"fired in flat, angling slightly down leg. Nowhere near short enough to pull - he was looking to turn it around the corner with a horizontal-ish bat - and he's hit on the pad. Not the loudest lbw appeal, he knew it was heading down leg"
"flat again, on the stumps, clipped down the ground to long-on"
"flat length ball on middle stump, clipped to midwicket"
"angled in with a lower arm, pitches just back of a length. Goes back to punch to short cover"
"back of a length outside off, chopped down towards backward point"
"Finch misses, Dhoni misses, and that runs away for four byes. Looked to clear his front leg and launch that over mid-on, and the ball turned less than he expected. Went between bat and pad, and his back leg dragged itself out of the crease. The lack of turn has beaten Dhoni too - a <b>missed stumping</b>."
"length ball on off stump, driven to short cover"
"flat length ball on middle stump, blocked back towards the bowler"
"on the pads, clipped quietly towards backward square leg"
"short, wide, slapped to deep point"
flat length ball on leg stump - he saw Warner setting up to make himself room. Punched into the covers
now he expects Warner to make that premeditated movement and fires it down the leg side. Warner stays where he is and it's called wide
"fired in flat again. Warner moves away from the stumps first, and then moves across to try and play a half-forward sweep. Misses. is hit on the pad, but it's going down leg"
"flat length ball on middle stump, clipped towards midwicket"
"a touch shorter outside off, chopped into the covers"
""

"length ball, closer to off stump, punched down the ground to long-off"
"tossed up on the pads, lands very full. Clipped to short fine leg"
"sees Finch looking to make room and slows it up a lot, floats it up gently. Doesn't have the pace to go over cover, so drags a sweep out to deep square leg instead, brings up fifty"
"flat, back of a length on leg stump, cramps Finch for room and he punches to short extra"
"again Finch makes a premeditated move away from leg stump. Slows it up gently and follows him outside leg. Not full enough for the drive so he looks to defend, and the ball turns past his outside edge and <b>somehow misses leg stump</b>."
"flat, fired down leg. Looks to clip it round the corner, misses. Big appeal from Dhoni - maybe a bit of pad on the way through"
"flat and full on off stump, clipped through square leg"
"full on off stump, and Finch finally executes a shot he's been trying to play for a while. Unlike Chahal, Axar gives him some pace to work with, and he makes just a bit of room to loft that inside-out over cover"
"flat, back of a length, angling into middle stump. Makes a bit of room and punches it past the diving bowler to long-off"
"again, looks to cramp Warner by firing it flat onto his pads. Makes room and punches to long-off"
"flat, angling down leg, and it's a touch short too. Finch just needs a little bit of bat on this, and he manages it, just helps it away down to the fine leg boundary"
tossed up outside off. Stretches out and plays a wristy flick-sweep through backward square leg
"floats this down the leg side, and that's not a great ball with fine leg up. Sweeps it in the air, to the left of that fielder, and picks up four more"

"tossed up outside off. Gets on the front foot and clips to short fine leg, with the turn"
"back of a length, turning in towards off and middle. Chopped away into the cover-point region"

"length ball outside off, opens his bat face and steers to backward point"
"back of a length, angling in towards off stump, pushes gently into the covers and calls his partner through for a single"
"back of a length, a bit of inward nip too as Finch walks across, looking to work it into the leg side. Misses, hit on the pad, but it's probably a touch high. Not much of an appeal as it runs away into the square-leg region for a leg bye"
"back of a length close to off stump, punched away to the right of Rahane at deep point. Bit of a misfield, the result of the batsmen putting pressure on him by pushing for two"
"length ball close to off stump, punched down the ground to long-off"

"length ball on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"tossed up higher on off stump, driven hard but straight back to the bowler"

"back of a length, angling into off stump, flat-batted down to long-off for one"

"shortish outside off, slapped straight to backward point."

"again flat and short, slapped to the left of sweeper cover"
"shortish, wide of off, slapped to point"

"flat length ball wide of off, and he goes on the back foot - most batsmen would have gone forward to that - and flat-bats it with immense power to beat sweeper cover diving futilely to his left"
"quicker ball, short and well wide of off stump. Jumps across to cut but can't connect"

"flat, shortish, angling into leg stump, and Jadhav has broken the partnership! The low release means there isn't too much bounce. Clears his front leg and looks to heave it over wide long-on, but it skids on and he hits it straighter than he'd like, and doesn't get the power he'd like, ends up hitting it straight to long-on"

"looks to clobber it, such bad timing that mid-on takes a sitter. A slower ball outside off, Finch looks to drag the ball from well outside off, but it's right off the toe end, and straight to mid-on. So wide that it may have been a wide had Finch let that go"

"a short slow delivery outside off, Head misses a cut, another dot. He has effectively scored 17 runs off close to five overs, definitely not good enough"
"just short of third man. Full and wide outside off, Head looks to go over cover but can't make good enough contact. A thick outside edge lands in front of the fielder"
"just over midwicket. Full on leg, so badly timed that Kohli has enough time to jog around from long-on and cut it off. A fantastic dive from Kohli, saves two more. Placed well by Handscomb"
"a full slower delivery on middle, driven to long-on"
"a slog that trickles to midwicket. All the momentum of this innings has been sucked out. A short, slow ball outside off, Head badly times this to midwicket. He has to stay till the end and make up"
"one of the shots of the day. Superb. Full outside off, the ball seaming back in. Handscomb lifts a straight drive past the bowler, mid-off is wide. Sensational ball-striking"

"and bowled him off the next ball. Full and straight, seaming back in, Handscomb misses a big slog and the ball uproots off stump. Yikes. Just enough reverse swing for Shami. That's a fine cameo by a fine, young batsman"
"two dots to finish. Good comeback from Umesh. Shortish on off, Wade can't contact and is struck on the pad."
"short outside off, smashed down to long-on for a run"
"a slower ball down leg, clipped down to deep fine leg for a couple. Good running."
"terrific yorker on off, all Wade can do is chip the ball to cover and take the available single"
"a slower length delivery outside off, the legcutter, sits up for Stoinis to whack over midwicket. Short boundaries, big hit, six."
"lovely batting from Stoinis. Full and straight from Shami, Stoinis flicks away over square leg with the angle of swing. A momentum-stealing over"
"shortish and wide, sliced to point for a run. Good finish that from Stoinis"
"back of a length, fourth-stump line. Looks for that dab to third man which he loves so much, but Smith moves quickly to his left from backward point and dives to deny him a single"
"length ball on off stump, defended into the covers"
"fullish, angling into middle stump. Lets it reach right under his eyes and tucks it away to the right of fine leg"
"back of a length on off stump, angling in. Defended to midwicket"
"width, and a touch short too. Rahane slaps it away with immense power, and it flies away to the right of the diving Head at cover point"
"full on off stump, clipped to mid-on"
"back of a length, straightens on a fourth-stump line. Lets it come on and runs it down to third man"
"back of a length, close to off stump, gets back and across to defend into the covers"
"ooh, good ball, and well played in the end. A lovely length and some late outswing, and close enough to off stump to force Rahane to play. He defends very close to his body, with soft hands, and the edge dies safely and goes into the gap between slip and gully"
"another good length ball that leaves Rahane, this time he adjusts for it and defends towards gully with an open face"
"fullish on off stump, clipped to mid-on"
"shortish, doesn't quite bounce as much as he expects. He's into the pull early, can't really adjust. The ball hits him on the thigh pad and rolls into the leg side"
"full on middle stump, and Rahane puts it away easily, clipping it away through backward square leg, a long way from the man at fine leg"
"length ball on off stump, stops on Rahane slightly. Adjusts and blocks to mid-on with a straight bat"
"back of a length close to off stump, lets it come on and dabs to third man"
"length ball, a touch too straight, angling into middle and leg, clipped to the right of square leg and this time the man at fine leg is stationed squarer, more towards long leg, so Rohit only gets two runs for his shot"
"back of a length on off stump, defended to short extra-cover"
"back of a length, a hint of inward movement towards off stump. Lets it come on and pushes to the right of mid-on with a straight bat"
"short, wide, gets on his toes and flays it away to the right of cover point"
"back of a length, much closer to off stump this time. Lets it come on and defends with soft hands towards backward point"
"nice length, and he gets a bit of outswing too. Started it a bit wider to entice Rohit into a drive away from his body, but he just ignores it"
"shortish, some width again. Reaches out and stabs it to third man"
back of a length close to off stump. Looks for the dabbed single to third man but the ball stops on him and hits the inside edge and ricochets towards his feet
"length ball, fifth-stump line, a tiny bit of shape away. Rahane leaves it alone"
"back of a length, angling into middle stump. Lets it come on and tucks it towards square leg"
"short ball, sits up at just around stomach height outside off stump, and you don't bowl those to Rohit Sharma. Has all the time in the world to lean back and swivel through his hips to pull it over midwicket"
back of a length close to off stump. Lets it come on and drops it into the point region with soft hands and calls Rahane through for a quick single
"shortish, angling into Rahane's front hip. Can't put bat to ball as he tries to tuck it fine, ends up hitting his body and rolling towards the man at square leg"
"shortish, not too much width. Gets on his toes to punch to cover point"
"back of a length close to off stump, opens his bat face to guide it down to third man"
"fullish, fairly wide of off. Gets a nice stride towards the ball and opens his bat face to adjust for the away movement, steers that to the left of backward point and Smith makes another diving stop"
"back of a length on off stump, defends it back to the bowler"
"oh man. That ball sneaks past the thigh pad as Rahane attempts a little glance towards fine leg, and it just misses <i>off stump</i>. That's how far across the stumps he moved in premeditation"
"bang! He can play these sorts of shots when he's in the mood, and the ball was right there for it. So much width, just back of a length, and he takes a step forward and slaps it up and over cover point"
"fuller now, confident stride forward to defend towards cover point"
"fullish outside off, and again Rahane flows forward, this time for a crisp drive to mid-off"
"ooh, risky shot. It's back of a length, angling into middle stump or thereabouts, and he gets a premeditated stride in, forward and across, looking for a scoop over short fine leg. Misses, and it hits his thigh pad. Too short for an lbw, so the appeal isn't particularly confident"
"oh man, he's really timing it today. It's shortish, and it's on a fourth-stump line. A pretty decent ball, but he just stays leg-side of it, deliberately, opens his bat face, and sends it racing away to the right of third man"
"back of a length on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended towards backward point. He was looking for one but it went to the fielder too quickly for that"
"ooh. Maybe a bit of inward nip. Back of a length, and he was looking to work that from just outside off stump through square leg. The ball beats his inside edge and rolls towards third man off his back thigh"
"length ball, fourth-stump line, defended to short extra-cover"
"very full outside off, in the blockhole, jabbed towards mid-off"
"length ball angling into off stump, clipped to midwicket"

"back of a length close to off stump, punched to mid-off"
"length ball angling in towards off stump, defended into the extra-cover region"
"back of a length, angling into off stump, defended into the on side"
"another short ball on off stump, another Rohit Sharma pull, another ball sails into the stands. Again, just that press forward, then he leans back and swats it away, just in front of square"
"back of a length, fifth-stump line, steered down to third man"
"back of a length outside off, and again Smith moves quickly to his left from backward point and denies Rahane that single to third man"
"now it's Rahane's turn to pull. Short ball just outside off stump, and he puts it away over straight midwicket. I think he was waiting for that length, and he pounced as soon as he spotted one slightly short"
"back of a length outside off, opens his bat face and dabs into the point region"
"and he starts with a short, wide, rubbish ball that Rahane cracks away through point with a flashing square-cut"
"width again, fuller this time. Strides forward and drives to cover point"
back of a length on off stump. Stops on Rahane slightly. Punched towards mid-on
"back of a length close to off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"back of a length, angling into off and middle, whipped away through square leg"

"fullish outside off, driven to deep point"
"back of a length, fourth-stump line, guided down to third man"
"shortish outside off, punched to deep point"
"on the fuller side of a good length, angling in towards off stump. Rohit shapes to drive, but the ball stops on him, and he checks his shot and defends towards mid-off. Looked like the cross-seam release"
"shortish, close to off stump. Again it stops a bit, and Rohit defends towards backward point"
"back of a length outside off, and Rahane punches crisply off the back foot. Once again, Smith dives from backward point to make a super stop, this time he goes to his right"
"length ball angling into off stump, clipped to midwicket"
"length ball on middle stump, clipped to deep square leg"
"back of a length on middle stump, tucked away to deep square leg"
"length ball close to off stump, shows the full face, looking for a push to long-on. Finch moves quickly to his left from midwicket to intercept"
"short ball outside off, stops on Rahane, and he waits and waits and waits some more before pulling to deep midwicket"
"tossed up full on middle and off, driven to long-off"
"goes back to a flat length ball on middle and off, defends to short extra"
"long-hop outside off, pulled to long-on. It didn't bounce as much as he expected - I think he was initially looking to pull that over midwicket"
"another short ball, this time Rahane goes deeper in his crease to pull. Hits it over midwicket and deep square leg moves to his left to stop it at the boundary"

"back of a length, turns in towards middle stump, goes back to whip to deep midwicket"

"short and wide, Rohit slaps it straight to cover point"
"quickish offbreak, a bit of turn and extra bounce towards leg stump. Defended towards midwicket, with the bottom hand coming off the handle"

"flighted ball on off stump, driven to long-on"
"quickish, back of a length, hurries through and doesn't give Rahane enough time for a proper punch, ends up defending into the covers"

"length ball close to off stump, lets it come on and dabs gently to the left of short third man"
"full outside off, chipped in the air, on the bounce, to the left of long-off"
"very full on middle and off, Rohit plays an inside-out jab and short extra-cover stops it with a dive"
"back of a length, turns in towards off stump. Rahane makes a bit of room and punches to long-off"
ooh. Not short enough to cut and it skids on straight to beat the outside edge

"goes back to a quick length ball on off stump, defends it back towards the bowler"
"dips onto a nice length on middle stump, stretches out and works it into the square leg region"
"flatter now, on middle and leg, flicked through square leg"
"googly - I'm not sure Rohit really picked this. Shaped for the drive to long-off, and then checked himself and defended back to the bowler, off the inside half of the bat"
"doesn't matter what this ball was, legbreak, googly, flipper or a new invention. Just sees a bit of flight outside off and he gets down on one knee, moving his front leg out of the way to give him some swinging room, and slog-sweeps high and hard over wide long-on"
"excellent follow-up. Flight and dip outside off, and Rohit, pressing forward to defend, is beaten by the legbreak"
"and another. Flighted ball on off stump, and Rohit brings up his fifty and the century opening stand with another monster slog-sweep over wide long-on"
"shortish, a bit of width, slapped to cover point"
"down the track comes Rahane this time, gets a bit too close to the pitch of a flat, middle-stumpish ball, and swipes it to deep midwicket, along the ground"
"length ball on off and middle, defended with the turn towards midwicket"
"back of a length, turns in towards middle and leg. Gets his legs out of the way and punches to long-on"
"manufactures a shorter length than it actually was by stepping deep in his crease, but can't punch this one past cover point"
"fuller now, clipped down to long-on"
"good length on middle and leg, nudged to Stoinis at midwicket"
"finds Finch at long-on and India lose their first. A good length delivery on leg, Rahane comes running down to hit Richardson over mid-off, but the ball skews off the inside half and goes straight to Finch. Did not want to hit that so wide."
"good length outside off, dabbed down to backward point. A wild cheer as Kohli comes on strike"
"a nice short delivery to greet him. A bouncer on leg, Kohli ducks"
"full and straight, the ball seaming in, defended"
"a deft dab down to third man to get off the mark, he likes that shot"
"overpitched on off, jammed back"
"fantastic batting. Stoinis labours after it, puts in a dive but can't haul it in. Short outside off, plays the late cut very very late and gets it past short third man"
"full on off, a thick leading edged goes towards cover"
driven nicely with the spin to long-on for a run
"full on the pads again, driven to long-on"
"<strong>dropped</strong>! It's a half-chance, but Australia need to take those. Short outside off, the ball turning in, Kohli stays in his crease and nervously pokes at it, off the toe end to Head's left in his follow-through. He gets there but drops the chance."
"full and straight, Kohli runs at the bowler and mis-times a drive to the sweeper cover"
"good length around off, nudged towards square leg"
"a very risky stroke, but he plays it quite well. Short outside off, Kohli chops it down to third man. Always the risk of chopping on too, like game 2 in Kolkata"
"nice line, good length around off, pushed to mid-on"
"good length outside off, punched nicely on the up to the deep fielder at cover"
"full and straight, defended back. Tidy over"

"shot! Fantastic execution from Rohit. Runs down, gets to the pitch, gets underneath and goes through with a clean swing, right over the bowler's head. Lovely stroke"
"full outside off, nudged to midwicket"
"that bottom hand again. Full and straight, Kohli steps out and whips the ball through midwicket, between midwicket and mid-on. Just that bottom-hand power"
"and again, this time, drives to a deep-ish mid-on for one"
"on a length and straight, nudged to deep midwicket for a run"
"shortish outside off, opens the bat face and guides it down to third man for a run."
"full on off and middle, driven to long-on"
"and Rohit is run-out! Steven Smith makes the run-out with a sensational dive. A short delivery outside off, Kohli guides the ball down to backward point, where Smith dives away to his left to stop the ball. He then has a throw at the batsman's end, where Rohit and Kohli are both vying to make the crease. Head is backing up at midwicket, picks up, and throws the ball back to the bowler, who takes off the bails. Unfortunate for Rohit, Kohli was run-out here when Rohit hit that double-hundred in 2013. That's how it goes"
"beaten on the outside edge is Pandya. Full and wide, drifts on to beat the outside edge."
"short on middle and leg, worked to midwicket"
"full and straight, driven to long-on"
"just wide of cover. In the air, but safe. Full and wide from Head, drills a drive wide of cover. His timing does the rest, fantastic timing"
nudged to long-on
"yikes, watch out those snoozing in the high stands. Flight on off, Pandya gets underneath the delivery and nails his slog sweep waaaaaaay over wide long-on. Massive"
"good length outside off, chopped back to the bowler, didn't time that"
"happens again. Kohli has done it again, it was always going to happen and I think Coulter-Nile was playing for that. Good length outside off, the ball seaming back in, Kohli tries to dab this down to third man, but it takes the inside edge and hits the off stump. That's another error from Kohli, and the worst thing is he has repeated the mistake from Kolkata. It is a nice shot to a ball that is slightly wide and when the ball isn't seaming in."
"good length on middle, the ball coming back in again, inside-edged into the body"
"good length outside off, dabbed down to third man"
"on the pads, whipped down to fine leg for one"

"bowled quicker and flatter on middle and leg, pushed back to the bowler"
"short and wide from Zampa, goes under the bat"
"flight outside off, driven to long-off. Stayed calm there did Pandya, didn't let his instinct take over"
"lovely whip past midwicket. Full and straight, Pandya clips the ball past the fielder. Cummins puts in a boundary-saving dive running around from deep square leg. Should have been three"
"full outside off, driven to mid-off. Staying slightly leg side of the ball, which is the right way to play the ball coming in"
"dabs this down to third man, an angled bat"
"full and straight, coming back in, whipped to deep backward square leg for a couple."
"good length on the pads, nudged to deep square leg for one. Most of these deliveries will go in this area"
"full and straight from Coulter-Nile, pushed back to the bowler with a straight bat. Nice over"
"short and straight, the batsman made the error of thinking that flipper was a bad ball, pulled to long-on"
"looks to go over cover this time, but the ball drifts on, takes the inside half and makes its way to long-on"
"fine stop from Richardson at third man. Short and wide, Jadhav cuts that into the gap. The fielder saves three"
"clears midwicket. It's just slightly short outside off, Pandya stays in his crease and nails his whipped jab over midwicket. How did he get so much power behind that?"
"and again. Zampa bowls this wider outside off, tempting Pandya, who says I have a wide repertoire and drills a hard drive over cover. Keeps going and clears the boundary easily"
"flat end, towards off, dabbed towards point"
"good length on the pads, nudged down to fine leg for a run"
"full outside off, defended towards cover"
"on the pads, 146 kph, seams back in. Pandya gets to the ball late, and is clattered on the thigh pad, just under the actual protection."
"good length outside off, carved towards backward point"
"full outside off, pushed away towards extra cover for one. Think he feels he is set"
"beauty. Full delivery outside off, the ball seams away or holds its line, beaten on the outside edge as Jadhav plays the line"
"full and wide outside off, Pandya leans into his drive for a run to the sweeper cover"
"good length outside off, tapped to backward point"
"131 kph, short on middle, sits up for Jadhav to merrily pull over midwicket for four. Easy as ... Poor ball"

"full outside off, Jadhav has a leaden-footed drive at that and gets one to midwicket"
"finely played. Good length outside off, a deft dab to third man. Pandya wants two and Jadhav doesn't. At least, it was a loud clear call"
"good length outside off, a dab down to third man for one"
"good length outside off, played to Smith at backward point"
"full around off, Jadhav comes down the pitch and shovels a flick to square leg for one"
"a short slow delivery outside off, Pandya tries to dab that down again but makes no connection. Cummins hurrying these two"
"drifts down leg this time. Bounces awkwardly in front of Wade, who half-stops it. Good from Jadhav to steal the bye"
"a thick under-edged past the keeper and into the boundary. Short and wide outside off, Jadhav is late on the ball but gets enough bat to beat the keeper. Finch runs around from third man but can't quite haul it in"
"full outside off, a thick outside edge towards Smith at point, a half-stop again, one run"
"full outside off, driven back to the bowler"
"shortish around off, Jadhav gets an under-edge on his pull towards square leg"
"good length outside off, a thick outside edge down to third man."
"comes down the pitch, looking to hit that straight but the ball skews off the inside edge into the pad"
"that will be four. 131 kph, short on off, hammered through square leg with a terrific pull, played that early and fine enough for four behind square."
"four more. Short and wide outside off, Jadhav nails his cut behind point for another boundary. Fantastic placement from Jadhav"
"full outside off, driven up to Warner at mid-off, good single from these two"
"full outside off, played down quietly towards point"
"fullish around off, the ball comes back in, defended back. Nice line"

"full outside off, defended back"
"full and straight, whipped away to deep square leg for one"
"good length outside off, skewed away off the outside half to deep point"
"lovely shot from Jadhav. Comes down to Stoinis, it's full and wide, and Jadhav goes through with the stroke. clean swing through the line, way over long-off. Superb hit from Jadhav"
"full outside off, defended back this time"
on the pads this time and Jadhav flicks him away through square leg for one.
"length ball angling in towards off stump, defended towards point and they sprint through for a quick single. That man Smith has dived in and flicked a direct hit at the keeper's end, but Pandya was well home by then"
"overpitched on leg stump, and Pandya just needs to place that. He does that nicely, flicks it away into the big gap to the left of long leg"
"slower ball outside off, and it beats Pandya, who opens his bat face and looks to guide it down to third man"
"back of a length close to off stump. Looks for the pushed single but extra-cover charges forward, towards the ball to deny him"
"back of a length outside off, dabbed to short third man - was maybe looking to beat him to his left"
"length ball on off stump, punched to short extra-cover"
"slowly tossed up on off stump, turning away. Jadhav is too early into his sweep and the ball hits his hip"
goes back to a length ball turning from leg to off. Defends into the off side
"back of a length on middle stump, pushed through flat. Clipped towards midwicket"
"flighty full-toss on off stump, driven straight to short extra-cover"
"he doesn't throw it up. It's flat and shortish outside off, and Jadhav slaps it to deep point"
"flat length ball on middle and leg, shows the full face to push down to long-on"
"ooh, not the right length. Back of a length, fourth-stump line. Bounces over his outside edge as he clears his front leg and tries to launch it over mid-on"
"back of a length, angling into the body, tucked off the hip to the left of fine leg"
shuffles across to off stump and Richardson responds with a full ball on middle. Clipped to deep square leg
"length ball on middle and off, driven to long-on"
"back of a length outside off, Jadhav shuffles forward even before the bowler releases, opens his bat face, and stabs to backward point. He's right on the edge of the circle, so they run a fairly comfortable single"
"fullish on off stump, and this time mid-off is right on the edge of the 30-yard circle, so they run a single despite Pandya driving straight to the man"
"miscued, and that's a massive wicket! That was not the right length for the big hit, Zampa dragged it fairly short and flat. Pitches on off stump, turns away further, and Pandya's attempted slog over mid-on skews off the outside half of the bat and settles in long-off's hands"
"shortish, close to off stump, goes back to chop it to the right of backward point and gets off the mark first ball"
"wide length ball, slapped to backward point"
"flatter, on off stump, gets on the front foot and dabs towards backward point"
"ooh, good ball. And they've gone to the third umpire for a stumping appeal! Goes back to a length ball and he's beaten trying to late-cut. A bit of extra bounce on that. He didn't move out of the crease, but momentarily moved his back foot forward - he dragged it rather than lift it, however, and he's pretty much safe"
"tossed up on off stump, gets down low to drag a slog-sweep along the ground to the left of deep square leg"
"sees Jadhav stepping out and bowls it short outside off. Hops to ride the bounce, and dabs towards backward point"
"down the track again, and this time he gets the length he wants. Just back of a length, and he plays a front-foot swipe into the gap between mid-on and midwicket"
"down the track again. This time he shortens his length and angles it into the body, cramping Jadhav for room. Drops it down into the pitch with soft hands, but no chance of a quick single"
"shuffles out of his crease again, and this time he gets the wide length ball, which he guides down to third man with an open bat face"
"shortish, angling into the body, and he tucks it off his hip into the square leg region. Loses his footing as he sets off for a single, and he stumbles onto the floor and loses his bat before finally managing to jog to the other end"
"length ball outside off, pushed towards extra-cover"
"goes back to a length ball on middle and off, and it straightens rather than turn away sharply. Jams his bat down to defend into the off side - it was very nearly back pad before bat"
bad ball. Tosses it up and ends up bowling a knee-high full-toss. Clears his front leg and swats it away to the forward square leg boundary
"tossed up outside off, driven with a wristy whip to sweeper cover"
"tossed up full outside off, driven to sweeper cover"

"fullish outside off, and Pandey plays a checked drive - he almost seemed to pull out of the shot - and ends up getting a thick outside edge down to third man"
"there he goes again, striding out of his crease. Coulter-Nile digs it in short outside off, and he lets it come on and dabs to third man"
"length ball angling into middle stump, clipped to midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, lets it come on and jabs to the right of backward point"
"shot! Down the track again and now Coulter-Nile bowls it in his area, full and angling into off stump. Brings his wrists into play to whip it away to the right of midwicket and bring up his fifty"
"down the track comes Pandey, and Zampa is under pressure at the start of the over. Some flight, wide of off stump, and he gets underneath it and drives inside-out over cover"
"a touch short, angling down leg. Not short enough to pull. Looks to help it fine but can't put bat to ball. Only hits his upraised front pad, and rolls away for a leg bye towards fine leg. Belatedly, Smith as decided to review for lbw, but no way is that lbw. I haven't even seen the replays,and I know impact was outside leg stump and it was missing leg by a long way. I KNOW THIS. Pitching outside, impact outside, missing. Players need to be fined for reviews like this."
"full on middle and leg, clipped to the left of short fine leg"
"flat, short, and he goes deep in his crease to whip-pull to deep backward square leg. Wasn't quite short enough for the full-blooded arms-extended pull"
down the track and it's too flat and quick to get any elevation. Drags his slog along the ground to deep midwicket
"down the track again, and this time Pandey puts it away. A difficult shot, because he fired it flat and full at his feet, and he had to quickly get his front leg out of the way to bring his bat down. He manages that, and whips it away hard, so hard it beats long-on's desperate dive to his right"
"bouncer, and Jadhav isn't in a great position for the hook. Needs to meet it above his right shoulder. Loops up in the air but falls safely in front of the man coming in from the long leg boundary. They manage to run two as well"
"length ball, and he uses his wrists to meet that on a fourth-stump line and whip it through backward square leg"
"wham! That's full on off stump, and he's cleared his front foot and simply flicked it over the midwicket boundary. What a shot that is! Almost a helicopter shot, without the full flourishing Dhoni finish"
"full on off stump again, jabbed down to long-on for one"
walks across towards off stump and a step down the pitch as well. Clips the off-stump length ball to midwicket
down the track once more and Coulter-Nile sends down a clever slower short ball. Through his pull too soon and it hits him on the right hip
"starts with a slower ball, full and just outside off. Looks to squeeze it square through point, but can't connect"
"full on off stump, pushed down the ground to long-off, another slower ball"
"back of a length angling into off stump, pushed to the right of extra-cover with a straight bat, another single"
"full outside off, stabbed to deep point"
well bowled. Saw Jadhav shuffling across to off stump and sent down a yorker right by his toes.Jams his bat down to squeeze it out to long-on
"full-toss, stump-high, on off stump. Makes a bit of room and dabs to the right of backward point, where Head makes a good diving stop"
"shortish, close to off stump, makes some room and slaps it away to the left of deep point. Placed it sufficiently wide of that fielder to pick up two. Coulter-Nile was the man in the deep - he moved a little late, because initially it looked like Handscomb would move right from backward point and stop it, but he didn't quite reach the ball"
"back of a length close to off stump, dabbed down to third man"
"short, wide, and cracked away. Such fast hands, and it screams away to the right of the diving backward point fielder"
"set himself up for a similar ball, going deep in his crease with his back foot. Cummins cramped him for room this time, angling a back-of-a-length ball in towards middle stump. Chops it down into the pitch"
"excellent bowling. This time Jadhav stepped out of his crease, and he nails a yorker right at his feet. Jams down to keep it out"
"out of his crease again and he gets a bit of inward nip with this back-of-a-length ball. Sneaks under the attempted horizontal-bat swat and hits his pad, high up"
"full-toss on off stump, flat-batted down to long-off"
"now Richardson nails a yorker, on middle and leg. Gets his feet out of the way and stabs it away into the point region"
"slower ball, full and wide, dragged down the ground to long-on. Wanted the big slog but it was too full to get any elevation. The throw at the bowler's end, from Warner, is fumbled by Richardson, and they sneak an overthrow"
"another slower ball, Jadhav goes after it, but he really doesn't manage to keep his shape. Had to fetch it from well outside off, and his bottom hand came off as he went through with the shot. Skewed off the outside half of his bat and Finch completes a simple catch at long-off"
"down the track, making himself a bit of room. Doesn't quite nail the yorker and it's a driveable full ball on off stump. Drilled down the ground powerfully, but long-off moves quickly to his right to ensure it doesn't go for four"
"full on middle and leg, clipped away through square leg and the batsmen hurry through for two"
"bowled him! Top of leg stump, and the Chinnaswamy goes utterly silent. Back of a length, not quite short enough to pull. Skids through, sneaks under, and the bails go flashing"
"length ball slanting across towards off stump. Pushes at it uncertainly, his feet aren't quite moving yet, and gets an outside edge down to third man"
"back of a length, angling down leg, and Dhoni tucks it away fine, too fine for the man at fine leg to stop. Don't know if Cummins was a little put off by Dhoni's initial movement across the stumps"
"down the track and he has an almighty heave across this short ball. Inside-edges past leg stump, and Wade throws himself to his left to stop it"
"short, rising ball. Too close to off stump to cut, and he's off his feet and he inside-edges down into the ground, not far from off stump"
"again a big step across his stumps. Cummins digs it in, just back of a length, angling into the body, and Dhoni swivels to pull to long leg"
"shortish, too close to off stump to get the kind of power he wants with the cut. Straight to backward point"
"slower ball wide of off stump, flat-batted hard but straight to extra-cover"
"slower ball, fullish outside off. Another huge slog from Dhoni, loses his shape, and nearly inside-edges into his off stump. Wade dives left to make sure it doesn't run away behind him"
"short outside off, and Dhoni's flat-batted it for six! Finally gets some leverage, some width, and he just slaps it away over the covers"
"bowled him! He's really not got to grips with Richardson's slower one, and he's dragged this on. Was on the cards, given how much he was hitting across these balls. Back of a length, closer to off stump this time. Goes for the big swipe over the leg side, only manages an inside-edge onto his stumps"
"slower short ball, angling down leg. Not the greatest of balls to bowl with fine leg inside the circle, but Shami only manages to swat it straight to that fielder"
"length ball on middle and off, only manages to push towards extra cover and pick up one"
back of a length on middle stump. Moves away from leg stump to make room to swipe down to long-on
"back of a length, angling across towards middle stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"shortish on leg stump, tucked away towards deep square leg"
"back of a length on leg stump. Looks to whip it against the angle, gets a leading edge that loops up and drops into no-man's land in front of deep square leg running in"
"sees him backing away from the stumps and sends down a yorker that doesn't miss leg stump by much, after Shami jabs at it in vain"
"length ball on off stump and Axar holes out. A good-looking straight bat loft down the ground, but he doesn't quite get enough on it to clear long-on"
"length ball outside off, slashed to sweeper cover"
"full on middle stump, swiped down to long-on"
"full on off stump, whipped in the air, on the bounce, to midwicket"
"shot. Waist-high full-toss on middle and leg, and he moves away from the stumps to make a bit of swinging room and club it away over midwicket. The umpire suggests it's just below waist high"
"back of a length outside off, Shami swings and misses, looking for the big drive over the covers"
