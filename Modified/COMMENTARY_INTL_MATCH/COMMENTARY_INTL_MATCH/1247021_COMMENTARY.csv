"bouncer over leg stump catches Maqsood by surprise, legal on height."
<strong>how did that miss leg stump?!</strong> Bouncer yorker combo from Afridi is executed near flawlessly. Nearly picture perfect yorker goes past the flick of Maqsood trying to jam this out.

Confusion results and Christian is stranded halfway down the pitch as an accurate throw from Samit comes over the non-striker's stumps to Afridi who takes the bails off with Christian two yards short."

"<strong>another yorker! Another wicket! Another raucous celebration! </strong> Amir tried to get a bit too cheeky and walk across his stumps to ramp Afridi over fine leg. The yorker was directed on fourth stump and Amir does get bat on it barely only enough to ricochet back onto the stumps. Afridi runs past Amir screaming with intensity just past Amir's ear. Not in his face, but close enough that the second innings bowling from Amir should be plenty spicy..."
<strong>another yorker... and how was that not another wicket?! Searing just past off stump at 151 kph!</strong> Fastest ball of the match is the final one of the innings.

Fielder from cover runs in, picks up and releases underarm in one swift movement"

"wide yorker attempted, winds up as an ankle height full toss on sixth stump sliced over point for a long single."
"<strong>wicket time! Fakhar nabbed with a slower ball!</strong> The globetrotting T20 champion Christian shows the sly fox he is with an offcutter landing full on fifth stump, Fakhar's timing is off and skies a drive to long-off. Babar is underneath it with hands in front of his face, palms out getting his eye literally right behind the ball as it comes down in his hands five yards inside the rope. The crowd roars for the home side. They're still in it!"
"wide yorker on the money on sixth stump, toe-jammed out through extra cover for a single."
"yorker on fourth stump, Wiese plays over the top of it and can't get bat on it as he misses an attempt to run it off an open face behind point."
"full and wide, misfires on the length going for another yorker and Wiese slices this with an open face clearing short third man with ease to the rope."
"<strong>oh dear! Wiese turns his bat into a Matador cape!</strong> Full toss at shin height on seventh stump, Christian gets the length horribly wrong going for another yorker but Wiese waves through the ball. Had to go for a boundary and misses out completely."
"wide yorker, almost a perfect delivery on seventh stump but Dunk toe edges this out wide of the keeper and Clarke leaps in vain as it whistles to the third man rope."
"Amir goes much straighter this time on off stump, Dunk heaves this flat down the ground to long-on."
"Amir goes for the bouncer and Wiese is caught off guard, cramped for room and a top edge sails over the keeper for four."
"yorker on fifth stump, tries to flay this through cover and an inside edge skids past off stump and beats Clarke diving left to the rope yet again for four!"
"Amir is indeed very human right now! Goes for yorker and misses quite badly for his standards, it's in the slot on fifth stump and Wiese unloads freeing his arms to pulverize this over long-off."
"goes for wide yorker again, lands it on seventh stump and Wiese scuffs it out to mid-off on the ring who makes a diving stop to keep it to one."
"too full on sixth stump, Wiese licks his lips and carves this up high and deep over long-off. That might just about do it."
"<strong>Wiese keeps the chasing streak alive at 11 games!</strong> Slower bouncer, Wiese smokes this flat over square leg and it thuds into the boundary foam on the full for a six to finish the match, incredibly with four balls to spare. From 30 off 12, Qalandars have iced it with plenty of room to spare."
