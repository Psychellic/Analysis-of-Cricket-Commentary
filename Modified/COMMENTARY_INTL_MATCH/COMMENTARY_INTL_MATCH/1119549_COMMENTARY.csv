"<b>what a moment! Kohli has pulled off a direct hit run out</b> But why did England risk that second run? It was always going to be tight. The ball was worked into midwicket, Kohli chased it down, slid, picked up in one motion. They were committed to the second (appeared to be Bairstow's call).

It's the perfect length, half a yard short of a good length. He can't be fully forward or back - just stay on the crease and offer soft hands. He does it too, but along with the movement, Ishant has got this to spring up and create some pace.

"<b>a beauty and edged behind!</b> Good length at off stump, late movement from Stokes, starts to shape in then moves away to square up Rahul and it's a regulation outside edge"
"<b>beats the edge and there's a huge appeal</b>...Curran is up with a massive appeal and so are the slips, but Bairstow says he's clipped his pad. And he's right. Excellent delivery which slanted across"

"full on middle stump, driven down the pitch where Curran stops with his left hand"
"<b>huge appeal!</b> But there's an inside edge on this...is what I think. Root doesn't care what I think. They've reviewed. In-dipper. Kohli pushing forward and seems to have bat-padded this...oh but hang on, <b>it has missed bat!</b> But it's going over! Oh dear! What a match this is. Kohli had a big, big stride and that's saved him. The illusion of bat was because he had jammed it against front pad while trying to flick this"

"<b>beaten.</b> Short ball outside off, pokes with an angled bat and doesn't have any luck"

"<b>edge flies past third slip.</b> This Ashwin experiment, at the very least, is bringing boundaries. Anderson gets this to cut away as he gets on the front foot for the defence"
"<b>no escape this time!</b> He's walked at a length ball in the corridor and nicked a thin one through to Bairstow. Marginal shape away matched by marginal feet movement. He's almost falling into this shot, with hard hands. Almost like he's been lulled by a drifter of his own. Anderson has his first wicket, India are five down"
"<b>jabs and beaten.</b> Wow that is a nervous shot. Shuffles, walks, stretches, pokes. It's so wide outside off. Some extra bounce too"
"short of a length on off stump and he's calmer this time, nicely behind the line to drop it into the covers"

"length ball wide outside off, left alone"
<b>fifty</b> for Kohli. Anderson losing his line this over and the Indian support is buzzing at Edgbaston! Short ball onto the hips and he hops up to nudge this fine
<b>big lbw appeal</b> that amuses Kohli. Anderson traps him on the pad but it's a big stride and he's well outside off as this shapes back in
"<b>away from the body</b> and this lands short of third slip. Somewhat loose from Kohli. It's short and wide, there for the cut. He goes with an open face instead, jabbing at it"

It's very full ball. There's no bat...<b>and this is hitting leg stump!</b> Aleem Dar's decision stands. The crowd are giving him a standing ovation, but is this is it for England?
