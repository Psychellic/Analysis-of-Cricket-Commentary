"fullish start around off, pushed back towards mid-on. Dibbly-dobbly nothing from Mathews to start, a loosener"
"full again outside off, respectfully defended towards cover point"
"width and slashed. Can't bowl there. Too wide and Rohit lets his hands through the line, carving a cut from down to up so that it goes over the infield, past backward point"
"fullish outside off, a bit of away swing, dabbed away towards short third man"
"a bit short this time, Rohit picks the length and says thanks mate. Slaps a pull over midwicket with so much ease. Disdain in that shot"
"shortish again, wide again, dabbed down to third man"
"on a length around off, defended into the midwicket region. Soft hands"
"good length delivery outside off, jammed away towards mid-off. Cramped for room"
this is glided off the open face to the deep third man. One there. That's a fantastic option
"good length again, a tad outside off and Rohit opens the bat face to guide that to third man. One more"
"yep, yep, yep. That's quality. Full, overpitched. And Rahul off-drives that with the full face of the bat, the timing is sublime, the placement is exquisite. All requisites for boundary-scoring"
"on the pads, worked through midwicket to keep strike"
"excellent line, close to off, fullish, defended watchfully"
"yikes. Don't expect to win too many matches <strong>if you drop those</strong>. It was wide, it was short. Rahul slashes that straight to backward point. The ball bounces out of Samarawickrama's hand, the back part of it. Have to take it."
"shortish and wide, some nibble, inward movement, chopped into the keeper's pads"
"yummy shot again. A tad full, and wide. Rahul leans into the drive, hits it towards cover, who dives to his left, and palms it away to save three"
"a tad wide this time, punched to the sweeper cover from the back foot"
"another fine stop. Good length and wide, Rahul carves the ball towards the fielder at backward point who dives to his right and saves three more. Bitter-sweet over in the field, more bitter though"
"<strong>lobs over mid-on.</strong> It's full outside off, stops in the pitch a tad. Rahulo ties to go over the off side, but the ball skews off the inside half and chips over the fielder"
"good length outside off, a dab to point"
on a length again outside off. Rahul lets the ball come to him before just tapping it towards slip. The de Villiers way. Too close to the keeper
"you want power? You want timing? You want T20? Take it and go. On a length outside off, Rahul comes down, it's shortish, but still goes through with a lofted shot and it goes, and goes and goes into the top tier over mid-off. <strong>Shot of the tour. </strong>"
"pace off the ball immediately after. Shortish legcutter, can't time it. That's an indicator that that's the way to go. Pace off"
"another legcutter outside off, can't connect with an attempted dab. DOT"
"not great timing but six again. Short boundaries, help yourself. Good length on middle, Rohit stays in his crease and swats a pull. Over midwicket. six more."
"fullish delivery outside off, Rohit is through his shot too early, hits it towards cover. <strong>Pace off the ball is definitely working. </strong>Comparatively at least"
"well done. Slower ball and out goes the timing. Rohit is through an attempted sweep-scoop too early, a thick leading edge lobs to third man"
"whatever you bowl, you have to bowl it well. That's a filthy slower ball, short down leg, and Rahul helps himself to four with a help-along to fine leg. Sri Lanka have learnt quickly that pace off is working, now to execute"
"six more! Not timed, but six. These are the boundaries again. Another slower ball, not a bad option at all. but Rahul just lifts the ball straight, right over his partner. Six over long-on"
"full, outside off, played quietly towards point"
"the bottom-handed whip. Rohit has had enough of being cautious against Dananjaya. He charges immediately, converts flight into a full toss and clips the ball through midwicket with immense power in his bottom hand"
"the legspinner? Not too sure. Flat, pushed through, on off, pushed to cover"
tripe. But that is expected with wristspin occasionally. Drifts well down leg and Rohit sweeps through backward square leg. Would have been wide but Rohit will take four
"six more. Flight again, outside off, Rohit gets underneath it ably and lofts the ball over mid-off. Over long-off. He picked his spot and with his timing, six everyday on this ground"
"flatter this time, the off break, nudged to long-on"
a simple nudge through midwicket to finish the Powerplay at 59 for 0
"another legcutter, around middle and leg, nudged to midwicket"
"overpitched delivery outside off, drilled through cover for a couple, the sweeper cover gets around"
"a wide yorker outside off, jammed out to the cover fielder"
"lovely shot. It's full and wide, similar to the second ball of the over, but he got one with a cover drive, so he improvises, changes the bat angle and slashes one through point"
"105 kph, another slower delivery, pushed to long-on. Wanted one all along to keep the score ticking."
"that's sensational batting. A low full toss outside off, Rahul picks his area again and just times the heck out of the ball. Chipped almost, but lands just inside the boundary. A little higher on the bat and that would be six. T20 margins eh?"
"flight outside off, 91 kph, Rohit powers a drive, plenty of power and over cover for another boundary, too easy"
"four more. Shortish outside off, Rohit cuts this time, straight to backward point who can't tackle the spin, the ball bounces off his body and ricochets away past third man for four."
"short and much slower, Rohit stays back and punches to long-on."
"nicely bowled, wide of the crease, Rahul comes forward and dead-bats, just because he can"
"and then hits the six next ball. Comes down, meets the ball just as it pitches and whispers death to the ball, smashed, whacked, right over the bowler's head. Six. Leather-tearer"
"and then the shortish ball around middle and leg, pushed to long-on"
"straight around middle from around the wicket, hit back to the bowler, Gunaratne dives to his right"
"in the gap at midwicket. A slower ball on the pads, and whipped to the deep midwicket fielder who gets around to his left"
"fifty for Rohit. A slower delivery outside off, Rohit stays low, stays in his crease and thwacks a slap over midwicket for another six."
"woooooow! Wheeeeee goes the ball. An offcutter on off, full from Gunaratne from around the wicket. What do you expect mate? Rohit slog-sweeps it 104 metres over midwicket. I want to bat here."
"four more. 104 for 0 in the ninth over. Full and wide outside off, Rohit places the dab through backward point. No catching that. Let me bat too! It's all fun for Rohit and KL"
"116 kph, and then the finesse and timing of Rohit. Full again outside off, Rohit just leans on his drive and caresses the ball through the gap at cover. Looked like one, then two, then it hit the boundary rope."
"fullish outside off, pushed towards point to get off strike, clever from Rahul"
"good length outside off, carved down to third man for one."
"another slower ball, the legcutter maybe, driven towards cover point"
"shovelled away. Wanted six, but just couldn't get the timing he wanted. Full around off, a squeeze to midwicket"
"a slower delivery outside off, pushed to long-off for one"
"a low full toss down leg, 139 kph, was looking for the yorker but you can't miss your margins, because you're going for runs even when you get it right. Whipped through backward square leg"
"a shortish ball around off, punched to long-on for one"
well bowled! Sees Rohit coming and fires a wide yorker that is just inside the tramline. Good improvisation
"it's mistimed for six. That will go down as a <strong>dropped chance</strong>, but those are never easy. A legcutter around off, Rohit swats the ball over long-on. The fielder gets under the catch, but the ball pops out and over the boundary"
"might be a wide but that's good bowling. Wide yorker, just outside the tramline this time"
"that's why the wide yorker isn't a bad option. Full delivery around off, in the slot and launched over long-on. Sensational timing again"
"that's just awesome batting. Rohit is on 91! Full outside off, close to the wide yorker but like he did in Mohali, he intentional opens the bat face and slices a six over point"
"best of the lot. That's so hard. Full delivery outside off, Rohit gets underneath the length and just lofts it, cleanly, waaay over cover. 97 off 34 now!"
punched to the sweeper cover to rotate strike
"<b>the joint-fastest T20 hundred in international cricket. Fastest by an Indian</b>. It's full and wide and Rohit whacks it over cover. Off comes the helmet. Wow, is this innings just getting started?"
"flat around off, carved to point"
pushed back to the bowler. Two dot balls. And the crowd goes wild.
"make that three. He is bowling a decent length. A googly around off, short, hit back to the bowler"
"the legbreak outside off, swatted to deep midwicket from the crease. Terrific length, because it took away several six-hitting options"
"six more. A legcutter outside off, Rohit walks across and pulls over midwicket. Fantastic timing again"
"four more. Just 88 away. Full and wide outside off, sliced for four with unbelievable timing. He just made connection with it and found the gap."
"six more. A low full toss around middle and leg, whipped over midwicket. Stunning bottom-handed power. <strong>This is the highest T20 opening stand for India</strong>"
"Rohit falls 82 short. But what a stunner that was. Friday at its best for Indian fans. Good option from Chameera, the short, slow bouncer that doesn't rise as much. Rohit sees third man up, tries to find the gap past him but can only find the short third man fielder. Terrific exhibition of stroke-making from Rohit."
"shortish delivery outside off, punched to cover after a forward charge"
"slightly overpitched around middle, punched to long-on from the crease"
"power, all muscle. Overpitched around middle and leg, Dhoni hits it hard past his partner. Long-on can't catch up with it"
"sliced for four. In the gap again and spins away for four over cover. The legbreak outside off, full, not timed but decently played anyway."
carved away through the sweeper cover
pushed to long-on for a run
"91 kph, wide outside off, inside the tramline says the umpire. Good call, good ball"
"pushed into the gap at midwicket with soft hands, Dhoni wants two, but Dananjaya runs after it and keeps it to one"
"a big appeal? Good length on middle and off, Dhoni misses a pull. Sri Lanka appeal., consider the review and bail out. Good non-review. Too high"
"just inside the boundary and four. Good length around middle and leg, swatted away into the gap at midwicket<strong> to get to fifty</strong>"
"a slower delivery down leg, helped along to fine leg"
a wide yorker that is adjudged to be just outside the tramline.
"fullish and wide outside off, sliced to the sweeper cover"
"another wide, 130 kph, looking for the wide yorker, too wide"
"six more. Too easy. Another slower delivery around off, Rahul gets underneath the length and swats it over square leg"
"good yorker. But Rahul gets a bit of bat and that is enough. A low full toss, inside-edged through fine leg for four. Good ball from Pradeep, justice is rare"
"a good slower ball outside off, Dhoni waits and waits, but misses a slog"
"a legcutter down leg, Dhoni misses a sweep, off the pad towards fine leg"
"102 kph, a slower ball on the pads, worked to square leg. A terrific over so far from Thisara"
"another slower delivery around middle and leg, Dhoni misses a flick. Thisara goes up in appeal, but umpire Anil Chaudhary says no. Thisara wants confirmation from the third umpire. 'No bat,' says the third umpire. Ball tracking says the ball is sneaking down leg. <b>SL lose their review</b>."
drifts down leg for a wide. 200 up.
"another wide yorker, hit back to the bowler with bad timing"
"superb over from Thisara. Full and wide outside off, driven away towards wide long-off. He and deep cover, running around, keep the batsmen down to two"
"stays on the back foot, transfers his weight back and muscles the ball over long-off. He didn't quite read the length, but his hands do everything required"
"wide outside off, driven towards cover. DOT"
"very wide, almost not on the pitch, outside off. Dhoni doesn't care"
"very quick, and short and flat, hammered back to the bowler. Good ball"
"the legspinner outside off, wide called, too wide. Not a bad option"
"just over midwicket. Not great timing again, but he has so much power through the line. Flat legspinner around middle, he clears his front leg and slog sweeps over midwicket for six."
"a wide yorker outside off, smashed to deep cover"
"six more. Absolute carnage. Full, in the slot, and it's gone. Weeelll over long-on. So high and enough distance too"
"good delivery. A yorker around middle and off, pushed to long-on"
"a wide legcutter outside off, would have been wide had he left it, but he got an under-edge to the keeper"
"six more. Six more straight runs from Rahul. Full and straight from Chameera, Rahul just lifted it cleanly over the bowler. Full face of the bat. He hardly ever over-hits the ball. All timing. Lovely"
"a legcutter, looked for another six. Came charging down, swiped at that, no contact. That extra bounce took it over the bat"
"another slower ball, well bowled again. Rahul is early through his pull, misses the ball, through to the keeper"
"a lofted cover drive. The legcutter became predictable there, Rahul knew what was coming, stayed in his crease, waited for the ball to come to him before just extending his cover drive. That timing and that bat angle took it for cover. Such sweet sixes."
"a good wide yorker outside off, 137 kph, hit to the sweeper cover for one. Terrific option"
"141 kph, what happened there? Gunaratne did not pick that up at all. A low full toss on the pads, Rahul just whips his hands through the line, not enough elevation. Square leg runs to his right, but did not see the ball. Six."
"what a catch. Rahul falls 11 short of a hundred. It's a wide yorker, another good option, a thick outside edge looks destined for the third man boundary until Dickwella dives to his right, full length, both feet in the air and plucks off a one-handed stunner. Needed that to get Rahul. Terrific innings though."
"to be honest, that should have gone for six. It was full, in the slot. with mid-off and mid-on up. Shovelled through mid-on for four. Just didn't get the right timing or the right part of the bat. Bowling full is not a good option. <b>India's highest T20 score</b>"
the joint-most T20I sixes in an innings. A low full toss outside is just cleverly sliced over backward point for six. Into the second tier
"well bowled. Short delivery outside off, Pandya can't time his swat well, the ball hits the splice of the bat and lobs to cover. These are the kinds of cameos that win you T20s. Maybe a bit extreme to say that in this situation but ..."
"a slower delivery on the pads, Dhoni can't connect with a flick, off the pad"
"<strong>a review from Iyer</strong>. A slower delivery on middle and leg, Iyer misses a flick and is struck in front of middle and leg. No bat. Ball tracking says it's hitting leg stump, a golden duck for Iyer."
"another slower delivery around middle and off, drilled to long-on for one."
"may be out of the question now. A full straight delivery around off, Dhoni stays in his crease, but just plain misses a big hit. Knocked over off stump. Dhoni's cameo ends. May have been a bit of reverse. Good spirit from Thisara, has bowled the tough overs quite well"
"112 kph, a slower ball on the pads, not quite timed but it races away off the inside half of the bat through backward square leg for four."
"excellently bowled. A fine yorker around off, pushed towards point. Just seven off that final over."
"a fine paddle scoop first ball. Full around middle and off, he gets underneath it and lofts the ball over short fine leg. Should have been more than one"
"full delivery outside off, Tharanga allows himself a sighter, the ball goes past the edge"
"a slower delivery outside off, chopped towards backward point"
"another slower delivery outside off, Dickwella tries to power that through cover, mis-timed to mid-off"
"drifts on the pads, flicked to deep square leg. Quiet over"
"another mis-timed scoop, toe-ended away to deep square leg"
"terrific delivery. A yorker around off, jammed out towards mid-off."
"<strong>and dropped</strong>. Rahul's first blemish of the day! Short delivery around middle, hurried for pace as Dickwella pulls. Rahul runs back from square leg, eyes on the ball but it pops out"
"six. Short but down leg, pulled way over fine leg for six. Helps it along. Good hit."
"another slower ball, on the pads, worked away to deep square leg for one"
"on a length around middle and leg, worked away through midwicket for one"
"a low full toss outside off, bunted to cover for one"
"good length outside off, slapped towards cover"
"nicely played. Charges down, picks the slower ball and slices the ball intentionally over cover. That's a very clever stroke"
"that's not a good ball and put away. Digs this in short outside off, swatted over point for four. Lands just inside the boundary"
"an offcutter on the pads, nudged down to fine leg for a run"
"a slower delivery again, straight, worked to midwicket."
"gives himself plenty of room, slower ball down leg, gets the inside half of the bat on an attempted drive, one to mid-on."
"a slower ball around leg, clears his front leg, looking to go over mid-off, inside-edged through square leg"
"digs that one in too, short around off and middle, bunted away through midwicket for a couple"
strays down leg for a wide
"whipped away over square leg, wanting to use the pace and flick through square leg but a leading edge to deep midwicket"
another wide down the leg side
"another good slower ball on middle and leg, worked to midwicket. Dickwella invites the throw by not hurrying back"
"terrific yorker. Backs away, Bumrah follows him, jams it out to midwicket for one. Karthik picks up cleanly but can't hit the stumps as he is off-balance while throwing"
"too straight, just worked with the wrists behind square. Very intentional from Tharanga, not over-hitting, relying on timing"
"another offcutter down leg, Dickwella gives himself room but the ball goes through. He can hit the ball into the leg side and use that angle to his advantage"
"a good wide yorker this time, 133 kph, inside the tramline, another dot"
"straight to deep square leg. Another slower delivery, around middle and leg, all Dickwella can do is chip a swat to the fielder at deep square leg, running in. Good bowling. He was struggling to balance himself on contact"
"gets enough, a slower short delivery. Tharanga keeps his balance, his head is still and then slaps the ball over mid-on"
"good length, quick outside off, carved off the open face to third man for one"
"strays on the pads, worked to deep square leg for one"
"flat delivery around off, swept to deep midwicket for one"
"comes down to the pitch, gets there and drills a drive wide of cover. Good timing"
"flat around off, driven to long-on for one"
"that's big. It's six. Stunning strike. Backed himself, got to the pitch and timed the lofted drive over long-off, with the spin. Lovely"
"six more. 81 kph, gets to the pitch again and goes the other side, swatted over long-on for six. Superb batting, putting Kuldeep under pressure"
"pushed through, quick around leg, misses a nudge, off the pad towards point"
charges down and shovels a flick to deep square leg for one
"an offcutter, slow around off, the ball beats the bat, past the outside edge"
"fullish around middle and off, dabbed down towards third man"
"a shortish delivery down leg, toe-ended away to long-on. Through the shot too early"
"a yorker, low full toss actually, whipped to deep midwicket"
"another shortish delivery around middle, swatted away to deep midwicket for one"
"tossed up outside off, backs away and hammers it along the floor to long-off"
"81kph, floated up at off stump. Gets down for the sweep and drags it out to deep midwicket, one bounce"
"length ball down leg side, pushed there because he saw the reverse sweep coming. The batsman can only tap it to short third man for a single"
"full at middle stump, driven down to long-on"
whew! Pummeled! You could see his biceps flex as he came down at this. Length ball at middle stump. He's not to the pitch of this after deciding to step down the track. But he keeps going for it and launches it against the turn over the midwicket fence
"back of a length outside off, chopped to sweeper cover"
"overpitched on middle stump, brings down and angled bat and hammers this along the turf to long-on"
"overpitched outside off, clears the front leg and carves this out to sweeper cover"
"short one on leg stump, follows him as he backs into the leg side. Swings cleanly and gets this pull out to deep midwicket where Iyer tumbles to his left and takes some time trying to locate the ball after getting up"
"length ball at middle stump, muscles the pull again, but straight to deep midwicket"
"bouncer dug too short for Tharanga, who ducks under it"
"takes on the bouncer this time, and in this ground, that's all you need sometimes. Top edge flies to fine leg's left and into the fence"
"length ball, slider outside off. Perera exposes the stumps and looks to sweep. It skids through straight and misses off stump"
"anticipates the angle this time, looks for the reverse sweep. Beaten"
"back of a length at leg stump, nudged to deep midwicket from the crease"
"drops it short at middle stump, Tharanga quickly on the back foot to slap this over the wide long-on boundary"
"full at leg stump, clipped off his toes between deep square and deep midwicket. They come back for the second on the throw. A weak, half-effort from KL Rahul, who seemed to withdraw"
"attempted googly sent short and wide outside off, left alone"
"crash. Tossed up on leg stump, gets the front leg there and lifts it with a golf-swing over the midwicket boundary"
"a good yorker, following Kusal who was backing away. The ball goes through"
"a slower ball down leg, helped along to fine leg"
"another slower ball, following Tharanga, cramping him for room, off the pad towards short fine leg"
"another slower ball, terrific bowling, swatted to long-on"
"a low full toss, that should have gone for six. Worked to deep midwicket"
"there's six. 140 kph, in the arc and outta here. Just a flick of the wrists, and way over square leg. Can't miss your length here. But good over for India"
"flat and wide, slapped to long-off. 'Bahut badiya,' says Dhoni (very good)"
"slow and wide outside off, Kusal gets across and drags a sweep to deep midwicket for a couple"
"the googly outside off, lovely length for that ball too, pushed back to the bowler"
six more. Fantastic batting. Doesn't quite get to the pitch of the googly but Kusal backs his cross-batted prowess and slogs a sweep over long-on. Pyrotechnics
"four more. Flat and wide outside off, hammered over cover for four more. Superb batting. <strong>He has a 26-ball fifty</strong>"
"shortish and wide outside off, shovelled to long-on. 14 off the over and they're still under-par. This is a terrific fight from SL"
"flat and wide outside off, goes on with the arm, no stroke thinking it was a wide. Inside the tramline"
"the switch hit. Turns around, switches his hands and connects with a switch hit, past backward point"
"'duuuur, duuuur,' says Dhoni (far, far). He doesn't want the ball full because when it is, Kusal can back his slog sweep, way over midwicket. Awesome hitting. Dhoni, Rohit and Kuldeep chat about options"
"nope. It's a full toss outside off and smashed straight over the bowler for four. Wow, this is getting interesting"
"very very quick, 104 kph, pushed to long-off for one"
"overpitched on off, shovelled to midwicket. Another cry of anguish from Dhoni: 'Aage naiii' (not full)."
"88 kph, pushed wider outside off, driven past cover for a couple."
"it's very wide outside off and short, left alone, called"
"that did not turn. Tharanga played for some. Full around middle and off, in the arc, but all Tharanga can get on his big slog is a leading edge. Chahal settles himself underneath it and takes a quality catch. Kept his cool. But another good innings from Tharanga"
"goes wide, wide outside off. Kusal hits it straight but not great timing behind it. Karthik runs around, but over-runs it and concedes two extra runs"
"the googly outside off, under-edged towards the keeper. Kept very low"
"six again. As soon as it's full, there is a cry of frustration from Dhoni as Kusal makes contact. Another slog over long-on for six. Magnificent batting, backing his strengths all the way"
"good length outside off, shortish, slapped back to the bowler"
"another good catch from Pandya. Golden duck for Thisara. But he can't do much. It was full but wide outside off, the stock ball. Thisara tries to drag the sweep over long-on, but can only chip it towards Pandya at long-on, who runs forward and to his right and collects it cleanly. Would have been wide had he let that go"
"81 kph, wide outside off, Kusal attempts a switch hit/reverse sweep but bails out late. Wide called"
"that should be the series for India. It was very wide outside off again, pushing it wider from the hitting arc. Kusal can't, therefore, get enough power behind the shot. All he can do is slice the ball to long-off. But that was some innings from Kusal, kept Sri Lanka in it for this long was an achievement in itself."
"comes down straightaway, gets there and lofts the ball over cover. Lovely shot"
"'ye accha hain,' says MS (that's good). Shortish outside off, swatted to deep midwicket"
"Dhoni knows he has Asela. It was a wide googly outside off that crept under Gunaratne's slog sweep. Dhoni collects, whips off the stumps and hardly even appeals, as if it say I've got him. Seems like he has. Gunaratne's back foot is dragging back slowly, but Dhoni's hands are so quick. Nothing behind the line. SL five down. Three wickets in the over"
"some flight around off, shovelled to long-on. 4-0-52-3, India will take that"
"wristspin going through SL again. It was a googly outside off, Chaturanga tries to reverse-lap that through third man but all he can do it inside edge it onto the stumps."
"shortish outside off, punched away to cover"
"another one. SL seven down. Quickly fading away. Samarawickrama comes down again, looking to go over cover but the wide legbreak beats the bat. Dhoni does the rest. Wide called. Enough turn when you slow it down"
"flat around off, worked into the leg side"
"flat and wide outside off, Dananjaya picks the variation, goes back and slaps the ball past cover's right. The sweeper cover runs to his left but can't haul it in"
"full and wide outside off, goes past the bat, but wide called"
"the googly. Chahal has four more, another four-for. The googly outside off, Dananjaya tries to slog the ball over long-on, but hardly any connection. The ball goes straight up and long-on cleans up"
"full around off, driven to long-off, a misfield from Chahal"
"good length outside off, dabbed to third man"
"full and wide outside off, beats Pradeep's outside edge"
"full outside off, a wild slog beats the bat"
and the ball again goes past the outside edge. Can't seem to figure out Bumrah's angle
another wide yorker beats the bat. Aargh. Has to bowl straight.
"a low full toss outside off, 140 kph, pushed to cover."
"full outside off, Chameera comes down but fails to connect with his swing across the line"
"a straight ball finishes the game and the series. It's the slower ball around middle and leg, Chameera fails to connect with a flick and knocks back middle and leg stump. India take the <strong>T20 series with an 88-run win in Indore</strong>"
