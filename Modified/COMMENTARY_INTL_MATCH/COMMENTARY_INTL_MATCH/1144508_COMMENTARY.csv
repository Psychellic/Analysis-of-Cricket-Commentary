<strong>Given LBW!</strong>. Liton <strong>reviews</strong> after a chat with Mushfiqur. He was caught on the crease and trapped by one that slid on quickly. He went back to a good length ball but it zipped off the surface and hit him on the knee roll. No bat involved and it's not going over. Only question is whether it's sliding down leg. No it's hitting! It was 'Umpire's call' hitting enough of leg stump! Decision stands. Bangladesh keep their review.
