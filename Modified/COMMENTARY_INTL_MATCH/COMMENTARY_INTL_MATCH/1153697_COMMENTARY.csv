"bowls this full, gets it to move away from off stump, Munro looks to blast this over cover but gets a thick inside edge towards deep midwicket"

here's the first boundary of the game! Seifert adjusts well as he skips outside the crease and then goes through with the pull even though he's cramped for room. Timed beautifully to beat deep square
"stays inside the crease, picks the length early and muscles this short ball over long-on. The camera man there was in the firing line for a while until he saw the ball curl away just a bit with the breeze"
"edged and gone! Seifert premeditates the pull, Bhuvi cleverly bowls this closer to the stumps to deny him any room, only manages to get a thin inside edge and Dhoni does the rest."
works this wide of midwicket to get off the mark
"whips this down to deep square, Khaleel the man in the deep."
"huge shout for lbw as he gets this to jag back in to beat Williamson's inside edge. They <strong>decide against reviewing</strong> it, height may have been in question as the length was on the shorter side. <b> Replays confirm a thin inside edge too </b>"
"swipes one through the leg side, Karthik hares around from deep midwicket to cut that off. Krunal with the mopping up"
looks to swing this length ball over long-on but is beaten
"gets this to skid back in on a length at 141kph, Munro hurried into this gentle tuck into the leg side"
"in his swinging arc and Munro has belted this over long-off, just besides the sight screen. As sweet as a hit can get. Stood his ground and deposited this length ball. Didn't move an inch there"
"superb comeback, <strong>ripper of a yorker on his toe</strong>, Munro somehow manages to jam his bat down to keep that out as they squeeze in a single"
"what placement! Uncorks his wrists as he opens the face of the bat to pick the gap between point and short third man. Just a hint of width and he picked the gap beautifully, supple wrists, superb timing. Class"
bunts this gently into the off side for a quick single
"deft touch, superb awareness. Waits and waits, then deflects this ever-so-late, almost as it passed him to beat MS Dhoni. No chance for square third man"
"floats this full on the pads, check-flicks this to midwicket"

"right into the blockhole, squeezed back"
"fires this length ball into middle, tucks this wide of midwicket"

lunges forward and works this against he turn to midwicket for a quick single.
cuts but straight to Dhawan at the edge of the ring at cover point
"fired full on the stumps, defends into the leg side as it rolls off an inside edge"
"<b> Real drama here! </b> Mitchell has been given out and he has reviewed upon the insistence of his captain. There is a huge spot on hotspot as ball passes the bat - possibly because there is an inside edge - and it wasn't bat hitting pad. But DRS comes back as all three reds, ball tracking shows this would've hit middle of middle so Mitchell has to walk back. As soon as the decision was given, Williamson quickly let his dismay known to the umpire and Mitchell was asked to stop, even as he started to make the long walk back. Dhoni has a word with Williamson and the umpire, Rohit has a confused look, but in the end, Mitchell has to go. The only way he could've survived was if Rohit called him back."
