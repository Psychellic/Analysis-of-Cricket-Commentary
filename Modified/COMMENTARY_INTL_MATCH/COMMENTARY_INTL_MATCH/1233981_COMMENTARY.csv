cramped for room as he chops this cut that rolls past the keeper
"lofted over the infield, hit well but mid-off hares back to throw the ball back in"
he's nailed this! Half-tracker deposited deep into the stands at deep midwicket. That was <strong>nothing short of a gift</strong>
slaps the cut to point
"flatter one on middle and leg, punched to square leg"
"ah, not quite. Wallops this short ball straight to cover"
"bangs one in on middle, Guptill tries to make room but doesn't get it, defended into the off side"
"swung away cleanly over wide long-on! Nearly out of the ground. You only have to hit it 70 metres to clear the ropes, bet you that was close to a 100."
"leading edge short of cover. Good change in pace, this was an off-cutter full on the stumps, Guptill was looking to whip this away"
"goes full and straight, a crime really, as Guptill clears his front leg and belts this down the ground and into the sight screen. As clean as they come"
beaten by a sharp bouncer as he was looking to hook this one into the stands
"slower and fuller, Guptill backs away and slices this over point for a couple"
"reverse-swept over point, and guess what? The fielder did all the hard work in giving it chase and ended up scooping the ball over the ropes in trying to pull it back in. <strong>Comedy of errors.</strong> Shoriful the fielder in question."
"fired full on middle and leg, Allen stands still and muscles this away over midwicket, scuppers away to the rope"
"swung away, no chance for wide long-on. <strong>Make that three in a row.</strong> He went full outside off, Allen moved across a bit to hammer that away"
"smashed back, clears the ropes. Into the top tier. Straight hit. Terrific this. Finn has played a reverse, a muscular hoick, a whip and now a straight drill"
"hammered down to long-on, made a clean thwaaaaack as the ball met bat"
"inside edge as he tries to slog sweep, good stop at short fine"
"length ball on off, bunts this wide of cover"
beaten by an excellent short ball angling away. Allen was nearly halfway down as he charged down to pull
"difficult chance <strong>put down by Rubel</strong> running back from mid-off.Allen sliced this slower delivery over mid-off, no power behind it whatsoever. He was looking to absolutely muscle that away."
"full toss and he's belted this back over the bowler's head, one bounce into the boundary. Can't have a field for such bowling unfortunately"
"ah, the ball wasn't more than a few yards away from deep extra cover but he had no chance because this was <strong>hit so hard!</strong> Length ball, Allen backs away to make room and flay that away. Swung really hard at that"
"this is very, very, high. <strong>Dropped again</strong> as mid-off and mid-on converge. Soumya the fielder. Not easy with the lowlights but this was a steepler. No one looked like catching that."
"scooped over short fine! Fear? What's that asks Allen. <s> Goes all the way too. </s> Nah, one bounce. Incredible"
"he's clobbered this over point. <strong>Virender Sehwag would be mighty proud!</strong> Makes room, uses the width and slaps that 20 rows back"
"mistimes this attempted wallop over long-on, down to the fielder"
"slower length ball, Guptill reaches out to toe-end this over cover, two more"
"slower length ball on middle, extra bounce, bunted down the ground"
"beaten as he was through with this pull too early, had to fetch it from way outside off, didn't help that he'd made a lot of room too"
belted over long-on! Shortish and angling away from around the wicket and Guptill had a free swing at that
swung away over deep backward square! Picked the bones out of that. This was down leg and asking to be hit. All Guptill had to do was lend direction
low full toss but Guptill reaches out and then gets down on one knee to drill this to the extra cover boundary
same ball - a full toss - same shot but this time there's man at deep cover to take the catch. This was struck well but the fielder had been placed a tad wider specifically for that.
fired full on the pads and Allen tickles it away to beat short fine
squirted down to long-on
"hammered back, Rubel must be thanking his stars that his shin wasn't in the way of that! Allen raises a <strong>maiden T20I fifty</strong>"
"<strong>Soumya puts down another, coming in from long-off</strong>. Tough chance though, did all the hard work in haring in and putting in a full-stretch dive but couldn't hold on. Allen was looking to muscle it away but didn't get power as he was cramped for room"
flayed that on the up to deep point
"scooped to the left of short fine, couldn't get it fine enough, deep square runs around to cut that off, also couldn't get power because this was a slower delivery"
"pulls this length ball, for a second it appeared as if he didn't time it as well as he would've liked, but that is a short boundary at deep midwicket"
flat-batted into the sight screen. The bowler has a puzzled look on his face
steps out and whips this down to long-on
"fired full and wide, round-amish from Mahedi, on a Yorker-length, beaten"
"Phillips gave away his intention of playing a switch hit even before the bowler delivered, this was fired full down leg as a result, toe-ended to long-off"
"slices this wide full toss to deep point, the man in the deep failed to spot the ball, when he finally did, he didn't account for this one spinning away. <strong>Oh, dear. Misjudged it completely</strong>"
full toss on leg and he's swung this deep over cow corner.
flicks this to deep square leg
"flat-batted down to long-on, from way outside off"
"yorker-length and he's drilled this straight to mid-off, good catch from Soumya. Couldn't get underneath the length to get the elevation and toe-ended it."
"excellent short ball into the rib-cage, he fends it away into the leg side for a single"
"swung away, one bounce into the wide long-on boundary. Stepped out again to meet this length ball with the middle of the bat"
"short ball angling away, Allen backs away and swings. Goes a mile high, Shoriful runs to his right to try and take a return catch but <strong>bails out in the end</strong>. That's a fourth catch missed"
"goes full and wide, Allen looks to squeeze that away behind point but is beaten, umpire deems it to be too wide"
"drilled back, good stop off his own bowling. Ouch, that will hurt."
"slower, fuller and Mitchell backs away to drill this over the bowler's head. Held his shape just for a split-second before going big"
"mistimes this full toss down to wide long-on, sharp work from Naim"
"slower length ball angling in, he was looking to swing this into the leg side but ended up getting an inside-edge onto the pads, they scamper a single"
"top-edges this attempted scoop and an excellent innings comes to an end. Taskin holds his length back by trying a knuckleball, Allen walked across to play the ramp but because there was pace off, got it off a thick edge. But what an innings, what a knock."
"pulled to deep midwicket, they will hare back for two"
"reaches out to squeeze this Yorker-length delivery to cover, chancing a second in the hope that the fielders are caught napping, sadly not. In comes the throw to the keeper and Mitchell is out."
heaves on the leg side first ball and he's off the mark
pitched up just a little bit and Soumya has swung that nicely to send that flying left of mind-on for four on his first ball
"slower ball this time and same result! Much slower and straighter and he sends that back straighter as well, right over the bowler's head"
"frees his arms and clears the in-field yet again, two this time over the cover point region"
"appeal for caught behind, the umpires get together and refer it upstairs, and the <b>soft signal is out</b>. On the pads from Southee, Soumya was flicking it away on the leg side and he got an inside edge before the ball lobbed off the pads back towards the bowler. The third umpire is also checking if the return catch was clean from Southee, who had to dive forward. The catch is clean, Southee's fingers are under the ball, and it's out!"
"two in two, the captain is gone for a first ball duck! Scrambled seam from Southee, nice and full on the off stump, Liton tries an unorthodox paddle by doing a long way across and misses it to lose his stumps"
"138.8kmh, straight and full on the off stump and that's dispatched back over the bowler's head for six. Spotted the length early and struck that well off the middle"
"it's short but on the off side and this time Naim ramps it with a flick of the wrists for another six! Waits for it on the back foot, uses his wrists and sends it flying over third man"
"120.2kmh, takes the pace off and beats Naim who is early into the shot and gets an inside edge that rolls towards the keeper"
"122.2kmh, slower and short of length again, looked like a cutter and it rises on Naim who pushes it down the ground"
"short of length again, just outside off and he finds extra cover"
"114.8kmh, slower to end the over as well, and there might have been an edge to the keeper. Was there an edge, did it carry, it's gone upstairs again and the <strong>soft signal is not out</strong>. Replays confirm that didn't carry cleanly, so Naim survives"
"Full and straight to Shanto, the pace beats the batsman but he gets one off the inside edge"
"118.5kmh, the slower one does't work for Ferguson the way it did for Milne. Slow and full, Naim picks the lack of pace and swings that back over the bowler's head for four"
"143kmh, on length and he drills it down to long-on for one"
"145.4kmh, that's a mean and quick bouncer. Shanto pulls but can't  get back on it"
on length on the off stump and Shanto gets a single by driving it down to mid-off
driven down to mid-off again off length and a single to end the over
starts with the wrong'un and beats him outside off
"<strong>almost cleans him up</strong>! Length delivery on leg and another wrong'un, Naim sweeps and misses and nearly loses his stumps"
"finds long-on this time and Astle gets a wicket. The third googly in a row from Astle, he knew Naim was going to go after it and the length was apt. Naim swung and could only hole out to long-on where Chapman took a good catch diving forward"
"<strong>just over a leaping backward point</strong>! Shanto scythed the ball outside off, the fielder at point leapt to his right but the ball just about beat him, and Sodhi chases the ball to the third man boundary where, bizarrely, he slides on his leg leg and then pulls the ball back with the back of his left arm/elbow. The third umpire is checking if his leg was touching the rope at the same time. It's very close and it's been given a four, looked like the leg touched the rope when his finger tips were still on the ball"
"sneaks through with an inside edge as he comes down, nearly yorks himself and the edge goes past the keeper to the fine leg region"
"the wrong'un has done it, and Shanto is bowled! Second wicket in the over as Shanto went for the pull but he was deceived by the lack of pace and lost his middle stump. He'll regret missing this long hop"
Afif comes down to take the ball on the full and chips it down to long off
pushes the ball into the covers for one
"misses the big swing outside off and Conway has <b>appealed for a stumping here</b>. Very smart work from Conway to flick the bails off with his right hand as Afif was in his follow through, unaware of how close his back foot was from being outside the crease. The heel is in the air, and it's completely clear if any part of his foot is behind the line or not. The third umpire is checking different angles. Benefit of the doubt goes to the batsman because there might have been something behind the line, so Afif survives"
On the pads and he misses the sweep
Dances down and gets a single to long-on
"Full and straight, he swings hard and high down the ground and just about clears long off for six"
too short on the leg side and that's been punished with a back-foot swivel-pull to the long-leg boundary for six
"slower through the air and beats him outside off. Oh, and this time <b>Conway is very confident about the stumping</b>. Flicks the bail off and runs away in celebration. Afif missed the sweep, heel of the back foot in the air and it's not as close as the appeal in the last over. Nothing behind the line and he's out"
"slider towards the stumps, beaten on the back foot"
"holes out to deep midwicket, the easiest of catches for Phillips in the deep. Flattish length outside off, Mahedi couldn't get under it properly and swept the ball to the leg side but hardly got the distance even on this small ground"
"flat and quick outside off, he steers it towards third man for one"
""
"full toss on leg, and it's pushed down to long on for one where Chapman dives to his left and parries the ball to long off"
"he just clears long-on, and gets six! Slow and back of length knuckle ball on leg stump, Shoriful cleared his front foot and got just enough distance to swing that over long on"
"full and quick, another swing from Shoriful but he's bowled this time. Bangladesh are crumbling here. This was close to 140kmh, full on the base of the leg stump and goes under the bat"
"138.7kmh, wide yorker this time. Taskin tries to get some bat on it but misses"
"almost in the black hole outside off, Taskin clears his front foot this time and drives it just past a diving mid-off for four"
"full and on the stumps, Taskin drives it down to long on"
"Slower ball at 123kmh from the back of the hand, but the target is the same: the stumps. Full and straight, Taskin wants to swing it away but he's deceived by the pace and loses his stumps"
"140.3kmh, full and quick, just outside the off stump in the block hole and Rubel can't get any bat on it"
Pulls the length back this time and Rubel slaps it to extra cover for a quick single
"139.8kmh, quick and down the leg side for a wide"
a full toss this time and it's pushed down to long off for one
"he backs away and Ferguson follows him with a back of length ball, worked down towards long on for one"
"117.7kmh, slower than many of his slower balls, it's back of length so Mosaddek waits and then steers it to third man"
"targets the top of off stump with this nicely bowled knuckle ball, and Mosaddek chops it late to get two behind square on the off side"
"another knuckle ball, this time Mosaddek swings on the off side and sends that high before Will Young runs back and dives with perfect timing to get both hands to it"
another slower ball - just 98.3kmh - and beats him on the off side with a full delivery
"130kmh this time, Rubel gets bat on it this time but he finds extra cover"
"104.9kmh, another slower ball, this one is short and he pulls it for one"
"almost in the block hole, and he digs it out on the off side past mid-off for one"
"on length on off, he cross-bats it to leg for two"
"103.4kmh, angling in from around the wicket, he sweeps and misses to take it on the body"
"that's it, Bangladesh are all out in under 10 overs and New Zealand pocket the series 3-0. Full outside off, and Nasum skies it for an easy catch to extra cover"
