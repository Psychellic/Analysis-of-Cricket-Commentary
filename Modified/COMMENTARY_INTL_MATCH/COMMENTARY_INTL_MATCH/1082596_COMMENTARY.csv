"back of length on middle, tucks McCullum up, defended to the off side"
appeal for lbw but the ball pitched miles outside leg. McCullum looked to pull and was too early into the stroke. The ball deflects to short third man

"what a big wicket, a potentially big moment. The dangerous McCullum never looked in today. This is the wrong'un which he looks to sweep but plays too early and is beaten. Struck plumb in front of middle. Umpire had no hesitation in raising the finger."
"<b> Dropped! </b> Sharp, sharp chance. This one is fuller in length, Raina looks to go inside-out stroke over cover, but the ball drifts away late to take the edge to Warner who nearly managed to pull off a blinder at slip. Put his hand out to the right but couldn't hold on"
muscled into the deep midwicket region where Rashid charges across and hurls a flat throw at the striker's end
"once again looks to go leg side but doesn't get hold of the pull. Dhawan at midwicket dives forward to complete a low catch. Roy wasn't convinced it carried and queried to the umpires, who after the benefit of multiple replays, decided it was a clean catch. Dhawan claimed the catch immediately."

"he continues to weave his magic. This is another googly that drifts in from wide of the crease. Finch didn't pick it off the hand and stabbed outside the line, only to see the ball cut back in to beat the inside edge and hit him plumb in front. Lions in real rouble"
turns the incoming length ball to the leg side gently to get off the mark
"too full on off stump, squeezed to long-off"

plants forward and punches an away-going delivery on the up to long-off

"touch short and down leg, nurdled to short fine leg"
picks the googly. Gets outside the line and wrists it to deep midwicket

"angled into the pads, flicked to dine leg"

gets to the pitch of the ball and crunches this into the gap at deep extra cover
"googly that spins back in a long way, hit on the pad but the angle would've taken it down leg"

"slider that drifts into middle, worked to square leg"

"beauty again. Sharp turn from outside off, DK plays inside the line as it fizzes through to the keeper. End of a fine spell."

He looked to muscle it a lot straighter, but was hitting towards the longer boundary. The ball cut back in a wee bit as well which ensured the bat face turned in his hand. Handy knock nevertheless"

cuts but straight to Yuvraj who fires a throw at the bowler's end. A direct hit and Dhawal was gone despite a dive
an overthrow from the midwicket fielder at the bowler's end results in a single
"tickles one to the keeper. He looked to get down on one knee and ramp this over the keeper's head but Nehra followed him. Cleverly done by the old war horse. The bounce did the trick this time, got too big on Karthik and he ended up getting some glove on it."
"steps out to go over cover, ends up getting a thick edge down to third man"
"total miscommunication. Dhawal nudges this to the leg side, sets off for a single without looking at PK. Rashid swoops in from midwicket and effects a direct hit at the striker's end with a rocket throw. Dhawal wasn't even in the frame."
hit on the up between cover and point to get off the mark
dabs it gently to cover as they hare across for a single

"pushed through quicker on middle and leg, whipped into the deep midwicket region. Took the fielder on and hared back for the second without much fuss"
"half-tracker and deposited into the wide long-on boundary. Lions receiving a real pounding here. No control with the length, Warner will pick those most days"
"look to flick a low full toss but turned the bat face too early, the leading edge is gobbled up easily by McCullum at cover. This was an attempted off-cutter, so it was much slower than Dhawan expected. 'Middle of the edge,' says Clarke on air. Some relief for Lions"

"skids one on middle from around the stumps, Warner works it to midwicket for a quick single"
