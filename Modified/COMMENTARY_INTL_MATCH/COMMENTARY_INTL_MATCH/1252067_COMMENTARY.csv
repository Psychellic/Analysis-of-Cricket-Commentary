"length ball on middle and leg, turns it towards short fine leg. Any other batsman would have fancied a single there"
length ball at the stumps and finally Simmons gets what he wanted. Backs away and unleashes a pull to send it over deep square leg. The ball has gone into the swimming pool over the boundary line. An 87-metre six

"length ball outside off, was a slower one but Gayle waited for it and muscled it over mid-off"
"a slower length ball on the pads, Gayle misses the flick and is hit on the knee roll. An appeal for lbw but it landed outside leg. Gayle is late to realise there's a chance of a leg-bye as the ball bounces square of the wicket on the off side. Scampers through though"
"short and pulled again, this time behind square leg and that's four more to Simmons"
"too full outside off, clears his front leg and crunches it through the point region. A big over from West Indies, just what they needed"
"out first ball. He dragged that down and it's not a great ball in truth. But Gayle has picked out deep midwicket with his bludgeon across the line. Genuinely a bit of a loosener from Hasaranga first ball, with the legbreak bouncing mid-pitch and asking to be hit. Somehow, though, Gayle doesn't get under it enough, and Ashen Bandara at deep midwicket tears in from the boundary to get his hands underneath that. Good catch"
"flatter ball outside off stump, Pooran goes back and punches this wide enough of mid off to get a single"
"big legbreak outside off, which his fended away to short third man and they scamper through. It's not a good run though. If the throw had been on target, Pooran would have been well out there. In the end, the ball's nowhere close to the wicketkeeper. Missed opportunity for SL"
"tossed up leggie, clipped towards deep midwicket for a single"
"Has Hasaranga got another? Looks that way. It's that googly again. Pretty much a textbook Hasaranga dismissal - a tossed up delivery that Simmons doesn't pick as the googly. He plays down the wrong line, and it spins to take the front pad in front of offstump. The umpire doesn't really hesitate to raise the finger. Simmons reviews, but that can't save him. It's three reds - the ball going on to hit middle and leg."
"legbreak, tossed up, pitching on about offstump and straightening. Holder gets low and paddles this around the corner to get off the mark"

"powerful strike. Gunathilaka goes flat again, but pitches too far outside off and gives Holder the chance to free his shoulders. Holder thumps this down the ground, flat and hard, for a six"
"gets him now! Again this was speared in, and Holder can't quite get under it. He tries to slam another six, but the elevation isn't there, and it's a fairly straightforward catch for long off, who only has to move a little to his right to swallow that one. Gunathilaka is having a fantastic game."
flatter delivery again. pitching on the stumps. Defended back to the bowler
speared in slightly wide of the stumps this time. Pooran goes back and cuts but can't beat point

floated up into the pads. Pooran gets back and clips this to deep midwicket for a single
"floated up very full, almost a yorker. Bravo could have been more aggressive here, but chooses only to knock it down to long off for one"
"got him first ball. This one seemed to stop on the pitch slightly, and Bravo has sent a simple catch to midwicket off the leading edge of his bat. It's only 131kph from Chameera. Bat Bravo is through the shot early, and the ball balloons up into the legside, where Mathews jogs in from midwicket to get under this dolly."
"length ball on the pads. Pollard tries to turn this around the corner and misses, ball thudding into pad"
short of a length ball pitching outside the off stump. Pollard rides the bounce and drops it into the legside. There's time for a quick single
"length ball outside off, punched on the up to mid off"
"another one! Wickets are tumbling here, and Sri Lanka are ecstatic. That's just a bad shot from Pooran, though, as he plays a huge swipe across the line to a length ball that is angled in from around the wicket. It's not short enough for that sort of shot, and the ball whizzes underneath the bat to ping off stump."
"does Chameera have another wicket? The umpire thinks so. He's been given lbw to a length ball, but that is legside-ish. Allen sends it upstairs. Yup. that always seemed to be sliding down leg, and ball tracker agrees. It would have missed leg stump."
Pollard gets first blood as Hasaranga drags this googly down and pitches too short. Batsman just gets back and thumps this over deep midwicket for a six. Just about clears the rope
"big legbreak, though it was a flattish delivery. Pollard is prodding at that, and it beats his outside edge"
"legbreak again, and flat once again. Don't know how many spinners are willing to toss it up to Pollard right now. He gets back and turns this to deep midwicket for one"
"tossed up outside off stump. Allen tries to bash this over the legside, but it takes an inside edge and squirts off towards short fine leg"
"googly, fast and flat. It's on to Allen quicker than he expects and the most he can do is keep that out"
tossed up outside off. Allen gets to the pitch of the ball and drives to long on
fired flat and a little wide. Allen reaches for this but can't beat cover
"flat and wide again, and Allen frees his shoulders effectively this time, bashing that high over cover, all the way for a big six. Loose bowling from Dananjaya, who'd put in an excellent first spell earlier"
"legbreak, once again bowled flat, pitching wide and turning away even wider. Allen reaches again, but this time toe-ends it back to bowler"
"legbreak outside off, hit straight to mid off"
"again a wide legbreak, turning big. Probably would have been a wide if Allen left it alone, but it takes the under edge of his bat and dribbles off behind the keeper and they take a single"
"he's beaten him with a beautiful legbreak. Pollard prods at this leggie, but it pitches and turns to beat the outside edge"
"lovely legbreak first ball. Pitches slightly short, but turning far enough to beat the bat as Allen tries to punch to off"
huuge shot attempted. Tries to slam this over cow corner. But Hasaranga's legbreak is too good and Allen misses
"another leggie, which Allen can't do much with"
"speared into the legs a little, straightening off the surface. It rolls off towards square leg and Pollard calls Allen through for a quick single"
"legbreak again, on the stumps, slightly flatter. Defended"
"slightly shorter delivery, flat again. Defended once more"

back of a length ball outside off stump. Poked into cover point for a single
"leggie first up, pitching outside off and turning away. Pollard gets back to punch it to long off"
"that's pretty plumb. This time it's the lebgreak that gets the lbw though. This is floated up, pitching on middle and off and straightening. Allen goes for a huge slog sweep and misses. It hits him on the thigh and would have hit off stump. Not a tough decision for the ump."
"googly first up, I think. Sinclair gets forward and just keeps it out"
another googly - Hasaranga bowling for another lbw. Sinclair gets forward enough to get some bat to it. They sprint one as the ball squirts away to leg off the inside edge
"flattish lebgreak, which Pollard gets back to hit down to long on"
"tossed up nicely, pitching just outside off. Sinclair drives this confidently to long off"
"this is pushed flat and wide, angled across the batsman. Sinclair tries to chop down on this, but misses"
"floated up, pitching on middle and straightening. Just pushed back to the bowler"
"tossed up again, and this time Sinclair hits across the line. A misfield at midwicket allows a single"
"flat ball, which Pollard swipes hard across the line to cow corner, where deep midwicket runs across and stops a four with a diving save. Pollard has refused to take a run there, so stays on strike"
"that's got to be the game now, right? Sandakan fires this wide of off stump from around the wicket, and at this stage, Pollard has no choice but to reach for it. He tries to slam it over cover, but it takes the outside half of his bat and flies towards the sweeper cover, who runs in quickly to get under that"
"stock ball, pitched on about leg and turning away from Sinclair. He tries to sweep but doesn't connect and the ball hits body"
"oof, that's hit cleanly and powerfully. Obed McCoy lines up an overpitched Thisara delivery and sends it sailign high over wide long off for six"
"length ball pitching outside off stump, swiped across the line to deep midwicket, for two"
"McCoy is not letting this match go. Thisara pitches this offcutter slightly short, and McCoy rocks back to slam that over wide long on for six."
goes full and gets punished through the offside now. That's pitched just outside off and Obed clears the front leg and creams this along the ground through cover point for four
"another four, and this time it's some terrible fielding that allows it. Another fullish ball that McCoy smokes to long off, where Ashen Bandara should have cut it off, but lets it slip through his fingers and into the boundary"
"another powerful shot to long off, but Bandara manages to make the stop this time. McCoy's on strike next over though"
"gets him first ball. This is fired in flat again, and slides on with the arm. Obed comes down the track but doesn't get anywhere near the pitch of the ball. He swings hard across the line, but the ball stays low and on course for the off stump, which it rattles."
"tossed up, pitching on off and straightening. Defended by Fidel"
"this is a full toss at about shin-height, which Fidel bashes to long off without a lot of power"
"a fantastic outfield catch to finish off. This is the googly from Sandakan, who pitches it a bit short as he bowls flat. Sinclair gets low and tries to sweep this for six against the turn, but can't get a lot of elevation. Pathum Nissanka at deep square leg runs across to take an excellent catch above his head, giving Sandakan his third"
