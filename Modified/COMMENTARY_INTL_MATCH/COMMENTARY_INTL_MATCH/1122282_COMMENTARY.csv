"good start from Morkel, 134 kph on a length outside off, in the channel. Rohit lifts his hands and lets the ball go."
"a full delivery outside off, 139 kph, Rohit gets forward and defends towards point."
"strays on the pads and Rohit does what he couldn't do in the previous game, open his account. A flick to fine leg for a run"
"full and wide, asking Dhawan to drive. He says why not. A big, loose drive and the extra bounce takes the ball over the bat."
"well bowled again, back of a length on the ribs. Dhawan gets on top of the bounce and works the ball to square leg"
"short and wide, too wide for ODI legality and the umpire punishes him"
"another loose drive from Dhawan. A full delivery outside off, the ball pitches and seams back in to sneak between bat and pad. Misses off stump by not much. A fantastic start from Morkel"
"short and wide outside off, left alone."
"good length delivery outside off, a more decisive leave from Rohit on that occasion."
"and again. Lovely channels outside off, pitches and moves away. Rohit gets forward and lets the ball go through"
"and again. Back of a length outside off, he's sticking it in that channel. No stroke as Rohit lifts his hands and lets the ball go"
"that's too wide, full and wide again, gets a hint of away swing, leaves the batsman, who leaves the ball."
"overpitched, a low full toss from Rabada, full and wide. Rohit presses forward, meets the full toss under his eyes and just times the stroke through cover for four. Well played"
"good end. On a length outside off, left alone watchfully"
"back of a length on middle and leg, 136 kph, Dhawan gets on top of the bounce and plays it towards square leg with soft hands."
"short and wide outside off, slashed to short point. Hit into the surface, got over the bounce"
"Morkel is not happy it's called a wide. Back of a length down leg, Dhawan gets across, tries to go from bottom to top to get underneath the ball and hit it for six, but he makes no contact. Wide though"
"shortish and wide again, that's decent field placement, but that's not an area you want to bowl at Dhawan. Cut to backward point"
"full and wide outside off, 138 kph, Dhawan shuffles across again slightly and drills a drive to cover. Some pressure on Dhawan as he isn't able to hit a gap"
"140 kph, that pressure is released with that. Overpitched around off, Dhawan drills a drive, straight drive, full face of the bat. Delectable stroke-making."
"on the pads slightly, 137 kph, beats Dhawan for pace, as he looks to flick, off the pad towards square leg for a leg bye"
"past mid-off again, a couple. Full delivery around off, Dhawan just gets forward and punches a drive on the up. Not great timing."
"a good length delivery down leg, worked to square leg, who runs around to his left, picks up does Ngidi and hits the stumps at the batsman's end, but Rohit is fine. The ball ricochets away for four overthrows so five"
"beauty! Some seam movement. Full delivery around off, the ball bounces a touch extra and leaves Rohit, hit on the back pad as he misses a flick"
"nicely bowled and played. Very similar to the previous delivery, full and straight, but instead of flicking like the previous delivery, he brings out a solid full face to defend"
"145 kph, full and wide outside off, Rohit gets forward and drives, the ball hits the inside half and back to the bowler"
"taken by Rabada? He certainly thinks so. For a fast bowler, that's a terrific effort. There is some extra bounce in this surface, so the ball pops up and hits Rohit's splice, the ball is hit back to Rabada because Rohit chose a full face, as opposed to a flick or a slightly open-faced drive. Rabada keeps his eyes on it, gets low and takes a clean catch inches away from the ground. Got his fingers underneath the ball. He judged the pace of the ball off the bat so well, and many fast bowlers struggle to do that. But Rabada is a terrific athlete. Makes a tough catch look incredibly easy"
"on the pads and Dhawan clips the ball through backward square leg for a couple. Nicely played, waited for the ball to come to him"
"a loud call of no from Kohli. Full delivery outside off, defended to mid-off. No run there, good call"
"inside-edged past the stumps for four. Back of a length, in that channel just outside off. Dhawan plays the wrong shot, trying to cut the ball down to third man, but it's too close to be playing that shot. A thick inside edge just evades the stumps"
"good length outside off, fourth, maybe fifth-stump line, defended to point"
"full and straight, defended back watchfully. Playing the ball discernibly late."
"good comeback from Morkel, back of a length outside off, tapped towards point. Came back well in that over, pretty good channels"
"full and straight, that's not a bad option to Kohli first ball at all. He has fallen over them already this tour. Worked to wide mid-on for a run"
"on the pads, and flicked away through backward square leg for a couple more. Beautifully played, he is looking really good on that flick"
"back of a length outside off, fourth-stump line, left alone well"
"back of a length around off, a thick inside edge towards fine leg for one."
"full and wide outside off, 144 kph, Kohli is not lulled into a drive, left alone nicely"
"full around off, Kohli is right behind the line to defend"
"picks the length early, stays back and pulls imperiously. Back of a length on middle and leg, Dhawan gets back and nails a pull over square leg. It's a similar shot, to the one he got out to Dale Steyn in the first Test in Cape Town. But he nails this one"
"back of a length around off, defended back watchfully"
"back of a length on off, not short enough so he flicks to square leg, instead of attempting a pull."
"back of a length down leg, worked to fine leg for a run"
"back of a length delivery outside off, it's a needless waft away from the body, but can anything get past that defense? Not now. Hit to point"
"full and wide outside off, asks Kohli to drive. Not yet."
"good single. Full and straight, punched towards wide mid-on for a single. The fielder has to run around the ball to pick it up with his throwing hand. So the run is easily made"
"over third slip for four. 141 kph, back of a length outside off, the ball bounces and moves away. A thick outside edge from Kohli, races away past the second slip. Kohli went at that again."
"full and straight, right behind the line of that to defend"
"in the Kohli hitting arc and boom, through square leg. It's not a bad ball at all, around off, Kohli walks across and just times the flick with so much ease. Shot!"
"full delivery outside off, defended to mid-off, followed by a loud call of no"
"more runs. Two more. Full and straight, Kohli just hits that with a straight bat, past mid-on for a couple more. AB de Villiers hunts it down to keep them to two"
"full and straight, squeezed via the inside edge for a run through square leg"
"a good single, full around middle and leg, pushed towards mid-on for one. A misfield from de Villiers, but no damage done."
"strays on the pads, flicked away down to fine leg for a single"
"good length outside off, just outside the tramline and called a wide."
"good length outside off, just inside the tramline this time. Close to a wide, Morkel asking Kohli to flirt with those."
"a good length delivery around off, worked away to square leg"
"back of a length delivery outside off, defended to point to end a decent over"
"another short delivery on middle and leg, pulled down to fine leg for a run. Helped it along fine. Didn't over-hit."
"good length delivery outside off, left alone this time"
"back of a length delivery around off, Kohli watches the ball onto the bat as he defends"
"good length delivery around off, tapped into the off side, towards point"
"slightly leg side-ish and that's enough for Kohli to flick through square leg for a couple. Very well run, as usual."
"143 kph, full around off, Kohli gets forward and drives the ball right back at Rabada. Very broad full face of the bat"
"very close to off stump. It's somewhat of an angled bat from Dhawan, the ball takes the inside edge and just beats leg stump. Phew, somehow it missed again."
"back of a length on middle and leg, worked away to square leg, at 138 kph"
"full delivery outside off, Kohli gets forward and defends to mid-off"
"full delivery around off, the ball seams back in, and the ball shovels to mid-on. He wanted to hit that much straighter"
"full outside off, driven to mid-off"
"just wide of point. Good length delivery outside off, the ball bounces extra and hits the splice again. One to the sweeper cover"
"a good length delivery outside off, 135 kph, tapped towards point. Kohli wants one, Dhawan rightly sends him back. No run there"
"excellent line, some pressure on Kohli. Just outside off, pushed towards mid-on. He is 15 off 25. Lots of time, but he doesn't like dots much, so this will frustrate him"
"full delivery outside off, a thick outside edge down to third man for one"
"a very loose stroke again. 137 kph, full delivery outside off, driven to mid-off. The bat wellll away from the pad."
"well bowled again. Sees Dhawan coming and he shortens the length slightly, just around off, carved to point"
"excellent end to the over. 136 kph, full delivery around middle and leg, driven to mid-on"
"on the pads, worked away to square leg for nothing. Another dot. Kohli won't be flustered, but he won't like this either"
"punches on the up to the sweeper cover. Full outside off, wouldn't normally use that force so early in his innings"
a thick outside edge to third man. Dhawan's first run on the off side anywhere other than mid-off. Tells you the clear plans South Africa have had for him.
"full on middle and leg, worked to de Villiers at mid-on, who is quick on the ball and releases even quicker. One of the quickest releases in world cricket"
"good length outside off, Kohli opens the bat face and carves the ball down to third man"
"full delivery outside off, the ball pitches and seams away to beat the bat. A terrific spell of cricket for SA after the end of the 9th over"
"back of a length outside off, tapped to point, who is in. Duminy runs in and misses the stumps at the batsman's end. <strong>Out with a direct hit</strong>."
"back of a length around off, sits up for Dhawan to pull over midwicket for four. Picks the length early, goes back and smashes the ball in front of square leg"
"short and wide, right in the slot for a hard cut. But the ball goes past the cut."
"in the gap for four. Back of a length down leg, pulled into the gap again. Behind square for four. Right in the gap."
"a low full toss outside off, driven to cover"
"short and wide again, 134 kph, Dhawan misses another cut. Extra bounce in this surface"
"back of a length around off, worked away towards midwicket."
"walks across, picks the full delivery and shovels an on-drive into the gap at mid-on. Superb gap finding. A premeditated shot."
"back of a length down leg, flicked to deep square leg for a run"
"full and straight, hit back hard towards the bowler, who ricochets it away towards mid-off. The parry allowed one"
"good length delivery outside off, Kohli walks across and dabs one down to third man for a run"
"full and wide, Dhawan gets across, looking to hit the ball hard through mid-off, but the ball takes the inside edge. Klaasen dives to his right to save two. Good stop"
"bounce again. Back of a length outside off, seams away and beats the bat. Beauty from Morris"
"short and wide outside off, slashed to point. Duminy dives to his left to save three. Parries it away to the sweeper cover"
"full on middle and leg, Kohli gets right across, misses a flick, the ball hits the pad en route to square leg. A leg bye. An optimistic appeal, maybe hit him too high. He was charging down too"
"140 kph, good length delivery around off, pushed away towards point, who dives to his left"
"terrific bowling, close to off, on a length, 133 kph. Not much Dhawan can do but defend."
"back of a length around off, played away towards point. Kohli says no to the possible run. Duminy is in to save that run."
strides down the pitch as if he owns it and blocks the good length ball to cover
"the drive comes out, looking to beat point to his right, but Duminy has been excellent in that region"
"that's outrageous! Rarely did he hit the ball in the air in his two hundreds on this tour until he knew his team was in a dominant position. Here, he's still in his 20s but walks down the pitch and launches a length ball straight down the ground. Monstrous hit"
works it away to deep square leg
"shimmies across, ensures he gets his hands up high enough to get on top of a short ball outside off stump and bunts it through midwicket"
nudges it away off his pads to midwicket
"a short-arm pull from Dhawan, the front leg coming up off the pitch, indicating he is cramped."
allows the ball to come in with the angle and deflect it away to long leg
"lifts it over cover. Dhawan's been starved of runs on the off side and the moment he sees a full ball giving him room to free the arms, he goes after it. Mistimed but he still manages to beat the dive from the fielder"
"<b>beats him</b> with the full delivery, darting past the outside edge. Dhawan is drawn into a drive and is done by the seam movement"
<b>outside edge</b> as Morris plies the left-hander with deliveries going across him. Races away to third man
"climbs steeply on Kohli on off stump, and having been set up for the dab to third man, he has to prioritise keeping the ball down rather than looking for runs."
"<b>massive lbw appeal</b> but the umpire is unmoved. Could have pitched outside leg, and an inside edge as well. Dhawan continues to face bowing meant to take the off side out of play as even the allrounder pitches it up on and gets it to seam into the left-hander"
"whips it away to long leg to bring up <b>a hard-working fifty on his 100th ODI</b>. He's been beaten on both edges, but he's also persevered, finding runs with emphatic pull shots"
closes the face as he clips a fullish delivery on leg stump through midwicket
"fullish and outside off, Kohli throws himself into the cover drive and has to check his stroke because there isn't enough pace"
keeps his shape as he eases the good length ball outside off through the covers. Excellent judgment of line and length
"<b>launches it over square leg</b>. It's not often the highlight of his cricket, but here he is forced to bring out such shots. Thunders down the pitch to take a length ball on leg stump and Jayasuriya's (flicks majestically) it over the boundary. Splendid cricket."
"there's no one in the deep at long-on and so Kohli goes over the top again!  Steps out of his crease, doesn't care that he has to take the ball on the up, he trusts those wrists to put power on the shot and they do."
"clips a back of a length delivery from outside off to square leg. He's getting annoyed at his partner for not responding to his calls. But honestly, there is no single there"
"shortish and outside off, dabs to short third man"
"looks for the pull, but Morris generates that little bit of extra bounce to defeat Kohli. Good line too, only a shade outside off, not allowing the right-hander too much room"
on the pads and Kohli tickles it to long leg
"spirits it away to the midwicket boundary. Dhawan is putting on a show! These are the shots his captain plays, the whip of his wrists so loud and so devastating that it leaves the entire world open-mouthed, not least the bowler."
down the pitch for a tap to long-on
mistimes the pull because Phehlukwayo doesn't offer Dhawan any pace to work with. Manages to sneak it past Morris at square leg though
"full, outside off, and rather slow as well. Dhawan lashes it to long-off"
"swats it out of his eyeline to deep midwicket. The short ball is a decent surprise option if he can get it that high, without giving too much room. <b>That's the 100 partnership though</b>"
waits until the good length ball is right under his eyes and works it away through midwicket
"back of a length on off stump, chops it to the left of extra cover"
"'push, push, push,' Kohli screams after hitting the ball on middle and off stump quite delectably through midwicket. Two taken, easily"
"<b>third fifty-plus score in his last four ODIs</b>, and this one's deviated from the template. There's a lot more hitting over the top, like this ball, on a length, outside off, walloped over mid-off"
"<b>dropped</B> and he's clutching his lower back as well! Morne gets up though and returns to the top of his mark, wishing he was a few inches taller. What an effort from the fast bowler, first to lure a false shot from an in-form Kohli, the extra bounce undoing the flick through midwicket. Morkel sizes up the leading edge, rushes to his right, against his followthrough, flies in the air to try and get under the ball but just can't get it"
runs it to that wide slip
lets the short and wide delivery arrive a little closer to him so he can control the glide to third man better
chops it to point as a packed Bull Ring gets behind its team. That effort from Morkel has woken them up
steps out of his crease for a push to cover
"seems to <b>keep a bit low</B> but Kohli is somehow in position to stab a straight bat down on it, and has the presence of mind to pinch a single to the left of midwicket too"
"premeditates a heave to square leg, walking across his stumps to scoop the ball away, but the lack of pace beats him."
<b>delicious batting</b>. He spots the back of a length delivery outside off. He knows third man is up. He knows the keeper is up as well. So he dials up the perfect little late cut
slogs all across the line and gets a leading edge that bounds away to the third man boundary. He's been pretty lucky today
hits on the up through cover
runs the shortish delivery to point
"steps across his crease, stares unfazed against the short ball and pulls it to deep square leg"
"<b>outside edge</b> but it splits the gap between keeper and wide slip. He's been brought back specifically to get a wicket and he's created two chances in two overs. This one, though, Kohli mitigates by playing with soft hands and keeping the nick down"
opens the face and steers the short ball outside off to third man
cramps him for room and Dhawan looks for a quick single after blocking down the pitch. Nothing there
tucks it off his hips to long leg
starts around the wicket as he lobs it up on middle and leg. Dhawan spears it out to deep midwicket
"stays back to a good length ball - he does that so well, trusting his hands to adjust to the turn even when its sharp. Single to long-on"
plenty of flight outside off but Dhawan keeps his head and drives all along the ground to sweeper cover
leans over the tossed up ball on off stump and nonchalantly taps it to long-on
rocks back against a short ball on middle and leg and hammers it down to long-on
collision between Duminy and Dhawan as the bowler moves to his right to field a bottom handed bludgeon from Kohli
"fullish and outside off, drives firmly to mid-off"
"back of a length on middle, turns it away to midwicket"
"<b>beats him</b> on the pull as he gets good height on the bouncer. The line is brilliant as well, asking Kohli to yank the ball from his right shoulder"
"gets off his feet so he can plant the face of the bat down on a short delivery, meant to cramp him, and pinches a single before short cover can take any part. Kohli touches down looking for an overthrow, but Dhawan has his back turned and that doesn't please the Indian captain at all"
"cuts fiercely and benefits by a misfield at deep third man. He gets two hands to the ball, but ends up diving over it, giving himself no insurance if he mucks up the stop. Perhaps he thought the rope is inches away and he shouldn't have his legs on the ground"
"bangs it in down leg. Dhawan misses, but India still profit"
deflects it away to long leg and India have another eight-run over
"tosses it up on middle, Dhawan drills it to the left of extra cover but the captain Markram puts in a timely dive"
strides out of his crease for a push to long-off
"keeps back to a good length ball, waits until it is right under his eyes, whips it to the right of midwicket and finds a couple before the men in the deep can do much"
"<b>how about that?</b> The trademark Virat Kohli cover drive, where he collapses the back knee, stays beside the ball and swats it through the gap. Sweeper has too long a distance to cover to the right"
drives to long-off
<b>appeal for a caught behind</b> as Dhawan gets down on one knee and tries to slice the ball through third man. But he's hurried by the pace on the ball and is beaten
"thumps the short delivery to cover, getting across to the ball to stay in control of the stroke"
opens the face and steers the back of a length delivery to third man
"looks for the pull, but he has to fetch the ball from outside off and that adds to the risk in the shot. He ends up being beaten for bounce."
"it's the slower yorker, pitching on middle stump. Dhawan tries to get just enough of a tickle on it to beat the keeper. But it ends up going far too fine"
"fishes at a back of a length ball going across him and is left behind by the pace, bounce and seam movement. Weird shot for a man in such form"
"short ball on leg stump, Dhawan swivels on the back foot and pummels it to long leg. That's better. That's in perfect control"
"shortish and outside off, goes for the cut and is beaten"
"full and outside off, he advances down the pitch and hits sweetly to long-off"
"good fielding from the bowler, diving to his left to stop a forceful push intended for long-off"
brings down a straight bat to slam an overpitched delivery past extra cover's right to bring up the <b>150-run partnership</b>
"full on off stump, Dhawan eases it to extra cover"
"fires it in on leg stump and Dhawan, in his attempt to get across and glance it away, is beaten"
gets right over the short ball outside off and spears it to the sweeper
slashes outside off but Ngidi's extra bounce is too much for Dhawan again
nice and tight on off stump and Dhawan can only defend.
"hits down the ground, but there isn't enough timing on the shot because the ball is ever so full. Dhawan is basically digging it out of the blockhole"
"bottom-hand comes to play as Kohli heaves the slower ball to the left of mid-on, but de Villiers gets across in time"
"back of a length and outside off, runs it down to third man"
gets too close to the ball as he charges out of his crease and ends up heaving it back to the bowler
"this time he keeps back, expecting a shorter length, and dabs it to the left of short third man"
full-blooded drive to long-off as Dhawan sashays down the pitch
"swats the ball to long-on, even though he ends up <i>way</i> too close to the ball. Shows how good his bottom-hand is, getting so much power into the shot, and beating a silly mid-on to get the runs too"
"shapes to sweep, but the flighted delivery dips on Dhawan, forcing him to bring out a straighter bat and run it to point"
flicks a flatter delivery on off stump to deep midwicket
"caught at cover! The flay often works for Kohli, even when he tries to hit on the up, especially when he has so much room. But Morris, the fresh bowler, has a little more gas to hit the deck and get the extra bounce to knock over the India captain."
"full and wide, the ball seaming back in, Rahane lets this one through to the keeper"
"goes short, the bouncer on leg, Rahane pulls to fine leg.'A few bumpers here,' is the call from one of South Africa's close-in fielders"
"back of a length on middle, flicked away to deep midwicket"
"short again, around off, pulled to square leg"
"good end, full and straight, hit back towards Morris. Another very good over"
"back of a length around off, some extra bounce as he looks to flick into the leg side, off the splice to cover"
"139 kph, out with a direct hit? Full and straight, hit back to the bowler, who parries it away towards mid-on. Markram misses at the bowler's end."
"seams back in, cuts Dhawan in half as he looks to cut to third man. There was a noise as the ball passed bat"
"on the pads, and Dhawan picks it off with nonchalant ease. What a shot. On the pads, and Dhawan whips it but extends the flick. Way over square leg"
"on middle and leg, worked away to square leg"
"moves to 99! Good length delivery outside off, inside-edged into the pad for a single. Good response from Rahane too."
"and he gets there! Dhawan makes <b>100 in his 100th ODI</b>. What an effort that has been. A low full toss around off, Dhawan drills the drive past his partner. It beats mid-off too, and it carries to the boundary. The helmet is off, and the celebrations are out"
"short down leg, pulled to fine leg for a run. Hurried for pace on that"
"flicked away for four. 141 kph, full on middle and leg, Rahane just whips this off his pads, way over midwicket. Too easy. The field is in to add some pressure, so he goes over them all"
"full on middle and leg, pushed away towards mid-on"
"short and wide from Morris this time, too wide for legality and called"
"141 kph, big appeal. No says the umpire. Klaasen thought there was an inside edge, nothing from the captain either. A full delivery cut back in, and beat Rahane on the inside edge. No bat. May have clipped the back pad"
"a full delivery outside off, hit away to mid-on"
"somehow Ngidi manages to stop that. A short delivery down leg, Dhawan pulls behind square, Ngidi runs around to his right and pulls it in. Did well on the boundary"
"144 kph, full down leg, driven to mid-on. India get to 200"
"back of a length but down leg, wide called"
"good length delivery outside off, tapped with the open face towards backward point"
"a good short delivery, 137 kph, but too high says the leg umpire. Over the head, so another wide"
"back of a length down leg, pulled away to fine leg. On the bounce. Went from bottom to top, and tried to hit the gap at backward square leg"
"back of a length outside off, a thick inside edge past the stumps for a couple to fine leg. Again, misses the stumps"
"full delivery outside off, 138 kph, angling away, defended to point"
"good length delivery around off, worked away to midwicket"
"back of a length outside off, 137 kph, Rahane opens the bat face and guides it down to third man for a single"
"hit straight to de Villiers at mid-off. The break works for SA. A full delivery outside off, Dhawan looks to hit the ball over mid-off, but doesn't get anywhere near enough bat on it. All he can do it hit it low to de Villiers, who watches the ball into his hands, a good two-handed catch! It's the momentum that was lost, now Dhawan loses his wicket"
"<strong>snorter of a ball first up to Iyer! </strong>Back of a length around off, the ball climbs extra, takes the shoulder of the bat and lobs past slip. One to third man."
"good length delivery outside off, 140 kph, carved down to third man for a run"
"good length delivery outside off, an outside edge down to third man. Off the outside half actually."
"on middle and leg, worked to deep square leg"
"good stop. Back of a length outside off, maybe even short and wide. Hit to backward point, where Duminy dives to his left to save some run"
"SA bouncing back very quickly after the break. It's another wicket, as Rahane holes out to deep square leg. Ngidi digs this one in again, around middle and leg. Rahane feels obliged to keep the run-rate high, but has to play a low-percentage, high-risk shot: the pull when the ball is climbing quite a bit and he isn't quite set. He can't time it, and the ball picks out the fielder."
"full delivery around off, pushed back to the bowler. A crowd catch as Ngidi fields. <b>The Wanderers is buzzing now</b>."
"dug in, Dhoni rolls his wrists over the ball and pulls to deep square leg for one"
"short delivery outside off, Iyer tries to ramp the ball over the slip fielder but can't make contact. I don't think either party would mind if he gets bat on that, a wicket-taking opportunity"
"good length delivery outside off, Dhoni walks across and lets the ball go."
"goes reaching for it and gets sooo much on it that it clears deep cover. Short and wide outside off, Dhoni reaches out and slashes it towards the sweeper cover, who is right on the boundary. Dives and the ball evades him as he falls over the boundary. Don't think that's what Dhoni wanted."
"on middle and leg, clipped down to fine leg for a run"
"four more. 137 kph, goes full outside off, driven past AB to his left. Markram doesn't give up on it, goes chasing but the ball makes it to the boundary"
"shortish, back of a length outside off. Iyer gives himself some room, looking to use that pace to cut. But the ball bounces over. Dhoni has a chat with Iyer after that shot"
"full delivery, coming back in, a thick inside edge into the body. Evades the stumps"
Dhoni comes down and punches the ball to the sweeper cover.
"good length delivery outside off, hit towards point. Iyer wanted one, Dhoni screams no"

"136 kph, back of a length around off, nudged to deep square leg, one more, exactly what Dhoni wants"
"back of a length around off, 141 kph. Iyer is behind the line to defend"
"a well-directed bouncer around middle and leg,. 138 kph. Iyer takes his eyes off the ball, sways out of the line and then attempts a swish at the ball, he isn't anywhere close. A terrible stroke."
"136 kph, good length outside off, carved down to third man for a single"
"back of a length, but down leg. That may have been a wide on line, not height"
"back of a length on middle, worked to de Villiers at midwicket, who releases despite being off-balance while throwing, misses the stumps at the batsman's end"
"a slower ball around middle, clipped to de Villiers again, who hits the stumps this time and concedes an extra run as the ball ricochets away"
"and again, flicked to de Villiers at midwicket, who dives to his right and stops one. Dhoni called 'one, one'"
"back of a length outside off, 131 kph, Dhoni misses an upper cut."
"back of a length on leg, 127 kph, the ball seams back in and hits Dhoni on the thigh pad."
"back of a length around off, 131 kph, off the splice of the bat towards cover. Good over from Phehlukwayo, accurate"
"another dab. Back of a length outside off, 138 kph, the ball seams in, Iyer arches his back and connects, one to third man"
"137 kph, another slower ball around off, clipped to midwicket."
"a leaden-footed drive to third man. Full and wide, Dhoni's balance is on the back foot, a thick outside edge races down to third man. Phehlukwayo puts in a long dive, but can't quite haul it in. Terrific effort though"
"<strong>just short of the bowler.</strong> Back of a length, at the body. Dhoni looks for one of those touch flicks to square leg, but the ball takes the leading edge and lands well short"
"good slower ball, may have been the legcutter at 118 kph, hit back to the bowler, deceived by that lack of pace"
"slightly short and Dhoni is all over it, picks the length, goes back and pulls to deep midwicket"
"another tidy delivery, legcutter outside off, Dhoni punches to cover. Should probably have hit a gap there"
"back of a length around off, clipped to square leg."
"good length delivery around off, pushed to mid-on."
"another wicket! <strong>But Iyer reviews right away</strong>. A back of a length delivery outside off, Iyer makes some room and tries to go over cover but the ball doesn't seam. I did hear a faint noise as ball passed bat. But there isn't much of a spike on UltraEdge. Nothing significant anyway, and that should mean the decision is overturned. Enough evidence, says the third umpire, so a good review."
"back of a length but well down leg, wide."
"looking to go through the off side but the ball holds its line, takes the inside half and trickles down to long-on"
"back of a length outside off, jammed back. Good end from the bowler."
"gets enough bat. Back of a length outside off, Iyer forces the ball over mid-off, knows the fielder is in so he just needs to clear that fielder"
"taken at long-on! Wasn't picking his deliveries to attack, but they may have decided that Iyer will try to attack every delivery, with Pandya still to come. So a length delivery, which is hard to hit over long-on, is mis-timed to the fielder. Not enough bat, not good timing and it all results in a simple catch off a wildly-exuberant heave"
"back of a length on the pads, 138 kph, worked to deep square leg"
"a slower ball outside off, worked to square leg, 117 kph. Cleverly bowled"
"good length delivery outside off, carved to point. Dot"
"good end to his spell, full outside off, hit to cover to end the over. 10 overs for 52, with two wickets. Decent returns"
"back of a length outside off, extra climb, extra bounce, extra pace. Dhoni is beaten. Lovely delivery"
"good length around off, nudged to square leg for a single"
"back of a length again, well outside off, but like Steven Smith, it appears closer to off because Pandya has shuffled right across. A thick outside edge down to third man"
"good length around off, Dhoni tries to twirl his stance and point of contact to get that ball to square leg, instead of midwicket, the ball rolls away to square leg via the body"
"a low full toss around off, clipped to mid-on, who picks up and releases very quickly, but the stumps are not hit."
"excellent over from Rabada. Full delivery outside off, the ball skews off via the outside half to point. India losing momentum as they look to set up the final launch"
"picks the length early and pulls away over midwicket for four! Back of a length, Pandya stands back and pulls imperiously. Pandya was waiting for that."
"well bowled, the yorker around off, squeezed away to midwicket"
"a slower ball outside off, pushed in front of point. No run again. Clever changes of pace from the SA bowlers"
"worked away down to fine leg, short but doesn't rise as much as Pandya expected"
"good length on off, nudged down to fine leg. Decent results these for SA"
"a full delivery goes past Pandya's mighty heave. To be fair, it was in the slot but Pandya was a touch too excited, swung too hard and didn't make any contact"
"a splendid yorker outside off, jammed out to midwicket. Not much more Dhoni could do with that one"
"a yorker outside off, squeezed down to third man for one more. Awesome bowling"
"change in length, goes short outside off, hurries Dhoni for pace, and the bounce takes the ball over the pull."
"a full delivery around off, clipped to midwicket."
"another good short ball, outside off. Pandya chooses the wrong shot, a pull, instead of a cut. Another dot. Can he finish well?"
"what a catch from Aiden Markram. Wowow. Stunner from the captain. And it's a big moment too, because it's Pandya. A full delivery outside off, Pandya is hurried for pace so he can't get a lot of power behind that, the ball lobs off the outside half towards cover. But it isn't over Markram, who times his jump to absolute perfection. At the highest point in his leap, he grasps the ball and holds on, with both feet well off the ground. A lot of things needed to go well for that catch to be taken and it was. STUNNER! Gasps from the crowd as the replays are shown. That good."
"back of a length around off, pulled to deep square leg"
"134 kph, fullish delivery around off, pushed back. Another dot."
"short and very high, over the head, and wide called."

"a full delivery around off, driven to long-on"
"shortish delivery on leg, clipped to square leg to retain strike"
"back of a length around off, swatted past midwicket for a couple. A forehand shot"
"back of a length on middle, Bhuvneshwar gives himself room, looking to guide the ball over point but the ball goes past. Dhoni comes down to have a chat"
"a full delivery outside off, carved away to the sweeper cover"
"the helicopter for two. Full around off, flicked away with immense bottom-handed power in the gap at midwicket"
"just wide of Klaasen for four. Short delivery down leg, Dhoni can't make contact with a pull, the ball ricochets off the helmet, past Klaasen's fingertips for four leg byes"
"hurries Dhoni again, but just one. Back of a length down leg, off the glove to fine leg. Finishes by conceding just 25 runs in his last five overs."
"full and wide outside off, in the slot and Dhoni nails his cover drive with fierce power. No chance for the fielders"
"how's that, asks Morris? The umpires have a chat and will ask the third umpire to decide. <strong>Soft signal is not out</strong>. A well-executed yorker around off, Dhoni jams the heave into his boot, and then up to the bowler, who takes the catch. But the ball has hit the ground before hitting the shoe, so not out."
"a low full toss around off, skewed away to long-on. Duminy is quick on it, returns the throw to the bowler who takes the bails off to complete the run-out. Well executed from SA. Dhoni back on strike though"
"short and wide, he knows the areas so Dhoni cuts that through point for four. Very cleverly done, this is as Dhoni a territory as you'd find in ODIs"
"superb cricket. A lovely yorker down leg, Dhoni helicopters it away past square leg, all with the bottom hand. De Villiers runs to his right, stops the boundary and almost prevents Dhoni from two. Exceptional fielding."
"full and wide outside off, drilled to cover for a run."
"full and wide outside off, the ball swings away. Markram gets forward and lets it go"
"closer to off, on a length outside off, guided away to third man for a single"
"good length delivery, wide outside off, Amla shuffles across and lets that one go"
"brings that one back, on a length around off, worked to fine leg for a run. A piece of wood <strong>comes off Amla's bat</strong>, he'll need a new one."
"a bit wide and Markram leans into that. Back of a length outside off, Markram stays back and caresses his drive through cover with so much ease."
"good length and wide outside off, the ball swings away and Markram lets it go"
"good length outside off, Amla opens the bat face and guides one down to third man"
"good length outside off, carved to point."
"back of a length outside off, Markram caresses his drive to point from the back foot"
"good length delivery outside off, hit away towards point"
"a thick outside edge, but wide of slip for four. Back of a length outside off, Markram opens the bat face and taps it past the wide slip. A mixture of outside edge and outside half"
"full on leg, Markram misses out on some runs as the ball flicks the pad en route to square leg"
"wide outside off, Markram flays at that and caresses the ball towards extra cover. Iyer dives to his left to save three"
"just timing. Good length outside off, he opens the bat face and carves the ball past point for a couple. All placement"
"back of a length outside off, the ball bounces extra as Amla misses a punchy cut. Goes past the edge."
"the edge, but wide of slip again, four again. Good length delivery outside off, the ball pitches, moves away, takes the outside edge and flies past slip. That's a good delivery, very probing. Wider than usual, but it's very good because of Amla's already pronounced shuffle"
"and thereabouts again. Good length outside off, tapped towards point"
"a full delivery outside off, driven to mid-off with the full face"
"good length delivery outside off, Markram solidly behind the line to defend"
"around off, on a length, behind the line again to defend"
"overpitched outside off, Markram leans forward and drills a drive to cover. Doesn't need to bother much about swing, more seam."
"nicely played, around middle and leg, Markram chips the ball over mid-on. Just enough bat on a mis-timed stroke. And the ball stops itself juuust before the boundary. Three."
"good length delivery on a fourth-stump channel, Amla has walked right across, misses a flick."
defended watchfully under his eyes
"well bowled, on a length outside off, a thick outside edge beats the diving slip fielder. The third man is up, so another edge results in another boundary. Feels like India are under real pressure for the first time this series"
"short and wide this time, Markram slaps a cut to the sweeper cover, 137 kph"
a manufactured run. Gets right across and flicks an off-stump ball towards fine leg for one
"good single, full outside off, hit to mid-off, and Markram calls Amla through even with Kohli on the ball. Quality single"
"full delivery outside off, Amla slices that towards point. Didn't expect that line. Well bowled"
"another good single, short and wide outside off, chopped away to point. Pandya is on the circle so the single is easily made"
"good length outside off, a thick inside edge into the back thigh as Markram looks to drive"
"uhuhuh, that's awesome. Back of a length outside off, Amla stands tall and punches the ball through cover point. He has placed that by opening the bat face depending on the gap he wanted to find"
"full delivery outside off, seam movement, defended back"
"good lines from Bumrah, in a channel just outside off, defended into the mid-off region"
"closer to off this time, 141 kph, Amla is behind the line as he blocks"
"a thick inside edge down to fine leg for a single. Keeping it in that channel, a lovely over"
"good length around off, some lateral movement, the ball ducks back in, beats Amla on the inside edge and hits him on the back pad. One leg bye"
"full delivery outside off, the ball seams back in, takes the inside half towards midwicket"
"full delivery outside off, seemed like he misread the length of that, wanted to pull but the ball wasn't short, so he cut to the sweeper cover"
"good length outside off, some extra bounce again, off the shoulder to point."
"excellently bowled, the one that is full and is looking to beat the inside edge and hit Amla on the front pad, but his bat is in line to defend"
"shortish and wide outside off, hit past point for four, just placed again. Waits for the ball, and then open the bat face accordingly. Sublime batting"
"full delivery outside off, the ball moves back in, hit back to the bowler"
"given by the umpire. Has a chat with Amla does Markram. And Amla calls for the review for his partner. What happened there? Looked like he misread the length again, looking to pull, but the ball is much fuller than he anticipated. In the end, all he can do is attempt a hopeless swat across the line. Hits Markram on the back leg, plumb in front of off. <strong>Three reds on HawkEye</strong>, SA lose their review."
"<b>fumble</b> at cover, with the ball coming straight at him, allows Duminy to get off the mark straight away"
"<b>huge appeal for caught behind</b> as the good length indipper cuts through Amla, but it's beaten the inside edge and clips the back pad through to Dhoni. The batsman was rather late in playing a shot there"
"shuffles across to perhaps counter Bumrah's steep angle into him, but a bit of extra bounce has the ball striking Amla's body"
"tries to tap it into the covers for a quick single, but Duminy knows the infield there is a bit too packed"
loops it up outside off at 78 kph and Duminy hits it to cover
"75kph, lunges, trying desperately to get to the pitch of a tossed up legbreak outside off, and drives through cover"
shifts deep in his crease to consign a terrible delivery - flat and way down leg - to long leg
"steps out of his crease, but Kuldeep manages to get the ball to dip on Amla and forces him to block. Even then the turn beats the inside edge and strikes his pad"
goes back - reading the length to be shortish - and therefore is able to adjust to the googly off the pitch
strides forward to block a flighted delivery outside off
bangs it into the middle of the deck and it soars harmlessly to the keeper.
"lovely shot, getting up high with the short ball on middle stump and deftly slanting it away to deep third man"
runs the back of a length delivery to the left of point for a quick single. <b>That brings up South Africa's 50</b>. Only 152 more needed.
"good length ball on off stump at 138 kph, Duminy defends"
"141kph, lets the short one come on and steers it to deep third man"
"spears it through the covers, angling the face of the bat to to beat Iyer placed close in"
leaps back and across outside off - as he did at this venue in the Test match - and is beaten on the cut by extra pace and bounce from Pandya
"lobs it up there for the drive and Duminy obliges, hitting to long-off"
"loads of turn as he tosses it up on off stump. Amla presses forward, trying to get to the pitch of it, but isn't successful and so settles for a single off the inside edge to square leg"
"quicker through the air, which makes Duminy want to play back. But the length is still full and if not for that straight bat coming down in time, he might have been lbw"
"gets down the track, but Kuldeep pulls his length back and lines the ball on leg stump, cramping Duminy"
nudges it off his legs to backwards square leg
"79kph, hangs back to a good length ball outside off and slaps it to long-off"
<b>past the edge</b> as Amla attempts a cut and is surprised by a lot of extra bounce
"<b>inside edge</b> as Amla is rooted to the crease, attempting to punch a 143 kph delivery, shortish in length, through cover. There is however not enough room for that"
waits for the short ball to nearly pass him before flaying it to deep third man. Think he was looking to place it a little to the fielder's left to get the boundary
that's majestic! The pitched up ball - often the exception in Pandya's spells - is read very early and launched over extra cover.
shuffles across and sends a good length ball on off stump through to deep midwicket
"bouncer on middle and leg and Duminy hooks it down to long leg, controlling the shot with his wrists, keeping the ball down and timing it so well"
"that's nicely played - picks up on the short ball early, gets back in his crease, plays late and finds a couple behind point"
"<b>hits him on the half-volley as he charges out of his crease and it's given lbw</b>! Duminy is not happy, but South Africa don't have any more reviews to use. Big, big call from the umpire Jele considering the batsman had covered a good distance of the pitch before he is deceived by Kuldeep's drift and dip, making him play all across the line. <b>HawkEye says umpire's call on impact</b>, considering it was made 3m down the pitch"
"quicker delivery on off stump, to which AB plays back and his quick hands help him make contact"
presses forward to block and an inside edge helps him get off the mark. Two to long leg
comes forward to defend a quicker delivery that dips sharply
rolls his wrists onto a full delivery on middle to try and pinch a single to square leg. But AB says no having seen Dhoni race off after it
"140 kph, good length, very wide outside off though. AB tries to catch up with it - no feet though - and is beaten"
"full on off stump, AB blocks"
"short and angling down leg, AB sets up for the pull to the short boundary right behind him, but mistimes the ball"
"bottom edge races away to deep third man as, for once, Pandya's short ball skids through lower than the batsman expects"
"top work from Rahane at point, diving to his right and stopping a superbly timed slap off the back foot"
nails it! Pandya's penchant to bowl short means batsmen can size him up and AB is a spectacular one at that. Pulls off the front foot and heaves it to deep midwicket
"charges out of his crease for another slog to deep midwicket, but Pandya continues getting plenty of zip off this pitch and AB mistimes the shot to mid-on. Clear signs that the rain has made it quick up"
"sensational catch! At long-off, barely an inch away from the boundary line! Bhuvi, take a bow! For the longest time, Amla seems to have timed this outrageously well. It almost seems like he might only have been looking to chip it. But the ball carries all the way to long-off, where Bhuvneshwar tracks back, takes the catch over his head, worries he might overbalance so he tosses the ball back up, steadies himself and re-takes the catch. Splendid composure."
gives it a good rip and the ball pitches outside of and turns right past De Villiers and through to the keeper down leg
"gets the ball to drift outside off, AB tries to flick it through midwicket and gets a leading edge"
"takes a wild risk as he lunges forward, looking for a reverse swat. He's so off balance that he falls on his back side. Needless to say he mistimes the shot to short third man"
"tossed up on middle, AB turns it through square leg"
"targets middle, the drift leaving Miller in a difficult spot. Has to hurry to bring his bat around his front pad to save himself from the lbw"
"outstanding sweep shot - he gets so far forward with the front foot, making contact with the length ball (googly) with single-minded intent and hammering it away to the square leg boundary"
"shortish and outside off, AB cuts to sweeper cover"
goes back to a flatter delivery on middle and tucks it to deep square leg
backs away - which makes Chahal shift his line outside off - but AB is able to leap back in line and cut it to the sweeper
"launches it over long-on - there's a fielder there, but he's AB, and he knows he has the power to clear the ropes. Big, loopy delivery outside off. These are the very ones with which Chahal takes his wickets, making batsmen slog. AB goes for a similar shot, but with a timely delay of the swing and executes it perfectly"
hammers it again! This is what AB does. He makes the bowler second guess himself. The last one was a good ball sent packing. This is a long hop which he leaps back and pulls monstrously over deep midwicket
"short and spinning away, AB gets across to it and slaps the ball through the covers"
backs away from a short ball to try and pick the gap between backward point and short third man. Isn't quite able to
<B>beats the outside edge</b> with a good length ball that seams off the juiced-up track
slogs a short ball but in doing so a touch too late he mis-hits to short midwicket
swings a back of a length delivery out to deep midwicket
"taken at long leg! Pandya sets off on a sprint! He's broken the match wide open! It's not the prettiest dismissal - a length ball down leg, slugged away, looking for six again. But he only picks out Rohit Sharma to perfection. Is that the end of South Africa's chase?"
"a good length delivery outside off, a thick outside edge down to third man for a single. Klaasen is off and running"
"the flatter one, on middle and leg, worked to midwicket"
"short and wide outside off, carved to the sweeper cover"
"<strong>dropped</strong>! That was the game right there, flatter trajectory delivery around middle and off, a thick leading edge as Miller sweeps. Iyer runs to his right, gets there but the ball bounces off the wrists. Massive moment in the game"
"pushed through, flat and quick on leg, Klaasen is beaten for pace, hits the pad"
"another one, flat and quick down leg, another leading edge off the sweep but this lands safe. Over midwicket"
"excellently bowled by Chahal. The pace of this ball was discernibly slower, much slower through the air. Miller's quick through the sweep, because he has been forced to be quick through his sweeps because of Chahal's quicker pace. The ball drifts, dips and beats the wild slog. But has he overstepped? He indeed has. That is not done for a spinner. Awful and awesome in the same delivery from Chahal."
"the quicker one, flat on middle and leg. Miller swings it away to deep midwicket. The catch is taken, they complete the run."
"lovely hit from Miller. A full delivery outside off, in the slot and Miller lofts the ball over mid-off, an extension of a drive. Excellent shot"
"that's over point. Four more. Back of a length, slightly wide outside off, Miller gets underneath the length to go from bottom to top, ensuring the ball went over point. Very clever thinking."
"12 off the first three balls. 4, 4, 4. Back of a length outside off, angled across. Miller swats his pull into the gap at midwicket. Fantastic hitting this. Not over-hit, this is more the Miller way"
"lovely timing again, but not placement. A half-volley outside off, driven to mid-off with splendid timing. He calls through for a run"
"shortish length around middle and leg, pulled to midwicket after a forward charge."
"good use of that bouncer, around off and middle, hustles Klaasen as he looks to pull, but bails out. Excellent finish from Pandya"
"the googly down leg, worked to midwicket, 82 kph. Playing with the full face"
"slow through the air again, Miller goes through with a heave, looking for midwicket but the legspinner breaks between bat and pad. Good take from Dhoni"
"the quicker one, full down leg, reads the trajectory, flicked into the gap at midwicket."
"short and slow down leg, flicked away to deep square leg for a single."
"good execution. Full delivery, very quick around off. Klaasen brings out the cross-batted heave. The bat met the ball at an awkward angle but he would not care. Picks the gap at midwicket, fierce hit."
"short and wide outside off, slashed towards point for a run. Well played from Klaasen. 'Bahut badiya,' says Dhoni (very good)"
"nicely played from Klaasen. It's slightly short, Klaasen gets low and paddle laps it away through fine leg, the du Plessis way. Miller scampers back for three. Good connection from Klaasen, backing his game, not slogging."
"another sweep, some flight around off, swept to deep square leg"
"superb batting from Klaasen. Dhoni thought he'll play the same lap sweep but he hits it the other way, the reverse sweep, full around off, fantastic timing over point. Just inside the boundary too."
"looking for another one, the switch hit or the reverse sweep, it's flatter this time, he can't get the timing or the elevation, hit to third man"
"and then Miller goes wheee, right in his wheelhouse. Flat and quick, in the arc, and well, it's outttta here. Smashed over midwicket. The best a ball has been hit by a South African batsman this series. The sound of that bat, as sweet as you like. The Wanderers is buzzing."
"75 kph, a fumble from Kohli. Short and wide outside off, carved away to cover, where Kohli may have taken his eyes off the ball. One team is clearly feeling the pressure."
"quick down leg, clipped to square leg for one. Chants ring around the Wanderers, it's the loudest they've been righ through this tour."
"very slow and wide outside off, Klaasen drills a drive to cover. Would have been wide had he left that. A lot about keeping your head in these situations"
"short and wide outside off, Klaasen stands his ground and looks to slap it over cover, but it's too wide, called"
"he has taken an off-side wide, got right across and pulled it over square leg. That's one way to play wristspin. It almost didn't land on the pitch, Klaasen kept going and going to try to meet the ball. Somehow, he did. He picked his area way before the ball was actually released."
"that is not good from Chahal. Lots of flight outside off, the ball spins and beats Klaasen's drive. But it's another no-ball, oversteps. <strong>Wristspin now under pressure</strong> from the South African bat"
"out of here. Goes quick, flat outside off, Klaasen gets underneath it and sends it a million miles away, sensational connection and way over long-on. That is massive. Just too quick. Chahal handicapped himself there"
"short and very wide outside off, Klaasen gets right across and slices to deep cover. Could have let that one go and earned a wide"
that spins down leg for a wide. Very slow through the air again and an extra
"slow through the air around off, clipped towards midwicket. 15 runs off that over, a huge over in the context of this series."
"good length outside off, Klaasen cuts the ball down to third man. Kuldeep gets across to his right, stumbles, fumbles and lets the ball through to the third man boundary. Sensational, how quickly things turn around"
"honing in on off, a thick inside edge to square leg for a run. Well bowled, decently played too."
"a good length delivery around off, chopped to point."
"beautifully bowled, using the conditions, full outside off, beats Miller on the outside edge. Looking for an awkward dab to third man"
"good length delivery down leg, Miller misses a flick, struck on the thigh pad, one leg bye ensues"
"a wide yorker outside off to finish, inside-edged past the stumps for a run. Tidy comeback from Bumrah, but SA will take seven off that."
"nicely played, full outside off, worked to long-on. Not a big hit, just one. Impressive batting."
"Chahal goes short, and it's so slow that Miller rocks back, picks the length and says thank you very much. It ends up as a long-hop, Miller goes back and gives the ball a good smack, way over midwicket. Sweeeeet off the bat"
"79 kph, full on middle and leg, Miller looks for a big swing again, but the ball goes over the stumps."
"and given! Slow through the air around middle and leg, pitches in line, the ball spins back just a touch to beat Miller on the inside edge and hit Miller in front of leg. Absolutely plumb. His pad got right across, and he couldn't quite get the front pad out of the way as he tried to defend."
"83 kph, swept away to deep square leg for a run"
"flat around middle and leg, worked away to midwicket for one. Phehlukwayo wanted two, it's not on."
"77 kph, another boundary, some flight from Kuldeep, but it's short, giving Klaasen the time and the length to go back, take the ball off the stumps and slap over cover. Just inside the boundary. Stunning hit"
"some flight on middle and leg, driven to long-on, and somehow they race back for two. Amazing running"
"flat around off, 82 kph, clipped to midwicket"
"the wrong 'un, down leg, swept away to deep square leg, just the one."
"when things are going your way, it just goes your way. A short delivery outside off, Phehlukwayo shapes and executes a reverse-sweeps past short third man for four. Premeditated, but backing his instinct and his game."
"is that the game? Surely it is, some flight outside off, Phehlukwayo gets low, stays low and nails his slog sweep over midwicket. The thin Highveld air takes the ball soaring over midwicket for the game?"
"short outside off, pushed away to long-on for a single. Very very good game awareness from Klaasen, not to look for a big hit"
"that is surely it. 71 kph, slowed up from Chahal, much like he has been doing for three ODIs prior to today. But with all the confidence in the world, with the adrenaline, he runs down, meets the ball as it pitches and drills a drive right over the bowler's head. A massive hit"
"flat down leg, Phehlukwayo misses a lap sweep, called wide. <strong>The scores are level</strong>"
"all that adrenaline is still there, some flight around off, Phehlukwayo stays low and slog-sweeps the ball over midwicket for six. <b>South Africa's incredible run in pink continues. They keep the series alive with a stunning turnaround</b>"
