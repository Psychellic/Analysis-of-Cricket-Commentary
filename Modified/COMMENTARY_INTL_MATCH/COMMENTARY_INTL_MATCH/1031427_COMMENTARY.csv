tight line to launch proceedings. Roy comes half forward and squirts an uncertain edge out to point. Safe enough
"that's a good line, and a terrific length, outside off, lifting through to the keeper as Roy shoulders arms"
"more solidly onto the front foot this time, pushing hard down to mid-off"
"on the hip, and tucked firmly behind square to open England's account for the day"
"too full this time and that tremendously timed, off the toes and out through midwicket. The ball slows up as it approaches the rope but eludes a despairing dive"
"back on a better length, zipping into the keeper's gloves at 88mph. A good over, but England still picked off the runs"
pushed back into the crease and defended
a yawning drive to a wide outswinging delivery. Not quite timed
"right under the nose, and flicked effortlessly out through midwicket. If that's a sign of his timing, his curiously formidable record against SA could extend another match..."
defended into the leg side
"back of a length, angling into off stump. Pushed to cover"
fuller length but straight as a die. Blocked on the popping crease
stoutly blocked on the front foot
"clunked down to mid-off, tight line from Rabada"
"lifting through to the keeper, good pace and carry"
"short and sharp, and that was onto Roy much quicker than he'd anticipated. Pulling off the front foot to a 93mph delivery is ... ambitious. Deflected down into the crease, off the point of his elbow. That's gonna smart"
"through to the keeper, good judgement as this one nibbles in off the seam"
"on the toes, tucked out to midwicket"
"back of a length, tucked into the leg side"
"back of a length once again, punched back to the bowler"
"yikes, that was close! Tight to off stump once again, late on the stroke as he committed to the front foot, and the ball skews out of the reach of backward point and away to safety"
defended once again on the back foot
cautious once again
"committing to the front foot this time, poked to mid-off"
"gone! Roy is simply beaten for pace by a full, fast, straight yorker. He was playing all around it from the moment it left the hand, aiming through midwicket and losing his off stump instead"
"short, but outside off. Root limbos out of the way, a reverse bow as if to acknowledge Rabada's greeting of 'Good morning'"
"short and sharp again, but too short this time. Rob Bailey at square leg confirms that it should be called wide"
"back of a length, Root hops onto the back foot and waits for impact"
no way through there
pushed into the covers. This is a fine and threatening over
"strikes the pad, but sliding down"
blocked
"on the back foot, attempted punch on the up, through mid-on"
"up on the toes, punched out to cover"
"on the toes, clipped fine through fine leg. Which is appropriate really, given how fine it was"
solidly into line
"banged in short, another signal from square leg to confirm"
"short, and slapped. That is revoltingly beautiful, the sort of dirty back-away-and-batter-it that you get away with in the nets, but nowhere else. Sizzles through the covers, nonetheless"
"up on the toes, an insta-call from Root as he picks a slender gap in the covers"
"full and straight, and pushed to the covers"
"tight line once again, and punched into the covers again"
"slower ball, worked out through backward point"
inside edged defence into the leg side
solidly into line. This is a tight tussle so far
"slow, and back of a length, Root is beaten all ends up as the ball hops obediently over the stumps, like a toddler's pony over a small hedge"
"pushed out to the off side, taking on de Villiers' arm. He's not looked his absolute sharpest since his shoulder op"
"short and slapped into the off side, riding the bounce"
"that's a bit of a rank long-hop, slow and telegraphed from the moment it left the hand. Root had all the time in the world to saunter across his stumps and help it round the corner"
tucked out through midwicket to an appreciative smattering of applause
"onto the front foot, probing the covers once again"
solid in defence
another nudged single
"on the pads, deflected behind square"
"pace and width, Root has a fling outside off, but his weight was nowhere near the shot"
"tighter line, back of a length. Right behind the line of the ball with solid defence"
short and hauled out through backward square leg. Root is a bit miffed to pick out the fielder. That was whistling off the bat
""
"down the track, and the first genuine signs of aggression from Root, who advances to meet the pitch, and clubs a drive back past the bowler"
respectful defence this time
"hustled a touch from a fuller length, Root looking to drive off the back foot, but can't find his timing"
"whipped through wide mid-on, and this is a definite strategy from England, sensing a weakness in South Africa's attack and taking it on"
"on the toes, tucked to the leg side"
"full and straight, pushed to cover"
biffed down to long on
punched into the covers
"hoisted from a very full length, a touch lucky not to play all around that one as the ball dipped late. Square leg tidies up"
"onto the front foot, pushed to the leg side"
"width this time, pushed with an open face to deep point, where Root declines the second run, and probably wisely. Not a bad first over, that"
"Well, that's a natty response. Root drops to one knee, and flicks up and over the keeper's head. In fact it comes off a bit of an inside edge, but effective all the same"
more conventional front-foot play this time
"full and leg-sided, and Root muscles that off the pads and out through midwicket. Runs are leaking from this end, no matter what Pretorius tries"
"defended into the leg side, off the front foot"
forward and worked through the off side
"chopped hard through point, half-stopped but they come back for the second thanks to the deflection. It would probably have been a single if he hadn't taken the pace off the shot"
"stout defence, bat and pad together"
"bang! Fetch that! Down on one knee, hoicked over the infield, and bobbles away through midwicket. That's the fifty stand, and Root in particular is starting to tick"
clipped through the leg side again
"down the track, taking on the drive"
"<strong>dropped!</strong> That's a honker from Rabada on the wide long-on boundary! A mistimed smash from Hales, who had given up the ghost, but Rabada tips it over the bar, goalkeeper-style!"
solid defence from the chastened Hales
"up on the toes, punched through point"
"the drop costs just those six runs, it turns out! Outside off, bounces more than Hales anticipates as he leans back to cut, and de Kock snaffles a well-judged edge. Hales' record of fifties against South Africa comes to an end"
"outside off, swinging away from the left-hander"
punched into the covers
"that is a sumptuous drive! Who needs a sighter when you've got a century to your name? Morgan strides onto the front foot, meets the ball at the top of the bounce, and creams it to the rope"
pushed to the off side
"a very delicate paddle, almost too delicate as short backward-square swoops round to gather"
"thumped on the up, out to long-on"
deflected to the leg side
""
"panned off the back foot, out to deep cover"
"a touch of width, slapped through the covers. A tidy over"
crunched into the covers
close! Just drifts past the edge as Morgan is trapped on the crease
"driven, not comfortably, in the air through point. QdK's presence up to the stumps is keeping Morgan a touch flat-footed"
"on the pads, flicked firmly for another single to midwicket"
"Uh-oh! Has Root been <B>run out at the non-striker's end?</B> A fierce straight drive from Morgan, appears to flick the bowler's fingers, and he's a dead duck if the replays prove a fingertip... which it does! A calamitous way to go. He was looking set for a big'un"
"short of a length on off stump, punched through the off side"
"touch short outside off, Morgan is back and cuts in front of square to the cover sweeper"
"<b>dropped</b>, blimey! Stokes pushing forward outside, gets an outside edge towards Amla at slip and he barely gets a hand on it. Nice piece of bowling"
"<b>dropped</b>, another edge?! The keeper this time. Yes, he gets an outside edge as he pushes forward and de Kock can't gather what was a decent deflection"
"goodness me, he's edged it again...wide of slip this time as he comes down the pitch, Maharaj all over Stokes at the moment"
"lovely bowling, full outside off, hint of drift. Stokes makes himself get forward and is again uncomfortable as he defends"
flicked into the leg side...dramatic over
that's a lovely drive from the captain as he leans forward and strokes through cover
"comes down the pitch, this is full and deflects off the pads square into the leg side...a strangled appeal but he's miles down the pitch. Good running"
"full outside off from round the wicket, forced wide of mid-on"
"back of a length at off stump, defended"
opens the face a touch and steers behind point down to third man
defended into the off side
"full outside off, he's well forward and defends"
"touch fuller, flicked down to long-on"
driven to long-off
big appeal for lbw! Going for the reverse sweep. A big bottom edge saves him
and now there's an underedge as Morgan skips back to cut and the ball scoots between de Kock's legs
"a little shorter, Morgan has more time to adjust and bunts it pas the diving short cover"
"full and straight, defended with a slightly closed face"
gets his front foot across and works back to the bowler
"width outside off, square drives through point and the sweeper comes across"
"another big appeal for lbw, maybe an inside edge again...plenty of nervy moments. Given runs as it trickles to third man. Looks like two pads on replay"
"over the wicket, defended towards mid-on"
chopped into the ground as he goes for the cut
"full at off stump, a crunching drive finds mid-off"
jabs down on a defensive shot
"back of a length, on off stump, defended to the leg side"

"angled in towards the stumps, flicked through midwicket to the man in the deep"
defended to midwicket
"fuller, wide outside off, Morgan loses his shape as he goes to drive...pressure building"
"<B>dropped</b>, punched in the air back to the bowler who can't clutch it with his left hand. Fairly tough in the followthrough, but it's another one down"
tucked through the leg side
"that breaks the shackles, he drives on the up over wide mid-off...not sure it was quite out of the middle, but very safe"
"tighter to off stump, driven to mid-off and almost takes out the non-striker"
"back of a length on the stumps, dropped into the off side"
"on the pads, flicked to deep square leg"
"very wide outside off, Stokes catches up with it and drives to deep cover"
"slightly shorter, slides off an open face to backward point"
glorious shot! A length ball from round the wicket and Stokes sends it down the ground with a perfectly straight bat. Nearly goes all the way
works into midwicket
"short and a touch wide outside off, slapped to cover"
"fuller, very wide, he can't get any timing in the shot as he reaches for it and the ball bounces back to the bowler"
"back of a length, angled in at off stump, defended"
"shuffles to the leg side, the bowler tries to follow him, Stokes heaves it wide of mid-on, the bat faced closed a little but the connection was good enough"
"back of a length, straight, 80mph, defended to the off side"
"tight stuff, on middle and leg, defended"
"<B>dropped</b>, but a mighty tough one. A very thick edge, forcing off the back foot, rebounds off de Kock's gloves towards short third man. Some pain for him as he shakes his hand"
"short of a length on off stump, driven to cover from the back foot"
"carved over a leaping backward point, third man can't stop the second"
punched back to the bowler...tidy start from Phehlukwayo
"beats the top edge as Morgan goes for cut, beaten by the extra pace of Morris"
"width outside off, a crunching square drive whistles to deep cover"
"back of a length outside off, steered wide of point as he opens the face"
"beaten again, angled across outside off, short of a length, was there for the cut but the ball flies over the top edge"
"tight run! Back of a length, dropped into the off side, there's some confusion before they agree on the run and Morgan has to get the dive out. Gone with a hit from Miller running in from point"
"that's a sharp bouncer, scoots over Stokes' top edge as he plays the pull and evades a leap de Kock as well"
"full at off stump, a clubbing drive finds mid-on"
"that's pumped! Just short of a good length, no standing on ceremony from Stokes as he swings across the line and sends it over deep midwicket"
"and beats a booming drive, good take from de Kock who is up to the stumps"
"fuller, at the stumps, dragged to midwicket inside the circle"
squeezes this one past midwicket with a straight bat
"back over the wicket, angled across outside off, chopped down to third man"
"good length at off stump, defended down by his feet"
defended towards point
"that's a cracker! Threads the gap perfectly, there wasn't much of one between the two men either side of point, as he takes advantage of some width with a cut. A slower ball, too"
"goes short in response, Morgan pulls in front of square to deep midwicket"
"fuller, at the stumps, defended with a straight bat"

"poor ball, a slower ball gone wrong, dragged down the leg side"
"back of a length outside off, cut down to third man"
"that's crunched, but straight to the man at deep midwicket. Morris dropped short and Morgan was quickly on the pull"
"good delivery, bounces a touch at Stokes and takes the splice of the bat to the off side"
that's on its way down the south coast...Stokes shuffles outside leg stump and plays a lovely golf swing over deep midwicket. One for the snappers as he holds the pose
"back on a full length outside off, driven back to the bowler"
"on the pads, he rolls his wrists and works it behind square"
"did that take the helmet? Morgan through his pull short, the ball bounces down to third man...well-directed short ball. Yes, flush off the lid"

"short again, on off stump, 87mph, Morgan mistimes his pull and lobs it towards mid-on"
"a crunching cover drive, onto the front foot, that makes a sweet sound as it bounces into the adjacent wickets...cover jumps and manages to get a hand on it, taking the sting out of the stroke"
"over the wicket, Morgan drives inside out over the off-side ring"
"now he opts for the delicate touch, goes down and paddle-sweeps through short fine leg"
flicked from outside off to long-on
"full at the stumps, whipped to deep midwicket"
"nicely bowled, beats the outside edge as Morgan presses forward"
this time Morgan gets himself further across the crease and flicks back along the pitch
"very full outside off, 90mph, jabbed to cover off the toe end"
"edged! But over the slip. Short of a length, angled across Stokes, goes for the cut and it's a big top edge"
"hammered! That's out of the screws...fuller, on off stump, Stokes stands and deliveres and he drills it straight of mid-on"
"more sweet timing, this time straight of mid-off, but the fielder can get across...still, the single takes Stokes to his fifty. Cashing in on his reprieves"
"taken this time! How South Africa needed that. Angled across outside off, Morgan goes for the cut and gets a top edge which just carries through low to de Kock. Neat gather"
"good delivery, a short ball outside off, Buttler sways out of the line"
"full outside off, whipped to long-on"

"on the back foot, worked into the gap at midwicket"
"whoomph. Down on one knee, smashed over midwicket with two men back, and no hope of intercepting"
"carbon-copy, slightly closer to the leg-side sweeper, but no cutting that off"
"a third man drops to the leg-side, so Stokes dabs a single to the off-side"
"reverse-sweep, dinkily played"
Stokes returns the compliment with another single
"round the wicket, tight line, angling into the stumps"
"short, and smeared over the leg-side"
"crunched, but to no great avail"
"very full, very close! Right on the crease, and South Africa are using their <B>review</B>. Looked to the naked eye to be sliding down, but he was a long way back in the crease. We shall see ... no inside-edge involved. Here comes the ball-tracker ... a long delay, the tension is unbearable ... 'this always happens to me,' grumbles Rod Tucker in the third umpire's chair. But it is umpire's call! On we go..."
"a bit of width, and cracked to point"
whipped uppishly through wide mid-on
"thumped through the covers, literally, as another misfield helps them on their way"

"Stokes retreats to leg to free his arms, clubbed firmly to long-off"

"squared up on leg stump. Buttler not quite finding his range yet.  But he's still there, and time is on his side"
"nurdled to the leg side. Over to you, Stokesy"
thumped into the off side
"width, Buttler chases and can't really connect. That's a fine over at this stage of the game"
"a reverse humpty of a slap-shot ... not quite sure what that was, other than effective! Lobs over the head of what was backward point, then seems to gather speed as it skips to the rope"
chipped into the gap. They all count
"makes room on leg stump, Pretorius holds his line outside off, and Stokes can't fully connect with a reaching swing of the blade"
"on the back foot, dabbed to third man"
"up on the toes, defended to the on-side"
"round the wicket, spanked off the back foot straight through Pretorius in his followthrough"
outside off and chopped through third man
"scooper dooper! Buttler flips his stance, watches the ball clean into the middle of his bat, and lobs the ball over the keeper and down through fine leg!"
"much fuller and Buttler's strike from deep in the crease is fierce. But so too is de Villiers' intercept and shy from the covers, pinning Buttler on the calf as he skitters through. Ouch"
"blootered out through midwicket as Stokes leans back into a disdainful pull. And that's a poor effort on the rope, letting the four through his clutches"
"tighter line, no way through there"
"up on the toes, another slight fumble but not costly for a change"
"pumped into the off side, lots of bottom hand"
hoisted round the corner for another single
"up and over, that is raw power. The field had been adjusted to protect the leg-side, so he realigned his sights, and pasted a drive over the covers"
"going leg-side this time, he's into the nineties"
takes the pad this time
"a big wind-up, and a bit of an under-edged pull out through midwicket"
"in the slot, and slammed over long-on for six! When he frees his arms, they stay free!"
"punched into the off side, they opt not to take on extra cover's arm"
"flipped into the leg-side, Stokes wants two from the moment it leaves the bat, and there it is, Stokes has his second ODI hundred, and it's a monster. From 77 balls, with 11 fours and three sixes. And not a wobbly knee in sight"
"an inside-out wind-up, doesn't quite connect"
tight to the off stump
"slower-ball bouncer, well enough picked, and hoisted over the infield. More sloppy fielding to undermine South Africa's efforts"
"another reverse-sweep, but straight to <strike>point</strike> square leg"
"gives himself room for a tonk over the off-side, but it comes off the toe as Maharaj holds his line outside off, and that's the end of a fine innings from Ben Stokes, easily pocketed in the deep"
"drilled with oodles of bottom hand, out to deep extra cover where Morris does well to cut off the boundary"
"reverse-swept again, and another half-decent intercept to save a run"
"another reverse-sweep, picking out the man on the boundary. Buttler is starting to find his timing, without setting the innings alight just yet"
"wow, no messing from Moeen. Two skips down the pitch, and wristily butchered through short cover and all the way to the rope"
thumped out to the leg side
"walloped hard and straight, back past the bowler and cut off on the edge of the rope"
"outside off, and drilled into the covers"
"clobbered down the ground, the full length preventing Buttler from getting under the shot"
"short, and swished off the eyebrows over square leg"
"short and that was unexpectedly sharp. Morris goes up a gear when it suits him, and that was through the batsman before his pull could come swinging through"
"outside off, that's too short and wide, and Moeen needs only to lay bat on ball to pick off the boundary behind square"
attempted flick over the leg side. Takes the pad and through they go
pulled and with severe power. Behardien in front of square didn't have time to flinch as the ball whistles past him
"four more, and that's utterly nailed for timing. Fractionally leg-sided, Buttler planted his front foot and whisked his wrists across the line"
"hello, hello. Here comes the beast mode. Reverses his stance, inverse-pulls over backward point for another four ..."
"an attempt to react to Buttler's manoeuvrings, but that was way outside the tramlines, no matter how much dancing there was at the crease"
"short, and crunched through square leg. Too. Much. Timing. Twenty-two off the over, and now England are rushing to a massive total"
"short, attempted pull, but cramped on the angle. Deflects off the body for the keeper to tidy up"
"too quick. Buttler tried to hoist a pull off a decent length, but the ball was through him"
"wider of off stump, and exacerbated by Buttler backing away to free his arms. Well bowled"
"yorker length, excellent delivery, as Buttler digs it out and settles for the single"
wide of the left-hander's off stump. Well bowled again
"short, and wiped into the leg side. That's a fantastic over in the invidious circumstances"
tonked back past the bowler
"slower-ball, fuller length, tapped to long-on for a single"
"another scoop over fine leg, and there is Buttler's fifty. Not his most destructive, but a vital opportunity to rediscover his form. And he's got three overs to go nuts now"
"outside off, pushing the tramlines, and Morris is a bit miffed by that call"
"short ball, and Buttler somehow converts an ungainly off-balance pull into a perfectly placed four through midwicket"
swing and a miss. A rare air shot
"too short, too easy. Battered like a top-spin forehand winner, through wide long-on. Fetch that and bowl me another!"
worked to the leg side to bring Buttler back on strike
"outside off, very full. Good connection from Buttler but the length is too good to make anything more than a single to deep cover"
"uppishly pulled, down to backward square"
"another massive wipe, a spiralling top-edge, this should be caught ... but no! Amla fails to get a hand to it on the fine-leg boundary and that's technically another <B>dropped catch</B>"
too far outside off
straighter. Punched up to long-on
"that's a lovely ball to finish Rabada's spell. Full and inswinging, and Buttler settles for a battered drive down to long-off"
"just a nugget of width, too much width when the slog is on. Bossed through the covers"
"tighter line, so Ali hoists languidly over midwicket instead"
"slower ball, Moeen winds up for the big shot, has to check it, and loses his timing as a consequence. Well bowled"
lots of shuffling and a spiralling top-edge over the keeper's head. They all count
"full length, and defended down the ground"
"Another wipe, another top-edge, and a wicket to complete another crunching day's work from England's brutal top seven"
"full at off stump, clipped to the left of mid-on"

"he's across the crease, works a short-of-a-length delivery to midwicket"
"fuller, angling in at middle and off, defended towards mid-on"
"offers some width first up, but de Kock cuts straight to backward point"
"in the air, just wide of point...short and wide, deserved to be hint, de Kock slices it in the air square through the off side"
"bit of zip there! It's 87mph, back of a length and angled across de Kock, bounces over the top edge as de Kock aims to play square"
"tighter to off stump, played into the pitch and it runs to the on side"
"full and straight, clipped to deep square leg"

"back of a length, at off stump, 87mph, defended under his nose"
whips this from off stump to the man just in front of square on the leg side
"a touch fuller, hint of late movement into Amla, driven confidently off the front foot towards mid-off and it's a sharpish single as Morgan comes across from cover"
"that's lovely, full and a little wide outside off, de Kock leans into it and strokes the ball through the covers. At Wood's pace, you just need to lean on it"
"closer to off stump, defended to cover"
"short of a length outside off, driven with an open face and it goes behind point to third man"
"a strangled appeal for lbw, full and straight, de Kock playing across the line...given as a run"
"back of a length outside off, good wheels at 88mph, defended towards point"
"fuller, at off stump, driven firmly back to the bowler"
cut square to point
"goes too full this time, Amla punches it straight of mid-off to keep things ticking"
worked away from around off stump into the leg side
"oh, boy! Amla has ducked straight into a short ball. He'll need some time to get check out here. The delivery angled back in at Amla as he tried to sway out of the line. Slams into the grille, knocks the helmet around"
"short again, but he's comfortably inside the line and knocks it through square leg"
"88mph, tucked into the on side"
"beats the outside edge, good delivery angled across, de Kock had a little nibble"
"on off stump, defended to the leg side...a lively and accurate over from Wood"
"back of a length, straight, shoveled through the leg side"
squares him up a little outside off as he defends
"across his stumps, a bit like how he fell in the previous match, takes the pad and deflects to square leg"
"that's pinged off the bat, a straight-bat square drive through point...not a huge amount wrong with the ball (from Ball) just a touch short and wide"
"full outside off, defended to cover"
"almost a repeat of Headingley for de Kock, gets a top edge as he pulls at a back-of-a-length delivery but this time it loops over slip"

"another short ball, over leg stump, de Kock lets it go through and ponders whether he should have got a wide call I think"
"fuller, 90mph, turned to square leg"
defending at the top of bounce towards cover
"lovely shot, Amla at his best, whips a perfectly respectable length delivery from about off stump through straight midwicket"
"fuller, outside off, driven to mid-off who makes a direct hit...Amla looks safe. Very little excitement. Yes, he's well home"
"too short from round the wicket, de Kock latches on and pulls wide of mid-on...poor delivery"
"pushes this further up, takes a thickish outside edge to cover as de Kock looks to work to leg"
"chance with a hit...and misses! Punched square into the off side, bounces very nicely for Morgan. One stump to aim and, well, he couldn't hit a barn door there. Moving on"
flicked into the leg side
"short outside off, rides the bounce and pushes behind square on the off side"
"full outside off, driven to mid-off"
"tries to fetch this from outside off with another pull, doesn't make contact...Wood slips it through"
"misses another pull, and there's some pain this time as he gets taken on the stomach...89mph delivery"
"a sharp bouncer outside off, Amla stays well out of the line"
"<B>dropped</b>, would have been a stinger by Stokes! Short outside off, de Kock plays a flat-batted pull and Stokes thrusts out his right hand. Nearly holds on"
"fuller, driven through the covers"
"short of a length, gets neatly inside the line and works to long leg"
he's across his stumps and works from outside off out to deep square leg
"and he's struck! Stokes is having a decent day. Full, wide, quite inviting for the batsman who drives it straight to cover. Amla had to reach for it a little and couldn't keep it down"
"full outside off, left alone"

driven on the up square into the off side

"down the leg side, he'll have to bowl that again"
"full at the stumps, strong flicked wide of mid-on and that's a lovely piece of timing and placement"

"drives over a full toss outside off, Stokes gets away with it"
this time he nearly takes the outside edge as du Plessis drives at a full delivery
"back of a length outside off, chopped to point"
"oh dear, now it's England's turn for a misfield...Hales dives over one at deep square which means de Kock's pull earns a boundary"
"back outside off, driven firmly to point"

"on the back foot once more, tapped to midwicket to get off the mark"
"big stride forward, blocked to the off side"

pushed back down the ground
tucked to the leg side
"hurries through, and defended on the back foot"
"a loopy legspinner, met with a compact drive to deep extra cover"

"tucked up on the angle from round the wicket, attempted a dab through the off side but beaten by the off cutter"
"short, and effective. De Kock ducks"

"back and across, a touch slower through the air, short cover tidies up"

twirled onto a good length outside off
leans back to fillet a back-foot drive to deep point
pushed out to point
a heave out to the leg side. Hales sweeps round to field

"tighter line, and a bit quicker through the air. Punched back to the bowler"
inside-out drive to wide long-off
tighter line
"on the pads, clipped uppishly into the leg side"
"round the wicket, that's well bowled, angling into the left-hander and demanding respect"
"that, on the other hand, is brilliant, a bottom-handed whip-drive, working against the spin and fizzing it through the leg-side field"
pushed with a full face back down the pitch
"up and over, not massively short from Moeen, but picked like a freshly scrumped apple, one bounce over wide long-off"
turned to the leg side
"back and across, and pushed into the covers"

"down the leg side, misses out with a sweep, but got enough on it to prevent the wide"

"dabbed into the covers, off the front foot"
"that's superb fielding at short cover from Morgan, leaping to his left to intercept a fierce drive"
"ooh, lots of everything on that shot, inside edge, pad-flap, and ultimately boundary rope as Buttler is left flat-footed to his left"
"brisk again, through to the keeper. A decent over, no liberties taken by South Africa"
"round the wicket, dabbed through third man"

"a millimetre too short, and de Villiers latches onto his powerful bottom-handed launchpad of a drive over midwicket. Shot!"
advancing down the track but Ball sees him coming and adjusts his length. Well bowled

tucked out to backward square leg
heaved out to deep square leg
"tight to the pads, can't get his favoured flick to leg away"
"outside off, and worked down to third man"
"banged in short, and leg-sided. No hope of reaching that with a stepladder"
"that's a brilliant piece of aggressive fast bowling! Short, sharp, following de Villiers as he limboed out of the way, but he left his gloves dangling, and Buttler did well to reach forward and scoop a teasing low chance inches from the turf! A huge moment in this match, and nay, series. While AB was in situ, anything was possible"

"outside off, and drilled on the up through the off side"

"this time he gets a sweep away, quite a bit of top edge but scoots away safely behind square"
nudged off the pads into midwicket
"he's been given! He's tickled it behind for 98. What a moment. Bowled slower by Moeen, may just have gripped a touch, de Kock trying to open the face and run it towards third man but just gets a graze through to Buttler"
"full at the stumps from round the wicket, dug out down the ground"
"comes down the pitch, Root drags the length back, pushed to midwicket"
"plays back this time, scampers a single into the leg side...Miller dives in"
worked off the pads through square leg
"full outside off, played back to the bowler"
"fuller, a touch quicker, beats the outside edge as he tries to play square."
driven to long-off
"a little short, he plays back and drives to the cover sweeper"
that helps! Takes a couple of steps out of his crease and lofts it inside-out over extra cover. That looked effortless
"quicker, flatter, bunted down the ground"
flicked from outside off to midwicket
pushed firmly down to long-on to keep the strike
pushed down the ground to long-on

bottom hand comes into play as he shovels down to long-on

"shorter, he rocks bat and bunts down to long-on"
"slower this time from Moeen, tucked off the pads to deep square"
popped in the air but lands short of midwicket
again he finds Morgan at midwicket
"edged onto Buttler's knee, I think, as he tries to dab this away late...might technically be a chance"
flicked along the ground through straight midwicket and the lack of pace on the shot allows the second
"another strong sweep, in front of square this time, helps ease a little pressure"
pushed down the ground
"round the wicket, back of a length, flicked to deep midwicket"
"dragged wide outside off, a slower ball, off-cutter, and it's called wide"
"on the stumps, knocked down to long-on"
"banged in short, doesn't really get up but it's superbly played by Miller who places his pull expertly behind square to bisect the deep fielders"
pushed firmly to cover on the edge of the circle
"missed his pull, was there an edge? Takes the back leg, I think, and dies on its way to Buttler"
"back of a length outside off, drags it wide of long-on and it allows them back for a second"
"down the pitch, doesn't quite get this out of the middle, drags it wide of long-on"
"shorter outside off, pushed to cover and they are content to give away the single to Miller"
"short outside off, but he plays and misses at his cut shot...another dot to him"
"a wide line outside off, he fetches it into the leg side and Moeen chases himself"
"very full, outside off, driven to the cover sweeper"
"comes through the line with the bottom and sends it to long-on, keeps the strike which will please England"
"full outside off, gets this away over the off side but doesn't the timing to beat a scampering Joe Root coming round from deep cover"
"back of a length, flicked off his pads to long leg...a fifty off 34 deliveries. Excellent innings"
"finds mid-off! If we are honest, that might help South Africa. Tries to send a length ball over the in-field, comes off the bottom of the bat and Moeen snaffles the catch above his head moving to his left"
"round the wicket, slices a full ball to backward point"
"on off stump, dabbed towards point"
a short ball as he sees Miller come down the pitch and it's called wide...tough being a bowler
"and now he pushes this one down the leg side, he tried to follow Miller as he again came down the pitch...no doubt about that wide call. Buttler hits the stumps with an under-arm, they check with TV but Miller is safe"
"back of a length outside off, angled to third man"
uses his feet and crunches a length ball out to deep cover
"full at off stump, he swings through the line and down to long-on"
"short ball, outside leg stump, Miller swivels on a pull down to long leg...singles fine for England"
"gives himself room to the leg side, then swings and misses at a back-of-a-length delivery. Priceless dot ball"
"another short ball, angled in at the body, Miller pulls but it just loops behind square...might have been glove"
"full and straight, cannons into Miller's bat and ricochets into the off side...that might have gone straight down the ground, instead it's a dot ball"
"drags a length ball towards deep midwicket, doesn't get it cleanly, one bounce to the fielder"
"short from round the wicket, just a single as he pulls to deep square leg"
hammered! Full outside off and he crunches it between cover and mid-off. A bit floaty by Plunkett's standards
"just gets away with it! Dragged the length, it goes high in the air and loops over midwicket. Jake Ball tries to back-track but can't quite get there"
"he's nailed that! Hasn't moved. Length delivery, launched into the stands at deep midwicket. He didn't even follow the ball. Some hit"
banged in short outside off and he misses his attempet to carve through the off side
"full, wide outside off, angled down to third man"
"moves outside leg, it's a low full toss which he plops out to deep cover...not from the middle"
"gets a wide yorker in, right on the popping squeeze, can only get it as far as cover on the edge of the ring"
"it's length again and that's what Morris likes, drills through the line and sends it straight down the ground...inches short of six"
"another low full toss, flicked over the leg side, between deep square and deep midwicket"
"a short ball, and a dot ball, angled over leg side, Morris can't make contact with his pull"
"round the wicket, Miller moving miles outside leg, follows him and it takes the thigh pad behind square...Miller gambles on the second. Better throw from Buttler would have been tight"
"he's crunched that, a short ball, but straight to Stokes at deep midwicket"
"there's a boundary, again it's short from Wood and it flies off the top edge as Morris hooks...did him for pace, really, but South Africa won't care"
"good comeback by Wood, a yorker outside off stump and Morris drives over the top of it"
"charges down the pitch, Wood goes short (and fast) again, Morris can't make contact as he swings across the line"
"that's huge! Swings it back South Africa's way. Poor ball, went length, Morris just stood there and heaved it over wide long-on. Wood knows he got that one wrong"
"that's into the crowd as well, a clean strike through a full delivery which goes straight down the ground and South Africa motoring"
goes shorter and that's rifled square through the off side with thunderous power...magnificent striking from Miller
"keeps it short, pulled to deep midwicket"
"another short ball, Morris takes his eyes of it but manages to pull to long leg"
"fuller, swings across the line, takes the back leg and deflects towards backward point and, in fact, England are <B>reviewing</b> for the lbw. High on the back leg, heading leg side. Going over leg stump"
"full, swings across the line, an appeal for lbw as he scuttles through to the keeper...inside edge"
"short, down the leg side, pulled to long leg...fielder quickly on it, so just the single"
"short again, pulled to long leg...was struck sweetly but almost straight at the fielder"
"dot ball! Short of a length, follows the batsman as he moves outside leg, beats the top edge"
"that's out of the screws, but only a single as the pull shot races to deep square...nearly took the square leg umpire"
"dot ball! And an appeal for a gloved pull. Was a short ball, very well directed, not called wide. Oh, the drama. Did it clip the arm?"
"England have done it! What a final over from Wood. It's back of a length, Morris heaves across the line and it rebounds off his back leg to the off side"
