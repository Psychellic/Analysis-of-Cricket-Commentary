"drifts down leg, wide. Absolutely no turn so far this over"
"short around off, sits up, 89 kph, defended back"
"driven away to cover. Full and wide, the slider, a quick single and Kusal makes the run eventually. A tight single."
"quick and straight, nudged away into the leg side, towards midwicket for one. Hurrying the batsman with his skiddy nature."
"a length delivery outside off, carved away towards backward point. The ball beats the fielder, much to the joy of the crowd. By the time, third man got to the ball, both batsmen were set on two."
"good single, full around off, just tapped towards point and Gunathilaka calls for one. Excellently played."
"a full delivery, sees Kusal backing away and follows him. Pushed towards cover"
"just over mid-on. A short delivery around off, Kusal mis-hits the ball, the ball just evades the fielder at mid-on. No timing, but just enough bat to clear the fielder"
"nice timing on that. Races away to the midwicket boundary. Good length delivery down leg, flicked away with immense power into that gap. Mahmudullah labours after it from mid-on and can't haul the ball back in."
"taken! Shakib strikes in his comeback. It's flat and straight, Gunathilaka backs away, looking to hit the ball straight. But his timing is off, and all he can do is chip the ball to the fielder at long-on, who runs to his right and takes a smart catch."
"shortish and slow, punched down to long-on"
"short, wide and put away. Flat, too much width. Carved away through cover for four. Amazing timing again."

"shortish, wide, skidding back in, carved to backward point"
"the dart, quick down leg, a leading edge towards midwicket"
"short down leg, off the pad, maybe a bit of bat, towards short fine leg. The fielder hits the stumps directly"

"a good length delivery outside off, carved away towards backward point. Fine timing, but the placement isn't great"
"short again, outside off, tapped towards backward point. 138 kph."
"the cutter, full outside off, and wide. The ball beats the bat."
"taken at midwicket! A short delivery from Mustafizur, short and hurrying Kusal Mendis on the pull. He can't quite time his pull, picks out the fielder. A fantastic over from Mustafizur, culminates with a wicket."

"on the pads this time, clipped away towards backward square leg for a run."
"short and quick, around off, slashed away towards point."
"<strong>beaten on the outside edge</strong>. Slow outside off, the ball takes some turn and beats Tharanga."

"slashed for four. Can't bowl there, short, wide and asking to be hit. Carved through backward point for four."
"ooh, strays down leg, wide."
"drifts down leg again, on the pads, worked away towards short fine leg. Nicely stopped from the fielder."
"run-out! Good awareness from the bowler and the midwicket fielder. Sri Lanka are now tottering. A back of a length delivery, nudged away towards midwicket with soft hands. Kusal comes down a few steps, Tharanga is indecisive and in the end, that's what costs him. He eventually runs and sacrifices himself. The fielder ran towards the stumps, then lobbed the ball to the bowler who took off the bails."
"on middle and leg, worked to deep backward square leg."
"edged and gone! Sri Lanka are now four down for 32 in a semi-final. Stunning delivery, it's the same offcutter that has made him the bowler he is today. Pitches outside off, lulls the batsman into a stroke and then rips away. Shanaka prods, gets a thick outside edge and it's caught behind. Big trouble for Sri Lanka."
"the full, straight one, defended back. Very watchful."
"goes short this time, outside off, rises above Mendis' duck. Called a wide."
"a couple of leg byes. Full down leg, off the pads down to fine leg. Cut in just inside the boundary."

"shortish and straight, carved off the open face to deep point"
"lots of flight on middle and leg, worked into the leg side for nothing."

"shortish and wide, hit away to cover. Another dot."
"flat and straight, clipped into the leg side for one."
"taken at short fine leg. Sri Lanka continue to go nowhere. It's another attempted sweep, the ball flies to short fine leg via the leading edge and SL sink further. Tried to roll his wrists on the ball and hit it behind square, failed to do so."
"full and wide to start, drilled down to long-off for one"
"good batting, slow outside off, pushed to point for one. Good single."
"short of slip! Slow around off, Thisara prods forward, gets a thick outside edge which dies in front of the fielder"
"flighted outside off, driven to cover"
a solid defensive block as Thisara gets forward
that will be four. Kusal has been in fine touch this tournament. A bit wide and Kusal scythes a cut through point. Fantastic timing.
"slow outside off, pushed to cover. A massive appeal. Mahmudullah thinks there is pad first, before bat. And so forces <strong>Shakib into a review</strong>. There was only bat, no pad, as you could probably tell if you were at the ground, loud cheers as the replays go up. Poor review."
"slow around off, no turn, worked to midwicket for one"

"short again, pummeled into the boundary behind square on the leg side. Picks the length, stays back and rolls his wrists on the pull. Fantastic timing"
"that's even better. Rubel played the 1-2, the short one followed by the full, straight one. Kusal played his own combination, 4 and 4. Drilled with the full face through mid-off. Sensational timing."
"good end, on a length down leg, worked to deep square leg. 10 off the over"
"short outside off, worked to deep midwicket for one"
"slow outside off, nice and loopy through the air, defended into the off side."
"whipped into the gap at midwicket. Kusal Perera races back for two, but there is a direct hit at the bowler's end. The TV umpire's assistance is required, but a full-length dive from Kusal saves him. Terrific commitment, not only for the dive but to come back for two."
"fast on middle, clipped to deep midwicket, just one"
"82 kph, loopy on middle, blocked back. Better line."
"short around off, clipped to deep midwicket. This time, long-on keeps them down to one."
"short down leg, nudged with soft hands into the gap at midwicket. Kusal brings his partner back for two."
"short-arm jabbed for six. That's Kusal Perera at his best. Just a tad short, Kusal picks the length, stays in his crease and forehands that over midwicket. Federer, who?"
"that will be four. Poor ball. Short and wide, Kusal gets under the length of that and carves the ball over backward point. Too easy."
"short on the pads, worked to square leg."

"slow outside off, pushed to deep point for one."
"what batting. A full delivery outside off, a yorker, Kusal slices the ball off the outside half and finds the gap through point. No man there. Onto 49"
"a slower delivery down leg, clipped to midwicket for one. <strong>Is this his best T20I fifty?</strong> Sensational knock so far"

"another slower one outside off, swatted to deep cover"

"over deep square leg, six! Thisara now on fire. Another short delivery from Thisara, who reads the length early enough and pulls the heck out of the ball. Well over square leg."
"shot of the tournament. A slower delivery outside off, Thisara stays in his crease, reads the length and just lofts a drive, but ensures he extends that drive. Way over long-off. Sensational batting from This P."
"shortish around off, pulled towards midwicket. Two more as it's in the gap."

"good end, a straight yorker. Not much Thisara can do but push to long-off for one."
"excellent yorker, Thisara can't make contact. Off the pad for a run"
"caught on the deep midwicket boundary. Full, quick and accurate down leg. Kusal struggles to time his flick, the ball takes the leading edge and travels all the way to Mehidy. Sensational counter-attacking innings from Kusal, bided his time early and then launched."
"parried for six! <strong>Fifty for Thisara too</strong>. A low full toss on middle and leg, chipped away to Sabbir, who misjudges the catch, runs in and then realises he has run in too far. Sticks out his right hand and the ball bursts through and clears the boundary"
"a wide yorker, sliced to backward point for one. Thisara happy to take one."
"a low full toss, drilled away to long-on. Mahmudullah picks up at long-on and tosses the ball towards long-off, who does not collect. Concedes an extra run."
"strays down leg, wide."
"lands short of long-on. A low full toss again, chipped with bad timing to the fielder at long-on."
"that will help. Full and wide, Thisara slices the ball off the outside half. He gets so much power behind the ball that it still races away for four."
"a juggled catch by Tamim. A slower ball around off, Thisara swings but the ball takes the leading edge towards cover. Tamim runs forward, towards mid-off, and juggles the catch."
"a low full toss on middle and leg, shovelled towards wide long-on for two more."

"full and wide, Tamim looks to drive on the up but the ball skews to mid-on because of the slowness of the surface"
"fine shot. Overpitched outside off from Pradeep, smashed back by Tamim, full face of the bat through mid-on. Relying on timing."
"too straight this time, nudged to midwicket for one. Good early call"

"that flew through to the keeper. Back of a length outside off, the ball flies and beats the prod of Liton."

"flat and wide outside off, turning in, swept down to short fine leg."
"tossed up wider than normal, full and wide outside off, Liton chips a catch to mid-off. He had to reach out for that and so was in no control of that shot. All he can do is bunt his catch away."

"92 kph, slow and straight, worked to midwicket"
"stumped! Beautiful bowling, you could sense panic from Kusal Perera keeps his composure. Slow outside off, the ball finds a big gap between bat and pad, and goes through to Kusal. The ball snakes around in his lap, then his arm. Eventually, it sticks in his left arm. And he whips off the bails with his right hand. Don't think the umpires are checking. Nothing wrong with the bowling though, lulled him forward with that loop and found a big gap between bat and pad."
"slow outside off, worked to square leg. Loud cheers of 'Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka.' Colombo is abuzz."
