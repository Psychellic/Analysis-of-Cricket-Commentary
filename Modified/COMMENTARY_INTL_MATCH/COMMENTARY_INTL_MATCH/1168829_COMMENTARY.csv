"fuller this time, Vince nudging the ball to mid off and setting off for a tight single"
"Rauf sends one down full and wide outside off, Siddiq angling his drive down to third man"

"Afridi comes round the wicket this time, hitting a length at 135km/h, and the ball takes the inside half of a Vince pull and rolls down to fine leg"

"Afridi aims this one fuller, and it's dug out to extra cover"

"<b>and first ball he's cut past point!</b> He dished up a short, wide loosener and Siddiq slapped his cut past a diving point fielder"

"just short of a good length, Vince setting himself for a swat to midwicket but hitting only fresh air"

"Rahat responds by pulling his length back a touch, and Vince can only find a single with a swipe to fine leg"
"<b>helped on its way!</b> Superb timing on the stroke, but Rahat's line was way off, headed down the leg side, and Siddiq just scooped it further in that direction"
"Vince backs away to leg and Rauf follows him with a 136km/h bouncer, but Vince nails his flick-pull up and over short fine leg"
"I'm not sure about the pace on the ball as it was delivered, but it certainly had pace on it as it pinged off Vince's drive and scorched over the cover outfield for four"
"effort ball from Rauf, very nippy at 145km/h but misdirected way down the leg side. Taylor dives, but he doesn't have a chance"
"<b>top edged over the keeper!</b> Rauf delivers a rapid bouncer at 148km/h, and it's took quick for Vince but the thick top edge of his pull still sends the ball arcing over the boundary behind him, <b>bringing up the team fifty</b>"

"flicked off the toes through square leg, just the single"

"Siddiq throws his hands into a drive, and the ball takes an inside edge before rolling down to fine leg"

"first false shot of the day for Vince, playing and missing at a cut outside off"
"<b>brutal, brutal hit!</b> Wiese tries a slower ball, but Vince appears to see it out of the hand, setting himself deep in the crease and then smiting it high over wide long on"
"a low, dipping full toss is tapped out to long off"
"short, and Siddiq top edges his pull but hits it so badly the ball falls well short of the boundary fielder"
"flighted up on middle, and Siddiq turns the strike back over with a little drive to long on"
"<b>a slog sweep falls short of a diving fielder at long on!</b> Vince has hit them so well today, but this one came off the toe end, the lofted shot falling short of a diving long on fielder"
"Vince is down the track this time, inside edging a wild swipe to short fine leg"
"another edge, but it's the outside edge of a Siddiq cut. Rahat Ali sprints after it and pulls the ball back just in time"
"<b>Lamichhane breaks through!</b> His very first PSL wicket, and it will give his team just a little breathing room. The ball wasn't an unplayable one, and in fact was a little short, but it rushed on to Vince as he tried to pull and he mis-hit the shot out to wide long on, where the fielder held a good, high catch"
"<b>could have been a run out!</b> Siddiq misses a cut, Taylor misses his take, and Shoaib Malik wants a single off the misfield. But Siddiq is ball watching, and very late in sending him back"

"<b>fifty up for Siddiq, and what a way to get there!</b> Lamichhane bravely flighted the ball up on middle, but Siddiq smashed it way over midwicket in response to reach his milestone"
"<b>dropped at short fine leg!</b> They really can't afford this. Siddiq sweeps again, but this time a top edge loops down to short fine leg, where the fielder dives forward but the ball pops out as his elbows hit the ground"
"<b>Malik into the act!</b> Googly from Lamichhane, but it's picked and Malik skips down the track to power it miles over the long on boundary"
"flatter and faster this time, and Malik is content with a single down the ground"
"Siddiq bends low to sweep, and it's not quite close enough to him so he takes the bottom hand off the bat,"
"<b>caught at long off!</b> Lamichhane has another. Malik danced out at another flighted one, looking to hit a third six in the over, but he's not to the pitch and mistimes his slog down the ground"
"slipping down the leg side, the ball kisses the pad but Taylor dives to his right to stop any extra run"
"full and straight, Siddiq lets his bottom hand lead the shot as he flaps a single into the leg side"
"slower ball from Afridi, and Russell can do nothing with it, the ball trickling into the leg side"
"Afridi bends his back on a bouncer, which isn't that pacy at 131km/h, but Russell wants no part of it and ducks underneath the ball"
"<b>dropped!</b> By Taylor, of all people. Russell swipes across the line at a length delivery angled across him, and the ball took a big top edge and soared miles up into the air. It was a real steepler, coming back down with ice on it, and it's Taylor with the gloves who calls for it, running back, but he shells it! Graeme Smith on tv commentary suggests an apology (and 20 press-ups) are in order from BT for dropping the catch, which is quite a savage burn"
"<b>but this one is caught!</b> Short ball from Afridi, and this time it's Siddiq's turn to top edge a pull. The ball doesn't go nearly as high, and Akhtar holds an easy catch at fine leg"
"<b>powered over long on!</b> This is what happens if you drop Russell. He bends low and slogs the ball cleanly over long on, and almost out of the ground"
"the riposte is a googly from Lamichhane, which Russell just about reads and taps to cover"
"<b>caught and bowled!</b> Another slog, and another top edge. This one doesn't go too high, and Lamichhane calls for it himself, holding the easy catch. Taylor is the first one over to him to congratulate the young bowler"
"wrong 'un straight away from Lamichhane, and Christian presses forward into an incongruously orthodox forward defensive"
"Christian stays deep in his crease this time, whipping a legbreak down to long on with plenty of bottom hand"

"Wiese aims full and straight, Christian driving down the ground for one"
"seaming in to the pads off the track, and Evans whips across them to get off the mark with a single"
"just short of a good length, outside off. Christian forces the ball to point, and they sprint through for a quick one"
"short ball from Wiese, outside off. Evans thinks about a ramp cut, but pulls his bat out of the way at the last moment"
"whipped off the hip, and down to fine leg for one"
"swatted over the leg side field, and Christian is up and running"
"and his first ball back is a good one, a yorker shaping in towards leg stump, but Evans jabs the bat down and the ball rolls into space, allowing a second"
"excellent ball once again, a full wide yorker outside off. Evans backs away, but can't put bat to ball"
"attempted improvisation by Evans, who fakes a back-away to leg and then instead walks across to the off side, but Rauf bustles in and fires a length ball over the top of middle"
"Evans clears his front leg and slices a drive out towards the cover sweeper ... it's Afridi out there, and he didn't seem to sight the ball early enough to run in for the catch"
"well bowled once again, another yorker and the best Christian can do is dig it out down the ground"
"another superb yorker, and Evans jabs it out to the point fielder"
"another fine yorker, and it's jabbed to mid off"

""
"pacy from Rauf, up at 147km/h, but it's hurled way down the leg side and only a diving stop from Taylor stops further runs"
"great follow up! Rauf fires in a yorker that Christian does well just to keep out. He loses sight of the ball, wandering out in pursuit of a single, but Rauf charges through his follow through, picks it up, and hurls down the stumps. He also offers the departing Christian quite the send-off, but the Australian's response is a belly laugh of note"
"crunched to mid off, just the one"
"a big swipe, a top edge, and Rauf himself calls for it even though Taylor might also have got to it. Rauf celebrates, and 200 might not be on any more"
"Azam swings mightily, but the ball comes off the toe end and trickles to long on"
"full, smeared down the ground, mid off dives over it, long on dives over it, and it's four. De Villiers was at mid off, and to be fair the ball was past him before he could even dive. <b>Multan Sultans reach 200 for the first time</b>"
"short and rising from a middle stump line at 136km/h, Irfan can't put bat to ball and it's a dot to finish"
"<b>strong start!</b> Whipped off a length, with plenty of bottom hand, and it rolls away through midwicket"
"cuts him in half! A brute of a delivery, rising and nipping back in to beat the inside edge, and the keeper too"
"short and wide, but fortunately for Irfan some nifty fielding from Evans at point saves the boundary"
"<b>top edge, but safe!</b> Pace and bounce from Irfan, and it got really big on Sohail, taking the splice and looping over gully ... but short of third man"
"a touch of nip, in off the seam, and Fakhar can do nothing with the delivery"
"short once again, but Fakhar was deep in his crease and waiting for it, slamming his pull out to the fielder at deep midwicket"
"<b>short of the mid off fielder this time!</b> Sohail is living dangerously. He has a go at Ilyas' first delivery, which was full and straight, but toe-ended his drive. Again, though, the ball falls short, this time of mid off"
"an awkward length for Fakhar, and angling across him, but he manages to get some glove/bat on the ball and pinch a single"
"<b>big appeal for lbw!</b> Ilyas got this one to nip back in off the seam, beating Sohail's attempted flick and striking the pad. Possibly going down leg"
"<b>slammed down the ground!</b> Ilyas was settling into a wicket to wicket line, but Sohail eyes up a full one and just smashes it down the ground, all along the turf and past a diving mid off"
"nicely straight from Ilyas again, and Sohail whips across his front pad to collect two down to Irfan at fine leg"
"ouch! Sohail is bent over and breathing hard after being struck in the midriff by a skiddy length delivery from Ilyas. He tried to pull it, but it was too full for the shot"
Fakhar's feet go nowhere as he taps a full ball back to the bowler
"dug in short by Irfan, but the ball just leaps up and keeps on going, over the batsman, over the leaping wicketkeeper, and away for extras"
"rising off a length, and nicely straight. Fakhar slugs it out to deep midwicket"
"Sohail sends the ball to gully with an angled bat, the batsmen wander out looking for a single, but there's none to be had ... until the shy comes in, which is wild and wide and allows a run"

"Sohail waits in his crease and slashes his cut, but it's straight to that gully fielder"
"fuller this time, but again Sohail slices his drive and the wide gully fielder has work to do"

"slapped down to long on, Sohail was aiming for a pull but the ball just rushed him a bit"
"Fakhar swats across the line with plenty of bottom hand, but he can't get it past midwicket"

"<b>and he hits his first ball in the PSL for four!</b> Too short from Malik, and Butt steps back to slam the friendly half-tracker over midwicket"
"a touch short again, but the cut goes straight to point"
"floated down full, on off stump, and it's driven to long off for a single"
"Fakhar comes down the track, but he's not nearly to the pitch and is saved by a big bottom edge, the ball bouncing hard into the turf and allowing him an extra moment to scurry back to the crease"

"on a length, and it's cracked to point. Fakhar wants a single, but there's none to be had"
"<b>flat-batted down the ground!</b> It ain't pretty, but it's mighty effective. Fakhar clears his left leg and hacks at a length delivery, getting a good connection to send the ball back over young Ilyas' head, and that's also the <b>team fifty up</b> at the end of the Powerplay"
"looped down on middle and off, Butt looks to manufacture something but he can't get it away"

"<b>the top edge sails all the way!</b> Fakhar's clearly got a good eye, he must have quite some bat too. He bent into a slog sweep but looked to have top edged this one, only for the ball to keep going and going all the way over the boundary"
"Butt turns the strike back over once again, with a single off his pads"
"back of a length and very nippy from Junaid, the ball zipping past Fakhar's swat into the leg side and striking him on the body"
"<b>another scoop</b> and this one also comes off handsomely! The ball was on a length and straight, and he picked the length up early - as well as noting that the fielder was up at short fine leg. He got it up and over him, and that also <b>brings up the team 100</b>"
"<b>Junaid Khan strikes in his first over</b> and it's a huge blow! Fakhar took on the fielder at deep midwicket, but he didn't get as much of a connection as he would have liked and Evans held a simple catch in that position. This will dent the chase just a little ..."

"Taylor's off the mark straight away, but he's in some serious trouble too. He tapped the ball into the leg side, but as soon as he set off something went in his calf, and he completed the single in apparently severe discomfort. He's helped to the ground by the opposition players at the other end, clutching his calf, and the physio runs out to attend to him. This is not good. He has to be helped, limping, from the field. He may have torn a calf muscle, and he's unable to continue"
"there's a beautiful crunch off the bat as de Villiers places a length delivery through point, and they press hard for a third run ... but what's this, AB drops his bat pushing for the third run, and he has to sprint extra hard to get his foot in in time. Fortunately for his team, he does so"

"Wiese charges the bowler, but he can't do much with a yorker outside off, jabbing it through point"
"<b>AB misses out!</b> Junaid bustles in and delivers a wide full toss outside off. De Villiers doesn't manage to put bat to ball, and it's not called wide - though it was marginal"
"<b>sliced over extra cover!</b> As soon as it's there to be hit, AB does so. Junaid only misses his length by a couple of inches, but de Villiers punished him for it, bending very low to get under the ball and hammer it over extra cover"
"that's better from Junaid, right up to the bat and AB can't get underneath it"
"<b>a wicket off a no-ball!</b> Wiese was aiming for the stands but sliced right underneath the ball, Malik running across from the covers to hold an excellent high catch under pressure.
