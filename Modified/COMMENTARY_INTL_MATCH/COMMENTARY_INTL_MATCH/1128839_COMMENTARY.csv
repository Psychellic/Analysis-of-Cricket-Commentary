that's awful luck for the bowler. It's a back of a length and pretty accurate on the stumps and Denly shapes for a pull. Just that the ball keeps a little low and he gets an under edge to fine leg

now he goes through cover. Viljoen is attempting a wide yorker and instead sends down a horrible half-volley outside off that's crashed with hard hands

"<b>has that been caught?</b> Shehzad with a dive at deep midwicket and a smart catch. He's claiming the catch but the umpires are going to refer this upstairs. A short of a length delivery that's been pulled away and Shehzad runs to his right, gathers it with both hands, and gets down with the momentum as he completes the catch. Moves towards the ropes slightly and ends up inches before the boundary. Seems clean. The ball boy behind him is very enthusiastically raising his finger. He had the best real-time view, to be fair. And the TV umpire  flashes a big red OUT"
"fullish length, loads of width on offer, clears the front leg and thumps it over long-on. Viljoen is living a dreadful nightmare here"

"short ball, Shehzad muscles a pull to deep midwicket but it's <b>one short</b> as he hasn't dragged the bat over the line. He stretched alright, but you gotta be careful to ensure you get those things right"
"ah, how much more frustrating can it get for a bowler! A short ball again, Shehzad is completely cramped for room on the pull and to his good fortune the top-edge sails over the keeper"

"length ball, keeps a little low as he presses forward and defends"
"that's the sweetest way to gift a wicket. Steps blindly down the track without making an effort to suss out the length. Credit to the bowler for flighting it, but pre-meditated from Shehzad who ends up awkwardly attempting to defend at it. Misses and the keeper does the rest"

You're not supposed to do that, of course"

It's all coming crashing down rather rapidly for the Sultans. And Afridi's having a field day"
"front-foot defense, gets an inside edge to the leg side"

"on a length and slanted across, now he waits for it and opens the face. Finds short third man but the non-striker, who's the best judge of the run, calls for it nonetheless. And straightaway too. Caught well short of his crease. Another one comes and goes. This has been a listless performance"

"is that a no-ball? Could be a run out as well. Rather, they're appealing for it. Upstairs we go. Releases it at a pretty awkward height. And that seems a certain no-ball. Tanvir pulled it to deep midwicket who took the catch. No-ball declared. Free-hit coming up"
maximises the opportunity with a straight and flat six. Too full and he chipped it slightly off the bottom part of the bat but enough power to carry all the way
