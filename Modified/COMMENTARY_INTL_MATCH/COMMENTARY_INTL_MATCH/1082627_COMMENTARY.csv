"lovely start. Full and wide outside off, Warner comes down, looking to drive but misses. Beaten by quite a distance"
"mis-directed this time. On the pads and Warner flicks away through midwicket for a couple. Kuldeep at mid-on gets across, but knocks the ball on"
"good length delivery outside off, solidly blocked into the off side. Loud yelp of 'nooo'"
"goes up and over. Good batting. Full and rather wide from Coulter-Nile. Warner knows what he wants to do all along, gets underneath the length and lifts the ball over mid-off for four. Superb execution"
"juuust short of mid-off. Full and wide again, closer than the previous delivery though. Warner hammers a slap to Umesh at mid-off who gets across and takes the ball on the bounce. The umpires just want to double-check. <strong>Soft signal not-out</strong>, third umpire's decision not-out. Umesh said he didn't know. Suppose they have to check."
"good finish from Coulter-Nile. Length delivery outside off, pushed towards cover. Decent over for both sides"
"good length outside off, too wide, left alone"
"good length delivery outside off, chopped away towards backward point for a run. The fielder stops the ball but can't prevent the run"
"that's gone the distance. Can't bowl there. Overpitched outside off, Warner always knows that with his power, he doesn't need to keep it down. Muscularly pummels a lofted drive over mid-off. Have to pull that length back"
"that's a better length to Warner. Shortish outside off, scythed towards point. As long as you're not too wide, that's quite a safe area to Warner. He can open that face late though"
"slower ball, pace off the ball on off. Dhawan pushes one to mid-on"
"I think he misjudged that. Such a big moment in this game. Back of a length outside off, some movement. Moving away. Warner looks to pull but the ball bounces extra and seams away, very much like his dismissal against Morris earlier this season. Since, he was looking to hit that in front of square, it goes over mid-on. Woakes backtracks but doesn't get a hand on it. Had lots of time, could have hared back and then improvised, not easy at all."
"there it is. Not a bad ball, good length, fifth-stump line. Warner just lets the ball come onto him before deflecting a cut really late to get it behind backward point. Credit to Warner"
"that's huge. Cannot get much better than this. Fantastic batting. Full and straight, Warner stays inside the line and just sweeps the ball over short fine leg. Great batting. Take pace off the ball!"
"it's a short slow delivery outside off, pulled to midwicket. Not great timing"
"yes, much better. An offcutter on middle and leg, clipped to midwicket for a run"
"that will be Dhawan's role this innings till Warner's there. Short and wide, looks for one, but can only find point"
"maybe not. A slower delivery outside off, Dhawan stays low and nails a slog sweep over midwicket. Not a bad delivery, in terms of line and length, but that is clever proactive batting"
"drops short on off, pulled to mid-on. Lucky that didn't go"
"this has gone. Flat on middle and leg, Warner gets underneath the length and sweeps over short fine leg."
playing with the field here. Knows Warner is destructive when he comes to the pitch so he drops short. Warner knows it's going to be short. he stays back and hammers a flat slap over cover
"short again, tripe from Yusuf. Sits up for Warner and he lays into a pull, waaay over midwicket. Sensational batting"
"the first delivery that is full this over. Full and straight, worked to deep midwicket for a couple. Warner is on 43!"
it's the last ball so he picks a single to midwicket to keep strike.
"who cares? <b>That's Warner's fifty in 25 balls</b>. The team's 25 balls that is. Wow. Gets low, and just switch-hits the ball over short third man.Goes the distance too, that's ridiculously good batting"
strays down leg for a wide
"flat on middle and leg, looks for one through midwicket but misses. First one he's missed tonight?"
short and wide this time. Sits up for Warner who is waiting on the back foot. He then lays into a flat-batted punch through cover
"clever batting. Flat delivery down leg, he wanted to go over short fine leg but got a thick top edge which flew over fine leg. Yusuf does well to save on with a dive"
"flat on middle and leg, Dhawan looks for a paddle but fails to connect"
gets forward and pushes a flighted delivery to long-off with the spin
"Dhawan takes him on. Flat outside off, Dhawan sits back and hammers a pull to the long-on boundary, all too easy now"
"<strong>Uthappa misses a stumping</strong>. Fantastic bowling. Should have been stumped. The googly, slow on middle. Dhawan comes down but the ball goes through a massive gap between bat and pad. Uthappa doesn't pick the variation either, the ball drifts on and Uthappa can't collect"
"flat down leg, ricochets off Uthappa's pads for an extra run"
"another switch-hit. Flat, may have been the googly again. And then intentionally hits the ball over point for four. Sensational batting"
"what was happening? Another googly on middle, pushed towards point. Warner is hesitant, Dhawan calls for the run. Warner goes on. The under-arm is good but Uthappa isn't behind the stumps"
hit up towards mid-off
"goes down leg again, another wide. Uthappa fails to collect again"
"flat on off, pushed up towards cover"
drops short does Umesh. Warner says thanks. Sits back and muscles a pull over midwicket. Humongous hit

"they keep bowling short to him. Another one that digs in on middle, pulled to deep square leg"
"short delivery outside off, pulled up to long-off. Warner not happy he didn't hit the ball through or over cover"

a deft sweep to short fine leg
"another switch-hit. Nails it again. Wow. Flat delivery on off, Warner gets low and crisply nails it through point. Sensational stuff"
"dropped! Woakes drops another dolly. One of the easier catches. A googly outside off, Warner goes back and slaps a lofted drive but cannot get enough on it. Woakes runs to his right and spills a sitter. Parries it for six too. Closed the fingertips too early there"
"another googly on middle, Warner plonks a front foot down and slog-sweeps the ball over long-on for six. <strong>He moves to 98!</strong>"

"a wide yorker, Dhawan chops a cut to the keeper. DOT!"
"he's gone. Fantastic fielding from short fine leg, Kuldeep yadav. A short slow delivery outside off, Dhawan pulls to short fine leg on the bounce. Warner calls him through. But Dhawan is perched on the back foot so he has to gather momentum and make extra strides. In all that time, Kuldeep picked up and threw the stumps down at the bowler's end."
"full and wide, driven to cover. Another dot, three in a row now"
"a shortish slow delivery on off, cut out to the sweeper cover. Good comeback that from Woakes"

another good delivery. Looking for the yorker but misses it. Played back
"runs to the pitch and gets there. A full delivery on middle, Warner hits it hard, flat towards long-on. Pandey runs across, somehow gets a hand on it and the ball goes away for four. Fantastic effort from Pandey"

superb. Great batting. Was anticipating a yorker but it's a slower delivery outside off so he gets underneath the length and laps the ball over the keeper for four

"short delivery on middle, pulled to deep midwicket. Just one"
"superb yorker, worked away to deep midwicket. Coulter-Nile gets across, gets to the ball, and returns the throw to the keeper. Should have been two there but Yuvraj selfishly sends Williamson back, who is run-out. Williamson isn't please Yuvraj didn't come back. That was not good running from Yuvraj, not a good innings from him, no intent at all."
"pretty full and wide, almost in the block hole, Narine swings and misses"
"full and wide again, Narine gets toe end of the bat this time for a single to third man"

"looking for the yorker again but it's a low full toss with a wee bit of room and Gambhir drives it down from the off stump, straight enough from the middle to beat mid off"
"angles it across from length, Narine swings through the line and misses it outside off"
"can't stay out of action, Warner takes the catch to send Narine back. Narine got his front foot out of the way early to make room, Siraj pitched it straight and Narine tried to loft it over the covers but didn't get enough and Warner ran back a little, facing the boundary, to get under it in time and catch with both hands"

"pretty straight and tight on off stump, Gambhir blocks it back with a straight bat"
"that's gone a long long way into the sky, three men come under and a teenager called Rashid Khan takes it easily before spreading his arms, the crowd erupts! Short of length delivery, Gambhir tried to swat-pull it and it went towards wide long-on, but well inside the ropes. Rashid went back, Bhuvi ran from mid-on and Dhawan from deep midwicket only for Rashid to pouch it. Wow, replays show it was the knuckle ball..."
"angles it down the leg side, could have been a wide but flicks the pad"
"better line - angling into Uthappa around middle and leg, pushed down to mid-on now"
"angling in again, might have expected it and swats it away between mid-on and midwicket to get off the mark"
"138kph, no movement and outside off, quick enough as Pandey cuts and misses"
"some room this time and Pandey cuts it successfully, to third man for one"
leans into the ball a little and defends into the off side
"it's not full, but it has enough room and Uthappa swings his arms with some power to send that crashing through the covers along the ground"
"delicate stuff, nicely done for four! Pitched it well outside off, Uthappa didn't move much, waited for the ball and nudged it late enough to beat the wide slip and early enough to avoid the keeper"
"just a bit of room, Uthappa finds Yuvraj at point with a cut"
"he makes room, Kaul angles it in even more and Pandey is struck on the pad outside leg for a dot"
"opens up again, this time he takes it on the full and drills it straight down just past Uthappa to beat mid-on for four. Not sure he got the middle, but he got enough"
"better length to angle it in, Pandey defends towards off and gets the nod for a quick single"
"hint of away movement outside off from length, Uthappa defends carefully towards cover point for one more"
too full and he's smashed that in the air just over Kaul's shoulder. Right on the middle stump and Pandey crashed it back before Kaul could react and he beat long-on too
"call for a quick single, Pandey runs hard and Rashid has a shy at bowler's end and <strong>misses</strong>. Pandey nudged the slower delivery to the leg side and took off immediately, Rashid sprang in too but needed a direct hit"

"132kph, short of length with bounce again, he dabs the ball to midwicket"
"slow offcutter at 115kph, but it's a touch too short and Uthappa swats it to deep midwicket"
"another cutter to end the over, Pandey is alert and opens up to push it past mid-on with a cross bat and even beats wide long-on for four"

"tries to nudge it late this time with the turn, misses again"

"he opens up to swing, and pulls the short of length ball to deep midwicket"
"129kph, works the ball angling into him to the leg side"
rolls his wrists over that length ball to help it to long on
"Yuvraj tries the direct hit at keeper's end, misses! He hits the batsman's bat instead. It was just outside off, Uthappa defended with soft hands for a quick single and took off, but Yuvraj could not get the stumps"
"another first ball from Rashid is dispatched to leg for six from Uthappa! This one was much bigger and he lofted it against the turn over wide long on. Not as big, but big enough"
"bit too short, maybe Uthappa expected that and he went back in the crease to slap-pull that to the umpire's right for a powerful four"

"the flatter delivery on off stump, he goes back and nudges to leg to come back for the second"

charges down first ball and slogs it in the gap between long on and deep midwicket for two

"short and wide, Pandey dances down and slams it to deep point"
"goes across outside off and tries to sweep-scoop, but only gets an inside edge onto his pad and they take a single. Siraj does well to get a direct hit at bowler's end but Uthappa was in"
"slightly short and wide again, he lofts it over the covers in the gap for two more. Doubles serving the purpose till now"
pivots on the back foot and slaps the ball to the left of deep midwicket. It's in the gap for two more
"a bit of a <strong>juggle</strong> and Bhuvneshwar takes a return catch! It was slightly slower, Pandey had gone across to work it to leg but the ball was outside off on length and his bat ended up straight to pop the catch back to Bhuvi. It went straight to him around shoulder height but bounced off the hands before he caught it again"
"that's one way to take the pressure off! Makes room against a cutter, it was short of length and he absolutely hammered that over deep midwicket, his favourite area today"
"another slower delivery, he swings again but gets an inside edge towards the keeper for one"
"ball angles in towards the stumps, he bunts it to leg for one"
"place the 12th man in the second tier, I say! Shortish ball, Uthappa was on the prowl well before the ball came to him and middled it to the leg side again. That's his <b>fifty</b> too"

"goes on the back foot, it's not too short but he manages a pull for one"
