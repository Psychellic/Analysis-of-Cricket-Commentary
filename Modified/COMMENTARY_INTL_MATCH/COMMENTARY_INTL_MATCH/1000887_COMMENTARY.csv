"nice start. 139 kph, good length delivery on off, the ball seaming away. Warner can only defend. Keep six there."
"a tad wider this time. Good length outside off, some movement. Away swing. Warner wafts and the ball goes past. Warner has had his problems against Boult, the ball moving away."
"lovely stuff from Amir. Nice and full on off, inviting the ball to swing. Warner defends to mid-off"
"143 kph, another defensive nudge into the off side towards point"
"the first wayward one of the day. Back of a length down leg, Warner leaves. A wide called"
"141 kph good length outside off, prodded into the off side. Good lines these"
"143 kph, pushed towards cover off the good length. A nice gentle push. Lovely start from Amir"
"not nice. A low full toss to start, drilled to cover"
"another naughty full toss on off, driven down towards mid-off for a quick run. Hafeez hasn't done too much bowling in the recent past"
"nice. Flat on off, no turn. Warner goes back, chops the ball towards point"
"darted in on leg, Warner gets forward to defend. Nice length"
Warner comes down and squeezes a drive towards extra cover. Warner made that into a full toss with his feet
pushed back to the bowler. A tidy start
"142 kph, good length delivery moving away, a thick outside skew races down to third man. Just one"
"145 kph, good length on middle, inside-edged towards square leg. Warner still on 0"
"there is Warner's first. Full delivery, straight, a thick inside edge down to fine leg. Nice length this from Amir, seeing if the ball will swing"
dabbed down to third man with an angled bat. Not much movement of the feet
"<strong>jaffa</strong>. Takes something similar to beat Warner. Good length on off, the ball swerves away and beats the outside edge. Warner's feet were rooted in the crease"
"another one. 144 kph. Superb bowling. Warner had enough, stayed in the crease and attempted a leaden-footed uppish drive but there is some swing, the ball pitches and moves away to <strong>beat the outside edge again</strong>."
"flat and wide outside off, hit hard to extra cover"
"slow through the air, a bit of loop an drift. Pushed back"
this is a tad too full and Head smashes an on-drive to long-on
goes over midwicket this time for the first boundary of the day. Runs down to the pitch and shovels a flick over midwicket. Safe once he got to the pitch
"too straight, flicked down to fine leg"
"flight on off, pushed to mid-off"
"141 kph, fullish delivery outside off, driven through cover for one"
"143 kph, on the pads, Head gets on his toes and flicks down to fine leg for a run"
"what a delivery! He has been doing it all afternoon. Superb bowling. Amir pushes this one fuller and straighter. Warner sees something on middle and chooses to flick into the leg side but is undone by substantial away swing. The ball beats the flick by some distance and clips the top of the bails. Wow, he wasn't close to that. Not a great shot."
"edged and gone! Another peach from Amir. Fantastic captaincy from Azhar, after all the flak he's received. Bowls it full and wide. Asks Smith to drive through the vacant cover region. Smith can't say no with his form, can he? His feet are rooted in the crease, his drive is away from his body. The ball holds its line outside off and takes the edge. A routine catch for Rizwan."
"nicely bowled from Amir. Full and straight, some inswing. Lynn flicks to square leg"
"145 kph, outside off on a length, well left by Lynn"
"good length on off, driven towards mid-off for one"
"good length outside off, 138 kph, driven through cover for one. Loud cheers from his home crowd"
"137 kph, strays down leg, a run down to fine leg"
"creamed through cover. Full and wide from Hasan. Lynn thrashes his drive to cover who half-stops the ball. Parried away towards the deep cover boundary. Azhar chases it down, but four runs are run"
"bouncer on off, too short. Lynn gets underneath. Wide called"
"nice. A good length on off, pushed away towards mid-off"
"big appeal! No says the umpire. Good length delivery around off, the ball nips back in and cuts Lynn in half. A noise, probably off the thigh pad, on its way to the keeper."
"full and straight from Amir, Head is hanging on the back foot but is able to defend"
"good length outside off, 146 kph, driven towards cover from the back foot"
"143 kph, good call from Lynn. Back of a length delivery outside off, the ball swerves back in. A thick inside edge into the pad, towards short leg. Lynn calls Head through even though the batsman has no idea where the ball has gone"
"through cover. Good length outside off, Lynn stays in the crease and punches through cover for three. Nicely executed"
"144 kph, good length a tad wide outside off, cut away towards point"
"nice end. 142 kph, fullish on off, blocked back"
smashed. Back of a length from Hasan Ali and Lynn BBL's the ball way into the stands. A heave waaaaay over midwicket. Just so easy for Lynn
"back of a length outside off, pushed away towards cover for one"
"140 kph, fullish on off, driven towards cover for a couple more"
"137 kph, full and straight, driven to mid-on. No swing for Hasan Ali"
"on the pads, poor bowling this. Flicked through midwicket. Such a long boundary that four runs are run with time to spare"
"135 kph, fullish delivery around off, driven to cover from the crease"
"digs one in on off, so high that it loops over Lynn. Don't have to be so short at the Gabba. A back of a length is ideal here"
"143 kph, better, more like it. Back of a length on middle and leg, swatted to deep square leg for one. Hustled Lynn for pace"
"poor bowling. Short and wide outside off, Head stays back and drills a back-foot punch through cover. Easily hit"
"short and wide this time, rubbish. Head stands tall and scythes a cut through point this time. Four more."
"oh my, Wahab helping Australia out with a buffet of help-yourself deliveries. I wouldn't mind this. Short and wide again, Head crashes a cut through point for four more."
"141 kph, punched towards point. Slightly closer to off."
"decent end to a quite terrible over. On a length outside off, pushed into the off side"
"136 kph, on a length around off, pushed back to the bowler"
"that isn't a great shot and Lynn falls. Another BBL stroke. Slower delivery this time, full and wide. Lynn just chooses the wrong shot. Premeditated. Could have clattered that over the off side, but he got down on one knee and slog-swept a drag-flick straight into the air. Rizwan runs around, doesn't look to comfortable underneath the skier but importantly, takes the catch. Had to drag that from too wide."
"full and wide from Hasan. Tripe. Drilled through cover. All timing, lots of power too."
full and wide again. Tear-your-hair-out bowling. Head leans on this and finds the gap through cover for four more. This time from around the wicket.
"much much better. Full and straight, 139 kph, Head defends"
"fullish, better line, sixth-stump line outside off. A thick outside edge down to third man"
"shortish and a tad wide, no spin. Played to point from the back foot"
"ooh, flat and wide outside off, no turn. Marsh is still beaten on the outside edge"
"flat and straight, Marsh goes back to defend"
"nice and straight, full, pushed back to the bowler"
"too straight, some flight, driven towards midwicket"
"good over that. Flat and wide outside off, chopped towards cover"
"shortish and wide, Head goes right back and slaps the ball to long-off from the back foot"
"a tad slow on off and middle, punched to long-on from the back foot"
"slow through the air outside off, pushed to point. Better length from Hafeez"
"too full this time, pushed back to the bowler"
"shortish around off, punched out towards cover"
drilled to long-off from the crease
"flat and wide from Wasim, cut towards short third man"
"beaten on the outside edge. Skids on with the arm, wide outside off. Head misses his waft"
"flat and straight, no spin. Skewed off the outside half towards deep point"
"flat on the pads, Marsh misses his flick, struck on the thigh pad"
"driven to long-off for one, 102 kph"
"edged and gone. Wasim strikes. Pakistan chipping away. Head looked all at sea against the non-turning spin of Wasim. A flat delivery outside off, skids on with the arm again. Head looks to slap a drive through cover but plays inside the line, like he has been doing against Wasim. The ball kisses the outside edge and settles in Rizwan's gloves. Good catch too"
"flat on middle, pushed out to long-on. An easy single, why give him one there?"
worked towards midwicket
"short and wide, that's a poor ball. Cut through cover for a couple from the back foot"
"ooh, Maxwell plays for some spin, not much there, a leading edge back to the bowler"
worked towards square leg
"nice bowling, Slow through the air, some flight outside off, defended. 'Jaldi karo,' (hurry up) screams Riwan. Not a bad tactic that, get through overs without these two noticing"
"91 kph, pushed away towards midwicket. Another dot"
"well bowled, slow through the air, some flight, spin too. Defended towards point"
"quick on leg, pushed to a straight midwicket"
"slow again through the air outside off, pushed to long-off. A bit in the air"
"short on middle, punched to long-on"
"flat on off and middle, played back"
"offcutter on off, played into the leg side"
"144 kph, another terrible delivery from Wahab. Short and wide, scythed behind point for four. This isn't good bowling"
much better. Good length on a fifth-stump line. The ball deviates past the bat
"too straight this time, nudged down to fine leg"
"well left. On a length outside off, left alone. Rizwan fails to collect cleanly, almost hits the helmet positioned behind him"
"fullish outside off, defended into the off side, and <strong>drinks</strong>"
"length ball angling into middle and off, no turn. Maxwell shows the full face to push to long-on"
"this time there is some turn, and Marsh nicks off! That excellent length again, never quite up there to drive, on off stump. Marsh chances the drive, and only manages a thin edge through to Rizwan"
"slated across, and Wade gets across, gets down low, and lap-sweeps from just outside off, into the short fine-leg region"
"fullish on leg stump, clipped through square leg"
"sweeps again, against the angle. It's a bit of a risk given the drift Imad gets away from the left-hander, but Wade manages to play it safely enough into the fine leg region"
"fired in flat on the stumps, Maxwell shows the full face to defend to midwicket"
"shortish outside off, Wade lets it come on and dabs down to third man"
"length ball angling away from off stump, Maxwell gets across to push into the covers"
"bouncer, off-target, ends up angling it a fair way down the leg side"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended with an open face towards point"
"length ball, and was that a tiny bit of inward swerve towards middle stump, maybe some seriously early reverse? No worries for Wade just yet, lets it come on and clips quietly through midwicket"
"shortish on off stump, defended towards point"
"back of a length on off stump, punched to sweeper cover"
"length ball swerving in towards off stump, check-driven to long-off"
"fullish, angling away from off stump, gets nicely forward to block it back to the bowler"
"back of a length outside off, punched to short extra-cover"
"back of a length, a little closer to off stump, shuffles across and tucks it into the leg side for a risky single. Direct hit would have had Maxwell at the striker's end, but Akmal, moving to his left from midwicket, can't hit the stumps"
"back of a length on middle stump, defended back to the bowler"
"floated up slow on middle and off, stretches out and rolls his wrists over to play that watchfully to mid-on. Another excellent over from Imad"
"back of a length close to off stump, gets back and across to defend back to the bowler"
"back of a length, angling in towards off stump. Shuffles across to work it wide of mid-on"
"short on middle and off, gets across and whips it away through backward square leg"

"back of a length on off stump, goes back and across to work it through square leg"
"down the track skips Maxwell, Imad fires it quicker, punched back to the bowler"
"down the track again, and again Imad bowls flatter but along a straighter line. Maxwell clips neatly through midwicket"
"back of a length, a bit of inward movement, and Wade is <b>given out lbw!</b> He's reviewed this immediately, convinced he's inside-edged it. He has. Poor shot from Wade, feet rooted to the crease and he looks to drive on the up, down the ground. Ball nips in off the seam and hits back pad, off the inside edge"
"shortish outside off, Wade goes deep in his crease and stabs to backward point"
"full, fairly wide outside off. Wade goes after it without moving his feet too much, edges it thickly, but it's well wide of slip and races away to the third man boundary"
"length ball angling into off stump, Wade steps across and clips to midwicket"
"fullish on off stump, whipped to deep backward square leg"
loses his line with the change of strike. This would have been a perfect off-stump ball to Wade. Maxwell clips it off his pad to the left of deep square leg
"fullish on off stump, clipped against the angle to midwicket"
"back of a length, angling across the left-hander, who shuffles across and flicks from outside off to midwicket"
"fuller, on off stump now, Wade clips through backward square leg"
"down the track and that's smartly bowled. Slows it down a bit, pulls the length back, and Maxwell has to defend into the covers, with the turn"
"length ball on middle and leg, clipped to deep square leg"
"fired in flat, back of a length, angling into off stump. Blocked back to the bowler"
"tossed up outside off, and that's lovely from Maxwell, full extension of the arms to lift that gently over the covers, finds the gap to the right of the sweeper. He's batting with a cap on now, made that shot look even better"
"length ball outside off, Maxwell opens his bat face to drive to point"
"down the track now, and that's a nice bit of old-fashioned ODI batting. Nawaz fired it into his pads, and he whipped it in the air, but checked his shot, to hit it on the bounce to long-on"
"good ball, a bit of loop and dip outside off. Wade stretches out to defend, gets an inside-edge that rolls to short fine leg"
"chips down the track now, gets close to the pitch and flicks to deep midwicket"
"quickish, back of a length, angling into off stump. Maxwell goes on the back foot and whips it wristily back to the bowler"
"quickish length ball outside off, stretches out and defends into the covers"
"flat, back of a length, angling into off stump. Goes back and across to work into the leg side. Hasan Ali takes his eye off the ball while sliding to his left from midwicket to field it"
"shot! Fired in on a good length, and Maxwell uses the angle adroitly, gets forward and uses his bottom wrist brilliantly to shovel-sweep from outside off, into the long leg region"
"length ball angling into the stumps, gets on the front foot and works it to the left of deep square leg"
"down the track now, Imad shortens his length outside off. Maxwell pushes with a straight bat to mid-on"
"a bit of flight on off stump, and Maxwell absolutely smashes that. A slap-sweep with a roll of the wrists to drill that to the midwicket boundary"
"again looks to work a ball from outside off to fine leg. Turns more than he expects as he comes on the front foot and it goes past his inside edge and hits front pad. Not too much of an appeal, that was probably headed down leg"
"down the track now, clips with the turn to long-on"
"length ball outside off, presses forward to defend into the covers"
"shot. This is glorious from Maxwell. Third man and backward point were both in the circle, Nawaz gave him the perfect line, floated up outside off, and those quick hands are through the ball in a blur to reverse-sweep between the two fielders"
"down the track now, and that's lovely. A checked chip, on the bounce, to long-on, played with the full face of the bat showing"
"there's that Wade trademark again. Stretches out to a length ball pitching outside off and rolls his wrists over to play it to short fine leg. Wanted a single, and Maxwell, rightly, sent him back"
"back of a length on middle and off, whipped through square leg"
"back of a length on middle stump, tucked down to long leg"
"short ball over off stump, pulled to deep square leg"
"back of a length on leg stump, worked through backward square leg. They chance a second, throw is at the bowler's end, and make it fairly easily. Would have been interesting had Wahab's throw been closer to the bowler"
"fullish on off stump, driven back to the bowler"
"length ball outside off, driven to short cover"
"flat, angling into leg stump, Maxwell goes for the reverse-sweep again. He's working against the angle, but he's not bothered, those wrists do all the work to hit it in the air to the backward point boundary"
"length ball on middle and off, Maxwell gets on the front foot to defend back down the pitch"
"oh my, nearly gets himself out in bizarre fashion. Goes for that chip-drive to the flighted ball outside off. Great spot from Ian Chappell on TV commentary. Saw that Maxwell's bat had hit his front pad before meeting bat, changing its course slightly. May have wanted to drive that ball over the covers, instead ends up hitting towards long-off sprinting in from the rope. Dives forward desperately but can't reach the ball in time to catch it"
"flat on middle stump, clipped through midwicket"
"down the track now, clips into the midwicket region"
"once again, Wade works a ball off the stumps into the leg side"

"short outside off, looks for the horizontal-bat slap, the ball hits the outside half of the bat and runs down to third man"
"back of a length outside off, punched to deep point"
"back of a length on middle stump, worked to the left of midwicket"
"length ball close to off stump, looks to drive through mid-off, maybe, doesn't time it and it ends up going slowly to the left of short cover. Another easily taken quick single"
"shortish on middle stump, maybe not short enough to pull. Wade is a little late on the shot and the ball hits his stomach"
"I don't know if he meant that. Short ball, angling away from off stump. Maxwell was leaving that, I think, and the ball ended up hitting the middle of his bat as he pulls it back behind him and running down to third man"
"back of a length outside off, dabbed down to the right of backward point. I think they picked the right fielder to chance another quick single against. It was Imad Wasim, and he's left-handed, and he fumbled as he tried to pick up and transfer hands"
"short on off stump, rises on his toes to defend into the off side"
"short down leg, Maxwell misses his pull and it's given wide. Pakistan appeal for a caught behind. Replays confirm there was no bat anywhere near the ball"
"short on leg stump, pulled to the right of deep square leg"
"beaten. Goes on the back foot to slash that through point, but it probably wasn't short enough, and he ended up going with a diagonal bat"
"short slower ball outside off, Wade lets it come on and squeezes it to backward point, rolling his wrists over at the top of the bounce"
"good ball, length ball angling into middle and off. Maxwell wanted some room to flay that through the covers. Had to check his shot in the end while playing it to short extra"
"bouncer outside off, maybe the slower bouncer. Maxwell wanted to pull, but it rises too high for that and he aborts his shot"
"short outside off, this time it rises to the perfect height to pull, just around chest height, and he puts it away between midwicket and mid-on"
"back-of-a-length slower ball, looks like the offcutter, comes in a little bit and cramps Maxwell as he skips away from the line to hit through the off side. Ends up having to play that to midwicket instead"
"length ball on off stump, punched to short extra"
"short ball on off stump, this one is dug in with more venom, bounces steeply, and Maxwell has to pull it from over his right shoulder. Ends up top-edging very fine, to the left of third man"
"gone! Hasan Ali has varied his pace beautifully in this over, and he does Maxwell with another little offcutter. Looks to flick it over midwicket, is through his shot too early, and it loops up off the high part of his bat and midwicket takes the simplest of catches"
"a fullish length outside off, dabbed towards backward point"
"slower delivery outside off, a deft dab towards backward point with an angled bat. Played well"
"full and wide outside off, Faulkner gets forward and leaves"

"Wade runs down but Nawaz shortens the length, improvised nudge to midwicket"
gets down closer to the pitch to flick to deep midwicket
"nice. Flat on off, blocked into the off side"
"90 kph, edged and gone. Faulkner falls. Pakistan strike again. Good captaincy to have the slip in place and Faulkner edges behind. A lovely length, shortish but close to off, Extracts a bit if turn, Faulkner plays away from his body and gets a thick outside edge which is well held by Hafeez at first slip, to his left. That came quickly."
"slow through the air, outside off, driven to cover"
"83 kph, gets down to the pitch of the ball and drive to long-on"

"played down to fine leg. Excellent fielding, quick to ensure there's no one"
flicked off the straight line to deep backward square leg
"slow through the air and straight, played back"

"gets to the pitch, Nawaz fires it wide outside off. Wade still goes through with a nice clean swing and lofts the ball just past long-on for six. <strong>Fifty for Wade</strong>, a lovely fighting knock"

"good length outside off, Cummins slashes and misses. Beaten by the bounce"
"bouncer down leg, tennis-ball bouncer down leg, wide called"
"run-out! A total breakdown in communication. Cummins dabbed to point, called yes and stopped. Wade responded to Cummins' initial call and kept going. Akmal picked up cleanly at point and threw the ball back to Amir, who had returned to the stumps to collect the ball. He takes off the bails and Cummins is well short. A good piece of fielding."
"on the pads, worked down to fine leg"
"a slow high full toss outside off. The legcutter gone wrong. Wade completely surprised, tries a dab to third man but misses"
"fantastic execution. Gave himself room, then got right across to scoop the ball through fine leg for four. Got a good length delivery outside off"
"142 kph, dabbed towards backward point"

"good bouncer. Directed at the badge, Wade gets a thick top edge which flies down to the fine leg boundary"
"short, slow legcutter outside off, swatted down to deep square leg for one"
he tries. But dishes out one full and straight that is pushed to long-on for a run

"a low full toss outside off, driven to mid-off"
"132 kph, on a length down leg, flicked down to deep fine leg for one. A whip off the hips"
"what was the fielder doing? <strong>That was awful fielding</strong>. Back of a length on middle and leg, Starc pulls and gets enough to clear the boundary. Sharjeel was a few metres inside the field, trotted back, and watched the ball go over his head. Gave up on it soooo early. He could have got back and easily taken the catch inside the field of play. A costly error"
"a yorker on off, jammed back to the bowler who leaps and parries to mid-on"
"a low full toss on off, driven to long-on"
"134 kph, full on off, Wade wanted to go straight but skewed the ball towards midwicket. Hafeez dives to his right to prevent additional runs"
"a nice slower ball, Starc is way too early through his stroke. Just over the stumps"
"cleans 'im up. An offcutter that doesn't cut. Full and straight from Hasan Ali. Starc is nowhere near the ball as he misses his flick. The zing bails fly everywhere. Excellent bowling, totally deceived him with a change-down in pace"

"excellent bowling. Well played too. Yorker on off, jammed away towards gully"
"full and straight from Hasan, Wade gets underneath the length and heaves over midwicket. Long-on can't get across"
a nice slower bouncer. Wade dances down but misses his heave. Beaten for pace. Nice change-down
"four more. A yorker on off, a thick outside edge races down to the third man boundary. Wade moves to 85"
"slower delivery down leg, Wade top-edges his heave towards square leg. Lands in no-man's land"
"121 kph, on the pads, Stanlake misses his flick. Rapped on the pad"
"big appeal. Not out says the umpire. Looked like bat on pad, not ball. <b>Pakistan review. </b>A big noise but the ball missed bat by some distance. Full delivery outside off, Stanlake is beaten"
"a low full toss on middle, 140 kph, heaved to midwicket. Beaten by the length of that, spliced away"

shovelled to long-on for a couple. Stanlake races down for two.
"142 kph, Wade gets across and nudged down to fine leg."
"119 kph, slower short ball down leg. Wade misses his heave and is thwacked on the stomach. Youch!"
"full on middle and leg, Wade gives himself room and lofts the ball through cover for four more"
"slower delivery on middle, Wade is too early through his heave. Beaten"
"another short slow delivery down leg, Wade got forward, wanted to dab one through the leg side for two but can't make contact"
"he gets there. How did he make that? Short delivery on leg, pulled towards square leg. The keeper gets there but returns a bad throw off-balance. Hasan fumbles his collection. Onto 99"
"a leading edge to point and Wade gets hundred. Another slower ball on middle, Wade gets enough bat to get the run he required for his <b>maiden ODI hundred</b>. Screams in delight, the dressing room and the Gabba are all up. A fantastic knock this from Wade"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"full, a bit of swing in from outside off. Azhar drives crisply but straight to short extra-cover"
"length ball, goes wider outside off this time, no swing this time. Azhar leaves it alone"
"ooh, this one is fuller, threatens to swing in towards off stump but doesn't quite do as much as Azhar expects. Looks to drive through mid-off, gets a thick edge down to third man"
"drifts onto the pads, clipped to short fine leg"
"full, slanting down leg, doesn't bend back enough towards the stumps for Starc to make a confident lbw appeal as Sharjeel misses his flick"
"starts with a good ball, fourth-stump line, good length, away swing. Azhar leaves. He's a tall man with what seems a very side-on, slingy, Shoaib-esque release, without the humongous run-up and the wild hair and the crazy pace. A bit of a pause in his jump as well. So not really like Shoaib."
"short and wide, Azhar misses out, doesn't go hard at the cut and fails to connect anyway"
"short and wide again, cut straight to backward point"
"back of a length outside off, left alone. Again a bit of outswing"
"back of a length close to off stump, lets it come on, lets it swing and dabs to backward point"
"short, not as much width as those cuttable balls. Azhar waits on it and steers it to third man with a little wave of the wrists at the top of the bounce"
"nice length, slants across the batsman before shaping back in towards off stump. Azhar shows the full face and punches to mid-on"
"fullish, swings in a little towards off stump. Azhar slices his drive a little, between backward point and cover point"
"short ball, down the leg side, Azhar lifts his bat over his head and out of the way. Wade seems to cramp a little as he moves to his left to collect"
"beaten. Good length outside off, continues on with the angle across rather than swinging back in. Azhar fails to connect with the on-the-up drive"
"this time he holds his shape a little longer, and is in the perfect position to play a checked drive, on the up, between short extra-cover and mid-off"
"whoa, what happened there? That was short outside off, and Azhar shaped to cut, and the ball just leapt off the pitch, kept rising and rising, beat his bat by a foot, and continued to defy gravity even as Wade leaped behind the stumps"
"back of a length outside off, stabbed towards point"
"back of a length, leg-sideish. Sharjeel fails to connect with a flick off the hip, ball hits his body. Wade dives to his right to stop the ball from rolling away for leg byes"
"back of a length on middle stump, defended off the back foot"
"down the leg side again, Sharjeel misses another flick, but this one is wide enough to be called wide"
"shortish, not quite short enough to pull. Plus he didn't move his feet at all. Front leg just went up in a prance, and the ball was through him before he could bring his bat across it. Hits him on the body"
"oh man. Sharjeel defies the cliche of the subcontinental batsman who loves the ball on his pads. Misses another flick, and the ball hits his pad. Pitching well outside leg, of course"
"on the legs again, a bit shorter, this time he's managed to tuck it down to long leg"
"back of a length close to off stump, punched to mid-off. There's that super-straight Azhar Ali bat again"
"back of a length, and it nips in and cuts Sharjeel in half as he plays a leaden-footed push from the crease. He's saved by bounce. It didn't miss the top of middle stump by much."
"length ball angling into middle stump, defended to mid-on"
"fuller now, on off stump, clipped in the air, with the angle, towards the midwicket boundary. Slows down considerably after landing"
"overpitched, a bit of width too, Sharjeel plays a checked drive to the right of mid-off. Didn't quite middle it, it seemed to hit the inside half of his bat"
"short outside off, not much width. Jumps to ride the bounce and chop it down to short cover"
"overpitched again, on off stump. Times this clip crisply, but it's close enough to mid-on for him to stop it with a dive to his left"
"Taken! But he's caught it beyond the boundary. That was a length ball, angling across towards off stump, and Sharjeel shovels that against the angle, up and over long leg, and Starc leaps backwards, over the rope, and takes an impressive but inconsequential one-handed catch"
"length ball on middle and off, clipped away through square leg"
"strays on the pads, Azhar flicks to the left of long leg"
"oh man. He's almost headed that to third man. Bouncer angling across him, rising to head high. Very awkward to evade. In the end he dropped his wrists and ducked his head while looking away, and it hits the top of the helmet and ricochets to third man. It's taken off the rim of one of the air inlets"
"short, rising ball angling in towards off stump. Azhar jumps to get on top of the bounce and keep his defensive shot down into the leg side"
"back of a length on middle stump, defended to mid-on"
"fullish on off stump, driven to mid-on"
"length ball, nips back in from outside off. Half stride forward to defend, adjusts to the movement and knocks it gently into the on side for a quick single"
"shortish, angling across Azhar. Waits on it and dabs it down to the left of backward point"
"looks like the slower ball outside off, gives Sharjeel the one thing he craves above everything else. Hitting room. Holds his shape nicely, keeps his head still, and hits that in the air, in the gap between mid-on and midwicket"
"length ball outside off, doesn't really get forward to drive, just throws his hands at it and fails to connect"
"length ball on off stump, defended into the covers"
"shortish outside off, gets on his toes and defends towards point"
"back of a length on off stump, looks to use his wrists to work that through the leg side. Can't get it as square as he likes, because it bounces more than he expects, and he adjusts to play it down defensively into the midwicket region"
short and very wide. Azhar can't connect as he reaches out and attempts a slash
"full on middle and leg, drives with a straight bat to the left of midwicket. And becomes the latest player afflicted by the cramp epidemic as he turns to run a second. Hobbles it instead"

"back of a length close to off stump, punched back to the bowler"
"gone, gone. Full outside off, and Sharjeel has been struggling for timing right through this innings. Doesn't connect cleanly with his hit down the ground, gets neither the desired elevation nor placement, and he hits it straight to Maxwell at mid-on"

"length ball angling in towards off stump, defended to mid-on"
"bouncer over off stump, Azhar ducks but he doesn't need to. Rises well over head height"
strays on to middle and leg and Hafeez plays a sweet little pick-up shot over square leg. Faulkner chases from long leg and puts in a despairing dive to stop it at the boundary
"short, wide, and Babar puts it away, slapping it through cover point"
"full on off stump, driven to mid-off"
"full, close to off stump, that is excellent timing but his drive is a little too close to mid-off to get him any runs. Fielder only needed to move a couple of steps to his left"
"Whoops, not a great shot. Excellent length from Faulkner, inviting the drive without necessarily being driveable. Bowls it wide enough to entice Hafeez into the shot. Doesn't get his weight into it in time, is a little late getting fully forward, and only manages a thin edge"
"length ball angling away from off stump. Akmal comes forward to defend, gets a thick inside edge into his front pad"

"back of a length, close to off stump, defended into the covers"

"full outside off, driven to mid-off"
"back of a length on off stump, gets back and across and clips it through square leg"
"bam. Umar had faced nine dot balls, and he had had enough. Length ball on off stump, in the slot for him to clear his front leg and heave that down the ground, to the left of mid-on"
"shuffles across to this slower ball, misses the flick. Huuuuuge lbw appeal from Faulkner, not given. Looked like it pitched outside leg, but Australia have reviewed. Big shuffle from Akmal. Did that pitch in line? No bat on it, certainly. Pitching juuust outside leg"

"back of a length on off stump, defended to mid-on"
"length ball close to off stump, driven to the left of mid-off with a bottom-handed whip"

"shortish outside off, chopped to backward point"
"on a length just outside off, Akmal gets forward to defend"
"full and straight, tailing away late but Akmal manages an awkward defensive stroke"

"a slower ball at 123 kph outside off, pushed to mid-off"

"yikes. What waaaas thaaat? Full and wide outside off, Akmal runs at Starc and aims to send him into the long-on stands. Misses"
"147 kph, much better shot. Gets a low full toss on middle, worked through midwicket for four. Just a clip"
"poor line. On the pads, flicked down to fine leg for a run"
"pace off the ball, 128 kph, a thick outside-halved drive to third man for a run"
"gone! Akmal has played another terrible stroke. What was he trying to do? Clear mid-on with a pull? Poor choice of stroke. Back of a length from Starc outside off, hustles Akmal for pace. Akmal tries to forehand the ball into the leg side but may have been too late to the ball. Splices the ball straight to mid-on, who takes an easy catch. Ooh, actually that may have been the offcutter."

"good length outside off, played into the leg side, towards point"

"good length outside off, chopped into the ground and over slip for a run to third man. Not sure what he was trying to do there, ungainly"
just past leg stump for a couple. Fullish on a fifth-stump line. Azam's waft results in a thick inside edge which misses the stumps
"Azam was looking so good, then he does this. A stroke fraught with so much risk with a slip in place. Back of a length from Cummins, seaming back in. Azam tries to steer the ball to third man for one. The inward movement helps the ball rap the glove and just lob to Smith at slip. An easy catch. But well bowled too. Got some bounce and extra oomph in his delivery."

"on the pads, off the pads for one to fine leg"
"And a wicket, immediately. Bangs it in. Rizwan has to pull from over his right shoulder, and he takes it on, ends up skewing it high, and Marsh, running to his left from deep midwicket, takes an excellent catch.

"back of a length, angling into the left-hander and tucking him up for room. Gets up on his toes to defend"

"looks to sweep, and from the line of the stumps at that. Misses, and Wade's humongous appeal is turned down. Australia have used up their review; will be interesting to see that again. Did he get a bottom edge on it? Pitching on off, not turning enough to hit the stumps, according to Hawkeye"

"cramps him again, but this time he works it off his body through backward square leg"
"short outside off, Azhar beats midwicket diving to his right with a topspin-smash pull"
"ooh. Wasim stepped away from the stumps at first, then went across them, in an effort to put the bowler off. He just bowls a regulation length ball, and Imad misses the attempted ramp over short fine leg. Ball bounces over the top of the stumps"
"gone. Slower short ball, and Imad can't get any real power on this pull. Hits it high, towards Warner, who runs in from the midwicket boundary to complete a simple catch"

full on middle stump. Makes room and flat-bats to long-off
"yorker on middle stump. Wahab does well to dig it out, inside-edges into his pad"
"slower ball, shortish outside off. No pace on it at all. Amir wanted to flat-bat through point, only manages to chop it into the ground and send it rolling into the covers"
"interesting shot. Slower ball, full, on off stump, and he gets down on his knee and <i>sweeps</i> to long-on"
"full and wide, another slower ball. Amir slices underneath the ball again and sends it looping over point"
"another slower ball, another swipe from Amir, wanting to hit over the covers. He manages to hit it in the intended direction, but without the intended power, and extra-cover takes a couple of steps back and lets the ball fall into his cupped hands"
"Wahab's on strike, though. Faulkner continues from over the wicket, slants a slower ball across him. Looks to drive it over extra-cover, doesn't get any power on it, and it just eludes the fingertips of the leaping, backtracking Smith"
"another slower ball, worked into the leg side"
"yorker, angling down leg. Wahab looks to get his feet out of the way and flick, but can't put bat to ball"
"low full-toss on middle stump, swiped to long-on"
"slower ball, fairly full and straight, clipped with the angle through midwicket"
"length ball, slower ball, wide of off stump. Wahab slogs, he has to. Wants to hit over mid-off, but again, can't get any power into it. Mid-off moves a few steps to his left and backwards, and takes a comfortable catch to wrap up a 92-run win"
