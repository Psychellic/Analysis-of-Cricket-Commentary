"full outside off, to the pitch this time as he drives to the sweeper to bring up <b>his third consecutive fifty</b>"

"short of a length on middle stump, punches to long-on off the back foot"
"<b>mix up but he's safe!</b> The fielder from midwicket can't pick this up cleanly. Shahidi would've been in a lot of trouble. Still is from the effort after jarring his knee in with a dive, but at least he's not out. He hesitated as Afghan dropped the ball into the leg side and was really scrambling at the end"

"length on leg stump, allows it to come on and picks it to deep square"
"<b>bowled him!</b> Mashrafe delivers again. Another slower ball from around the wicket. Shahidi gets down for the ramp. Through the shot too early. It's the right line and length for the shot, but he doesn't anticipate the change in pace. It deflects off the front pad onto off stump"
"length at off stump, mistimed tap to extra cover"
short ball slanted into the corridor. Looks to play the cut but there isn't room. He's beaten on the under-edge
"short of a length outside off, thick inside edge as he lines up the pull. Can't get it past midwicket"
"good shot, but it's a big ground. Long-off gets across to his left to cut this drive against a full ball"
arm ball at a length outside off. He hasn't picked it. Looks to drive through cover but this slides in and goes off the inside edge. To his advantage in the end because no one is in the circle on the leg side
"<b>review for an lbw decision that's been given out.</b> Shenwari is caught on the flap trying to play the reverse sweep. There is an angle in on this, but middle and off are visible. There's no bat on it...<b>it's sliding down leg!</b> Wow that looked an unlikley result but Shenwari survives. Won't get the runs though..."
length ball pushed through flat and he cops this on the pad as he goes deep to try and tickle this fine
can't get it past midwicket. Shakib pushing it faster and faster. Yorker length and he gets a thick inside edge on the slog
"another inside edge as he looks to slog. Full and fast, runs behind square leg"
"offcutter at a length outside off, shuffles to try and set himself up to go over mid-on. But it skews off the outside part of the bat to point"
"length ball going across off stump, whips it to deep midwicket off the back foot"
<b>chipped</b> towards long-off as he walks down the pitch to try and swipe one over the leg side. Just so difficult to drag this guy into the leg side...
<b>nails this pull</b> but finds deep square on the bounce. That was viciously hit. Short of a length ball on the pads
"<b>whack.</b> Starts too wide this time does Mustafiz. Pitches outside off and it's short, so he can open his arms and slash at this. Gets it over point"
"thick outside edge to third man. Another offcutter, good length outside off. Jabs at it and it goes down there with the angle"
"short of a length outside off, gets behind the line and swings across the line. Gets an inside edge to short fine"
"<b>clatters it over long-on!</b> What a shot. This is a slow pitch, remember, so it takes some hitting to swipe from under a length ball and clear the leg side. But Shenwari has done exactly that. A clean hit to a ball with some width outside off"
"length ball on the pads, looks to flick and gets a leading edge towards long-off"
"thigh-high full toss at leg stump, expertly pokes this into the midwicket region and that was two right from the time he thought of it"

"yorker on leg stump, back in the crease to flick this to deep midwicket"
"length ball across the corridor, shuffles a long way across and punches to deep midwicket against the angle"
"<b>clears deep midwicket</b> who is a long way in from the boundary! Nazmul Shanto is forced to jump up one-handed but he won't get it. Full pace bouncer outside off, Shenwari nails the pull"
"<b>Bangladesh review</b> an lbw. Offcutter at a length on the stumps, Shenwari looks to <i>sweep</i> him. This could be both pitching outside leg and missing off. Apart from a possibility of getting glove on it...<b>which he has.</b>"
<B>appeal for lbw</b> as he looks to whip this into the leg side. He's caught on the back foot. That's pitching outside leg...and missing off
"<b>steal the second.</b> Length ball across off, he gets behind it and drags it wide of mid-on. Deep midwicket has a long way to go to his left and he won't stop the second"
"<b>gets it past short fine!</b> The option's been there and they finally take it. Length ball going across off stump, as it has been. Nabi gets inside the line and flicks it fine. Great skill. And now the pressure is on Bangladesh."
"length ball into the pads, dropped in front of midwicket with soft hands"
"<b>sends it a long way!</b> Another glorious straight hit from Nabi against Shakib. Sees the loop, gets down to meet it at the pitch on off stump and goes with the turn"
<b>hits a full toss straight to long-off!</b> Oh that's unfortunate for Nabi. Looks like he wanted to hit it wider but it's come off the toe. He made this a full toss and went inside-out. But Shanto covered good ground and was strong as he took this with a lunge to his left
<b>misses out on the short ball.</b> Ooooh big moment. Short and into leg stump. Closes the face too early on the pull and it's a harmless top edge to short fine's right
"<b>steps out and is beaten</b> on flight, but adjusts nicely to chop this through point"
<b>misses out on the full toss</b> after stepping out and cutting out some room. Another misses opportunity? Lifts it over cover and Shenwari says no to the second run
"nicely done. Anticipates the angle across, anticipates the offcutter, stays deep in the crease and slices it wide of extra cover. Sweeper has some running to his right"
<b>chipped back to the bowler.</b> This is good bowling. Cramps him with a short ball at waist height. He's looking to pull and is done by the climb and the angle. Mustafiz barely has to move to get this.
"<b>is that out at short fine?</b> No says the umpire. Leg byes he says! Short ball on the pads, he's cramped on the pull. It has definitely pinged off the thigh guard but was there glove first? Nope, there wasn't."
"<b>beaten!</b> An offcutter in the corridor, swings across the line and this goes through from under his bat"
"<b>off the thigh</b> as he looks to ramp this. Short of a length outside off, he can only deflect it to short fine"
"<b>chucks the bat</b> as he looks to bludgeon this into the leg side! He hasn't made connection before that mind you. Afghanistan have heartbreak again. Short and wide ball outside off. Shuffles, goes across the line. That hasn't worked at all against Mustafiz today, and it won't work in the last over."
