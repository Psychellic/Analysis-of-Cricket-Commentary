"Imad wraps up the innings with an eye-catching six over long-off! Rabada searches for a middle-stump yorker, it comes out as a full-toss. Imad gives himself some room, clears his front leg, yet maintains a stable base and launches it over the boundary. He holds his shape and rightly so"

"<b>sliced</b> and taken at cover! Back of a length outside off, and de Kock tries to pull this from outside off stump. Extra bounce forces him to fluff the shot, and the lobbed shot goes to Hafeez. Pakistan celebrate but the umpire wants QdK to wait. They want to check for the front-foot no-ball... and <b>Usman has overstepped!</b> And now it's neither a wicket nor a dot ball. One extra run for the no-ball, and now we have a free-hit. How much will this hurt Pakistan?"
