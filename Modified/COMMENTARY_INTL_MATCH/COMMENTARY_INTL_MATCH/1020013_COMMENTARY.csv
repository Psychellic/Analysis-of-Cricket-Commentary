how 'bout a 139 kph yorker on middle stump to kick things off. It's not as if we've not had a wild old start already. Guptill makes sure to bring down a straight bat
firm push to mid-on as he lines up another full delivery on middle and leg stump. Those big pads on Guptill's front foot are definitely on the firing line
"top save from the fielder, Cummins, diving headlong after the ball on the edge of the boundary and finishing up with a lovely back flick. Guptill had timed the flick through midwicket superbly. Just a little shuffle to off, concentrated on keeping his shape"
"good length, just outside off, Latham turns it to mid-on"
presents the full face to a fuller delivery at 141 kph and picks the gap between mid-off and cover
"some late swing there, into the pads at 142 kph, but Guptill handles it well, or well enough, keeping his front toe out of the way and clipping it to midwicket"
covers the line of a fuller delivery on off stump and picks it away through midwicket
good single. Latham allows the back of a length ball to come to him on off stump and then just gently taps it to the left of second slip
"full on off stump, Guptill steps forward to defend"
"fishes outside off, despite the two slips in place, and a thick outside edge flies away in the region of gully. No one there, though. Pin-point length from Hazlewood, inviting the drive, but not quite there for one"
"<b>nicked past second slip</b>! Shaun Marsh was the man diving to his left, but it would be rather cruel to call that a drop. Full blooded drive from Latham, having seen a full delivery angle across him, and a very thick edge just flies away"
"back of a length on off stump, Guptill covers it well"
"creams it through extra cover. Cummins pulled off a fine stop earlier, and though he does again fling himself face-first at the ball, it trickles across to the boundary. Half-volley, a wide one too, efficiently dealt with. Funny way to wish a mate a Happy Birthday, Latham. Starc's going to remember that"
"good length ball outside off, blocks it"
"back of a length and outside off, avoids it"
"good length on middle, Latham presses forward and defends around his front pad a touch"
"early birthday present for the big left-arm quick! This is a shortish delivery, heading down leg. Latham felt he could just ride it, nudge it to fine leg and get off strike, but he may have been undone by a little extra bounce. Cramped for room, with the ball suddenly big on him, he looks all kinds of awkward, gloving through to Handscomb, the stand-in wicketkeeper. Happy 27th, fella"
"and the cost of those men in the cordon is a gap at midwicket, which Williamson exploits with a deft little flick. Starc goes a touch too straight"
"plan A definitely seems to be get him lbw. Full, with just enough inswing to have Guptill falling over in front of middle stump while he is flicking. Gets enough wood on it for a single through midwicket though"
nimbly deflects the fuller ball to long leg as Hazlewood fires it full and on middle and leg
firm push to mid-off as Hazlewood corrects his line to outside off. Still a delightfully full length
gets up on his toes to blunt a shortish delivery on middle and leg and pick up a single to the right of midwicket
has the room to free the arms - and the tiny boundaries to tempt him - and bang goes Guptill. Shimmies down to get the ball on the half-volley and pastes it over extra cover. No intention to keep it down
"<b>huge appeal for an lbw</b>, meanwhile, Guptill has been dragged by his captain to the other end. So, how close is this? I thought leg stump was in play. The batsman shuffles across and seems to be in front, but perhaps the bounce might have saved him? He's hit above the flap of the pad"
"fuller delivery on middle and off, defends"
"gets it past mid-off. Not the best of efforts. He has a little distance to move to his left, Cummins is the man, who might well have got to the ball a bit quicker than he needed to. Slides past it as a mistimed drive gets Guptill a second boundary"
"shortish on middle and leg, Guptill nudges it into the leg side"
"<b>ripper</b>, and at 143 kph too. This is a good length ball, skirting across the right-hander, drawing him into an on-the-up drive and laughing maniacally past the edge"
"edged, through the wicketkeeper! So a drop then. Tough to call again for this was a solid top edge off a full blooded cut. Handscomb has to jump up, push his hands high over his head, but just wasn't quick enough"
"goes full and wide and Guptill throws his hands at the ball, lashing it through extra cover"
"back of a length on off stump, gets up on top of it and blocks"
presses forward to a full delivery outside off and keeps it out
"works it into the leg side, where Stoinis keeps it to a single"
"good length ball on off stump, met with the straight face of the bat"
"with fine leg up, at the ball slanted into the pads at 147 kph, it's not rocket science for the batsman to use that pace and flick it to the boundary behind them"
keeps him in the crease with a good length ball on middle. Guptill defends
"good length ball outside off, seen through to the wicketkeeper's care"
"tries to work a shortish delivery from off stump through midwicket, but it kicks up off the surface a touch more than Williamson expects, and having made contact off the high part of the bat, he can't manoeuvre the ball"
half an appeal for lbw as Williamson tries to flick a good length ball off leg stump. Would have slid down
"a little seam away from the bat, but considering it was rather a bit too wide of off stump, Williamson ignores it"
presses forward to a good length ball outside off and keeps it out
on the pads and Williamson directs it to long leg with a roll of his wrists
"on the pads again at 142 kph, Williamson is not quite quick enough on the draw with his flick and has to settle for a leg bye towards square leg"
works a full delivery from outside off through to deep midwicket
"digs it in, and the bouncer at 145 kph, soars over a ducking Williamson and forces Handscomb into a big stretch to his left. Doesn't quite collect it cleanly"
"good length ball, aiming at the top of off stump, Williamson defends it properly"
"picks the gap to the right of mid-on. Seems to be a stroke he's been working on, getting back of a length deliveries on off stump and flicking them into the leg side"
"oooh, almost plays on. Williamson is surprised by a good length ball, which keeps a touch lower than he expects. Hits the bottom edge and wanders past the off stump"
on middle and leg and Guptill works it in front and to the right of mid-on. Soft hands
"fuller delivery on off stump, met by the Williamson defence."
"goes for the push down the ground, but he checks his shot, which is probably why mid-on is able to move to his left and stop it"
"heaves it to the (short) long leg boundary. Punishes the bowler for an error in line, and the short ball slipping down leg is pulled to the left of the fielder there."
"opens the face as he stays beside the back of a length ball on middle and off. Yells 'no,' as he realises he didn't place it well"
"fullish on off stump, blocks it"
"shortish on off stump, Guptill gets up on his toes to beat it down by his feet"
"good bouncer again, right over middle and off, and at 145 kph too. Guptill does excellently, bending his knees and swaying out of the way. That means he can watch the ball all through"
"full on middle, Guptill works it through square leg, letting the ball come onto him"
"there for the drive, this 146 kph delivery, but Guptill doesn't time it properly. Full and wide delivery not made the best use of"
"oooh, this 144 kph delivery beats everyone. It was the bounce and pace that does Guptill, who was swaying his torso back to try and upper cut the ball. No dice. Then it decides to move in the air much to the wicketkeeper's chagrin, making his stretch to his left. Doesn't reach it in time"
through midwicket and away it goes. Good way for New Zealand to wrap up the first 10 overs.
""
"shortish and outside off, Williamson drags it across to the man at deep square leg with a pull. That single also brings up the fifty partnership"
"off-pace delivery again and Guptill doesn't read it. Lovely deception. Pitches it on a good length and manages to get a little more bounce than the batsman expects, to hit him on the thigh"
"fuller delivery outside off, drives it past mid-on's left"
"'catch,' is the cry as Williamson goes for an uppish lash over point. Beats third man on the boundary, who was fine"
moves across onto off stump to glance a shortish delivery on middle to long leg
"good length ball on off stump, defends to mdiwicket"
glides a back of a length delivery to deep third man. Uses all the 142 kph pace to his own benefit
"opens the face at the last second to try and beat the man at point, but this 146 kph delivery doesn't let him do so"
"lifts it over the wicketkeeper! This is purely intentional. This is absolutely brilliant. In the idea at least, if not the execution. Guptill knows Cummins is giving him so much pace than he knows what to do with, and so the moment it is pitched short, even if it is on middle, he swerves his torso back and ramps it"
bangs it into middle of the deck and gives the batsman an easy sighter. Bouncer avoided
"121 kph, that's the slower ball, full on off stump, Guptill picks it, blocks it into the cover point region for a single"
"back of a length and just outside off, defends"
"angles it into the pads and Guptill is unable to do what he wants to, tickle it past the left of short fine leg, which would have been a boundary"
"good length ball outside off, Williamson directs it off the open face to deep third man"
"oh, misses out again. And this is a poorer ball than earlier in the over because the line is way down leg. Guptill manages to get bat, but the flick shot picks out short fine leg - the only man there"
"full and wide outside off, and Guptill is able to pick the gap between point and short third man. He was originally intending to glide it, but seeing as the delivery didn't have much pace but gave him all the room he needed to free his arms, he hit it a lot harder"
"defends towards point, with soft hands, and sneaks a single"
gets on top of the bounce of this shortish delivery on off stump and whips it through midwicket
"pretty full and outside off, Williamson leans back, plays very, very late and ends up chopping the ball behind to the keeper"
"good length and angled in at off stump, uses his wrists and manoeuvres the ball to square leg"
"back of a length and on off stump, Guptill hangs back and chops a cheeky single to the right of Handscomb behind the stumps"
"just short of a good length and outside off, leans back, gently punches in front of point and sets off to the other end"
"rising short ball outside off, Guptill rises with it and blunts the ball to cover"
"bat-pad catch to backward point running to his left. Big appeal from Stoinis and the keeper. Umpire Knights' finger goes up. Stoinis snaffles Williamson in his first over. Back of a length and angled in at off stump, kicks up, Williamson jumps off the ground and seeks to work the ball to the leg side. The ball grazes the inside edge, then the thigh pad, and pops up to Maxwell. Williamson is Stonis' maiden one-day international victim. How about that for a start? Not sure if that was the cutter from Stoinis - he can bowl a cunning offcutter which bounces at the batsman"

"wide yorker, squeezed out"
"full and angling away outside off, presses forward and drives back to Starc"

"Stoinis runs in hard, hits the deck hard, this one absolutely flies off the surface, and beats a leaping Handscomb. Tough day behind the stumps. Taylor avoided it. Five wides it is"
"length and outside off, Taylor simply taps it down to third man"
tip-and-run single to the left of the keeper
"excellent placement and running to boot from Taylor. Fullish and on off, Taylor, with a more pronounced side-on stance, simply dabs it in the gap at square leg"
"nice and full outside off, Taylor flows forward and drives through the line. Hits crisply but can't beat mid-off now"
"back of a length and outside off, jabbed to point and that's drinks"
"back of a length, bounces at Guptill, 140ks, catches him in an awkward tangle"

"quick fizzer down leg, left alone"
"straight ball on middle and leg, nudged to midwicket"
"Handscomb's day gets tougher. He is nutmegged. Guptill pre-meditates shuffling outside leg stump for a scoop to the left of the keeper. Guptill is beaten, as is the keeper, as the ball goes through his legs"
"pretty full and slid across off stump, Guptill edges it, the ball grazes the pad of Handscomb and streaks away down towards third man"
"veering into the pads, tucked around the corner"
leg-side wide
paddled down towards long leg
"short and wide outside off, thumps a cut to the left of Maxwell. He spins around, aims at the striker's end, and misses. Taylor was off for a single, a direct hit could have dismissed Taylor"
"back of a length and outside off, Taylor rides it down to third man for one"
"just short of a good length on middle, fended back to the bowler"
"'wait, wait' is the call from Guptill. But Taylor is too eager for the single. Back of a length and outside off, sticks in the surface. Guptill attempts a punch and ends up squirting the ball to Maxwell at point. A direct hit could have been tight there too"
"short and skidding into the hips, fended square on the leg side"
Taylor takes Maxwell's arm on for the third time in six balls. Tips it to point and scampers across. Maxwell still can't connect with a direct hit. This time he misses at the striker's end
"flatter on the pads, knocked to short fine leg"
"skidding into the pads, pitched outside leg, Taylor does not make contact with a paddle sweep and weathers the leg-before appeal"

"full on middle, not much turn, push-driven to long-on"

"tossed on middle, driven on the front foot to long-on"
"length and outside off, Munro shovels it in the air off the inside half and hands a loopy catch to Finch. Not a full-blooded hit from the left-hander. He aimed to clear mid-on, instead chipped it to Australia's captain. So Handscomb's drop costs Australia just one run"

"<b>has he taken it</b>? Hazlewood leaps in the air, right on the edge of the boundary at third man, and comes up with a one-hander. So cool. So calm. Tracking it all the way. Such a super effort. But is his foot on the line? He isn't entirely happy with the effort, so that's an indicator that he felt the advertising skirting on his boot.

"what a shot, but oh, there's a fielder there, it's Maxwell, and its a stunning catch! Flashes a little grin after running several yards to his right, eyes always on the ball, taking it cleanly as he bends low and then gets into a military-style roll with the momentum he had going. Top effort. And one of the few times Santner times the ball, and he did so well to back away to make his own room against a good short ball"
guides a shortish delivery to deep third man
"oopsy, the stand-in keeper mucks up. It's the slower ball outside off, Broom tries the dab to third man, but comes up with nothing. The ball bounces before it reaches Handscomb and spins away to his left"

"full and quite a distance outside off, Broom can collect the extra"
"lashes it over extra cover. He's playing a gem of an innings, but at this point it is unsure whether it will be enough. Gets length, thrashes length"

"beaten for pace as a 145 kph delivery, a wide yorker, skips past the flashing blade"
"slings a full delivery into the pads and Broom is struck on the toe at full pace, he's floored too, but has enough of his faculties to take a leg bye. Outstanding yorker bowler, this fellow, and this angle from around the wicket, wide of the crease, with that slingy arm action makes it all the more difficult"
"145 kph, full and straight at the stumps, Ferguson manages to keep it out"
"low full toss, pushes it to deep point. Broom says no on the single to keep the strike"
"good bowling. that's the slower ball, dug into the middle of the deck, biting into it and cutting into the right-hander. Broom goes for a cut, lets out a loud grunt too by evidence of the stump mics, and is beaten"
"too straight, too easy to be picked up. Broom clears his front leg and heaves it over the long leg boundary, well to the left of the man in the deep"
"reaches out in front of him, over his shoulder, to drag a short ball from outside off to deep midwicket"

dabs a shortish delivery into the covers
"hammers it over straight midwicket. Right off the middle, and his tactic to run away to the leg side and make his own room while Cummins is trying to cramp him works superbly"
"lands a yorker, which meanders down the leg side. The umpire gives the bowler a little bit of leeway with Boult having made a move back and well outside off"
"finishes the innings in style, the back foot is camped deep in the crease, the front foot is nowhere to be found as Boult belts a length delivery outside off to the long-off boundary. Timely cameo from the No. 11"

"Neesham dives to his right from square leg, reaches for the ball with both hands, and plucks it out. Boult and Neesham combine to send back Australia's stand-in captain. Not a happy comeback for Finch. Hip-high short ball outside off, Finch simply flaps a pull to square leg"

"low full-toss, hit to deep midwicket, but they don't run"
"Ripping effort from Broom. He dives full length to his left and meets the ball on a half-volley and knocks it away towards long-off. Wide yorker, dragged away to wide long-on"
"full and outside off, slapped away to cover"
similar ball - full and wide outside off - Stoinis throws his hands at it and slices it over cover. Clears the bigger boundary
"low full-toss outside off, smeared over long-off for a six. <b>Fifty partnership with no contribution at all from Hazlewood</b>. He hasn't faced a ball yet. Unbelievable scenes at Eden Park"
"<b>Venue: Eden Park. Hero: Kane Williamson. Result: New Zealand win a thriller</b>! You've heard that before? Whoa.... What a game. Breathless stuff. First let us give credit to Williamson for placing himself at short mid-on. Southee nails a yorker on off stump, Stoinis can only dig the ball out fairly straight to Williamson. He collects the ball, falls in front of the stumps, and under-arms it into the stumps to catch Hazlewood short. Hazlewood had lost his head. He was off for a single - there wasn't a single there - he has to spin back. He dishes out a desperate dive, but that's not enough. <b>This is the first time Hazlewood has been dismissed in an ODI</b>. Spare a thought for Marcus Stonis, though. Nearly pulled off an incredible heist from nowhere"
