"short ball, he uses his feet to get closer to it and then swings this away...and <b>straight down long leg's throat!</b> The pressure of not getting boundaries shows as Jadhav looks to force the pace. Smart adjustment from Cummins to hold the length back, and he ends up mis-timing the attempted hoick completely. Needed to get it more off the middle of the bat to clear the fielder"
"short ball, and he moves away from the crease to create some room, and whacks this straight down the ground. Just clears the long off fence"
lofts a length ball over mid on. Good strokeplay to get some <strong>much-needed momentum</strong> right at the end for India!

"length ball, down the leg side, and he looks to flick this, but it is called wide"
"short, and he looks to go over midwicket, but <strong>cannot clear Glenn Maxwell</strong>! Cummins bangs this one into the pitch, and that takes the top edge, and Maxwell holds his shape well at midwicket and takes a steepling catch. Useful little hand has come to an end, that has pushed India over the minimum score India would have wanted to post today"
"short, angles across him, and he pats this towards point"
"<strong>FIVE for Cummins!</strong> Bangs this in short, and Chahal is squared up as he looks to drive this back. It pops back up, and Cummins takes it, but Dharmasena this time goes up to the third ump, and gives not out as the soft signal. The replays are conclusive though. All clean. Good effort this from Cummins on what is not a helpful pitch by any stretch of imagination"
"length, and he has swung this around, and cleared midwicket! What a shot, and Kohli is jumping up and down with excitement inside the dressing room. Bumrah walks off with a wide grin, and pumps fists with Kuldeep Yadav as he does so. 600 strike rate for the no.11...not too shabby, eh?"
"<strong>raps him the pad, appeal, not out.</strong> Hooping the ball back in a long way, Finch plays all around it but the ball deflects off the thigh pad for a leg bye"

"angles one across, left alone. No swing"
tucks this wide of midwicket for an easy single

"<strong>superb catch running in from fine leg!</strong> Bumrah peppers him with a short ball from round the stumps, Khawaja hurried onto the pull, clearly late on it and gets a top edge. Kuldeep was late to run in but he certainly wasn't in any dilemma about not going for the catch. It was dying on him when he threw himself forward, managed to cup his hands underneath the ball. Big moment in the game, a monumental stand has been broken, but that said, it may not be a bad thing for Australia as it brings in Maxwell's firepower."

"drifts in and skids through to hit pad as Maxwell plays all around it, sliding down."
"fired full, eased to long-off"

"he's walloped this over the ropes. Didn't get hold of the pull, lost his shape but still managed to clear. Too short, used the depth of the crease to rock back and play the shot he wanted."
"bowls it full and wide, swept from outside off towards wide long-on, three runs as Dhawan comes around, a touch slowly."
"huge appeal and gone! Maxwell's decision to switch hit hasn't worked, he reviews but it's a very optimistic one. Kuldeep lands this on a length on middle and off, Maxwell's almost sweeping like a left-hander at the point of impact, which is bang on middle. The leg stump was visible at the point of impact. Maxwell has to go. Ball tracking shows all three reds. Kuldeep with a telling blow."

"looks to flatbat that but misses, beaten"
"of a thick inside edge, but onto the pad. Looked to slap through cover."
drilled to Rohit at deep cover

"leading edge, thick one at that to third man"
"<strong>Pant fluffs one down leg, another one goes begging!</strong> This one difted in, he's looking to tuck it fine but is overbalanced and well outside the crease. Oh, dear. Oh dear. Are India missing MS Dhoni behind the stumps or what? Pressure beginning to tell"
"slips another one down leg possibly because of the wet ball, has to rebowl"
"gentle bunt towards Vijay coming in from deep midwicket, super running"
"swing across the line exactly to the man there, at midwicket"
"right into the blockhole, Carey can just manage to squeeze it out somehow, but <strong>they hare a single as Pant under-arm flicks wide of the stumps</strong>"
"sees the batsman making room and fires it wide, beaten. India have reviewed a caught behind, but the impression I got is the batsman was through with the shot even before the ball arrived. But they'll look for stumping first, and then for caught behind. Stumping seems fine. They went up for stumping because the square leg umpire went up immediately. <b> India have reviewed for caught behind. Replays confirm a big spike but it was after it passed the bat. End result is, wide."

"chopped down to Vijay coming in from deep cover again, superb running. <b> 50 partnership off just 28 balls </b>"
"backs away and slaps this wide of point. Too much width, super timing. Square third man had no chance."
"superb ball, yorker right into his boot from round the stumps, deflects behind the stumps on the off side for a leg bye"
"what a shot, what-a-shot. Walks across - the guts, the confidence - and scoops this full delivery and even clears fine leg. ABD would've been proud of that. Fielder inside the ring so the shot was on, had the extra pace, executed it beautifully."
steered down to third man
"clears long-on. The whip of his bottom hand, tremendous. Walks across and deposits this length ball over the ropes."
"<strong>Jadhav puts a tough one down at deep midwicket!</strong> This mishit was dying on him, Jadhav late to pick it up, late to run in and so couldn't get underneath the delivery. Confused how deep he should've been at the boundary. Oh, dear. Lost control completely"
"walks across and helps this pull to deep backward square leg, couple of bounces to the ropes."
"<b> Dhawan drops a dolly at mid-off! </b> Oh, dear. It's all happening. Low full toss, Bhuvi goes full and wide, Turner toe-ends it, it wasn't even travelling fast. Greasy hands, took it too easy. Pressure, pressure, pressure."
