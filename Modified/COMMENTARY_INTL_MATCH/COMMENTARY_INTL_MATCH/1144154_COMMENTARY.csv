"fired in straight, tapped down from the crease"
"perfect line, draws the edge - <b>de Kock snaffles it!</b> Full enough to drag him out, swerving enough to kiss the bat, speedy enough for a quick kill. Up goes Joel Wilson's finger and the end is nigh for Pakistan"

"swings across the line again, <b>does this take the inside edge?</b> Joel Wilson is unmoved but SA choose to <b>review</b>... There was definitely a sound, but seems to be ball flicking the thigh pad. Good take from de Kock, but not bat involved, so Afridi will continue"

"banged in short, good energy but not a lot of impact"
up on the toes to defend down into the crease
"opens the face on the back foot, guided to cover"

"short ball, good bouncer from round the wicket, Markram has to take evasive action"
"oof, that's hit him amidships! Markram drops his bat and goes for a walk... Extra bounce off a length, actually struck him on the elbow and then deflected down towards the groin. Discomforting on all fronts"

"drops short and again Markram seizes on the opportunity, this time on to the back foot and slamming four to deep backward square leg"

"good length in the channel, Markram lets it go"
"bowled 'im! <b>A torpedo to remove off stump with the final ball of the day!</b> Markram is uprooted, there'll be no coming back for a hundred in the morning... Ecstasy for Masood, who only took his first Test wicket at Centurion last week! That has grubbed through at shin height, a shocker to get from a part-time bowler, but Pakistan will grab whatever they can at this stage. South Africa's day but Markram is done"

"a neat start to his day's work, eased through the covers to find space in the deep"
patted back down the pitch
"full, straight, and defended"
"squeezed to the leg side, head half over the ball"
"<B>oh wow, that's unplayable!</B> Ma-a-a-a-a-ssive jag off the pitch from outside off, and out comes leg stump as a bewildered Amla is left fencing at thin air! That must have hit a crack, but there in a nutshell is the value of hitting the seam time and time again. You never know what natural variation will come to your aid!"
"fully forward to meet the pitch of the ball, and a quick single to get off the mark"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
"pounding the pitch outside off, through to the keeper"
"Amir persists with a probing line outside off, not a lot of movement back into the right hander which is where his threat will come"
better line! Much tighter to the stumps and good carry over the stumps as du Plessis leaves alone
"dead-batted defence into the off side, solidly into line"
"good control from Amir, but not a lot of threat. It's Abbas who's getting the ball to talk this morning"
"tight line, attacking the stumps, watchfully prodded to cover"

"blotted into the off side, du Bruyn avoids over-committing to his shot"

"left alone outside off stump, Amir ploughs that familiar furrow, but he's perhaps a foot too wide to draw any edges"
"better line, defended on off stump with a big stride"
"<B>bouncer, and chested away!</B> Well directed short ball, as du Bruyn sways inside the line but can't avoid contact as the ball deflects to the cordon"
"back on the front foot, pushed to cover"
left alone with a flourish as Amir plugs away once more
"through to the keeper on a fourth-stump line, no stroke offered"
"tucked to the leg side as Abbas tightens his line, well gathered with a scramble at square leg"
<B>squelch!</B> This one pops from a full length and du Plessis wears it in the unmentionables. Or just to the left of them to be precise. A quick rearrangement and on we go. Hard as nails
"outside off, and through to the keeper"
"very full, wide line, du Plessis shapes to drive but leaves well alone"
"<B>lovely bowling!</B> Half a bat's width of movement from an excruciatingly tight line, and somehow he avoids snagging the edge. There's a bit of threat in this deck this morning"
"eased through long-off with insouciance. Amir comes round the wicket to change the angle, and pays the price instantly"
shorter and sharper. Extra lift from Amir as du Bruyn's cut shot cuts at thin air
"wide on the crease, angled back into the stumps, stoutly blocked"
"good lift off the deck once more, de Bruyn keeps his gloves out of harm's way"
"no stroke once more, more good carry from a full length"

"back of a length, tight line, solid defence"
"poked into the covers, thoughts of a single but quickly turned down"

"outside off, good lift once again, and left alone"
tucked to the leg side

"back of a length, defended with resolve on the back foot"
blocked off the back foot once more
"fenced down to third man, that's not remotely where he was aiming, but a cautious defensive prod finds a fat outside edge and races away"
"beaten once more outside off, Afridi is finding some spice in the deck now"
"firm defence on the front foot, and pushed back to the bowler"
"thick edged defence, stretching forward to combat Abbas' wiles"
"very full and straight, poked to mid-on"
through to the keeper once more
"surprise bouncer, du Plessis lines up the pull, but bails out as the ball swings away as it passes the bat"
into line to defend once more
no stroke offered
"short, leg-sided, a top-edged swish ... but safe! No-one lurking close in on the 45, and de Bruyn survives"
fenced into the off side with a waft of the bat
"on the pads, nurdled square and they take the single"
"drops the hands as Afridi jags one away from the right-hander from back of a length, through to the keeper"
"back of a length once more, an awkward line but de Bruyn sways inside it regardless"
pushed back onto the stumps to defend a tight line
climbing through to the keeper once again
"<B>biffed through the covers!</b> That'll do, not the cleanest wallop of the match so far, but the ball was over-pitched and asking for a beating, so Faf obliged!"
"pushed back onto the stumps, blocked to the leg side"
"short and wayward, and Sarfraz can't claw that one in! Way over the batsman's shoulder, and away to the rope"
"very full, wide line, no stroke offered"
"probing line outside off, but no stroke needed there"
left alone outside off once more
"<B>throws his hands at a wide one and gully clings onto a stinger!</B> Such a nonchalant grab from Babar, high to his right, but a total throwaway from Theunis! No need to chase that one, the runs were coming regardless, but a loss of patience and Pakistan continue to chisel a way back into this contest"
driven into the covers to get off the mark
"squared up on leg stump, and nearly squirts a thick edge to gully! Things are starting to happen out there"
"punched through the covers, majestic strike"
"Abbas whirs in and hits a length, softly defended coming forward by Bavuma"
"oof, that's jumped, skips off the deck and clips bat, maybe forearm and deflects into the thigh pad"
"drags him out, locates the edge... <b>and first slip snags a low catch!</b> Or does he? Bavuma is going to hang around and wait for any hint of doubt. <b>The soft signal from Bruce Oxenford is out</b>, though this is a helluva tough one to call either way... Does the ball touch the grass as Azhar attempts to scoop it up? The third umpire, S Ravi, decides it does! So the decision is <b>overturned</b> and Bavuma gets a life"
"pitched up, this time Bavuma covers the line in defence"
comes across and taps the ball away
played calmly back down the track. Bavuma looking to make good on his reprieve here
"angled across, Faf lets it go in the channel"

"touch shorter, 133kph and defended"
"Afridi is working the channel nicely here, du Plessis comes across and lets it go again"
"over the top of the stumps! Good leave from Faf, able to judge the bounce as Afridi brought the ball back a fraction around off"
"touch short outside off, shoulders arms"
"round the wicket, lets this one go outside off"
"yowch, Bavuma has been felled by a blow to his special place... and, to add insult, Pakistan <b>review</b> for lbw! What a way to treat a man trying to collect himself. He's a small fellow, is Bavuma, but that was clearly bouncing over the stumps - so Pakistan lose that review, and a tender Temba can continue"
"pitched up, this is met coming forwards"
"beaten on the inside, lovely bowling from Amir, this reared in from a length, past the groping forward prod"
"short of a length, Bavuma nails a cut through backward point for four"
shortish and blocked around off stump
"shortish, lets this one go outside off stump"
Faf jumps across to defend
"lovely line, this is from round the wicket, nibbling away as du Plessis pokes and is beaten on the back foot"
"at the body now, banged in and du Plessis wears the blow"
"short, 133kph and again he fends it away, off the bat this time and short of the lurking close catcher"

"tight lines, played back down the track"
"fullish, tapped defensively towards gully"
"length ball, 137kph on middle stump, worked towards midwicket"
"speared into the front pad, Amir goes up... but I think that was high! Actually struck him on the thigh (which, for the record, is lower than his box) and Pakistan don't review this one"
"good length, 136kph and defended coming across"
"Afridi keeps plugging away in the channel, round the wicket but not coming back enough to make Faf play"
"straighter line, this squirts off the inside edge but runs behind short leg for a single"

gets into line on off and lets this one zip through

"line and length in the corridor of Bamber Boozler-ment, but Bavuma judges well and leaves"

"touch wider with his line, this one can be more comfortably left alone"
"boshty! Overpitched in the slot, Faf is on the warpath and creams four through the covers, <b>bringing South Africa's deficit down into single figures</b>"
"dug in, worked off the body for one to midwicket"
"flings down a bumper, 136kph outside off, Bavuma ducks"
"over the wicket, lobbed up and straightening on leg, du Plessis reaches out to defend"
goes back on off stump to block this time

Bavuma is forward on off to defend softly

"hurled down around the line of off, Bavuma is across and playing softly down into the turf"
"in the channel, lets this one fly through"
"gets him reaching for the ball, finds the edge... but Bavuma plays it well, cushioning the ball softly between slips and gully for four to third man"
"pitched up, 132kph and whipped to midwicket - a misfield nearly gives them a chance to run, but they think better of it"
"good length outside off, 135kph and Bavuma leaves it be"
"floated up on middle and leg, du Plessis blocks firmly"
"shifts his line across, defended with half a forward-press"
"pushed through flatter and a touch quicker, du Plessis chops down on it"
"tapped back into the off side, Yasir scampers after it"
"floated up full on off stump, clipped sweetly on the drive past extra cover, they come back for two - <b>and that takes South Africa into a first-innings lead</b>"
"drifting straighter, turned off the pads for one more down to fine leg"
"back of a length in the corridor, left alone"
stays back and jabs the ball away

"full and flighted, worked to mid-on"
sliding in with the arm and Bavuma clips it neatly away through square for a couple

"fizzed down and met by a proactive Bavuma, who is out to tip-and-run wide of mid-off, gets in comfortably at the bowler's end - and that will be <b>lunch</b> beneath the Table"
"outside off, a yawning leave to launch proceedings"
"on the hip, and whipped to the leg side to get the scoreboard moving again"

onto the front foot to block
drags the bat w-a-a-a-y inside the line to leave alone in extravagant fashion
"angled back into the stumps, and blocked, painfully, with the fingers of the top hand. A lengthy break in play as the physio applies the magic spray and a bit of taping. Might have squished a nail, poor thing"
"fenced into the leg side, and they scamper the single"
"round the wicket, Bavuma is squared up as he leans a defensive push back up the pitch"
"flicked off the hip, out through backward square. Good contact as fine leg jogs round to gather"
"round the wicket, outside off, left alone"

dabbed into the off side
"through to the keeper, outside off, keeps low as Sarfraz stoops to gather"

"angling back towards the top of off stump, tapped to midwicket for the single"
left alone in the channel
"<B>flogged through point!</B> Just a nugget of width, and that is battered with aplomb and a followthrough that Afridi (the original) would be proud of. Up comes the fifty stand"

hopping onto the back foot to defend in front of middle and off
Faf leaves without faf
"angling away after pitching, left alone once more"
"banged in with good energy outside off, but that's a harmless leave-alone"

through to the keeper as Bavuma lets this go
leaning onto the front foot to defend

banged in short but down the leg side
tip and run as Bavuma nudges a single into space on the leg side

angled defence into the off side
"round the wicket, through to the keeper, Bavuma will not be moved"
"a bouncing bomb of a delivery, banged into the deck and leaping through to the keeper"

"nudged to the leg side as Faf plays from the pitch, and up comes the skipper's half-century, a fine fighting knock after a pair in the first Test"
"solidly onto the front foot, smothering the little hint of spin"
dragged out of the pitch this time as Yasir draws his length back. Gathered at midwicket
<strong>pounded gleefully over wide long-on!</strong> A two-step down the track and a liberating fling of the willow. That will ease the pressure
flicked to midwicket and they barrel through for the single
flicks the top of the pad as Afridi straightens one from round the wicket. Bounces short of Sarfraz behind the stumps
tucked to the leg side

"on the back foot, defended back down the pitch"
"whipped off the hip, easy pickings once more as Afridi strays in line and length. No respite for Pakistan"
"<B>edged and gone!</B> Out of nowhere, Bavuma is sunk! Afridi makes up for his error the previous ball by tightening his line, straightening one off the seam, and finding the nick through to Sarfraz. No hundred for Bavuma, but a fine knock all the same"
"low full toss on the pads. Well, that's not ideal, unless you are Quinton de Kock! He's gifted a first-ball boundary to get up and running, like a ten-pound bonus when you open a new bank account"

solid prod to the leg side
"<B>so close to playing on!</B> QDK jabs down into the crease, the ball pops high over his head, and he instantly retreats to his stumps, hoping to guard them as the ball plopped down... It landed <I>millimetres</I> behind them, right next to the stump mic. Shades of Gooch's handled the ball, minus the handling, of course!"
"<B>he knows nothing about this one either!</B> Squared up wickedly on off stump, and a fat edge speeds through the gully. Living dangerously!"

short of a length and jabbed down into the leg side
"<b>dropped!</b> Sarfraz shells a simple catch down the leg side, just as Abbas was starting to appeal... There was definitely a sound as du Plessis flicked across the line, and Ultra Edge shows it could only have been bat. But Sarfraz ended up deflecting the ball off the gloves and into his nose!"

"banged in short once more, a slapped uppercut down to third man as Olivier leans back to give himself room, and there is the catch that ends the fun.

"pitched up, scratchy drive from Imam - <b>and it's swallowed at third slip!</b> Steyn makes the breakthrough again, loose from Imam, there'll be no second-innings heroics from him. Full and tempting but he was on the move and totally off balance as he swiped at the ball"
"banged in short, Azhar gets across and lifts his hands safely out of the way"

"stays low, thuds into the pad - <b>that's plumb!</b> No review from Azhar, who was perhaps happy enough to walk off knowing he hadn't got out to an Olivier bouncer. That crack as done for another batsman, Rabada right on the money with his first ball, would have rattled middle and off halfway up"

"there's the breakthrough, <b>Masood finally lured into fishing at one!</b> Almost identical to his first-innings dismissal, you can see the pain behind his eyes as Masood again suffers a lapse in concentration...

pitched up and tapped back softly
"again he comes in off a short run, Babar taps it away"

"Rabada hammers the ball in short, Babar ducks it"
"another half-tracker and it's spanked over point, a lavish uppercut and not a fielder moved"
"extra bounce, finds the edge - <b>Amla snaps it up!</b> That's the big one, Babar extracted after a spunky knock; but has it come in time for SA to finish things tonight? Rabada hit a good length and drew the shot, Babar needing to try and get a single to retain the strike. SA need one more"
