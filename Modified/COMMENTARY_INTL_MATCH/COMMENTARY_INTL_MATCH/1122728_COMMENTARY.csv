"ooh. A tad short, a tad wide. Gunathilaka looks to flay the ball through cover, with an angled bat, but the ball hits the inside edge onto the pad. Some away shape"
"the accurate bowler that Bhuvneshwar is, he pulls the length back, straightens the line, and bowls the perfect delivery. Around off, fourth-stump channel. Defended"
"yummy. 139 kph, full and wide outside off, more outswing, but Gunathilaka lets his hands through the line, drilled through cover. Terrific stroke"
"another fiddly stroke. Positive from the outset is Gunathilaka, he tends to bat like this. But these aren't terrible cricketing shots, which is very important. Scythes a cut down to third man"
"the other delivery. The inswinger, full around leg, worked to square leg. Tharanga a lot more respectful"
"full and straight again, inswing, worked to midwicket with the angle"
"good length outside off, 128 kph, some spongy bounce, defended into the off side"
"on a length, on middle and leg, worked towards square leg. Letting the ball come to him."
"slightly too short for so early in the innings. Back of a length outside off, no swing, punched towards extra cover"
"goes through with a lofted chip. Now that is not a good shot. Shortish outside off, Gunathilka goes through with a drive on the up. Gets it over the infield, around point"
"into the gap again for a couple. Full and straight, shovelled towards midwicket for a couple. Not in control at all. Gunathilaka makes it back despite slipping while completing the first run"
"the slower ball, around off, defended"
"131 kph, shortish and wide, chopped through point"
"full around off, pushed towards mid-off. Nice straight bat face through the line"
"on a length around off, 130 kph, defended back"
"good length on middle and leg, 125 kph, nudged to square leg. Good batting"
"fullish around middle and leg, worked towards wide mid-on for a quick single. Well played, well run. A direct hit at the bowler's end"
"runs down and pulls mightily over square leg. Didn't try to keep that down. Short delivery on leg, Gunathilaka comes charging and goes over"
"<strong>beaaauty!</strong> That's Bumrah's angle causing chaos. On a length around off, the ball seams away and beats the bat. Fourth-stump channel. Fantastic bowling"
"good length outside off, a punchy push to mid-off"
"another good single. Full around middle and leg, worked through midwicket"
"and gone! Always going to happen with the way he was playing. Comes down, looks to go over mid-off, but his timing is so bad, the ball skews off the inside half and lobs to mid-on. Being positive is fine, but looking to hit every ball over (not through) the field is not a great strategy."
"lovely batting. Drifts on the pads does Bumrah, with his angle, and Samarawickrama clips him through midwicket with nonchalant ease."
"whew, <strong>he slipped but got back in time</strong>. Back of a length on middle, defended towards short midwicket. More because of that angle again. He took off for one, was sent back, but got back with a dive"
"another lovely delivery. In the channel outside off, Tharanga pokes and is beaten on the outside edge"
"full around off, pushed to mid-off"
"just inside the boundary. Tharanga has had enough of prodding and plodding, stays in his crease, lets the ball come to him and then goes boom. Over mid-on. That's a calculated risk, as opposed to Gunathilaka's hit-all approach"
"chippy Sri Lanka today. Full on the pads, another stabbed chip over midwicket for a couple"
"smashed this time. Good length, or just fuller than that, Tharanga picks the length, rocks back and pulls mightily over midwicket"
"sensational batting. Full around off, pushed to mid-off, who is slightly deeper because of his charge, for one"
"nice channel. Full on off and middle, solidly blocked"
"this has to be Sri Lanka's approach. Good or bad, I'm not sure. England changed their ODI status batting like this after the 2015 World Cup. Full on middle and leg, Tharanga shovels a flick over square leg. Looking to attack almost everything"
"on the pads and four more. Drifts on the pads this time, and Tharanga just helps it fine. Nicely played"
"the slower ball this time, too full. Tharanga just leans on that, his favourite shot, the exquisitely-timed cover drive"
"and again. Good length on off, he pushes this towards wide mid-off for one. This is just superb batting. Is it a ploy to take on this Powerplay?"
"<strong>just short of wide slip</strong>. Nice length, good length outside off, Samarawickrama comes down, looks to defend but gets a thick outside edge which falls just short of Dhawan at slip, seemed like he picked it up on the bounce. But the umpires want to confirm, soft signal is not out. Bounced well short."
"Pandya starts with a nice delivery around off, defended. Around the wicket he is"
"that's his other favourite, the cut. Slight width and Tharanga leans into a terrific cut behind point. What timing too. Can this go on for a while?"
"was there for the cut again, so not a good ball. Short and wide, may have been some extra bounce which caused the ball to bounce over the cut"
"full around off, pushed back. Much better line to Tharanga"
"<strong>140 kph</strong>, full outside off, easily defended to point. Good pace from Pandya, needs more control though"
"that's a good comeback. Lovely channel, around middle and leg, pushed to mid-on"
"good length outside off, 129 kph, defended towards point. Keeping in that channel, better line from Bumrah. He can't stray with his angle"
"beaten on the outside edge. Full outside off, he wafts and is beaten. Did he play for that inward angle?"
"positive intent, and if the ball is not there, defend, that's how you bat in cricket. Samarawickrama comes down, gets a good delivery and plays it out"
"outside-halved to point. Full outside off, skewed again. Seems like he is not playing the right line"
"138 kph, full outside off, inside-halved this time towards square leg"
"maiden from Bumrah. Full around off, driven back to the bowler who palms it to mid-on. Good control from Bumrah"
"outside-edged for four. Full delivery outside off, nice channel, but Tharanga wafts with soft hands. He gets a thick edge which flies down to the third man boundary"
"not great timing but enough bat on the ball. Full around off, overpitched maybe. Tharanga lifts the ball cleanly, over the mid-on fielder."
"in the gap. 132 kph, full outside off. Tharanga goes the other way, brings the bat down from a different angle and nails a lofted drive, wide of mid-off"
"four in four. Tharanga has raced to 44. A slower ball, possibly one of the better deliveries on this surface. The offcutter rips and takes the edge. Bounces in front of Dhoni, and over him, four more to third man"
"make it five. Another slower ball but too full, Tharanga clears his front leg and lofts the ball over extra cover for four. Superb batting. Tharanga on faya."
"booooo! A solid defensive shot through cover. Pulled that length back just enough, earning Tharanga's respect."
"this will test Samarawickrama's temperament. He has struggled to Bumrah, can he rotate strike? Beaten on the outside edge as he prods again"
"good length outside off, defended back after charging down. The good players, Smith, Kohli, AB, will play that ball to third man"
"good length outside off, there is that run to third man, 141 kph. Good single"
"ayya, Tharanga misses out on four. On a length down leg, off the pad to short fine leg."
"lovely batting. There is that run to third man again, off a good ball. Dabbed away"
"nicely played. Good length outside off, a punchy slash to third man. Better from Samarawickrama"
"full around off, pace off the ball, worked away to midwicket"
"good length outside off, dabbed away towards third man"
"full outside off, coming back in, dabbed to backward point"
it's a good short ball. The bouncer. Pandya uses that hard length effectively. Samarawickrama ducks
"superb shot. A slower ball outside off, Samarawickrama runs down and whips the ball, Pietersen style, through backward square leg."
"overpitched outside off, pushed towards cover"
"too much flight outside off, Tharanga leans into a drive to mid-off to get <b>to a stunning fifty</b>. SL need at least 50 more"
"the googly? Overpitched outside off, the attempted paddle sweep is missed, off the pad to slip"
"another slow googly, on middle and leg, defended"
"uses his feet, runs to the pitch and works the ball towards square leg. He's now 10 off 22"
"another googly, short and wide, slashed towards backward point. Premeditated the sweep but improvised well"
"five dot balls from Sadeera. Not very good,<strong> just didn't pick Kuldeep</strong>. The stock ball on middle and leg, misses a simple flick."
"on the pads, worked away to midwicket, who dives to his left, and parries the ball away, conceding another run. Good awareness from Tharanga"
"on a length on middle and leg, worked to midwicket"
"134 kph, on a length around middle and leg, nudged to midwicket for another run"
"falls right between two fielders. It's short around off, the hard length again. Samarawickrama goes after it, top-edges his pull but it falls in the gap at deep backward square leg, perfectly splitting fine leg and square leg"
"takes it on again. Another bouncer, Samarawickrama whacked on the badge as he misses a pull. One leg bye, cricket eh?"
"full delivery outside off, defended into the off side"
"81 kph, the stock ball, turns down leg, helped along to fine leg. He's clearly not picking Kuldeep"
"the googly. Tharanga doesn't pick him this time. Goes through the gap between bat and pad. I'm a big fan of taking on the wristspinner with well-picked slog sweeps, especially against Kuldeep, puts him under pressure. Will SL take him on?"
"overpitched, almost a yorker, pushed to long-on"
"lovely shot. The googly outside off, driven to cover. Picked that"
"76 kph, <strong>that's close. That's out?</strong> That's straight. Full on middle and off, Samarawickrama misses a flick. Struck right in front. That's ripe for a review, unless he got bat on it. <b>Three reds on HawkEye</b>"
shovels a flick towards square leg for one
"133 kph, full outside off, defended into the off side"
"full on middle and leg, 136 kph, flicked away to deep square leg"
"no run there. No direct hit, so apparently there is. Pushed to cover and Tharanga calls for one. The cover fielder picks up, and <strong>misses the stumps at the</strong> bowler's end. A direct hit at either end would have had a wicket"
"digs it in short on middle and leg, pulled in front of deep square leg for a couple"
"takes it on again. So compulsive. Terrible batting. He struggling to control that shot means India will keep bowling short. Top-edged again, falls short of fine leg"
"fullish delivery on the pads, nudged to midwicket"
"that's terrific batting. Came down to the pitch, once he was there, didn't matter which way the ball was meant to spin. Drove the ball right back over his partner"
pushed back to the bowler this time
"that first ball meant he earned this ball. Short down leg, he stays back and flicks to deep square leg. Well done"
"the googly again? 80 kph, on the pads, nudged to square leg"
"comes down to the pitch again, gets there and drives to long-off. He has improvised really well has Samarawickrama"
"short and wide, they're milking Kuldeep now. Cut to the sweeper cover."
"drops short, a filthy start, pulled to midwicket"
"good comeback. Slower and fuller outside off, earns Tharanga's respect as he defends"
"shortish again, but it was fired in, pulled to deep square leg"
"lovely shot again. Makes some room by opening up his stance and nails a drive to cover, who fumbles and allows one"
"on the pads, worked away to square leg with the spin"
"flat on middle and leg, a whippy flick to square leg. Iyer dives to his right, but can't stop one."
"<b>beats him</b> with a rip-roaring legbreak. It drifts lazily into middle stump, demanding Tharanga's attention and then laughs past his outside edge"
leans that extra bit forward to get to the pitch of the ball on middle and leg and pushes it to long-on
strides out of his crease with great purpose and pastes the tossed up delivery outside off through to long-off
"<b>too full for the sweep</b>! But it is clear why Tharanga goes for the shot. He sees the flight, he wants to upset Kulpdeep, who is in really good rhythm. Ends up being beaten"
"straight bat shot after a bit of a gamble last ball, and he finds a single to long-off"
nicely flighted onto off stump and Sadeera almost has to dig it out like a yorker. Brilliant control from Kuldeep
"a gentler sweep, to a ball that is on a length and just enough on leg stump to merit to shot. Single to long leg"
"steps out, but he pulls the trigger too early. Chahal darts the ball into leg stump, shortens the length as well, and the ball thuds into the pad as opposed to the bat"
"hammers it over the top! Buh-rilliant shot, straight down the ground! The ball hangs in the air, asking for the lofted shot. And Tharanga obliges with gusto"
the follow-up ball is quick and short and he's waiting for it. Dainty little pull to midwicket
advances to the pitch of the legbreak on middle and leg and drives to long-on
"beautiful! He picks the gap behind point, and once that's done, his timing takes care of the rest. Cut shot of the finest quality. And it all starts with his picking the short ball so very early and rocking back to be in prime position. It might even have been the googly, so he might even have hit with the turn. Actually, nope. Normal leggie"
"loopy delivery outside off, Sadeera looms over it, front foot way outside off, and nudges to midwicket"
"<b>dropped</b> at short midwicket. It's a very touch chance though, Karthik has to leap as high as he can. shoving both hands high into the air. He gets a fair bit of contact. The ball lobs back up in the air, but it is too far behind him for a successful rebound. Sadeera survives to stride down the track and flick again, if he still wants to"
tickles it to the left of short midwicket
""
"goes back and dabs the shortish delivery - perhaps even a googly - towards short third man. They want a single, it'll be tight. In comes the throw, out comes the dive and third umpire, take it away. Very safe. Sadeera's dive is perfect. Full length. Bat facing down."
"tosses it up on off stump, drives to long-on"
gets down the pitch again and nudges the flighted ball down the ground
closes the face of the bat to hit with the turn and the full delivery on middle goes to square leg
"gives it a bit of air, outside off, Tharanga defends"
"shortish on middle, he clips it to the right of square leg"
"lifts it over extra cover, but Chahal does well to ruin his timing by tossing it up rather wider than the batsman would like."
little lap sweep and Chahal is not pleased with the result. The ball trickles away too fine for Bumrah at long leg to bother giving chase
presents the full face of the bat and the front-foot on-drive finds mid-on
"great timing! It only seems like a push, off the open face of the bat, and yet the ball races away to the backward point boundary. Cuh-lassy"
"waits on the good length ball on middle, softens his hands on the bat, taps it to deep square leg and pinches a second run. Gorgeous batting. The last shot needed hard hands. This one needed something else"
rises up with the bouncer and pulls it down to deep square leg
"digs it in again, angling the slower bouncer across the left-hander. Tharanga sways away like it emits bad odour."
"bangs it in again, down leg, Tharanga avoids it like the landlord on rent day"
races down the pitch - but with Chahal pushing the ball through into middle and leg - he ends up having to flick across the line and misses altogether
lobs it up like they're in the park playing catch and Sadeera smashes it to cover
"taken at deep cover, the typical Chahal strike. He is ever so good against attacking batsmen, mostly because he hides the ball. It seems just within their reach so that they think they can hit them out of the ground. But then he always bowls them so slow, and it is turning away as well, so if they do manage to catch up with it, they invariably mistime the ball. Sadeera falls into the trap playing a front-foot flay."
nudges a good length ball on middle to midwicket
"rocks back, and sensing the ball isn't quite as wide as normal, plays with a straighter bat to point"
"tosses it up on off stump, defends to cover"
"shortish delivery on off stump, firmly blocks"
"squares him up with a fullish delivery on off stump. Mathews, as has been his wont recently, plays off the back foot"
turns a shortish delivery off middle and off to deep midwicket
flirts with a back of a length delivery - aiming for a single to third man - and so very nearly nicks off. A touch of extra bounce off the slower ball
nudges it off his thigh pad to long leg
covers the line of a short delivery on off stump. Wicket-maiden followed by an over that costs only two runs. India regrouping.
quicker and flatter on leg stump. Tharanga kicks away his front foot and punches it back where it came
defends the faster delivery on middle and off
"goes for the lap sweep, but it results in no runs with India employing a short fine leg"
"goes off the pad as Chahal bowls rapidly, and on a good length on leg stump. Tharanga's sweep isn't quick enough"
"very full, almost a yorker, and it slides down leg to become a wide as Tharanga misses a flick"
<b>what a way to get to 1000 runs in ODIs in 2017</b>! Spots the loopy delivery that Chahal has been setting the batsman up for all over. And smites it over long-on with a cuh-lean swing of the blade.
defends a flighted delivery on off stump
"hangs back and taps a shortish delivery through midwicket, mostly off his body though."
"pulls the bouncer off his visor and down to long leg with considerable authority. Really really good shot, that. Keeps it down, perfectly balanced."
"goes over the top, and he's done it superbly! Picks an area of the ground without a boundary rider, and uses a straight bat to find the long-off boundary. Comes down the track too to better his chances against a length ball"
makes too much room as he hares down the pitch again and nearly swings himself off his feet. Looks like an unlocked gate swinging in the wind as the ball passes bat
"full on middle, Mathews turns it to short midwicket"
"back of a length and outside off, steers to cover"
"shortish and down leg, Tharanga half-pulls and half-sweeps it to long leg"
drives the flighted ball outside off to long-off
his bat's been sprayed with pixie dust cause anything that touches it is disappearing! What a shot. Picks the length ball outside off and hoicks it superbly over midwicket. <b>Into the nineties in style</b>!
"sweep, a hard-hit shot, out to deep square leg"
hangs on the back foot and adjusts to the good length ball ripping away from him with an open face
defends a faster delivery sliding on to middle
"and he produces a stumping appeal. Kuldeep tosses it up on and around off stump. The ball breaks away from Tharanga's bat as he is lured into driving away from the body. <b>And this is going to be so tight</b>. The leggie has done its job superbly, dragging Tharanga forward just enough that his back foot might just be on the line as Dhoni breaks the stumps. And the third umpire rules it out. What a ball! What a strike! And what an innings! Tharanga has been floating on clouds today and it needed a jaffa to make him trip up."
gets down low and yanks a tossed up delivery outside off and crashes it to the square leg boundary. What a sweep shot. Other players might have cover driven the same ball
"<b>beats him</b>! Healthy flight, and width as well. Dickwella loads up the cover drive, but the ball dips and turns past his bat"
"that's a clever little late cut. He picks the length early, pushes his back leg across as he goes deep in his crease and then taps the ball on top of the bounce to guide it to the third man boundary. Delicious shot"
"<b>he's guided it straight to slip</b>! Kuldeep is on song, but he really has been gifted this one. It's the quicker delivery, perhaps as a response to the boundaries, and it's just a touch short as well. Dickwella goes for that little late cut, but this time he's surprised by a little bit more turn than he bargained for. Searches for the ball and much to his dismay, finds it"
"googly, pushed across the right-hander. He defends well"
"shortish on middle, Mathews defuses it easily to deep square leg"
looks to flick the back of a length ball through midwicket. But it holds its line and takes a bit of a leading edge down the pitch
"shortish on middle stump, blocks"
"bouncer, a proper one, coming up to his neck. Asela sways away well"
angles the back of a length ball into his body and he flicks it through square leg
punches a back of a length delivery down the pitch

gets a bit of an inside edge as he defends a good length ball on off stump with hard hands.
"flighted delivery on off stump, defends to square leg"
nudges it to square leg again
"fuller delivery on off stump, safely negotiated with a straight bat"

"flighted delivery, pitching on leg stump and spinning away, past the flick shot to become a wide"
"generous flight outside off, Asela drives to cover"
presents the straight bat and punches the ball from the base of off stump to long-on
"low full toss, outside off, whips it to long-on"
"spins past the attempted flick shot, and Asela is overbalancing as well. Dangerous territory with Dhoni behind the stumps. Whips the bails off in a flash, but this time the back foot is grounded behind the line"
excellent sweep and he indulges in it only after he sees the ball looped up outside off - no chance of lbw then - and hammers it away to deep square leg. Only a single though with Mathews and Asela colliding while running between the wickets
"looks to bunt the ball down the ground, but the ball drifts away just enough to take the leading edge to cover"
defends with soft hands
back of a length and kicking up off the pitch so the cut shot doesn't quite work
"gets back and across to the short ball outside off and flays it to point. The ball is absolutely flying, but Karthik, dives to his right and saves a boundary"
"pummels it down the ground! See, this is all Sri Lanka have to do. See off the spinners and then feast on a flat pitch when the fast bowlers come on. Gets down the track to the length ball and nearly flattens the umpire!"
"goes for the bouncer, Mathews ducks under it"
pulls the short ball down and to the right of deep square leg
"attempted yorker on off stump, Asela keeps it out well."
"nicely bowled, some flight and loop on his legbreak, pushed towards point"
"flatter and quicker around leg, punched to long-on from the back foot"
"more loop and flight, around leg, smothered back"
"it's a tad shorter outside off, pushed to long-on from the back foot. Responsible batting"
"oh yes. That's a ripper. Mathews could not do much about that. Not many batsmen could. It's much shorter, but don't mistake a flatter trajectory for a bad delivery from a legspinner. Mathews doesn't, he stays earnest, trying to defend the ball but the ball generates plenty of turn despite that trajectory and length, beats the bat and hits middle and off stump after pitching on leg or just outside"
"flatter and quicker, pushed through again, hit back to the bowler. Terrific over"
"on a length around off, dabbed down to third man. Gunaratne's role becomes even more crucial"
that's a poor delivery. On the pads and Thisara flicks him through midwicket for a couple. Pulled back just inside
"full and wide outside off, Thisara bludgeons this through cover for a couple. A fumble on the boundary"
"136 kph, fullish delivery outside off, almost a yorker, driven to mid-off. Good single, well played"
"digs this one in short around off, Gunaratne lets the ball come onto him and then swivels into a pull to deep square leg"
"another yorker on middle and leg, worked to wide mid-on for another single. A nice seven off that"
"and another one. Thisara has been caught in front <strong>and he reviews</strong>! He makes two errors in that one ball. Firstly, he goes back and looks for a cut to a legspinner: the stock ball is always going to turn in, making the cut a very risky stroke. Secondly, he allowed himself to be beaten by not improvising the stroke because the length was short enough for him to stay back and get some bat on it. There is no bat on that. An umpire's call will have him: red, red and orange. SL keep their review but lose their captain"
"81 kph, flight outside off, driven back to the bowler"
"<strong>how is that?</strong> Why haven't they reviews that? Too much spin? Flight outside off, spins back in, hits the pad and lobs to leg gully. No interest"
"no slip! The googly this time, pitches on a good length, spins away, takes the edge and runs away through third man. Gobbled up by slip"
"flight on middle and leg, worked away towards square leg"
"more flight on middle and leg, off the inside edge towards square leg for another run. SL need what they can"
"full and wide outside off, sliced away to the sweeper cover on the off side"
"full around off, 131 kph, inside-halved down to fine leg for one"
"<strong>Bhuvneshwar misses a run-out</strong>. Absolute chaos. Fantastic work from Dinesh Karthik at point. Good length outside off, tapped towards backward point. He runs and dives to his left, fields the ball and one-bounces the throw to Bhuvneshwar, with Gunaratne running back after completing almost two runs, but the ball bounces out of his hands as he tries to palm it onto the stumps"

"<b>falls short of long-on</b>! Beautiful piece of bowling, Dananjaya tossing it up outside off, drawing the big shot, and then the dip forcing Rohit to inside edge the ball"
"flights it outside off, Dhawan sweeps and a diving Lakmal at short fine leg keeps it to a single"
uses his wrists to keep the tossed up delivery down as he plays to midwicket
"goes back, picking the length to be short enough, and turns it to midwicket"
"shapes for a big one again, but he is wise to the bowler getting dip and so makes sure to instead keep it down with a roll of the wrists"
"shortish and down leg, so far that Dhawan has no chance of reaching it"
"a hint of nip off the track, cramping Dhawan for room as he defends on off stump"
"continues getting handsome movement off the pitch, and bounce as well. Dhawan, caught in the crease, trying to flick the ball, is hit on the body"
"looks to flick a shortish delivery away off the hip, but he's not really timed the ball properly. Nearly pops up to short midwicket. I'm starting to wonder if the pitch is two-paced..."
"<b>beaten</b> outside off. Lakmal throws his head back, cussing his luck after watching a perfectly good length ball tempt Dhawan into an airy drive and dart past the outside edge"
"short and targeting the body with that seam movement into the left-hander. Dhawan defends, slipping deep into his crease"
"pulls it wide of long-on! Good shot, taking full toll of the length, and also providing proof that he is starting to assess the pace of this pitch better"
waits in his crease to allow the good length ball to turn and clips it to backward square leg
"that's monstrous! I could count up to about five before the ball came down into the crowd behind long-on! What hang time! What power! What a playa! Races down the pitch, the bat comes down from high over his head and finishes hitting his back as he launches a straight six"
""
"<b>through the gate</b>! Rippaaaahh! The Dananjaya googly strikes again. Rohit was launching the offbreaks into orbit but he does not read the ball from the back of the hand. Steps forward, tentatively, to defend, thinking it is a legbreak. But it bites into the pitch, on a good length area outside off, and surges through to hit middle."
whips a tossed up delivery on his pads to deep square leg.
"sweeps off middle stump - lbw be damned. Then again, if he can time it as well as that, he can keep playing it and force the spinner to change his tactics"
"on the pads, hits the pads as Dhawan tries to flick through square leg"
back of a length and holding its line outside off. Iyer ignores it
"<b>so close to off stump</b>; that's a pretty tight leave. Lakmal pitches it up, the pitch offers him just enough to allow the ball to dart back in. A few more inches and this game would have broken open"
ignores the shortish delivery outside off
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
tackles a shortish delivery on middle and sends it to midwicket
"superb shot and the ball screams away through midwicket! This is a tossed up ball, landing on a perfectly good area outside off, but Dhawan has hared out of his crease to meet it at its pitch and then his wrists do the rest"
"tossed up legbreak, Dhawan reads it, presses forward with bat and pad together and blocks"
"picks the offbreak, which is angled into middle, and defends gently"
nudges the legbreak to midwicket
"loads up the sweep, but the ball slides too far down leg for him to connect"
"flighted delivery on middle, Dhawan defends well"
leans forward to the tossed up offbreak outside off and pushes to cover
presents the full face to a back of a length delivery on off stump
"shortish and outside off, punches to cover"
"fuller delivery, swinging into him, brings out a checked flick. He's worried about closing the face against the moving ball"
"opens the face and guides the fuller delivery, with the seam movement, to third man"
"<b>big swing into the left-hander</b>. Dhawan aims for an off drive, but gets an inside edge onto pad"
gets down the track to flick the ball to the right of short midwicket
strides out to the pitch of a tossed up delivery on leg stump and drives inside out to long-off
"holds up in the pitch, and doesn't really turn. And because of that Iyer, looking to flick through midwicket, ends up punching to long-on"
""
"tosses it up outside off, Iyer get to the pitch and turns it to short midwicket"
shuffles across outside off and picks away the offbreak to deep square leg
steps forward with bat close to pad and defends with soft hands. He looks good; looks set
"on the pads and Iyer clips it neatly to deep square leg, off his back foot"
"stands up tall against the short ball outside off and lashes it behind point, with an angled bat, as opposed to horizontal. Signs that he is mindful of the risks involved playing the moving ball"
straight bat again as he gets behind a back of a length delivery and punches in front of point
"there's a short point, there's backward point, and there's a wide third man. All of them are useless as Dhawan charges down the track and flays the ball square on the off side. Sublime shot"
misses a full toss so badly - he is playing a flick - that Lakmal is lured into appealing for lbw. Might have clipped the flap of the pad as it goes to the wicketkeeper. But impact is outside off
slower ball outside off and Dhawan looks a picture of grace as he cover drives it to the fence.
closes the bat face against a legbreak on middle and gets a leading edge to third man.
drops it short and Dhawan rocks back to pull it to the deep midwicket boundary. Easy pickings. India have got 50. That's one-fourth of the target.
gets down the pitch and drills the good length offbreak to long-off.
legbreak wanders way down leg and Iyer does the simple thing - sweep past leg slip to the boundary
"goes around the wicket for a flighted offbreak outside off, Iyer drives to short cover"
advances at this offbreak - yorks himself really - and flicks it to short midwicket
"hangs back in his crease and carves the ball behind point. It has only a tiny bit of room, but he makes the most of it by leaning back from the ball"
"<B>misfield at deep midwicket</b>. Chaturanga de Silva, the sub for Suranga Lakmal, has it covered as he slides to his left. But it trickles past him. Too short from Mathews to start off and a firmly struck pull gets due reward"
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
"another strong shot, Iyer's bottom hand to the fore as a shortish delivery on off stump screams away to deep midwicket"
"and now he sends the ball sailing through cover, a top hand dominant shot. And this isn't a bad ball either. Pitched on a good length, outside off, with plenty of protection for this shot. Yet short cover, long-off and sweeper cover are spectators"
"slower ball, pitched on a shortish length. Iyer tries to dab it past slip, but a little bit of movement into him off the pitch ruins those plans"
"<b>dropped</b> at slip! Mathews is the man there, reaching up over his head to try and hang on to a cut shot coming off the top edge. Those have to stick."
rocks back and drills a shortish delivery to long-off
"fine leg is inside the circle, so Dhawan ensures he gets just enough bat to this good length ball on leg stump"
"comes down the pitch, and then has to adjust to the ball being quite slow. Dhawan delays his shot and flicks it to square leg. He's in form."
keeps to his crease to try and flick a good length ball on middle away. Doesn't quite do so and is struck fairly high on the pad. Pathirana appeals. Umpire says not out.
"huge appeal for lbw again and this looks fairly close. Umpire Menon shakes his head again and <b>Sri Lanka decide to review</b>. Quicker delivery from Pathirana, pitched up, squeezing past the inside edge and thudding into the knee roll of the front foot. Off stump and parts of middle is visible on impact. And Ball-tracking says it will be missing the stumps. Sri Lanka lose their review"
shuffles across onto off stump and deflects the short ball to long leg
"back of a length and outside off, blocks"
"shortish and outside off, Iyer lashes it to point"
softens the grip on the bat and opens the face as well to guide the shortish delivery to third man. Good batting.
"full and outside off, drives to mid-off"
"back of a length on off stump, blocks"
hangs back and slices the flatter delivery through cover
flings his front leg aside and drills the short ball on off stump to long-on
"slows it down, and gets the ball to slide on with the arm. Iyer, playing for turn, gets an inside edge. But Dhawan races across to the other end. He's been alert to every scoring opportunity"
"brutal sweep shot, taking the ball from leg stump and it would have thudded into the boundary boards if not for a big dive from the substitute de Silva"
steps out of his crease to slog the ball over midwicket. Instead he gets an inside edge to the long leg boundary
"presses forward as a trigger movement, but seeing the ball short, he rocks back and slaps through point"
<b>beats him</b> outside off as he pitches a short of a length ball in the off stump corridor. Iyer is squared up and pushing at the ball with hard hands
blocks a shortish delivery on off stump
"<b>almost taken at the third man boundary</b>! What an effort from Dananjaya, races to his right, puts in the full length dive, but it just eludes him. An upper cut from Iyer, which looked for all money as a very very clever shot, nearly ends up a brainfade"
"shortish delivery on off stump, blocks"
"back of a length and outside off, punches to mid-on"
"there is very little room to play the cut, but Iyer wants to, and so he sways away from the line of the short ball and chops it down to third man"
over wide long-on! India are motoring. Pathirana looks like a left-arm spinner who simply slides balls on with the arm . Iyer is aware of that as he races down the pitch and launches it with the angle from around the wicket
"tosses it up outside off, Iyer reaches for it and drives along the ground to reach a <b>second fifty in two matches</b>"
"fuller delivery on middle, tucks it behind square leg"
"cuts it away, playing late and placing the ball to the left of backward point. Brilliant batting. But have to say, pretty poor bowling. Just too short."
"tosses it up into the pads, Iyer opens himself up to push the ball inside out back down the pitch"
gets forward to nudge a flighted delivery on leg stump to short midwicket
"good length ball outside off, drives on the up to sweeper cover"
gets up on his toes and unleashes a picture perfect cover drive off the back foot. Those are the shot played by batsmen in prime form. One who is well in tune with the pace of the pitch
chops a shortish delivery angled into him to the third man region
"first he is ducking into the short ball, and then at the last minute, he tries a ramp over the keeper's head. No luck pulling it off though"
"<b>extra bounce</b> and with Iyer squared up, and trying to place the ball to mid-on, gets a leading edge"
"full on off stump, defends neatly"
strides down the pitch and thumps the flighted delivery back to the bowler
"advances again, but having not reached the pitch, and still trying to flick against the turn, he gets a leading edge to long-off"
slogs all across the line - a mistake born of his coming down the track too early and allowing Dananjaya to shorter his length and increase his pace. Struck on the pads outside off
"gorgeous shot! This is a flatter delivery on middle and leg. But he's picked the length so early, shifts so deep in his crease that he is in perfect position to flick the ball with that strong bottom hand through midwicket. Exquisite strike"
"tosses it up outside off, he nudges through midwicket"
""
"too short, sits up for Dhawan to pull through square leg for a run"
"on a length, around off, the channel is good, which forces Iyer to defend. There is a hundred here is he wants it badly enough"
"walks right across to flick to square leg, a manufactured run, the way Amla does"
"tripe, short around off, sits up again for Dhawan to swat through midwicket. Forehand slap cross court"

"good length outside off, chopped away down to third man"
"slow on middle and leg, worked to midwicket"
"more flight and loop around off, blocked towards cover"
"gets underneath it and Dhawan goes weeeeeee, over midwicket. A superbly-timed slog sweep over midwicket for six to <b>get to fifty</b>"
gets to the pitch and drives to long-on for one
"slow outside off, spins back in, Iyer makes room to cut and slashes to cover, too close for that shot"
"bottom hand power again. Samarawickrama looked for timing and the ball sliced to the sweeper cover, Iyer looked for power and the ball went much squarer, over cover for four."
"good length outside off, 129 kph, chopped away into the off side"
"fullish delivery outside off, dabbed down to third man for one. Too easy"
"full delivery outside off, 129 kph, pushed away to mid-off"
"eeks, that's a naughty heave. Full outside off, Dhawan unwinds but misses a wild slog"
on the pads and whipped through midwicket for a run
"inside edge, evades the stumps for a run down to fine leg"
"oh my, that has gone weelllllll down leg for a wide. Would have been wide to Dhawan"
"five more. Again, last match Gunaratne started with two wides, he did so here too. Drifts down leg for five. The keeper can't get close either. Naughty"
"another offcutter that drifts down leg, wide"
"strays down leg again but straight enough, nudged down to fine leg"
"another wide offcutter, chopped away towards cover this time"
"just short of Mathews at first slip, who is standing much deeper because apparently Gunaratne is quick. <strong>A thick edge</strong>"
"byes, Dhawan treats him like a spinner, attempts a sweep but misses, the ball dips late, beats the sweep, and goes past the keeper"
"slightly short and wide, Dhawan looks to sweep again but sees the width and improvises a cut. May I just say this has been a filthy over."
"good finish at least, shortish outside off, punched to the sweeper cover. I've never seen 17 runs scored off an over with not one shot hit in anger or frustration. That kind of day for Sri Lanka"
"good length around off, 132 kph, defended to cover."
"on the pads, worked to midwicket"
"lucky. India looking to end this early. Full outside off, runs down, looking to clear mid-off, a thick edge trickles to fine leg"
"and Iyer throws away his opportunity to make a hundred. 129 kph, short down leg, Iyer clears his front leg and shovels a swat, but can't get anywhere near the timing he wants, the ball skews off the top half of the bat and lobs to mid-on. India's normal No. 3 would not have thrown it away like that, that's where temperament makes a difference in international cricket, not just style or 'talent'"

"overpitched outside off, driven back to the bowler"
"good length outside off, Karthik opens his bat face but can't skew runs into the off side"
"did he walk too far? Yes, says the umpire. <b>Karthik reviews immediately</b>, was there bat? Oh yes, there was bat, a big under-edge. Full delivery down leg, Karthik kind of fell over the flick, but got some bat. Was a bit leg side too. The DRS is there for just this, well used"
"offcutter on middle and off, swept down to fine leg"

"sliced away, Gunathilaka dives to his left and parries it to third man"

"<b>the wide</b>, drifts down leg and Dhawan can't connect with a sweep"
"shortish and wide, slashed to backward point, can't pierce that gap"
"into the gap and that's four. Dhawan gets there with ease eventually. It was actually well down leg, swept away to the deep square leg boundary, right into the gap. Takes off his helmet and soaks in the applause from a raucous crowd for <b>another ODI hundred</b>"

"strays down leg, guess what? wide"
"and India take the series 2-1. Overpitched outside off, lofted over cover to finish the series as <strong>India cruise to their eighth straight ODI series win</strong>"
