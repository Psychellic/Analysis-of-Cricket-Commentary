"back of a length, steered out to point off the back foot to get things up and running"
"defends from a length, and gets a glare from Conway in his follow-through"
"<strong>crashed away for six over cover-point!</strong> Serious shot. A bit of width from Conway, and Fletcher frees his arms, finally finding the middle of the bat. It lands just over the rope - 65-metre six"
"takes the pace off this time, and Fletcher inside-edges into the crease"
"back of a length outside off, and <strong>Fletcher clubs him over midwicket for six more!</strong> Very spicy. No foot movement, weight back, full extension of the arms, and Fletcher hits his second maximum of the over"

"<strong>moosed over midwicket and dropped by the big man in the stands!</strong> On a length, Stoinis rocked back and slugged over cow corner. 80 metres, and old mate in the third row slips and shells it!"

"full and straight, clipped to wide long-on"
"half-volley outside off, and Stoinis thrashes out to long-off for one more"

"ooft, Stoinis playing with fire. Length ball on fourth stump, Stoinis clears the front leg looking to open up the off side, but can't lay a bat on it. Not far away from the top of off!"

"back of a length, quick and flat, and Larkin miscues the pull down to long-on"
"fuller, Stoinis laces it out to deep cover"
"vicious googly, back of a length, which Larkin hardly picks. Cut shot, which can't beat backward point"
"<b>got 'im!</b> Wicked googly, full of a length, and Larkin never really stood a chance. He couldn't read it out the hand, cleared the front leg and swung wildly, and loses his middle stump. King Khan strikes"
"<b>another first-baller for Maxwell! Rashid has two in two and that is a huge moment!</b> Wide half-volley outside the off stump, not the best ball he'll bowl tonight by any means. Maxwell almost paid it too must respect, shaping to steer over the off side with an open face. He mistimed it, and Briggs took a simple chance at backward point"

worked out to square leg from outside off
"speared in at the pads, nudged into the leg side for one"
"full googly on off stump, <b>Stoinis short-arm jabs through midwicket for four!</b> No fear or respect. Not quite timed, but dragged through the leg side"
"drops short with the legbreak, pulled to Salt at long-on on the bounce. Stoinis groans in frustration, feeling he should have hit that one for another boundary"
driven out to wide long-off
"beauty! Beats him with a flat, fast, full legbreak, which turns past the outside edge of Stoinis' prod"

"googly, worked into the leg side for one"
"length ball on fifth stump, defended into the covers"
"drops short, skied off the hip... and <strong>Wells shells a sitter on the rope!</strong> Awful drop, and Gillespie looks furious in the dugout. Stoinis shaped to pull, top-edged it straight to deep square leg, and Wells put down the sky ball"

"back of a length, defended off the back foot"
swivel-pulls down to long leg
"back of a length, skews up off the edge, <strong>and Weatherald takes the catch!</strong> Stoinis is furious, smacking his pads with his bat repeatedly. Agar roars in celebration, and Wells breathes a deep sigh of relief. Checked his shot, looking to punch through mid-off, and it squirted up off the outside edge. Simple catch"

"yorker on the pads, whipped out to deep midwicket"
"another yorker outside off, steered into the off side for a scampered single"

"low full toss, sliced away to cover-point but can't beat the fielder"
"yorker on leg stump, chipped out towards mid-on"
"strays down the leg side, Agar's first bad ball of the over. Flicked something on the way through. The diving Carey got half a glove to it, but could only push it down towards fine leg. Don't <i>think</i> it was a chance, but given as runs"
"<b>yes he can!</b> Low full toss on the stumps, Gotch tries to give himself room to hit over the off side but loses his shape and chips it up to Rashid Khan, who takes a simple chance at cover. The Stars lose their sixth and are limping towards the finish line"
"banged in halfway down, pulled into the leg side"
"strays down the leg side, Maddinson flicks off the pads and Briggs can only tip it over the crossbar at short fine leg! Half-chance, nothing more. He leapt at full extension but could only get a fingertip to it"
"<b>classy uppercut for four more!</b> Banged in short, following Maddinson as he backed away to leg. Gets the uppercut out, ramping it between Carey and short third man"
worked away to midwicket
"cutter on a length, Zampa is beaten all ends up and <b>is knocked over!</b> In fact, looked like the back-of-the-hand slower ball. Zampa didn't pick it, and saw his middle stump pegged back."
"yorker yet again, and Maddinson can only dig it out back to the bowler"
"drops too short, and Maddinson <b>slugs it over midwicket for six</b>. Slower ball, which he picked, and it's such a short boundary that a 63-metre hit clears the rope quite easily"

"hangs a wide one outside the off stump, trying to get out of Maddinson's hitting arc, but too wide"
"full on the pads, whipped out to deep midwicket"
"clears the front leg and <strong>belts him over cover for four!</strong> Thrashed away with a full extension of the arms, and that will put a dent in Agar's figures. They're still very impressive: 2 for 19 in his four."

"drops deep in the crease, pace-on this time, but can't get it away, inside-edging into the pads"

"slower-ball bouncer, and Maddinson misses the upper-cut. Looked like it was comfortably above head-height, but given as a dot"
"<b>beats Rashid Khan at deep midwicket on the rope!</b> That's more like it. Not a particularly clean connection, but enough to clear the boundary-rider"
"low full toss on the pads, and <b>clears Renshaw at deep square leg this time!</b> Maddinson and the Stars finish with a flourish. Poor ball to finish from Worrall, and Maddinson got enough bat on the whippy flick to beat the man on the boundary"

"hint of turn, optimistic lbw appeal as he's struck on the pad but sliding down"
"full on off stump, and <b>Renshaw slog-sweeps him into the stands!</b> Maybe a fraction too full, but Renshaw premeditated, and moosed it over the rope at square leg."

"nibbling in off the seam, Salt nudges to square leg"
"another loose swing outside the off stump, no connection"

defended back to the bowler from a length. Still a hint of movement
"<b>slapped over the covers for four more!</b> Again, too much width from Rainbird, and Salt is happy to have a go at it. Slashed up in the air, but comfortably over the ring"
"edged, and Gotch <b>can't quite take a spectacular catch!</b> On a length, Salt freed his arms again and got a thick edge. Full-length dive from Gotch behind the stumps, but he could only parry it down to third man for four"
worked to mid-on for one more
"<b>picks out the man at deep square leg!</b> Renshaw's frenetic innings comes to an end. Rainbird went fullish outside the off stump, and Renshaw shuffled over looking to whip this over the leg side.

"back of a length, cut away to deep point"
"length outside off, forced away through cover point"
"<b>beauty! 90mph/145kph</b>, on a length, and Carey is beaten for pace as he looks to clip through midwicket. It flies over the top of the off stump, not far at all from clipping the bail"

"short outside the off stump, Salt latches onto the pull and scampers back for the second run"
"<strong>slashed away for four via the edge!</strong> Back of a length, Carey tried to punch through the off side but got a thick edge down to third man"
"big shout for lbw, but the umpire isn't interested. Must have been worth a shout if it hit the pad first, but there were two noises. They take a quick single, and it's given as a run rather than a leg bye"

"length outside off, crashed out to deep cover"

"skied up to Hatcher at long-off <strong>who swallows the catch and the Stars are buzzing!</strong> Big celebrations from both fielder and bowler. Salt didn't need to play the big shot but decided he would look for a straight six.

driven straight to extra cover
"full on the pads, whipped to short fine leg"
"gets down to reverse looking for a boundary to secure the point, but the connection isn't good and <strong>Maddinson dives to take a beauty in tight at short third man!</strong> Incredible stuff. Maxwell had a backward point and a short third man inside the ring, telling Zampa he was happy for Carey to take on the reverse if he wanted with three needed for the bonus point. That's exactly what he did, switching his stance looking to flip it over the infield, but Maddinson scrambled back to take a great catch! <b>High drama and the Stars are back in this!</b>"
