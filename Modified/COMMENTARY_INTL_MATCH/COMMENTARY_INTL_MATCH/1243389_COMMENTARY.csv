"full length and a hint of swing, squirted with a hard-handed push to the leg side"
"width, and clattered fiercely behind square, an important - and excellent - half-stop at backward point, as Roy gets off the mark"
"<B>wicket to wicket and pinned lbw!</B> Buttler shuffles across his stumps, trying to work to the leg side, but that skidded from just back of a good length, into the knee-roll, and he knows there's no recourse there! That was smashing leg stump, and well, that's the start India needed!"
"beaten outside off, and there's more skiddy bounce to contend with as Malan plays just inside the line"
right behind the line to defend as Malan bides his time
"<strong>open-faced elegance through the covers!</strong> There's the flip-side of the skiddiness, if there's a hint of width, then placing the bat through the line can bring its rewards. Eased to the rope to get England up and running"
"<B>kapow!</B> In the arc, a bog-standard off-spinner, and Roy plants the front foot and boshes it handsomely over long-on! Out come the wet wipes as the crowd returns the ball"
"drags the length back, into the pitch, and Roy flashes into the off side"
"shuffling across the crease, and nudged to mid-on for a single"
"full face of the bat, Sundar is once again back of a length, challenging Malan with an exploratory push to cover"
"driving again, but without power, as Malan gets the measure of the conditions"
"round the wicket, a shimmy to the pitch, but Malan's more forceful thump across the line takes an under-edge to midwicket. That's a good recovery from that first-ball tonking"
angled defence into the off side
"<B>nip off the deck, flicks the back pad</B> and Pant can't do anything about that! A fine deflection, wide of his diving gloves. That was going over the stumps so no appeal"
"<B>out comes the hack through midwicket!</B> Roy loves to swing through a good length, down the track, lots of bottom hand, and dragged through the gap. Not fully intended, direction-wise, but intent-wise, there were only two outcomes"
flicked off the legs to the gap at midwicket
"keeps low on off stump, a slower ball and Malan gets behind the line with a dabbed defence"
"hoicked to the leg side, finds enough of a gap to rush back for the second. Steady enough from England so far, after their early set-back"
"back of a length, off-stump line, wafted down to long-on"
"gives himself room to leg, and flogs a firm cut into the cover ring. Power, but straight at the man"
"a gallop to the pitch, Sundar sees him coming, drags his length down, and another under-edged slog ends up as a single to midwicket"
"Sundar is digging his offbreaks into the deck, Roy unfurls a cramped pull to the leg side as the ball zips into his stroke"
"round the wicket, leg-sided, Malan tries to sweep, can't get it away. Half an appeal but didn't straighten quite enough"
"<B>walloped up and over long-on!</B> Timely from Malan, making room to leg again, and this time making firm contact with a ball in his arc. He's not fluent yet but he's keeping his run-rate there or thereabouts"
"a woolly whoosh from Roy, trying to smash Thakur off his length, but the cross-seamer just hops a touch over his intentions"
"plinked off the toes, sweet contact on the very full length, but the square leg sweeper tidies up"
"banged in short, too short for the square-leg umpire's liking. But good thinking, that just looped through to the keeper"
"on the legs, and <B>flicked inches short of backward square!</B> A yard either side, that was a freebie four, a notch more wood on the shot, and that was a catch!"
"<B>a genuine nick to a wafty drive</B>, but there's no first slip in this format, and that's dribbled to the rope! A terrible shot in a Test match, a look-in-the-scorebook today"
"flowing into the covers with another full-throttle drive, this time finding something closer to the middle of the bat"
"makes room to the leg-side, and Roy is beaten by an excellent sixth delivery, fourth-stump line, very full, eluding the toe of his bat as he tries to adjust"
"flipped to the on-side, another single to the cause"
"very full length, clipped off the knee-roll to backward square"
"opens the face on the back foot, and pushed to cover"
"very full length, but missing the mark a touch, and sliding past the pads"
"<strong>carved away over a back-pedalling Iyer in the covers!</strong> Roy was giving himself room again, but had to stretch at the end of his stroke, and the toe-ended biff loops some three feet out of the fielder's reach"
pressed to mid-off for another single
"back of a length, tight line, nurdled without power off the legs, and that's the end of a cagey powerplay. England haven't cut loose, but nor are they 22 for 3..."
"outside off, no great turn as Roy allows himself a sighter"
"lines up the reverse sweep to that fifth-stump line, but can't connect"
"<B>that one does turn!</B> More air, back of a length, wider line, Roy's back foot is anchored as he misses his mow to leg"
"more turn on a wide line, but too wide this time"
"biffed hard, back through the line, and gathered well by the bowler"
"<B>clonked into the stands!</B> So quick to adjust to the straighter line, faster and flatter, but too short as well, and tonked high over midwicket!"
"another attempted sweep, can't connect"
"<B>drilled through the covers!</B> That should really have been intercepted at wide mid-off by Thakur, but Malan's meaty blow does enough to elude him"
"angled bat, into the off side, another single to keep ticking along"
"tight line, shaping into the legs, and deflected behind square off the thigh"
"<B>flat-batted back past the bowler!</B> That's a tennis smash from back of a length, never a catch, but nearly a decapitation!"
"advancing to the pitch, another slower-ball bouncer, and Roy thumps down on the stroke once more, through mid-on"
"very full length, and punched up to mid-off"
"<B>huge appeal on the reverse sweep!</B> A long deliberation, and Malan isn't very keen to look at the umpire... not out is the eventual call, but but golly, that is mighty tight! Surely pitching in line and heading towards off!"
"another sweep, a cackle of glee from Pant, which rather confirms that, yes, <B>this time India will review!</B> Did this pitch outside leg? The other actually looked closer, but both are incredibly tight... <B>it's pitched on leg, and it's hitting!</B> Malan had no answer to either of those deliveries, and his half-formed innings is over!"
"flogged out through the leg side, a bit toe-ended, but enough contact to get off the mark"
"another reverse-sweep, more missed connections than Craigslist. Half an appeal but a shake of the head"
"<B>reverse swept, and time time nailed through backward point!</B> Fifth time lucky"
"Roy climbs into the cut, but can't connect on the wider line"
"<B>Now then, Roy is finding his reverse gear at last!</B> Well played, with power through third man, as Chahal hit the deck outside off with this one, and found some extra bounce. Almost a reverse pull in execution"
"very full length, poked with caution to the on-side for the single. Kohli demolishes the stumps as he gathers, and<B> the ball ricochets for an overthrow!</B>"
clipped to the leg side
pumped into the off side
"cheeky from Bairstow, rocking back for the slower-ball bouncer and dabbing the single to third man. The lack of pace means it's just a single but the adjustment was impressive"
"back of a length, tight line, a short-arm pull to mid-on"
"banged in short, outside off, Roy unleashes another tennis smash in front of square. We're halfway through"
"strays on the pads, tucked through square leg for a single"
"<b>dropped</b> but that was hit hard. Drags it short and Roy rocked back to slam this flat-batted to Chahal's left. He went for the catch and the ball pinged him on the left thumb before rolling to long-off. The kind of catch that either sticks or doesn't. Was hit so hard back, Chahal had to react instinctively. Getting his left thumb looked at now."
"floats this fuller, drifts a bit. Bairstow looking for the slog sweep to send this to downtown Ahmedabad, doesn't connect."
"connects well with this, but just a single to long-off. Chahal varying his lines, this is wide outside off and Bairstow throws his bat at it, reaching for it."
"length on the stumps, leg-break turning away, goes back and punches to long-off's right"
"<b>cracking shot</b>. This wasn't short by any means, quick leg-spinner on off, not giving him room, but he went back and used incredible bottom hand power to slap-pull this very straight, right past the bowler and into the straight boundary"
"<b>caught at deep square leg</b>. Well caught by Bhuvneshwar. Roy was looking to go over cow corner, to a full ball on leg stump, didn't get properly underneath it, and the ball goes squarer than he intended off the bottom part of the bat. Swirls high in the air and Bhuvneshwar moves to his left and then lunges further in that direction to hold on."
punched to long-on
"length outside off, tapped back to the bowler's right, he dives and fields"
"<b>stunning wristwork</b>. It's not like Sundar's giving it a lot of flight, but it's full and Morgan makes some room and uses wrists to go inside out over extra cover. Marvellous connection and into the gap"
"flatter outside off, punched to long-off"
"flatter and fullish, went for the sweep early. Got it decently but straight to short fine leg, so no run"
"back of a length on the stumps, Morgan was charging down and making room, ended up cramping himself. Doesn't connect with the cut, as the ball goes over his bat, just past ribs"
"<b>under-edge goes to the fine leg boundary</b>. This one was wider outside off and he threw his bat at it, got an inside edge that beats Pant's dive to his right. Unlucky for Shardul"
stays beside the ball and pushes to point
"good work by Iyer at deep square leg, running quickly to his right to slide and stop. A bit too short and this is whammed across the line"
"<b>and now Iyer over-runs the ball</b>. Full outside off and Morgan carves it over cover powerfully, and Iyer is sprinting to his left this time. Thinks the ball is travelling quicker than it is, and over-runs, as it trickles into the boundary behind him before he can adjust"
"<b>pinged on the grille with a slower bouncer</b>. Morgan completely foxed by that, way too early into the pull. The ball hits him flush on the grille and rolls down for four leg-byes to the fine leg boundary"
"flatter and quicker on a length on leg, he goes down to slog sweep but is beaten by the pace, struck on the thigh pad"
"<b>just clears Surya at deep square leg</b>. Bairstow was setting up for the line down leg, gave himself room and unleashed a powerful pull shot. Doesn't get that much height on it. Suryakumar leaps up at the boundary and the ball brushed his fingertips while going over. He was standing about a metre inside the rope - right back and he might have caught it easier."
"excellent fielding by Kohli at midwicket. Too short and he rocks back to pull again, connects well. The ball is travelling but Kohli moves to his right and dives to stop the ball."
"fuller angled into him from round the wicket, tapped to long-off"
"<b>caught by Suryakumar at deep square leg</b>. He juggled it, but held on. Bairstow is going for everything, and this one was slowed down and bowled wider outside off, got the toe-end of the bat from his slog sweep. Goes high in the air and Surya runs in from the boundary and catches it. Almost spills it but then holds on and he's overjoyed."
"flatter and quicker, on leg stump, tucked through square leg"
"length on the stumps, denying him room, clipped through square leg"
"fuller on a sixth stump line, comes on the front foot to clip it to long-off"
"keeps it on the stumps, not keen to give Morgan room, worked around the corner"
"flatter and quicker on leg stump, tucked off his pads through midwicket"
"<b>spiffing</b>. You can't do anything about that as a bowler. Fuller on off, but Morgan pulls out a perfect reverse sweep, that is also placed perfectly to beat point."
"conventional sweep now, and he'll get a single to deep square leg"
"too wide outside off, going across him, and he'll have to rebowl that"
"back of a length going across him, stays beside it and flays it through cover. There's protection in the deep"
"charging down the track to smite him over cow corner, the bowler shortens his length a bit and Stokes misses it. Pant can't collect cleanly to his right so they get one"
"excellent yorker. Morgan can only dig it back out to the bowler, who turns around quick as a flash to make as if to throw down the stumps at his end, Stokes scrambles back"
"wider outside off, throws his bat at it and splices it over the in-field, bounces towards deep cover"
"fuller on the stumps, whacks it through midwicket"
"slower ball, outside off, driven to long-off. Went hard at it, too hard to time it properly"
"yorker outside off, driven through cover"
"slower short ball, he has to wait for it and doesn't read it, mistimes the pull that trickles to square leg"
"back of a length outside off, taken the pace off again, more than the last ball. 113 clicks only. He has to wait for it and ends up softly flat-batting it through midwicket"
"<b>scooped over short third man</b>. Improvisation from Stokes there, to counter Hardik's pace-off strategy. Got into position to dilscoop almost, but ended up changing direction and going the other way. Chahal sprints back from inside the circle and pulls it back inside the boundary"
"<b>swing and a miss</b>. Charging down to crash this through extra cover, can't connect."
"excellent finish by Hardik with a slower bouncer. Stokes hasn't read that at all, and is in position to pull too early. Starts the shot too early too, and the ball hits him on the bat when it's nearly over his shoulder and thuds back into the ground near him. Could have rolled onto the stumps"
"<b>slower ball gets him</b>. Superbly disguised. Morgan was giving himself room and looking to go over extra cover, this was the off-cutter and bowled very wide outside off, Morgan ends up toe-ending it straight up and Pant takes an easy catch."
"<b>almost carries to Ishan at point</b>. A bit too close to his body to cut, and he doesn't attempt to force the shot, so it goes limply off his bat. Kishan gathers it just in front of him. Another slower ball"
"fuller outside off, opens the face to steer to third man"
"low full toss outside off, another slower ball but he's read that and guides it nicely through backward point. They push hard and get a third because there's no fielder there and this is hit softly enough to require a long sprint"
"fuller on the stumps, pushed to cover. too early into the shot, another slower ball - 115 kph. They're not reading Shardul's slower ones."
"fuller on the stumps, clipped off his toes to midwicket"
"length ball, well wide of off stump, stands tall and slaps it to long-off. Slower one again"
"and just as I say that Bhuvneshwar bowls a 136kph one outside off on a length, going across Stokes. He's sitting down and trying to scoop over the keeper, can't connect"
"excellent from Bhuvneshwar again. Sees Stokes coming down and fires in a yorker that is dug back out to the bowler. He's got smarts too, because as soon as he gets the ball he turns around quick as a flash to see if there's an opportunity to run the non-striker out. but Curran was back"
misfield by Pandy at cover. Punched to him and he lets it through
"<b>Stokes connects with one</b> Too full and he clears his front leg and absolutely slams it straight. Goes over the umpire who was ducking, and pings into the boundary"
"length well outside off, cuts fiercely but only a single since there is a fielder in the deep"
"pace off again, on a length, the off-cutter. Stokes wanted to swat that way over, gets it off the bottom half to midwicket. Sprints hard for the first and wants a second but can't get one"
"<b>swing and a miss</b>. They scamper a bye. Curran can't read the variations of his CSK teammate either, another slower one but fuller and wider outside off, went for the big drive, and couldn't connect"
"<b>superb from Thakur</b>. This assortment of off-cutters is completely foxing England. Stokes clears his leg and aims over cover, can't lay bat on ball and swishes and misses"
<b>caught at long-on</b>. Stokes has not got his timing right at any point in this innings and another pace variation has him mistiming a pull that plops up for an easy catch to Hardik at long-on
<b>beaten once again</b> The offcutter that pitches on a length and is going across the left-handed batsman. He swings and is beaten by a long way
"they finally connect one cleanly. Length outside off and he lifts it straight, over the bowler and bounces into the boundary"
"swing from the outset, very full, tailing back in and beating Rahul outside off stump. Tidy"
"right up to the stumps, pressed back to the bowler, Curran flings the ball at the stumps, the deflection off the pads goes very fine and Buttler sweeps round to gather"
"full face of the bat, respectfully pushing the length ball to mid-off"
tucked off the pads to the on-side
"on the legs once more, tight, and full, and dabbed to the on-side"
"<B>edged and gone!</B> Curran pushes the final ball of his opening over straight across Rahul's bows, no swing this time, and that's a thin but palpable snick through to the keeper! A wicket maiden to launch England's defence, and now we've got a battle"
"<B>a flick off the pads and Kishan is off the mark first ball!</B> Tight line from Archer, but too tight on this occasion, a simple tickle round the corner"
"jabbed with an open face, into the off side. It's easy at this level...."
"angled into the right-hander, fenced off the legs and Kohli is off the mark for the series"
"attempted flog off the hips, can't connect as the ball lobs to the leg side"
"full length, tight line, tucked to midwicket with a compact prod"
"a flamboyant waft of the wrists to meet the wider line, but point is on hand to tidy up. Still, encouragingly free-flowing signs for the new boy"
tapped off the pads to square leg. Curran's analysis is all the ones - 1.1-1-1-1
"back of a length, and <B>Kishan climbs into the pull!</B> In front of square, not timed to absolute perfection, but acres of space as the ball lands ten yards in and skids to the rope"
pressed forward and into the off side
"back of a length, curling back in towards the front pad, and tapped behind square"
"pressing forward on an off-stump line, kisses a fat inside-edge and that's an easy single through square leg"
patted into the covers to complete the over
"too short from Archer, <B>Kohli rocks back and pummels the pull in front of square!</B> Sits up nicely from that length, but he was so early into position. Pressure on Archer with another early boundary"
"tucked to the leg side, slightly fuller length"
"attempted biff from a leg-stump line, thumps the pad and they steal the single to short square leg"
"pushed uppishly into the off side, punching through the line"
"sharp pace from Archer, lifting past a half-cocked defence as Kohli belatedly drops his hands and sways. 146kph that time"
"banged in short once more, a deflected pull to the leg side to pick off the single"
"<B>flicked down the leg side and dropped!</B> Kohli was wafting across the line, as the ball was already heading past his hips, and had Buttler gone with one hand not two he might have clung on!"
"flashed to the off side, Kohli heads to the far end to ponder his team's position"
"<B>crashed out to deep square leg .... but short of Malan</B>. That was travelling, but in the air for a long way. Malan did well to gather on the bounce in the skiddy conditions"
"slower ball from Jordan, nudged to the off side"
"<B>too short this time, and helped behind square!</B> Is that drop going to cost England? In a dogfight, Kohli has the mentality to make the difference. Pace on this time, and pays the price"
"another slower ball, fuller length, wafted to wide long-off where it's gathered with a slide"
"<B>monstered over long-on!</B> Now then, welcome to the game Tom Curran. Right in his slot outside off, and thumped high into the stands!"
"opens the face on a fuller length, and poked to point"
"back of a length, wide line, and <B>spanked through the covers!</B> That's tremendous hitting, Curran offers up far too much width, and there's no point hitting the pitch if the batsman can free his hands quite like that"
"better line, much fuller too, and nudged to the on side"
"over the wicket, very full again, Kohli leans into a push to mid-off"
"round the wicket, banged in short, <B>and battered behind square!</B> This has been a poor over from TCurran, and it's given India the lift-off they needed in the powerplay. Up comes the fifty"
"short from the outset, into the pitch, and crunched out to deep square leg"
"back of a length, leg-sided, Kohli is through his whip too soon, and nearly chops a cutter onto his stumps. Was that the back of the bat? An over-step too... <B>a free hit!</B>"
"<B>aiming over the leg side, a massive edge over third man!</B> That has simply whistled into the stands! England are leaking runs everywhere now!"
"a stride to the pitch, and a nudge to midwicket"
"onto the front foot, and pushed to cover"
"<B>short again, slammed again!</B> High over deep square leg with huge power! That was all off the muscle and timing, because that ball was dying as he reached the shot"
"jabbed into the off side, and well, it seems a long time ago that England opened with a wicket maiden"
"opens the face on a wide line, and eased down to deep point. Googlies galore to the leftie, you sense"
"another googly, middle-and-leg, and blocked to the on-side"
"<B>there goes Kishan again!</B> Down on one knee, and clobbered murderously through deep midwicket!"
"<B>straight in and out of Stokes' hands!</B> Oh lordy, that's the worst drop of his life! A front-of-the-hander from Rashid, Kishan was done for all money as he boshed through the line and scuffed it straight at mid-on. It was chest-height, fingers up. Down. Game over?"
tentatively blocked to the off side
"Kohli nudges the single to keep the strike, and well, I think everyone's still a bit shocked by the ease of that chance!"
"open face, punched through point"
"tight to the pads, but tucked to the leg side"
"attempted launch off the legs, and missed"
"patted to the off-side, there's a lull in intensity after the drop. England need a spark, India just need to cruise along"
"<B>proper wheels from Archer!</B> Given as a wide, but Kishan knew little about that, as he flashed at thin air. 145kph"
prodded back to the bowler on a very tight line
"shanked to deep square leg, hauled from an off-stump line"
"<B>yawned over deep midwicket!</B> That just dipped into Kishan's arc, and he utterly tonked it, a leg-break too, so right in the slot for him"
"<B>massacred into the stands!</B> It looked for all the world like another top-edge, but in fact it plugs about 15 yards back over long-on on the concourse. Hell of a way to reach a debut fifty!"
"wide line, drilled into the off side"
"down on one knee, attempting the reverse sweep and misses out"
"chiselled to the leg side, feet already pumping into his first run as he makes contact. This is getting very one-sided now!"
"<B>gets in a tangle on the reverse hoick, and given lbw!</B> Kishan is keen to review, but that was out of the front of the hand again, and it just skidded through, under his intentions. Clipping off stump? If so, he's gone... <B>indeed it is!</B> England have their breakthrough"
"length outside off, pushed to long-off"
"full, swinging into him a bit, driven on the front foot to mid-off"
"length, stump to stump, tucked to midwicket on the front foot and they take the quick single"
"length on the pads, and Kohli uses those wonderful wrists to work it backward of square"
"dancing down the track, the bowler saw him and banged it in short on off stump, Pant ended up being a bit cramped for room while pulling this to square leg"
"slower ball, length on leg stump, worked off the front foot through backward square leg. Played with soft hands so he was looking for the second, but it's not on"
"length outside off, goes back and punches through cover"
"<b>boom</b>. Tossed up on leg stump, very invitingly so for Pant, who casually goes down and unleashes a monstrous slog-swept six. Monstrous. Bigger hit than Kishan's too."
"googly, too short, stays beside it and cuts languidly through point"
"quicker and shorter, on leg stump, tapped to fine leg"
"googly again, stays back to it and pushes softly towards mid-off for a quick single"
"length ball on the stumps, leg-break, pushes it softly with the turn to cover and they sprint for the quick single. <b>Pant has to scramble to make the crease and he does so.</b> The direct hit means they get a second too"
"fuller outside off, floated up with pace off, swats a sweep to long-on"
steps forward and drives through extra cover
"length outside off, slapped to cover"
"fuller outside off, leans into a cover drive. The man in the circle manages to dive and get a hand to it to slow the ball's progress"
"bouncer on the stumps, rides the bounce and keeps it down, pulling through square leg, but not perfectly timed"
"he's just climbed into that with raw power. Slower bouncer outside off and just sat up, Pant slaps it over cover and into the boundary. Had no pace to work with but the ball still went racing"
"dances down the track, and whips this off his thigh pad through midwicket"
"<b>walloped</b>. He's just smashed that. Full outside off, plonks his front foot down and leathers an extra cover drive. Good thing it's into the gap, might have taken a fielder's head off"
"and now he's scythed one for six even though it's not off the middle of the bat. Full and well wide of off, Pant throws his bat at it ferociously and pings it over the cover boundary."
"<b>caught at deep midwicket</b>. Closed the face too early in trying to flick this full ball off his pads, and the leading edge loops up for a simple catch. Ironically, it's a shot where he was not looking to blast the ball that has got him out."
"full outside off, shows the full face of the bat while punching to long-off"
"length ball sliding on the pads, he moves inside the line and flicks it away expertly through square leg. The timing of a man who's in some good form - as Iyer is."
"skipping down the track, but T Curran shortens his length and Kohli pushes from close to his body to long-on"
"length on the stumps, worked to fine leg on the front foot"
"<b>oh gorgeous</b>. What a stunning shot to reach fifty for Kohli. Dances down the track, gets to the pitch of the ball and essays a picture perfect lofted on-drive, with the full face of the bat shown. One fluid motion and the ball's sailing into the sight screen as he holds his pose"
"down the track again, but keeps it on the ground this time, punching to cover"
"fuller on the stumps, clipped off his pads to mid-on's right"
"he was moving around in his crease to throw the bowler off, ends up giving himself room but T Curran keeps it back of a length in the channel and Kohli can't quite reach it. He's upset with himself, probably though he should have smacked that away"
"starts off flat and full into him, clipped to long-on"
"<b>beauty</b>. And there's a stumping appeal. This is very close and Kohli might be gone with boot on the line, and nothing behind the line. There might just be a smidgen behind the line actually. A millimetre. <b>And Kohli survives</b>. Great ball that dipped on him outside off even as Kohli was drawn into the drive, dipped and gripped and turned away, making Kohli lose balance a bit. Buttler was quick to whip the bails off"
"fuller, comes forward and drives to cover. Thinking about the single but Roy dives to his right and stops the ball, then quickly releases it."
"shorter outside off, cut to deep point"
"leg break on leg stump, turning across him, he opens his stance and whacks it to deep midwicket"
"slightly shorter, stays back and punches it to long off"
"length on the stumps, jammed through midwicket"
"length on a fourth stump line, stays beside it and punches through cover"
"swatted across the line to a back of length ball outside off, but midwicket does well to tumble to his right and stop it"
launches into a lofted extra cover drive but doesn't time it too well. It's carried over the in-field though and there's no fielder back there so it'll trickle into the boundary
"quick bouncer. On target at the stumps and Kohli is late on the pull. And not in great position either, Had to duck a bit to pull because that was headed for his head"
"fuller on the stumps, driven to mid-off's left, who dives and stops"
"he's missed out there. Full toss that he swats fine, there's a fine leg there. Kohli shows mild frustration at missing out on a potential boundary"
"moving across then backing away, but Jordan bowls a bumper on the stumps and Iyer is too close to cut it, ball goes over his bat"
"full outside off, driven to mid-on"
<b>wrist power</b>. Full on the pads and he whips it with wrists of steel. The ball rockets through square leg and into the boundary
"<b>finishes with a six and also reaches 3000 T20I runs</b>. A dominant shot to end a dominant performance. Short ball that he moves inside the line to, and pulls over fine leg, almost nonchalantly done."
