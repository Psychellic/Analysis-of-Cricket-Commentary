"picks it up and smashes it to the midwicket boundary. Fine shot from Shehzad, picking up the short ball so early, shifting his weight back and hitting it so cleanly"
"adjusts his length, pitching it a touch fuller on off stump, so Shehzad blocks with a straight bat"
"some swing away from the flashing bat. Shehzad's feet this time are not quite in the best position, rooted to the crease. The width on the ball makes him play but his timing is terrible"
"dreadful misfield from Samuels at midwicket. And for a mistimed hack across the line, Shehzad has got a boundary. And that too is only because Asghar, who is chasing the ball down, puts in a panic-stricken dive, even as it holds up in the outfield. He touches the ball, and at the same time his knee touches the rope"
"tip and run towards point, but this is going to be risky. Hafeez is the man hunting the ball down, and with a direct hit, there might have been trouble"
"back of a length on middle and leg, Wright dinks it around the corner behind square leg and Haris Sohail, the fielder, essentially escorts the ball to the fence. Not the best start for Peshawar, especially with their fielding"
"keeps it wicket to wicket on a good length, Shehzad tries a little clip to square leg but has no timing"
"does his bit to get runs by running down the pitch, but he makes that move way too early. Asghar pushes it through quicker and cramps him for room. Thuds into the pads as he flicks around his front pad"
well played. No premeditation. Just waits on the bad ball - and it comes - short and wide and it's smashed to the point boundary
"lovely timing. Again, the shot is made because he waits on the ball to arrive into his half and then brings his wrists into play. Flicks through straight midwicket"
"charges out now, and Asghar slows it right down. Works it to long-on"
little nudge to the left of midwicket to keep strike
looks like the batsman can hit through the line on this pitch. Hasan gives up a back of a length ball outside off and Wright hammers it to point
"good bowling. This seems like the slower ball, pitching on a good length outside off, Wright slogs across the line and the ball sneaks under the bat"
"smashed straight over the bowler's head. Hasan makes the mistake of bowling length to Wright on a pretty decent batting track. A full swing of the arms and it's straight into the crowd over long-on. Taken as well, by the spectator"
"fierce strike again, this time to a short ball. Pummels it to deep square leg."
"pulls off the front foot, for this back of a length delivery outside off doesn't necessarily come onto the bat like the others. Single to deep square leg"
"chops on! Clever change of pace from Hasan and he certainly does enjoy pulling one over Wright. Pitches on a decent length outside off, the batsman thinks he can cut because of the width but hits too hard and plays too early"
"excellent timing again, and Samuels on the third man boundary is put under immense pressure. Shehzad hangs back, opens the face late, concentrates on placement and that's why he gets two runs"
"legcutter, on a length, very wide outside off, Shehzad lets it go, and so does the keeper Kamran Akmal"
works it off his pads towards the square leg boundary.  A touch too straight and the batsman shuffles back and across to pick the gap to the right of the man in the deep
"goes hard at the fuller delivery wide of off stump, but with the ball, this time, not coming onto the bat, Pietersen inside edges to long leg"
"legcutter, full and wide outside off, Shehzad, by opting to slog into the leg side, just gets a toe-end to mid-on"
"does well to pick the change of pace, and even manages to manoeuvre it to the left of midwicket for a quick single"
"full and straight, Pietersen clips it to the right of mid-on for a single"
strides down the pitch and looks to take a good length ball outside off stump into midwicket. Only gets an inside edge to pad and then to point
some turn as he tosses it up outside off. Shehzad opens the face to block to point
"fuller delivery on middle, Shehzad blocks"
"slugs it to deep midwicket, clearing the front leg the moment he sees the flatter ball angling into middle and leg"
"looks for the paddle sweep, it doesn't seem like he has made connection with the bat. Asghar goes for the lbw appeal, but this seems like the impact is outside off. <b>Peshawar go for a review</b>, possibly the first in a T20. Replays suggest KP might even have got glove to it - he showed his bat to the umpire whilst he was running down the pitch - but it is ruled as a leg bye. And not out because Hawk-Eye says ball hits pad outside off. Not the brightest use of DRS."
"the arm ball again, quick and flat on fourth stump. Shehzhad makes the mistake of cutting it and still escapes with a bottom edge past the keeper's right"
"carves it to the point boundary. Any time there is pace on the ball, batting looks easy. Here for example, Shehzad simply holds in his stance and slashes it away"
"back of a length on off stump, dabs it to point for a single"
"ooh, KP gets hit twice and ends up taking an appeal for obstructing the field. It all begins with him getting beaten for pace on middle and leg stump. Shehzad calls his partner through for a single, and in trying to make his ground, KP first runs into Wahab, who is trying to get to the ball, and then takes the throw in the back of the leg. Sammy withdraws the appeal, and it wouldn't have worked away considering KP did not change direction as he runs"
"jumps off his feet to handle a 137 kph delivery, shortish on leg stump. Somehow pats it into the extra cover region for a single"
"fetch that! This has gone <b>out of the stadium</b>, Length ball - pacy length ball - on middle and KP just clears his front leg and monsters it over square leg. Boy, the crack that came off the bat..."
"works it through to midwicket, and Wahab's old nemesis the no-ball has piped up again"
"lack of bounce saves a full delivery in the slot for the slog. Shehzad hangs back, expecting the length to be really full, and swings with all his might but it sneaks under his bat"
"plays outside the line of an arm ball, essentially looking for it to turn. KP gets an inside edge behind square leg. Left-arm spin to KP. Fun"
comes down the track to whip a fuller delivery through midwicket
"looks to heave it over the leg side again, but Asghar does well, firing it full and following the batsman making room to free the arms"
"tosses it wider, slows it up too, Shehzad has to adjust, with his front foot coming down outside leg. He reaches out to hit it to point"
"look out in the crowd! Races down the pitch, turns a length ball into an overpitched one and swings free. Such quick feet. Such fierce power."
"and that's outta here too. Good use of the feet from KP, then he opens up his hips to target the leg side, having realised Asghar is really not intent on spinning the ball away, and rather in cramping the batsman up. Heaves it over square leg. It's <b>KP's 200th T20 six</b>"
"picks the gap between point and short third man. Runs from both ends, and even Peshawar's trump card is being berated"
"over long-on, the big hits just don't stop and this raises <b>the 50 partnership</b> off only 28 balls. This shot is simply a big old wind up, getting under the ball and powering it away. The good thing both batsmen are doing is trying to hit straight (unless of course the ball is skirting down leg, when square leg, midwicket open up and the road outside the stadium are all game)"
"more! And it's been caught in the crowd too. Shimmy down the pitch, sees a length ball, loves that it gives him room to free the arms and flat-bats it so very very hard"
"shifts back in his crease to a slow, length ball on off stump, and whips it through midwicket"
"well bowled. A lot quicker, a bit fuller, and careening into leg stump. KP just about plonks his bat down to save himself"
<b>completes a fifty in the play-off</b> and exults. Brings up the landmark with a neat little clip through to long-on
"back of a length and outside off, cuts to point"
looks for the wide yorker and Shehzad sends it to deep third man
"aims at the toes of KP, who keeps them out of the way and flicks to deep midwicket"
"slower ball robs Shehzad of timing, and this loft, meant to go over mid-off, scythes over cover point."
"low full toss on off stump, drills it to mid-off, where Sammy, the captain, misfields and allows a single."
"one-bounce over backward point. For the slightest moment it seems like Jordan does KP with a full and wide delivery outside off, but he is so tall, and has such reach that he connects and connects well"
"poor start. It's a loosener, a length ball on middle and leg and Shehzad tees off over midwicket."
"goes wide of the crease for a back of a length delivery, Shehzad flat-bats it to long-off"
a length ball trying to sneak past the batsman outside off is clubbed unceremoniously to deep midwicket. No respite
"that's another ball lost. Takes the power position, weight on the front foot, bat waiting high over his head, and when the length ball arrives, it disappears. <b>Out of the ground</b> over midwicket"
"<b>goes past the keeper</b>! Possibly a half-chance. The dive is late, but then again, Shehzad has got a sizeable edge to this yorker outside off."
"some relief for Sammy and his team. He bowls back of a length, but does so without giving too much room for the batsman to work with. Shehzad brute-forces it down the ground, makes contact off the high part of the bat and pops a catch to long-off"
"fires it full on leg stump, KP clears his front leg and smites it to deep square leg"
bisects square leg and midwicket on the boundary. Top shot. The ploy to cramp KP on leg stump is not working. He is simply making his own room and smacking it away
"slower through the air, and outside off, dabs it behind point"
"good shot, it's not often that the ball has been hit this well tonight <i>along</i> the ground. Makes room on leg stump and drives through the line to extra cover"
backs away and cuts to deep point
"misses out considering this is a full toss, giving free reign to swing the arms. KP picks out deep midwicket"
"starts with a slower ball, pushing it across KP. He goes for it, looking for six over long-on, but misses completely because of the change in pace"
"that's high, and it's taken at deep midwicket. Goes bang against a length ball, but this time, he seems to get it off the bottom of the bat. This is a pressure catch, and it's swirling high in the air as well. Asghar steadies himself under it and does the job beautifully, reverse cup, over his head. Wahab got hit out of the ground a few overs ago, now he's sent the batsman who did that off the pitch"
whips a length ball from outside off to deep midwicket
"back of a length and outside off, Sarfraz, the new batsman, taps towards point to rotate strike"
"keeps to a single with a very full ball on middle. Rossouw, backing away, can only bunt it to mid-off"
"shortish on leg stump, nudges it through square leg. Should only have been four off the over, but it's five as Wahab, after chasing the ball down himself, zings an extra as overthrows."
"good length on middle, but Rossouw backs away and hammers it to long-off"
full toss - a high one on off stump - Sarfraz works it past midwicket
"beats him in flight, tossing the ball up on middle and leg. Rossouw, coming down the track, is struck on the pad as he flicks around it. Sarfraz is awake to the run as the ball meanders into the off side"
shimmies down to a good length ball on off stump and nudges it through midwicket
"full toss on leg stump, lifts it to long-off. Should do more with those deliveries"
"length on middle, Sarfraz punches it to long-on. That's a mere six runs off the over. Two good ones from Peshawar"
"superbly done. Goes wide of the crease and slingshots a full delivery on leg stump. Sarfraz, making room, is suddenly stuck and has to defend"
"opens the face and dabs a fuller delivery on leg stump towards cover point. Quick through the air, no room to work with"
"seems like the wrong 'un, and Rossouw might just have picked it, backing away and cutting to cover"
"cramps him on leg stump, and Rossouw, looking to flick, misses. Has to settle for a leg bye"
leaps outside leg - as he often did against Herath right here in <a href='http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/657651.html' target='_blank'>an epic Test</a> - cuts to point
"full, quick, and at leg stump. Sarfraz leaps beside it to try and smack through the covers. No timing whatsoever"
"swings across the line, but the short of a good length ball skews towards cover. Onto him too quickly"
slower ball - places it wide of the batsman's reach outside off - Sarfraz bunts it to long-on
"thunders down the track, making room to leg, but Hasan doesn't give any. Only a single to deep point"
"back of a length slower ball, Sarfraz guides it to deep third man"
"leading edge, just lobs over Sammy running back from mid-off. Goes for a flick and the full ball on leg stump doesn't quite arrive as quickly as he thinks"
"takes a length ball on middle, having moved to leg, and smacks it to the right of mid-off. Sammy dives a touch too early, but is somehow able to recover"
"smears a half-volley to cover, where Afridi stops a stinger. Frustration apparent with Sarfraz kicking the turf"
"full and just outside off, but with Rossouw clearing the front leg, he only just makes contact for a single into the off side just past the cut strip"
"full on middle, punches it to mid-off"
"aims for the blockhole wide outside off, doesn't quite get it. Rossouw carves the ball to the right of deep point"
"whips one to long-on's left, having to take care to clear the front leg against a very full ball on leg stump"
"goes for the blockhole on leg, Sarfraz taps it down to long-on."
hacks it towards deep midwicket
not the pace you'd want a full toss coming at your body - Rossow takes a 145 kph delivery on the thigh as he tries to shovel it through square leg
backs away and launches a full delivery outside off to deep third man
"goes for the slower bouncer, but it's been called a wide for height. Good call from Rossouw to leave it alone outside off"
middle stump cracks open. Rossouw's tortured stay ends as he swings across the line of a simple straight ball and misses altogether
"this is close... this could be stunning.... Sammy, heart on his sleeve Sammy has run back several yards from mid-off, tracking the ball over his shoulder. Reaches out to try and take the catch, but it bobbles off his fingertips and into the boundary. Mistimed hack down the ground gets Anwar off the mark"
"works it to deep mdiwicket, and they go for a second run, good work from Anwar, with a full length dive with the bat face pointing down. He's safe"
"full toss - that's very high - Sarfraz heaves it into the midwicket region. Replays indicate it is well above the waist. Sarfraz is aggrieved. Makes no effort to hide it either, demanding the square leg umpire to call it no-ball"
"low full toss sliding down leg. Anwar, prior to the ball coming at him, has splayed his legs and heaves. No bat, flicks off the top of the pad to long leg"
good bowling. One-ups Sarfraz's intentions to make room outside leg with a wide yorker. The batsman manages to reach out and slash it to the sweeper
"back leg goes outside off, and that's where Jordan aims the ball. Flicks to deep midwicket"
"jumps outside leg, Jordan says thank you very much and bowls a simple length ball, close to the tram lines outside off, and gets away with a dot ball"
"nails the blockhole on off stump, Anwar clips it through midwicket"
"top sails to the boundary behind him. Hasan bowls short, with third man up, and Anwar, going for a pull, is beaten for sheer pace but still profits"
"another edge to the third man boundary. It's full, it';s wide, Anwar tries to belt it over the covers, but he'll be happy for these runs. Should be bowling slower balls to this field"
"nails the yorker outside off, Anwar squeezes it out with a closed face to deep midwicket"
"third man is back now, and a full delivery outside off is steered to the fielder"
"low full toss outside off, carves it to the left of Afridi at cover. This looks to be two, but Anwar seems to be haring back for the third. This is going to be a run-out and it is with a good throw at the right end."
"sweetly done. The inside edge doesn't go past the cut strip, but Sarfraz thinks there is a single. Hasan spots the chance for another run-out, races up to the ball, and then races up to the stumps with it to send the Quetta captain back. Saad Nasim, the new man, didn't like it but should he have crossed and sacrificed his wicket?"
"short of a length on off stump, pulls it to deep square leg"
"full and outside off, drills it to cover"
"goes for a bouncer on middle, but it soars over the batsman's head. Can't do that"
good work. He gets the ball exactly where he wants it - down leg with fine leg up. A swivel pull sends it away to the boundary. Academic
"another one to fine leg. Deflects a short ball outside leg, having drawn it out by moving around in his crease. Poor bowling, and Afridi yells at his bowler for it"
knocks him over. That's all is necessary. And the fuming fast bowler just turns around and walks back - no celebrations despite making a mess of Nasim's stumps. Pin-point yorker that the batsman slogs all around
"shortish on off stump, the batsman pulls, gets a glove to point, and they get 200."
"short of a good length and outside off, Kamran slaps it to cover point"
belts a length ball on off stump to mid-off
"nice control from Anwar, allowing no room outside off, preventing the batsman from getting under it as well. Chops the ball to cover"
"change of pace, and the 115 kph delivery is sliced to point"
and he bowls a bouncer? Kamran bails out of it. Could easily have gone after the ball. Top edge could have flown for four too. But perhaps deep square leg dissuaded him from going after it
"only one off the over, as this ball, full on off stump, is sent to long-on"
"first ball, Zulfiqar you beauty! Does little more than put the ball in the right areas. Here that means on a good length and outside off. Kamran, under pressure by the required rate, goes for a slog and gets a top edge to mid-on"
"goes very wide of the crease for a length ball on leg stump, flicks it through square leg. Zulfiqar has recovered from those <a href='http://www.espncricinfo.com/India/engine/match/1076004.html' target='_blank'>seven wides</a>"
"<b>oopsy</b>, Nawaz digs out a large part of the outfield, while trying to slide on his left knee. Many a career-ending injury has happened in this very manner. Nothing of such drastic proportions here, after a flick towards midwicket"
"quicker delivery on leg stump, defends"
"utter chaos! And it's tied up in a neat little bow as Shehzad, fielding the ball at midwicket, basically jogs up to the keeper's, a smile as wide as any Zulfiqar bowled the other day, and knocks Samuels over. He plays a flick and looks for a run when there was never one there. He'll have to ponder over this dreadful piece of decision making now in the dressing room"
"quicker delivery on leg stump, whips it through square leg"
"superb shot. Comes down the track, but doesn't give the bowler any indication of it. Gets to the pitch of the ball on leg stump and drives it serenely past mid-on"
"fuller delivery on off stump, defends"
"gorgeous shot. This is all very minimalist from Hafeez. Stays beside the full, quick arm ball and by maintaining his balance and composure, he is able to slice it away to the point boundary. So classy"
"drifts it down leg and Hafeez sweeps. No bat, but he does get a little pad to the long leg boundary."
nudges it back down the pitch.
"goes for the sweep again, to a quick arm ball on middle, Hafeez sweeps across the line and weathers a huge lbw shout. Will they review? The option is available. Huge discussion, but they opt against it, worried that it may come as umpire's call on hitting the leg stump"
shortish and outside off - a shade too far reckons the umpire - as Malan cuts and misses
"that's two in a row, this one a bouncer punished for climbing too high over the batsman's head outside off"
"that's the hat-trick. Short, too far outside off, Malan's cut has no chance of making connection"
through cover. There's precious little wrong with this ball - fullish and a shade outside off - but Malan without moving his feet just flays the ball away
slower ball drifts down leg side and it's penalised by the umpire as well. Rightly
"short ball angled into the left-hander, Malan pulls down, and to deep square leg"
defends a back of a length ball on off stump
steers a short delivery off the front foot to cover. Crisp and classical
"excellent placement. The angle of the ball is coming into the right-hander, who makes use of it with a shuffle outside off, and then does all that is needed, a little clip to the left of short fine leg. The fielder chasing the ball tries to stop it with a boot. That's a touch lazy"
"shortish and outside off, dabs it to deep third man"
"fuller ball on off stump, defends to the right of extra cover."
"takes the pace off this back of a length ball outside off and Hafeez, for once, is found wanting for timing tonight. Beaten"
picks up a short ball on off stump and swivel pulls it to long leg
"belts a short ball towards the midwicket boundary, Shehzad the fielder hares after it and puts in a good dive to keep it to just two, Malan looking like he's hitting form. Solid pull shot"
"beautifully bowled. This is a length ball on off stump, all the pace yanked off it, Malan tries to dab it to third man and misses altogether"
"and the slower ball, on leg stump, comes out right on cue. Malan goes for a pull, does not make contact, has to settle for leg byes"
"good footwork to get to the pitch of the ball outside leg stump, heaves it to deep midwicket."
"arm ball, in line with middle stump, asking for lbw. Hafeez does really well to pull his front leg back and block to square leg"
pushes his weight back and flicks a length ball through to deep midwicket
"low full toss on leg stump, works it to midwicket"
"gets down the track, but shapes to do so a touch too early. Zulfiqar shortens his length and therefore allows only a single through cover"
"tosses it up on middle, pushes it back down the ground and it gets tangled up in Hafeez's feet"
"flat and outside off, cuts it past point"
"poor bowling. it's short, it's down leg and it's been dispatched over square leg. All it needed is a simple swing of the bat and Malan gets under it to power it away"
one-bounce to long-off as Malan backs away and slaps a short ball outside off straight to the fielder
"top shot. There's no overhitting in Hafeez's game. It's all timing, and here he helps himself out by coming down the track and hitting it up and over with a straight bat"
shifts his weight back to a flatter delivery on middle and sends it to long-on. That's the fifty partnership off 34 balls
seems to be having problems gripping the ball. This too ends up short and wide and Malan thwacks it straight down the ground. Think he's concentrating a bit too much on bowling it flat and into the pitch
"tries to play a late dab to a really full ball, just outside off, finds backward point"
"quick and full on middle, Malan slogs to deep square leg"
"full toss on off stump, Malan drums it to long-on, power game coming into the fore"
"finally, he slows it down, and Malan is well into his sweep shot. Easily beaten"
"quick, flat, on leg stump, pulls it to deep square leg"
"comes down, making room, and seems to be deceived by the bowler lining it up wider outside off. Hafeez adjusts with his hands and finds a single through cover"
"shortish and outside off, cuts to point"
"they keep putting away the bad balls. This is goind down leg and Hafeez sweeps powerfully past short fine leg. Peshawar still in this, with their power hitters down the order. That's why Hafeez is playing sensible"
"pushes it through on middle, defends"
cuts a ball he should be driving off the front foot and is beaten as a result
smacks a full toss outside off to the sweeper on the off side
"pulverises it through cover. Short and wide, giving him the freedom to hit through the line and imbue as much of his power as he likes. Malan says thank you. One more please?"
"tosses it up over the eyeline, and Hafeez likes this. Gets down on one knee and slog sweeps over midwicket. Vicious"
"does well, having rocked back to pull the ball, to realise it is skidding through low and he has to use a straighter bat. Whips it to the right of long-on"
"low full toss, drives to cover. Hafeez annoyed he didn't get the gap"
"flatter delivery on off stump, pushes it to long-on"
"loops it up outside off, drives to the right of cover"
"tosses it up on middle, works it to long-on"
"starts with a wide again, from around the wicket. This back of a length ball drifts down leg with Hafeez missing his flick"
picks the readymade gap at fine leg with Mills' wayward line down leg. The pace he puts on the ball works to the batsman's favour as he pulls well to the right of the man on the boundary
"fuller delivery outside off, Hafeez goes for a cover drive and gets a thick outside edge to third man"
"slower ball, full on middle, Malan drops and runs to point"
"down leg again, and Zulfiqar on the long leg boundary has been pushed fine and he does well to stop the leg glance from beating him on his right"
"mid-off is up so hitting straight works. Short ball, outside off, skewed over the fielder and into the short boundary"
"change of pace goes utterly wrong. It is short, sliding down leg and Malan pulls it to the long leg boundary. With the fielder up, that was basically a free hit."
"superb way to get to his first fifty of the PSL. Steps down, gets to the pitch of even a flatter ball outside off, and lifts it over long-off. His driving, especially straight, has been a treat"
"so, even a good ball goes. Sees the batsman making room while he charges and pushes it wide of his reach. But Hafeez reaches out, doesn't over hit, and by virtue of that, has timed the pants off the ball over extra cover. Absolute class. That's the hundred partnership"
"shortish and outside off, cuts to point"
"pushes it through on middle and leg, sweeps and misses"
over long-on now. A little room given to free his arms and Hafeez gets under the ball and gives it the requisite air miles to disembark at the Peshawar dressing room
"whips it through midwicket to retain strike. Took on the 18-year old, knowing he wouldn't have faced this kind of pressure, and came away with a 19-run over. Clever batting from the Professor"
"full and outside off, Hafeez gets down low and scythes the ball towards backward point"
"this is just such delightful batting. There is no brute force. Everything is calculated. Everything is that much prettier. This is a low full toss on leg stump, Malan spots the mistake, gets down on one knee and scoops it over his right shoulder, banking on the short fine leg fielder not to catch up with it"
"full and wide, squeezes it out to cover"
"full on off stump, Hafeez works it through to deep midwicket. That's the record for the highest partnership for Peshawar for any wicket - 124 unbroken"
lashes an overpitched delivery outside off to long-off
shifts back to a length ball on off stump and clips it between midwicket and square leg on the boundary. Excellent shot
"picks the gap at extra cover to bring up an excellent fifty. <b>The fastest ever for Peshawar</b>, off only 25 balls. A little width, and Malan hits it where it has the least chance of being stopped. There is only one man there and all he has to do is lift it over his head."
hacks it to deep midwicket
"slog sweep, massive one again. The dew in the outfield is preventing the ball from spinning. Worse, it is making it come onto the bat, so Hafeez can play shots like this, across the line, against the turn"
"dot ball. Very rare. Hafeez actually turns it into one, coming down the pitch and getting too close to the ball. Goes back to Nawaz"
"caught on the cover boundary. This is good bowling. He sees the batsman charging, and so pushes it through quicker and wider. Hafeez has to reach out while hitting the ball over the top. Toe-ends it and is caught very nicely, Nasim sliding to his right."
"drifts it down leg, Malan flicks and misses, but Peshawar do get the wide"
"low full toss on leg stump, clips it to deep midwicket"
"fuller delivery on off stump, drags it to long-on"
"full and straight, flicks it right through KP at midwicket. Dreadful misfield"
he's through with a pull shot by the time the back of a length delivery actually arrives. Toe-end goes towards point
"goes for the bouncer, on off stump, Afridi gets under it. Ooooh, he's fancying taking this deep"
"finds the gap! Not sure how, considering this slower ball is way wide outside off. Sweeps it over square leg - the man was up and that presented the opportunity. Anwar, if anything, bowls the wrong length - good length"
that's just pure power. Full tosses with ample room outside off don't need tender loving care. Blasts it over cover
"oh, that's fantastic deception. This is <i>sooooo</i> slow. It's back of a length, and that triggers the batsman's instinct to pull, an instinct that is never easy to get the best of, which means you often play too early. That's why Mills is such a good bowler - he can repeat this ball when he is in form. Makes the batsman toe-end it right back to him for a simple catch. Malan tries to check his stroke, but he is too late"
"back of a length and outside off, Sohail pokes outside off and is beaten. This is full pace."
"short, at rapid pace, climbs on Sohail as he tries to flick and misses"
digs it in short on middle and off and makes Sohail sway away from its line
"picks the slower, shorter ball, and pulls to deep square leg"
"bashes it over cover again and we have another ball will not be found. <b>On the roof</b>. Mills bowls fast, and into the slot and Afridi swings free. This isn't slogging. This is clean hitting."
"fuller delivery on middle, from around the wicket, flicks it through to the right of deep square leg for a couple"
"through the fielder at cover, that's dreadful and Sarfraz the captain is down on his knees. He tried to hide Zulfiqar, one of the slowest movers, inside the circle and Sohail picks him out with a full toss"
pushes it down to long-on as Sharjah roars 'La-la! La-la! La-la!'
"makes a move outside leg, Nawaz tries to bowl it wide outside off and it goes very wide outside off. Afridi doesn't even bother hitting"
"shortish and outside off, cuts to point"
"good work. He keeps it full, it's straight, Sohail hits right across the line with a slog sweep. The ball is turning into him, but he chooses the wrong one to try and get under. Yorks himself"
lifts a fuller delivery over cover
into the crowd at long-off. Charges down the pitch - what a sickening sight that must be for a bowler - and deposits a good length ball outside off over the boundary and into a clump of his rabid fans
"back of a length and outside off, drills it through to deep cover"
"full on off stump, defends and picks the single to deep cover"
"goes for a bouncer just outside off, Sammy shoulders arms"
"whips it away off his pads to long leg, who suffers a little fumble"
"back of a length, with all the pace drawn off it, Afridi dabs it to long leg"
"shortish and outside off, carves it up and over point"
beats the right-hander with a good length ball that nibbles just enough away off the pitch
"short ball, drags it from outside off with a pull to deep midwicket"
"tonks it again. It's length, and Afridi gets under it to send the ball soaring into the crowd again, this time beyond long-on"
"short ball, outside off, Afridi loads up the pull, but misses"
"this is high, this will need some catching and Nawaz takes a blinder. Change of pace works for Anwar and Quetta. Afridi thinks this is simply a length ball and so swings into the leg side. Ends up mistiming it and the fielder at deep midwicket takes it nervelessly. Would have had his heart thudding somewhere near his throat for at least two minutes - that's how long the ball was in the air"
"short and wide outside off, cut to deep point to retain strike"
"nails the blockhole outside off, Sammy jams his bat down, finds cover. Tiny misfield, but it doesn't cost Quetta"
"short third man goes for the catch, running back, but he is unable to hold on. A big miscue from Sammy, and the outside edge bounces off the right hand of Tymal Mills and onto the boundary"
"tosses it up outside off, Sammy looks to smear it through cover but gets an inside edge to fine leg"
"caught behind. Great take from Sarfraz. This is a flatter delivery outside off, Jordan tries a cut and feathers an edge through to the Quetta captain to keep up the tension"
"he's gone! Quetta are cock a hoop! This is a yorker. Wahab flicks and just about saves himself from being bowled. But then looking all around, he can't see the ball, he thinks he's hit it away somewhere and goes for a run. Except the ball is right there, bouncing into Sarfraz's gloves, and he takes off the stumps with glee"
"Quetta have won it! Nawaz you absolute beauty! With a wet ball, with massive dew around, with great pressure on him, he bowls the yorker, he trusts himself to bowl the yorker. Hasan digs it out and overbalances. He tries to make his crease again, sees Sarfraz pick up the ball, and then bizarrely tries to run. After that, it was basic for the wicketkeeper to topple the stumps"
