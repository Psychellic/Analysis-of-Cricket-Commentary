"short, and this time along the legs, and he whips it away towards long leg. Doesn't quite go all the way, and pulls up in time for Hasan Ali to go across from square leg"

presses forward and smothers a length ball on off

"length ball, starts outside off, and he can play him off the crease with an open face and soft hands"
"a little short, and he gets up on his toes and pushes it off the back foot through covers. <strong>Beautiful stroke, that brings up the 100-run partnership for these two!</strong>"

"length ball, outside off, and he looks to drive it away through covers, but hits it hard into the ground"

"fuller ball, and this time he dismissively flicks it away between midwicket and mid on. <strong>Great shot!</strong>"

"squared up on off stump, squirted out to point"
"<B>fired down the leg side and this could be a stumping!</B> Colin The Big Man goes for a saunter down the pitch, but my goodness, he did extraordinarily well to backflip himself into the crease before the bails came off!"
"<B>gone this time!</B> Dearie me, he had his reprieve, but CdG couldn't resist having another waft down the leg side. The ball bites from a middle stump line, and Asad at leg slip clings onto a sharp chance in his midriff! It was short, to the point, and an improvement on his recent showings, but 20 from 22 balls won't win many Tests"
"eased back down the pitch, some threatening turn now"
"tweaking past the pads, Sarfraz can't gather and is furious with himself"
tucked into the leg side to get off the mark
"<strong>another huge appeal!</strong> and <strong>Pakistan are reviewing</strong>. This looked to the naked eye to have struck outside the line as Watling swept, but there was big turn back into the pads, and a big thump off the gloves before the pads were struck. Nothing doing there."

"sharp tweak from an off-stump line, fended to short leg"
"<B>top-edged sweep, and Southee goes!</B> He seemed unnerved by the amount of turn that Bilal was getting, and looked to take the attack back to the spinner, but that ball got big on him after pitching, and Babar pocketed a simple chance at short fine leg"
"nicely played, right under the eyeline and out to midwicket"
<B>another vociferous appeal!</B> No review this time as Somerville's flat feet are caught on the crease
sliding back into the crease to work to the leg side
more spin on a probing length. Not much for the new boy to play with there

"full, straight, threatening. Squeezed into the covers"
"up on the toes, punched off the back foot to point and he's off the mark in Test cricket"

<B>big turn once again</B>. Leg slip gathers
"raucous appeal, but that looked to come straight off the face of the bat"
"straight off the knee roll as this one grips and pops. Short leg gathers with a squawk, but that's nowhere near bat"
blocked with more confidence this time
"zipping down the leg side, good take from Sarfraz"
"<B>full and straight, thumps the pad, off he goes!</B> Watling tells Somerville to go for the <B>review</B> but if there's no bat there, this looks adjacent. Definitely thuds into the shin first...it was spinning sharply from outside off, and that's surely on off stump. But <B>turning too much!</B> Somerville lives! It's like a Communards revival gig out there..."

"short and wide, a rare freebie, and thumped eagerly out past point"
"another appeal on a full length, nothing doing from Gould, that was missing leg"

"<B>huge appeal!</B> Skids through on a leg-stump line, and this time <B>Sarfraz does review!</B> The key this time was the lack of turn, taking the ball more directly onto pad, but it looks as though there was a<strong> thin inside edge </strong>all the same. Not out!"

nurdled off the hip and Shafig reaches stumps with his side well positioned
"over backward point! What a shot. And what a ball too - short, wide, tame. All it needed was the slightest of effort from the batsman to give it direction and Azhar does so by ramping it away"
"good length, daring across the right-hander, Azhar lets it go"
"138 kph, keeps it tight on off stump, Azhar stays in his crease, standing tall to blunt the ball"
"a hint of movement into the thigh pad, but Azhar is beautifully positioned for it, head over the ball, wrists waiting to roll on top of the ball, waiting until it is right under his eyes and because of that he controls the shot, picking up three through midwicket"
"pitches it up to Shafiq on off stump, he blocks ever so carefully"
"full and outside off, at 135 kph. A teaser if ever there was one. But Shafiq isn't so easily baited"
eases back into his crease - largely because of the slowness of the track and the oldness of the ball - because the length is fairly full and then punches it to the covers
"uses the depth of the crease again, and this time there is just enough room on this shortish ball for Azhar to cut the ball through point"
"a short forward press, then a quick leap back in accordance with the length of the ball on off stump and finally the shot, a dab to cover"
"draws him forward - that's better, slowing it down, tossing it up, giving himself the best chance to beat Shafiq in flight. Doesn't happen on this case"
knocks the toopy delivery on off stump to mid-on
shimmies down the pitch but is then forced to block on middle
"full and outside off, Azhar drives towards mid-off"
neat cricket. He drops the short ball on off stump into the covers and sprints through to the other end. Soft hands. Sharp mind
"an exploratory bouncer, and Shafiq gets under it quite easily. This pitch sucks out all the pace that the ball follows a cartoon-y loop through to Watling"
"good length, outside off, no shot"
inches forward on off stump to block the short of a length ball to cover
"second bouncer of the over, which Watling collects by his ankles, and upon seeing that Boult throws a filthy glace at the surface, as it to say, 'why u do dis?'"
"wants to cut the ball away, but this delivery neither has the room, nor the length to do so. As a result, Azhar just blocks from deep in his crease"
"a mighty sweep from Azhar, the front foot surging forward and that big bat whooshing across the line of a tossed up delivery outside off"
"drifting into the pads, which Azhar deflects past short leg off the front foot"
shimmies down the pitch to nudge the length ball on middle and leg to the left of short leg
"half an appeal for lbw as Patel gets a good length ball to drift on with the angle, beat the inside edge and strike the front pad as Shafiq defends. Would have gone down though"
"<b>some turn</b> but it is also slow turn. Shafiq, having come forward but not to the pitch of the ball on middle, adjusts with his hands"
"goes round the wicket for a shortish delivery on off stump, Azhar pushes it to cover"
"a pristine straight drive! It's just a touch full from Boult and Azhar punishes it by bringing a beautiful, vertical bat down, concentrating only on placement. Beats mid-on to his left and that's enough"
"he's desperately trying to get the ball into the right-hander, the change of angle quite explicitly to try and get Azhar caught in the crease and perhaps lbw. But the batsman's big stride, across his crease as well, is foiling those plans"
big effort from Boult as he hits 141 kph with a bouncer. Azhar sways away from it as it wanders past outside off
"back of a length and angling into the right-hander, Azhar gets squared up a bit as he defends to point"
"he doesn't need a release shot, but there it is anyway, a plump ball on his pads and he deflects it gleefully to long leg"
"<b>oooh</b>, the reverse sweep. A rollicking riposte to Patel's plan to stifle the right-hander by going over the wicket and targeting a line outside leg stump"
rocks back and cuts the short ball on off stump away to the sweeper
"tosses it up outside leg, Azhar pads it away, grumbling inside his mind"
"looks like New Zealand might prey on Azhar's patience, just as he is nearing a century. The line is well outside leg. The ball will be turning away from the right hander. Azhar knows the danger and pads it away again"
"goes for the reverse sweep again, but doesn't connect, as the ball lobs off the pad to leg slip"
"good length, well outside leg stump, Azhar kicks it away like a pair an ugly, frayed boot found in the street"
"<b>turn</b>! A good length ball pitches on off stump and it rips across the right-hander, past his flick shot, and down to Watling"
defends the length ball on off stump
"loops it up outside off, creating some doubt in Shafiq's mind, largely because he knows he can't stretch out to the pitch of the ball. In the end, he reads if off the pitch and blocks"
"<b>beautiful</b>! After doing him with flight the last ball, he does him with a flatter trajectory in this one as Shafiq hurries to bring a straight bat down and protect his stumps without proper foot movement"
"wandering into his pads now, but Shafiq isn't able to dispel the pressure with his flick shot"
"flighted onto off stump, defends it firmly"
"shortish and outside off, dabs it to deep point"
"<b>keeps low</b> but since the line is just a shade outside off, and the pitch so slow and the ball so old, Shafiq has just enough time to bring his bat down"
spears a wide ball to the sweeper. A shade short from Southee but really the width there was the problem
somehow gets the good length ball to come in off the seam but Azhar's defence is impregnable
"now it goes the other way, <b>squaring Azhar up</b>! Southee rolls his fingers on the ball - looking for an offcutter - and yet the (shortish) ball behaves with a mind of its own, drawing the batsman outside off by seam movement away from his bat"
too far outside off to interest Azhar
looms over the tossed up ball outside off and turns it towards midwicket
uses his feet to get down to the pitch of the ball on middle and leg stump and taps it to mid-on
"gets the ball to dip on Azhar, but he's still able to nudge it to mid-on, who is neither deep, nor up saving the single"
turns it to short leg
closes the face to work the angle into him as the tossed up ball goes to midwicket
"launches it over mid-on! Spots the flight of the ball. Charges out to meet it. And since it's a shade outside off as well he can free his hands and lash the ball with all his might. Spectacular batting, especially considering Somerville was in rhythm, getting the ball to drift, dip and turn."
a bit of an outside edge as Azhar drives with the bat scything down from gully towards mid-on. Late (and subtle) movement away from Southee is causing problems
"<b>outside edge and he's into the 90s</b>. Southee keeps rolling his fingers down the seam and this pitch is responding to that ploy brilliantly. Even a set batsman is finding it hard to pin down what to do. In the end, Azhar shuffles across to block and is lucky he plays with soft hands. <b>Also, Azhar now has the most Test match runs in UAE, going past Younis</b>"
"full on off stump, defends"
whips the pitched up delivery on leg stump through midwicket
"gorgeous flick off the pads from Azhar, but there's a man lurking at short midwicket"
"good length, on and around off stump, Shafiq keeps it out"
steps out of his crease to work the flighted delivery on off stump towards the right of mid-on
loops it up outside off - getting a little drift as well - Azhar defends watchfully
"full and outside off, he drives it through point"
"gets a decent nick on the sweep shot, taking it past Watling and away to the fine leg boundary. Poor bowling from Somerville, drifting onto the pads after pitching it short as well"
"good length, on off stump, Shafiq waits on it and taps it to the right of short leg"
spins past the reach of Shafiq as he tries a leg glance that isn't as deft as he hoped it would be
"goes wide of the crease but the ball is too short and too wide to cause any problems. Azhar cuts it to point, and majestically at that. Misfield offers a single"
"full on middle, Shafiq gets the bat in front of pad and rolls his wrists to find midwicket"
"good length, outside off, no shot"
"full on off stump, with a hint of movement in to raise hopes of an lbw. Shafiq throws a <s>spanner</s> bat into the works"
gets a fuller delivery to hold its line on off stump and Shafiq defends it as late as he possibly can. Southee is making the old ball talk.
"wide of the crease again for a full one outside off, Shafiq doesn't want to go anywhere near it"
goes round the wicket for a length ball which is pitched outside leg and spins further away. Azhar leaves. Watling's blinded by the batsman. <b>Hundred partnership up</b>
"length, outside leg, no shot, yawn"
"fires it in quick on leg stump, Azhar makes a little room to slice the ball into the covers. Great batting, even if it is for only one run"
"goes over the wicket for a tossed up ball on middle stump, and it spins away from Shafiq's flick"
"full on middle, works it away towards short midwicket"

makes himself nice and tall on middle stump and blunts the shortish ball by his feet
"looks like he's decided to take on the short ball. At least when it is outside off stump, allowing him a little room to pull. Finds square leg this time though"
"sways out of the line of this boucver though, perhaps wary of the height it gains. Goes past his chest and through to the keeper"
"<b>dropped</b>? Southee has his hands on his head as he watches an outside edge surge past the diving figure of Latham. It's probably too difficult a chance. Too much pace on the ball as it goes past his left. But Southee's creating problems. He's been the only bowler creating problems, moving balls old and new off the seam. In this case, the line is close enough to off stump to lure Shafiq to play and the movement substantial enough to beat the middle of the bat"

"shoves the bat in front of pad as he blunts a quicker, flatter delivery on leg stump"
<b>keeps low</b> as Yasir attempts a late cut and is lucky the ball isn't in line with off stump
"teasing drift away from the bat again, but this time Yasir is able to tackle it better, getting forwrad and flicking the ball past short leg"
"<b>appeal for lbw</b> but this fuller delivery angled sharply into the right-hander does not straighten enough, even though it beats the edge"
"full and outside off, he presses forward to block"
"rocks back, making room to cut the shortish delivery on middle stump through the covers"
"good length ball - at a higher pace than normal - and it is almost enough to get Yasir lbw. The front pad is across, which he wants. But so is the bat, which he doesn't want"
<B>beats him outside off</b> as this delivery is tossed up around the off stump a lot slower. The extra revs he puts on it allow it to dip and turn past the edge
"full on off stump, Yasir only gets the outside half of the bat as he brings the bat across in an angle from gully to mid-on"
"full and outside off, Sarfraz blocks to point"
a hard-handed push but he can't do much more than send this flighted delivery outside off back to the bowler
"<b>keeps low</b> as he goes back to a good length ball and try as he might, he can't push his bat down in time to make contact. New Zealand need these in line with off stump"
shimmies down to flick the full delivery on middle towards midwicket
defends a flighted delivery on middle
"turns this one, on from the base of middle, towards short midwicket"
"makes room outside leg and plays a lovely little late cut. So a ball on middle stump, meant to cramp the right-hander, fetches two valuable runs. Great batting"
"full on off stump, he drives to short cover"
"<B>almost bowls him</b>! This is at a very high pace from Patel - 87 kph - and Sarfraz is shaping to late cut it too, desperate to get as many runs as he can. But this ball is nowhere near short enough and if not for the quickness of his hands, the Pakistan captain would have been gone"
slaps it to the sweeper cover
"tosses it up on middle, he defends"
"good length, outside off, no shot"
"shifts his position way outside leg stump before the bowler releases, then jumps back in line to finally flick the tossed up ball on off stump through midwicket. But that's not the story here. There's a mix-up. Sarfraz wants two. Yasir agrees to it, but as he turns around at the keeper's end, he loses his shoe, and that momentary slip has cost him some pace and eventually his wicket as well. Run out at the non-strikers'"
"good length on middle, Sarfraz nudges it to midwicket"
"loopy delivery outside off, defends it well"
works it to long-on
defends a loopy delivery on middle to short leg
"<B>plays inside the line</b>! This is an offbreak that doesn't really turn. It's also at that length where Hasan isn't sure whether he should go forward or back. He's stuck in the crease. Facing a dangerous ball. He tries to block, at best guessing how much it would turn. He guesses wrong. His off stump pays the price"
"shortish and on off stump, Sarfraz goes back to chop it towards backward point"
"full and outside off, Sarfraz presses forward to defend"
"nice, juicy and loopy on off stump. Sarfraz plays for turn, but there isn't as much and so he gets an inside edge"
he's drawn into playing a tossed up delivery outside off because it dips just before he can reach it and turns relatively sharply. Single through point
"good length, outside off, Shaheen stays in his crease to defend"
gets nicely forward to smother the turn on this well flighted delivery outside off
lunges forward to defend outside off
gets forward to nudge the fuller delivery on leg stump towards midwicket
"tosses it up on off stump, defends"
slings it down the leg side. Watling does well to move across in time to save four byes
"quicker delivery on leg stump, Sarfraz nudges it to square leg, looking for a single, but the field is up now."
"<b>taken at short midwicket</b>. A little extra bounce from the tall offspinner does the trick as Sarfraz, thinking the good length ball is there for a flick through midwicket, is suckered into giving a catch to Jeet Raval. Four wickets for the debutant Somerville and New Zealand limit Pakistan's lead to a mere 74. Guess what their lead was in the first Test of this series, which was in Abu Dhabi as well, which New Zealand won? Yep. 74."
"good length ball darting across the left-hander, he leaves"
"full and outside off, eases it to the left of cover"
"good length, outside off, no shot"
"back of a length and outside off, Raval lets it go again"
"goes short and at the body, Raval does well to stay in line with it and tap it down by his feet"
"back of a length and outside off, he allows it to carry through to the keeper"
works the fuller delivery on middle through midwicket
"pitches it right up there, a shade outside off, Raval digs it out of the blockhole to mid-off"
good length and outside off. Fosters no interest from the left-hander
"<b>so close to off stump</b>! Raval decides to leave the ball, considering it pitched a feet or so outside the off stump. But then it hurtles in off the seam so sharply that he could well have been bowled"
"back of a length on off stump, Raval knocks it down"
"fullish on off stump, blocks"
"back of a length and outside off, no interest from Latham"
"are they wasting the new ball? This angle going across the left-hander, but more so the lengths - the consistently shortish lengths - is allowing both Latham and Raval to let balls go"
"goes round the wicket - immediate and excellent change from Hasan - and it nearly gets the wicket too. Cutting Latham in half as he tries to defend from the crease. The ball zips in off the pitch, sneaking between inside edge and the off stump"
"a touch fuller and outside off, asking for the on-the-up drive. Latham is wise enough not to fall into the trap"
"<B>lbw appeal</b>  but Hasan immediately says there's an inside edge. Skillful bowling again, hitting the deck and getting the ball to cut back into the left-hander, at pace. Latham tries to block off the back foot but is just a little slow with his movements"
"another lbw appeal, but there's an inside edge this time as well, Latham coming reluctantly forward to greet the fuller delivery angled into him."
"good length on middle, Raval blocks"
"back of a length and outside off, Raval defends it quite well"
"<b>huge appeal for lbw as Raval leaves the ball</b>. Umpire Gould shakes his head, judging that the ball hasn't nipped back enough. It was high as well. But still, Raval is certainly being troubled by the inward movement"
"<b>given lbw this time</b> but Raval has reviewed this. Splendid delivery to put him in all sorts of problems. It's full. It cuts in sharply. It has Raval both trapped in his crease and late in bringing his bat down. UltraEdge comes up but 'I can't tell for certain if there's contact with bat,' says third umpire Oxenford. It really is that close. Even with split-screens and super slow mo. So he trusts the on-field call from Ian Gould and goes to ball-tacking, which says umpire's call on impact and umpire's call on hitting the stumps. Which, btw, is out"
"full and on off stump, Williamosn defends in his inimitably calm fashion"
"<b>outside edge flies past second slip</b>! A startling shot from Williamson - very loose outside the off stump, knowing full well Pakistan have two slips and a gully waiting. Goes for the cut, gets a bottom edge, I think, and luckily for him, it evades Shafiq, diving to his right"
"good length on off stump, defends"
"full and outside off, he drives to cover"
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
"bouncer, angled into the left-hander from round the wicket, Latham lets it go"
"good length on off stump, defends"
"good length and outside off, defends firmly"
"back of a length and outside off, Williamson shoulders arms"
"<b>lovely bowling</b>. It's fullish. It's tempting the drive. It's also angled across the right-hander, bringing the slips into play. Williamson, however, puts them off with a leave"
hammers it past the right of point. That's his trademark. Shifting his weight back. Standing tall in his crease. Bringing down the vertical bat. Angling the face just enough to pick the gap. Gorgeous.
"that's deftly done. The ball is hunting Latham. It's full. It's looking for his front pad. It wants to take him out lbw. But he has other plans, staying still at the crease, bringing down a largely straight bat, and only at the very last moment does he flick it to beat mid-on to his left"
"back of a length on off stump, defends with soft hands"
"shortish on off stump, Williamson knocks it down well"
flicks a fuller delivery on leg stump through midwicket
back of a length on off stump. It might have kept low as well. Williamson plonks the bat down on it though
"fuller delivery outside off, drives to cover"
gets in line with a shortish delivery on off stump
"manages to make contact with a shortish delivery outside off that keeps a little lower than he expects. Batting is simply not going to be easy anymore. Certainly not with Pakistan planning to bowl short, at the stumps, and hoping for stuff to keep low"
works a back of a length delivery on leg stump away to long leg
"fuller on the pads, defended from the front foot"

"<strong>outside edge</strong>, as he was shaping to play it towards midwicket. The ball squirts away along the ground towards point"
"length ball, angles across him, starting from off and moving away, and Somerville has a tentative poke at it. No footwork, and fortunate he got nowhere close to it"
"length ball, angles across him again, and this time he makes contact with a drive. Very little foot movement again, so encouraging (and smart) from young Afridi"
"<strong>a beauty!</strong> Bowled at 138 clicks, angles across from a length, and beats the outside edge as he looks to defend from the crease"

Yasir Shah picks his 200th Test wicket in just his 33rd Test, three Tests faster than the incumbent on that record, Clarrie Grimmett, another leg-spinner incidentally. It was a length ball, and he had been bowling the quicker ball consistently, and that's why it was a dangerous ploy to keep going back to defend. Somerville pays the price this time around."

"<strong>short, and he has taken the bait this time! What a good ball from Afridi, and Taylor's positivity is to no avail in the end.</strong> Was dug in outside off, and he went for the hook, and only found Bilal Asif down by the square leg fence, about 15 yards in from the fence. Easy catch, and good execution of a plan from Pakistan. New Zealand needed more from Ross Taylor here, it must be said"
