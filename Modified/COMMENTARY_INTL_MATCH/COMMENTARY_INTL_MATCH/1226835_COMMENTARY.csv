He skies this over deep square leg. Gregory ranges to his right along the rope with it swirling away and dives to his right at the last moment, holding on after his elbows thud into the turf on the landing. Often times the ball will pop out once the body hits the turf there but Gregory clasped on firmly."

"slower ball short on the stumps, through the pull shot way too early."
"another relay catch on the rope at deep midwicket but it looked like six live as Bryant seemed to clearly step beyond the rope before he flinged the ball back into play. Length ball heaved high and deep to the leg side. Bryant caught it as he was falling over the rope before backhand flicking to Bazley who was just five yards away. On the replays it's much closer. I think benefit of the doubt should go to the batsman. Seems that the last freeze frame shows his foot contacting the ground with the ball still in his hand. The TV comms are convinced the ball was out of his hand but I disagree, not that it matters at this stage.... third umpire has given it not out. Correct decision for me. ESPNcricinfo 1, TV 0!"

"length ball on fourth stump, shovels this flat to mid-off, catch taken on his knees on the ring by Wildermuth. They're going to the third umpire for this, to decide the difference in one run to a win. The ball was bursting through his fingertips and may have been trapped. Not going to change the result either way. The umpire says it touched the turf so Gotch ends not out."
