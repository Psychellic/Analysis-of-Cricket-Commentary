"rush of blood and the man who made two centuries in the ODI series is out first ball. Steps out to slap this over cover, Nurse cleverly shortened his length and beat him with one that was pushed through. Smart stumping by Ramdin."
"superb stroke! Picks length early, rocks back and cuts this very delicately to beat backward point."
pulled all along the carpet to deep midwicket
"the slider has done in Soumya. What a beauty! This one drifts in, the length is a touch fuller and he makes the cardinal sin of playing back. Big, big mistake. The ball skids through to beat the edge and crash into the stumps."
driven through to mid-off.
turns this quicker length ball back to the bowler.
<b> put down by Samuels at cover. </b> A sitter at that. Length ball that Shakib slaps straight into his hands. This one burst through. Reprieve for the skipper.
length ball that squares him up a touch but he manages to stay back and defend.
"stifled lbw appeal as he plays all around a full delivery, slipping down leg though."
"backs away looking to slap this over midwicket, beaten for pace."
"beaten on the drive. Once again, the pace does him in. Went for an expansive drive with minimal feet movement."
"snorter of a bouncer towards his armpits, somehow manages to fend this into the leg side."
"slider on middle, defended back"
"steps out again, beaten in flight, dabs to point"
"swept uppishly to beat the man at deep square. One bounce into the fence. Risky, sweeping off the stumps. Lost his balance but managed to get enough wood"
too short and punished! Stays inside the crease and wallops this through point
"punches this to mid-off, refuses the single."
swung across the line to long-on
"slower and fuller outside off, squeezed behind point"
"the short-arm jab over midwicket, Carlos retrieves it"
gets on top of the bounce and slashes this over point. Too short and he was ready for it.
right into the blockhole. Late on this attempted squeeze behind point. Beaten
"helped along to beat short fine. Too short and down leg, all Shakib had to do was swivel and get some bat on it, which he did."
once again beautifully done. Both toes off the ground as he uses the width to slap this up and over point
"slider on middle and leg, punched to long-on"
"too full and he's drilled this through extra cover. Right into his hitting arc, Shakib is counter-attacking in style here"
punches this straight to cover
bunts this into the cover region as they scamper a single to Kesrick Williams
"just a gentle little chip and this nearly races to the fence. Excellent work in the deep by Rovman Powell, who hares around from long-off and gets to where the straight boundary is. Saved two runs"
works this full toss towards wide long-on
"short of length and he's whipped this uppishly towards deep midwicket. Brilliant from Fletcher, who runs around from deep square and puts his right hand out to stop this, even as the momentum took him back towards the ropes."
"pure pace and the short ball has done the trick. Liton looks to pull, gets this high on the bat. It didn't help that he was hitting into the wind either and Fletcher, lurking around the corner at deep square, didn't make a mistake."
"has this been taken? Looks like it has. Kesrick Williams, you beauty. Tremendous control, presence of mind and skill to take this outstanding catch at third man. Shakib gets on top of the bounce and slashes this up and over. For most parts, this seems to be heading all the way. Kesrick times his jump well with the momentum taking him back, but he manages to get both hands on the ball. Takes the catch but quickly realises he'd be going over, so tosses it back into the field of play and takes it just as he comes back in. Shakib is shell shocked, he can't believe what he's just seen. What awareness. Bangladesh are unravelling. Another short ball, another wicket."

turns this full delivery to long-on
"full on middle and leg, tucked wide of square leg"
"gentle push into the off side, behind point for a single"
cut away and very nicely at that. Splits the gap between point and short third man
"drills this straight back past, no chance for long-on. Badree pays the price for being too full."
"swung across the line, clears the ropes effortlessly. Once again this was right into his swinging arc. 'So what if we've lost wickets?' Mahmudullah seems to be asking. Clobbered that magnificently over long-on."
"slants a length ball down leg, zips past the thigh pad as he looks to tickle fine. Wide called and rightly so"
"steps out and slaps this length ball to mid-off, excellent work by the skipper Carlos Brathwaite. Moved low to his left to stop this rocket hit"
"slower bouncer on middle, he hops back into the crease and fends."
"slower delivery gone wrong, slips this way down leg."
hangs back and dabs this gently to third man
short ball that zips back in to nearly rap him on the glove as he deflects to third man. Bottom hand came off the grip. <strong>Hustled for pace</strong>
"sways out of the way of this short ball, far too wide outside off."
"eased to point, looks for a single, sent back."
"stunning stroke! Made room and then whacked this length ball through the line to clear long-off. You need to be special to play strokes like that. No wild swinging, but pure, pure timing. Right out of the top drawer from Mahmudullah. Excellent game awareness and the ability to pick lengths."
works this full delivery down to long-on
"has he got some bat on it? No, five wides. Very, very poor. Too short as he slipped this down leg."
glides this length delivery to third man for an easy single
backs away and drills this through extra cover
"Looks to back away and slap this through point, beaten"
"Charges to slap this slower length ball over mid-off, but couldn't reach out"
very cheeky. Walked across the stumps to get inside the line of this delivery and then ramp this over the keeper's head. Lovely
gentle little dab into the off side as they take another single.
"delicate, and very very effective. Short and angling in, he makes room and then arches back a little to pick his spot and ramp this to the third man boundary. Superb"
"this time he's holed out to third man. Clever captaincy, Rovman Powell was moved a lot finer from square third man. But then you still have to execute the bowling plans well to get there. He bowled this short and into the body again to cramp Mushfiqur for room, so much that despite arching back he couldn't get the width he would've liked. Ended up ramping this straight to the fielder."
"refer that, refer that! This is very close. He walks across to flick but misses. Hit him on the thigh pad. This may have been crashing into the stumps. It's a belated appeal from Carlos and the bowler. Not sure why the umpire didn't seem too convinced. Okay, there's no bat involved. Ball tracking shows this would've just missed leg stump. Pardon my early excitement, looked a lot closer than it turned out to be. As it turns out, good decision from Gregory Brathwaite. Make no mistake though, this was very risky. <b> West Indies lose their review. </b>"
"off the pad and beats the keeper to the fine leg boundary. Too short and too straight, beaten for pace but doesn't matter."

"slash and a miss. Looked to hit this too hard, cramped for room."

"superb stop at point, saved at least three runs for the side did <strong>Ewin Lewis.</strong> Threw himself to his left"

"leans into the drive, gets this towards sweeper cover"
reaches out to go over cover but misses. Flirting with the wide line though.
the short ball which he looks to nudge into the leg side but misses.
turns this length ball on middle and leg towards deep midwicket
uses the pace to steer this length ball straight to point.
"first an appeal for lbw, but as it turns out, the batsman has been bowled. Mahmudullah could  have been run out too, you know? This nipped back in to beat the inside edge and deflect off the pad to the keeper. Along the way, it clipped the bail too. The batsman wandered outside the crease as they decided to take the run, only to see the keeper under-arm throw the ball directly at the striker's end. Long way out of his crease. Mahmudullah has survived the run out only because the ball clipped the bail."
"drives, gets a thick inside edge to short midwicket"
lovely wrist work as he whips this full toss into the gap at midwicket. Lovely timing.
"Russell is down on his followthrough as he delivers a short ball, the batsman sways out of the way."

heaved across the line to deep midwicket
"bunted into the leg side, called for two but Fletcher is superb as he hares in to stop the second"
backed away to go over cover but the bowler slipped in a yorker that he managed to squeeze back.
"the dipping yorker has done the trick. Kesrick has taken off on a lap of honour, followed by a dance jig. Mahmudullah completely foxed as he advances. Didn't see this coming, did he? Totally deceived by the change in pace as he looks to heave across the line. Missed it completely as the ball honed back in to beat his swing and crash into the stumps."
beaten by a length ball that slants across.

beaten on this slower offcutter which he looked to chip over cover.
beaten by a skiddy short of length ball which he looks to arch over to third man.
swing and a miss. Through with the heave even before this slower ball arrived.
crisp drive but a superb stop at point. Unnecessary throw at the bowler's end to give away one for the overthrow. <strong>Ewin Lewis the fielder</strong>
appeal for lbw but this was slipping down. Excellent from Keemo. Right into the blockhole as he looked to whip over midwicket
eased down to long-on for an easy single.
"holes out to long-on. The slower ball meant he had to force the pace on this heave from outside off, not enough muscle into the stroke. Easy catch."
"slants across, he reaches out to squeeze behind point but misses."
"edged, races to the third man boundary. Squared up by the length as he wafted at this. Slip would've gobbled that up"
"makes room, Kesrick cleverly bangs it in short to cramp him for room. He still tries to deflect this past the keeper but can only glove this through to Ramdin. Fourth for Kesrick and boy, hasn't he deserved his wickets"
"floated full, squeezed to point"
works this behind square into the leg side to get off the mark.
"slower and fuller on middle, worked to deep midwicket"

"backs away, holds his shape and slaps this length ball to sweeper cover."
"pulls and misses. Ugly, ungainly heave even before the ball arrived."

"floated up outside off, slapped through point"
"flat, back of a length on middle, punched back"
"pitched up and sliding on leg, drilled off the inside of the bat to deep square leg"
lofted over cow corner. Backs away to give himself space to free the arms and carts it with the inwards angle

advances down the ground and swings and misses as the ball drifts out of his reach
"walks across and cramps himself up, failing to make a feeble attempt at a glide connect"
"has he nicked off here? Oh yes, he has.. good tight angles from Mustafizur. Sticks to that corridor outside off, this one's short of a length and forces the batsman to have a waft at it, and he nicks through to the keeper"

"back of a length, tucked off the pads through square leg"
"pitched up on middle, drilled back off the inside of the bat"

off the toes and over deep midwicket. Slides a fuller one into the pads and he clips it powerfully with ample bottom-hand power
floats up a full toss that's slapped to deep point
gets down for a big slog and misses as the ball rolls off the pad into the off side. Samuels takes off for a run and Russell is late to spot it and acknowledge.. and a direct hit at the non-striker's end could've had him in trouble
""
"back of a length, sliding into him, uses the angle to muscle a pull over deep midwicket"
"gets down to sweep and fails to make contact. Gets hit on the pad and Shakib belts out an appeal that's withheld. He chooses to review it. Tell you what, this could be very close if he hasn't got an inside edge. Might it just be a glove? Nope, nothing.. but, ah, wickets is umpire's call. With that angle, it would've just clipped the leg stump. Review retained, though"
"straight on leg, gets an inside edge through square leg"

"short of a length, whipped off the backfoot to long-on"

"short of good length outside off, chops a punch into the surface"

"length ball outside off, giving him too much room, and he responds with a slog over deep midwicket"
"extremely full outside off, squeezes out an inside edge towards short fine"
"another length ball, this length isn't doing anything to hurt the batsman, because it's not like there's a whole lot of fizz, grip and turn on this surface. Tonked straight over for another massive six"
"succeeds for one delivery. Length outside off, nips in late to beat him as he reaches out for a late cut"
"good wide delivery, toeing the line but inside it to have him swinging and missing"
"slower length ball outside off, again zero foot movement as he swings and misses wildly"

"slower full one, another wild swing and a miss. An over full of it. Four required"
"well, they only know one way to play, and they'll do it their way. There's that big hit to seal things. Another tossed up delivery slogged from outside off wide of long-on"
