It seemed like a simple catch for Duminy but he ended up grassing it, the ball popping out of his hands and rolling in front. But a fine recovery by the captain, who ran forward to collect the ball, dived in front and flicked it to the stumps to run the batsman out while he was attempting a second run off the dropped catch.

"thick edge goes for four through the slip area. there is no catcher there, he moved away and slashed it hard, gets a thick edge that runs away fine"
"<b>caught by Markram at the long-on boundary</b> he leathered that, but didn't get height on it. Down the track and cross-batted swat. Flew hard and straight, Markram didn't have to move. Oh wait a minute, wait a minute. <b>Duminy has over-stepped!</b> So that's a no-ball. And a free hit coming up!"
"<b>free hit disappears over long-on</b> that's a poor ball to bowl, never mind when it's a free hit. Wide outside off, too short. Udana can free his arms and smash it across the line sending it way over long-on"
"full toss on the pads and he wanted to swipe it too hard, ends up edging onto pad and then to short fine leg. He's not happy with himself. That should have been another boundary"
"sloppy by South Africa. This was pushed to point who had a needless shy at the stumps. There was no run there, but an overthrow conceded to keep Udana on strike"
"wide outside off, but within the tram lines. He wants to swing at it, but doesn't connect. Kept it out of the batsman's reach but just within the line"
"misses his line that time, went for the wide one outside off again, but couldn't target the tramline. That meant Udana could free his arms and smash it through cover"
"moves across and gets this past short third man with a hoick. It was a thick inside edge but he had picked his spot and his shot - he knew Sipamla was going wide of off, so he countered that"
"<b>that's leathered</b> And he's brought up his <b>fifty</b> too, his first in T20Is. What a way to bring it up. That ball made a pinging sound when it left his bat. Full on the stumps, he moved his front leg out of the way and swung for the heavens, connected in a heavenly manner too, sending it way over the ropes at deep square leg"
"good comeback, quicker short ball outside off and Udana's ploy of moving away and hacking at the ball doesn't work with the quicker one, he doesn't connect"
"<b>he's broken his bat</b> whew, Udana is whacking them so hard, the end of his bat has broken off! He's looking pretty unhappy about it. That was back of a length on the stumps, he backed away again and got it off the toe-end, it went up in the air, but landed safely behind mid-off. But the bat's going to have to be changed, though Udana has ensured he's still on strike"
"<b>whoa, reverse sweep for four</b> angled across him, and he spots it early. Premeditated the reverse and connected well to send it to the square leg fence"
"fuller but in the same reverse-sweeping slot. He goes for it again, but misses this time."
"moves way across the line and paddles it in the air to square leg. Duminy runs after it from fine leg but can't get there, collects on the bounce"
"<b>dragged it on</b> Shamsi had tossed this up well outside off and Akila unwisely attempts to go for glory himself, with a big booming drive. Ends up getting an inside edge onto the stumps. Would have been better off looking to push or nudge it for a single to get Udana back on strike"
"given some air on leg stump, he defends off the front foot with his pad in front of his bat"
"that's completely through him. tossed up outside off, and spinning back in, takes a feather of Malinga's bat when he goes to prod at it, and misses stumps by a whisker to run to fine leg"
"yorker length on middle stump, driven by going back and clearing his front leg, but straight to cover"
"<b>you miss, I hit</b> Morris misses the yorker by a few centimetres, and it's enough for Udana. Again clearing his front leg and striking it from middle and off to crash it through extra cover"
"he responds with a pacy bouncer, but it's gone too high and it'll be a wide. Bounced over his head"
<b>bang</b> this is sublime striking. Morris goes full again and Udana opts to go straight back over his head. ANd hits with such power and timing that it crashes into the sight screen without even a full follow through. Amazing
"driven powerfully again, but not as straight and long-on collects on the bounce"
"<b>he's slashed that past point</b> he backed away and just threw his bat at it, gets a thick edge that runs between point and short third man for four"
"<b>you miss I hit</b> it's Morris's turn to say, though to Malinga. Full fast and straight, Malinga was backing away, doesn't connect. The ball finds timbre."
"<b>six first ball!</b> full on a fifth stump line, he gets down on one knee and swings through the line. Sends it over long-off! Game on, game very much still on"
"oh that's done it. Full on off, and driven powerfully, but straight to cover. Sri Lanka need a no-ball six now to win"
"dragged this to deep square leg from well outside off, and there is confusion in the running between the wickets, and sloppiness in trying to run the batsmen out. The throw came to the bowler's end with the batsman well out of his crease having hesitated for the second, but Sipamala made a mess of collecting it. He hares after it and throws it to the keeper, but Udana dives to make his crease"
"caught on the bounce at deep midwicket. Reeza Hendricks dives forward, but says it dropped short, and it did."
"and he's going out in style. Sri Lanka may not be winning this, but Udana is making some statement. Short ball outside off and he pulls it from outside off to beyond the square leg boundary. Got it not exactly off the meat of the bat, but hit so powerfully that it travels over the fence just the same"
"anti-climatic end perhaps, with a full ball swiped to long-on for a single. Udana ends on an incredible 84* off 48, easily the innings of the day. He should be Man of the Match if nothing else. What devastating hitting. But Sri Lanka lose by 16 runs and South Africa have thus won the T20I series, taking a 2-0 lead"
