They're all appealing for the caught behind, but the umpire doesn't think it's come off the glove. Sanga's lost the ball, so they're taking a quick run as well. The Multan team cannot believe it. Replays are inconclusive. Guess the umpire thought it came off the arm. Good to see Shoaib Malik smiling at the end of it all. Another angle, however, suggests that it came off the elbow, perhaps. Excellent from the umpire in that case."

"two in two, and Samit does a Tahir as he takes off on a celebratory run. Saif Badar is out plumb in front. He had a chat with Shehzad regarding a review, but they do the right thing in the end. Absolutely plumb! This drifted in from around the stumps and skidded through, Badar looks to work this towards midwicket, misses it altogether. Aleem Dar had no doubts whatsoever."

Wanted to back away and go over cover but couldn't get any timing behind that. The bat face turned and he ended up spooning the simplest of catches. Not the kind of strokes or shot selection you expect from a player of Shehzad's ability. Time and again, he's been a disappointment this season. Multan slide further."
