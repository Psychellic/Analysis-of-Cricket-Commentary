"ooh, great start from Amir. Tentative from Rohit. Was just propping forward and pushing at the ball on a fifth-stump line, outside off. May have played for the swing - it just went on with the angle and beat his outside edge"
"phew, another beauty. This one's even better. This one starts closer to off stump, forces Rohit to play on this occasion, and again, no swing, but lots of bounce, beats the edge with the angle"
"length ball, pitches wider outside off, easily left alone"
"and again - he's beaten Rohit three times in four balls now. He's yet to put bat on ball. This one's slanted wide again, a bit fuller, inviting the drive. It isn't quite on a driving length, though, and again the  ball misses his outside edge"
"back of a length, slanting across towards off stump. Plays slightly outside the line of this one in defence, thick inside edge cannons into thigh pad"
"length ball, pitching on off and angling away, left alone"
"slants this across, back of a length, no turn back in. Waits on the back foot and dabs it to the left of backward point, who muffs up a fairly straightforward diving stop"
fired in fuller and he ends up bowling it down the leg side as Dhawan misses the sweep
"flat and full on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"

"fullish on off stump, defended back down the pitch, towards the non-striker"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended into the covers"

"back of a length outside off, whipped away to long-on"
"length ball on middle stump, flicked to midwicket"
"back of a length on leg stump, goes deep in his crease to work it through backward square leg"

"full, drifting into middle stump, pushed gently into the covers and they take on the quick single. Make it easily despite a direct hit at the bowler's end"
"back of a length on middle stump, looks to tuck it into the midwicket region, but the angle ensures he plays it too close to the bowler's follow-through to get a single"
"bouncer now, well-directed, rises over Rohit's right shoulder. Takes on the hook - he knows fine leg is inside the circle - and it hits the outside half of the bat but almost carries all the way to the rope"
"back of a length on middle and leg, tucked into the square leg region"
"ooh, good ball, a bit of late swing in. Full, angling into off stump. Looks to stay leg-side of the ball and drive through cover, gets a thick inside edge instead, to long leg"
"length ball, slanted a bit wider outside off, left alone"
"back of a length outside off, takes a half step forward and across to punch towards point"
"fullish, swinging across towards off stump, clipped to midwicket"

"a touch short now, on off stump, and Rohit rocks back and punches it to the left of the cover point fielder"
"down the track, Imad shortens his length outside off, waits and stabs to backward point"
"back of a length, not too much room outside off as Dhawan steps back to cut. Ends up dragging it straighter than he wants, into the covers"
"shortish, slanting across towards off stump, and Rohit flirts with danger here. Two slips in place and he looks to run it down to third man with an open face. Hits the outside half of the bat and just eludes the fingertips of Azhar diving right from second slip"

"back of a length on off stump, uses his wrists to play that cautiously down to midwicket"

down the track and Imad fires it at Dhawan's pads. Clipped to deep square leg
"full on middle and leg, almost a yorker, shows the full face to push towards long-on"
"back of a length on off stump, and that's nicely done. He knows there won't be too much turn, so he makes himself room, watches the ball all the way, and forces a cut to the left of the diving backward point fielder. Gets a hand on it, may have gone for four otherwise"
"back of a length on off stump, punched to mid-off. Takes off immediately, Rohit is slow to respond, and they make it comfortably in the end. Rohit slyly runs in the way of the throw - and gets hit on the back. Not sure if it's strictly okay to do"
"full on middle stump, pushed to mid-off"
"fullish outside off, driven to cover point"
"back of a length on off stump, stays leg-side of the ball and knocks it towards point"
"back of a length on middle stump, defended to short extra-cover. Pakistan have done well to deny Dhawan width"
"full on middle and leg, clipped to the right of long leg"
"back of a length, close to off stump. He doesn't need too much width, though. Just waits on the back foot, and times a defensive push so exquisitely that backward point, diving right, has no chance of stopping the ball"
"short outside off, and Rohit rocks back to pull, doesn't connect, though. Skidded through quicker, and maybe didn't bounce as much as he expected"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"bang. A bit of air from Imad, floated it up towards off stump, and Dhawan immediately stretches forward and hammers a sweep up and over square midwicket"
"back of a length on leg stump, opens up and whips towards deep midwicket - who's just been pushed back. And Pakistan concede an overthrow as well. Fielder comes in, throws inaccurately to Sarfraz, and the ball runs away into the fine leg region. Not sure who the fielder was. To be fair to him, Sarfraz wasn't really watching the ball too closely either."
"ooh, a little lazy from Rohit. Length ball angling towards off stump. Plays for the turn, not really getting forward, and the ball slides on and hits high on the inside edge"
"down the track now and Imad pulls his length back while angling it into Rohit's pads. Looks to hit over mid-on, ends up dragging it wide, through midwicket"

"full and angling away just outside off, patted into the covers"
in-between length. Neither full nor short - attacking the stumps - Dhawan hurriedly blocks it to the off side
"really full and attached with width outside off, Dhawan doesn't need second invitations. He throws his hands at it and carves it away to the left of sweeper"
"very full and angled in, aiming for off stump, Rohit's push to mid-on intervenes. Hasan's front foot has strayed. Big no-ball"
"Rohit tunes up for a big hit. Goes over the top. Hasan attempts a yorker, ends up bowling an off-stump full-toss. Rohit does not get hold of it but still clears mid-on. Cashes in on the free-hit. Rohit and Dhawan are back at it with a fifty opening stand"
"good length and zipping through the channel outside off, no shot offered"
"short of a length and outside off, Rohit goes a bit hard on the cut and ends up chopping the ball to cover"
"full, non-turner on off, driven down to long-on for a single"

"Dhawan shimmies down the track, Hasan drags his length back on middle, Dhawan quietly pushes it to cover"
"length and angling across off, Dhawan opens the face and steers it to the right of a diving Shadab at backward point. The fielder was wrong-footed, as the ball evaded his fingertips"
"possibly a slower ball on the leg stump, Dhawan does not spot the change-up. Flicks early, the ball deflects to midwicket off the pad"
"follows the slower ball to the left-hander, with a big bouncer outside off. Bangs it into the middle of the deck, sails over the gloves of the batsman. Rohit did well to drop his hands on it"
"short and angled in on leg stump, Rohit uses the angle and manipulates a single to the right of the leg umpire"
tests Dhawan with a lifter now. This one angles away from the left-hander. Dhawan bails out of the hook and lets it through to Sarfraz
"slings a very full ball wide outside off, Rohit is happy to shoulder arms"
"short of a length and outside off, hits the bat hard, defended to cover"

Rohit flashes at another wide one with his hands. This one he connects but can't beat the off-side sweeper

"123ks slower ball on off, Dhawan reads the drop in pace, waits for the ball to arrive, then turns it to square leg for one"

"shortish on the hips, worked away through backward square leg for one"
"full and angled in, but the line is too straight, flicked with the wrists to deep backward square leg. Rohit is eager for the second, but Dhawan sends him back. Rohit slips, but still has enough time to reach safety. The throw was well in front of the stumps"
"shot! Pitched up and outside off, Rohit simply hits through the line hits crisply. Drives over extra cover"
"short of a length and outside off, run down to third man. Hasan isn't fine enough in the deep. He runs across to his left, and slides at the edge of the boundary to keep it to one"
"wrong line, full and slung down leg. Re-set the radar, Wahab"
"dug short and wide outside off, Wahab overcorrects it, Dhawan cuts it uppishly over backward point and finds a boundary. Thirteen runs off the over"

"full on off, pushed back to the bowler"
"Crunched over midwicket.<strong> Fine way to bring up a fifty</strong>. Welcome back to international cricket, Rohit. This was a bad ball, though. Half-tracker outside off, Rohit rocks back and pulls over midwicket"
"better length. Pitched up on off, no room, defended back"
"short on middle, cramps Dhawan for room, chopped straight to point"
"short outside off, Dhawan uses the pace of Wahab and cuts it uppishly, fine of deep third man"
"another tripe ball from Wahab. Leg-stump half-volley, glanced away fine on the leg side for back-to-back fours"
"Wahab hits the deck hard but this is again a bad ball. Short and wide outside off, Dhawan loves width. He jumps off his feet and cuts uppishly again. Hit over backward point. One-bounce four. Wahab continues to leak runs"
"<strong>Fifty for Dhawan as well</strong>! Slower ball outside off, opens the face and taps it to the left of backward point. Shadab fumbles, letting the ball through his fingers"

"slower length ball close to off stump, lets it come on and dabs towards backward point. Fielder comes in quickly to cut off the single"
"back of a length outside off, and all these dots are definitely playing on Rohit's mind. Dabs it towards backward point, too close to the fielder to pick up a single, but he hurtles out of his crease anyway. Kohli sends him back, and he dives home as the throw misses the stumps"

"googly, pitches short and fairly wide outside off, lets it come on and dabs to short third man"
"back of a length on off stump, punched to long-on"
"tossed up outside off, and Kohli may have endangered Rohit's innings here. Stretches out and pushes into the point region, calls immediately for the single. Babaz runs in quickly from backward point, fires in a throw to Sarfraz, and Rohit, diving desperately, could be out in slightly unfortunate fashion here, his bat bouncing at impact and the part that is past the crease in the air when the bails go off. Is the bat in the air? The third umpire is checking. Given out, and from the angles shown, that seemed the right conclusion. They only showed the angle from point, though, not from square leg"

"short now, pulled along the ground to deep square leg"
"googly, pitches on a good length on middle and off and turns away. Stretches forward and blocks into the cover point region"
"tossed up wide of off, driven to sweeper cover"
"back of a length, turning towards off stump, punched down the ground to long-on"
"<b>dropped</b>. Hasan Ali puts down a sitter. Sees Yuvraj stepping out and bowls the wrong'un. Yuvraj slices his big hit out to long-off, who runs in, slides to his right, gets both hands to the chance, and drops it"
"shortish, turned into the leg side"
"another googly, pitches outside leg this time, comes forward to whip to midwicket"
"back of a length close to off stump, dabbed down to third man"
"back of a length close to off stump, jabbed away to backward point"
"shortish, a bit of width, and that's nicely done, chops it hard into the ground and it bounces up and eludes the backward point fielder diving to his left. Deep point moves right to stop it"
"again short with some width, and this time he opens his bat face and times his slice beautifully. Shadab dives right and makes an excellent stop at backward point"
"short again, but this one is dug in hard, a bouncer that gets up over Yuvraj's left shoulder and is too quick for him to hook"
"slower ball, too much width though. Yuvraj was already giving himself some room, and he spots the slower one, steadies himself, and uses that reach of his to slap it away crisply and beat deep point running to his left"
"short on off stump, pulled to the left of deep square leg"
"back of a length outside off, punched firmly and straight to backward point"
"length ball outside off, slapped away to deep point"

"full on middle and off, makes room but it's too full for him to go inside-out, jabs it to mid-off"
"full, drilled to long-on"
"length ball on middle stump, clipped away through midwicket"
"low full-toss outside off, jabbed down to mid-off"
"slower short ball, and that's a super shot from Yuvraj. He was into position early for the pull, but he held his shape, waited an instant, and then swatted it away to the left of midwicket"
"sees Yuvraj making room and follows him with a yorker close to his feet. Again, keeps a lovely still head, waits, and opens his bat face to squeeze it down to third man"
"full on off stump, whipped to deep midwicket"
"well bowled. Kohli made room, but went too early, and Hasan responded with the perfect wide yorker. Reached out to try and jab it away, but couldn't put bat to ball"
"excellent again. This is the off-stump yorker, with a bit of late inswing. Opens his bat face and stabs to backward point"
"whoa, what timing is that! That's very close to being a yorker, maybe missed it by an inch, no more. Yuvraj cleared his front leg slightly, and ball met ball next to his front foot, and he just shows the full face and hammers it down the ground, giving long-off no chance diving to his left"
"wide yorker, Yuvraj reaches out to force it away but can't connect"
"slower short ball on off stump, and this is vintage Yuvraj. Opens up at the hips and pulls it away over square leg"
"sees him looking to make room and bowls a length ball outside leg stump. Looks to flick, can only get pad onto ball, which rolls away into the leg side"
"short ball close to off stump, pulled away, but this time he doesn't time it as well, bounces down into the deep square leg region. The leg-side boundary is longer when he's facing from this end"
"full outside off, swiped hard down the ground, lots of bottom hand, along the ground to long-on"
"slower short ball on middle stump, he saw Yuvraj looking to make room. Saw it late, and ended up swatting it down, tennis-smash style, into the leg side for one"
"full, just outside off, and there's that bottom-handed Kohli whip we've seen so many times. Except he hits this straight to midwicket"
"<b>Dropped</b>. Fakhar Zaman running in from deep square leg. Slower bouncer slanting across to off stump, stopped on Kohli as he shaped to pull. Went through with the shot, top-edged it, and Zaman, who's come onto the field to substitute for Amir, slides in, gets both hands to it, and drops it"
"full slower ball on middle stump, shovelled in the air down the ground, lands around halfway to long-on. Didn't time it at all"
"low full-toss outside off, and Yuvraj can power these like no one else. Just punches it with a straight bat, hits it flat over the bowler, and long-on, despite having not much ground to cover to his right, has no chance of stopping it"
"wide yorker, stabbed away a short distance into the covers"
"slower ball, shortish on off stump, and Kohli brings up fifty with a six. He's been struggling to time the ball, and this one he just muscles, clears his front leg and flat-bats over long-on. Reacts with a yell to himself"
"full on off stump, squeezed away to sweeper cover"
"full-toss on off stump, and Yuvraj bashes it away. Again, just a straight-bat punch after clearing his front leg, smacks it to the left of long-on"
"wide yorker, and Kohli puts it away. Third man is very square, and he reaches out, meets it on the full with the toe end of his open-faced bat, and beats the fielder to his left. What's more, he's overstepped."
"looks for the yorker on the stumps, ends up bowling a half-volley close to Kohli's pads, and he whips it away over midwicket"
"that Amir injury is really hurting Pakistan here. Length ball on middle stump, and he just clears his front leg and shovels it with a straight bat over wide long-on"
"back of a length outside off, dabs it away to third man"
"ah, well. He's hit some astounding shots off the middle of that bat, and now he gets to fifty with a boundary off the edge. Bouncer, and his top-edged hook flies to the boundary to the right of the keeper"
"makes room now and Wahab bangs it in short outside off. Doesn't time the uppercut too well, loops up and lands a fair distance in front of third man"
"fired in flat and wide of off stump, the left-arm spinner's wide yorker. Virat leaves it, and looks at the umpire expectantly, but he doesn't signal wide"
"full outside off, not quite a wide yorker but close enough, driven hard to short extra"
"big appeal for lbw, Marais Erasmus isn't interested. Sarfraz asks for a review. Full, a near-yorker close to leg stump. Yuvraj looks to flick, misses, and the ball hits his foot. Did that pitch outside leg, though? No bat on it, I think. HotSpot suggests the toe of the bat hit the ground. Big distance between bat and ball. What says ball-tracking? Pitching just in line, and once we've established that, Yuvraj will have to walk back. That's crashing into middle stump, fairly low"
"yorker close to off stump, jabbed away towards backward point"
"misses the yorker, ends up bowling a half-volley outside off, and Kohli pummels a punchy drive to the extra-cover boundary"
"full again, wider this time, and Kohli has smashed that. It's a brilliant shot, bringing his bottom hand to play to slice underneath the ball and lift it over cover. Wow"

"Hardik starts it with a six. Full on off stump, he's cleared his front leg and launched it high over long-off"
"full again, but not full enough to deny elevation. Wider this time, and Hardik launches this over wide long-off, a more flat-batted hit on this occasion"
"three in a row! This one's pulled back slightly, and he's bowled it slower, on off stump. Hardik uses that extra time to step across, go down on one knee, and slog-sweep over deep midwicket"
"looks to slog-sweep again, and Imad denies him with one that's slowed down just enough. Swings too early, and misses. Ball hits high, over his back thigh and on his stomach. He was down on one knee, though. Pakistan have reviewed the not-out decision... Pitching on middle, straightening, and projected to tickle the bails. Umpire's call"

"a beauty from Bhuvneshwar. He ventures wide of the crease, angles it in, and gets it to swing away outside off, Shehzad chases it with a loose drive and is beaten neck and crop"
Bhuvneshwar drags his length back on middle Defended
"full, angled in, straightens a bit, defended back to the bowler"
"goes wide of the crease again, very full and angled in, beats the attempted flick and pings the pad, but this was going down with the exaggerated angle from over the wicket. Kohli decides against the review"

"Azhar hits on the up and nails it straight of mid-on. Length ball on middle, clears his front leg and pumps it down the ground"

"back of a length and angled in, worked past midwicket for one"

"back of a length and goes straight outside off, Azhar eyes up the leg side, and squirts a leading edge to third man"

Bhuvneshwar ventures wide of the crease, on a length and angled in, Shehzad plays across the line and is rapped on the front pad in front of off. The tracker returns three reds. Kohli roars and gives Shehzad a send-off"

"It has been a day of mistakes in the field. Yuvraj is the culprit now. Banged in short and outside off, rides the bounce, and ramps it to the right of Yuvraj at deep third man. Lazy effort from Yuvraj"
uppish drive to the left of Kohli at short cover
"runs down the track, this is flatter and faster, hitting the pad"
"arm-ball from Jadeja. An appeal for lbw, not given by umpire Dharmasena. Azhar plays across the line, hit in line with the stumps, but this was probably bouncing over"

"length ball on middle and leg, swept to the left of deep square leg"
"goes for the sweep again, it's a touch shorter, though, and the bounce means he gets a top-edge. Easy catch at deep square leg, Hardik moves a few steps to his right and takes it with both hands, cupped at around shoulder height"

"back of a length, goes with the arm towards off stump. Makes room and cuts to backward point"
"down the track comes Malik, and he's always been an excellent six-hitter. Doesn't get too close to the pitch of the ball, but that allows him the elevation. Just goes through with the shot, finishes with bat over his left shoulder as this soars way up over the bowler and then the sightscreen"
"goes back to a length ball on off stump, pokes it gently towards backward point"

"Ravindra Jadeja. What a left arm. Umesh sends down a length ball angling in towards top of off. Cramps Malik slightly, and he dabs it to the left of backward point and sets off for a single. He shouldn't have, because it was Jadeja moving quickly to the ball, towards his natural side. By the time he's realised and turned around, he's already out, caught out by a deadly, flat rocket of a direct hit"

"back of a length, fourth-stump line, punched into the point region"
"back of a length, angling into off stump, defended into the cover point region"
"length ball, a little bit wider, gets a nice stride forward to push into the covers. Sets off for a single for no reason, because he almost hit that straight to Rohit Sharma, and he turns around in a hurry. Throw misses at the keeper's end, but I suppose he'd have been in anyway"

"quicker, on middle and leg this time, whipped to midwicket off the back foot"
"fuller now, on middle stump, presses forward and blocks it back to the bowler"

"a bit wider outside off, and he gets down on one knee and slog-sweeps powerfully over wide long-on"

"fullish outside off, gets forward for a punchy drive to mid-off"
"shot! That's a good-length ball, angling into off stump, and he gets forward, head over the ball, and just punches with a straight bat to bisect non-striker and umpire. Umesh dives left from mid-on but can't stop it"
"oh my, keeper nicks to keeper. Almost guides it to the keeper. Looks for the open-faced dab to third man, but this back-of-a-length ball didn't offer him enough width, and bounced a touch extra to catch the outside third of the bat"

"shortish, close to off stump, punched into the cover point region"
"<b>dropped</b>. There have been some sitters dropped today, but nothing quite as simple as this. Back of a length outside off, and he slogs hard. Gets a thick edge that loops up to the left of cover. Jadhav has a long time to move and then steady himself. Cups his hands below his chin - maybe he was better off holding them up nearer his eye-line - and the ball just slips through"

"short, angling into the body, and Shadab was in a very awkward position, late to react. Flaps at it in the end - it was more reflex than a considered stroke - and manages to play it down towards long leg. Throw hits direct at the bowler's end, but Shadab is safely home"

"shortish, at the batsman's hip, tucked away to long leg"
"length ball on middle and off. Looks to get forward and push into the covers, ends up inside-edging through midwicket"

"back of a length outside off, chopped towards point"
"shortish, angled into the body, and that is that. Wahab Riaz is not going to bat here. Cramped for room, beaten for pace, and he aims an aimless flick at the ball and loops the simplest of catches to Dhawan at midwicket"
