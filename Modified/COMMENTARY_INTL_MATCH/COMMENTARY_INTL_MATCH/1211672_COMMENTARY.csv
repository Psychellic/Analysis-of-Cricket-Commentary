"slower ball, too early into the push and this is bowled in a good channel, just outside off. Beats the batsman. Straightens a touch and past the outside edge"
"<b>diving catch by the keeper</b> and Maqsood has struck. Good ball, on a hard length and nipping away. Lyth goes to drive without moving his feet, gets a healthy edge that is travelling to Walton's left, but he pulls off an acrobatic catch."
"length ball outside off, stands up tall and punches through point, where the fielder dives and gets a hand to it. That slows the ball enough to be pulled inside the boundary. Good shot to get his innings going"

"good length outside off, driven firmly from the crease but can't beat cover"
"fullish on a fifth stump line, comes on the front foot to steer towards point"
"<b>oh that's mighty unlucky</b>. Masood has been run out at the non-striker's end because Ashraf belted a drive straight, which Amir has got a touch of a boot on. Masood had no time to react and get his back back in the crease. The ball was hit hard but Amir reacted quickly by sticking his left foot out. Couldn't stop the ball, but ended up getting a better result. Messi couldn't have done it better with the delicate deflection - though that is not what Amir intended."

He tickled it fine and set off for a run. There was none there and the non-striker didn't respond. Rossouw was halfway down the pitch when he turned around to try and make it back, but the bowler had enough time to run up to the stumps and break them as the keeper flicked him the ball."

"still going across his stumps. This one almost lands in the slot, but he can't connect cleanly with the hoick across the line. Gets a thick inside edge towards fine leg"
"length ball coming into him on off stump, dabbed into the offside. They take a quick single even as the fielder swoops in to hit the stumps direct. Afridi is in, but he can't take a second off the ricochet having over-run"
"and walks across again, predictably enough now. Banged in on a hard length, not enough room to free his arms. Short-arm pull mistimed through midwicket"
"back of a length outside off, steered to third man"
"back of a length on a fourth stump line, stays beside the ball and cuts to third man"
"slower bouncer and he's completely foxed by that. Moves across his stumps, as he's done all innings long. Drops his bat thinking it'll be a wide but the bouncer goes past him"
"and that is a quicker one in the channel, Afridi ends up beaten, feeling for it"

"<b>finally connects one</b>. He's been walking across his stumps all innings long, gets one back of a length that is in the right spot, pulls it over deep square leg. Still not perfectly timed but hit hard enough"
"<b>caught at long-on</b>. Moves across again, this time Arshad bowls it full. Afridi gets a lot of bottom hand onto this one, makes decent connection actually but can't get properly underneath it and it goes in a flattish arc to Hales, who takes it above his head, well inside the boundary."
"fuller on off, driven to cover"
"quick bouncer, was late on it, but ends up making good connection by going through his shot quickly. To deep midwicket's right, for a couple"

keeps this one back of a length but wide outside off. Tanvir reaches for it and squirts it to a squarish third man
"<b>lovely</b>. Makes some room and lofts this straight back over the bowler's head, all the way over the boundary. Beautiful execution by Bopara. This was a full and slower ball, and he hit it cleanly"
"<b>he's picked out deep midwicket</b>. Normal pace ball, back of a length outside off. Bopara swivels and pulls - times it really well in fact - but he's hit it straight to the fielder."

"good short ball, climbing up on him at the stumps, he manages to get bat on it to squirt to third man. Tanvir calls him through for a single to get back on strike. A direct hit at the bowler's end would have been the end of Ilyas."
"<b>nails the pull</b>. Short outside off, he goes back and is in control of the pull shot. Places is perfectly to find the deep midwicket boundary"
"another short one but slower, early into the pull, goes off the bottom half of the bat towards square leg"
"yorker outside off, but he's stepped away to give himself room, goes down on one knee and carves it to third man"
"yorker goes wrong, full toss outside off, but he can't get timing on his punch, goes straight to extra cover"
"yorker on off to start, can only toe-end it back down the pitch towards the bowler"
<b>wham</b>. That's been powerfully hit. Was going for another yorker but ends up as a full toss that Tanvir smacks over deep square leg. That's gone on the roof. Excellent timing on that.
<b>boom</b> there goes another one. This time he comes on the front foot to a full ball and swings with extended arms to get it over long-on
cramps him for room this time as he's stepping away and he pushes it to the bowler's left. Takes the single so he's off strike
"back of a length coming into him, he misses connecting with the pull but it flicks his thigh pad and goes fine for four leg byes"
"<b>dropped at long-off</b> and they get two off the last ball. Backs away to slog this but gets it off the toe-end while down on his knee. Babar at long-off has to run to his left. The ball's swirling high, but he can't quite get under it. Ends up having to lunge for it and can't hold on."
"floated up on a length outside off, driven to mid-off"
"flatter and straigther, tapped to mid-on"
"tossed up outside off, slightly round-arm. driven back to the bowler"

"length ball around off, goes back to pull it through square leg. Not timed well"
"<b>and again</b>. This is even better than the boundary last over. Back of a length again but you would think not short enough to pull through midwicket. Unless you're Babar Azam of course. He transfers weight back, gets on top of the bounce and pulls - all in one fluid motion"
"length outside off, glides it to third man"
"length outside off, steered to third man"
"oooh that was a strange shot. Length ball nibbling around off, he almost wanted to pull out of a shot then decided at the last moment to dab it to third man off the end of the bat while pulling away. They get two with good running, the ball's fine enough that the third man fielder has to run to his left a bit"
"pushed to mid-off, takes a couple of steps and decides against the single early"
"<b>caught at deep square leg</b>. Imran Tahir almost dropped it, popped out of his hands but he caught it with his right hand even as he was sliding down with the momentum. Back of a length, Sharjeel swivels and pulls it hard. Tahir has to run to his right to make ground and he gets there, then holds on eventually. Smile on his face with ball in his hand as he ends up in a relaxed sitting pose on the ground."
"back of a length very straight, nicely done by Hales who moves across and glances it fine"
very straight and Babar shows the full face of the bat to punch it back. Tanvir manages to stop it on his follow through
"fuller and on the fifth stump, tries to clip it back straight but doesn't time it that well. Tanvir again gets some body on it and deflects it to extra cover"
"<b>huge appeal not given</b> and Tanvir wants a review. But they don't take one. The ball probably pitched outside leg. On a length, Babar was moving across to clip it fine, goes off his pads to square leg. Good decision to not take the review, that ball pitched outside leg"
"length on the stumps, stands tall to punch to extra cover"
"<b>class</b>. Too full on the stumps, and driven to the bowler's left. Nobody moved"
<b>dismissive</b>. Length ball on leg stump and Babar just stays still and pulls to deep square leg. No fielder there. He's managed to play a pull shot with the minimal movement of a glance almost. I have no idea how he does it.

"<b>punched</b> and finds the gap through point Back of a length, stays on the back foot and beside the ball and times it beautifully"

<b>biffed to long-on</b>. Full ball and he uses bottom-hand power to punch this. Not very high but enough to <i>just</i> clear mid-on

"down the track, full toss and he tries to smack it over deep square but gets the under-edge that rolls down"
comes on the front foot to drive this fuller one to long-off
"<b>another run out at the non-striker's end</b>. Happened to Masood in the first innings and now Hales is the unfortunate man. Babar came down the track and bashed this hard at the bowler, to his right.

"loud appeal but inside edge onto pad. Skids on from a length, he was coming forward to defend"
"back of a length outside off, he goes to pull it and <b>he's broken his bat</b>. That's snapped clean from near the handle almost. The part that broke missed hitting the stumps though. Ball goes through midwicket"
"loud and sustained appeal for an lbw but this might have been going down leg, and height also an issue. <b>They've gone for a review</b>. Babar had moved across actually so that is a lot straighter than I thought. Pitched on a length and nipped in, Babar missed it. <b>and it's umpire's call on impact</b>. Just clipping the top of the stumps. Close call for Babar. Multan retain the review"
"fuller on the stumps, uses his wrists to flick through midwicket"
"fuller outside off, and he unfurls a nicely timed cover drive. Tahir has to run to his right, slide, and stop the ball from going over the ropes. Good work by the 41-year-young man"
"nippy, back of a length and coming into him, he flashes at it but doesn't connect. Goes between bat and body to the keeper"
"too full swinging in and ends up on the pads, flicked to deep midwicket"

"down the track, wanted to go over the offside but it rolls off the inside edge towards midwicket"
"<b>dropped at long-on</b>. Tough chance, diving forward. Down the track he went, couldn't quite get it cleanly, got it off the end of the bat. The ball was looping towards long-on and the fielder ran in and dived straight but could get only fingertips to it. Would have been a spectacular catch"
"<b>skier caught at cover</b>. Strange shot-selection from Iftikhar, who has looked to be ultra aggressive this over. Down the track again, wants to go straight and over, but gets a toe-end that swirls up high. Well judged catch"
comes down the track and punches but straight to cover

"fuller on the pads, turned to deep midwicket"

"flatter on the pads, flicked to long-on"
"<b>b-e-a-u-tiful</b>. Steps down the track and lofts this cleanly, the timing's so good that it's sailed way over long-on. Got to the pitch and swung his bat in a clean, pleasing arc"

"length ball on off, punched through cover. Direct hit ricochet gives them an extra run. Hit at the striker's end and narrowly rolled passed the keeper's helmet. Would have been five runs"
"fuller on the stumps, patted towards mid-on. The bowler can't get there while diving to his right so they take a single"
down legside and he'll have to rebowl that. Imad wanted to get some bat on it but can't connect with the pull
"fuller on the stumps, flicked off his toes to deep square leg"
"<b>edge</b> but perhaps didn't carry to the keeper. Landed just short of him. Good ball on off, nipping away, Babar dropped his hands in time when he realised the ball was not there to drive on the up, and got the edge. But because he had dropped his hands the ball didn't carry. Third man fields"
"fuller on the pads, flicked to deep square leg"
"length ball on the stumps, punched from the crease to mid-off's left."
"back of a length well outside off, comes down the track and slaps it to deep cover"
"good length on a tight line on off, punched to cover"
"<b>caught behind</b>. There might be a twist yet. Babar was giving himself room to thrash this through the offside, but Tanvir had bowled this much straighter, and he gets bounce too. Ended up too close to Babar and bouncing a tad more than he expected, and he edges it through to the keeper"
"length ball on leg stump, comes nicely inside the line and clips it off his pads through square leg"
"<b>caught at long-on</b>. Full ball on the stumps, he made some room to loft this straight. Doesn't get it quite of the middle and he can only pick out long-on. Not perhaps the best choice of shot when you need about a run a ball"

"fuller outside off, nicely forward to push this to cover's right"
"flat and full on a sixth stump line, Imad drives to long-off again"

"stump to stump, length ball, punched to mid-off"
"length on off, flat batted to long-off"
"<b>direct hit from point and Parnell is run out</b>. That was strange running from Parnell, he was just jogging. Good length ball outside off, nicely cut but straight to point. Imad has called him through for the single - right call I think since he needs to be on strike. Parnell just jogs across. The fielder takes aim and shatters the stumps with Parnell yards short."
<b>stunning</b>. Pressure building and Imad just goes back deep and uses wrists and bottom hand to flick this from outside off to over deep midwicket
"fuller, punched to extra cover"
"back of a length outside off, he makes room to try and swing at it but misses"
backs away and punches this over the bowler's head down the ground. Not great connection as it bounces to long-off
"length ball outside off, and he threads the gap between point and short third man with a finely timed boundary"
"superb start by the bowler. A bouncer that is on target, has Amir ducking into it and holding up his bat to fend at it. Takes the helmet I think on the way to the keeper"
"<b>straight down deep midwicket's throat!</b> but it has brought Imad back on strike. Amir went for the glory shot, short ball dug into the pitch, not enough pace on it, Amir goes back to pull. Doesn't get a good enough hit and picks out the fielder. But the batsmen have crossed"
"full outside off, he was moving across and uses wrists again to try to seep it through midwicket. He's looking for two but will have to settle for one"
"full outside off and he nails the shot, carves it over extra cover for a single"
<b>dot ball as Imad lets it go!</b> He went for the wide outside off one and I think he's lucky to get away with it. The ball was cutting across the tram line as it passed the batsman!
<b>finishes with a four to get a Super Over</b>. Imad moves waaay across to be on a seventh stump line and Ilyas bowls it there. He plays a wonderful pick up off his legs backward square leg and finds the boundary to tie the scores.
