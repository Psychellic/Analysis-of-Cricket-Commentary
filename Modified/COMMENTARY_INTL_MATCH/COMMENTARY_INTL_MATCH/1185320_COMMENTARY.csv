tucked to the leg side

fired out wide as Miller advances with purpose. Met way outside off with a flick of the wrists to deep midwicket
"through to the keeper, a hint of turn"
"bludgeoned off the front foot, and a well-judged two into the covers. Miller was confidently into position, flowing through the line. Good start to the over"
"rising delivery outside off, Miller rides the bounce well and the lack of pace on the stroke makes it four from two in this over. The ideal measured start ..."
"hanging back in the crease, nurdled from under the eyeline to midwicket. Another single brings the near-centurion Malan onto strike. Miller has a quiet word, no risks needed yet..."

"low full toss, pumped to mid-off, another single"
"<B>round the wicket, yorker, nudged, boundary!</B> It was edgy, but it was calculated, an open face on the full length, racing through a very fine third man, and Malan brings up his maiden hundred with a hugely valuable boundary!"
"banged in short, Miller reaches for the pull, and hits down on the stroke through midwicket. Runs are coming easily at the moment ..."

"on the back foot, flicked to the leg side"
"cracked hard into the covers again, Malan is letting his confidence flow through him at the moment. It might give Australia a sniff, but it could also seal this contest with overs to spare..."
"clipped off the pads, and <B>more priceless runs!</B> Starc overstrains for the magic ball, and feeds the legs"
"drilled into the off-side, no way through this time"
"lovely inswinging yorker, but Miller is equal to it with a flip off the toes. Miss that and it's plumb!"
"<strong>battered hard through the covers!</strong> Starc is getting it wrong all over the shop, searching for the blockhole, missing it, paying the price!"
"hooping inswing from round the wicket, <strong>but that's a stunning riposte!</strong> Picking it up with stiff wrists, high over backward square, hitting with the angle from round the wicket, and South Africa's requirement is inside a run a ball"
"full toss, another loose one, but belted to point this time. No matter, the damage for that over has been done. It's in touching distance now!"
"back of a length, dabbed back down the track with no guile in the stroke. Have a dot and bowl me another..."

"<strong>pulled, top-edged, safe!</strong> Clawed across the line, off the shoulder, it took off over the keeper's head but was swept up before reaching the rope"
"<B>clobbered into the stands behind square!</B> Janne the Man! High and handsome, cashing in on the short ball and giving it the kitchen sink! Bloemfontein is going stark raving bonkers!"
"attempted squeeze through short third man, no way through there"
"yorker, well bowled, but equally well dug out, a single to cover"
"very full, drilled to mid-off ... not this time ..."
"full toss, inswinging, <B>crashed to the cover boundary to seal the series!</B>"
