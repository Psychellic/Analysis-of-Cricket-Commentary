"back of a length, angling across to off stump, and backward point dives left to stop the attempted steer to third man. A good bit of bounce, so he took his bottom hand off while playing the ball, in order to keep it down"
"ooh, maybe a hint of inswing on a middle-stumpish line, pitched right up. Looks to drive through mid-off, possibly, and ends up squeezing the ball away between his legs and to the right of the square-leg umpire and it simply runs all the way to the boundary"
"full on off stump, driven to mid-off"
"full on middle and leg, a bit of inswing, gets his front leg out of the way and pushes towards mid-off. Afridi falls over in his follow-through, but he looks okay to continue once he gets back on his feet"
"back of a length, slanting across and finishing in a tight channel close to off stump. Left alone"
"shot. Not that short or wide, but the ball sits up nicely and he steps back and across to cut fiercely to the right of backward point"
"full outside off, gets forward and drives to cover point"
"quickish, angling into off stump, punched back to the bowler off the front foot"
"a touch back of a length, steps a long way back and across to work it into the leg side from outside off stump. No real turn at all"

"quickish, angling into leg stump, clipped into the square leg region"
"back of a length on off stump, makes room to cut and backward point dives right to stop the ball"
"shortish, slanting away from off stump, may have stopped on the batsman a little. Malan swivels through an attempted pull and misses. Went under his bat"
"shot. Length ball, slanting to off stump, makes room while shuffling out of his crease and flat-bats it over mid-off"
"shot! This one was pitched further up, and on leg stump, in an attempt to deny him hitting room, but he steps away from the line again and drives it back over the bowler's head, finishing with a high left elbow as the ball soars over the rope"
"back of a length on off stump, gets on his toes and punches into the point region"

"flatter through the air, on the pads, turned away to mid on area for a single"
"shortish, slower through the air, punched straight to cover"
"gone! This is given lbw, but Malan reviews it immediately. This is flattish, fast on the stumps, angled in and not turning. Malan gets a lot of bat on it, but it seems to have flicked his back pad first. And sure enough, the replay shows that it grazed the pad before his bat came down and hit it into the offside. This is not looking good for Malan. It's hit him right in front of middle and is going on to clatter into the stumps. Original decision remains. End of a promising innings. SA lose a review too."
"length ball wide of off stump, Markram stands tall and punches that wide of mid off for a single"
"short ball, angled slightly across Lubbe, who rocks back in a flash and pulls it waay in front of square over the the top of the infield for four. Early shot of confidence"
"length ball, outside off. Lubbe can only get that as far as the legside infield"
"slower ball, 122kph, and Hasan has fooled him with that. This is fullish, outside off stump. Lubbe is trying to hit this down the ground but is through the shot way too early. Ends up spooning a catch to cover, who doesn't have a lot of work to do to get under that one."
"fullish ball on off stump, driven just wide of mid off, who rushes across to cut off the single"
"full outside off stump again, driven wide of mid off again, but they can scamper the single this time, as the fielder has more work to do"

"hits a hard length on off stump, punched quietly down the ground towards long-on"
"full-toss to start, outside off, and opens his bat face and slices a drive between point and backward point. May have been a touch unintentional. Seemed to be aiming through extra-cover"
"four more! this time Qadir drops a little short, and he rocks back to slap it away to the left of the diving sweeper cover fielder"

"full on off stump again, clipped into the gap between long-on and deep midwicket"
"quickish length ball on middle and leg, clipped quietly into the midwicket region"

"back of a length on off stump, again he just stands there and pulls, no real footwork but he's in a great position nonetheless, along the ground this time to the left of deep square leg"

"slower ball on off stump, clipped back to the bowler with a turn of the wrists"
"another slower ball, but it's right in Markram's slot outside off. Gets a good stride forward, but with his left foot going towards the leg side to create hitting room, and from there a free swing of his arms sends the ball soaring over the long-on boundary"
"full on leg stump, clipped to deep midwicket"
"shot. Short ball, sliding on towards middle and leg. Makes a lot of room and carves it away between point and backward point"
"stays back to a flat length ball outside off, and punches crisply through cover point to bring up a 30-ball half-century. Well played!"
"flat, skids through on off stump and hits Klaasen on the thigh as he looks to work it into the leg side"

"tossed up full on middle and leg, clipped towards deep midwicket"
"wrong'un, spinning from middle to leg. Gets forward and plays an inside-out push into the covers"
"he can do even better. Quickish slider that follows Markram who's looking to make room for the back-foot punch through the covers, and cramps him for room. Only manages a thick outside edge that Rizwan does well to grab after a bit of a juggle"
"nicely bowled. Slows it down on off stump, and manages to get a bit of grip and turn. Stretches out and pushes quietly into the cover point region"
"again he flights it, this time a bit fuller on middle and leg, and Klaasen clips it away through midwicket to bring up South Africa's 100"
"some turn again from a leg-stump line. Presses forward and pushes into the covers. Can't go too hard at it when it's turning like that, from a good length"
"fires it in quicker on the pads, goes right back to punch to the right of long-on"
"sharp turn again. Quickish on leg stump, and he comes forward and looks to work it with the angle. Ends up sending a leading edge rolling towards backward point"
"short, wide, and Klaasen slaps it away in trademark style. Just stands there and lashes it away to the left of cover"
"straighter, goes deep in his crease and punches gently into the mid-on region, and there's no one inside the circle in that direction so they can pick up two. Smart batting"
"short, sits up again on an off-stump line, and that's really quick hands from Klaasen through the short-arm pull, once again he clears the boundary, this time just in front of square"
"back of a length close to off stump, lets it come on and opens his bat face to stab to backward point"
"shortish, a bit of width, and he slaps it away, but this time cover point is back on the boundary to restrict K;laasen to a single"

"short, spinning away from off stump, flat-batted to long-off"
"tossed up outside off, and it lands too full, and when you do that, it doesn't matter if you have the sweeper back. Driven powerfully to beat extra-cover to his left, and the sweeper has too much distance to cover to his right"

"flat slider on off stump, looks to flat-bat it through the covers but is slightly cramped for room and the ball rolls towards the extra-cover fielder without too much pace"

"another lbw appeal as Babar misses the flick, but once again the ball pitched outside leg"

"bam. Another slog-sweep, another six. Right up in Fakhar's arc, and he opens up at the hips to make himself swinging room before he sinks onto his back knee. Clears the boundary just in front of square"
"gone, excellent work at the boundary! And well bowled by Shamsi too. Makes him fetch this slog-sweep from wide outside off, against the turn, and he can't quite hit it off the meat of his bat. Janneman Malan takes the catch while backtracking at the midwicket boundary, and then he flicks it up before crossing the line and then jumps back into the field of play and completes the catch comfortably.
