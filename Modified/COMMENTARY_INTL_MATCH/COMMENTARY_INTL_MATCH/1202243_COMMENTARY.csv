Looks like he was preparing himself for a length ball, saw this suddenly coming towards his stumps and by the time the bat came down, the timber had been knocked out."
"<strong>throw at the wrong end? Run out missed.</strong> Tapped to point, Kusal called Oshada through and stopped. The throw should've been at the striker's end. Iyer could've still perhaps had him at the bowler's end too, needed a direct hit."

mistimes the pull to fine leg
"backs away and pulls, one bounce to deep midwicket"
"he's reverse pulled him for six! Short, but this came out off his hand very slowly, Kusal changed his grip and helped it along literally. Had all the time in the world because of the slowness off the pitch"
"the thigh five from Dhawan at long-on! Deceived Kusal in flight as he stepped out, Kuldeep also tossed it wider so he had to reach out to the delivery, and because of that he didn't generate the same power. Dhawan had to move a fair but to his right, held on with the ropes within touching distance"

"short of a length, nips away from outside off, and he can run this down towards third man"
"full, swings in, and starts around middle, going further down leg. Dhawan jams his bat down just in time to prevent that from clanging into his foot. Driven towards mid on"
"in-swinging yorker again, and Dhawan defends after getting his feet out of the way"
"slower ball, just outside off, and Dhawan charges down to meet it. Steers it past point, and to the left of third man. They run hard and manage to make it through for two. A better throw could have had him scampering back to the striker's end"
"inswinging yorker again, starts from around middle and tails down the leg side. Dhawan gets hit on the boot first, and then on to bat. Just squirts it away towards short mid-wicket"
"charges down to meet a fuller ball swinging in, and driven towards mid-off. There's a shy at the stumps, and no backing up! <b>Bonus runs spoil what was a very good over from the captain</b>"
"fast, full, and he looks to drive this, but it goes along the ground towards third man. <strong>Bowled at 147.1kph!</strong>"

"a touch short, outside off, and he hangs his bat out to run this down to third man"
"<strong>ooh, gorgeous!</strong> Malinga delivers this a touch wide of off, swinging further away, and Rahul just extends his front leg and drives through extra cover. Timed to perfection, and he held the pose for the shutterbugs too!"
"another cover drive, with the ball slightly wider this time. There's a good attempt by the man at cover-point to pull this back, but his foot has touched the rope!"
"length, straighter, and opens up Rahul a touch. Just a hint of movement away, and Rahul is squared up as he tries to defend. Played towards short cover"
"length, outside off, and he taps this down towards third man, bat close to body"
"Dhawan charges Malinga again, and drives a fuller ball at the stumps. Cut off by cover, moving swiftly to his left, but he cannot prevent a single"

"<strong>lovely shot!</strong> That's a length ball turning into him, and he just makes some room for himself, and then places this between cover and mid-off with surgeon-like precision"

"full, and he drifves this to long-off"

"uppish, but in the gap between cover and cover-point. Kumara has a wry smile on his face. This was another chang up, fuller, and almost extracted the mistake from Rahul. But the Indian opener has activated his cheat code tonight!"
"dug in short, and he looks to pick it up from outside off. Hits it hard on to the ground just near his foot"
"sharp, short ball, and Rahul looks to pull this away. Off his midriff, and towards third man. He nearly topples over, but does well to stay away from his stumps. <strong>This will smart his ribs for a while!</strong>"
"slower ball, a touch wide of off, and Dhawan cannot lay bat on it with a swat"
"fuller ball, driven to the left of long-on"
"fuller ball, and he looks to swat this through mid-wicket. Fails to get it away cleanly, and that's also a missed stumping, as the ball nicks the pads and runs towards fine leg"
drives a length ball to covers
nurdles a length ball away towards mid-wicket
uses his feet and slaps a length ball outside off towards long-on
"full ball, and he drives this back down the wicket. A slight misfield in his follow-through from the bowler, and the ball ricochets away towards long-on"
"length, outside off, angles in. Shanaka appeals, as Rahul plays it away towards point. He believes that got pad first, but the replays indicate it was bat only, in fact"
"length ball, driven to the right of cover. He scrambles away to save the ball from crossing the inner ring, but they get a single anyway"

"slower ball, around middle and off, and he drives this towards mid-off"

"slower ball, on the pads, and he looks to flog this towards mid-wicket. Bat misses ball completely"
"<strong>Rahul is the first to go!</strong> Fails to pick Hasaranga's googly, delivered from wide of the crease. Comes down the wicket, with an intent of going inside out, possibly. Ends up swinging at thin air, and that goes on and just strikes the top of off. Hasaranga raises his index finger in celebration. A scratchy, yet entertaining Rahul innings comes to an end"

"slower ball, around the pads, and Iyer whips it away towards fine leg. The man at short fine leg has done well to dive away to his left and scramble it close to himself"
"short, and this time he has placed this to the left of deep square leg. Does well to bend a bit more and get outside the line of that ball, after which it was virtually more of a standing lap shot. Well played, Shikhar!"
"tossed up, around off, and he taps this wide of point for an easy single"
"this could be close! Sri Lanka refer after <strong>there's a leg-before appeal turned down</strong> as Dhawan misses a sweep that looks quite adjacent. A big stride forward, no doubt, but this straightens after pitching around middle. No inside edge, either. Pitches inline, impact inline, and three reds as it just nicks the leg stump. Hasaranga has struck again!"

"short ball, and he plays this away with a roll of the wrists towards deep square leg"
"a bit short of a length, and he defends this towards short mid-wicket"

"slower ball, around off, and he drives this hard, but fielded by cover"
"short, slower ball, and he guides this down towards deep backward square leg"

"slower ball, and he moves across to take it from around off, and whip it towards deep mid-wicket. Wants two for it, but the fielder is fast to converge on this"

"slower ball, around leg stump, and he runs it down towards fine leg. Just a little nudge, and it keeps it to the right of short fine leg"
"short, and he rocks back and swings this hard towards deep square leg. Gunathilaka gets down low to his left and cuts this off and saves two for his team"
"ooh, <strong>smacks a short ball </strong>over the long leg fence! Don't think he was in complete control, but he knew the fielder was much squarer, and hence made no effort to keep it down"
whips a fuller ball around middle disdainfully towards the deep mid-wicket fence. Two runs on offer
"fuller ball, and driven towards deep mid-wicket"
"slower ball, and he goes back and drives this towards deep mid-wicket"
"gets his man with a short ball! Smart bowling, as he digs this in short, but leaves it outside off, inviting Iyer to take him on. This was always going to be difficult to control, especially with the kind of pace Kumara generates, and that takes it to deep square leg's safe hands"
"greets him with a shortish ball, but not enough to go around his shoulder. Pant wafts it away, across the line, towards deep square leg"
"<strong></strong><strong>ooh, finished in style!</strong> Kohli gets inside the line of a short ball, and then whips it on one leg over the long leg fence. Meeting fire with fire, in every respect. Punches gloves with the non-striker, and now acknowledges the congratulations from the opposition players"
