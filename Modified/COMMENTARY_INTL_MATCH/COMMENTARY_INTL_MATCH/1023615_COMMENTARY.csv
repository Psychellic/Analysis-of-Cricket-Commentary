"back of a length outside off, gets on his toes and on top of the bounce, driven away through point"
"short and wide, shapes away"
"back of a length, shaping away from off, and slapped hard on the up, and <b>dropped</b>. Difficult one for Pollard at short point. It flies away to his left, he's air-bound as he gets a hand, but can't hold on"
"back of  a length outside off, left alone"
"good length, swinging away outside off, driven nicely but straight to mid-off"
"short and wide, jumps up and stabs at the ball, fumbled at backward point"
"good length, leg stump, pushed away to short fine off the back foot"

"short and wide, cut straight to point"
"tossed up on off stump, tries to slog it to the same region as he got his boundary, but the ball has hurried to him, and he can't get either placement or elevation - straight to Weatherald at mid-on"
"back of a length, spinning away from off, defended off the back foot"
"follows the batsman down leg, bowls a full toss, driven down to mid-on who shies at the stumps and would've got his man with a direct hit. Unfortunately, it's overthrows"
"floats a full toss across the left hander, driven down to long-on"
"follows him again, but this time it's overpitched and in his zone. He leans into the drive and places it past mid-on for four"
"shapes to make room again but holds his ground. It's tossed up on off, low full toss, slapped to long-off"
"flat on a good length on the pads, tucked away behind square off the front foot"
"full toss on off stump, he leans in and tries to place it between covers and mid-off but can't get the timing. Straight to mid-off."
"short and wide, goes back and throws his hands at it, but the timing is way off. Thick inside edge, once bounce to covers"
"back of a length, angled into the pads, tries to tuck it past short fine but can't connect"
"good length, outside off, caught behind! He should've been forward there. Instead, he tries to make room, clears his front leg and tries to chop it behind square. Healthy edge on that and easy catch"
"good length, angled into the batsman from outside off, defended off the front foot"
"back of a length, outside off, gets behind and punches it nicely, but straight to covers"

"good length, angled across the left hander, gets forward and defends to covers"
"full and angling away from off stump, times his off drive well, but mid-off gets around"
"What a catch! Pitched short, climbs from a leg stump line, Sangakkara gets back and absolutely crunches his hook shot, but O'Connor, who is a few yards in on that long fine leg boundary, leaps backwards and completes a stunning catch. That ball was mean as it traveled, flat, towards the boundary."
"145 kph, inswinging yorker on off stump, he tries to get his bat down, but is locked by his front leg that has moved across, and it catches him on the boot"
"good length, angled in on middle stump, waits for it and pushes into the open leg side off the back foot"
"Crunched! Stanlake goes for the bouncer, it's slightly outside off. He frees his arms, gets back and across and pulls it to the square leg boundary"
"OH DEAR! Good length just outside off stump, his hands go faster than his feet, he's nowhere near it. Gets a little big on him as he tries a big cover drive and the thick outside edge finds backward point"
"What's happening here! Good length, angling in towards off, he gets forward to defend but not enough, gets an inside edge that nearly clips the stumps"
"full and wide, throws his hands at it, it goes rapidly to the left of covers, who puts in a dive and is up in a flash"
"full on middle stump, jammed out of the blockhole to mid-on. They take off for a single and mid-on misses the wickets with his throw. Would've been trouble"
"good length in the corridor, gets right forward and pushes it to mid-off"
"good length outside off, moves away a little bit and goes over the batsman's ambitious on-the-up cover drive"
"low full toss on off stump, tries to drive it through the open mid-off region, but the bat turns in his hands. Hits it into the pitch, and it bobbles down towards the boundary. Mid-on gets around to cut it off"
"full, angled into middle stump, flicks it away to deep square"
"back of a length in the corridor, gets on the back foot and stabs it down to third man"
"back of a length in the corridor, angled in slightly, defended off the back foot"
"back of a length outside off, shifts his weight backwards and lifts it gracefully over mid-on. Well-timed."
"Looks in great touch. Full outside off, leans in, elbow high, places his drive beautifully past mid-off"
"short, angling in on an off stump line at chest height. He tries to pull this one into the leg side, but doesn't connect. Goes off his ribs to first slip who appeals for a catch. Not out."
"short on off stump, gets back, makes room, and punches it to deep covers"
"short and wide, cut away to sweeper cover"
"short outside off, and it's a googly. Spins back in, cramps the batsman, but he still manages to punch it through the gap"
"another googly, and this time the cut goes straight to point"
"tossed up on off stump, gets on one knee and slaps it off the front foot to long-off"
"good length, fired down the leg side, gets down to sweep it and gets some bat. Deep square runs some distance to the right to cut it off. Slips at the non-strikers end. Would've been two."
"full slower ball outside off, reaches out and pushes to the right of point"
"116 kph, slower ball on a good length, just outside off stump, comes forward and has to check his shot"

"short and wide, cut straight to point"
"slower ball, full on middle stump, flicked straight at short midwicket"
"slower ball, full and outside off, leans in to his cover drive. The fielder dives to his left and keeps it to a single"
"low full toss on middle stump, driven to long-on"
"full on off stump, tries to push through covers, it's too quick. Jammed back to the bowler"
"drops short and wide, adjusts his wrists nicely to hit his cut to the left of the sweeper"
"drifted full on the pads, driven down to long-on"
"short on off stump, tries to pull this through midwicket but only manages to slice it in the air. Lands safely in front of long-on"
"short and wide, uses his wrists on the cut again, but the fielder has moved more square now and he finds him"
"slower ball on a length outside off, dabs it down to third man off the back foot"
"slower ball, good length on off stump, he takes a step forward, offers the full face and lifts it classily over mid-off"
"good length outside off, slower ball, pushed off the front foot, effortlessly, through the covers"
"full slower ball on off stump, checks his drive, bowler gets across and stops it"
"slower bouncer on middle, hangs back and waits for it, and then guides his pull shot nicely behind square"
"full outside off, carved away to sweeper covers"
"full down the leg side, attempts the sweep, gets a pad on it and it balloons up and lands between keeper and short fine"
"flighted, good length on middle, makes room and pushes straight to covers"
"good length on off, makes room and drives it to sweeper cover"
"flat on a good length, middle stump, pushed into the open offside infield, point gets around and hits the wickets on the non-strikers end with a diving underarm throw"

"drifted in to middle stump, makes room and drives it inside-out"
"slower ball on a length at off stump, steps down the track and bunts it back to the bowler"
"slower ball on a length at middle stump, pushed off the front foot to midwicket"
"slower ball on middle stump, goes back and glances off his hips to short fine"
"<b>dropped</b>! Full outside off, gets down on his knees and tries to cream it inside-out, but doesn't get enough bat. Pollard runs in, covers the ground but drops it as he lunges forward to take it. Poor from him."
"slower ball on middle and leg, Wells clips it through midwicket"
nudged off his pads through midwicket again
"shortish and outside off, he backs away and cuts, gets a thick outside edge towards third man"
"another short delivery, which is eased to deep point. Good, quick movement back into the crease"
lobs it up high over the batsman's eyeline and he lofts it over to long-off
waits for the flatter delivery on off stump and guides it behind point
"aims to flat bat a flighted delivery down the ground, but the change in pace - this is a little slower through the air - makes him mistime it past the bowler. There's a quick check for a run-out as the throw from long-off is collected and then lobbed back onto the stumps by Brad Hodge. He's safe"
"tossed up on leg stump, he clears the front leg and drives to long-on"
"shortish and outside off, Webster aims to pull, but there's just a little more heat on this than he thinks. Mistimes the ball wide of mid-on"
"helped into the crowd in the second tier at midwicket. Superb strike, and it brings up his fifty too, when his team was in crisis. Good knock from Wells. And this shot signifies why he's succeeded. He's looked to attack, and he's made good decisions in terms of shot selection. This is short, into the body and so the pull shot was the logical answer"
"full and into the pads, clipped to long leg"
"powers it over the fielder at short midwicket, and then looks at the bottom of his bat. Webster manages to get just enough on a short ball to send it away. Stanlake began with two wickets in his first over, this one though, hasn't been good"
"short and wide, lashed past point's right and Pollard, running leagues to his left, manages to stop the boundary. Too many boundary balls"
bops it over midwicket. Doesn't quite have full control of it as Stanlake goes full and at his toes.
"pushes it through just outside off at 90 kph, Webster hangs back and pulls to long-on"
sees the batsman moving across his stumps and then slants the shortish delivery even further outside off. Cut to deep point
"tosses it up outside off, Webster goes right across the line with a sweep and gets an inside edge onto his back pad"
"comes down the track, but he misjudges the pace. It's very slow but he's already halfway down and has nowhere to go. Panics. Swings. Gets an inside edge to long leg"
"hangs back, positions his back leg across outside off, gets low and powers the flatter legspinner through to deep midwicket's right."
another powerful pull from Wells. His timing has been delightful this innings.
"well taken at long leg. Stanlake runs in quite a distance from the boundary, keeping his eyes on the ball all the way, and pouches it with a slide to boot. One of the few shots that Wells mistimes, but that's all the margin a batsman gets. Pays the price for being deceived by the change of pace.  Top bowling from Laughlin"
"'catch it,' they cry again as another slower ball has a batsman swinging for the hills. This time it's to long-on, but as quick as he runs in, he can't get under the ball"
"lovely work. This seems like the legcutter, pitching on a good length, around off stump, pins the new batsman at his crease and has him poking clumsily. Comfortably beaten"
"taken at extra cover. Beautiful over from Laughlin. It's the slower ball again, this time short and well wide of the batsman. That's because Kingston was thinking about the slog, his front leg cleared and his intent clear. All the bowler had to do was make sure the ball was outside of his reach to make him mistime it."
cut away to deep point
"slow and full on off stump, the batsman picks up the variation and nudges it to long leg"
"flights it on middle, drums it down the ground. Beautiful strike from Webster. For once he doesn't slog. Moves his front leg out of the way to make sure the swing of the straight bat can be true and clean"
"swept to the midwicket boundary. That's his fifty, off 36 balls. Picks up the length ball, gets under it, has the room to leverage it almost all the way"
"shortish and outside off, hammers it through cover"
"powers it over the boundary at midwicket, even with Pollard lurking. What a hit! This was so flat. Barely rose 15 feet from the ground."
"another slog sweep, this time straight to Pollard on the deep midwicket boundary"
"comes down the track, but O'Conner does well to loop it outside off seeing Webseter making room outside leg. Jams it down the ground to long-off"
"there she goes, into the second tier at midwicket. It's that mighty slog sweep again, which comes in handy against a bowler who only bowls slower balls. This is on a length and outside off. Webster moves across and launches"
"smacks it through extra cover. Taking big, gasping breaths now. It's been a big innings, but he has to stay there till the end"
"clears his front leg, gets under a slower ball outside off and carves it to the sweeper on the boundary. Webster is forced to run a second"
"that's at his proper pace, at 131 kph, full and wide. Boyce keeps leg side and tries to skew it through point. No luck"
"back to the slower delivery, on middle and leg, Boyce goes for a pull and top-edges it over the wicketkepeer"
"full and wide outside off, drills it to long-off. Webster's 61, it appears, is the highest score by a No. 7 in the Big Bash."
"low full toss on middle, smears it to wide long-on for a couple"
"lands the yorker outside off, Boyce camps on leg stump and tries to chop it through point. He's too slow"
"runs across his stumps, looking to scoop the ball over fine leg, ends up giving Jordan a clear view of all his stumps and the bowler says thank you very much, buh-bye. Boyce was perhaps setting up for a wide yorker, and is surprised by a low full toss on leg"
"full and just outside off, steers it to deep third man"
"cracks it to the point boundary, and despite Stanlake's big, full length dive, he is unable to stop it. Top effort, but there is just too much power in the shot"
"yorker on middle, taps it to long-on for a couple and remains not out on 67. Completes the double and then doubles over at square leg, taking in big gasps"
"smacks it through point. A little short and a little wide, Weatherald sways away from the ball a bit to bring his bat down like a whip"
covers the line of this back of a length delivery at 138 kph and taps it into the covers for a quick single
pokes and misses. This is lovely bowling. Test-match bowling. Angles it into the left-hander on off stump and then jags it away off the seam
how do you handle a swinging ball in T20s? Forget about it and charge at the next one. Takes a back of a length delivery outside off and smears it over long-on
excellent timing again. Waits on the overpitched delivery outside off and splits the gap between the two points. Beautiful batting.
blocks out a 140 kph shortish delivery on middle
"pushes it through on middle and leg, Weatherald nudges it to short fine leg"
"ooh, goes right through him. The left-hander was going back to flick it through midwicket, but he is a touch too quick into the shot, and a little bit of turn takes it past the outside edge"
launches a flighted delivery on off stump to the point boundary. Gets under the ball and powers it away with a square drive.
"dials the slog sweep now with the angle of the ball into him. There's protection at deep midwicket though. Wells, his batting partner earlier does well"
"no reason to have a sighter in T20s. Get the reverse sweep out first ball, and fails to make even the slightest connection. That's the problem with premeditation, a flighted delivery meamt to be driven through the off side becomes a dot"
"lifted over the long-off boundary. Orthodox shots always have a place in cricket and Dunk finds it out this ball, tossed up, with just a little room, dispatched"
"short of a length and outside off, goes for a cut and cannot put bat to ball"
"140 kph length delivery canons into middle! Awful shot from Weatherald, rank slog, going right across the line of a a simple, straight ball and misses it altogether."
"back of a length on middle and leg, Head works it to mid-on's left. Seems to get squared up. Christian might be getting some seam away"
digs it in short but it is allowed to wander harmlessly down leg
"power and placement. He picks the short and wide delivery up early, waits on his back foot and then lets loose to pick the gap to the left of cover and right of mid-off"
"this is quicker, and closer to off stump, Dunk holds firm and glides it to backward point"
"136 kph, good length ball angled across the left-hander, who tries to drill it straight over the non-strikers' head. The ball poofs past the outside edge"
"he puts pace on the ball too. Tossed up on middle, Head lunges forward and launches it straight over the top. Magnificent strike. No risk either, with mid-on and mid-off up"
"shortish and outside off, goes for the cut, but misses out. Perhaps just a touch quicker than he expects"
"moves back on off stump to try and punch the ball past the bowler's right, but Webster puts in a good dive and deflects it to short cover"
"that's well bowled. He makes Head reach outside off, but doesn't let him get to the pitch of it. Head loses control of his drive, because he is into it too early, bottom hand comes off the bat, as he pushes to long-off"
jumps back to a short delivery outside off and slaps it to the right of long-off
"flights it outside off, Dunk leans over the ball and slaps it to the right of long-off again for a couple"
"back of a length on off stump, which cramps Head up as he pats it into the covers with soft hands"
"offcutter, pitches it short though, just short enough that Dunk can back away and spear it through the covers. Super shot. He makes all the pace himself, and he didn't really have too much room to do so"
"puts the slower ball on a fuller length and angles it wider, Dunk is reluctant to come on the front foot, at least he doesn't want to move it across and as a result comes up with nothing with his loft straight down the ground"
"good length ball on middle, unveils a picture perfect straight drive. So straight that it hits the stumps. Deflection allows a single"
"fuller delivery on off stump, drives to mid-off"
"caught at point. It's the slower ball again. Kingston is absolutely delighted at pulling off a little magic trick. It's full, its wide, its inviting and Head takes the bait. Goes for a wristy old lash and mistimes it to, who else, Webster"
"back of a length and outside off, guides it to point off the open face"
"seam movement away and this 128 kph, back of a length delivery beats the outside edge comfortably. Ugly looking slap through cover with no feet whatsoever"
"he likes camping back in his crease. And so even good length deliveries lead to runs. This one has a <i>little</i> width too. Beats Webster, who has looked quite tired, at point"
"pushes it into the covers, that time there wasn't much room to work with and so he has to use a straighter bat"
"change of pace. Good bowling from Christian, as he angles a shortish delivery outside off and deceives Dunk on the cut"
"offcutter, back of a length, Dunk moves back and across and dabs it through mdiwicket."
"flights it outside off, Dunk flat-bats it down to long-off"
"<b>beats him with a beauty</b>. He went wide of the crease, put a little more into his action. This quick, good length ball, pitching on off stump, pinning Hodge to the crease, scampers past the outside edge"
"tosses it up outside off, this is slower through the air, Hodge gets a better sight of it as he drives through cover"
"moves leg side and gets a short ball as a gift. Smacks it through extra cover, and Webster at long-off can't get there in time"
"flighted outside off, drives it to long-off"
"pushes it through on middle and leg, this one does not turn. Seems like the flipper, though I am not perfectly sure. Hodge, hastily, looks to flick, perhaps having not read the ball out of the hand and is hit on his pads. Would have gone down leg though"
"good length ball outside off, slaps it through point"
"good length ball on off stump, taps it into the covers for a quick single"
loops it up wide outside off and Dunk carves it to deep point
"works it through the wide open space at midwicket. Rose strays a touch too straight, with no one protecting the single"
"launches it into the stands at midwicket. A proper slog sweep, with the turn. If only a smidge. This is a length ball, on middle. The batsman gets down on one knee, which has cleared away to make room for the big swing"
"tosses it up outside off, Dunk slices it over the top in front of point"
"tosses it up on leg stump, drives it to long-on and secures a second run too. He's on 49 now"
"well bowled. It's a touch slower, and he makes sure the batsman has to come forward, but can't get to the pitch. Therefore it can turn and therefore it takes the inside edge and not the middle"
slams it to the long-off boundary and that brings up his fifty
"backs away and pulls to deep midwicket. Not entirely short, but he does excellently, moving so deep in his crease to power it away"
"tosses it up outside off, at 80 kph, Hodge comes forward and blocks towards point"
"goes up in appeal for a flighted delivery on leg stump. Hodge seems a likely candidate this ball, having moved across onto off stump and flicking around his front pad. Replays indicate he was hit in line with off stump, and would be crashing into middle"
"that's a wonky one - it's short, it's about four stumps wider than where it should be. Hodge reaches for it as he cuts through point"
"<b>dropped by Broad at cover</b>. He has to dive forward, and to his left, but spills it. It's a slightly shortish delivery outside off, draws Dunk into a backfoot punch, but the ball comes off a lot slower off the pitch than he wants it to"
"shortish and outside off, slices it behind point"
rocks back and cuts to the sweeper
"flighted onto off stump, defends"
on the pads and Hodge clips it through to deep midwicket
"and Hodge just pulverzies it over midwicket. Picks the slower ball, waits on it and then poweres it away with his strong forearms"
drags it short this time and Hodge holds firm on his back foot and clatters it over midwicket. That's massive.
"and Hodge chips it over mid-off. Toying with the field, he is. Runs down the track, making room as well, and lifts it over the man. Even if he mistimes it, if he goes as hard as he can, he was always going to beat him"
lashes it over cover. Strikers are already past 100. Room offered. The length to get under the ball as well. And Hodge goes through with his shot again.
"fuller delivery on off stump, clips it through midwicket"
"good length ball outside off, steers it to point"
that's rank. It's too short. Too wide. And just begs Hodge to hit to the boundary boundary. He's in no mood not to oblige
"pushes it through on middle, clips it to square leg"
"tosses it up on off stump, Hodge works it through midwicket"
"jumps back, picking the short ball, but again it comes off he deck a touch slower than he wants it to. Pulls off the bottom of the bat and it doesn't carry to the midwicket running in"
"tosses it up outside off - giving the batsman room and Dunk exploits it with a slog sweep. Simple carnage. This might have been a decent ball in Tests, but not here"
"that's lovely. He continues to toss the ball up, and this time, the line is a little wider. Dunk, still thinking leg side, slogs and gets a thick outside edge. Doesn't carry to short third man"
looks to just run a good length ball to the third man boundary - with the man standing inside the circle. But Broad's length is too full. So the deflection is a lot finer than Hodge wants. Guides it straight to the keeper.
"full on off stump and Pollard gets off the mark with a text book off drive. That is a cross seamer, in the slot for the big man"
"one-bounce over extra cover. Can only grin at the batsman after getting smacked around two balls in a row. This one was too full, and too wide. Allowed Pollard a free swing of the arms - and he did so with a straight bat. Good batting"
"back of a length and outside off at 137 kph and Pollard is left groping. Cross-seamer seems to beat the batsman for pace. This length can keep Pollard quiet, the short length"
"131 kph, angles a fuller delivery into middle and leg - and it seems to deviate in off the pitch too. Cramps Pollard up properly as he hastily flicks it through midwicket"
"now he squares the batsman up with a shortish delivery outside off, straightening just enough. Outside edge wanders to third man. Started the over poorly, but ends it a lot better"
third four in six balls for Pollard. This too is a silly half-volley on leg stump and a whip of Pollard's wrists takes the ball past deep square leg
"pad first, in front of the stumps, massive shout from the wicketkeeper, the bowler barely looks disinterested, but the umpire gives it. Big call that. This good length delivery pitches outside off and jags back into the right-hander. Pollard tries to defend, but he brings the bat down the wrong line. Pollard looks utterly bemused as he walks off. But that wasn't entirely a bad decision. It's the kind that you get in the age of DRS. Hit on the knee-roll, off you go"
"back of a length on the pads, works it to long leg, off the pads though"
"back of a length and outside off, steers it to deep third man"
"back of a length on off stump, pushes it into the covers"
rises up on his toes to glide a shortish delivery towards point
"back of a length and outside off, guides it to deep third man"
"nicks it! Superb delivery from Broad. It's back of a length, kicking up off the pitch, and this extra bounce is what does Dean. Goes for a forceful back foot drive and mucks it up"
"full on middle, Jordan, Broad's England team-mate brings down a straight bat"
"ducks under a short ball on middle and leg. Good pace too, at 140 kph"
"pushes it down to mid-on and sets off. Beats the direct hit too. Jordan's rapid between the wickets. Meanwhile, Broad, who had dived to his right to try and stop the ball lands awkwardly on his knee. Flexes it a bit before getting up"
"aims a yorker on leg stump, but it becomes a low full toss which Dunk flicks to the long leg boundary. Just a feather touch and Broad's top over is ruined. He walks off with his hands around his mouth. Not quite #Broadface, but there you go"
"length ball outside off, drives it to the right of point"
"short and outside off, Dunk swings it around to long-on. Gets to the non-strikers' and stretches his leg. Pretty warm night, just right for cramps"
"bangs it in short on and around off stump, Jordan lets it carry on to collect the extra"
"back of a length and outside off, steers it towards point"
"slower ball outside off, Dunk waits on it and glides it to deep third man. Singles will do it for the Hurricanes"
"short ball, plenty of room, pulls to deep midwicket"
"full and outside off, drives it to long-off's right"
"full on middle and leg, pushes to mid-on"
"legcutter, which deceives Jordan as he defends with hard hands, with his feet pinned to the crease. Outisde edge through cover. And as he runs through to safety, Broad whacks Jordan on the back of the helmet. All in good fun, of course"
"shortish on middle and leg, drops it down by his feet"
full and down leg as Broad goes around the wicket to Dunk and loses his line. Little offbreak goes awry. Dunk's not pleased that he didn't get a tickle on that for four
"back over the wicket for a short ball on off stump, inside edges it through midwicket"
"shortish and outside off, guides it to deep point"
"goes for a drive through cover, but mistimes it. Finds the single he wants though at point to retain strike"
"superb fielding by Bailey at point, diving to his left to save a run. This short and wide delivery is crashed away by Dunk. Not far enough for his liking"
"digs it in, and it wanders just a hint down leg. Jordan ducks and is happy to see the umpire call wide. Ooh, that's harsh"
"shortish and outside off, chops it down on the cut stripe and runs"
"full and outside off, drives it to long-off"
"back of a length and outside off, spears it through cover. Moves beside the ball just outside off to have the room to hit the gap"
"shortish and outside off, cut to deep point. Wells is fielding down there, wondering perhaps about he futility of his classy fifty earlier in the day"
"oooh, that's top work from Short, running in from the deep point boundary, looking to make something out of almost nothing. Jordan was looking for the boundary when he cut up and over the off side field. Short was the only man on the boundary on that side of the field and he runs in quickly, dives forward to try and make it a catch, but it falls <I>just</i> short. Manages to prevent it from going for four too"
"deceives him with lack of pace. The short ball sits in the pitch, and ducks under the pull shot as well"
"short, smashed and Strikers' seal it much to the joy of their home crowd. This long hop sits up for the pull shot and Jordan exploits it with glee. Soars over mdiwicket and that is that"
