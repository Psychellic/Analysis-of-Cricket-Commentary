"on the hip, tucked to square leg, and a good sharp single to launch the innings. Hales swoops but that was a confident call"
"good length delivery, angled across the left-hander, and driven with exploratory timing to mid-off"
"<B>gone!</B> This one pops off a good length as Munro looks to work one into the leg side. A huge looping leading edge, Buttler calls with the gloves, and England strike early! To be frank, that ball didn't actually do an awful lot, just a poor choice of stroke from a man who's been in a hurry all series"
"outside off, ploughing a furrow, and left alone"
another leave-alone outside off. Decent carry so far
<B>an inside-edged chop past the leg stump!</B> More unsettling bounce from Woakes who finds some nip on a good length. Awkward times for New Zealand already
"width outside off, a loose flash from Williamson, but he can't reach that one"
"that's a decent delivery, a bit of nibble at a decent pace, and Williamson removes his bat from harm's way at the last split-second"
"excellent line once again, and this one zips back into the right-hander a touch. Bounce and lateral movement on offer so far"
<B>spliced through the gully!</B> Fencing outside off as Wood finds extra bounce again. It's a difficult start for New Zealand
"very full from Wood, attacking the top of off as Guptill bides his time"
"inswinger on a good length, and that's a tremendous strike, just a push through mid-on as Guptill uses the bounce to his advantage this time. A good chase at long-on, but not such a good attempt to stop the ball..."
an angled dab into the off side. Interesting times
"pushed onto the back foot, defended to cover"
"banged outside off, and another yawning leave"
"slightly strays onto the leg stump, and jabbed from deep in the crease out to midwicket. Good running to keep the scoreboard ticking"
"good tight lines from Woakes, pushed onto the back foot and pushed to mid-on"
no stroke offered again as Woakes bends this back towards the off stump. Excellent pressure bowling
flicked off the pads this time and Hales gets down quickly at square leg to limit the damage
"good probing bowling, another leave-alone on a tight line"
"still no stroke offered as Wood goes fuller, almost a yorker-length on a fourth-stump line"
"pushed onto the back foot, an attempted forcing flick into the gap on the leg side, but can't find the angle"
"no stroke once again, Williamson happy to soak up the dot-balls, taking in his reconnaissance"
jabbed to midwicket to steal the single
"up onto the toes, tapped to point, and England continue to keep a tight leash on the scoring"
"leaning onto the front foot, pumped down the ground and finds space beyond the inner ring to come back for the third"
"banged in on a back of a length, a touch of outswing, but no temptation to have a slap through the covers"
"wider on the crease, angled into the base of off stump, stabbed into the covers"
deflected to the leg side
"on the back foot once more, pushed to mid-off. England not having to do much more than bowl in good areas at the moment"
another inside-edged cut through fine leg. The extra bounce still causing a few hassles
a rolled-wristed clip through the leg side
"the first sign of aggression from Williamson, as he combats a well-directed short ball with a fast-handed pull. Doesn't connect fully as backward square gathers"
"ooh, well bowled, short and sharp, aiming at the throat and fended away with a combination of glove and helmet, it seems..."
pulled a touch frantically out through the leg side
"flashed into the covers, a touch more intent in these shots, but not yet beating the field"
"tight leg-stump line, rising into the thigh pad and dabbed down into the crease."
"back of a length, angling into the off stump from a wide line, blocked into the leg side"
"stabbed down into the crease, again camped on the back foot as Woakes keeps a tight line"
"another dab into the off side, again on the back foot, Woakes isn't nibbling the ball much, but he's getting consistently awkward lift"
drilled into the covers but without much power. Is his thumb bothering him? Conceivably...
"blocked down into the ground, outside off stump"
"angled into the pads, Hales is once again put to work at square leg, but scrambles down quickly to intercept"
"full length, outside off, no way through there"
"on the pads as Williamson shuffles across to the off side, clipped hard to leg"
"much wider on the crease from Wood, but well directed in towards the off stump. Stoutly blocked to cover"
"squared up by the fuller straighter length, squeezed out to point"
"solidly forward, pushed into the covers"
forward and blocked once more. Another tight over ticks by
"wide on the crease, zeroing in on the stumps, dead-batted out to cover"
"driven, <B>in the air</B> but just wide of Woakes in his followthrough. Early into the stroke, and nearly paid the price"
"fuller, straighter, worked with a whip of the wrists to mid-on. Still can't beat the field"
"probing stuff from Woakes, angling into the off stump once more, Williamson plays so late, dropping the ball into the cordon from under his eyeline"
"flicked off an inside-edge, bobbles in Geoff in Canada: 'This game will. be over by the 10thn over if the Kiwis don't get a move on.'

the air off the thigh pad, but safely out to square leg"
"rare width, and biffed with lots of bottom hand out through point. A long chase and slide from Morgan just inside the boundary, and he does well to limit the damage"
"flicked off the legs once more, slim pickings so far..."
"there we go, <B>a boundary at last!</B> Played it so late with an open face, filleting the gap in the covers and finding just enough timing to reach the rope. Well done"
"clobbered into the covers, but <B>just short of the man</B>. Utterly nailed it, but so nearly holed out. That was more intent, the width was the key"
"<B>wide on the crease, and inside-edged onto the leg stump!</B> Wood's late hop in delivery stride does for the dangerous Williamson. He was looking to run the ball through third man, but his angles were all messed up by the change in line. That's a devastating blow for New Zealand"
flicked off the pads through fine leg
"wide of the crease once more, and a bottom-handed bunt up into the covers"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
"ooh, well bowled, angled across the left-hander and jagging back off the seam. Left alone as the ball scrapes over the off stump"
"leg stump, tucked to backward square"
clipped on the up and <B>just wide of short midwicket!</B> Finds the gap in the end though...
"stretching onto the front foot, drilled into the covers, but snaffled with sharp hands"
"<strong>that's a lovely ball!</strong> Tight to the off stump, grazing past the edge as Latham feels obliged to keep his counsel"
"a bit of a rank loosener from Stokes! Guptill was ecstatic to see that, and freed his arms with glee"
"firmly drilled into the covers once more, but there's a sweeper in place now to intercept the drive"
"on the pads, angled across the left-hander, but tucked into the gap"
"better line from Stokes, tighter and a touch fuller. No stroke this time"
"through the ball zips once more, as Stokes warms to his task with a tight off-stump line"
"rolls the fingers on this one, loops onto a full length, and punched into the covers. After a loose start, Stokes is starting to find his range"
"looking to launch the ball over the covers, doesn't quite get hold of it"
"looped onto a good length outside off, dabbed to point"
"well bowled, a nicely flighted wrong'un on middle and leg, Latham picks it well and pokes to cover"
back of a length but this one slides on as Latham lines up the cut and is a touch hurried in execution
"worked off the legs, another slider"
"bounce on a good length, pushed onto the back foot"
cracked into the covers
"aggression from Stokes, but that's too far over Guptill's shoulder"
"fuller and straighter, dabbed from deep in the crease to short cover"
"on the legs, nudged behind square, they might have lined up the second but for a slip"
"well played this time, a compact drive into the covers from a tight full line"
"clipped to leg, a touch too straight into the pads"
punched into the covers again
"tossed up, and grips a touch as GUptill leans forward to defend"
"slapped from the crease, can't beat the cover fielder"
"nudged off the hip, working with the turn, gathered at backward square"

"leaning forward, blocked into the leg side"
"punched with intent into the covers, just another single"
"a touch over-pitched to start, squeezed to point"
nudged into the leg side as Moeen comes round the wicket
closes the face once more. Midwicket gathers
"up on the toes, punched down the ground to bring up the fifty. A subdued round of applause from the crowd"
"well played, a deliciously late cut, zipping though third man and there's no stopping that"
"another open-faced dab through third man, not quite the same timing but effective all the same"
stabbed into the covers
chopped square
tickled round the corner to backward square
"<strong>there's the breakthrough!</strong> Beautiful flight from Rashid, late dip, a bit of turn, Latham is drawn into a hurried clip into the leg side, and lobs a simple chance to Ben Stokes at mid-on!"
"looped up from over the wicket, tucked towards midwicket"
"pushes through the googler, driven to cover from the crease"
"nicely bowled by Moeen, flighted and the ball spins sharply inside the bat as Guptil aims a cover drive and fails to connect"
"tossed up straight, worked down the ground for one"
"round the wicket, rips off a length <b>and tickles the off bail!</b> Chapman looks flummoxed but it's all over, red rover... Beautiful ball, turn again for Moeen and it skipped past the outside edge to flick the top of the stumps with Chapman squared up and poking at it in vain"
pushed through a tad straighter and worked of the pads to get going

"tossed up, Guptill takes aim and... BOOM! First six of the day, and it's a sweet hit, driven inside out and it sails over wide long-off"
pushed through and dinked for one
"chipped, slightly aerial straight down the ground, mid-off has to cut it off"
"floated up and Guptill goes after it again, skewed low towards cover this time - <b>and has Stokes plucked a peach here?!</b> Guptill is hanging around but Stokes is confident and the <b>soft signal is out</b> from the on-field umpires; is there anything to overrule on the replay? No, looks like it went skimming straight into those big paws, and England have another! Guptill struck it pretty well but it picked out one of the best fielders on the park, big wicket"
"pushed through on off, shows it the forward defensive"
"angled in from round the wicket, tapped away"
"this slides in and clips the inside edge, runs between the batsman's legs"
Nicholls plants the front foot and shows it a straight bat again
tossed up and again met with a front-foot lunge

tossed up and worked off the legs
"angled in on middle and leg stump, De Grandhomme tucks a single through midwicket"
"floated up, the legbreak pitches and straightens, into the front pad... Rashid aborts an appeal, maybe spinning too much"
"flatter, on the pads and clipped to short fine leg"
"floated up full, brings out the sweep again, there's a bit of extra bounce from the googly but <b>the top edge just clears short fine leg running back!</b> Rashid purses his lips and raises an eyebrow"
"tossed up and driven, Rashid dives across to his left to cut it off"
"dragged down a touch, goes to cut and fails to lay bat on it, rebounds out of Buttler's gloves"

tossed up and worked down the ground
"round the wicket, pushed through and defended on off"
angled in and worked to the leg side
"flat, good length, tapped back to the bowler"
"spinning a touch on off, Nicholls drops back and clips a single to long-on"
"over the wicket now, flicked to leg with the spin, short fine leg cleans up"
"lobbed up on middle and leg, worked down the ground"
"pushed through and played delicately, the big man guides a cut through backward point"
"go grand, or go home... and De Grandhom(m)e is doing both! <b>A filthy slog into the pristine Christchurch sky</b> and Tom Curran settles under a straightforward catch after trotting in from long-on. A huge homer but doesn't have the distance and CDG is a goner"

Nicholls shuffles across and pushes into a gap

"swished across the line, hauling the ball from way outside off"
"thumped hard into the covers, can't beat the fielder"

crushed into the covers
"slightly more round-arm in delivery, quicker and flatter, and cautiously fended away"
"outside off, pushed on the up into the covers"

"tip and run to mid-off, and a direct hit pings off the non-striker's bails! They are going upstairs, but this is pretty clear-cut. On we go"
"whirling away on a very full, blockhole-targetting length, chiselled into the off side"
poked into the off side

"how on earth is that not a wide? Miles outside off, and the batsman seemed to retreat to leg before hand. Most curious"

"anchored on the back foot, pushed to point"
clipped off the pads
"back of a length, a slower ball again, a horrid round-house hoick, and <strong>it's another top-edge!</strong> But this time Root at mid-on can't sprawl round to gather"
"<B>a direct hit from long-off!</B> This could be tight... nah, he's safely home. An initial over-throw lured them back for the second run, but all's well that ends well"
"another slower ball outside off, slapped off a cue-end to deep cover"
"low full toss, and <B>pumped down the ground!</B> Up comes the half century as Stokes flings himself in vain to try to cut off the four. He's rather winded himself as he lands ... actually, it's his back that he's feeling. That's not ideal"

"smashed hard into the leg side, flashing the wrists through the line of the ball, and past Wood at short midwicket."
"cracked to point and <B>dropped by Moeen!</B> That was a gimme, straight into the breadbasket... whoops. Can Santner make England pay?"
"well bowled, ignoring Southee's contortions in his stance, and rolling a slower-ball ducker past an ambitious flick to leg"
"hauled to leg, lots of bottom hand, but New Zealand kept quiet. Should have been a wicket, mind..."
"flogged through the line, getting himself outside off and pre-empting Curran's line. Top batting"
"full length once more, eased up the pitch"
"yahoo! Swinging from the hip, through the presumed line of the ball, but doesn't connect"
"no quibbles with that stroke! Santner picks this one alright, an attempted slower ball that comes out as a full toss, and it's battered hard and flat over the leg side"
flicked into the leg side again
"outside off, crushed square, but only as far as the sweeper. England just in danger of leaking themselves a stiff target, where at one stage they might have been envisaging less than 200"
"banged in short, and smashed hard out to deep midwicket ... slightly top-edged, Hales circles, and <B>clings onto a brilliant effort!</B> That wasn't easy, he had to make good ground, the ball was dying on him all the time, and he scooped it low to his right with a tumble. He's not the sharpest of England's fielders, but he did well there"
"width outside off, too much width"
"<B>what a stunning take!</B> A slower ball long-hop from Woakes, Southee picked it well enough, thumped it hard and flat towards the midwicket fence, but Bairstow swoops round, one-handed, plucking it out of the air with his best Superman impression! It was the speed that made that special, nothing but a perfectly timed dive would do! And he had to be mindful of tumbling over the rope too. Unbelievably good"
"beaten outside off stump, well bowled, on a tight line"
"slower ball, full length, nudged to the leg side"
"squeezed on a full length, off inside edge and front pad"
"slower ball, down the leg side once more"

"full and straight, punched down to long-off"
"slower ball, following the right-hander as he attempted to give himself room on the leg side. Worked square"
"a rank leg-side long-hop. Looked like a back-of-the-hander, but went awry"
"heave ho! Smashed hard out to deep midwicket, and <B>Root drops it!</B> Probably over-shot the ball in his eagerness and couldn't recover his poise"
"right up to the toes, dug out back to the bowler"
"all over Red Rover! Smashing across the line, off a full length, got a lot of bat on the shot, but Curran had taken the pace off the ball, and Stokes at deep midwicket makes no mistake with fingers pointed skywards"
"touch back of a length, 129kph but holding its line a touch as Bairstow plays back and defends"
angled in and worked down into the leg side

"good pace and carry outside off, 136kph and left alone as he steps out"
"Southee darts out wide and arrows the ball in, defended coming across"
"over the wicket, slightly back of a length and pushed across outside off, Hales rocks back and blocks"

"fired across the bows, 137kph but quite wide and he leaves it well alone"
"length, Hales hacks hard and gets a thick outside edge down to third man for a single"
"fullish, 139kph in the channel, YJB steps on to the front foot and shoulders arms"
"beautifully bowled, full and nibbling away a fraction as Hales lets it go. Nothing but grief on offer to the batsman there"
drifts a little too straight and Hales clips him off the pads for one
"short of a length, 135kph around off stump, Bairstow shows it a straight bat"
"full on the stumps, short-arm punch through midwicket from YJB, picks up a couple"
"touch short and this is thumped on the pull, square leg gets a hand on it to keep them to one"
Hales comes across on off and pats it away
"short, 138kph but it's a little off target again and Bairstow times a square cut like a Swiss watchmaker for four"
"length ball, again a little width there, no swing and Bairstow raps it in front of point stepping across, picks up a couple more"
"goes round the wicket, trying to push the ball away on a length, tapped towards mid-off"
"short ball, angled into the body and Bairstow can't get bat on it trying to pull but they run anyway"
"pitched up, Hales doesn't bother to move his feet, just pumps the ball through cover point - four more!"
"full, tailing in, Hales chops it through his legs via the inside edge"
"fullish, outside off and YJB thrashes it to point on the bounce"
"drops short, pulled firmly through square for a single"
"plenty dobbly but not much wobbly so far, Hales hangs back and taps to leg"
"full, 127kph but sliding on to the pads and Hales just fillets it down to fine leg up for a boundary, thankyouplease!"
lets this one through outside off
"ooh, not far off from diverting the ball into his stumps, an extravagant drive from Hales and the ball ends up at short fine leg"
"bit of room to swing the arms and Bairstow cracks a cut, but Chapman does terrifically to leap and cut it off at point"
"pitched up and creamed through extra cover on the up, princely shot-making but it won't quite go all the way"
"touch short, 141kph angling across, slashed down to third man for one"
"banged in, flying through as YJB hangs back and lets it go over his head"
"pushed across from over the wicket, defended towards gully"
"dug in, 135kph/83mph and the ball sits up, Bairstow swats a pull past square leg for a couple"
"oh, that's dismissive... touch overpitched and YJB just leans into a bottom-handed belt back down the ground, bounds away for four"
"pushed into the pads with the arm, deflected square"
pitched up and tapped into the covers coming across
"length but straying on to the pads again, Hales clunks it past backward square leg for another boundary"
shuffles into line and lets it go
"medium-dobbers, 125kph on off stump, patted away"
pitched up and Hales plinks a drive towards extra cover
"short outside off, taken on the body as he attempts to pull"
back of a length outside off and guided down to third man coming across
"short, wide and <i>hammered</i> through backward point, beats the despairing dive and rattles to the fence once again"
"touch short, 135kph and it thuds into the pads, Southee is bellowing for the lbw... but it looked high? Hales took it on the thigh pad, and it's caused some pain"
comes across and plays a length ball down square
"length ball, aiming for the top of off, Hales shows it a straight bat in defence"
"short and a touch leg side, clipped away for four more... and there's polite applause for <b>the England 50</b>, which has come at almost exactly a run a ball"
"length, again on the pads and Bairstow wastes little time in creaming it away through midwicket for another boundary - again the locals politely show their appreciation"
"length ball, 126kph and tapped away"
"pitched up and <b>drilled back over the bowler's head for six!</b> A regal blow down the ground, YJB opening up his shoulders and dumping CDG into the crowd"
sliding in to the body and worked for one
again he gets too straight and Hales clips him off the legs
"ooh, slips this past the inside edge, rising off a length in the channel"
"tight lines, 135kph and there's decent carry, but no swing as Hales comes across and leaves alone"
"good length on off stump, prodded into the covers"
"goes a bit straighter, punched towards mid-on"
"touch short outside off, dabbed square from the crease"
"fullish, 136kph in the channel, Hales shifts on to the front foot and picks out mid-off - that's a maiden from Southee, though it already feels like too little too late"
"floated up and it's <i>absolutely battered</i> over cover, YJB launching his first ball from the left-armer to the rope with disdain"
lobbed up and poked through the off side along the carpet for one
darted in straight and Hales defends in front of the stumps
"lobbed up and blocked to the on side, Santner goes across to field"
"swept off leg stump, Hales takes him for a boundary now, powered away behind square"
"lobbed up full on the stumps, turned into the leg side"
"flighted, around middle and leg, Bairstow scoots out and chips one down the ground"
"pushed through outside off, Hales cuts one off the back foot"
"floated up nice and full Bairstow drives to the sweeper, in the air for a bit and the ball then spins in front of the sweeper, allowing YJB to hare back for a second"
"pushed through fuller on the stumps, defended"
"tosses up the legbreak, opens the face and runs to short third man"
"tossed up and spinning away, YJB leaves it be"
"ooh, this pops a little, hits the shoulder of the bat but plops safely away square on the off side"
angled in and flicked through the leg side
"worked into a gap, turning over the strike"
"flat delivery on middle and leg, nudged towards midwicket"
"dabbed into the covers, tip and run and they scamper through"
flat and quick and running behind square off the inside edge of the bat
"flighted, Bairstow leans on a little nudge square and they trot through, <b>that'll be fifty for Yorkshire's Jonny Bairstow</b> - indisputably in form now"
"nicely bowled, bit of turn and bounce as it slips through to the keeper"
tossed up and Hales prods at it unconvincingly
"pushes through the googly and, although Hales doesn't seem to pick it, they pick up three via a deflection off the pads"
"flighted, around off stump, tapped into a gap"
"shouts of 'catch!' as Hales sweeps in the air, but it won't carry all the way to deep square leg"
pushed through and steered square for a single
"tossed up on off, driven for one more in front of point"
gets a bit stride in and smothers the ball
"slightly quicker, tapped away playing back"
"lobbed up straight and Hales sweeps, gets it off the top edge but the ball safely clears short fine leg and they get a couple as Sodhi trundles after it"
"flighted, defended towards extra cover"
"rolls the arm over, full outside off and pushed square for one"
dragged down slightly and Hales cuts one more through point
"<b>into the bleachers!</b> Hitting against the spin but Bairstow is seeing it big, down on one knee and crumped into the crowd... where again the chance of a $50,000 catch goes begging!"
"goes again, <b>smashed over deep midwicket!</b> Bit of a drag-down and YJB rocks back to muller it into the picket fence"
comes forward and dinks down the ground
"floated up outside off, Hales leans on to the front foot and pierces the infield for a couple"
"nice and slow, driven down the ground from on leg stump"
"tossed up, again giving it some air and the ball bounces up to hit the splice"
"gets a touch straight and it's worked away square, into a gap for a couple"
"pushed through, defended back down the track"
"floated up outside off, stroked towards extra cover"
"quicker delivery from Santner, 94kph as Hales hops back and stabs the ball away"
"tossed up and driven, bobbles up on the spare pitch and beats the dive of the man at extra cover for a couple"
"floated up full and <b>Bairstow slams another maximum into the grass banks!</b> More tap for the bowler, and again it doesn't go to hand among the orange shirts"
"six more, blootered down the ground this time! Pushed through flatter but YJB still manages to get under it and lever the ball into the sightscreen"
"drops short, pulled into the leg side and they come back for two"
"CARNAGE! Full, in the slot, <b>YJB spanks it over long-on for a third six in the over!</b> Brutal, disdainful, painful -
 for the bowler and the gaggle of men in the crowd colliding with each other while trying to catch the ball"
"oh, nicely bowled, beats the bat to finish... That's what trying to play orthodox defensive shots gets you"
"short of a length, Hales ticks over with a pull for one"
"short and angled across, YJB leans back and misses with an attempted ramp"
angled across and Bairstow cuts a couple through point off the back foot
"dug in short, climbing through over the batsman"
"Boult keeps hitting the middle of the pitch, and Bairstow keeps hitting the boundary boards... Swatted around the corner on the pull, bounces away for four this time"
"better length, defended around off stump"
"short, again it boings through, too high for the umpire's liking"
"pitched up, YJB aims a slug down the ground, mistimed towards mid-on"
"tight wicket-to-wicket line, met on the back foot with a vertical bat"
"a touch of width outside off, dabbed through third man to rotate the strike"
"back of a length, hauled with power through backward square, and that's simple pickings. 99 ..."
"on the back foot, tucked down to third man, and Bairstow allows himself a quiet pump of the fist even before he sets off for the single. What a flying knock it's been!"
cracked hard through backward point
"outside off, and smashed hard to point. Just coming onto the bat nicely"
"kapow! Gives himself room on the back foot, smites the bat through the line like a claymore, and that's another monstrous boundary"
"gives himself too much room this time, and <B>Bairstow has smashed his own stumps!</B> He sized up the cut shot, but hammered his bat into his leg stump. You don't see that every day, least of all after such a brilliant innings"
"back of a length, Root rides the bounce and deflects through third man"
"bashed off the back foot, out into the covers"
back and across to defend into the leg side
"banged in short, and ducked"
"tweaked onto the leg stump, Root wants the single but Hales screams a loud 'no!' Had to scamper but made it home safely enough"
swept very effectively. Four more to the total as Hales closes in on his fifty
pushed onto the back foot and defended back down the pitch
"width outside off, Hales leans back for a cut, a bit outside-edgy but that races away, and up comes a very good fifty. He's been second fiddle for much of this innings, but no less important for that"
dabbed back to the bowler
"a yawning drive into the covers, another effective over as England move in for the kill"
nurdled out to the cover sweeper
pushed onto the back foot and blocked down into the crease
"full length, eased into the leg side with a well-timed roll of the wrists. No-one at mid-on so they return for the third"

onto the front foot to defend
"stands tall on the back foot, pushed back down the pitch"

big stride forward and pushed back past the bowler
"hurried on the back foot, flatter and faster, and defended"
"an expansive drive this time, opening the face and drilling through the covers"
"<B>smashed to midwicket!</B> Hales lines up the slog sweep, but picks out Williamson who wraps his fingers round a fizzing chance, and New Zealand have the beginnings of a sniff as the openers depart"
"outside off, short ball, through to the keeper"
"banged in short again, Root swivels into a pull and settles for the single to the midwicket sweeper"
"nudged in the air for a moment, off the pads and out through midwicket"
"beautifully struck, rising onto the toes, rolling the wrists, and slamming a pull in front of square"
"short, and through to the keeper"
"another short ball, another pull, top-edged a touch, but well short of fine leg, who gathered on the bounce to limit the damage to a single"
stabbed into the covers
"looped up outside off, Root doesn't really get to the pitch of the ball, but slaps hard through the off side, up and over the fielder and away to deep backward point"
"ambitious appeal as Santner raps Morgan's pads, but it was turning and bouncing. Not much value in a review"
"leaning forward, an inside edge onto the pads this time"
forward and pushed to the off side
"well bowled, round the wicket, luring the batsman forward, blocked into the off side"
"slapped with insolence over the covers, as Morgan reverses the hands and paddy-whacks a looping top-edge past the fielder"
more conventionally forward
"a swishing sweep, picking the length early and slamming it through the leg side"
"<B>brilliant catch on the boundary's edge!</B> Sodhi dropped it short, Morgan snatched at his pull and de Grandhomme circled well inside the rope, clinging on with two hands and keeping his shape to avoid tumbling onto the rope. It's still unlikely to change anything, but all New Zealand can do is take wickets"
poked into the off side
"back of a length, Root waits for the legbreak to bite, then dabs with the spin through third man. Subtle use of the angles"
"outside off, nudged behind point"
"shuffling feet at the crease, as Root slides himself into position to punch very square through point"
"round the wicket, defended into the leg side"
"on the toes, clipped out through midwicket, easy pickings"
"pushed onto the back foot, worked square as Root moves back and across to get behind the line"

nudged into the covers
"googly, punched on the up through the covers"
tossed up on off stump and defended
"on the pads, working the singles, ticking down the requirement"
"a swishing pull, out to deep midwicket"
"whoosh! Stokes gets underneath this one, a bit of air outside off, he drops to one knee, and slams a massive six way back onto the banks at long-on. England are into the 200s"
dabbed into the off side
"outside off, chopped into the covers"
"lots of air on leg stump, Stokes' eyes lit up for a moment, but it dipped late and he adjusted accordingly"
clipped to the leg side
"onto the front foot, tapped to point"
"finds the gap in the covers, and England are all but home"
"outside off, poked to point"
"down the track, meeting this one on the full, and chiselling another single to wide long-on"
"dropped a touch short outside off, cut out to cover"
"pushed onto the back foot, defended to the leg side"
"late cut, gathered well at backward point, but another single chipped off the total"
"makes room for a smash through the covers, but toe-ends his shot a touch. A long chase to haul it in"
"fully forward, blocked to the off side"
"on the legs, no wild swipe just yet, just another single off the hips to midwicket"
"flicked around the corner, another sharp single as Sodhi gathers at backward square leg but can't get his shy in in time"
tucked to the leg side
"head over the ball, punched into the covers, Santner's making England wait"
"up on the toes, trying to force his way through the covers, the end of a tidy spell in uncompromising circumstances"
"<B>toe-ended to point, and dropped!</B> Oh dear, that's a horror show. Down it goes, and Stokes looks suitably bashful"
"another hoick off a good length, another chance, <B>another drop!</B> Chapman rushing back at mid-off, can't get his bearings in time"
scores level...
"high and mighty, onto the grassy banks at cow corner, and <B>England claim the spoils!</B>"
