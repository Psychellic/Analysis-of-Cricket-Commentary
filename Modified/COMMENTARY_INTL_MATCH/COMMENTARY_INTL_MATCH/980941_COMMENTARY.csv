"nice start from Sandeep. A loopy inswinger to start, bringing it back from outside off to off. Rohit has so much time to stay in his crease and defend"
"Rohit nicks off and Kings XI have an awesome start. Rohit is disappointed, more in frustration than anything. Shortish and wide, but the inswinger comes back in. Rohit tries to lace a cut through point but gets a thin edge through to the keeper. No hesitation anywhere. The umpire quickly raises the finger"
"a good length outside off, brings this one back in again. Rayudu steers a tap to third man."
"good lines these. Good length outside off, swinging away. Significant movement. parthiv pushes to cover from the crease, minimal feet movement. Excellent start"
"good length outside off, same direction of movement. parthiv chops into the surface towards point"
"a tad too straight this time, on Parthiv's hips. But he still can't connect with a routine flick. Off the thigh pad, towards square leg for one"
"very straight, Parthiv gets an inside edge that saves him. Full on off, Parthiv looks to drag the nudge but can't do so adequately. Lucky he got some bat on that"
"shot! Wonderful timing. Full again, outside off, sixth-stump line. Parthiv strides forward, quite a tiny stride, but times the punchy cover drive past cover. Awesome stuff"
"a shot fraught with risk. But Parthiv executes it. Full on off, similar to the first ball. But he goes through with the flick and connects. Goes very fine, past the keeper and short fine leg"
"excellent batting. Wonderful response from Johnson. Good length on off, Parthiv drops his hands and pats it towards point with soft hands. Rayudu calls him through"
"well bowled. Back of a length, more a length we have been accustomed to, on leg. Aimed at rayudu's ribs. He awkwardly gets to the delivery to play away"
oh lovely. The Test match trick. A short delivery followed by a full one outside off. Rayudu's feet are not quite to the pitch. He attempts a drive but the ball swings past the edge
good length outside off at 135 kph. Another punchy drive to mid-off
tighter line. Closer to that off bail on a good length. Exemplary stuff. Worked away to mid-on
"not a great delivery, especially to Parthiv. Short and wide, there to be put away for four. He thrashes a cut but finds extra cover"
"better from Sandeep. Honing in on that off stump on a good length, Parthiv stands tall and punches past cover for a couple. good timing"
"superb change in length. Shortens the length, a 135 kph bouncer on off. Parthiv is taken aback by the variation and sways away."
"sweetly timed. Closer to middle and tucked with use of the wrists, to midwicket."
"he won't spin too many. Full outside off, skids on nicely to the bat. Driven to long-off"
"a bit of flight on leg, worked away to deep midwicket"
"nicely bowled, 93 kph. Outside off, Rayudu looks to loft a drive over cover but the skiddy nature of the new ball means Rayudu inside-edges to square leg"
nurdled to square leg
"quite full, still no flight. Parthiv runs to the pitch and mis-times a lofted drive to mid-off. One"
"101 kph, flat on middle and leg. Played with the angle to square leg, who fumbles while diving"
"superb lines from Sandeep today. Very close to off, Rayudu opens the face of the bat to glide to third man"
"just short of Vijay at short midwicket. Good length on off, not short enough for that stroke but Parthiv attempts a pull. Mis-times it again and is lucky he did"
"changes the length again, goes short outside off. Parthiv is too early through the pull. Slower bouncer maybe? 127 kph."
"clobbers the pull this time, straight to deep square leg. Back of a length on off, allowing Parthiv that length for the stroke"
"did not look like he got enough on it, but he did. Dug in on off, Rayudu shimmies down but Sandeep, cleverly, bangs it in. Rayudu forehands the length over the bowler, on the bounce to the long-on boundary"
"good length on off to finish. Tapped to wide point for one, good run. But decent over too."
"nicely executed from rayudu. Full on off from Johnson, Rayudu backs away a touch and lofts the drive over mid-on. Not great timing but enough to get to the boundary"
"easy run with all the fielders on the circle. Fullish outside off, pushed to cover."
"straight to the man at deep square leg. Holes out. Back of a length, at least to Parthiv it was. That is a length he has been increasingly accustomed to over the years. He is quick on the pull and smashes it off the middle. The umpires ask Parthiv to hang around. And he has overstepped by a few inches. Uh oh, how many of these have not been called before?"
"good change in pace on off, slower delivery. Parthiv is through the shot too early and lobs a catch to midwicket"
"four this time. 125 kph, on middle and leg. Parthiv gets inside the line this time and rolls his wrists on the pull. Past short fine leg"
"another slower delivery and four more. Poor line. On leg and Parthiv just helps it along, all the way to the backward square leg boundary. The square leg fielder should have been finer for Parthiv"
"better adjustment. Outside off on a full length, Parthiv steers to backward point where Maxwell puts in a run-saving dive, eliciting wild cheers from the sparse crowd"
"129 kph. Good length on off, dabbed to third man off the open face"
tight run. Tapped to point and both set off immediately. Shaun Marsh gets a good bounce but can't hit the stumps at the batsman's end
another deft dab to third man for one
"intentionally played, and well played too. But what is Mohit doing bowling that line? Full and wide, Parthiv opens the face to steer the ball past short third man"
"loopy bouncer, well over Parthiv Patel. Doesn't take much to get the ball over his head, Mohit has got to do better"
"better. Fullish on middle, worked to deep midwicket"
"tight on off, glided to backward point"
"nice start. Slowish outside off, not much turn. Dabbed to point with soft hands"
"82 kph, good length on middle, not much loop, nit much spin. Pushed to deep midwicket easily"
there is some flight. Rayudu shimmies down and yorks himself. Jams to cover
"over long-on. Good use of the feet from rayudu. Races to the pitch, gets there and lofts the loopy delivery way over long-on. Not great timing but enough again. Good batting"
"worked away to wide long-on, well placed and two more"
"nothing shot. Flat and wide outside off, bunted uppishly to the sweeper cover"
"poor delivery to start. Rank long hop outside off, swatted to long-on for one"
"too short again on middle, Parthiv rocks back but crashes a mis-timed pull to square leg"
"flat, short, wide. This is put away. Sahu's awful beginning results in a boundary. At last. Rayudu laces a cut past point, easy offering"
oh no. <strong>Dropped</strong>. An absolute sitter at this level. Axar is the culprit. Full for the first time and he generates an opportunity. Raydu mis-times his sweep to deep midwicket. Axar gets to the ball but puts it down. A big no-no
played away to midwicket with the spin
"a bit of width outside off, slapped to the sweeper cover"
"flat on middle, and full. Rayudu was shaping to sweep again, but improvises with a drive to long-off"
"gone this time? Flat and quick outside off, Parthiv premeditates and comes out for a drive over cover. But misses. Nikhil Naik takes the bails off quite quickly, but Parthiv gets his back foot back just in time. Very marginal this. The third umpire is taking his time. Parthiv was walking back but stops, finally. And rightly so, because it looks like there is just a smidgen behind. Parthiv is safe, again."
"short and wide, hammered to deep cover"
"full on off, no flight. No turn. Belted down to long-off, just one"
"lucky runs. Drifts outside off and Parthiv looks for another muscular drive through cover, but he gets a thick outside edge which races away past short third man."
"very flat, very quick on middle and leg. Clipped to midwicket"
"floated up on leg, worked to long-on. Wanted two but Mohit was quick on it. Good fielding"
"good stop from the bowler this time. Flat on off, worked towards the non-striker. Sahu puts his body on the line and ensures it doesn't go through"
"flat outside off, a big heave but a thick edge to short fine leg. Ugly"
slightly short and Parthiv picks the length early. Hurries back to pull to deep midwicet
"another rather ugly hoick. Flat on off, may have been a quicker variation. Flat-batted to long-on"
"six this time. Bonus time says Parthiv. He comes down, doesn't get anywhere near the pitch but trusts the bounce and goes for a lofted flick. Gets so much behind it that it sails over long-on. fantastic timing"
"gets to the pitch this time and another straight six. Good batting from rayudu. Turning it on. Runs down to the pitch, a clean golf swing takes the ball over long-on"
"four more. Really good batting. Shimmies down, gets a similarly full delivery and drives over cover for four"
pushed quietly to long-off. Another fifty for Rayudu
"very quick and flat down leg, off the pad to short fine leg, says the umpire"
"flat down leg, chipped to midwicket"
"flat and quick outside off, skewed to deep cover. Mumbai accelerating."
"an uppish flick over midwicket for two. Good batting. Backed away, did not get the ball he wanted but still found some runs"
"no timing at all, but he gets to fifty in the most ungainliest of ways. Walks across and bunts a flick on the bounce to deep square leg. Did not look too pretty on that delivery"
"good yorker. Full and wide, rayudu scythes but an inside edge back up the pitch"
"good call from the umpire. Full and quick, just past leg stump. Parthiv shuffles across and tries to ramp, but misses. Getting increasingly uglier"
"this is too wide, down leg. Parthiv misses a flick"
"nice, well played. Backs away and punches a well-timed drive on the up, just past mid-off. Picked his spot well"
"lovely. Backs away again, makes some room and lofts the cover drive over cover. On the bounce and over the boundary. Runs coming too easily suddenly"
"offcutter on off, 125 kph. Steered to point"
"superb shot from Parthiv, making the most of his opportunities. Full and wide, bludgeoned away past cover for four. Exemplary placement as well, just wide of cover."
"slower ball, completely deceives Parthiv who is way too early through the pull."
"lovely placement. This is beautiful batting. Fullish and straight, knew of a gap over midwicket. Picked up the length early and heaves the ball over midwicket. Nine off this over"
"dropped. Good effort from mid-off, backtracking. Mohit Sharma the man. Fullish outside off, Parthiv bunts a lofted drive, looks like it has enough to clear the fielder but Mohit sticks out his right arm, and it almost sticks in until it pops out. May have done some damage to himself"
"full and straight, Parthiv misses a flick. A muted appeal but not given"
"lovely from Rayudu, turning it on. No need for Jos, no nee for Pollard. Flat and wide outside off, Rayudu gets on one knee and flat-bats it over the bowler. Six more"
"six more. Too full, in rayudu's arc and he goes after it. Gets enough on the flat-batted heave to clear long-on."
"gets him this time. How big will this prove? Flat again outside off, Rayudu was persistent on the sweep and mis-times this because hew has to drag it from outside off. To deep midwicket and this time it is taken. Great knock."
"flat on leg, nudged to deep midwicket"
"fired in on middle and leg, Buttler clips to midwicket to get off the mark"
another flat delivery to finish his spell. Tickled to midwicket
"awful delivery. A loopy full toss on leg stump, what do you expect? parthiv comes down and swipes the ball into the stands over deep square leg."
"better, because he forces the tiring Parthiv to hit down the ground. Googly on middle, chipped to long-off"
"what a shot from Jos. A rank long hop outside off, Buttler stays in his crease and crunches the pull with enviable ease, over long-on. Made it look so easy. This could be a huge score looming"
"flat and full outside off, drilled to long-off"
"yorker outside off, jammed to point. Marsh comes down on it and lets it go through. There was no run on offer but he concedes one"
"nicely tossed up on middle, driven with the spin to long-off."
"full and wide outside off, even that is in Buttler's arc. But he taps it back to the  bowler"
"superb from Buttler. Years of practice of this kind of batting from Buttler. Looking for the ramp over fine leg but Sandeep bowls it full and wide, he gets his bat to it and scoops it over the slip region. Sensational"
"good comeback. Yorker on off, and all Buttler can do is tap it back"
"short and wide, way too wide. Buttler doesn't bother with it. Wide called"
"good delivery. Intentionally looking for that wide tramline outside off, rather just inside that line. Buttler reaches out and mis-times his drive to cover."
"yikes, slower delivery down leg, May have been wide had Parthiv ignored his attempted flick past short fine leg. Toe-ends it to midwicket instead"
"looking for that yorker outside off, scythed away to deep point. If Maxwell can't prevent two, not many could've"
yorker outside off. Parthiv shuffles across and shovels a drive to long-on. Not bad to get Buttler on strike
"not great captaincy from Miller. Cannot have fine leg up to this man. Fullish outside off, that isn't a bad delivery actually, but Buttler has such good hands that all he needs to do is get across to the line. He gets there and uses his hands to scoop the ball over short fine leg"
"and again. Not a bad delivery again, the slower delivery out of the back of the hand. But Buttler shuffles across, shapes for the ramp, waits for the slower ball to come to him before helping it along over the keeper. Easy."
"ooh, <strong>Buttler misses an innovative shot</strong>. Full and wide outside off, Buttler stays where he is, doesn't bother moving his feet and reverse sweeps but misses. Dot ball"
"excellent delivery. In all fairness, this has not been a bad over. Another back of the hand slower ball on middle, Buttler looks for a heave over midwicket but misses completely. Since it is straight, the stumps are clattered. Buttler's impressive cameo ends."
"another slower one to finish. Chipped past the bowler, to mid-on. Pollard hurtles back for two. Two completely different strides but they make it"
smeared past the bowler. Mid-off runs around to keep it in. Fullish from Johnson and straight
"short and quick from Johnson. Good option to Pollard. Hustled for pace, pollard pulls but gets a thick top edge which lands in front of a fine third man, running around."
"slower ball on leg, nudged to fine leg"
"<strong>caught. Finally. Parthiv goes. Finally. </strong>But a classy innings from Parthiv. Wonderful bouncer from Johnson, quick and well directed. Parthiv backs away and lobs the bouncer to point with a horribly-executed cut. Can't do much with Johnson's pace though. Quality innings, his highest IPL score"
"132 kph, back of a length on middle, swatted to deep square leg"
"smashes past cover for four. Off the first ball, off Mitchell Johnson. That will improve Pandya's CV. Full and quick, Pandya drills the drive for four"
"slower delivery again, back of the hand, uppishly flicked to square leg, in front of him"
"another slower delivery on off, Pollard purposefully works to midwicket with soft hands for two."
"excellent yorker on off, jammed back to the non-striker's stumps. Uproots out a stump and Pollard refuses the run"
"whoa, mighty swing but Pollard was done, all ends up. The slower ball just misses off stump. Another impressive dot ball"
"lovely bowling this. Very good bowling. Another slower delivery outside off, and Pollard is through the heave too early. A thick leading edge is comfortably taken by short third man. Another stuttering innings from Pollard"
"two in two for Mohit. Another slower delivery gets a wicket. Pandya looks for a mow over midwicket. Doesn't get much on it, a top edge is taken by Miller, running in from cover I presume. Another superb last over from Mohit, he did the same against Supergiants."
"good length on off, a hint of away shape. Vijay strides forward to block"
"quite close to off on a back of a length, 136 kph. Vijay is prevented from prodding forward. Tapped to point"
"<strong>another drop. </strong>Fullish length on leg, Vijay looks to flick but a big of away shape leads in a leading edge towards mid-on. Krunal backtracks and stretches his arms up, but cannot hold on"
"good length again, around off. Blocked"
"slightly wider of the crease outside off, full and swinging away. Vohra presses forward in defense"
"full and wide, there to be driven. Vohra loosely pokes away from his body and gets an under edge towards Harbhajan at slip. Parthiv gets in his way. The ball is stopped but Harbhajan may have done some damage"
oh man. What a shot that is. Picked up over midwicket. Quite full on off and Vijay doesn't bother moving his feet. Uses some wristy power to whip uppishly for four
"fullish on off, stylishly driven to cover."
"back of a length outside off, shortish length. Moves away late. Vijay doesn't bother playing a stroke as it is quite wide outside off"
"slower delivery, offcutter. Bunted to extra cover, Vijay called Vohra through before sending him back in time"
"poor delivery. Another offcutter but straying down leg, Vijay helps it on its way, past short fine leg for four easy runs"
"whew, what timing. What a crucnhing sound of the bat. Good length on middle and leg, Vijay backs away and hammers the drive to cover, bursts through the hand understandably"
"direct hit from Buttler. Mumbai are celebrating, has Vijay made his ground? Vijay pushes a length delivery to extra cover and sets off for a quick run. Vijay has just made his ground, excellently judged single."
"back of a length and straight, nurdled off his hips towards square leg"
"good length on middle, swatted away towards wide mid-on, who has to hustle across to cut it in. Does so"
"another pick-up stroke for six. Easily done by Vijay. Good length on leg, straying in line. Allowing Vijay to see it early and whip it away. Over square leg for a massive six"
"gone this time. Vijay looks for another but has to go now. Shortens his length, takes some pace off the ball, and bowls it wider outside off. Vijay advances and goes through with a flat-batted stroke but ends up eop-edging it towards point. Hangs there for a while before Buttler settles under it. Good take."
"good length on leg, worked away to deep square leg. Successful over for Mumbai, they should get ahead if they keep chipping away."
"full, too full, outside off. Vohra looks to loft the half-volley but gets a thick outside edge to third man."
"good run, tip and sets off. Rather full but close to off, Marsh drives to cover and makes the single with ease"
"yorker outside off, skewed off to third man"
"superb shot. Fractionally short on off, and Marsh picks up the length so quickly. Swats the pull through midwicket"
"shortish and wide outside off, chopped to slip where Pollard gets across with a dive, may have saved at least a run"
"slow shortish delivery on middle, pulled away with disdain to square leg. Doesn't time it too well though"
"132 kph to start from Bumrah. That tight action, from wide of the crease, on middle and leg with the angle. Whipped to square leg"
"slower delivery from around the wicket, 111 kph. Tapped to point for a quick run"
"better line. Back of a length but starts it off a little wider outside off. Jags back in to off, steered to point"
"131 kph, short on middle and leg, marsh is hurried through his pull to square leg"
"poor shot. A nothing stroke. Did not bother keeping it down, or clearing the infield. Good length outside off, width. Vohra stays in his crease and cuts straight to extra cover. Could have done a lot more with that"
"naughty full toss on middle, pushed to mid-on for a quick and easy run to get off the mark"
full and straight. Lots of hands in heads. Could have got a lot worse for Kings XI. Maxwell shuffled across and almost played around his front pad. Somehow got some bat on it
"lovely change-up from Tim S. A well-directed bouncer on middle, Maxwell backs away and sways away. May have cut-pulled that over point on an other day"
"preferably you wouldn't want to bowl there, to anyone, least of all an out-of-form Maxwell. Short on middle and leg, maxi gets inside the line and pulls past short fine leg."
"slower delivery on off and middle, Maxi shuffles across and works to backward square leg, two more"
"yorker on off, jammed away to point. Well played, well bowled"
"looking for that yorker again, outside off, Ends up as a low full toss, squeezed to point"
fired in on off to start. Defended
"yorker on off and middle, pushed to long-on. Pandya gets across from the bowling crease, confounds long-on who lets it go. In the end, Krunal fields off his own bowling, at long-on"
"flat on middle and leg, clipped to square leg"
"lovely placement. Shot of the day? Flat on off, Marsh picks the length early, goes back and whips the ball in front of midwicket. Buttler rushes across but can't haul it in even with a dive. Awesome"
"flat and wide outside off, cut to point who fumbles during a dive and allows another"
nudged to deep midwicket
"nice start. Pushed through full on off, Marsh misreads the length and goes back but pushes to cover from there. Good improvisation"
"flat on off, Maxwell makes room and pushes wide of cover, good dive, another single"
"too much width to Marsh. Flat and short and wide, Marsh gets there late but chops the cut between third man and point. Wonderfully played"
"lovely riposte. Slower on middle, a hint of spin. Defended"
"some air on off, Marsh steps down, doesn't get to the pitch but drives to long-off"
"flat and quick on leg, tickled to short fine leg"
"full but too wide, a sweetly-timed drive is well fielded by Mitch M, running around from deep point to deep cover"
"darted in on leg, plucked off to deep square leg"
"fired in on middle and leg, Maxwell worked to midwicket with soft hands. Two easy. Two fielders again miscommunicate and allow the ball to go through, just two though"
pushed to long-on
fantastic batting from Marsh. Slightly too short and Marsh latches onto the length. Rocks back and slaps the pull over short midwicket.
"flat to finish, driven to long-on with the little bit of turn"
"nowhere near short enough. In fact, that was full. Marsh goes back and somehow pulls to deep midwicket"
"slower through the air but short on off, shovelled to midwicket"
"quicker this time on off, Maxwell opens the face to scythe to deep point"
"92 kph, quite quick on off, driven to cover"
"very flat and quick on off, the closed bat face ensures the ball travels to midwicket"
"smoked in the gap at wide long-on. Knew Kings XI needed boundary, made some room, and crashed the pull-heave in the gap at midwicket. Well done"
"108 kph, slowish on off, tapped to point for one"
"lucky boundary but Maxwell will not care one bit. Slower delivery outside off, 106 kph. Maxwell gets an under-edge past the keeper."
"to the other side of short third man this time. Slower delivery but wide, and even though it is slow, it is an offering and Maxwell carves a cut past Bumrah, four more"
"very slow, finally Pollard gets it straight. Nurdled to midwicket. Maxwell doing it nicely"
"another slow cutter, banged in mid-pitch. Worked to midwicket with soft hands, Panyda gets there and fires a throw. A good throw would have had Marsh"
"another cutter to finish, 108 ks. Tip and run to point"
"lovely bowling. Pushed through,quite full. Marsh is hanging back, the ball spins away late and Marsh is forced to defend"
"some flight on middle, Marsh comes down and pushes back"
"100 kph, flat and quick on middle. Chopped towards point"
"nicely played, picked his spot again. Backs away and cuts in front of point for a couple. No switch hit with that man at point on the boundary"
"103 kph. Very quick outside off, Maxwell misses a cut."
"superb shot from Maxwell. He is rocking today, stemming from wonderful shot selection. like this one. Backs away, makes room and drills a drive past cover. Long-off has no chance"
"slower ball on leg, Marsh is surprised by the 115 kph variation. Hit on the body, towards silly point. Maxwell calls him through."
"another lovely stroke. Full and wide, overpitched, and Maxwell smashes the drive to the sweeper cover"
"shortish delivery on middle, pushed to long-on. Loud yelps of 'push, push' from Maxwell but there is only one there"
"another slower delivery, follows the backing away Marsh. Swivel-flicked to square leg"
"rather ugly, maybe for the first time today. Looking for an across-the-line heave from outside off, a thick inside edge  to square leg"
"another cutter to finish, on leg, cramping Marsh for room. Picked off to square leg"
"nice bowling. Sees Marsh stepping put and flights it wider outside off, Marsh reaches for it and crisply drives to deep cover"
"first time the reverse sweep has come out. And he misses. Too full for that stroke, outside off"
"98 kph, flat on off, Maxwell mis-times his swipe to long-on"
"shortish on off, a chopped cut to point"
"full and wide outside off, a drilled drive finds long-off. Still no boundary this over"
"superb from Marsh, just when Kings XI needed it. Flat but full on middle and leg, in the slot for the big hit. Marsh heaves across the line, but hits it quite cleanly, to wide long-on. Six important runs"
"should have been called a wide? Very full and very wide, outside the wide tramline outside off. Maxwell did shuffle across but not that much. Hmm."
"his response? out of the middle of the bat. Slower ball, back of the hand, on middle. Crunchy sound off the bat and long over long-on. Superb timing"
"looking for another, but too close to his body. Not allowing Maxi to get under it, either. Inside edged onto the body, towards silly point for one"
"excellent execution of the yorker, on leg. Clipped to midwicket, hurriedly."
"full and wide outside off, wrong shot selected? Shovels it to long-on, may have better off hitting it over cover. Did not time the shot either"
"holed out. Clever bowling from Southee. Intentionally bowling it on leg and down leg, a similar delivery there. Marsh picks it off his pads but picks out deep square leg as well. Really good innings from Marsh, though."
"slower delivery on off, nudged with soft hands to midwicket. Miller scurries back for two. Maxwell has fifty."
"Pollard jumps to wide of the crease and bowls on off, nudged to wide long-on. Rayudu hurries across and prevents the second"
"slower delivery outside off, mis-timed to long-off."
"bowled from well behind the crease, very slow on off, Maxwell gets in shape and reverse laps to short third man"
"gone for six. The slower ball on off, Miller sets himself well and sends it sailing towards midwicket. Krunal at the boundary sets himself but Krunal leaps and parries it for six, looked to put it back in the field of play"
"better length from Pollard. Shortish on off, Miller goes back and slaps the ball to long-off"
"131 kph, well bowled. Miller backs away, looking to make room, but Mitch fires a yorker down leg after following him, from around the wicket. Through the legs for a vital dot"
"lap swept to a very fine fine leg. Low full toss down leg, Miller uses deft touch but just one. With that man there, could Miller have done something different with that full toss?"
"nicely played. Full and wide low full toss outside off. Bunted away over the bowler for two. Looked to drag it to square leg but that ball was too wide, in the end"
"excellent bowling. Very full and wide again, Maxwell shuffles across but hammers the drive to long-off"
"low full toss on leg, good bowling. Skewed to deep midwicket, just the one."
"don't get it. Very very full, and very very wide. Maxwell gets across, looking to help the ball past square leg, who is in the circle. But all he can do from that position is chip to deep midwicket"
"bowled, is that the game? It could as well be. A slower delivery outside off, Maxwell looks to bludgeon it over cover but is through the shot too early, a thick inside edge clips the leg stump. Nice innings from Maxi though."
"another slower ball on off, pulled to square leg. Harbhajan fields and a dot ball."
"another cutter outside off, swatted to deep midwicket"
"excessively full on off, Miller cannot get under it. Squeezed to long-on"
"lovely yorker. Wonderful bowling. Very full on off, Naik is fooled by the change up in pace. Quick and Naik misses his heave. Takes out the off stump and that should be it for Kings XI"
"slower ball to finish outside off, Axar cannot read the variation and is beaten"
"eeks, looking for that yorker on leg. Drifts down leg though"
"ooh, very high full toss. And a no ball is called. The crowd comes to life. Follows Miller who backs away, Miller swats the full toss past square leg for four. Miller was a few inches down the track, marginal call"
"through Miller. Without Miller's stance, that was four stumps down leg, but Miller backed away, looking to make room. Through the feet"
"Miller stays in his crease, trying to sweep and misses but well down leg. Easy call"
"and again, Miller gets across and sweeps the full toss to a very fine fielder at fine leg. Just the one, would have been four had that fielder not been positioned there"
swung across the line and bowled im. Speared in the blockhole and Axar tries to mow. Misses and the stumps are clattered
"very high full toss again, just under the waist this time says the umpire. Johnson awkwardly keeps it out"
"full and straight, Miller squeezes his drive off the inside half to long-on."
"another one goes, those zing bails light up yet again. Another yorker on leg, Johnson doesn't have an idea and misses. Leg stumps is uprooted and Johnson falls. All over for Kings XI"
"low full toss on off, smashed to cover who misfields and allows Miller to race back for the second"
"slower delivery on leg, Miller too, has no idea and the ball pings off his hips to point. I'm not sure how Miller has got back for the second"
"another slower ball on middle, and Miller misses again, bounces over"
"connects with this. Maybe, a touch too predictable. Miller stays back, deep in the crease, waits for it and slaps the pull way over deep midwicket"
"full and wide, drilled to long-off. Miller pulls Mohit back for the second"
"good end, inch-perfect yorker. Dug out to long-on. <b>Mumbai get the win they desperately needed. Kings XI stumble further,</b> very hard for them to qualify now."
