"starts down the leg side from back of length, a leg bye off the thigh pad to fine leg"
"this time down the leg side for a right-hander, it goes past the pads and angles down a long way to evade Pant completely for five wides"
"short and wide, Buttler gets a thick upper edge as he throws his bat at it. Samson runs to his left form third man and saves some runs with a dive"
"on Parthiv's pads again, he gets off the mark by tucking it to fine leg"
"full and swinging in a little, Buttler doesn't move his feet and bunts it down to mid-off"
"nicely bowled - angled in from back of length towards the stumps, Buttler is cramped for room and he defends it back"
"tries the yorker, it's a low full toss with late swing. Buttler drives and survives by getting an inside edge to short fine leg"
"gets some room, Parthiv crunches it to point and Shreyas dives to his left for a superb stop with both hands"
"full and wide, Parthiv chases and misses and it's called a wide. Morris looked unhappy but it landed just a tad outside the wide line"
"pitched up outside off, he middles a drive straight to cover-point"
"shortish towards Pathiv's chest, he moves his top half out of the line and cuts it to third man"
"you've seen that before - a top edge goes for six. A short ball angling in, Buttler pulls and sends it high and flying fine on the leg side"
"he's hit them in the V - fine to third man this time for a one-bounce four. He came down the track, Morris pulled his length back and Buttler stilled pull. An outside edge flew fine on the off side"
"<strong>dropped</strong> it, but how! It went straight to Rishabh Pant - over his head - after Buttler went across for a scoop and managed a thin edge. Pant didn't have to move, he put his hands up to catch but his arms were in a tangle. How costly will that be?"
"length delivery angling in towards off, Parthiv rolls his wrists and sends it rolling along the ground to the leg side. Tare runs from square leg but a dive can't save four"
"outside off with some late outswing, Parthiv nudges it to third man"
"towards middle and leg at 126kph, Buttler pushes it to mid-on for one"
tries to work a length ball to the leg side again but takes it on the pads
"towards the off stump, Parthiv turns it towards mid-on for one from length"
one more wide - Zaheer rolls his fingers over that one but it goes down leg
<b>loud appeal only from Zaheer</b> as Buttled takes it on the front pad after the ball pitches on length and beats him. He wanted to work it to leg but got a leg bye on the off side. Might have pitched outside leg
"he makes room and Rabada plants a yorker on off stump, Buttler has to dig it out towards cover"
makes room again and connects well this time - six to the cow corner. Rabada pitched it up as the ball angled in and Buttler swung hard to flay it to leg. Good catch by the ball boy though just outside the rope
"swings again, Rabada changes pace and Buttler misses this time"
"on length outside off, Buttler pushes it into the covers for one"
"second yorker of the over, at 144kph, loud appeal for lbw as Parthiv flicks and misses to be hit on front pad but it probably pitched outside leg"
those wides are not stopping. This was a quick bouncer way down the leg side from Rabada
"what a way to get the <strong>first IPL wicket</strong>, he has yorked Parthiv for a great spectacle! The batsman made a bit of room, Rabada sent down his third yorker of the over and it hit the base of leg stump. Big celebration from Rabada with a punch"
"122kph, on length with the angle outside off, Buttler waits and drives into the covers"
"around off stump on similar length, driven straight to Morris at cover"
"errs down the leg side, Buttler tickles it pretty fine on the leg side for four more"
misfield at mid-off from Mishra for a single. Zaheer pitched it on middle and Buttler pushed it back with a straight bat before Mishra fumbled
"pretty slow and angling into Rana, he tucks it to short fine leg for a very quick single"
"looked like a cutter on length, Buttler chipped it in the air but connected well enough to clear the fielder in the circle and it went over the covers for four"
<strong>direct hit from Sanju Samson</strong> and that's the end of Buttler! I wonder why Buttler said yes to that. Rana defended the back of length ball close to the pitch with soft hands and set off quickly. Buttler responded quickly too but Samson was inside the circle and swooped in in no time and then got the stumps with an underarm throw. Excellent effort
pitched up and Rohit drives it from the middle to Samson at short cover
"on length and slightly straighter, Rohit defends with a straight bat back to Morris"
"nice and accurate from from Morris as he pitches it just outside off again, Rohit defends it again"
gets it a bit shorter but there's still no room and Rohit hangs back to defend it to leg this time
"bangs it in short, Rohit pulls and gets a single behind square"
"pitched up outside off, driven down to long-off easily"
leans forward and blocks the ball with a defense into the off side
"a touch shorter towards middle, it turns it and Rana defends it to leg"
brings out the reverse sweep against the turn and he sends the ball from outside off past short third man for four. Such good placement
"pitched way outside off, Rana lunges out and drives with a big follow through in the air. Morris runs from sweeper cover to his right"
"a shortish googly from off stump, looked like Rana picked it and went on the back foot to cut it square"
"140kph, back of length from outside leg, Rana goes on his toes to defend it"
"and he's pulled it straight to deep midwicket, the man was just moved there. Such a simple trap - short ball for Rana's trademark pull, he does pull and Corey Anderson hardly moves in the deep for a straightforward catch. Such a big wicket this one"
"full and angling in, Pollard flicks it away to get off the mark"
"short of length outside off, Rohit goes back a bit and punches it into the covers nicely for Anderson to pick it up from sweeper cover"
"touch closer to off and still back of lengt, Rohit slices it to third man"
beats him outside off with a short of length ball - Pollard tries to fetch but misses
"they are giving them away - Rohit has swept it to deep backward square leg for a good catch from Cummins. Rohit took a big stride towards the ball and swept that one hard against the spin, Cummins was at long leg and ran a bit to his left for a catch around shoulder height with both hands. Looks like that was a wrong'un and Rohit did pick it, and then picked the fielder too"
"on the off stump, bit of forward leans and blocked"
"length ball around off, Krunal goes across and sweeps but gets a leg bye"
"some turn away from Pollard from lenght, he waits in the crease and defends into the off side"
"stays back again, this one skidded towards the stumps and Pollard defended it back"
beaten outside off again as he turns it away and Pollard offered his bat with the open face but it turned enough to beat the outside edge
back of length from outside leg and Krunal tucks it off the pads to leg
pretty full around off and Krunal drives but doesn't middle it. He finds point
"<b>big appeal</b> for caught behind, there was some noise, but the appeal is turned down. Cummins angled it across from off stump, Krunal tried to chop and replays show there was no edge and it was not even the bat flicking the pad."
pitched up and that's driven nicely through the covers in the gap for two
moves across a little and tucks it from close to his waist to deep square leg
"bangs in a bouncer to end the over outside off, Pollard leaves and that's called a wide. It did go well over his head"
"angling in at 146kph, he tries to work it to leg but doesn't connect. Still gets a leg bye"
"pretty straight on the middle stump, driven down to long-on for one"
"towards Krunal's hips again, he goes across a bit and nudged with soft hands towards deep midwicket for two quick runs"
on his pads again and easy work for him to tickle that to deep midwicket again
"excellent bouncer at 139kph, the line was with the stumps. Krunal did well to sway out of the line"
"another short ball, this one makes Krunal awkward as he takes his eyes off the ball and dabs the ball from chest height to fine leg in the air"
"ends with a bouncer outside off, Pollard lets it go alone"
"low full toss to Krunal, he pushes it down and they decide against the single just in time for Pollard to drag his bat in safely. Direct hit from mid-on but they've gone up to third umpire to waste some time"
it's only 125kph and there's plenty of room for Krunal to open his arms and swing it through the covers for four
"excellent stuff all around - an inswinging yorker towards middle, Krunal digs it out towards deep midwicket and they come back for the second"
"another yorker, this one is directed down to long on"
"pretty accurate at 130kph on middle stump, rolled his fingers over that one and Pollard defends it back"
towards the leg side and easily tucked away to fine leg for one
skids one with the angle down the leg side for a wide
"lovely bowling from Mishra, draws Pollard forward with the flight and length, he chases but the turn beats him"
back to the stumps and Pollard blocks it back
he waits back in the crease this time and cuts it after the turn for one
"there's the googly, vociferous appeal for a catch from Rishabh Pant and the finger goes up. The googly turns away from Krunal, he waits back and tries to tickle it fine towards third man by showing the bat late to the ball, but only manages a thin edge and Rishabh takes it this time"
"nice bit of zip outside off, there's turn too and he defends to cover hesitantly"
"googly to end the over, it comes in and hits the pads after an inside edge. So no appeal"
"bouncer from Zaheer, Pollard goes in the crease and hooks and gets a top edge to get four towards the fine leg boundary. Lucky for Pollard"
"just short of length from outside leg, hits the pads and Zaheer appeals but it pitched outside leg"
"that was close! Pollard swung his bat hard and didn't connect that well, the ball went to midwicket as the batsmen went for the run and Pollard dragged his bat in as Mishra missed the stumps"
another quick single this time as he directs the ball late towards short third man
"back of length outside off, Pollard punches off the back foot to mid off"
"too full if mid off is in and Pollard drills it back, straight enough to beat mid off for four"
"too short and turning away, Hardik punches it easily off the back foot to long-off"
"he does pitch it fuller, but there' enough flight for Pollard to get so much time that he slams it back along the ground to beat long-off for four"
"straight and full on middle, he defends it back"
"flatter one skidding in towards the stumps, he slices it to point"
drives with a straight bat and with the turn from length to long off for one more
"another one turning away and Pollard drives with the turn too, for one more"
"too short, Pollard pulls but not with full power and there's a fielder in the deep. Morris runs in from deep backward square leg but it falls short and then goes through him for four"
"outside off now with hardly any room, he defends towards the covers"
"short and angling in again, doesn't connect well this time as it was slower and gets a single to short fine leg"
"137kph and angling in towards the pads, worked to deep midwicket easily"
"146kmh, using the angle bit too much, Pollard tucks it fine off the pad and short fine leg does well to stop it with a dive"
"on length and wide outside off, sliced it to deep point for one"
"<em>just</em> clears Rabada at deep midwicket for a six! It was pitched up, it was in the zone for Hardik, around middle and leg, and he swung it hard and high to the leg side"
"outside off at 128kph now, he waits and guides it straight to short third man"
"140kph, a short ball now and angling in, Hardik sways his body out of the line but sticks his bat out to send that to third man for one"
"yorker on middle stump, drilled down to long on for one"
"tries the yorker again, it's a bit off towards the leg stump and Pandya drives it on the leg side"
"outside off on good length, some room and Pollard drives it down to long off"
"a top edge, couple of fielders come under it and Samson takes it easily in the end. Back of length offcutter as Cummins rolled his fingers over it, Pollard swung hard and only got a top edge before Samson came in from long off"
"shortish cutter again, not much room and he tries to guide it late towards third man but doesn't middle it"
"short of length again, this time he gets a single to third man"

"short ball on the body, pulled to deep midwicket for one only"

"outside off now, full again, and another swing and a miss from Hardik"
pulls it little shorter and Hardik connects this time. He used the angle swung it to the leg side to clear deep midwicket
"fullish on off stump, he eyes the leg side but gets an edge to point for one"
"Harbhajan clears his front leg, there's not much room as the ball is nearly a yorker on leg stump, he sends it down to long on"
"a wide yorker outside off, not sure he expected that. Tries to chase with a swing and misses"
"a yorker from Rabada and he's run Harbhajan out with some footwork! Hardik blocked the ball and the ball was right there in front of the stumps, they went for the run and Rabada ran hard to kick the ball and hit the stumps. He's beaten Harbhajan in the sprint"
"a yorker, a swing, inside edge onto the pads and they scamper for a single"
"full toss on leg stump, Mitch M swings and gets a single to deep midwicket"
"another run out. A yorker on leg stump, he swings it to deep midwicket and a slightly inaccurate throw from Karun Nair means Pant collects the ball and then stretches his arms to not allow the second run"
"Mitch J swings the full ball really hard, doesn't connect well at all and the ball rolls away to fine leg boundary for four"
"backs away quite a bit, Morris lands a wide yorker and Johnson chases and misses"
"full toss, top edge, and it's <strong>dropped</strong>! It was on Johnson's pads, he tried to find the gap on the leg side but didn't use much power, the edge went high on leg and Rabada ran to his right towards midwicket but couldn't hold on to it while he was on the move. But the batsmen are smart enough to run three!"
"full outside off, gets a good stride forward and drives to cover point"
"full again, a bit of swing in towards off stump this time. Looks to drive through the covers and gets a thick inside edge into his pads"
"back of a length close to off stump, lets it come on for the dab down to third man"
"Sensational fielding from Hardik! Back of a length outside off, pushed to the right of short extra-cover and they look to pinch a quick single. Hardik, though, is quicker to the ball than the batsmen expect, picks up and underarms to the bowler's end in one motion, hits the stumps direct, and the diving Tare is a fair distance short of the crease"
"length ball close to off stump and that's a super shot from Samson, just leans into the ball and punches it away into the gap between cover point and backward point"
"back of a length on middle and leg and that's put away easily again, clips it away sweetly to the left of the long leg fielder"
"full, a bit of width, leans forward to drive and cover point dives right to stop it"
"gone, he's hit that straight to mid-off! Fullish, though not a half-volley, and he plays a checked drive on the up. Ends up timing it better than he expected, perhaps, maybe pushed at it a bit earlier than he should have, and popped it straight to Rohit at chest height"
"length ball outside off, driven on the up to cover point"
"short, angling away from off stump. Looks to make room and cut, ends up slashing and missing"
"on the pads, and he takes a small step across and glances this fine, too fine for the fine leg fielder to catch up"

"swinging in from length around middle stump, worked with the swing to fine leg"

"pitched up slightly, there's some room this time and he drives it wide of mid-off for one"

"angling in towards middle and leg, Anderson defends it to leg"
"more towards the middle stump now, no room at all and he defends it back again"
"too much down the leg side, goes past the pads for a wide"
"Mitch M gets one more in the over, it's his third! He fired in another one with the angle from around off, it was headed for middle or leg stump and Anderson's bat missed the ball, which went on to hit the back pad on the back foot. He turned back to appeal and saw the finger go up. Mitch M and the crowd turning it on"

"some room outside off, he drives into the covers gently and extra cover stops it"
"a bouncer from Johnson just outside off, the batsman lets it go"
"a cutter at 128kph well outside off, Nair chased with a big swing and missed. The ball reaches Parthiv after another bounce with the lack of pace"

"angles it away from Pant outside off, he leaves it alone"
"targets the off stump now, Pant stays still and defends it back"
"edged straight to first slip! Pant goes for a duck. Bumrah banged it in short outside off and angled it away, Pant waited and guided it fine, but it went straight to Harbhajan who pouched it easily"
"outside the off stump, it's pretty wide and he lets it go"
pretty straight now and Rabada drives it back nicely before mid-on cuts it off

"around leg stump on length, he gets his bat down just in time for a single to the off side off an edge"
"what a beauty! angling in as it pitches in front of off, he plays for the angle but the ball seams away and beats the bat completely"
"he's chopped it on! It was a regular length delivery outside off with some room, Nair cut off the back foot but got a bottom edge onto his stumps. The last thing Delhi needed right now"
"another ball outside off, Morris lets it go but gets a bye because of a fumble"

"flatter and straighter outside off, tries to drive and misses"
the conventional sweep now from outside off to fine leg with the turn

Parthiv appeals for a stumping now as Rabada misses the reverse sweep but his toe was just inside the crease when the bails came off
straighter towards the stumps and it's another solid defence from Rabada
"just back of length outside off, punched towards sweeper cover for two"
Morris hits his partner Rabada with a lofted drive and apologises immediately. Mid off was in so he probably wanted to get four straight runs but found Rabada instead
gets a bit of width and Morris executes a cut perfectly with great timing to bisect the gap between point and third man. That races away to the boundary
elegantly driven down the ground to beat mid off but it's not fast enough and long on come across to cut it

Pollard ran to his left from long off, put in a dive to keep the ball in but his back foot touched the boundary rope when he got up to pick the ball up. Sloppy work after some hard work"

"a slow legcutter from Mitch M, Rabada doesn't connect at all as the ball keeps low too and the double bounce also makes Parthiv fumble"

"another short ball outside off, it's a bouncer, this time Morris pulls and misses. Mitch M is appealing for an edge but it's turned down"
"short ball again, maybe he expected it and he's landed it straight to the cow corner boundary over the ropes. This time he got some pace on the ball and connected well too"
"short of length towards leg, Rabada opens up and flashes hard but gets an edge to short third man"

"he wants to put this full ball away to the leg side but the slow yorker dips, beats him and lands in front of off stump but then cuts away to miss the stumps"
