"back of a length at off stump, punched off the back foot to mid-off"
"back of a length at off stump, gets behind the line and shovels it into the leg side off the back foot"
"was there a glove? Yes. This bouncer rises sharply at Kishan who swivels to try and hook it. He's under the ball and not in control at all as he falls over into the off side, but he gets enough for it to fly over the keeper"
"ow. Yet another attempted hook, this one strikes him on the back, just under the left shoulder as he completes his swivel"
"back of a length outside off stump, stands his ground and punches to point who gets an awkward bounce and parries it to his right to concede a single"
"good length, at off stump, pushed wide of mid-off with soft hands"

"full and swinging down leg side, far away from the attempted flick"
"full and swinging in at middle stump, pushed to mid-on off the front foot"
"good shot. Full at his toes, but he holds his shape and offers the full face before extending his arms to lift this over the midwicket boundary"
"goes for the toes again, but misses his line. This offcutter slides down the leg side"
"slower ball, full at middle stump, walks at it and yorks himself. Thick inside edge to midwicket's left"
"back of a length, slightly wide outside off and that's enough for him to slap this cut uppishly past point"
"scatters the stumps. Goes back to the basics, good length ball at off stump. McCullum steps down the track and makes a lot of room to try and slash this with a flat bat. The ball slides under his shot and crashes into the stumps"
"nails the hook on the third attempt. This is climbing at his chest, off stump line, and maybe he has predicted it. Back and across quickly, launches it over the square leg boundary"
"superb shot, this. Walked back and across again and was cramped for room, but he arched backwards and cut this to point's left with some power"
"got third man to move wide with his previous shot, and now he dabs this late cut to his right to find the boundary. This was a length ball too, but he watched it closely"
"back of a length at off stump, defends into the off side off the back foot"
"slower ball, short and wide outside off stump. Skids under the attempted cut and rolls to Parthiv after it crosses the bat"

"good length at off stump, pushes into the off side with soft hands and steals a single"

"good length at off stump, slides through straight and finds the inside edge as he looks to punch this on the up"
"good length, slower ball at off stump, defended back down the pitch watchfully"
"good catch. This is good length at middle stump, Raina pushes nervously at it across the line. Can only chip it in the direction of Pollard at mid-off who leaps high to his left and tumbles and rolls over to arrest the momentum as he holds on"
"slower ball, full and wide outside off stump. Reaches out for it and checks his drive, finds cover point"
"good length at off stump, no feet as he pushes away from the body, inside half of the bat back to the bowler"

"slower ball, good length at off stump, pushed into the covers off the front foot"
"slower ball, back of a length at off stump, leans forward and takes the bottom hand off as he pushes this into the covers"

"back of a length at middle stump, pushed to mid-on off the back foot"
"the old offcutter works for Malinga. Back of a length outside off, Finch is leaping up as he pushes at this away from the body. It's come on slowly after sitting in the pitch and kissed the inside edge. The ball hits his thigh en route to the stumps"
"walks at him, gets a slower ball at off stump, gets right behind and defends off the front foot"
"hangs it up outside off stump, draws the forward push, it's straight at cover"

"back of a length, arm ball at off stump, punched to extra cover off the back foot"
"arm ball, good length at middle stump, pushes off the front foot to extra cover"
"loud appeal, turned down. This is drifting in full at leg stump. He looks to flick this wide of long-on, but is struck on the pad at leg stump. The angle might have taken that down. The deflection takes it past short third man"
"back of a length outside off stump, pulled hard, straight to long-on"
"oh good bowling. Loops it short of good length at middle stump, beats him in flight and draws the leading edge as Kishan checks his shot"
"full at leg stump, thick inside edge on the sweep goes straight to short fine...where <b>Malinga misfields</b>"
"good length at off stump, goes forward and turns it into the leg side, finds midwicket"

"short and wide outside off, biffs this cut shot, but it is straight at sweeper cover"
"good length outside off, steps out and can't get to the pitch. Opens the face and pushes it to backward point"
"runs past a wide ball. This is drifting down leg side, and goes straight on. Karthik steps out slightly, but the foot has gone across, the balance has gone awry, and the bat is locked. Ultimately, he is back in the dugout. Parthiv shuffled nicely to his left and flicked the bails off"
"good length at leg stump, pushed off the front foot to square leg"
"good length at off stump, pushed back to the bowler off the front foot"

"goes for the top spinner wide outside off, Kishan reaches out and hammers it on the up, straight to Pollard at long-off"
"back of a length outside off stump, cuts straight to backward point"
"good length at leg stump, glanced off the back foot to long leg...Kishan wants a second and is forced to dive after being sent back"
"good length outside off, Harbhajan pulled the length back expecting him to come out. He did, and he wasn't to the pitch. But he went through with the shot, a flat-batted heave, and controlled it well enough to lift it over the non-striker and well to long-on's right"
"slower ball, good length at off stump, leans in and places it nicely to sweeper cover's left"
"good shot. This is full and wide of off stump, he gets low and taps this off the outside edge, gets it fine of third man"
"slower ball, good length at middle stump. Pushed to midwicket off the front foot...Kishan is down the pitch again and has to scramble to get back once more. Harbhajan misses with the throw"

"full ball, just short of yorker length at middle stump, flicked to deep square's right"
"slower ball, full toss outside off, pushed to sweeper cover's left off the front foot"
"and the strategy finally works out for the veteran. He has been anticipating some impatience from Kishan, dropping it back of a length outside off consistently. This time, it is spinning towards the wide marker as Kishan steps out. There's some bounce on it too. Kishan steps out, isn't to the pitch and realises he has made too much room. Slashes at it, gets it off the bottom of the bat and holes out to long-off. Crafty offspin bowling"
"good length outside off stump, forward defence"
"topspinner outside off at a length, climbs on him as he leans in. Forces him to adjust and push it wide of cover who gets across quickly to his left"

"another topspinner, climbs at him from outside off stump, inside edge onto the body on the forward defence"
"oh this is close. Faulkner walks across the stump, and gets it on the pad in front of off. But umpire Chris Gaffaney deems it was bat first and turns down the appeal. Harbhajan saw him move and fired it in fast at a good length....replays show <b>no bat</b>"
"good length at off stump, defended off the front foot to extra cover"

"back of a length at off stump, drops it into the off side with soft hands, halfway down the pitch, sent back by Faulkner"
"short and just wide of off stump, makes room and slashes this aerially past point"
"good length, slower ball at off stump. Dropped in front of extra cover who takes a shot at the striker's end and misses"

"back of a length at off stump, punched to sweeper cover off the back foot"
"back of a length at off stump, pushed to long-on off the back foot"
"good length, drifted down leg. Puts a big stride forward and finds long leg with the sweep"
"induces the top-edge and completes the catch himself. This is drifting away from off at a good length. Jadeja is not close to the pitch as he looks for the slog sweep and the angle means he gets a top edge. That hasn't gone past the square, Krunal takes it easily"
"back of a length at off stump, slaps it on the up through the off side, extra cover leaps to his left to stop it"
"overpitched at off stump, squeezed out to sweeper cover off the front foot"

"follows him down the leg side with a yorker, it's well bowled, but in the end nicely flicked to deep square"
"good length at off stump, the first one that has spun away from him tonight. And it spins past his attempted slog sweep"
"full at leg stump, tickled off his ankle, straight to short fine"
"good length at off stump, pushed to long-off"
"the Pandyas send their regards. Tossed up at middle stump, dips on him rapidly. He opens up to try and slog this over the midwicket boundary. Not to the pitch, gets under it too much and launches it high into the sky, it's only a few yards behind the circle where Hardik has reached briskly to snap it up"
"good length, flat at middle stump, pushed into the leg side with soft hands"
"good length at off stump, punched to extra cover off the front foot"
"slower ball, good length at off stump. Fends at it in front of the body, it hits the inside half and drops into the leg side, just enough distance away from the bowler to sneak a single"
"good length at off stump, looks to slap it on the up, inside half of the bat, dragged to long-on"
"low full toss at off stump, late on the shot, jams it into the pitch off the front foot and straight to mid-off"
"slower ball, in the slot at off stump. Waits for it and lifts it cleanly over mid-off who was inside. Pollard ran in swiftly from long-on but couldn't quite keep it in with his foot"
"slower ball, overpitched at off stump, gets it off the toe and it lands in the vicinity of the pitch"
"low full toss at off stump, squeezes it into the off side"
"slower ball, good length at off stump, slogs across the line, no timing. It trickles to deep square leg"
"drops this slower ball short outside off stump, Faulkner was already backing away and this sat up nicely for him, thumped wide of long-off"
"slower ball, back of a length outside off, slashed to sweeper cover on the up"
"whoa, where did that come from? Slower bouncer is straight at him, he stands tall and absolutely creams this hook shot. Flat over the square leg boundary"
"and another! Slower ball at a length outside off, a slight shuffle down the leg side before clubbing it on the up over long-off"
"full outside off stump, makes room to slice it behind square on the off side, finds point with the bottom of the bat"
"overpitched outside off, leans into it and opens the face to slice this square drive wide of point and well to the left of sweeper cover. Tye is making the runs he wants to defend"
"the perfect yorker, <b>but he has overstepped.</b> Gets him plush on the toe as he tries to make room. It strikes him and deflects to short third man"
"misses out on the full toss at leg stump <b>but it is another no-ball.</b> Faulkner barely got under this full toss, just dragged it down weakly to long-on"
"low full toss at leg stump again, can't get timing on this waft across the line, it's down to long-on again"
"slower ball, good length outside off stump. Gets low, on one knee, drags this with full intent and places it wide of deep midwicket"
"low full toss outside off stump, backs away and taps this to sweeper's right"
"unfortunate for Tye. Low full toss at middle stump, jammed into the pitch and Bumrah leaps up with his right hand to stop the ball. Tye has taken off and can't get back in time as Bumrah completes the run out"
"puts a stride across, exposes the leg stump, and loses it too. This has gone under his back leg as he looks to paddle it fine. An awkward end to a painful stay, and that's two wickets in two that might ensure ten runs fewer to get"
"full and wide outside off, Thampi swings at it after backing away, beaten"
"full and wide again, just inside the wide marker, beaten once more"
"<b>dropped.</b> A simple catch goes down at point. This is back of a length outside off stump. Thampi walks across the stumps and prods at it. Thick outside edge lobs slowly to Rana at point and maybe that's why he has mistimed his jump. Up too early, down too quick"
"full ball outside off stump, bat comes down late, outside edge to third man"
"low full toss outside off, a step across to meet it, sliced on the bounce to sweeper cover"
"shot. Length ball at off stump, Soni's <b>front toe is pointed at the midwicket boundary</b>, his back toe at third man, his head on top of middle stump. But his bat is behind the line and the arc takes it over long-off. Rohit covers his face with both hands."
"that's a rubbish start. Short and very wide outside off, may have got away with that to other batsmen but not short batsmen, especially Parthiv. Gets underneath the cut and hits it over point. Superb"
"now down the leg side, nudged down to fine leg for a run. Too easy"
"much better to the right-hander. Good length on off, blocked back. Nice line. No seam movement though"
"nice. Whaaat? That has kept going and going and going. On the legs and Buttler flicks through midwicket. Looked like one, then two, then four. Past Irfan Pathan"
"good length delivery outside off, Buttler looks to play square, through the off side. But bunts it back."
"played that really well. Not a bad ball, aimed at off and middle on a nice full length. but Buttler uses a proactive approach, shimmies down, converts it into a leg side delivery and flicks down to fine leg."
"wide of mid-off. Full and wide outside off, Parthiv played that slightly early, hit it uppishly but found the gap. That's all that matters in cricket. Four on a lightning outfield"
"full and wide outside off, Parthiv skews a drive through point. Extra cover dives over the ball to concede an extra"
"this isn't great bowling. On the pads, full down leg and Parthiv flicks through midwicket. Superb timing, bad placement"
"terrible bowling. Again, short and wide outside off. parthiv will lay into his cuts all day, all night. Slashes one towards backward point who misfields and allows the ball to go past"
"this is short and wide too. But Parthiv shuffled across slightly, making a cut harder because he was closer to the ball. Beaten"
"better length. Full and straight, on-driven towards mid-on who saves three with a dive to his right. Buttler caught ball-watching but all safe"
"starts with a slow cutter outside off, slapped to cover"
"can't bowl short with no pace. Short on middle, Parthiv's second best stroke, the pull. Played that late and got it behind square for four"
more tripe from Irfan. Digs in a short ball at just medium pace. Sits up for Parthiv and a cross-batted swat goes waaay over square leg. Not very good
"now short and wide, this has been a terrible start from Lions. Parthiv finds point"
"short and slow outside off, the slower ball. Parthiv drags a pull through midwicket. Not the greatest shot selection, but at Irfan's pace, do what you want"
"four more. Probably his best delivery, fullish around middle. Parthiv comes down and nonchalantly flicks behind square for four. Mumbai flying away"
"tossed up outside off, driven towards cover. Overpitched"
"short and wide outside off, another poor bowl. Cut straight to extra cover, got away with that"
"lots of flight on that outside off, driven up to long-off for a run"
picks the length really quickly. Parthiv punches a push through extra cover for a couple
"pushed through. Flat outside off, fifth-stump channel. Hit away to point"
"And Lions strike with a run-out. The worst ball of the over, short and wide from Soni. Cut away to backward point where Faulkner stops the ball with a dive. The ball ricocheted not too far away, Faulkner picked it up and effected a direct-hit at the batsman's end. Buttler not happy as he walks off."
"flat down leg, clipped to short fine leg. Parthiv comes down but it sent back"
"flat and straight, pushed to mid-on for a run"
"pushed back, nice and straight"
"swept away over midwicket for six. Full outside off, Rana gets low and nails a sweep. Got underneath that enough"
worked away through midwicket
"flat outside off, pushed to long-off for a run"
"nicely played. A 113 kph, short slow ball outside off. Parthiv helps it along to the third man boundary with deft touch. Third man was up. Nicely played"
"too straight this time, flicked through backward square leg for a couple more"
"deceived with a slower ball. Shortish outside off, played towards point. Extra bounce."
"another slower delivery, 116 kph, line is good too - just around off stump. Defended"
"full and straight, hit up to mid-on for a run"
"another poor delivery, on the pads, flicked through backward square leg for a couple."
"full and straight, worked towards wide long-on. Parthiv wants two, but Finch's throw is good. too good. Ricochets off the stumps for an overthrow"
"flat outside off, punched up to long-off"
pushed quietly to long-on
"flatter outside off, pulled to long-on. Too simple"
Rana runs down and works the ball to deep midwicket for one
"full outside off, Parthiv misread the length, went back to a full ball. And pushed it up to long-off"
"lovely length. Flat outside off, worked to midwicket. A tight single. Parthiv hitting and running, there isn't much calling, surprising from such an experienced player"
"full outside off, hit up to long-on"
"<strong>big big appeal</strong>. No says umpire Gaffaney. Flat outside off, Parthiv misses a cut. Good call. Didn't hear anything, no discernible deflection either"
drifts down leg for a wide.
"on the pads, worked for a run to square leg. <strong>Fifty for Parthiv</strong>, superb knock."
nicely bowled again. Flight but not overpitched. Rana plays the line but is struck on the pad because of some spin
"the googly outside off, defended"
"short and wide, scythed to deep point."
"flat and straight, worked to deep midwicket"
"dropped short outside off, pulled to long-off. Just nothing happening"
Rana comes down and pushes to cover
"flat and full on off, blocked"
clipped away through midwicket for another run. Not too bad an over for either side
"nicely hit. Flat outside off, too full as well. Rana gets underneath the length and nails a lofted cover drive over cover"
swept down to short fine leg for a run
"lovely bowling. Plenty of flight outside off, rips back in. Parthiv chops a cut to third man. Again, no call, just running from Parthiv"
"right in front, but was there some glove on that?. No need to play that stroke. Flat and straight from Soni, Rana gets low, looking to play a reverse sweep, but misses it. The ball spins back in and hits Rana on the glove. Umpire Gaffaney gives it. Not the right decision, but not an easy one to see either, especially because the bat almost covers the line"
"excellent bowling. Flat and straight, blocked"
"flight on off, pushed to cover. Great over from Soni, flight, loop, dip. Didn't use the googly too much"
"yikes. A low full toss on off, hammered through midwicket. Tye runs around and gets to the ball, but the ball ricochets to the boundary. <b>He does some damage to his left shoulder.</b> The physio comes out to have a look too. May be a dislocation, the way he landed on that shoulder. Just may have plonked out of the socket. Chris Lynn suffered something similar, and hasn't been playing much since. Lions' most penetrative bowler this season too."
"flight outside off, pushed back"
"short outside off, pulled towards wide midwicket. Roy can't prevent the second"
"getting turn now. Flat and wide outside off, slapped to the sweeper cover"
"too straight, nudged to square leg"
"sees Rohit coming so Raina fires this down leg, pushed to long-on. Decent over save that full toss"
"nicely bowled. Flight outside off, Rohit skews a drive to point. This is really good bowling"
"flat outside off, pushed away to the sweeper cover"
looking to go over cover. The ball skids on slightly and the ball squirts off the outside half to the sweeper cover
"the googly, drops short though. Cut to point"
"superb bowling. Lots of flight outside off, Rohit looks to go over cover but the ball beats the bat. Rohit's back foot over-balanced out of the crease but Karthik fumbled. A missed stumping"
"short outside off, punched to long-on"
"fullish delivery outside off, pushed to cover. Some spin now. Lions have read conditions quite well, not done much else too well"
punched up to long-off
"too quick. Short outside off, dabbed away to short third man. Faulkner dives to his right to save some runs"
driven away past cover for a run. Just has to slow his pace down a touch
"picks the gap does Parthiv. Short on off, pulled to deep midwicket. Hit the gap nicely"
"knows Jadeja's pace is quick so he waits for the ball to come to him before playing a deft stroke. A cute dab past short third man for four. That's thinking batting, sticking to his strengths, a lot like Williamson"
"a thin nick through and Rohit falls now. All that pressure trying to be released with deft touch. Not the worst option from Rohit, he sees third man is up so he tries to use the pace and guide the ball past him but the ball skids on, maybe gets some extra bounce and takes a thin edge through to Karthik. A discernible noise as ball passed bat."
"another edge. Third man is back but too square. Full outside off, angled away. Pollard comes down but the ball takes the edge and goes wide of Karthik."
"fullish outside off, a thick leading edge raced away to cover"
"how? What? Why? <b>Another absolute sitter.</b> Dropped. Full and straight from Faulkner, Pollard flicks to midwicket, Thampi puts his hands up but the ball bounces out and another catch dropped."
"taken this time. All happening. Good length outside off, Parthiv looks for a carve down to third man but just like Rohit's dismissal, the ball bounces extra and takes the outside edge. To Karthik's left and he holds on, a sharp catch."
"excellent bowling. You cannot be better to a new batsman. A full, tailing-in delivery, looking to go through his defense or hit him on the pad. Krunal somehow flicks to midwicket. Great over from Faulkner, execution impeccable on this surface. Using his angles and pace effectively"
"a low full toss down leg, worked down to fine leg. Looking for the stumps again, well bowled"
"full and wide, carved out to the sweeper cover"
"another full, straight, pacey delivery. Off the outside edge to third man. Good captaincy from Raina, raw pace troubles Pollard"
"good length outside off, pushed back."
"good length outside off, dabbed to third man for a run"
misses the yorker but not a bad option. A low full toss is pushed to long-on.
"full outside off, a false drive towards the sweeper cover"
"gets it past Finch. Full delivery outside off, Krunal looks to hit the ball over mid-off. Doesn't time it but it's straight enough to beat the mid-off fielder"
just a chip to long-on
"eh. That's not good. Full outside off, played to Raina at cover who under-arms a throw at the bowler's end. No back-up, no chance of a run-out. Concedes an extra. Visibly disgusted with himself"
"full and straight, pushed to long-on"
"fullish delivery outside off, pushed up to long-off. Another tidy over from Faulkner"
"picks his bowler and executed. A length delivery on middle and leg, swatted wide of midwicket for four."
"goes for it again but finds long-on. Full again, full and straight. Right in the slot. Pollard was slightly late on it, didn't quite get underneath the ball. Hits it flat and finds McCullum at long-on. Right in the hitting arc. A scrappy innings from Pollard, again undone by a bit of extra pace. A slightly slower ball and that would have been six"
"full outside off, pushed to mid-off. Finch misses the stumps at the bowler's end. No real chance of a run-out but good to try to hit the stumps. The bat can jar into the ground at any point during sliding"
"short on middle, pulled to mid-on. Falls in front of Finch, who throws the ball into the ground again. Trying to scuff up the ball."
"a slower ball outside off, guided to slip who parries the ball away"
"looking for the yorker again. A low full toss, pushed up to long-on. Decent over."
"122 kph, slower ball outside off, carved to the sweeper cover"
"short outside off, pulled to midwicket. Raina has learnt from his mistake and chooses not to throw."
"there it is. Would have gone straight to a man at the edge of the circle. Full on off, Krunal heaves but the ball skews off the inside edge. Goes over Raina's head at midwicket, he sticks his hand up but can't hold on. It's <b>another drop</b> but a great effort"
"another slower ball outside off, bunted away to the sweeper cover"
"finds the gap. Short of a length on middle, hit wide of long-on for a couple. Good captaincy from Raina too, he had moved himself to square leg. Pushed mdiwicket back."
"just wide of midwicket. Four more. Huge ball. Huge event. Full and straight from Faulkner, Krunal lifts the ball but can't quite time it well. His bottom hand takes it wide of long-on. McCullum almost gets there, but doesn't. Lands short of the boundary"
"this is not one of them. Looks for it, but doesn't get enough behind the ball. Hardik got across, looking for a hit down the ground, straight preferably. But the ball is on the legs which takes him aback. He tries to generate enough power through the stroke but his heave finds deep midwicket. He almost premeditated a big, straight hit. That ball was there for the picking through the leg side if he played it by merit"
"full and wide, inside the tramline though. Krunal was looking for one to third man. No bat."
"full and wide outside off, Krunal leans into a drive and finds a gap wide of cover. McCullum gets across, two more"
"a slower ball outside off, hammered to cover. Faulkner picks up and hits the stumps at the bowler's end. The ball ricochets towards him, but he is aware to get to the ball."
"not quite the yorker but it's full, it's straight, there is some reverse swing too. Quick and accurate. Harbhajan misses a straight one and the ball raps him in front of leg. Plumb in front. Good call umpire Chaudhary. That was quite predictable but Harbhajan done in by that reverse swing"
"and gone. Direct hit. Run out. Mumbai are eight down. They may be all out. Thampi chooses a straight and full delivery. McClenaghan gets low and paddles to fine leg who was very square. It almost carries, Irfan goes for the catch. The ball falls short. He somehow manages to keep it in the field of play. He knows he still has work to do so he gets up and throws the ball back in, it hits the stumps direct at the batsman's end as McClenghan tries to sprawl in. A direct hit. Two direct hits. He did superbly well to prevent the boundary. Amazing work"
"oh no, you just do not. DO NOT bowl length. Full and straight from Irfan, in the slot. Right in the slot. Krunal nails a lofted drive and straight. Straight for six. Amazing area to hit the ball."
"shortish delivery, slow on off and middle. Pulled to square leg. Another nothing delivery. In the slot for another big hit"
"what is happening? That's run-out. Jadeja is the man. A slow ball outside off, hit towards point. Jadeja runs in, picks up and throws the stumps down at the bowler's end. Mumbai are nine down. The ball deflected away to the boundary so if Bumrah was in, that would have been four runs. Bumrah is well short."
"great work from Krunal. Great work from Roy. Short and wide, slow outside off. Carved through backward point for a couple. There is no point. Roy got around from sweeper cover"
"full and straight, got some tail back in. I think that is really good batting. Pushed to mid-off for a riskless single."
"is that out? There is a direct hit. Has Krunal made his ground? No he hasn't. It's a Super Over, the first of the IPL. Jadeja has done this with two direct hits. What fielding. Sensational. A yorker on the pads, Malinga misses a flick. The ball ricochets towards jadeja at point, picks up and throws the stumps down at the batsman's end to find Krunal short despite a dive. Magnificent fielding."
