"not a great start for the Strikers. Quick on the pads, clips Klinger's pads and races away down to the fine leg fence"

"poor delivery, short and very wide. Klinger crashes his cut but picks out backward point. Lucky"
"yikes. Short and wide, loops over the batsman's head for an extra"
"nice. Good length just around off, Klinger blocks this into the off side and sets off for one"
"back of a length on leg, Whiteman is hustled through his pull, gloves it towards fine leg. Good pace in this pitch"
"taken. The pace in this pitch again. Back of a length, rises to Klinger's ribs, top-edged pull travels to fine leg who runs in a few yards and completes a simple catch in front of his midriff. One of Scorchers' best goes. Beaten for pace"
"<strong>dropped</strong>. Weatherald the man. Got there too late. May have been misjudged. Another one dug in into middle, Bell mistimes his pull, it goes towards the man at mid-on who runs towards midwicket and lets it burst through"
"another one that is dug in, a badly-timed pull back to the bowler"
"full and wide outside off, the ball goes past the outside edge as Whiteman looks to drive. His feet nowhere"

"Bell advances and pulls through midwicket, calls for two, gets 'em"
"slow through the air, Bell comes down and defends"

"back of a length outside off, goes past the outside edge"
"drops short this time, the ball sits up for Whiteman to thwack through midwicket with a cross-batted swat"
"good take. Back of a length on middle, Whiteman top-edges this because of some extra zip and oomph in the delivery. The ball flies down to fine leg, who gets in position early, sets himself up and takes an easy reverse-cupped catch."
pulled through midwicket for four more. Just a tad short from Richardson again. Easy enough for Bell
a deft dab to third man

what a shot. A tad full and crisply caressed through mid-on
dabbed down to third man with the open face
"dropped by Pollard. Lots of flight on that, Marsh gets under the delivery and mis-times his lifted drive. Pollard gets around from long-on, dives to his left but spills the chance. A take-able catch by Pollard's standards"
""
"oh yes, that's huge. Bell comes down to the pitch and lofts the ball over long-off. Got forward and made the stroke. Superb"
"the wrong un. On the pad, Bell comes down and misses his nudge"

"full and straight, driven down to long-on"

"full and straight, a thick inside edge trickles down to fine leg"
"full and straight again, bell comes down and squirts one to long-on"

"back of a length, played down to third man with the open face. A productive stroke today"
"excellently bowled. Spears the yorker in on middle, jammed to point"

"another bouncer on off, swatted away through square leg"
"good length outside off, pushed away towards point"
"136 kph, hammered through midwicket for two more. Played that down"
strays down leg for a leg side wide
"short delivery on middle, pulled to deep square leg"
"he couldn't have wanted it there, could he? A low full toss on middle, Bell edges it through slip for four. He has played that shot all day, it may just have been intentional, maybe not as fine as he wanted"
"ooh. That could be out. Lovely stuff from Weatherald. Back of a length on middle, worked to midwicket and Turner calls for one. Weatherald runs in, picks up and throws the stumps down at the batsman's end. Bell knew he was gone. Superb knock"
"133 kph, on the pads. Voges misses it and they get one via the deflection to third man"
"shot! Full and straight, Turner has had enough of plodding about. He clears his front leg and launches it way over long-on"

cut/angled down to third man

"shot! Short delivery outside off, pummelled through midwicket for four more. Another lovely stroke, placed well"

"shortish on middle, pulled to deep midwicket"
"straight through, and given! 123 kph, goes quickly on middle. Bounces just over middle stump as Voges misses a flick, closing the bat face on the ball. Dunk dives to his left and takes the catch."

"yorker on off, driven to Lehmann at mid-off who throws one loopily back to the keeper, very wide of him though"
"good bowling. Full and wide, slapped to deep point. Complete miscommunication between the two, Agar sacrifices himself but the throw to the keeper bounces just in front of him and he can't collect. The fielder backing up misfields too. One and a wicket turns into three"
""
"excellent delivery. A yorker on off, a thick inside edge races down to fine leg. Ouch"
"lovely shot. Low full toss this time, Agar helps himself to four with a swat over midwicket"
skewed to long-on from the wide yorker. Well bowled
"a slower yorker, squeezed to midwicket"
"another wide, full and wide outside off. Slower ball"
"in the slot and outta here. Full on off, Turner gets undeneath that and lofts the ball over long-on. Easy as ..."
driven to cover. A good yorker
"short delivery on off, 129 kph. Slower ball. Agar swats the ball in the air to midwicket. Hodge settles underneath that"
"a full toss outside off, poor delivery. Thrashed. Cross-batted over midwicket for six. What a cameo that is"
"Full and swinging away, defended into covers"
"Swings it away again, this time short of a length. Dunk throws his hands at it and misses"
"More outswing, this time he draws a drive from Dunk who hits it straight to Klinger at covers. Might have been a wide if he hadn't gone after that. Scorchers return the favour and strike in the first over."
"Similar ball to Dunk's wicket, but Travis Head creams that through the covers first ball"
"Brings it in this time. Full and on middle stump, defended solidly"
"Another one aimed for middle stump, negotiated comfortably off the front foot by Head"
"Drifts it in from around the wicket, clipped away to deep midwicket for a single"
"Drifted in, pushed to midwicket off the back foot"
Driven down to long on with the drift
Loud appeal. Batsman plays across and misses it off the back foot. Nearly run-out
""
""
"Short and wide, Head swings wildly and misses that one. Some bounce there"
Takes off from a length. Willey is maintaining this shape away. Catches Head by surprise as it flies past his chest
"Back of a length on off stump, gets some grip from the pitch. Inside edge onto pad"
This is a good line from Willey. Brings him forward this time. Defended to covers

"Brilliant from Willey! Builds the pressure, and bowls one straight and full. Weatherald misses, trapped in front."
"Short of a length, swinging in. Swatted down to third man"

Angled away. Tries to cut and misses
"Angled away again, this time Head gets an inside onto his wild cut"
"Full and wide, slashed down to third man who fumbles"
Richardson persists with the angle and pushes it slightly wider. Head gets the outside edge this time and it is easily taken by the keeper
"Full and swung into the pads, Hodge dispatches it through midwicket"
Swung into the pads again. Raps him on the pads. Going down.
Pitched on middle on a good length. Hodge swivels and drags it down to fine leg
"Full and straight, Pollard has to get his bat down quickly. Inside edge on to the boot"
"Full on middle stump, Hodge gets a lot of bat on this, but Willey stops it in his follow through"
"Angled across on a length. Hodge swings wildly, doesn't get a connection. Bounces feebly away to midwicket."
"oooh, close. Richardson digs in a short one, cramping Pollard up. Got good height too. Pollard was fending away and the ball wandered away to the right of short leg"
"some relief. Hodge makes room, perhaps knowing the length would be short and the line would be on leg stump. Carves it over point"
top edge over the keeper. That was a perfect exhibition of clearing the front leg and unleashing a big old slog. Except the ball went to third man instead of midwicket.
"slower ball, picked and dispatched through extra cover. Waited in his stance, front leg shoved way down leg, aand belted it through the line"
"sliced to the third man boundary. This time it's short and wide. A touch slower as well. Hodge adjusts, having put his front leg aside, and picks the gap with a cut."
"fired in down the leg side, Hodge tries to get a little tickle in. Doesn't succeed"
"angled into middle and leg, Hodge clips it behind square leg"
"walks down the pitch, but the bowler is wise to his plans. Sticks in a slower delivery on middle and leg, Pollard doesn't have any room to work with. Nudges into the leg side and Hodge is awake for a quick single. Had to run around the bowler though"
"short and outside off, pulled through to deep square leg"
"full and outside off, goes for a big old hoick over the top of the bowler's head, but doesn't get anything on it"

"back of a length and on off stump, slid to point off the open face"
"full on off stump, Hodge works it down, straight of mid-on"

"short and wide outside off at 142 kph, cut to deep point"
"it's the offcutter on middle and leg, Pollard was into his slog way too early, and his bottom hand flew off the bat as he inside edges through square leg"
"shortish and outside off, steered behind point"
"a wicket in his first over, and the WACA explodes. Johnson is lost underneath a huddle, people yanking on his hair after he has forced Pollard to top edge to third man. It was quick, just back of a length and outside off. The batsman tried to slap it through the line, somewhere in the region of point, but made nowhere near the requisite connection. Offers a skier to Mitch Marsh who takes it reverse cup."
"around the wicket to Hodge, aiming for middle stump, Hodge makes room and directs it to third man"
"there we go. A T20 special. Hodge looks to take a back of a length ball on off stump and heave it over cow corner. He has to settle for a six over third man instead. You win some, you win some outrageously"
"goes full, goes slow, on off stump, the change of pace makes Hodge think twice. That backswing was going high again, but when it came down, it was in a checked defensive push"
"length ball on and around off stump, slashes to deep third man. Looks like a very thick outside edge"
"good length ball on off stump, tapped to point"
"lashes an overpitched delivery to short cover, good work from Voges diving to his right."
big appeal for a lbw as Hodge falls over trying to flick a good length ball coming straight at middle and leg. Saved by the inside edge
"and he troubles Lehmann with a straighter one. Went back, expecting to cut a shortish delivery, but when it kept coming it him from around the wicket, he gets an inside edge"
""
"shortish and outside off, cut, having waited a while to do so, to keep it to the left of deep point and get two"
"fired into the pads, worked to deep midwicket"
moves back and pushes into the covers
tries to use the pace and get a late cut away but he can't beat short third man. Shortish delivery just outside off amounts to nothing
"strides down the track and slogs across the line at a back of a length delivery on middle, gets an inside edge which lobs over the stumps"
"that's gone so high. <b>Catch dropped and a collision</b>! Johnson from fine leg and Bell from square leg were running towards each other and they run into each other. The impact wasn't too bad though, because both men had seen how close they were. Odd then that neither called. It was a back of a length ball that Hodge swung merrily at. Gets another top edge. Survives again"
"Klinger fires a direct hit at the bowler's end from point! Lehmann was looking to give the strike back, but he seems to hesitate. He's still only a third of the way down the pitch when the fielder got to the ball, was halfway down when he took aim and was nowhere near safety when the throw hits the target"
smashed to deep cover
"short and wide, Hodge gives it a good home behind the point boundary. Makes room and slashes it away"
"another one, through point again. Back of a length deliveries on fifth stump are becoming buffet balls with Hodge making room for himself"
"good length ball on the pads, the new batsman Jordan goes for a sweep straight away. Finds short fine leg"
backs away and taps a shortish delivery on off stump to short third man
"he's played across a straight ball and has been pinned in front of middle and leg. Good change of pace from Agar. He fired it in quick, and full. Jordan wasn't ready. His bat is still coming down, when he is struck below the knee-roll. Easy decision"
"tossed up on middle, whipped away to deep midwicket"
"good length ball on off stump, Hodge is brought forward as he pushes into the covers"
defends to the left of cover as Agar keeps to a tight line on off stump and his flatter trajectory and quicker pace isn't quite helping the batsman get under him
mid-on's up so Neser takes a length ball on off stump and lifts it straight over the top. Good shot. Riskless. If you back yourself against Johnson's pace
"goes for a pull against a 143 kph short delivery on off stump, mistimes it to mid-on. Tight single, makes it across, considering there is no direct hit"
"the stumps flash red and Johnson loves that. Funnily enough though, this is the slower ball. The offcutter, full and straight. Hodge swung across the line, he doesn't pick the variation either and is through the shot a touch too soon"
"back of a length delivery slung down past the leg stump and the new batsman Richardson, who wafts and misses"
"140 kph, shortish on leg stump, Richardson jumps across to try and flick. Doesn't connect"
"143 kph, bouncer angled across the right-hander, Richardson was on the front foot, trying to pull, and the ball whooshes past his right ear. Top pace. Good height. Sharp bouncer"
"offcutter, scooped over mid-off. Richardson clears the front leg and is swinging for all money. Mistimes it"
slog swept over the square leg boundary. That's the longest at the ground and he clears it comfortably. The odd ball that Agar has tossed up in this spell and Richardson picks it
"fired into the pads now, Richardson goes for the sweep again, has to settle for leg byes this time"
"pushed through on middle and leg, Neser goes back to flick to midwicket. Agar races after the ball himself"
"launched into the stands behind long-on. Lenght ball, plenty of room, so even if it was quick, Richardson has the room to free his arms"
"third one out of the park. It's the slog sweep again, to a flighted delivery. You'd rave about this ball in Test cricket. In T20s, it's fodder"
"hammered to long-on, big old wind-up too. But perhaps the line, on middle and leg, limited Richardson's options"
"full on off stump, eased into the covers. Fumble from Voges allows a second"
"full and wide, he is able to slice it over point for a couple"
"full toss outside off, Richardson swings from the spot, and misses. If he had taken his front leg across, that could have been runs through extra cover, perhaps"
"now he strides down the pitch, but Tye sneaks in a quick and short delivery and beats him"
lashes a slower ball outside off over cover. Protection there though
"lands a yorker just outside off, steered behind point for a single"
"made his move outside leg a little too early, allowing Johnson to slow his pace down and follow him with the short ball. Sliced to point for a single"
"full and straight - it's slower though - and Richardson picks it. Clears the front leg, waits a touch longer, and hammers it over long-off. Clean strike"
follows Richardson with a 139 kph short ball as the batsman aimed to run away outside leg to open up the off side. Ends up cramped and only nudges it to midwicket
"137 kph, bouncer, whistling past Richardson's right ear as he tries to swat it through midwicket"
"offcutter, pitching on leg stump and ripping away. Richardson was into the slog far too early and is beaten all ends up"

"back of a length and outside off, there for the heave, goes for the heave, misses the heave"
"flat-batted to long-off as Tye bowls full and wide outside off, trying to put the ball past the batsman's reach"
"slower bouncer, outside off, Richardson is looking legside only, goes for a pull, goes too early, inside edge to short leg"
falls just short of Turner running in from the midwicket boundary. Got under a length ball a little too much - it was the legcutter and Neser was into the shot too early - toe ends a heave.
"width outside off and Richardson gets just enough bat on it to help himself to a boundary to third man. Had to reach for it though, considering he was shaping to move to leg again"
"slow, dipping yorker on middle and leg. Richardson is lucky again as he gets an inside edge to the wicketkeeper"
"races off the outside edge to the third man boundary. Full and straight, around leg stump, he hits across the line and benefits"
"119kph, full and slow on leg stump, Neser whacks it to long-on"
"another offcutter, aims at leg stump, Richardson makes room and cuts to cover"
"that's the quicker one - 142 kph - follows Richardson who is deep in his crease, clearing the front leg, and suddenly, instinctively has to pull, the ball is coming at his head. Manages to make the connection and he is so off balance that he runs around  the stumps to take his single"
"full on middle and leg at 143 kph, Neser swings wildly and gets an inside edge to long leg. Johnson scratches his head in frustration"
finishes his spell with a short ball that's pulled straight into deep square leg's hands. Screams in delight.
"full and wide outside off, Richardson tries to slice it behind point but he can't quite reach it"
"full and outside off, drilled to the right of extra cover"
"back of a length on off stump, Richardson slogs again and gets a very thick leading edge straight down the pitch"
"back of a length and slid across the right-hander, O'Connor pokes at the ball, without moving his feet, and is beaten"
"goes for a bouncer, angles it across O'Conner, who can only duck out of the way"
"offcutter on middle and off, O'Connor nudges it towards mid-on"
"low full toss outside off, lashed to deep point. Only four runs off that over, impressive bowling from Willey in the slog overs"
"legcutter outside off, plopped to long-off. Misses his fifty by five runs, but it's been an entertaining innings."
"full on leg stump, clipped through mdiwicket"
"full and outside off, Stanlake goes for a cover drive and misses"

"full on off stump, driven to mid-on. Good timing."

"back of a length and outside off, O'Connor goes for a hoick and misses"
