"can you believe it? He's bowled a shocker, but has a wicket and the danger man is gone! Short and sliding down leg, Quiney flicks but picks out deep fine leg. Simply helped it straight down the throat of the fielder. The man who has been in sensational form all tournament is out for a golden duck. Johnson hares to high five his mates."
"angles a length ball across the right hander, left alone by Wright"
"full on off, Wright hangs back and defends from the crease towards point"
"make that one more. Wright shapes to cut but there isn't much width there, goes through with the slash that flies low to Turner who takes a super catch at gully. Johnson leaps, Melbourne Stars in trouble already"
"this one nips back in a touch from off stump, Gotch gets half-forward and blocks"
"floats a back of length delivery outside off, he shoulders arms to end an eventful first over"
"starts off with a wayward delivery down leg. KP misses a flick, well collected by the keeper moving low to his left"

"floats this full and across KP on off stump, driven down to mid-on"
"did he attempt a stroke? Me thinks not. KP looks to work it square, and it appeared like he pulled out at the last moment. The ball deflects off the thigh pad to square leg"

"crunching cover drive. Too full, leans forward and crashes that into the gap. Top shot"
"chips a simple catch to midwicket. Voges rewarded for attacking captaincy, and Johnson has ripped the game open. Looks like this short of length delivery on middle stopped on KP, who looked to work it uppishly, only to find the fielder. Real trouble"
"floats a length ball across the batsmen, left alone"
hops back into the crease and turns the in-dipper to the leg side

"looks to thrash that through cover, feet nowhere to the pitch of the ball, beaten"
"picks out the lone man at deep square. This was too short, he rocked back and pulled, ended up dragging it from way outside off, and Marsh takes a dolly. It's all falling apart very quickly for Stars"

uses the pace to run it down to third man
"rip roaring bouncer that climbs onto Hussey, who is rapped on the glove as he looks to fend. Ouch, that will hurt"

"too full for him to pull, close to off stump as well. Play and a miss"
"slower and fuller outside off, eased to point. Leg-cutter form Richardson. Excellent change of pace"
"excellent effort by Shaun Marsh, but hit too well by Hussey. He took it well but was over the ropes at long-on. Both feet were well beyond the ropes and had touched the ground when he threw it back into the field of play"
"so what if they couldn't get him off the previous delivery? Hussey is gone now, but not before Bell briefly gives the bowler some shivers by juggling at sweeper cover. This was full and flat outside off from around the stumps, he backed away and carved it straight to the fielder."

"fired down leg, looks to flick but is late on the shot. Hit on the body"
"swung across the line, didn't get to the pitch of the ball but went through with the stroke, Marsh at long-on this was was mindful of where the rope was.

gets across the stumps and bunts it back to the bowler

flayed to deep point for an easy single
"appeal for lbw, but that was very optimistic. It would have missed leg. Hits the seam and nips back in, he prods and gets a deflection off the pad to the off side"
"outstanding catch! This was a waist-high full toss on middle, he backed away and slapped it. At one point, it looked certain to race past Agar, but he moved early to his left and then dived low even as the ball was dying on him before using his height to good effect at mid-off. Super catch"

"looks to open the bat face late to squeeze it behind point, but can't get any bat to it"
"smeared into the gap at sweeper cover, Marsh comes around but takes ages to get to the ball. The throw is weak too"
"swing and a miss. Went for a swipe across the line. This wasn't all that wide, but the umpire thinks so. The bowler is disappointed, as he should be"

"short and wide outside off, he backs away to slash and is beaten"

"floats a length ball into middle and leg, hint of shape in, tucked to midwicket"
uppish and just short of backward point. Looked to hit it over the man there

"full and swinging away from outside off, left alone"
"full and straight on middle, tucked wide of midwicket to get off the mark"
"cramped for room, bunts it to point and looks for a single, but is sent back"

gets to the pitch of the ball and turns it with the spin to long on as they jog the single this time
"fired into the pads, makes a bit of room and eases it past the bowler"

"looked to swing this over to Sydney! Whiteman stands his ground. Boland thought there was an under-edge that flew to the keeper, but the umpire was unmoved. There was some sound, looked like he hit it. <b> Oh dear, hard on Melbourne Stars. </b>"
gets an inside edge that rolls to the leg side as they jog a single
whipped off his hip to deep fine leg
"hits the deck hard with a back of length delivery on off stump, bunted to point"

shows the full face of the bat in defense
"whipped, on the bounce to square leg"
"lobbed over cover. The outfield is fast that side and it races away. Didn't control the forward push, but once it beat mid-off, the ball just kept gathering pace."
"width on offer, punched to point"
"gets across the stump and plays the pick up shot superbly to clear deep backward square leg. The bowler came from around the stumps to perhaps shape the ball away, but this kept coming back in and he whipped it superbly"
firm push to point
"full on the pads, flicked to deep midwicket"
"class written all over it. Not a half-volley by any means, but it doesn't matter. Marsh plants his front foot forward and simply caresses that into the gap between cover and mid-off."

"too full, worked to deep midwicket, again"
swept straight to short fine leg this time
"steps out and chips it over the infield, didn't control it well, on the bounce to Quiney coming in from long-on"

"dabbed to point, quick single taken. A direct hit courtesy an under-arm flick from Luke Wright coming in from point would have made it really interesting. In fact, you can go as far as saying it was an opportunity missed"

width and he's crashed it to sweeper cover

"cramped for room, mistimes an attempted pull to midwicket"
"helped into the fine leg boundary. Poor, simply poor. Called leg byes. Oh, dear. The batsman wouldn't be too happy"
"pulled and he's picked the bones out of it. Fine leg was in with a shout but it was all too brief. Voges took his eyes off the ball but went through with the shot, it helped that it was the short boundary"
"width and he's crashed that behind point. No chance for third man. Expensive over, the scales have turned and how"
"heaves a pull and boy, he's hit that off the middle. Hit so well that the square leg umpire had to take evasive action on a hurry"

driven through the line into the gap at deep cover
"slower leg-cutter on off stump, deflected to short third man"
punched into the gap at deep cover for an easy single
