"and he strikes first ball! Perfect start for Rising Pune. Possibly an offcutter outside off, Guptill throws his hands at the ball. He flat-bats it in the air, and Tiwary leaps and takes it over his head at short cover. Good catch"
"good length and angling away outside off, Marsh presses forward and dabs it to cover"
"full and outside off, Marsh presses forward and defends to the off side again"
"shortens his length outside off, angling away, Marsh opens the face and steers the ball straight to point"
"another slower ball outside off, 14ks slower than the previous ball. Sticks in the surface, Marsh does not pick the change up. Drives early and spoons it to the left of a diving Tiwary at short covers"
"seam-up. Short of a length and skids on off stump, 137ks, cramps the left-hander for room. Marsh eyes up the leg side but ends up fending it back down the pitch"

<strong>edged and dropped by Dhoni diving to his right</strong>. Reluctant dive. He has always been reluctant to dive. Bursts out of the right glove. Dhoni was late to react. Full and angling away outside off - seam-up - Saha reaches out with hard hands for a drive and nicks it. Dhoni can't cling on. Christian at wide slip - almost second slip - had no chance to take it on the rebound either. How much will this repirve cost Pune?
"really full on the pads, right there for the flick, but Marsh does not connect"
"slower offcutter, ends up on Saha's pads, he picks it up and flicks it in the air over square leg. The ball swirls over the boundary"

He does not bang his head against the turf for a change"

leg-side wide
"length on off, chopped away to deep third man"
"It's that man: Unadkat, again! He dives full-length to his left from short fine leg and takes it with both hands. Tewatia's promition has backfired. Another cross-seamer. Another one that bounces on leg stump. Cramps the batsman for room who attempts to flick but instead lobs a catch to Unadkat at 45"
