"a hint of movement away from the bat makes Rohit be circumspect as he defends towards midwicket. Excellent, full length there, and right on target too"
"pitches it up and makes Rohit play with soft hands on off stump. Again, there's the tiniest bit of shape away from the right-hander"
"<b>crashes it</b>! The moment he sees width, he knows he can throw his hands at it and powers it away behind the point fielder. Southee's first attempt to bowl from wide of the crease is a #fail"
tighter on off stump now and Rohit blocks
opens the face and steers the back of a length ball to point
lets go a good length ball outside off
hits the deck and makes Rahul get up off his toes to blunt the ball to point
"shortish and outside off, he waits on the ball and juist guides it to the sweeper"
<b>launches it</b>! He gets under the short ball and upper cuts it very very powerfully. There is a third man on the boundary but he needs to be about 10 feet tall to catch that
"with no room on this short ball, he absorbs the pace, blocks it by his feet and sprints through for a single"
"<b>good save</b>! Munro is at deep third man, racing to his right to stop the ball from trickling to the rope. It isn't often a ball whacked by Rohit doesn't reach the rope, and this really is whacked, right over point"
"off the front foot now and this too nearly goes to the fence! Rohit has decided to tee off. Sets his usual steady base. Doesn't care the ball is a bit back of a length. Goes through with a thwack down the ground, over mid-on, and nearly gets four"
"good length and outside off, Rahul defends to point"
punches the shortish delivery on off stump to the sweeper
"<b>carves it</b> through point again and the ball is racing to the left of Santner, who does extremely well to cut it off. Rohit is holding nothing back!"
steps out of his crease now and is cramped by the bowler. Good work from Southee. He knows he's in a battle
"<b>ramps it</b> right over the keeper. This is a ridiculous shot, mainly because, Rahul, after backing away, finds a short ball coming right at his head. But calmly, as if he is in no danger whatsoever, he sways his torso away and lifts the ball up and over"
"back of a length on middle, he works it through midwicket"
deals with a short ball coming up above his shoulder with a whippy sort of pull shot behind square leg
"<b>that's a ripper!</b>. Not only does it straighten off the angle, there is beastly extra bounce, surprising Rohit. He originally thinks it's a length ball and it's there to be slogged across the line, but then has to check his shot and <b>could easily have been caught out had there been a first slip</b>"
"good length ball outside off, dabs it through point"
"looks for the quick single, knocking the ball by his feet, but Kuggeleijn is alert enough"
opens the face and guides a shortish ball on off stump to third man
"looks for the front foot pull, but this ball skids into him, making him mistimes his shot into midwicket"
"<b>glorious shot</b>! It is merely an extension of defence, the bat pushing on, with an open face, intending for the gap between backward and cover point. And once he hits that gap, pure timing takes it through to the boundary."
<b>beats him</b> with a sweetly tossed up ball that hits the pitch before Rohit can reach it and then turns right past his outside edge
"dabs it past Taylor's right, waiting ever so well on the good length ball outside off"
"tosses it up on off stump, he defends with an open face to find a single behind point"
"quicker delivery, sliding into the batsman's pads, Rohit flicks through square leg"
"loopy delivery on middle, he nudges it through midwicket"
"yorker on middle, works it through midwicket"
<b>and awaaaaaaaay she goes</b>! Rohit gets the chance to get under the ball - a knuckle ball - and he swings it miles over the square leg fence
"<b>down the ground</b>! Width on offer. In addition to the chance to get under the ball. That's just asking for trouble against Rohit, who just plants his front leg down and swings through the line"
<b>cuts it away</b>. Too short. Too wide. Too easy. And sooooo gooood from Rohit.
"<b>puuuuuuure timing</b>! Bennett does his best to find the blockole and he actually kinda does. He also tries to hide the ball from Rohit, wiiiiide outside off, but the batsman is able to reach it, crouching down low as the ball arrives, and just slices it behind point"
"<b>hacks it over the bowler and that's fifty</b>! Dude was only 24 at the start of this over! What a hitter! He feels in such form he can toy with the bowler - which he does here, walking across off stump, knowing he will try to keep the ball away from his reach. Now the ball is right in his wheelhouse - overpitched and within reach - and he swats it straight down the ground"
"tosses it up on leg stump, works it through midwicket"
"goes round-arm this ball, and Rohit launches into a cut shot. NZ are lucky he finds the point fielder"
"pulls all the pace off as he targets leg stump, bowling it as full as he dares to. Rohit respects the effort, knocking it down for a single to midwicket"
"shapes to hit against the turn, looking for long-on, and gets a leading edge to long-off"
presses forward to a full ball on leg stump and pushes it to long-on
<b>whacks it</b> down the ground! Just a tiny bit overpitched and Rahul gives himself the room he needs to hammer the ball down the ground. Beautiful T20 batting
"fires it in on leg stump, Rohit blocks down the pitch"
"<b>just short of deep square leg</b>! Ross Taylor's the man there, and with the ball dipping he is in two minds, eventually decides to go for the catch but the ball hits the turf too soon and he does well thereafter to stop the boundary. Sweep shot from Rohit, in case you were wondering"
stays on his back foot and waits for the good length ball to almost pass him before he late cuts it away
goes for another sweep but this ball is a little too far outside off and he isn't able to drag it properly. Only gets a top edge over the keeper
"good length, outside off, pokes it to point"
times this sweep better - even though the ball is well outside off - largely because he is looking to play it along the ground. Single to deep midwicket
dabs it behind point
knocks a fuller ball on off stump down to long-on
"comes down the track to hit a length ball down the ground, but CdG gets down in time to stop the runs"
bit of an outside edge as Rohit throws his bat at a full ball outside off. Runs off past the left of short third man
a little shape away from the right-hander as Rohit guides the pitched up ball towards point
"<b>taken at point</b>! CdG's first over of the series and he's already a wicket-taker! It's all a little contrived, the batsman leaping so far outside leg stump that a back of a length ball on off stump becomes cuttable. But the problem is there is also a tiny bit of extra bounce, which means Rahul's intended dab for a single behind point ends up a simple catch to point."
"Bennett down at deep third man does well, moving quickly to his left to stop the late cut from Rohit."
cramps him on leg stump and Dube isn't able to get bat on the flick shot. Rohit though is alert to the chance of a leg bye
"slower ball outside off, Rohit turns it in front of square leg"
"<b>beats him</b> as Dube looks to upper cut a bit of a slower short ball, which is again not giving any room to work with"
"this time a proper bouncer - at pace - and he beats Dube for it, the batsman trying another upper cut and failing"
"full on middle and leg, Dube is again forced just to defend and he is starting to feel antsy."
"full, angling into off stump, driven to the left of mid-off"
"back of a length, angling across to off stump. Lets it come on and guides to third man with an open face"
"shapes to make room and Bennett makes him reach for the ball with a full one wide of off stump. Jabbed to extra-cover, can't place it far enough to his left to beat him"
"gone, this is good bowling. Slower ball, knuckle ball, on the fuller side of a good length and fairly wide of off stump. Again he makes Rohit reach out, and he loses his shape while looking to hit over the top. I think he was looking to go over mid-off, but he's early on the shot, his bottom hand comes off the handle, and he ends up dragging a simple catch to long-on"
"short on leg stump, gets a little cramped on the pull but manages to swat it away to the right of deep square leg"
"another. Two in three balls. Back of a length, slanting away from off stump. Slashes hard at it without moving his feet, and as a result he isn't close enough to the line to be able to place it where he wants. Slices it into the hands of third man"
"tossed up on leg stump, clipped down to long-on"
"shortish, spinning from middle to off. Looks to cut but the ball gets a little big on him and he checks his shot to chop towards backward point"
"tossed up slow on off stump, gets on the front foot for a gentle push into the covers"
"slowish length ball on middle and leg, Kohli gets his front pad out of the way and pushes to cover"
"short, stops on the batsman as it spins away from off stump. Wants to slap it to the sweeper for one, but he ends up dragging it to extra cover"
"full on off stump, driven to long-off"
"slower ball, angling down leg. Looks to flick, misses, only manages a bit of pad on it into the square leg region"
"slower ball, back of a length, on off stump. Lets it come on and defends with soft hands into the on side"
"full, swinging away into a wide, sixth-stump line. Driven to the right of sweeper cover"
gentle length ball on off stump. Waits on the back foot and dabs to short third man
"fullish on off stump, driven to long-off"
"again that gentle outswing. Fullish, starts just outside off. Looks to whip it to long-on, and the bowler sticks out his right hand to half-stop it"
"flat legbreak down the leg side, swept nice and fine, into the gap to the right of short fine leg"
"shortish on off stump, gets on the back foot and flat-bats to extra-cover. Probably wanted to hit it squarer, but the ball stopped on him a little"
"flat on off stump, sweeps hard but straight to short fine leg, who's stationed quite square"
flat length ball on off stump. Defends with soft hands to pick up a single into the point region
"fullish, angling into middle and leg, driven firmly but straight back to the bowler"
"shortish, spinning away from off stump. Makes some room and carves it to the left of sweeper cover"
length ball sliding in towards off stump. Gets on the front foot for a push into the point region
"a touch too full, and Kohli pounces on it. Fairly flat, on an off-stump line, and Kohli moves his front foot away from the line of the ball to loft this inside-out, effortlessly, over the extra-cover boundary"
"flat length ball on middle and leg, tucked into the midwicket region"
"length ball angling into middle stump. Wants to punch that towards long-on, but the ball stops and spins a bit, and he pushes it back to the bowler"
"length ball on off stump, makes some room and stabs to deep point"
"bam. Loopy full-toss wide of off stump, and Kohli gets down low to swipe it powerfully between long-on and deep midwicket"
"shortish outside off, gets back and across to cut, but can't beat backward point"
"length ball outside off, goes back again to cut, and again he can't find the gap, as Munro dives right from backward point to cut it off"
"again that wide line outside off, and Iyer slaps to the off-side sweeper to get off strike"
"short, spins away sharply from an off-stump line, and Kohli drags a pull out to deep midwicket"
"a bit slower now, just short of a length and spinning away from off stump. Cut away to the sweeper at deep cover point"
"floaty full ball, wide of off stump. Brings his wrists into play to whip that to long-on. Good defensive over to end an excellent defensive spell"
"flat, back of a length, speared in towards off stump. Flat-batted down to long-on"
"shot. Iyer can really hit the spinners out of the park. This was full, speared into leg stump, and the effort was to deny the batsman swinging room. But he quickly got his front leg out of the way and hit it cleanly back over the bowler;s head, with a lot of bat-speed generated by his bottom wrist"
"tossed up a little slower on leg stump, and Iyer slogs, looking to go over midwicket. Grips and turns, and a thick edge flies past the keeper's right shoulder"
"back of a length on off stump, makes room and dabs gently towards short third man"
"fuller, on middle and leg, clipped away through square leg"
"excellent change of pace, and Iyer departs. Hung it up invitingly on a leg-stump line, and Iyer goes hard at the inside-out drive. But the ball was slower than usual, and dropped a little shorter than the batsman expected. Through his shot early, carves through thin air, and drags his back foot out of the crease. Seifert completes a quick stumping"
"back of a length, angling into the pads, tucked away through backward square leg"
"sees Kohli looking to make room, and follows him with a back-of-a-length offcutter that rips in like an offbreak towards his right elbow. Looks to chop into the off side, ends up inside-edging into his body and the ball almost rolls back onto off stump"
slower length ball on leg stump as Pandey looks to create room. Pushed down to long-off for one
"full-toss on off stump, whipped away to the left of deep square leg"
"back of a length, angling into the hip to deny Kohli room. Worked to short fine leg"
"knows Pandey likes to stay leg-side of the ball and make himself room, and looks to make him reach for the ball with a slower ball along a wide line. Ends up bowling it far too wide of off stump"
"slower length ball outside off, flat-batted to long-off"
"short, fairly wide outside off, and that's an excellent shot from Pandey. He was moving away from leg stump, looking to make room, and ended up a long way from the line of the ball. Jumps across, and slaps the ball away to the boundary between sweeper cover and long-off, meeting the ball with both feet off the ground"
"back of a length outside off, jabbed through cover point"
"slower length ball on off stump, swiped hard to the right of long-on"
"slower length ball on off stump, muscled into the gap between long-on and deep midwicket, but can't find enough power to beat both to the boundary"
"gone. The slower balls are really gripping today. This one's slightly wider outside off, and having failed to muscle the ball to the leg-side boundary off the last two balls, he looks to go off-side this time. Can't make himself enough room to really drive through the ball, and the ball pops up at catching height to Southee falling to his left at extra-cover"
"short, sits up on off stump, pulled to deep square leg"
"slower ball on off stump, back of a length. Makes a bit of room and jabs to backward point"
"another slower ball, but on this occasion he misses his length and serves up a half-volley outside off. Not wide enough to force Pandey to reach for the ball, and he frees his arms and launches a clean, massive hit over long-on"
"another slower ball. The length is better this time, but the line is wrong, too wide of off stump, and Pandey simply leaves it alone"
"wide-ish yorker, jabbed to the sweeper at deep point"
"oh dear. That's a dolly <b>put down</b> at deep midwicket. Length ball angling away from off stump, Jadeja clears his front leg and slogs against the angle. Santner comes in off the boundary, and lets the simplest of chances slip through his grasp"
"shot! Short slower ball, angling away from off stump, and Jadeja punches it away, with arms at full extension, to find the gap between long-off and sweeper cover"
"slower ball to finish, fuller on this occasion, and Jadeja, down the track, looks to push into the off side and is beaten by the lack of pace and a bit of turn off the surface. They steal a bye as the ball rolls to the keeper"
"good length on off stump, with a teensy bit of away movement, Guptill defends watchfully"
"<b>BANG!</b>. The new ball is the best time to go big and Guptill takes full toll, stepping out of his crease to pick up a length ball and pummeling it over the bowler. The ball sails over the camera crew, high up in a makeshift structure"
taps a fuller delivery that cramps him to mid-on and sprints through for a well-judged single
"this is no surprise anymore. The moment Munro is on strike, the ball is at his hips, cramping his bat-swing. He stills has no solution to it, only indulging in a flick behind square leg"
"full and outside off, Guptill isn't expecting it there, especially not the away swing that takes it further away from his attempted cover drive"
"back of a length slower ball on middle, Guptill spots it a bit late, meaning he can only block it. Good finish to the over."
"again, he's not able to deal with a short ball coming up to his stomach. Munro tries to flick it, but only gets an inside edge off the thigh pad and into the covers"
"angles into the right-hander on middle, Guptill works it through midwicket"
"he's cramped up again, going for the pull shot, but again, with no room to work with, he only mistimes the ball to the left of the bowler's followthrough. <b>High-quality execution of a well-thought out plan from India</b>"
allows the short ball to come to him and then uses soft hands to pat it down towards cover
and the first pitched up ball to him is right at the stumps. Munro defends back to the bowler. This will come down to patience. Munro needs to bide his time
"slower ball on leg stump, which he goes down to sweep, gets and inside edge that bounces off his pad towards where short fine leg might have been"
punches a back of a length ball on off stump to point
"good stuff. Munro has little choice but to defend at a quick, short ball on off stump. But since he does so with soft hands, he has the chance for a quick single. He's not panicking. Good signs for NZ"
"backs away and slaps it to the third man boundary.... does it carry?! Shami's there! He leaps! Sticks out a hand! Doesn't get it! He comes soooo close to it, but he couldn't leap far enough to his left. Bumrah isn't particularly impressed."
nudges a length ball on middle and leg stump to midwicket
"<b>ramps it</b>! Glorious shot! To a ball that looks to knock his block off, he sways away from the line and offers the full face of the bat for it to bounce off and go to the boundary behind him and the wicketkeeper"
"good length, on the stumps, defends to point"
jacks his front leg up for a full swing of the bat and the pull shot finds a run at deep square leg
works a back of a length ball on leg stump to deep square leg
"outside edgeeeeee and it sails over short third man! It's the first time he has the chance to free his arms - and it may well have been intentional. That's why Shami bowls it slow, to lure the batsman into the big hit, the release shot, and maybe get him out while he's anxious to score quick runs"
"backs away, trying to one-up the bowler who keeps cramping him up, but here Shami adjusts his line, bowls short and outside off and keeps it out of Munro's reach"
"<b>takes a hit in the ribs</b> and he's somehow able to complete the single before going down in a heap! Shami's very quick and this short ball certainly gives Munro nowhere to hide. He tries a pull shot but with the ball coming at him in such high pace, with it getting up so high, and giving him no room to free the arms, he's always gonna come in second best. The physio's out. <b>Munro is able to sit up</b>. Looks very red in the face, but he looks okay outside of that, gets in a drink of water, gets up and is ready to go again"
"looks for a tap and run behind point, but it's Jadeja's prowling that area and taking him on is not wise"
"<b>nails the sweep</b>. The ball is on leg stump. It's flat and quick, so he has the pace to work with. Plus fine leg is up."
"<b>cuts him in half</b> with a slow, good length legbreak that pitches on off stump and spins so sharply. Munro is trying to make room to slap it away through point, but the turn is just too much and it beats his inside edge and the keeper too"
"<b>caaaatch</b> is the cry as Guptill goes for a backfoot punch through cover and gets a thick edge. Kohli is at first slip, he reaches his right hand out, and only gets the fingertips. Lovely bowling from Chahal, keeping the pace down, giving himself the legbreak the best chance to grip into this pitch and turn"
"quicker ball on middle, Guptill defends"
"<b>lovely bowling</b>. There's drift on his ball, making Guptill get down and sweep it. But then the ball pitches and spins sharply and only just bounces over the stumps. Beautiful, <i>brave</i> spin bowling."
flicks it towards midwicket
"tries to drop and run, but Munro isn't so keen on it. The ball barely even went past the stumps"
goes for the upper cut again but this time there's just enough pace and bounce on this short ball to beat the bat
"whacks it! Poor execution on the slower ball - it's the right plan, they have to take the pace off, but Thakur makes the mistake of giving Guptill sooooo much room outside off. Four through midwicket"
"<b>wicket off a long hop</b>! New Zealand were soooo close to getting through this Powerplay and then going up a gear. Guptill sees a short and wide delivery. He knows he has to power to smash it away. And so he goes for the shot. A very powerful cut shot. Problem is, he's hit it straight to the only man India have deep on the off side. Should do better there, really should do better with the placement"
"<b>nearly bowls him</b> and Rahul misses it behind the stumps! Ridiculous delivery, by the way. Thakur pushes it outside off but it swings in so very late. It's a blockhole ball too. Munro looks to whack it but he's soundly beaten. So is the keeper. Replays show it's a knuckle ball."
short and at his hips. Munro isn't able to pull it away
goes for the inside out drive to long-off
"<b>easy as that</b>! India keep piling dot-ball pressure on Munro. They make him go for these wild shots. Otherwise why would he charge out of his crease for the first ball he faces from Jadeja? This is brilliant, relentless bowling as a team. Even the spinner refuses him any room. Munro looks to make some of his own and slog a length ball on off stump out of the park, loses his shape entirely and Rahul does the rest."
<b>cuts him in half</b> and it only just bounces over off stump. Jadeja's 97 kph dart meets a failing cut shot as Santner gives himself room. The turn and bounces is a little too much for the new batsman
nudges a shortish delivery on leg stump to deep square leg
"the turn on the ball makes it hard for Williamson to reach out to it, especially seeing as he's making room again. Finds extra cover with the cut"
"eases the tossed up ball into the off side, but that inner ring is packed"
"back of a length on off stump, taps it down to long-on"
steps out to lift a back of a length ball - it's back of a length because Dube sees Williamson's charge - over point
"<b>excellent shot</b>! He doesn't really have the room to pull the ball, but it's still a short ball and Santner backs himself to whack it over midwicket"
"short and well wide of off stump this time, Santner carves it to third man"
"<b>awaaaaaaay she goes</b>! Good work from NZ. They're targeting the allrounder, Williamson going across his crease to scoop a length over the shortest boundary in a very big ground. Excellent stuff"
"offcutter now, and Williamson backs away to flat-bat it down the ground. Dube is only a few inches away from pulling off a ridiculous return catch. But his followthrough is taking him the wrong way so he really has no chance"
"gooooood ball! He sees Williamson trying to hit inside out and pushes his line closer to the batsman, denying him that room. Williamson adjusts to block through point"
hits him on the pad as a length ball breaks into him sharply while Santner tries to flick it
"backs away and flicks a flatter, quicker delivery on leg stump right through midwicket. Misfield there gives up a run"
"slow and full on off stump, Williamson is happy to block through cover"
"it's there to whack over the leg side and he tries to, but the extra bite Jadeja is getting off this pitch ensures Santner's slog becomes an inside edge off the body to third man"
steps away from the ball on leg stump to tap it through to the sweeper.
spears a fuller ball outside off to the sweeper
"<b>soooo goood</b>. These slower balls from Bumrah are almost better than his yorkers! Pitches on a fullish length and then breaks away like an offspinner's stock ball. And on top of all that, there is zero change in action. The arm still comes down just as quick and Santner's done"
"<b>Jadeja drops it! Ravindra Jadeja has dropped a catch</b>! That should tell you this was a difficult one! 'I don't think I've seen that before,' says Mike Hesson on commentary. Santner pops up a leading edge as he tries to flick a back of a length ball angled across him. It goes so very high. Jadeja is having to backtrack from point. He has to watch the ball over his shoulder. He almost ends up overrunning it. As a result, he needs to bend his body back to take it reverse cup and it pops out. Could have left it up to the man running in from third man"
<b>lovelyyyyyy</b>. Williamson reads a short ball. He sees a gap a third man. He gets inside the line and just steers it away.
"back of a length outside off, taps it to point"
"good length, outside off, guides it to third man"
"starts with a short one which he pulls strongly to the left of deep square leg. Shami's there, he makes the ground, so much so he overruns the ball."
"<B>another misfield</b>. It's slow and short and Williamson wants to make the most of it so he plays a fairly agricultural flick shot, going for power and placement. Dube has to run to his right from long-on and he completely mucks it up. Bangs the turf in frustration"
"full and outside off, he steers it through the covers"
"<b>through him</b>! He has tried to play that flick shot off middle stump all day but every time he's missed it. Here, to add to his misery, the legbreak stays low enough to crash into his castle"
"flat slider on middle and leg, hangs back and punches it back to the bowler"
"wrong'un, and de Grandhomme is pinned to the crease, can't pick it at all. Was looking to punch off the back foot, and it beat his inside edge by a long way to hit back pad. Big appeal, but it was sliding down leg"
"flat length ball on middle and leg, pushed into the covers. Was shaping to work it leg side, but it gripped and turned so he had to adjust"
"flat slider on middle stump, makes a bit of room and punches to long-off"
"length ball close to off stump, stays leg-side of the ball and jabs to backward point, where Dube misfields and allows a quick single"
"appeal for stumping as Jadeja beats Williamson's big inside-out drive with a clever change of pace. Dangled up slow outside off, and Williamson, too early into his shot, overbalances and drags his back foot out of the crease. Has he dragged it back in time? It's mighty close... Close enough for the TV umpire to ask for a magnification of foot and crease.  Benefit of doubt goes with the batsman in the end"
"flat, back of a length, on leg stump. Worked into the square leg region"
"flat length ball angling in towards leg stump, punched firmly back to the bowler"
"tossed up on middle and off, nice stretch forward to clip to long-on"
"flat length ball on middle stump, makes some room and punches to deep point"
"shot. A little bit of flight on middle stump, and he gets a big stretch out for the flat slog-sweep, over the boundary to the right of deep midwicket"
"flat length ball on off stump, chopped down towards short third man. CdG's bat got struck in the turf just before he made his crease, and if Rahul had gathered the throw quicker, he may have been in trouble"
"slower now, spinning away from off stump. Has a big sweep at it and misses"
"wrong'un, a touch short and spinning in towards middle stump. Makes room and chops to backward point"
"shortish, nips in a little from a fifth-stump line. Wants to punch through the covers, gets an inside edge into the midwicket region instead"
back of a length outside off. Takes a big step back and across and ends up a little too close to the line to manufacture any power. Punched straight to backward point
"short, wide, and like Rahul and Guptill have done earlier today, Williamson carves underneath the ball and uppercuts it all the way over the backward point boundary"
"back of a length, nips in a little from outside off, punched to the sweeper at deep cover point"
"shortish in the corridor outside off, chopped to the right of backward point"
"slower short ball outside off, and that's brilliantly done by Williamson to bring up his fifty. Steps right across, holds his shape, and pulls into the gap to the left of long leg"
"flat length ball on a wide-ish line outside off, sharp spin away. De Grandhomme looks to launch it over cover and misses"
"a touch shorter on off stump. Makes room and cuts towards backward point and sets off for a quick single. A little risky, but he makes it in time to beat Jadeja collecting and disturbing the stumps. Direct hit may have been interesting"
"not for the first time today, extra bounce saves the batsman. Looks to punch through cover off the back foot, making room, and the ball spins, beats his bat, and misses the top of middle"
"stunning. A bit of flight, and it wasn't all that full, but he got a big stride forward to half-sweep, half-loft it straight back over the bowler's head"
"and inevitably, after that big stretch out, the next ball is a short one, and Williamson is ready to pounce, rocks back and pulls way over the midwicket boundary"
"flat, back of a length, on off stump, punched to deep point"
"shot. Half-volley angling into leg stump, and he sashays to the leg side to make himself room and loft inside-out over long-off"
"bouncer, angling down leg slightly. Williamson ducks under it"
"back of a length close to off stump, dabbed to the right of the left-handed Jadeja at backward point"
"back of a length on off stump, creates a bit of room and slaps it powerfully, all along the ground, to deep point"
"low full-toss outside off, whipped to deep midwicket with a roll of the wrists"
"got him. That was full and angling in towards off stump, and the shot over extra-cover was on, but in the effort to make a bit of room, his front leg had stepped too far towards the leg side, causing his weight to go that way, and the bat to come down at an angle. Thick edge flies straight to the man at short third man"
"there's the wide-ish slower ball that he's used so well through this series. Williamson swings too early, looking to smash that through the off side, and misses"
"this is a game of small margins, and they're going New Zealand's way today. Another slower ball outside off, quite full, and he plays a sliced drive that hangs in the air for a while before dropping down to the right of deep point. Desperate effort, but he can't get to it"
"length ball, closer to off stump now, and Williamson steps across to whip it up and over square leg. Super shot"
"shot. Bumrah's gone away from the slower ball, the last two balls, and Williamson has taken toll. Full and a lot of width, not full enough to deny Williamson elevation, and he lifts it over extra-cover to pick up another boundary"
"off-stump yorker, almost perfectly executed, and Williamson jams his bat down and jabs it back to the bowler"
"yorker on middle and leg this time, clipped towards square leg. The fielder there, moving to his left, picks up and throws at the bowler's end, misses, and concedes an overthrow"
"flat slider on middle stump, goes deep in his crease and works it into the vacant midwicket region. Perfect weight on the shot to pick up two runs by the time the fielder comes in off the boundary"
"tossed up slightly wide of off. Looks to sweep but it's a little too full, and he drags it along the ground into the backward square leg region, off the bottom edge"
"flighted ball on leg stump, swept to the left of deep square leg"
"shortish legbreak wide of off stump, flat-batted to the right of the cover sweeper. They run two, and Jadeja, aiming for the keeper's end, throws too wide to put any pressure on the batsmen"
"shortish on middle stump, slides on to cramp Williamson on the pull. Hits it uppishly, but it lands well short of the man at deep midwicket"
"full-toss on middle and leg, whipped to deep backward square leg"
"not this ball. Taylor must have expected the slower ball, but he got the full-pace length ball in the corridor, Test-match style. A bit of leg-cut, and it beats his outside edge as he looks to drive into the covers"
"bam. Well done by Taylor. Another full-pace length ball, but Taylor has shuffled across in advance to be able to take it from outside off stump and whip it to the forward square leg boundary"
"near-yorker on middle stump, clipped to the left of deep backward square leg"
"shot! Bumrah had sent fine leg back, and he more or less nailed this middle-and-leg yorker. Williamson steps across, flicks - if he misses, he's bowled - and beats the diving fine leg fielder to his right"
"in the blockhole again, on off stump. Jabbed to backward point"
"full on off stump, whipped to deep midwicket, and New Zealand need nine off the last over to win this."
"probably not. Full-toss, angling into off stump, and Taylor clears his front leg and muscles this all the way over the leg-side boundary, to the right of deep midwicket"
"looks for the blockhole now, just outside off, whipped to long-on"
"gone! Out of nowhere! Shami bangs in a short ball outside off stump. He has a gully in place, and there's a gap between that fielder and the keeper. Looks to dab it there, but doesn't get enough on it, and Rahul can fall to his right and snap up the edge near his right shoulder"
"short outside off. The field was set for the short ball. It was there for the slash, but this is a new batsman, and he's a little late on it and he misses"
"another play and miss! Another short ball outside off, and the bounce is steep once more. Seifert is off his feet, looking to slash, but the bounce beats his edge. Taylor immediately sets off for the bye, Seifert responds, and Rahul, rolling the ball to the stumps at his end, misses"
"bowled him, this is going into a Super Over! What a finish. Full outside off, almost in the blockhole, around fiftth-stump in line. Taylor looks to slog into the leg side, and inside-edges into his stumps."
