"pitched up on off stump, 81mph/130kph and met with a solid block into the covers"
"sprayed well down the leg side, Gabriel stuttering up to the crease and unloading the most innocuous of looseners"

"going on straight, past the inside edge, <b>up goes the finger!</b> Is that the breakthrough, on the stroke of lunch?? Burns <b>reviews</b>, but he doesn't look confident, particularly if there's no bat involved. Shocker from Burns, hitting the top third of middle stump, that's as plumb as they come! Chase retains his status as an bogey bowler for England, and that'll perk up the Windies going in for <b>lunch</b>"
"<strong>would you believe it?!</strong> Chase is on a hat-trick! Length ball, bit of spin, Crawley looks to flick round the corner and Holder <strong>takes a low catch at leg slip!</strong> What a start to the session for West Indies, but not a particularly clever shot from Crawley"

pitched up in the channel and again he shoulders arms - couple of easy sighters for the new man
"rapped on the back leg, celebrappeal from Broad... Umpire Gough shakes his head, but England <b>review</b>. We know what Broad thinks, but what about Hawk-Eye?

Fired at the pegs and Brooks was trapped bang in front of middle and off, <i>maybe</i> stayed a little low.

"length ball on the hip, steered round the corner"
"struck on the pad, and <strong>given!</strong> Slightly full of a length, and this looked pretty good to the naked eye... yep, Brathwaite won't bother with a review. Struck above the knee roll on the back pad, looking to defend from under his eyes, but looked adjacent"

"<strong>bowled him!</strong> Hope is cut in half, good length ball which nips in off the seam, flies between bat and pad as Hope gropes at it, and whacks into the top of off! Hope got in a real tangle there, but there's little shame in that against a brute of a delivery"

"struck on the pad, Broad goes up, he's convinced... but <strong>Illingworth says no</strong>! Root <strong>sends it upstairs</strong>.

"<b>whipped off the pads</b>, that will race away, Chase is pretty strong there and he picks up his first boundary"
"nip-backer, no shot, <b>up goes the finger!</b> And Chase won't review, though it looked a tight one to me... Broad was off and running with his arm raised, like Alan Shearer in his pomp, but although Chase looked pretty peeved with the decision, he chooses not to quarrel with it. Shaving off stump?

"short again, 83mph/135kph and at the body, Joseph gets tucked up but the ball falls safely"
"overpitched, <b>Joseph drills four down the ground!</b> He can certainly play the on-drive, young Alzarri... but can he block it for 20 overs?"
"pitched up and he drives again, high front elbow and Stokes takes umbrage, fielding in his follow through and hurling wide of Buttler to give them an overthrow"
"flighted, spinning to hit the front pad, appeal turned down by Richard Illingworth but Root <b>reviews</b>... Joseph playing no shot, but it looked leg side more than anything, and Hawk-Eye backs it up"
"spins from outside off, does that clip the inside edge on its way to short leg... Yes, says Illingworth, but Joseph <b>reviews!</b> Looks like another good use of the DRS by West Indies, because that has missed the bat by some distance. Richard Kettleborough, the third umpire, checks lbw just to be sure, but that's missing, too, so Joseph will survive"
"pushed through, this pops into the off side with Joseph propping forwards"
"tossed up, Joseph clears the front leg and hacks one down the ground to long-on. That's one way to bat for a draw"
"flighted, defended on the front foot"
tossed up and Roach props out to block again
"length outside off, lifts viciously off the surface and flies past Joseph's dangling bat"
"bumper at the left shoulder, ducks out of its way"
"full outside off, Joseph frees his arms and <strong>slashes this hard</strong> through cover. It dribbles out towards the boundary, but Bess catches up with it and Roach settles for two"
"back of a length, Joseph gets in a mess of a position and it thuds into his thigh pad. Appeal from Buttler, but always going over"
"back of a length, inside edged into the ground and <strong>not far away from a drag-on!</strong>"
"fullish outside off, looks for the drive again and <strong>chips it straight to Bess behind square!</strong> Looked to drive through mid-off, but the bat turned in his hand and it flew right at Bess, in at backward point. No need to play at that, but Alzarri couldn't resist"
"tickled round the corner down to fine leg for a couple, via the pad"
"groping forward at a length ball outside off, a bit of bounce out of the rough and past Roach's lunge"
strides forward to defend with soft hands
"leans forward in defence, <strong>finds the outside edge</strong> but bounces short of Stokes at slip"
dead-batted from outside off
"sharp turn and bounce, <strong>flicks the glove</strong> as he looks to turn it round the corner and lands where leg slip might have been"
"back of a length, firmly defended by Gabriel"
"short ball, Gabriel stares it down then ducks underneath it"
"short ball at the left shoulder, ducks underneath it"
"spears a yorker down the leg side, left alone"
lunges forward to defend with a straight bat
"good turn from outside off, rocks back to defend solidly enough"
"full and straight, nudged into the leg side"
"<strong>struck on the pad</strong> lunging forward to defend, but hit outside the line despite England's appeal"
"comes forward to defend again, sharp bounce out the foot marks to beat the outside edge"
"big stride forward, inside-edges into the pad"
"speared in with a round arm, Roach prods into the off side. 57mph/92kph"
"full on the pads, <strong>short-arm slog-sweep</strong> from Roach away for four! Good option to attack with so many men waiting for a defensive shot, and he nails this through square"
"length outside off, Gabriel stands tall and clips him to mid-on"
"goes straight on, past the defensive push"
"good turn from outside off, strikes Gabriel on the thigh pad"
comes forward to defend with soft hands
"speared in with a round arm, a bit of turn, but Gabriel's defensive prod is confident enough"
"comes forward to defend, Root beats the outside edge. Buttler whips the bails off, but Gabriel's back foot is fine"
"<strong>stunning catch from Pope at short leg!</strong> That's some way to seal it. Bess was full from round the wicket, Roach nudged into the leg side. Pope parried it up from knee height, then flung himself at full stretch to his left to take the rebound catch, and <strong>England win by 113 runs!</strong>"
