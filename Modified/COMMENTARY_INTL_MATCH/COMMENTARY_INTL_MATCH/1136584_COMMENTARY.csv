"slightly full outside off and not much swing, QdK reaches out and steers it to cover point"
"nice inswing this time from outside off and on good length, de Lock punches it towards mid off and gets off the mark"
"pitches it short to Kohli and gets some away movement, Kohli stays back and defends it to the leg side"
bit too full on middle and leg and Kohli flicks it away almost nonchalantly over midwicket for a cracking four. Excellent timing
"brings it touch shorter now and much straighter with that outswing, Kohli defends it back"
"back of length outside off, Kohli hangs back and punches it to cover"
"too full outside off and some swing for him too, de Kock reaches out to drive but doesn't middle it"
"walks down the track this time, Thakur sends it down towards the pads and he gets an inside edge behind square on the leg side"
"the crowd loves it! Because this is pitched up, there's some outswing and there's Kohli driving that over mid off beautifully from the middle of the bat"
"still too full, Kohli drives along the ground this time through the covers and gets two"
"he pitches it a touch shorter, Kohli waits and steers to cover point patiently"
taps the back of length ball outside off nicely and steals a single to keep strike
back of length again and tapped to point by Kohli again for one more single
"top edge, it goes really really high and just avoids Dhoni who runs back all the way and then flicks the ball inside the boundary to save two. De Kock pulled the short ball and his heart must have been in his mouth after that went high, but it went back over the keeper"
"smokes it for six this time! Bit fuller, de Kock leans into it and slams that over the long-on boundary with the inswing"
"makes some room this time, it's a slower ball and he patiently pushes it into off for one"
"another slower ball, it's full and Kohli picks it to flick it with those mighty wrists, it's going fast towards the midwicket boundary where Billing dives to keep it in, but the ball is rolling towards the boundary again and we have the third umpire looking at it. Looks like Billings' fingers touched the boundary when he tried to keep it in for the second time"
"walks down the pitch and Chahar bowls it short outside off, not much room so Kohli dabs it square for a single"
"pitched up around off, Kohli comes forward and drives it back"
"bit of flight and it's pitched up a bit, Kohli helps it down to long on this time"
"some room outside off, he goes after it and drives it along the ground to cover"
"flight and room again, he frees his arms to cut this time, there's some bounce too and he finds the fielder again"
dances down this time and doesn't let the ball turn from off stump. Middles that and hits it against the turn with a big follow through over long on
"little flatter, de Kock goes hard at it outside off but doesn't quite middle it"
"angles this length delivery into the pads, no swing and Kohli works it to midwicket"
"<strong>Jadeja dives and takes it at mid-on</strong>. Kohli walked down this time, it was a length delivery on the stumps and Kohli wanted to loft it over the fielder but didn't quite middle it. Jadeja was slightly wide at mid-on and he quicklt went to his left for a dive and grabbed it with both hands. Thakur is thrilled!"
"straight delivery served first up to ABD, he pushes it back"
"another good delivery, straight and on length. AB stays still and punches it back, just evading the bowler but they decide against the single because Jadeja is there"
"<b>heaves and misses</b>! Short of length and swinging in a bit late, he goes for the mighty pull and the ball goes just under the bat"
"on the off side this time, AB steers it late to short third man"
"some flight outside off and de Kock wants to whack it, but only gets a single down to long off"
"he comes down and that lands into the crowd over long on! A bit of light, he absolutely middled that fearliesslly because long on was there and it sailed over him"
tickles it with the turn to the midwicket fielder
"woah, a flat six over the covers! It was pitched up, no doubt and AB smoked that over the covers like he knew where that was coming and at what speed. What a shot!"
"makes room yet again and gets enough of it to free his arms again to slam that square of the wicket for four this time. The length is not that bad, but this batsman isn't bad either"
"makes room, Harbhajan sends it slower and AB waits to defend it back. Loud cheers for that too"
"takes a step down and tries to work it with the spin, stifled appeal for lbw"
sweeps successfully this time to fine leg
"plants his front foot across and he sweeps that behind square for a six once again, the bowler doens't matter to this man"
"stays still, it's outside off and drives it along the ground to sweeper cover for one"
"works it with the spin from around off, it's between two fielders and they get two quick runs"
"swept yet again, Tahir has to run to his left from long leg and keeps it inside the boundary"
"starts with a slow off cutter on middle and leg, de Kock nudges it to leg and they took a single at normal pace and realised no fielder was sprinting in on the ball so take one more. Plenty of 30-plus players in CSK"
"angles it across, there's not much room but de Kock cuts that nicely off the back foot and bisects the gap between point and short third man. Not a bad ball, but really good shot"
"slower at 128.4kmh, the speed variation beats the batsman outside off as he cuts again and misses"
at 122.2 kmh this time and de Kock comes down to slam it to sweeper cover for one
"offcutter at 123kmh, he spots it and cuts off the back foot to deep point for one"
tried the yorker but de Kock came down and turned it into a low full toss to work it down to long on for one
"pitches this one leg stump, de Kock tries the reverse sweep and misses it completely. That wasn't far from the leg stump"
"bit more orthodox this time, worked with the spin to the leg side"
little full and AB drives it down to long off for one
"makes room and charges, Tahir yorks him and de Kock bunts it to cover point"
"goes for the big slog sweep, it was slightly full, but he gets an inside edge to the leg side"
"on the middle stump, AB plonks his front foot across and goes for the big sweep. Thakur runs to his right at long leg and just about keeps it in, almost over-running in the deep"
starts with a wide yorker which de Kock can't get bat on
"slower ball at 101kph, but it's too full and de Kock slams it straight and over the bowler's head for a clean six! Big stride and big bat swing"
"yorks him for the second time in three balls, got it across with the angle too and de Kock misses again. Bravo thought he got some bat"
"in the block hole on the of stump, de Kock does well to steer it to deep point and they get two for that. The stand reaches 50"
"in the block hole yet again, what accuracy. De Kock bunts it a bit wide of point and takes off, Raina has a shy at the stumps and misses while AB makes it"
goes across early and scoops it over the in-field behind square. Didn't get much distance but got two
"just outside off and AB gets a reverse sweep on that one, no power only guides it fine and gets four"
"poor delivery - short and turning away, AB makes room and misses it"
"goes the other side this time, six more! Plants his front foot across and sweeps that against the turn from length over long leg into the crowd"
"<strong>that's out of the stadium</strong>! He walks across to expose his stumps, it's a length delivery, although it doesn't matter to this man, and he clobbers that over long on, over the stands and over everything. Someone fetch that as AB grabs a drink"
stays back and across in the crease and works that after it turns to leg
"slower through the air on leg, de Kock works it with the spin to leg with soft hands so that they take two even though Dhoni chases it all the way"
wide signalled by Nigel Long as this one is full and wide outside off. Watson lets out a smile
"length delivery at 123kmh outside off, big swing and AB gets it to long on for one"
tries the wide yorker and de Kock paddles it from so far to the leg side
"makes room and it's slower again, heaves it to the leg side for one"
"<strong>top edge</strong>, where does it land? Just before long on who runs in a long way from the boundary. What luck for AB. He pulled the short ball and didn't get enough"
"wide yorker to de Kock as he makes room and then stretches to reach out for it, can't get there"
"not that short, but what a shot! Just a tad short, de Kock stays back and still and then smokes it over the midwicket boundary. That's gone a long, long way!"
"launched into the sky and that's fifty for him too! It lands in the crowd beyond the midwicket fence. It wans't full or too short, but those things don't matter to AB"
"here comes the knuckleball, here comes another six! It was too full, that's what was wrong with it, AB spotted the speed variation and tonked it straight down the ground"
"<b>three in a row</b>! Outside off now, bit too full and big swing of the arms to send that flying over the covers. The fielders can call for chairs now"
"goes back and across, good reply from Thakur with a yorker outside off near the feet and AB drives it bit wide of long on"
"gets room to free his arms and he does, along the ground to deep point"
"really slow bouncer on middle and it's angled it, AB sways his head out of the line and tries a kind of ramp but misses"
"oh, he's broken this stand with a good return catch! It was a typical Bravo slower ball, back of length on the stumps and de Kock pulled but a bit too early and handed it back to the bowler, who brings out his dance celebration and the crowd loves it"
starts with a bouncer to Anderson and he lets it go outside off
nearly a yorker outside off and it's steered to point where Raina puts in a dive
"<strong>big lbw appeal</strong> from Bravo, it was a really really slow yorker and beat Anderson completely, hitting him near the knee on the back foot. Looks like Dhoni didn't want to review"
"outside off, yorker again and Anderson chops it to backward point"
"he charges a bit after those five dot balls, Bravo is smart enough to land that wide and away from him, another dot"
enough room outside off to drive that powerfully along the ground through the covers
"pretty short and Anderson miscues it down the ground, lands short of long on"
sweeps against the turn and along the ground to long leg
takes a step down to make it a full delivery and drives it hard to long on
"<b>AB holes out</b>, another great over for CSK. Not a great delivery, it was a short legbreak well outside off and turned away further but AB swung away from the body and the leading edge went high enough for Billings to run in from sweeper cover. He doesn't drop those"
"two in two, Tahir is running again! Anderson got strike because they crossed over on the previous delivery, Tahir sent down a wrong'un outside off and Anderson poked tentatively to slip where Harbhajan pouched it"
"that turn beats the batsman and Dhoni! It pitched on leg stump, maybe even outside, Mandeep looked to work it to leg and that turned a mile to miss the off stump while Mandeep came out of the crease and Dhoni missed the ball too"
"beats him outside off with the turn again, turns him square"
"sweeps it with some power against the turn, Billings throws himself to his right with a giant leap at deep midwicket and just misses it"
he takes out the reverse sweep now for the ball on off stump. Fine leg was in and all he had to do was clear that fielder
"lots of turn outside off, Mandeep stretches out to tap it through the covers"
"beaten first ball outside off, he tried to defend the length ball but it turned again and missed the bat and off stump, both"
short ball on leg and it's pulled to deep midwicket
"some flight there outside off, de Grandhomme waits and drives to sweeper cover"
"quick and flat outside off, he taps it late and calls for the single quickly"
drives it with the turn into the covers where a fumble allows one
pitched up and Mandeep uses his wrists to whip it to long on
"yorks de Grandhomme, who bunts the ball to the right of long on where Bravo chases and throws it back and Mandeep makes it with a dive just in time"
"slow yorker outside off, gets some bat and Dhoni dives to stop, he has a shy at the stumps closer to him and the batsman is nowhere close, he misses and then they take one on overthrow too"
"slow bouncer, it beats Mandeep completely. Can't get close"
"length delivery this time at 135kmh, it doesn't bounce much and Mandeep slogs but misses again"
smacks it back to Bravo who sticks his left hand out couldn't hold on to it. It will count as a <strong>drop</strong> but was struck really hard
moves across and whips the slow and low full toss to long leg. Chahar is stationed there but de Grandhomme comes back and throws in a dive as the throw comes wide
in the block hole but de Grandhomme lofts it back over the fielder and even beats long off for a four. What a shot!
<b>sweetly timed!</b> Mandeep Singh with a top-class shot. It's a length ball wide outside off and he gets his weight down on his back thigh as he reaches out and uses his wrists nicely to slice it over point
"<b>dabbed between the two sweepers</b> on the off side. He was looking to get down for the ramp over short fine, but it's a slower ball short and wide outside off. Stabs it out there."
"yorker outside off, jams it to long-off off the toe-end"
"slower ball dropped short outside off, reaches out and flat-bats it past the non-striker. Calls for two immediately and they do well to get back"
he shapes to jump into the leg side for a ramp and withdraws late. The bowler is forced to bowl wide outside off and he leaves to get the extra run
"<b>shot!</b> This is Mandeep's arrival. It's taken some time. Stunning hit. A knuckle ball dug in short outside off. No pace off the pitch but somehow he has pummelled this, one the up, with a flat bat over long-off"
full and very very wide outside off. No chance he'll hit that
"<b>taken at deep midwicket.</b> Mandeep picks the knuckle ball, but this length ball is too far outside off for the slog sweep he plays eventually. Ends up slicing it and Jadeja has an easy one. This is a good innings from Mandeep, he has put the momentum back in RCB's favour"
<b>Dhoni hits</b> and that's Colin de Grandhomme. And the associated runs. Too simple for him - he chucks it overarm with his glove one. Negi was looking to dab this slower ball past him with a late cut and missed
"<b>and another!</b> Well, scratch that about momentum. Three wickets in three balls. Two run outs. Quite appalling. It's a full toss and he lifts it inside-out to long-off's right. Jadeja picks up on the bounce. Sundar has settled into the crease at the non-striker's end. Negi is running down frantically though for some reason. Turns, slips, can't make his ground at the striker's end"
<b>almost another run-out.</b> Royal Challengers trying hard to get bowled out. A full toss - wide down leg side. He's got a free run but he's skipping outside the crease for some reason. Dhoni misses both the stumps and the batsman narrowly with his throw
"<b>bye bye.</b> Bizarre over. Bizarre cricket. A slower ball at length outside off. Umesh looks to slug it to Commercial Street. He can only find Billings, 20 yards in from the boundary at deep midwicket"
"<b>smash.</b> Sundar with a reminder that there's some batting left. Hangs deep in the crease, gets a short ball that is also a slower ball. Plenty of time to swing and he manages to lift it over deep midwicket. That's a Chinnaswamy sixer"
shot. That'll bring up 200. It's a full toss on off stump and he gets under it to punch straight over the umpire
"<b>you beauty.</b> Sundar with some aggressive sensibility! Shows the older boys how it's done. Stands his ground once again, allows the bowler to bowl to him and reacts to find a boundary through point. It's a poor ball - short and wide, and he carves it expertly"
starts with a full delivery and Watson drives it down to long off
leans forward for the length delivery and defends solidly
comes down now and pushes the ball down the ground with the spin to mid off
bit too short and Watson pulls but miscues it to backward square leg
high and long! Lunges forward for the length delivery and gets under the ball really well to send that flying over long on. Negi shut his eyes as soon as Watson launched it
"<strong>caught at mid-on</strong>, Negi has struck! Wasn't the short on the stumps but Watson went back to pull and miscued it, easy catch for mid-on"
swings it away from length as Rayudu helps it towards backward point where Negi puts in a dive
"taps the back of length delivery from outside off to Negi at point again, the crowd showes how much they love him"
"risky single the one as Umesh's short of length ball squared up Rayudu a bit, he defended it off the back foot towards cover and Raina made it just in time"
it's angled away outside off and Raina dabs it tentatively to point
"138kmh and <strong>Raina had no clue about that</strong>! What a beautiful length delivery from Umesh, in the channel outside off, Raina doesn't know whether to go back or forward, drives and misses"
"here comes the short ball, not a bouncer, and Raina taps it with a horizontal bat to midwicket"
"around length outside off, tickled to the leg side with the angle"
"pretty straight outside off, Rayudu dabs it to cover point"
"flat and short at 99.6 kmh, Rayudu dances down and clobbers that over deep midwicket. He's broken the shackles"
"more elegant this time, pitched up and Rayudu stays still to drive that nicely down the ground with a big swing. Pressure on bowler now"
"flat and quick outside off, he pushes it back to the bowler"
"quick again aorund off, worked to the leg side and he keeps strike"
strays towards the pads and Rayudu won't let that go. Uses his wrists and flicks it off the middle to the long leg boundary. Goes all the way!
"short, wide and swinging away, he cuts and misses"
"cramps him for room with a short ball towards the ribs, good comeback from Umesh. Made Rayudu uncomfortable as he brought his bat down just in time"
"hint of swing away from outside off, he dabs it late to third man for one"
"short ball for Raina, he makes plenty of room and pulls that just wide of mid on and in the gap for four"
<strong>goes through him</strong>! Umesh cranking it up and bowling short to Raina even as he's making room to target the off side. This time the ball swings into him and he can't get any bat on that
"starts with a short ball outside off, Rayudu gets over the ball in the nick of time to defend"
pulled to midwicket for a one-bounce four! He went to the off stump early to predict the slightly short ball and then swivelled on the back foot to pull it in the vacant area
"quick and nipping into Rayudu, just about gets his bat down for one towards point. Think he got glove actually"
goes towards the off stump and Siraj strays down leg for a wide
"in the air and right in the gap on the off side, he gets four too! Raina backed away again for the short ball and slayed that ball right between extra cover and cover point"
"angled into him this time, worked to the leg side more easily for one"
the umpire ducks as Rayudu charges down and slaps the short of length ball over the bowler's head with sheer disdain. He's looking in ominuous form
"the persistence with pace pays off, Raina miscues it to backward point! Raina strayed from his stumps again and Umesh pitched it up with some swing towards his legs, Raina flicked but mistimed it horrible and the edge went the other way, easy peasy for Mandeep"
"<strong>loud appeal </strong> first ball for Billings, but it's going down leg, the excitement for RCB makes it a loud appeal. It was angling in and going down for sure"
"on the pads again, his time Billings flicks it properly and over midwicket to clear the fielders for four"
"<strong>wow</strong>! Goes through Billings, just misses off stump and de Kock takes it near his shoulders. That swung in late from back of length around off, Billins presented the staright bat but on the wrong line"
"straighter on the off stump, solid defence from Billings this time"
"just outside the off stump, he steers it down to third man"
plants his foot across and paddles it fine against the turn and it's gone really fine to beat the fielder
"lots of turn and he's stumped! Billings came down the track, Chahal bowls it slower through the air and shorter on the stumps, Billings looks to flick it with the wrists but the ball turns so much that it's gone past him and into the keeper's gloves"
"turns into him a fair bit from outside off, Jadeja tucks it to leg off the back foot"
"lunges forward a bit for the length ball on the stumps, blocks it"
"flatter on the pads, Rayudu pushes it to the right of Chahal and the bowler sprints across quickly"
brings the length shorter and the ball doesn't bounce much but Rayudu stays back to whip it to leg
"pretty straight and coming into the batsman, he defends to leg for one"
"swings it into him from middle stump, no room for Jadeja to put it away"
dances down and smacks the ball from outside off to deep point. A fielder is stationed there
"back of length and coming in again, tucked to leg off his toes"
"short and towards Jadeja's waist, works it away easily or one more"
"stifling line around off again, he goes across a bit on his toes and helps it to leg for one"
"keeps low, <strong>loud appeal</strong> turned down quickly! It was short and quick, Rayudu pulled and missed but was struck outside leg"
"goes for the drive but it's a touch slower and doesn't turn that much, inside edge back to the bowler"
"goes inside out again with the turn, and this time he has middled it with the turn. It's gone high and over deep cover all the way"
<b>beaten</b>! Rayudu stays back to let the ball turn and it turns so much that beats his outside edge
pitched up this time so he drives it down to long off easily
turns from middle and leg and goes down leg for a wide
"so much turn, he's <strong>got the off stump</strong>! After that wide, Chahal goes wide outside off, wide enough to tempt Jadeja into a cut and he tries that but it turns in viciously to knock the stumps over!"
towards the pads from Negi and Rayudu works it against the spin to leg
"targets the stumps with the angle, Dhoni pushes it straight back"
"launches it over the leg side, he's not wasting time today! Took a step down as soon as he saw the ball was on leg, reached the pitch of the ball and sent it over deep midwicket"
charges down again to take it on the full and slams it to long on
takes a step down and pushes the ball with the turn to long off
"nicely bowled on the stumps, around middle and leg and it turned enough to make Dhoni defend it back. No room whatsoever"
"turning towards off from middle, Rayudu goes back and turns it to leg"
towards the leg side and Dhoni covers his stumps to paddle that down and fine on the leg side before the fielder there dives to his right to save two
"soft hands from Dhoni to work that to the leg side from leg stump, they run hard and make it back for two"
"nicely flighted on middle and leg, Dhoni waits and helps it straight to midwicket"
"touch fuller and towards leg, helped towards square leg for one"
"flat googly towards the stumps and Rayudu defends it back. Oh, no ball for overstepping. Ouch, harsh call from the umpire, Long"
"goes for a big sweep but Chahal has smartly bowled it slow and Rayudu is through with the shot already, goes on to hit the stumps but doesn't matter"
enough room outside off for Dhoni to drive it away to deep point
"a cutter at 120kmh on leg stump, Rayudu guides it into the off side"
"not too far from the off stump, Dhoni stays back and punches it to long off"
"<strong>Anderson appeals loudly</strong> for lbw as Rayudu goes down on a knee to sweep that to the leg side but misses it. Not given as runs and <strong>Kohli reviews it</strong>. It hit Rayudu around his waist but height may not be a problem, did it pitch in line? Pitches in line, and that has actually gone past and over stump so RCB lose a review."
"<b>into the open sky and into the stands</b>! Pitched up slightly in Dhoni's arc, he picked the length and smoked it over long on. Hit it so hard, I wouldn't have tried to catch it"
pitched up slightly and he helps it down to long off
towards the pads and it's worked fine for a single
"slightly slower and full on middle and leg, chips it bit in the air and down to long on"
lofts it down the ground and <strong>reaches long on after a bounce</strong>. Risky shot for a single
"slow and well outside off, turns away further and Rayudu leaves, thinking it's a wide. But it's not"
"flatter one on the pads, gets one to the leg side with a thick inside edge"
this one is a wide was it turns and goes wider than the line
better line from Chahal as Dhoni drives that with turn into the covers
"here comes the golf swing! Pitched up on off and Dhoni is not going to leave those, quick hands, strong bottom hand and all the power from those arms and shoulders launches that over the sight screen"
"one more, not a drop of sweat and that's gone over long on! Another fullish delivery from Negi, on the stumps and right in the zone for Dhoni to hit it straight"
"changes the line to pitch it outside off, brings it shorter too and it turns to beat Dhoni"
looks to come forward but then goes back and cuts with a thick outside edge after the turn to short third man
"it's Rayudu's turn, he's sent that over the cow corner! Short enough from Negi for Rayudu to go back quickly and pull that to the leg side. It's a short boundary and they're making full use of it"
better line from Negi - wider outside off as Rayudu tries to sweep but it's out of his reach outside off
"shot and wide outside off, he reaches out and tucks it over point"
"slower short ball well outside off, Rayudu lets it go but it's not a wide"
"over the covers and six, Rayudu's sixth six! He charged down the track and didn't look like he middled it, but he got enough to send it flat and over"
stays back in the crease and bunts it down to long on
"length delivery just outside off, Dhoni waits and then defends"
"good delivery on the off stump, Dhoni pushes for a single as soon as he helps it to mid off"
"smashes the full delivery down the ground, Kohli sprints across to his right from long off and sends back a powerful throw to keep it to one. Both captains giving it their everything"
"slightly slower and angled across from well outside off, he swings and misses"
"<strong>dropped</strong>! Leading edge and Umesh has put it down. Rayudu went for the big shot from outside off, he didn't get close to it and that went so high Umesh had all the time in the world to get under it. He got under it in the cricle on the off side but it popped out"
"short outside off, upper cut to third man after a bounce"
"short and wide outside off as Rayudu swings, misses and it's called a wide even though Anderson thinks it's not"
"these boundaries are so short, that's another six over the covers! Short again outside off and Rayudu stayed still until slapping that flat and well over the covers"
"that's better from Rayudu, that's a six on any ground! Walked across for the length ball and clubbed it away into the cheering crowd over deep midwicket for his eighth six"
"short of length outside off, dabbed to third man for one"
"almost in the block hole, Rayudu slams it down to long off"
"pitched up with some room and Dhoni has cleverly driven that square, almost beating the fielder. De Grandhomme runs across to his left behind square and slides to <em>just</em> keep the ball in. The third umpire is checking and looks fine"
"good line just outside off, helps it to short third man for one"
"short and slow outside off, Rayudu goes on his toes and lofts it over the covers for two more"
"he has found the gap and the boundary we didn't see! In the channel outside off, Dhoni hung back and cut it late enough to bisect backward point and short third man. They didn't even move"
"short and wide going across, slapped over the covers for one"
tries to bowl it well away and ends up giving a wide on off
"<strong>over the sightscreen</strong> to bring up his half-century! Too full and straight after that wide, Dhoni's high back lift was waiting and he didn't even have to finish the follow through to hammer that"
wider from the batsman and Dhoni pushes it into off for one
"too much room to free the arms, too short to give the batsman enough time and Rayudu gets on top of that to slap it between point and cover"
"<b>Rayudu can't make it despite the dive</b>! He steered it to short third man where Umesh dived to his right but the ball deflected away, making the batsmen think of two. But it wasn't too far and Umesh qickly got back and, guess what, <b>direct hit</b> at the keeper's end"
"goes or a biggish swing first ball outside off, into the covers for one"
"low yorker outside off, almost a low full toss and Bravo gets a tiny edge to the keeper"
"almost gets the block hole again, Bravo slams it down to long off"
"good, wide yorker from Siraj. Dhoni jams his bat into the ground to send it to point"
"full toss, slightly high, and Bravo can't middle it as he sends it down to long off. It dipped a bit and Bravo came down the track so not a no ball"
"have you seen that before?! Low full toss and Dhoni slices it for <b>six over point</b>! Not a bad ball, only slightly inaccurate but these get punished in the death"
"slow bouncer, it bounces so much that Dhoni lets it go over him for a wide"
"one more wide, this one's gone far down the off side. Pressure goes back to the bowler after a really good start"
"short and wide, Dhoni swings and that moves away further for another wide"
"too full, driven straight back and it hits the stumps. Oh, it's deflected to the leg side and they come back for the second"
"<b>edged and just past the keeper for four</b>! He rolled his fingers over that short ball, it bounced well and Bravo hooked, got an edge and it went just over de Kock's leap"
"it's that <b>trademark Bravo loft over the covers</b>. Short ball on off, enough room for Bravo to throw everything at it, big and hard hit and it's sailed over the off side"
"another shortish ball outside off, Bravo stays back and cuts it over point for one"
"<b>crackalicious</b>! How's that to win the match - a six over wide long-on with so much strength it's landed into the crowd. Dhoni absolutely bludgeoned that by going across and swinging it over the cow corner like that night at Wankhede in April 2011. Bravo lifts his arms and goes across to embrace MS Dhoni, who's cool as ever. Harbhajan comes out and lifts Dhoni!"
