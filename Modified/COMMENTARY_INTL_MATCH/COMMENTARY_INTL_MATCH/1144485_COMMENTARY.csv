"away with a leg glance! Easy pickings. Couldn't have asked for an easier first ball. Loose, down leg and he simply stands tall and tickles it fine."
"huge appeal. I mean a really huge appeal. Plays all around a full delivery and is struck on the pad. Only doubt was did it pitch outside leg. <strong>. The answer is an emphatic no. Williamson goes for a review. </strong> Pitching in line, impact in line, hitting. Three reds, so he will have to walk back. What a review! Thirimanne is gone."
"nice and full on off, defends firmly into the off side"
"<strong>beaten on the inside edge!</strong> Nips back in from length on middle, wobbles in to beat his gentle waft."

"inward movement this time, goes full from wide of the crease, defended with his bat close to the pad"
gets on top of the bounce and turns this gently into the leg side
driven wide of mid-on for a quick single
"driven into the gap between cover and point, sliding stop but they'll take a couple to round off the over"
right behind the line as he defends
glanced fine but there's a man a long leg to cut that off
"full on off, squeezes the drive to extra cover"
"shortens his length a hint, gets this to nip away, Kusal defends"
"<strong>sliced over extra cover!</strong> Saw this overpitched, there was no way in the world he was going to hold back. Threw his hands at the ball, got enough wood to clear the infield."
"on the pads, tucks this to short midwicket"
"plays for an away-swinger but this one angles in and holds its line, hit on the pad as he's overbalanced. Stifled appeal but this was <strong>sliding down leg</strong>"
beauty! This one nips away to square him up. Feeble push from Dimuth without any feet movement.
"<strong>edged and four!</strong> There were three slips, but no gully and this goes exactly there. Full and swinging away, he went for the drive, got a thick outside edge. Streaky runs"
"wobbles away late, he gets a thick inside edge that races past square leg. De Grandhomme with a long chase"
excellent leave to a short of length ball that nips away from the fifth stump
punches to mid-on and calls for the single immediately. Excellent
absolutely belted! A bottom-handed shovel to a full and straight delivery. Right in his slot. More than just shades of Jayasuriya in his strokeplay
tickled down to fine leg
"poke and a miss. Feels for this delivery slanted across, no feet again. Beaten"
stands tall and defends this short of length delivery into the leg side
right behind the line of this length ball as he dabs again
"length ball on off, bunted with soft hands into the covers"

tucks this to square leg for a single
"slips this down leg searching for late swing, wide called and rightly so"
"<b>nearly chopped on! </b> Looking to run it down but had no width whatsoever. <B> Guess what? The ball brushed the stumps, the bails shook but didn't come off the groove. </B>"

"full but there's no swing that he's searching for, down leg and wide"

"on middle and leg, worked to deep fine leg"
"<strong>once again he's nearly chopped on! </strong> Looking to run it down, no width to work with. Why, oh why?"
eases this gently to backward point
"miles and miles in the air, mid-off and mid-on briefly looked at each other but de Grandhomme calls finally and takes this superbly at mid-on. Went really high, looks like this full delivery held up just a touch more on the surface, Kusal looking to belt it down the ground but got hit a touch high on the bat, which is why there was no timing. Sri Lanka lose their second and it's a big wicket."
"nicked and gone! Guptill went across to his left from second slip to take a good, low catch. Kusal Mendis squared up by the nip away as he gets a thick edge. This would've been lapped up by Ross Taylor at first, but for the dive from Guptill to pluck this. Sri Lanka tottering suddenly."
gorgeous off-drive! What a way to avert the hat-trick. Overpitched and he brings the full face of the bat to meet this on the half-volley. Lovely

"almost squaring him up this time, length ball around off and moving away off the seam, hits the outer half of the bat and dribbles towards backward point"

"length ball in the corridor, left alone by de Silva"
"short of length around off, gets on his toes and defends it down the pitch"
"once again a bit on the shorter side, getting the batsman to hop, de Silva does well to get on the top of the bounce once again and defend it on the off side"
"gone lbw. Length ball at 147kph, pitching around off and angling in a bit. De Silva was stuck on the back foot, the ball skids off the surface, keeping a bit low as well. De Silva cannot get his bat down in time and is hit on the front pad. A loud appeal and up goes the finger. The batsman is having a chat with his partner and they decide not to review"

"length outside off, gets Mathews to hop in the crease once again, manages to dab it towards point"
"fuller on the stumps this time at 147kph/91mph. Went for the yorker but fails to nail it, Mathews keeps it out"
"what a stop, Boult at short midwicket diving to his left. Was a bouncer from Ferguson but doesn't rise much, Mathews is already on the back foot and pulls it firmly. Boult comes in the way though"
"length ball around middle, a bit of swing in, dabbed towards leg side"

"length ball outside off, 145kph. Moves away after landing to beat the forward defence"
"that angle is working well for Ferguson, was a length ball and leaving the batsman. Hardly any feet movement from Mendis, pushes at it with hard hands, gets squared up as well, and Neesham grabs low to his left it at gully"
"short of length around off, Perera pushes it awkwardly towards mid-off"
"a touch fuller on the pads, Perera flicks it in front of the square, not the best of the timings which means it won't reach the boundary, they come back for the third though"
"short of length but down the leg side, wide"
"a sharp bouncer this time, aimed at the batsman but Karunaratne is quick to duck under it"
"a touch fuller this time, on the stumps, Karunaratne drives it on the up, right back at the bowler. Was that a chance? Looks like it was, going by Ferguson's reaction who went low in his followthrough but couldn't latch on to as the ball went through and to the short straight boundary"
"length ball around off, Perera is once again stuck at the back foot and pushes it towards mid-off"
"length ball on the pads, tucked away in front of square leg for one more"

"skiddy incoming back of length delivery, turned into the leg side"
"that's a Dimuth special. Has taken a while, but will be well worth it if he can haul Sri Lanka to safety. Sliding into the pads and he flicks this imperiously through midwicket. Balance and timing impeccable"

"slants one across, a touch quicker, Thisara shapes to cut but leaves in the end"
slaps this straight to cover
"loopy delivery but bowled way outside off, left alone. Wide called"
"goes big, no timing and holes out to long-on. Just didn't get to the pitch, was tempted to heave this across the line as he saw the flight, Santner got this to dip on him and that did the trick. Boult took a few steps back, kept his eyes on the ball and didn't make a mistake."
bunts this to short third man

squirts this off a thick inside edge to deep square leg
right behind the line of this incoming length ball as he defends

shows the full face of the bat to ease this back

"heaves across the line to deep square leg, came off a thick inside edge"
"a no-ball was called even before the bowler delivered, Lakmal had a jolly good swing, top-edged it as the ball fell between the keeper running back and third man. <b> Time for a free-hit </b>"

"slips this full ball down leg, wide called"
"full toss honing into middle, gets a thick inside edge to deep square leg"
"outstanding from Santner at deep square! Or has he taken it cleanly? They're going upstairs. <b> Not out comes the decision because replays inconclusive. </b> The soft-signal was not-out too. Dimuth makes room to slap this but the bowler follows him, so now he decides to take on the short ball and pull, no timing and gets it high on the bat. Santner anticipates the stroke and runs in quickly and as this descends, put in a full-length dive to complete the catch. The on-field umpires went upstairs to check if this was a bump ball. They clearly felt there was some part of the ball touching the ground."
the stump takes a beating! Lockie takes three as Sri Lanka have been suckerpunched. Malinga makes room to steer this behind square but is beaten for pace by this fast and furious full toss.
"length ball outside off, hits it on the up but cannot beat extra cover, a bit of an awayswing for Malinga straightaway"
