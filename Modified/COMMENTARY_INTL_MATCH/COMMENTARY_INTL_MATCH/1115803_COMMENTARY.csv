"full and swinging away, left alone. Some away shape. But a tad too wide to draw a stroke."
"on a length again, wider outside off and Azhar ain't poking just yet"
"well bowled. Starts it straighter, but the away shape takes it away again. Left alone"
"too wide again, full and shaping away. The fourth leave on the bounce"
"strays down leg, wide. That one didn't swing"
"excellent length with the ball swinging. Full and wide outside off, moving away, but Azhar leaves again"
"lovely over. No bat on ball. Good length outside off, no stroke"
"full and wide, swinging away again. No stroke. Good discipline so far from Pakistan"
"good length outside off, bat on ball for the first time this morning. Dabbed towards point"
"good single there. Full outside off, moving away, blocked towards cover for a run"
"given, <b>but Azhar reviews</b>! It's a nice, short delivery around middle and leg, Azhar is hurried on a pull, but it seems the ball may have just brushed the helmet, and not the glove! No bat for sure. Looks like Azhar has just plan, missed a pull, and got stuck in an awkward position. No spike on Snicko, this should be overturned! The third umpire says 'there is a spike as ball passes bat.' But he rightly changes his call, forcing the umpire to overturn the decision."
nicely worked off his hips towards square leg
"shortish delivery, no swing on this. Chopped down to third man for a single. Another tidy over"
"short delivery, around leg, nudged to square leg."
"nicely bowled. Looking for the lbw, full and swinging back in, nudged to short midwicket, who is a catcher with this swing"
"and again. The front foot plants across, full and straight, nudged to short midwicket. Had to get bat on that"
"full delivery around off, not hooping inswing, but it's there. Driven with the angle to mid-on"
"this one is angled across, full outside off, moving away, pushed to cover"
"fantastic fielding from short midwicket. Good length on middle and leg, worked away with the swing to short midwicket's left. Nicholls dives to his left to stop the ball. Imam calls for one, but is sent back late by Azhar. Eventually, Imam makes it back"
"angled across the batsman again, full outside off, left alone"
"beauty. Swings away, full delivery outside off, moves away. Azhar plays the line but is beaten as he prods"
"full but a tad too wide this time, no stroke. Very disciplined again from New Zealand"
"full around off, shovelled into the gap at midwicket for a run. Good single there"
"short and gone! He changes the length does Boult, short around off. Imam is not in control of the pull, partly because he has to drag the stroke. He times it quite awfully and his placement is worse, straight to square leg. You would think that Pakistan would be cautious against that ball in New Zealand"
"good length, on off, defended"
"good length around off, no swing there. Defended"
"full delivery around off, goes slightly wide of the crease, defended back"
"lovely shot. Short delivery down leg, Azhar stays inside the line and nails his pull to the deep square leg boundary. Got on top of the bounce"
"five runs for Pakistan. A short delivery goes down leg, over leg stump maybe. It starts outside off, but keeps swinging down. The keeper dives to his left but can't get there"
"that looked out and given. Azhar opts not to review this time. Southee strikes. Full delivery outside off, seams back in after pitching. Azhar is beaten by that late movement, struck right in front of off after the ball misses the inside edge. Beaten by some lateral movement."
"a short delivery down leg, pulled down to fine leg for a single"
"full delivery outside off, comes back in, pushed back to the bowler"
"full and swinging back in, inside-halved down to fine leg for a run."

"full outside off, coming back in, driven back to the bowler again. Nice, full length"
"on a length outside off, punched away to cover from the back foot"
"past cover for a run. Full and wide again, a punchy drive is caressed past cover. Mid-off fields"
"another good single, on the pads, nudged to square leg for a good single"
"full, around off, no swing. Hafeez behind the line to defend"
"finds the gap through point for a couple. Good length delivery outside off, Hafeez watches the ball and plays it late. Guptill dives to his right at point, gets a hand on it to slow it down"
"on a length but on the pads and Hafeez is really strong there, worked to square leg"
"just over midwicket. They're raking on the short ball. Short delivery around off, Hafeez is very late on the pull and somehow gets enough behind the pull to clear the fielder. Nowhere near control"
"that's a fine shot. Back of a length down leg, New Zealand are going after them with that length. Pulled past fine leg for four. Hit that quite well"
"full delivery outside off, the ball shapes away, off the outside edge towards point"
"edged in the gap between the keeper and a wide slip. Full delivery, angling away, on a fourth-stump channel. A thick edge dies but goes through the gap. Would not have carried anyway. Signs of a slow pitch"
"full and wide, pushed across, left alone"
"really good single. Full delivery on off, pushed to mid-off, who is slightly wide. An easy single"
"lovely shot this time from Hafeez, a short-arm stab through midwicket. Slightly short on off, he stays back and just jabs it through midwicket with terrific timing"
"a much slower delivery, a wide offcutter outside off, left alone"
"angled across again, Hafeez gets forward and lets it go watchfully"
"right in the gap again. Good length delivery, or just fuller than that. Azam pokes with no intent, gets a thick outside edge which flies in the gap between the keeper and wide slip again."
"lovely hit. Overpitched outside off, drilled to Southee's feet, full face of the bat"
"slightly straighter, around middle and off. That bottom hand comes out, drives to mid-on"
"straight to Taylor at wide slip, on the bounce though. Good length outside off, he wafts at that one again"
"good length on off, 125 kph, again signs of a very slow surface, that ball losing speed due to the shorter length. Punched to mid-on"
"nice and full around off, defended into the off side. Excellent lines from Southee, as usual"
"loads of flight on that, wide too, sliced to the extra cover fielder"
"big appeal, sliding down probably. Flat down leg, Hafeez misreads the length, it's too full to sweep, struck on the pad."
""
"nice again, slow and wide outside off, defended towards point"
"excellent delivery. Wide of the crease and fired in, around off. Hafeez's feet go nowhere, pushed to cover awkwardly"
"maiden to start from Santner. Flight outside off, guided down to short third man"
"quick, but drifts on the pads, worked away to square leg"
"edged and gone! Straight to a routine first slip. On a length that time outside off, Azam like he has been doing through this innings, wafts at the ball. A thick outside edge is found and straight to Taylor. That's a poor shot. Two bad ones today from Imam and now Azam."
"back of a length outside off, climbs away, left alone"
"ooh, pace and bounce. Short delivery outside off, keeps going. Surprises Latham too, who tips it over the bar"
"excellent change in length, goes fuller there, Hafeez drives the ball back"
"beaten for pace again. Short and quick down leg, Hafeez is far too late on his pull, gloves it away towards square leg. One hand even came off the bat"
"85 kph, flat and wide outside off, driven away towards cover"
"nicely bowled again, quick around middle, blocked back"
"short and quick outside off, Hafeez goes back and punches to the sweeper cover"
"86 kph, flight outside off, driven towards point"
"quick again, on middle and leg. Defended back"
"just one off the over. Flat around off, Malik gets forward and defends into the off side. Five dot balls to begin for Malik"
"short delivery, at the ribs, nudged away to square leg. A tad over 140 kph"
"a good single. Full delivery outside off, driven through cover for a single"
"good single from Malik, that's better. Short on middle and leg, worked away towards wide mid-on for a single"
"ooh, more bounce. Short delivery outside off, not wide enough to cut so Hafeez stabs at the ball, the ball climbs and passes the outside edge"
"flayed into the gap at cover point for four. Lovely hit from Hafeez, he has the right intent today. He goes after it and finds the gap. Good timing too"
"a good leave to end the over. Back of a length outside off, Hafeez lifts his hands vertically to avoid the ball"
"pushed through, quick outside off, driven to cover. Santner has gone for one run in 13 balls"
"slow delivery outside off, tapped towards point. Nicholls runs in, and decides not to throw even as Hafeez is running back, frantic to make his crease."
"quick er delivery outside off, punched away towards the sweeper cover region"
"short down leg this time, worked away towards square leg. Another dot"
"wide of the crease, full and straight, defended."

"good length delivery outside off, inside edged into the pad"
"past backward point for a couple. Good length delivery outside off, angles the bat to find the gap"

"on the pads, quick, nudged to deep square leg for a single"
"flat, quick and wide outside off, dabbed towards point."
"95 kph, full and quick around off, driven back to the bowler. Two singles in 20 balls to Santner"
"he has had enough. Runs down to the pitch, Santner sees that and slows it up, wider outside off, but Malik doesn't care. Runs down and nails a lofted drive over long-off for six. Superb hit"
"96 kph, flat on middle and leg, worked away towards square leg for a run. So much better"
"flat and quick outside off, punched away to the sweeper cover"
"91 kph, more flight outside off, driven to long-off for a run. End of a productive over off Santner."

"<b>holes out to long-on!</b> New Zealand have manufactured this wicket as a team. The pressure was building on Malik, he played too many dot balls. Stepped out and got a release shot last over, but this time he tries the same and ends up getting too close to the ball. Can't get enough elevation as a result, and it comes off the inside half of the bat"
oh gorgeous. Hafeez can be so attractive when he drives. Leans into this length ball outside off and offers the full face to drill it past the non-striker

"back of a length at off stump, punched to sweeper cover"
"<b>this is very close as Sarfraz comes back for the second run. It's been sent upstairs.</b> Oh Pakistan's captain takes it too easy with the second run after flicking a full ball to deep square's right. He has made it though. Marginally.

"short and in at middle stump, swivels and pulls to deep square"

"thumped away. Offcutter dropped short outside off, he stays put in the crease and pulls very hard, wide of mid-on"
"full and just outside off, drives sweetly to find extra cover on the bounce. He might be the perfect batsman at this point in time, the timing is unreal"
"<b>fifty.</b> Another piece of pristine timing and this time even Southee's dive won't deny him. Back of a length just outside off, chops it and beats third man to his right"
"<b>big lbw appeal</b> is turned down as Sarfraz is beaten on the inside edge by a slider. New Zealand have reviewed. He plays down the wrong line on the front foot and it appears he is struck in front of leg stump...wow that's close. Tracker shows it's hitting leg stump, but the margins are enough for it to remain umpire's call. New Zealand keep the review"
<b>no doubt about this one.</b> Sarfraz's antsy innings ends the way it was tending to. Three chances in six balls. New Zealand accept the third gratefully. Premeditates and runs down the track to a short ball outside off. It skids past his last-ditch attempt to get bat on it and it's an easy stumping

"<b>finds extra cover.</b> Oh dear, another senior throws it away. Poor from Hafeez. He falls to the premeditated skip down the track as well. Santner throws this flat, short of a length, and wide. Hafeez steps out and is forced to reach out to try and avoid being stumped. Unlike Safraz, he manages connection, but he was too far from the ball to control it. Slapped it off the middle, but the fielder didn't have to move"

"did it carry? No? Todd Astle says he isn't sure, but wants the umpires to check. <strong>The soft signal is not out</strong>. A full delivery on middle and leg was nicely clipped towards mid-on, who dived in front. Think that carried, but the ball seems to have found at least a blade of grass somewhere, as the ball pops out of his hands for a brief moment."

"he backs away again, 142 kph, yorker on middle, jammed out towards midwicket"

"well bowled! Oh, that's unfortunate for Ferguson. Just inside the tramline, but the umpire calls it a wide. A nice, wide yorker"
"short delivery around off, Shadab is too late on another pull. New Zealand hardly appeal, thinking it's out. But the umpire doesn't give it. <strong>Williamson reviews</strong>. Has it beaten him? Snicko certainly doesn't thinks so, a big spike as ball passes bat. A thin edge. Shadab's fine rearguard innings ends"
"full delivery outside off, Raees backs away and swings, chips a lofted drive over mid-off for four"
full and straight. The batsman backs away and awkwardly drives towards mid-on for two. Bad timing but productive

"another short delivery down leg, Raees can't lay bat on his pull"
"full on the pads, 142 kph, worked away towards wide mid-on for one. Hit with the angle of swing"
"beauty! Full delivery, moving away, moving late, beats the bat."
"a duck for Munro! And Pakistan have a massive wicket in the first over. A short delivery outside off but with plenty of away shape. The ball moves away, takes the outside edge and flies down to third man. He went hard at it, and he is so powerful that the ball carried all the way. Exceptional start for Pakistan"
"good length delivery on middle and leg, worked away into the leg side, towards square leg"
"full around off, inside-edged towards square leg for one. This is a terrific start, the channels are probing"
"good length, goes wider of the crease and angles it away. On a length, around off, defended. Great start"

"full on middle and leg, driven away towards mid-on"
"full and wide, angled away, left alone. Excellent line from Amir, doesn't take much time to find his line"
"good length on middle and leg, the ball swings back in and hits Williamson in front. <strong>A massive appeal is struck down</strong>, but Sarfraz wants a second opinion from the third umpire. No bat on that. Is it pitching outside leg? No. Two reds, but the ball is going over the stumps, missing! A tad too high, Pakistan lose their review. But excellent bowling from Amir"
"good length around off, nudged into the leg side"
"full outside off, 139 kph, blocked towards cover. NZ under pressure here. They have to soak up this period"
"on the pads, full and swinging back. Flicked towards square leg"
"good length around off, defended into the off side"
"angles it away, fullish delivery on middle and leg, blocked back"

"full and straight, swinging in, worked away to square leg. Almost fell over his flick"
"digs this one in, 127 kph, too short maybe. Guptill ducks underneath"
"132 kph, clears his back leg slightly, in order to free up his lofted drive. Looks to go straight but the ball is angled across the right-hander. Thick outside edge over the slip cordon"
this is a much better shot. On the pads and Guptill flicks the ball through midwicket for some runs
"139 kph, good length outside off, pushed towards mid-off for one. He is on the back foot, but makes the run easily"
"squeezed into the gap at cover point for three. Full outside off, Guptill looks to go straight, but the ball slices off the outside edge"
"five runs for New Zealand. BUZZERS! Sloppy Pakistan. Good length delivery outside off, pushed away towards cover, who dives to his right to parry it away towards mid-off. The throw is over the stumps at the bowler's end. The backing-up isn't great. Goes through him for four extras"
"short delivery outside off, angled across, guided off the open face down to third man"
"full and wide from Amir, swinging in, creeps underneath the bat"
"139 kph, good length around off, defended. Amir rarely ever bowls bad overs"

"angled across the right-hander again. Full outside off, defended into the off side"
"good length around off, 132 kph, pushed back to the bowler"
"lovely batting. Typical Guptill. A slower ball around middle, Guptill just extends his on-drive, hits the ball over mid-on for four. Full face of the bat."
"good length on middle and leg, 135 kph, pushed to mid-on"
"good length on middle and leg, Guptill closes the bat face late to get the ball into the gap at midwicket for a couple. Played late"

"good length on middle and off, worked the ball towards midwicket for a couple. Hit the ball intentionally in front of square for a couple"

"good length outside off, pushed towards wide mid-off for a single. Another good single"
"full delivery outside off, pushed back to Amir."
"change in length, a clever change-up too. Around off, Williamson ducks easily underneath"
"too straight from Amir, worked towards midwicket for an easy single"
"poor delivery. Very poor. It is short outside off, and at Faheem's pace, it's free runs. Sits up and Williamson drags the pull through midwicket, too easy"
"132 kph, good length outside off, pushed to cover"
"Shadab Khan at backward point. He is having a spectacular day. Good length delivery outside off, the ball seams away. It takes the outside half and lobs towards Shadab, who dives acrobatically to his left, and takes a sharp catch. Williamson looking to force that one, pushes atypically hard at it. Against the run of play, these two were looking so comfortable"
"good length outside off, the ball seaming back in, pushed to mid-on"

"short delivery outside off, inside-edged into the body. Is this surface slowing up?"
"good length outside off, pushed into the gap, towards the sweeper cover."
"short, wide and put away. Another poor delivery. Carved past backward point for four. Let the ball come to him before slashing it away"

"full delivery outside off, off the outside half towards cover for one"
"full delivery outside off, defended back"
"139 kph, short and wide outside off, carved away to point. The ball hits Shadab right on the knee, a stinger"
"excellent change in length. Out comes the bouncer, around off, Guptill sways out of the line late"
"a full delivery outside off, 136 kph, driven uppishly but straight to cover. More signs of this surface just slowing up a touch"
"short, 136 kph, doesn't get up as much which means it sits up for Guptill to swat through square leg"
"full around off, driven to mid-on. That's a good length to Taylor"
"134 kph, good length outside off, not moving as much, played away into the off side"
"lovely areas. On a length outside off, defended"

"<b>over square leg now!</b> Hasan drops it short on middle stump, he backs away again and swats this over the square leg fence"
"back of a length in the corridor, dabs it point's left with soft hands"
"<b>survives a run out chance.</b> Length ball on middle stump, taps it slightly to Azam's right at midwicket and takes off for a run. Nowhere near making his ground at the non-striker's end as the throw comes in...and misses"
"length ball just outside off, exposes the stumps and looks to bludgeon it over extra cover. Beaten"
"slower ball on a good length, in at leg stump. Taps it into the leg side, can't steal a second from deep midwicket"
<b>lbw appeal</b> turned down as Guptill goes through his pull shot early and misses. It hits him i the box region. There's no review. That might have been going over
"back of a length at off stump, pushes it straight to short third man...who runs in and completely misses the ball. Gives two where there were none"

"length outside off, swings his hands at this and gets beaten"
"short ball climbing outside off, cuts on the bounce to short third man"
"oh that's a poor ball. Looks for the seam up, quicker one. Drops it short and wide. He had three men behind square on the off side for that ball. No use. Guptil slaps it in front of square"
"slower ball, back of a length at off stump. Walks at the ball and looks to drop it into the off side with soft hands. It dribbles back towards the bowler"
"slower bouncer at off stump, completely deceives him. He looks to hook and gets an under edge onto boot. Guptill calls early as it rolls into the leg side and they take the single"
"back of a length on the pads, whipped uppishly to deep square leg"
another short one delivered slow. This time he's in a better position for the hook. Gets it to deep square's right along the floor
<b>no-ball and four.</b> This is quickly going all wrong for Pakistan. Raees has overstepped by a yard. He's tried a yorker too but it's overpitched on leg stump and Taylor has shuffled to tuck it past short fine leg
"slower bouncer, picks it up from wide outside off and swats it between deep square and deep midwicket. Deep square slides to his left and makes his ground but can't stop it"
"slower ball, back of a length. Dabbed straight to short third man"
"<b>top edge</b> falls short of Imam running in from short fine leg. <i>'Dive karle'</b> Sarfraz tells the young man as he's running in, but that's well out of his reach. Taylor was looking to ramp this length ball over short fine from outside off"
"short ball in the corridor, tapped to short third man"
"short ball outside off, pulls neatly to deep square"
"good length in the corridor, taps it to point with an open face. Easy run there. Shadab goes for the non-striker's end and there's no one backing up. An extra run for New Zealand. Sarfraz holds his forehead with both hands and takes some deep breaths..."
"back of a length at leg stump, whipped to deep square"
"good length on off stump, driven on the up to mid-off"
"full and wide outside off, crunched on the up to sweeper's right. Good effort from the fielder there, stops it with a slide to his right. Hafeez the man"
<b>miscues the pull</b> but he manages to clear the non-striker and the bowler. Was looking to pull but was hurried on it
"short and wide outside off, skids on quickly as he looks to punch on the up. Climbs on him too. But he has enough to clear extra cover and then beat both him and mid-off to the fence"
"length outside off, tapped into the off side"
"yorker on leg stump, clipped forcefully, straight to short fine"
"slower ball, short and wide outside off. Looks to pull and misses"

"short and turning away outside off, tapped through the covers"
"tossed up outside off, drives to long-on"

"yorker just outside off, squeezed out to sweeper cover"
"bounce in the corridor, shapes to pull and is forced to let it go"
<b>top edge</b> as he takes on the bouncer this time. Clears the keeper. Guptill was too far away from the ball for the hook
another bouncer. Dug in too short. He leaves it alone
"drops it short, gets punished. It's into Guptill's body, he's nicely under it and swings cleanly to send a long, loopy one over the boundary"
"good length on off stump, blocked on the front foot"
"short ball outside off, chopped straight to point"
"short ball outside off, chopped to sweeper cover"

"good length outside off, poked to point"
"good length outside off, driven on the up to long-off"
"back of a length and angled across off, dabbed straight to point"

"yorker on leg stump, clipped to fine leg"
"short ball at middle stump, pulled out to deep square and <b>that's the win</b>"
