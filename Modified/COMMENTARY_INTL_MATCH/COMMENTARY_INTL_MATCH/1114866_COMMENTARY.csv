"<b>George Bailey has taken a sensational catch at extra cover!</b> Does he know what he's done? That deserves more celebration than his signature grin. It's a back of a length ball climbing up at PAtterson, who closes the face too early and gets a leading edge. Bailey skips two steps in front and to his right at extra cover, then realises he's overdone the movement. Adjusts to go backwards at this point, one-handed to his right, and he hangs on"

<b>chipped back to the bowler</b> and it's another soft dismissal. Things looking dull as the required rate approaches 10. Another example of dip doing the batsman in. It grips too and stops on Wade as he looks to push with hard hands through the covers against this length ball. Not to the pitch of it and it's a harmless bunt back to Nair
"<b>Boyce has come in and been completely flummoxed</b> first ball. There's a stumping appeal against him. He's looking to flick this full ball from outside off, expecting the offspinner.
