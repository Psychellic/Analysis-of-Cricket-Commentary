good intent. Proper stride forward as he defends this from under his nose
gets on top of the bounce and blocks
"half-volley and Rahane has caressed this through cover. Bat-face turned ever-so-slightly but the weight transfer, still head and balance meant there was enough on it. So good to watch"
"slides this down leg, Rahane should be kicking himself for missing out on a tickle to fine leg. Wide called and rightly so"
the timing on that is simply outstanding. This was just a gentle push but the speed at which the ball raced off the bat was something else. He opened the bat face late to guide this past point. Delightful

"works this off his hip to square leg, quick single taken"
"<b> big appeal </b>, Smith and the bowler decide against the review. This was floated full and was veering into middle and leg, Rahane is hit on the pad as he plays outside the line. Height may have been in question. Angle would've most-certainly taken this down leg."

solidly defends the length ball on off to point
"slower and fuller just outside off, Kohli leaves again"
"he walks down the pitch, and punches this length ball through cover. This is the first delivery he's managed to time well today. Not much swing, so that made it easier for Kohli to execute."

"steers this uppishly over the cordon, down to third man"

"beauty. Nibbles away from off stump, much fuller. Rahane feeling for the delivery and beaten. No feet movement whatsoever that time"
"flat-bats this nearly to mid-on. Was dying on him. Risky stroke. This one came onto him faster than he expected, Rahane had to fetch it from outside off as well. Good work by Pat Cummins at mid-on. Just short of him"

"skiddy length ball on off, Kohli is onto his toes as he chops this behind the wicket. Looks for a single nevertheless but Rahane was firm and put his hand out quickly to say 'no'"

"pulled in front of square, called two immediately and will come back"
"sloppy work in the infield. Good work by the man at third man though, who was around the ropes to back up the throw from midwicket. Kohli dabbed it there and scampered a run, only to get a few more."

takes it on the full and creams this to deep cover

makes room and crashes this short ball to the cover boundary. He had all the time in the world to pick that where he wanted to
driven nicely off the frontfoot towards deep cover. Rahane was slow to turn for second and that may have cost him a split-second. He was ambling through the second when he realised the throw was coming to his end. Wade collected the throw cleanly and whipped the bails off to catch Rahane short despite a full-length dive. Credit to Hilton Cartwright as well for the super-flat throw. India lose one against the run of play
struck on the pad but outside the line. Went forward and across to defend but this held its line to hit him on the back pad

"a tad shorter, flatter and wider. Pandey defends towards cover and sets off for one, good running from Kohli"

"good length outside off, defended down, towards backward point"
"lovely bowling. Goes wide of the crease, and delivers this wide outside off. Pandey belatedly decides to leave"
"lovely wristwork. Full and straight, drilled back to the stumps at the bowler's end. Kohli has no time to turn back and get his bat back, but there was no hand from NCN"
"early-enough call from Pandey. Full outside off, defended towards point. Kohli sets off but is sent back in time"
"flight on middle, full, Pandey pushes to cover. Nice line"
"goes through. Pandey has struggled against pace this series. That's not a good shot. Hurried for pace again, goes back and looks to cut a straight ball. There is a hint of turn too. Both his feet are in the air as he missed the cut. A nothing shot, an awful shot. The ball clips the top of off. Put himself under pressure with so many dot balls, when he felt he needed a scoring shot, he needed to play it off a good ball"
drifts this down leg for a wide. Not a good start from Agar
"better. Lots of flight on middle and off, driven to cover"
"skewed off the inside half. Full and straight, driven to mid-on"
"flat and straight, punched to midwicket from the back foot"
"flat outside off, driven to long-off. Good defensive last ball from Agar, clever thinking to protect the over"
"fabulous batting. Agar may have cut that off in the cold of Nottingham, not here. Full outside off, Kohli runs at the bowler and converts an off-stump delivery into something on his pads. No midwicket there so that's four on this outfield"
"full outside off, dabbed to third man for one. Jadhav called 'noo' as opposed to wait, leaving Kohli fuming"
"keep it there to Jadhav early in his innings. Digs this in, down leg, pulled to fine leg awkwardly"

"a nice straight drive, half-stop from the bowler. Full outside off, driven back towards the bowler, who gets down. Mid-off fields"
"full outside off, Jadhav strides forward to defend"

"flat and wide outside off, sliced to the right of short third man"
"on the pads, driven to long-on"
"on the pads, nudged to square leg. Smith throws at the bowler's end, Agar doesn't back-up cleanly and allows an overthrow. Sloppy"
"on the pads again, nudged to short fine leg for one"
"quick and straight, clipped to fine leg. Seven riskless runs. Well played"
"on the pads, clipped down to fine leg. Can't bowl there. Lucky Kane."
another neat clip down to fine leg for one. Got to shift that line a set of stumps wider outside off
"more runs. Agar cuts this one off. Short on middle and off, sits up for Kohli to slap through midwicket for a couple."
"full and wide, crashed through to the sweeper cover for a run. Kohli calls for a drink, I've never seen him so fatigued in an innings"

"good length outside off, may have been the offcutter, patted to backward point."
"131 kph, length outside off, fifth-stump line, defended to point."
"three dot balls. Short and straight, slapped to midwicket. Not the length to pull. Now what?"
"130 kph, short and very wide outside off, not a bad option but far too much width. The ball beats Jadhav's cut, wide called"
"Kohli steals a bye. Wade is in the wars. A slower delivery outside off, bounces in front of Wade and hits him somewhere near the groin. Wade can't move. Kohli realises that and gets one, sensational game awareness. The ball was by his feet"
"saves Jadhav and capitalises. Full and wide outside off, sliced past backward point for four. All timing from Kohli. He's in control"
"good length outside off, dabbed to third man"

"flat down leg, Kohli misses a sweep, struck on the pad"
"flight outside off, drilled to long-off with a whippy action"
"flat and wide outside off, guided to third man"
"superb stroke. Flight outside off, a bit too much flight, Jadhav gets underneath the length and lofts the ball over cover. Once it beats the fielder, just admire your shot"
"the fine paddle sweep. Sensational hand speed through the ball. Flat down leg, Jadhav switches from an orthodox sweep to a powerful paddle sweep on the ground seeing the pace on the ball. Fine leg watches it go by"
"good length outside off, watches the ball onto his bat and then deflects it down to third man"
"don't give him width. It's short, it's wide, it's an invitation and Jadhav accepts. He gets underneath the length intentionally and carves a cut over backward point for six"
"good length outside off, Jadhav tries to work through square leg, like how Amla does, but can only tap it back"
"good length on off, worked towards square leg for one. Nicely played"
"a slower delivery dug in outside off, dug it in, good length to bowl, guided to point"

"fullish delivery outside off, driven to backward point. This game just waiting to be broken open"
"good length delivery on off, Kohli brings his wrists into play and guides this through square leg"
"and gone. Jadhav tries to get underneath and cut again but it was too full for that. He may have been better off trying to play that down, instead he brought his bat from down to up, which means the ball will only go up. The full length means there isn't enough elevation and Maxwell, at backward point, gobbles it up."
"excellent first delivery. A short well-directed bouncer on leg, Dhoni bails out of a pull very late"
"he has pulled that, and he has absolutely nailed it. Short down leg, not high enough. Unlike Jadhav, Dhoni brings his bat from up to down, keeping it all along the ground. Finds the gap at backward square leg with nonchalant ease."
"fullish delivery outside off, played to point"
"full on off, whipped to midwicket"
"wow, I've not seen many better shots. This was full, yes, but that wasn't nearly wide enough. He still manages to create an angle with his cover drive. His placement is exemplary, timing when is it not? Four."
"shortish outside off, pulled to midwicket. Not timed as well as he would have liked"
"shortish outside off, guided down to third man for one"
"short outside off, the ball is just inside the tramline. Dhoni leaves, anticipating a wide. The umpire ain't fooled"
"shortish outside off, patted down to point. Tidy over from Stoinis"
"bunted to midwicket. Good length on middle and leg, a clip finds midwicket"
"full and straight, worked to point. Kohli wants one, Dhoni coolly sends him back. No run there"
"good bowling this. A short slow delivery well outside off, Kohli wants to drag a pull but misses. A cry of anguish. Dhoni has a chat with Kohli"
"good stuff from Cummins at deep square leg. On Kohli's pads, why?, worked through midwicket for a couple."
"and chopped on! Kohli falls for 92. The ball has been seaming back in, Kohli chooses the wrong option of playing a dab down to third man, the ball takes the inside edge and hits the stumps. Maybe his first mistake of the day. Fantastic innings anyway"
"<b>a thick inside edge that just evades the stumps</b>. Phew, that was close! Full and straight, moving back in, Pandya defends and the ball moves back. Four to fine leg"
"full outside off, pushed to cover"
"full outside off, another defensive stroke to cover"
"a back of a length delivery outside off, blocked again. Dhoni forced into caution"

"good length delivery outside off, carved down towards gully"
"good length delivery on off, inside-edged towards square leg. Pandya scampers back for two, terrific running"
"an absolutely humongous wicket, not just because of who it is, but also because that could make a 25-run difference to the total. Full outside off, may have come off the surface slower than usual, and Dhoni drives too early. The ball goes up and Smith dives forward to take a good catch."
"full outside off, driven to the sweeper cover"
"another good length delivery around off, may have been the offcutter, Pandya is watchful in defense"
"edged and just wide of slip. Good length outside off, a thick outside edge runs down to third man"

"another full delivery outside off, Bhuvneshwar prods, a thick outside edge finds third man"
"good length outside off, seam movement back in, pushed back to the bowler"
"excellent bowling. A bouncer on off, Bhuvneshwar sways out of the line. Australia, rightly, in all-out attack"
"good length on off, Bhuvneshwar doesn't get his body behind the line but does get his bat there"
"chopped <strong>over the stumps</strong>. Not a good option with the ball moving back in. Good length on middle and leg, Bhuvneshwar chops this into the surface and then over the stumps. Risky"
"terrific bowling. Another well-directed bouncer on leg, an awkward fend away to square leg"
"good length outside off, left alone, 146 kph. Another excellent over from Cummins"
"the fuller length outside off, driven to mid-off. India may need 250"
"nicely hit. Good length outside off, nicely punched through cover for one"
"another good bouncer. Short, aimed at the badge, Pandya wants to pull but bails out late"
"on a length around off, defended into the off side"
"on middle and leg, Pandya fails to adequately connect with a flick, a bit of a leading edge towards cover"
"on a length around off, guided towards backward point for a well-judged run. Maxwell had to run around the ball to get the ball in his right hand"
"slapped through cover. Short and wide, and that width gives Pandya the invitation. Hammers a stabbed jab through cover"
"good single. Back of a length on middle, pushed towards midwicket for a run"
"pushed into the gap at sweeper cover for a run. Full and wide from Cummins, good option with a slip and gully"
"excellent line. Full, coming back in from outside off towards the top of off. Blocked to point"
"guided past point for a couple. Full and wide, just dabbed away. Zampa at third man has to cut it off"
"full outside off, driven to Stoinis at cover. Slightly expensive from Cummins, but not a bad over at all"
"overpitched on off, driven to Smith at cover"
"a short slower cutter outside off, Bhuvneshwar misses a cut. Some extra bounce maybe"
"full on off, defended to cover. These are vital dots"
"good fielding from Cartwright at midwicket. Full and straight, nudged to the fielder's right. He set off quickly and forced Pandya into refusing the run"
"a short slow delivery outside off, Bhuvneshwar waits for the ball to come to him before pulling through midwicket. Kept that down"
"good over from Stoinis, just two off. Good length again outside off, moving back in. Inside-edged towards midwicket"
"144 kph, on a length around middle and leg, worked to midwicket"
"reverse swing maybe? Full and straight, the ball moving back in prodigiously. Pushed to mid-on, his feet nowhere"
"full outside off, driven to Warner at mid-off. And taking Warner on is always risky. But Pandya judged it well. Warner missed anyway"
"excellent bowling. Goes wide of the crease and executes a 137 kph yorker on off, jammed out nicely enough"
"full and straight, driven back to the bowler."
"good length outside off, seam movement back in, slashed down to third man"
"there comes the big shot, but badly timed. Short on middle and leg, swatted down to long-on"
nicely played. Dabs the length delivery around off towards square leg
"a slower ball around middle and leg, nudged down to fine leg"
"a late call of no from Pandya. Full and straight, driven to mid-off. Warner is quick on it, misses the stumps at the bowler's end. <strong>Out with a direct hit</strong>"
"a leading edge. Shortish and straight, looks to work the ball into the leg side but the leading edge trickles away to the sweeper cover. Clear signs of a slow surface"
"full and straight, played away quietly to point. Terrific over"
"short outside off, punched away to the sweeper cover. This is NCN's last over"
"the wild swing, aimed to go over long-on, but Bhuvneshwar will take it, the ball has gone a 180 degrees wide of where he intended, to third man for four off the edge"
"whaaat happened there? Good length outside off, slower ball. Bhuvneshwar wants to pull, then thinks of cutting, then tries to take the bat away, but the ball hits the leading edge, lobs up and in front of point"
"yikes! Bhuvneshwar has nailed his <strong>drive right back at Pandya</strong>. Friendly fire! The Australian fielders are concerned, they go to Pandya to check on his wellbeing. Ouch. Hit him on the helmet, hit so hard that Pandya had no time to get out of the way. A painful blow but he's fine to go."
"tennis-ball bounce. Short on middle and off, Bhuvneshwar misses an upper cut. Way over the head. Wide"
"full and straight, the ball moves back in, a skewed heave finds long-on. The ball is always going to go to the leg side"
"short on middle and leg to finish. Pandya makes room but misses his cut. Good option, but can't execute. Fantastic spell from NCN ends"
"full and wide outside off, a mis-timed drive to the sweeper cover for a couple."
"a good slower ball, dipping full toss outside off, sliced to the keeper. Deceived Bhuvneshwar"
"another slower ball outside off, played away to point for one"
"a high full toss outside off, Pandya skews his heave but can only find Smith at cover. Smith wants the run-out too, he throws the ball back to the bowler and Richardson takes off the bails with Pandya nowhere in sight. Looks like it is over waist, and that should be a no-ball. It is. There is a free hit, but no cricket as the players run off. Chaos. Smith has a chat with the umpires about it. Australia definitely completed the run-out as Pandya started walking off. Smith arguing that the <b>ball was not dead</b>. Did the umpires signal out? They did not call it a no-ball on the field because the third umpire decided that."
"a legcutter outside off, a thick under edge to the keeper"
"full on off, somehow Bhuvneshwar gets so much elevation as he gets underneath the length. Smith runs back and to his left from cover, gets underneath it, <strong>and spills the chance</strong>. His body almost balancing on the side of his head."
"gone this time. Full around off and middle, Bhuvneshwar gets underneath again and hits the ball straight up. Maxwell runs in from long-on and completes the catch. Too early through the ball, may have been some pace off the ball from Richardson"
"good length outside off, jags away and beats Kuldeep. There's some carry"
"oh yes. Wade will feel a lot better now, mentally at least. Full and wide outside off, Kuldeep wafts with his weight firmly on the back foot. Gets a thick outside edge that flies towards Wade, who wanted to go with both hands, but improvised midway through knowing that he can't get there. So he stuck out his left hand, behind his back and hung on. One of the better catches you'll see"
"good length on middle and leg, dabbed back up the pitch. Cummins runs to the ball to prevent a run"
a wide. A short slower bouncer that's well over Bumrah's head. Why the slower bouncer? The right length but could have used the pace
"weeee, a slog that is intended to go over midwicket but the thick outside edge races down to the third man boundary. Third man should be fine for tail-enders but not sure even he would have got around"
"full and wide, guided to third man"
"good length outside off, dabbed to third man for one. He'll keep strike"
"smashed! But straight down to long-off. A slower full toss outside off, and intentionally bowled that wide outside off. Pandya hits it decently but not well enough. Finds Warner"
"another slow full toss on off, dabbed to cover for one. Bat on ball, par for the course now"
"another slower ball outside off, Bumrah's big swing travels only as far as the bowler"
"another boundary. Bumrah's cameo lifts India past 250. Another slower ball outside off, the heave trickles into the boundary at square leg. The fielder was up."
"a legcutter outside off, far and wide, dabbed to backward point for a run."
"run-out! And India are all out. A short and wide slower ball that is very wide outside off, Chahal can't connect, he runs down before Bumrah sends him back. Wade runs up and hits the stumps directly."
"hint of movement in the air, full and just outside off, left alone"
gets this length ball to go the other way - nip back in - and hit him high on the box as he plays all around it. <b> Ouch </b>
minimal feet movement as he bunts this length ball on off with soft hands
tucks this to Chahal at square leg as they scamper through. Warner wasn't sure of the run but trusted his mate. Even a direct hit wouldn't have been enough here
"gets this length ball to nip away from outside off, Warner lets it go. Zips to Dhoni"
"gets one to come back in off the seam, Warner hops back and defends back down the pitch. Excellent start from Bhuvi"

"floats a full-length delivery on off, Cartwright is well forward as he bunts this to the off side"

"late on the attempted flick, this length ball comes back in and hits him on the pad and deflects wide of Dhoni as they steal a leg-bye"
"this is stunning from Bumrah. Zips across the length ball that pitches on off and deviates away, Warner is late on the stroke. Beaten"

"invites the drive by pitching this up outside off, left alone"
"full and just around off again, defended solidly this time"
"floats this full, just around off, gets this to nip back in. Cartwright blocks"
"comes closer to the stumps and delivers a full delivery that moves away off the seam from off stump, watched through to Dhoni"
"<b> this is almost like how he got Hafeez on his T20I debut. </b> String of dot balls may have played on Cartwright's mind. This is a good length delivery just around off, Cartwright isn't sure if this one's going away or coming in. Pokes at the delivery without any conviction and sees the ball beat the inside edge and crash into the stumps. Bhuvneshwar's foot was very close to the line, but Cartwright has been told he can continue walking."
punches this skiddy length ball to deep poin
shuffles across and whips this short of length ball off his hip towards deep square

"shuffles across but Bumrah gets this to move away in the air, the length is fuller on off, he gets behind the line and blocks"

"angles a length ball across the left-hander, Warner lets it go this time"
"banana swing from Bhuvi, gets this to move away in the air and little more after it pitches, left alone"

"he's bowled to him a million times in the nets for Sunrisers, does him with a beauty that is pouched superbly at second slip. Floats this full and away, gets this to nip away after pitching, Warner doesn't drive but simply hangs his bat out to get a thick edge that flies to Rahane, who takes is safely. Australia in trouble already. What an inspired burst this is turning out to be"
"this one's full and comes back in to hit Head on the pad, they take a run off the deflection. There was a stifled appeal but this pitched way outside leg"
"<b> flies past leg stump. Oooh! </b> How lucky is Head? Pokes at an away-going length ball, got a thick inside edge. On another day, he would've chopped on"

"angles a length ball across the left-hander, left alone"
"looks to force this through mid-on, gets the inner half of the bat to beat square leg. Chahal hares across and then dishes in a dive to pull it back in near the deep square boundary"

lovely roll of the wrists as he whips this length ball on middle and leg to the square leg boundary. Easily done
"<b> dropped! </b> Pokes at an away-going delivery, this flew low to Rohit who was late to move low down to complete that catch at first slip. Oh, dear. Was a healthy edge, it looked like Rohit moved late. And while he managed to get into position, a split-second late resulted in the catch going down. Hit his palm and went down"

"full and just around off, defended from the crease"

"he's having an off day is Bumrah. Drops this short, Smith uses the depth of the crease to get on top of the bounce and punch that away between cover and point"
"yorker at the base of off, Smith looks to shuffles across and whip and was off balance as the ball descended, somehow managed to keep that out"
"rare miss from Dhoni, who doesn't get much glove as he looks to stop that down leg. Length ball angling down, Smith shuffled across to whip it square but missed it too"

"squared up by the length, Smith defends this off the backfoot"
"starts off with a length ball on off, Head looks to pull but this kept just a touch low to beat his swing."
right onto the backfoot as he blocks
"this is a poor ball, it went to the midwicket boundary even before Pandya could complete his followthrough. Too short, Head got into position quickly and hammered that away"
"not all that full but Head leans into the drive and executes this superbly into the gap. Rahane sprints towards the cover boundary and parries it back to Pandey, who in-turn relays it to the keeper. Good work, all of it to save one run."

"excellent comeback delivery, a short ball that buzzes past Smith's left ear as he looks to avoid the bouncer"

"nicely tossed up, just outside off, Smith gets forward and blocks"

worked with the spin towards deep square
too straight and Head's picked him away towards deep midwicket from middle
driven firmly but straight to Kohli at extra cover
"too straight. Length ball on middle and leg and he's flicked that away past Bumrah at mid-on. Lovely use of the wrists to pick the gap. Mind you, the weight wasn't fully forward, so this was all the more astonishing. It's flying off his blade at the moment. Pandya is struggling"

shuffles across Smith style and whips this towards Chahal at deep square. It raced away faster than he expected
driven firmly on the up but straight to mid-off

"full on middle and leg, squeezed to long-on"
"missed out on the full toss, hit straight to deep midwicket this time"
"too easy, the full toss has done the trick this time. Waist-high full toss, this was dipping on him though. He could've swung this wherever he pleased. What does he do? Flick it straight to Pandey at midwicket. Head was in sparkling form but will have to go."

"sharp turn from outside off, came back in sharply to hit the pad off a thin inside edge. Things happening"

whips this against the turn towards deep midwicket
worked with the spin towards deep midwicket

"swept deep into the stands at deep midwicket. Nothing wrong with the delivery, gave it nice flight, Maxwell was down on one knee as he swept this fiercely over the roopes"
"he bowls this just a touch quicker, perhaps as a result of the previous delivery, but it makes no difference. This is also on leg stump, he's down on one knee as he sweeps this behind sqyuare."
"sweeps and misses, this was the googly. He shortened his length as well. Pitched outside leg though"
chops this cut to cover
"appeal for caught behind but there's no bat on it. Smith looks to tickle this in-drifter. Smith is amused, didn't hit anything. Don't normally see Dhoni appeal unless he's supremely confident, but this time he too was wrong"
eased with the spin to long-off as they jog the single
"tosses this up outside off to beat Maxwell in flight as he looks to slap this away. Harsh call from the umpire, who thought this was way outside off"

"good stop by Pandey at cover, this was nicely flighted and he really went after that one"

"gets this to drift into middle, Maxwell lunges forward and blocks"
"sharp turn from off stump, shortened his length just a touch, bunted to Jadhav at point"
"there's the magic ball. Dhoni isn't generally pumped up but boy, is he animated or what? Outstanding work by Chahal. Tossed it up but slowed it down nicely, he saw Maxwell charge down so lobbed this towards middle and leg, Maxwell, who senses he may not have gotten to the pitch of the ball, looks to turn this to the leg side, but the ball deflects off his right pad as the ball went between his legs, Dhoni collects it and smashes the stumps to leave Maxwell way outside the crease. Huge moment in the game."

worked with the spin to midwicket for an easy single
"slow turn from off stump, touch short as well, punched to long-off"
"too full, too much width and he's crashed that to the cover boundary. Cry of anguish from Dhoni, as if to say 'that's not the line I asked you to bowl.' This was right in his hitting arc"
"too short this time, tucked away towards Chahal at fine leg. Risky second but the throw wasn't the greatest"
"googly, not to the pitch of the ball, rolls off the leading edge towards point"

"nibbles away from length, just outside off, Stoinis is beaten as he prods without any conviction"

"on the pads, worked to square leg"
"a big appeal from Kuldeep, on the pads again, Smith misses a flick but the ball takes the thigh pad. Dhoni collects cleanly"
"flight outside off, worked to long-on for fifty. A terrific innings from Smith. <b>Australia's first fifty of the series</b>"
"flat outside off, the googly, defended"
"another quick dart on middle and leg, nudged into the leg side. Australia staying cautious against Kuldeep"

"full and straight, 134 kph, driven on the up to mid-on"
"good length outside off, somehow gets the ball to move away juuuust a touch. Enough at this level though. Awkwardly defended"
"beaten again. Good length outside off, Smith looks to force a stab through the off side but no connection"
"good length on off, Smith watches the ball onto his bat as he defends"
"raaaces away. You have to finish your over well. Drifts down leg and that's Smith's meat and drink as he flicks down to fine leg. Easy. Stayed patient, got the bad ball and put it away. Fabulous batting"
"the googly on middle, full. Stoinis, I thought, read that quite well and drove to long-off"
"flat on the pads, Smith tickles it away to square leg for a single."
"darted in, quicker through the air, flat outside off, turns in, inside-edged into the pad"
"too full from Kuldeep. 'Na, na, na,' goes Dhoni, no translation needed. Stoinis doesn't need to read it, as he drives elegantly through cover"
"the googly, pitched well outside leg so Stoinis can read it, stay back and defend"
"<b>did not read that</b>, full on middle and leg, inside-edged through square leg for a run"
"full and straight, defended"
"<strong>terrific length</strong>. Just dragged that length back after the previous delivery, Stoinis tries to read it off the pitch, follows the legbreak but is beaten"
"and this one doesn't turn as much, flat on middle and leg, Stoinis defends"
"more flight, this time on middle and leg, watchfully kept out"
"the edge. Flat outside off, gets a thick outside edge which flies to Jadhav at backward point, who slipped over his ankle. Youch, he walks off"
"another dart, pushed through quick on middle and leg, Smith stays back and gets his bat down just in time"

"a slower ball outside off, Smith goes into this with all he has, and gets a thick outside edge which is straight to a non-existent wide slip."
"another slower ball outside off, driven to cover"
"Jadeja takes the catch, it's a huge wicket for India, so much so that it makes them clear favourites now. Pandya uses this delivery very well, the hard-length bouncer, on middle and leg. Climbs steeply on Smith who can't quite keep his pull down. Jadeja misjudges it, but runs in from deep square leg and takes the routine catch. It was set for Smith, but he's been done in. Hurried for pace and a little extra bounce too"
"good length outside off, seam movement back in, defended"
"the legbreak, flat outside off, nudged to midwicket"
"the googly, lots of loop but way down leg, so Stoinis can pick the googly and work towards square leg"
"flight outside off, driven up to long-off. Full enough for him to play that stroke"
"the googly, well read by Wade, full outside off, defended, smothered"
"more flight on middle and off, too full, kept out"

"good length around off, a thick outside edge this time, third man cleans up"
"carved down to third man, keeps it wide outside off on a length. Good batting from these two"
"full and very wide outside off, left alone, wide called"
"lovely shot. Knew there was a big gap at midwicket. And found it. Short on off, pulled through midwicket with ease. In the air, but who cares?"
"full and wide outside off, no stroke from Stoinis"
"full and straight, Wade thrusts his bat in front of the pad to defend"
"chopped on! Lots of turn and Kuldeep has his front. The routine legbreak, so slow outside off, Wade goes back and tries to cut with an angled bat (more 45 degrees, than the traditional 90), but the ball takes the inside edge and hits the stumps. Big big trouble now for Australia"
"given out first ball, and Australia are capitulating. Agar opts not to review. It's the loopy legbreak, Agar plays all around it and misses a full toss - the ball pitches after he missed it. Hits him in front of leg. Umpire Chaudhary's index finger indicates trouble that Australia may not be able to get out of now. It's wristspin again"
"and he has it. <b>Kuldeep takes a hat-trick</b>, and the Eden Gardens goes wild. India are jumping around like 11 children on a playground that have just seen an icecream truck roll in. It's a googly, pitches outside off, Cummins gets forward, looks to defend, but the ball takes the outside edge and settles nicely in Dhoni's gloves. The third Indian hat-trick taker in ODIs"
"another googly, pitches down leg, turns away, very awkwardly defended"
"flat outside off, turning back in, clipped to midwicket. It's a triple-wicket maiden. If you had any doubts about whose game this was before this over, this should settle things"

"pushed through, flat and quick outside off, punched to the sweeper cover"

"the googly outside off, Coulter-Nile leaves confidently"
"the top edge. Flat on middle and leg, looks for the big sweep, gets a thick edge which flies past slip. Chahal at third man runs it down rapidly"
"the googly on leg, blocked"
"78 kph, the stock ball on middle and leg, drilled to long-on"
"74 kph, pitches on middle and leg, hits the inside edge and then rolls away towards slip."
"on middle and leg, worked to midwicket"
"good length outside off, punched to the sweeper cover from the crease"
"full outside off, Stoinis defends"
"just short of Jadeja at deep square leg. How did he get so close? Short on middle and leg, pulled away in the air towards square leg, where Jadeja runs in to his right, dives full-length forward and almost completes a stunner"
"a low full toss outside off, a thick outside edge races to Kohli's right at wide slip, who sticks out a hand and stops four, I'll do what I want, says Kohli"
"full and wide, drilled to the sweeper cover"
"nicely played, gets low down to sweep and executes a neat paddle sweep. Bumrah dives but can only help it into the boundary in rather awkward fashion"
"lovely shot. As soon as it was full, Stoinis had decided on an attacking shot, got underneath ably enough and drilled a lofted drive past cover"
"the stock ball, flat on middle and leg, spins back in and hits him on the pad"
drifts down leg for a wide
"pitched on leg, the edge down to third man for a run. Chahal cuts it off at third man"
"somehow misses the stumps. 74 kph, full outside off, Coulter-Nile does not read it, stays back and has an inside edge to thank for not being lbw. The ball also misses the stumps, not by much, after hitting the pad"
"the googly, pitches on off, spins away and beats the bat"
"130 kph, a slower ball outside off, defended to point"
"good length around off and middle, worked away through square leg"
"full on middle and leg, driven back to the bowler"
"a slower ball outside off, Coulter-Nile misses a cut."
"another offcutter, outside off, sliced down to third man for one"
"a slower ball outside off, blocked to backward point. These two doing well to take this late, gives them a chance, however slim it may be"
"plenty of flight on off, driven to long-off"
"bat-pad, or just pad. Pad, says ump Chaudhary. Flat down leg, lobs up off the pad"
"driven towards extra cover, Stoinis is sent back belatedly and has to make a dive for it. Kohli's throw is quick to Dhoni, who deflects the ball into the stumps. There's no other combination in world cricket that could have made this doubtful, but Stoinis' bat is just in. He used the back of the bat in contact with the ground"
"superb shot. Flight on middle and off, Stoinis gets so much power on his sweep behind square. Races away"
"79 kph, drifts down leg. Dhoni can't collect so there's two free runs for Australia"
"the googly outside off, driven back to the bowler"

"full outside off from Pandya, driven to mid-off"
"full around off, pushed back to the bowler."
driven to Kohli at mid-off for a run
"and Australia are now nine down. It's that length again, short on middle and leg. Hurries Coulter-Nile for pace, who is far too late on his pull. The ball hits the upper half of the bat and just lobs up to Pandya for his second"
"did he have to go one hand? Terrific effort nonetheless. Full and wide outside off, Richardson drives to cover's right, Chahal dives but can't hang on"
"full outside off, a thick outside edge that lands in front of Kohli's left hand at wide slip"
"IPL skills in play, the flat trajectory, straight line and good length. Defend is all Stoinis can do"
"<strong>just short of Kohli at slip again</strong>. Flight on middle and leg, gets a thick edge which lands in front"
"there's six. Runs to the pitch, gets there and hammers a straight drive that is struck ferociously. A flat six over the bowler's head"
a paddle sweep towards fine leg for one. Moves to 49
"77 kph, flight outside off, comfortably defended"
"whew, what was that? The googly rips past leg stump. Richardson walked right across, exposing all his stumps and the ball looked set for them, until it didn't. Wow. <strong>Another terrific spell from Chahal</strong>"
"on the pads, nudged to square leg. By ODI standards, 64 off 54 is a dawdle. Blame those wickets"
"fullish outside off, driven to mid-off"
"<strong>there's Stoinis' fifty.</strong> Some applause from the crowd. A slower, full ball on off, Stoinis gets underneath the length and sends it soaring over the bowler's head. Massive six."
"short and wide, sliced to the deep point fielder"
"nicely played, full down leg, clipped down to fine leg. Stoinis refuses the run"
"to both fielders either side of the wicket behind square, both nice strokes too, but no runs. Full and wide, carved down to third man"
"full on the pads from Bumrah, worked to deep midwicket. Still no run"
"on a length around off, chopped towards backward point"
"wow, what power. Stoinis. On the pads, a low full toss, and Stoinis whips this behind square. Keeps going and going. Unbelievable how batting has changed"

"full outside off, driven towards extra cover. Still no run."
"can't get the single this time. Full and straight, defended back. Bumrah quick to prevent the run"
"full, straight and given! Australia choose to review. Richardson played all around his flick, was hit on the pad in front of middle and leg. 'No bat involved' says the umpire. Three reds and Australia go down 2-0 in this series"
