a fairly heavy ball absolutely thuds into the middle of the bat. Solid defence on off stump
"134 kph, substantial bounce, and it's enough to beat Stoinis' attempted cut over point"
"<b>147 kph and it's too good again</b>. Having bowled a couple of fast short ones, he has the batsman unsure against a full delivery. Stoinis doesn't move his feet and has a lazy old flash at it"
"<b>direct hit at the bowler's end would have sent him back</b>. Laughlin at mid-off makes good ground - to be fair there really isn't a single there, it's a panicked run from a make-shift opener after he pushes down the ground"
nudges it away off his hips to long leg
<b>149 kph and too quick for the batsman again</b>. Stoinis has barely decided the kind of shot he wants to play before this good length ball careens into his pads
flays this almost overpitched outside off to mid-off
pulls a back of a length delivery to square leg. Not quite short enough to get leverage on it
"good catch at mid-off! Dunk looks to force the pace against a good length ball on off stump. He wants to lift it over the infield, but mistimes the shot. Laughlin runs back, leaps up and takes a fine catch to get the Strikers' fans up on their feet"
"fullish on off stump, blocks"
gets back behind the shortish delivery on middle and deflects it backward of square leg
"oh, that's vintage KP. Walks into the shot as he whips a length ball outside off to the right of mid-on."
"bangs it halfway down the pitch and it sails past KP's pull, down the leg side"
"142 kph, shuffles across outside off in the hopes of yanking a back of a length delivery through midwicket. Trouble is, there's too much bounce and the ball goes to mid-on"
"gorgeous strike! He shifts himself across the wickets, hangs so very deep in his crease to deal with Stanlake's extra pace, and he pulls to the square leg boundary"
"<b>could have been lbw, should have been run-out</b>. Fierce ball - straight, aimed at leg stump, it has KP swinging right across the line and pins him on the back leg. Not sure why the ump shakes his head for that, but then Strikers could have taken that out of the equation if point had hit the stumps direct at the batter's end"
"goes for a heave again and makes no contact. Regardless of that, with a poor throw, they pinch a couple"
<b>150 kph and it crashes into off stump</b>! KP wants to take on the fast bowler. Or he's worried one ball has his name on it at this pace. Backs away and looks to carve it over cover. Only offers a clear passage through to the sticks
"full on middle and leg, Handscomb nudges to short midwicket"
"fullish on off stump, he drives to mid-off"
reads the slower ball off the back of the hand and lashes it through extra cover. First boundary of the match for the Stars
swivels on his back foot and pulls the top-pace delivery this time to the long leg boundary. Effortless hit
clips a full delivery on leg stump to deep square leg
"fullish on off stump, steers it to point"
doesn't offer any room and as a result Handscomb can only defend it down the pitch
"fuller delivery outside off, drives to short cover"
"carves it over point! Fierce hit. Once he has the room to free the arms, all of that power comes into play"
"the cover fielder got a hand to it, and yet the ball nearly goes to the boundary, so hard is Stoinis hitting these balls, these tripe, short and wide balls"
"slower ball, kisses the pad and wanders down to the wicketkeeper. Carey's been quite impressive behind the stumps all season and he does the job well again"
picks the gap dead square and the ball screams away to the point boundary. A superb cut shot on a superb pitch - plenty of pace and bounce and the ball comes right onto the bat
"back of a length, off-pace ball outside off. Stoinis is there ready to face it a touch too early and adjusts at the last second. Taps it towards point"

pulls the back of a length ball on middle and leg to deep square leg.
gets down the track and finds a bottom edge down to deep third man
"backs away to open up the off side - which is packed inside the circle, but not so much in the deep. Stoinis' full-blooded cut finds point"
<B>misfield</B> from Siddle at square leg allows Stoinis to pinch a single after a flick shot
"<b>straight up and the wicketkeeper secures the skier</b>. Handscomb goes for the slog, put under pressure because of the dots he's consumed. Spots a back of a length ball, goes after it too early, gets a top edge and walks back to the pavilion"
"looks for the yorker, it becomes a low full toss at 142 kph, Stoinis presents the full face of the bat at it"
"flat, hard and ridiculous! There is no way balls at this pace should be hit with such disdain. But Stoinis picks the short ball so early and pulls it so that it pings right onto the adevertising skirting"
hammers it down the ground! This is a length ball and Stoinis clears the front leg and launch it right over the bowler's head. Stanlake's ego must be leaking blood
"top edge over the wicketkeeper! The bouncer climbs high enough that Stoinis attempting a hook doesn't time it properly. Still, he gets the hat-trick of boundaries"
flicks a full delivery on middle to short midwicket
"145 kph, back of a length and holding its line outside off to beat Stoinis' poke. <b>Outstanding ball</B> to end the over."
"full and outside off, he drives through to sweeper cover"
hangs back to read the spin off the pitch and hastily works a good length ball towards midwicket
"wrong 'un on off stump, Maxwell plants his front leg across and has to pull it back a bit to hit to mid-on"
"taken at long-off! Nothing can stop Rashid! He lobs it up, daring the big-hitter to go for the big hit. Stoinis does, perhaps only looking to chip it, but it carries all the way to Laughlin"

"tosses it up outside off, Gotch flicks it to deep midwicket"
pushes to long-on
defends a shortish delivery outside off to cover
lets the shortish ball come on and tries to pinch a single to point. No luck
glides a back of a length delivery to deep third man
"waits that millisecond extra to beat point on his left. What a sensational cut shot. He can play shots like these if he gives himself half a chance. Question is, will he do so often enough? This is his kind of pitch. Plenty of pace, even bounce."
"the bowler, nervous at the possibility of leaking runs, goes for the wide line. Strays too far with a full length ball"
flicks a shortish delivery on leg stump through midwicket
"full in length, but flat in trajectory, and that's why Maxwell is late in stepping forward to block"
"<b>gorgeous ball</b>! It is meant to draw Maxwell forward, and the turn then makes him overbalance, almost enough to have him stumped"
works a fuller delivery to long-on
"nudges a full, tossed up delivery outside off to long-on"
plenty of wristwork in sending a flighted delivery outside off to long-on
<b>googly and it only just misses the stumps</b>! What a ball. It's slow. it's tossed up above the eyeline. It gives Maxwell too much time and in that time he does very little. Doesn't move his feet. Tries to play from the crease. Looks to late cut it away to third man. Beaten between bat and pad
works it through square leg
"back of a length on off stump, blocks it"
"fullish on off stump, keeps it out"
"full and angled into middle and leg, Maxwell goes for the heave over midwicket. Misses out"

turns a good length ball off his pads to deep square leg
defends a good length ball to cover
nudges a full delivery outside off to long-on
"gap between short third man and point - it's only about six feet between them - and he somehow sends a slower ball bouncer, angled in at leg stump, through that gap. <b>Maxwell playing trick shots now</b>"
"shovels a full ball on off stump over extra cover. What a shot. He clears that front leg, ensures a still head, waits on the ball to arrive, gets under it and gives it plenty of air time with the bottom hand. <b>Outrageous</b>"
too leg-sidish and Maxi heaves it away to deep square leg
"<b>googly</B> drifting into middle and leg. Maxi is looking to push it through the off side, but gets an inside edge to long-on"
"<b>reverse sweep</b> and with point and third man up inside the circle, that shot is always on. There's just enough width on the ball for Maxi to justifiably play that shot and he succeeds splendidly"
"full on middle and leg, works it through midwicket"
flat-batted swat against a short delivery outside off down to long-on
"looks to slog a tossed up delivery outside off, but it drifts in and dips enough to worry Maxwell and lure a mistimed hit to deep square leg"
turns a googly on off stump to short fine leg
stays perfectly still on middle carves a full delivery on middle to sweeper cover
"full on middle, with Gotch moving across his stumps and being pinned low on the front pad. Siddle belts out <b>a big lbw shout</b> and he has reason to feel aggrieved. Three reds on Hawkeye"
works it away through midwicket
"back of a length and outside off, steers it behind point"
full and outside off - very full actually - as Maxwell tries to slash it away through cover. Doesn't quite pull it off. He throws his head back in great disappointment and the replays show why - <b>he's nicked it to the wicketkeeper and no one appealed</b>
"full and on the pads, Maxwell belts a leg glance straight at short fine leg. Even a foot either side, with the timing he has on the shot, would have been a boundary"
"right across his crease again to flick a full, 143 kph to the left of long leg"
"looks to slog a good length ball outside off, but the 143 kph pace on it makes him miscue straight down the pitch"
""
"full toss down leg, Maxwell, his back leg outside off, looking to open up the square leg to long leg regions, ends up not being able to reach far enough"
"back of a length and outside off, Maxwell goes for the cut, but is beaten by extra bounce"
<b>bottom edge to the third man boundary</b>. Wanders away to leg to try and power the ball away - his concentration only on that - and so loses all his shape against a good length ball outside off
"short and outside off, he slashes it over point"
low full toss which dips on Gotch. Flick to deep midwicket
"slower ball on the pads, Maxwell tucks it to backward square leg"
"<b>dropped</b> at cover by the captain Head. It's hit fiercely, and he has to move to his left as well to get behind it. Ends up being a touch too late because of the power behind the shot"
"<b>run-out next ball</b>. A slower ball bouncer that he taps towards point ends up as his undoing. A little mix-up with Maxwell on whether there is a single or not takes too much time to clear up. Gotch says 'wait wait,' but his senior partner has covered three-fourth the distance down the pitch and so he has to sacrifice his wicket. Even the big dive doesn't help him"
"114kph, full and outside off, works it to long-on"

"yorker on middle, Faulkner clips it through square leg"
"another yorker, tailing into leg stump, Maxwell clears the front leg and laces it to cover. A misfield allows a second"
"<B>that's unreal</b>! A length ball on off stump from a fast bowler has been reverse swatted to the point boundary. That has the power of a cut shot, so quickly does it race to the boundary"
"short ball on off stump, he backs away and pulls between long-on and deep midwicket"
"shapes to make room again, Siddle follows him with a yorker, and watches Maxwell promptly scuttling out of the way and collecting a wide"
"yorker on middle, keeps it out"
"makes room, Siddle follows him and ends up bowling too far wide"
he's taken a stance <i>well</i> outside leg and has a big heave ho against a full delivery on off stump. Takes an outside edge which lands in the Strikers' captain's hands as he backtracks from cover. Good stuff.

"full and outside off - right over the wide line - and with Hastings eager to stay leg side to slog everything, it's the perfect dot ball"

"yorker, swinging in late. Faulkner only gets an inside edge onto pad"

"back of a length and outside off, pulls to deepish mid-on"
"finally does what he needs to and attacks the body. With no room, Carey can only punch it back down the pitch"
"bunts a fuller delivery outside off down the ground, and it seems as if the ball comes off the track a lot slower than he expects. Carey is set up to hit that ball a lot squarer but it goes straight down the ground."
"yorker at the base of leg stump, nudges to mid-on"
"superb timing again, and away she goes to the cover boundary. Coleman's turn to offer width and Carey, ensuring he doesn't over-hit the ball, reaps great rewards"

"fires it into the pads at 94 kph, works it through midwicket"

"<b>nearly bowls him</b> with an offbreak that is flat, but full in length. Because of that, Carey is stuck in the crease and only just produces an inside edge to save himself"
"huge appeal for a stumping down leg, and the excitement is warranted. Weatherald is gone after a bit of magic from Handscomb. He shuffles across past leg stump after the batsman misses a big sweep. Collects the ball cleanly and then whips the bails off before Weatherald's back foot can even get close to the line"

"with Carey's desire to stay leg side, he has to reach out to make contact with this full delivery way outside off. Single to deep cover"
"smears it to the right of mid-off while being in no position to play the shot. His back leg is up off the ground. His bat is whirling madly. Having set up for a straight ball, he gets the one ball he is not set up for and somehow smashes that to the boundary"

offcutter - which comes out a full toss outside off - Head slogs and misses because the ball dips on him

Stoinis goes full pace as he gets through a short ball, making it climb nice and high. Head, rushing down the track, is panicked into playing a shot. The pull. When the ball is up above his left shoulder. Classic top edge ball"
