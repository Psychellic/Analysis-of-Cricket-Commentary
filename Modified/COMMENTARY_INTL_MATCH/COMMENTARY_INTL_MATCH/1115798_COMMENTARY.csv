mistimes a pull to Gayle at short fine leg. This skid back in faster than he expected
"pulled but can't find the gap at midwicket, cramped for room"
"catch? <strong>Dropped.</strong> Decent chance, thick edge as he shaped to cut, Walton didn't get up in time. Half a chance, really."
rocks back and cuts this slider straight to point. Outstanding first over
"overpitched and Guptill has blasted that through cover. Hint of swing, he got right to the pitch to play that. What a welcome"
"shortens his length just a touch, lands this on middle, Guptill is right behind the line in defence"
"<strong>that is as plumb as they come</strong>, Guptill doesn't even bother reviewing. The umpire raised his finger even before the bowler could complete the appeal. This full delivery angles back in from wide of the crease, pitches outside off and comes back in to beat Guptill's inside edge as he plays down the wrong line."
"squeezes out this low, dipping full toss to square third man"
full toss which he bunts to mid-on for a quick single
"length ball on middle and leg, turned towards square leg"
"drifts in a full delivery on middle, eased to long-on"
"skiddy delivery on middle and leg, Munro blocks"
"sharp, skiddy delivery that pitches outside leg and spins in further to cut him into two halves. <strong>Beaten as he had no clue</strong>"
"hint of width and Munro carves this over cover. He was waiting for this and when this arrived at the correct length to swing, he did so with all his might."
belts this full delivery straight to mid-off
thick inside edge to short fine leg as he looks to squeeze this behind point
"mistimes this low, incoming full toss from around the stumps to mid-on"

"slower length ball gone wrong, Munro slaps this into the gap between cover and mid-off. Held his shape and then threw his hands through the line of the ball to put that away"
"slices this full delivery over short third man. Looked to go over point, ended up getting a thick edge. <strong>Too much width</strong>"
"works this full delivery angling in towards deep midwicket, called for two and managed to complete it without much stress"
"drills this full delivery into the gap at extra cover. Brathwaite with the chase, but don't think he managed to pull it back. The elbow was in contact with the rope as he dived full stretch to prevent it from going over. Given four upon confirmation of the replays. <strong>Full marks for the effort though</strong>"
shapes to cut but is beaten by the fizz. Cramped for room
"looks to force this through cover, thick inside edge to square leg"
"sweeps, but may have been <strong>saved by a bottom edge</strong> as he's hit on the back leg. This drifted in from outside the crease."
looks to turn this behind square but the ball drifts in to hit the pad and deflect to the off side. <strong>Would've missed leg</strong>
"<b> dropped! </b> This busts through Carlos Brathwaite's hands at mid-off. This was full, Munro backed away and hit this really hard. Despite getting hands on it, the ball still had enough to parry towards the boundary"
mistimes an attempted cut to cover.
right on top of the bounce as he steers this short of length delivery to square third man
"strong bottom hands as he pulls this in front of square, on the bounce to deep midwicket"
"no timing whatsoever as he shapes to pull. got it on the top part of the bat, just bounced away from Brathwaite. Surprised he didn't go for the catch, perhaps held back as he heard the no-ball call, so that at least he could save the boundary. <b> Free hit coming up </b>"
"beaten by the slower ball, has a big swipe at this off-cutter, but played too early. Clever variation in pace"
"slower and fuller on middle and leg, turned into the gap in the leg side, deep midwicket and square leg converge, as does the bowler."
"backs away to slap this but the bowler cleverly bangs in a short ball on middle to cramp him for room, Phillips sways out of the way in the end"
mistimes a forceful hit to a length ball back to the bowler
"looks to clear the boundary but gets this on the top part of the bat, on the bounce to the fielder."
whips this length ball to deep midwicket
"slower length ball outside off, he looks to back away and go over cover but is defeated by the slowness of the wicket, gets a thick inside edge past the bowler on the leg side. Bowled at 109kph"
squeezes this full delivery down to long-on where Rovman Powell hares in to stop that
"belts this down the ground, on the bounce to wide long-on"
"thick inside edge onto the pad, the ball rolls to the off side. Looked for a cross-batted swat to this"

"shortens his length just a touch as he fires this into middle and leg, tucked with the angle to short fine leg"
works this shortish length ball down to deep midwicket
"this has been walloped way back into the stands at deep midwicket. Fetched this slog sweep from way outside off and boy, did he pick the bones out of it or what. He was hitting into the wind too, so much power."
"squeezes this full and flat delivery on the pads to wide long-on. <b> That's the 50-run stand between Munro, Phillips </b>"
belts this slower length ball straight to deep point
"flat-batted swat across the line to long-on, not much power on this though"
"slower and fuller delivery angling into middle and leg from wide of the crease, punched to long-on"
new bat and he's managed to wallop this whip to deep square leg. Swivelled back and simply worked this off his wrists into the gap. This was too short and he got on top of the bounce nicely
"fetches this pull from way outside off, manages to hit this deep into the stands at deep midwicket. Friendly length ball angling away at 125 clicks, and he manages to get enough power on that. Dropped in the stands"
"strong bottom-handed whip and boy, he's cleared wide long-on with ease. He sprayed this too full, Munro manufactured the length by staying deep inside the crease as he swung through"
works this low full toss down to long-on
"swung behind square, on the bounce to deep backward square leg. <b> 4th T20I fifty </b>"

"right into the blockhole, squeezed away. Good delivery"
"swung away towards deep midwicket, not much timing but there's a misfield from the man running in which allows them to complete the second. <strong>Sloppy work</strong>"
makes room and drills this full delivery to wide long-off
"squeezes this full ball back to the bowler, hit really hard but Carlos is a big man"
"excellent stop at short fine leg, saved three runs. This was whipped behind square with the angle"
in his hitting arc and he's belted this past wide long-on. Lazy effort in the deep
"he's shoveled this over the non-striker's head, down to long-on where Carlos throws himself full stretch at long-on to save a certain boundary"
"was he struck outside the line of off stump? This was a big, big appeal from the bowler as Phillips looked to walk across and ramp. He was hit on the full, so the line is taken out of the equation."
"this is an outstanding catch at long-on. Flat hit, so much power on that but he got down low to pull off a stunner as it was descending on him. Munro looked to clear long-on but got a little too close to the pitch of this full and flat delivery."
wallops this full toss down to long-on
"cramped for room as he looks to work this length ball to the leg side, rolls back to the bowler"
"right into the blockhole, squeezed to long-on"
too full and he's hammered that slower delivery over extra cover. Flat hit to the ropes. Held his shape and swung through at an appropriate time.
"slips this down leg, muscled down to deep backward square leg where Taylor comes around to cut that off"
chips this into the air but lands short of the man coming in from long-on
works this full delivery on middle and leg towards deep backward square leg
"this is simply sensational. So Guptill-like. Full and angling in, he simply went through with the stroke, lofted it cleanly. Tremendous bat speed and power coming through from the bottom-hand as he deposited this deep into the stands at midwicket"
drills this full delivery to long-off
"swept against the turn, he's bisected deep square and deep midwicket to bring up his half-century, or so he thinks. Was scratchy to begin with but has picked up pace along the way or what"
"now he gets there as he works this flatter delivery towards the man coming in from deep square, this is a wayward throw from Nurse to the keeper, could've been close"
"rocks back and belts this short delivery into the gap at deep point. For a long time, it looked like deep cover would be able to hare across to stop that but it kept going away from him"
"full, straight and he's beaten his across-the-line slog sweep. That's the end of that. The middle stump takes a walk. Typical Badree wicket."
steps out and eases this down to long-on to get off the mark
"steps out to play across the line, is beaten by the drift as this hits the pad"
"slower and fuller outside off, worked to long-on"
"this is a full toss angling in from wide of the crease, Bruce is through with the swing but this hits him just above the flap on his left pad. The leg stump was visible at the point of contact so the line was never in doubt. The ball was descending on him so height wasn't in question either. Once there was no inside edge on that, he was a dead duck anyway."
bunts this full delivery into the gap at cover to get off the mark
turns this full delivery from outside off towards long-on
"slower and fuller outside off, belts this to mid-off as they scamper a single"
"fetches this pull from outside off, does well to keep this all along the ground though"
"swept past short fine. Have to say that was lazy from Badree. This was in the air for a bit but drifting away, he tried to go for the catch but stopped and then saw this ball bounce away from him."
turns this full delivery towards the man coming in from deep midwicket
thick bottom edge that beats short third man. Frustrating for West Indies
"pushed through quicker on middle and leg at length, turned to midwicket"
"touch short, he makes room and steers this wide of Gayle, who does well at short third man by using his boot."
steps out and drags this from way outside off towards long-on
chops this length delivery off an inside edge to the leg side. Looked to make room and slap this through point
"shapes to cut but is cramped for room, chopped wide of the keeper on the off side this time"
"looks to swing this length ball over midwicket but toe-ends the slog, back for the second even as deep midwicket and long-on come in to stop that"
"bat face turns as he looks to belt this incoming length delivery, down to long-on"
"drilled over the bowler's head, smashes this into the sightscreen. Stayed inside the crease, got underneath the length and used his raw hitting power to muscle this over. Terrific"
"slips in a yorker-length delivery on middle and leg, this is squeezed into the leg side as they hare back for the second"
the slower delivery has done the trick. He was backing away to swing but this dipping full toss came back in to cramp him for room and deflect off the pad onto the stumps. Kitchen was through with the swing way too early.
"slower and fuller on middle and leg, turned towards square leg, the man in the deep had some work to do by which time they were back for the second"
looks to steer this length ball behind square but is beaten
"stands tall and punches this to cover, they look for a single but can't get it this time"
flat-batted slap down to long-on that he fetched from way outside off
"slower and fuller on off, driven to long-off, sensible from Taylor to hog strike by taking a single off the last ball"
"yorker-length outside off, Taylor walks across to squeeze this behind point but is beaten"
"this is a full toss and he walks across and mows this straight to deep midwicket. Cramped for room, didn't get the timing either. Easy catch."
"carved away over point. Predictable the length, made room, waited for it and then hit it up and over."
slaps this back of length delivery to deep point
"has he taken that? Wow, tremendous reflexes. Freak catch. Just how did a 6 feet eight inch man get down so low on his followthrough to take that? Magical. It was hit hard too, so he had to react qucikly and he did so very well."
clever. Walks across and works this full toss on middle past short fine leg. Would've crashed into leg stump had he missed that
"right in his hitting arc, belted straight towards the sightscreen. Too full, he opened up the off side and got under that before muscling it away. Baseball-like hit."
"full toss and he's walloped this to deep midwicket. What's worse? He's overstepped, so this will be a free hit. Opened up the leg side by moving outside off as he swung this away."
"not much timing on that, down to long-on, but he's overstepped again and by a long, long way. <B> Another free-hit </b>"
steps out and swings this length ball from outside off towards the man coming in from deep midwicket
"skiddy bouncer outside off, the batsman walks across to swing but lets it go in anticipation of it being called wide, not called and rightly so"
"steps out to pull but this is banged in short, gets him on him, Southee is three or four paces down the pitch as he top-edges this over short fine. <b> Another free-hit, this time for height </b>"
"full and wide outside off, he looks to carve this behind point but is beaten, they scamper a single"
"swings this against the line, hitting it against the breeze, on the bounce to deep midwicket"
"belts this on the bounce to wide long-on, so a last over which began yesterday has final come to an end. <B> 25 off the final over </b>"
"just short of a length, some slight shape away, left alone"
"incoming fuller ball on the pads, flicked to short fine leg"
"slight movement into him from a fuller length, driven along the ground to mid-off where captain Southee gets down to his right to stop it"
"full and straight on leg stump, defended back"
"full and angled across on his middle stump, Gayle pushes it along the ground straight down for an easy single"
"full and angling in on leg stump, too easy for Walton who clips off the pads through backward of square leg"
shot. That's a loosener from Southee. A short delivery git-wrapped with a lot of width. Gayle slams it through the covers
now he makes some room for himself by backing away. It's slightly short of a length and he punches with a straighter bat this time. To covers
"short of good length outside off,jags away off the seam, sticks the bat out and gets beaten"
"short of a length on off, punched off the backfoot to the covers"
"back of a length, comes in on middle and leg and Walton presents the full face of his bat as he punches down towards mid-on"
"gets the front leg out and tries to squeeze out a fuller delivery, jams the bat into the ground as the ball beats the bat outside off"
"full and on the pads, clipped uppishly behind square and the fielder in the deep gets around it to make a diving save"
"back of a length on leg stump, 136.2 kmph, tucked off the pads behind square leg"
slashes at the sight of some width and skews it off he splice over backward of point
"oh, catch! What a stunning catch! Glenn Phillips with a stunner behind the stumps. Gayle shapes up for a pull off this short delivery. Has to fetch it from outside off and skews it in the air off the top edge. Phillips sprints back and has to make a dive at the last minute as he realises he isn't under it entirely yet. Those are so difficult to judge but he has made a superb late adjustment. Top stuff"
and that's another one. Two in two for the debutant. Lures Walton into a drive with a full and wide delivery. Shapes away slightly as well and Walton has thrown his hands at it. Can't control his drive. Hits it in the air and Kitchen moves to his right to take a smart catch. The two debutants team up to send back the other opener
a harmless straight length ball that is left alone outside off
"full on off stump, pushed out towards extra cover"
"length ball that straightens slightly, stabbed into the off side off the outside of the bat"
"full and wide, stretches into the shot and flays it through the covers"
"full outside off, leans into a driven into the covers"
"short ball around off, can't get on top of the bounce entirely as he pulls along the ground to midwicket"
"short ball on off, gets on top of it and nudges it into the leg side"
"length ball on middle and leg, nudged behind square on the leg side"
sticks the bat out to a slightly back of a length delivery and knocks it down the pitch off the inside of the bat
"<b>slower full ball, almost chips a return catch</b>. Leans into the shot early and the bowler dives to his left but the ball gets past him. They run lazily for the single and the throw at the striker's end takes out the stumps. But he is well inside"
"short of a length, flays it with a flat bat and drags it down the ground for a boundary. Straight as an arrow"
"walks forward early, telegraphs his intent and the bowler drags the length back just a tad. Angles into his middle stump and the ball goes off the pad to square leg"
"good length, cuts in towards his off-stump and he runs it down to third man off an open face of the bat"
"full on middle and leg, pushed to the right of the bowler"
"comes forward slightly early to this length ball, very slow through the air, and defends"
advances down the ground and again there is no pace. But Fletcher is able to get right underneath it and hammer a drive through the extra cover region
"full on middle and off, driven out to the off side"
floats it up slightly around off and Fletcher pushes it into the covers for a single
"slider on leg stump, gets down for a sweep and gets it away through backward of square leg"
"shortish and some width outside off, not hsort enough and he chops a cut towards pint. Direct throw at the bowler's end, and hang on, is that gone? Th TV umpire almost gives his decision and the next delivery is about to be bowled when he decides to have another look. The bat is in the air but inside and with the new rules that's not out"
""
"floats up a wide one outside off, chases it but it's too wide and he can't make contact"
"fuller, driven into the off side"
shapes for a cut to a shortish one but it comes on with the arm towards his off-stump. Doesn't turn much but he manages decent connection on the cut and gets it through backward point
"throws hard hands at one that's looped up too much. It's a full toss and he completely misses it. Jeez, how did he miss out on that one?"
"flat, short and some turn. Tries to pull but can't middle it as it keeps a tad low"
backs away a mile and tries to force a shot as he slashes. Can't find the gap at cover
"flat and some turn away, again doesn't get up as much and he chops a cut to the deep"
comes forward to a fuller ball and guides it with an open face through the point region
shapes up for a big heave and doesn't retain shape at all. Played well away from the body and he hammers it along the ground to long-off
"length ball, comes on with the arm at middle and leg, tucks it to the leg side"
"a tad short and some turn outside off, cuts it through cover and point"
"a back of a length delivery that comes on with the arm around off, backs away and punches back towards the bowler"
comes down the track but the bowler has looped it away from him. Can't find the middle so he clears the in-field but gets it on the bounce to sweeper cover
"arm ball, drifts in towards off, chops it into the surface as he opens the face"
"back of a length, minimal turn outside off, again can't find the room to free his arms for a cut"
"comes in from a short of good length around off, punches it through the covers with a straight bat"
"full toss around middle and off, comes down the track and hammers a drive straight down. Comfortably beats long-off running to his right. Brute force"
tries to repeat the act and telegraphs a charge down the track. Sodhi drags the length back and gets subtle turn and bounce. Fletcher can't put bat to ball and gets stumped
"fuller outside off, driven to the covers"
"pitched up on middle and off, gets the front foot out and clips to midwicket"
"length ball, some turn outside off, stretches out and knocks it towards point for a single"
"back of a length, some turn outside off, hits it against the turn between midwicket and mid-on"
punches this down to mid-on for a quick single
opens the bat face to steer this full delivery down to third man
"he's played this straight to backward point. Touch fuller outside off, he opened the bat face and just sliced it like the fielding coach would while giving catching practice at training. West Indies slide further"
"full and angling in from wide of the crease, eased to long-on"
"he's pulled this from outside off and straight into the hands of midwicket. They're comitting hara-kiri, not for the first time on tour. This was a slower delivery, he was through with the stroke and simply got this off the toe-end. Hope's brief but painful stay is over."
works this full delivery wide of midwicket to get off the mark
"tossed up outside off, eased wide of cover for an easy single"
"drifts in a full ball on the stumps, eased to long-on"
"touch short on middle and leg, punched to deep midwicket"
too short and is lucky to get away with this as he punches this to deep point
works this off his hip to deep square leg
"thick outside edge that rolls to short third man, superb over."
mistimes a lofted hit to cover. This was fired full and flat outside off
"swept with the angle, just lands short of the man coming in from deep backward square leg. Looks like Munro may have lost it in the sun, <strong>started a split-second late</strong>"
"fired in from around the stumps, defended back to the bowler"
"thick inside edge that sneaks between the legs of the keeper as he shapes to drive, short third man runs back to pull it back in"
works this full delivery on middle and leg to deep midwicket
"right into the blockhole, squeezed off a thick inside edge to the leg side"
gets down for a reverse sweep. Wrong line. It's outside off to start off and also not full enough. No contact
that's just all power. Not the greatest bits of timing. Right off the toe end as he didn't make an effort to get behind the line. Front leg out of the way and over long-off
now he picks long-on. Closer within his swinging arc and Brathwaite gets on top of it before making slightly better connection
short ball. Tries to swivel around and force a pull but the ball doesn't quite get up and he loses shape as he inside-edges to the pad
works a length ball off the hips to the square leg region
finishes the over with a fuller delivery outside the off-stump and Powell crunches it to the covers
"short of good length, not short enough. Goes through with a pull and almost picks out midwicket. Just over his head"
straight into the hands of long-on. That's the easiest bit of catching practice you could possibly give. He probably just formed the reverse cup and just closed his eyes as the ball sat nicely into his hands. Walks across and swipes horribly across the line. Comes straight down the throat of Bruce who doesn't move any part of his body apart from his hands
"length ball on off, plants the front foot forward and taps it to midwicket for a quick single. They take on the fielder and he fumbles as he fails to pick it up"
they're getting a wicket almost every other delivery now. Again zero effort to get behind the line of the delivery. Stays way outside the line and just hangs the bat loosely looking for a run down to third man. Gets an outside edge that's taken brilliantly by Phillips diving to his right
"short ball, jumps to get on top of it and keeps it down as he taps it down to third man"
<b>in the air and just past deep backward square leg</b>. Almost instinctively pulls this short delivery and gets a top-edge. Rance sprints to his left and sticks the left hand out as he stretches to try and take it. Just gets past him and over the ropes
""
comes forward and closes the face of his bat. Gets a leading edge that goes towards sweeper cover and they take on the fielder for a very quick second
"length ball, turns quite sharply around the off-stump channel. Gets slightly opened up as he defends"
another wicket gifted to New Zealand. Blindly comes down the track without sussing out the length. And there seems to be a distinctly strange intent as well as he looks for a gentle push after making all the effort to come down the track. The ball spins past the outside edge and Phillips does the rest. What a game he's having. Half-century and now two catches and two stumpings
"short of a length, stays in the crease and punches back"
"what an effort! Jeez, that's a stunning save. Hang on! Could it just have been a six? Taylor lofts this fuller delivery. Bracewell at long-off defies gravity as he runs to his right and leaps full-length over. Catches the ball and then just about releases it as the backfoot lands flush on the boundary ropes. Question is if he has managed to release it before making contact with the ropes. it's all a matter of a split-second really. The third umpire decides it's a six. Really, really close, though"
gets an inside edge on this blind swipe across the line and the ball trickles away to midwicket
"short of a length on off, punched into the covers"
"dipping fuller ball on off, driven to sweeper cover"
"<b>in the air and Southee is all confused. Doesn't get to it</b>. A loft over mid-off off the toe end of the bat. Three fielders try to come around it. Southee is running back, does circles as he gets near the ball and ends up nowhere close to it. Completely loses it"
"pitched up outside off, driven straight down the ground for a neat boundary"
"fuller on middle, swipes hard and gets it away to deep midwicket off the inside of the bat"
over the top of the keeper and away to the boundary. A top-edge on a hook that gets well past Phillips and trickles away
"back of a length, angled in at his body as he backs away. Gets hit on the inner part of the back thigh as the ball runs away into the off side"
"slower full ball. Really no pace as it comes on at 102.2kmph. Lofts it over long-off and the fielder runs back but the ball gets past him, drops well short and runs away to the boundary"
throws hard hands at a short ball and flays a pull to deep midwicket
a repeat of the previous boundary. Again skews it in the air and behind the stumps off the top-edge. Unable to deal with the bounce but getting the runs somehow
"and finally he is caught. Southee persists with the short stuff. Just that instead of rushing the batsman for pace, he drags it back with a legcutter. Gets Taylor to drag a pull high in the air. Completely messes up his timing and he can only get it as far as the midwicket fielder"
"full on the pads, clipped to square leg"
"backs away to a short ball that follows him and pulls it to square leg. Santner sprints to his right, gets down, tidies up and fires a good long throw to the keeper"
"short ball, deemed too high as it gets well over the batsman"
"fullish on off, drilled into the midwicket area off the inside of the bat"
"shot. Is that the shot of the innings? It's a pity it's coming this late. Really full outside off, carves it away late, just opens the face enough to beat point diving to his left"
advances down the track and drills a fuller ball to long-on
full and straight and rapped on the pad. Badree reviews straightaway. Could have been an inside edge. Otherwise looked dead straight. It's a slower cutter. Pitches really full and sneaks from underneath the bat which hits the pitch and hits him dead in front of middle. Ball-tracking says hitting leg-stump
