Bat got stuck in behind the pad, and the height is perfect as well. This should reflect three reds. In fact, it stays umpire's call on wickets, as it just grazes the top of leg stump. But Bangladesh will take that. Big wicket, considering his Chattogram heroics. Jayed has just reward"

For what it's worth, Sarkar started to walk as soon as WI reviewed. He knew he had nicked, but it's also his right to stay put if the on-field umpire hasn't given him out. Fair play from all parties.
