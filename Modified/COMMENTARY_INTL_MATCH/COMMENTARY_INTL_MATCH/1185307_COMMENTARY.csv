"<B>pounded on the helmet by a rapid bouncer!</B> That is an absolute sconing, just to the right of the badge. Crawley was lining up the pull but that reached him at 93mph, and clanged out to point as the shot came through. Concussion protocol kicks in, and we'll have a bit of a break in play"

a bottom-handed pump up and over short cover
left alone with a flourish outside off
"cracked with intent back past the bowler, all the way to a deep-set mid-off"
seizes the width once more with a cross-batted slap to the point sweeper. The fact there's a sweeper at all is an indication of South Africa's lack of control
"a hint of movement on a tight line, and <B>beaten outside off!</B> There's still life in this deck for the best deliveries, such as that"
"<strong>chops on trying to leave it! </strong>89mph/144kph to start after drinks, Pope dangles his bat and inside edges onto the stumps! Length outside off, didn't know whether to play and as he shouldered arms got a little bit of bat on it, enough to play on. Big SA breakthrough!"

"edged, <strong>gone this time</strong>! <strong>Superb stuff from Nortje</strong>, into the seventh over of his spell and still hitting the 90mph mark. Lures him into a drive, hint of movement back in without much foot movement, decent edge on it and QdK takes a simple enough chance! Root is fuming"
"slashes at a wide one pushed across him first up and feathers behind! <strong>90mph/145kph</strong> again, fullish outside off from over the wicket, Curran <strong>throws his arms at it and gets a thin edge through to de Kock</strong>!

clipped on the up to backward square leg
"back of a length, and spanked with intent into the covers"
"<B>hacked off a good length, and high to Elgar in the covers!</B> Oh my, that's a terrible way to give it away.

"good response, open-faced steer to third man"
"bending back on a full length, and pressed back to the bowler"
"outside off, climbing off the seam, drawing a hard-handed stab, and <B>du Plessis at second slip pounces!</B> That is a richly deserved <B>five-wicket haul for Anrich Nortje!</B> He has been exceptional today, and all series for that matter. A good take from du Plessis, similar to the one he spilled off Root earlier, waist-high to his right, and travelling fast off a burly fast-bowler's edge!"
poked out to point

"a hoick out to the leg side, retreating to the square leg umpire as he goes, that's the way to do it"
"<B>clears the front dog, and smokes a kipper over extra cover!</B> That's proper tail-end biffage, just pummelling the bat through the line and letting all those bench-presses do the rest"
"winding up for the big one, but can't connect there"
"fast and flashy, lifting outside off as Broad aims a wild waft at a ball that has already long gone"
"round the wicket, angled into the left-hander, and <B>Broad smokes a back-foot drive a la Garry Sobers!</B> No really, Geoffrey Boycott once compared their techniques, and who am I to argue? Or Nortje for that matter"
"on the back foot, pushed into the crease, and blocked down at the feet"
patted back to the bowler
hauled to mid-on with a roundhouse pull
"another massive wind-up, weight toppling backwards, and an under-edge almost nutmegs the keeper"
"<B>dumped with disdain high over long-off!</B> Oh my word, this Broad innings is exceeding my wildest dreams. Utterly feckless one shot, utterly imperious the next! Are you entertained? How could you not be!"
"fires in the short ball, can't connect with that one"

"pounded with belligerence, out to the leg side, off a bit of a top edge, but plugs in front of the in-galloping sweeper"
"<strong>another bounce, another 'not the face!' mow!</strong> No equivocation in this stroke, self-defence meets the sort of message that Jos Buttler has engraved on his bat handle, as <strong>another massive six whistles over square leg!</strong>"
edged down through third man as England's rinky-dink circus keeps the music playing!
"<B>that's just majestic!</B> A good eye, and a licence to trust it ... <strong>equals a disdainful dump back over the bowler's head!</strong>"
<B>honked into the stands at square leg!</B> You can't bowl there to Mark Wood! You can't bowl <I>anywhere</I> to Mark Wood!
"beaten outside off, extra bounce on that one"
"over the wicket, another murderous mow across the line, but just an air shot this time as the ball hops over the stumps"
"short again, and an almost calculated pull to the leg-side sweeper, as if content to rotate the strike and build the partnership... Wood is getting airs!"
"full and straight, slapped with vigour up and over the cordon, and one bounce to third man"
"<B>so close!</B> Yorker-length, but sneaking past off stump by <I>this much</I>. In fact, not even that. <I>Ts mh</i>"
<B>Donk. Six. Next!</B> Paterson rolls his fingers on the cutter. Big mistake. Broad sees it coming and burgles another brutal slap over long-on!
pounded through to the keeper
"bouncer, a wild woolly waft around the shoulder region. No contact, not even close to contact. This is tail-end perfection"
"another big wind-up, under-edged into the legs, trickles behind square and they tot up another run"
"fired down the leg side, can't connect there"
"up on the toes, rides the bounce of an angled delivery, back into the body, and picks off the single through the cordon"
"pushed way across the right-hander, Wood has a slash - of course - but it's too wide for him to get close to"
tucked off the legs for another single. These two have got themselves in now ...
another bottom-handed wallop to long-on

"banged in short, and <B>Wood bails out of a pull shot!</B> Boo..."
"very full, almost slow-motion, tailing towards the stumps and pushed with something resembling caution to mid-off."

"tails in the yorker, well dug out with a late flash of inside-edge onto pad"
"in the slot, and slotted to deep midwicket. Broad with another massive wind-up, trusting his eye, and getting more contact than not. That's more like it!"
"fizzed through to the keeper, no contact that time"
"forward and poked back down the track. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the <B>refreshment break</B>."
"short outside off, Broad clobbers him for six more over midwicket. <strong>Bosssshhhhhhhhh!!!</strong> Sits up nicely off the pitch, chest-height, clubbed"
"slower ball, dragged out to deep square leg on the bounce"
"length, width outside the off stump, cut to deep point"
"slips out the hand, full toss down the leg side, clips Broad's thigh pad as he looks to work it down to long leg and races away for leg byes!"
"length ball, hoiked out to deep midwicket on the bounce"
"length outside the off stump, Wood clears the front dog and hammers it over the covers for six more! Have some of that! <strong>The Ashington Afridi strikes again</strong>"
"back of a length outside off, Broad picks it up early and mows it through midwicket to bring up <strong>England's 400</strong>! Pulled hard in front of deep midwicket, Bavuma couldn't get round"

"on the front foot, <strong>91mph now</strong> for Wood as point gathers"
"<strong>slams the chest-guard at 147kph/92mph!</strong> Malan limbos, keeping his hands low, as the ball thumps the body"
"good rhythm now from Wood, cranking up to 149kph outside off as Malan shoulders arms"
"slashed with hard hands, and <strong>through the gap at gully off a thick edge!</strong> Rare aggression, and almost terminal!"
patted out to the off side
"<B>nip and bounce!</B> That's a quality delivery! So full, savage kick off the seam, and Elgar almost topples backwards in his haste to avoid nicking it"
"leg-sided this time, closes the face on a dab to midwicket"
"through to the keeper, outside off, shaves past the edge, though he was almost not playing at that..."
"drags the length back, <strong>more rip and nip on off stump</strong>, and another extravagant leave from Elgar"
"wicket to wicket, adding the pads, solid block"
"<B>thumps the chest again!</B> More bravery from Malan, putting his body on the line"
"<B>rare width, and out comes the uppercut!</B> A wild, but calculated wipe over the slips. Any bat, and it flies... and it did!"
"attempted leave, and <strong>under-edged into the crease!</strong> Caught in two minds on the tighter line, and nearly chops on!"
"<B>inside-edge, and Buttler can't reach it!</B> Round the wicket, skims the bat, heading down all the way, and the keeper, slightly wrong-footed, is too slow to react. The ball scooted under his glove on the half-volley, and away to the rope!"
short and sharp. Wood is in a mood
nudged to the leg side
"very full, tapped back up the track, past the bowler and gathered at mid-on"
"<B>that's a beautiful delivery!</B> Curling past the outside edge on such a full length. Half an appeal from the cordon, but that's the sound of bat flicking pad. It was all pretty adjacent in that blur of leather and wood"
"outside off, tight lines again, left alone"
stabbed back to the bowler on a full length
"teasing length once more, full and fuller is his remit, and that's jabbed back to the bowler"
good carry once again through to the keeper
"fenced off the legs, past short leg and away for a hustled single"
"over the wicket, outside off, late movement after the ball passes bat. Lively!"
"wider on the crease, speared into off stump, a cagey drive on the up, and gully is in play as the ball straightens on impact... <strong>but just short of Stokes!</strong>"
"<B>edged, gone, that's the money ball!</B> Perfect line, perfect length, and <B>exploding off the seam at 94mph!</B> There was no getting away from that one for the steadfast Malan. A feathered edge through to the keeper, and England have their opening! (Only just mind ... millimetres from being a no-ball...)"
sizlling through to the keeper once again. This is proper fast bowling
<B>beaten outside off!</B> Curling across the left-hander and luring an injudicious stab
"fuller length, into the pads, <B>sweetly picked off through midwicket!</B> Classic Elgar, stray into his areas at your peril"
Stokes ploughs the furrow outside off once more
"round the wicket now, closing the angle into the left-hander, but that's wide enough outside off to leave alone"
"angled bat, <strong>down through third man</strong>. Always safe as Elgar played with soft hands"
"jabbing the gloves into an off-stump lifter, poked to point"
"<B>ripper!</B> Curling in, shaping away, hits the seam and beats the edge at a naggingly insistent pace!"
"a fraction wider, threatening to bend back in, but left alone with three slips lurking"
"very full, into the toes, pumped back up the pitch to mid-on"
"worked to the leg side, walking across the crease to meet a full ball"
"appreciable curl back into the right-hander, Rassie closes the face on impact to defend"
"<B>edged and that's a hell of a take at second slip!</B> Another nipper outside off, climbing into the edge and flying hard and fast off the splice. Stokes watches it all the way, and plucks it in both hands, high to his right, almost pivoting on impact to cushion it. Canny bowling, just probing off stump with an upright seam. Now South Africa are in bother!"
"<strong>eludes the entire cordon</strong>, with a hard-handed poke outside off! Straight into the gap at backward point"
"outside off, wide enough to leave alone"
"round the wicket, curling into the pads, dabbed to the leg side"
"closes the face on an off-stump lifter, stabbed to the on side"
"<B>nip off the seam!</B> Elgar is tempted, and beaten, by one that climbs outside off at 86mph. That's brisk by most standards"
"shoulders arms, keeping a lid on another over"
sliding down the leg side
"curling back into a back-foot block on off stump. Up to 83mph there. He's got decent nip, if not outright <I>wheels</I>"
solid in defence once more
"very full, bending back in to off stump again. This is tidy and probing stuff"
tickled off the pads to get Faf off the mark
"<B>another jaffa to finish!</B> More disconcerting curl through the air, then a wicked kick off the seam to beat the outside edge. Challenging stuff!"
"over the wicket, full and wobbling, as Stokes rolls his fingers on a cutter. Blocked to point"
"sharper pace, up to 85mph that time, defended on the back foot"
"banged in short, flicks the body, and away to the rope... rather harshly, he's robbed of the byes because the umpire deemed he wasn't playing a shot. His ribcage would argue otherwise"
another nudge to fine leg to keep the strike rotating
"<strong>flashed to point, and Elgar has given it away!</strong> Oh my word, you can take issue with his approach now! Short and wide, the sort of ball that has 'sucker' stamped all over it. A limp prod to Woakes, and well, crumbs. South Africa might be batting again tonight at this rate... Elgar looks distraught, he can barely drag himself from the crease."

"nibbling away on a length, defended to cover with a high front elbow and a full face"
"jags back in off the surface, struck on the pad, and given! Height might save him, and he's <b>reviewed</b> the on-field call. Woakes has a fraction of his heel behind the line. It hit above the knee roll - I reckon this is bouncing over the top of leg stump... nope, Hawk-Eye says Umpire's Call! It's clipping the bail, and du Plessis is left to trudge off after yet another failure!"

"length outside off, pushed out to point"
"back of a length, steered out to square leg"

"pushed across the left-hander on a length, bit of a mix-up as they consider haring through for a single and Bavuma scurries back to the non-striker's end"

"<strong>edged, and gone!</strong> Stokes takes a superb low catch at second slip, diving forward. The umpires are going to check it I think... soft signal is out, which tends to be the decisive factor. Back of a length ball from Wood, Bavuma looked to steer it into the off side off the back foot and it drew an edge, and the replays confirm it was a clean catch. <b>South Africa are five down and in all sorts!</b>"

"pushed across him on a length, left alone"
steered out past the diving gully
"back of a length outside off, short and wide really as Philander drives jumping off the back foot, through the covers for four"
"yikes, that's not a particularly clever shot... length ball, speared in towards leg stump, Philander looks to work it through midwicket, he's through the ball early and <strong>skews it straight up to Broad at shortish mid-off</strong>.

"back on the straight and narrow, solid in defence"

"<B>Stokes makes the breakthrough!</B> If in doubt ... throw him the ball. Back of a length, kicking off the splice, an angled defensive blade can't keep the ball down, and Crawley in the gully swoops low to his left to pluck a key scalp!

into line and defended again
"<B>ping, next batsman please!</B> An off-stump exocet, de Kock flashed into a drive, but the ball nipped off the seam at 90mph, and flicked the top of the leg bail! In fact, he's broken the bail... that's his fourth of the innings, and he's got a golden chance for another five-for, his second in three Tests"
"flashed in short, an attempted pull but there's no reaching that one"
"right back on the stumps, defending for all he's worth"
"back and across, dipping towards off, and fenced to mid-on"
"round the wicket, flashed off the  back foot, gathered in Stokes' followthrough"

"Paterson retreats to leg, not entirely comfortable with Wood's wheels, and just about blocked!"
"yikes, the square-leg umpire needs to mind his toes! Retreats to leg again, flashes the blade, and eludes the cordon with a flying edge"
"<B>swing, nick, five for Wood!</B> That was coming, to put it mildly! Another uncomfortable mow from a less-than-happy Paterson. The off stump would have cartwheeled had he missed it, instead a thin outside-edge fizzed into Buttler's gloves!"

steered out to deep point
"<strong>chipped straight to midwicket!</strong> Back of a length on the hip, shovelled into the leg side and Malan, in relatively close, takes the catch. Sibley is furious with himself, and swipes at some thin air that had upset him on his way off. South Africa have another!"

"fullish on off stump, driven back to him"
"length ball, steered out past Bavuma's dive in the gully. Paterson fields it from deep point"
"edged, <strong>gone</strong>! Van der Dussen takes a good catch in the slips and Stokes' fun is over. Tight on the front foot, but the back of his heel is behind the line. Length ball, no real foot movement as Stokes lets out a big booming drive, it finds the outside edge and vdD holds on at first slip. Makes it up the tunnel unscathed today..."

"edged, <strong>and gone</strong>! Pope departs, Nortje has another. And that's Quinton de Kock's <strong>200th dismissal as a Test wicketkeeper</strong>. Nothing shot really, nipped in on a length to cramp him for room as he shaped to cut, feathered an edge through to de Kock"
"struck on the pad first ball, and it balloons up to slip, big shout... but Tucker doesn't like it. Looked a touch high, and there was no inside edge. Bounced sharply on a length at 90mph/145kph, struck him on the back thigh."

"on the back foot, crushed to deep point"
"a flat-footed flog into the covers. Root looks like he wants to get a move on, but is losing his shape in the process"

tipped into the leg side. Better take the singles and let the planet-seeing Curran unleash his levers...
"<B>advancing to the pitch, and crushed through long-off!</B> The kid is making a mockery of his captain's fluency. Just honking it through the line with impunity"
"rapped on the pad, but that pitched outside leg"
sliding past the leg stump
tapped down to third man with an open face
"<B>short, straight, Curran gets underneath a flapped hook</B>, but he gets too far underneath. High, high, and plops into Paterson's hands at fine leg. Another rampant cameo ends!"
"nip from outside leg, raps the thigh pad"

"makes room, retreating to leg, and <B>hacked on the up over the cordon!</B> Too fine through third man to cut that off. Different methods, same result!"

"nicely looped up and straightening on the stumps, defended"
"full and flighted, driven into the covers"
"whipped away, <b>timed through backward square leg!</b> That was a bit more fluent, using Wood's pace to good effect"

"length ball in the channel, 144kph and defended"
"yowch, <b>that's felled him...!</b> Short ball, takes it on the chest, and Rassie is in some discomfort here. Dropped the hands, which was the important part, but might well have cracked a rib for his troubles"
"finishes with a bouncer, but it's veering leg side and RVD gets out of the way"
"<b>bowled 'im</b> - stayed low and ricocheted into the stumps off the toe of the bat! Faf is snuffed out, for what could be the final time in Tests. England tried to wind him up, but he's finally been shot out by one he couldn't do much about. Just flicked the bail on its way up"

"<b>oh Rassie!</b> Round the wicket, van der Dussen attempts to drive... flubbed to short extra cover! There's to be no maiden hundred for Rassie today. He had been so patient, but finally bit at one, Wood pitching the ball up and maybe it skidded on, hit high up the bat and dollied to Broad. Huge celebrations from England, Stokes and Wood applying a Durham one-two combo before tea"

"length ball, driven out to mid-off"

"shortish, fended out to point on the back foot"

"back of a length, wide outside off, fenced out into the covers"

Nortje set off, jogged through, but Hendricks was in his own world, stuttering halfway down the pitch and turning to see everything had gone wrong for him. <strong>Next!</strong>"
"short, and <B>sharp!</B> Exploding past the armpit as Nortje ducks"
"huge appeal, and has that flicked the bat? <B>England think so...</B> Oh yes it did! A strangle down the leg-side, another fierce lifter from Stokes, and up goes the finger after the <B>review</B>. Handshakes all round, as Wood's ninth of the match seals a thumping 191-run win!"
