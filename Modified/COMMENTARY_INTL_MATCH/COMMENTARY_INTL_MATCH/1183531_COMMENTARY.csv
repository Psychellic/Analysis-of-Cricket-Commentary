<strong>advances and lofts over long off!</strong> Is it six? They need to go upstairs ... it lands millimetres short! That was so close! Just landed inside the rope. The crowd groans. What a shot though. Down the track and smashing it inside out over mid off

"on the pads, worked away through square leg"

"good ball, straightens along the fifth-stump channel, and Warner shuffles across and defends into the cover point region"
"floated up full, close to off stump, and Warner pushes it towards mid-on. A bit of yes-no-yes, and Smith hares out of his crease before having to turn around and hare back. Dives into his crease, and Afridi's throw to the bowler's end misses the stumps anyway"
"back of a length on off stump, gets on his toes and defends down by his feet"
"down the track and he can't get close enough to the pitch of the ball angling in towards off stump. Looks to work it leg side, but only manages to get his pad to it"

"tossed up on off stump, clipped down to long-on"
"shot! Labuschagne scored a lot of runs with this shot off Yasir, and now Smith shows he's just as good at it. Flighted ball, a touch too full on off stump, and Smith whips it away between mid-on and midwicket"
"nice flight, a better length on off stump, stretches forward and blocks it back to the bowler"
"short, wide, punched to sweeper cover"
"full, slanting away from off stump. Warner is hurried into a front-foot defensive, and the ball slides into the leg side off the inner half of the bat"
"big shuffle across, and a long, lonely shout for lbw from the bowler. Was looking to work it leg side, and the ball spun past his inside edge and hit his pad. Or was there a bit of bat on it? The ball rolls into the backward square leg region, and there's no leg-byes signal. Pakistan choose not to review"

"flat and quick, straightens towards off stump, stays on the back foot and blocks it back to the bowler"
"good ball, a bit of quick turn from an off-stump line, towards the pads. Worked behind square for one"
"squared up. Lovely ball, flat and quick, but on a good length on middle and leg. Smith plays the trajectory rather than the length and goes back to work it into the leg side. Turns sharply and rolls into the backward point region off the outside edge"
"<b>another no-ball</b>. Length ball on off stump, blocked into the covers"
"length ball, fourth-stump line. Warner is halfway forward to try and push into the point region, ends up getting a thick outside edge that runs away quickly to the left of slip"
"good bouncer, quick and angling in over leg stump. Warner ducks quickly to let it pass over his back"

"short over off stump, gets up to chest height, Smith pulls it through backward square leg to bring up 7000 Test runs. He's now the quickest to the mark, going past Walter Hammond who got there in 131 innings. This is Smith's 126th innings"

"shortish on off stump, climbs to his toes and defends into the point region"

"length ball on off stump, blocked into the covers"
"length ball, fifth-stump line, shuffles across and defends into the point region"

"back of a length, nips in off the seam from outside off, but it's short enough for Warner to watch onto his bat and defend towards point"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"another edge through that region. Half-forward to a length ball outside off - he wants to push into the covers, ends up nicking it thickly instead. Into the gap to the right of gully, and that brings up Warner's 250. Second time he's done that in Test cricket"
"ooh, past the edge. Warner's looked a little scratchy in these last 15 minutes or so, and he pushes at this ball, straightening from a fifth-stump line, with no footwork or conviction. Wonder if he's tiring a little"

"length ball on off stump, gets forward and clips to midwicket"

"fuller, on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"

"back of a length, sixth-stump line, left alone"
"back of a length, a little closer to off stump now, and he gets it to straighten and climb steeply off the surface. Shan has a little feel for it, and he's lucky not to edge it"
"big lbw appeal as the ball goes past the edge of Shan Masood's bat with the batsman defending from the crease. Bat was coming down at an angle, from around gully, and he ended up playing across the line, and the ball beat his outside edge to hit back pad. Probably too high"
"length ball, angling down leg. Beaten for pace looking to flick, he's hit on the pad again"
"length ball on off stump, lets it come to him and defends into the on side"
"another huge lbw appeal, and this one's given. Umpire Illingworth has no hesitation. Fuller on this occasion, and it looked plumb at first glance, but Masood has <b>reviewed it</b>. No stride forward, and again Masood is playing across the line, bat coming down from gully and he's looking to play that towards midwicket. The ball straightens past his outside edge, but, but, but... but there's a tiny Hotspot on the outside edge, so it's juuust scraped his bat. Masood lives on, just about"
"huuuge appeal first up, but Michael Gough isn't interested. Can he be pitching in line from over the wicket to the left-hander? Australia think he can be - they've <b>reviewed this</b>. No edge, Imam's feet stuck in the crease and his bat pushing at the ball a long way in front of his body as it straightens in off the pitch. It's pitched just outside leg stump, though, so he'll survive and Australia will lose a review"
"back of a length on middle stump, defended back towards the bowler"
"full on off stump, defended towards mid-off"
"length ball on off stump, looks to defend down the ground but the ball straightens a little and hits the inside half of his bat, rolls into the square leg region"
"again Imam is playing hesitantly from the crease as a fullish ball straightens into him slightly. Looks to push down the ground, ends up playing it to the right of square leg off the inside half of the bat. Takes the quick single to get off the mark"
"beauty. Cummins has been getting everything to come back gently into the left-hander. This one keeps going with the angle across, and along a tight line that forces Masood to play. Does well to play close to his body and let himself get beaten rather than pushing his hands at it"
"squared up. Back of a length, straightening away from a middle-and-off line. Looks to defend with his bat coming down at an angle, and gets a thick outside edge to backward point"
"back of a length, fifth-stump line, left alone, and Paine collects over his head as the ball springboards off the surface"
"back of a length, wide of off, left alone"
"back of a length, straightening slightly towards off stump, Imam is nicely behind it to defend"
"bouncer, rising to about neck-height as it passes the batsman over off stump. Well played by Imam, sways his upper body away from the line while keeping his eyes locked on the ball"
"excellent leave. Back of a length, close to off stump, and it doesn't miss off stump by much in terms of line, but I guess Imam left it on length, trusting the bounce off this surface"
"shortish, at Masood's hip. Comes at him from his blind spot outside leg stump, and hits him on the thigh pad as he gets on his toes and tries to tuck it into the leg side"
"another excellent leave. Not too far outside off, but Cummins is angling it across him from over the wicket, and so far hasn't shown any signs of extravagant movement against that angle"
"full on off stump, jams his bat down and clips to the left of mid-on"
"full, slanting across into the fifth-stump channel. Dangled it up for the drive but Imam resists the bait"
"shot. Overpitched, on off stump, and he shows the full face to drive to the right of mid-on"
"length ball, angling into the fifth-stump channel, left alone"
"digs this in and gets it to climb sharply towards Imam's neck region. Jumps up and fends at it, and he's lucky the ball doesn't pop in the direction of a fielder off his glove. Drops down by his feet instead. Did well to drop his bottom hand, to give him some credit"
"back of a length, not far outside off, and in fact it soars over the off bail after Imam leaves it. Again, a leave on length. Well played"
"gone, that's such a good ball from Starc. Imam had to play at this. Length ball, angling in towards off stump and straightening just a touch. Squares up in defence, and the thick edge goes to Warner at fourth slip/fine gully, at hip height. He should probably have been on the front foot to that ball, and his bat was well in front of his body when he met that ball, but most batsmen take a little while to get their feet moving at the start of their innings, and this came to him at 150kph"

"length ball angling into off stump, clipped to midwicket"

"full on middle and off, slanting across from left-arm over. Driven to short extra-cover"
"full and wide, inviting the drive away from the body, and Shafiq goes for it, leaning back as he plays the shot, and he's lucky that this thick edge flies <b>between third slip and gully</b>"
"got him, that's loose from Shafiq. This is a good-length ball, slanting away into the fifth-stump channel, and Shafiq had no need to play at that. Especially not if he was playing that in-between shot, neither attacking nor defending, just hung his bat out and exposed his outside edge. Healthy edge through to Tim Paine"

"ooh, that's another well-directed bouncer, rising head high over off stump.

"shortish outside off, rocks back and slaps it to backward point"
"another slightly loose shot from Iftikhar, but he middles this one. Fullish outside off, not quite up there for the drive, but he gets on the front foot and hits on the up, through cover point"
"oh my. Bowls another in the same sort of area, fullish and wide, and he throws his bat at it a touch too early, and the bottom hand takes over, and he ends up hitting it back to the bowler instead of through the covers as intended"

"fullish on off stump, stays back and defends to cover"
"short, wide, slashed, gone. This was coming, and it's happened exactly as Australia have planned. Iftikhar will wonder whether he made it too easy for them. The ball was always angling away, and Iftikhar threw his bat at it without moving his feet, and Paine takes a stunning catch, diving in front of first slip and grabbing it with his outstretched right glove"
"back of a length, close to off stump. Defends with an angled bat, and he inside-edges it into the ground, and then his back pad. Could so easily have rolled back onto his stumps"
"beauty. Length ball angling into a tight fourth-stump line. Rizwan is unsure which way it'll go, and his feet aren't moving yet. Has a poke at it and the ball zips past his outside edge"
"got him, Starc is on fire! And another Pakistan batsman gets out to a poor, poor shot. Full, wide, tempting, but at Test level you're supposed to resist such temptations so early in your innings. Flashes at it, far, far away from his body, and gets a thin edge through to Paine"

"looped up on off, he's back and defending"
"<strong>caught at mid off! Lyon has five!</strong> Shocking shot. Tossed up outside off, he tried to hit this into the river, sliced a thick top edge high to mid off, Hazlewood cruises under it and takes a simple catch"
"round the wicket, pushed off the pads towards short leg"
comes down the pitch and has a huge heave through the leg side which is pretty effective

"<b>it's all over, direct hit finishes things!</B> Was a full delivery, clubbed towards mid-on, Musa wasn't running, Abbas was. He turned, but had little chance of beating Cummins' throw if it hit. And it did"
