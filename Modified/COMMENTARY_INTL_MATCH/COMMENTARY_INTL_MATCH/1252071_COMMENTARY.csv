"<strong>he's cleaned another Sri Lankan up</strong>. Quicker through the air and boy did that skid on!

tried to hoick it through the onside. No timing on this one. It was another carrom ball. Running through his variations there

short-ish delivery carved to backward point
"a bit of air from Hosein, blocked"
went for the heave through the onside once more. Thick underedge on it means it doesn't quite do the damage he intended

"angling across the left-hander, who blocks"

blocked
tonks it over the infield on the onside to deep square leg
"a bit too full, with lots of air. Defended"

"good cricket, this, from West Indies. Nudged into the onside and the two come back for another couple"
driven to short extra cover
"slower ball, which Bravo picks early but approaches to treat with caution anyway"

""
"another single, and West Indies are negotiating Hasaranga expertly"
<strong>Bravo gets his fourth ODI hundred!</strong> This one was down a leg stump line and Bravo gets it fine enough to beat the man at fine leg. Gives his captain a huge bear hug and that's Hasaranga done for the day
"clobbered back down the ground, smacks the stumps at the other end"
"bangs it in short, Pollard can't quite get on top of it, but the thick top edge flies out over the infield, and West Indies get another two"
excellent yorker. Pollard digs it out
"rocks back and hooks it away to fine leg, and it takes a brilliant save from the man in the deep to prevent that going for four. Hard to fault Sri Lanka's effort today"
"Full toss, thumped away, but only for a single"
strays down the leg side on that occasion
"goes over the top, and it goes to long-on on the bounce"
"<strong>he's gone, what a spectacular catch that was!</strong> Lakmal continues to send down full tosses like they're going out of fashion but Bravo can't quite get a hold of it properly. Karunaratne at extra cover puts in a dive, and plucks that ball out of the air. DO SL still have hope?"
good delivery. Has bowled a number of full tosses but his yorkers keep looking menacing when he lands them
clipped to square leg to allow holder to get off the mark
"another yorker but it's dug out very well again. gets quite a bit of bat on it, and the ball flies to cow corner for a single"
this one goes to short midwicket
a single down to fine leg keeps him on strike for the following over
tucked into the onside. West Indies content not to go for the big shot for now
"another low full toss, and this time Pollard urges Holder to rush back for a second. <strong>It looks like he might want to target this over</strong>"
"brilliant bowling. Absolutely clutch yorker that he can't get under, and Holder's back on strike"
"swing and a miss, but it's a little clumsy from the keeper. Once more, Pollard urges Holder to come across for a bye. He really wants to hit a boundary this over, you sense"
"there was a chance with that low full toss, but he can only muscle it to long-off, but oops, that's a <strong>no-ball and free hit!</strong> Huge no-ball, too, at an awful, awful time"
follows it up with a good yorker though
"the extra ball costs Sri Lanka, and Pollard's desire to hit a boundary has come to fruition. <strong>A full toss has finally been punished, clobbered over the long-on boundary all the way for six!</strong> That, you suspect, is game over, and whitewash sealed"
rapped on the pads well down the onside
"edge loops over the keeper and races away for four. The luck going the hosts' way now. It was a clever slower delivery, and rather fooled Holder, but that's little consolation for Sri Lanka"
"<strong>an absolutely monster six over midwicket seals the game and the series. </strong>. That was right in the slot, and it must have been close to a hundred metres. Mickey Arthur has a bit of a sour smile on his face, but he will be bitterly disappointed by how these three games have gone. Hugs in the Windies dressing room, and handshakes on the pitch"
