"back of a length angled across fourth stump, wants to drive this on the up going over the ring at extra cover, but instead it climbs off the splice and Kohli charges forward to take a stellar diving catch before popping up and heaving the ball in the air. 7/10 on difficulty because he didn't have much time to cover the distance but it was coming at a gentle pace and he made it look easy and graceful diving left to clutch this at knee height."

"knee high full toss on off, slapped to wide long-on. Santner starts haring back for the second but for some bizarre reason Seifert is more preoccupied with preserving his average and anchors his bat to the non-striker's end for one with Kohli's relay coming in flat on one bounce to Rahul."
