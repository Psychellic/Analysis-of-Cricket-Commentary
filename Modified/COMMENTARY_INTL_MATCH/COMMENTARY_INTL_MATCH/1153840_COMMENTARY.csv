the famous Malinga yorker - swinging into the batsman and at the toes. Munro digs it out back to the bowler
"another yorker length ball, flicked to mid-on"
"went round the wicket for the last ball, but angled in a bit too much, and he flicks it off his pads to fine leg"
"good length, angling across the left-hander. He defends it solidly from the crease"
"punched on the up and past cover. The timing on that was so good it's gone to the fence. It seemed like they would just get one run, but the combination of a quick outfield and good timing meant the ball just beats the fielder to the fence"
"driven off the front foot again, but straighter that time, and Malinga tumbles to his right at mid-off to stop the ball"
"back of a length and going across, he stays on the back foot that time and slashes it, but straight to point"
"another back of length ball going across, he wanted to slap it through cover, but didn't get hold of it. Ends up under-edging it towards mid-off. They go through for a quick run"
"straight and on a good length, Guptill shuffles across and pats it towards mid-on"
"<b>up and over the infield</b> fuller on off stump, Munro brings out the pick-up shot. Doesn't get the timing quite right, and sends it very high. It hits the signboard on the midwicket fence on the full. Initially given a four, but the umpires check the replay and give it as maximum"
"fuller, strays on the pads, clipped to square leg."

"too full and too straight, Guptill comes forward to clip it to midwicket. Closed his bat face to place it in the gap"
"good work from Kusal Perera on the third man fence. This was another bit of peachy timing from Guptill, who came forward and drove it past point. But some quick running by the fielder meant the ball was picked up inside the fence"
"yorker length, swinging in. Munro goes for the drive, but ends up getting the end of the bat on it. The ball bounces down and goes to slip"
"<b>taken by point</b> Munro too early into the drive. It was the off-cutter, and flies off the leading edge. Sandakan at point dives and takes the ball, but they want to check with the third umpire. Soft signal is out. Munro stayed put initially. Looks like the ball has been caught cleanly, with a finger under the ball, so he'll have to go on his way. Third umpire Richard Illingworth agrees, 'no conclusive evidence to over-turn the soft signal' he says. Cleverly bowled by Malinga, having drawn him into driving, but bowling the off-cutter to take the leading edge. Munro will be disappointed at not building on his start"
"<b>what was that!</b> No-ball and free hit coming up, that just slipped out of Malinga's hands and went past Williamson's head down the leg side. Malinga holds up his hand to apologise."
"great ball for a free hit, but Williamson is going to get runs for it anyway, with an edge between keeper and slip. Bounced after taking the edge, and the keeper got a glove on it, but was unable to stop it, diving to his right"

"strays on the pads again, and Williamson clips it nicely, but straight to midwicket"
"good length, but well outside off, and he lets it go through"
"good bouncer, just in the channel outside off and getting big on Williamson. He thought about cutting it but swayed out of the way"
"<b>edge goes past slip for four</b> good length in the channel, moving away a touch perhaps. Williamson played it with soft hands though, so even though the bowler drew the poke, the ball dropped well short of the slip, and too much to his right for him to stop it"
"good length on the stumps, blocked back"
"back of a length on off, Guptill pushes it towards mid-off."

"good length, straighter. Guptill goes across to try and clip it on the leg side, but doesn't connect well"

"<b>take that</b> he's just dismissed this. Given some room outside off, with the ball too short and he cuts it powerfully past point to send it crashing into the fence. Guptill's racing off, as are New Zealand"

"given some air outside off, driven to cover off the front foot"

"wide outside off, he cuts it but straight to point"
"given some air outside off, Williamson defends it gently. Quick call from Guptill for a single and they run it well"

"gets it more straight and fuller, clipped to mid-on"

"fuller on the stumps, gets nicely behind it to block it back to the bowler"
"strays on the pads again, tucked towards midwicket, but can't go past the fielder"
"oooh, that goes past the outside edge. Pitched on a length and moved away. Guptill was stuck in his crease and ends up feeling for it with his hands."
"tossed up outside off, too full though and Williamson flat bats it past the bowler"
"too short and too wide, Guptill pounces. Stays back and cuts this to the fence with great timing. Waited for it and was perfectly balanced while playing it"
"too full outside off, and driven firmly to wide long-off"
"<b>amazing shot from Williamson</b> quicker ball that was angled into him. He almost mis-read it, but moved back and punched it crisply in time to send it to the cover fence. The feilder had to run across and field it"
"gets some drift and beats the bat, strikes him on the pad. Another appeal, but with that wide of the stumps angle and drift, that is always missing leg"
"full outside off, he gets down to sweep it and picks it up well, to send it to fine leg"
"too straight and moving away, ends up on the pads. Flicked to fine leg"

"good length on the stumps, wristed to mid-on"

Nicholls wanders out of the crease and looks for the strike. Seifert, the debutant, isn't interested in a single, which results in a mix-up. Thisara turns around and nails the stumps at his end to catch Nicholls waaaaaay short"
"nice, inswinging yorker, squeezed back past the bowler"
"<b>caught at long-on</b> another 115 kph ball, Seifert cleared his front leg to swat it, didn't get hold of it and it just went straight to long-on. Not a very successful debut with the bat for him"
"mis-times another slower one over the bowler's head. goes off the toe-end of the bat. Kusal Perera ran around from long-on, and ended up over-running the ball after it had bounced. Saved himself mighty embarrassment by scrambling back and pulling it in before it went for a boundary"
"another slower ball, flicked into the leg side"
"slower ball again. Henry didn't read it, but stays in his crease and dabbed it into the off side"
"back of a length slower ball that time, and he stays in his crease to cut it past point. I'm wondering if these should be classified as slower balls, given that's all Malinga's been bowling."
"swing and a miss. Length ball outside off, at 113.5 kph, he clears his leg to send it to cow corner. Misses entirely. The ball also misses off stump"
"<b>in the slot and bang</b> a rare bad ball by Thisara, perfectly in Neesham's arc. He picks it up from off and sends it flat over cow corner"
"<b>similar ball, same result</b> he's losing his length and line against the left-hander, been so good to the right-handers. In the slot again and Neesham sends it exactly over the same spot at cow corner for another six"
"<b>Neesham's on fire</b> Thisara goes straighter, but still doesn't get the line right. Too full, and Neesham clears his leg to swat it back over the bowler's head and into the sight-screen"
"<b>ho ho ho, who says Christmas is over</b> Thisara is losing the plot. Full toss outside off that time and Neesham clobbers it over cow corner once again."
"<b>full toss and no-ball for being above waist height</b> There's a free hit coming up, and New Zealand have 27 runs off the first four balls! That was outside off, and Neesham swung hard at it, but it went only to mid-off"
"<b>good god, someone give Thisara some brandy or something to recover</b> too full again and Neesham can't put a foot wrong. That's gone on the roof. I miss Tony Greig on air, who would have done justice to a ball going on the roof and a fifth six off five legal balls in the over. Amazing. Incredible"
"no six sixes. managed to not get it quite as that full 'in the arc, out of the park' length. Neesham still smashed it, but didn't get the elevation. sends it flat to midwicket, but the good news is, he's retained the strike"
"fuller on leg stump, he flicks it to fine leg and they run hard to get two and keep Neesham on strike"
"slower ball, on the stumps, he goes back and whips it to deep square leg. Only a single"
"yorker, but he steps away and clobbers it to midwicket off his toes. Places it so well that it's gone to the boundary"
"<b>top edge caught at short fine leg</b> good bouncer, and Henry tries to pull but is too late on it, the top edge swirls to short fine leg where it's comfortably caught. They've crossed though, so Neesham is back on strike"
"fuller on the stumps, and he swings at it hard but doesn't get the height. The ball travels to deep square leg. Hard running gives them two"
"<b>ends it with a flat-batted six over cover</b> What a comeback to the team for James Neesham. He's batted better than he tweets, and that's saying something. Ends with 47 not out off 13 balls. Came down the track and swatted this, to end the innings on a high"

"flatter on leg stump, not much turn, he goes back and across to punch it to long-off"
"<b>got him off the wrong 'un!</b> good loop, pitches on a perfect length outside off, drawing him forward.
