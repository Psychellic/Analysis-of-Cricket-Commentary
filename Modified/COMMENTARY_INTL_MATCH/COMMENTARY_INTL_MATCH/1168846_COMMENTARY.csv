a hint of swing into the right-hander as Amir pitches the ball up on off stump. Kamran defends to cover
"a touch too full this time, but Kamran isn't able to pierce the gap at point"
blocks the good length ball on middle - which is again shaping into Kamran. Good stuff from Amir
"opens the face, trying to pick the gap on the off side, but Amir's inswingers just aren't letting him do that. Tight line on middle. Tiny bit of movement. No room to power it away"
waits on the slightly shortish delivery and dabs it behind point to get off the mark
"<b>lbw appeal</b> against Imam but the umpire shakes his head. Lovely bowling from Amir again, pitching the ball up, finding the left-hander stuck in his crease and playing around his front pad, trying to flick through midwicket. Doesn't connect but survives because it might be going down leg"
"on the pads, and at pace, Kamran ends up deflecting it through midwicket"
"short and outside off, Imam dabs it to deep third man"
"straight drive! Kamran thrusts his weight forward, presents the full face of the bat and sends the half-volley packing with great style"
defends the fuller delivery on middle to cover
too full again and Kamran has crashed this through extra cover. Easy put away. The left-armer's angle offers him room. The length tempts the drive. There's no swing. Only one thing happens after that
"<b>glorious</b>! He stands up tall, lets the back of a length ball come to him, and then thumps it through cover point with virtually a vertical bat. Just opens the face to find the gap and then it's all timing"
"starts poorly with a ball on Imam's hips and the left-hander is very very good there, turning it away to the fine leg boundary"
"mis-hit and he just avoids being caught at mid-on! Imam has been tied down. He's feeling the pressure. He's baited by a slower ball, clearing his front leg and going hard at it. Munro's the fielder, moving to his left, but he has no chance really"
"back of a length on leg stump, deflects it away to the fine leg boundary and Amir screams in frustration. He's been so good this evening but for that ball"
"yorker - and it's perfect - in line with the stumps, at pace too, Imam digs it out, looks for a single too but Ingram at cover doesn't allow that"
"slower ball, on middle, Imam picks it and flicks to deep square leg"
"back of a length on middle, he guides it to point"
"starts poorly with a ball on Imam's hips and the left-hander is very very good there, turning it away to the fine leg boundary"
"he keeps bowling on the pads and he screams in anger at his own mistake, watching another flick from Imam fly past the diving keeper and to the fine leg boundary"
"back of a length on leg stump, this time though Imam finds short fine leg"
wide down leg. He's taken all the pace off it and yet he can't get the direction right
"misfield at short third man. Things keep going bad for Karachi. Imad waits on the short ball a shade outside off, gently taps it on top of the bounce, Amir should have fielded it, diving to his right, but he can't get down in time. Worse, he grabs his knee as if there may be a problem there."
steers the short ball to point
"scary old bouncer, right over middle and leg, and Imam is forced to sway away. Good end to a pretty iffy over"
even the captain's getting walloped! Kamran loads up a sweep shot to a full ball outside and it hurries away to the square leg boundary
"holds his pace back, and that ensures Kamran mistimes the cut shot and gets an isnide edge to fine leg"
"full and outside, he drives down the ground"
hangs back against the shortish delivery and taps it past point
works the flatter delivery to deep square leg
"steps out and launches it down the ground! Imad tries his best to deny the batsman swinging room, spearing the ball fast and flat into the pads, but Kamran makes room as he runs down the track and powers it away"
"leaps outside leg before the left-arm spinner bowls. Umer Khan holds his nerve though, following the batsman with a flatter delivery on leg stump. Imam flicks it to short fine leg"
"fires it down leg, Kamran sweeps, and finds short fine leg. That's unfortunate for Zalmi"
makes room and hammers the short ball on middle to mid-off
sweeps it over the infield and it carries all the way. This plan to cramp him on leg stump isn't working with Kamran getting down leg and lifting the ball away
"shapes to sweep again but with the ball short and wide, he changes tactics and cuts it beautifully between point and third man. Great batting"
"pushes it through on middle, Kamran retains strike with a flick to deep square leg"
steps out and carves the flat ball on middle away to the left of long-off. Kamran doesn't really get all of it - which is ironic because he puts everything into the swing - and because of that he loses his shape and the fielder is interested for a moment. Only for a moment
cuts the shortish delivery to point
"slider coming into the right-hander, and keeping low too, but Kamran is able to slice it to third man"
slips down leg and Kamran flicks it to the left of short fine leg
nudges a full ball on middle stump to the left of midwicket
"fires it in on the pads, Kamran taps it to long-on"
"maaaaasive! And it's that sweep shot again. Karachi's spinners insist on bowling into his pads. He knows it. He's set up for it, clearing the front leg, getting down leg and giving it a full swing of those strong hands."
full and wide outside off and Kamran drills it to the sweeper and gets to his <b>half-century</b>. Karachi stands up for him. His team-mates stand up for him and he looks up at the heavens in gratitude
turns the shortish delivery on leg stump to deep square leg
he's brutal on the off side too. the plan's changed - they want to target the wide line outside off - but Kamran is still able to reach the ball and hammer it to wide long-off
nudges the length ball on middle through to deep square leg
shifts across his stumps - a sign that he's wise to Karachi's tactics - and guides the length ball outside off to short third man
"short and outside off, Imam steers it to third man and it nearly goes through to the boundary. Great timing but good work from Umer Khan down there"
"hammers the short ball on top of the bounce to the point boundary. Beautiful ball-striking, especially because this one was right over middle stump and yet he's able to power it away"
"full on off stump, defends towards short midwicket."
"yorker on off stump, Imad digs it out"
"<b>dropped</b> by a diving Liam Livingstone at short midwicket. Really tough chance though, coming in low to his right. And it's the result of Shinwari pitching the ball up and keeping it in line with the stumps. Stops on the pitch a touch, makes Imad check his drive down the ground and nearly topples him"
"full on off stump, drives to extra cover."
""
clears the front leg and thumps the length ball outside off to mid-off
"beats him for lack of pace. Kamran picks up that the length is short early enough, going for the pull shot, but he's waaaaaaay too early on it"
goes wide of the crease and nails the blockhole outside the line of off stump. Kamran looks to steer it behind point but misses
"slower bouncer but this time Kamran picks it better, delaying his shot, holding his shape and hooking it to deep square leg"
"another slower ball, this one pitched up on off stump, Imad manages to steer it to third man. That's the time out"
steps away and slices the full delivery on off stump through to deep cover
"tries to keep the ball away from Kamran's arc outside off, but goes too far"
outside edge flies away to deep third man. This is practically a seam-up delivery and once Kamran gets a little bat on it...
launches it down the ground! It's a length ball. It's wide outside off. Kamran gets under it and swings free
lands it just inside the wide line as Kamran lets it go outside off
"big old lash over point, but there's protection in the deep"
steps out and drills the full ball on leg stump to long-on
that's outta here! Imad comes down the track and lifts the length ball on middle over midwicket and that brings up <b>Zalmi's highest opening partnership</b>
"full on leg stump, Imad works it between deep midwicket and long-on"
too wide outside off - although he is forced to go there by Kamran moving across his stumps
"outside edge and away it goes to the third man boundary. Karachi are doing the right thing, bowling wide outside the off stump against the big-hitting Kamran. But he's got all the luck tonight"
full toss and Kamran slog sweeps it to smithereens. The ball vanishes somewhere around midwicket and Umer Khan punches his own thigh in anger
"full and outside off, Kamran launches it over extra cover. Clean and brutal hitting so much so that the man on the boundary is only five metres away and he still can't get there"
"full and outside off, steers it to deep cover"
"down the ground! He just won't stop. He just can't stop. This is a short ball, outside off, but Kamran stays leg side of it and flat-bats it to the long-off boundary"
"low full toss on leg stump, Kamran works it to long-on"
"yorker on leg stump, Imam digs it out and finds a single at around midwicket"
short-arm pulls a back of a length delivery on off stump to deep square leg
"full toss over the waist - and at high speed too - with the batsman shimmying down the pitch. Imad is lucky he gets some bat to it, deflecting the ball to midwicket"
<b>free hit becomes a dot ball</b>. Even Kamran in this form isn't able to get a 148 kph leg-stump yorker away for runs
"another yorker at 145 kph, Kamran is able to flick it through midwicket and pinches a second run in the time Babar takes to come off the boundary all the way to the 30-yard circle"
"full toss outside off, Imad drives to long-off"
"taken at extra cover! Karachi have their first wicket and it goes to their opening batsman. Length ball, outside off, the same ones that he's been clattering all around the ground ends up in the fielder's hands simply because of the lack of pace. Karachi finally catch on (pun pretty much intended)"
"huuuuuuuuge! The length ball on middle is smoked down the ground, easy as that."
this is a low full toss and he barely follows through with the shot and yet the ball ends up beyond the boundary. A shovel kind of drive to lift the ball straight down the ground
"taken at long-off. Munro goes wild. He's a good distance away from Pollard, but delivers a proper send off, looking square in the eye of the batsman and punching the air with venom. He gets to do all that because a full ball outside off is mis-hit down the ground"
"back of a length on off stump, he turns it to long-off"
"slow through the air on middle, he goes for the sweep and inside edges to long leg"
steps out but the ball is quicker and flatter and as a result Imad can only dab it through the covers
"full and drifting into the pads, Dawson works it to the left of midwicket, where Babar Azam creates excitement, getting to the ball quickly and aiming a throw at the non-strikers"

gets inside the line and pulls the short ball on leg stump away to long leg to bring up his <b>half-century</b>
looks for the yorker but ends up with a full toss. Dawson slaps it to mid-off

"slower bouncer, which Imad picks up and pulls to deep square leg"
"goes for the wide yorker and it's just inside the tram lines. Better bowling - it seems like it swung into the right-hander, who was letting it go."
"low full toss on middle, shovels it to long-on"
"near-yorker! And he's gone! Amir should've been bowling ages ago but finally he's back and with his first ball, he goes through Dawson, the batsman done all ends up by the ball dipping on him at the last, going under his bat and taking out leg stump"
"slower bouncer on leg stump, Sammy gets inside it and tucks it through midwicket"
inside edge past the stumps and to the long leg boundary. An ugly hoick still works from Zalmi
"he's guided a yorker from outside leg stump all the way onto his stumps! That's ridiculous. But it's just happened. Imad middles the ball, looking for runs to third man, but instead it ends up clattering the wickets"
"good length ball on middle, Maqsood taps it to long-on"
"looks for the yorker, which Sammy pushes down to long-on"
slices the full and wide delivery to deep third man
slower bouncer and Maqsood is more than happy to get out of the way. Eighteenth over of the innings and a batsman lets the ball go
makes up for it big time! A short ball on middle is pulled away beyond the deep square leg boundary.
drills the fuller delivery outside off to long-off
"another slower bouncer, but this time it's a little too far down the leg side"
"back of a length outside off, but with Sammy making room outside leg, he just can't reach out far enough to make a connection"
"near yorker on middle, Sammy helicopters it to deep midwicket. Great bottom hand power"
"full and outside off, Maqsood lets it go thinking he'd get a wide, but no such luck"
"yorker on middle, Maqsood sends it to deep square leg"
"got im! Sammy's plans of staying leg side of the ball - and as deep in his crease as he could - backfires as Amir bowls it slow, keeps it well wide of the right-hander, and the mis-hit loft over cover ends up at point's hands. Clever bowling!"
goes for the wide yorker but strays just a little too far
"back of a length and at the body, Wahab isn't able to get anything on it. Looks for a leg bye but even that isn't possible"

"yorker on middle, Maqsood works it to deep midwicket"

"full toss outside off, he clatters it to long-off"

"yorker on leg stump, flicks to deep square leg"
"full and outside off, he whips it to the right of long-on. Hasan completes one and looks for the second, it's not there, and he's run-out at the non-strikers"

"back of a length on off stump, Babar blocks to cover"
opens the face and guides the short ball outside off to third man
"full and outside off, he goes for the cover drive and misses. Looks like the ball swings in past the inside edge"
"</b>lbw</b>! This is full. And fast. Munro is an age late in getting his bat down and even when he does, it comes across the line. Has no hope of making contact but that front pad takes a beating and if that hadn't been there <s>leg stump definitely would've taken it instead</s> Oh wow! <b>Replays show it would have missed the target</b>! Munro would've been saved had he used DRS!"
"full on off stump, he drives to mid-off"
"turns it to the right of mid-on, deftly, delightfully"
laces it through the covers! Overpitched from the medium-pacer and Babar deals with it like a boss.
"back of a length on middle, Babar blocks"
strays on the pads and Babar sends it packing to the fine leg boundary with a whip of his wrists
"shortish on middle, Babar knocks it down by his feet"
gone! Two wickets in two overs for Zalmi and this is the big one! Babar looks to lift a length ball over mid-off but he mistimes it straight into Wahab's hands. Needs to juggle it though.

short and too far outside off for Ingram's cut to reach
"shortish and outside off, he guides to deep third man"

"<b>gets him lbw</b>! Iftikhar swings all across the line of a perfectly straight delivery - and a fairly harmless one too. Strikes him on the back pad in front of middle. That's plumb, not to mention poor batting. What's worse is that <b>he's gone for a review</b> and replays show three reds"
