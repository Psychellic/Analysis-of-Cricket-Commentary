He jumped unnecessarily and the ball fluttered toward his head coming down but he was crossed up by jumping. If he stayed on his feet, it's a regulation chance. It still was a regulation chance. 5/10 on difficulty and he fluffed it badly."

"<strong>drags on! </strong> Roach and Holder have been stubborn with this around the wicket tactic to the lefties and it pays off here. Fullish length on fifth stump, well away from his body. No need to play at this but is tempted to have a fiddle without any footwork and the inability to get to the pitch of the ball leaves a tremendous gap for the ball to ricochet off an inside edge into the stumps. All things considered it was a fairly innocuous delivery but pays rich dividends to Holder."

Holder pitches this up very full as it seams in to plunk him on the pads full in front of middle stump playing all around this delivery. Huge appeal upheld. Ball-tracking shows this time the extra bounce is not going to take this over the stumps, umpire's call clipping the leg stump bails. DRS denied him a five-wicket haul a few minutes ago but this time DRS confirms his eighth five-wicket haul in Tests."

Flatter one drifting in from around the wicket, Bonner is right back in the crease looking to pull but is struck high on the right thigh as he's early into the stroke. Okay, on looking at the replay another time, maybe, maybe he'll get away. Maybe it's going over. Let's see. Oh, well! Ball tracking says impact comes back as umpire's call, and wicket hitting also comes back as umpire's call. The ball would've just clipped the top of off. Bonner has every reason to believe he's unlucky, walks off shaking his head. All said and done, it was a very casual shot. A big lift for Sri Lanka minutes before lunch"

lovely stuff from Chameera rewarded for peppering that fourth stump channel! He beat Campbell in the previous over with an identical ball pitching on fifth stump angled in that seamed away. This time he gets it tighter to off stump bowling with the around the stumps angle to draw the edge prodding defensively as once again it seams away off the pitch.

beaten by sharp turn as he lunges forward to this one
"<strong>appeal for stumping</strong>, but looks like his back foot was dragged back in. Holder sees the flight and looks to go over the top, but is beaten by sharp turn.

"Massive appeal for lbw as this angles in to hit Holder on the pad. Not given by Gregory Brathwaite and <strong>Sri Lanka review.</strong> This one nipped back in sharply off a length to beat Holder's inside edge. Height seems fairly okay. But ball tracking comes back as umpire's call. Impact was on middle, but this may have just grazed the stumps. And since it was given not out on field, it will stay that way. <B> Not out and Holder survives </b>"

Extremely speculative in many ways and now it looks like there might have even been an inside edge. This one doesn't have much going for it whichever way you look at it. The third umpire doesn't even get to ball-tracking, saying he thinks the evidence isn't conclusive regarding an edge or not and so it stays on field as not out. Dimuth is protesting wanting to know why they didn't progress to ball-tracking if there was no evidence to determine whether the ball hit pad or bat first. I don't think it would've mattered regardless. Most likely umpire's call at best on whether it may have hit the stumps, if it was hitting any part of the stumps."

"<strong>and there it is! The inswing is too sharp and too hot to handle!</strong> Beautiful use of the angle by Vishwa from around the wicket, this time pitching it up very full to encourage a drive from Cornwall but the movement cuts in well past the bat and rips out middle stump.

<strong>finally teases him out poking an edge to third slip!</strong> Roach just kept probing away on the fifth/sixth stump channel. This one was even wider on a good length on about a seventh stump line. No need to play at that whatsoever. Not on a driveable length but Dimuth pushes way away from his body trying to attack after being stifled all over by dot balls and it seams away to produce a thick edge that flies to Campbell at rib height for a straightforward catch. Dimuth is fuming at himself for playing at that ball as he walks off.

A drop at gully, an edge that was given not out down the leg side, and then the ball spinning back into the stumps without dislodging the bails. But his luck runs out. Back of a length ball on fourth stump, in a different stage of the match he would have gone back and across to defend but looking to pad on runs before a possible declaration he tries to run this off an open face to third man but is cramped for room and plays onto his stumps. Career-Test best for Dickwella, but ends agonizingly short of three figures. Roach roars and pumps his fists in delight. West Indies are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel for this innings."
