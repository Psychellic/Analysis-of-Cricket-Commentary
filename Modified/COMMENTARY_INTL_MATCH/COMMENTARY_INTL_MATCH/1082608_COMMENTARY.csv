a hint of swing as Samson steps forward to a full and wide delivery and watches it veer away to the wicketkeeper
"just in case you weren't aware Samson is in form... A perfectly good length delivery, looking for the top of off stump, has been blitzed to the long-on boundary."
"and another. This time the bowler does make a mistake. He gives Samson room outside off and he lashes it behind point. Beats the infield, and third man is just a spectator"
"shortish and a shade outside off, Samson stands up tall and glides it to Kuldeep at deep third man"
"pushes him on the back foot and evidence of the bounce on this pitch is on show as the shortish delivery rises up past Billings' chest. He is off his toes, nudging behind square leg"
"walks at the bowler, who puts in a full delivery, slanting into the right-hander. Samson plays outside the line of the ball and is struck on the pads. Impact is outside off so the appeal is shot down"
"walks right across onto off stump and works it through midwicket. Loves the leg side, Billings."
"shortish on off stump, Samson clips it smartly through to deep midwicket"
"defends a shortish delivery with soft hands, and manages to find a quick single before it reaches point"
"pierces the gap between the two points - and it is a tiny one. Samson walks at the fast bowler, adjusts to the shortish delivery, holds his shape, and just opens the face of the bat to place the ball. That's all he does"
takes on the short ball outside off with a bit more disdain and pulls it to deep midwicket
it's short again and Billings hammers it through to deep square leg
not the best of starts. Half-volley on the pads and Billings never needs an invitation to hit through the leg side. Sweet flick through midwicket
slanted into leg stump again and Samson works it to deep square leg
"that's a top shot. On the up through the covers. This is one of India's premier fast bowlers, hitting a Test-match length. But Samson takes him to the cleaners, just by pressing forward, and extending his defence"
now he knows the correction will come. He waits on the back foot for the short ball and ramps it to the third man boundary. Class batting
"shortish on off stump, cramps him up, and Samson can only run it to point"
reads the slower ball and nails it through extra cover. Times his movement with the front foot perfectly and then just hits through the line. Sublime timing
"shortish delivery on middle and leg, Billings clips it through midwicket"
presses forward to a flighted delivery outside off and nudges it down the ground to long-on
"steps down the track, to the pitch of a ball, I think is going away from him, and flicks it through to deep midwicket"
"shortish delivery, skidding down a straight line to Samson on off stump, he punches it to long-on"
"a hint of turn into the bat, and Billings coming down the track, plays down the wrong line. Gets struck on the pads with the bat on the right"
whacks it away to the left of deep midwicket
"starts with the googly, but it is ends up a low full toss on the pads. Billings puts some jam and munches on it with a flick to the square leg boundary"
comes down the track and works a fuller delivery on leg stump through to wide long-on
"hits against the spin, not picking the googly, and Billings is lucky there is no slip to pouch it. Samson drags him through for a single to short third man"
"that's lovely running. The fielders are all deep on the leg side, so Samson just taps this fuller delivery between midwicket and long-on, softly enough that he can pinch the extra run"
"flatter delivery on off stump, defends and it is done so solidly that it races to mid-off"
"flatter delivery on off stump, blocks"
"lunges forward, and across onto off stump, to flick into the square leg region. He's playing Narine on length, like a medium-pacer"
"this is the one that goes away from the right-hander, Samson reads it off the pitch and blocks"
"jumps back, using the shortish length to his advantage. But his punch finds cover"
sliding into the pads and Samson nudges it to long-on
takes a length ball outside off and drags it to square leg with a sweep. No timing
"races down the track, turning a length ball outside off into a full one outside off, and flicks to square leg"
"huge appeal for a caught behind and umpire CK Nandan makes a late call to give it out. Billings is strangled down the leg side. Definite sound as the ball passes the glove and the high part of the bat. Coulter-Nile is vociferous in his appeal, after his cross-seamed short ball down the leg side fetches a mis-hit. Billings goes for the pull and he's feathered it to Uthappa"
"shortish and outside off, Nair taps it towards cover"
"offcutter, short and outside off, Karun belts it to the right of point, but the fielder puts in a good dive"
"shifts back to a short ball, trying to get on top of it, but it climbs a bit too much. Hits the splice and pops up towards midwicket"
"shortish and outside off, Samson waits on it, lets it pass him, and them plants the ramp for the ball to ping off of. Boundary to third man"
"shortish on off stump, it's closer to the off stump, so Samson ends up finding third man on the boundary"
"leans into the drive, but there is long-off in place now. Five men in the deep after the Powerplay"
"back of a length on off stump, Nair knocks it down to long-on"
"a touch too quick, and no room at all for the batsman. Samson is rooted to the crease as he tries to hit around his front pad. Gets struck on it, but his partner is awake to the possibility of a leg bye"
"width outside off, and Nair carves it to the right of deep third man. Kuldeep does well again"
"has he nicked off. Yes. Umesh does it again, with his skiddy pace. Tempts Samson to poke at a back of a length delivery outside off. No feet, a nothing shot, would have only gotten a single had he timed it. And at worst, he would, as he did, edge it behind. Knight Riders fighting back well"
"good length ball on off stump, blocks"
"shortish on off stump, gets on top of it"
"gets it to veer into the right-hander so sharply that Nair, set up for the cut, is so badly cramped up. Only just manages to bunt it towards cover"
opens the face to utilise the width outside off and gets a single to third man
"picks the length so early - he should have considering Woakes bashed it into the middle of the deck, almost in his own half - and Nair pulls to deep midwicket"
"what a <b>ripper of a ball</b>. Four runs for it is a dreadful result. Woakes troubled a batsman as good as Pujara with the bouncer in Tests. Here he delivers another one, squaring Iyer up, has him leaping, contorting as he brings his bat up, in hope more than anything, to fend the ball away. It hits his right shoulder and goes over the keeper"
runs it down to third man. That's the time out
"there isn't much pace to work with, but there is plenty of width. Cut to the point boundary. The Daredevils batsmen are taking full toll of most of the bad balls today"
"full on leg stump, Iyer whips it through to deep midwicket"
"slower ball, looping up and then dipping down outside leg stump. Nair is disoriented by the dip. Just about nudges it towards midwicket"
"short delivery, pulls it to deep square leg"
"legcutter on off stump, Nair pushes it towards cover and pinches a quick single"
"another slower ball, but this time the batsman is ready. He is also helped by the fact it is wide and overpitched. Iyer steps forward and crunches a drive through extra cover"
"good length offcutter outside off, Nair lashes it to the sweeper"
"offcutter again, it's shorter this time, Iyer waits on it and glides it towards third man"
"another slower ball, outside off, Nair yanks it from there and puts it at long-on"
"iffy sort of shot, as he pokes half a bat out at a cross-seamed short delivery outside off. It bounces a bit more off the pitch and deceives him"
"offcutter, Iyer is forward a touch too soon, and has to adjust his bat swing. Drives towards point"
"offcutter to finish, which Iyer hits to long-on"
"shortish and outside off, backs away and cuts to the sweeper"
well played. Shifts deep into his crease having picked the flatter length very early and then lifts it to deep midwicket with a straight bat
"that seems like a slider, which Iyer flicks to wide long-on"
"he's a good player of the sweep, and he places this just to the left of deep square leg. Backing himself to do so, he hit in the air"
that brings the short ball outside off and Nair is ready for it. Crashes it to the left of the sweeper. Good batting. Good footwork
"shortish and outside off, cuts to the sweeper. Woakes getting a massive workout"
sizes up the short and wide delivery and dabs it to third man on the boundary
"prefers to stay back to a reasonably full delivery, but manages to make decent connection with a glide to point"
"looks to flat-bat a back of a length delivery towards long-on, but it skews away to long-off with Nair playing a touch sooner than he should have"
"now he runs down the track, which Umesh seems to expect. Delivers a 144 kph bouncer, that Nair tries to swat with the bat going vertical over his head. No luck"
"full toss on middle and off, slogs it to long-on. Mistimed shot"
"goes short and wide, Iyer is able to pick the gap behind point. He was moving around in his crease, mostly towards the leg side, but he stops himself just in time, holds his balance, and cracks the cut where it would fetch the most value"
"turns a good length delivery in towards middle and leg, but Nair is backing away and cuts to deep point"
"this is the legcutter or sorts, and Iyer flicks it through towards deep midwicket. They go for a second run, this is going to be seriously tight. Iyer puts in the dive, but the throw beats him. Rocket throw from de Grandhomme, right over the stumps from the boundary."
"flat and spinning away from a length, whips it against the turn from outside off to deep midwicket for one"
"<b>dropped</b>. Nair was backing away, looking to slap this away. Seems like it was the knuckle ball, comes into him. No room, maybe he was expecting the legbreak from Narine. Gets a good, healthy edge and the keeper puts it down. Hit hard into the gloves"
"pitched up on middle and leg, gets down and sweeps to deep backward square leg"
"short of a length, tucked away for a single"
"short of a length, outside off, opens the face of his bat and taps it to point. No run there"
"good length, fired from wide of the crease and angling in on middle, knocks it from the front of the pads between midwicket and mid-on"
"full, angling in, looks for a big slog over cow corner and gets an inside edge towards midwicket"
"full, on the stumps, backs away and drills it off the inside part of the bat to the bowler"
"shortish, angling in, tries to pull, gets cramped for room and fails to put bat to ball"
bowled off a full toss. It was dipping on him and Nair is swinging across the line. Gets the front leg out of the way but does not put bat to ball which crashes into stumps
"gets down to sweep and does not account for the sharp turn into him, doesn't make contact with the ball"
"fuller, clipped off the pads through midwicket for one. Calls for two but decides against it, and rightfully so"
"loopy, flighted ball on leg stump, clipped away to midwicket"
"gets it bang off the middle of the bat. Made sweet connection on that. Floated up outside off, enough width on offer and Pant carts it with the turn clean and high over long-off"
opens the face of his bat to guide this one to third man but there is a fielder inside the circle and he cannot beat him
"wrong'un from Kuldeep, sussed out by the batsman who stays in the crease and fends it off into the off side"
"lovely channel. Good length, angling away and gets it to tail away late and beats the forward push of the batsman"
"that has just been jabbed away, off the middle of the bat and powerfully struck. Picks the length early and gets on top of it, picks it up from outside off and thumps it over mid-on"
"and this time it is short and wide, too easy for Pant who flays it uppishly over the backward point region"
"what a shot that is! That has just been punched off the pads. Powerful wrists from Pant. On leg stump this time and fuller, just picks it up and flicks it away over backward square leg. Lot of bottom hand there"
"this is some carnage. Umesh has got his lengths all wrong here. Full, outside off, giving him all the room he needs to lift it from outside off and clean over long-on. Again, powerful bottom hand"
"too full, too wide, carved out through covers powerfully. Gets the front leg out of the way to give himself room. It was fired in at 140 kph and that helps him beat the cover fielder diving to his right"
"good length ball on off stump, turning away, Mathews can only block"
"blindly comes down the pitch for a big slog, and even if he is playing with the turn, he plays over the ball and is bowled"
"good length ball, spinning away from the new batsman Morris. He slaps it to cover"
"third man and backward point were up, so he takes a chance with the reverse sweep. Picks the right ball for it, it's length, allowing him to get under the ball and lift it over the infield"
"tries to flick a fuller delivery on leg stump, but it spins past the bat"
"<b>almost has him</b>. This is a flatter ,quicker delivery outside off and Morris is set up for the cut, not realising it would be turning into him. Just about chops it towards short third man"
"shortish on leg stump, Pant pulls to deep square leg"
"that's harsh on the bowler. Pant is moving across to try and hit the bouncer, from around the wicket, and into his ribs over fine leg and misses. The ump says that's wide"
"off the bottom of the bat, hence the lack of power. Coulter-Nile does well to bowl full and way outside off. Pant is on leg stump and he can't reach that far to get the timing working properly. Only slices the low full toss to Gambhir at point"
"back of a length on off stump, blocks to point and gets Morris on strike because..."
"<b>dropped</b> by the long-on fielder running in. Umesh, because of his momentum, gets into a dive and it hits his wrist instead of the palms and pops out. Coulter-NIle should have had a fourth after surprising Morris with a bouncer. Bad pull shot."
works it away through square leg
"<b>dropped</b> by the cover fielder and its Gambhir, the captain. Couldn't have been an easier catch, really. Morris hits a drive on the up, but the offcutter ruins all his timing."
"<b>hits the leg stump</b> Another slower ball, the offcutter from Coulter-Nile, and Morris is into his slog way too early. Misses completely and the bowler has his hands on his head and his mouth open in the shape of an 'O'."
"length ball, wide outside off, Morris hacks it to wide long-on"
"slower delivery again, well wide of off stump, because KKR know Daredevils are looking to slog everything to leg. Good tactics. This results in a mis-hit pull to deep square leg"
"this is a short ball at top pace, and a littler closer to the off stump. So Morris swivels on his back foot and pulls it to the long leg boundary. Easy ball to put away"
"outside edge races away to the third man boundary. The fielder is up inside the circle, for Woakes to bowl the slower ball. He does, but Morris is fortunate to beat him, swinging for midwicket"
"plays the right shot, but he can't beat short third man this time. Morris is situated deep in his crease, looking for leverage. He gets all that he could possibly need, but the lack of pace is not welcome. The batsman tries to ramp it but finds Umesh"
"full delivery, very slow as well, just outside off. Shami swings for the fences, is beaten all ends up, but he pinches a bye"
"fullish, drifting on the pads, clipped uppishly through square leg, deep midwicket runs to his left and picks it up"
"good length, angling in on middle and leg, tucked off the pads to backward square leg"
"full, pushed across on off, de Grandhomme pushes it down to mid-off"
tucked off the pads to midwicket for a single
"and he has holed out to deep square leg here. Short of a length and Zaheer has rolled his fingers over the seam, so the ball does not come on to the bat as well as he would have liked. De Grandhomme tries to flick and does not keep it along the ground. Gets elevation but not distance. Billings runs in from the deep and snaffles it"
"fullish, on the pads at 133 kph, clipped out to deep midwicket"
"full, pushed across outside off, defended"
"full on off, whipped across the line through midwicket. Brings the bottom hand into play and floicks it to the left of mid-on"
"and now he goes straight. Pitched up outside off, drilled hard past the non-striker who has to bend low to evade it. <b>Gambhir jumps back to the top of the run-getters list</b>"
"drags the length back this time. Gambhir is pushed back and has to jump to get on top of the bounce, wears it on the pad"
"short, outside off, rocks on to the backfoot, shifts the weight back fluidly and swivels around with a pull through midwicket diving to his left"
<b>great catch by Rishabh Pant behind the stumps</b>. That's a spectacular effort. Good delivery from the bowler as well. On a length and tempting him to go after it. Uthappa has to slightly reach out for it and it is delivered with good pace. Gets an outside edge that flies away and Pant throws himself full-length to his right to snaffle a superb catch
sliding on the pads. Optimistic appeal for leg before from Zaheer. But that was heading down leg. Gambhir takes off for the leg bye and seems to be struggling. Throw fired at the non-striker's end. He does not really stretch forward but grounds the bat down well before the ball hits the stumps. He is well inside
"good length ball, angling away outside off, Pandey waits and opens the face of his bat to run it down to third man"
walks forward a step or two to this length ball and turns it away with the angle behind square on the leg side. Backward square leg in place and he cannot beat the fielder
"good length, slightly straightening late, Gambhir gets an inside edge to the leg side as he plays from the crease"
"that was pre-meditated from Gambhir and Zaheer strikes again. Comes down the track very early and Zaheer, seeing the batsman's intention, takes it away from him. Fires it outside off with the seam pointing there. Gambhir responds with a wild heave and finds the leading edge that is held by Mathews running back a few steps at backward point"
"short of a length, tucked off the hips to short fine leg. Wants a single but Yusuf sends him back. Direct hit could have had him in trouble"
"full and on the stumps, pushed straight back to the bowler"
"back of a length, on middle, jabbed through midwicket"
holds his pose superbly after lofting that straight down the ground. Full and coming into him. Just presents the full face of his bat and times it brilliantly
"on a length, stays in the crease and defends to midwicket"
"very full, on off and middle, carved out to mid-on after jamming the bat down"
"full on off, defended off the front foot to mid-off"
"on a length and pushed across at 125 kph, defended with an open face of the bat to backward point"
this time he errs in his length. Not giving the batsman room but drops it a tad too short. Sitting up nicely for Yusuf who pulls off hip height through deep backward square leg
"short of a length and Yusuf swats it uppishly, through square leg this time. There is a fielder in the deep and the ball drops short of him as he runs in. Yusuf didn't get it as fine as he wanted to"
"full, on the fourth-stump channel, very tight lines from Zaheer, not giving the batsman any room. Defended with an open bat face"
"short of a length, on off, Pandey comes forward and tries to pull it away. But no room again, whatsoever and he drags it back to the bowler"
"back of a length, angled across on off, gets on top of the bounce and dabs it wide of mid-on for a single"
"short of a length and angling in at pace on leg stump, tucked off the pads to deep backward square leg for one"
"short, generates good bounce at 139 kph, gets big on the batsman and hurries him with pace. Yusuf responds with an unconvincing hook. Bends his head down and takes his eyes off the ball which goes off the top-edge and hits the camera that is outside the boundary"
"back of a length again, stays back and hammers it through mid-on and midwicket for four"
"full, on leg stump, clipped off the toes to the right of mid-on for one"
"banged into the pitch again and angled in. But Pandey gets leg side of it early, and pulls off the backfoot through deep midwicket. Ball goes on the bounce over the boundary"
"stays leg side of it again and ends up exposing his stumps, short of good length, whipped away to square leg"
"sliding in on leg, clipped away to midwicket and they momentarily think of the second but Billings is on to the ball in a flash as he runs in from the deep"
"flatter trajectory, pushed through fuller, Yusuf gets down and sweeps along the ground to backward square leg"
"spinning away outside off from a length, comes forward and defends in front of the pad"
sees some width and flays it hard but straight to the fielder at cover
"slightly short of a length, manages to get on top of the bounce and pull against the spin through midwicket and mid-on, Billings at the deep runs to his left and fields it"
"full, on the pads, nudged away into the leg side"
"fullish length, turned away off the pads between mid-on and midwicket, mid-on runs across and picks it up"
backs away to make room to this length ball and carves it out to point
"short of a length, angling in, whipped away to wide long-on for one"
"short, outside off, Yusuf swivels around and pulls to square leg"
"full, outside off, driven hard off the front foot but straight to extra cover"
"that was almost one-handed. Full, outside off, that is just superb timing, no other way he could have got that kind of distance. Bottom hand comes off as he completes the shot, heaved away over cow corner"
"short and spinning away, slapped hard off the backfoot to the right of sweeper cover"
"tossed up wide outside off, mistimes the drive to long-off"
good use of the feet. Comes down the track and meets the pitch of the ball. Makes sure to give himself enough room before thumping it in the direction of the sigtscreen
tries to take it away from the batsman but fires it too wide outside off
"short and wide, cut off the backfoot to sweeper cover"
gets down for a slog sweep and gets an inside edge to the pad
what kind of a shot is that! That one's just brute force. Mishra drops it short again and there is room on offer outside off. Pathan opens up his arms and just flat-bats it. Shovels it straight down the ground
"short of a length, angling in to the body, gets cramped for room as he looks to punch and gets an inside edge to backward square leg"
"short of a length, at 123 kph, Pathan is through with the pull a tad early and the ball does not bounce as much as he would have liked. Gets it away off the bottom part of the bat"
"short and wide outside off, punched away square of the wicket for a single"
"back of a length, outside off, cut away to the left of sweeper for a single"
"misses the batsman's pad as well as the keeper diving to his left. Sliding on leg and Pandey tries to glance it away, gets the pad outside the line of the ball and it sneaks away just outside leg. Keeper fails to stop it as well"
"full, outside off, knocks it hard back towards the bowler"
"was that deliberate? Seems like. Short of good length but not much room on offer. Pandey hangs back and opens the face of his half-angled bat very late, gets an outside edge that goes past Pant diving full-length to his right and away to the third man boundary she goes"
"good shout for leg before. Not given. Short of a length, angling in, misses the bat as he is looking to tuck it away. Hit in front of leg, it seemed like. But the angle could have been taking it down the leg side"
"full, on middle and leg, pushes it down to long-on and jogs the single"
"short, sitting up nicely, pulled out to deep midwicket, straight to the fielder there"
"short of a length, angling in, drops it into the leg side and picks a single through square leg"
"sliding down the leg side, tries to glance it but misses and the ball kisses the pad on its way to the left of the wicketkeeper"
"on a length, not much pace from Mathews, so all he can do is whip it away uppishly wide of the mid-on region"
"shortish, pulled wide of mid-on. There is a fielder in place at long-on and he gets across to his right and fields it"
"full, just outside off, backs away and stabs it out with an open face of the bat through cover-point"
"fullish, outside off again, fetches it from outside off and thumps it hard in the direction  of long-on where the ball goes one-bounce to the fielder"
"full and wide, hangs back and opens the face of his bat to get it squarer of the third man fielder for one"
"slower short ball, flirting with the line outside off and called a wide. Seems like the right call in the end"
rolls his fingers over this shortish ball and Pathan does not find good timing on the pull to deep midwicket
on the pads and turned away to short fine leg. Manish Pandey sets off for a single but Yusuf has a fair idea of where that went and yells out a no. Pandey has to hurry back and a direct throw could have made things interesting
"full, on the pads, whipped away off them to deep backward square leg for one"
moves away outside leg stump early to give himself the room to free his arms. The bowler tries to follow him by angling it in but Pandey still finds the room he was looking for. Whip[s it uppishly off the pads and uses his wrists well to cart it over deep midwicket
"full and on the pads, clipped hard to wide long-on for one"
"slower short ball, just 106 kph, tries to pull but gets the timing all wrong. This time Pant was not standing up to the stumps and the ball drops into the surface after it takes the glove of Pathan"
sees him come down the track and the bowler fires it on the pad. The ball misses the flicks and goes off the pad to midwicket. They come charging back for the second. No direct hit at the non-striker's end and even a direct hit may still not have been good enough. Good running
"full and on the pads, clipped off them uppishly in the direction of deep midwicket, lands on the bounce in front of Billings who is guarding the boundary there"
"goes for a yorker outside off and ends up firing a full toss around knee height, punched down to long-off"
"another full toss, he is late in closing the face of the bat and it is pushed back to the bowler"
"full and wide, that is what he was looking for, squeezed down to long-off"
"gets the attempted wide yorker wrong again. Low full toss, outside off, Pathan responds with a full swing of the arms and deposits it over cow corner. <b>Fifty for Pathan</b>"
"low full toss again and this time it has been lofted straight down the ground. Long-off darts across to his right, slides in and throws the ball to the other fielder converging on it. Superb effort from Morris at the boundary, gets down and tidily cuts it off right in front of the boundary. They go upstairs to check if he has brushed the rope but he seems to have done fine there. They come charging back for the third and manage to beat the throw"
"full, on the pads, misses the flick and goes off the pad past the keeper diving to his left. Four through deep fine leg. After a great first spell, Zaheer has slightly lost it here"
"full, on middle and leg, clipped off the toes down to long-on for a single"
"full, around off, backs away and carves it out to cover"
"swing and a miss outside off. Fullish and outside off, tries to heave it away across the line and over the leg side. Makes no contact"
"full toss, angling into him, Yusuf does not miss out on those. Flicked off the pads to deep fine leg, helps it on its way"
"and he has his man with a short ball. It is outside off and comes on at a quicker pace Yusuf would have liked. He has to fetch a pull. Skews it off the top edge and Morris calls for it. Runs a few steps to his left on the follow-through and holds on to it. Critical breakthrough, but has it come a tad late for Daredevils?"
"full, outside off, opens the face of his bat and steers it through keeper and fly slip"
"back of a length and outside off, opens the face of his bat and guides it away to third man with an angled bat"
"shortish and angling into him, he arches back and pats it down to third man for a single"
"short and wide, flays it through backward point. Third man is quite square and he is able to get to it after sprinting to his right. Gets down and gets his hands to it. They check if he has made contact with the boundary ropes but he has done fine"
"short of a length, fired from wide of the crease and tries to tuck it away, off the pads to the on side"
"short, gets big on him, but he manages to get on top of it, and plays it from overhead down to long-on for a single. <b>Fifty for Pandey</b>"
"full, outside off, crunches a drive but cannot beat cover diving to his right. Yadav had taken off for a single and there is a yes and no. He has to hurry across and Cummins collects the throw and flicks the ball back onto the stumps. Morris was a split second late in releasing the ball. Could that have saved the batsman here? It has. He has made it back comfortably"
"good length, outside off, clears the front leg and slaps it away to sweeper cover"
backs away and carves it out through covers with an open bat face
"fuller ball, pushed down to long-on for an easy single"
full from Morris again and it is eased down to long-on for one. Four singles so far this over
"short, tries to pull but does not time it well, drags it down to long-on"
"full, he is backing away and the bowler follows him. Gets an outside edge away to square third man"
nicely done. Short but not much room. Arches back and lifts it over the keeper down to third man
"yorker from Cummins, backs away and exposes his stumps, but manages to jam the bat down"
"short ball, outside off, the bounce is too high and called a wide. Pandey does not bother going after it"
"short of a length, he is slightly down and gets it off the bottom part of the bat wide of long-on as he tries to pull it away. Takes on the fielder there and comes charging back for the second. Good running"
"short ball, gets big on him, pulled awkwardly deep midwicket"
"driven uppishly and straight into the hands of Zaheer at mid-off. Full and just outside off. Makes sure to give himself enough room and backs himself to go over the in-field. It was perhaps too full for his liking, does not get the elevation he was looking for and it's catching practice for Zaheer"
"short of a length, opens the face of his bat and pats it towards the right of the wicketkeeper for a single"
"full, angling in, pushed out wide of long-on. They push for two but end up settling for one"
"what an effort from Sanju Samson! My god, that is the best bit of fielding I have seen this IPL, trumps Stokes's effort in the previos game. Moves to his right, jumps up, catches it mid-air over his head. Flicks it back as he dives full-length over the boundary. Coming to the delivery, it was full, outside off and Pandey shovels it over long-on"
works it wide of long-on and comes back for the second
"short of a length and angling in, tucked off the pads through square leg"
"short, on leg, pulled behind square"
excellent delivery. Sees the batsman backing away and follows him. Fires it full and the ball goes from between the bat and pad and to the keeper
"full, wide, drills it hard after reaching out and knocks it back to the bowler. That was the googly"
"and he follows it up with a ripping legbreak. That one spins away a mile and the batsman has to reach out for it. It was flighted nicely and he is trying to fetch a slog. Loses his balance and drags the foot out. Can't slide it back it as Pant takes the bails off. Full marks to the keeper as well for collecting it despite the sharp turn. But, hang on. Has Pant collected it in front of the stumps. Ah, no. Seemed close from the first angle, but the next two seem okay. Yes, he is gone."
