"pulled away handsomely. Too short, he picked the length early, swivelled back and hammered it to deep square leg"
"defended back, bowler parries it towards cover"
"top-edges a pull and this sails all the way. That's the shortest boundary at fine leg, around 57 metres. What does a bowler do? Hustles him for pace, causes him to rush into the stroke and then sees the ball sail away."
"slower and fuller outside off, belted through the line to clear long-off. Stunning from Surya"
"cleverly done, opens the bat face late to steer this past the keeper to beat third man"

"slower and fuller again, Kishan lunges forward and defends"
beauty! Slants away and holds its line to beat Kishan's feeble push. Zips through to Rahul
"<b> beaten again! </b> At the moment, Kishan has no clue. Pokes tentatively, lucky there was no nick"

"draws him forward on the drive, Kishan gets a thick edge past slip to beat third man. Streaky"
"tucks him for room with a length ball into the ribcage, defended back"
"walloped deep into the stands at backward square leg! At Mohit's pace, that's asking for trouble. Swivels back and helps him over."
"steps out and slices this to clear deep point. Not where he wanted to hit it, but he'll take it. Wanted to go inside-out over cover. Beautiful piece of wood, I tell you"
"thick outside edge as he drives, this time to third man"
"steps out but is cramped for room by the length, bunted to mid-off for a quick single"
"slower and fuller on off, eased behind point"
"cross-batted heave but he can only hit it as far as mid-on. No timing, no power, dragged it from outside off. Clever from Tye, it's that knuckleball again."
"knuckleball, knuckleball and them seam-up. is there some bat on it? Yes! Two in two and Tye is on fire. Surya his hustled for pace as this skids on, he looks to play the short-arm jab to square leg but ends up getting a thick bottom edge edge that lobs off the thigh pad and is taken by the keeper."

"cramped for room, forces this nevertheless through cover off the backfoot"
"backs away, Axar drifts this into his swinging arc and Pollard muscles this over deep midwicket. Onto the top tier"
driven back towards long on
muscled over long-on. This is brute Pollard power to the fore. Fetched it from outside off but he knew what he was doing
"drills this past the diving extra cover fielder, Finch can't stop it despite a dive. <strong>Boundary when it should've just been a single</strong>"

"thumped over long-off, what a way to get to a half-century. This is some way to announce your return in style. <B>Pollard is pumped, fist-pumps towards the dressing room </b> Clearly being left out hurt him. What a way to channel that hurt. He's delivered when his team needed him to."
"length on middle, defended."
"bowls this carrom ball wide, Pandya mistimes this slap to cover"
"backs away and clobbers this straight to long-off. Ashwin bowled this just slightly wide outside off as he saw Pollard backing away, he went through with the stroke but didn't hit this off the middle and Finch takes an excellent catch moving to his left at long-off."

"looks for a slower ball, end up bowling it way outside off, rolled to the keeper"
"swing and a miss. Another slower length ball, looked to fetch it from outside off"
walks across and sweeps this high full toss straight to short fine leg. McClenaghan was on one knee as he looked to play the stroke but this was clearly over his waist. <b> Freehit coming up </b>
"walks across to help this over short fine, can only get hit on the pad, they scamper a legbye"
"right into the blockhole, squeezed off the pad to the keeper. He walked across to flick but couldn't get any bat on it"

short of a length ball with some shape into the body. Jabs it into the cover off the back foot
full ball in at leg stump. Stands tall to nudge this to deep square
<b>a superb landing</b> 50 metres behind the keeper. Rahul didn't want it to go there. Trying to tickle a short ball from his hips only to get a top edge
<b>beaten.</b> Length ball pushed across the corridor. A lazy jab at it from Rahul and it skids past his outside edge
<b>disappointed</b> with himself as he can't get this square cut past backward point. A hint of width outside off and he makes good connection on it
"short of a length on off stump, defended solidly on the back foot"
and there's the first one. A mean bouncer spitting across him. A tad too wide to make him play though. The crowd feels it
<b>nervous feet</b> from Gayle and a slight loss of shape as he fends this away. A short of a length ball in the corridor
"slower ball, short of a length on leg stump. Taps it to midwicket off the back foot"
"full and in at off stump. Front foot nice and close to the bat, with the full face offered. Drives straight to mid-off"

short of a length and in at off stump. Defended to point off the back foot
"<b>boom.</b> Pandya messes up his slower ball. It's dug very short and it's sitting up at leg stump. Gayle stands tall and slaughters it, over deep square"

"short ball on leg stump, tucked behind short fine off the back foot"
"short of a length on off stump, stabbed into the off side from the crease"
"<b>deceived</b> but he makes the best of it. Short of a length ball climbing up at him, a knuckle ball. He's in position to try and flick this but has to follow with his hands as it cuts away. Runs it past slip"
"<b>shot!/</b> Glorious flowing drive to beat extra cover to his left. An overpitched ball from Hardik, who has managed to be all over the place in a span of six balls. Nice transfer of weight through the forearms from Rahul as he extends them and keeps them along the floor"
"drilled. Mitch has changed ends and changed length. It's full and in at middle stump - perfect for Gayle to have a swing at it. And he does, four on the bounce at long-on"
short of a length and cramping him. Drags it out to long-on with a half-pull
"slower ball, full outside off. Opens the face and drives to sweeper cover"
<b>out of the way quickly.</b> A bouncer slanted in at his throat and Gayle is hopping to get out of the way. A customary air-ramp to make it look more convincing. He misses
"<b>got him!</b> The bouncer and the catch in the deep on the leg side - just like in the last game. Rohit points his finger and sprints at Ben Cutting, the fielder who went to his right at deep square to take this miscued hook. Mitch Mac is known for this specific wicket-taking ball. It's climbing, Gayle is swatting. Gayle is gone. Wankhede has burst into celebration"
"slower ball, full outside off. Leans in for the drive but can't time it. Gets it straight to extra cover"
"short of a length outside off, tapped into the covers off the back foot"
"slower ball, short of a length and into the pads. Deflected into the leg side as he looks to play the glance"
"short of a length just outside off, pushed to cover off the back foot"
deftly done. Short of a length outside off and he guides it past short third man with an open face
well played again. Short ball outside off and this time it's a controlled square cut. Krunal runs to his left and puts in a slide at sweeper and doesn't even bother getting off the floor as he throws it in
<b>oh yeah!</b> Is that Finch getting back into form? Two controlled chops and now an old-fashioned swing across the line to send this slower ball wayyyyyy over deep midwicket. A length ball on off and he's got such a sweet connection on this
"<b>miscued</b> but he doesn't need to more than clear mid-on. He does it. Beaten in flight and lofting agains the spin as he steps out, but it's one bounce and into the boundary"
<b>dropped!</b> An extremely difficult chance for Cutting at cover point. Rahul backs away and stabs aimlessly as this spins away from off stump. It floats high for Cutting who leaps to his right with his left-hand going at the ball and tips it over the bar
"length on off stump, punched into the covers"
"length ball into the pads, clipped into the square leg region"
oh shot. A quicker one fired down leg side. Quickly gets down on a knee and uses the pace to ramp this over short fine
"floated up at off stump, drives to extra cover with soft hands to steal the single"
"<b>nice.</b> Waits and waits. It's a slow turner from Markande, but it's very short. He hangs deep and bisects backward point and short third man"

"full on the stumps, stays in the crease and pokes this into the midwicket region with soft hands"
"short of a length on middle stump, hurries him as he goes on the back foot and punches to deep midwicket"
"short of a length on off stump, punched to long-on off the back foot"
"tossed up at off stump, leans in to drive to sweeper cover"
oh no. Poor bowling. Rahul's been putting these away since he was 10. Short and wide. Decent pace on it too - perfect for a square cut that is executed perfectly
"length ball outside off, pushed to extra cover off the front foot"
"tossed up at middle stump, gets to the pitch and whips to deep midwicket"

"full ball at off stump, drives to sweeper cover"
"short ball at middle stump, swivels and plays a short-arm pull to deep square"
backs away and makes room. But he finds backward point with the cut. Slower ball lifts up at off stump
"slower ball outside off, handsomely punched to sweeper's left on the up"
"overpitched on off stump, with some shape in. Driven firmly to long-off"
short of a length skidder on middle stump. Shovelled to deep midwicket from deep in the crease
arm ball into the pads. Tickles to short fine's left off the back foot
"length just outside off, driven on the up to long-off"
<b>gets on his knee</b> and swipes right. On the cricket field that's a four. Length ball angled in at leg stump and finds the long leg boundary
"length on middle stump, punched to long-on"
"<b>sixth fifty</b> in seven chasing innings. Sixth in the tournament as well. Gets calmly behind this length ball and nudges to long-on. KL Rahul, once again, has got into the zone."
"length ball on middle stump, punches on the up to long-on"
short ball outside off. Looks to guide this to third man's right but finds point
"length ball at middle stump. Taps it into the mid-on region and they takes off for the quick one. Mitch Mac swoops down on it from midwicket to his left, but can't get a decent throw in. Good effort"
"short of a length angled in the body. Looks to flick, cops it on the body"
"short of a length outside off, swats at it and gets a thick outside edge to third man"
"short of a length on middle stump, pushed towards long-on off the back foot"
length ball angled in at off stump. Skips across and whips to deep square
there it is. Rahul's newfound superpower to find boundaries behind the wicket. Short ball angled into him and he caresses it with the pace past short fine leg. Not the smartest length from the bowler with fine leg in
"short of a length outside off, mistimed chop to extra cover"
"<b>just clears mid-off</b> and Cutting's slide is not enough for him to pull this back. Short ball outside off, Finch backs away and picks the right direction to go with the drive on the up - but it's off the toe-end"
"short of a length on leg stump, whipped to deep square"
"offcutter dropped short outside off, slapped on the up to sweeper cover"
"length on middle stump, clips to deep midwicket off the front foot"
short of a length ball at off. An ugly hoick from Finch. Off the inside half of the bat and running away from Cutting at deep midwicket. He sprints and lunges to his right to stop this
"<b>bludgeoned.</b> Krunal Pandya, what are you doing sticking your hand out at that?! A full ball floated up at middle stump and the shot would have taken the bowler with it if he had miraculously reacted quick enough to get a hand on it"
"length on the stumps, driven to long-on"
"length ball at middle stump, looks to get it fine with a paddle sweep but it's deflected into the off side"
"short of a length at middle stump, steps out and taps to long-on"
"full toss on off stump, backs away and drills it to long-off"
"offcutter, very short and wide. Left alone"
another one. This one barely lands on the pitch outside off
<b>gets it right.</b> Well bowled. Rahul looks to clobber this length ball over midwicket from outside off. It's an offcutter that sits in the pitch and climbs past the outside edge
"slower ball, short and wide outside off. Mistimed cut towards sweeper cover"
nice. Very nice. Steep bouncer is too much for Finch as he looks to hook. Carries nicely to Kishan
"overpitched outside off, driven hard but straight to sweeper cover"
"full on off stump, driven straight to long-off"
"short of a length slider at middle stump, pushed to long-on off the back foot"
"loopy, tossed up ball on leg stump. Finch swings hard. Gets a thick inside edge to deep midwicket's right...comes back very casually and just makes his ground as Kishan deflects the throw onto the stumps"
<B>top edge!</b> Lands to short third man's left. He's teasing Finch here. Loopy length ball spinning away from off. He's backing into the leg side and swinging for midwicket
"<B>lifts it over short third</b> but hasn't hit it too well. Krunal pedals backwards and flicks it back for point who has given him an option. Rahul lifted this with a reverse-scoop, it was full on off stump"
you gorgeous man! Rahul jumps down confidently to meet this length ball at leg stump and holds his shape - perfect shape - to cream this over  the straight boundary
"<b>what pressure?</b>, Rahul asks as he jumps down once more and sends this flying into the second tier over long-on! What a player this guy is. He hasn't got to the pitch of this after stepping out but he goes through and launches it long"
"<b>good catch from Hardik Pandya.</b> This ball has gone at least five stories up from what I can see. He has to run in from deep midwicket with half an eye on Evin Lewis who is coming in from deep square. For most of his journey, that ball is possibly just a dot in the sky. For some of it, it's swerving. And by the end, it's coming down hard. He is fully composed through it all and completes it. Good job. Finch was looking to bludgeon this length ball over deep square leg"
"length ball, driven firmly back down the pitch. Deflects into the midwicket region off Bumrah's leg"
"full toss outside off, driven to sweeper cover's right. It's running away, running away...but so is Krunal Pandya! This family has been given the fielding gene, that's for sure. Slides to his right and keeps it in play"
short ball in at the hips. He shovels it uppishly to deep midwicket
"<b>appeal immediately, given immediately!</b> Bumrah has turned it on! Stoinis has no answer to this mean bouncer headed for his face. Not even close to playing a hook. It's flicked the glove before half his swing is in. He's out before he can put in a semblance of a follow through. What. An. Over."
"short of a length outside off, driven on the up. Uppishly to extra cover."
"backs away, gets a length ball. Can't make use of it. Gets it wide of long-off off the toe-end"
<b>top edge</b> lands well in front of deep midwicket. Short ball and he looks to pull. Hurried on it
<b>bye-bye!</b> Don't. Bowl. Short. It's climbing up at Rahul's shoulder but he has swiveled much before it can get close and swatted to this to the long leg boundary
<b>shot!</b> Rahul with the reminder he's still around. Slower ball dropped short outside off. He swivels and reverse-swats this over short third man!
"<b>genius.</b> KL Rahul knows exactly what's coming. He's made it so - he's making the bowler do it. Another slower ball dropped short, another reverse-swipe to third man"
"yorker outside off, jams it to extra cover from the crease"
slower ball. Pitches and cuts away from the wide marker. Rahul leaves
"lovely bowling. Slower ball yorker. Dipping outside off, toe-ended to long-off. That wasn't the intention"
"low full toss on middle stump, dragged along the floor to long-on"
"<b>he's got him!</b> There is one hero in the Mumbai Indians team too! 2 for 12 in his fourth over before this ball. Jasprit Bumrah's slower ball has deceived Rahul again. It's in the slot - overpitched outside off - and Rahul is looking to deposit this over long-off. It's off the toe-end and is taken well inside the boundary. It's a sensational, if not legendary innings, from this man. But he's fallen with 10 balls to go."
"low full toss, opens up his body and punches to long-off"
<b>inside edge</b> onto body. A short ball and a nervous poke from Yuvraj. Single pitch side on the leg side...
"overpitched outside off, drilled straight to long-off"
wide yorker outside off. Very wide. He swings across the line and misses. Ishan Kishan fumbles and they sneak a bye. That should have been a wide...
<b>oh he's missed a juicy length ball</b> outside off. That was there for the six. Yuvraj swings and can't get bat on it
<B>leaves it alone</b> and probably skips a heartbeat! But it's well judged in the end. Length ball pushed across the wide marker
"<b>holes out to sweeper cover!</b> It's the third length ball in a row from Mitch, and this time he even gets rewarded for it. Yuvraj uses the angle and tries to go off side - ends up slicing it straight to deep extra cover"
at last! A poor ball that's been punished! Axar Patel lines up this full toss with a lot of width outside off and slaps it over long-on.
<b>misses the bouncer</b> and is now involved in a run out appeal at the non-striker's end. Both the batsman and the bowler are caught napping. Axar beats Mitch to the stumps. Third umpire confirms he's in. But are Kings XI? Not really...
"<b>it's a good shot</b> but it won't be enough. To be fair it wouldn't be enough if he'd lifted that a few 100 metres further. Short ball into the ribs, pulled past short fine"
