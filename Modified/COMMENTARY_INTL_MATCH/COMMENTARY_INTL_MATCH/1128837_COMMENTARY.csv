rolls out the sweep right away and finds square leg
"tossed up liberally outside off, Shehzad stretches out and eases it to extra cover"
"Devcich nails the stumps at the non-striker's end but old dog Sanga slides his bat in time. Shehzad rides the bounce of this short ball outside off, and chops to extra cover. There's a mix-up but enough time for Sanga to undo his steps"

"full and just a shade outside off, back to leaving the ball is Sanga"
hip-high short ball outside off - you've got to get it up higher - Sanga swivels on the back foot and <strong>crunnnnnnches a pull</strong> to the midwicket boundary
"<strong>big dipper</strong> - a la Dwayne Bravo - drops sharply, dug out in front of leg stump"
"Sanga storms down the track again and puts it over Sohail's head. He manufactures his own length - half-volley - and hits it hard, flat, and straight. As simple as that"

"pushed through on off, defended back to Yasir"
Sanga continues to use his feet and find the straighter boundaries. He hoists it with the turn over wide mid-on

"short, wide, flashed straight to backward point"
"on a length and outside off, bunted through cover"
"<strong>Sanga backs away and holes out to Devcich at wide long-off</strong>. Narine spotted the batsman moving away and speared a shorter offbreak. Pitches on middle and turns away.

"back of a length and outside off, forced to Baz at cover"
"What was that, Shehzad? Slower one, breaks away wide outside off, Shehzad had shuffled across off, aiming for the ambitious scoop to fine leg. He had no pace to work with and was playing against the angle and break. He only tickles an outside edge to the keeper"
"back of a length on off, chopped away behind point for one"

"sharp offbreak, pitches outside off and turns in, clipped straight to midwicket"

"on a length, seems to have pitched outside leg, zips away to beat Malik for pace and strike the front pad. The lbw appeal is shot down. Afridi and <strong>Lahore challenge the on-field not-out decision</strong>. The tracker confirms it pitched outside leg"
deflected off the pads to fine leg. The keeper chases it hard
"Malik dares to step down the track. Afridi digs it shorter and outside off. Malik pulls it to deep midwicket, where Sohail is a few yards in as opposed to staying at the edge of the boundary. He, however, clings onto this overhead catch. Joy for Afridi; his first wicket in this PSL"
"<strong>Afridi is on a hat-trick</strong>! Screeching inswinging yorker, <b>142ks</b>, breaches through the defences of Whiteley, and barges into his castle. Whiteley was too late on that one. Replays, however, indicate it ricocheted onto the stumps off the pad"
"short and angling across off, the batsman gets behind the line in defence"
"<strong>No hat-trick but Afridi bags three wickets in four balls</strong>. Just short of a good length and running away outside off with the angle, Badar looks to turn it away to the leg side. Instead, he spoons a leading edge to short cover. His <strong>figures read: 2-0-2-3</strong>. Masterstroke from Baz?"

"A mix-up between the wickets and good work from Baz at the non-striker's end. Nice to see that smile on his face. This was full and straight, clipped away more or less straight to Fakhar at short midwicket. He swoops down on the ball, then throws it to Baz, who is beside the stumps at the non-striker's end. He coolly collects the ball and breaks the bails to catch Tanvir short"

"just misses the yorker, this full inswinger is swatted away to deep midwicket"
follows three yorkers or very full balls with a slower ball from the back of the hand. Look at the sharp dip on that. Pollard would do well at look away. He had no clue about this variation: he swung early to the leg side and missed it altogether. Sohail hits the top of off stump and celebrates
"yorker on off, dug back into the toe and onto the pitch"

"follows the full-toss with a menacing short ball. Ducks back in, the batsman looks away and cops a glancing blow on the grille of the helmet"
"Afridi wins an lbw appeal, but Junaid calls for a review. This looks adjacent, though. This was pretty full and swerves back in sharply to beat the inside edge and strike the back pad on the knee-roll. The tracker returns umpire's call on leg stump. <strong>Afridi's figures: 4 for 4</strong>"
Whoa! Afridi leaves the stumps in a mess and <strong>claims extraordinary figures of 5 for 4</strong>. Another screeching inswinging yorker - a la Mitchell Starc - hits the base of middle stump as Irfan is so very late to bring his bat down. Afridi celebrates his five-wicket haul with a <i>sajda</i>

"back of a length on middle, worked to midwicket"
"tossed on middle, Devcich gets under this full ball on middle and lifts it over Malik's head"
"Sangappeal, and the umpire gives it out. Devcich reviews. He had given himself room, slashed so hard that he lost his shape, and ended up missing the ball. <b>Ultra Edge detects a spike - this looks a like deflection off the bat into the stumps and onto the gloves of Sangakkara</b>. The bails refused to light up but Sanga did amazingly well to ride the bounce and pouch it"

"mighty full on off, this is dug back to the right of Tahir"
"Tahir is off on another furious celebratory run. Another wrong'un, tossed up and breaks away outside off. Fakhar goes against the turn but gets more height as opposed to distance. He skies a slog-sweep to Pollard at the long-on boundary"
"short and into the body, fended onto the pitch"
"on a length and outside off, pushed up to mid-off"
"fullish on off, defended to cover"
"An appeal for caught behind, not given by the umpire Robinson. Shehzad is so sure Multan have their man, though. Umpire Robinson asks Shehzad to review if he's so sure. And Multan do review, and there's a nick. UltraEdge detects it. Back of a length and angling away outside off with extra bounce, the batsman is bothered by the lift and feathers it behind to give Multan an opening"
