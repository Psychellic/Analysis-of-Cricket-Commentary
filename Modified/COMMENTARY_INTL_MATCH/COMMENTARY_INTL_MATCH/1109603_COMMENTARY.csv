what a response from the batsman! Just a little bit of flight from Herath and Dhawan springs down the track before lofting him with the turn for a huge six over long-on. Got right on top of that and timed it beautifully

He plays around his front pad and is rapped on the flap. The tracker suggests it was heading down leg and bouncing too much as well. Karunaratne has to wait for his maiden Test wicket"

Pushed through on middle from around the wicket, Dhawan dares to sweep from the stumps. He deploys a big stride but does not make contact. He is pinned on the pad in front of middle and leg.

"<b>close, close.</b> Top class from Herath. Starts this floater outside off, gets it to dip and drift in sharply. First ball for Rahane. He has a big front foot plant outside off and it nearly undoes him. It's prime to strike him in front of middle, but he gets the bat down just in time"

Two reds - where it pitched and impact - but one green - the ball bounces over the stumps. Another tight one. Good call from umpire Tucker"

"<strong>wafted between slip and gully</strong>! Length ball, angled in, and spins away, kicks up at Mendis. The batsman is caught between jabbing and leaving. These are the seeds these two spinners sow in the mind. Mendis is late to pull his bat inside. Mendis ultimately lobs it nervously between Rahane at first slip and Pujara at gully. The ball just flew between the two close-in fielders"

"tosses it up on middle, Mendis covers the line, getting intentionally squared up to block with soft hands"

"pushes down the ground with a straight bat, lunging forward to get to the pitch"

"straight to square leg! There's enough happening off this pitch without mistakes like these. But perhaps on second thought, that is an attacking fielder, especially to Chandimal, who is an avid sweeper of the ball. He got his first boundary that way, and struck that in the air too.

"taken at mid-on! India have another and poor Mendis has to walk back. He wants to lift the ball - good length on leg stump - over the infield. An effort to try and break India's stranglehold, but he doesn't quite get enough on it. And Kohli, running back, quickly enough, makes a slightly difficult catch look ridiculously commonplace"

"blocks a quicker delivery on middle, expecting it to straighten and so it does"
"<b>huge puff of dust</b>. It's like an Eastwood movie and Jadeja's the mean man under the hat, low over his brow, surveying the carnage.

"fires it into leg stump at 96 kph, wanting the pitch to give it a little oomph. Mathews is playing with a closed face and finds a single to square leg"
"shifts outside off to pull out his favourite sweep. Two things with this shot, he's exposed his stumps, and he did so to avoid Kohli at short backward square leg. Risk-reward, the Dickwella way"

leans forward to a flighted delivery outside off and pushes to mid-on
"93 kph - and that pace, combined with the length - so full - and the line - on off stump - makes the batsman play only for the wild turn to tell him how futile he was in thinking he could get bat to it"

"wanders down the pitch and though he isn't close enough at all to the ball, he goes through with the shot and gets great reward"
"short ball, outside off, slaps it to point"
that's a sensational hit! Fitting to bring up the hundred. Mathews sees the ball on leg stump and meets it with a straight and angry bat
"<b>beats him next ball</b> - and it's the usual dart from Jadeja, pitching full on middle, and leaping past the outside edge and into the wicketkeeper like a happy child into their parents' arms"
turns a fuller delivery on leg stump through deep square leg
"plays it on line - the slog sweep, seeing the room outside off - and he makes sure to mind the turn and bounce. Dickwella has a great sense for the cricket ball."
"pulverises the overpitched delivery over Jadeja's head. Massive strike. Sri Lanka are actively trying to put India's spinners off their lengths. But with 600-plus on the board, that should be a bit hard"
"goes back to a reasonably fuller delivery and has to go through the hassle of bringing his bat down rapidly to protect his stumps, and his pads"
makes room and lashes a short delivery on the stumps through point. Ashwin is bowling a lot slower than Jadeja and that is allowing the batsman the time to play shots like these. That's the <b>fifty partnership</b>
blocks a quicker delivery on middle and leg to mid-on
"<b>that's a mis-hit</b> and with Jadeja at deep square leg, the sweep will remain a risk. Dickwella knows he is good with that shot though and gets away with it as the ball goes to the right of India's best fielder"
"pushes through on leg stump, Dickwella nudges through vacant midwicket"
"<b>that is simply not possible and yet Pujara comes up with the ball in his hand</b>! What a catch at leg gully, off a full blooded flick behind square leg! We can savour the moment as the umpires check on the legality of the catch. Ashwin gets a little bounce on the offbreak, and Mathews tries to ride it, and he might well have because the ball is going down to Pujara's left. But he moves smartly, gets his hand under the ball and takes it superbly"

"Dickwella pre-meditates a reverse-sweep, this breaks sharply and bounces past the leg stump and Saha"
"speared on off stump, 94ks, Dickwella anticipated it. Hung back and worked it wide of short leg"
"Dickwella continues to be proactive. He runs down the pitch now, gets close to this full ball on middle, and bunts it down to long-on"
"bye, bye Dhananjaya. What a ball from Jadeja! What a way to bring up 150 wickets in Test cricket. Quick fizzer, nearly 95ks, too fast for Dhananjaya to press forward. Slides in from around the wicket and turns away slightly with extra bounce to open him up, beat the outside edge and kiss the off bail. The turn wasn't sharp but the bounce was. More clouds of dust from the surface"

"sharp turner, zips back in from outside off, cramps Dickwella for room. He jabs it down"
"slower and just a shade outside off, Dickwella unfurls the sweep again. Goes low and lifts it over backward square leg though he wasn't in total control of the shot"

"faster and shorter outside off, allowing Dickwella to use the depth of the crease and crunch it to cover"
"back of a length and turns away outside off, not full enough, tapped to point"
"the change of angle does not fluster Dickwella. Pushed through outside the leg stump, this line feeds the sweep as well. He opens up his hips and pastes it over midwicket"
"Dickwella expects the shorter ball, camps back, takes it from the stumps and manufactures a cut through the covers"
"pushed through outside off, spins in a bit, inside-edged onto the pad"
"Ashwin tosses it up generously outside off, 77ks, Perera likes the flight. He gallops down the track, extends his hands, and launches it over the long-on boundary. Clean strike"
"Dickwella pre-meditates the reverse again. But this is on off, he is cramped up and the length isn't quite there for the shot as well. He ends up shovelling it towards mid-off"

"starts outside off and twirls in, defended to short leg"
"pushed through on on off, nudged through cover"
"Has Saha missed a stumping chance here? Too difficult. Turn and bounce, curves in from outside off, zips past the inside edge, <strong>kisses the top of the pad</strong>. Saha has to deal with a lot of extra bounce and can't collect it cleanly"
"shorter on of, goes back and punches it back to Ashwin"
breaks into the pad and lobs to the close-in fielder
"short and spinning down leg, left alone"
worked with the spin to backward square leg
Dickwella races down even before Jadeja delivered. He pulls his length back and ensures the batsman does not get anywhere close to the pitch. Dickwella still adjusts and flicks to midwicket
"hurled outside off, 96ks, Jadeja finds extra bounce as well, no shot"
"tossed outside off and spins away, Perera plays with soft hands and ensures the soft outside edge does not carry to second slip"
"looped up on off, Perera has a giant stride and defends it stoutly to cover"
"Dickwella's high-risk cricket fetched him a 44-ball fifty. His high-risk cricket now sees him scoop the ball right back onto the stumps. He pre-meditates by venturing a long way across the off stump. Shami keeps his head. Good length and angled in on off, Dickwella attempts to ramp it over the keeper's head, T20 style. Just deflects it back onto middle and off stumps, about half an hour before lunch"
"dug in short and outside off, can't sweep or reverse these. Herath stands up tall and forces it back to the bowler"
"good length and angled in on off, Herath covers up in defence"
"133ks head-hunting lifter from Shami, he hits the deck hard and has Herath ducking hurriedly"
"short and wide outside off, 142ks, Herath stands up tall and flat-bats it away past the right of Ashwin at short cover"
"Shami cleans up Herath! It's all going pear-shaped for Sri Lanka. The bowler goes wide of the crease and slants it in, Herath looks for a big whip across the line. Shami hurls it at nearly 140ks and shoots through Herath as the ball thuds into middle stump"
"Dilruwan comes a loooong way down the track. Jadeja spots it, pulls his length back significantly, lobbed off the thigh pad to gully as he offers no shot. Had the fielder thrown the stumps down, Dilruwan would have been run out"

Pushpakumara stands tall to meet this 139ks short ball outside off and punch it to Umesh at backward point

"pushed through on the stumps, whipped away through midwicket"
"Poor Pradeep. He walks in with an injured hamstring and gets bowled for a duck. Ashwin caps the innings with another five-wicket haul. He hung this offbreak up outside off, turns in, Pradeep was attempting to let it go. The ball grazes the inside edge and rolls back onto the stumps"

makes him reach a touch outside off with an offbreak pitched up

lets the shortish delivery come to him and he taps down it with the gentlest touch
opens the face and punches a short and wide delivery through cover
"beautiful bowling! It's a nip-backer and it's a right good 'un. Really, it's a bit like the perfect con artist, waiting until its mark is in the worst possible position - Tharanga with his front leg not really moving, his head falling over, a gap between bat and pad and the stumps perfectly left open for the full-length ball, pitching on off and darting in off the pitch to slam into it."

"clips a fuller delivery off his pads, but midwicket denies him the chance to get off the mark"
gets up right behind the back of a length delivery on off stump
stout-hearted defence from Mendis as Umesh continues bowling short but straight
"seems to flirt with a good length ball at 87 mph outside off. Mendis pulls his bat inside the line perhaps just in time. Good bowling from Umesh, changing the length, and deriving movement after plying the batsman with several short balls"
"blocks towards point, with a slightly open face"
"<b>how has that missed off stump?</b>. So good, especilaly with the new ball. Because it's hard, and it can get quicker turn than if it was soft. But for a spinner to control it so well, to make it drift in sharply, dip so that the batsman on the front foot can't reach it, and rag past the outside edge..."
goes for the reverse-sweep - he's made to play high-risk shots because of Ashwin's control - and the ball only just goes over the slips
lunges forward to block outside off

"back of a length and outside off at 141 kph, pushes to cover"
"blocks another 141 kph delivery, this one on middle"
"eyes on the ball, body behind it, defending late. He's definitely doing all he can to stay out in the middle. Just like he did in the previous innings."

<b>appeal for lbw</b> as Karunarante strides down the pitch to block outside the line of a slider on middle and off.
"<b>puff of dust</b> as this quicker, flatter delivery hits a good length area on leg stump. The line helps Karunaratne get off strike with a flick behind square"
"<b>dropped at mid-on</B>. Could Dhawan have done better, pushing forward and getting his fingers under the ball? It was dying, so it was a touch difficult. But at this level... In any case, Mendis, haring down the pitch to slam the ball over the top, survives despite the mis-hit"
blocks into the leg side
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
"the ball keeps coming into the body at 138 kph, Karunaratne clips to short midwicket"
"he seems to like this angle, and this length. Another short ball into the body is sent to the deep square leg boundary"
"moves across onto off stump, waits until the ball is under his eyes, and works it to midwicket"
"well bowled, and wisely left alone. Shami pitches it up just outside off, Karunaratne shuffles across and watches it very very carefully before choosing to do nothing"
"another leave alone as Shami seems to be getting the ball to straighten a tad, at 138 kph, and off a good length."
defends a flighted delivery on off stump
"fine shot, enabled by his foray down the pitch, and his decision not to overhit the flighted ball outside off. Gets a boundary past mid-on's left for his trouble."
"this time he holds nothing back, and the ball sails over deep midwicket. Spots a loopy delivery outside off and gives it his best wallop"
another trip down the pitch to tap a tossed up ball outside off to long-on
"now it's the left-hander's turn to race down the pitch to Ashwin, who then pushes it through onto leg stump to prevent any hitting room"
"well waited, and the late cut finds the boundary because of it. Helps that Ashwin bowls this one short, and the pitch, for once does something in the batsman's favour, for the turn is enough for Karunaratne to free his arms"
"excellent shot, between midwicket and mid-on, enabled by Shami straying a touch too close to leg stump"
defends to short midwicket the just short of a good length delivery on middle
"goes for the drive, because the length demands it, but Karunartne ends up playing the shot a touch too early. The ball, as a result, goes to short midwicket"
"unveils another good cut shot, getting close to the short of a length delivery and outside off, and then playing gently"
"<b>straightens</b> off a good length, right in line with off stump, so Mendis has to play and he gets a bit of an outside edge to point"
blocks a short ball at 138 kph on middle stump
"comes down the track for a push to mid-on. First ball's at 89 kph, full and outside off"

drives to mid-on and sets off straight away
"tossed up on off stump, opens the face and drives to cover"
"stays in his crease and has to adjust to a quick, but full delivery, aimed at off stump with his hands"
"a slog sweep over mid-on this time! Sri Lanka are going to go the Dickwella way, hitting the spinners out before they settle into a rhythm. Not the worst plan, really. Just that India can persevere with their own wit ha 387-run lead"
"loops it up outside off, drawing out the cover drive. But because the ball dips, Karunaratne is beaten"
"pushes this one through on middle and leg, Karunaratne defends with bat in front of pad"
presses forward to block a flighted delivery on off stump
"defends a quicker, but full length delivery on off stump, and gets an outside edge past the right of silly point"
hangs back to block a short of a good length ball on middle and leg. But it turns so sharply Karunartne is playing it in front of off stump
"conscious of not closing his bat face too quickly, Karunaratne pushes a ball angled into his pads to mid-on"

"short and outside off, Mendis slaps to backward point, where Abhinav, the substitute for Shami, moves quickly to his right"
"<b>ripper</b> beats the outside edge, but Mendis might well have accounted for that possibility, playing inside the line of the ball, playing for the one coming on with the arm on middle, and not following the turn"
"shortish and outside off, dabs it towards point"
"<b>massive appeal</b>, but the wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha who caught the ball is really not keen on this, and he persuades Kohli not to take the review. Just another good length ball pitching on off and taking exit 53 past the outside edge. <b>Ultra-Edge confirms Saha is right</b>"
"tosses it up outside off, Karunaratne plants a defensive, but open faced, bat down on it"
"goes for a sweep, off middle, risky. But in this case, he gets just enough bat on the ball to prevent lbw"

"<b>that's just sexy</b> right down to the puff of dust erupting from the pitch. It is tossed up, it drifts in, dips before the batsman can get anywhere near it, and then leaves the outside edge behind like a hasty vacationer forgetting their sunscreen"
"shortish and outside off, Karunaratne tries to cut, but the bounce beats him"
"another play and miss, this time the bounce is lower than Karunaratne expects as he cuts"

"pushes it through quick on off stump, Mendis defends well"
"shortish and outside off, Mendis thinks about a cut, but the bounce is too high and so he pulls out."
Dimuth pre-meditates a lap. He stretches across the off stump. The line and length - outside off and full - allows him to execute that shot. Swept behind square
"<b>nasty bounce</b>! Raps the glove. Tossed up, bursts off the pitch, creates a massive puff of dust, but there's nobody at short leg to catch it"

"round-arm, angled in from outside off, Mendis plays for the angle like most batsmen do. But Jadeja viciously gets it to <strong>break past the outside edge</strong>"
"<strong>Did this flick the outside edge on the way to Saha?</strong> Big appeal for caught behind. Jadeja wins an appeal from Oxenfored. Mendis asks for a review. Replays show daylight between the bat and ball. The bat is a long way inside the line. The ball flicks the thigh and settles into the gloves of Saha. They check for the lbw as well, but this is bouncing over the stumps. This ball was just doing too much. Fired in from wide of the crease, Mendis plays the angle again, but this turns sharply past the bat"

<b>between slip and gully</b>. Pushpakumara has dilly-dallied with an open faced bat and the outside edge slides past Kohli's left at gully. The captain got up off his crouch a touch too early.
"launches it over mid-on! That's the shot he was looking for earlier in the over, only this time, he has the room to free the arms better. Picks it up on the half-volley and smashes it"
"a pitched up delivery, now from over the wicket, draws the drive on the up from Karunaratne. He's into the shot a touch too early though - like a nervous intern on his first day at the job - and the ball wanders to midwicket"

<b>another rip-roaring delivery</b> and Shami gets the double tea pot going because this too beats the outside edge. To make the ball in its 65th over seam away after hitting the deck like that requires Shami-loads of talent

"tosses it up well outside off, Karunaratne tries a sweep, but his reach isn't quite as big as that. Wanders off the pad to slip"
"<b>dropped</b> by Rahul at short leg, and it came straight to him too. Tough position to field at, but considering he is there to take such chances - with Karunaratne reaching for a good length ball to flick - he'd be rather disappointed"
pushes it down the ground past the bowler's left
"a token block, although he's hiding the bat away on middle stump, covering himself for the slider coming on with the arm, whereas the ball turns towards slip"
"plays late, plays well, continues to frustrate Shami with that broad, deadpan face (and bat)"
pushes to a wide-mid on with Shami going back around the wicket
"watches a back of a length delivery in the way a con man would his next mark, but lets him go. Another time."
"wide delivery again, perhaps testing Karunaratne's patience in the nineties. Result: A+"
"short ball on off stump, Karunaratne gets under it"
"<b>that's his hundred</b>! Fourth in the second innings, sixth overall, and among the very best on such a rank turner. Gets to the mark with a sedate on-drive - that's how he's been all innings as balls kept racing past his edges like teenage drivers - and celebrates with a big smile as the ground and his team-mates stand up"
he would have had to climb a skyscraper to have put bat to this one! So much bounce off a good length. Pushpakumara does well not to follow it and Saha does sensationally to take it
"another that beats the bat, by about six feet vertically. This one pitched further up, bringing the batsman forward, making him play and leaving him behind"
"spears it into the toes, Pushpakumara digs it out"
hides the bat and pad away from the line of a good length ball spinning past him
"attempts a cut, but he's beaten. Pushpakumara doesn't care. He's just happy he didn't nick it. Good attitude"
"presses forward and blocks, expecting the slider and getting it, at 97 kph"
"<b>snorter first up</b>, pitching on a good length, and taking the elevator to the shoulder of the wicketkeeper. Karunarante has to put that behind him"
"shimmies down and drives to mid-off, getting to the pitch of the tossed up delivery"
"draws the drive out with his flight and drift onto middle stump, outside edge wanders past silly point's right"
gets down to sweep a tossed up delivery outside off past straight midwicket
nudges a fuller delivery on his pads to deep square leg
"shapes to cut, waiting on his back foot, but the turn makes him check his shot. Since it is slow turn, he is able to check his shot"
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
"well done, as he takes a good length ball outside off and sweeps right on top of it."
<b>zips past the outside edge</b> as one of the close-in fielders  says 'aayega' [wicket will come]
"sweeps him away, risky shot, considering the bounce on this pitch, but the line was outside leg stump, and Pushpakumara took the requisite care to get his wrists on top of the ball. Super batting"
another good length ball that darts past the outside edge.
"this is quicker, pitching on leg stump, and searching for middle. Pushpakumara swept a similar ball away, but this one's too quick for such indulgences"
"tosses it up outside off, dab sweep to fine leg"
"comes forward to try and block, but the offbreak takes a bit of the surface with it on its way to striking Pushpakumara on his chest"
presses forward to block at a flighted delivery outside off
"appeal for a bat-pad catch, but the turn is fairly sharp and it beats the inside edge handsomely while Pushpakumara is defending. He's batting so well. Playing close to his body, playing late, and with soft, soft hands"
"goes for the sweep, and it lobs up to leg gully, who moves back, tracking the ball."
"goes back to a good length ball that spits up from outside off. Pushpakumara tries to block, but the turn beats him, lobs off his thighs to short leg"
"Dimuth dances down the track, is beaten in flight, so checks his flick and chips it in front of short midwicket"
"Dimuth stretches out, takes this turning ball from off, sweeps with the turn to fine leg. Rolled his wrists and controlled it superbly"
"97ks, arm ball accompanied by extra bounce, fizzes in on off stump, Malinda angles it to slips"
"slides in quicker on off again, presses forward and smothers it"
"hint of turn for Jadeja, on a length, Malinda capably defends"
"fuller and faster on off stump, non-turner, Malinda jabs his bat down and keeps it out"
"tossed up outside off, drifts in and turns a touch, Dimuth does not reach out for the ball. Plays with soft hands, and it <strong>does not carry to slip</strong>"
"Oh Malinda, what was that? A coach will rip his hair out looking at this. He pre-meditates a reverse swat or rather a reverse slog. Malinda shapes for the fatal hit and shows his ace early, way before Ashwin delivered the ball. The bowler spotted it, fired it flatter and quicker and hit the leg stump. Why abandon the defence when it's your strength? Only Malinda knows why he did that. It looked very, very ugly, that reverse - one of the genuine contenders for the worst shot ever"
"slower offbreak, turns in, catches the thigh pad. <strong>Turn and bounce</strong>"
"edged past the right of a diving Rahane at slip. Cracking <strong>Carrom ball</strong>, Chandimal does not pick the variation. This drifts in on middle, curves away. Squares up Chandimal, grazes the outside edge and, streaks away. He was aiming a leg-side shot and got away"

"<strong>edged again and this carries to Rahane at first slip</strong>! Jadeja is more relieved than pumped. It's Kohli who's pumped. On a good length, this slides in from around the wicket and turns away outside off. Chandimal presses forward and unwisely jabs at the ball with hard hands. Rahane dives to his right to snaffle this low catch. Excellent grab"
"<strong>ripping turn and bounce</strong>! Darted in from wide of the crease, jumps from a length and breaks away past the bat, opening up Mathews. It wasn't too far away from the off stump"

"short and darted into the pads, back-foot punch through midwicket"
meets a full dart under his eyes and clips it to midwicket
"shapes for the sweep, perhaps, with the line wider outside off. But the trajectory is flatter and so he only has the time to play with a straight bat"
"<b>the back leg saves him</b>! Ooof. That was close. An ill-advised reverse sweep, to a quick, flat, good length ball outside off, takes the bottom edge and deflects off his body towards safety"

"wide of the crease, bouncer, angled in on leg stump, Dimuth comfortably ducks under it"

spots the full and wide delivery and lays his bat down like a ramp for it to deflect over to square leg

"picks the shortish length, rocks back and whips the ball from off stump to deep square leg"
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
<b>naaaiice</b>. It's the cutter - the one that got the other centurion of this innings - but Karunarante realises it's wide of off stump and avoids it
"another cutter and it takes off! Having moved around the wicket, he makes Karunaratne play at a back of a length delivery outside off stump. The change in angle <b>nearly does him in</b>"
"full on middle and leg, at 140 kph, Karunaratne clips it to deep square leg"

"waits and waits to see if this good length ball will threaten his stumps - it does - and so with the quick hands you'd expect from a batsman batting past hundred, he deals with it"
works the angle into him from around the wicket as he flicks through to deep square leg
"half an appeal for lbw, because Mathews moves right across in front of the stumps to take the offcutter flush in the space between the pad and the thigh pad. That hurt"
"shapes for the cut because of the length behind short, but since it is the offcutter, it bites into the pitch and comes off the pitch a lot slower. Mathews adjusts and dabs through cover"
"wants the sweep, seeing the line outside off, but Jadeja's too quick and it can only be dealt with a straight bat"
props himself up right in front of the stumps like a hockey goalkeeper and clips the short ball behind square leg
"comes down the track for a clip through midwicket, but he can't get bat to it"
"<b>takes off like a rocket</b> and even Karunaratne is unable to best it. A perfectly good length ball on middle suddenly becomes the stuff of NASA's dreams as it soars up, takes the batsman's gloves and settles safely in the hands of Rahane, having run a little way behind the wicketkeeper. Cruel end to an innings of great quality, and that qualifty is reinforced by the fact most of India's close-in fielders run over to Karunaratne to shake his hand and his team-mate Mathews runs up to shake his hand before he leaves"
races down the pitch straight away to block a full delivery fired in on middle
nudges a good length ball between short leg and leg gully
shifts back in front of off stump to defend a shortish offcutter. Goes off the toe-end towards backward short leg

"pushes at a fuller delivery outside off, but checks his shot so that it goes to short cover on the bounce. Pandya chirps at Dickwella, who just smiles back"

"flirts with a back of a length delivery outside off, and is beaten"

dcarves it past point's right. There's dreadful risk driving on the up on this pitch that's throwing up puffs of dust by the dozen
"shapes to cut at a short ball, but it turns too far past him. Wriddhiman Saha does excellently to stay low enough to collect it"
"<b>caught behind</b>! Saha has been legendary behind the stumps, and he establishes that fact with this catch. Mathews is playing a cut. A full-blooded cut. And he gets a top-edge. A sizeable top edge. But Saha is right there, climbing with the ball, eyes on it. His hands move up high over his shoulder and the ball sticks in the edge of his gloves. Superb work."
blocks a full delivery on middle and off
keeps out a pitched up delivery on middle
"<b>dropped</b> - only because he got a hand to it. Really tough chance, and it ends up on the conscience of  Kohli at gully. Jadeja lures the batsman into an on-the-up drive and Perera obliges. The ball comes off the edge, has decent pace behind it, he he has very little time to react. Gets one hand to it, but the problem perhaps is his first step, moving to his right."
"fuller delivery on middle and off, Dickwella defends inside the line, gets a little leading edge as the cutter deviates off the pitch"
defends a fuller ball on middle
"slower ball, beds into the pitch and comes up so reluctantly. Perera deals with it like most parents do with their kids at 9 am"

"sweeps the length ball on leg stump, regardless of the dust erupting from the pitch like my father's temper when he catches me in the liquor cabinet"
defends a full delivery just outside off
"that's not on! If you have to step down the track to Jadeja, you don't do it early. Perera learns the lesson in the hardest way possible as he leaves the crease, gets a quick, ripping delivery that beats his outside edge by a mile and goes to the waiting Saha who is perfectly brilliant"
"slides in flatter and quicker, Dhananjaya has a short stride and defends"
"slides in from around the wicket, darted on off and bursts past the bat. The batsman did well not to jab at the ball. You can play inside the line. That's all you can do"
"another flat dart from the Jadeja pop gun, this lands on off, Dhananjaya squeezes it out"

"darted shorter and wide outside off, De Silva rocks back and cuts it firmly through point. Good luck stopping that"

"Dickwella shuffles across off even before Pandya delivers, <strong>exposes leg and middle stumps</strong>. Pandya looks to shatter it. Slings it further down leg instead"

"short and bounces outside off, beats the cut"
"pushed through on the stumps, defended"
"Has Rahane pocketed another low catch? The TV umpire has been called in. The soft signal from on-field umpire Oxenford is out. Brushes the glove and dies on Rahane. He bends low with it at slip. Umpire Illingworth says 'seems like he has his hands underneath the ball'. Yes, Rahane has his hands nice and low, and that's where the ball landed. Flat dart from Jadeja, slides in outside off, turns slightly and bounces sharply. Great grab from Rahane, and another five-wicket haul for Jadeja"

Dhawan, who set up the series for India with a breakneck 190, fittingly sews up the series. He settles under this skier at mid-on and slaps the thigh"
