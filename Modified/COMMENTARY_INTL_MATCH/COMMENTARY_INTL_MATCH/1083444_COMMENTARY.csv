"huge appeal for lbw, given by umpire Aleem Dar and the batsman opts for the review. Only question here is impact. And there is a huge inside edge, seems like. Decision has to be overturned.

comes forward and defends this fuller ball hard into the ground before it goes to the hands of the fielder at short cover
"exquisite cover drive, well wide of the cover fielder. But full marks to Suranga Lakmal for not giving up on the chase. Slides and pulls it back before the sweeper cover boundary. But unfortunately for him, it's all in vain as his elbow has made contact with the boundary ropes as he is pulling it back. Or has it? Touch and go. No, in fact, the fielder has got the benefit of the doubt"
"forward push, inside edges it to the pad"
that seems plumb and yes it's gone. Captain tells him he is gone and he has to walk back. So Bangladesh lose a wicket right after avoiding the follow-on. Perera comes from around the wicket and bowls this on a length. Mehedi hangs back and tries to defend but the ball is fired quicker and raps him on the pad. Seemed like a goner from the time he was struck
"oh, gone. Or, no! Erasmus does not seem to be moved. They are contemplating reviewing it and they go for it. Was there bat involved? No inside edge there. It was pushed through on leg stump line and the left-hander comes forward and expects it to turn. Just that it does not and comes on with the arm and beats the inside edge to strike him on the pad. Question is if the angle would have taken it down leg. This might be umpire's call. The angle would have taken it just enough to hit leg stump on the full. Three reds and that ends up being a superb review. <b>Perera on a hat-trick.</b>"
"oh, misses the outside edge by inches. Pushed across the right-hander from around the stumps and the batsman comes forward and sticks his bat out. The drift takes the ball away from him and it does not spin back in, leaving the batsman searching for it. They contemplate another review just for a second but decide against it. Mighty close"

"oh, bowled him. That's a pretty poor dismissal to end a fine innings. But he had to take the chance to try and farm the strike. Comes down the track and leaves a daylight between bat and pad. The ball slides in with the arm, goes between the gap and takes out his stumps"
"outside edge past slip. It is pulled back before the boundary and it is a long chase for the fielder. And just like that, Mustafizur has doubled his Test tally"

"belated appeal from Shakib for caught behind. Sees the keeper go up and then makes an appeal. Marais Erasmus is unmoved, but Mushfiqur Rahim has opted for a review. It is sliding in with the arm and pitches on leg stump channel. Mendis gets down to sweep but the ball straightens after pitching and it is anyway not full enough to sweep. The question is if he has got a glove to it as he misses with the sweep and the ball goes to the wicketkeeper. Not an easy call for the third umpire. Seems like the ball has snuck from beneath the under edge but it really is touch and go. TV umpire asks for a clean audio in slow-mo and there does not seem to be any noise as the ball goes to the keeper. No conclusive evidence to say the ball has touched the bat, says S Ravi, so the on-field call remains"

"bit uppish as he tucks this into the leg side, held up a little bit but the ball lands short of the fielder at midwicket. Well short"

"full and a tad closer to the batsman this time around, Tharanga is solid in defence as he knocks the ball off the front foot back to the bowler"
first signs of urgency from the batsman.The clouds are beginning to close in quite quickly. Looking to hit it on the up straight down the ground but there is no real pace on the delivery and he gets the timing all wrong as well. It lands just in front of mid-off who is running back
offers up width outside off with a fullish ball and it is easy pickings for Tharanga who leans forward and crunches an uppish drive through the covers region

"flighted and loopy, sliding in with the arm on middle and leg. Mendis tries to slog again but unlike the earlier shot, this time he does not have as much room. Lofts it well but only as far as the fielder guarding the square leg boundary as the ball goes straight down his throat"

"short of a length, he has to back away and manufacture room as it does not spin much, punched to extra cover"

"gets across a long way outside off and misses with the sweep as the bowler takes it down leg. Misses the sweep and the ball misses leg stump.

"appeal for lbw, turned down. Gets down to reverse sweep and misses. Gets struck on the pad. Mushfiqur has to run in from a long way to consult with the bowler and go for the review. It's a tossed up ball and sliding in. The drift takes the ball past the bottom of the bat as he is looking to reverse it but the question is wher ehas it struck him. No bat involved. The ball has spun some distance and there is also the drift to take into account. And it will only clip the stump, so on-field call remains"

"flighted outside off, comes forward and blocks off the outer part of the bat into the off side"
"and another soft dismissal. And there is the record. <b>Rangana Herath has surpassed Daniel Vettori to become the most successful left-arm spinner in Test cricket.</b> He is mobbed but his team-mates and what a moment for Sri Lanka cricket. Coming to the delivery, it was nicely flighted by Herath and Das looks to slog it big over the leg side.

"pitched up outside off, pushed off the front foot towards mid-off and they take off for an ill-advised single. Lakmal is slightly slow in getting off the blocks. Nonetheless, he manages to fire a direct hit at the non-striker's end but the batsman has made his ground. The feet are in the air but the bat is firmly planted into the ground. He bends forward and drags it over the crease"

shuffles back and taps this ball to short leg

defended back to the bowler
gets in position to tuck it away as he gets across but the ball spins the other way and sharply and he lets it go late. Taskin has no clue about that and he indicates as much with a wry smile
""
goes after a wide delivery and tries to force it through the off side. No where near the pitch of it and gets beaten
signalled byes. Seemed like an inside edge for a moment. Taskin was looking to force it through the off side and the ball dips and keeps a bit low. It's the wrong'un and the ball misses the bat and goes to the fine leg region after missing the keeper as well
"moves across again and this one spins a mile into him the other way and the ball misses leg stump. Again, no clue how that one turns"

defended off the front foot back to the bowler
"slider, drifting away outside off and goes past the outside edge of Mehedi who tries to defend"

"length ball, spinning in from middle and off, defended to short leg"
"slog sweep and gone all the way for six. Pitched up and right in the slot for Mehedi, who hits it with the breeze and dispatches it over deep square leg"

"defended off the front foot, off the outer part of the bat to covers"
comes forward and blocks it towards mid-off
"pitched up on off, clipped away to midwicket"
five-wicket haul for Herath. For the 23rd time in Sri Lanka. Mustafizur expects this one to spin in a lot more and is playing for the turn. But the ball drifts in from outside off and goes on to beat the outside edge and uproot off-stump
"pitched up on off, defended off the front foot to the off side"
backs away and leaves a wide gap between bat and pad as he defends this one back to the bowler

comes on to the front foot and defends to mid-off
plats the front foot right across and defends
whipped away off the backfoot to mid-on who is slightly deep
defended from the crease into the off side
"was that a drop? Did it carry? Very, very tough chance, though. Subashis was forward defending and gets a thick inside edge that flies to the left of short leg who gets down but the ball is coming to him real quick and he cannot hold on to it. Great effort"
driven out to sweeper cover
shuffles across and defends down the pitch off the backfoot
pitched up wider outside off and it is crunched out to sweeper cover. Does not take the single again
defended off the inside part of the blade to short leg
defends it off the front foot and the ball takes late turn to go off the outside edge towards the cordon
"tucked off the pads to the left of square leg, gets it between him and the midwicket fielder for a good single. Will keep the strike."
stays in the crease and defends down the pitch
defended to the left of the bowler from the crease
drifting away outside off and he looks for an almighty drive but the ball spins in to beat the bat and that's a good stop from the keeper
keeps it out into the off side from the crease
tucked off the pads between midwicket and square leg and just one ball for the tailender to survive
and he survives the one ball. Pushed to silly point from the crease who collects it and throws it back to the keeper
comes forward and defends to covers
"chips it to mid-off and that's the end of it. Six for Herath and Sri Lanka take a 1-0 lead in the series. Flighted and drifting in from outside off. Given the drift, he cannot make good connection and he was also not to the pitch of the ball. Harmlessly sends it into the hands of mid-off and that will be it"
