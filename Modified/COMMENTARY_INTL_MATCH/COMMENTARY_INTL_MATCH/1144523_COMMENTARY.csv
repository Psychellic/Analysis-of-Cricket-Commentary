opens the face for a dab into the off side
flicked outside off ... <B>was that a drop?</B> Sounded like two noises as it clanged off the gloves. Never a real chance to react if it was...

forward and into the covers
"<B>back-to-back hundreds from Jonny Bairstow!</B> Stunning resolve from England's opening batsman. This one was on the pads once more, tucked square with good timing, into the gap, and it rolled inexorably to the rope."
"short, down the leg side and <strong>Root has been given out!</strong> He flapped into a pull, appeared to feather an edge, and yet he has <B>reviewed</B>... so, the bat was adjacent as the ball flew by ... and <B>there's a murmur on Snicko</B>... it's not a spike as such, but it's enough to send him on his way! Root seems bemused, but the evidence upheld the onfield call."

"131kph, short and wide, he cuts through point, the man on the rope has to move to his left, Bairstow takes on the throw and beats it"

"shorter length, he punches off the back foot but mistimes"
"good length, on off, he pushes off the front foot back to the bowler"
<strong>caught at mid off!</strong> This is a horrible miscue from Buttler. He clothed this drive and it floated to the Williamson on the circle! It was up and he decided to try and hit through the line but just mistimed it completely. Not sure if it was a cutter that held in the surface. Didn't appear to be. Boult was ecstatic.

"full outside off, he drives to long off"
"<strong>brilliant catch from Santner at cover!</strong> A slower ball off cutter does the trick. It was full outside off, held in the surface, he checks a drive head high at cover, Santner is close, he moves left initially and then flings his hands up to his right and clings on falling backwards. Super catch. Good piece of bowling."

"117kph, high short slower bouncer, he plays a tennis smash type pull behind square, the sweeper runs in to cut off two"
"130kph, full outside off, he's smearing a drive to cover on the circle and they pinch one"
"131kph, full on off, he sits back and heaves this down to long on along the ground"
"<strong>outstanding yorker cannons into leg stump!</strong> This was the perfect yorker. Tailing in late, he tried to give room but it sneaked under the bat and slammed into the base of leg. Not much Rashid could do"
"another full inswinging yorker, not quite as full, he swings hard and drives it down to long on"
"full inswinger, he swings hard and gets it into the gap at wide long on, they push for two to get Plunkett back on strike and Archer beats the throw! They check upstairs but he was in easily"
"low full toss, he clears the front leg and heaves this away to deep square leg and they only get one"
"outside off, curling away, left alone from just back of a length"
"pushed back into the crease, nice tight lines to open his account. Blocked into the off side"
"swinging past the hip, New Zealand are up and running"
"full and straight, Guptill jams his bat down to dig it out"
"tap and go, into the off side and through they scamper"
"pinned on the pad-flap and <strong>the finger is up before the appeal is out!</strong> No messing from Woakes, or Umpire Ravi. He was back on the crease, hit him above the knee-roll on an off-stump line... might have been clipping, but golly!"
"pushed right back onto the crease, defended in front of off stump. That's an agenda-setting over from Woakes, once more!"
skimming into the pads from back of a length
"tentatively forward, a jittery inside-edge into the pads"
"through to the keeper, left alone"
"<B>short and sharp!</B> Guptill limbos inside the line, as Archer bends his back for the first time today"
"back on a full length outside off, through to the keeper"
"on the pads, nurdled square, another single to the cause"
"lovely wheels from Woakes, fully greased as Williamson takes a sighter outside off"
"attacking the off stump, pushed into the off side"
"nipping back off the seam, and thuds the knee-roll"
"fenced out to the off side, off the back foot"
"beautifully placed, out through the gap in the covers, rising onto the toes to ease an open-faced drive to the brink of the rope"
"back of a length, hitting the deck hard on an arrow-straight line. Blocked down into the crease"
"blocked off the back foot, just a regulation 90mph dot ball"
"full length, tight line, Williamson leans forward, head over the ball to defend back to the bowler"
"this is fine disciplined new-ball bowling. Line, length, a bit of pace, and no width. Defended once more"
"<B>sharpt</B> Williamson drops the hands and sways inside the line as Archer drags his length back. Not so much a bouncer as a lifter, passing the chest at a brisk pace!"
pushing 150kph this time as Williamson lets another sail by
"completes the maiden over with another lifter, just back of a length, poked to the off side with a bottom-handed jab"
"nurdled to Plunkett on the leg side, who <B>whistles in a tight shy that misses by a whisker</B>"
"punched off the back foot, rising to meet the tight line once again. Seven dots in a row to the skipper..."
"an open-faced dab, right under the nose outside off, one of Williamson's standard release shots, and eludes the two slips"
"<B>solid and emphatic!</B> Big stride, perpendicular bat, thumped so straight back down the pitch, it's a mystery how it skimmed past the non-striker's stumps. Held the pose for good measure too. Top marks"
props forward for a block to cover
"nudged to the leg side as Woakes tails one into the pads, clipped gently to midwicket"
"rising on off stump, another trademark dab to third man to keep his innings moving"
"<B>utterly sensational from Buttler!</B> That was a fat glance down the leg side, taking a deflection off the glove, but Buttler's footwork was already on the march, a cartwheeling take, stretching fully to his left and clinging on in a single glove! Archer's pace forced the error, even when his line was awry, and New Zealand's opening issues get them deep in trouble once again"
bashed with firm footwork into the covers
eased down to mid-off
"lovely languid pace from Archer once again, 89mph this time, but a tight line to the body, back of a length, Williamson has to drop his hands and let it sail by"
"<strong>flashed up and over the slips!</strong> To be fair, he played that well, guiding it wide of the cordon, but short of third man. But it goes to show how limited the scoring options are right now ..."
"back and across, to defend on the back foot"
"poked into the off side once more, so little to work with"
"trying to force something more extravagant through the covers, but even when rising onto the toes on contact, there's no way through the covers"
"banging out that tidy line and length once again, a click of bat as Williamson pushes firmly into the covers again"
"<B>nurdled to perfection!</B> Right back on the stumps, opens the face on impact, and threads a low nick, quite deliberately between keeper and slip!"
closes the face on impact this time to work the ball back up the pitch. Slim pickings!
"blocked with a full face, on the back foot. Straight back to the bowler"
"pressed into the covers, line and length to the fore"
"squared up in defence, on the back foot, cover is back in business to tidy up"
"<strong>bouncer, and a brisk one too!</strong> Wide of off stump, so Taylor is lured into the pull, but at 91mph, it's through him before his bat arrives"
"defended on the back foot, so tight to the off stump"
"just a nugget of width, and a grateful slash to third man, rolling the wrists to take it past point"
"aggressive lines from Woakes, bending back into the off stump from a slightly wider line, and defended once more"
"<B>jabbed in the air, and Woakes can't reach it!</B> Squared up on his pads by one that gripped in the pitch, popped off a leading edge, but died just short of the tumbling bowler"
"fenced to third man, back of a length and a single will suffice"
"solid, <B>quality!</B> Out of the blue, Williamson nails a drive. He's waited, and waited, taken his licks and blocked out several. But all of a sudden, there's one that's fractionally over-pitched, and his perfect placement does the rest"
"whittled into the leg side, finds the gap at deep midwicket"
"stuck in the crease this time, on the back foot and blocked with a lack of footwork"
"flicked off the toes, a decent stop by the diving Rashid"
"<B>belted through the covers!</B> The best stroke of New Zealand's innings, it was a bit of a floaty half-volley, but encouragingly for New Zealand, both Taylor and Williamson remain alive to opportunities"
"hops back to block into the leg side, takes the single as midwicket swoops"
"flicked off the pads again, out to the leg side"
"<B>bangs the glove with a 92mph lifter!</B> Taylor didn't know much about that one, dug into the ribs and flinched in the air past the non-existent short leg"
"<B>wheels from Archer!</B> Bending his back once more, another cobra-like bouncer, spitting over an off-stump line as Taylor sways back"
"back of a length, Taylor hops into line to defend"
stabbed into the off side
"wider line, doesn't come onto the back as expected as Williamson looks rather crestfallen as he fails to time his push into the covers"
"another of Williamson's neutral stabs to third man. Full and under the nose, outside off, an open face and a good eye do the needful"
"attempting something similar, but point is on point to gather this time"
"Taylor borrows the same trick, steering the single to third man"
sliding past the leg stump
"angled down the leg side once again, a thin deflection helps it on its way"
"<B>well played!</B> Outside off, rising sharply, and Williamson takes on the chance, punching an open-faced drive down into the turf and past the sprawling backward point. Despite being stuck in treacle for long periods, his innings is still ticking over ..."
"defended late, underneath the nose, into the leg side"
"defended with conviction, on the back foot"
"attacking line, targetting the off stump, blocked away with firm hands into the covers"
"fuller length, into the toes, tucked with the angle to midwicket. Wood finishes his over better than he started it, and New Zealand's task stiffens once more"
"back of a length, Plunkett always has a sweeper in place on the cover boundary to limit the damage"
"back of a length, closing the face on impact to work it off the hip"
"just a touch of width, cracked hard out to deep point"
driven sweetly out to the sweeper once more
"back of a length, wide line, but that's how Plunkett rolls. Another slash to the square boundary, but gathered by the sweeper again"
"back of a length, so hard to line him up in this period. Williamson hops across to defend on off stump"
"back of a length, seems to skid a touch as Taylor defends his stumps with a very straight blade"
"eased to the leg side, picking off the tight line into the legs"
tucked to square leg
"nudged down to third man, brief excitement as Buttler's relay shy pings the non-striker's stumps, but Williamson is safely home"
"a flash outside off, another single to third man. Slim pickings ..."
"angled into the pads, tapped to mid-on"
"outside off, a slashing chop to a wide line, skids under the blade and through to the keeper"
angled to third man
fully forward and drilled to cover
punched into the covers
"opens the face for another dab to third man, picking off the wide line outside off"
"fuller, and dipping into the pads ... deflected behind square for the single"
"punched back down the pitch, and <strong>Wood is appealing for the run-out!</strong> Wow, this would be massive ... was Williamson out of his crease. Yep, there's a<strong> clear fingertip </strong>on the ball as Wood stretched across the crease... and Williamson is nowhere to be seen! This will be OUT! Wood sucks his finger in celebration as the Big Screen confirms it!"
"good length, nipping away a touch, he spars at it outside off and misses"
"<strong>Superb pull shot forward of square and Bairstow can't make the save!</strong> 143kph, high bouncer, he did well to hit it down well infront of square and the timing was excellent"
"143kph, good length, fourth stump line, he chops down on it to get it to backward point"
"angled into leg stump, he works this neatly behind square"

"132kph, good length, outside off, he tries to run to third man but can't beat the backward point who is tight"
"fuller on off, he drives nicely but straight to cover"
"<strong>Taylor has run himself out! Crazy!</strong> He glanced this to fine leg and decided to take on a risky second. The throw from Rashid was on the money, Buttler didn't have to do much and Taylor diving at full stretch was well short. The third umpire only needed one replay to see that. No idea why Taylor took that on."
"132kph, full outside off, he squeezes this to backward point"
"fuller on leg, he glances this behind square but just one"
"tossed up on off, he leans forward and defends"

"tossed up, on off, he drives firmly to long off"

"darted into leg, he's cramped going back to defend"
"drifting into leg stump, he defends this towards midwicket for a single"

"tossed up on off, he drives back to the bowler"
"tossed up again, he yorks himself trying to drive to cover"
"shorter length, he's back and pulling powerfully to deep midwicket but can't find the gap"
<strong>short and wide and he cuts nicely past backward point!</strong> Bad ball and Neesham is back and placing this past backward point. 100 comes up

"short on the hip, he tucks this to fine leg easily"

"back of a length, 144kph, he defends from the crease to gully"
"angled into the pads, it pitched outside leg, it comes off thigh pad and rolls to midwicket for a leg bye"
"141kph, short into the ribs, he clips this away behind square into the gap, well placed"

"good length, 130kph, on leg, he defends from the crease"
"short on leg stump, he's back and working this through square leg"
"<strong>classical cover drive on the rise and Root can't save this one!</strong> Supreme timing to hit this on the up through extra cover. Root got to it but couldn't make the save as he was diving towards the rope, he parried it onto the boundary"
"good length on leg, he clips this neatly but straight to midwicket"
"<strong>chopped on!</strong> Change of angle works! It was back of a length outside off but sliding in and staying a touch low, he tried to cut but it came off the inside edge and cannoned onto the stumps! The crowd loved that"
"146kph, good length angled in, it catches him on the thigh guard, beaten for pace"
<strong>beaten outside off</strong> trying to drive off the back foot. That was too quick for de Grandhomme
"145kph, he mistimes a drive back past the bowler who can't field because he's fallen over, de Grandhomme takes a tight one. It should have been easy but he was touch slow to get going"

"148kph, back of a length on off, he defends from the crease"
"132kph, angled down leg and it comes off the pad on the way through to Buttler. England appeal but it was half hearted"

nudged to the leg side
taps the single to long-off
"a bottom-handed bludgeon, out through extra cover, and <strong>Bairstow's despairing dive can't cut that off!</strong> He rakes a moment after landing, and may have jarred his shoulder there... honestly, commitment is one thing, but England might have bigger issues if their key players get injuries"
defended once again
patted back down the pitch
"banged in short, hopping down the leg side, a floppy paddle-pull, a wafer-thin edge, and the simplest of takes for Buttler! The slower ball suckered the set batsman completely, and that is officially curtains"

"dragged out of his crease, off come the bails<strong>, is this it?Yes it is! </strong> Beaten by another big turner. The back foot stretches back, but too late. <B>England are into the semi-finals of the World Cup!</B>"
