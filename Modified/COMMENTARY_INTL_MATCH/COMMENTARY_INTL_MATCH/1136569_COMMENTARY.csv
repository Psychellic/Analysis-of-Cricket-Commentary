past Gambhir's right this time at mid-off. No swing at all for Boult. It's full outside off and a gentle loosener for Suryakumar to drive easily. Drilled.

slightly shorter and Lewis reads the length very quickly. He stays back and pulls over square leg. Too short.
"did he play a shot? Back of a length down leg, Lewis thinks of playing but bails out of the stroke. The ball ricochets down to fine leg off the pad. The umpire thinks there was a shot."
"<b>extremely sloppy from Daredevils</b>. A bad bad start. Flat down leg, worked away to wide mid-on. Maxwell dives to his left but falls over the ball and concedes four."

"darts this one on outside off, pushed away to mid-off"
"Boult stops the four! He's running back from short fine leg and just about gets there. That was a sensational effort. A flat delivery on middle and leg, Lewis gets a thick leading edge on his sweep, the top edge lobs in the air over fine leg. He races back, the ball is just beyond his reach and he pulls the ball back in despite losing balance."
"a nod of appreciation from Rohit. It's too full again and Suryakumar nails his drive right back, a lovely, languid drive past mid-off's right"
"brings back the length slightly, shorter and wide outside off, cut away to extra cover."
"four more! Back of a length outside off, Suryakumar improvises a late upper cut despite taking his eyes off the ball very early. Somehow he got his periscope of a bat up and ramped the ball over."

"bunted for six! On a length on middle and off, Lewis watches the ball late and then just chips the ball with all his muscular prowess over mid-on. Way over for six."

"Maxwell gets to this, on middle and leg, worked away to wide mid-on. Maxwell dives to his right and stops the ball."
"this is tripe! Filth from Nadeem. Short down leg, Lewis rocks back and pulls that easily and gleefully over square leg for a humongous six. <b>Mumbai's fastest IPL fifty</b>. An appalling start from Daredevils."

"slightly better, short outside off, bunted back to the bowler."
"flat around middle and leg, pushed back to the bowler this time."
"this is more filth. Short down leg, would you want the ball anything else? Suryakumar helps that along over fine leg for six. Just uses that pace and erroneous line."

"well bowled, a full delivery around off, driven to cover"
"on the bounce to mid-off. A low full toss is bunted to the fielder at mid-off, Maxwell"
"another low full toss on the pads, that's another poor delivery. Suryakumar works the ball elegantly but finds midwicket. Timing is awesome but placement isn't."
"137 kph, more rubbish from Daredevils. Another low full toss down leg, flicked away easily to deep midwicket. He didn't learn from the previous error."

"given! Tewatia strikes. Suryakumar has been given out lbw, <strong>will he review?</strong> Yes. He wants to check, did it pitch outside leg? No. Did it slide past leg? Was there some glove? There was no immediate review from Suryakumar, so he didn't think so. There's a thin spike on UltraEdge. HawkEye shows the ball is just clipping the side of leg stump. So Mumbai keep their review, but lose Suryakumar. He was looking for a sweep through square leg, but missed the ball. It pitched on leg and slid on."

"comes running down, gets underneath the length and slogs the ball neatly over midwicket for six more."
"back of a length and angling in on leg, flicked through midwicket"

fails to get entirely on top of this short one and pulls unconvincingly to midwicket
"and finally Rohit gets a move too. Got some catching up to do with the rest of his mates, the Mumbai captain. On this occasion, he makes use of Christian's angle as he bangs one into the batsman and Rohit swivels and helps it along to the fine leg boundary"
"if you want to know about placement, look at that. Kishan simply gets on top of a short of a length delivery by using the depth of the crease and opens the face to run it straight between short third man and keeper"
tries to pull off an encore there but this time he finds the short third man fielder
another shot to the same fielder but the intent was a lot different on this occasion. He reached out to a widish length ball and threw hard hands looking to force it through the off side

"127 kph, looking for the reverse-hit! A full toss on middle and leg, the friendlies of deliveries to swing into the leg side, but he premeditated that shot. He can't make contact with that high full toss and the ball connects with the stump."
"a first-ball duck for Pollard. He comes down, looking to work the ball into the leg side. But he walks far across while looking to find his first run. The ball, a nothing delivery on off, clips the back of his front pad and then ricochets into the off stump. Not been a great start to the IPL for Pollard."

"a full delivery outside off, Krunal gets right across and uses his bottom hand to whip the ball towards wide long-on for a single."
"a low full toss outside off, carved away in front of extra cover for two. There are three men inside the circle on the off side, so he uses that wrist to slice the ball."
"Roy takes the catch to dismiss Rohit. A slower delivery outside off, Rohit gets under the ball and slices the ball towards mid-off. Not enough timing, not enough power, the only two not-enoughs-of you need at the Wankhede."

It's a good-length delivery outside off, Krunal gets right across and works the ball into his pad, and then to short fine leg. Big inside edge and that decision should be out. A successful review, can make a big difference to the total. Was looking for the ramp over short fine leg, but insufficient contact to beat his thigh."

"back of a length outside off, Roy stands tall again and smashes a punchy drive to that deep cover. 145 kph, says the speed gun."
"a big appeal. No. Pad says the umpire. Mumbai agree. Gambhir isn't unhappy. So seems like the right decision. Full down leg, Gambhir misses a flick. Clips the pad."
"that's a poor ball. Good length down leg, worked away easily through backward square leg for four. Pandya is not happy with that finish, his fault though."
"flat outside off, punched to mid-off from the back foot."

"<strong>chipped over the bowler</strong>! A cutter on middle and leg, Mustafizur's length is good too. Roy looks to turn the ball away but the ball splices over"
"good stop by Pollard. Full and wide outside off, carved away to mid-off's right. Pollard dives away and saves three to prevent a boundary"

"full and wide, an offcutter, driven to deep cover for one."
"massive. A slower ball again from Hardik, it's right in the slot. Lofted cleanly and sweetly over long-on."
"six more! That is humongous. Back of a length on middle and leg, Roy watches the ball onto his pull and goes bosh over square leg."
"hammered for four more. A slower delivery around off, beaten with immense power right over the bowler. These slower ones are not working to Roy. 21 off five"
"a wide yorker outside off, jammed out to cover"

"under-edged? A flat delivery outside off, Roy looks for the cut, the ball beats the keeper en route to short fine leg."
"<strong>sensational catch by Hardik Pandya</strong>, off his bro's bowling. A slower delivery outside off, the ball is flighted and loopy. The ball spins away but Maxwell can't back down from his hit over cover. But because of that spin, the ball skews away off the outside half. Hardik runs around to his left, keeps his eyes on the ball and dives full length to get both hands on the ball to clasp the ball. But he doesn't let go of the ball even as his body and arm and shoulder hits the ground. Terrific catch."

"<b>smashed for four</b>! Full and wide from Mustafizur, it's not a bad option but it's slow because he's looking for the cutter. With that length, it won't cut. Drilled over cover for four."
"<strong>and that's the game!</strong> Gambhir is pumped. Mumbai are despondent. What an inning sfrom Roy, it's the same shot that Jadhav played to get six in game 1. A full delivery on middle and leg, flicked away over fine leg for six. Such power in those wrists."
