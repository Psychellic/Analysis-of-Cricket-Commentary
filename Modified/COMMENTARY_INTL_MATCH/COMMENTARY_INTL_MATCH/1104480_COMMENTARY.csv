"back of a length, slight shape away from the corridor, left alone"
"length ball on the pads, looks to swing it out from there, but this goes straight through. Tucked to fine leg off the front foot"
"full and slightly outside off, solidly behind to push it into the covers"
"back of a length outside off stump, no swing, skids through and takes the toe-end of the bat as he defends on the up"
"full, middle stump, brings the bat down straight and offers the full face as he defends"
"good length at middle stump, puts in a half stride and pokes this into the leg side with soft hands, beats mid-on for speed comfortably for the single"
"drops it marginally short of a length, and Mire is on top of this quickly. Drags it from outside off stump and pulls past square leg. Gets it off the sticker, but this rolls away as mid-on joins the chase"
"full at off stump, defended back down the pitch. Very late on that, no feet"
"crunched. Short and wide outside off stump, doesn't quite climb on him, but it's nicely in the slot and he only has to get a swing at this. Through the line, on the up, through cover point"
"back of a length in the corridor, covers the line and taps it towards point with soft hands. Direct hit on the diving underarm flick, but Mire was in"
"good length, angled in at off stump, defended into the leg side with the angle"
"good length, nips back in from outside off, defended off the back foot"
"nice big stride, cuts out the marginal swing, defends this length ball to mid-off"
"good length, looks like he's rolled his fingers on this delivery just outside off. Another big stride and he pushes on the up to mid-on's left. The fielder dives and parries it to mid-off, gets back up on his feet and finds the umpire's got his hand stretched out to signal <b>no-ball</b>"
"offcutter, floated full at off stump. He waits in his crease but cannot time this drive across the line. Just a single to mid-on"
"good length, outside off stump, solidly defended off the front foot"
"oh beautiful. He's showing the face nicely today. This time, the front foot gets him to the pitch at middle stump, and he punches it past mid-on who can't put in a dive this time"
"good length at leg stump, defended off the front foot"
"length ball down the leg side, shovelled on the up to fine leg"
"back of a length, angled into off stump, pushed on the up to mid-on"
"back of a length in the channel, draws him forward and induces the inside edge. It thuds into the pads and drops in front of the keeper"
"<b>loud appeal</b> but this is going down leg. Pacey, and strikes him hard on the front leg in front of leg stump"
"back of a length, middle stump, pushed to square leg on the up"
"overpitched on off stump, gets the stride in, mistimes the drive to mid-off"
"shot. Back of a length in the corridor, doesn't climb, but it doesn't need to. He's quickly behind to whip this over midwicket"
"loose from Malinga. Gives him a lot of width outside off, length ball, and he just has to connect on the slash to get a four to the cover boundary"
"good length at off stump, solid on the front foot again, defended"
"bouncer. First one of the day. It's on leg stump, Masakadza ducks it comfortably"
"short on leg stump, uses his front foot press to spring up for the bounce, and pull this off his hips. Finds the square leg boundary"
goes for the bouncer. Leg stump stump again and it flies down leg side...not called a wide
"offcutter, good length outside off stump. Doesn't get to the pitch as he whips this using his wrists. It's aerial for a bit, but safely in front of mid-on who tumbles to his right as he fields"
"full and angled into off stump, defended to mid-on with a full face"
"another loud appeal. This one looks closer than the previous one. Good length ball, nips in sharply as he's delivered it from wide of the crease. Strikes him on the leg in front of middle stump. It looked a tad high though. Mathews says no to the review"
"nicely timed, but straight to mid-off. Wide of the crease from Pradeep again, length ball bunted on the up"
"this one isn't nicely timed, but it's good enough to beat mid-on. Anticipating the angle into him now. Picks this length ball from outside off, swats across the line with a turning bat, gets the result"
"short and wide, but with the angle in. Craps him at the last moment as he cuts, beaten"
"good length, angled into the pads, defended on the up to mid-on"
"oh gets away. Short and wide, deserved to be put away, but Masakadza late on the cut and too far under the ball"
"full at off stump, looks to punch this past mid-on but gets the timing wrong. Hits the inside half of the bat and bounces a couple of times before finding Malinga's laboured dive to his left at mid-on"
"overpitched on leg stump, misses out on the flick. Only the bowler appeals. That was going down"
"loose shot. Missed three boundary opportunities this over, he must feel. Tries to club this length ball outside off through the covers, beaten"
"thuds him on the pad again. Chameera's brought in a slight increase in pace, and it's helping him get away with indiscipline. This was another full one on the pad, and he can't get the flick away"
"finally connects. Full, outside off stump, throws his hands at it. Slams it into the turf and bounces it over extra cover"
"good length, middle stump, pushed to mid-on on the up"
"<b>nearly takes off stump</b>. Length ball delivered from wide of the crease, doesn't climb at all. Skids through at shin height as he tries to swing across the line"
"there it is. Gets it right up to the batsman, keeps his line and angle intact. No feet from Mire once more. Plays with an angled bat and he's struck right in front of middle and off. Plumb in front."
"oh nearly gets him out lbw as well. Good length, 140kph, nips it in and raps the pads in front off off stump. But there was an inside edge first"
"founds some rhythm, has Pradeep. Gets this to climb from a length and hit the body as the batsman looks to defend this outside off"
"good length outside off, anxious defence to mid-off on the up"
"glorious. Good length outside off stump. A decent delivery, but he's used the stride so well to get to that. Lovely balance as he dispatches this through wide mid-off on the up"
"back of a length outside off stump, left alone"
"mistimed and skewed, but past mid-on. Full into off stump, the bat turns as he goes for the big drive. That pace is troubling him still"
"back of a length outside off stump, on top of the bounce, punched to mid-off"
"good shot. Middles the on-drive, finds Malinga"
"back of a length in the corridor, watches it closely and taps it late to get it past backward point"
"oh, yes. Pradeep is danger right now. Wide of the crease, hits a length in the corridor, gets it to straighten and climb to take the glove on that forward defence"
"back of a length at off stump, defended on the up"
"delicious. Masakadza won't be bowled to. He knows the angle. Puts a half-stride across, picks this from outside off and lifts it over mid-on with some arrogance"
"good length at middle stump, defended into the leg side off the front foot"
"back of a length outside off stump, stands tall, opens the face and runs it to third man...they nearly collide on the run"
"good length at off stump, half-stride forward to defend into the off side"
"tossed up at leg stump, leans in, drives to long-on"
"drops it short outside off stump, gets smoked. Quickly onto the back foot and this is hammered past midwicket"
"back of a length outside off stump, pushed to mid-off, back foot"
"short and wide this time, chopped out to sweeper cover"
"short at middle stump, back foot punch to long-on"
"wrong'un, dropped very very short. It's outside off stump as he reaches for it and drags it from ankle height. Gets it past midwicket and wide of long-on"
"shot. Tad short outside off stump, expansive cut right off the meat of the bat. But point is on the boundary, it's only one"
"full at off stump, pushed off the bottom of the bat - no feet - straight to mid-off"
"Not. A. Clue. Short of a length, pitches outside off stump, climbs sharply at his shoulder and he's stuck halfway between a pull and a duck. Cops it on his left bicep"
"oh he's nervous. Camps on the back foot, gets a short one into the body, fends at it with one hand"
"back and across early, rides the bounce this time, and tickles it to fine leg"
"full and wide outside off stump, sliced on the up, past point and way to the left of sweeper cover"
"good length, looped outside off stump, front foot defence"
"gives it air again. 78kph. Good length at middle stump, flicked to midwicket"
"pushes it through, back of a length on middle stump. Mistimed pull to midwicket"
"gives it air again, but it's back of a length. It's the wrong'un. He looks to flick this into the leg side and nearly returns a catch off the leading edge"
"short and wide, another wrong'un, too wide"
"back of a length on off stump, punched with the turn, back towards the bowler"
"short at leg stump, pushed through quickly. He's back in the crease for the pull, but can't get connection on it. Not with bat anyway"
"full outside off stump, driven off the bottom of the bat to mid-off"
"good shot. Short and just outside off stump, rides the bounce, keeps the pull down to deep square leg"
"good length outside off stump, shuffles across and defends into the off side off the front foot"
"shuffles across, gets in a good position to face this bouncer. Nails the pull shot from off stump, finds deep square leg"
"slower ball, just wide of off stump on a good length. Opens up his arms to drive through the line, but he's well beaten"
"short, wide, sits up. The ball, that is. Masakadza springs above it, gets his hands free and places this past point"
"floated up, full on middle stump, front leg out of the way to dig it out to long-on"
"good length at leg stump, gets his front leg across and paddles this fine. Long leg has a lot of distance to cover, can't keep it to a single"
"slow, back of a length at middle stump, pushed into the leg side off the back foot"
"full at leg stump, gets low and paddles this too. Connects too well, it'll only be a single but that's his <b>fifty</b>. He would've raised his bat, but he's dropped it on the pitch while running. Streak chuckles in the dressing room"
"full at middle stump, driven to long-on"
"back of a length outside off stump. Down early for the sweep. He knew where he wanted to hit that. Adjusts for the bounce and hits it into the floor, straight to long leg"
"short at leg stump, stands tall and uses the angle to pull this. Aerially. One bounce, to fine leg"
"back of a length outside off stump, stabs at it, gets it down to third man"
"back of a length outside off stump, punched on the up to extra cover"
"awww yessssss. The perfect hook shot. Picks the length early, watches it onto the bat, and rolls the wrist beautifully to find the gap to deep square's right"
"follows it up with a lovely cover drive. Not too much feet, but this was in the slot. Extra cover leaps to his right to deny a boundary"
"good length outside off stump, not great connection on this drive, but it trickles past cover"
"tossed up delivery on leg stump, Musakanda attempts a lap sweep, but misses"
"too short, and Musakanda powers it away through extra cover. There doesn't seem to be much turn for the left-arm wristpinner, and perhaps he's struggling bowling into the wind too. Losing his length."
"tosses it up, now from around the wicket, Musakanda drives to short cover"
"this new angle might just favour Zimbabwe's preferred ploy - the stock ball is spinning into the right-hander, and angled into him too. Musakanda plays a deft little lap sweep"
"back over the wicket to Masakadza, and he still cops it! Overpitched this time from Sandakan and Masakadza unleashes his considerable power. Straight down the ground, and if that ball can talk, it'd be cussing in pain"
"<b>almost does him with the wrong 'un</b>. Perfect length there, coupled with the flight to draw the batsman forward, a batsman who thinks this is turning into him. Masakadza uses half a bat, looking for midwicket. The ball rags past the outside edge."
and perhaps karma is catching up to him. Starts with a terribly short ball and Musakanda hangs back and pummels it over midwicket
"quicker delivery, on off stump, moving in with the angle, or rather with lack of turn. Musakanda, because of the ball being fuller, is unsure what to play and gets an inside edge"
"tries a sweep, but that doesn't work either"
"shortish and outside off, cuts it past point"
slinks back in his crease and carves a shortish delivery to backward point
"now the reverse sweep, which goes well in front of square, to the sweeper to bring up the hundred"
"starts from around the wicket, for a good length ball on off stump. Masakadza defends with an open face to point"
"defends a fuller delivery on leg stump. That'll be his plan. Tucking Masakadza up, never giving him room. Plenty of singles on offer though."
"going for the lap sweep, and so hitting right across the line. Good length ball hits low on the pad, but would have carried past the off stump"
nudges a length ball on leg stump to short midwicket. Masakadza bats with hard hands. That doesn't always work with a bowler like Gunaratne
"that big backlift winds up, but this is a slower ball, and so he has to adjust. Doesn't swing towards midwicket as he was originally looking for and instead chips it over mid-off"
sweeps to long leg to keep strike
"gets it past the left of point. He's rollicking along, and he's bold enough to keep trusting these awkward shots. Sees a full ball on leg stump and meets it on the full with a reverse sweep"
"all power! And so eager is he to show it off that he runs down the track, turns a flighted ball into a full toss and nails it to the long-on boundary. There was a man in the deep, he has no chance"
"tosses it up on leg stump, so much that it becomes a yorker. Masakadza digs it out"
stays beside the flighted ball on middle and leg and drives to the left of mid-off. Good running
"gets forward to block a flighted delivery on off stump, might well have been the googly"
"excellent cricket, he spots the flight on the ball, and the line being outside off, gets low with it and presents a dainty little reverse sweep past backward point's left"
rocks back and cuts to short cover
"good length ball outside off, Masakadza blocks to point"
"full on off stump, drills it down to long-off, trying to hit his way out of trouble. But handling Gunaratne might be easier with softer hands"
"like that. Musakanda tries to tickle a length ball on the pads, gently, towards square leg. Plays a touch too gently that time"
"launches it over wide long-on! That is sensational! He has the fielder in the deep to contend with, and perhaps a bit more problematic would have been the howling wind."
"drives a full delivery down the ground, Gunaratne does well in his followthrough, reaching to his left from around the wicket"
"starts with the offcutter, which is tapped down to long-on, for, would you believe it, two! Musakanda, you little beauty. He makes his senior partner suck it up and run"
"low full toss on off stump, Maskadza pushes it to Mendis, three feet to the right of the pitch"
"singes the blockhole, but Masakadza squeezes it out to cover"
"full and outside off, drives fluently through to deep cover"
"whips one from the base of off stump to mid-on, hitting slightly across the line"
"he keeps looking for the blockhole, and this one becomes a full toss, wobbling away onto leg stump. Musakanda does the needful. Kindly points it to the long leg boundary and sends it on its way on a very happy journey"
"the reverse sweep, possibly premeditated, with the angle of the ball going across him. Gets a little top edge through to deep third man"
and the other guy goes sweep - to a very full ball on off stump - and he just about brings his bat down in time to get an inside edge through midwicket
"that is sooo lovely! For all the cuteness of playing the horizontal bat shots, this is so much more effective. Races down the track and launches a length ball right over mid-off. Hits the rope on the full and that brings up the 100-partnership."
loopy delivery - brave of him to toss it up - Masakadza drives to long-off. <b>He's into the 90s</b>!
"stays back, and with the length being short, he is able to read the googly off the pitch and slice it to point"
rocks back and cuts the short wrong 'un through to deep point
"full on off stump, pushes it to long-on"
"full on off stump, pushes to the left of mid-off"
"works it to the left of short midwicket, making sure the bat face is straight to find the single"
"slower ball, becomes a full toss, which swerves and dips in the air. Musakanda, manages to wait on it, get low and clip it to deep square leg"
"if that's straight onto boot, he's gone lbw, but umpire Gould disagrees. So Mathews opts for<b>a review</b>. Pretty awesome ball, to start things off. A yorker, that <b>reverses</b> into the right-hander, so very late. Said right-hander plays all around it, and might live to do the same again if he has got an inside edge on this. Oh, actually, the swing might well take it down leg. There <i>appears</i> to be no bat. The thing going for Malinga though is it hits the toe on the flush - so from there the ball-tracking will have to go on a straight line. Third umpire Nigel Llong has a decision to make. Hawk-Eye says it's only clipping leg stump, so the one-field umpire's call stands. <b>Not out</b>. And Sri Lanka lose their review"
"pierces the field on the off side. A fine drive to the left of mid-off, the perfect response to something close to a half-volley. Angelo Mathews chases it down, and kind of slips on the boundary as he turns to throw"
"full on off stump, Musakanda plants his front foot forward and blocks"
"huge appeal for the lbw, but the umpire reckons its pitched outside leg. Musakanda plays back to a good length ball and it surprises him by zipping through and pinning him on the knee roll in front of leg stump. While the appeal goes out, Masakadza pinches the leg bye."
seems to pick the wrong 'un as he goes back and punches with a straight bat to cover
"gets it past backward point. The lack of turn, and the angle across him from over the wicket is helping this shot. Good batting. Not looking to hit it too hard, just making sure he gets good contact, and the placement"
"googly, reads it again as he goes back, opens the face and gets a single to the sweeper"
"full on off stump, Musakanda drives, but finds no runs as Sandakan dives to his left and grabs the ball with his strong hand"
drifts down leg - a full toss. Masakadza attempts a glance but misses as the wind howls away. It's actually audible off the stump mic
brings down a straight bat to handle a reverse swinging yorker on off stump
dabs the shortish delivery to the right of point
"looks for the full delivery on middle and leg, looking to make Musakanda play across the line and fall over himself, which he does. Ball pings off the pad to short midwicket"
"full toss on off stump, lifts it to the right of long-on where Chameera puts in a good effort, diving to his right to stop the boundary"
"looks for the leg-stump yorker, Musakanda doesn't get bat to it, but is happy to get his team a leg-bye"
"there it is! With a flick to long leg comes up <b>a hundred for Hamilton</b>! Goes through for the second run and then clutches the Zimbabwe crest on his chest and looks at the dressing room, soaked in pride. It's his fifth ODI hundred, and his first against a team other than Kenya, Afghanistan and Bangladesh"
"tosses it up on off stump, defends"
works a full ball back down the pitch
"backs away to try and open up the off side, but Gunaratne follows him. Without the room he thought he would have, Musakanda picks out short cover"
"heaves it into the wind.... and straight to long-on! He had a fifty for the taking, but in going for quick runs, in trying to keep Sri Lanka under the pump, he's given his wicket away. Good innings - in that he didn't look good at the start, but gutsed it out - comes to an end"
"full on middle and leg, Masakadza goes inside out with a drive to cover"
"full on off stump, defends, and that's the end of another wicket-maiden"
"<b>that's grand</b>, a 142 kph delivery, pitches on a good length and darts away past the outside edge, with the angle across the left-hander. Very little footwork"
blocks a full delivery on middle and off. It's 140 kph this time
"full and outside off, Ervine throws his bat at it and comes up with nothing."
"full and outside off at 143 kph, Ervine sends it to short cover"
"pushes it down the ground, between the non-striker and the stumps for a single"
"shortish on off stump, eases it to short third man"
"lovely drive. People with good hands can handle Gunaratne, and here Ervine shows how, leaning forward to the half-volley and breaking his wrists to make sure he gets the gap between short cover and mid-off"
nudges a ball off middle and leg through to long-on
"full and outside off, Masakadza lashes it to a wide long-off"
"full on off stump, drives to mid-off"
punches a shortish delivery down to long-on
"full on middle stump, Masakadza digs it out"
"full on off stump, drives to mid-off"
"<b>another ripper</b>. The seam is presented upright, the ball is angled across the left-hander, and the wind helps it move past the outside edge as well. Ervine, not moving his feet when the length is good, isn't helping"
"that's better, a good, long stride forward helps him smack the length delivery past short cover's right"
"again, nicely forward, with an open face to slice the back of a length ball through to the sweeper"
"legcutter on off stump, blocks into the covers for a single"
pins him on the pad with a 140 kph delivery that seems to hold its line. Ervine is late into his flick and survives because it might have pitched outside leg.
"fuller delivery on off stump, defends"
"premeditates the reverse sweep, but by making sure he doesn't try to overhit, and by keeping his eyes on the ball always, he picks the gap to the left of backward point. That's hard to do to drag that ball from way outside leg"
clips a shortish delivery away through square leg
rocks back and cuts a short delivery to deep point
works a short delivery off his hips to deep midwicket
"full on middle, defends."
"full and tailing in at leg stump, comfortably pushed to short mid-on"
"good length, cramps him in the mid-riff, pushed to midwicket feebly"
goes for the bouncer but it is too short. Flies a couple of yards over the batsman
"short and wide outside off stump, places the cut to sweeper's left, lazy passage of play, brings two"
"good length at off stump, short stride forward to push and steal a single to mid-off"
"short and wide outside off stump, chops it straight to point. Hasn't looked so confident till this point"
"short and angled across off stump, gets behind the line and cuts into the turf to get it over point but sweeper cover runs to his right and parries it back in"
"<b>finds deep square leg</b> with a lofted sweep. The shot was on. It was full, it was at middle stump, and there was a big gap behind square on the leg side. He took it on, like a man on 111 should. But Pradeep ran nicely to his right, most of it backwards, and composed himself nicely to hold on"
"tossed up at middle stump, driven down the ground, to long-on"
"tossed up at middle stump, driven back at the bowler...who misfields, but recovers quickly to stop the single"
"flighted full outside off stump, toe-ended drive, straight to mid-off"
"good length outside off stump, stretches forward and pokes it to point's left to get off the mark"
<b>big lbw shout</b> but not out says the umpire. Full delivery strikes him in front of leg stump. Wanidu hasn't been turning the ball too much so there's a very small chance it could be spinning down. Not out says the umpire. It might have pitched outside in any case
"good length, drifted in at a good length outside off stump, pushed through the covers off the front foot"
"flighted at off stump, taken on the full, driven to long-off"
"back of a length outside off stump, enough time to hang back and slap it to sweeper"
"good length outside off stump but that is so slow and so loopy, he can punch off the back foot. Mistimes it. Extra cover cleans up"
"full at off stump, reaches the pitch and drives to extra cover...who can't hold on to his right and just deflects it in the end. Into an awkward region behind him at an awkward pace that teases a lot of fielders but allows two"
"<b>how did that miss?!</b> Drifts this in on a good length, it pitches on middle and off and spins away, past the outside edge and inches away from the off stump"
"pushed down leg side, full. He looks to flick and loses balance, but the keeper can't get low enough to stop that very difficult ball"
"shapes like for the reverse sweep, watches the full ball onto his bat at leg stump and tickles it past short third man"
"takes another one on the full, and this time swats it away with the reverse sweep. It runs away quickly but once more, sweeper does well to slide to his right"
"full at middle stump, driven to long-on"
"full outside off stump, nicely middled drive, straight to mid-off"
"goes for the sweep and misses...and the umpire's given it! It strikes him on leg stump and it's very full. Doesn't look out on first glance but it's been given. They have reviewed. This looks like it has marginally pitched in line. It's a slider from the bowler, so it's not spinning down a long way. In slow-mo, I reckon it will be umpire's call. In fact, it's <b>hitting leg stump comfortably.</b> It's not called umpire's call, technically, but the umpire's call was perfect. Good decision."
<b>oh and another close one.</b> There's enough gap for another ground in the jungle as Waller drives away form his body. Ball slides through from a good length and nearly takes off stump

"ah poor ball. Dropped short at off stump, rocks back and slaps it over midwicket"

"good length outside off stump, leans in and pushes it to sweeper cover"
"<b>squeezes it past backward point</b> and converts a tight over into a good one for the batting team. This was overpitched and angled across the batsman from around the wicket.

"tossed up outside off stump, driven to long-off"
"good length at off stump, some spin back into the batsman who plays very late and tentatively pushes it to midwicket"

"googly, pitches full on middle stump and pings the pads as he looks to flick it behind square"
"back of a length at off stump, punched off the back foot to extra cover"
"oh this looks really good! <b>Not out</b> says the umpire. Good length, drifts in and thuds him in front of middle and off as he looks to sweep. Looked plumb to me"
goes for the reverse sweep this time. Gets good bat on it after reaching the pitch outside off. Finds sweeper who is quite square
<b>surely! Surely!</b>  Oh this looks even closer than the previous one. It's basically a yorker that he looks to sweep and misses again. Hits the back leg in front of middle stump.
"good length at leg stump, pushed to long-on on the up"
"good length at leg stump, sweeps, top edges down to long leg"
"enough of the sweeping, he says. Steps out, reaches this loopy one at the pitch and bludgeons it down the ground. Straight to long-off"
"<b>ouch!</b> That'll give you some urgency. Williams steps down again, gets to the pitch outside off stump and absolutely wallops this...only to find his partner on the full at the other end. No casualties, thankfully."
"lovely. Gets to the pitch outside off again, and this time he places it <b>over</b> his partner and beats long-off"
"length on the pads, reaches out and flicks to deep midwicket"
"back of a length at off stump, punched comfortably to sweeper cover"
"good length, pushed through flat at leg stump. Knew the batsman was coming down and adjusted his length. Good bowling, but he shovels this wide of long-on and gets the second"
"backs away, gets a nice overpitched ball on middle stump and chips it over the bowler. That is running away before long-on dives to his left to keep it in"
<b>and another big appeal</b> as he misses the sweep. The right hander this time. Struck in front of middle stump. He's bowling from around so maybe that would have slid through and gone away from off. Or it might have pitched outside leg. Dead in front otherwise
"pushes is through flat, and yorks him in front of middle as he steps out. Just about jams it out to long-on"
"full at leg stump, gets down, laps it to fine leg for a single"
"walks across the stumps, shows all of them and looks to ramps this fine. Questionable choice given Gunaratne's pace, but he's constantly been trying to hit him behind square. This is a good length ball and it crashes into the leg stump"
"oh, beauty. Teases him with a full one outside off stump, draws him into the drive and slides it past the outside edge. He just about manages to keep his back leg in the crease"
"back of a length at leg stump, tucked off his hips to long leg's left"
"reverse swingins yorker first up, aimed for the toes. He watches it very closely and tucks it fine before running back hard. Good cricket, made two against a good ball"
"low full toss on the pads, clipped to deep square leg"
"full outside off stump, looks to push through the off side, but Malinga's trajectory means this hits the inside half of the bat and rolls through the mid-on region"
"yorker, offcutter too. Slides down leg side though"
"full and swinging in towards leg stump, he wants to clip through midwicket, but it moves too quickly. Bunted back to the bowler"
"overpitched, tailing in at off stump. Digs it out to deep extra cover"
"rolls his fingers on the low full toss, gets it at middle stump. Waller walks across to try and flick this behind square. Misses big time. Full toss on the pads in front of middle stump and even in this match, that is out"
"back of a length at middle stump, pushed behind square off the back foot"
"back of a length outside off stump, goes deep in the crease and punches it wide of sweeper cover"
"pushed through at a length outside off...and he gets stunning connection on this. Seemed like an innocuous cover drive as he stretched for this, but he's got it past extra cover and racing away from the diving sweeper"
"...and going down leg. Good length, pitches on leg, turns further away, Dickwella does well"
"good length at middle stump, turns it to short fine with his wrists and takes a single"
"good length outside off stump, dropped to short third man with soft hands"
"premeditated reverse sweep. It's a full toss on leg stump. Might have been a better result without that shot, but it's a single to backward point and there's no changing that now"
"the perfect yorker, on off stump. Gets the bat down, it rolls into the leg side and gets one"
"yorker at leg stump this time, thuds him in the pad, it's a single in the point region"
"tailing full one on the leg side, low full toss in the end as he backs away, flicks to deep midwicket"
"overpitched outside off stump, and he's disappointed to miss out. Malinga's trajectory forced that. Brought down an angled bat and couldn't open up the off side"
"yorker on the toes, pushed straight to short midwicket"
"big, audacious swing at this, but he gets it off the toe. It's a length ball for the taking outside off and he puts a swing through this. Not great connection but mid-off is in. Another over spoiled by a last ball boundary"
"full on the pads, nicely connected sweep, straight to long leg"
"good length, in the slot for the slog sweep on middle stump. He takes the option, misses the ball."
"wow. Superb. This is full and angled in at leg stump, but he gets under this so quickly  that he can bring his hands inside-out on it to make the connection and lift it over long-off. Classy, classy batting"
"<b>creamed!</b> This one is angled in at middle stump, and he gets all of the slog. Clobbers it with the spin, against the wind and over the midwicket boundary"
"can't beat the wind this time. He got good bat on this slog to an overpitched ball on leg stump. But you could see the ball struggling to travel. Hangs and hangs and hangs, then sits neatly in long-on's grasp"
"back of a length outside off, looks to push it it into the leg side but there isn't enough turn. It's pushed back down the pitch...and for some reason, Cremer has run down the pitch. Aimless. Sandakan picks up, runs back, and Cremer has to go for none off none"
"full at off stump, watches it closely and gets to the pitch to steal a single to mid-off and bring Raza on strike"
"backs away, gets followed, and the bowler misses the yorker. It's a juicy full toss and his hoick gets good connection. Bisects deep square and deep midwicket"
"misses length again on the attempted yorker. Low full toss on off stump, Raza has backed away again and drilled this through extra cover. Zimbabwe have <b>300</b>"
"slower ball, back of a length outside off. Backs away and picks it, but he can't make enough power to cut this past sweeper cover"
"yorker at off stump, and once again he has his priorities right. Taps it pitch-side and runs like hell to bring Raza on strike"
<b>what a shot!</b> Incredible stuff from Raza! He's somehow anticipated that slower ball and runs down the pitch. Meets it on the bounce just outside off stump and brings through such a sweet swing. Sends it sailing over long-on
"heyoooooooo! Toldja this is going to be fun. And just to make sure it is, Mumba starts with a loosener. Short, wide, smashed through point"
corrects his line - but back of a length appears his go to - as he keeps Dickwella to a defence
"cramps him up with a shortish deliver that holds its line, and bounces above the midriff. Mumba, at his best with the new ball."
"but the next ball dribbles down leg, with Dickwella's leg glance not quite the siren song as he would hope"
gets up off his toes and clips the shortish delivery to short midwicket. Good bounce from the tall quick
opens the face and guides the back of a length ball to point
"pitches it up, just as a change up, and Dickwella is rather reluctant in coming forward to block. Short man, perhaps worried about the short ball"
nice zip through to the keeper as Chatara hits the deck and angles the ball across the left-hander. Gunathilaka leaves
"full on off stump, blocks with soft hands to point"
"that's risky, but his timing makes it worth moving across onto off stump and hitting across the line of a wicket-to-wicket ball. Four past mid-on's left. That shot isn't entirely necessary at this stage, but it will put Gunathilaka in a good head space"
"moves across again, but with the length being fuller on off stump, he chooses to block"
"defends a pitched-up delivery on off stump, this time keeping his front foot from moving too far across"
offers width and Gunathilaka accepts with great glee. Lunges forward to smoke the ball past mid-off's right.
"lovely bowling. He finds a spot suitably full enough to tempt the drive from Dickwella but since it is still only the third over, the opener's feet aren't moving. And therefore he's beaten"
pushes to the left of cover to pinch a single
"hits high on the bat, and seems to square up the left-hander as Mumba hits the deck and angles a short ball across Gunathilaka"
blocks a good length ball that aims for the top of off stump
swivels on the back foot and pulls it well in front of square leg. Shows how early he picks the length.
and again! He imitates a crazily revolving door and Mumba bowling short and at the body means the ball pings off the bat to the midwicket boundary again
"full and outside off, slices it past point"
"there's not much of a gap between extra cover and cover, but he pierces it anyway, getting on the front foot and flaying his hands through the ball - a perfectly good length ball. And after taking a couple, he asks for some tape to be brought out for his bat, goes right round the middle."
"oh, very well done. They are conscious of preventing Zimbabwe from building any pressure, this time, blocking down the pitch, with soft hands to pinch a single before mid-off could come up"
"exquisite! He has modelled some of his game around Dilshan, and like him plays some sumptuous shots. Half-volley on off stump, whipped over the top of midwicket"
"tentative poke outside off, the shortish length perturbing him"
"backs away to open up the off side, but the bowler follows him, disallowing him the chance to cut past point"
"shortish and outside off, cuts to cover"
"loops it up, nice and slow, on leg stump, Gunathilaka nudges to the left of mid-on"
"drifts down the pads, Dickwella tries to take advantage with a sweep, but has to settle for the extra"
<b>stays low</b> as he pushes the good length ball through on off stump. Dickwella gets a bottom edge as he cuts
presses forward to block a flighted delivery on off stump
clips a full delivery on leg stump to square leg
"nicely done! He lets the ball spin past him, and then dabs an angled bat down to secure a boundary to third man. This is a pretty fabulous start for Sri Lanka. Still only five overs though, so these two need to keep going"
"good length ball, holding its line outside off, Gunathilaka guides it to third man"
"there's the tribute to Dilshan! Steps forward, and down on one knee, and discoops the length ball on middle and off stump over fine leg. If he had missed, his helmet would have taken a pounding!"
"but it's an <b>outside edge</b>, which wanders away to the third man boundary! Mumba puts in a good effort, but can only parry it over. Tough luck on the bowler, who hits the length to pin the batsman in his crease, squares him up with a little seam movement, and still..."
moves back to block a shortish delivery to cover
gently pats it to mid-on for a quick single. Sensible batting.
"slower ball, good thinking from Chatara. Rolls his fingers across it and Gunathilaka is not ready for the offcutter. By the time he adjusts, the ball is ricocheting off his body and lands just in front of him"
"they're not keen on letting any bowler settle. Here Dickwella races down the track, doesn't get to the pitch, so resorts to a defensive push"
nudges a full delivery on leg stump through midwicket
moves back to the flatter delivery on middle and clips it to the left of mid-on
"fuller delivery on off stump, pushes to mid-on and they get the strike rotating again. Zimababwe, worried about the boundaries, have their fielders on the edge of the circle"
works the shortish delivery through to deep square leg to bring up the team's fifty
presses forward to block a flighted delivery on leg stump
nudges it off his hips to long leg
"a touch more bounce, which ensures Dickwella's clip goes off the glove to long leg rather than the middle of the bat to square leg"
"seems like an offcutter on middle, Dickwella works it to short midwicket"
slower ball goes off target - wanders way outside off as Dickwella leaves
"now that's definitely Jayasuriya! He stands up to a short ball and simply, by whirling his wrists, sends it one bounce to the square leg boundary"

"fuller delivery on off stump, Dickwella tries to plant it at midwicket and run, but Raza gets across quickly"

drives a full delivery to the right of the bowler
"back over the wicket, for a shortish delivery that is turned to square leg"
opens the face as he allows the back of the length ball to come to him and takes the single behind point
"slower ball, and Gunathilaka, having set up to play it early, adjusts late enough to control his flick to long leg"
"slower ball, hangs it wide outside off, Dickwella drives to point"
"that's too easy. The ball is short on leg stump, so Dickwella shuffles across and glances it away to the long leg boundary. All that effort from  Chatara, working in the batsman's favour. That's gutting for a fast bowler"
"back of a length on off stump, defends with an open face behind point"
leans over the tossed up delivery on off stump and manoeuvres it through midwicket
sees the flight and sets himself for a bottom-handed belt through the off side. The dip does him and he mistimes the shot down the pitch
whacks the shortish delivery through midwicket
"gets down the track, hits the ball on the full, but finds mid-on."
flays the tossed up delivery to the sweeper cover
stays back to a length ball and works it with the angle to deep midwicket
"goes off the bottom of the bat, but he has enough power to find the boundary. Length ball, very wide, a freebie really. So Gunathilaka frees his arms and swings straight down the ground"
the dog's still around - and it nearly comes a little too close to a cricket ball coming a high pace. Dickwella cuts a short ball behind point and it just misses the poor creature

"drifts the ball over onto off stump, Dickwella plays against it, but with the turn, to deep square leg"

"blocks the googly, reading it only of the pitch, because he was, until the moment he presented a straight bat, looking to flick it through midwicket"
lunges forward outside off to block
"steps beside the offcutter, a shortish one too, and carves it to point"
"Zimbabwe are wondering if there's a glove in this pull shot through to the keeper. There's a long discussion, between the keeper, Raza and the captain, and it's taken too long.

loads up a tennis forehand against a short and wide delivery and he nearly takes out the bowler
"tosses it up on leg stump, clips it to deep midwicket to bring up the 250"
"there's a man there... there's a man there... Mireeee, but it beats him on his left. Sensational connection from Tharanga. Went down to sweep, and he times it so well - it was nothing more than a whip of the wrists - that it carries to the rope. Hits it on the full."
"steps out of his crease, is deceived by the ball dipping on him, and the ball skews off the outside half of the bat to deep cover"
slams a short delivery through to the sweeper cover
"hangs back, without actually moving back, as he slices the ball from the stumps to the sweeper. Mendis hustles through for a second. Good work"
"tosses it up outside off, Mendis drives to long-on"
"launches the short ball - there have been so so many from the Zimbabwe spinners - and Tharanga hammers it over deep midwicket quite handsomely. He's usually pristine on the off side, but here he's looking pretty good slogging too"
"flicks it, with the turn, through to deep midwicket"
"catch it, is the cry, and Chiabhabha, the substitute, leaps up as high as he can, but does so a touch late as he moves to his right. <b>dropped</b>. So a tame chip from Tharanga becomes a single in the end"
"<b>dropped</b> again by Chibhabha, but again, it is another difficult grab! Mendis pulls this short ball mightily, and he has to move to his right again, extending his hand out, but can only parry it away to the deep"
sends it through to the sweeper
"another pull from Mendis, and it goes rather close to Chibhabha at short midwicket again. Too quick, and too far for him to bother with it though. And it beats long-on on his right too"
"clips a good length ball through to deep midwicket for a second. Big ground, soft hands, easily done"
shifts back and deftly turns the shortish delivery to deep square leg
"he's inside edged a pull straight onto his left boot, and it stings! Hobbles around in his crease before flashing an embarrassed little grin and collecting a fist bump from his partner"
takes on the short ball again and this time makes a little more out of it - single to deep square leg
"a slower, short delivery outside off, Tharanga pulls it to deep midwicket"
full and very very wide outside off. The batsman doesn't need to care for them
"shortish and outside off, Tharanga hits it off the bottom of the bat back down the pitch"
slices the full delivery outside off to deep point
"cuts from the stumps, with Raza bowling flat. Single to the sweeper"
"rocks back, picking the length early, or predicting it with Zimbabwe constantly bowling short, and the pull shot goes to long leg to bring up the fifty stand"
"flatter delivery, keeps low on off stump, and Tharanga, who's weight is going back and away on leg stump, just about toe-ends it"
races down the pitch and nails a straight drive. Raza does well to move to his left and get two hands on it. But it has so much power that it pings away
""
waits in his load-up and then delivers - guess what? - another short ball. Tharanga isn't fooled by such theatrics. Smacks a cut shot through extra cover
"that's ridiculously easy, he made it look ridiculously easy. Out comes a short ball, well outside off, and Mendis greets it with the gentlest little ramp to the third man boundary"
"offcutter on off stump, defends. And again, Mumba falls in his followthrough, tripping over his right leg. He keeps doing that because he runs in at an angle into the wickets, and then has to change direction immediately to avoid the danger area."
"back of a length and outside off, pushes it to the right of the sweeper cover"
"shortish, and slow, on off stump, Mendis pulls to deep square leg and Sri Lanka have their 300. The last fifty coming in only 28 balls"
launches a short ball to deep midwicket
meets the short ball under his eyes and pulls it to deep midwicket.
"shortish and outside off, sent away to the sweeper"
guides a shortish delivery to point
allows a short ball to stroll away over his right shoulder and become a wide
ducks under the short ball from around the wicket
"hits into the breeze, and so the ball just holds up in the air, and plop on the ground about two-thirds of the way to the midwicket boundary"
avoids the attempted bouncer on leg stump
"continues digging into his own half, Tharanga continues to let them all go, and it's been called a wide for height"
"slower short ball on off stump, pulls it to deep midwicket"
"back of a length ball, lets it go."
"there it is. Only the second chase of 300 ever in Sri Lanka and both have come in this series. Tharanga wraps it up with a pull - indicative of the lengths Zimbabwe have insisted on bowling on this flat pitch, those tactics need to be looked at - and stays not out for the third innings in a row"
