"full, heaved to leg... <b>and into the crowd!</b> Munro clears the pickets for the first time, looked a bit of a mishit as the ball ballooned into the sky, but it had the legs to go all the way. And one of the orangemen in the crowd missed his chance of $50,000, too! Completely misjudged it"
"short, slightly leg side, wide again"

"back of a length, Munro pulls powerfully but flat, just one to deep square leg"

comes across and pokes into the covers

"flighted, Taylor comes out and turns it into a full toss, clipped square for one"
"tossed up and Chapman attempts to sweep, hit on the front pad - <b>and given!</b> After a moment's discussion, he decides to <b>review</b>, however... Looked pretty good to me, but maybe going on with the angle from round the wicket? No bat involved, it pitched in line and ball-tracking says it would have smashed off stump! Good decision from Wayne Knights and Agar has his second"

"floated up, worked down the ground"
