"full and curving into the pads, times a flick beautifully behind square"
"that's better, fullish length outside off, not giving him too much room, Ghani comes forward and defends it back"
"and follows it up with another poor delivery. Angling it into his pads, and at that pace, all you need to do is get some bat. Except Ghani doesn't but the pace is enough for the ball to graze the pad and beat the keeper to the fine leg boundary"

backs away to a pacy flatter one that slides into him and fends it away to the cover region
advances down the ground and gets right underneath it before carving it over the bowler with his left hand outstretched

"Shahzad runs down the track, full and pushed wider, flat-batted away to long-off"
"shorter and spins away outside off, flashed through the covers"
"Shahzad jumps outside leg and reverse-sweeps the ball straight to Mahmudullah at backward point. Seeing Shahzad move away from the line of the stumps, Shakib tosses it wider outside off. He still reverse-sweeps and finds backward point. So, the dropped catch costs Bangladesh just one run"

"short, pulls but has to fetch it from way outside off and the bounce also gets big. Takes the top-edge and drops in no man's land, at the midwicket region"
"full and angled in, driven down to long-on"
swipes big at this incoming delivery and miscues it off the inside of the bat to the left of deep midwicket
"length ball that comes in, clears the front leg and hoicks it to deep midwicket where the fielder comes in and gathers it on the bounce"

"short, fails to get entirely on top of it as he misses with the upper cut"
"short of a length, muscles a pull to the gap at deep midwicket. Two fielders converge and long-on, who slides to his right, slightly over-runs and lets the ball sneak past his left"
"short ball outside off, gets a top-edge on the pull as he's tucked up for room and sails over the fine leg boundary. This is a huge over"
"back of a length outside off, drags the pace back. Shenwari drags a pull from outside off and fails to get elevation as the ball sails flat into the hands of deep midwicket running to his right. They go upstairs to see if he's overstepped. It's just inside, by inches"

"yorker into the legs, manages to squeeze it out between them through square leg"

"short of a length, slower and he picks the drop in pace, waits for it and swivels through with a powerful pull over deep midwicket"
"two in two. Abul predictably switches to the fuller length and Shafiq's already anticipated it. It's another slower ball, back of the hand, and enough room for Shafiq to get down and slog it over cow corner"
"and now he's been bowled off a full toss. That's a third poor delivery but Abul's lucky it hasn't cost him more. Shafiq gets down and swipes hard but with the ball dipping on him, fails to put bat to it as it crashes into the stumps"
shuffles across and swings for a big bit over the leg side but the ball curves into him and beats the bat on its way to the keeper
"Appeal straight away as Tamim is struck on the back leg, and it's given! Tamim shaped to sweep this pretty flat one bowled from round the wicket, angling into the stumps. Then he realised it was probably too quick to play that stroke, and then tried to adjust and defend. He ended up playing down the wrong line, playing for the offbreak, when it just kept going with the angle, striking him in front of middle and off. As plumb as can be. What a start."
"ooh, nearly another! Went back to a flat one that wasn't too short, looking for the cut. Hurried through with the angle again, cramping him, and he just about kept it out."
"length ball on off stump, punched to mid-off"

"looks to fire it in full and at Mushfiqur's pads, ends up missing his radar slightly and slipping down the leg side"

"back of a length, angling in towards off stump. Shuffles across and tucks it away into the backward square leg region"
And Shapoor bowls a gimme ball wide outside off. A full-toss. Attempted slower ball and it doesn't land as expected. Holds his shape perfectly and slaps it away to the left of cover point
"Short ball, doesn't quite come onto the bat as he attempts to pull. Early on the shot. Stops on him and ends up hitting him on the body and dropping gently into the leg side"

"back of a length, leg-stumpish. Tucked off the hip into the midwicket region"
"length ball close to off stump, good stride forward for the punch to extra-cover"
"maybe he can win this for Afghanistan without bowling at all! That's a stunning catch on the leg-side boundary, if he's caught it cleanly. The soft signal, however, is not out as this goes upstairs to the third umpire. Looks for the slog-sweep off a ball that perhaps wasn't full enough for it, looks to fetch it from outside off. Top-edge, and it flies in the air towards Rashid at deep backward square leg. He rushes in and goes for the catch while sliding forward. It's a really low grab, but it looks like it might have juuuust bounced before getting into his hands. Exceedingly close one, this, but I think it'll stay with the soft signal... Yup, NOT OUT is what the big screen says"
"length ball on middle and leg, shows the full face for the pushed single to long-on"
"short, a bit of width, stabbed away to deep point"
"and he strikes first ball! Mushfiqur is the latest batsman to be out reverse-sweeping. It's a quick, flat one on off stump that doesn't turn too much either way. Mushfiqur misses, and it slides past his front leg and knocks back off stump"
"and he's gone first ball! Done in by the wrong'un! Back of a length, and he shuffles across, shaping for the punch down the ground. I don't think he's picked this at all. His head ends up far outside the line as the ball rips back in off the pitch, and he has to play around his pad, in a hurry, to make contact with the ball. He misses, and it strikes his pad in front of middle stump. You won't see too many plumber lbws"
"another googly, and Mosaddek misses the flick, but this slips down the leg side"

"very full on middle stump, flicked to midwicket"

"full on off stump, looks for the single to long-off, ends up with a single to extra-cover after the fielder in the circle dives to his right and stops it"
"back of a length outside off, looks to steer it behind point with an open face, doesn't connect. His back foot didn't go across at all"
"down the track and Shapoor shortens his length, angling it away from the batsman. Reaches out and slices it away, on the bounce, to third man"
"back of a length on leg stump, another single. Tucked off the hip to deep midwicket"
loopy slower ball that dips onto a full length close to off stump. Driven hard but straight to extra-cover
"back of a length angling across to off stump. Waits on it and dabs to short third man. Risky single, and there's a bit of hesitation. Mahmudullah would have been just in at the striker's end if the throw had hit the stumps"
"slower ball, full, on off stump, and Mahmudullah spots it early, holds his shape, and unfurls a majestic lofted drive that easily clears the extra-cover boundary"
"back of a length, turns in towards middle stump, goes back and clips into the midwicket region"
"flat length ball on off stump, offbreak, goes back and jabs it back to the bowler"

"back of a length on the pads, clipped through midwicket"
"flat, back of a length, angles in from wide of the crease to cramp Mosaddek for room. Stays leg-side of the ball and jabs to short third man"
"down the track and Mujeeb spots him and shortens his length considerably. Slogs anyway, ends up toe-ending it, and it loops in the air and falls well short of the man at long-on"
"googly, pitching on middle and turning quickly down leg, swept away hard to deep midwicket"
"flat, quick legbreak on middle stump. Hurries Mosaddek and all he can do is defend off the back foot. He has to find some way of hitting a boundary"
"goes for the big hit now, sees some flight outside off and goes for the big slog-sweep. Picks the googly okay, but there's a man at long-on and he hits it straight down his throat. Mosaddek goes for 14 off 23 - it's been a real struggle for him today"
"full-toss on middle and leg, clipped away respectfully to deep square leg. Hit it, man! HIT IT!"
"Mahmudullah doesn't pick it at all. Shortish, pitching on middle and leg, and he makes room, assuming it's a legbreak he can cut. Ends up ripping in the other way, and it hits him on the back leg"
"finally, a bad ball from Rashid. Short and wide, and he cuts it away easily between backward point and short third man"
"that'll help. A bouncer on off stump, and Abul swivels hard through a hopeful hook. Top-edges it over the keeper and there's no stopping that"
"bowled him! Excellent bowling, saw Abul stepping out and fired in a yorker, right under his bat, to take out leg stump. Looked to jab that back down the ground, but  no way he was connecting - it basically pitched right below his bat"
"full on the pads, clipped to long leg"
"short, slanting away from Mahmudullah, and this is all but over. Looks to fetch that from outside off and pull, but he's working against the angle and a bit of extra bounce too. Top-edges it in the air, and it lands in the gully region where three fielders converge - backward point, short third man, and keeper. They basically collide gently into each other when the ball drops into a pair of hands. It turns out the fielder is Usman Ghani - I think he came in from backward point, but I can't be sure"
"back of a length on middle stump, shows the full face and picks up a single in the wide mid-on region"
"And he's broken a stump. Slants it in from wide of the crease, a good-length ball that Rubel stays back to and tries to swat with a horizontal bat. Sneaks under and snaps the leg stump in two"
""
"full on off stump, whipped to the right of mid-on"
"high full-toss - seemed to be above waist high, on off stump - clears his front leg and swipes it down to long-on. Definitely above waist high but not called no-ball"
"bouncer, Jayed ducks under it"
"length ball angling down leg. Looks to flick, only manages a tickle off his pad towards the keeper"
"low full-toss outside off, and Rashid ends it with a spectacular catch. Dives to his left and grabs it overhead with both hands, after Jayed slaps it hard and flat. This has been excellent from Afghanistan, a great start to a historic tour"
