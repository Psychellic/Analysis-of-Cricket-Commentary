Kayes seems to have been hit rather hard by that ball, and he's going off the field. It was well struck by Hetmyer, which contributed to it coming so quickly that Kayes couldn't react in time to catch it"

"<b>mix up but he's safe</b> this time Chase wanted the single, having tapped this past the bowler, but Hope was stuck to his crease and had his hand up. Chase took a few steps down, hurriedly turned back. The throw was very wide of the stumps, which gave him enough time to get back"

He tried dabs and steers, but finally fell prey to temptation, trying to go over the top. Ends up toe-ending to mid-off. Full ball, but not quite full for the drive, and he pays the price"

"short ball again outside off, pulled down in front of square to deep square leg"
"fuller ball, flicked to deep square leg"
"<b>bouncer on target</b> Gets it right this time, rising just enough to whistle past his head and completely defeat his intended pull. The batsman thought he'll get a wide, but this was legal. Ooh replays show that it went over his helmet actually. Maybe that should have been a wide. Lucky break for Bangladesh"

"made as if to move across again but stayed still eventually, driving this full ball to deep cover"
"too full, but wide of off, angling across, he chops it to point"

"<b>overthrows keep Hope on strike</b> driven firmly to point and they are completing a comfortable single but the fielder has a shy, It's too wild and allows a second"
"digs in a bouncer. Hope ducks underneath and looks at the umpire, but he signals that it's legit and it's one bouncer for the over"
"yorker goes wrong and ends up as a full toss. The big drive also goes a bit wrong, in that he doesn't get the placement right. straight to deep cover"
"good short ball from Rubel, and Paul has a wild heave that connects with nothing"
"<b>dropped at deep square leg</b> Another short ball, Paul nailed the pull that time and hit it hard, and flat. Nazmul was there but the ball was travelling. He over-ran it in fact, and then stuck out a hand to just about stop it, but never looked like catching it"

"misses the attempted glide that time, with Fizz keeping it full and in the yorker zone. Goes across Hope and to the keeper"
"<b>over the keeper and a boundary</b> 16 runs off the over. what a shot that was. He went down on one knee to paddle it, ended up not timing it well and hitting it right back over the keeper from one knee. No fielder there and it's another boundary"
"too short, and he stays back to swat it to deep midwicket. The boundary is long enough for them to run two. Good running, but it also means Paul stays on strike"
"too short again, and pulled. In the air but bounces well in front of deep midwicket"
"too short again, Hope stays low and swivel-pulls to deep square leg"
"too short again, and pulled away again, and they run a hard two. <b>West Indies have won</b> Magnificent, magnificent knock by Shai Hope. It's the first win for West Indies on tour after two bad defeats in the Tests and one thrashing in the first ODI. But they have now levelled the series and there is all to play for in the last ODI."
