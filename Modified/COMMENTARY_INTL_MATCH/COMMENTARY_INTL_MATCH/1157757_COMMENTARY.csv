"<b>direct hit ends Rayudu's innings</b> came down the track, but the bowler shortened his length and Rayudu couldn't free his arms, ended up bunting it towards wide mid-off. Wonderful work by Fabian Allen to run to his right, pick up and throw down the stumps at his bowling end in one motion. Catches Rayudu well short and ends a superb innings"

"given some air and pitched fuller on off, allowing Jadhav to drive fluently into the covers"
"slower bouncer outside off, Dhoni waits for it and cuts it down to a squarish third man."
"<b>dropped</b> slower ball, Dhoni was looking to send it into orbit but only got the toe-end. It went high in the air but was dropping quickly. Fabian Allen at midwicket was running backwards and put in a full-length dive but couldn't hold on. Would have been a fabulous catch if he had"
"<b>soft dismissal</b> full ball on the pads, and Dhoni flicks it. Seemed to have got hold of it too, but it went straight to short fine leg. Anti-climatic dismissal, but the drop the previous ball hasn't cost West Indies much"
"short outside off, Jadeja rides the bounce to steer it down to third man"

"slower one again, and Jadeja picks it up this time. Dragged it short again and Jadeja waited for it and pulled it to square leg. Got the placement perfect"
"low full toss, clubbed from outside off to long-on"
<b>Jadhav finishes well</b> full on the stumps and he digs it out to long-on. Sent it very straight and timed it perfectly
"good length on middle, and shaping away from Hemraj. Tapped to cover, and they want a single, but Kohli's diving effort ensures its a dot ball"
"good length on leg stump, but once again angling across Hemraj. Defended off the back foot from outside off to the bowler"
"<b>leading edge</b> But just short of Kohli at cover. Length ball on middle, and he tries to nudge towards midwicket. Bat's face is closed, and he's lucky that he's still in the middle"
"good length on off, and pushed with the bat's open face past cover. Jadeja and Kohli give the ball a chase, but the former manages to parry it back before his captain"

"good length on leg stump, and nudged with the angled bat to the gap near midwicket. They jog across for a single"
"swing and a miss. Full on middle, and Powell swivels to pull. But the ball stays low, and hits his knee-roll. Impact's in front of off stump, but would've definitely missed the stumps. Rohit dives at first slip to ensure West Indies can't collect a leg bye"
"<b>beautiful shape!</b> Fuller from Bumrah, and Powell looks to drive from off stump. But the ball angles away, and sneaks past the outside of his bat. Great seam position too"

"length ball on leg stump, and he looks to whip it off his pads to the leg side. Minimal movement of the feet, and the ball hits above the knee roll"

"full on leg, and driven with the swing to mid off. Straight to the fielder. A good return over from Bhuvi so far"
"length ball shaping away from Hemraj, and he frees his arms to slap a cut past the infield! Flies into the boundary. Just that extra width and punished by the opener"
"back of a length outside leg stump, and he tries to flick behind square. Just past his hips, and Dhoni races to his right to intercept"
"<b>short-arm jab!</b> Length ball on leg, and he thumps a controlled punch over midwicket and into the stands. Shades of Yuvraj in that shot"

"length ball on middle, and the straight-bat defense takes the outside edge. Flayed to point"
"<b>big appeal</b> for caught behind but umpire Chaudhary remains stoic. Dhoni says 'I heard something, 100%.' and that's enough for Kohli to review. It was a length ball outside leg that jagged inwards as Powell tried to defend. Goes between bat and body, and it has touched something on the way to the keeper, but that's the <b>back leg</b>. Pitching outside leg too, so they're not checking for the lbw."
"overpitched outside off, enticing Powell to drive. The ball's gone past him by the time he brings his bat down for the shot"
"good length on middle, and the ball stays low! Tries to punch with the straight bat, but it goes through to the keeper on the bounce"
"full outside off, and that's been <b>plucked out of thin air!</b> Reaches forward to try and lift a drive over cover, but Rayudu tiptoes and times his jump to perfection and gives India the breakthrough"
"full on off, and he gets onto the back foot to defend towards the bowler. Covers his stumps early"
"<b>Kuldeep with a direct hit!</b> Defended off the back foot to mid on, and Kuldeep picked the ball and threw it in one single motion. Hope's diving effort is simply not good enough! Gone for a duck"
"<b>through him once again!</b> West Indies livin' dangerously. Length ball on off, and jagging inwards after hitting the deck. Tries to punch but falls over because he loses his balance, and the ball sneaks under his bat"
"length ball on middle, and defended with the straight bat to mid on"
"good length outside off, and angling away after hitting the pitch. Samuels shoulders his arms"
"<b>hara-kiri!</b> Nonchalantly reverse-flicked from cover, and the ball rolls onto the non-striker's stumps! Samuels defended this to Kohli and Powell was looking for the single. Uses his wrists to flick it and it hits middle stump. Powell's nowhere near the crease"
"length ball angling in from outside off. Defended with the straight bat, and the outside edge takes it down to third man"
"length ball on middle, and going across Hetmyer. Shoulders his arms"
"good length on leg stump, and tapped off the front foot to cover. Soft hands from Hetmyer"

"good length on leg, and he makes room on the leg side to try and pull. Smacked hard, but straight to Jadhav at midwicket"
"full on middle stump, and clipped away to the leg side! Perfect timing off the bat, and the ball races away to the midwicket boundary"
"length ball outside off, and punched uppishly through the covers! Jadeja gives it a chase, but that's a futile one. Elegantly played"
"good length outside off, and defended with the bat's open face. Steered to point"

"full on off, and he clears his front leg to swing over mid off. Outside edge takes it right over point, and the ball falls in no man's land"
"<b>slow finger of death from the umpire</b> but Hetmyer reviews. Length ball, slower ball and coming into Hetmyer's pads. Tries to defend towards the leg side but the ball beats his bat and hits his back leg. Impact's on middle stump, this should be crashing. Ball-tracking, however, says 'clipping middle stump'... so West Indies keep the review, but Hetmyer must walk back"
"full outside off, and shaping away from the right-hander. Left alone"
"<b>beautiful ball!</b> Shades of Irfan Pathan. Full on off, and shaping into the right hander. Looks to drive through the covers, but the ball nips back and goes between bat and body. Almost clipped off stump there"

"full ball on the stumps, driven from the crease to cover"
"length ball angling in too much and ends up on the pads, tapped into the leg side"

"<b>through him!</b> angled across, pitching on off and straightens. Goes like a homing missile through the gap between expansive bat and pad. West Indies are sinking fast"
