"decent start, a very full length and a shade of swing from leg to off. Dabbed to short midwicket"
"tight line outside off, and more signs of early swing. A good leave but a fine delivery too"
"left alone once again, with a bit of zip back into the right-hander this time. Good carry too"
"nips back once again and raps the top of Cook's pads as he elects to leave. No appeal as that was clearly sailing over, but another fine ball"
"stunning bowling - two that came in, then one that zips away at pace. Cook is beaten all ends up"
dabbed down the ground with a long stride and a not-entirely-committed poke. South Africa are away
forward and fenced to short cover
a bit of swing from a wide line outside off. Easily ignored
on a fifth-stump line. No stroke once again
"outside off, much tighter line and a very good length too. Cook hauls his bat inside the line at the last split-second"
through to the keeper. Good control
"well bowled, shaping down the leg-side before straightening off the pitch. Jabbed into the covers and they wisely decline the single"
"very full length, as Elgar faces up to his first ball of the match. Pushed to mid-off"
"on the pads, tucked calmly into the gap at midwicket to get off the mark"
"extra bounce from a tight line, and Cook is tucked up. The ball ricochets out to the cordon, off his midriff"
"full length, and worked to midwicket"
"forward and dragged into the leg-side, not quite to the pitch of a forward press"
"good lift, better leave. Lakmal ramps it up to the left-hander, tight outside his off stump"
squirted into the off side with a firm front-foot push
"outside off, swinging away"
nudged out to point
"squared up on off stump, and that's sharp work in the slips to intercept a soft-handed edge into the cordon"
lifting fiercely through to the keeper
"well played, a fraction over-pitched, and room outside off to free the arms. A punched drive, hauled back right on the edge of the rope"
playing away from the body and in the air for a while into the covers. Risky but safe in the end
"better judgement, left alone outside off"
"full length, wide line, left alone"
"full length again, inviting the drive, and Elgar half-obliges with a compact push to wide mid-off"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
through to the keeper
tapped into the off side
"outside off, through to the keeper with a hint of outswing"
"big appeal as Cook is slammed on the knee-roll by a nipbacker! Saved by the bounce, you suspect. Sri Lanka decline the review, and rightly so. That was going over. Just!"
left alone
"forward, and crunched into the covers"
"well bowled, that one explodes off the seam, as Cook is lured into a hard-handed push. Gets away with it"
through to the keeper on a tight line
"beautiful delivery, and there's a definite sound as the ball curls back into the left-hander, muscles through bat, pad, past the off stump and into the keeper's gloves! The Sri Lankans appeal, but even they aren't convinced? Top of pad? Looks like it"
"outside off, no stroke"
"through to the keeper, a hint of swing"
"pings off the seam, well wide of off stump"
"through to the keeper, tidy probing line"
"full length, Cook picks it up from off stump and eases it through the leg side. That's a calmly picked-off stroke"
"outside off, wobbling a touch off the seam, too wide to tempt a stroke"
"banged in short, gathered down the leg side"
"curling towards the slips, Cook leaves alone with a flourish"
"flicked round the corner, off an inside edge. Well bowled, a good probing length that Cook is neither forward nor back to"
"tip and run, a well-judged quick single"
"banged in short, defended into the off side on the back foot"
"extravagant movement from back of a length, leaping past the edge"
"very full again, left alone but that was a tempting length, and nibbling off the seam too"
"that's another beauty, nailing his length now, leaping past the bat at splice height. Elgar obliged to come forward but play back"
worked into the leg side
"on the hip, tucked into the leg side"
"outside off, nipping off the seam and through to the keeper"
back of a length and too wide to threaten the bat. Left alone
half-left on a full length. Point tidies up
very full and searching. Jabbed back to the bowler on the back foot
through to the keeper once again
"full length, probing stuff"
solidly into line to defend
"up on the toes, punched through the covers off the back foot"
"forward and defended, all the way to the fence! The first four of the day, and it was timed to perfection, right under the eyeline"
"on the back foot, and punched through backward point. No boundaries for ten overs, now two in two balls"
"on the pads, tucked down to fine leg"
through to the keeper
"floaty length outside off, that's a lollipop to launch his spell, and Elgar leans it clean through long-off"
"fuller and tighter, defended back down the pitch"
"tight line on a full length, no stroke this time"
"wicket-to-wicket line, blocked back down the pitch"
"outside off, no stroke offered"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
climbing off a full length and flinched into the leg side
"that's a good line, bending back into the left-hander at pace. Left alone"
"down the leg side and was that a drop? Nope, leg-byes are signalled. A big deflection, clangs off Chandimal's webbing and away to the boundary"
tighter line on leg stump. Defended with a perpendicular bat
"fuller length, fenced into the leg side"
keeps a touch low outside off stump
"edged! But short of third slip. A full length outside off, Elgar drawn into pushing at it but just loosens his grip enough to make the ball go to ground"
"forces himself well forward, 117kph, defended to the off side"
"gets across the crease, defends into the leg side"
"back of a length, angled across outside off, left alone"
"that's good batting, he knocks a length delivery square into the off side to rotate the strike"
"full outside off, 121kph, hint of movement away as Cook leaves alone"
"good start, full and straight, Elgar jabs down and the ball squirts off the face towards the slips"
"a short ball, he's quickly into a pull through square leg. Not quite timed so long leg can get around"
"back of a length at off stump, 139kph, defended on the back foot towards gully"
that's a nasty delivery! Spits from just back of a length and rams into Elgar's top hand as he fends towards the off side
"short of a length, angled into the body, nudged off the hip to long leg"
"shoved way down the leg side, Chandimal can only palm it away diving to his right and it dribbles into the boundary"
"full outside off, he presses forward and the ball dribbles to square leg"
gets right across outside off and works this with a closed face to the leg side
"given! Mathews has taken one...at last. But Cook calls for the <B>review</b>. Bounce can be factor at this ground, but this looked good. Hang on, has he overstepped?! This is <i>very</i> tight. A millimetre of heel means he's ruled okay. It's a full delivery, hits well below the knee roll and it's slamming into middle stump"
"full outside off, good line, left alone"
"angled in at off stump, 121kph, straightens a touch off the seam and defended"
"well bowled, another one bounces off a good length. Takes Amla on the glove and he's in some pain. Grimaces and takes the glove off. That did spit."
"full outside off, left alone"
"and another! One brings two, as they say. Bit of a loose shot from Elgar. A back-of-a-length ball outside off, angling across, he's playing a long way from his body, a cross between a cut and a back-foot drive, and gets a thick top edge to first slip"
"full at off stump, driven back to the bowler"
"short of a length, 138kph, Duminy plays back and defends down by his feet"
"that's well bowled! Things are happening. On a full length, bounces and scoots past the outside edge as Duminy tries to get forward"
left alone outside off
"more tricky bounce off a good length, jags away off the seam as well and squares up Amla...the glove falls short of slip"
defended into the on side
"a big appeal for lbw as Amla shuffles across his crease, glances off the pads to long leg...seemed to be heading leg side"
"loses his line, on the pads and it's tickled down to fine leg"
"back outside off stump, 122kph, left alone"
"full at off stump, takes an inside edge into the pads as he plays forward"
"full outside off, 144kph, pushed into the covers and he gets off the mark"
"a bouncer, over middle and off, comfortably avoided"
"a strangled appeal for lbw as Duminy plays across the line, but that pitched outside leg stump"
"gets forward to a fuller delivery, punches it firmly towards mid-on...was in the air for a little while"
"short of a length, pushed across outside off, left alone"
"a touch too short and wide, 130kph, left alone"
"on a length outside off, 123kph, defended to the covers"
"fuller, brings him forward, played to the bowler"
"wider outside off, 125kph, left alone"
beaten! This jags away sharply off the seam from back of a length. Lots of movement. If it had been a touch fuller might have found the edge
"fuller, on off stump, stretches forward and defends"
"full, wide outside off, some gentle swing on this one, left alone"
"full at off stump, 141kph, defended to the covers"
"a well-directed bouncer, Duminy goes for the pull and is beaten over the top edge"
"full outside off, driven to cover"
"drags this from way outside off, it was a short ball, and pulls it through straight midwicket...not sure he realised the ball was quite as wide as it was"
"back of a length at off stump, 144kph, push-and-run into the covers"
"full and straight, defended back to the bowler"
"full outside off, he comes forward and plays it square to the off side...that's a well-judged single as gully can't get in quick enough"
"full outside off, defended to the covers"
"takes his bottom hand off the bat as he defends a length delivery, deflects behind square on the leg side"
defended into the off side
"full outside off, 122kph, left alone"
pushes a length ball into the off side
"on a length at off stump, runs off a thickish outside edge between gully and third slip to the third-man rope"
"back of a length, defended towards point"
"full, slips down the leg side"
"that's a dreamy stroke, comes forward into a full ball and drives it beautifully straight down the ground"
"round the wicket, and another lovely straight drive, this time to the on side of the stumps, and not quite with the same force as the previous one"
"wide outside off, left alone"
"defended from off stump, Pradeep gets across in his followthrough"
"on middle and off, played towards mid-off"
"fuller, outside off, 135kph and left alone"
"presses forward into a full delivery, pushes into the covers and that's another smart single"
"back of a length at off stump, defended to the on side"
"full, straight, and flicked through midwicket as the bottom hand comes into play, was a little uppish but split the fielders"
"short, wide outside off, harmless and left alone"
"<B>dropped</b>, that's a huge moment! Full outside off, drawing him into a flat-foot drive and it carries low to gully. Should have been held by de Silva"
"in the channel outside off, left alone"
"short outside off, too wide, Amla can watch it go through"
"full outside, again his feet don't move and he's driving away from his body, a thick edge scoots between his legs"
"oh dear, that's gone very wrong...a full toss flung down the leg side, Chandimal has no chance and that's a horrid way to end a session. Throw in a dropped catch, too"
"pitched up, 119kph and floating through temptingly a foot outside off, Amla watches carefully and plays no stroke"
"full and angled in on off stump, leans out to block"
"pitched up, gentle pace but there's a bit of wobble, Amla again lines it up on the front foot and defends"
"full in the channel, steps across and shoulders arms"
"fullish, teasing line and he gets Amla reaching for it, takes the outside edge but scoots along the carpet to gully this time"
comes across on off stump and blocks a length ball
"length ball, pushed across Duminy from over the wicket, left alone wide of the stumps"
closer to the stumps but still not quite tight enough to make Duniny play
"angled across, slightly back of a length and Duminy continues to shoulder arms"
"pitched up on middle and off... and rifled back down the ground, an emphatic stroke from Duminy, who hits cleanly through the line and past mid-off for his fifth boundary"
"good length on the stumps, Duminy waits in the crease and blocks"
"shortish, flying through in the channel, lifts the bat out of the way"
"dobbed on middle and off, Amla comes forward to defend"
"fullish on off, another circumspect block as Hash leans forward"
"good length ball, around off stump, blocked"
lets this one fly through in the channel

"shorter length, in the channel, lets this one through"
"around off stump, good length and defended dutifully into the covers"
"draws him forwards again and Duminy is opened up on the drive, something of a success for Lakmal, as a thick edge flies away but it flashes low between point and gully and wins the race to the fence"
"length ball on the stumps, this time a thick inside edge runs to fine leg"
"fullish on middle and leg, comes forward and nudges down the ground"
"overptiched, in the slot outside off, Duminy steps out and accepts the offer to hammer a half-volley through the covers"
"dug in short, down the leg side... and Mathews had overstepped, too"
"pushed across the bows, Duminy lets it go"
"ooh, nearly gets a nibble! Tantalising length, Duminy goes fishing in the corridor and is <i>this close</i> to tickling it through to the keeper"
"fullish outside off, Duminy steers it through point with an open bat face"
"pitched up and straightening on the stumps, Amla closes the bat face trying to play across the line, gets a leading edge into the covers"
"steps out and smoked through cover, driven on the up and it was in the air for a bit before skipping away - that's the SA 100 up"
"Lakmal bowling round the wicket now, comes across to defend on off"
"slightly back of a length, wide enough for Duminy to again shoulder arms"
"length ball a foot outside off, 132kph, hops across and leaves"
"good carry through from a slightly short length, still too wide to draw a stroke"
"veering back in at 139kph, decent ball from Lakmal but again Duminy is confident that his stumps are safe and leaves alone"

"touch wider, zipping through in the corridor of disquietude, no stroke offered"
"line and length outside off, again happy to leave"

"fuller on the stumps, tapped into the covers"
"round the wicket, pitched up and rasped through point on the drive, another fresh'n'clean stroke from Duminy to move to the brink of his fifty"
"ooh er, he's lost his line here, slung down very wide of the tramlines, practically to first slip"
"angled in, Duminy comes forward and blocks down the track"
"woof, beats the bat, straightening the ball appreciably from back of a length and Duminy wafts at it. Kumara purses his lips interestedly"
"blocked back towards the bowler, who fields in his follow through, shapes to throw at the stumps with Duminy stepping out of his crease... but ultimately hurling it towards slip again, as his back foot slipped. He makes this things happen, this lad"
"pitched up on off stump, pushed back into the off side again"
"now Kumara fires the ball down the leg side, Chandimal does well to get a glove on it but they still pick up a bye"
"edged, goes quickly to ground, flies through the slips - and that's his fifty! Another flirty push outside off but it pays off for Duminy, he just managed to check the stroke and open the face. He has played nicely"
"shortens his lengfth, pushed across in the channel, no stroke"
"dabbed down into the off side and he calls Amla through, could have been tight, if the throw had hit"
"length ball, comes across and pushes into the covers"
"banged in very short and climbing like an eager sherpa over the ducking Amla - probably could have been called wide, that. In fact, it was"
"length in the channel, wide enough to leave"
"oh, a jaffa to finish, the extra ball nearly does for Amla, who was beaten by some seam movement playing on the back foot!"
"angled in and straightening on off, defended from the crease"
"digs in the bouncer, outside off and Duminy has a dip at it, flailing in vain as the ball flies through to Chandimal"
comes across and punches a single through point
"touch short of a length, 136kph and outside off, Amla hops back and leaves alone"
"lets fly with a full toss, quick at 143kph but swatted unceremoniously through backward point, into the untended acres"
"straighter from Kumara and Amla works him away to leg - did the fielder sliding along the boundary touch the rope with his foot as he got up to throw? No, decides the third umpire"
"pitched up and pinged back down the ground, Pradeep flings out a hand as Amla dives for his crease... Mid-off tidies up and there's no thought of a run"
pitched up and pushed into the covers coming forwards
"Pradeep goes round the wicket, hangs the ball outside quite wide, Duminy ignores it"
"back of a length in the channel, no stroke"
"this one is speared in towards the stumps, anguished appeal from Pradeep as it strikes Duminy on the pad, the batsmen scuttle through for a leg bye - going over leg stump, according to Hawk-Eye"
touch short and flying through outside off as Amla drops back
"Kumara angles the ball in from round the wicket, Duminy defends"
"short, quite wide of the stumps, left alone"
shortish and tucked pff the body down to fine leg

"charges in, fired full on middle at 142kph, flicked off the pads and into a gap, slightly aerial but in front of midwicket and he gets a few more"
"fullish length ball on off, comes forward to defend"
"slammed in short, swerving away outside off, Duminy thinks about chasing after it and then leaves"
"pitched up and driven, wide of mid-on, who leaps on the ball acrobatically as it looks to be running away for a boundary - in fact, there's Rangana! Maybe he's been appointed fielding coach, too"

stretches forward and blocks
"steps back, opens the face and steers to deep point"

"full at middle and off, defended straight down the pitch"
"back of a length outside off, 134kph, defended on the back foot"

defended to the off side
"shovelled from outside off, wide of a rather slow dives from Herath, down to long-on"
"short, wide outside off, and he doesn't miss out, cut firmly through point although it was a pretty half-hearted effort to cut it off"

"some late shape outside off, wide enough to leave"

nudged to long-off
solidly onto the front foot
"low full toss, and slashed out to deep point. Duminy scampers back for the third to move within a boundary of his sixth Test hundred"
through to the keeper
"round the wicket, edged through the cordon and there it is! It wasn't the most elegant way to reach his hundred, but it matters not, and it was always a safe shot, played with soft hands down through the gap. He raises his arms, removes his helmet and soaks up the applause. Tremendous batting"

"the ball is 77 overs old, but still a touch of extra bounce from a good length...another blow on the bottom hand for Amla"

"on off stump, 135kph, defended"
takes his bottom hand off the pad as he works this into square leg

defended

defended back to the bowler
"short, wide outside off, Amla allows himself the freedom to throw his hands through the ball and upper cut it over the slips. Very safe."
"short and wide, left alone this time"
"fuller, outside off, he defends on the front foot"
"full, hint of late swing, left alone"
"wider, 132kph, carries at shin height to the keeper"
"hint of uncertainty there, but he ends up gliding this full delivery almost posthumously between the slips and gully to take him to his 150"
"short ball, at the hip, nudged away fine...came off the glove"
"back of a length, defended to the on side"
"and he's gone! Edges to second slip. He can't quite see out the day. A length ball angled across outside off, he pushes at it and the thick edge his snaffled to his left by Mendis"
"a bouncer first up, he ducks"
"full outside off, left alone"
"full outside off, swings away, doesn't require a stroke"
"wider, left alone...needs to make him play"
"tighter to off stump, good carry, Amla withdraws the bat at the last moment"
"short of a length, straighter, tucked behind square"
what a ripper! That's seamed and bounced from a good length. Climbs past the outside edge. South Africa's quicks (one of whom is Olivier) won't mind seeing that
"full and straight, head over the ball, he blocks to the off side"
"pitched up and shaping away, slightly wide of off stump and watched calmly through to the keeper"
"length, just outside off and curving towards first slip again, no stroke offered"
"angled in a touch straighter, Amla drops back on off and blocks"
"slightly back of a length, Lakmal brings this back in off the seam but Amla sees it all the way and shoulders arms"
"pitched up. 134kph a foot or two outside off and shaping away, another leave alone"
"good length and this springs through to Chandimal, again nips back but not enough to make Amla play - that's a maiden, and it looks like # is keen to see plenty more balls today"
"full and wobbling outside off, Olivier gets a stride in and leaves"
"pitched up in the channel, this time he gets forward to block"
"length and straightening, not quite demanding a stroke"
"ooh, that's the line, nipping away as Olivier fenced at it from the crease, ducks past the outside edge"
"another play-and-miss, Mathews going wide on the crease and firing the ball in, the swing is late and takes the ball perilously close to the edge"
"full and straight, trying to catch him unawares, Olivier lines it up and blocks solidly"
shuffles across on off stump and blocks with soft hands
"good length, 138kph and swerving away from Amla as he moves across, lavish swing but he's able to leave comfortably"
"a more testing line from Lakmal, angled in and straightening, just outside off but still he can't tempt Amla. Probabaly a tad short, too"
"good length on off stump, 139kph, blocked back down the track"
"gee whiz, that's a decent nut to a man like Amla, gets him feeling it for it as the ball shapes away late, daylight between bat and ball, though"
"more good stuff from Lakmal, probing in the channel, this time a thick low edge scuds to gully"
"good length around the line of off, Olivier comes across and defends"
"Mathews jumps slightly wide and spears the ball in full, another solid front-foot block"
"this spits off a length, Olivier was shaping to try and punch off the back foot, had to drop the hands as the ball flew through"
"teasing line, straightens a touch as Olivier brings the bat down at an angle, thick-edged low through gully - wouldn't have carried - and the new boy gets off the mark in Test cricket"
"pitched up on off, Amla comes forward and drops it into the covers for a quick single, also his first of the morning"
"fullish, on middle and leg, pushed back towards mid-on"
"Lakmal goes full and straight, Amla reaches down in front of him and gets a slight leading edge"
"shorter, homing in on the body, Amla hops back to be hit on the thigh pad"
"ooh, that's a ripper, jagging back from a length to smack Amla on the thigh again. Well bowled Suranga, but that's not necessarily a sight SL's batsmen will enjoy from the cordon"
"back of a length outside off, flying through as Amla shoulders arms"
"lovely line, doing the hokey-cokey, in and out around off stump, Amla knows that number pretty well, though, and shoulders arms confidently"
"straighter, turned off the hip for one"
"Mathews continues to trundle through in the channel outside off, Amla leaves it be"
"pitched up and holding its line, comes forward and ushers it through once more"
"ooh, nearly suckers Amla, angled in and straightening seductively past the outside edge - drew the false stroke, but not the edge"
"straighter line, 120kph and blocked coming forwards"
"touch short outside off, Amla hops back and leaves"
"fullish around off stump, leans into another Fairy-soft forward defensive"
"too good for Olivier, length and tailing away in the channel as he feels for it"
"lovely, curving line - too much swing really. Lakmal sends down a glittering scimitar of a ball that Olivier doesn't get near prodding from the crease"
angled in straighter and this time he get bat on it in defence
"good length, top of off stump, bunted back towards mid-off"
"whoosh, getting closer! Olivier feels the need to try and impose himself and has an unsuccessful dip at another outswinger"
"fired in on off stump, holds its line as the batsman defends into the covers"
"Mathews beats Amla again, curving a gentle dobbler away in the channel"
"ah ha, runs! Amla gets across to cover the swing and punches fine of mid-off, won't quite go all the way"
"touch back of a length, comes across and defends"
"pitched fuller, gets him driving, cover can't quite cut if off and they pick up a couple more. Scoreboard rattling"
"zips through as Olivier pushes at it, was there a sound? Oxenford doesn't think so but Mathews and the cordon were pretty confident and ask for the <b>review</b>. There's a little tickle on the audio as the ball straightens past the outside edge; and Ultra Edge murmurs its assent - that's it, SL finally have their man, Angie has a second"
"pitched up on a fourth-fifth stump line, Faf gets forward and dabs into the covers to get up and running"
"touch back of a length and holding its line outside off, du Plessis leaves"
"excellent line, draws the edge, <del>Lakmal strikes</deL> - <b>dropped!</b> An absolute howler from Mendis, a gentle outside edge lobbed to second slip, he had time - maybe too much time - to get low and watch it into the hands but only managed to get fingertips around it and the ball squirmed free, much to Lakmal's anguish"
"pitched up further, in the channel and swinging, du Plessis doesn't want to get his fingers burned again and leaves"
"full, comes forward and pushes into a gap at cover"
"length outside off, Amla leans into a square drive, point doesn't field it cleanly and they come back for two"
"back of a length, 138kph in the corridor, Amla stays back and lets it go"
"pitched up around off, du Plessis covers the line"
"angled in, easy-paced and met on the front foot"
"pitched up on a fourth-stump line, du Plessis leans into another forward block"
"shaping in the corridor, lets this one go"
"touch fuller and du Plessis plays with soft hands, dabbing into the covers and again calling through a quick single"
"full outside off, hint of away swing but met firmly on the front foot"
"back of a length, 132kph but there's extra venom in this, clatters into du Plessis' midriff off the inside edge as he fended from the crease"
"goes a little fuller now, holding its line outside off, no stroke"
"touch short, over the top of off, resolute defence from Faf"
"oof, struck in the spuds this time! Faf is left doubled up on the floor... Actually, he didn't need his <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oljYD911cVE target=new>reinforced box</a> on this occasion, the ball pranced off a length and hit him just above the waistline, right on the sculpted abs"
"angled in and then holding its line outside off, du Plessis leaves this one well alone"
"oh, nearly a run out! Faf dabbed square and set off straight away, Amla hesitated but Kumara only had one stump to aim at - he'd have been short with a direct hit but instead Faf gets a bonus boundary as the throw beats the man backing up and races away"
"short and wide and that is crunched through point, a dismissive back-foot thump for four"
"back of a length, this jumps to hit the splice of the bat"
touch short of a length outside off and left alone
"angled in and holding its line outside off, no stroke offered"
"du Plessis is poised on off stump, compact like corned beef, again he lets it through outside off"
"bosh, that's kitchen-sinked through the covers, Faf sits back and hammers a short ball for another boundary"
"good length and curling away outside off, Amla happy to let it go"
"chugging away in the channel, left alone once again"
"disciplined probing from Lakmal, slightly short and half a foot outside off but again not forcing the batsman to play"
"targets the stumps this time, 129kph/80mph and Amla leans out to block"
"shaping away outside off stump, again left alone"
"line and length on off stump, defended - and that will be <b>drinks</b>"
what a pearler...this pitches back of a length and zips away off the pitch to beat the outside edge. Pretty unplaybale
"he's hopping all over the place against this one, jabbing outside off as though the ball kept low but think he was just caught back in the crease"
"and he's gone now! Another ripping delivery. Back of a length, completely squares up du Plessis and the outside edge is comfortably held at second slip this time"
"good length outside off, left alone on length as much as line...almost carries over off stump"
"and another! That's a sharp snaffle at third slip. This is fuller, outside off, Bavuma can't resist having a hard-handed push, well away from his body, and it's grabbed above the head by Silva"
"full at middle and off, de Kock looks to work to the leg side the ball runs to cover"
"full at off stump, late movement into Amla who foces to midwicket"
"full, outside off, left alone"
"short of a length, pushed down the leg side"
"touch shorter, comes back significantly at Amla and takes the thigh pad"
"fuller, at off stump, he comes forward and it takes a thick inside edge behind square on the leg side"
"full, swings down the leg side, Chandimal palms it away as he dives to his right"
"back of a length outside off, cut into the pitch and it dribbles to cover"
"back of a length at middle and leg, takes the thigh pad as he aims to play to the leg side...actually took an inside edge"

gets across his crease and works a straight delivery to long leg
"angled across outside off, 134kph, left alone"
"a wild drive, reaching well away from his body with his feet stuck in the crease"
"full at off stump, squeezed out square to backward point"
"extra bounce from short of a length, de Kock has to jump to get on top of the ball to keep it down off his gloves"
"well bowled, slants across the left hander and skims past the outside edge...if being critical, a fraction short"
"full outside off, left alone"
"brilliant catch! Chandimal has scooped one diving low to his right. Amla's fine innings is ended. A length delivery just outside off stump, just shapes away enough to take the outside edge as Amla looks to angle it away. It was dying into the cordon. Wouldn't have reached first slip. Chandimal dived across and got his glove to it. Is rightly delighted with that grab"
"back of a length, takes the thigh guard"
"wider outside off, left alone"
"on off stump, gets forward and defends"
"fuller, some late shape, left alone"
"edged, through the slips! A length ball angled across, de Kock feeling for it a touch but the ball goes wide of third slip"
"short, wide outside off, de Kock has a flash without much conviction"
"just forcing it a little, this is sprayed wide outside off"
"that's a wonderful shot, a effortless whip through midwicket as he takes a ball from middle and off"
"back of a length, tucked off the pads to long leg"
"given caught down the leg side, but Vern has <B>reviewed</b> straightaway. Rod Tucker the umpire. Short of a length, angled into the body, Philander had a poke and it. Did it tickle the glove? Looks like hip on the first replay. Ah, well, this is interesting. It has touched the glove but the glove is off the bat handle. Fantastic review if that's why Philander called for it"
"short of a length outside off, forced into the covers"
pushes a length ball into the covers
"my goodness! This has leapt off a length. How do you play that? This has spat, jumped at Philander and clipped the thumb of his glove to the keeper"
"full, speared down the leg side, good spot by Chandimal"
"full and straight, clipped in the air but timed very nicely wide of square leg"
"drags the length back, at middle and off, defended to mid-on"
"outside off, left alone"
"full, wide outside off, left alone"
"over-corrects his line, onto the pads, clipped to long leg"
"round the wicket, 139kph, full outside off and he shoulders arms"
"edged, wide of third slip! Did he get a hand on it? Was a full ball, Parnell jabbed at it and the edge flew quickly, just evades the out-stretched hand"
"back of a length, this climbs past the batsman but Parnell holds his bat inside the line"
"that's a great shot, gets too full outside off, Parnell takes a stride forward and drills through the line straight of mid-off"
"round the wicket, aiming for a yorker, it's a low full toss which is squeezed to the leg side"
"full outside off, left alone"
"nearly bowled shoulder arms...this angled back from outside off, was a coat-of-varnish job"
"full at off stump, punched firmly to mid-on"
works a straight ball wide of mid-on
"full outside off, driven to mid-off"
"beats the inside edge, comes in with the angled from round the wicket and de Kock plays outside it"

"full and straight, strongly clipped wide of mid-on, bottom hand provides the power and placement"
"back over the wicket, full at off stump, defended on the front foot"
"a short ball, de Kock jumps and plays it down by his feet"
"pushed down the leg side, 143kph, de Kock misses his flick"
"pushed wide outside off, not much on this delivery as he goes two bounces to the keeper"
"back of a length, straighter, extra bounce forces Parnell to pull his bottom hand off the bat"
"this springs off the surface, was wide enough to leave but Chandimal took it above his head from just short of a good length"
"round the wicket, driven square to point off the back foot"
defended into the off side
"back of a length, outside off, played into the covers"
"tapped down the pitch, and ... blimey, that's a terrible shy! Lakmal attempts to ping down the stumps, but almost takes out de Kock as he dives for cover in front of the slip cordon! A raise of the hand as an apology, and on we go ..."
"tucked off the hip, looking for the single. Good running"
"outside off, through to the keeper, good tight line"
left alone
"more width, no stroke"
keeps a touch low as it dribbles through to the keeper. Uneventful over
tapped out to cover
"a late, late cut. Whisked fruitfully through backward point. Well past his body before he popped out his wrists. Top filleting"
"onto the front foot, and push-driven to mid-off"
"a play and a miss, flashing hungrily outside off"
nips back off the seam as de Kock lines up another slash through the off side. Forced to adjust late and fend the ball into the gully
defended back to the bowler
good line and extra nip off the seam as ball beats bat through to the keeper
"width, lines up the cut but thinks better of it"
"outside off once again, Lakmal trying to hold a tight defensive line"
"slightly straighter, draws a defensive push into the off side"
"driving on the up, looking to pierce the covers but not quite timed"
tight line and length
"wafty drive, can't beat the field"
through to the keeper once again
"good line and length, very full, tempting the drive but Parnell declines"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
solid defence
leans forward to poke into the off side
blocked back down the pitch
stabbed down to deep backward point
"outside off, nipping further away off the seam"
defended back to the bowler
another wide waft
"propped forward, picked up in the off side"
flittered down to third man. A productive stroke at the moment
"outside off, that's wonderfully timed through point. Beats point with wristy aplomb"
"on the pads, tucked through square leg"
"on the pads, flicked through fine leg as runs start to come in a torrent again"
"fuller length, flipped into the leg side"
solid defence
"round the wicket, and tucked into the leg side"
"through to the keeper, good pace, beats the edge"
a bit more width and Parnell has a wipe. Doesn't make contact
jabbed down into the crease
"outside off, cut firmly into the off side"
"up on the toes, and punched out to cover"
"round the wicket, climbing off the pitch and striking the top of the pad. Hmm... that's no pad! Hope de Kock is alright ... he could do with borrowing Faf's beast"
"width, chopped through backward point"
through to the keeper
swinging in to the toes as Parnell works with the angle and drives handsomely to mid-on
"edged, and <B>dropped!</B> A hard-handed back-foot steer, and there's only one slip! It would have been straight down second slip's gullet. Instead first slip, Karunaratne, does well to get two hands to it"
worked into the leg side. So nearly the breakthrough in that over
"slashed on the up, out to deep point, and gone! A bit of a shock all round. A short ball, outside off, battered high and hard, and in the thin Highveld air it just carries on drifting and drifting to the man back on the rope. Still, they all count. Blimey, he made a meal of that take ... his chest did most of the work ..."
"round the wicket and that's a lovely welcome! Full length, tight line from round the wicket, nipping late, beating the edge"
through to the keeper once again
nipping away at pace again. No danger of a tail-ender laying any bat on that!
"through to the keeper once more, more pace and nip. Rabada will be enjoying this sighter of the conditions more than Sri Lanka ..."
good wheels from young Kumara
"outside off, a loose drive into the off side"
too much width and QDK lambasts a drive into the off side
"nips back into Rabada, who does lay bat on ball to work it into the leg side"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
"tucked up on leg stump, the ball deflects out to gully"
sliding down the leg side
"crashed high and hard out to deep point, and that is the end of that! A well-judged take from de Silva, running round to his right, and comfortably pouched. Kumara claims another four-for, sharing the spoils with Pradeep, but South Africa have a very healthy total on the board"
"just short of a length, angled across outside off, left alone"
"huge appeal for caught behind! Given not out and the <B>review</b> is called for immediately. He got the ball closer to off stump, but still wide enough to leave. However, Karunaratne was late to pull the bat the bat inside the line. No mark on Ultra Edge and the replay appears to show daylight between bat and ball. South Africa were convinced. Clicky bat handle?"
through to the keeper
"he's hit that one! Not doubt this time. A touch fuller, nipping away outside off, he hangs his bat just away from his body and it's a regulation catch for de Kock. That didn't take long"
"straight, defended and takes the bottom hand off the bat"
"another testing delivery, pitches on off stump and it's a late decision to leave as Mendis trusts the bounce"
"full at off stump, giving the ball a chance to swing, pushed to mid-off"
"pushed across the right hander, left alone"
"full again, Silva gets onto the front foot and finds mid-off"
"touch wider, full, and that's a good shot as he keeps low and square drives through backward point"
"good length at middle and off, 138kph, defended to the covers"
"pushed across outside off, left alone...no swing in that over"
"full and straight, 131kph, defended coming forward"
"full outside off, touch of nibble, left alone"
"a touch wider outside off, good carry through to de Kock"
"lovely stuff, pitches this fuller and draws the drive from Mendis, the ball curves past the outside edge"
"gets straighter again, on middle, defended to the leg side...needs to be careful not to play across the ball"
"pushes this full outside off, 129kph, this time Mendis leaves alone"
"beaten, back-of-a-length delivery angled across but this started around middle so forced him to play"
"a touch fuller, this time it's wide enough to leave alone"
"beaten again, he's finding his range. This is full at off stump, Silva trying to cover for one that comes back and is beaten as it slides across the face"
"shorter ball, 135kph, Silva takes his bottom hand off the bat as he gets on top of the bounce"
"there's the first one which has swung back, although Silva was able to shoulder arms"
"straighter, takes a thick inside edge behind square on the leg side...encouragement in that over for Parnell"
"short of a length, slips down the leg side...Philander indicates he was trying for the inswinger"
"loose, edged over the slips! He chases a full and wide delivery, no chance of staying on control of the shot, bottom hand comes off the bat and the edge flies over and wide of gully"
"swinging away outside off, 134kph, left alone"
"back on off stump, a full length, defended on the front foot"
"back of a length, this zips past the outside edge although Silva may have pulled the bat inside the line. Actually, he was beaten"
"full, wide outside off, left alone"
"back of a length, straight, 131kph and defended"
"nicely bowled, this one angles across Mendis and he's flirting outside off stump"
"fuller, at the stumps, gets a little squared up but the outside edge runs along the ground to gully"
"through the slips! Back of a length, Mendis gets squared up again as he aims to work into the leg side and the outside edge just evades Elgar's dive from third slip"
"full at middle and off, defended coming forward"
tucked off the pads to short leg
"back of a length at off stump, 124kph, Silva shuffles across and defends"
worked off the pads into midwicket
"back of a length, left alone"
gets onto the pads and it's flicked away fine of long leg
"short of a length outside off, plenty of movement but comfortably left alone"
"good delivery, a straight delivery which nips late off the seam and is defended towards point"
"short of a length, dropped into the off side and that's a a dicey single...would have been out if Parnell's kick had found the stumps"
defended to the off side
on the pads and nicely timed through midwicket with a straight-bat flick
"fuller, he comes forward, times his front-foot push sweetly but Rabada springs to his right at a close mid-off"
"down the leg side, clips the thigh pad towards long leg"
"flicked off the pads, bottom hand comes off the bat, sends it behind square"
plays across the line of a straight delivery and doesn't make contact
"short of a length, down the leg side, flicked towards long leg"
"full outside off, 132kph, left alone"
"touch wider, through to the keeper"
"a short delivery and he gets nicely underneath it with a pull, gets enough elevation to just clear the rope wide of long leg"
"back on a length outside off, left alone"
"on a length at off stump, 136kph, defended"
"a bouncer, decent pace, angled over leg stump"
"on a length outside off, 135kph, left alone"
"touch shorter, good carry through to de Kock at shoulder height...Silva drew his bat well inside the line"
"fuller and at the stumps, driven to mid-off"
"ends his first over in Tests with another bouncer, 135kph, it's comfortably ducked underneath"
"wide outside off, a loosener at 131kph"
"short, angled down the leg side, Mendis gets his bat and gloves well out of the way"
"edged, fine of gully! Short of a length outside off, Mendis sparring at it away from his body and the thick edge splits the gap between fourth slip and gully"
"crack! That's a super shot. Rabada goes full outside off, Mendis gets onto the front foot and plays a thunderous drive through the covers"
"back of a length, 140kph, defended"
"full outside off, 139kph, this time he decides against the drive and leaves alone...no need to get greedy"
"on off stump, 134kph, defended to the covers"
"angled into the pads, worked into square leg"
"full at off stump, he presses forward and pushes into the gap at cover"

"full outside off, but not driveable (at least without a lot of risk), Silva defends to the covers"
"back of a length at off stump, defended on his toes to the off side"
"full, wide outside off, 140kph"
edging it closer to off stump but Mendis is again able to usher it through to the keeper
"a bouncer over off stump, he sways out of the line"
"lovely stroke, gets onto his toes and punches a back-of-a-length delivery into the off side"
"well bowled, this climbs off the surface and beats the outside edge...just have to hope you don't nick those. De Kock takes it at head height"
gets forward and pushes solidly into the off side
"outside off, nipping through to the keeper"
"good pace outside off stump, left alone"
"sliding onto the leg stump, tickled fine"
"good wheels, finding his rhythm with a tight line outside off stump"
"very full again, jabbed back to the bowler"
battering a good length outside off stump
"outside off, lifting off the seam and through to the keeper"
"back of a length, nibbling off the seam"
through to the keeper once more
"short and sharp, Silva ducks"
"perfect line, ideal length, thin tickle, through to the keeper. There's the breakthrough! Ever so slightly back of a length, but Silva held his bat in line with little conviction, and the deflection was palpable"
"full length, cautiously defended from deep in the crease. Gully tidies up."
tapped into the leg side
"outside off, through to the keeper"
"short and sharp, Mendis tucks his head into his neck"
"well bowled, lovely late bend through the air from a full length. Poked uncertainty into the cordon"
"very full again, from wider on the crease, angled into the cordon"
"a big woolly whoosh outside off. That was a fraction wider, tempted the indiscretion. Mendis is lucky to survive"
"loose from de Silva too. Trying to put bat on ball, but the ball's not there"
"that's a beauty. Right in the channel, climbing past the splice. Six of those an over, and this innings won't last long"
"swings early, out of the hand, lined up and left alone"
"full length, angled past the edge. Another teaser beats the bat"
"tighter line, angled away. De Kock gathers to his right with wide eyes of appreciation"
"through to the keeper once again, no stroke threatened"
"wide on the crease, angled down the leg side and flicked very fine off the pads. So fine, in fact, that de Kock nearly snaffles it with a dive. Just out of reach"
lifting through to the keeper
"fuller length, a rare half-volley and Mendis doesn't miss out. Leans onto his cover drive and nails it, all along the ground"
down the leg-side
"<B>dropped!</B> Olivier has dropped his maiden Test wicket! full length, chipped back in the air, Duanne reacted late, mistimed his leap, and the chance clanged off his wrists, high above his head!"
"good riposte, beating the outside edge on a tight line"
"full length, fenced down into the crease, and Silva loses sight of it as it bobbles around at his feet. Never close to the stumps though"
"misdirected, down the leg side, Sri Lanka are finding fine leg a productive zone today"
"back of a length, defended with a rigid blade outside off stump"
"full length, attacking the stumps, fenced to the leg side"
worked into the leg side once again
"very full length, on the leg stump. Chiselled back to the bowler"
zipping through to the keeper
angled defence down to third man
"onto the front foot, bending from leg to off, helped into the covers with a gentle steer"
"back of a length, defended"
"very full again, nips off the deck and strikes de Silva on the inner thigh. Ouch"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
"good rhythm from Rabada, in the channel outside off, still back of a length though, so easily left this time"
"fierce change-up in pace! And that's completely suckered Mendis! Pounded into the pitch, attacking the arm-pit, and Mendis flings up his gloves in self-defence, for Duminy to snaffle a simple lobbed chance in the cordon. That's a quality wicket for a quality fast bowler, and now Sri Lanka's resolve will be tested"
"welcome to the crease! Full and fast, and squared up like Spongebob himself, but he gets a thick and safe outside edge, low through the cordon. Off the mark in streaky fashion"
tucked into the leg side and they scamper through
"swinging from a full length, and watchfully worked into the leg side"
"jabbed into the leg side, and just out of the reach of short leg, diving to his right! It's all starting to happen now"
"curling out of the hand, left alone outside off"
"curling through to the keeper again, lovely shape on the ball"
"stabbed into the off side, back of a length"
"driven in the air, and that's cherry-picking for Bavuma at point! Outside off, full and inviting, but de Silva's weight was never as committed to the stroke as his bat. Squirts off a fat outside edge, high to Bavuma's left, and he makes a sharp chance look easy"
"full and straight, defended"
back of a length but arrow-straight. Defended
in the channel
through to the keeper once more
angled into the pads
"outside off, and another pretty dismal waft at a ball that simply wasn't there to hit"
"speared into the toes, well dug out"
"left alone, too wide to tempt a shot - not that that has dissuaded some of his colleagues"
nibble nibble! This one zips off the seam and climbs past the edge. Beautiful shape
"back of a length, more easily sighted this time, and tapped to midwicket"
"tapped into the covers, looking for a crazy single, and getting it in the end, but only thanks to an overthrow! A direct hit would have been excruciatingly tight ..."
"outside off, wafted out to point"
"pushed onto the back foot, defended into the off side"
"lovely tight line, shaping into the off stump, and that's a good leave. Well judged"
"on the toes, strays onto the pads, and tucked out to deep square leg"
"outside off, nips away and keeps low through to the keeper"
"outside off, this one bends back in and again, well left"
"clipped into the leg side, should probably have been a single, but better safe than sorry"
forward and defended to cover
"outside off, nipping through to the keeper"
"well bowled, bursting past the edge from back of a length"
"nudged off the hip and that's sharp work from Cook under the lid, stretching to his right to intercept"
full and straight. Mathews takes one hand off the bat to control his defensive stab down the line
"outside off, threatening the edge once again. Mathews tries desperately not to be drawn into the stroke, but he can't help himself"
"outside off stump, curling past the edge, lovely teasing line"
"on the back foot, tapped into the covers"
worked round the corner
"outside off, and left alone, angling towards the cordon. Rod Tucker has an exploratory look at Parnell's followthrough"
"this one curls back into the right-hander, fenced into the leg-side with a hurry"
...and this one zips the other way from a full and threatening length. Tidy work
"back of a length, poked to mid-off"
stabbed into the off side. It's a challenge out there
"back of a length, defended from deep in the crease"
worked into the covers
"back of a length, nips off the seam and Mathews makes a meal of a ball that he could and should have been leaving"
"over-pitched, and a rare chance to hit through the line with conviction. Nicely placed into the covers"
ploughing a tempting furrow on a fourth-stump line
"that's a pearler. Fuller, straighter, curling late. Beats the edge"
"full at off stump, defended from the crease"
"touch shorter, he plays back and defends"
"extra bounce, Mathews takes his bottom hand off the bat...not sure he's thrilled about the light"
"across onto off stump, plays a back-of-a-length delivery to the leg side"
"round the wicket, outside off stump. Left alone"
"back of a length, lifting sharply, fenced down into the crease. The end of an interrupted over"
"poked into the off side, working with the swing"
"full length, threatening to swing, stabbed into the leg side"
"he chases this one! A hard-handed drive, feet rooted in the crease, the swing saves him as the ball curls round the edge. Loose"
"better, left with a bit of a startled flourish as Philander extracts some extra lift off the seam"
"fuller length, worked off the pads to mid-on"
nudged into the gap in the covers to get up and running for the day
"full length, attacking the stumps. Fended back down the pitch"
"nipping into the right-hander from a full length, tapped to cover and a good early call"
tapped into the off side again
"completely squared up, and finds the gap at fourth slip! That was the perfect line and length to Mathews, who simply cannot help chasing balls outside his eyeline. But no-one could get close to the flying edge"
worked into the covers
"clipped off the toes, that's a tidy shot from a rare loose ball. Whistles through square leg"
"edged and gone! Just too simple for Philander. Perfect line and length, swung through the air, nipped off the seam, flicked the bat and nestled comfortably into de Kock's gloves. That's the early breakthrough. They will want and expect a whole heap more this morning..."
"bustling pace, grazing past Tharanga's edge through to the keeper. Three slips in place for the left-hander"
"full and probing, angled defence into the gully"
"worked off the pads, out to midwicket. They settle for the single"
"edged, but this one doesn't carry to Elgar at third slip. Once again, Mathews is drawn into a stroke he should have been leaving. But softer hands this time saved him"
left well alone this time
pushed onto the back foot by a sharp lifter. Tharanga ducks
pounded into the deck once again. This one sails harmlessly over his head
"fizzer. Fuller and nipping off the seam, across Tharanga's bows. Well left in the end"
"wider line, no stroke offered"
squared up by a tighter line on leg stump. Squirted out to the gully
"another beauty, full and seaming away. Cranking up the pressure"
"worked off the hip, eager to find the single, but not there"
"a rare half-volley, but Mathews misses out. Drilled with power, but straight back to the bowler"
leaves alone outside off stump
leaves alone with another flourish
"pushed onto the back foot, defended back down the pitch"
"outside off, stabbed into the covers off the back foot"
leans forward to defend to cover
sways out of line
"cranking up the pace now, as de Kock gathers with his fingers pointed to the sky"
finds the gap this time to rotate the strike
"full length, Mathews is looking to drive but squirts his shot out to point"
"very short and very wide, and Mathews wants a piece of this. He flings everything he's got at it, but can't quite reach it."
"edged, but short of second slip! Perfect line and length, was threatening the lbw as well as the edge. In fact, that might have flicked the back pad, but would have been going over"
defended
"clipped out to deep midwicket, that's a well-placed stroke. Rabada chases well to cut off the boundary"
"full length, nibbling back off the seam, a huge appeal, and up goes the finger! Mathews <B>reviews</B>. The umpire thought long and hard, the only real issue will be height, as it hit the top of the knee roll ... but hang on, is that a thin inside-edge? Mathews had a chat with Tharanga before reviewing, so he clearly doesn't know he hit it!"
zips through to the keeper. Vernon is looking most miffed at that turn of events
"back of a length and swinging early out of the hand. Mathews winds up for a massive yahoo, but doesn't make contact"
blocked with unease outside off stump
through to the keeper
"round the wicket, very tight line, swinging back into the left-hander, who leaves again"
"on the hip, nudged through fine leg"
"full length, speared in towards the base of the stumps, but worked off the toes to bring up Sri Lanka's hundred"
"stunner! That is simply brilliant from Quentin de Kock! A hard, low, flying edge, scooped in one mitt in front of first slip. Mathews didn't do much wrong there, really. A beautiful line and length that demanded a stroke - he didn't go looking for it. But the ball nibbled just enough to kiss the edge and the keeper did the rest! A tiny bobble as he hit the turf, but that was world-class"
"edged, with soft hands, and it drops short of the slips"
"on the pads, turned to short leg, who is stationed rather deeper than usual"
solidly into line to defend
"that's a huge shout! Tharanga plants the front dog to a wicket-to-wicket inswinger, and South Africa are going to use a <B>review</B>. It is curling down the leg side. But not a convincing stroke. His pad looked as huge as Graeme Smith's against Matthew Hoggard for a moment there"
defended with more circumspection
"good curling delivery, starting outside off and bending towards the bails. Defended"
"Tharanga was anticipating the bouncer, and was utterly rooted to the crease when Rababa instead fired in a full-length inswinger that missed off stump by a whisker!"
"huge shout for lbw, but Rababa knows that that is missing leg. Full and furious though, raps the pad as Tharanga hauls his toes out of harm's way"
smacked in an ungainly fashion into the leg side. They all count
"on the toes, tucked to midwicket"
"attempted drive, but not to the pitch of the ball"
through to the keeper
angled defence through third man. Waited for the ball to arrive and used the pace to good effect
defended once again
full and fizzes off the pitch to thump the front pad. Going over the top and down the leg side hence a muted appeal. But a threatening length
leans onto the front foot to defend
"tight to the stumps, banged in short. Pulled firmly out to midwicket"
"driven from the crease, a bit flat-footed. Midwicket gathers an inside-edged stroke"
"outside off, good pace and tight line. Fizzes through"
"there it is! He's off the mark and that's a wicket for any fast bowler to treasure! A throat-hunting bouncer, got massive on the batsman as leant back to pull, and steepled a huge top-edge for Stephen Cook to pouch just backward of square leg"
"short over off stump, through to the keeper. Sharp"
"full, some with outside off, and Tharanga throws his hands through a drive which goes in the air over the off side"
"angled across outside off, 134kph, left alone"
"short of a length on pads, clipped wide of short leg"
"another clashing drive, full and wide from Parnell, Tharanga reaches for it and places it behind point"
"and now this goes straight of mid-off, lovely stroke, a little full and floaty from Parnell and it's put away off the front foot"
"drags the length, touch more zip in this delivery, left alone"
"on off stump, 137kph, defended towards mid-on"
comes forward and drives a length ball to cover
"a bouncer, Tharanga ducks and the ball doesn't reach de Kock on the full"
"that's flown! Short of a length outside off, rears up to beat the outside edge of Lakmal"
"back of a length, he's behind the line and defends"
"short, down the leg side, he makes a late decision to pull and can't catch up with the ball"
"full outside off, 139kph, left alone"
"fuller at the stumps, flicked straight to short leg who then throws down the stumps but Lakmal hasn't moved out of his crease"
shoved down the leg side again
"full outside off, 136kph, left alone...Parnell could do with a wicket here, just to feel he's in the Test match"
"and nearly has one there, this tails away past the outside edge as Tharanga fiddles away from his body"
"full at off stump, slides off the face through point"
"short of a length, he's quickly on the pull and sends it well in front of square"
"gets this fuller, at middle and leg, defended into midwicket"
"and he's got one! Not how pace bowlers look to take their wickets, but Parnell won't care. It's a full delivery, Lakmal goes for the drive, he's doesn't get that far forward, and just spoons the catch to mid-off where Rabada takes it sharply above his head"
"back of a length on the stumps, defended to the covers"
"edged, taken at third slip! Angled across outside off, Tharanga pushing away from his body and it's a regulation nick which is neatly grabbed by Elgar who just had to move a little to his left"
"play back to a length delivery, runs off the face and lands short of gully"
"almost another nick, short of a length and Pradeep sparing at it without any footwork"
"short ball, almost fended into the cordon...he didn't know much about it. Excellent, angling into the ribs, Pradeep flaps and it and the ball loops off the glove short of gully"
"fuller, at the pads, flicked in the air into midwicket"
"back of a length, playing away from his body and gets an inside edge over the stumps to long leg"
"full at the stumps, defended into the covers and then steal the single"
"this flies wide of gully, not really in control as he pushes at a length delivery"
"and that's that! Spooned back to the bowler, jabbing forward at a length delivery which stopped on him, Parnell does very well to stoop low in his followthrough and grab the ball close to the turf. Pradeep stands his ground, the umpires get together. The soft signal is out as they go upstairs.  Now then, has he got his fingers. under it? As ever, TV doesn't make it clear. Remember, soft signal out so evidence has to be conclusive the other way. And Aleem Dar upholds the catch."
"slips his opening delivery down the leg side, but there was swing there"
"back of a length, outside off, carries low through to de Kock"
"fuller, pushed across outside off, 124kph and he's able to leave it alone"
"straightens the line a little too much, starts on leg stump and swings down the leg side"
"that's the spot, a lovely delivery. Starts just outside off, the left hander covering for the swing and it nibbles past the outside edge"
"short of a length, tucked off the hip down to long leg and he's off the pair"
"vicious! What a start. Unplayable. Just back of a length, this jumps at Silva, not much he can do about it, takes the glove and de Kock is almost caught unawares as he sticks his his right glove to snatch it in front of first slip"
"and another! Almost a repeat. Short of a length, considerable bounce with the new ball and this climbs past Mendis' edge as just manages to keep the bat inside the line"
"wider outside off, 142kph, one he's able to leave alone"
"short of a length outside off, left alone"
"pushes this one down the leg side, perhaps trying to bring it back at the batsman"
"in the channel outside off, 141kph, left alone...phew, that was a decent start"
"short outside off, he plays back and drives wide of mid-off"
"full outside off, late swing, Mendis doesn't play and this"
"did that carry to first slip? Don't think so. Lovely delivery, Full at middle stump, squares up Mendis and takes the outside edge. Doesn't quite reach Amla"
"terrific response, short of a length outside off, Mendis stands tall and punches square off the back foot through the covers"
"lovely delivery, swing, seam and bounce from a full length (it's a tricky combo) and it ends up beating the edge by some distance"
"beats the edge, this is a bit of a loose poke as his feet were stuck in the crease. Back of a length, swings again, Mendis feeling for it"
"full, down the leg side"
"spliced wide of short leg, bounces and jars high the bat, flies wide of Cook under the helmet"
"unplayable, again! This leaps from just short of a length, Mendis drops his hands but the ball is already past the edge. This is as tough as it gets"
"143kph, flies past the outside edge although he may have just pulled the bat away in time"
"goes fuller at off stump, Mendis takes the chance to drive and it gets through mid-off"
"good shot, punches a full delivery straight of mid-on although timing wasn't quite spot on"
"he has it on a string, this tails away past the outside with late swing but Mendis did well not to follow it"
"that's even better! This is a leg-break at 130kph. Pitches around middle and off, the batsman has no choice but to play, and it beats the edge by a good few inches"
"touch wider outside off, he's able to leave alone"
"full, outside off, 127kph and he watches it go through...time for an inswinger?"
"he's judging it well, lets it go through to the keeper"
"touch fuller, nice shape, but wide enough to leave well alone"
"tight line, through to the keeper with no stroke offered"
"full and straight, driven from under the eyeline, back to the bowler"
"short and sharp, tight line and threatening the spice, but Karunaratne plays that one well, dropping his hands and letting it sail by"
"head over the ball, an inside-out drive to midwicket"
swinging down the leg side
"driven with one hand, back to the bowler. Tight and full"
"squared up once again on a full length, and squirted out to gully."
"swinging in towards the leg stump, Dimuth shuffles across his crease to work into the leg side"
"very full length, blocked back down the track"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
"leg-sided once again, flicked fine to Rabada on the fence who struggles to pick it up out of the crowd"
striding out of the crease to negate the swing. Blocked
"well dug out on a good length, Parnell gives chase to limit the damage"
"not such a good shot, leaning back for a cramped cut, but that was far too full for the shot"
"on the hip, flicked fine"
"loose and ineffective. Feet planted outside leg, and a loose nibble with the gloves outside off. Ended up looking a bit like a crane carrying a heavy load"
wafted off the back foot with a diagonal bat. That's a bit ugly
"through to the keeper, Mendis not enjoying himself out there"
"round the wicket, pushed into the off side off the back foot"
"well, it's a tactic, but not as we know it. Mendis is just flinging his bat at everything, and missing most of it. This one fizzes through at shoulder height, wide of off stump"
more circumspect defence to a fuller length
keeps a touch low as mid-off tidies up
whistles through as Mendis charges down the pitch again. Either he's lost the plot or he's about to cut loose in thrilling and unforgettable style...
"another dot, more erratic footwork. Interesting"
worked into the gap on the leg side to keep the strike ticking
"through to the keeper once again, still no danger of meaningful contact from Mendis..."
"pushed onto the back foot, defended back down the pitch"
"that's a snorter, full length, leaping off the seam, bursting past the edge. If there's anything wrong with it, it was arguably half a click too wide of off stump"
"battered! That is a clumping drive, in the air, through the gap, hurtling to the fence. He's connected with one at last"
"on the pads, tucked to fine leg to keep the strike"
punched through the covers with a sudden surge of timing. On the back foot and whisked to the fence
"down the track once again, Philander sees him coming and cramps him for room on the leg stump"
"punched firmly off the back foot, but Bavuma is alert at point and intercepts"
"advancing down the track again, and Philander's length is notably shorter as a consequence"
"fuller this time, but that's a good leave"
"sliced, high and ugly, over the covers and plugs out of everyone's reach behind point."
"oof, that's a beauty. Wobbled out of the hand, on a full and bamboozling length, then zipped past the bat and the edge of off stump. Another woolly whoosh, but with justification this time"
bouncer. Ducked
"short once again, and through to the keeper"
stabbed out to point
"another bouncer, South Africa aren't exactly rattled - how could they be in this situation? - but they've deviated from their straight and narrow plans of the first innings"
"drilled from a full length, a bit of excitement as the ball could have ricocheted off the foot before falling short of the fielder. But safe in the end"
"edged and <B>dropped!</B> Parnell's return makes the opportunity, as Karunaratne fences outside off from back of a length, and second slip, Elgar, shells a low chance in front of first"
"wide of off stump, and that is Mendis' best stroke of the innings. Firm base, no dancing feet this time, just a scything back cut through backward point"
"on the hip, tucked fine"
"nips back in late as Mendis leaves on length. Good ball, good judgement"
"chopped on! Impeccable seam position, ghosting back in and straightening from the angle across the right hander, as Mendis lined up for the cut, but hacked the ball into his own stumps!"
"welcome to the crease, more good shape bending back into the right-hander from across his bows. Well left alone"
"on the pads, tucked into the leg side"
angled defence into the leg side
"leg-stump line, nudged off the hip"
"over-pitched and pumped through the off-side. Karunaratne timed the shot well enough, but not the running. That should have been three"
"wide outside off, a laced cut, played with lots of flamboyance, but not much timing"
"attempted yorker, swinging into the left-hander and pretty well dug out"
in the channel outside off stump
"pushed onto the back foot, poked out to cover"
"through to the keeper, again on a good tight line"
more threatening inswing to the right-hander
"on the back foot, dabbed to short cover. Good running"
solidly into line
defended on the back foot
"worked off the pads, down to fine leg"
turned into the leg side
"sharp pace, raps the gloves"
"well played, that was too full from Duanne, and drilled through the covers. No need for footwork when the ball is a genuine half-volley, and de Silva slams his bat through the line to good effect"
"that's a better shot, possibly the best of the innings, a flick up and over midwicket as Olivier strays too straight. Lovely wristwork"
pushed into the off side
worked into the leg side from a full length
"huge appeal, but muted from the bowler! Probably an inside-edge as Karunaratne is pinned on the pads by a full-length nipbacker."
"crunched to point, lovely echo of willow, but can't beat the field"
angled defence to the off side
nipping in once again and striking the back pad
"big appeal for a strangle down the leg-side, but Faf is unfuffed"
tapped into the off side
whipped out to midwicket and well intercepted with one hand
"defended on the back foot, perpendicular bat"
"sharp bouncer, hitting the deck hard, de Silva ducks"
"banged in short, and hauled uneasily into the leg side."
"onto the front foot, driven hard into the covers. Picked off nicely"
"leading edge, pops out to point but drops just short!"
width and cut into the gully
pulled out to deep midwicket
keeps low on a tight wicket-to-wicket line. Karunaratne adjusts well to keep his stumps intact
"watchful defence, Karunaratne settling into his work"
"driven with stiff wrists, out to midwicket"
"zippy pace, through to the keeper with a bit of bounce and nibble away from the bat"
"edged, and there goes another! A fine catch from du Plessis, leaning across at second slip to snaffle a sharp chance. De Silva had to play at that, outside off, angling back in all the time, and kissing the edge"
"almost another wicket, this bounces from short of a length outside off and takes the shoulder of Mathews bat over the slips"
"full at middle and off, worked into the leg side for a sharp single"
"full, outside off, de Kock takes it in front of his face...Olivier getting good carry"
this takes the thigh pad as it bounces from a good length
"full outside off, driven off the front foot back to Parnell who palms it towards mid-on"
"full at the stumps, 136kph, dug out towards mid-on"
"that's a nice flick, uses the angled into his pads and whips it firmly through midwicket"
"over the wicket, full at off stump, defended"
takes advantage of some width and flays it over backward point
"straighter, tucked off the stumps into square leg"
"on a length at off stump, 135kph, defended from the crease"
"fuller, outside off, left alone"
defends at a length ball and gets a thick inside edge into his boot
"short of a length, down the leg side, Karunaratne has a flick but misses...easy to tickle that to the keeper given the way things are going for Sri Lanka"
"fuller, wide, he comes forward and drives it straight of mid-off, gets good timing even though the bat face twisted a bit"
"drags the length back, on off stump, 139kph and defended to the covers"
"round the wicket, full and very wide, and that's a woeful stroke from the captain as he plays a flat-footed drive a million miles away from his body...ball goes past the inside edge"
flicked off the stumps into midwicket
"short of a length outside off, he's fully in control of this one as he back-cuts between gully and backward point"
"full, angled into the pads, Karunaratne nearly falls across as he tries to work it away"
"that's a lovely shot, comes forward into a full delivery and drives it straight of mid-off...played that under the eyes"

"full, wide outside off, left alone"
"shorter delivery, aims to flick into the leg side but gets it straighter than he wanted"
"fuller at middle and off, pushed straight of mid-on"
"back of length, angled across and nearly finds the end as this bounces"
"short on leg stump, gets inside the line and tucks it off his hip to long leg"
"what a catch! That's one of the greats! A flying Faf at second slip. Short outside off, Mathews flashes with a cross bat. Takes the top edge. For all money it looks like it will clear the slips, but du Plessis leaps, gets terrific hang time, sticks his right hand up and plucks the ball out of thin air. Mathews can barely believe it. Neither can the South Africans. Wow."
"round the wicket, full, angling in, pushed sweetly through midwicket"
"touch too straight, clipped off the pads to long leg"
left alone outside off

"full outside off, 137kph, left alone"
"at off stump, defended"

"pushed into the pads, flicked through square leg"
"full at off stump, makes himself get forward"

"full at off stump, pushed into the on side"
"that's a neat stroke, gets well forward and drives straight of mid-off"

"comes well forward again, this time the drive squirts an inside edge to long leg"
"over the wicket, pushes a length ball into the covers and that's his fifty. A fighting, gutsy innings"
"edged, taken at first slip! Pulls the length back a fraction, it's on off stump, there's still that movement and it does enough to nick the outside edge and it's a lovely catching height to Amla"
"short of a length, pushed down the leg side, passes by the hip as he tries to flick it away"
a bouncer which he ducks
"cleaned him up! Full, straight, Karunaratne going for a drive and the ball scoots through the gap that he left. Defeated by the angle, but he left a huge gate. Smart bowling, though. The bail ended up a fine leg!"
"edged, almost another flyer from du Plessis! But this time he can't quite leap high enough. Herath driving, it's a thick edge but he'd have needed a ladder this time"
"shorter, angled leg side, pulled to long leg"
"full at off stump, driven straight of mid-off...excellent shot"
"angled down the leg side, may have clipped the pad"

squeezes this off a thick inside edge down to long leg
"over the wicket, back of a length, defended"
"down the leg side, de Kock starts ask if there was a tickle on that but it isn't a full appeal"

tucked behind square
forward and defends to the covers
"full at middle, played into the off side"

"sliding down the leg side, doesn't get up much"
"short again, but too short for the Ox's liking"
"wider outside off stump, left alone"
"steep bounce from a full length, raps the gloves"
"tidy shot! Nothing wrong with Herath's ticker, as he leans back to slam a cut through point"
worked into the leg side

"gets hold of this one, whipping it fine through fine leg. As you tend to do in that direction"
thumped into the covers
"anchored on the back foot, an attempted pull, not really middled"
"banged in short, that was quicker and well-directed. Heath swings into a pull but the ball is through him before he can get into position"
"banged in short, fierce pace and aggression. Nothing Herath could do as the ball reared at his nose. Up come the gloves in self-defence, and down goes the wicket, courtesy of a looped catch to gully"
sliding down the leg side
forward and defended into the covers. Lakmal has four balls to face
"back of a length, a bit of a flat-footed waft into the leg side"
"banged in short, takes the shoulder of the bat, and loops over the slips. Streaky but safe for now"
is that you Mohammad Azharuddin?! Sublimely whipped off the pads through square leg. Sumptuous!
is that you Phil DeFreitas? A step to leg and a filthy but firmly struck waft down through third man. They all count!
"leaning onto the front foot, pushed to cover"
"a big swing and a miss. Well, why not?"
more or less into line
hoicked high and mightily over midwicket! No dying wondering on Lakmal's watch!
cranking up the pace
flashed out to deep cover with a cross-batted waft
"on the back foot, anticipating the throat ball, and pushing a length delivery cagily into the covers"
flogged into the covers with minimal footwork. It's over-rated anyway
clunked into the covers
"swashbuckling stuff! A dirty mow across the line, top-edge up and over fine leg. Runs galore!"
"bosh! Fetch me another! Outside off, a wild wallop through the covers, bat spanking backside in the followthrough like Darren Gough at Sydney in 1994-95. Get some of that!"
"banged in short, Lakmal bails out of another pull. Up with this sort of thing!"
""
"that's a lovely drive, leaning into the stroke and feeding off Lakmal's exuberance at the other end. Beautiful"
"less pretty, a loose swipe, but the keeper gathers"
"tucked up on leg stump, and turned round the corner"
"that's a good nut to a man in the mood. Good length, climbing past the edge, and daring Lakmal to take liberties with it. To be fair, he doesn't, and keeps his bat inside the line"
"smashed back at the bowler and <B>dropped!</B> Tough chance, hit the hands in the followthrough rather than an actual chance. But we are hard taskmasters here"
"tight line to the left-hander, defended with caution"
turned round the corner
"punched off the back foot, into the covers"
"smashed up and over long-off! Thrilling shot selection, shame about the timing ... the ball dribbles towards the rope and it's a long old chase to gather"
"leading edged drive past Bavuma in the covers, and through to the rope! The runs are cascading now"
"a beauty to finish the over, zipping through Tharanga's defences as he all but thuds an edge off his knuckles"
"banged in short, and battered with insouciance through midwicket for four. Suranga Lakmal! Remember the name!"
through to the keeper
"cranking up the pace, no bat on this one"
"crashed into the leg side once again, like a slightly disorientated wildebeest"
"gunbarrel straight, blocked back to the bowler"
"short and wide, slashed high, out to deep backward point, Duminy hurtles back, and clings onto a blinder! He turned, gave chase, running fully 20 yards before launching a full-length dive to end a combative stand!"
beats the edge from back of a length
"banged in short, flicks something as Lahiru ducks, and South Africa <B>review</B> for the catch! That definitely took the shoulder, but was there bat first? It seems so, the decision is overturned! An infinitesmal nick. Must admit, I barely saw it"
"a flinch outside off, and through to the keeper"
fierce pace from back of a length. Pradeep doesn't fancy that at all
sharp pace again. It's no fun out there for the Sri Lankans
retreats to square leg to splat a limp drive into the covers
"short again, another damn-you-all-to-hell wipe from Lakmal, who doesn't connect this time"
"wide of off stump, Lakmal goes fishing, but can't connect"
"short again, an ambitious swipe off the eyebrows, a big steepling top-edge, deep square leg steadies himself, and seals a 3-0 whitewash! Lakmal's defiance comes to an end, as does a crushingly dominant South African display"
