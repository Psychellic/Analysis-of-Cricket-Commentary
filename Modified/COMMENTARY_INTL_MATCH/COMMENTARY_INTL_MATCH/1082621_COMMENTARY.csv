"lovely start from Nathu. Full, straight, swinging in, decent pace. Gayle can only defend."
"another fast, flat fizzer on middle, chopped to cover again"
"nice bowling. Tests Kohli with a wide delivery again, like Coulter-Nile in the previous game. Kohli isn't driving today, left alone"
nudged to square leg for a quick single. Gayle labours through.
"too straight again. 143 kph, down the leg side. Off Gayle's thigh pad towards square leg"
"140 kph, back of a length outside off. Pushed into the cover region. Great start from Nathu"
"some movement. Back of a length outside off, seams away. Gayle plays the line. A leave almost"
good length to Gayle early on. Back of a length on the ribs. Worked down to fine leg. He is genuinely troubled against high-quality pace bowling
"tight lines around off, worked to mid-on. No room"
"a big big appeal. Kohli isn't happy a wide was not called. Short on the ribs, pacey. Kohli is beaten for pace and  bounce. Yep, no edge. probably a wide too. Well done Karthik and Lions, saved a run and a ball"
"yikes. What was that? Amazing. Full down leg, Kohli backs away, sees a delivery in his slot and flicks the ball over square leg for six. He used a bottom hand to hit that in the air and with the bats these days, it clears square leg by a distance."
"good length outside off, respectfully pushed to cover"
"on a length around leg, worked to square leg. Giving Kohli the strike in the Powerpla"
"nicely bowled. Sees Kohli backing away, hits a good length on off, pushed to point"
"on a length down leg, mis-hit. Off the thigh pad to square leg. Missed some runs there"
"good idea, awful execution. If you bowl short, make sure it's a good bouncer. Short ball, dug in too short. Loops over Gayle's head and down the leg side."
"mis-timed. Gayle shuffles down, gets a full and wide delivery. Hit back to the bowler. Not good timing"
"a slower delivery outside off, pace off but that's not the right length. Too full. Gayle drives to cover. too full to get underneath"
"full and wide outside off, carved behind point for four. Looked to hammer that but somehow finds a gap"
"drifts down leg, wide called this time"
"on a length down leg, worked through to deep square leg"
"well bowled. Gayle clears his front leg, but Thampi is short. And accurate. Gayle pulls to fine leg awkwardly"
"not great timing but safe. Back of a length, at the ribs. Gayle mis-times a pull over midwicket. Gets two."
"a low full toss outside off, a poor delivery but gets away with it because Kohli is surprised by it. Mis-timed to midwicket"
"he's picked out short fine leg. My, my. The home crowd is stunned into silence. A good length delivery down leg, quite a bad delivery but Kohli pulls and finds short fine leg. The only man there. Didn't keep it down or didn't place it. Backed himself to find a gap and didn't give him a failsafe if he didn't. probably overcritical, but that wasn't a good shot. A little bit of arrogance in that"
"back of a length outside off, played towards midwicket. Well bowled, well played"
"and gone first ball. RCB struggling early again. Excellent line, on a length outside off. Gayle just prods at that, the ball kisses the outside edge and carries to Dinesh Karthik. Sensational lines. Lions' tight lines in the previous overs have worked."
"Tye is on a hat-trick again. Wow. What a ball. Head has no idea what happened there. RCB are 22 for 3. These are Test-match lines on a spicy surface. Doing nothing wrong. Hits a back of a length, on a fourth-stump line. Head has to play, it's t20 afterall. But gets a thick outside edge which carries at head height to Raina at wide slip, who gets his hands up and takes a good reverse-cupped catch"
"another back of a length delivery on off, defended solidly"
"just misses midwicket. Wow. A nothing full toss from Tye, flicked past midwicket in the air. Just one. Should have been two"
"lovely bowling. Fullish, straightish, worked to midwicket"
"good length outside off, defended"
"on a length around leg, played back towards the bowler"
"nice shot. Back of a length outside off, pulled to mid-on. Climbed on that length"
"great shot. Back of a length again on off, pulled away powerfully through midwicket. Tye gets across and cuts it off but his momentum takes him over"
that's a better shot than Kohli. He always wanted to hit it over short fine leg. Didn't try keeping it down. Past short fine leg and four more
"over backward point this time. Sublime timing. Arches his back, lets the ball come onto him and then cuts over point. Superb shot again"
"a slower ball on off, worked to midwicket"
"some flight outside off, carved to deep point for a run"
"nicely bowled, flat and straight, worked to square leg for a couple. Placed that really well"
great ball-striking this from Jadhav. Gets underneath the length and lofts the ball over cover. Superb stroke again
nudged to short fine leg
"flat, quick and straight, worked away towards midwicket. AB calls jadhav through even though he was on the back foot. Fantastic batting"
clipped to short fine leg for a quick run
"nicely bowled. Some flight outside off, Jadhav wanted to go over cover but the ball skews off the outside half towards the sweeper cover."
"flat on the pads, worked to deep midwicket. De Villiers has been handicapped by these wickets too, this is all he can do"
"runs down, gets to the pitch of the flight and drills a drive to long-on"
"that's tripe. A rank long-hop, was out of the front of the hand. Hits a spinner's good length. AB thinks he can pull but there are signs of variable bounce, pulled to midwicket"
"the best stroke against a legspinner. Gets down, gets low and nails a slog sweep way over midwicket. Fantastic stroke."
"the flatter, straighter one, worked to square leg."
pushed out to deep cover for a run
"nicely bowled. A Test-match length, full but not too full. Pushed back"
"a big appeal. Flat and straight, AB comes down but misses his flick. Off the pad towards cover. A quick not out from the umpire"
"bad batting. A low-percentage option. All his strokes before this were good options. A late cut is a very risky option when the ball is straight. Jadeja is very rarely not straight. Jadhav tries a deft dab to third man but misses. Clatters into middle and leg stump, not even off, that was how low-percentage that stroke was. Again, Jadhav not giving him a failsafe if things went wrong. It did and RCB slump further."
"flat and straight, blocked"
"pushed away towards cover. A great over from Jadeja, nagging and accurate"
"flat down leg, AB backs away but hits a flick into his own body. RCB's hopes on AB"
"AB backs away again. This was a variation, a seam-up type option but way down leg"
"backs away, it's straight and he flat-bats a drive past cover for a run to long-off"
"an absolute waste. And RCB are in deeep trouble. Flight from Mandeep, played towards point. AB calls Mandeep through even though Mandeep is hesitant. Seeing his partner's hesitation, AB is now flat-footed, wondering if the run is on. But when Jadeja is hurtling towards the ball, there is no time to wonder. Jadeja picks up and hits direct at the batsman's end. That wasn't Mandeep's fault, wasn't AB's either, just bad luck"
"a low full toss, inside-edged towards fine leg"
"a low full toss, drilled to long-off"
"slow and straight, pushed towards cover. Tidy from Soni"
"flat and quick outside off, under-edged. Through Karthik's legs. Great place to play the ball."
"another one. This time wide of Karthik. Flat and wide again, just an under-cut past Karthik for four to short third man"
dabbed to short third man for a run
"quick, straight, flat. Mandeep gets a thick outside edge to short third man. Playing against the spin, not a good option. Almost went past his edge"
"worked towards midwicket. Good running from Mandeep, comes back for two"
"fullish, and flat outside off. A block"
"a slower straight delivery, pushed to long-off. He has used the knuckle ball very well for Gloucestershire"
"good batting. Bat and ball. Good length on off, pushed to cover for a quick run"
nice again. A deft dab to third man
"good length, straight, plodded back towards midwicket. You just cannot have a lull in play in T20s, this is more than that"
"hit towards backward point. A loud 'nooooo' from Mandeep, seeing Jadeja running in"
"a low full toss, worked to midwicket. That should be it for Tye for the next few overs"
"full and straight, Negi runs in and nails a drive past cover for four. Sensational stroke"
"full and straight, nudged to short fine leg for a run"
"back of a length on off, Mandeep misses a pull, off the thigh pad. karthik dives over the ball and concedes four. A rare wicketkeeping mistake from Karthik"
"dabs to short third man. That was full and straight again, another naughty stroke"
the back of the hand slower ball that pitches and moves away from the left-hander. Beaten
"played towards midwicket, 110 kph. Tidy start from Faulkner. That's as good an over as RCB can hope for"
"shooot! 91 kph. Flat delivery outside off, Negi nails a sweep way over long-on. Goes waaaay over long-on. Good proactive batting"
the googly. Nice and slow. Negi misses a sweep this time. Extra revs into the variation results in extra bounce
"absolute rubbish from Soni. Negi makes that shot for himself by attacking the legspinner. A flat, short seam up very wide outside off. Slapped over cover for six."
"good bowling from Soni. Tosses the googly up outside off, in the arc outside off. Negi mis-times a sweep and picks out deep midwicket. Backed himself and slowed that one up. Great bowling. Good knock from Negi too"
worked away towards midwicket.
"short and wide, scythed to deep point"
"flat outside off, pushed to cover"
"just wide of Raina. Flat down leg, paddle-swept towards leg slip. Raina runs around from slip and dives away. Injures himself"
"another good catch. Flat and quick on off, Badree keeps going. Gets underneath the length and sweeps but gets more elevation than distance. The ball goes straight up. Kishan runs in from deep midwicket and takes a good catch"
swept down to short fine leg for one.
"flat outside off, the ball turning in. Aravind pushes this back"
gets across and sweeps towards square leg. <strong>A big appeal</strong> but no says umpire C Chamshuddin. Maybe just outside the line. He says bat
"fullish delivery on middle, pushed to mid-off."
"full delivery outside off, hit out to deep cover for a run"
"good length outside off, carved down to third man"
hit away to deep cover
"Mandeep commits the same error he did in the previous game. A short and wide delivery outside off, a nothing delivery. But Mandeep cuts and finds backward point. A simple catch for Jadeja. Not good cricket from Mandeep. Once an error, twice not just an error"
"fullish and straight, pushed to long-on for a run"
"full and wide, 111 kph, slower ball, carved to deep point"
"short, slow delivery down leg, off the pad to short fine leg"

"shortish delivery and straight, pulled to deep midwicket"
"full and wide outside off, Aravind misses a drive. Beaten"
"full and straight, pushed to mid-off. No run."
"good length outside off, pushed away towards cover. Jakati, the sub, picks up and effects a direct hit at the batsman's end"
"good length down leg, pulled down towards short fine leg. A couple more"
a slower ball that goes over the stumps. Knuckle ball maybe. Aravind runs down and misses a slog
"slower ball outside off, pushed out to cover. McCullum picks up, misses the stumps at the batsman's end but Karthik saves on by running across to mop up"
"126 kph, full down leg. Aravind misses a pull, struck on the pad. Towards fine leg for a leg bye. Tye finishes with 4-0-12-3"
"fullish and wide, sliced to point for a run"
"full and straight, looking to get underneath the bat. Pushed to mid-off. Just one"
nails a lovely cover drive to the sweeper cover. Pace off the ball
"hit past cover for four. A low full toss outside off, driven away in the air but wide of the fielder. Vital runs"
"pushed away towards cover. Choudhary labours for one. Raina runs in and fumbles the ball, then slips and slides his way to the ball. By that time, two are completed"
flicked past short fine leg for a run. One more.
"slower ball outside off, hammered to long-off."
"108 kph, slower ball outside off, inside-edged towards the keeper for a run. Karthik gets across but misses the stumps at the bowler's end"
hit away to long-on for a run
"111 kph, makes it look soooo easy. A slower ball outside off, Aravind lofts the ball towards long-on. Not great timing. McCullum moves back, takes a reverse-cupped catch, sees his momentum is taking him over so he throws the ball up, comes back in and takes it. Such an easy catch he makes it look."
"a wide yorker outside off, goes past the bat. Dot ball"
"full and wide, hit to long-off. Chahal runs back for the second but McCullum throws the ball to Karthik who takes off the bails to find Chahal a few feet short. <b>This is the first time RCB have been bowled out in consecutive games</b>"

"speared slightly short and outside off, Kishan steps back and flat-bats it away straight of mid-off"
"pitched up and shaping away outside off, Baz pokes at it and watches the ball beat the outside edge"
"Baz backs away outside leg, this is a back of a length ball, which climbs over the stumps, Jadhav can't deal with the bounce either as the ball bobbles out of his gloves"
"back of a length, kicks at Baz's chest. He hops and fends it to midwicket for one"
"extra bounce for Aravind again. Length ball outside off, rises sharply from there, and skirts past the outside edge. Jadhav hops to glove the ball now"
"Aravind errs in length again. Overpitched and outside off, Kishan plays a lovely back-foot drive through the covers"
"full and nibbles away outside off again, Kishan is pinned to the crease as he hangs his bat out and is beaten"
"Baz ventures outside leg, Badree follows him with a quick, full ball, which is dragged to short fine leg off an inside edge"
"95ks, half-tracker on middle, Kishan goes on the back foot and pulls it fiercely off the hips. Smacked over square leg. There is no protection in the deep there"
"<b>pinned plumb in front</b>. This was the full, straight ball, Kishan dares to play across the line. He can't put bat on the sweep, though. The ball skids onto rap the front pad below the knee-roll. This was clattering into the middle of middle stump. That was how plumb it was"

"sliding across off, late cut away to point again"
"another length ball, skids across off, Raina bunts it to midwicket for one"

"Raina nearly drags it back onto the stumps. Back of a length and outside off, Raina aims a pull, gets a bottom edge onto his pad, and gets away"
"Aravind tests Raina with a bouncer that flies through outside off, too high. Raina evades it, and that's a wide for height"
"Raina shimmies down the track, Aravind sends down another bouncer, this climbs over the stumps. Raina goes airborne, slashes and misses. Second bouncer of the over, so a no-ball"
"that's the perfect ball. Off-stump yorker, swings in a touch, Raina gets his bat down and digs out to point"
"Raina uses his feet again, this is shorter and just outside off. Raina has a big swing.... and does not make contact"
"Long-on was the deep, Baz dares to take him on. He only miscues it to de Villiers. <strong>Two in two for Badree</strong>. Baz makes some room and jumps down the track. He can't get close enough to the pitch. Drags a catch to long-on"
"possibly a googly, swerves in to hit the pad"
"<strong>Finch hits the roof!</strong> Floated up outside off, Finch lays into it, slog-sweeping it over midwicket. Bam"
