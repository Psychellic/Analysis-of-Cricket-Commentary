"beauty of a delivery and he brings out the snake dance. Taylor is gone and this is a body blow for Zimbabwe. Lovely, lovely delivery. Got this to drift in from round the stumps, drew Taylor forward but he made the grave mistake of feeling for the delivery without covering the line. Played inside the line as a result and saw the ball deviate just a wee bit to beat the outside edge and crash into the stumps. As a left-arm spinner, you can't bowl a better delivery. Bangladesh are on top with that wicket. Superb from Nazmul, that would've made spin bowling coach Sunil Joshi mighty proud."

"poor, poor running. Driven past the diving cover fielder. There was never a second, but they still decided to chance one. Excellent work from the wide long-off fielder who charged in and released the ball in a jiffy at the correct end. The throw to Mushfiqur wasn't all that accurate, but Mushfiqur did well to take it on the full and then lunge towards the stumps and break it airborne. Masakadza was miles short and Zimbabwe have lost a third. Outstanding glovework. Brain freeze from the batsman. Imrul having a dream day, he can do no wrong."
