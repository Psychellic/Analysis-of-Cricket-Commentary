"Hamilton Masakadza backtracks from mid-off and completes an excellent overhead catch. Hafeez skips down the track and aims to hoist Jarvis over the Zimbabwe captain's head. But, Jarvis sees the advancing batsman and digs this one into the middle of the pitch, finds some extra bounce and foils the timing. Spliced in the air. Over to you, Hamilton"

here comes Fakhar: down the track and hoicks it to mid-on off the inside half
"here comes Fakhar again: he steps out, makes some room, this is a turning offbreak from Nyumbu. He is nowhere close to the pitch but manages to slice it over long-off for six"

"very full and angling across off stump, smeared away to the right of short cover and left of sweeper cover"

"lifts it over the infield, having made room outside leg stump and the full ball on leg stump is carved over point and it skips all the way to the boundary"
races down the pitch to smack a length ball to the long-on boundary. Sensational from the Pakistan captain. The quickness of his feet...
"draws a wide down the leg side and the keeper mucks it up as Sarfraz leaves, gleefully. Five wides"
"full on off stump, blocks towards point. Sarfraz wants a single, without realising Chigumbura at point was far too close. Just about makes it back"
"full on middle and off, blocks"
"<b>leading edge</b> and a simple catch at cover! Gorgeous work from Chisoro, holding the length back a touch, pulling the pace off the ball too. Sarfraz plays the original line of the ball, drifting into leg stump, looking for a single to midwicket. He's early on the shot and he's off to the dressing room early as well"
stands still against a very full delivery on off stump - no feet really - and plonks it to mid-off
"<b>run-out chance</b>! And it comes off a low full toss, which Zaman steers to the left of cover and hares out for a single. He's more than halfway down, not realising Malik has no interest in the run at all. Eventually he stops, turns, sprints for dear life and makes his crease. Poor throw in from the captain Masakadza"

"full and outside off, Zaman launches it to the sweeper cover"
"shortish on off stump, and Malik picks that length ever so early, rocking back to punch to long-on"
"<b>mis-hits</b> it over the top of the bowler! And it carries all the way - despite his being a bit off-balance. The bowler sees him coming down the pitch and shifts the line wide outside off, to possibly stump the left-hander. But Zaman reaches out and smashes it over long-off. It was shots like these that won the Champions Trophy for Pakistan"
"good length ball on off stump, cuts behind point"
"too short, too far down leg and Malik helps it on its way to the fine leg boundary. Easy-peasey"
"gorgeous work! This is by no means short. Or even too far wide outside off. But Malik is able to slink back into his crease and play a superb late cut. Muzarabani has a bit more work to do, and he just about flicks the ball back before the rope"
another gimme ball - short and wide outside off - and Malik crashes it to the point boundary to become <b>only the third player to get to 2000 runs in T20I cricket</b> after McCullum and Guptill
""
"full on middle and leg, squeezes it out to deep midwicket"
neat little flick off his toes for a single to deep midwicket

"another slower ball, but it's short, and Zaman makes himself the room he needs to hammer it to the left of the sweeper cover. It's about to skip away to the boundary but Musakanda throws himself headfirst at the ball and flicks it back, much like McCullum used to do in the 2015 World Cup. Superb cricket!"
"good length and simply zips through outside off with extra bounce, Fakhar top-edges a cut fine of short third man for four"
"really full on middle, not much turn either way, smoothly driven down to long-off for one"
"tossed just a shade outside off, Malik lunges out and eases a single to long-off now"
"<strong>Dropped by Jarvis diving to his right from wide long-on</strong>. Talking about adding injury to insult. Jarvis collapses in pain. Pushed through outside off, Fakhar Zaman clears his front leg and hoicks it over the leg side. The physio is out to tend to Jarvis and now he leaves the field. Hit flat and hard, and Jarvis has injured his bowling hand. Zimbabwe can't afford any more losses. They've already lost as many as five frontline players, including Raza and Cremer"

Chisoro floors the leg stump and pumps his fist. Back of a length and fizzes off the pitch - quicker dart from the left-arm spinner - Fakhar looks to muscle it over the leg side but loses his shape in the process. Chisoro sends the leg stump cartwheeling. What a sight for a bowler!

"pretty full on off again, slower one, Ali reads it. He gets underneath the length and crisply drives it over the bowler's head. Lands just in front of the sightscreen"
"looks like a slower legcutter outside off, good length, Ali does not read this change-up. He swings, loses his shape, and does not make contact with the ball that swerves away in the channel"

"dipper on the leg stump, a la Dwayne Bravo, swiped away to cow corner"
