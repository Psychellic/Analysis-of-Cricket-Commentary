"oohhhh, nips back in a touch off a length as Abid gets a thickish inside edge to square leg"
"full outside off, in search of some swing back in but there isn't much yet., Abid leaves"
good leave once again to a full delivery that's slanted across
shows the full face of the bat to defend back
hint of swing and that's nicely clipped off his pads to the deep midwicket region where Mitchell runs and slides across to pull it back in
"squirted to square leg for a quick single, a very risky one at that once again"
"nicely defended, bat close to the body as he shows the full face"
"<b> full, late swing, got him! </b> Ripper from Southee. Yorker-length, Masood gets an absolute toe-crusher and is plumb. But <b> Masood reviews nonetheless. </b> Burns one as well, that was a very poor call to refer. Stone dead. No other way of describing that. Hawkeye shows that would've smashed the middle of the middle stump."
gift of a first delivery and Azhar is away! Half-volley on the pads and he flicks it into the gap at square leg
"good leave, squares him up with some movement off the seam"
tight leave outside off
"late inswing for Boult, Abid presses half-forward as he pushes this to mid-on. Needs to be careful with that front pad"
shuffles across a touch as he lets this full delivery go
"once again goes full and wide, no swing back in, watched through to the keeper"
"slants one across again, no swing back in, left alone"
"full and outside off, left alone"
whipped away uppishly into the gap at square leg. Juicy half-volley and put away for the first boundary of the morning
"full and shaping away, Azhar gets a good forward stride, covers the line and pushes this into the covers"
"slips this down leg in search of late inswing, through to the keeper as Azhar fails to flick it fine"
"shortens his length a touch, leaves him, left alone"
"full and moving away from outside off, there for the drive if he wants, but Azhar is happy to leave"
"touch further from a length outside off, left alone"
this one nips back in and Azhar squirts it to fine leg off an inside edge
"<strong>saved by an inside edge!</strong> Pitched on middle and off, came back in to strike Azhar on the pad. But for the inside edge, a very thin one at that."
"<strong>very close to that pad again!</strong> Full, swings back in alarmingly, Azhar closes the bat face early, gets a leading edge that rolls to mid-off"
"bunts this with an angled bat and with soft hands, rolls to third slip"
"swings back in, looks to drive but he doesn't account for the late inward movement, rolls back off a thick inside edge"
drops his gloves and watches this length ball slanting away through to the keeper
much better control as he rises with the bounce and turns this into the leg side
"well-controlled pull, all along the ground, to the square leg boundary. Banged in short, got into position very quickly"
"full, swinging away a bit too much from outside off, Watling collects in front of second slip. So much swwwwwwing"
"spears one in full on middle, late movement away, well dug out by Azhar"
whips this off a length on middle to square leg. Southee looked for some inswing by going wide of the crease but got the length wrong
"toe-ends a drive past third slip, lucky break. Could've gone pear-shaped. Streaky"
squirts this full delivery to mid-on
"appeal as he's struck on the pad, not given. NZ don't review. Struck on the flap of the pad as this nipped back in off a length."
"jaffa! Pitches on a length and holds its line this time, Abid lucky to not nick that"
"lovely balance and poise as he puts this away to the midwicket boundary. Late movement in but in all fairness, this was a leg-stump half-volley. Nice shape from Abid as he put that away"
"slants one across, left alone"
sways out of the way of this short ball angled across
gets well forward and defends back to the bowler
punches this length delivery to mid-on
"full and swinging away from outside off, left alone"
"searching for swing as he goes full, Azhar covers the line nicely as he defends"
"length outside off, left alone. Southee shortened his length that time"
"wants the single, sent back. Not for the first time today. Southee went wide to bowl a length ball angling in, Azhar squirted it to midwicket off a thick inside edge"
stands tall and bunts this back down the pitch
squeezed off an inside edge to square leg. Pushed outside the line of that delivery again
"angles a full delivery across, left alone"
"lovely drive, even better stop at mid-off, diving to his right. This was full, nearly a half-volley and he drove it nicely down the ground"
<strong>beaten on the inside edge</strong> as he pushes at this delivery with hard hands. This one nipped back in from outside off
"full and angled across, left alone"
"length ball angling away, Abid leaves"
"there for the drive outside off, Azhar lets this pass"
"on drive right out of the top drawer! Overpitched on middle and leg, Azhar shows the full face of the bat as he meets that on the half-volley"

"short of length delivery outside off, left alone"
"in that off-stump channel, excellent leave"
"goes full on the stumps from wide of the crease, defends back"
"poke and a miss. No need to play at that at all. Length, lifter outside off, <strong>Abid fishes and misses</strong>"

whizzes past the outside edge as he prods forward half-heartedly
"thick outside edge that runs all along the ground past gully, played it with an angled bat"
"beaten on the inside edge this time, awkward bounce means this would've missed the stumps"
"dug in short on middle, Azhar ducks under it"
"full and swinging away from outside off, left alone"
flicked to long leg
that should give him immense confidence! Straight down the ground to bisect mid-off and mid-on
"nips away off the seam, he defends"
worked wide of square leg for a single
right behind the line as he defends
<strong>edged and just wide of gully!</strong> Azhar on the move as he pushed hard at that one with an angled bat. Flew at watchable height but just wide
"the inswinger gone wrong, ends up being a full toss and Azhar wrists this into the gap at square leg. Back to back boundaries"
"bowls too far wide outside off, left alone"
"<strong>loose from Azhar</strong>, chasing a full and wide delivery to be beaten"
good leave this time as Jamieson angles one in from wide of the crease
"settles into a good line on off stump, Abid defends to cover"
"<b>outside edge but short of gully</b>. Henry is sublime with the away-going delivery. He uses both swing and seam. Here it's seam. Abid is forward to try and defend a ball angled into his off stump, but he's surprised by the movement and softens his hands just well enough to survive"
"good length, outside off, no shot"
excellent leave again. Azhar getting back to basics after all but unravelling against Kyle Jamieson
"nicely controlled glide behind point, waiting for the short ball outside off and running it off the open face"
short ball on a soft pitch so it just sits up to be whacked through the covers. Hagley's taken a bit of rain over the last few days so the outfield's slow
lets go a short of a length delivery outside off
defends a full ball angled into off stump. That might give him a little confidence facing the tall and totally awkward bowler.
"goes short and at the body, Azhar is hopping up and is off his feet as he makes contact with the ball, defending it by his feet"
"lets go a good length ball outside off that wobbles terribly on Watling, who has no chance of collecting it"
digs it in but it's way outside off to draw Azhar into any kind of trap
"great take from the keeper, diving to his right and getting it one-handed. Plenty of bounce from the 6'8' fast bowler, and loads of seam movement away from the bat too. Azhar, wisely, makes sure he has nothing to do with it"
"<b>flies past gully</b>! Abid has grown in confidence. He's played a couple of crisp shots. And because of that he thinks he has a ball in his area, even though it's on a good length and his front foot gets nowhere near it. He's reaching out way in front of his body and the outswinger takes the edge and races past Nicholls diving to his right"
"pitches it up on off stump, he drives to cover"
blocks a shortish delivery on off stump
defends a good length ball on off stump
"plenty of swing after it passes the bat, making Watling's life very difficult outside off stump"
"<b>appeal for lbw</b> but umpire Gaffaney shakes his head and New Zealand aren't interested in a second opinion. It was a good ball, cutting in at off stump on a good length. The batsman is pushing with hard hands, losing his balance. But even so he manages a little inside edge before it strikes pad."
pitches it way outside off to give it all the space it needs to swing in. Maybe a little too much given Azhar leaves so easily
"<b>ripppaaaahhhhhhhh</b>. Azhar is squared up. He's pushing with his hands. He's lucky not to nick it. And in the end, a back of a length ball that bounces violently, and also straightens sharply, ends up a non-event"
full on middle with a tinge of movement away. Azhar looks to push it towards mid-on and gets a leading edge to the left of mid-off
"full and outside off, good leave"
defends a good length ball on off stump
"cramps him with a good length ball that rises, and also curls in, at Abid from way outside off. A potential punch into the off side becomes an awkward nudge behind square leg"
"he flashes outside off and is comfortably beaten. There's a little shimmy down the pitch as well to throw Henry off, but that outswinger is on point. Could easily have got the nick"
half an appeal for lbw as he targets middle and leg. Abid is a little late reacting mostly because the movement also happens late. Would have gone down leg
bouncer that he ducks under and Watling can't reel in
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
<b>beautifully whipped</b> through midwicket. A tough too full and straight from Henry and Pakistan have been putting these away all day
nudges a good length ball on leg stump to long leg
"<b>fluent drive</b>, almost getting down on one knee as the nails an overpitched delivery to the right of point."
"back of a length and outside off, leaves it"
"a tiny bit of an outside edge, but it goes straight to ground and slips through between third slip and gully"
"adjusts to Jamieson's weird bounce, flicking the ball on middle and leg basically with one hand"
"good length, outside off, no shot"
"<b>taken at third slip</b>! He has been terrifying to bat against. And now he has bragging rights to show for it. Extra bounce from good length. Balls straightening off the angle. Violent inswing. He has it all. And here, he just pitches it on that 4 to 5m mark on off stump, drawing Abid forward. Abid, who has not shied away from driving at those kinds of balls with hard hands, gets a thick edge that Southee claims with a reasonable amount of comfort"
"lovely shot through midwicket, head over the full length ball on middle, pure timing taking it away"
"good length, moving away outside off, shoulders arms"
turns a shortish ball on middle to long leg
"full on off stump, spears a drive to point"
"gets squared up as he looks to push down to mid-on, but the ball, pitched up and moving away in the air, takes the leading edge to point"
ignores a shortish ball outside off
<b>zips past the outside edge</b>! Zero feet from Haris. It's an overpitched ball. But the swing is its saving grace. The left-hander is nervous. He's not set. He doesn't have runs behind him. He's slow on the drive and he's absolutely beaten
"<b>caught leaving the ball!!</b> What a way to go!! Jamieson is one of the last bowlers you want to face when you're out of form. Especially on this kind of pitch. He goes full. He gets it to move away slightly. Haris is stuck in the crease. But he's also committed to the drive. Again. Finally, he realises it's trajectory is moving across him and so he can actually leave it. Only problem is he takes too much time with his decision and the ball runs off his open face and into the hands of gully"
defends a very full ball outside off with a degree of awkwardness. <b>Jamieson is averaging 8 against left-handers in Test cricket</b>
did he leave that? He seems to pull the bat inside the line as the shortish ball pitching outside leg zips across him to the keeper
think he's leaving this one too. Bat inside the line of the good length ball on off stump and seaming away past the outside edge
"goes very full again, this time on leg stump, Fawad gets a bit of a leading edge to cover"
works the back of a length ball on his pads to long leg. Henry striving for the magic delivery
"lets the shortish ball basically thud into his closed bat on middle, deflecting it behind square leg"
"gorgeous straight drive from Azhar, but Boult at mid-on cuts it with a good dive to his left"
"digs it in way outside off and then keeps moving further, completely complicating matters for the wicketkeeper"
good length ball which Azhar leaves very very very well just outside off -- and it makes Watling leap off his feet to gather it. This pitch is delightful
blocks a good length ball on middle
good solid defensive press forward from Azhar. Looks like this Pakistan first innings is all on his shoulders
"targets the stumps with a very full ball on middle, Fawad turns it to midwicket"
gets up off his toes to flick a shortish ball on leg stump through square leg
ignores a back of a length ball outside off
"<b>absolutely pristine</b>! This is what Azhar has done all innings. Leave the good balls. Be ready for the bad ones. And here is a bad one - overpitched on middle, drilled down the ground. Majestic"
"playing around his front pad against Jamieson's big booming inswinger, manages to turn it behind square leg"
"<b>knocks him over</b>! Literally! Fawad is on the floor! And now he's walking off! <b>Absolutely unplayable!</b> Vicious short ball. Almost gathers pace off the pitch. Fawad doesn't clock it. His hands are only just starting to move when the ball is coming up to his face. That puts him in self-preservation mode, a very human response to seeing a very hard red ball coming right at you. Tries to fend it away. Only gets a glove that balloons to the keeper. There is no way anyone is playing that. Especially when the ball doesn't go on with angle from over the wicket, but actually cuts into the left-hander, cramping him violently"
"good length ball, defends towards point"
"<b>gets to a bright and brilliant half-century</b>! Once more, it's a classy straight drive, taking advantage of the bowler's mistake as he goes too full, as he goes searching for the magic ball."

"back of a length and angled into the right-hander, Azhar is off his feet as he tries to flick it - and even though he is very good with that shot, Jamieson's extra bounce foils him."
"back of a length and outside off, ignores it as he should."
"<b>incredible bowling</b>! Unplayable bowler! In these conditions at least. This Hagley pitch is settling in nicely. Providing the quicks with extra bounce - a weapon Jamieson is naturally suited to use. He hits the deck on a good length, angling the ball into off stump. That's a line Azhar can't leave. He has to play. He tries to defend. But it rips away past the outside edge. And that's probably the best outcome for him. It's a ball that's too good to nick"
"what a start after the break! Down the ground, very nicely stroked. In all fairness, it was a gentle full toss that was simply bunted down"
defended back down the pitch
"bck of a length on middle, defended from the crease"

"<strong>sliced over gully, this one's a lucky break!</strong> Sees the width and chases this full and wide delivery with hard hands, just over the outstretched hands of Nicholls"
off the pads? Yes. Tickled nicely down the leg side to the boundary.
"gets it through, into the gap between cover and mid-off, lovely timing"
"<strong>corker of a delivery!</strong> Rizwan unsure if he wants to press forward or back, hangs his bat out as this one nips away to beat the outside edge"

"slants in a length delivery, defended towards mid-on"
solidly defended to point
"big appeal for caught behind off an inside edge, Rizwan poked away from the body. <strong>Williamson reviews with two seconds to go</strong>. Flat line on snicko as it passed the bat, so the sound was of the ball hitting the pad on the way through to BJ Watling. <b> New Zealand lose a review </b>"

"full and wide outside off, left alone"
eased wide of mid-on for a quick single
"shapes away quite nicely, left alone"
"can say there's a hint of risk with that as he punches away from the body, but the timing and placement is superb to pick the gap at backward point. Lovely transfer of weight back to play it as well"
excellent leave outside off to finish the over
"slants one across Azhar, who lets it go"
"right in the slot to drive, thinks of the stroke but let it go in the end"
"no swing, slanted across again, Azhar's back leg kicks up as he shoulders arms. <strong>What's with the leaves these days? Smith, Labuschagne, now Azhar</strong>"
driven to mid-on with a straight bat
"defends with the bat close to the body, solid stuff"
"dangerously close to the off stump, Azhar close to leave it on instinct but this one came back in, nearly even flicked the pad"

"width on offer, left alone though"
nips back in to hit him high on the thigh pad as he looks to defend
"short of length outside off, gets it to lift off the deck, left alone"
"<strong>huge trouble in the running!</strong> Rizwan pushed it to point and stood his ground, Azhar took off and was more than halfway down the pitch when Rizwan finally moved, the throw came at the bowler's end eventually but Rizwan was just in having decided to complete the run.

"defends away from the body, poked at it but wanted to leave initially"
"gets into an awkward position in trying to pull, hangs his bat up in the end, rolls wide of midwicket"
"driven down the ground beautifully! Nothing wrong with that, Henry overpitched and Rizwan was upto the task. Through mid-off"
saved by an inside edge! Prodded outside the line of this full delivery
"width and he's hit that hard into the gap at cover, they'll scoot back for a third"
<b>outstanding half-century</b> from the Pakistan captain. It's his third in a row and all of them have been characterised by a fierce determination and the placing of a high price on his wicket. Gets there with a gorgeous drive to the long-off boundary and soaks in the applause
"<b>climbs on him</b>, while also cutting into him from outside off. Rizwan manages to work it away towards square leg"
sweetly driven into the covers
"he's really pitching it up there, and Rizwan is more than happy to keep thumping those drives back"
"that's the change-up - the shorter ball, outside off, nipping away. Rizwan is half interested before he rapidly pulls his bat away"
<b>ripppaaaaaahhhhhh</b>! Hits the deck hard. The angle into off stump demands a shot to be played. Rizwan is desperately squared up as he tries to defend; as he tries to deal with a ball that not only bounces on him but also decks away past his outside edge
defends a good length ball on off stump
"<b>outstanding keeping</b>, Watling diving full length to his right to stop a ball that swings after it passes the batsmen who leaves it outside off"
"lovely flick through midwicket. Azhar's balance when he plays that shot, the way his head is perfectly over the ball, and how he more or less uses a straight bat is exquisite"

"back of a length and outside off, no shot."
gets up off his toes to knock down a shortish ball on middle stump
"<b>lovely shot</b>! Absolutely no fuss. Just sees a short ball on leg stump and calmly pulls it, on one leg, to the left of the fielder at long leg"
"<b>caught behind</b>! Oh he is so very good. The lines he bowls. The number of deliveries that he makes the batsmen play. That's the key. Otherwise you can have all the extra bounce, generate all the seam movement and it'll all be for nothing. Here Jamieson targets off stump. Rizwan seems to be playing inside the line. Hopping in his crease. Pushing at the ball. Totally off balance. That's why he gets an outside edge to a ball that comes into him off the pitch"
whips a short ball off his hips to long leg.
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
"good length ball outside off, doesn't need to play at that either"
"sneaks in the pitched-up inswinger, but Ashraf is ready, defending confidently"

<b>dropped by Taylor</b> at first slip! And it's a dolly too! Genuine edge. Henry's been taking those but they've rarely gone to hand in this game. This one though goes straight to a fielder. Straight in and straight out. Ashraf survives to drive on the up again

""
turns a fuller delivery on middle stump through square leg
<b>this should be illegal</b>! It really should. How can a set batsman be made to look so ungainly?! That's not right. That's just not right. Jamieson hits the deck. The angle into the batsman puts him in danger. He has to play to protect himself. But then the ball straightens and rips past the outside edge
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
<b>masssssssive inswing</B> and Azhar Ali is a brave man to leave it outside off stump.

lets go a short ball outside off stump
"yorker on leg stump, turns it away through square leg. Boult gets in a direct hit but he's safe"
<b>whacks it through midwicket</b>. Counter well and truly on. Ashraf is not holding back. Not even against the best bowler of the day. Sees it short and pulls it authoritatively. Brilliant batting.
"<b>cuts in and hits him in exactly the worst spot possible</b>. Azhar slumps to the floor immediately, checking his box. Then he gets up, moves around and back to business."
"good length ball outside off, lets it go"

nudges a back of a length ball on middle to midwicket
<b>guides it through the cordon</b>. That looks intentional to me. Waits on the good length ball to straighten on off stump and lets it run off the open face between third slip and gully
<b>rip roaring shot</b>! He's played a few of these this innings. But this might be his most pristine on drive of the day. Straight bat coming straight down the line of the ball. Strong stride forward. Head position perfect (in line with the ball). <b>Immaculate cricket from Azhar Ali</b>

blocks a good length ball on middle
<b>glorious on-drive</b> from the left-hander this time. There are runs on this pitch. You just have to trust yourself to find them.

zero interest in a back of a length ball outside off
<b>that's much better</b>. Ashraf pitches it up on fifth stump and gets a tinge of inswing as well. Blundell covers for it and leaves outside his eyeline. Good cricket all around.
"<b>cuts in and hurts him</b>. He takes it on the box, or close to it, but he seems okay though. Excellent grouping from Ashraf though. Targeting the top of off stump."

"<b>good shout for lbw</b> but no one wants to review. Potentially going down? Yep, Ball tracking confirms it. But what a ball though.

<b>past gully's right</b> and that brings up fifty for the partnership. It comes off the outside edge though with Ashraf making a fuller delivery hold its line on fifth stump. He really deserves a wicket this spell
"<b>huuuuuuge lbw shout</b> but umpire Gaffaney is unmoved and so Pakistan go for the review. Lovely follow up delivery - full, but not drivable, which is just the worst for a batsman like Blundell who hates coming forward. And even though he's batting outside his crease, and he tries so hard to take lbw out of play by pushing his front foot across, the inward movement that Ashraf generates is so perfect that it pins him in line with the stumps and gets confirmation from ball-tracking it would then go on to crash into them. Beautiful stuff from the Pakistan allrounder."

"<b>taken on the rebound!</b>. Second slip dropped it! First slip takes it! Pakistan have two in two! Only this team can pull off things like this. Afridi who has looked toothless with the new ball comes back and delivers a beauty. The exact kind of ball left-hander's hate. Angling into him, and then holding the line to take the edge. Latham pushes hard at it, which is why it goes to Masood at second slip, who is having a horrible match and it could have gotten worse as he shells the ball coming so quickly at him, but Sohail's freakish reflexes bail him out as he gets down low and grabs the rebound."

"excellent leave from Williamson, dropping down on one knee, and swaying out of the way so that he can see the bouncer pass him on off stump instead of taking his eyes off the ball"
"lovely stuff. The follow up ball is looking for the top of off stump, but Williamson isn't in a giving mood. This is superb cricket. I'm almost sad lunch is coming in like five minutes. Make them play on!"

<b>edged past gully</b>! Ashraf is starting to look legendary! Certainly when he makes a batsman of Williamson's class commit a schoolboy mistake. It's a full ball. But not quite drivable. Williamson though goes after it - and for once he goes with hard hards - and somehow squirts it past Azhar's right.

tucks a shortish delivery on leg stump towards square leg
<b>play and miss</b>! And once more Taylor is rooted to the crease as he goes for a wild slash through the off side. The spectre of the short ball is messing with him.
"<b>drills it down the ground</b>! That should make Taylor feel a little better as the session ends. Pakistan won't be feeling too bad either. Afridi does well here, he knows the fuller ball has a chance of taking the batsman down, when his mind is so obviously preoccupied with the bouncer. Just goes a little too full in search of the wicket and Taylor takes advantage."

"a little nip into the right-hander, and Williamson, trying to flick the ball, wears it on the thigh"
allows a shortish ball outside off to sail through to the keeper
<b>sumptuous drive down the ground</b>. It has just enough to beat mid-on diving to his right and that in a nutshell is Williamson's game. He never overhits the ball. All he concentrates on is playing the correct shot to the ball - which here is a half-volley so a simple extension of his defence is all that is needed
"<b>ohhhh, they almost nabbed him</b>! Pakistan had a leg gully lurking. Ashraf brought him into play with a shortish ball on the pads. Williamson, on instinct, flicks it, and finally sighs in relief as he watches the ball fly past the right of the sub fielder Imran Butt"

blocks a tossed up delivery on off stump
"<b.launches it over mid-on</b>! Williamson is very very good at this; at targeting the weak link of a bowling attack and under these conditions that's the spinner. There is no turn here. So when the ball is tossed up, he has all the leeway to charge out of his crease and lift it over the infield"
"full and wide outside off, no shot"
absolutely hammers a short ball outside off to the sweeper
how is he bowling short at his pace?! Part-timer tries to bully the No. 1 batsman in the world and gets put in his place by <b>a rip-roaring pull shot</b>
<b>and even better</b>! He really switches on when he senses an opportunity and Pakistan are presenting him with one with two not so great bowlers after an entire session of suffocating pressure. This one's full and on the pads and it gets clipped every so neatly to the left of midwicket.

blocks a good length ball and walks off for some tea.
cuts a back of a length delivery that isn't quite wide enough for the shot and as a result can't beat point

"full and outside off, defends it"
"<b>appeal for caught behind</B> but umpire Gaffaney doesn't think so. Pakistan won't ask for a second opinion. Ridiculously good ball though.

"lovely little reverse sweep, getting down low and choosing to play that shot only when the ball is outside off stump, allowing him the leverage to swing the bat"
"<b>direct hit</b> at Williamson's end. This is close. He might be gone. A tossed up ball outside off is swept strongly towards square leg. It's hit so hard that the possibility of a single becomes quite risky but Nicholls wants it. And in the end, <b>a quirk of cricket saves Kane</b>. Only one end of the bail pops up immediately on impact, Williamson's bat is on the line at this point, but the other one takes a while to go, and in that split second, Williamson makes it. Remember, both edges of the bail need to be out of the groove with the batsman still out of his crease for him to be dismissed"

"<b>dropped</b> by the keeper! This combination worked when the bowler overstepped. it doesn't when it's a legal delivery. And a good one too. Afridi's ability to get seam movement is really special. So is his accuracy at high pace. He draws Nicholls into a lazy drive. Thick edge. Simple take for the keeper moving to his left. And yet... Nicholls threw his head back, certain he was gone. Umpire Chris Brown had even raised his finger up. And poor Afridi just sank to his knees, wondering why good luck hates him."
nudges a fuller delivery on off stump to mid-on and Afridi walks away sharing a high-five with Rizwan and patting him on the back.
"gets back and across to flick a shortish delivery straight of midwicket, but as he completes the run, he pulls up and immediately calls for attention from the physio. <b>Is it his left calf</b>?

"<b>third time's the charm</b> and it looks like the first shot in anger in the entire innings.

"targets his body with a short ball angled into him from around the wicket, Nicholls manages to find it to long leg"

"<b>ooooh, he tried so hard. He really really tried so hard</b>. Poor Naseem Shah. He manages to see a plan through to completion. Bouncing Nicholls over and over and waiting to see if his patience runs out. It does here as he backs away and baseballs it down the ground. Shah leaps up and sticks out his left hand, it doesn't stick, but pops straight back up in the air. So he looks to pick up the rebound, diving further to his left, but it doesn't land in his hands once more. So unfortunate."

"<b>half an appeal for lbw</b> but nothing from the bowler. Southee would have been best placed to judge it after he goes yorker against Masood. It's straight enough but the batsman might just have got some wood on it. Actually, it's all wood. No pad."
<b>extra bounce</b> straight away but Abid is able to deal with it; just about as he turns the shortish ball on middle towards long leg
<b>Masood's wretched series continues. Jamieson's also great summer continues</b>. It's a good length ball. It's pitching on leg stump. So he has to play. But this is no ordinary bowler. He gets extra bounce. He gets it to move away. He snags the edge. And second slip does the rest. Masood walks off with a pair in this Test match.
<b>is that a catch?</b> Southee at third slip is testing his little finger. It really is only a half-chance with the ball dying on third slip. It's really Southee's excellent athleticism that makes him even able to get low enough quickly enough to make it even look like a catch. Full delivery outside off catches the batsman in his crease and nearly takes him out

"<b>pins him on the pads</b> but umpire Gaffaney says no. WIlliamson is looking for inputs from his close-in fielders and he gets the nod to go upstairs. It's very full. Abbas is playing all around it, reluctant to push forward because of Jamieson's ability to generate extra bounce. No bat involved but ball-tracking says umpire's call on hitting the edge of leg stump. Very very tight. Jamieson certainly can't believe it. He thought that was plumb."
"<b>eeeedddggggged</b> and it soars over gully! Now Southee is getting balls to kick up! The line is on off stump so Abid has to play but as it rears up on him, he realises he's in trouble. Takes the shoulder of the bat and lobs over the backtracking fielders."

"<b>gives him lbw but Abid reviews</b>. Ridiculously good ball from Jamieson though, especially to start the over. It's full. It's angled in, so Abid is looking to play towards mid-on, which becomes a problem when the ball pitches and nips away. Ultra-Edge though reveals a thin edge. Based on how Abid consulted with his partner before using DRS and his body language signaling it was more high than anything, I'm not really sure he knew he nicked it. Without that nick, he would've been gone."

"full and wide outside off, this time Abbas reads it well and stays away from it."
"<b>sooooooo close</b>! Boult seemed peeved with himself at how that last ball strayed so wide outside off. This one though is perfect.

He sees one he can drive. He goes full-on after it. The only problems with that: the bat face opens on impact and he doesn't keep it down. Will Young is at point. A very close point. His reflexes need to be spot on. And they are as he dives to his right. Full length. And takes the catch one-handed. Pakistan have been droppin em left, right, centre and many other new direction that they might well have invented. Their opposition aren't returning the favour. Incredible work from the substitute"

"knocked him over! What a comeback. <strong>Five-for in the innings, 10-for in the match.</strong> It's the inswinger. From way outside off.

"<b>sublime shot</b>! This is why I'm not sure about peppering him with short balls. Alam's set up is pretty good for back foot play. And though this ball isn't a bouncer, he is so comfortable rocking back and punching through point"
"<b>thaaaat's better</b>. He pitches it up around the sixth stump - that's a lovely line to a batsman like Alam, who has a tendency to get squared up when he defends the ball - this time though he leaves it"

loads up another drive and it isn't too far away from short cover
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
"shapes to pull a ball that isn't really short and is going too far wide outside off. Comfortably beaten. Though Watling appeals. Gets no support. But since it's Watling, New Zealand have reviewed. Ultra-Edge shows a flat line as ball passes bat. So NZ will be losing this review and umpire Brown's on-field call will stay. Which means all the slip fielders will start trolling Watling now. There was already some audible laughter with him being the only one going up in appeal."

looks to cut a short ball outside off and is beaten
"there's another, No. 6 for Jamieson. Set fields for the short ball with two men on the hook and then bluff him with a full delivery angling away. Ashraf sees the opportunity to drive to open fields, plays away from the body as the length does him in, the nick is snaffled up by Watling."

picks the gap between backward square leg and deep midwicket. Powerful pull shot from Gohar.
"<b>whoa</B>! They've sneaked a bye even though the ball is safely in Watling's hands. He had no idea of the sneakiness happening. It takes Southee's yell to break his reverie. And by the time he aims at the stumps, the single is taken. Well done Zafar and Naseem! That puts the batsman on strike for the next over. This is excellent from Pakistan."

Hagley Oval stands up to applaud a band of players who might be New Zealand's best ever. And a new kid has changed everything completely. For now he's not the focus. For now this ball is the focus. Length. Down leg. Slog. Straight up. Simple catch. And the crowd chants No. 1! Clap! Clap! Clap! No. 1! Clap! Clap! Clap!
