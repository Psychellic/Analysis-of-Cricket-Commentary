"hey, howdy, ho!"
<b> beauty! </b> This one nips away off the seam from middle to square him up. No feet movement from Simmons as he feels for the delivery
gets a thick inside edge on the drive to mid-on. Looked to hit through cover but this curved back in late
"floats a full delivery on the pads, worked with the angle to mid-on"
"gives him the charge, but Zaheer's length cramps him for room, bunted down to mid-off for a quick single"
"hint of movement in the air and off the pitch, comes back into middle, Parthiv defends using the full face of the bat"
"firm drive but good reflexes by Rabada, puts his boot out on the followthrough to stop it. They'll take a run as he deflects it to the off side"
"hops back, gets on top of the bounce and taps it gently to short cover for a quick single"
"late on the whip to square leg, the length ball thuds into the thigh pad and deflects to short fine leg"
"full down leg, Parthiv misses an opportunity to flick that away behind square. Played too early, umpire calls wide. Right call"
"short of length delivery on middle and leg, tucked off his hip to Pat Cummins at deep backward square leg"
"not much timing on the on-drive, rolls to mid-on as they complete a quick single. <b.148kph delivery </b>"
"length ball angling away, uses the pace to steer it down to third man"
"<b> deceived by the knuckle ball. </b> Big shout for lbw but not out says umpire Nitin Menon. Good call in the end. Impact was on leg, the ball may have missed the stumps. This was a length ball that jagged back in sharply to beat him in an attempt to work it to the leg side."
uppish but just short of midwicket. Not much timing or power in that bottom-handed whip
"looks to hoick this away-going length ball over midwicket, gets an inside edge to square leg. <b> Simmons struggling for timing </b>"
"hits the deck hard with a length ball that skids onto Parthiv, bat face turns in his hand as he looks to flat-bat a pull over midwicket. Rolls wide of the fielder"
"off-cutter from length around middle stump, worked behind square, Rabada does well to stop that at short fine leg"
"just wide of the man there at short fine. Short and angling in, Parthiv looks to whip this square but gets it much finer. Result in line with what he would've liked though"
"looks to thump this 146kph length ball outside off over cover, made some room again but was late on the shot."
"<b> clean strike! </b> Another short ball banged into middle, Simmons picked up the length early and slapped the pull in front of square. Sailed over deep midwicket."
"walks down the pitch and lofts this over the infield, looked to hit over mid-on but just managed to clear Sanju Samson at midwicket. Bat face turned in his hand"
"backs away to make room and slashes the short ball into the point boundary. One bounce to the fence. Clever batting, improvised superbly"
"much fuller and angling in from wide of the crease, forces one to mid-off. No timing whatsoever on this one <b>150kph </b>"
<b> misfield by Shami </b> at mid-off results in a single. Driven firmly on the up this time
"sets himself up for the short ball, uses the pace, swivels back and helps it over the deep backward square leg boundary. Bowled at 126kph, sitting up nicely."
shuffles across and flicks the full ball on middle to deep square leg
"mistimes the short-arm jab to mid-on. Cramped for room, beaten for pace as well."
"full and tailing into middle and leg, flicked to Shreyas Iyer at deep square leg"
"knuckle ball from around the stumps, looks to force this over mid-off but gets an inside edge that flies past Zaheer's outstretched hands, down to long-on"
"backs away to swing this over long-on, no timing whatsoever on the shot, rolls to the fielder there"
"<b> outstanding effort by Rabada running around at fine leg! </b> Parthiv helps this length ball over the leg side, Rabada had to decide between trying to save the runs or go for the catch. Realised he couldn't catch it but had the smarts to put his hand out and stop it on the slide. Three runs saved"
deflects off the thigh pad to the leg side as he tries to work this off his hip
backs away and slaps the length ball ferociously over cover. Screamer! Wow
"slides a length ball down leg, looks to flick but is hit on the pad. Big appeal but the ball was sliding down leg. They scamper a leg bye"
"too short, Parthiv uses the pace to help it over short fine leg. In his hitting zone. Lovely wrist work"
"backs away and squeezes this into the gap between backward point and third man. Opened the bat face late, superb adjustment. This was a length ball, not as full as he would've liked, still adjusted superbly"
"angles one into the pads, Parthiv looks to flicks this fine, gets some pad on the way to beat Rishabh Pant. The fine leg fielder has no chance and we'll have our first <b>time-out </b>"
"slider that drifts into middle, Simmons gives him the charge and then plays it away to the off side using the pad. Not deliberate though, so a leg-bye it will be"
"short and sliding away from outside off, he backs away and cuts to deep cover"
"googly that spins back in sharply from outside off, defended back down the pitch"
"quicker delivery on middle and leg, turned to where midwicket would be. Mishra runs across to cut that off"
"short and spinning back into middle and leg, pulled to deep square. Didn't get hold of it"
"slider on middle and leg, worked to Rabada coming in from deep square. A slight fumble but they don't risk the second even though Parthiv was keen"
gets on top of the bounce and slashes this away behind point. Not the best start from Mohammed Shami
"angles a short of length ball on middle, punched to Karun Nair at long-on"
"short ball climbs onto him as he tries to make room and slash, manages to steer it just wide of point"
"this was nothing more than a steer again, but so much power on the stroke. Width from Shami, he gets on top of the bounce and does well to keep it down. Just a tiny little gap to hit between cover point and point"
forced off the backfoot to Rabada at deep cover
"looks to help this to fine leg, but the ball lobs on the bounce off the back of the bat to midwicket. For a moment, Parthiv wasn't sure where it went and took off for a single, only to be sent back. <b> He would've been gone if there was a direct hit at the striker's end. </b>"
"full and flat on middle, driven firmly to long-off"
steps out and whips this into the gap between deep square and deep midwicket
slaps the short ball straight to point
"tosses one up finally and gets rewarded. Parthiv has run out of luck. Steps out and looks to wallop this googly over the long-on boundary but didn't get to the pitch and was though with the swing when the ball passed him, neat stumping from Rishabh Pant"
"lunges forward and defends, dipped on Pollard"
"slider on middle from wide of the crease, defended back down the pitch"
"length ball on off stump, punched to point"
"length ball that veers back in, Simmons makes room and slaps this to mid-off. Looked to hit it over the fielder"
"back-of-the-hand slower ball, much fuller in length, looked to flat-bat this over cover but managed a thick inside edge on the bounce to Rishabh Pant. Takes his gloves off quickly and fires a one-handed throw to prevent a single"
"clean strike! Picks the slower ball this time, makes room and slaps this into the gap between long-off and deep cover. Superb"
"walks into the drive, meets it on the half-volley and eases it wide of cover"
"off-cutter that angles back in, he looks to work it fine but played too early. Rolls off a minute deflection off the thigh pad to Rishabh Pant"
"beautiful. Drifts in, hits length on middle and spins away sharply to beat the outside edge. Simmons looked to work this against the spin to midwicket"
lunges forward and eases it with the spin to long-off. <b> Half-century upon return. </b>
"gets under the flight and launches this into the second tier towards the club house. Too much flight, width as well and he was teeing like a golfer. Too much power"
waits for the ball to grip and spin away as he stabs that to the off side
"<b> mistimed but he's just managed to clear long-off! </b> Mishra can't believe his luck. Short straight boundary, Pollard swings hard and eludes the fielder purely on the power he generated through the bat swing."
"this was bowled from well behind the crease, draws Pollard out of the crease in the flight, Pollard can't use his reach to get under the flight, swings through nevertheless and misses. He's got a big stride, drags the backfoot easily back in as the bails came off."
"slower length ball on middle and leg, looks to whip it fine but deflects off the thigh pad wide of the keeper"
"pacy delivery angling into middle and leg, Pollard beaten on the flick. Pace doing the trick, late on the shot"
"floats this full on off, eased wide of the bowler towards mid-on, they scamper a quick single"
"for a second, you thought he mistimed it, but wow, totally proved wrong as this sails over wide long-on. Offcutter at length, Simmons drags this from way outside off but held his shape to clear the ropes."
"flicked towards wide long-on, Shami runs around the ropes to stop that"
flayed into the gap between deep cover and deep point.
"cutter at length on middle, makes some room and punches this towards the man coming in from deep cover"
"uses the depth of the crease to muscle that short ball into the deep midwicket boundary. Another short ball, another cutter, he went back and across to get inside the line of the ball and then pull that away. Sensational"
"he's picked out Samuels at short fine. Simmons can't believe what he's just done. Short, sliding down leg. Once again he was ready to bring out the pull, hit it really well but it was almost as if he forgot there was a man around the corner. Samuels fumbled but managed to hold on in the second attempt."
"finds the gap between short third man and point. Mishra dives over the ball at point, Shami couldn't get to the ball at short third man. Steered it away nicely"
whips a length ball to square leg
"slower and fuller on middle, eased to deep cover"
"straight as a dye! If the stands weren't around. Touch short, he rocked back to flat-bat this over Mishra's head. Didn't look like he got that off the middle but boy, did it fly away or what?"
"looks to back away and go over cover, Mishra did well to fire this wide, missed in the end"
"if the stands weren't there, I promise you this would've smashed into the walls of the fort near Kotla. Too much flight, he got underneath it and blasted that over long-on. Into the third tier and it was still on the way up when it landed there"
"pushed through quicker on middle and leg, worked leg side as they amble a single"
"uses the pace to dab this past Samuels at short third man. Laboured effort to get to the ball, imagine, they got back for a third in a ground where it is rarity"
"fires a full toss on the pads, flicked on the bounce to Iyer at deep square. A meter on either side and it was four"
""
"length on middle and leg, tucked to Cummins coming in from deep square leg"
"right into the blockhole, he backs away to swing over long-on, just about manages to jam his bat down to squeeze that past the bowler"
jags back in to take a thick inside edge to midwicket
"can you imagine him playing the scoop when he can muscle the ball out of the ground? Walks down the pitch, nearly four steps out to try and hit over short fine, sees the ball bowled well outside off, and so he opens the bat face late to help this over short third man. <b> Sanjay Manjkerar </b>, on commentary, hasn't lost his humor. <b> 'Shows his R-A-N-G-E,' </b> he quips to sound of hysterical laughter behind him"
"full on middle, worked wide of midwicket"
"thick inside edge, races to deep backward square where Iyer does well to run 20 yards or so to get to the ball, but couldn't stop it despite a full-length dive"
mistimes a pull to deep midwicket
"top-edges a pull, Mishra calls for it and takes it at short fine leg. Rohit beaten for pace this time as he tried to fetch this from outside off."
"ripper of a bouncer that angles into his ribcage, fended gently"
"tennis-ball bounce on this occasion but lost the direction of the bouncer, angled this one down leg. Right call, even though Rabada may not agree"
"full on the pads, flicks it from outside off to deep square leg"
"length ball nip back in to cramp him for room, defend to the leg side"
"excellent delivery, full and yorker length just around the wide line, Pollard can't use his reach to squeeze that away"
"length ball that he looks to flay over cover, but this one was a little too wide for his liking. Right call from the umpire"
"yorker-length outside off, looks to squeeze this behind point, gets a thick inside edge to short fine leg"
"length ball outside off, hit hard to sweeper cover"
"pulled but  doesn't get hold of it, dragged down to deep fine leg."
"looks to belt this over cover, but can't get any power as he swings to the full toss, Zaheer fires a throw at the bowler's end, no one backing up and they get an overthrow"
"low full toss that he's drilled down the ground to beat mid-off. Fifty, muted celebration from Pollard. Super knock"
"did it slip out of his hand? Looked to fire this wide, ended up bowling it way outside, so much that even the keeper couldn't use his reach to stop it cleanly. One extra run results"
"swings the length ball to deep square, on the bounce to Iyer"
"clean strike! Makes room, gets underneath the slow off-cutter and belts this to long-off. Hits the advertising triangle on the full"
makes room and drills the full-length delivery to deep cover
"right into the blockhole, squeezed to long-on"
"knew he hadn't timed it the moment he hit it. Looked to hammer this over long-off, skewed it off the top part of the pat. Plonks right between long-off and long-on"
"right in his arc, swung away cleanly and with all his might over Anderson's head. One bounce over the ropes, no chance for the long-on fielder"
"looks to swing the length ball outside off over the leg side, beaten for pace"
"<b> Iyer has grassed a tough chance at mid-off</b> What should've been a wicket has resulted in three because he perhaps got a little distracted after misjudging it. Once the ball bobbled out, he took a while to recover. Hardik cramped for room and so he couldn't pull that away, skewed off the outside part of the bat. Iyer picked it early, but perhaps lost it for split-second as he tried to turn. Was on the move as the ball descended on him"
"Pant fumbles as he misses a faint tickle down leg, so an extra run as well. Hardik was alert to the possibility of the single"
"full toss angling in at 147kph, played to the man coming in from wide long-on. No power or timing behind the flick"
crunches a pull but straight to deep midwicket
looks to back away and squeeze it behind point but can't get bat to it
"yorker-length again, just outside off, looks to smack this over cover but swung through early and saw the ball shave past the inside egde"
"yorker-length outside off, Pollard hangs back inside the crease, opens the bat face to drill this to deep cover. Top shot"
"mistimes a swing down to long-on. Looked to smack this over deep midwicket, toe-ended it"
"slices this into the point boundary. Too full, too much width as well, he backed away to to go over cover but skewed it off the outside edge"
"backed away to smash this over cover, but the full ball kept coming back in to cramp him for room but he still managed to generate enough power while trying to readjust and swing over long-off. Strong bottom-hand. Sensational"
"slower bouncer, was through with the pull even before the ball got to him. Umpire reckons it was over Pandya's head. Harsh call"
"swung away into the midwicket boundary. Feeding him to his strengths, short at 129 clicks this time, sitting up nicely for Hardik to muscle the pull."
"floats this full and way outside off in a bid to mix things up, but gets this well outside the wide line"
"beaten for pace, swung through early. This one nipped away late from length to beat the edge. 23 off the final over."
"hey, howdy, ho! We start the chase with a wicket. Seems this game is on fast forward. But oddly expected because McClenaghan had toppled Samson thrice in nine balls prior to today. No. 4 is the result of the batsman smashing a length ball on middle down the throat of deep square leg"
"shortish and outside off, carves it to deep point"
"throws his hands at a short and wide delivery - hand, rather because he takes the bottom one off. Hardik is the sweeper in the deep"
"fuller delivery on off stump, Nair looks to punch it down the ground, but having played a touch early, he skews the ball to midwicket"
"took quick for the pull and a 137 kph short ball, rising up towards his chest, is bunted down the pitch"
a dinky little dab to point helps him retain strike.
keeps in line with a back of a length delivery on middle and turns it through midwicket
"136kph, gets up a little higher than Karun expects, and so he decides not to nudge to midwicket but instead block down the pitch"
"smack in the small of the back! The noise from the stump mic wasn't pretty, but Nair doesn't betray any sign of pain as he tries to pull Malinga away and for that trouble, gets a welt on his body"
"gets up on his toes, uses a straightish face to get on top of the bounce, and pat the ball to short midwicket"
"it looks like Mumbai have made a deal. They get a wicket each over. In return, well, I'm not privy to those details. All I can tell you is that Iyer has miscued a short ball - which just does not give him any room, which comes too quickly on him to adjust - over to midwicket for the simplest catches"
"moves around the wicket, and the sling in his action is wildly pronounced. Rishabh Pant, the man in form, is not perturbed as he pushes the full delivery to mid-on"
"slower ball, at 118 kph, Nair drives to mid-on"
"backs away, and yet he can't get the room he wants to carve the short ball away. Bottom edges to short cover"
"backward point is up, third man is up, the boundary behind them is as tempting as a big vat of chocolate ice-cream. And Nair dives straight into it. Backs away and scoops a short ball over their heads"
"nails a short ball over midwicket. Reads the slower ball early, gets nicely forward, but also keeps that front foot away so that he could swing hard and swing free"
too quick. Too good. A back of a length delivery zings past the batsman's forceful shot
"thwack! He is reading these slower balls like a fortune teller. They must pop up in his crystal ball before he gets into his stance. Now armed with that information, this doesn't look that good a shot really. Just a swing over the square leg boundary"
"back of a length and outside off, Pant mistimes his pummel to mid-on"
"he's done it. He's got his man just like he has on previous occasions. Mumbai making the number crunchers weep with joy. He does that by bowling a slower, short ball on middle, and Pant obliges by pulling it to deep midwicket. Makes contact too early. Pays for it. And Bumrah takes out Pant a third time in eight balls. #Boom"
"back of a length on off stump, steers it to point"
"drives on the front foot, through the open gap at cover"
he cannot decide if he wants to play at this back of a length ball outside off. And in the end the ball thuds onto the open face and runs off to third man
"upper cut. Sublime. Everything about this shot is sublime. The fact that he sways his torso back having seen the ball dug into the middle of the pitch. It's straight, and it's climbing rapidly. This is the ball batsmen top-edge while pulling. Nair instead lifts it over the keeper"
"lucky, very lucky. Anderson somehow manages to squeeze the ball through the wicketkeeper's legs. He plays the cut too early, underedges it and still somehow benefits"
leans over a tossed up ball on off stump and turns it through midwicket
steps out of his crease confidently and flicks a good length ball to short midwicket
"five overs. four wickets. I told you they had a deal. And this was also foreseen by the great number crunchers. Nair falls for the fourth time in 21 balls to Harbhajan. The offspinner earned this, by the way, shortening his length against the advancing batsman. Nair tries to lift it over short midwicket and fails spectacularly"
"tosses it up on off stump, nudges it towards midwicket"
"goes for a flick, but is stuck on the pads. Would be sliding down leg"
"back of a length on off stump, runs it to point"
"belts it away. There is room to free the arms, and those arms have a lot of strength in them. Anderson was belting these every third ball when he made the then fastest century in ODIs on New Years day a few years ago"
"137 kph, makes the batsman hop, and the ball leaps up to hit the splice of the bat. Malinga is steaming in. Dot to short third man"
<b>ripper</b>. He has been accurate and menacing. Now he gets the pitch to do his dirty work. Kicks up after hitting the deck and beats a flailing Anderson
"we're going to have an early night, fellas. Anderson goes after a shortish delivery on middle, but he gets under it too much. Or has the ball bounced more than he expected. I suspect it's the latter as he gives an easy catch to deep midwicket"
"full on off stump, steers it to point"
"<b>beats him</b> as Samuels keeps expecting spin, but the offbreak skids through to the wicketkeeper"
"tosses it up outside off, drives it to long-off"
"keeps to his crease, even against a tossed up delivery, and blocks. Totally squared up"
deceives him with flight again - it's so loopy that Cummins goes for the heave ho over cow corner. But the ball dips under his bat swing and hits him on the body. Lbw appeal shot down because it would miss leg
"<b>doosra</b>, and Cummins reads it as if it is a hieroglyphic. Lucky his hard-handed poke doesn't carry to slip"
mistimes a push towards cover to take on the fast bowlers at the other end.
keeps back and guides a shortish delivery outside off towards third man.
hangs back and punches a flatter delivery outside off to point
nudges the flatter delivery through midwicket
"stunning catch! Rohit at slip, take a bow. The ball, coming off a very thick outside edge, is almost past him, and its flying too. The Mumbai captain though throws himself to his right, sticks out a hand, and comes up with the ball, and a big smile on his face. Credit to Karn as well, making a shortish delivery bounce more than the batsman expects"
"starts with a googly to the new, left-handed batsman. He tries to cut and misses"
"it's the wrong 'un again, and Rabada, stuck in the crease, thrusting his hands forward, is beaten comfortably"
hammers a length ball on off stump over the straight midwicket boundary. Fierce hit. As if he is angry. And that anger is good. Delhi have now successfully avoided the biggest margin of defeat in T20s
"gorgeous bowling. <b>He's bowling the doosra again</b>! For so long, he had hidden this delivery. But now he's wrapped Cummins up in a nice little bow. The batsman is caught in his crease, he plays for the ball turning into him, trying to milk a single to midwicket. Instead he edges it to the wicketkeeper and Parthiv does really well to take the catch too"
loops it up just outside off - he gets his old drift - and then the ball rips into the right-hander. Mishra nudges to short fine leg
works a good length ball through the right of midwicket
"tosses it up onto middle and leg, Rabada tries to flick and is struck on the pad"
"keeps to his crease and blocks a quicker delivery. He is made to hang back because of the change in pace, but the ball is quite full. Boy, he is in such good rhythm"
"lunges forward to block a full delivery outside off. Mishra endures an lbw appeal. Is it pad first? Yes, but he is a long way forward"
"gets the googly in, Mishra defends down the wrong line and is struck on the pad. Would have gone down leg"
tosses it up - baiting him into a big shot having made him block twice - Mishra goes for it but his slog misses. The keeper misses as well because the ball was wide and turned a lot too
"doesn't read the wrong 'un, which is pitched short. If he had stood still, he could've have all the room he needed. But he makes room room and as a result his swish only results in an outside edge through to Rohit at slip again"
"tosses it up on off stump, nudges it through square leg"
"flatter delivery on off stump, flicks it through to long-on"
bunts a quicker delivery on off stump down to long-on
keeps back and blocks a good length ball on off stump
"reaches out, gets under the ball, and gives it wings. The flighted delivery outside off is sent into the shell-shocked crowd at long-on"
"not this time. Bhajji knows how bowlers bat. So he goes for the variation - the one that holds its line on the right-hander. And he ensures it pitches well in front of the advancing batsman. Shami still goes for the shot, mistimes it, and is caught at long-on"
clatters a reverse sweep through to deep point
"tosses it up on off stump, defends"
"pitches the legspinner a bit too wide, and it turns sharply past the batsman's reach"
loops it up on middle and leg and sweeps it through to deep square leg
"full toss on off stump, drives to long-off"
drills a flighted delivery on off stump to long-off
"<b>beauty</b>. Gets the loopy legspinner going. Makes sure it drifts into the right-hander, to make him play, and then the turn beats him handsomely"
"<b>how has that missed off stump?</b>. This is quicker, flatter and meant for middle stump. But once it pitches on this dry surface, it rags across past the outside edged and the three sticks"
"quicker, flatter, on off stump, Mishra nudges it behind square leg"
"shortish delivery on the pads, flicks it through to long leg"
"shortish on off stump, guides it to backward point"
flashes hard outside off and the back of a length delivery zips past him
"goes after one of India's best fast bowlers with a bouncer! Hardik backs himself big time and he delivers a ripper of a ball, following the batsman as he takes evasive action"
defends a shortish delivery on off stump
"thick outside edge, as Zaheer keeps back and beside the shortish delivery on off stump."
"these are grand deliveries. Snaking in with the arm, pitching beyond the reach of the batsman and turning wildly past the edge"
chases a flighted delivery outside off and is left behind by the turn
"good length ball, pitching on off stump and ripping past the outside edge"
"that's it. The largest margin of victory in the IPL - 146 runs. The captain's wicket seals the game, as he looks to smash a tossed up delivery outside off. The ball goes high rather than long and long-on runs to his right to wrap it up"
