"walks at the seamer! But Bhuvi pulls his length back enough, but more importantly doesn't give him any width. Nudge off the pads to midwicket"
"<b>shout for lbw</b>, a distracted one because Bhuvi is also conscious of fielding the ball to stop Australia taking leg byes. But the full ball probably even pitched outside leg stump and was then swinging into the left-hander as he tries to flick"
"width, and plenty of it in Warner's eyes, so he flays it to the point boundary. Brutal. Simple"
a more controlled shot - waiting for the ball to almost wander past him before chopping it to the third man boundary
"chops on! Bhuvi roars in delight. Warner looks up at the heavens with a wry smile Ranchi just bellows. This is a good length ball, but the batsman continues to play with a horizontal bat shot. And though he tries not to power the ball at all, the fact that he made that miscalculation results in the inside edge and a blaze of red behind him"
shifts across onto off stump to clip a length ball to midwicket
"leans into a fine-looking drive, but mid-off is there to play party pooper"
punches towards cover
width - so much that Finch has to reach out to meet it and even then he makes contact with only the bottom of the bat. Still enough strength in the shot to send the ball scurrying to the cover boundary
"slip was removed after that boundary, and predictably out comes the outside edge. Wouldn't have mattered though because the ball wanders out well wide of that position to third man"
"opens the face, and steers it to third man. Which is an anti-climax because while the bowler was running up, he had cleared his front leg and his backlift was way over his head"
blocks into the covers to retain strike
"nice and tight on middle, Finch clips it to midwicket"
"forceful shot down the ground, going for the shot simply because of the ball being outside off.  But it is not a half-volley and it thuds into the bat, making it twist in Finch's hand, and as a result the ball only just clears mid-on"
pushes down the ground
"short and outside off, cuts to point"
"lifts it over point, considering the ring there is congested with infielders. The knuckle ball, lashed to the boundary"
"now he goes along the ground, and picks the gap between points backward and orthodox. Gorgeous cut shot"
"stands on leg and looks to whip a back of a length ball outside off over midwicket and only just avoids being bowled. Maxwell, high-risk, for the moment, low reward"
blocks a good length ball to mid-on
"tucks up the right-hander with a good length ball, Finch defuses it down the ground to mid-on"
"<b>almost bowled again</b>, this time clearing his front leg and aiming to smash the ball past the bowler. Knuckle ball messes with his timing again"
"tries to flick a fuller ball cramping him on middle and leg, makes contact only with the inside edge"
pushes towards mid-on for a single. Midwicket intervenes to keep the game moving
"back of a length on off stump, Maxwell pats it to mid-on"
"steps out, way too early, and as a result, Bumrah hits the deck and slows his pace. Maxwell struggles to get on top of the ball and then has no power in the shot. Has to settle for a single to mid-on"
""
"short ball, sliding into the right-hander, Maxwell tries to pull it over fine leg, but doesn't connect. Umpire calls wide for the line straying down leg"
pushes to mid-on for a quick single
"slower ball, outside off, Finch is fooled as he thinks this is ripe to loft over cover. In the end, he finds a couple at deep midwicket"
"full on middle, Finch clips it smartly behind square leg."
finally he gets one away. Meets a fuller ball sliding into his pads with a flick and gets enough bat on it to beat Dhawan running to his right at deep square leg
"clears the front leg to carve the ball away, but Pandya keeps it at leg stump and denies Maxwell any leverage. Hammers it - literally, the bat coming down on the ball from 90 degrees - to point"
"places it neatly through the gap at midwicket for a couple. Finch going at a higher strike-rate, playing proper shots than his partner"
"floats it up in the batsman's half and Finch takes full toll. An off drive of the highest quality. All along the ground. No chance for the fielder, moving to his right from mid-off"
taps a fuller delivery on middle past Rohit's right at short midwicket
"moves away to the leg side, Pandya follows him, Maxwell punches it to mid-off"
"quicker delivery outside off, Maxwell, having done away with his helmet, cuts to deep point"
"loads up the cut again, but Chahal gets the ball to kick up off the pitch just enough for the top edge to fly past Dhoni's right"
"that's the fourth time in four games that Chahal has toppled Maxwell, but he hides his face in his hands and flashes an embarrassed little grin. He knows this ball didn't deserve a wicket. Rank long hop. Destined to be smoked. Instead Maxwell pulls it straight to short midwicket"
"good length ball, pitching just outside off and turning into the left-hander quite sharply. Head makes room and punches to long-off"
rocks back and cuts a shortish delivery through cover
"<b>googly</b> and it seems like Head's picked it, stepping forward and blocking with the full face as the ball pitches on leg stump and spins away"
"tosses it up, and Finch goes for the lap sweep, but is struck on the front pad. Impact outside off stump so Kuldeep wastes an appeal"
"another sweep, but this ball, being on leg stump, is better to be put away by that shot. Single to deep square leg"
"fuller delivery outside off, so full that Head, pressing forward, ends up yorking himself as he pushes to long-off"
"good length ball on middle, Finch sweeps to long leg"
comes down the pitch and clips a fuller delivery on off stump to deep midwicket
"four balls played, four sweeps used in the battle of Finch v Kuldeep. Single to deep square leg"
"slow through the air, and he keeps it outside off. Finch, backing away, goes for the cut, but that premeditated movement ruins his timing because it took him too far away from the ball"
"smokes it over deep midwicket. A slog sweep with all the power in the world. Chahal sets up the shot, though, by tossing the ball up and outside off. He's so far bowled flatter and outside off, hoping to deny batsmen the chance to get under the ball"
flat-bats a short ball to long-off
"pushes it through off the front of the hand, so the ball simply skids straight on. Head looks to flick it, but has to settle for a leg bye towards fine leg"
"skids straight on as he pitches a quick, good length ball on leg stump and it goes further down into Dhoni's gloves"
nudges a good length ball to midwicket
"another slider - and it's pitched perfect - on a good length on middle stump. Finch is backing away, but to his credit  he meets the ball with a straight bat and as a result finds a single to long-off. Good batting."
the sweeps seems to be the only shot he wants to play against the wristspinners. Yanks a full delivery outside off to deep square leg
"belts a half-volley straight down the ground, but Pandey at long-on does well, running to his right. Good shot, equally good fielding"
"oh that's well bowled. Draws Head forward with the flight and leaves him groping as a result of the ball dipping sharply. Outside edge to point, when the batsman was looking for a drive to long-off"
"shortish and outside off, cuts past point"
"bowled im! This is splendid bowling from Kuldeep. He's assessed that Finch has decided it will be sweep or nothing tonight against spin and loads up for the shot again. But this ball is a too full. it's too close. It demands a straight bat but by the time the alarm bells ring in Finch's head, he sees red behind him. The other thing Kuldeep did well is bowl it quicker so the batsman didn't have the time to adjust"
"greets the new batsman with a wrong 'un and Henriques, set up to flick the ball, ends up with a little leading edge to long-off"
"good length ball, pitching outside leg, and turning sharply enough that Henriques has to push his hands at the ball, away from his body to meet it in defence"
steps forward to block on middle
races down the track to meet the fuller delivery where it pitches outside off and drives to long-off
<b>reads the googly off the pitch</b> but makes sure to use a straight bat to protect his stumps.
drills the ball to long-off to get off strike
"tries to hack a full ball on middle towards long-off, but he's too close to it and sends it back to the bowler instead."
"back of a length on off stump, pushes to long-on"
"around the wicket to the left-hander, who, believing this ploy is to cramp him, makes room for himself. Only Pandya bluffs him by bowling length and outside off. Toe-ended pull into the on side"
"full and outside off, Head stays still this time and smashes it to long-on"
blocks a back of a length delivery to mid-on
"that's an amazing shot! He really doesn't have any room to pull off this pull shot, but Henriques lifts it over midwicket, using a straight bat to make sure he can get maximum contact. He knows his power will send it to the boundary"
""
"shortish and outside off, Head cuts, seemingly finding the gap between backward point and short third man. But Chahal moves quickly to his right and stops the ball."
"runs down the pitch, blind, and swings right across the line. And the tossed up ball outside off has a clear path to pitch, turn and smash middle stump. Another lovely piece of bowling because he slows this down seeing the batsman advance, and as a result, Henriques was through his rash shot way too soon and left with no second measure of defence. Beautiful."
"tosses it up outside off, Christian comes forward to block"
"comes down the pitch to flick into the on side, but he ends up pushing the ball to the bowler"
"shortish and outside off, cuts to deep point"
"grip and turn. And Head, making room to cut the short ball, ends up having to let it go because he is too far away to make contact"
"fuller delivery on off stump, tucks it to short midwicket"
drives a back of a length delivery out to sweeper cover
"keeps low, or at least lower than Head thinks and he chops on. Back of a length ball, from around the wicket. Head keeps leg side of the ball to whip it through midwicket, but he doesn't account for the low bounce that the experts predicted to happen on this pitch."
"back of a length and outside off, pulls to deep midwicket"
carves a back of a length delivery on off stump to the right of the point fielder.
"walks at the bowler, before he loads up, and then drives down the ground to mid-off"
"<b>dropped</b> by Chahal himself. All that good work - deceiving the batsman with flight and more so drift, making Paine play against the turn. The leading edge comes off the flick shot, Chahal spots it, races to his right, dives full length and even takes it. But as his elbows hit the ground, the ball pops out"
"tosses it up outside off, Paine tries to lash it over cover and can't get anywhere near it. Dhoni collects the ball, but is just a little too far away from the stumps to reach out and break the stumps. has two attempts at it and had he hit the target on the first, Paine would have been stumped"
nudges it behind square leg
""
"<b>misses a stumping, does Dhoni</b>. Although he might have been blinded by the batsman, who had come forward and across the stumps to scoop the ball."
"<b>dropped</b> by Bhuvneshwar at deep midwicket. Paine gets hold of a long hop and pulls it merrily, without minding the field. The ball heads straight to the fielder, at waist-height, and he shells it"
"tosses it up outside off, the googly this time. Paine reaches for it and is beaten comfortably"
"clips a quicker, shorter delivery behind square leg"
pushes it through cover
"goes for the sweep, and the googly turns across him and goes through to the wicketkeeper"
"shortish and outside off, cuts to deep point"
"good length ball outside off, defends. That ends Kuldeep's spell. Four overs, 2 for 16."
"<b>beats him for pace</b>. Hits the deck, seam upright, and the ball snarls back into the right-hander. Christian is lucky the ball bounces over middle stump"
"on middle and leg, he clips it to long leg"
"back of a length and outside off, Paine smashes it to the cover boundary"
"nails the yorker on middle and leg, Paine can only dig it out"
swivels on the back foot and pulls the short ball outside off over the square leg boundary. Good shot. Picks a place without a boundary rider too
"yorker, curling from outside off and into the base of middle. Paine pushes it to long-on"
"through him! Bowls him! Completely destroys him! Paine is hunched over with his stumps in disarray. He eventually drags himself off, perhaps wondering how he was so comprehensively beaten. It was a straight ball, but it swings just a tiny bit in. Then after pitching, it lurched at his leg stump with a vengeance. That it kept a little low wouldn't have helped the batsman either"
"another one aimed at middle and off stump, and the only reason Bumrah isn't celebrating is because of a handy inside edge from the new batsman Coulter-Nile. Single to long leg"
"back of a length and outside off, Christian drives to the sweeper"
"ripper! Ranchi roars in appreciation of the perfect Bumrah yorker. Starts on middle and off. Curls in through the air. And Coulter-Nile is certainly not expecting that. Tries to block the ball from its target, but that late swing is too much to handle"
"another yorker, tailing into leg stump. Andrew Tye just about keeps it out"
"back of a length and outside off, swings across the line and meets with a whole lot of air"
whips a full delivery from outside off to mid-off. Christian chances the arm of the deep fielder and may well be run-out as a result of that. Third-umpire called in and replays show that it is a direct hit. A direct hit from long-on from Virat Kohli and Christian is gone.
"back of a length and outside off, blocks it"
"inside edge, squirts away to the fine leg boundary as Zampa swings across the line of a good length delivery on off stump"
"back of a length, slower as well, which is why Zampa looking to pull ends up mistiming the shot"
"spirits it away to the midwicket boundary. Lovely shot, especially considering this is a good ball, pitched up and swinging in. Rohit ensures he plays late, and close to the body and doesn't overhit"
"full and angling across the right-hander, Rohit drives to cover"
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
"back of a length and outside off, Rohit tries to cut, but is beaten by extra bounce. That rain's certainly freshened up the pitch"
"135kph, defends a good length ball on off stump behind point"
"<b>beaten</b>. Excellent over from the debutant. Hits the deck, just outside off, and gets the ball to seam past Dhawan's bat as he feels for it. Oh, this could be fun if the new ball behaves like this."
lifts it over the long leg boundary! It's fair that he was set up for the shot with Coulter-Nile bowling length and down leg. But the ease with which Rohit dismissed it. Sheesh.
"middle pole's gone! Rohit, as gorgeous as he looks when he connects, doesn't look particularly pleasing when he is done in like this. Flicks across the line of a straight ball and is cleaned up"
"good length ball outside off, Kohli drives on the up to cover. This pitch, which offered low bounce, is kicking up a bit now after the rain"
"good length ball on off stump, Kohli taps it behind point for a quick single. A risky one too, considering if the throw hit the stumps direct, Dhawan would have been long gone"
"<b>huge appeal for run-out at Kohli's end</b>. Good on Finch to be alert to the opportunity while the bowler and the rest of his team-mates were busy appealing for a lbw. Inswinger, cramping Dhawan. But he gets an inside edge to it to save himself"
"<b>dropped</b>, I think, by the bowler! But it came back at him so quickly! Dhawan steps out of his crease and though he checks his drive down the ground, Coulter-Nile has no time to move well enough to his left. A hand comes out, the ball deflects off it and goes to the boundary"
"extends his defence, after stepping out of his crease. And so a knuckle ball, which should ideally mess with a batsman's timing, sails over the infield. One-bounce four for minimum effort"
"shortish and outside off, dabs to third man"
"takes the slower short ball and pulls it to the deep square leg boundary, much to the Ranchi crowd's delight. They've waited a long time to see the Indian batsmen and are now lapping it up"
"advances on the bowler, but with the line being on leg stump, and the ball moving into him as well, the lbw shout is wasted. Knuckle ball again."
"yorker outside off, Kohli steers it to point"
"back of a length on off stump, dabs it behind point"
wallops a short ball outside off to deep midwicket
"short-arm pulls to the square leg boundary! This was short, yes, but there was no room to free the arms. Dhawan still manages to impart power into the ball with his wrists. Superb stuff."
"top-edge as Coulter-Nile goes for the bouncer at the badge and Dhawan indulges in a hook shot. Taking the ball over his left shoulder is a big risk, but he survives as the ball wanders behind square leg"
"clips a full ball on middle to deep backward square leg, where Head nearly slips as he races across an outfield that took a lot of rain"
"fuller delivery outside off, drives to long-off"
"backs away to deal with a short ball on middle, but is beaten as he tries a ramp shot"
whips a shortish delivery on leg stump past fine leg's left. Placement gets him the boundary
"backs away to try and whip a slider through midwicket, but it keeps low and takes a bottom edge, then a bit of the pad to fine leg's right this time"
"shortish and outside off, cuts but is beaten. It's a touch too close for the shot."
gets down the track and drives to short cover
"steps out, but Zampa shortens his length. The ball then kicks up off the pitch, making Dhawan work overtime as he flicks. The ball wanders dangerously close to Warner's reach at mid-on as he runs and dives to his right."
drives to extra cover. Now <b>its six off six for India to win</b>. Good come back after conceding a boundary first ball
"slower ball outside off, Dhawan cuts to deep point"
"excellent work by Coulter-Nile at deep backward square leg, racing to his right and stopping a certain boundary. Kohli's flick, powered by those incredible wrists, still fetches two"
"goes over extra cover to seal the win! he plays the field so well - four men on the leg side boundary - he predicts the line would be on leg stump, so he makes room and since it is full as well he just gets under it and lifts it over the four men saving singles on the off side"
