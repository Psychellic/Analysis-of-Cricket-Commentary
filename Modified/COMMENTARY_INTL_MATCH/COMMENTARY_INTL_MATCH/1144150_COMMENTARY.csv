dug in too short from Ngidi. It climbs a long way over Mire's head

<b>slapped away.</b> Dropped very short again and with a lot of width. Sits up outside off and Masakadza stands tall and gets it wide of mid-off with a flat bat
full and a bit of shape away in the corridor. Blocked into the covers off the front foot

full and just outside off. Driven firmly but straight to mid-off
length and in at off stump. Late on the drive as he gets on the front foot for it. Dribbles out to mid-off

"<b>onto the roof!</b> That is a monster, no-look whack over the bowler's head that is sure to hurt his ego. He attempts an offcutter but it's not well disguised. It's full and landing right outside off where he can swing cleanly through the line. And he does and doesn't even bother looking. It sails and causes damage up there"
"short and wide outside off, slashes on the up and misses"
<b>deft and over fine leg.</b> What skill. Gets down on his knee outside off in anticipation of the length ball. It arrives and he scoops it fine to clear the boundary

"length on off stump, defended into the covers on the front foot"

<b>cops it on the body</b> as he gets down to try and scoop another one. In fact it's into the body off the grille. A perfect example of why cricket needed helmets before batsmen attempted such shots. It's a length ball outside off and rises more than he expects

"length on off stump, dabbed into the off side with soft hands to steal a single"
<b>tonks leg stump!</b> This is really good from South Africa. They built the pressure with the dot balls - only three scoring shots in the last 12 balls - and handed the ball to the experienced stump-to-stump guy. He kept hitting a length and now he's hit the stumps too. Masakadza runs down the pitch and heaves across the line. At no point is he in control
"yorker at middle stump, jammed down the pitch"

"full outside off, shuffles and drives off the toe-end to mid-off. <b>It's a close call</b> as he looks to steal a run from that fielder. Thankfully for him, Faf doesn't hit the stumps"
"<b>another one for Frylinck.</b> Muskanda has had no luck outside off. Got one naughty ball after another out there and it's another one that's got the edge now. Or has it? He stands still and stares down the pitch. If there was an edge, it's a really thin one. He was slashing hard at this short of a length ball outside off and it cut away and climbed at him"
full and slanting across off stump. Looks to drive on the up and gets it to mid-on's left off the thick inside edge
