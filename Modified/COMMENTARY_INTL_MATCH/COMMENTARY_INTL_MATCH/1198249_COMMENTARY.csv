on the pads and Roy flicks it away to fine leg for first runs
off the mark for him too. Short of length and he tucks it easily to fine leg as well
"82mph/132kmh, nice and outside off this time, much better line. Roy watches it go to the keeper"
more on the stumps now and Roy defends it towards mid-on
"<b>he's edged it to second slip</b>! Hint of outswing from Young, spot on with the length to tempt Roy into the drive and he lunges forward to edge it with a not-so flourishing drive. Not the most exciting series for Roy"
bit of a forward lean and he defends the length ball to the leg side
"nice and tight outside off, just short of length and Bairstow lets it go"
punches off the back foot towards off but gets an inside edge to leg for a single
"<b>edged over the slips</b>! Not the most confident way to get off the mark, it was short and wide and swinging away, Vince threw his hands at it and got an edge thick enough to fly over the slips"
much straighter now on length and he flicks it confidently to mid-on
"tight line outside off, not much movement and he lets it go"
nips it in a bit from just outside off and Vince blocks it back
around off and middle and Bairstow stays back to tuck it away wide of mid-on in the gap for two

"in the block hole with some outswing just outside off, Vince digs it out and wants a quick single but he's sent back immediately"
<b>that's a crisp cover drive</b>! Pitched up outside off and he did the necessary - big back lift and excellent flourish for a drive right from the middle of the bat as he leaned forward
pushes sit down the ground this time
stay back in the crease and defends this length ball too on off
almost in the block hole and Bairstow has to get his front foot out of the way to on-drive it to mid on
"<b>nips in and he's bowled</b>! That's a big wicket for Adair! Bairstow was eyeing a big shot on the off side, he missed the movement and Adair is pumped."

lets this one go in the channel
"85mph, pitched up and defended on the front foot"
"tighter line, this nips back to hit high up on the leg - thigh pad I think, only a strangled appeal"
"full and sliding in, whipped away through backward square leg for a couple"
"in the channel, good length, 85mph/137kph and he lets this one go through"
"hangs this out wide of the stumps from over the wicket, Morgan watches it by"

not so short but he manages to pull it away past midwicket for two

"too full and wide now, Morgan chases without moving his front foot much and misses"
"back of length on off, Morgan stays back and defends it back"
"<b>loud appeal</b> for an inside edge, they all go up and the umpire says no! <b>Ireland review</b> it. Replays with Ultredge show there's something there and Vince is gone! It was a short of length delivery outside off, nipped in sharply beating Vince completely, and just taking an edge on the way to the keeper"
on middle and leg and he tucks it behind square for one
bouncer for Morgan and he ducks under it
"follows the bouncer with a full delivery outside off, Morgan takes out a cracking drive from his book and completes it with some wonderful follow through, drilling it through the covers"

"another short ball, another pull, but this one much straighter and finds mid-on after a couple of bounces"
"short ball for Morgan too, from Little, and he hooks it towards fine leg"
"<b>in the air</b> and it lands safely! Short of length ad he chips it high down the ground, mid-on is in the chase but it clears him easily"

a bouncer that Morgan lets go but it's called a wide for height
"gives it the charge and adjusts after seeing the length, punches it to short cover"

"much slower on leg, pushed to midwicket"
"flighted on middle and off, Willey pushes it back to the bowler"
length delivery around off and Billings blocks it in copy-book fashion
"<b>straight to mid-on</b>, another big wicket! Not a full delivery, on length just outside off and seaming in, Billings drives on the up and down the ground, and the length is such that he can't get on top of it. Thick inside half of the bat and it's dipping on the fielder but Adair does well to dive forward and get both hands to it"
"outside off on good length, he defends it back"

pretty straight around off and he defends it back to Adair
"on the pads now, he doesn't connect for the flick but gets a leg bye"
"shouts of 'catch' as Willey pulls the short ball but it lands fall of fine leg, just by a bounce though. Nice bouncer by Adair"

short one outside leg and he hooks to long leg
"ah, so close! Curran saw the ball outside off and poked, but the ball shaped away to beat him"
errs down the leg side for a wide this time

"length ball on the stumps, Curran drives it down to long-on with a thick inside edge"
"full toss on the pads, flicked easily to deep midwicket for two. And it's a no-ball as well, the umpire confirms. <b>Free hit</b> coming up"

"good reply, tight line around off and Willey defends into the off side"
"<b>big appeal</b> as Curran comes down the ground for the ball outside off, it turns in a bit, flicks the pad and beats the keeper for three byes! They have <b>reviewed</b> for lbw. Oh, replay show it's hitting the stumps but impact was outside off. Review lost"
"<b>what a way to bring up the fifty</b>, David Willey! Goes down on a knee and absolutely smothers that over the midwicket boundary. Shades of Ben Stokes there"
goes back for the shorter delivery and works it to leg
"makes room for this outside off and throws his bat at it while losing a bit of balance, gets one past point"
"big swing outside off, looked like an edge that went off the keeper's pad to short third man. Was probably the sound of bat hitting the ground"
full outside off and he drills it straight to cover
"almost in the block hole, he scoops it out to deep cover"
"<b>there comes the breakthrough</b>, and who else but Campher! Slower delivery around off, Willey probably doesn't pick it and lofts it high down the ground, Balbirnie has his eyes on the bacll while taking a few steps back at long-on and does well to get both hands. What a knock and what a relief for Ireland"
accurate yorker there! Angling in sharply and Curran digs it out to cover
"a full delivery on middle and leg, pushed down to long-on"

"another slower one to end the over, outside off, and it's punched to deep cover"
"oh my my! You have five overs to bat and <b>manage a run-out</b>! Curran gets an inside edge and the ball rolls to the left of the keeper, they try for a single that doesn't exist and Adil Rashid puts in a dive at the keeper's end, where the keeper gets a direct hit. Rashid is short by a mile!"
"he'll take that, he swings half-heartedly, gets an inside edge and the runs away fine on leg for four"
nudges this one towards point for a quick one
a bit short and he pulls to deep square leg
"shortish outside off, pushes to cover and says no for the single"
"slow short ball, he works it towards fine leg with soft hands and they manage a second by the time the fielder runs in and throws it back. Smart batting and running"
"makes room, Adair replies with a slower delivery that follows him and goes between the batsman and the stumps. Clever"
"too wide, slammed away with a big drive in the gap and Delany does excellent work with a dive to his left after a sprint and saves two!"
"too short, four in the deep on leg, but can't save this one. It was too slow, too short and he hammered that with a pull between deep backward square and deep midwicket"
"thick outside edge as Curran tries to flick it to leg, the full delivery goes to off"
bit of forward lean and Mahmood defends it back
"slower one at 107kmh to end the over, Mahmood waits and then deflects it to third man. Keeps strike too"

defends the length ball outside off and gets an inside edge to leg
he does go wide and full but Curran walks to the off side as well to swing to leg but manages a thick edge towards deep point and returns for two
"too full and wide outside off, Curran goes after it and <b>Ireland want to review this for caught behind</b>! Not out, there's absolutely nothing there as Curran moves to off and goes down on a knee to drive, but no connection at all"
"moves across to off yet again, and smart bowling there from Little. Wide and just short of yorker length which Curran can't connect with"

"length ball, pushed into the covers"
"fuller and straighter, 84mph/135kph and Stirling opens up those beefy shoulders, hoicks up and over mid-on for a couple. Not the sweetest connection but gets enough of it"
"length, rising around off stump, stabbed to backward point"
"back of a length in the channel, 84mph/135kph and Delany watches it through outside off"

"length outside off, bat on ball for Delany as he taps into the covers"
