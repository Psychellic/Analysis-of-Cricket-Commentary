"length ball, 133kph/82mph and holding its line around middle and leg, tapped down"
"diligent lines from Curran, again Gayle settles for deferential blocking"

squirted away through backward point
"banged in, 136kph/84mph and high over the crouching batsman - wide on height"
"in the channel, Curran hits the seam and <b>wobbles the ball past the outside edge</b>, Gayle feeling uncertainly for it"

short of a length and blocked on off
dropped into the covers and this time they do make the effort to pinch the single
"here we go again... <b>Gayle puts his first one out of the ground!</b> So nonchalant, so powerful. Tossed up on leg and this seemed like nothing more than a little paddle-sweep to leg. And then the ball is bouncing away over the roof of the stand"

"tighter line, over the top of off, defended"
"flighted, drifting in from round the wicket, gets an inside edge on to pad"
"dances down, Campbell tries to sweep and gets into a tangle, <b>nearly dragging the ball on to his stumps...!</b> Buttler managed to juggle it between his knees and complete the catch, he then asks the question, thinking it may have flicked glove on the way through. England decide to <b>review</b>, and this could be close. Definitely flicks the pad, but what about the glove; UltraEdge is required, but seems to be taking an age to process. Ah, here we go, looks like it brushed Campbell's sweat band, which <i>isn't</i> part of the glove, so he'll be okay. Ball-tracking shows it missing leg, England lose their review and, after all that, on we go!"

"pushed through wide of the stumps, Campbell cuts for a single"
"dragged down a touch, Gayle flat-bats it back to the bowler"

sliding down the leg side
"short and sharp, Hope ducks"
"<B>lovely googly!</B> Lots of flight, on a perfect length, and zips past the edge!"
"<B>brilliance from Rashid!</B> Opted for the lesser-spotted legbreak, a bit faster and flatter, Gayle launched into a flat-footed slap across the line, in his apparent arc, but it turned sharply to clip the outside of the off stump!"
"onto the front foot, tucked to the leg side, and a very quick single to hint at a more urgent approach between the wickets..."

"<B>huge appeal</B> and the umpires are looking at the stumping! That was classy from Rashid, fizzing it through faster and flatter, and though Hope's toe was dragging ... he might have got it back in time. There's enough doubt for this to be <B>not out</B>."

"another googly, big spin, Roy pounces at mid-on"
"<B>short, pulled, snaffled at deep square leg!</B> Hope dwindles, as Stokes digs one in, Bairstow barely had to move, and another good start fails to turn into a big finish. Hitting into the breeze was always going to be fraught with danger"
"outside off, and blocked into the covers"
"<B>well bowled from Stokes!</B> Rolled his fingers on the slower ball, Hetmyer was through his shot early and nearly popped a return catch. Inches short ..."

"another short ball, slapped out to the leg side"
"onto the front foot, and bashed into the covers"
"<strong>a swish and a miss! </strong>A roundhouse pull as Plunkett bashes the pitch from back of a length, but this doesn't get up as expected"
"another slow bouncer, a big wind-up, but the ball just isn't there for the shot"
big appeal from England as Hetmyer flashes at another short ball ... but no reaction from umpire Oxenford

"back of a length, well-directed at the ribs and Bravo gets his hands out of the way"

"full, shaping away, <i>just</i> into the tramlines as Hetmyer swung himself off balance backing away"
fired in straight at 146kph/91mph and dug out to the on side
"big lbw appeal, again Oxenford says no - <b>but then another direct hit scuppers Holder!</b> He set off instinctively but Jason Roy was already scooting up from point, picked up and hurled at one-and-a-bit stumps, and that's a bingo!"
"short of a length, defended back down the track"
"length ball, 146kph/91mph and swerving back, Brathwaite does well to get some bat on it"

"<B>round his legs, and Cottrell has five!</B> This is magnificent bowling, but an unlucky way to go ... clips the inside of the thigh pad, a la Keaton Jennings in the Tests, and deflects back into the leg stump! But there's no stopping Cottrell now. He ain't no Private Pile!"
