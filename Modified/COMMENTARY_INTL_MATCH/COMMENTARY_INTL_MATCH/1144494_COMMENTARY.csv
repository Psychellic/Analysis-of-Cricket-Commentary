Mortaza found some extra lift from round the wicket, Bairstow attempted a nudge to leg, but the ball popped up to short cover, where it was gobbled brilliantly by a sprint and dive from Mehedy.

"squeezed for room on the leg stump, another useful dot as Roy tries to make the angle"
"down the leg side, it's a bonus run, but Roy is livid, as it was back of a length, and the slenderest tickle of bat would have been four all the way"
"firmly cracked on the up into the covers, lovely straight blade, seizing on the merest hint of off-side line. But the sweeper limits the damage"
"flowing drive, all along the ground to long-off, Root returns the compliment"
"short, pulled, <B>and away to the rope via another misfield!</B> Jason Roy has his century, but takes a moment to make sure he's not left a permanent dent in the umpire, <B>whom he completely wipes out while completing his run!</B> Joel Wilson is fine. On we go!"

"short and wide, chopped to third man"

"short and wide, Roy reaches for the pull and drags it to the leg side in front of square"
"very full, full face of the bat in response, Saifuddin half-stops with a leap in his followthrough"

"<B>goes for the exact same shot, with the exact same result!</B> Round the wicket, into the arc, and pummelled through the covers!"
"Shakib tightens his line, and is <strong>battered over long-on!</strong>"
"pushed into the off side, and up comes the 200..."
worked into the covers for another single
"wide line outside off, Roy reaches with a cross-batted mow, and finds the single to square leg"
"low full toss, a muffed slog to deep midwicket"
"speared into the legs, can't work the angle but accepts the single into the leg side"
"<B>inside-edged drive!</B> Root's knock is sawn off by a slower ball, perhaps he was through the shot too soon. Respite at last for Bangladesh, but I wonder if we might see Jos Buttler now?"
"advancing out of his crease, that is arrow-straight but a long way down the pitch! <B>Bangladesh are reviewing! </B>It was an attempted flick to leg, no bat involved ... was it past the 3m mark though ... nope, but it was missing leg! Just starting to swing at the point of impact, which may be why he missed it"
flicked to the leg side
"chipped off the pads, in the air for a moment, but short of the man at short backward square"

"wide on the crease, tight to off stump again, driven with a closed face to midwicket"

"slashed uppishly, but <B>bounces short of point!</B>"
"fuller length, nudged from an off-stump line to square leg. Woakes is a bit miffed they managed to pinch the single there"

"outside off, <B>edged and did that carry to slip?</B> Sarkar was leaning back, toe-ending a deflection, and it was on the half-volley ... tough chance"
"<B>absolute beauty!</B> I defy any batsman in the world to play that one! Line, length, nip off the seam at 90mph, bending into the top of off stump, clipping it so finely that the ball balloons over the keeper! Soumya played forwards, but the stump went backwards! Soumya was too deep in his crease to respond, but gosh ... decent nut!"

pushed to the on-side
"short and wide, Shakib climbs into the slash through the off side, but the ball slips past the stroke before it has formed"

"full length, clipped to the on side. Areas ... and wheels"
<strong>short and fast!</strong> Shakib sways inside the line like a vision from Sabina Park 1986
"cracked with urgency, off the back foot and through the covers. It was the reflexive bat-speed that did the job there. No time for timing ..."

"nudged off the legs, a bit of a scamper as the shy comes in from backward square"
"<B>sconed!</B> Tamim ducks into the ball, which flicks his shoulder, and zooms to the rope!"
more fierce pace on a tight line
"<strong>turned inside out by a snorter!</strong> Tried to duck, decided to stand tall, and the ball zings off the gloves and flies safe!"
"<B>pulled, with no conviction!</B> Lucky to scuff the shot, as square leg was lurking!"
"<B>that's more like it!</B> Flicked up, up and away, over the short straight boundary, all the way into the stands! Using the pace, creating the angle!"

"whipped off the toes, to the leg side"
"on the leg stump, tickled out of Bairstow's reach for the single"

lining up the pull but that's too wide of off for a connection
"<B>cracked backward of point, past the diving Roy!</B> And if you beat Roy, you tend to beat the field. Excellent shot"
"chopped down into the pitch, and <B>past the stumps!</B> Tight line and nearly earns the reward!"
"<B>gallops down the pitch, and holes out to extra cover!</B> Tamim wasn't enjoying himsefl out there, and tried in vain to kick-start his innings with some pre-meditated aggression. It was not to be, a simple spooned catch, and Bangladesh are in some bother now"
"flicked off the toes, behind square"
"outside off on a full length, a bit of late nip off the seam, and the recently posted gully was nearly in business there..."
