"angles a length ball into middle and leg, whipped to deep square leg"
backs away and punches the full delivery to extra cover
"goes leg side to carve the ball over cover, the bowler follows him with a slider down leg, misses a faint tickle to fine leg. Umpire signals wide"
"too full and into the pads, superb wrist work to pick the gap between midwicket and mid-on. More work for Pretorius, who just bowled a poor last over."
"squared up by late movement. Short of length delivery on middle in the mid 130s, the ball nips away off the seam to whizz past the shoulder of the bat. Seam position, superb"

thumped into the cover boundary at the rate of knots! That wasn't a half-volley by any means but Tharanga held his shape to simply punch that on the up. Delightful to say the least
"width on offer, steered down to third man"
"backs away and punches to mid-off to complete a quick single, 50 up for Sri Lanka. Applause from the dressing room"
"clubbed into the stands at deep midwicket. Picked the length early, swivelled back and hammered it in front of square. Sweet sound as bat met ball. Sri Lanka mean business"
"angles a length ball across the left-hander, who works it to mid-on"
looks to whip that over square leg but played too early at that length ball which pitched outside leg
"beaten by sheer pace. Angles a short of length delivery at 137.7 clicks, Dickwella, who tries to move to the off side, ends up being cramped for room"
"laces this into the cover boundary. Length ball, he leans into the drive and simply times it superbly"
"appeal but a very small one. Goes a long way across to tickle it fine, but misses. Not called wide because the batsman moved inside his crease"
"backs away and toe-ends a full toss over cover, didn't look like he timed it at all but it still had enough to clear the infield and run away into the boundary"

"too full on the pads, turned to deep midwicket"
"moves to the leg side, gets underneath the flight and lofts through the line over mid-off, one bounce into the ropes. Super timing"

"yorker-length on middle, squeezed to the off side"
squared up but end up playing it to point and scamper for a run to bring up his 31st ODI fifty. A direct hit at the striker's end and Dickwella may have been in trouble
"quick bouncer that raps him on the glove as he backs away to go over point. 146.8kph that delivery. Ouch, his fingers must hurt despite all that protection"
"spongy bounce this time, rolled his fingers over the delivery, Tharanga removes the bottom hand off the grip as he defends"
in the air but just doesn't carry to Amla at short third man. Shaped to cut but this wasn't all that short and he managed to get a thick edge. Lucky break

"hitting them really cleanly. Walks to the leg side, gets underneath the flight and goes over extra cover, one bounce into the boundary. Sparkling batting"
gets a good stride in and blocks
"picked away into the square leg boundary. The man just came in, and so once Tahir bowled it full and it was hit over the infield, it was only headed one way"
backs away and directs that short of length delivery on middle to third man
rip roaring bouncer which Tharanga ducks under
"flicked into the gap between midwicket and mid-on, this was a slower delivery. He was into the stroke a little too early, which meant it was uppish. No damage done though"

The tracker shows it was only clipping the outside of the leg stump. Umpire's call in the end"

driven through the line to mid-off
"there's a wicket against the run of play. It's the pace that has resulted in the wicket. Mendis walks across the stumps to pull a short ball aimed at the rib cage, Mendis is too late on the stroke and can only glove it to Quinton de Kock. Needless shot, really. All he needed to do was nudge the ball and give his captain the strike. Got to question the match awareness. Thinnest of edges, ultraedge confirms and South Africa have broken a 64-run stand"

"wrong'un on middle, pushed to cover as they scamper a quick single"
"huge moment in the match. Is that a game-changer? Tharanga's exhibition is over and it will be very sad if it were to end in a losing cause. Newlands faithful applaud, Tahir runs up to him to shake his hand. The Sri Lankans in the dressing room applaud. What a moment. Coming back, this was short and wide outside off, Tharanga could have had a real go at that one if he liked, but he somehow just held back a touch and ended up steering it straight to backward point."

"slow turn from middle, pushed to short third man, looks for a single but is sent back"
"looks to muscle a pull over midwicket, gets a thick inside edge to the fielder there"

gets on top of the bounce and steers it to point
pulled from outside off to deep square leg
"reverse swing has done the trick and Sri Lanka are falling apart. Full, straight and tailing in late, Dhananjaya plays all around it and is hit on the full. It was just a half-appeal from Rabada but that was a sign of how plumb it was, perhaps. The umpire didn't take long either. Dhananjaya had the option of reviewing that, but I think he knew too that he was absolutely dead there. The collapse is on. South Africa have wrested the initiative here and are on their way to, I dare say, 4-0. Oh, dear. Replays suggest that would have missed leg."

"direct hit at the striker's end from point and Asela would have been walking back. Opportunity missed. Cut away to the fielder for a risky, risky run. QDK tried to flick it back Dhoni style, but couldn't"
gets forward and across to defend
"<b> straight in, straight out. What's worse, Tahir concedes a boundary too. </b> Nowhere in line to play the pull, went through with the stroke, got it high up on the bat. Tahir, lurking round the corner at deep backward square, misjudged it completely"
