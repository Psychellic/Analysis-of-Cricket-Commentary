"over corrects this time. Length ball on leg, trying to cramp Salt up, but going down for a wide"

"you may think it's a freebie, it's a full toss, but it's been thrown well outside off, Carey drags it across the line towards the longer side of the ground, loses his shape and timing completely as the fielder at cow corner doesn't have to move an inch to take that"

"flatter one outside off, Rashid pulls out the reverse sweep but can't make contact with the bat"

<B>innovative!</b> Shuffles across the stumps and ramps this full ball over the keeper's head. Ridiculous (in a good way)

"<B>Carey gets a hug from Rashid</B> because they nearly made a mess of it. Full on middle, and the leg-side slog takes a leading edge.

Rashid gives out a wry smile"
