"short of good length, a hint of movement as it leaves him, and Vijay shoulders arms"
sharper this time as it breaks away off a length and Vijay plays half inside the line

"a tad wider and on a length, left alone as it swings away outside off"
"through him.. Vijay's gone for a duck. Terrific delivery. The seam's pointing towards fine leg and it pitches full, really full. Vijay is lured into flicking it as he sees the inward curve, but the ball swings away to sneak through into the stumps"

"length, cuts in from outside off, Rahul is sure of his off-stump and lets it go"
"good length on middle and leg, Pujara knocks it towards short midwicket"
"ah, needs to resist that. Sticks the bat out to a length ball around the fifth or sixth-stump line but doesn't account for the late swing that leaves him beaten"
what a delivery! This is splendid stuff. Angles a length ball into the fourth-stump line and almost forces the batsman to play before getting it to swing late. Top stuff

"outside edge, taken. Anderson's relentless lengths are making Indian batsmen's lives miserable. Rahul strides forward to play at it and gets a healthy nick that settles into Bairstow's gloves"

"outswinger outside off, left alone"
"straight length ball outside off, left alone"
run out.. a run out. Would you believe it? Seems like this may have been Kohli's mistake. And it's the most innocuous delivery to get out to. A straight length ball that Pujara taps to point. They think of a quick single. Kohli is responsive. Takes off full speed. And then stops and turns back and Pujara is left stranded

"through the gate. India are completely clueless here. It's moving one way and then the other. This one's pushed across and Karthik is instinctively drawn across, but the ball cuts back in a mile and flattens the stumps after ripping past the inside edge. Just how do you play these?"

"length on middle, nudged into the leg side"
"fuller of a good length, swings away outside off and it's left alone"

"short of a length, a tad wider this time and it's left alone"
looks close and given. Trapped plumb in front by an inswinger. Kuldeep reviews but this is gone. Pitches on middle and off and straightens down that channel to hit him dead in front. No bat on the flick and crashing into the inside half of middle stump
"short of a length outside off, slaps hard to deep point. Doesn't take the single"
that's gone.. plumb. Ashwin sends this upstairs. Could he have got a bat? Curves in sharply from outside off and beats the inside edge. It's pad first and crashing into leg stump. Off he goes
was there bat on that? Leg bye signalled. Comes into him and lobs off the pad towards short fine who dives forward but the ball drops short
some late entertainment in the day.. Shami throws his hands at a wide fuller one and flays it over point. Pulled back well inside the boundary
and there's the 100.. with some good old-fashioned slogging. Swipes blindly looking for a biggie over leg side nad gets a leading edge that gets through the third man region
"some more.. take that. Big swing, no feet, no grace, just a big fat outside edge that gets over the slip cordon. Shami will take that. Next bowler"
"extremely full outside off, plays inside the line"
"gone.. <b>five for Anderson, and 99 wickets for Jimmy Anderson at Lord's.</b> And with that ends with insipid Indian batting performance. Angles in towards off and nips away every-so-subtly to pin Ishant in front as he stays on the backfoot. Where was the impact? No reviews left for India, and replays show the ball would have clipped the outside half of off-stump, so umpire's call"
"leg-stump half-volley. If ever there is a sign of things to come. Anyway, Cook gets off the mark with a shot that he was born to play. The nudge through midwicket"
"129 kph, back of a length, Jennings taps it off his hip to square leg"
there's the line! There's the angle. Ishant pitches it up fuller and draws Jennings forward. But the left-hander judges it to be pitching outside off and angling further away. So he leaves. Good stuff
"and he goes back to thinking Jennings is right-handed. Considering he isn't, this short ball cackles away down leg"
carefully gets behind the fuller delivery on leg stump.
more freebies! Jennings this time gets the gift of a hittable ball on his pads and he neatly puts it away between midwicket and mid-on
and the other guy sprays it wide outside off. Bright sunshine. Wayward bowling. Who gave England cheat codes to Test cricket?!?
"bouncer now, pitching on off stump. Suppose that's a bit of an improvement as Jennings ducks underneath"
tucks a shortish delivery on middle away to deep square leg
nice and tight on middle stump. Worryingly for India there is no movement even though Shami is pitching the ball right up. Cook defends
pins Cook on the pads as he tries to turn it away with the angle behind square leg. Shami's ability to skid through after pitching ruins those plans
"that'd make up all three of his wishes to a genie - a ball on the pads. Barely needs to bat an eyelid as muscle memory takes over, helping him flick the ball to the square leg boundary"
"<b>seam movement</b>! Ishant hits the deck on and around leg stump and the ball - seam bolt upright - bites into the pitch and darts away past Jennings, squaring him up and beating him like a drum"
brings him forward outside off and Jennings drives towards mid-off.
"plump and inviting is this wide delivery outside off, but Jennings isn't too keen on making the first move"
short again - pitching outside leg - Jennings is happy to sink under it
inches forward to a good length ball on middle and off and pinches a run through the covers
gift-wrapped with the greatest care and Cook accepts with a touch of class. Another leg-stump straggler is sent away to the midwicket boundary
"<b>extra bounce</b>? Possibly. Shami hits the deck with a shortish delivery, angling in to cramp Jennings. The left-hander shuffles inside the line to pick it away to long leg but instead is stuck high on the thigh"
"pitches it up on off stump, Cook blocks it. He's still not quite moving his foot down the pitch. India have a chance if they can target this line and length at the left-hander"
"okay, that front foot's moving now! Leans in and gets his hands through this overpitched ball outside off"
"now Jennings. Another overpitched ball wide outside off, no swing on it. He drives to Vijay's right at mid-off and he goes down late. Manages to get a hand on it though"
"length and in at off stump, dropped into the covers with soft hands"
short of a length and slanted in from wide outside off. Withdraws the bat and lets it go
"short of a length and wide outside off, left alone"
"<b>swing.</b> Gets this to curve a long way away outside off. It's full, but Cook doesn't chase it"
"length ball shaping away from outside off, left alone on the front foot"
"good length. But Cook is getting in. Won't play outside off. This one swings away late, but it's wide enough that he makes the decision to leave early"
nicely bowled. Length ball swung away from middle stump. Stays tall in the crease and gets squared up. It trickles into the covers
"full outswinger at off stump, gets the front leg out and drives on the up to mid-off"
"137 kph, well the pace is alright but Jennings is easily behind the line of this short delivery on middle, turning it to midwicket"
"137 kph, that's good work from Jennings. Waits on the delivery to come to him and then taps towards point softly enough to pinch a single"
covers the line of this back of a length delivery at 142 kph
another opportunity for an opening batsman to play off the back foot. Hmm. At least its a dot to mid-on
that's better! The 134 kph delivery from around the wicket comes seeking the top of off stump and Cook shuffles in place to protect it.
gets up tall to deal with this short ball on off stump and gently steers it to cover
<b>goes down and past the third slip</b>. The round-the-wicket tactic is slowly starting to become threatening. And it's largely because India are slowly starting to pitch the ball up. Ishant finds the outside edge after an uncertain poke from Jennings
a straight drive from Cook! That's ominous! He usually only gets it to go that straight when he's seeing the ball very very well.
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
<b>squares up</b> against the full delivery as Ishant gets it to shape away late. Cook adjusts to the threat with soft hands and the leading edge barely comes off the ground
"there it is. Nice and full, in line with off stump from around the wicket, demanding Cook to play, which is all the more important because Ishant is getting it to deviate away off the angle. This time the ball hits the middle of the bat. Next time..."
"<b>beats him</b> and just like that, with only a handful of pitched-up deliveries, a batsman who was looking set goes poking at a ball he normally wouldn't. That's the pressure disciplined bowling creates. It makes even an accomplished opener like Cook go chasing wide outside the off stump"
"full on off stump, Jennings pushes it to mid-off"
pulls his length back as he targets Jennings' body. The left-hander tries to dab it behind square leg but gets struck instead.
"<b>plumb in front</b>! But Jennings wants the third umpire's seal on this and has called for DRS. Unless he has nicked it, he's going to have to go. And UltraEdge says he hasn't. So Shami gets the reward for pitching the ball up; pitching it up so much that it nearly becomes a yorker. Jennings plays all around it, barely moving his feet, closing the face of the bat, looking for runs through midwicket when he really should have been using a straight bat. Well, he'll have plenty of time to think about his choices in the dressing room."
"back of a length and outside off, dabs it with the open face and finds third slip diving to his right to stop the single"
"lovely bowling. Perhaps having a right-hander out there will help Shami. He's already homing in on Root's off stump, with just a hint of inswing as he keeps his length full. The England captain defends stoutly"
"good length ball at 142 kph, looking for middle and off stumps. Root's big broad bat says they're not home and takes a message. It's not publishable."
"wide half-volley as Ishant searches desperately for swing. Cook is hardly sympathetic to the bowler's plight, pouncing on it with the viciousness of an opening batsman in England"
"<b>got im</b>! This is an absolute corker from Ishant! Charging in from around the wicket, hitting the deck, squaring the batsman up and snatching the outside edge with just enough movement away off the seam. India are elated. They have an opening into that fragile England middle order now."
turns a good length ball on middle to square leg
"that front foot is strays onto off stump, but his hands are quick enough to deal with the problems this kind of technique brings. Flicks the inswinger away behind square leg. Perfect way to get off the mark and, yes, he flashes a big grin. Good on ya!"
the angle into the right-hander has him falling over a bit - probably why he misses out on glancing this wayward delivery off to the fine leg boundary
"he's getting a lot of swing into the right-hander, and Pope is good enough not to commit too early. Nudges the ball carefully to mid-on"
"<b>rippah</b>! India are feeling it now. This ball is full on off stump, and for three-fourth of its time pretends to be an inswinger. Then it hits the pitch and jags away past Root's tentative push"
angles it into middle and leg - trying to make the ball move off the angle and secure a leading edge - but Root is able to spoil those plans by hitting to mid-on
"<b>leading edge</b> this time but it falls short of gully. Rahane is the man diving to his right. Shami pulls his length back but still finds the movement he's looking for - taking the ball away off the angle in. Root plays for that angle in, looking for midwicket"
"good length ball on off stump, defends"

short of a length and outside off - the perfect sighter
"back of a length and outside off, Root ushers it to the keeper's gloves"
"another lifter outside off, but since it's far enough away from his stumps, Root has an easy leave"
"the full length draws him into the shot, and he has to open the face of the bat to deal with the slight bit of away movement. Single to point"
"very full, and swinging into the right-hander rather late. Root has to hurry in bringing down a straight bat, even if he is in danger of jamming it onto his big toe"
"shortish and outside off, no need to bother with those"
"139 kph, full, on middle and leg, Root works it to midwicket"
"good length ball, around the fifth stump, Root lets it go. The captain's slowly getting in."
shifts his weight back to smartly deal with a shortish delivery on middle (and give some work to mid-on)
"some pretty shape away from the bat, but Root's front foot stride is equally eye-catching, allowing him to block to point. <b>And that's drinks</b>"
and he starts with a bit of a long hop down leg. Pope sets up for the pull but just can't catch up with it
"corrects his line as he lines it up on off stump, and a little bit of turn has Pope hurrying into pushing it to mid-on"
gets down leg for a sweep and he finds a single behind square leg
loopy half-volley on off stump and Root smears it through the covers. Gorgeous shot. Minimum fuss
and more free runs down leg. This time the tossed up delivery zips away past poor old Karthik and away to the long leg boundary
goes back even though Kuldeep tosses it up outside off and defends towards short leg
"fullish on off stump, Pope is soundly behind it"

lunges forward to a good length ball outside off and pats it to the left of mid-off
"back of a length and outside off, taps to point"

"tosses it up outside off, Pope gets forward to block"
he's drawn forward by a loopy delivery outside off. Defends it well though
"googly, pitching on middle, but pitching short so Pope can jump back and smack it through the covers. And, unless I'm wildly mistaken, he may have read the variation out the hand"
reaches to the pitch of the ball outside off and smothers it
"a tad shortish and outside off, Pope jumps back and clatters it through point. Seems to be one of those early judges of length."
"good length and outside off, no shot"
firmly behind this back of a length delivery angled into off stump
"goes full on middle, and gets some shape away as reward. Pope, however, plays with a straight enough bat to find mid-on"
width on offer and Pope slices it to point
<b>beats him</b> as he goes wide of the crease and keeps hitting a full length. That gets the batsman forward and driving and the outswing does the rest
"into the pads, looking for the ball to straighten. It doesn't and Pope gets an easy put away through midwicket"
"slow through the air, and that's probably why Root is happy going back even to well flighted deliveries. Defends to short leg"
reaches out to a full toss but then misses out by finding midwicket
<b>doesn't read the googly</b> as Root goes back and feels for the ball outside off. That's why the left-arm wristspinner's on

"full and outside off, Pope drives with an open face to point"

reaches the tossed up ball on the full with a sweep and finds a single at deep square leg

"sweeps to long leg. Kuldeep, in his effort to toss the ball up, has offered a few too many full tosses"
strides forward outside off to block to cover

gets into the flick a touch too early and ends up offering a leading edge towards cover. Pandya looking better when he pitches it up
"full on off stump, Root presents the full face"

"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
"waits until the shortish delivery arrives under his eyes, which then allows him to turn it through midwicket"
defends a shortish delivery outside off through point
"plays it superbly! There isn't really all that much room on this short ball, but Pope sways away just a touch and carves the ball behind point, the bottom hand giving it plenty of power"
"<b>beats him</b> and it's a peach too! This ball may be 20 overs old, but in the hands of someone willing to hit the deck, it still causes problems. Shami angles it in, gets it to seam away and makes Pope look exactly like the 20-year old kid he is"
"full and outside off, drawing Pope into a drive on the up. Makes no connection again"
half-volley this time and Pope drives it sweetly to cover. The fielder puts in a dive to his right and parries it to mid-off
length ball drifts down leg
"good length on off stump, blocks"
goes wide of the crease to create the angle into the right-hander. But the end result he was looking for - some outswing - just doesn't happen. So Pope is able to flick it to long leg and sneak a couple of runs.
"<b>traps him in front</b>, at least according to umpire Dar! But Pope checks with his captain and then goes for DRS. So we get to see how this good length ball on off stump skids through and has Pope playing around it in a panic to get bat to ball. He's hit on the back pad. Right in front of middle and off. Ball-tracking says it'll hit the stumps and he's off"
gets an easy look-in as his first ball goes down leg
"<b>another appeal for lbw</b>, but umpire Dar is nowhere near interested. This chance is created by the awayswinger, a very full one that Bairstow gets an outside edge while trying to play towards mid-on."
"back of a length and outside off, blocks to point"
<b>beats him</b> as he goes back of a length and gets some away movement off the pitch.
goes searching for the ball outside off and comes away with only the voice ringing in his ear telling him 'why would you play at that?!'. Nearly nicks off.
"full and straight, looking for lbw, but Root is able to whip it away to the square leg boundary. Superb timing. And balance, which I'd wager is more important for this shot."

"manages to find just enough swing away from the bat, off a full length, to keep Bairstow honest"
"fullish delivery outside off, Bairstow blocks to the left of point. Ashwin dives to stop a single"
gets forward to defend a pitched up ball on off stump

taps the short ball on middle to mid-on and sets off.
"blocks with soft hands, looking for a single into the covers, but Bairstow says no and his captain is able to get back in time. These two were involved in that game changing run-out at Edgbaston. This time, they've learnt their lesson"

drives sweetly to the sweeper
"brings down a straight face, then rolls his wrists when he makes contact with the fuller delivery on middle, giving himself the best chance of securing runs (and not the leading edge) through mid-on"
"<b>keeps low</b> and he's caught in front! Timely strike for India, with lunch looming. Shami finds a way to make the ball scuttle through and Root is nowhere near prepared for it's mischief. One second, he's setting up to punch it into the off side. The next, he's slumped over, having been struck on the pad, right in front of off stump"
knocks the stumps at his own end while delivering a good length ball on middle. Buttler spirits it through wide mid-on without anyone noticing
another quick single as Bairstow plonks an angled bat down on a good length ball heading towards the top of off stump. Wide open spaces at point
walks down the pitch for a push to mid-off
"good length on off stump, Bairstow tackles it capably"
uses the angle into him to send the short ball off his hips and away to deep square leg
"<b>outside edge</b> but it doesn't carry to third slip. Knuckle ball from Pandya and if that didn't take sufficient pace off, Buttler's soft hands certainly did"
"good length outside off, Buttler walks at the bowler again, but doesn't do much more after that"
"one step down the pitch, then another, finally he reaches out for a fuller delivery outside off and gets an outside edge to the third man boundary"
"back of a length and outside off, Buttler chops it to the left of cover"
"generates that little bit of inswing, just enough to have Bairstow stuck in his crease and playing a feeble little flick. Inside edge bounces off the pad to point"
"walks at Ishant, who keeps the line outside off and gets away with the batsman playing no shot"
"steps out and leaves the inswinger, and has to weather a bit of an lbw appeal for his trouble. The ball had flicked the top flap of his pad before going through to the keeper. Wasn't coming in far enough"
makes that trip down the wicket again and defends the full delivery on off stump
manufactures a half-volley by his shimmies down the pitch and ever so deftly puts it away to the square leg boundary. England a shot away from taking the lead
"back of a length and outside off, Buttler bounds forward to meet it with a straight bat"
"seems to stay low again as Shami hits back of a length, outside off, and Bairstow appears a bit put off as he defends from the crease"
pushes to cover
"<b>England are in the lead</b> and it comes off a fittingly authoritative straight drive. Minimal effort from Bairstow as he simply leans into the shot, extending a defensive push"
half an appeal for lbw as Shami's inswinger has Bairstow in a little bit of bother. The front foot is plonked on off stump and the bat has to come around it. The ball is too quick to allow that
ambles down the pitch again to drive the full delivery to mid-off.
short of a good length and outside off. Bairstow punches to mid-off
"<b>inside edge</b> skitters past the stumps and to the long leg boundary. Difficult pill to swallow for Ishant and India after he secures a false shot from an aggressive Buttler, walking out of his crease and reaching away from his body"
"he's not entirely sure of this shot either, tentatively pushing at a full delivery swinging in from outside off. Inside edge results and Bairstow calls him through for a single"
"back of a length and outside off, Bairstow pushes to cover"
gets this shortish delivery to cut back into the right-hander. Bairstow has no trouble blunting it
"a touch more bounce, just enough movement in off the pitch and Bairstow's crunch through the covers becomes an inside edge that almost clatters onto leg stump"
"full and outside off, Buttler wanders out of his crease, eagerly, but then decides to let it go. #AntiClimax"
wafts at it outside off and <b>gets beaten</b>. Not exactly the kind of ball he'd like getting the better of him - short and outside off
"smacks it down the ground, the full face of the bat ruthlessly dealing with the most hopeful of inswingers, trying to catch him lbw or bowled."
"overpitched outside off this time and Bairstow sends it screaming through the covers. He made quick runs at Edgbaston. He's doing it again here, and it's bound to hurt India a lot more considering they're in the red now"
"back of a length and outside off, blocks"
"good length on off stump, keeps it out"
"full and outside off, drives to mid-off"
throws his hands at a teaser outside off and the resulting edge races away to the third man boundary. <b>England scoring at seven an over since lunch</b>
"bouncer, which gains so much height that Buttler's basically a spectator"
walks down the pitch and thumps the manufactured half-volley to mid-off. Rahane gets a hand to it and stops a boundary
"curls it into the right-hander, the ball dipping on Buttler as he leaves his crease once again. Ends up yorking himself"
"good length ball outside off, lets it go"
a touch of extra bounce has Buttler second-guessing his skip down the pitch and subsequent block. But the inside edge wanders away safely behind square leg
"huge appeal and it's given, even though Buttler's down the pitch again. England have no more reviews, but it probably wouldn't have helped this time either. Shami goes full and straight. The batsman walks across and falls over, playing a flick. He needs to make contact. He doesn't. Now he's back in the hut"
"full on off stump, Woakes presents the a defensive bat"
"just back of a good length, outside off, no shot"
another firm push off the straight bat from Woakes.
"pitches it right up, as he should to a new batsman, and gets some swing into Woakes. The ball skews off the inside edge and goes to midwicket"
<b>outside edge</b> scurries away to the third man boundary. Streaky drive on the up from Woakes even as this time Shami moves the ball away from the right-hander
"full and outside off, Bairstow looks to lash it through the off side, but ends up with an inside edge through square leg"
"fullish on and around off stump, Woakes defends and pulls the bottom hand off for good measure"
"<b>strikes him on the glove</b> with a bouncer! The line is perfect, the angle from over the wicket taking the ball straight at Woakes' throat. The batsman tries to fend it off, protect himself, and gets struck on his hand"
"back of a length and outside off, dabs to third man"
"<b>beats him</b> with one that holds its line outside off. Bairstow a bit loose as he goes searching for the big, booming on the up cover drive"
"fullish on off stump, Bairstow deflects it to mid-on"
"another short ball at Woakes, who this time swivels on his back foot and comfortably hooks it away to long leg"
"rooted in his crease as he basically presents the outside edge as tribute. Shami's ball, pitching on off stump and darting away off the seam, is too good"
"length ball outside off, Bairstow throws his bat at it and is again beaten. Very very weird innings from a proper batsman. It's almost as if he doesn't trust his defence"
"fullish on off stump, blocks"
"back of a length and outside off, Bairstow slices it to the sweeper"
defends a shortish delivery on middle for a single at midwicket
"full on middle, drives smoothly back at the bowler"
"nails the yorker on middle, but Bairstow keeps it out. Meanwhile, Ishant is running in while hiding the ball. Usually only happens when he's getting reverse"
<b>beats the inside edge</b> as he hits a good length and Bairstow makes the mistake of playing an on the up drive against obvious <b>reverse swing</b>
"goes wide of the crease, creating a steep angle into the right-hander. Bairstow looks to flick it away, but the ball pops off his pad and over to Ishant, who grabs it and instantly celebrates. India believe they have a catch here. And so strong do their believe it that <b>Kohli goes for a review</b>. UltraEdge, however, confirms that umpire Erasmus' on-field decision was correct. No spike as ball passes bat. The cursory check for lbw is also done, but that's definitely going down leg."
"fends it off his hips to the right of midwicket. The fielder swoops down on the ball and pings a throw at the strikers' end, and hits Woakes' bat, sending it clattering to the floor"
"back of a length on off stump, keeps it out"
"<b>more reverse</b> as Shami targets the stumps, a tactic that becomes all the more dangerous as the ball moves into the right-hander. Bairstow presses forward to defend but gets an inside edge"
<b>so close to off stump</b> and Bairstow makes no move to play the ball. This is enthralling.

"length ball fired down leg side, can't get bat on that"

<b>on the bounce</b> to deep square. A fierce flick from Woakes with no attempt to keep it down. It was on the pads and he leaned into the off side to get to this. Kuldeep stops to his right with an outstretched hand
"under-edge into the point area. Looks to slap a length ball on the up with a horizontal bat, can't time it"
"keeps back against a good length ball, worried perhaps by how it might turn, but it doesn't really. Bairstow ends up in trouble because of his own footwork, nothing the bowler has done, as he hurries into a defensive push"
there! Get forward when he tosses it up. That way you can launch him straight back over his head. Beautiful cricket. Brave cricket.

"gets back to a slow, tossed up offbreak and defends in front of the stumps"

"bouncer, which Woakes is happy to let drift away down leg"

"swats away the attempted bouncer to the square leg boundary. The plan is valid against Woakes, who has shown weakness to that length in the past. But this is wide outside off, and it's a tired effort too. Essentially became a gimme ball wide outside off, giving ample room to free the arms"

"full and outside off, drives through cover point"
"launches it over the top of midwicket and secures the three runs he needs to get on the Lord's honours board - the batting one (cause he's already on the bowling one). <b>Century No. 1 for Woakes</b> and it's a very very cultured knock. Took care early on not to play extravagant strokes, but always found the single when available. And now, with the bowlers tiring, he's cashing in."

"full and outside off, Bairstow lifts it over the top to the sweeper"
"<b>caught behind</b> and Bairstow falls seven short of a hundred! Expressionless as he leaves the field, but he should really be proud of the effort. England were 80-odd for 4 when he took charge. Now they have a 200-plus lead. Solid effort from a player constantly growing in stature. But he might do well to forget this ball, and the way he threw his bat at it, driving on the up and nicking behind. Great effort by Karthik too: he was moving to his left, with the angle of the ball coming into the right-hander, but then has to change direction and dive full-length to his right. That edge was travelling too."

<b>this looks plumb.</b> KL Rahul nods no as Pujara asks about the review. Anderson gets another with the one that comes in.

"<b>got him!</b> Taken at third slip. a very, very loose shot. No doubt brought about by the variable bounce on the last two balls. Rahane instinctively onto the front foot this time.

"short of a length on leg stump, whips it to deep square"

length ball in at the pads. Tapped to midwicket off the front foot
full inswinger at off stump. Jams it towards mid-on off the front foot
<b>oh too good.</b> He moves it both way and he's had every batsman second-guessing today. This one curves away past the outside edge after starting on a leg stump line

Aleem Dar says not out....and there's nothing on Ultra Edge as the ball passes glove and bat. That was off his shirt. Not out, review lost, and a good decision. Been a perfect Test for the umpires."
"<b>another review for caught.</b> This time from Kohli, and he's gone up as soon as Dar has given him. Looks like Ollie Pope at short leg who has lunged forward to take on that's come off his hip. Was there glove before though? <b>Yes there was!</b> It has brushed the knuckle before catching him on the hip. Kohli looked amused when he reviewed, suggesting he might not have felt that at all. Doesn't matter. It's 100% for the umpires. Kohli is gone, fending awkwardly again at big incoming delivery from Broad that was dug in back of a length."
"<b>now Karthik reviews!</b> Three in a row. Karthik is rapped in front of off stump and looks out, plumb. Consults with Pandya and goes for it, but it doesn't look good. Yep, he's gone. Big inswinger again, gets Dinesh Karthik. He's got another screamer and his horror return lengthens. Forward stride coming in late and at an angle. Broad hoops it in a long way and that's hitting middle and off"
<b>beats everyone.</b> Inswinger starts at middle stump and flies past the attempted flick and YJB's big dive to the left

It's beaten the inside edge on the angle and hit him on the flap of the pad...<b>and it's hitting leg stump!</b> Woakes gets the breakthrough! The bowling change does it. Different point of delivery, different movement off the pitch. Pandya gets forward to defend but he can't get it right first time. A good review. The first overturned decision. That's the end of their stand."
