Unfortunate end to an innings that started slow but had hit AB-mode now"
"gives him the charge while giving himself room, but only gets a top edge that flies high over his head. De Kock calls for it, runs till backward square leg and catches it. Nath won't be happy, his tardiness could have cost AB his wicket and he's thrown it away next ball"

"<b>that's some power</b> didn't time it at all, too short and there to be hit, but Hardik got a thick top edge. Still enough power on it to carry it over the long-on boundary"

"in his hitting arc again, and Hardik picks this up from outside off, almost on half-volley and swings this once bounce into the midwicket fence"

the pressure tells on Negi and he bowls it too far outside off
and that's all over. Pollard didn't even face a ball. Hardik swats this from outside off to long-on and they complete the win.
