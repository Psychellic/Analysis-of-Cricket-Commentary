"slower ball on the pads, he waits for it and flicks to square leg"
"down the track and looking to pull it, but misses the ball altogether. goes through him to the keeper"
"short ball on off stump, pulled past midwicket. Sloppy work from Sodhi, who was running across from mid-on. Slides to save but fumbles and the ball races to the fence"

"back of a length, 145.7 kph, coming back into the batsman, who defends from the crease"
"that's 148.5 kph. Back of length outside off again, defended to point by staying beside the ball"
"digs it in short, and Dhananjaya goes for the pull. Didn't quite get hold of it, but the pace on it was so much that it carries all the way over square leg"
"fuller outside off, driven back. The ball takes the inside half of the bat to the bowler"
"very full outside off again, almost a yorker. Jabbed to mid-on, who is well back on the edge of the circle and they take a quick single"
"loud appeal and he's given him! Dhananjaya has a short chat with Dickwella and walks off. He was hanging on the back foot and was caught on the crease, Southee pitched it up more, and got it to nip back. Hits him above the knee roll. Was it too high or going down? Dickwella didn't think so clearly, and Dhananjaya is on his way"
"good length angling slightly across, defended solidly back"
outside off and punched hard but can't go past the in-field
"good length on the stumps, defended to cover"
given a bit of width outside off and those strong forearms result in a punch that races past point and into the fence

"backs away but the bowler follows with a fullish ball, driven to long-off"
"good length on leg stump, turned away but there is a short fine leg in place"
"very full, just off the yorker length on middle stump, defended to cover"
"good length on the pads, he shuffles across and tucks him to deep square leg"
"very full on leg stump again, driven to mid-off. He's at the edge of the circle so they can take the run"

"short of good length, angled in, tucked behind square leg"
"short of length, wide, cut to deep cover"
backs away to a fuller one angling into him and pushes it towards mid-on
sliced off the outside edge to third man. This one's pitched up outside off and Dickwella was just backing away to give himself room. Moves too far and as a result can't find the middle as he opens up with hard hands
"full outside off, pushed to short cover and they risk a single. Seifert whips the bails off and appeals as the batsman dives. He's confident, but he's managed to drag the bat inside. Actually, hang on. Third umpire isn't convinced with the zoomed in angle. Initially, it seemed like he had the bat inside, but from a second angle it seems like the bat was on the line. Really thought he may have been secure here, but in any case the benefit of doubt is usually given to the batsman when it's this close. But Illingworth rules it out"
"spins in from a length outside off, shuffles across and blocks"

lashes at a fuller one and finds the gap between point and backward point
"Shanaka has been trapped leg before here. Loopy from Sodhi, inviting the sweep, which sure does offer an insurance against the lbw with a wider line of defence. But not when the ball curves in to tuck you up like that. You are sitting duck when that happens. Plumb in front of middle. Middle-order collapse again!"

advances down the ground and drills it straight to extra cover. Thisara was backing up a little and the fielder throws at the stumps. Hits them and they get the single eventually off the deflection anyway
""
"length ball, flicked off his hips to square leg. Oh that seems to have pinged him on the finger. He's getting attention from the physio. The last thing Sri Lanka need is a player retired hurt. Ferguson's pace means it's bounced near chest high, and hit the index finger of his top hand."
"back of a length again, bouncing up and angling across him, defended down"
"he was expecting the short one that time, and waiting on the back foot. Banged it in, and he rocked back to pull it to the midwicket fence"
"good length outside off, angling across, pushed to cover"
"very full that time, ends up as a low full toss on off stump. He wasn't expecting that, was hanging on the back foot, pushed it to wide mid-off"
"back of a length again, angling across, he stays in his crease and slashes hard, but Guptill at point dives to save runs"
"nicely tossed up and dipping on leg stump, he mis-reads the flight and it turns a hint to go past his attempted steer to square leg and hit the pad. half-hearted appeal, but that was going down leg"
"flatter and quicker but a bit short, helped along to square leg"
"that was a googly, but pitched on middle and went further away, giving him room to cut it past point"
"tossed up, very full on leg stump, driven off his toes to long-on"
"flatter quicker, wrong'un. Turns away from the left-hander after pitching on middle, and he plays with the turn to slap it through cover"
"another googly, but drifts away from him, pitches outside off and goes on. He's happy to leave it alone"
"<b>clobbered</b> too short on middle stump, he rocks back, swivels and pulls it. No effort to keep it down and didn't need to, because it sails over the deep square leg fence"
"goes round the wicket that time and keeps it in the channel. Quick ball at 148.7 and he's beaten by the pace, goes for a big booming drive and connects with air. That wasn't too far from off stump"
"another quick ball, 145 kph, back of a length on off, pushed back to the bowler off the toe end of the bat"
"fuller on off, driven uppishly but bounces short of cover"
"spears in at almost yorker length, but not quite nailed the yorker. Driven back to the bowler. 148.8 kph"
"<b>given out caught behind!</b> another one speared into the channel, tempting him to go for a big drive. There was an audible noise as ball went past bat and New Zealand went up spontaneously in appeal and it's given. But the batsman has reviewed it. there is a flicker on HotSpot and a spike when ball passes bat. So it'll stay out. The bat hasn't hit the ground either, so why did he review that? In any case, Kusal Perera's gone, and with him, you'd think go the last of Sri Lanka's hopes. Thisara can't do it solo from here, surely?"

"<b>take that</b> filthy bowling, long hop that just sat up and asked to be hit. Thisara duly obliged, going back and smacking it over deep midwicket"
"better length, fuller on the stumps and bowled slower. Thisara punches from the crease to mid-off"
"too full, angling across him, sliced over extra cover. The bat turned in his hand, but it was a safe shot even if it went in the air because no fielder was back there."
"bouncer again, rises to head high that time though, and he pulls it to deep midwicket, keeping it down"

"<b>dropped!</b> Again! Would you believe it? They put down six in the previous game, and now Thisara has been spilled twice. Extra cover it is as Thisara clubs this length ball and he dives forward but can't latch on"

"<b>what a catch!</b> Guptill pulls off a one-handed stunner! New Zealand make amends for the earlier lapses. Thisara backs away to this short one and slashes at it but with not enough room to free up his arms, can't really clear the in-field. Actually, would have if there was an ordinary fielder stationed there. Guptill's just a beast. Runs back from point and sticks the left hand out while leaping back to pluck it out of thin air.

"wide yorker outside off, he has an airy waft at it and doesn't connect"
"<b>this is ending quickly</b> typical tailender's dismissal. Came down the track more with hope than conviction, had an almighty swing at it, hoping to deposit over cow corner.
