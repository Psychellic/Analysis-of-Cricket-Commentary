"tossed up outside off, driven firmly to sweeper cover. Kohli and India off the mark"
"flatter one on middle, Rahul punches that into the gap, deep cover had to run around some distance to his right. Rahul is aware of the possibility of the second and completes it easily"
hit hard but straight to cover
"tosses it up nicely on middle and off, Rahul steps out and bunts it back down towards the bowler"
"drifting into the pads, worked wide of mid-on"
whipped between midwicket and mid-on this time. Tidy start from Dawson
"starts off with a back of length delivery outside off, punched to extra cover"
"not much room this time. This is another short of length delivery coming back in from wide of the crease, tapped to the man coming in from point"
the top edge flies wide of the keeper. Third man was fine and running towards the ball. It was dying on Billings. Excellent effort but it just eluded him. Just bounced before hitting the advertising triangle too. The key there was <b> Kohli was beaten for pace. </b>
"shows the full face of the bat to ease it back past the bowler, to mid-on, for a quick single"
"nips back into middle and leg, Rahul is cramped for room and has no option but to defend it gently to the leg side. He gave the impression that he was trying to whip it square"
tucked to square leg. Once again late inward movement for Mills. Excellent first over.
steps out and slaps the length ball straight to mid-on
"big appeal for lbw. Kohli looks to play a short-arm jab but the ball kept low and hit him on the pad. The keeper didn't look all that convinced. Really, really tight. I tell you what, <b> Kohli is lucky to hang around </b> That would have crashed into middle stump"
"whipped wide of midwicket for an easy single, brings those powerful wrists into play"
"angles a length ball into middle and leg, tucked to deep square leg"
"rolls his wrists over the delivery to keep it down and find the gap behind square on the leg side, deep square comes around to cut that off"
"excellent slower delivery, the off-cutter on off stump, Rahul looks to steer it wide of the keeper, but can't. Just didn't have the pace to work with."
"gets this back of length delivery to lift off the deck on off stump, punched to mid-off"
"stunning shot. Off the back foot and it sails over the ropes. Mid-off was just a mere spectator. Back of length delivery on off, Kohli stays inside the crease and punches this through the line. Those fore arms can fetch a million or more at an auction!"
"he's on his way, and how. This is a poor ball. Short and sliding into middle and leg, clipped away behind square. No chance for fine leg. Too easy for him"
"flays that over cover, didn't time it well but still managed to hit it over the infield, Root does well to hare across and pull it back in"
"back-of-the-hand slower delivery outside off, Kohli looks to play a flat-batted pull but can only toe-end it wide of the bowler towards mid-on"
"arches back and glides this over backward point, third man was too fine and so they come back for the second quite comfortably. India on the move"
"the change of pace has done the trick. This is slower and just a fraction wider, Kohli steps out to go over the top but had to reach out for it, and simply ended up dragging it to long-on. Big, big wicket. Stunned silence."
"pitched-up outside off, Rahul has the width to free his arms and he crashes that one bounce into the cover boundary. Struck that off the middle"
"slides this full delivery on the pads, worked wide of midwicket"
"beaten by the late movement. Raina hangs back and looks to run it down to third man, but misses it. That was bowled at 141kph"
uses the width and pace of Jordan to steer this down to third man and get off the mark
"looks to belt that down the ground but doesn't get the timing or power, down to long-on for a single"
"short and wide outside off, Rahul looks to flat-bat that over cover but can't reach out to the delivery"
steered down to third man for an easy single
"beaten again! Length ball slanted across, Raina looks for a hoick over midwicket but was too early into the stroke"
"this one's at length on middle and leg, turned wide of midwicket as they jog the single"
"one of the more attractive cover drives you will see! Overpitched, Rahul plants his front foot forward and brings his bat down in a nice little arc to ease it between cover and mid-off. Lovely"
"angles one into middle and leg, turned to the leg side as they get across for an easy single"
"brings his wrists into play, eased behind square on the leg side"
driven with the spin to long-off as they jog the single
"flatter one on middle and leg, punched to long-on"
"drifting into middle and leg, worked wide of square leg"
"delicate little reverse paddle, changed the bat grip even before the bowler delivered and got it wide of the keeper. Good work by short third man to give it chase and pull it back in. 50 up for India. Buttler tried the Dhoni-style Karate kick, but it was little too late"
"sliding down leg, Raina sweeps and misses, but India have an extra run"
"eased with the spin past cover, sensible from Raina"
"this one straightens after pitching, Rahul looks to work it to the leg side but gets it off the outer half of the bat, rolls back to the bowler"
"tossed up outside off, firm push to long-off"
"he was looking to go over midwicket but didn't get to the pitch, ended up bringing his bat and pad close to each other and defend"
"bunted to the man coming in from deep midwicket. Stokes is aware of the possibility of a second, and comes haring in to stop that"
"the old-fashioned slog sweep, but he didn't get any power behind that, partly because he didn't get underneath the flight. Remember these are big, big boundaries, and he ended up hitting the googly straight to Jordan at long-on. Excellent from Rashid."
"slow turn back into middle, Yuvraj bunts it back down the pitch"
"spins back in from outside off, tapped gently to the off side"
punched back to the bowler. Looks like there's some grip for the spinners here
gets to the pitch of the ball and eases it to sweeper cover
"squared up! The bounce, ooooo, this is delicious. Wonder what Ashwin thinks of this surface. Beaten fair and square, done in by the bounce as well"
"straighter one from around the stumps, Yuvraj prods forward and blocks"
gets into a terrible tangle as he shapes to sweep. The delivery drifted back in to beat him on the stroke and hit him on the pad. Umpire Shamsuddin isn't convinced. Close again.
"slow turn from middle, Yuvraj carefully defends to the off side"
"looks to pull, gets a bottom-edge that rolls to short fine leg"
takes it on the full and flicks it to wide long-on. Yuvraj off the mark
"he's biffed that into the stands at deep midwicket. Wow, that will be six on any ground in this whole wide world. Full toss on middle, Rahul steps out and swings like a golfer, connects. Crunching sound as ball met bat"
fierce sweep from outside off towards deep midwicket
"slider that keeps a touch low, Yuvraj looks to cut but misses"
"eased wide of short third man, Yuvraj ambles across for a single to keep strike"
steps out and ends up stabbing that indrifter with the pad
"clean, crisp drive. Backs away and eases it towards wide long-off. Excellent running to come back for the second"
"the umpire raised the finger even before Moeen could complete the appeal. Yuvraj got into a mess again, was off balance when he completed the sweep. This one drifted back in, straightened and would have crashed into <s> middle and leg. </s> Make that middle of middle"
drops it gently to the off side and gets off the mark
"whipped to the man at deep square. On the flatter side again, from Moeen"
"fuller on the pads, worked to deep square. Top over from Moeen"
"drifts in a full toss, swung leg side but Pandey doesn't get enough bat on it, down to long-on"
"that is massive. Belted that 30 rows back! Tossed up gently, Rahul uses his feet, makes some room and lofts it with the angle. Super stroke that"
"grip and turn this time, Rahul looks to work leg side but ends up lobbing it towards cover, the man in the deep had to run in a long way and they completed the second easily"
makes a bit of room and cuts that short delivery on middle to deep point
worked with the spin to long-on
full toss and he's picked the gap between deep midwicket and wide long-on easily
"slow turn back into middle, punched to long-on"
whip it to deep square and brings up a half-century. Applause from the dug out. Feast or famine it has been for him so far. India need him to stay right till the end
"works it with the spin to long-on, sensible from Pandey."
uppish but just wide of Morgan at midwicket. Looked to whip it squarer
worked from outside off towards wide long-on again
paddled round the corner to short fine leg
"sensational. Extra cover didn't move an inch. Rahul steps out, makes so much ground that he took it on the half-volley and belted that inside-out over the infield. Top shot"
"fires this full, flayed down to long-on"
"googly from outside off, Pandey didn't pick it and ended up getting a thick inside edge past the bowler"
"too full down leg, Rahul plays a fierce little sweep, so fine that short fine leg didn't need to move. Losing control at a vital stage here"
gets outside the line of that delivery and punches it down to deep midwicket
knocks this to Rashid's right and scampers across for a single. Looked like he was eyeing deep midwicket but didn't get to the pitch of the delivery
whipped to Root at midwicket. Looked to hit it towards long-on
"width on offer, flayed to deep point where there's protection"
"looks to slap that over cover, this one kept a touch low. Rahul may have also played outside the line of that slower delivery"
"walks across the stumps to paddle it over short fine, this kept a touch low again. Deflects off the pad to the off side and they steal a run"
"has he nicked that? Looks like the ball has clipped the stumps, but the bails haven't come off. Pandey looked to ease this behind point but it was too close to him. Bail went out of the groove and fell back in. How lucky is he?"
mistimes a pull towards deep square. Super over from Stokes
mistimes a flat-batted pull to mid-on
was through with the pull even before the ball got to him. It was the back-of-the-hand slower delivery. Excellent change of pace. Hit Rahul on the abdomen
slogged from outside off towards deep midwicket
"hits the deck hard, that one's at 140 clicks, Rahul looks to fetch a flat-batted pull from outside off, gets a thick inside edge to short fine leg"
"pulled, but can't get enough power on the stroke, straight to deep midwicket"
backs away and swats it one bounce to long-on. Excellent over
"looks to go over mid-off but is cramped for room, hit to cover instead"
"into the blockhole, squeezed to long-on"
"sliced down to third man, Mills nearly over-ran but managed to put his left hand out to prevent it from spinning away"
"drilled down the ground but there's only so much power he can get under that yorker, back for the second easily. Super running"
"swings leg side but no timing again, down to midwicket"
"full toss on off, Rahul looks to belt that through cover but gets a thick edge that beats third man. A boundary after 19 deliveries. Not pretty, but they'll take runs however they come at this stage. Stokes grimaces, it was an excellent over until then"
"looks to walk across and swing to the leg side but Jordan fires this wide, pushed to cover"
"struck that really well, but picked the lone man at deep midwicket. This was a slower deliver, Rahul read it off the hand, set himself up to muscle it towards the big boundary there but hit it straight to the man. End of a super knock from Rahul."
"short outside off, punched wide of cover. Huge roar as Dhoni gets off the mark"
"right into the blockhole, Pandey somehow manages to keep that out by jamming his bat down in time, gets an inside edge to short fine leg"
"steered off the back foot to point, they scamper a quick run"
"muscled over the infield, down Stokes who does well to run to his left from midwicket and save three runs. That was the first proper shot from Pandey's blade today"
"short and wide outside off, mistimes an attempted slap to deep point"
pulled but straight to short fine on the bounce. Two yards on either side and it would have beat the man
"he's clobbered that deep into the stands at long-on. Slower and fuller, Pandey made room, picked the delivery off the hand, got underneath the delivery and muscled it. Fetch that!"
"pulled, this time on the bounce to deep midwicket. The throw lands awkwardly towards Buttler, who fumbles, and they get an overthrow."
"got him, another slower delivery. Pandey was backing away to hit that over cover, but the ball dips with the angle, beats his swing and shatters the stumps. Tough day at the office for Pandey. Didn't get going at any stage."
"swing and a miss. Another slower delivery, was looking to biff this across the line but was through with the stroke way too early"
pulled straight to Stokes at deep midwicket
"squeezed down to long-on, Dhoni was halfway through the second when Pandya turned. Lightning quick"
"slides this down leg, the slower delivery gone wrong. Pandya lets it go"
"unfortunate way to go. Pandya drills this down the ground, the ball smashes into the stumps at the bowler's end and deflects to Jordan, who is alert enough to uproot the stump. The more important thing from India's point of view is Dhoni will have strike."
"hit straight to Morgan at cover, but Dhoni flatly refuses the run"
"pulled from outside off towards deep square, Dhoni had turned for the second even before Mishra completed the first. Moeen knew the right end to throw, lobs it on the bounce to Jordan, who breaks the stumps. Mishra had already given up and had turned towards the pavillion"
"drags it back onto the stumps. Jordan ends a cracking last over. Bowls the knuckle ball at length outside off, Dhoni looked to fetch this from way outside off over the leg side, but only managed an inside edge that bounced onto the stumps"
"drifts into middle and skids on, defended back to the bowler"
"slower through the air, outside off, drives and gets a thick inside edge back down to the bowler"
"pushed wide of cover, they scamper across for a quick single"
"tossed up outside off, this one turns away a wee bit, pushed to Kohli at cover"
"slides into middle and leg, turned to square leg"
"looks to play a reverse sweep, bottom-edges it to Bumrah at short third man. Good start for India"
"back of length on middle and leg, tucked to midwicket for a quick single"
"shapes to drive but has broken his bat in the process, straight to cover"
punched down to mid-off when Kohli does superbly well to dive full stretch to cut that off
"full and swinging into middle and leg, flicked to deep midwicket"
"too short, he goes through with the pull but it didn't quite bounce as much as he would have liked, straight to Rahul at deep midwicket"
"slower and fuller on off, eased to Raina, who doesn't collect it cleanly to give away a run. He ran in too hard in trying to attack the ball"
"oh, lovely! Too much flight, he step out and swings this over long-on. No fear whatsoever. Clean strike that. He watched it land in the stands and checked his pose for the cameras"
"heaved into the leg side, one bounce to deep midwicket this time"
"looked like he mistimed it, but there was still enough to clear long-on. Tossed up outside off, this was a slog from outside off."
"quicker through the air, lands this full on middle, pushed back to the bowler"
"pushes outside the line, gets an inside edge onto the pad, deflects to short third man"
"slow turn from middle, punched to long-off"
"what was he thinking? Gives him the charge, Nehra sees that and bangs this short, Billings was cramped for room, beaten for pace but still went through with the pull, only to get a top edge to Bumrah, who settled underneath it coming in from fine leg to complete the catch under pressure. Nehra points to Kohli, who is pumped. Big wicket!"
"leading edge, and Raina takes a dolly at mid-on. Two in two and the roar in Nagpur tells you the story! Looked to work it to the on side but looked like the length ball stopped on him to take the leading edge. Raina was never going to drop that. Looked like Roy was surprised by the spongy bounce. India are back in this"
"no, he can't.  But this is an excellent delivery, in the off stump channel, left alone"
"this one nips back into middle and leg, turned to long leg"
taps it gently towards point and scampers across for a single
"rapped on the glove, extra bounce on that occasion. There's some juice on this surface? Or is it an illusion"
"tossed up outside off, driven firmly to long-off"
"prods outside the line, gets a thick inside edge towards square leg. Drift for Chahal. Lovely bowling this"
punched down the ground to Yuvraj who runs to his left to cut that off at mid-on
"not much turn, this one slides across, driven to mid-off"
"turned with the spin to Bumrah at short fine, there's a deflection onto the stumps off Dhoni's gloves, but Root had completed the run comfortably"
"backs away but Chahal gets this to drift back in and skid on, tapped wide of cover. Superb comeback from Chahal"
"angles a length ball into middle from wide of the crease, hit high on the thigh pad as he looks to work it square on the leg side"
"hits the deck hard again at length, Root gets it onto the bottom of the bat a h turns it to the leg side. Kept a touch low again"
"punched straight to Rahul at point, there was a hint of width on that delivery"
"picks the gap this time. Field up on the off side. Slower delivery, he waited, waited and then punched it to the left of point. Superb placement"
whipped to Pandey at deep midwicket. Powerful wrists
"lands it at length on off, punched back to the bowler"
"starts with a slider on middle and leg, pushed off the back foot to long-on"
tickled with the spin past Yuvraj at short fine leg
"skids back in, Root looks to work it to midwicket, gets a thick inside edge to square leg"
"cut away, down to Pandey at deep cover"
opens the face of the bat to steer it wide of deep point
"steered with the spin to deep point, Chahal did well to get to the ball, but it was a loopy throw, which meant it took longer than Dhoni would have liked. Had he fired it in, the ball would have skidded on with the dew. Root was comfortably in"
"drifts this into the pads, he shapes to sweep, the ball deflects off the pad to short fine leg"
"slow turn into middle and leg, worked to square leg"
"too short on middle and leg, punched to deep midwicket. Pandey comes haring in to keep it down to a single"
"steps out to work it past the bowler, gets an inside edge to midwicket"
tucked wide of Nehra at short fine leg
"punched past a diving Kohli at cover, long-off comes around to stop that"
"too short outside off, lucky to get away. It was the off break too, punched to long-off"
"gets outside the line of the stumps and sweeps wide of Nehra at short fine leg. No chance for square leg, who had to come around a long way"
"gets a thick inside edge on the drive, Nehra simply escorts the ball to the boundary from short fine leg. Lazy effort. Didn't look like stopping it. Should have been nothing more than a single, or two at max"
punched to wide long-on
uppish and on the bounce to Kohli at midwicket
"deflects off the pad to short fine, they pinch a single"
"hint of width, cracked away to deep cover"

driven uppishly with the spin to long-off
"brings out the reverse sweep, but straight to deep point"
"looks to work it leg side, gets a leading edge that falls short of Kohli at cover"
backs away and punches it on the up to long-off
"heaved into the leg side and Morgan has found the man at deep midwicket. As simple as they come. It was the off break again, Morgan ended up dragging it from outside off and Pandya took a dolly. Mishra jumps in joy. Wonder if the two-three minute break between play had anything to do with the dismissal. <b>200th T20 wicket for Mishra </b>"
worked with the spin to the leg side as they jog the single
"beauty of a delivery, but Mishra has overstepped here. Big, big no ball, so a reprieve for Stokes. Done in by the drift and the turn as the off stump takes a beating. He should have been walking back, but instead, will face a <b> free-hit </b>. Went through his defense, but his celebration had to be cut short"
"fired into middle, squired behind square on the off side to Nehra"
worked against the turn to long-on
"appeal for lbw, but that was sliding down leg. Would have comfortably missed leg stump. Looked to work it past midwicket"
"this one drifts in and straightens from around the stumps, Stokes gets forward and blocks"
"excellent stop off his own bowling. Punched down the ground, moved swiftly to his right to stop it"
"fired down leg, got the direction wrong. Dhoni did well to stop that"
"poor from Raina this time. Did it slip out? Down leg, Dhoni can't get to it. Beats Nehra too, who runs behind it and then somehow manages to pull it back in."
"big appeal for lbw. This was a full length delivery, Root was looking to sweep but got into a tangle. Missed it completely. May have missed leg."
uppish but wide of Kohli at midwicket
short-arm jab to deep midwicket
"too short, swept hard to Chahal at deep backward square leg"
muscles the pull but Bumrah does well to come around and keep it down to a single at deep midwicket
"off break again, whipped to deep midwicket"
"slow turn but drifting into middle and leg, worked to the man coming in from deep midwicket. Two was the call but good work from Pandey"
"cramped for room, shaped to cut and readjusted to bunt it back down to the bowler"
"tossed up outside off, worked to wide long-on"
"misses a slog sweep, beats the under-edge. Excitement from the crowd as Dhoni whips the bails off, but the back foot was planted inside"
"looks to sweep from outside off, bottom-edges it to the leg side. Can't get enough bat, and so Dhoni manages to stop that"
"clubbed down the ground, no chance for long-on. Too short, picked the length, made room and flat-batted it"
"bye bye ball. Easily done. Steps out, gets to the pitch of the ball and wallops that over long-on"
worked across the line to long-on this time
gets across the stumps and eases it to mid-on
flicks a full toss from outside off to deep midwicket
"eased with the spin to long-off, sensible"
slaps that down the ground to long-off
"fired into middle, punched down to mid-on"
"width outside off, crashed to Kohli at the edge of the circle at cover"
"gives him the charge, Chahal shortens his length. Stokes bunts it into the gap at deep midwicket and gets back for the second without any stress"
"muscles the pull off the back foot. Rahul at long on may have thought he was in business, but that was just for a split-second. Flat hit that sailed over."
"slides one across Stokes, who pats it wide of cover"
"width outside off, flayed to mid-off. Bumps into Kohli's knee"
"crunching drive past Kohli at extra cover this time, the ball travels quickly on this outfield because of dew. Back for the second easily"
"full toss outside off, he walks across the stumps and whips him into the midwicket boundary. Making batting look too easy"
"whipped, and whipped well. Pandey comes around to cut that off at deep midwicket"
"length ball that nips away a wee bit from off stump, defended to cover"
direct hit at the bowler's end from Kohli at cover and it may have been close. Simple touch and run cricket when they're not hitting the boundaries
"floats this full on middle and leg, worked to long-on"
"looks to reverse paddle him, gets some bat on it, straight to Yuvraj at short third man"
advances down the pitch and pulls him down to deep square
pulled but straight to Bumrah at deep square. Lucky to get away with that
"slower and fuller on middle, Stokes looks to heave this into the leg side but was way too early into the stroke. Once he missed it, he was absolutely dead. Is there life in the game yet?"
drops it into the off side gently and they steal a quick single
"dot to start. Hits the deck hard, Buttler checks his drive, straight to Kohli at cover"
too close to cut. Wasn't all that short too. Through to Dhoni
"chopped down to point, Yuvraj comes around to cut that off. Gives Bumrah a mouthful, asking him to perhaps be at the stumps"
"another dot. This is a superb slower delivery. Spongy bounce, he looks to heave across the line but missed it completely. Root under pressure now suddenly."
"misses another slower ball. Off cutter from Bumrah, looks to play a reverse paddle over short third man but was too late on the stroke. On the bounce to Dhoni"
heaved into the leg side but it falls in between midwicket and long-on. Excellent over. Pandya came charging in from the deep but couldn't get there.
"right into the blockhole on middle, squeezed to cover"
"once again into  no man's land. Miscue. Plonks towards the edge of the circle at midwicket, they scamper back for the second. Got this off the toe end of the bat, landed it between three fielders"
"hit straight into Nehra's shin. Yorker length, tailing away late. Didn't have the length to hit down the ground. Super delivery"
"whipped into the midwicket boundary. Banged in short, cramped for room but he went through with the stroke and got enough bat. At 135 clicks, it was sitting up nicely for him to heave it into the leg side. Pressure released."
"tails the yorker away, comes back for the second as Rahul was caught napping at long-off. It was no more than a bunt down the ground"
"the captain tips this over the long-on boundary. Fetched the length ball from outside off, didn't get hold of it but it still had enough to sail over. Kohli was running backwards, the momentum was taking him over, so he didn't have time to steady himself. In the end, he tried to palm the ball back in but in vain. This game has turned and how"
"appeal for lbw, and that's a wicket that will breathe life into the Indian cmap. Looked like an optimistic appeal but the umpire raised the finger quickly. Root tried to pull across the line when he could have simply tucked it to the leg side. <b> Looks like there was an inside-edge. </b> Root unlucky"
"slower delivery, looks to work it to the leg side, gets a bottom edge that rolls to the off side"
"swing and a miss. Slow off-cutter, but the key was the length. This was much fuller, Buttler swung way too early, on the bounce to Dhoni who collects it cleanly, and do they don't chance a bye"
"rattles the stumps. This one's a length ball that is angled in from wide of the crease, Buttler looks to pull but the ball hurries onto him, cramps him for room, skids on and deflects of the pad onto the stumps. The danger man is gone, the crowd erupts"
swings and misses. The ball keeps low and beats the inside edge but they take the bye. Dhoni flicks an under-arm throw but misses at the striker's end. Was through with the stroke really early
"swings, misses and Bumrah has done it or India. Kohli is pumped. India have clinched a win that didn't look possible. Floats this full and wide, Moeen backs away to loft it but misses. What a comeback, what a game!"
