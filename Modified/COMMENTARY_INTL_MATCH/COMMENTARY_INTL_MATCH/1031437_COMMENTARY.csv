"lovely start! Over the wicket, short of a length, good carry as it climbs past Cook's outside edge and de Kock takes at shoulder height"
"this one is pushed down the leg side, Cook misses an attempt to flick it away"
"this one is very full, outside off, Cook is a little late as he jabs over the top of it without much footwork"
"full at off stump, Cook gets half forward and nudges to the leg side wide of mid-on to get the score up and running"
"comes round the wicket straightaway to Jennings, it's full outside off and left alone"
"back of a length, angling in at off stump, left on length as well as line...and that's the first over of the Test summer"
"starts on a good length outside off, 80mph, a hint of wobble, left alone"
"short of a length at off stump, behind the line and defended towards mid-off"
"fuller, outside off, tries to get forward but the feet still a little stuck and the ball takes a thickish inside half of the bat back towards Philander"
"did that keep a fraction low? Or perhaps Cook was deep in the crease, was at off stump, jabbed into the covers...a no-ball as well"
"pushed across wider outside off, left alone"
"on the pads, touch of swing, clipped sweetly through square leg and wide of long leg"
"and he's overstepped again, this is full and straight, clipped to midwicket"
"that's sweetly punched, gets into a better position coming forward, plays the full delivery to mid-off"
"round the wicket, short of a length, this one dies through to the keeper and de Kock does well to get his right glove down to it"
"gets inside the line and works this off his hip very fine, neatly done by Jennings who turned his wrists at the last moment"
"plays this very late, a fuller delivery, he looked in two minds whether to play or leave and it runs off the face towards third slip"
"full, wide outside off, he's late on it as he reaches well away from his body with a bit of a half-hearted poke"
"a straighter delivery and very nicely worked away through the leg side, a lovely piece of timing and the outfield is always fast here"
"flung full and wide outside off, left alone"
"nicely bowled, tighter to off stump and comes in at Jennings on the angle from round the wicket. He holds the bat inside the line"
"and that's got 'im! He's churned out the runs for Essex, but has nicked off early today. A short-of-a-length ball angled across, Cook pushes at it away from his body and the edge snaffled by de Kock"
"this zips across back of a length outside off, some late movement as it reaches de Kock"
"this is a fraction shorter, Ballance pulls his bat and gloves inside the line"
"well bowled! This is fuller, Ballance gets forward and the ball scoots past the outside edge"
"pulls the length back a little, Ballance plays with a slightly open face and the ball slides wide of backward point towards third man"
"full at off stump, 79mph, defended to point"
"round the wicket, a bouncer over off stump, he ducks"
"good length outside off, left alone"
"Morkel has ended up on his knees in the middle of the pitch...a delivery angled into the pads, may have taken an inside edge as it looped wide of short leg"
"full outside off, defended towards mid-off"
defended from off stump to the leg side
"a short delivery outside off, Ballance drops his hands and sways out of the line"
"on middle and leg, hint of swing, takes the pads"
"given! S Ravi waited a long time, then up went the finger. Jennings trapped on the crease, and he's opted not to review after a discussion with Ballance. Did it pitch outside leg? Was nicely bowled, reasonably full, beat Jennings' inside edge as he didn't get that far forward"
"good delivery! Full and straight, makes him play, squeezes off a thick inside edge down to long leg"
"full outside off, left alone"
"worked away off the pads wide of square leg, it's a brace as long leg gets round the boundary"
"full at off stump, defended with soft hands towards gully"
"full outside off, 84mph, left alone"
well bowled! Beats the outside edge with a good length delivery. Held its line off the seam and Root pushed at it
"takes the aggressive option as Rabada drops short outside off, upper cuts it high over the slips to the pavilion"
"fuller, wide outside off, he doesn't need to play"
"that was a bit odd, a short-of-a-length delivery outside off, Root tries to play off the back foot and is beaten then indicates the ball didn't get up as expected"
"full outside off, 85mph, nice carry through to the keeper"
"short of a length at off stump, he watches it go ythrough"
"fuller, outside off, Ballance shuffles across and defends to cover"
"full again, he plays quite late, the ball runs towards fully"
"pushed across a little wider outside off, for a second think Ballance considered a cut but he left it alone"
"nicely bowled, full at the stumps, Ballance almost gets into a bit of a tangle as it straightens on him late"
"lovely testing stuff, full at middle and off, defended to the on side"
"good length outside off, 85mph, left alone"
"wider, shorter, outside off...he hasn't quite things in sync, but it's early days"
"short of a length outside off, 87mph, de Kock takes this in front of his face"
"beats him this time! Getting closer to off stump, it was short of a length, Root tried to cut square and is beaten over the top edge"
"loses his line a little again, flung wide outside off, left alone"
"and again, it's through to the keeper, from a fuller length this time"
"full at off stump, finds the outside edge but Ballance played with soft hands so it doesn't carry to third slip"
"full outside off, left alone"
"full at off stump, he gets onto the front foot and drives wide of mid-off"
"what a beauty! That's the best of Philander. Unplayable. Back of a length, decks late off the seam to beat the outside edge"
"that's a cracking shot in response, Philander gets fuller and wider, a lovely piece of timing as he drives through the covers"
"angled across outside off, left alone"
"back of a length, defended to cover"
"short of a length outside off, climbs at head height to de Kock"
"that's a good nut, fuller and closer to off stump, nips back considerably off the seam"
"just gets away with it! Heart-in-mouth moment for the new skipper. The sub Markram at long leg and he wasn't right on the boundary. A short ball, well directed, Root went for the hook and the top edge sailed down towards him and he couldn't back-track fast enough. That has to go down as a miss"
neatly punched through the off side
"full outside off, defended to point...88mph"
"full, wide, left alone"
"full at the stumps, flicked down to long leg"
"round the wicket, full at off stump, defended to the covers"
"that's another strong drive from Ballance, gets nicely forward as Morkel overpitches outside off and dispatches it through the off side"
"drags the length, brings a strangled appeal for lbw as it beats the inside edge but the angle not working in his favour...probably high as well"
works this off stumps through square leg
"and again, through the off side, more of a punchy shot this time and not quite the same power so it gets pull up by the cover rope"
"short, wide, Ballance has a slash and a miss...not great cricket all-round. De Kock takes it in front of first slip"
"full at off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"full outside off, 89mph, left alone"
"at the stumps, good wheels, Ballance a little hurried into his defensive push towards mid-off...91.7mph, that's why!"
"wider again, left alone"
"comes round the wicket, back of a length outside off, left alone"
"very full, very straight, wide angle into the stumps, dug out from deep in the crease"
"a play and a miss, in that dangerous channel outside off, and Root has a nibble. Well, more of a chomp really. He went for that, off the back foot, but no contact"
"more circumspect this time, outside off and left alone"
"full, and punched to cover"
"outside off, Ballance drops the hands and lets the ball whistle harmlessly by"
"nibble off the seam, Ballance is right back on the stumps - as is his wont - and up goes the finger! Looked like it might be an inside edge on first viewing, but Ballance's clear indecision in <B>reviewing</B> rather rules that out. Sliding down leg? Potentially, but he doesn't look confident. With good reason! That is slamming into middle and leg!"
"wide on the crease, clipped urgently off the pads and into the gap at midwicket"
"that's a nut! Angled into the off stump, nipping sharply off the seam. An inch tighter to off stump and that would surely have taken the edge"
"hanging on the back foot, dabbed into the gully"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
stoutly into line to defend down the ground
"outside off, dabbed through third man"
deflected into the gully with soft hands
"short and sharp, lifting off the seam and through to the keeper, past an abandoned uppercut from Root"
"on the pads, clipped through backward square leg"
"outside off, an attempted chop through the off side, can't make proper contact"
"zing. That's a lovely line, angling in, nipping away. Bairstow played the original line and the ball ghosted through to the keeper"
"a touch more width, and solidly clocked behind point. Good riposte from Jonny"
"<B>dropped!</B> Flashy from Root, flinging the bat at a wide one, and Duminy at gully couldn't get his hands up in time. That went quickly, but eminently catchable"
"left alone this time, as Root recalibrates"
"full length, and blocked back down the track"
"poked into the off side, and jogs through for the single"
"back of a length, stabbed firmly into the cordon, but always heading down, bouncing short of Duminy. Dicey times though!"
left alone with a flourish
"tight defence, pushed back up the pitch"
"another hard-handed drive, another ball that keeps the cordon interested. Kuhn at third slips dives to intercept, on the bounce"
"wider line, left alone"
full length once again
awkward extra bounce on a wide line. Bairstow shapes to cut but the ball hops over his blade as he flinches outside off
no stroke to this one
"on the back foot, riding the bounce, stabbing into the covers"
"outside off, climbing through to the keeper"
"full length, attacking the base of the stumps. Defended to the off side"
"on the pads, a rare loose one, and that's firmly clipped through backward square. Good timing, racing down the slope"
pushed into the off side
"an open-faced drive, gathered on the bounce in the gully"
"looped onto a good length, drilled back to the bowler"
"good attacking line and length, good flight and bite, demanding a stroke in response"
"slightly leg-sided and swept, but under-edged"
calmly onto the front foot
"big stride forward, sniffing that leather"
solidly blocked
"tight line, a hint of swing, blocked"
"up on the toes, dabbed into the off side"
pushed out to point
"a bit of swing, but straight from the hand. Left alone outside off"
"on the pads, a freebie, and Root makes no mistake. Clipped solidly through square leg"
"back on that waspish Philander length, tight wicket-to-wicket line, a modicum of shape away from the bat, and blocked on the back foot"
"up on the toes, cracked into the covers, sharp running to pinch the single"
"head over the ball, driven into the off side"
"down the track, a firm clip to wide mid-on, good running and sharp fielding as the shy hits the non-striker's stumps"
forward and tapped to the off side
forward and uneasily blocked as Maharaj sneaks in his quicker arm-ball
stabbed down the track. Tidy over
"fenced off the pads, into the leg side"
"width, and swing. Root shoulders arms"
"gottim! Full and straight, hits the seam, thwacks the pad, and Bairstow is so far back in his crease that a review would be a dereliction of duty! Philander has his third, and England are officially in strife"
"on the toes, that is a total freebie for a man with Stokes' power and timing. Clipped aggressively through midwicket to open his account"
"outside off, Stokes gets into position for a wallop then shoulders arms"
"outside off, through to the keeper. No stroke offered"
"onto the front foot, pushed into the covers"
"forward once more, head right over the ball"
forward and blocked into the covers. Maharaj really getting a shift on here. It's almost as though South Africa fancy another over from Philander before lunch...
"swept, round the corner"
"over the wicket, solidly blocked"
"outside off, a teasing line and length, uneasily forced into the off side off the back foot"
"that's his line, back of a length, a bit of swing, creating indecision outside off stump"
"and this one nips the other way to crash into the thigh pad! Extra bounce strangled the lbw appeal at birth,  but Philander won't mind seeing that from a 25-over ball"
"tight wicket-to-wicket line, Root squares up to defend"
clipped off the toes to bring Stokes onto strike
stretching forward to block back down the pitch
"well bowled again, forcing Stokes to get into line to defend. Which he does to good effect. But that is emphatically South Africa's morning"
"full outside off, left alone"
"shapes back from a full length, defended on the walk slightly to cover"
what a ball! That's a beauty. Angled in at off stump on a good length then nips away off the seam to defeat Root
"fuller, he strides forward and drives without pristine timing through the covers"
"slips into the pads, clipped strongly through the leg side and has the placement to beat long leg"
driven to mid-off
"full outside off, left alone"
"back of a length, nice line, and good carry through to the keeper"
walks forward on off stump and plays solidly to mid-off
"short of a length, crisply punched off the back foot to cover"
played into the off side
"full at middle and off, defended on the front foot to point...Rabada resumes with a maiden"
"short of a length, comes back in at Root, defended on the back foot"
"goes fuller, gets too straight, flicked off the pads through straight midwicket"
"keeps it full, but this time he's on off stump, Root defends towards mid-on"
"waits for this one outside off, plays it quite late with an open face and slices the ball towards third slip"
"beats him again, similar to that earlier one, coming in at off stump, Root feels he has to play and the ball then straightens past the edge"
"fuller, he comes forward, sweetly struck back down the pitch but Morkel is able to get his left hand down to it"
"good stride forward into a length delivery, 86mph, defended to cover"
"that's a cracker, Rabada had come round the wicket, it's short of a length, Stokes stands tall and drives off the back foot through the covers"
"fuller, at off stump, defended...90mph"
"fraction shorter, defended on the back foot"
"full outside off, left alone"
"angling in towards off stump, but wide enough to shoulder arms"
"short of a length, played on the back foot"
"outside off, quite full, but de Kock still takes it at chest height"
"full and straight, a bottom-handed flick from Root finds mid-on"
"this is a bit more unconvincing from Root, slicing across the ball and it takes a thick outside edge towards point"
gets well forward on off stump and drives back to the bowler
"that's a very nicely controlled stroke, perfectly balanced this time, driven behind point off the back foot and splits gully and backward point"
"short of a length, angled at off stump, pushed to midwicket"
defended on the back foot
"edged, flies over the slips! Full and wide, Stokes reaching for it and gets enough wood on it to fly through the gap and high as well to third man"
defended to mid-off
cut firmly into the pitch and it bounces out to cover
"full and wide, takes the toe end of the bat as he drives to point"
"a short ball, but not a bouncer, Root rolls his wrists and pulls to deep square leg"
"full outside off, left alone"
"angled across, full, 84mph and left alone"
"that's a dreamy straight drive from Stokes, just eases forward into a full ball and sends it straight down the ground. Doesn't get better"
"plays forward again to a delivery not quite so full, trickles off an inside edge to the leg side"
defended with an open face to point
a strong flick off the pads to deep square
strides onto the front foot and drives to point
defended to the covers

"a short ball, well directed at off stump, Root hops behind the line and defends"
"very full, very wide, left alone"
"full, solidly driven to mid-off"
"and he's off! Uses his feet, gets to the pitch and lofts this straight down the ground. Another lovely shot. Completely in control"
"quicker, flatter, defended on the back foot"
"outside off, slides on with the arm, defended to the off side"
"a little more air this time, Stokes gets a good stride forward and defends"
"excellent use of the crease, he rocks back and then whips a delivery that wasn't that short out to deep midwicket"
"a bouncer, over middle and off, Stokes sways out of the line while keep his eye (mostly) on the ball"

"uses his bottom hand to shovel a full, straight delivery to the leg side"
driven to mid-off
"forward, bat in front of pad, defended"
"held this back a fraction, just a hint of turn, defended"
"quicker, flatter, pushed onto the pads but Stokes can't beat midwicket with his flick"
"gets away with his! Was going down the ground again, didn't get it as cleanly as the previous one, he stayed in his crease, mid-on was hanging back but couldn't run back underneath the chance"
worked away
"over the wicket, 88mph, driven to mid-on"
"a short ball and he's very quickly onto it, pulls in front of square...that's the fifty stand, dominated by Stokes"

"on the pads, flicked to deep square leg and that's a fifty...leading from the front"
"back of a length, punched out to deep midwicket"
defended into the covers
"a short ball and that's a superbly timed and placed, got well over the ball, rolled his wrists and places it between deep square and long leg. That's so good. Was 88mph, too"
"We have a <b>review</b>. Another short ball, Root pulled again and it loops into the slips where it is caught. Ah, well, this might be a no-ball in any event. Actually, he gets away with that. It's so close! Third umpire says benefit of doubt to the bowler. Root is through the shot, the ball misses the bat and takes the helmet. So will stay not out"
"negotiated without alarm, prodded into the covers"
"working around the front pad, clipped to leg"
"a bit of ambition in that slog-sweep, but didn't get hold of it at all as it dribbled to square leg"

nudged to leg
forward and blocked

chiselled up to mid-on for the single
pushed to cover
"down the track, clipped through midwicket"

forward and blocked back down the pitch
onto the front foot and pushed back to the bowler
"dabbed to mid-on, where the ball takes off a touch alarmingly out of an old foothole. No damage done"

defended

forward and defended
"on the back foot, clipped through the leg side"

"outside off, fairly nondescript sighter, pushed through point off the back foot"
"up on the toes, as Morkel comes round the wicket to Stokes. Punched to mid-off"
"lovely shot for none. A full-blooded down-on-one-knee drive into the covers, but can't beat the tumbling short cover"
patted to mid-off
"<B>bowled off a no-ball!</B> What a stunning delivery too! Wa-ay over the line, but it was full length, nipped back off the seam and through the gate, as Stokes was left slumped in a heap as the top of his leg bail was flicked off! Big, big moment..."
"full length, met with long levers and punched to cover"
"outside off, lots of width, and Root just fillets a four through third man"
"onto the front foot, blocked"
"leg-stump line, dabbed down the pitch"
"fully forward, meeting the military medium pace with military discipline and a ramrod straight bat"
clipped to midwicket
"slower ball, though all things are relative. Very full and clipped to midwicket"
"full toss, a loopy attempted yorker, picked early and clipped behind square where the fielder parries but can't save. Stokes celebrates his fifty, but he's actually on 49, because the Lord's board has credited him with the four no-balls!"
"can't bowl there to Joe Root. On the toes, easy as you like into the leg side"
"wide line, can't lay a bat on it"
"on the toes, clipped to leg"
"attempted drive, inside-edged into the front leg, and Root wheels away in either disgust or pain. I think the latter. Probably clipped the back of his unguarded leg"
"jeepers, that was close! Good lift outside off, under-edged into the crease and hops over the stumps!"
"lovely line, leaping off the pitch and curling past a pokey edge. Well bowled"
"punching off the back foot. The scorecard has been alerted now, so Stokes' score rolls back to 49"

"big stride, pushed to cover"
firmly punched down the ground but mid-off is there to gather
"crunched into the off side, but straight to short cover"
tickled into the gap
"forward and pushed into the leg side, good sharp running to make two out of nothing. Root wears the shy on his thigh as the ball comes in, and milks the moment superbly, taking just enough time out of the game to prevent another over."
"round the wicket, back of a length, 89mph, played to the off side"
"straighter line, pushed off the back foot towards mid-on"
"defends a length delivery to the off side...and it appears Rabada has a warning for his follow through. Yep, it's an official one from Paul Reiffel"
"a little wider, full length, blocked to the off-side ring"
"that's a super shot, a back of a length delivery, Stokes punches it square through the off side wide of a diving Bavuma at point"

"round the wicket, driven to the off side"
"uses his feet, defends when not quite to the pitch"
"stretches forward, this takes an inside edge to the leg side"
"plays back to quite a full ball, he's right on his stumps, defended"
"outside off, a touch shorter, he rocks back and drives square...Bavuma makes a tumbling save and there's some misunderstanding over the chance of a single"
"that's a deft piece of batting, the ball is pushed onto the pads and Root paddle-sweeps it very fine"
"short of a length, defended on the back foot"
forces a full ball into the leg side
"well, there's the breakthrough! It's a bouncer from Rabada, around off stump, Stokes eager to play the hook and gets a thin top edge to de Kock. It looked like a tactic to so short for a spell at Stokes, it's worked quickly. He's pretty livid with himself"
"over the wicket, full at the stumps, defended"
"round the wicket, on off stump, behind the line"
"pushed into the off side, they think of a quick single but decline it"
"comes forward, drives to mid-off"
flicked to mid-on

drags this down a little short and Root picks the gap by rocking back and driving square
"fuller, this time he whips with strong wrists just to the right of mid-on"
"widish line outside off, he leans forward and blocks"
"full outside off, on the front foot, pressing forward, takes a thickish edge along the ground and beats gully"
"and again, I'll repeat that thanks very much...even more deftness this time, wasn't quite so full, he open the face at the last moment and steered it wide of second slip"
"shorter still, this time he plays back and dabs into the point area"
"round the wicket, a bouncer, he ducks"
"full and straight, pushed to mid-on"

the wrists come into play as he whips from off stump to midwicket
"comes forward, takes a thick inside edge to the leg side"
"a short ball over off stump, he drops his hands out of the line, and he's still scoreless after 12 balls"
"there it is! A full ball outside leg, he plays a dab sweep towards fine leg and takes in the standing ovation. What a day for the new captain"

"shorter, defended to the off side"
pushed back to the bowler
defended
and he's off the mark with a strong sweep to deep square leg
clipped strongly off the pads to long leg
"short of a length outside off, pushed to the covers"
"fuller, driven to mid-on who makes a tumbling save"
"not entirely in control, but it's safe in the end...a bit of a flappy pull shot to a short ball, takes the top edge but well wide of long leg"
"that's a flowing drive, full and wide, Moeen reached for it a little, and not quite out of the middle, but whistled to the cover rope"
"and a repeat, wide again outside off, and this one is struck even sweeter as Moeen sends it rifling through the covers"
"uses his feet and pumps this over long-off, a couple of steps down the pitch to the meet the ball and a lovely lofted drive"
and now he eases it down the ground to long-off
eased down to long-on
defended to the off side
uses his feet again and clips into the leg side
"brings out the sweep again, gets it wide of short fine leg, Rabada gives chase and tries to dive and flick it back but isn't successful after a long sprint"
"angled across outside off, left alone"
through to the keeper
on a good length
worked off the pads to deep square
"now he uses his feet to the seamer, just a little shuffle, worked to the leg side"
"short of a length at off stump, played to the off side, and another no-ball"
"a hint of late swing, but Root can open the face and play to point"

"leans forward outside, takes a thick inside edge to the leg side"
pushed to mid-on after using his feet
uses his feet and this times go through with a powerful lofted drive over long-on
spins from the footmarks but wide enough to leave
"this grips as well, Moeen gets a long way forward and works the ball behind square on the leg side"
"saved by an inside edge! Round the wicket, scoots through and takes the pad but there was a graze of the bat on the way"
"full outside off, that's a good-looking drive as he comes forward, a diving mid-off gets a hand on it then recovers to keep them to two"
"short of a length, neatly flicked through midwicket"
this tails into Root a touch - hint of reverse? - and is flicked off the pads to deep square
"on off stump, 80mph, defended"
comes forward and drives on the up to the covers
uses his feet and clips to mid-on
driven to the sweeper
defended on the front foot
"nurdled, or noodled, from outside off into the square-leg area"
"was there an edge there? He went for a sweep to a full ball outside off, yes it's given as runs, the top edge into de Kock's helmet and wide of slip who was moving towards the leg side for the sweep"
pushed into the off side
driven to mid-off

"round the wicket, full at off stump, played to mid-on"
"short outside off, lets it go through"
"full outside off, left alone"
pushes into the off side

"that's a lovely piece of timing, back of a length and he flicks it in front of square...effortless"
"full outside off, left alone"
whippage! Takes this from outside off and flicks it wide of mid-on...this is quite a show from Root
"tries it again, the line was even wider outside off, but this time finds square leg"
"back of a length, punched square to backward point"
worked off the stumps through midwicket
beaten on the inside edge by one that keeps a little low from back of a length

"73mph, flicked off the pads to deep square leg"
"short of a length, defended on the walk"
"comes forward, opens the face into the point region and it ends up being a comfortable two"
"short outside off, cracked to cover"
"that's pretty rubbish, it's a loopy full toss which Root bunts wide of mid-on with a straight bat"
dabbed down to third man and there's another fumble in the field...Philander this time
"forward, and pushed down the ground"
"swept, fine. Picks the gap"
"another sweep, and the unmistakeable clunk of top-edge into helmet. Off the arm, I think. Moeen's okay"
finds the gap behind square to rotate the strike
"swept, and very powerfully. Fetched from outside off, and spanked along the ground through square leg"
"fully forward, pushed into the off side"
"onto the front foot, tidy line and length"
"outside off, a hint of away swing, a touch of Mark Butcher at Edgbaston in 2001 about that late hoop!"
"outside off, this one goes the other way to the left-handed Moeen. All the tricks!"
forward and blocked down the track
"full length, dug out"
"a swing and a miss! Nearly, nearly.... big outswing to the left-hander"
"another aggressive sweep, hauling the ball from outside off,  clean as a whistle through midwicket"
punched into the off side
"looped up outside Moeen's off stump, clumped to mid-on"

"more aggressive advances down the wicket. Root is feeling like having a go now, but doesn't beat the field with his drive"
"outside off, chopped into the cordon"
"blocked on the front foot, the ball nearly wriggles into the stumps"
"on the pads, attempted nurdle through fine leg, but de Kock drops a gloved hand on the ball to intercept"

"shorter, and pumped into the off side"
"on the pads, clipped to the leg side"
"onto the front foot, pushed firmly to mid-off"
"lured down the track, beaten by sharp turn, and Root is so far out of his crease, he just keeps walking! But no way, it's a <B>no ball!</B> That is shambolic from a spinner"
"up on the toes, pushed to cover, and the severely jammy Root grins like a loon as he acknowledges an otherwise superb 150!"

solidly into line
"on the pads, tucked square"
clipped up to mid-on
"turning down the leg side, can't quite angle it fine"
"onto the front foot, punched to cover"
dragged violently out to deep midwicket. Mo is mowing at everything now
"driven, in the air... but wide of short cover! A little chancy, but we'll forgive him that now"
"met on the half-volley, and spanked back to the bowler"
"on the pads, clipped to leg"
worked behind square with a good old-fashioned nurdle
tucked into the gap once more
"off the legs once more and Moeen Ali brings up his fifty! Few batsmen can call being picked at No.7 a promotion, especially when they scored two hundreds in the top five on the previous tour, but Moeen has cashed in here so far."
pushed to cover
"bouncer. Good surprise delivery, but Moeen ducks"
"up on the toes, a loosener from Rabada, and Root lambasts that to the cover rope"
"outside off, slightly fuller length with a bit of movement and bounce. A flinch outside off from Root"
"short again and slammed to point, but well intercepted"
"defended on the back foot, and gathered at backward square"
"up on the toes, driven to cover"
"width, smashed. Root flings the dishwasher at this one. In the air but fizzes through point. The hardness of the new ball adding to South Africa's woes"
"slower ball, yorker length. Dug out"
into line to defend
"well bowled, this one jags off the seam and beats a probing push"
on the pads and tucked through leg. Well timed once again
"back of a length, jagging away, tapped to cover off the back foot"
squared up on a leg-stump line. Defended
"smashed! Not a lot you can do when Root is in this sort of a mood. Not a bad line or length, but met on the up by a dismissive slap through the covers. Timed the pants off it"
"outside off, extra oomph as this one leaps off the deck and beats the edge  by a distance"
"short, and shovel-pulled through square leg. He's enjoying himself now! Absolutely nailed off the middle of the bat, without a care in the world"
pushed onto the back foot and they steal the single to cover
the first leg-bye of the innings! Scenes!
defended on the back foot
defended back to the bowler
solidly into line
"outside off, no stroke this time"
"beautiful straight drive to mid-off, and up comes the 150"
squared up on off stump. Pushed back to the bowler
"a strangled appeal as Root flicks across the line, but a slender inside-edge saves Root from a plumb lbw"
"bouncer, no stroke offered"
"through to the keeper, tight line"
slashed fiercely through backward point! The cordon can but stand and watch!
"defended on the back foot, right under the eyeline"
"into line, and pushed down the ground"
"on the pads, deflected through backward square and de Kock gives chase"
"through to the keeper, a bit of outswing"
"a compact drive, no great power but beats the diving mid-off, who gets a palm on it to slow its progress"
"that is flog-tastic! Outside off, on the up, battered through the covers with a followthrough that I haven't seen since <a href=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/63665.html target=new>Darrren Gough at Sydney in 1994-95</A>"
patted out to point
"chipped in the air, but wide of Philander in his followthrough. Look to bring the bottom hand through a biff down the ground but the ball got big on him"
"on the toes, clipped square. Philander kicked the stumps as he went through"
angled defence
down the leg side
"short, pulled with control in front of square. The sweeper gathers. That was nailed as well"
bouncer. Moeen ducks
on the pads and tucked through square leg
"drilled back to the bowler, gathered at the toes as Rabada stoops"
"up on the toes, jabbed down to third man"
"into line, and defended back down the pitch"
"on the toes, a nice leg-side sighter to clip his first run of the day"
blocked into the off side
onto the front foot and drilled into the covers
"round the wicket, defended back down the pitch"
"lovely strike! Big stride, met with a full face, on the up, and larrupped through the covers. He is jolly elegant when the ball is in his slot..."
shuffles into line to defend on the back foot
"cautiously forward, a probing drive into the covers"
"fillets the gap in the covers, a back-foot punch, piercing the gap and racing away down the slope. A valiant chase but the ball gathers pace as it reaches the rope"
"driven, but off an inside-edge to short midwicket"
"solidly forward, blocked into the off side"
edged ... but short of second slip. Soft hands saving Moeen there
"edged and gone! A thin tickle and Root's epic is over ...  a fine delivery in the channel outside off, climbing off the pitch and nibbling up the hill to graze through to the keeper."
firmly into line
"nipping down the hill, slaps the pad and up goes the finger! Dawson <B>reviews</b> immediately, and that certainly did a lot off the pitch. Bounce and sliding towards leg, but will it be clipping the stumps? Indeed it is! The top of leg bail would have been obliterated, so Dawson's home debut innings is over!"
"wide of off stump, left alone"
beats the left-hander's edge with a good'un
short and leg-sided. Broad flinches but the ball flies clear of his shoulders
through to the keeper
solidly onto the front foot and pushed back down the track
"driven, edged, but doesn't carry to second slip. A firm-handed drive but the ball kept low, luckily for him"
"on the back foot, tapped to the leg side"
"edged, and perfectly placed, low past the keeper! Can't set a field for that"
"a huge appeal, nibbling back into the left-hander's pads, curling into the stumps. And wow, that would have been out if they had reviewed it! Hitting leg stump sufficiently flush to overturn the original decision. Whoops"
through to the keeper
"tight line, lifting off the pitch, left alone"
"on the pads, tucked off the hip to backward square"
"a squirty drive, clean to the rope. Nicely placed"
no stroke this time
"driven, loosely, in the air, and through third man. Broad staying very leg-sided and in no position to control the shot, but on this occasion it doesn't matter"
"on the pads, nipping off the pitch and taking the thigh pad"
"onto the front foot, poked into the off side"
"panned! High and handsome over midwicket. Moeen loitering on the back foot, ready to pounce as Philander errs in length"
"on the pads, whipped through backward square to reach 2000 Test runs. Lovely flowing accumulation now"
worked to the leg side
clipped off the pads
"onto the front foot, driven to short cover"
"forward, blocked into the off side"

"probing onto the front foot, pushed into the off side"
"outside off, deflected into the gully"
forward to defend
solidly into line
"probing line outside off, pushed to cover"
"cracked off the back foot, but straight to cover"
"good delivery, short of a length, angling into the body from round the wicket, Broad sways inside the line"
"retreating to leg again, but well enough defended off the back foot"
"short and sharp, attacking the ribs, and just about fenced away. Broad gets in a tangle but survives"
"another sharp short ball, Moeen attempts a pull but top-edges into his grille and away to safety"
"hauled into the leg-side, well connected this time"
"pushing onto the back foot, clipped into the leg side"
"on a good length, nibbling away from the left-hander, and defended"
"blimey, Broad is making the most of the edge of his bat today! Another half-cocked probe outside off, a huge gap between bat and pad, and a fat inside-edge eludes his off stump and de Kock's despairing dive!"
pushed into the off side
"hoisted up and over the leg side, and another less than convincing boundary for Broad! A wafty swat off the eyebrows that trickles over the rope. Backward square simply lost sight of the balll. Rabada raises his palms in disgust, as well he might"
"fuller length, defended on the line of leg stump"
short and sharp. Broad ducks
"forward, uneasily, prodded to leg"
"back of a length, fenced into the off side with a hop"
"on the back foot, pushed into the off side"
"outside off, left alone"
"outside off, Broad limbos inside the line"
defended once again
"a hard-handed poke into the off side, firmly rooted in the crease"
"outside off, and slashed to point. Well gathered"
"on the pads, tucked to leg"
"strikes the pad, leg-sided line all the way"
"short and sharp, Broad does not like it up 'im! Didn't get up much, but that made his bail-out all the more awkward"
"fuller length, good follow-up. Broad pushes with hard hands, but gets away with it as the ball ghosts past his edge"
"driven cautiously, on the front foot"
"sizing up the drive, but eased back down the pitch"
"round the wicket, clocked hard to cover, but well intercepted"
"on the pads, clipped behind square"
"outside off, Broad drops his hands as the ball climbs by"
short and leg-sided.
"a short ball, rolls the wrists nicely and pulls behind square, and in fact this almost beats Morkel running round from long leg but he manages to cut it off with a full-length dive"
shoved down the leg side
"good length at off stump, good use of the wrists to work this through midwicket"
"cleaned in him up! Gets this one fuller, still, and Moeen misses his drive. Actually a decent but, came back at the left hander and scooted past the inside edge as Moeen left a large gap between bat and pad"
"short of a length at off stump, defended to the covers"
"and another! Wood almost walked for that. Back of a length again, doesn't really get up as it may have done, nips back off the seam and slams into Wood's back pad"
"that's a lovely shot, gets over the top of a short-of-a-length delivery and drives it square off the back foot through the covers"
"has a heave across the line of a shortish delivery, and nearly drags as the bottom edge cannons into his boot and almost into the stumps"
he's has no plans to block it...gives himself room outside leg stump and swings at fresh air against a short delivery
"the full one, well bowled, skims past the outside edge as Broad is late on bringing the bat down...not far from off stump"
"beats him again, not quite so full this time, Broad stuck around leg stump and the ball scuttles past off stump"
"he's nailed this one! Morkel goes short again, Broad stands a litter stiller as he plays the shot, clubs a pull shot well in front of square"
"round the wicket, full and straight, driven hard into the pitch and Rabada misfields in his follow through so Anderson off strike"
"full outside off, he drives with an open face through backward point and they are alert to the chance of a second"
"that's clonked over the leg side, heaves through the leg side against a short ball, deep square able to cut it off"
"a slower ball, short, Broad just manages to wait on the shot long enough to flap it into the leg side"
"a bouncer, well over Anderson's head...Reiffel interested in Rabada's followthrough again"
"full, angled into leg stump, clips the pad and de Kock makes a good stop"
"slices this down to third man where it drops just short of the fielder, was a little cramped for room as be played the upper cut"
"full at off stump, worked with a closed face through square leg"
"moves way outside leg stump, Morkel follows him and Broad just about bails out of the shot"
"goes for the yorker, it's on target, but Broad does well to squeeze it out through the covers and gets two for his efforts"
"that's huge! Into the crowd. He's taking on the short ball, this time the pull takes a healthy chunk of top edge and flies way over deep square leg"
"and we'll have a repeat of that! That's his half century. He hooks high and handsome over deep backward square, his first Test fifty since Trent Bridge v Australia in 2013 - 66 innings ago"
"full outside off, he drives and misses"
more frustration for South Africa as Anderson pushes forward to a full delivery and it slides off the outside edge wide of the slips
now it's Jimmy's turn...the Burnley Lara! He's come down the pitch - at Kagiso Rabada - and swung him over deep midwicket into the crowd
"goes full and straight, dug out to mid-on"
"another bouncer, this time he ducks"
and another short one which sails harmlessly over his head
"slammed through the off side, he moves to leg stump and drives with a free swing of the harms through the covers"
"parried by slip! Amla did very well to even get a hand on that. A thick edge as Broad swung for the hills again, a great leap from Amla but the rebound didn't fall in his favour"
"and that's that...finally all over. Anderson drives and edges against a wide delivery, de Kock snaffles it to his left"
"starts at off stump, defended towards point"
"short of a length, played to the leg side"
"a short ball, climbs past the outside edge, Bairstow takes it in front of his face"
"short of a length, steered wide of backward point with an open face, in good control of that"
"fuller, good delivery, hint of late swing, Elgar comes forward and takes his bottom hand off the bat as he defends"
"full at the stumps, 82mph, he's forward again and defending...a solid first over from Anderson"
"and he's away first ball, punches a back of a length delivery through the covers"
"round the wicket, full at off stump, defended...82mph"
"pulls the length back, 84mph, worked into the leg side"
"gone with a hit! Elgar worked into the leg side, towards mid-on, he had to run around Broad, Dawson picked up from mid-on and could have had him with a hit. Had a decent angle to aim at the stumps, too"
"full outside off, left alone"
"fuller, outside off, 85mph and left alone"
"full at off stump, late shape away from the left hander, defending on the front foot"
"not so full this time, Elgar moves across the crease and defends to the on side"
"a strangled appeal! This skims past the outside edge, more late movement to beat the left hander, there's a noise but it's bat clipping pad"
"that's a neat punchy drive through the covers, a little too full and wide from Anderson"
"drags the length back, straighter as well, pushes into the off side to rotate the strike"
"gets forward into a full ball outside off, drives to backward point"
"past the edge from round the wicket, was too wide, really, for Elgar to be playing at but the angled made him feel for it"
tucks this from off stump into midwicket
"angled in at off stump, defended to the off side"
"full outside off, 84mph, doesn't lure Kuhn into have a drive, through to the keeper"
"good delivery, full at off stump, 86mph, Kuhn gets forward and plays to the off side"
"touch shorter, outside off, left alone"
"outside off, swinging away. No stroke offered"
"edged but short of first slip! A regulation nick, high on the splice, but just doesn't have the legs"
"outside off, left alone with an urgent haul of the gloves, presenting his shoulder to the bowler by way of compensation"
stabbed to cover
left alone outside off
"smacks the pads as Elgar is squared up on leg stump. Half an enquiry from Anderson, but nothing more"
"outside off, no threat of a shot"
"nips off the seam, strikes the thigh pad as it jags back into the batsman"
this one takes off towards the cordon after hitting the seam! A smart one-handed take behind the stumps by Bairstow
"outside off, through to the keeper"
"through to the keeper once more, Broad bashing out a good length outside off"
"make it 836! That's Broad at his best ... the angle in, the nip away, the unavoidable snick of splice as the batsman fails to get properly forward to smother the bounce, and a neat low catch from Cook at first slip. Kuhn is gahn"
"outside off, stabbed into the off side"
defended into the leg side
"on the legs, clipped away with an urgent flick of the bat"
"forward and defended back down the pitch, squared up by the tight line to off stump"
"big stride down the pitch, pleasingly full-faced defence"
back and across to block once more
"outside off, left alone. Too wide to lure a stroke"
"stretching forward, cautiously poked back down the pitch"
"leg-sided, hits the pad but never a danger of lbw"
blocked into the off side
"playing from deep in the<em> kolfkampie</em>, like a South African Gary Ballance (insert own joke here...) Pushed to cover"
sliding down leg
"outside off, a good confident leave"
"pushed onto the back foot, snaffles the single to short midwicket"
"open-faced defence out to gully, playing the ball down into the crease with a crouching stance"
"swinging across the left-hander's bows, but a well-judged single into the covers"
"blotted out to point, that's a probing length, with Amla neither forward nor back"
"on the pads, a big inswinger but misdirected. Deep square intercepts on the boundary's edge"
"wider on the crease, spearing the ball in towards the base of the stumps. Amla squares up in defence"
"up on the toes, defended back down the pitch"
defended on the back foot once more. Good lift off the deck
forward and blocked into the off side
pushed into the off side
no way through there ... Defended into the off side
"outside off, too wide to lure a stroke"
"much tighter to the stumps, and uncomfortably squeezed into the leg side"
squared up on the line of middle and off. Placed to mid-on
"up on the toes in defence, patted into the off side"
tight defence on off stump. Jabbed to leg
"stabbed into the gap, Wood generating some decent steam already in his spell"
"round the wicket, and that's very well played and placed. A full-faced push, straight back down the line of the ball, and Broad nearly wears it on his ankles as it rushes away to the rope"
"tight defence under the eyeline, picked up in the covers"
"wide outside off, no stroke offered"
"outside off, left alone"
"on the pads, misdirected, but backward square tidies up"

solidly forward and blocked
"banged in short, attacking the gloves. Well played in the end"
pushed into the off side
fenced back down the pitch
"well batted, over-pitched a touch from Wood, and Elgar's compact technique is perfect for putting those away. Head over the ball, bat pushing through the line"
"looped up, met with a dismissive clip through midwicket. Welcome to the big time"
"big turn from outside off! That was sharp spin, and disturbed the footmarks too. Juicy..."
more appreciable spin... this is very interesting already. And Root reacts immediately with an extra close catcher on the off side

pushed to the off side
"pushed into the covers, good sharp calling"
worked to the leg side
into line to defend
banged into the hip and tucked behind square

into line to defend once more

"fuller, pushed across outside off, left alone"
"round the wicket, back of a length on off stump, defended to the leg side"
"pushed up fuller at off stump, 89.7mph, played towards mid-off"
"a touch too straight, as he has been to Amla, worked through the leg side"
"ooh, that's not too far away...it's full, skids on and takes Amla on the pad as he plays back but sliding down leg (and it's given a run, so he nicked it)"
prodded into the off side
"that's a terrific shot, uses his feet and then lofts well over mid-off...good way to switch the pressure back to the bowler"

"fuller, pushed back to the bowler"
pushed gently towards short cover
"short of a length, a beautiful piece of timing as it flicks it through square leg"

"gets wider outside off, and a little fuller, defended"
"on off stump, defended, and he's overstepped"
"full outside off, left alone"
"hangs it wider outside off, through to the keeper"

"keeps it full, Elgar leans forward and blocks"
clipped down the ground to long-on

"pulls the length back, left alone"
pushed to mid-on
"got him! Huge moment. This spins quite sharply from outside off, Amla playing back and that looks stone dead. The battle of the beards goes Moeen's way"

"uses his feet, think Moeen saw him coming, dragged the length back so JP couldn't get to the pitch"

"tests out the middle of the pitch with a shorter one, Elgar rides it comfortable and nudges towards square leg"
"fuller at off stump, defended to mid-on"
"that's close, but the lbw is sort of aborted - was it an inside edge? Full, angled in from round the wicket, Duminy playing across the line. Probably sliding on the angle, but a hint of reverse"

"round the wicket, outside off, left alone"
"tucked off the toes, out to midwicket"
"tight to off stump, angling into the left-hander, dabbed to gully"
angled defence down into the cordon. Good hands and a low stance prevented that from carrying to second slip
up on the toes to drive into the covers
"full length, attacking the off stump, blocked into the covers"
"on the pads, clipped square"
"outside off, pushed uneasily, off the inside edge, onto the pad, into the chest at short leg and Moeen Ali has 100 Test wickets! The second fastest Englishman to the 100 wickets-2000 runs mark after Tony Greig, no less!"
"tossed out wide, and Bavuma climbs into a monstrously ambitious drive. Under-edged into his crease. Careful now!"
"more cautiously onto the front foot, defended to leg"
off the mark in less-than-convincing fashion - an inside-edge through square leg
"down on one knee to sweep. Connects well, but that is a creakily old-school piece of fielding from Mark Wood on the backward square boundary, bending down to gather and missing it entirely. Stick a boot on it, son!"
"outside off, no stroke offered"
through to the keeper
"angled into the off stump, stabbed out to cover"
leaning forward to defend into the off side
"outside off, through to the keeper"

forward and poked back to the bowler
forward and drilled to short cover
"stabs the single, keeps the strike"
"pushed into the covers, good probing line"
"jagging off the seam back into the left-hander, smashes the back pad, and Broad is galloping off on his patented celebrappeal before belatedly turning to point a finger at the umpire. No point in reviewing that!"
"tight line to the new man, defended on the back foot with body right behind the line"
"probing. Stabbed defence from a full length, deflects into the leg side"
"on the back foot, tucked to leg to get de Bruyn off the mark"

straight-bladed defence
"wide on the crease, another maiden notched up as Bavuma joins the dots"
"sharp turn from outside off, De Bruyn goes back to defend and the ball rolls up his pads"

more inviting turn as de Bruyn slides back to defend
"back and across, fenced into the off side"
"onto the front foot, blocked down the track"
this one goes straight on as de Bruyn defends on the back foot
"on the pads, clipped through backward square"

"on the back foot, punched to cover"
"into line, and pushed back to the bowler"
smacked hard and over the top of cover. Good connection
"giving himself room, trying to fence through the off side"

"sturdy in defence, rooted to the crease"
pushed off the back foot into the off side
"a touch of outswing from a full length, watched carefully onto the middle of the bat and gathered at silly mid-on."

"a touch wider, dabbed to gully"
"pushed into the covers, Anderson ends up on his knees as he trips in the footholes. He's okay"
"defended on the back foot, into the off side"
eagerly onto the front foot. Blocked to the off side
forward and gathered in the covers
"on the back foot, pushed into the off side"
"solid in defence, but the lack of impetus is telling"
"blocked once again, as South Africa settle for survival"
"on the pads, tucked square for a welcome brace"
"too leg-sided again from Anderson, trying to shape the ball back up the slope but it just kept tailing into the pads. Ten out of ten for effort from Wood, diving full-length into the rope"
"squared up, defended"
sturdy defence
"full length once again, angled bat to deflect the ball down into the crease"
"wider of off stump, climbing off the seam, dabbed to gully"
defended
"well hello. Bavuma is bored of circumspection, so he gallops out of his crease, presents a violent full face and batters a four over the bowler's head. Good calculated risk"
leaning onto the front foot once more
"clipped to leg, in front of square, and he's timed that to perfection. A sudden volley of runs to lift South Africa's spirits"
"rocking back on the pull, more power, less finesse. And it's scuffed to midwicket"
"well bowled, sharper spin and beats the edge of an expansive drive"
"leg-stump line, a bit of a long-hop, and duly dispatched through square leg from deep in the <I>kolfkampie</i>"
forward and blocked
"tight line, defended once again"
"big stride, delicate dab through backward square. Nice shot selection, always in control, and South Africa are enjoying a mini resurgence here"

dabbed through backward square. Good milking of the spinner

round the wicket and driven into the off side
"on the back foot, pushed to the on side"

"that's a lovely stroke, he's driven well, and this is another as he eases forward and places it wide of cover"

"and now de Bruyn drives as well, reaches out a long way to reach this, another one for the sweeper"
"back of a length, at off stump, defended"
"tapped square into the off side, for a moment brief confusion over a run"
"just wide of gully! Short outside off, Bavuma tries to get over the top of it, but the cut flies just high of Anderson"
"full, outside off, left alone"
"and there's a <b>review</B> first ball for lbw! Full, straight and he's a long way across the stumps. Looks close. Hmm, sliding with some late swing perhaps. Wood ended up in a heap in his follow through so probably couldn't see! Umpire's call on hitting leg stump. Very close! Was hitting a good chunk of leg stump"
punched to cover off the back foot

"fuller, again Bavuma gets right across his crease, defends to cover"

"full at off stump, met with a straight bat and Anderson flings out his right hand to cut it off"

"wide outside off, left alone"
tapped into the leg side
driven into the off side
"plays back on off stump, brings the bat down quickly"
"well, that's a bit of a shambles! A gentle flick into the leg side, bit of a surprise he takes the run, really, then Broad hurls the return miles wide of the stumps for four overthrows...he have loved that off his own bowling!"

"oof again! A well-judged leave, or a lucky misjudgement? Either way, the ball bends over the off stump by a whisker"
"half-forward, pushing the ball back to the bowler from an indeterminate length. A bit of swing for Stokes this morning"
"hastily blocked on the back foot, and into the gully"

better carry on a wider line. No stroke this time
"shape back into the right-hander, pushed to mid-on"
"outside off, dabbed to cover"
fully forward to block
punched into the off side
"round the wicket, room to free the arms, but doesn't time an ambitious slap into the covers. Kept low off the pitch too"
"width again, Rabada lets this one go"
"well bowled again, that's pinned Rabada as he attempted to sway inside the line of the short ball. But the round-the-wicket angle kept it following him as he wore it on the shoulder and grille"

"wide on the crease, a dangly defensive push to cover"
lifting into a back-foot push to cover

"a languid pull through the leg side, off the front foot. Picked up by the sweeper but that oozed with class"

"on the back foot, defended once again"
"loose. A full toss outside off, and pumped through point. Well batted"
"sharp bounce and takes the glove, but there's no-one behind square on the leg side! Forward short leg dives valiantly but can't make the ground"
"tight line, lots of oohs as Rabada defends on the back foot"
"an ambitious wallop, refusing to die wondering as Moeen half-fields in his followthrough"
"onto the front foot, confidently blocked"

"round the wicket, blocked to the leg side"

a crashing drive into the covers. He's feeling in the mood now
"over the wicket, twirled onto a good left-hander's length outside off"
"there's the nick, and that's been coming! Rabada played back, but it just held its line down the slope, took the edge, and Bairstow gathered well. Rabada's feisty knock ends. He hadn't looked as comfortable against the turning ball, and Dawson needs just two balls to make his mark today"
defended into the off side
crashed out towards the point boundary
forward and clipped off the pads to midwicket
"punched into the covers, urgent running"
"on the back foot, attempted flick to leg"
stretching forward to block

"onto the front foot, and pushed to the off side"

"on the back foot, pushed back to the bowler"

"well bowled again! Jagging past the edge, from just back of a length"
stabbed out to cover
"round the wicket, short of a length outside off and de Kock has a swing across the line, the ball dies under the bottom edge, bounces in front of Bairstow"
"trying to force this off the back foot, takes a fat inside edge into his pads"
that's a good one! Lovely bowling. This is fuller and shapes away from de Kock as he lunges onto the front foot
straighter and a lovely response from de Kock who whips it from around middle stump through midwicket
"back outside off, but too much width and it's square driven through point...the expected counter-punch from de Kock"
"that's even better, a more elegant front-foot square drive this time, splits the gap between backward point and square cover. Super batting"
"this curls past the outside edge and, again, doesn't reach Bairstow on the full"
"now this one jabs back from short-of-a-length and hammers into Philander's top edge, causes some pain. He drops the bat and takes off his glove"

"short of a length, gets inside the line and knocks it comfortably into midwicket"
"pushed down the leg side, Bairstow tumbles to his left and doesn't glove it but manages to cut off the ball"
"extra bounce, again, from short of a length and it zooms in on Philander's gloves"

"back over the wicket and drilled down the ground, a thumping drive straight of mid-off"

"short outside off, he goes for the pull and plays over the top of it"
"back of a length at off stump, 81mph, defended"
"fuller, blocked on the front foot"
"this nips back off a good length, takes an inside edge into the top of his pads"

"round the wicket, full at the stumps, turned to short leg"
uses his feet and lofts this high over midwicket with a lovely swing of the arms...this could be fun
"shorter, flatter outside off, a rather half-hearted poke at it from de Kock and nearly edges to Bairstow"

defended on the front foot
"and he's down the pitch again, what a lovely way to reach a 36-ball fifty, another effortless clip over midwicket"
"full at off stump, 83mph, defended"
"angled into the pads, deflects behind square"
"what a catch! It's that man Ben Stokes at square cover. Full outside off, he comes forward to drive, it flies square of the wicket, skimming just above the turf, and Stokes springs to his right to hold a superb, low catch. He'd been stationed at square cover for that shot"

"a length ball shapes in at Maharaj who blocks to the covers, he was keen for a single but firmly sent back by Philander"
this time they take the single as he steers it into a gap at cover
"too short, enough width to have a slash with impunity. Third man can't cut that off"
"tighter line, fuller length, defended on the legs"
"speared down the leg side, guided to short midwicket with a crease-bound poke"
slapped uppishly to midwicket. Too short again

"outside off, pushed to cover"
tucked into the leg side

"line and length, rising on off stump and punched to cover"
"wallop! Wood serves up an 83mph long-hop, and Philander pivots on the back foot and thumps a mighty pull over cow corner. Top boshing"

"down the leg side, flicked behind square"
defended once more
"punched to mid-off, a sharp shy from Root but safely home"
"galloping down the track, strikes the pad, and England are thinking strongly about the <B>review</B> here. Yep, they are going for it. Might as well with eight down and two wickets to claim. Clearly pad first.... and it's hitting!"
pushed to cover
"open-faced slap, and that's very effectively tonked through point"
"short, and pounded over the leg side. Declines the single to farm the strike"
"that's sharper from Wood! A feisty bouncer, swatted off the eyebrows and clearing the stretching Bairstow!"
clipped to leg
"round the wicket, left alone"
strikes the pad once more but sliding down leg
"on the toes, tucked to midwicket. Morkel comes on strike for four deliveries"
forward and pushed to the off side. Long levers
"thumped through the leg-side, just wide of short midwicket, a big beefy tailender's wind-up."
slides straight on and beats the edge
solidly behind the line. Vern's wise words pay dividends
cuts back in from a good length and takes the inside-edge into the thigh
"full length, keeps low. Blocked off the bottom of the bat, and Philander gives his hand a shake. Still feeling the effects of that earlier blow on the fingers"

"spanked! Handsome high-elbowed cover-drive, picking the wide line early and crashing the hands through the line"
"on the pads, worked to square leg. Declines the single, which is odd"

"pushed back onto the stumps, calmly clipped to leg for the single"
opens the face for an attempted glide
firmly punched to cover

thrusts well forward outside off
"massive turn! Huge shout for lbw. They only have one review left. And they've taken it. This ragged from outside off, spinning back in at Cook who was shaping to cut and struck the back leg.

"gets a long way under this with a slog sweep, goes high in the air over midwicket...it's a good effort from Duminy to try and get back to it but just evades him"
"very wide outside off, spins away further, left alone"
"very close! To both bowled and caught. Was a fraction shorter, but skidded through, Wood went back to cut. Nearly edges to the keeper and nearly loses off stump"
"on the pads, clipped to long leg, he hoped for a second but it's not on...Wood gets (potentially) five balls again"
"slightly wrong line again, deflects off the pad behind square on the leg side. Seems there was a tickle as well"

"shorter outside off, he goes for the cut and gets a bottom edge past the stumps and the keeper to fine leg...useful edge"
"good length, tight to off stump, played back down the pitch"
"fuller at off stump, driven to the covers and can't find a gap"

goes for a big slog sweep and is beaten by a country mile as it spins miles

worked off the pads to deep square...already a handy little stand. Lead is now 300
"short ball, pulled in the air but falls short of deep square-leg"
"a straight full toss, unlike Dawson he's able to bunt it back to Morkel...wasn't as high as the one to nail Dawson"

waits for this to turn and steers it out to deep cover
slices a drive to backward point
"full and the stumps and he drills a drive to mid-off and steals a single, not gathered cleanly by Morkel"

"round the wicket, he has a fiddle outside off and is beaten"
"hanging back in the crease, this scoots past the outside edge again"
"a short ball, a rather loopy bouncer, Anderson has time to drop his hands"
"angled in at off stump, defended to backward point and the shot is greeted by warm cheers from the crowd. A solid No. 11 block, sends them wild"
"goes for a slog sweep, takes an under edge and trickles to fine leg...he doesn't run. Farming time"
"now he reverse sweeps, middles it but finds backward point"
"shorter, he goes back to cut, some extra bounce defeats him...not taken by de Kock"
"misses his slog sweep, and the spin actually saves him from being bowled as this rags past off stump"

angles a wider ball outside off down to third man
a full toss from round the wicket slips down the leg side and de Kock does well to cut it off
"there's an appeal for a stumping...Bairstow misses his slog sweep, and it appears the back foot has dragged out. Yes, he's out. Bairstow has got his foot back and de Kock even had time to have two goes at the stumps"
"straight, hint of swing, defended to the leg side"
"full at off stump, he plays forward and defends to backward point"
"full outside off, shapes away and left alone...decent carry"

"back of a length, 85mph, pushed to the off side"
"he's been given lbw by S Ravi! And has called for the <b>review</b>. I didn't think that looked out at first glance. Round the wicket, beats the inside edge, it's hit him quite high and there's the angle as well. Yes, it's missing leg stump on height"

"and again, similar delivery, perhaps a smidgen wider, Kuhn shuffles across the crease and then leaves"
"full, outside off, 85mph and left alone"
"a touch wider on the crease from Anderson, angled in at off stump, makes him play this time"
"what a grab by Bairstow! That's a beautiful snaffle down the leg side. The worst ball of the over, pushed down the leg side, Kuhn catches up with it, gets a thin tickle and Bairstow dives to his left and takes it low one-handed"
"round the wicket, full at off stump, defended to the off side"
plays with the bat well in front of the pad

"round the wicket, pushed off the back foot to the bowler"
"done it! That's a ripper. Well, he's called the <B>review</b>. This pitched on the stumps and straightened beautifully to beat the outside edge as Amla played back. This looks very out. He's quite a long way back, ball doesn't have far to travel. Smashing off stump! What a lovely piece of bowling from Dawson, and a terrific call from Root to bring him on"
