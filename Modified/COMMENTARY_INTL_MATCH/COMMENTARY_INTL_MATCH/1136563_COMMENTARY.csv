what a terrible start from Vinay Kumar. And what a delightful start for Mccullum for his new franchise. On the pads and McCullum tickles this easily behind square for four.
"better from Vinay Kumar. Full and on a length, defended back"
"nice length on a new pitch. 136 kph, full outside off. McCullum stands in his crease and defends to cover."
"that's cleared fine leg! A short delivery on middle and leg, McCullum pulls but gets a thick top edge which flies over fine leg. <strong>McCullum has 9000 T20 runs too</strong>"
"there comes the charge. Back of a length on middle and leg, a big swing and miss. Extra bounce"
that's tripe from Vinay Kumar. He goes on the pads and McCullum says thanks with a neat flick through backward square leg. Too easy. 14 off 6 for Baz.
"and then he bowls full and wide outside off, de Kock is welcomed to his new franchise with an overpitched delivery outside off. And de Kock drills a drive through cover to open his RCB account."
"the googly! <strong>De Kock does not pick that!</strong> The googly outside off, de Kock plays for some legspin but the ball keeps drifting on and beats the bat"
"a fine paddle sweep, slow outside off, a fine tap to short fine leg."
"taken at short third man! Another indicator that de Kock did not read Piyush Chawla. A legbreak on middle and off, de Kock looks for a reverse sweep, takes a thick leading edge and lobs to short third man. Legspin comes with extra revolutions and very very often top edges too."
"an overpitched delivery on off, worked away to deep midwicket for two. Can't undo Kohli with wristspin easily."
"the googly, reads it yesterday. On middle, worked to deep midwicket"
"a flat delivery on leg, worked away to deep midwicket for one"
"drops it short down leg, worked away to deep square leg for a single"
"nicely bowled, the line is better, so is the length. It's wider outside off, turning in. But Kohli drives effortlessly to long-on"
"the leading edge, just wide of cover. Lots of flight, the googly. McCullum looks to work the ball into the leg side but the leading edge just evades the diving fielder"
"terrific shot, good stop too! Some flight and Kohli flicks him with the wrists through midwicket. The long-on fielder dives to his right to save some runs"
"on middle and leg, a calm drive to long-on. Seven off the over."
"some flight outside off, driven to cover from the crease"
"overpitched on leg, driven to long-on for a run. Kohli easing himself into this innings, but hardly any dot balls."
"the googly, picks him well. McCullum backs away, reads the googly and defends. Two dots in three balls."
"another dot! Flat outside off, pushed to cover"
"ah, that's too wide. The googly and wide outside off, sliced away through point for four. Picks a slim gap."
"on the pads, worked away down to short fine leg for a run."
"five wides! Down leg and McCullum misses a sweep. Karthik misses his collection too, resulting in five wides."
"picked that! And his area. The googly outside off, McCullum chips the ball over mid-off, and gets four."
"flat outside off, McCullum misses a hard sweep and the ball just misses off stump. But Karthik whips off the bails nice and quickly. But has he got back in time? Yes. That's fine. He's safe."
"another googly on middle and leg, nudged to deep midwicket for one. Clever from McCullum."
"another wrong 'un around middle and leg, driven to mid-off"
"wider outside off, flat too, pushed to mid-off from the crease"
"three dots to end the over, well bowled. Flat on middle and leg, driven back towards the bowler. Kohli happy to play him out too."
"overpitched outside off, McCullum backs away and jams an attempted drive into the ground."
"excellently bowled, fired that in around off, defended back. Five dot balls in a row"
"they'll get one, short and wide, chopped away towards point. The ball beats the fielder running in."
"looking for the late cut but fails to connect. Short and wide outside off, Kohli misses his dab"
"92 kph, flat outside off, pushed with soft hands towards cover for a run"
"comes down, meets the ball before it pitches and cleanly chips the ball over long-on to round off a successful Powerplay for RCB. Calculated risks, and he's still there. Well played"
starts with a swervy away carrom ball that is fiercely struck to point
"flat and straight, a thick inside edge into the ground"
"short around middle and leg, pulled over midwicket for a run. The timing there was horrible."
"overpitched outside off, pushed away to long-off for a run. These two very happy with playing Narine out."
"94 kph, carved away to point for nothing. Lots of dots in the last 10 or so balls."
"the floaty swervy delivery outside off, Kohli yorks himself as he defends."
"back of a length from around the wicket, dabbed away towards backward point."
"just erred a touch in line and that's in McCullum's wheelhouse. Full and wide, McCullum transfers his weight late and drills the drive through cover for four."
"134 kph, back of a length outside off, carved away towards point again."
"he's clobbered that with immense power. Runs down, gets close enough to Johnson's offcutter and then smashes the ball over mid-off. Muscular hit."
"on a length, around off, chopped away towards point. Kohli and McCullum almost collide, other than that, an easy run."
"good change in length, the bouncer and well directed too. Short down leg. Kohli is late on the pull, it just about misses the glove on the way to the keeper."
"full down leg, 87 kph, blocked"
"gone through McCullum! A short offbreak, McCullum picks the length early, goes back and looks to hit that over midwicket but he was too early through the shot. The ball goes on and hits middle and off stump."
"another swervy delivery outside off, AB opens his season with a neat drive to deep cover"
"another dot to Kohli, flat down leg. Kohli misses a flick, struck on the pad."
"short and wide, the carrom ball, cut away to long-off. Think Kohli is just struggling a touch for timing."
"so easy for AB. Short and wide outside off, cut away towards cover who half-stops it. AB wants two but Kohli thinks maybe now now."
"slow on middle and off, worked away to deep midwicket for a run"
"a googly on middle, waits for the ball to come to him before turning the ball fine to short third man"
"some flight on middle again. AB is waiting to read the ball off the pitch, does and pushes to long-on"
"flat around off, pushed to long-on for one more."
"picks the googly and then lets his hands do the rest. A wide googly, a ball that Kuldeep has owned recently. Lofted so easily over cover"
"there is no one better in cricket at the 1-2. If one is full, he expects the next one short. He did that to Rashid Khan, a bowler that has owned T20s recently. He's done that to Kuldeep, knows that Kuldeep will be slow and full. So he runs down and drills a drive right back. What batting. Awesome"
"shortish and wide outside off, chopped to short third man."
"short and turning in, AB misses a flick, struck on the pad"
"backs away, and Narine follows him. The carrom ball, de Villiers stays low and sweeps over backward square leg. This is one of the best T20 bowlers"
"gives himself lots of room. Narine goes the other way, and AB reaches out for it, taps to cover"
"it was his slowest start in T20s (11 off 20), but he breaks his stalling momentum with a lovely chip over cover for four."
"flat on middle and off, nudged into the gap at midwicket for a couple. Sensational running, these two make running two look so easy, the fitness these two have is extremely rare to emulate in cricket."
"<b>under-edged to the keeper? Did it hit the stump?</b> Given out. Back of a length outside off, AB looks to cut the ball down to third man but the ball clips the top of the front pad. That was the big noise. The ball was close to the bat also, but UltraEdge says just pad, not bat. They will have to check for the lbw also. Impact says outside off stump so AB will continue on"
"goes short does Johnson. On middle and leg, and de Villiers nails his pull nicely into the gap towards backward square leg. He picks the areas to score earlier than any other batsmen I've seen"
"Johnson, who? This is tremendous batting. A slower offcutter, AB picks it so early and like he does off the last ball, knows which shot he's going to play, a lofted drive over mid-off with soooo much ease"
"on middle and leg, defended to cover. Finally, a breath"
"a slower offcutter on middle, defended to cover. A very good comeback from Johnson"
"superb delivery from Johnson. AB premeditated the full delivery so he went across, looking to chip the ball over fine leg. But it's a sharp bouncer aimed at the wide tramline, which means it's extremely well directed."
"some flight down leg, flicked away to deep midwicket"
"don't think he read that googly, around off, a thick inside edge to short fine leg."
"looking for another big hit but can't connect, hit away with bad timing to midwicket"
"just over midwicket. That's bottom hand, all over. Comes running down and chips the ball into that area. The timing is so good that it clears Johnson, running around."
"overpitched googly on middle and off, drilled to long-on"
"the googly down leg, nudged to short fine leg."
"goes short first up. Wide outside off, and chopped on to point. Mis-hit first up"
"full just outside off, the drive's not well connected as it's hit to cover"
"yorker on off, but manages to squeeze this away to deep midwicket. Late tail into his toes, but well negated by AB"
"good length just outside off, drags his leg-side slog to cow corner this time. They walk across for the single"
"goes short! Pitches on off and jags away from AB. Tries to pull, but he's nowhere near the ball. Through to Karthik from near his face"
"good length just outside off, AB tries a big leg-side heave but can't connect well. Comes off his bat's toe end, and trickles down to long on. He'll keep strike"
"half-tracker on off, and that's been pulled over deep midwicket! Just goes deep into his crease and launches this onto the leg side"
"<b>skied! And taken at long on.</b> Another short ball on off, but AB wants to send that into the Ganges river. Tried to muscle this over the leg side, but it's been top edged. Johnson calls for the catch early and takes a swirler. The part-timer has broken the partnership"
"<b>yorked!</b> And he's on a hat-trick. It's a full ball on Kohli's toes, and he can't dig it out. He misses the defense and the ball crashes into middle stump. Rana, you beauty! Takes two in two and KKR are right back in it once again"
"swept fine, and it trickles away for a boundary. Full on leg stump, and Mandeep shuffles across to the off side and paddles this to the leg side. Deep backward square loses the chase"
"half-tracker on off stump, flicked off his pads to deep midwicket. Played from the back foot"
"tossed up full outside off, fended back towards the non-striker, and Rana's dive stops the ball. A terrific over for KKR comes to an end"
"good length just outside off, pokes at it and taps it to point. Misfield at point makes the batsman contemplate the run. Eventually chooses to come back, but would've been out if the throw was a direct-hit"
"full ball, and that's been driven past Russell to long on. They walk across for the run"
"yorker on middle stump! Sarfraz does well to dig it back straight. Russell tries to get his fingertips to it, and manages to slow the ball down. They scamper across for the run anyway"
"slower ball just outside off, chopped off the back foot to third man"
short on off but Sarfraz misses the pull. Bunted to midwicket off the bat's toe end
"full on middle and leg, and Mandeep comfortably turns it off his toes to deep backward square. Time-out once again."
"full and wide outside off, carved off the open face to third man"
"full and wide outside off, the ball coming in. Guided to backward point. Lots of dots."
"he's so late on the shot. Back of a length outside off, Sarfraz is not close to the ball as he looks to cut"
"superb fielding from Rinku. A short delivery around middle and leg, pulled away with bad timing towards long-on, who runs to his right and saves two"
"good length around off, defended into the off side for a run."
"again late on the shot. Back of a length on middle, pulled away towards long-on, but on the bounce to the fielder."
"a poor ball, short and down leg, Mandeep helps it along to the fine leg boundary. Errant line, easy put-away"
"the swerve of a carrom ball outside off, chopped to cover"
"a sweep to deep midwicket. A carrom ball, he doesn't even bother reading it, just cross bat."
"fine and four. Another poor delivery, strays down leg, just nudged down to the fine leg boundary. Vital runs these."
"another carrom ball outside off, driven to deep cover for a run"
"big appeal from Dinesh Karthik! Back of a length around middle and leg, Sarfraz looks to reverse-paddle the ball, the ball hits Sarfraz a little high also, on the front thigh. KKR don't review."
"taken at long-on! Sarfraz picks out the fielder. That was a stumbling, stalling innings. Full outside off, Sarfraz mis-times a lofted drive down the throat of long-on. Kohli isn't happy Sarfraz didn't go through with the shot."
"back of a length around off, the ball beats the bat as Woakes looks to defend."
"full and wide outside off, Woakes opens the bat face and carves the ball through point for four. Sensational ball-striking, knew his area, didn't overhit."
"beaten for pace! Back of a length on off, the angle and the pace is too good for Woakes as the ball creeps between bat and pad."
"back of a length outside off again, carved away to deep backward point. Just one. Losing all momentum."
"falls short of fine leg. A short delivery down leg, pulled away with bad timing to short fine leg."
"full on middle and leg, Mandeep clears his front leg and goes boom, way over long-on for six. Shot."
"four more. A low full toss down leg, Mandeep helps himself to four more runs with a neat flick over short fine leg. Can't bowl a full toss at this stage."
"six more! Back of a length around off, Mandeep clears his front leg and pulls easily over midwicket. Right in the slot. That's poor end-overs bowling."
"indeed, yes, a wide yorker outside off. Jammed back to the bowler. Vinay hurls a throw back to Mandeep in utter frustration."
"taken on the deep sweeper cover boundary. Full and wide, Mandeep slices the ball off the outside half to the fielder. Just a little more power and that would have been another six. A very tidy cameo from Mandeep, the impetus is now there."
"a nice slower ball and Russell will take the catch! Two wickets in two balls to finish the over. Woakes is through the shot too early, the ball takes the lower half of the bat and lobs to cover. Russell runs back and takes a good catch."
"Narine starts with a sweep that goes over the bowler's head, immense power. A flat-batted smash."
Narine gets low and sweeps Chahal for six through midwicket with more power. This is spin into Narine's arc. Right in the slot.
"flat outside off, pushed to cover for one. Sensible from Narine, batting like a batsman."
"some flight on middle and leg, pushed to mid-off with the spin"
"the flipper. Lynn does not mistake the flipper for a short delivery, blocked back."
"drifts down leg, worked away to short fine leg for a run."
"just short of the bowler? Did it carry? Full outside off, driven back to the bowler. Woakes dives low in front, the ball goes through."
"full and wide outside off, the ball swinging away. The ball goes past Lynn's hard drive. There won't be many easy catches with this form of batting."
"beaten again. Short and wide outside off, the ball bounces a touch extra too and goes over the bat of Lynn."
"a thick inside edge for four. Full and wide outside off, the ball seams back in. Misses the stumps and misses the fine leg fielder."
"de Villiers takes Lynn! A nice catch. A short, wide delivery outside off. Lynn is too far away from the ball to make adequate contact. All he can do is chip the ball away over cover. But there is enough airtime for AB to run to his left and backwards, his eyes peeled on the ball right through its trajectory and completes the play. Good bowling from Woakes too to bowl that wider"
"a low full toss on middle, pushed to mid-on"
"a low full toss outside off, driven to mid-off"
"looking for the big sweep, flat around off, he improvises a push to long-on"
"the drifter! Full on middle, keeps coming in, takes the inside edge of a big heave, away towards square leg"
"105 kph, flat outside off, swept down to long-on again."
"a low full toss outside off, driven away to mid-off for a run"
"lovely shot. Waits for that flight to dip and not turn. Uthappa then swats the sweep over long-on with sublime timing, it was close to a cross bat but the power and timing was excellent."
"a short and wide delivery outside off, maybe fifth-stump channel so not too wide. Narine is beaten for bounce as he looks to cut."
a slower ball is in Narine's wheelhouse. Narine clears his front leg and heaves the ball away for long-on. Massive timing.
"just over cover and four more. Another very vital Narine cameo. Back of a length on middle, Narine clears his front leg and chips the ball over the fielder"
"Kohli chooses to chase the ball instead of cut the angle off wide a dive, and concedes some runs. Full and wide, not the greatest of timing on that drive, but he finds the gap to Kohli's right at cover. And gets four for a lapse in judgement from Kohli."
"short around off, Narine looks to cut over the infield but can't make contact."
"another offcutter, but he drags it down and it ends up as a half-tracker to swat away like a mischievous fly over midwicket. When it comes to roles for T20 sides, does Narine do it better than everyone else?"
"very full outside off, driven to mid-off"
"104 kph, Narine clears his front leg, gives himself some room and drills a drive to mid-off"
"finds the gap to mid-off's left this time. Flat and quick, drilled away with immense power."
"Narine does the bowler in the mind this time. Backs away, then does not. The ball is down leg. Wide."
"this ain't no pinch-hitter. It's a naught full toss and Narine doesn't cross bat swat it away, or heave. He lofts the ball over mid-off because the fielder is inside the circle. Sensational ball-striking."
"six more! The foot is on the boundary as he takes the catch. Full down leg, did Mandeep misjudge that slightly? There's some flight on leg, lofted away to deep midwicket. Mandeep takes the catch inside the boundary, but his foot, body, even the ball has touched the boundary. But umpire Shamsuddin's (inexplicable, I may add) soft signal is out. His decision is quickly overturned by the third umpire."
"<b>a 17-ball 50 for Narine</b>. The last times these two sides met, Narine had hit a 15-ball fifty. Runs down to the ball and skews a lofted drive to deep midwicket to get there. Two fifties by an opener inside the Powerplay today, in both games."
"beaten for pace. 136 kph, full outside off, Narine is not anywhere near the drive."
"Umesh strikes! A thick inside edge into off stump. A low full toss outside off, Narine is clearly harried for pace. He looks to drive the ball but he is very late on the shot, a thick inside edge hits off stump and RCB have some relief. A job extremely well done from Narine. He is the only player with two fifties off 17 balls or lesser in IPL."
"that's a fine start. Back of a length around off, Rana is hurried for pace, the ball beats his tentative poke."
"good stop from de Kock. 125 kph, a loopy tennis-ball bouncer over the head of Rana."
"struck on the helmet! Is that the second bouncer of the over? No? Off the helmet towards third man, a good stop from the fielder. But that's surely the second delivery over the shoulder of the over? Only one allowed per over in T20s? Rana is not close to his pull by the time the ball pings off the helmet."
"back of a length outside off, plenty of zip and climb as the ball flies past the outside edge"
"good end from both parties. Back of a length outside off, guided down to third man for a single."
"back of a length down leg, off the pad into the off side. There's an optimistic appeal, pitched well outside leg? It pitched in line, but umpire's call on clipping leg."
"goes short, down leg, pulled to fine leg for a run."
"picks the length and goes from bottom to top on his pull, in an attempt to get underneath the ball and hit it for six. He does that excellently well."
"full and wide, a poor ball. Slashed over backward point with fierce power. A brief counter-attack and KKR back in front."
"a short and wide delivery outside off, chopped away towards cover. Kohli gets in front of Chahal exuberantly and concedes an extra run as the ball goes through them both."
"well bowled. A full delivery on off, some shape inside. Driven to long-on"
"back of a length on middle, worked to deep square leg for a run."
"well played. Short outside off, lets the ball come to him before guiding it down to third man. He's allowed that pressure off with some brave shots in the previous over."
"McCullum takes the catch at backward point. It's a bad shot, short and wide, the ball moving away, Uthappa looks to swat the ball over midwicket but it's the wrong shot. A cut would have been a better shot. But he chose the pull and to add to that, he's hurries on the shot. So the ball takes the splice and lobs up."
"back of a length down leg, nudged down to fine leg for a run"
"short outside off, Karthik lets hist first ball as KKR captain go to the keeper."
"back of a length on middle and leg, clipped to deep square leg for one"
"again, the wrong shot, I think. Short and wide outside off, DK sees a big gap at midwicket so he goes back and pulls wide of mid-on. A good stop from Sarfraz, running to his right."
"short of long-on. Back of a length around off, pulled with terrible timing to long-on. Why are there so many shots?"
"short, around off, Karthik misses a pull as he looks to pull, off the thigh pad to third man."
a high full toss but under the waist. 128 kph. Defended to cover for one. Just under the waist.
"good bouncer, good leave. Back of a length around off, Karthik lets that one go through, dropping his hands to let that one go."
"131 kph, another short ball, the second in succession. This is way over the head. Was the previous one the first bouncer of the over? If so, this should have been a no-ball and not a wide. Karthik gets underneath and lets that one go"
"back of a length down leg, nudged towards backward square leg for a couple, very neatly played by Karthik."
"what a shot that is. He knows mid-on was up so he opened the bat face and checked the lofted drive over mid-on. Ab does not give up on the ball, runs back and almost gets there eventually. But the ball plonks one arm beyond him and trickled away"
"good length outside off, guided away to third man for a run"
"back of a length outside off, 143 kph, nudged down to third man for a run"
"130 kph, short around off, the ball is just below the shoulder as Rana lets that go the keeper"
"that may be the first bouncer of the over? Another bouncer on middle and leg, Rana gets underneath that too. Lots of bouncers from RCB."
"shortish and wide outside off, Rana's feet aren't moving much. The ball goes past"
"slow on middle and leg, a thick inside edge towards short fine leg for a run."
"nicely hit. Slow outside off, chipped away over cover for a couple. Very neatly played"
"flat around off, Rana misses his sweep and is struck on the body"
"slow outside off, carved towards third man for a run."
"very nicely played. A low full toss outside off, driven away through cover. He's kept to Sundar for so long, he knows what's coming. And finds the gap."
"slow around off, nudged away towards midwicket for one. Another tidy over from KKR, they're doing this very very nicely."
"short outside off, Karthik goes back and pulls to long-on for a run."
"the googly outside off, that's a very predictable delivery now from Chahal. Left alone, wide."
"a shortish delivery around off, Rana goes back and pulls to deep midwicket for a couple. Played that along the ground."
"the googly outside off, cut to deep point for a run"
"again, too predicable, the wide legbreak. Outside the tramline, should have been wide."
"the flipper. Short, but very quick. A thick inside edge into the pad, Karthik didn't quite pick the length of that."
"<strong>should have been wide again!</strong> Slow and wide outside off, Karthik missed his lofted drive but the ball spun past the tramline. That's two runs KKR should have got."
"on the pads, worked away to deep square leg for a run."
"short around off, pulled to deep square leg, along the ground, rolling his wrists on that."
"a nice slower ball around off, dips late, driven back to the bowler."
"135 kph, that's close? Was there some bat? A low full toss on leg, Rana misses the flick, the ball takes the pad en route to fine leg. If there was no bat, that should have been out."
"drifts down leg, WIDE!"
"short and drifts down leg, another wide. Free runs."
"141 kph, back of a length down leg, off the glove or handle of the bat, down to fine leg. Karthik races back for two and makes it with a dive."
"that's a good bouncer! 141 kph, short around off, first bouncer of the over, he used that well. Hurries past Karthik's pull"
"flight outside off, Rana looks to drive the ball through cover but mis-times the ball to long-off instead."
"short and wide outside off, the ball is too wide and Karthik scythes it away through point. Easily put away. Chahal's slow, wide delivery has become predictable"
"80 kph, loads of flight yet again. That ball has worked previously but it's definitely not working today. Full and wide and slow. Smashed through cover for four. Running out of options?"
"the flat one on the pads, worked away to deep square leg"
"slow outside off, driven with the open face to point"
"lots of flight outside off, driven away to long-off for a run."
"nicely bowled, some flight around off, swept down to short fine leg for one."
"gets to the pitch, doesn't get too close, but gets underneath. Enough of getting. He then executes. Drilled over the bowler's head for six. Straight. Superb hit."
"and given! LBW. But Rana wants to review. That was the drifter. Sliding in through the air, pitches in front of middle and hits him in front of middle. <strong>That's relatively plumb</strong>. He missed a big sweep that he attempted, the ball was too full to play that stroke. No bat on that. Two reds and juuuust clipping the side of leg stump. A smile on umpire Shamsuddin's face. That was close."
"flat on middle, a thick inside edge to square leg for one. almost went through."
"slow outside off, Karthik opens the bat face and guides the ball to point for one. An under-rated shot, using the face to hit the ball square on the off side."
"quick on the pads, nudged down to fine leg fore one."
Rinku backs away and toe-ends the ball over mid-on. Gave himself some room and went boom. Off the toe end so the ball trickles into the boundary.
"a good short ball, around middle and leg. The ball is just over the shoulder. Left alone."
"well bowled. Full and wide outside off, the ball angles away, but it is inside the tramline. Called a wide. Another wrong call from the umpire."
"another bouncer! Short on middle and leg, through Rinku's pull. Should that have been the second bouncer of the over?"
"the third bouncer of the over? It's short again, goes past Rinku's pull again. Kohli thinks there is a definite edge on the pull. So he chooses to review. <strong>That is definitely at least the second bouncer of the over</strong>? RCB keep bowling bouncers and keep getting away with it, not their fault if the umpires are not calling them, obviously. Replays indicate there is an edge on that, so Rinku will have to go. He should have got at least one no-ball this over, though. I've not seen a single one-bouncer signal from an umpire today."
"full outside off, pushed away to cover. His feet are nowhere."
"full and wide outside off, 140 kph. Russell clears his front leg and smashes the ball to deep cover."
"Dre Russ clears his front leg and swats the ball over mid-on. Disdainful, Dre Russ-type heave."
"another short delivery, this is under the shoulder though. Russell misses an upper cut."
"short delivery down leg, 126 kph, slips down leg, called a wide."
"excellently bowled. That has to be one bouncer for the over? IT IS. The first one I've seen today. Follows Russell, just beaten"
"ANOTHER BOUNCER! Just under the shoulder, deems the square leg umpire. It's another short delivery that hurries Russell through the shot. Beaten"
"full delivery around middle and leg, Russell backs away and chips the ball over mid-off."
"DRE RUSS! In the slot from Umesh and Russell goes over long-on. In his wheelhouse, he clears his front leg and makes room for that shot. And then executes, way over long-on. Terrific shot."
"back of a length around middle, worked to square leg. Clever from Karthik."
"short and wide, Russell backs away, then goes back into the line. But the ball is well executed, just inside the tramline."
"called A WIDE! AND ONE BOUNCER! A short delivery on off, loops over Russell's head."
"a slower ball outside off, Russell is through the shot too early, toe-ends the ball back to the bowler."
"Russell holes out! A slower delivery outside off, just inside the tramline. Clears his front leg, and skews the ball off the outside half towards long-off. AB runs back and to his right from mid-off. McCullum runs in from long-on. McCullum will never let the ball go. Nor will AB. They almost collide. But AB takes a good catch eventually."
digs it in short again. Karthik is waiting for that and pulls through midwicket for four. Shot.
"full and wide outside off, the ball bounces over Karthik's drive."
"short and wide outside off, carved away to deep cover. Sundar runs in, and juggles the catch but puts it down. <b>That should have been taken</b>"
"that's the first bouncer of the over, or should be! On middle and leg, pulled down to fine leg for a run."
"133 kph, short down leg, that's wide. Waaaaay over the batsman's head. Shouldn't that have been a no-ball?"
"back of a length down leg, clipped to square leg for a run"
"a short slower ball down leg, helped along to fine leg"
"Vinay Kumar finishes the match with a swat through mid-on to put Kolkata Knight Riders on the board, toppling <strong>KKR with a four-wicket win at the Eden Gardens. </strong>"
