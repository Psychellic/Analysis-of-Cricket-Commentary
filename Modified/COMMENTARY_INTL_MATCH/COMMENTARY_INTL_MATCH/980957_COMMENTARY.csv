"fullish outside off, gets on the front foot to ease the ball to the right of cover point. A bit of outswing for Southee, as always"
"once again Southee goes full, searching for swing. It curls in towards off stump and Tiwary plays a checked drive to mid-off"
"low full-toss on off stump, punched to the left of mid-on"
"looks to straighten his line a touch and ends up overdoing it, slides it down the leg side - no swing this time"
"good ball, on the fullish side of a good length, angling into off stump - no swing again. Rahane works it away to the left of square leg, playing dangerously around his front pad, and Buttler chases back to make a scrambling save near the rope"
"length ball on middle and off, stays in the crease and pushes softly towards short extra cover and calls Rahane through for the single. Rahane starts a touch late, but the single is easily completed in the end"
"length ball on off stump, punched to mid-on"
"back of a length outside off, stabbed to backward point with an open bat face"
"short and wide, but it's a slower ball and Tiwary doesn't pick it. Slashes with no footwork and the ball drops under his bat and bounces through to the keeper"
"back of a length, closer to off stump this time, guided down to third man"
"back of a length, a tiny bit of shape in towards off and middle. Rahane thinks about whipping it into the leg side, chooses the conservative option in the end and defends down into the pitch"
"fuller, wider, but not full enough for the flat-bat loft over the covers. He throws his bat at it, ends up slicing it high in the air off the outside half of his bat, and Krunal Pandya comes in from third man to take a simple catch"
"short ball outside off, and again Tiwary's feet are rooted as he slashes at it. Extra bounce takes it past his edge"
"shortish outside off, stabbed away towards deep point, moving to his left. Interesting field placing, tells you Southee wants to keep the ball as wide of Smith's off stump as possible"
"full, slanting across Tiwary, who plays an open-faced drive that slices away through a misfielding backward point fielder"
"fuller now, fifth-stump line, driven to short extra cover"
"uh oh. That was shortish and fairly wide, and Smith plays an angled-bat slash and gets an inside edge that screams away to the left of a diving Parthiv Patel. He gets a bit of glove to it, so you could call it a <b>drop</b>, harshly"
"and again. This one's a bit wider, and the inside edge is a little thicker, and it bounces down and goes further to the left of Parthiv, and runs away to the fine leg boundary once again"
"that's too wide, on a length, and Smith can get on the front foot and slash it away a fair distance to the right of the deep point fielder"
"shortish outside off, poked away to backward point"
"gone, is it? No, it isn't. Jasprit Bumrah makes a mess of a fairly simple catch at mid-on. Another short ball, angling into Tiwary this time, and he's late on the pull as it hurries onto him, and the ball pops up softly off the high part of the bat. Bumrah mistimes his jump, the ball ricochets up off his palm, and he can't get it on the rebound either, diving desperately to his left"
"length ball outside off, and Smith walks all the way across to clip it crisply to the midwicket boundary"
"bouncer outside off, Smith can't time the tennis smash as well as he'd like, and it bounces down to mid-on"
"bouncer, too much width outside off, and Smith leans back to uppercut it into the stands to the right of third man"
"short outside off, and Bumrah's travails continue. Smith pulls it, and the man at mid-on fluffs up a simple fielding effort, letting the ball slip through for three unearned runs"
"quickish length ball on off stump, clipped to midwicket"
sees Smith backing away to make room to hit through the off side and fires it at his pads. Smith can't put bat to ball
"length ball, at the batsman, pushed down to long-off"
"a bit of flight on off stump, slogged along the ground to long-on"
"fired into Smith's pads again and he flicks it away, in the air. I'm not sure he timed it 100% as well as he wanted, but it still soars away over the square leg boundary"
"length ball on middle and leg, swiped to midwicket"
and he has to duck after bowling his first ball. It's a length ball on off stump and Tiwary clears his front leg and clubs it fiercely past his ducking head
"back of a length on off stump, pushed into the off side"
"slower ball, follows the batsman as he looks to make himself room, and he swipes at it and pops it in the air, just wide of the diving McClenaghan, moving backwards and to his left from mid-on"
"yorker, squeezed into the leg side"
"low full-toss on off stump, and once again he clears his front leg and flat-bats it between bowler and mid-on"
"slower ball, back of a length on leg stump. Bit of an offcutter, and Tiwary wants to work it into the leg side but realises he's going against the turn, and ends up poking it back towards the bowler"
"back of a length on off stump, makes room and slaps to sweeper cover"
"sees him looking to make room and fires it wide of off stump, too wide"
"wide again, not as wide this time, and Tiwary uses all the swinging room to get down on one knee and slog-sweep over wide long-on"
"full-toss on off stump, whipped away to the left of long-on"
"quickish length ball on the pads, Tiwary can't bring his bat around to clip it through the leg side"
"full-toss again, and he clears his front leg once more to clout it over a leaping deep midwicket fielder"
"fullish on middle stump and Tiwary slogs it away again, to the right of Harbhajan Singh at deep square leg. He didn't have to move too far, and he makes a mess of a fairly straightforward stop at the rope"
"starts with a length ball, starts with a length ball down the leg side"
"short on off stump, and Smith is on his back foot in an instant, swivelling on his back toe to pull it fiercely over midwicket"
"slower length ball outside off, poked into the covers. He wants the single but Rohit moves quickly to his left from extra cover to deny him"
sees Smith coming down the track and bowls a wide length ball. Smith slaps it to the man at deep point
"shortish, lots of width, slapped away, but he's got a man sweeping on the cover point boundary for exactly that kind of ball"
"slower ball, back of a length outside off, and Krunal dives to his left at backward point to stop the ball after Smith uses his hands brilliantly to slice it wide of him"

"length ball wide of off, flat-batted to the right of extra cover"
sees him stepping out and bowls a slower one at his legs. Clipped down to long-on
"back of a length outside off, and Smith's attempted dab ends up going too fine. He was looking at the fine third man region, and ends up finding the keeper's gloves. Parthiv read the play well and took a step to his right before he dived"
"shortish outside off, and that's some steep bounce to beat the edge of his attempted stab through point"
a bit more width and Buttler dives to his left at backward point to stop a well-struck cut
"once again a bit of width, and once again Buttler dives to his left to stop Handscomb's cut"
"again short, not as much width, but Handscomb creates some by stepping away from the line of the ball, and slaps it to the man at deep point"
tossed up outside off and Handscomb skips out to drive to long-off
sees him step out and bowls it shorter and wide outside off. Slapped to sweeper cover
"down the track again as Harbhajan offers a bit of loop outside off, plays a wristy drive down to long-off"
"fetches the shortish ball from wide of off stump and pulls into the gap between deep midwicket and long-on. The two fielders converge, and Rayudu, running from deep midwicket and diving to his right, pushes the ball past Southee coming in the other direction. Harbhajan yells at Rayudu, and he yells back. Harbhajan goes all the way to the fielder to comfort him, but Rayudu is still seething"

"full outside off, squeezed away through point"

"full on off stump, whipped to mid-on, who's right on the edge of the circle, allowing the easy single"
"flat length ball on off stump, and it's perhaps a touch quicker than Handscomb would like as he reaches out to sweep it. He's not able to far enough forward to get on top of the ball, and it bounces, takes his top edge, and finds the man at deep square leg"

"back of a length on middle stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"tossed up on off stump, pushed to short extra cover"

"back of a length close to off stump, punched into the covers"
"shortish outside off, angling into the batsman. Dhoni lets it come on and dabs it softly into the point region"
"back of a length on middle stump, cramps the batsman for room, and he blocks it back to the bowler. He was opening up at the hips, looking for something he could club into the leg side"
"again he clears his front leg and McClenaghan hurries him with a quick short ball at his body. He's late on the pull, and the ball pops up softly, over the umpire, and bounces down to the right of mid-on"

"in the blockhole on off and middle, clipped gently into the leg side"
"fired in flat from wide of the crease, ends up firing it down the leg side"
"back of a length on off stump, a little slower, and Dhoni opens out to flat-bat to long-on"
"quickish, back of a length, wide of off. Not short enough to cut and he has to reach out as well, and he inside-edges it down into the pitch"
"wide again, but fuller, and Tiwary reaches out to stab into the covers and bring up his half-century"
"full and quick on off stump, driven to long-off"
"down the track and he converts this quickish full ball into a full-toss, flat-bats it hard down the ground and Pollard covers a lot of ground to his left from long-off and dives to stop it close to the boundary"
fullish on off stump. Dhoni clears his front leg and flat-bats to mid-off
"back of a length, angling into the batsman, and it sneaks past the inside edge as he looks to pull - wasn't short enough for it, and doesn't miss the top of the stumps by much"
"back of a length again, outside off this time, and the ball sneaks below Dhoni's attempted slash"
"fuller, a touch too full for Dhoni to get under the big hit over the leg side, and he swipes along the ground to deep midwicket"

"shortish outside off, swatted away to deep midwicket"
"full on middle stump, driven past the bowler to long-off"
"short, leg-stumpish, bad ball considering fine leg is inside the circle, and Dhoni steps across to help it away - it was off the glove, actually - to the right of the fielder"
"short on middle stump. Dhoni jumps to work it off his hip through square leg. He slips while turning at the end of his first run, but gets up very quickly, sees that the fielder still has a bit of ground to cover, and sprints through for the second"
"back of a length at the hips, and this time fine leg is back. Dhoni glances very fine, and Bumrah sprints to his right and puts in a slide to stop it near the rope"
"slower short ball outside off, pulled away through backward square leg"
"close to the blockhole outside off, looks to swipe it down the ground, can't really middle it, and Southee falls to his right in his follow-through to stop the ball"
"full-toss speared across the left-hander, wide outside off, flat-batted over the bowler's head, not very hard, and long-on runs to his right to stop it"
"shortish, angling in from wide of the crease. Dhoni makes a bit of room to jab it into the point region"
"slower ball at the legs. Tiwary slogs at it, miscues it high in the air, and it drops between the converging bowler and long-on"
"slower ball, shorter this time, following Tiwary's movement away from the leg stump. Tiwary has been visibly tiring over the last few overs, and he didn't have the strength left to muscle a slower ball over the man stationed at deep midwicket. Hits it straight into his lap"
back of a length close to off stump. Dhoni shuffles across and works it through midwicket
"back of a length on off stump, lets it come on to steer it to the right of backward point"
"lovely slower ball, turning like an offbreak towards middle stump, and Perera can't take the risk of slogging against the break. Lets it come on and dabs it away towards short third man"
"wide yorker. Perera can't get across far enough to lap it towards fine leg, and the ball sneaks through to the keeper"
"wide and full again, angling away from the left-hander. He's cleared his front leg too early, and has to reach across too far, and can only leave it in the end"
"wide outside off again, shorter, and maybe the change in length increases the angle away from Perera far enough for the umpire to call it wide"
"bouncer, Perera has to fetch the pull from outside off, against a shoulder-high ball, and top-edges it safely between Rayudu at deep midwicket and Harbhajan at deep square leg. Rayudu makes the sliding stop, Harbhajan fetches the ball and throws"

"back of a length and some gentle swing outside off, tapped towards point"
"good length and just a shade outside off, Rohit drops it defensively in front of cover"
"back of a length and swigs back in, cramping the batsman for room. Jabbed towards midwicket as Rohit gets off the mark"

"overpitched on middle, Parthiv stretches forward and drives it firmly to mid-on"
"length ball close to off stump, dabbed into the point region"
"back of a length on off stump, it wasn't exactly a short ball, but it was short enough for Rohit, simply got his front leg out of the way and swatted it over midwicket"
"short again, outside off this time. Rohit looks for that front-foot pull again, fetching it from outside off, and ends up top-edging it to the third man boundary"
"length ball on off and middle, clipped to midwicket"
"and another. This one's fuller, offering some room outside off stump, and Rohit throws his bat at it, aiming over the covers, and gets a thick edge that flies to the third man boundary. Third man had come into the circle just before that ball"
"length ball on middle, clipped away through square leg"
"back of a length, a bit of movement into the left-hander to cramp him for room, and he manages to flap that pull away through square leg"
"yorker, a bit of swerve into middle stump. Parthiv manages to get his pad out of the way and jam his bat down on it"
"this time he goes for the wide short ball angled away from the left-hander, ends up bowling it too wide. Parthiv can't connect with the slash"
"in the blockhole on off stump, and Parthiv gets a full face behind it, the bat is perfectly vertical on impact, and it races away between the stumps and the non-striker"
"length ball wide of off stump, and he loves width, just flays it away through cover point"
"short, wide, cracked away, went like a flash to the left of backward point"

"fullish on off stump, clipped to the left of midwicket, who makes a diving stop"
"length ball on middle stump, clipped to square leg"
"back of a length outside off, dabbed into the point region"
"full, straight, and that's an excellent change of length to Rohit, who often gets into a tangle with his front pad planted across the stumps. Plays around it, misses, and there's a big appeal for lbw, but it's sliding down leg"
"back of a length, angling into off and middle, defended into the covers"
"that's not a short ball, it's probably only marginally short of a good length. It's on off stump. And Rohit, maybe he's set himself up for this ball, just clears his front leg and pulls it to the square leg boundary"
"length ball outside off, eased into the cover point region"
