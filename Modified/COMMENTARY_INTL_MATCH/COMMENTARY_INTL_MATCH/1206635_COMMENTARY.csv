"<strong>ooh, good ball!</strong> Length, outside off, and Karunaratne has a poke at it. Some good bounce on this, as it moves away off the seam. Beats him"

"length, and he punches this from the crease, just beyond point. An easy single on offer"

"full ball again, and swings in, and beats him for pace yet again. Hits him pretty high too"
"full again, and this time down the pads and Karunaratne gets enough bat to run this away towards long leg. Third time lucky for the Sri Lankan captain"

"fuller ball, just outside off, and Fernando looks to jag his bat down on it. Just around the outside edge and goes through to Rizwan. Hands on head around for the Pakistan camp. <strong>That was close, too!</strong>"
"length, slants away, and he leaves. Not way off the off stump, but well judged by the batsman"

"length, wider, and he presses forward and squeezes this to the left of point. Easy two for him. Well controlled and placed nicely"
"<strong>ooh, pings him on the pads again!</strong> Yet again, perhaps going down leg side, though. Fuller ball, and Karunaratne falls over a touch as he looks to flick this. The pace and inward movement beat him, but strikes him with off and middle stumps visible. Squirts away towards square leg"
"length, straightens into him from outside off, and he defends towards mid-wicket"
"length, jags back in, and <strong>comes off the inside edge</strong>, hits his thigh and drops at the crease! Lucky again, the batsman"

"shorter, and he drops it with soft hands towards short mid-wicket, and sets off for a single. Easily through"
"length, and he presses forward to defend this. No great movement on it, so he just has to cover the line and defend"
"this has struck him again on the pads. Loud appeal, but they choose not to review this! Angles in from outside off, and hits him quite high, even though it may have just edged leg stump this time. Was given not out anyway, so it might have stayed with the umpire's call"
"length, zips in, and he defends from the crease"
"banged in short, and this pitch just doesn't have that much zip. Karunaratne can adjust nicely and guide it towards deep square leg. Some hard running fetches them two"
"length, and he presses forward to defend this towards cover"
"<strong>ooh, what happened there?</strong> This has swung back in a long way, and struck the top of off, <b>BUT THE BAIL DIDN'T COME OFF!</B> How unlucky is that for Shinwari?"
"fuller, swings in, and he drives this to mid-on"
"shortish ball, and he plays this towards short mid-wicket. They set off for a run, and there's a direct hit at the non-striker's end, but he's through. <strong>And off the mark</strong>!"

Smiling now and jumping back up on this feet as the doctor runs on. He was ducking a short one coming in from outside off. That didn't rise too much. Looks like he's indicating that it hit the bone on the base of his neck. Just above where his name is on the jersey. He was taking his eyes off that one"

"<strong>that should be it, and is given!</strong> Given out leg before, to a full ball that seemed headed for the base of middle. Karunaratne has reviewed this. Bowled from fairly close to the stumps, and had the pace to beat the inside edge, as <i>Karunaratne fell over, as he has a tendency to do</i>, when flicking.

"<strong>oh, lucky!</strong> Touch fuller from Naseem, and he was looking to go inside out towards cover. This flies off the edge and goes past point through to the backward point fence"
"<strong>got him this time!</strong> Naseem has threatened with this ball a few times this session, and finally he strikes. Gets a ball to pitch on a good length, and just a touch of movement takes it away from Fernando, who gets drawn into poking his bat at it.

"<b>got him!</b> Top-class bowling! I said two balls ago that Mendis dug deep into the crease to protect himself from edging the outgoing delivery. This time he goes fishing away from his body on the front. Length ball again, marginally fuller, and draws Mendis into the drive. Late movement away and then off the seam as well.
