"short of length delivery that shapes away from off, Surya is on top of the bounce as he defends"

"wants the single, but is sent back. Rinku swoops in from point and stops"
works this wide of midwicket as he jogs the single
"bunts it into the off side as they scamper a single. Good start, hit the deck hard at length, Surya got this high on the bat towards point"
"angles in a length ball, defended with soft hands"
"width outside off, slashes this down to square third man"
"yorker-length on the stumps from wide of the crease, squeezed back towards the bowler."
"once again, good bounce off the deck. Gets bounce as Surya is hit high on the bat as he defends. Lovely from Prasidh"
"sliced over backward point, sails over the ropes. Not much wrong with the length, quite full but Surya had enough width to throw his bat at that."
<b> squared up to beat the outside edge. </b> Lovely delivery first up. Moved away from length
sees this in his half and belts this over cover. Almost as if Lewis had decided he'd just look to blast this. Not quite to the pitch but he swung this through nicely.
squeezes this square drive to Narine at square third man. Just raced to him
<strong>delicate dab</strong> wide of the slip fielder. Saw width and used it to ease this to the third man boundary.
"half-volley on the pads, flicked to fine leg"
right behind the line as he tucks this wide of midwicket for an easy single
"on middle and leg, tucked towards square leg"

"full, spins back in from off stump, defended back"
works this length ball down to long on
"touch short, he goes back and bunts this to cover"
"splits the gap, beats cover, beats Russell at long-off. Something about his effort suggested he didn't go full tilt, but I think even a fitter Russell would've struggled. So well timed. Too short and it was belted away."
dabs this length ball to slip. Tried to pick the gap between keeper and slip. Brave
"too close to the stumps at length, once again steers this straight to slip. Surya looking to be too cute here."
stubs this down to square third man where Russell puts out a superb dive to stop. <strong>Saved three runs</strong>
"backs away and slaps this over point. Wanted to go over cover, lost his shape but ended up slicing it up and over. He'll take the runs"
"<strong>lovely shape away to beat the edge.</strong> Bounce, pace and carry. He's regularly bowling around the 140 mark"
"<b> dropped by Kuldeep running back from square leg! </b> Prasidh beat Lewis for pace, took him on with the pull and got it high on the bat. Lucky to get away. Lewis was hustled and in no position to play that in front of square. Prasidh's first IPL wicket will have to wait"
starts with a full toss and Surya says fetch that! Pulled to beat deep backward square leg. Fierce sweep
"too full outside off, Surya gets to the pitch and belts this over cover. Sparkling stuff. Enters the 400+ club this season with that"
"inside edges a drive off the pad to cover, quick single pinched"
"<b> what a strange way to go. </b> This was a loose delivery, a half-tracker on middle and leg, the ball took ages to get to Lewis, who was already through with the pull. The ball looped off the back of the bat after it hit the thigh and then to short third man. The missed opportunity doesn't cost KKR much."
works this against the line to midwicket
punches this straight to Curran at cover point
works this length ball from outside off towards midwicket
"defends back. Narine took the pace off, spun back in from length as Surya played that"

wrong'un which Rohit lunges and dabs to the off side for a quick single
"waits, waits and then drills this tossed up delivery to long off where Prasidh misfields to give away a second"

"reads the googly, cuts late but straight to point"

"drifts in full from wide of the crease, turns this to midwicket"
"skids through from length, Rohit gets a thick inside edge to midwicket"
"slow turn from length on off, dabbed towards point"
"goes for a mighty heave, misses. <strong>Wasn't far from off stump.</strong> Lost shape, bottom hand came off the bat handle. This was a googly too."
works this from outside off towards midwicket
pulled straight to Rinku at deep midwicket. He didn't have to move an inch. This isn't a magic ball. Right there for the pull but Surya didn't get any power or timing behind that. Surya has thrown away a strong start.
"flighted full outside off, and driven well to cover. Straight to the man though. That could've been the breakout shot"
"full on middle, and he's down on one knee to sweep it behind square. Deep backward square cleans up"
"<b>just over Kuldeep's outstretched hands!</b> Drifted into middle stump, and Rohit drives too early. The ball holds off the pitch, and Rohit pushes it straight back. In the air, but just over the bowler's left hand. Close!"
"through his defenses! Full outside off, and it's the one that goes straight through. Kishan tried to defend it towards cover, but he played for the wrong'un"
"uses his feet, and sent over <b>wide long on!</b> Used all his muscle to tonk that. Didn't get to the pitch but that didn't matter"
steps out and drills this down to long on
the reverse sweep over short third man. Picked the wrong'un so he was hitting this with the spin. Very clever
"beaten on the pull, the short ball drifted away and would've missed off stump. KKR have reviewed! Umpire's original decision stays and <b> KKR lose a review </b> Pitched miles outside leg as well."
"fires this <strong>length ball at 116kph</strong> on middle, bunted to point"
"swept besides short fine. Too flat, too quick and Kishan picked that away superbly."
works this length ball from outside off towards square leg. The closest fielder - short fine leg - took a while to get there
"pulled but he splits deep square leg and fine leg. Got the impression that he didn't time it well, but was perfectly into the gap. Spun away on the practice turfs. Big over!"
....and starts with a wayward delivery down leg. Wide
uses the depth of the crease to ease this down to third man
skiddy bouncer but <strong>way over Kishan's head</strong> as he looks to swivel back and pull. Beaten.
"squeezes this yorker-length ball back, Russell can't stop it cleanly"
"<b> Rana puts down a straightforward offering at backward point! </b> The timing of his jump was off. Went with his palms facing upwards, and rightly so, but fluffed it. Rohit saw the width and looked to go over cover, sliced it and survives."
"was shaping up to heave, ends up dabbing it gently into the off side instead"
"slower and fuller on middle and leg, worked wide of midwicket"
"<strong>clean, crisp strike. Fearless, ferocious</strong>. Kishan is on a roll. Too full and angling away, he's down on one knee as he absolutely belts this inside-out to beat sweeper cover."
dabs this down to third man
backs away and slaps this to point. Didn't quite get the width he would've liked.
"bottom edge, but this races fine to the third man boundary. He was looking to cut"
"pulled in front of square, didn't get hold of it but there's still enough fizz to split the gap between deep square and wide long on."
thick inside edge to deep square. Looked to flay this on the up
"slower length ball, Kishan hops across and pulls over short fine. Sweet! Excellent match awareness, signs of knowing the field inside-out"
"googly, picks it off the hand, drives inside-out to cover"
"turns back in from length on middle and leg, worked to deep square"
"swept high and handsome, way over deep square leg. He saw Kishan stepping out so fired it in, he went down on his knee instead to bring out the sweep. Got it off the middle. Wow"
"belted across the line, slogged and it clears deep midwicket with ease. This wasn't easy because he had to fetch it from way outside off. Huuuuuuuge"
"steps out and flat-bats this over long on to bring up <strong>a 17-ball fifty</strong>. Joint-fastest for Mumbai Indians. Stunning innings, the captain applauds and then gives him a bear hug"
walks across the stumps and uses his wrists to whip this full delivery over deep midwicket. Stunning. Countered the drift with his wrist work and bottom handed power. <b> Shades of MS Dhoni and his helicopter shot </b>
punches this length ball to deep point
swing and a miss. Narine carefully drifted this across. Kishan heaved wildly
"where has he hit this? Don't worry, deep into the stands at deep midwicket. Down on one knee, underneath the flight as he picks the bones out of the slog sweep. The perfect swing, a golfer's delight. This is some batting, right out of the top drawer."
"swept again but this time he's picked out Uthappa right at the ropes at deep square leg. So, so close to being a seventh six. Sensational knock, one that has given them a kick towards the death overs. Kishan is bitterly disappointed but he can be mighty proud of his efforts."
turns this gently into the leg side
"too full and drifting in, eased to long on"
"hops back and bunts this down to square third man, excellent running, wayward Narine throw."
"legcutter outside off, steers this straight to point. Good work by Rana at point"
"backs away to go over cover but Kishan slips in a yorker, squeezed back"
"<b> run out missed! </b> Back of length on off, slaps this to cover and scampers a run. Hardik had given up, a direct hit by Chawla at the bowler's end and he would've been running back to the dugout."
"backs away and forces this length ball wide of cover. <b> Oh, dear. Has he overstepped? Freehit </b> This is a ridiculous call for no-ball, clearly had half a foot  behind the line. <b> KN Ananthapadmanabhan </b> is the umpire. Curran and KKR have seen it on the big screen and have asked for the decision to be overturned, but the umpires can't do that according to the rule book. This is ridiculous. <b> Michael Clarke on air calls this a disgrace </b>"
"lofted but off a thick inside edge, down to long on"
"back of length on middle and leg, works this to square leg."
swept from outside off to deep square
mistimes an attempted hoick to deep square leg
"chops a cut, DK runs across to stop. Swift work"
"rocks back to cut, down to deep cover"
"slogged, don't worry about the line. Way over deep midwicket. Walked across the stumps to negate the width, and muscled it away"

"walloped! Length outside off, Hardik held his shape and deposited that slower delivery over the deep midwicket boundary"
"toe-ends a paddle, can't get it up and over"
"sees the batsman trying to back away and floats this wide, misses the wide line by a long way."
drills this full delivery on the bounce to long off

"carved over square third man. Too much width, another full toss and he got down on it nicely to hit this up and over. <strong>One-handed slice</strong>"
"another full toss, surely a no-ball? They've asked for the ball back. Straight to long-on. Replays suggest this was just below the waist. Hardik has to go but he's done his job."
muscles the short ball in front of square to deep midwicket
toe-ends a lofted hit straight to mid-off. <b> First IPL wicket for Prasidh </b> and a slower delivery has earned him one. His one-time Karnataka team-mate takes the catch.

"slips this short and outside the wide line, Cutting leaves."
"Swing and a miss. Little more effort into the delivery, bounce as well. Cutting once again looked to pull from outside off"
drills this full delivery to long off
walks across and whips this full delivery towards fine leg. Russell took a while to run in and pick up
"in his hitting arc and this has vanished over wide long-on. Drifted in from wide of the crease, Cutting was waiting for it as he teed off like a golfer in style"
"too short, vanishes over deep midwicket. Stayed firm and muscled this away. DK's a worried man already"
"clobbered! This time on the bounce, bisects deep midwicket and long-on. He went length, got punished."
"swung through early, missed. Hit on the back"
"drags this from outside off, so there's no timing on this heave and DreRuss takes a superb catch with the boundary triangle just around the corner of his eyes. Took three steps to his right, maintained his balance and took it without much fuss."
"pulled, and pulled very very well. What a flourish, what a finish. Sitting up nicely as Krunal muscled this over deep midwicket. <b> KKR will have to bat out of their skins to get this. </b> 22 off the last over, not the finish they wanted."
over mid-off first ball for four! Not sure why that happened but Mitch bowled it straight and full on the off stump for Narine to loft that over a leaping mid-off for four
"short ball follows and mid-on takes it easily! Right on the money, Mitch! Bangs it in short, Narine opens up a bit and pulls for a top-edge that goes high and Krunal comes under it comfortably"
he angles it across from length and Lynn reaches out for it to drive but gets an inside edge to the leg side
"big edge, flies down to third man for a one-bounce four! Sees room outside off with that fullish length and he swings hard, gets an edge thick enough fine on the off side"

he goes back in the crease to let the ball turn and then helps it to short third man
"sees a short ball outside off and slaps it to cover, lands short of the fielder"
"that goes a bit high and behind the stumps, Kishan runs forward and dives desperately but it falls well short of him. Took a bit of glove when Lynn tried to pull the short ball"
"<b>smoked</b> this time! Another short ball, another pull and he connects this time and how! From the meat of the bat and it sailed to the midwicket boundary"
"fine leg is in, a short ball again and this time Lynn uses placement instead of power to pull it wide and square of short fine leg"
"slower delivery on back of length outside off, he waits and then steers it to backward point"

"comes down the track this time and Krunal pulls the length back a bit, a single towards cover"

"goes across the line with a heave and he connects enough to go over long on. It wasn't a bad ball, on length on off and he swiped it to the leg side"
"oh, <strong>mix up</strong> and Lynn is nowhere close! Uthappa sliced the ball to cover point and took a step or two out of the crease but Lynn reacted late and suddenly ran down the pitch but it was too late. Suryakumar swooped in and sent it a flat throw to Krunal well before Lynn could reach the crease"

"length delivery on the off stump this time, Rana blocks it back"

"<strong>beats the outside edge</strong>! Length delivery outside off that just about holds its line after coming in with the angle, Uthappa pokes and misses"
"<strong>nearly plays on</strong>! Strong finish from Bumrah to end the over with one that angles in, Uthappa gets an inside edge that nearly gets the off stump"
"starts on the pads, Rana is strong on that side and he clips it away nicely to roll it along the ground past short fine leg"
"around the off stump off back of length, Rana defends it late and behind square on off"

waits for the ball around off stump and defends to point
"a slow offcutter at 115kmh on the stumps to end the over, Rana makes room but gets a thick edge to cover point after attempting to slice it"

this one comes in with the arm and Uthappa helps it to leg off the back foot
on the leg side and Rana helps it away easily to deep square leg

back of length offcutter and Rana scythes it to deep point where Lewis does well to keep it to one
another offcutter and Russell pulls but connects well enough only for one
punches that uppishly towards mid off and that reaches the fielder after a couple of bounces
"135.9kmh, ducks for the short ball and <strong>takes it on the shoulder</strong>. Hardik banged it in short and maybe Russell picked the length a bit late and ducked late and took his eyes off the ball while ducking"
"<b>straight to cover</b>! A slower one outside off, Russell wants to pounce on it and makes room to slap it on the off side. He does that but hands it straight to Markande who grabs it with both hands over his head"

"swept against the turn from the meat of the bat and that reaches the boundary before a fielder an blink. Not that full, but DK swivels his bat with that loop and smashes it"
"another <strong>run-out chance</strong>, Hardik may not have collected the ball here! Rana steered the ball to point and DK wanted the single, he hared out and turned back too. Oh hello, that's so so close. Hardik's right hand is in front of the stumps as the throw comes in and looks like the hand has broken the stumps as it comes back to collect the ball. But the ball is <em>just</em> touching the hand as the zing bails light up. Umpire Dharamsena gives it out!"
"holes out to deep midwicket, Cutting takes a superb catch running to his right. What's happening here! A short ball from Hardik, Rana pulled and that hardly went any distance beyond the 30-yard circle, Cutting wasn't at the boundary but well inside and he did well to run a few yards to his right and slide to catch that"
angled across and he guides it towards third man dangerously past first slip
swing and a miss outside off this time
stays in the crease this time and pushes it down to mid on

short ball angled across and Rinku Singh waits for it to rise and then ramps it over the slip fielder for a well-placed four
"<strong>edged to the keeper</strong>, KKR collapsing on their home ground against seam bowling. Bumrah leaps in celebration and why shouldn't he. That one pitched around the leg stump and Bumrah angled it nicely to absolutely stifle the batsman with the line and he only tickled it to the keeper"
"right on the off stump, Chawla blocks it back"
waits for the short of length ball and steers it from off stump to point

"<em>just</em> outside off stump, Curran swings hard at it and misses it"
"too short, too slow, and Curran rocks back and pulls that away nicely between long on and deep midwicket. Almost pin-drop silence at the ground"

"short and on the leg side, Chawla tickles that absolutely fine on the leg side, past a diving Ishan Kishan for four"
"slogs it straight to SKY (Suryakumar Yadav) at wide long on, his second catch to add to Lynn's run out. Looked like a slower ball again, it was fullish on leg, and Chawla slogged it high on the leg side, easy catch in the deep"
"almost another run out! Curran helped that ball to backward point and there was another confusion - he went for the single, Kuldeep didn't want it and the ball just missed the stumps as Curran was making it back but was miles outside"
"slightly short outside off, he taps it to third man"
"angles it in from back of length, Kuldeep defends it back"
hardly moves his feet and steers the ball straight to point

takes a step down to negate the turn and turns the ball to leg for one
"the googly around off, he waits and then helps it to backward point"
<strong>outside edge</strong> goes off Kishan's gloves! The wrong'un again and Kuldeep went forward to defend but the turn took an edge and deflected off the keeper's gloves on the off side

tries to cut on the off side and misses
reaches out for it this time and sweeps it away for one

"just outside off and a thick edge goes to short fine leg, they sneak in a quick single and the fielder has a shy at non-striker's but misses"
"there comes the wicket, holes out to long on. Not quite long on, actually, because Duminy had to run in and towards his right a fair bit after Curran came down and skied it high"
a tiny forward stride to defends and manages a bit of bat
"starts with a flighted wrong'un, he does well to cover the stumps and get a thick edge to leg"

some flight on the stumps and he blocks it back
turns that one a long way outside off and Krishna can't reach it
goes back to cover the stumps with his pads and blocks the googly in time
leaves that alone as it turns a mile away from him
"and <strong>Krunal seals</strong> it, but <strong>Kuldeep reviews</strong> it. A reverse sweep from Kuldeep for the ball pitching on middle and leg stump and it's going pretty straight from around the wicket, goes under the bat, hits him in front of the stumps and it's <strong>all over</strong>"
