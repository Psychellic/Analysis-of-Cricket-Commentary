"lovely full inswinger from Thakur. He thinks he has his man lbw, but umpire Oxenford shoots down the appeal. Thakur wants a review, Kohli and Rahul decide against it. Guptill plays around his front pad and <strong>ekes out an inside edge</strong> to save himself"

"full and swinging in, Nicholls presses forward and drives between mid-on and short midwicket. He hares across for three. <strong>Excellent running from Nicholls and Guptill</strong>"
"driven through the line, but Guptill can't get it past mid-off. Test-match lines and lengths from Thakur, and he's finding some swing to boot"
"<strong>shot, Henry! </strong>He holds the pose like a boss and admires this stellar straight drive. He takes a step out, on a length on middle, drills it on the up over Thakur's head. First boundary of the day"

"bouncer from wide of the crease, Guptill has his eyes locked on the ball before ducking under it"
"<strong>another fiery lifter</strong>, angling in at the throat, cramps Guptill for room. He arches his back and doesn't drop his hands in time. He awkwardly ramps it between keeper and slip"

"bouncer, angling in from wide of the crease, 144ks, Guptill arches back, ramps and connects only with thin air"
"Guptill brings out the ramp, connects, and <strong>launches it into the second tier</strong> beyond third man. Not as short as the previous one, Guptill gets under it and gets it over the keeper's head in nonchalant fashion"
"pitched up on off, 144ks, squeezed to mid-on off the front foot"

"bumper down leg, too quick for Nicholls, as he is rushed into a hook and misses. Not a wide"

"flatter and shorter outside off, Nicholls goes deep in the crease and punches a single down to long-off"

"darted on off stump, patted down to long-on off the front foot"
"Has Chahal missed a return catch? It did carry, and the ball pops out. <strong>Yes, he has dropped it</strong>. On a length and breaks back in, Nicholls makes a bit of room and jabs it back to the bowler. This should've been taken"

"the legbreak wanders down legside, like an errant tourist not looking where they're going"
simple drive down the ground as he deals with a full ball cramping him
shimmies down to the pitch of the ball on leg stump and crunches it to long-on
makes him reach outside off - that's Chahal's specialty - but Guptill has a looooong reach and that helps him control the cover drive
"<b>lovely shot</b>. For a moment, it looks as if Chahal has done well to adjust to Nicholls coming down the track, firing it on the pads. But the batsman is able to make sure his front foot somehow doesn't get in the way of a glorious flick shot over mid-on"
"With the DRS clock pretty much on zero, Nicholls makes the call to <b>review an lbw decision</b>! Phew! Anyway, here are the deets. Chahal dishes out a fairly quick and very flat legbreak. The batsman goes for a sweep but it's too straight for a shot like that and he misses completely. Umpire Oxenford thought it was adjacent enough and ball-tracker juuuuuuust about agrees with him. Clipping the very top of the outside edge of the leg stump. That is sooo toit!"
"having been dismissed by a wide ball in the last game, he gets one first up in this one. Smooth drive into the covers though"
"keeps back to a good length ball on off stump and tries to work it past midwicket, no such luck"
"waits on it so nicely, meeting the straight ball under his eyes and working it behind square leg"
"tosses it up on off stump, lunges forward to defend"
"pushes it through on off stump, Guptill defends"
a neat roll of the wrists takes care of a very quick ball on leg stump and sends it to the left of midwicket
"slows it up this time, the length quite full. Blundell gets his head over the ball and blocks it"
"tosses it up outside off, defends"
<b>beats him</B> with a ripping legbreak. Plenty of turn. Plenty of bounce and again it is pitched wide of off stump to drag Guptill to play away from his body
pushes towards mid-off
"<b>there's fifty</b>! His first in 11 ODI innings and it comes as a result of a cut shot, a well controlled one, starting from his picking the length early and even benefiting from a misfield"
"good length, outside off, defends"
"<b>soars over the man leaping on that teeny tiny straight boundary</b>. Shreyas Iyer is the man at long-off. He does well to track the ball. And be mindful of the ropes. Jumps as high as he could with both hands over his head, but Guptill's straight hits are usually good enough, even if this one comes off the bottom of the bat"
drives to cover
"full and outside off, pushes to long-off"
opens the face and slides a good length ball on off stump through point
tries to work the wicket-to-wicket line past midwicket. No good.
this time the length is a little short and it allows Blundell to rock back and whip it past the right of midwicket

nudges a back of a length ball off his pads through to deep midwicket
"nice and tight on off stump, which means Blundell has to settle for chopping the ball to backward point"
"drifts down leg, which Blundell knows as he lets the ball go"
"shortish on off stump, knocks it down to midwicket, who attempts a no-look-backhand flick at the non-strikers and it pretty much goes as you expect it to - all the way out to long-off"
"<b>outstanding shot</b>! A picture perfect straight drive to a ball that is nowhere near a half-volley. If he plays no other cricket, this one hit alone would show just how technically good Blundell is"
"shortish and on off stump, tries to dab it behind point for some runs. Doesn't happen"
"<b>whacks it again</b>. This time he shows his ability against the short ball, picking the length early and dragging it from way outside off to pierce the gap at midwicket"
"<b>huuuuuge appeal for lbw</b>. Jadeja thinks it's pad first, but he can't convince his captain to review. The good length ball is fired into middle stump and replays suggest Guptill pretty much middled the ball. But whooooaaa! <b>Replays show it does snick the pad first and ball-tracker says it would go on to hit the stumps as well</b>! Definitely did not play like that to the naked eye!"
works it into the leg side
<b>glorious shot</b>! Rocks back in his crease as soon as he sees a very rare Jadeja long hope and carves it behind point
"<b>leading edge</B> as Jadeja gives it a proper rip. He also makes sure the batsman can't reach the pitch, which is where Guptill is deceived as he plays into the leg side"
""
"jabs it past the left of midwicket Ooooh, that ball takes a bit of the surface with it. <b>Big puff of dust</b>"
defends a good length ball to cover

"oooh, that's nice. Saini angles a good length ball in towards middle stump and Blundell makes sure he plays straight and avoids being bowled"
"charges out of his crease and is beaten by a little nip in off the pitch, Saini's good length ball, and his adjustment seeing the batsman charging to bowl closer to his body, works, beating the inside edge"
"shifts his weight outside off to deal with these balls angled into him, allowing himself the room to whirl those wrists and hit behind square leg"
"back of a length and outside off, steers it to point"
rocks back to slice a shortish delivery outside off through cover
loops it up a shade outside off as Guptill stretches forward to drive to long-off
"lovely dip from Chahal. The ball is tossed up enough to drive the drive, but it drops very quickly, forcing Blundell to just defend"
"excellent feet from Blundell, stepping out to get close to the ball on middle and whacking it down the ground"
"<b>misfield saves Blundell</B>. He's more than halfway down the pitch after Guptill defends a good length ball towards point. There's where Manish Pandey is and somehow, inexplicably, he doesn't even pick up the ball properly"
"slides on straight to middle stump, Guptill blocks its progress"
"there's his natural wristwork - he waits on the short ball outside off and even though it is on the rise, he is confident enough to get on top of it and whip to midwicket"
"full on off stump, defends uncertainly towards midwicket"
"stands tall and punches a back of a length ball to the right of short cover, but Kohli leaps to his right to stop any runs"
"<b>picks it up and pummels it</b>. Too easy when it's short at Thakur's pace. Here Guptill doesn't even have all that much room, but he still hits it so hard in front of midwicket"

mis-hits a short ball outside off and the toe-end shot finds Kohli at short cover
stays back and nudges a shortish ball off his pads through square leg
gets forward to a full ball outside off and drives to long-off
whip-pulls a short ball from outside off stump down to long-on
slides on with the arm and straight into the pad as Guptill tries to flick to midwicket
"<b>dangerous shot</b>, playing the cut to Jadeja, especially off the stumps. He bowls so quick that he can beat you and bowl you"
attempts the late cut again and this time he's better prepared. Finds the gap past point after taking it off off stump
comes off as a fairly slow short ball seeing as he pretty much digs it into his own half of the pitch. Guptill pulls to deep square leg
"<b>hammers it down the ground</b>! Blundell spots the half-volley, presses forward and gives it everything he's got to beat mid-off"
"<b>taken at mid-on</b>! An innings full of promise, undone by poor shot selection. He had pressure on the bowler. He was trying to put more on him by taking a length ball outside off and slogging it away. Only, he mis-hits it to the man inside the circle. Thakur gives the batsman a tiiiiiny bit of a send-off."
outside edge first up as he defends a good length ball outside off

waits on the fuller ball quite nicely and turns it from off stump through square leg
"nice and slow on off stump to the new batsman, Taylor defends to cover"
"good length on middle, turns it towards square leg"
slides down leg as he goes quick at the set batsman. Guptill finds a single to deep square leg
<b>lovely cricket</b>! Taylor knows he only needs to get the littlest bat on it with Jadeja firing them in on leg stump. The picture perfect leg glance
waits on the back foot and tucks it behind square leg
"good length, sliding on with the arm. Guptill plays for spin and gets hit on the pad. Would be going down leg this time"
giving width to Taylor is a big no-no. He absolutely whacks it over point
"full on middle, drives to mid-on"
shapes to pull a short ball outside off but only finds midwicket
finds a single at deep square leg as he pulls another short ball
"full on middle, he defends to mid-on"
<b>nails the pull</b>! The gap is behind square leg so Guptill rolls his wrists and concentrates solely on placement. Excellent cricket
eases the full ball on the stumps to short cover
"<B>Guptill run-out!</b>. Ooooh, there is never a single there, but Taylor has his mind set on it having played a reverse sweep off the back of the bat. There is no real hesitation in the running, just that Thakur is very alert there and flings in a flat throw right over the top of the stumps. So basically, the fielder does everything right and gets a wicket, the batsmen do one thing wrong and they lose a wicket"
"again, starts off slow and full to the new batsman. Defends"

"full on leg stump, whips to deep square leg"
"<B>huuuuuge appeal for lbw</b> from Jadeja as he pins Taylor on the back foot. The batsman is playing across the line and the ball having hit a good length does skid on, but it probably would have gone down leg as well"

"goes short and at the body, Taylor pulls to deep square leg"
opens the face and sends the short ball to deep third man
"<b>gives him lbw but Latham reviews</B>. Jadeja is around the wicket to the left-hander, hitting a good length and pinning Latham on off stump. But with this angle, it might well have missed off stump. Unless it turns enough. Latham is playing the sweep - it's his go-to shot, only this time he doesn't connect and now has to wait for a few and poof he has to walk off.

"slower short ball outside off, scythed to deep point. Jamieson searches for the second, Taylor sends him back"
"fumbled for four. Blundell messes up at mid-off. Pitched up and outside off, solidly driven straight of mid-off. He dives over the ball and leaks four"
"full-toss, heading down the leg side, tickled away to the fine-leg fence. Easy peace"
"near yorker, tailing in on middle, squirted to midwicket"

"back of a length and outside off, smeared to Jamieson at cover-point"
"short and swinging away wide of off, Shaw relishes width. He thumps a cut in the air over backward point"
back of a length and slanted down leg. Bennett is spraying the ball all around the shop. He needs to tighten up
much better from Bennett. He hits that hard length and gets it to shape away from an off-stump line. Agarwal loosens his grip and defends off the back foot
"bumper outside off, soars into the gloves of Latham. Too high, so that's a wide"
"back of a length and outside off, lovely back-foot punch from Agarwal, finds the gap between covers and point. Agarwal thinks he has got four. Then realises the ball plugs in the outfield, and comes back for the second"
"<strong>nicked off to slip.</strong> Taylor in the thick of the action once again. In-between length from Bennett - he is in the side to hit that length. Angling in from over the wicket and straightens away outside off. Agarwal is caught on the crease. He is opened up, edging it to Taylor"
"on a length on off, Kohli gets inside the line and flicks with the angle behind square to get off the mark"
"shortish and around off, Shaw is in two minds: where to play or not. He does a bit of both and fends it to cover"
"back of a length and outside off, 139ks, Shaw clunks it over mid-on inside the circle. Not middled, but the ball rolls away to the fence"
"good length, starts outside off and swings away against the angle, no shot"
"on a length and on fifth-stump line, this comes back with the angle from over the wicket. Kohli drives a long way away from his body and <strong>inside-edges it away past leg stump</strong>"
"<strong>Shaw continues to deal in fours</strong>. On a length and outside off, cracked on the up through the covers. He stays leg-side of the ball and flays it away"

"back of a length and angling in at off, Shaw shuffles across and pushes to mid-on"
"on a length and just a shade outside off, punched on the up but Shaw can't get it past short cover"
"<strong>Jamieson storms through the defences of Shaw</strong>. Lands it on the seam and bowls the opener through the gate. What a way to get your first wicket - at your home ground. Good length, Jamieson brings this one back sharply and makes Shaw's attempted drive look a whole lot worse. Timbaaah and NZ are into India's middle order already. Shaw: six fours and out"
"good length, angling in and bending away extravagantly outside off, Kohli chases and is beaten lavishly"
Kohli slices an attempted cover drive and the ball streaks away to backward point
"on a length and swings outside off, not a half-volley, but Iyer takes it on and crunches a drive through cover. That's how good Iyer is. First-ball four"
"full and Southee brings this back to threaten off from wide of the crease, pushed back to him"
"wide of the crease, short and holds its line around off, Iyer rides it out to point"
Iyer threads the cordon. Rides another short ball outside off and dabs it between slips and gully for four
"pitched up and slanting in at off, forward and driven to mid-on"
"on a length and outside off, Kohli checks his drive and chips it to the left of Jamieson. Jamieson sticks out his left hand in his followthrough but the ball doesn't stick.<strong> Will go down as a dropped chance</strong>"

"on a length, threatens to angle in but swings away outside off, Iyer watches it through to Latham"
"back of a length and around off, Iyer hangs back and dabs a single down to deep third man"
"Kohli shimmies down the track, then shimmies across to work a single into the leg side"

"dug in short and outside off, Kohli swivels back and crunches another one. Pulled up and over midwicket for his first boundary"
"on a length and outside off, thickly edged to deep third man"
"on a length and nipping in as Kohli falls over the flick. Kohli has inside-edged it onto the pad, so Latham decides against a review. Height was also an issue. Replays suggest there was no bat involved, ricocheted onto back pad off the front pad. The tracker returns umpire's call on middle"
"even fuller and outside off, driven down the ground"
"on the hips, tucked around the corner for one"
"<strong>now, it's Southee's turn to breach the defences of Kohli</strong>. Southee goes wide of the crease and brings this full ball back into Kohli after having tested the captain with a surfeit of awayswingers. The batsman is opened up and falls over the flick. Hits the middle and leg stumps. Just like that NZ's 273 for 8 looks a whole lot bigger now"
"back of a length and angling into the hips, clipped wide of short midwicket"
"inducker from Southee, inside-edged onto the pad"
"full on off stump, he taps it back to the bowler"
"a very cautious block, Iyer wary of the pitched up ball straightening to take his edge. Jamieson's control has been very impressive. And for a guy over 2m tall, his ability to consistently attack the stumps is also really cool"
"<b>gloooooorious shot!</b>. Nothing tentative about this as Iyer pitches up the fuller ball and extends the arms, a lofted drive over mid-off with all the class he possesses"

stays back to a pretty full ball on off stump and blocks it
allows the back of a length ball to come to him and guides it to point
turns a fuller delivery at the stumps down to fine leg
defends the inswinging ball in line with the stumps
"<b>appeal from the bowler for caught behind</b>. He wants something for this jaffa, and it really is a jaffa. Goes wide of the crease for a length ball that pitches in line with the stumps, makes the batsman play, and beats the outside edge"
drills it down the ground! A touch too full and perfectly primed for the drive and Iyer does not hold back. Outstanding shot. The confidence he has to wait for balls in his area sets him apart from other rookie Indian batsmen

"<b>tiiiiight leave</b>. It's another bouncer from Jamieson, this one constantly coming into the right-hander. Iyer though drops his wrists and sways away very athletically to avoid being hit"
"ends with another short ball which, again, Iyer doesn't bother with"
covers the line of a gentle outswinger and steers it to point
"<b>wrong ball to cut</b>! There is zero room available. It's not even that short. But Rahul really is in such glorious form and sometimes players in that zone manufacture shots. Here he takes it a touch too far, getting only an inside edge back onto the stumps"

opens the face to steer a good length ball to point

"quick single to point, Iyer making sure he places the ball in front of point"
works a short ball on leg stump down to long leg
turns a good length ball through midwicket
"very sensible work from Jadhav, allowing the back of a length ball to come to him and dinking it into vacant square leg"
"slips under the bouncer - yep, CdG bowls them too"
<b>shoooooooot</b>! He really is so good at hitting down the ground! Makes a little room to the leg side so he has a free swing and then basically bullies a perfectly good length ball over the long-off boundary.
"kicks up off the pitch, but Jadhav deals with it well enough, dabbing to backward point"
steers a good length ball outside off to backward point
nudges a full ball on off stump to midwicket
keeps the bat face straight to deal with a full ball on off stump
"<b>pops it to cover</b>! The move to bring back Southee works! The pressure NZ have been putting shows. And Jadhav, having looked capable enough to block the good ones and hit the bad ones, goes after the wrong ball - not quite a half-volley to be playing such booming drives - and presents a simple catch. Cross eamer from Southee, which explains the ball hitting higher up on the bat"
is almost drawn into poking at a back of a length ball that nips away from him
"full and outside off, blocks"
"good length, outside off, no shot"
"<b>that is unreal</B>! No, actually, it's been done millions of times before here, by Martin Guptill, who takes length balls for a ride over mid-on better than virtually anyone else at this ground. Well now he's got competition"

"<b>ripper</b>! He definitely looks red in the face, the effort this is taking out of him quite visible. Actually grimaces after hitting the deck and making the ball move past Jadeja's defensive bat"
"full and outside off, steers it to cover"
"<b>would have been run-out</b> but Guptill, having leapt to his left, full stretch to grab the ball, is completely off balance as he flicks a throw to the strikers end. Iyer thought he'd got the gap after playing the cut shot, but nope... Jadeja didn't want the run. He had his hand up saying no, but then seeing Iyer not stopping, he eventually had to commit"

blocks a shortish delivery outside off to mid-off
defends a fuller ball on off stump to cover
"full and outside off, tempting the drive on the up, Jadeja isn't interested"
"<b>beaten</B> after stepping down the track, his frustrations clear. Jadeja is primed. He doesn't like these dot balls. He's feeling the pressure and he nearly buckles to it as Southee keeps hitting away in the corridor outside off"
<b>cracks it away over the slips</b>. A tiny bit short and wide from the bowler which allows Jadeja to throw his bat
"defends a good length ball to point and that's the end of a very brave effort from Tim Southee. It's said he's ill and he wasn't even set to play this game. And now as he walks back, every single one of his team-mates running up to him and patting him on the back. Latham, the captain, Taylor, Guptill, Neesham, Chapman, Jamieson... and finally off he disappears behind the sightscreen for some well deserved rest"
steers it to backward point
runs a good length ball outside off to deep third man
"<b>risky single</b>, but Jadeja is seriously quick and he commits to the single to mid-off immediately. Jamieson is a touch slow to get to the ball and that gives enough time for the run to be taken"

rises up off his toes to knock the shortish ball down the pitch
"back of a length and outside off, guides it down to deep third man"
"<b>inside edge</b>! Jadeja still benefits from a slight misjudgment, driving at a ball that nips back into him off the pitch. Goes through the gap between bat and pad, just about missing the stumps"
"<b>lovely running</B>. He doesn't even hit the ball, going off the pad as he tries to flick, but since it goes off the pad and into the vacant square leg region, he knows contact is soft and he can push for the second before the keeper can get to it"
the bouncer strays way too high and doesn't even come down for the keeper to have a chance
rises up to deal with a short ball coming up over his waist and eases it to cover point
"excellent timing, this time he's ready for the little bit of inswing, flicking the ball through midwicket."

"<b>very very deft to bring up another impressive fifty</B>! The ball is only a shade outside off, but he knows if he can get it fine enough, he'll have an easy boundary to third man. Outstanding clarity under pressure"
"<b>caught behind</b>! Iyer's gone! Are India gone as well? It's strange to see Iyer play such a manufactured shot. He's clearing his front leg looking to cut a ball right off the top of middle stump. And as good as he is on the cut shot, this is just not on. It's not short enough. He doesn't have the room. Ends up getting a healthy nick through to the keeper"

"good length on off stump, defends"
lifts a stray ball on the pads over midwicket

"shortish and outside off, attached with plenty of width. Thakur scythes a cut to the left of short cover and right of sweeper cover"
"driven straight of mid-on. A bit too full from Neesham, Thakur shows the full face of the bat and punches a drive on the up"
"dug in short and outside off, Thakur sits back and controls a hook to deep square, and that's drinks"
"...and de Grandhomme nips one through the gate of Thakur. Knocks back the off stump. Good length, swerves back in from outside off, Thakur drives from the crease, and is beaten on the inside edge. NZ three away from wrapping up the series"
