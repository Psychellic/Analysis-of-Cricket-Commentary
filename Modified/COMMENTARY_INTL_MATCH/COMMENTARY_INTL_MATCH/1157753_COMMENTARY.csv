dabs this from the crease into the off side.
leg-stump half-volley and Brathwaite's balance is superb as he flicks this to the square leg boundary. Not much swing here either. This is just a delicious delivery for any batsman to miss out. Got to do better than that in the first over.

"induces the edge as Powell jabs this with hard hands, beats gully and races to the third man boundary. Good effort by Prithvi Shaw, gave it chase right till the end and then put out a dive just as it was about to cross the boundary. Couldn't pull it back though."
"straightens off the seam, defended to mid-on"
"flashes and this just eludes backward point. Prithvi needed to be seven feet tall to try and have a chance at taking that. <strong>As Shardul completed his run-up, he was hobbling too</strong>. May have turned his ankle, or so it looked like. He isn't looking very comfortable. Let's hope he's okay. Something to do with his landing, possibly. Physio Patrick Farhart is out to attend to him immediately."

"what have you done, Powell? This is clever bowling from Ashwin, but you've got to say Powell has given his wicket away on a platter.

"<b> doesn't carry to Rahane at slip again! </b> There's no fizz on the delivery, just drifts across. Brathwaite jabbed at it to get the thick edge."
"beautiful delivery from Kuldeep. This is the sidespin, plenty of revs. Lands on a length on off and spins back in to beat the inside edge. So the only question then is if this would've gone on to miss the stumps. Even just clipping is fine because the onfield decision is out. Hawkeye shows this would've hit middle and off, and West Indies have not just lost their most solid batsman but also a review. A wicket well deserved for Kuldeep."

firm drive but can't pick the gap. Straight to cover
"fired in full and flat, driven to mid-on"

"rocks back and punches this into the gap at extra cover. Once he picked the gap inside the ring, there was no stopping that. Hetmyer picked the length early and made room to create width."

"just a gentle forward press as he laces this length delivery into the gap between cover and mid-off. Superb timing, even better placement. Very nice from Hope, leaning into the shot, weight fully forward and all"
"once again Umesh's skid beats him for pace, but Hope his hit above the knee roll. Also the angle - sliding into middle from wide of the crease - seems a little exaggerated, and hawkeye shows this would've crashed into leg stump. No time is a good time to lose a wicket, last over before lunch even more so. Hope will be mighty disappointed, but this wicket was coming, Umesh was getting it to veer back in and kept troubling the batsman around the front pad with late movement. Hope has thrown it away after looking extremely solid."

"full and straight, Ambris shuffles across off a touch, and a whirl of those wrists sends the ball away behind square on the leg side. Fine way to get off the mark"
"What have you done, Hetmyer? He does not read the variation - wrong'un - and simply pads up to it and wears it on his front pad, thinking it was Kuldeep's stock ball that would have broke away from him. Impact may have been outside off (actually ball-tracking returns umpire's call) but it does not matter, as the batsman did not offer a shot. It would have crashed into middle.

Full, starts outside off, and reverse-swings back in to catch him on the knee-roll on the front pad. No inside edge or glove. Dowrich plays around his front pad, but is this nipping past leg stump? The tracker suggests it would hit leg stump. So, Umesh returns and provides India with the breakthrough"

...which means a massive gap in the cordon. Which means a boundary opportunity. Shaw takes it. It's a yorker length delivery just outside off. He crouches a touch and guides it through there
full ball slanted into the pads. Stands tall and flicks it to deep square's left
length ball pushed down leg side and past the bat as he looks to flick this
length and in at middle stump. Defended with the full face off the front foot

"short and wide outside off, waits for it to go a touch behind him before cutting to sweeper's left"
"length and in at leg stump, tapped to midwicket off the front foot"
<b>full toss</b> drilled wide of mid-off. That's like a throwdown. On off stump and he puts it away easily
"<b>driven straight to extra cover!</b> That's nicely done from Warrican. Gets it to loop and dip this time, at a length outside off and that can often do the trick against aggressive batsmen. Shaw will look to drive in this form. This time, he won't get to the pitch and there's marginal movement away from him off the pitch. He's far away enough as it rises on him to not be able to control that. West Indies will be grateful, he was beginning to run away again"

full toss in at middle and leg at 146kph. Mistimed punch to mid-on
yorker in at middle and leg stump. Jams the bat down on this and it pings to mid-off off the leading edge
yorker length and in at the toes. Clips it to deep square's left...and his throw at the non-striker's end is not gathered cleanly. Kohli will get a second
"length ball wide outside off, flails at this on the up and gets a thick outside edge to backward point's left. He dives to stop that from going to the boundary"
"<b>thin edge</b> as he hangs the bat outside off and it carries low to Hamilton behind the stumps. It's a straight ball at a length outside off - no movement really. Pujara normally lets those go. This time he jabs at it and with Gabriel's pace, he's caught inside the line of the ball. A loose stroke and suddenly West Indies have the momentum"
"length on off stump, punched to extra cover off the front foot"
<b>misfield</b> at mid-on and it's four. Full and flat at middle stump from Warrican and Kohli brings out the trademark whip-drive with an angled bat to that fielder's left. It's Bishoo and his dive is slow-mo

<b>thick outside edge</b> as he chases wide outside off. Gabriel gets it on a length this time with a lot of width. Point is on the fence so Rahane survives. Wasn't to the pitch of that
"<b>a mix-up and Rahane is lunging at the non-striker's end.</b> It's a full ball on leg stump. Stays in the crease and flicks it through square leg. That is Rahane's call for the second run and he takes a couple of big strides down. Kohli sends him back. A good call in the end, that would've been tight. Warrican doesn't collect the throw behind the stumps either"

"<strong>extra bounce does the trick, excellent from Holder. </strong>Rahane has jabbed this straight to gully and he has to walk back without a century. He was looking to play freely so instinctively went to play this delivery which hit a spot and took off. Rahane got the shoulder of the bat and lobbed straight to Shai Hope. End of a wonderful innings nonetheless. West Indies have the start they were looking for."

Century in the previous game, zero here. Oh, cricket is a leveler, isn't it?"
"shortens his length, Ashwin sways away from the delivery."

"out in the 90s again! This is an excellent catch by Shimron Hetmyer at cover point. Bounce off the deck from Gabriel, there was width  but not so much that Pant could freely cut. He looked to punch this instead, hit it very well but Hetmyer threw himself to his right and plucked an excellent catch.  The ball was travelling and it needed a very, very good effort to not only get to the ball but also hold on. He fumbled a bit, but luckily for him, the ball got stuck between his hands and ear, then recovered well to complete the catch."

"has he got him? There's a big appeal, not given. Fizz and turn for Jadeja. Ian Gould not convinced, Holder doesn't seem worried. India have reviewed. Holder prods forward to defend but is beaten by the bite off the pitch. Did it kiss the edge or not is the question. Yes, ultraedge confirms a spike, so there was a very faint nick, enough for the third umpire to over-turn the onfield decision and Holder is gone! Pant fumbled just a bit but managed to hold on."

Hit on the flap alright, but he was so far back inside the crease that the ball didn't have much distance to travel. Also the leg stump was visible at the point of impact. As far as decisions go, it can't get more straightforward than that."
