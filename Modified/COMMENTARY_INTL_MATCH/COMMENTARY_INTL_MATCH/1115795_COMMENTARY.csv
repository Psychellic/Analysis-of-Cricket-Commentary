"cutter pitched short-ish outside off, tapped with soft hands towards point and this time the call for the run is early"

good length on middle stump and cramping Williams for room. Tucked off his waist to the fielder positioned at midwicket

"low full toss wide outside off, drags his slog towards the fielder at cow corner this time"

"yorker on leg stump to end the over, dug away to mid off and they race off for a single"
"short and wide outside off, way too short and the umpire does not think it's a wide. Williams had backed away to play the upper cut over the keeper but can't get bat to ball. Tough decision"

"short and into the chest, pulled uppishly towards deep square"

"<b>caught behind!</b> No room to play the cut but he takes it on. Holder bowls in the channel from around the wicket, and rolls his fingers on this one. Gets some grip and lift, and that's enough to take the edge as Nicholls goes after it"
"short ball in the corridor, defended to point off the back foot"
"back of a length outside off, toe-ends it as he looks to punch through the off side"

"swings through the line to hammer this past the non-striker. First boundary in ODIs, and it's stylish. Drags this length ball from outside off and keeps his shape as he punches it to beat mid-on"
nicely timed. Clips this length ball off his pads and to deep square's left

"low full toss on the pads, follows it with his hands and flicks it to deep square's left"
<b>floors him</b> as he follows him down leg side with a bouncer. Nicely directed and he has to bring out his best Matrix impression to sway away from this. Falls down in the process
"full at middle stump, leans in and clips it wide of mid-on"
<b>a wide ball</b> and fantasy cricket players all over the world are going 'noooo'. Not New Zealand. Length ball fired down leg side gives them the win
