"slides it into leg stump, hoping to prevent the big swing of  Watson's bat and succeeds in hitting the pad"
flicks the ball angling into leg stump through midwicket
"full on middle, Shehzad uses his wrists and sends it away through the wide long-on region"
"gets down to sweep, but the ball comes on a little slower than he expects and he's beaten"
"fires it into the pads, Watson works it to long-on"
"backs away and looks in prime position to smash the full toss through the covers, but he picks out the fielder"
"back of a length and outside off, crashes it through point. Pace on the ball immediately makes the batsman more comfortable"
skiddy delivery sneaking past Watson's flick and gliding off his pads to long leg
"fullish on off stump, defends"
"short and outside off, pulls to mid-on"
"fullish and outside off, Watson blocks into the off side, looking for a single, but Ashraf races to his left in time"
pushes it to mid-on
"moves to leg, knowing Patel is arrowing them into the pads, but even then he's only able to dink it towards square leg"
"<b>bowled im</b>! It's Patel's line. That constricting line, refusing to give the batsman any room. It makes Shehzad jump outside leg stump. To try something different. But the ball keeps following him. Pitched up and refusing him the chance to free the arms. So he tries a flick but the ball deflects off his pads and onto the stumps"
flicks the full delivery to midwicket
"over mid-off! Beautiful shot from the left-hander. He clears his front leg, gets under the flight delivery and uses the straight bat to devastating effect"
drives to the left of mid-off
lofts it down the ground! You can't bowl length in T20. Not to Shane Watson who just winds those big shoulders up and goes BANG!
flicks the ball past mid-off
"picks up the short ball and pummels it to the midwicket boundary. The front-foot pull, a great staple of Australian cricket"
gets out the quick and short delivery and it's onto Watson well before the pull shot is ready this time. Strikes him on the gut
"carves it behind point! Makes a little room outside leg, watches the short and wide delivery all the way onto his bat, and that time spent waiting for the ball helps him place it perfectly. Splendid cricket"
"good effort down on the third man boundary, Patel running to his left and diving to stop another crispy timed cut shot from Watson. He looks in the mood!"
flicks a full one on the pads to fine leg. A couple of yards to either side and this would've been a boundary too
starts with one a little too far outside the off stump. Russow lets it go
swings a length ball out to the midwicket boundary. Raees missed his line last ball. Misses his length  this ball. Punished both times
"taken at mid-off! The ball is there to hit but it's a little too wide outside off, making him reach out, making him lose his shape just a bit. The ball comes off the toe-end, has no power and the Islamabad captain takes it cleanly"
"full on off stump, defends"
"stands tall, letting the back of a length ball travel across him and then punches to point"
shuffles back in his crease and flicks a shortish delivery on middle through midwicket
"<b>dropped</b> by the bowler!  Watson muscles a half-volley back at Raees and it's at him before he can get his hands up in time. They need to be around his ears. They are, eventually, but the ball pops out"
"wide yorker, Akmal slices it to point"
picks up the length ball and launches it over midwicket. Perfectly balanced. Beautifully hit
races down the track and lifts the suddenly half-volley over mid-off's head. Umar Akmal on song
"full on middle and leg, turns it to long-on"
"taps it to the right of the bowler - who is running in from round the wicket. Parnell reaches to his right, misfields, and allows a single"
walks across his stumps and sends an almighty strike over the square leg boundary. Sublime hitting from the in-form Akmal
"tosses it up outside off, Watson eases it through the covers to bring up Quetta's fifty"
"picks up the short ball so quickly, leaping back and away from the line of it so that he can cut it strongly through point. Nearly goes all the way"
thunders out of his crease and launches the full ball on leg stump over long-on. Exhilarating stuff
"flighted on and around off stump, Akmal taps it into the covers"
"good length on middle and leg, Watson sweeps to deep square leg"
"slices the ball through point. It's only a tiny bit short but Akmal's footwork is quick and decisive, going deep in his crease to get his runs"
"flatter and quicker on middle, from round the wicket. Watson is backing away to cut but the ball ends up back with the bowler"
sweeps the length ball on middle and leg to deep square leg
"fuller delivery outside off, defends to cover"
"steps out and ends up yorking himself on leg stump, As a result he's only able to hit it along the ground to long-on"
"short ball on middle, he pulls to deep square leg"
"down the track again, making a full delivery into a full toss, but he ends up finding cover"
"googly, pitching outside off and turning into Watson, who is backing away to cut to point"
"short and wide, Watson slaps it to long-off"
"that's an outstanding shot. He's making room as he charges out. The bowler sees it and tosses it out wide, hoping to beat him, hoping to stump him. But somehow, Akmal reaches that little bit extra and hammers it over cover"
cuts to point
"advances again, making Shadab go for the quicker ball, which ends up a full toss and it hits him on the thigh"
""
"shortish and outside off, cuts to point"
"sits up to be walloped and Watson obliges, swivelling on his back foot and pulling like a boss"
""
"shortish and outside off, Watson is trying to glide it to third man, but ends up inside edging to the keeper"
"back of a length and outside off, Watson pushes it to point"
"<B>bowled im but it doesn't count!</b>. Sami has his head in his hands. A moment earlier they were aloft, celebrating a drag on, Watson looking to wallop the full ball but miscuing it badly. The stumps are broken but it is off a no-ball because while Sami's was delivering it, he had flicked the bails off at his own end before flicking them off at the other one"
crashes it to the left of mid-off! Blistering strike. He stays leg side of the ball - which is length and has enough room to free the arms. Poor bowling. Great batting though
"back of a length and outside off, he cuts it behind point and away she goes once more to the boundary"
"shortish and outside off, he cuts to deep point"
"googly, looking for the top of off stump, but Akmal is able to cut it to point"

"taken, by the bowler himself, running well past where mid-off would've been standing. Great effort and a timely wicket for Islamabad. Akmal was taking them apart but here, the change-up bowler, Delport is able to get him to miscue a loft. Instead of carrying straight over the ropes straight down the ground it goes straight up in the air. Delport tracks it as he runs full tilt back and takes it with both hands"
pulls a short ball to deep midwicket
"stays low, expecting these short, skiddy darts, and pulls with great power to the deep square leg boundary"
"shortish and outside off, cuts through point"
"full and outside off, defends through point"
tosses it up outside off and it is just about perfect for Watson who gets down on one knee and slog sweeps into the stands behind midwicket
nudges a shortish delivery through midwicket and pinches a couple
"googly, on a length and turning into him, Watson reads it off the pitch and flicks it through midwicket"
"full and outside off, he drives to long-off"
"short and outside off, pulls to deep midwicket"
"backs away outside off to flay a pitched up delivery down the ground and brings up his fifty. A well-paced innings, staying quiet when Akmal was going great, but now he's off and running himself"

"full and outside off, drives to long-off"
looks to pull but the ball sneaks below the bat - somehow misses the stumps - and runs away for byes!
launches the half-volley outside off into the stands behind long-off. Monster strike!

"slower short ball - Watson only picks it up midway through his pull shot, adjusting his backlift and getting a single through midwicket"

"back of a length and outside off, he pulls to deep square leg"
slogs the length ball to mid-on
too far down leg and Watson just helps it over fine leg. This is vintage hitting
