thumped on the thigh pad - good evidence of bounce already
nudged out to backward square leg to get this innings up and running
"outside off, a bit of early swing in evidence"
"once more, probing away in the corridor"
"line and length outside off, but Markram won't be drawn"

"a hard-handed poke outside off, getting the feel of bat on ball"
"much fuller length, speared into the toes and deflected down the leg side"
"good line and length, very tight to off stump and full too. A well-judged leave from Markram"
three slips in place as Markram leaves alone once more
"very full length, a bit of late in-dip into the toes. Negotiated with a late adjustment"
"dangled outside off on a full length, Markram contemplates the drive but thinks better of it, letting a leaping delivery pass harmlessly through to the keeper"

through to the keeper as Elgar continues to line it up and let it go

"wider on the crease, angled back into the bat, blocked back down the pitch"
"outside off, through to the keeper with good carry"
"<strong>edged and gone!</strong> Markram is trapped on the crease by a beautiful length, angling back into the right-hander. Caught in two minds, and he pushed with hard hands as a last resort. Smith at second slip did superbly, diving low to his left to scoop up the chance!"

"lifting length outside off, probing work from Starc, as Elgar strides forward before leaving alone"

"leaning forward, head over the ball, defended solidly outside off stump"

"full and inswinging, driven with a bit of fat inside-edge, out through midwicket"
"lined up on off stump, and blocked back down the pitch"

"outside off, Elgar flinches as the ball fizzes by, but manages to haul his bat out of harm's way"
"over the wicket, turning down the leg side, and helped on its way"
"lots of air, dipping outside off and biting towards the stumps. Blocked"
<B>flicked in the air</B> but just short of midwicket! Amla was across through the line too soon and nearly scuffed his stroke
"too short, too wide, faster and flatter and firmly slapped behind point. Warner does well to dive and intercept on the rope"
"pushed onto the back foot, driven on the up to cover"
"full length, defended under the batsman's nose, and that will be <B>drinks</B>"
"oof, that's a beauty from Cummins on the resumption, a touch short and wheeching past the outside edge as Amla prods at it off the back foot"

"straighter line, defended to the leg side"

"short, huffing and puffing as it flies through to the keeper, Elgar stays in his house"
"full, 143kph and wanged down in the channel of Blink 182, there's an appeal as Elgar fiddles at it... but I think the sound was bat hitting ground, Starc not interested and neither was Nigel Llong"

"speared into the pads, Elgar is comfortable dealing with those and clips a single behind square"
hammers the bouncer but it's leg side and Amla ducks it without fuss

"length, 137kph and thudding into the pads... but it pitched outside leg and they amble the extra"
"digs in the bouncer, it's a bit too high to trouble Elgar as he shuffles into line and ducks"
fired down and left alone again

"angled in from wide on the crease, Amla works around the front pad to tuck the ball into the leg side"
another yawning leave outside off stump
"banged in short, and <B>Amla holes out to fine leg!</B> You can't quite say that was coming, but Hazlewood has earned that, he's found a threatening line, a consistent length, and the surprise bouncer does the trick. Amla attempts to flap it off his eyebrows, but it gets big on him, takes a top-edge, and loops to Cummins!"
"striding out to meet the full length, firmly drilled to mid-off"
"fully forward, head over the ball"
"onto the front foot, pushed to cover"
stabbed out to cover with shuffling feet

"another sharp lifter, attacking the arm-pit and fenced down to the leg side"

"big stride, bigger leave outside off"
"outside off, climbing through to the keeper once more"
"pushed back onto the stumps, worked with a roll of the wrists into the leg side"
"outside off, deflected to the covers"
"cramped for room on an ambitious back-foot drive, but middles it well enough to be fielded at cover. AB has a mood on, sit tight!"
"<strong>punched through long-off!</strong> That's Elgar's slot, tight line on off stump, but just the right length for him to spring forward like a hungry hippo and snaffle the ball through the line!"
"banged in short, clips the helmet, loops to the fielder ... half an appeal but there was no bat in that. Quality bowling though! Elgar was comprehensively beaten on the pull"
"on the back foot, and worked to the leg side"
"zipping over the shoulder, lots of heat in that delivery but less bounce. Elgar turns turtle"
down the leg side
solidly onto the front foot to defend
nip from a full length. AB removes his bottom hand in a statement of surprise
"wallop! Short and wide, and de Villiers climbs over the covers with alacrity! A pistol crack of willow and a followthrough reminiscent of Darren Gough at Sydney in 1994-95! He's enjoying himself out there..."
tighter and fuller. Solid defence on off stump
"outside off, no stroke offered"

"outside off, clobbered off the back foot, in the air for a while, but through the gap at gully!"
nurdled to the leg side. Sharp running
"wide outside off, a big leave"
"yorker length, but outside off, stabbed back down the wicket"
"<B>spawny!</B> A fine delivery, climbing off the deck and nipping off the seam, de Villiers played with loose hands, stabbing at the ball as it climbed past him, and straight through the gap at third slip!"

"flighted, straightening and tapped down"

"back of a length, de Villiers straightens up and taps to extra cover from the crease"
"whipped this time, Elgar on the charge again! Gets to the pitch and then whips the ball through midwicket with bottom-handed gusto"

floated up as Elgar comes across on off
"now he goes downtown, smoked all the way! Lyon shakes his head in frustration, he gave the ball some air and Elgar grabbed it, heaved the ball over the rope at long-on!"
"tossed up, presses forward to block on off stump"
"quicker delivery, this time he drops back and shows it a straight bat"
"now AB cashes in, short from Starc and he clips it off his hips with timing and precision"
"oh, that's even more dismissive, a wafted flip high over midwicket and away! The ball didn't get up that high and de Villiers just whacked it merrily for another boundary!"
"short of a length and worked off the hip, into a gap for a couple more - <b>SA cross 150 in the process</b>"

"a bottom-handed biff into the leg-side, very Gooch-esque in fact, solid base and a big wind-up, but can't beat mid-on"
"outside off from round the wicket, a hop across the crease to leave alone"
through to the keeper with extra nip off a good length
"very full, wide line, a bottom-hand flog out to point. Very Graeme Smith. All the Grae(ha)mes are coming to the party now"
poked to cover off the back foot
"<strong>in the air and gone!</strong> Newlands is stunned into semi-silence... a full length, AB strides onto the front foot and rather yorks what should have been a half-volley, getting through the shot too soon and rifling a simple chance to Warner at mid-off. What a let-down for the crowd, what a let-off for Australia!"
"outside off, a hint of outswing, fenced to the off side"
"a horrible leg-side swinger, no stopping that for Paine, and no wide either. Very harsh..."
"tailing into the left-hander, there's suddenly reverse swing on display"
flicked behind square to get off the mark
"picks the gap in the covers with a well-timed punch, avoiding point but inside of cover. Nurdling of the highest order"
"up onto the toes, and that's excellently played, down through third man, turning what looked like an awkward lifter into an excellent run-scoring deflection. Good dive on the rope to save the boundary"
"very full, speared into the toes"
"lifting off the deck, thumps the splice as Faf takes his bottom hand off the blade to control the defensive block"
"fuller length, attacking the base of the stumps, and blocked"
""
"short, ducked"
"wide on the crease, and that's a tremendous drive, leaning into the angle and timing it sweetly to the rope"
"standing tall in defence, blocked back down the pitch"
"round the wicket, tossed up, dipping into the crease. Blocked"
"shaping into the pads, tucked to the leg side"
"big stride, lots of air from Lyon, luring the big shot, but nothing doing yet"
"blocked on the front foot, just dangling it out there..."
"a bit of turn from a good length, Elgar stretches forward"
"on the back foot, nudged off the hip"
"banged in short, no stroke offered"
"defended on the back foot, right behind the line"
width outside off as Cummins bangs on in short. No stroke this time
"battered hard into the covers, that was creamed, but Warner stood firm to intercept"
"outside off, and through to the keeper"
"<B>edged and Faf falls!</B> Another fine delivery from Cummins, nipping away late and du Plessis' bat was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, drawn into a stroke then unable to resist when the ball was no longer where he had lined it up. A sharp high take at third slip, and suddenly Australia are back in the contest"
leaning forward to block
pushed to the off side
"round the wicket, looped into the blockhole, and defended"
"squared up in defence, very watchful now that his flowing partners have perished"
"driven, a touch hard-handedly, into the covers. Gets away with it"
solidly onto the front foot. Blocked once more
"ooh, lovely line. Welcome to the crease Temba! Full length, nip off the seam, beats the edge"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
pushed firmly out to cover
hops across the crease to work a single to fine leg
"sharp once again, lifting past the outside edge as Elgar is made to hop"
"left alone on a wider, fuller line"
"stretching onto the front foot, turned to the leg side"
"rotating the wrists on impact, tucked to the leg side"
"on the back foot, nurdled to square leg"
"blocked on the back foot, outside off"
"a turn of the wrists, and a single to mid-on"
tossed up and blocked on the line of middle and off
"outside off, climbing through to the keeper"
"lovely bowling, ghosting past the edge as the ball angles in and holds its line. Bavuma does well not to touch that one"
"<B>brilliant from Cummins!</B> Pushes Bavuma back into his crease, finds some extra nip on a good length, and a squared-up batsman sends a simple edge into Smith's bread-basket at second slip!"
"round the wicket, fired in the channel outside off and de Kock slaps a couple through point to get going"
"back of a length, 137kph and rising through as he throws the hands up"
"coming back in, but the line was wide enough for QdK to leave alone"
"nervous moment around the ground, Elgar skipping down and then driving a bump ball back into the hands of Lyon - no c&b this time"
"flat on off, shows it a dogged straight bat"
angled in and turned to the leg side
tossed up and Elgar makes a bit of room to steer one in front of square
"pushed through on off stump, de Kock leans on a block"
"quicker ball, played from the crease, lined up well enough in defence"
"fullish around off, Elgar takes his bottom hand off as he defends"
"shorter length, pushed square from the crease"
"dug in and Elgar has to ride the bounce, keeps it down as the ball flies towards the cordon"
"fullish, 139kph in the channel, Elgar watches it impassively by"
"goes over the wicket now, dangles the carrot - but Elgar the mule won't be biting"
"snorting short ball, smell the leather... but Elgar nods it through and sets his jaw for further crease occupancy"
"tossed up on off, the ball skids on as de Kock starts to open the face"
shuffles into line and blocks
"ooh, that's taken off, leaping past the shoulder of the bat from a length, turning away from de Kock as he hung back and was beaten"
"pushed through around off stump, steered into the off side"
comes forward and punches down the ground
flat and zipping on as de Kock shows it a straight bat in defence
"round the wicket, banged in short and a touch leg side, Elgar flinches out of the way"
"back of a length, 137kph and clipped towards mid-on form the crease"
"flung very full and wide in the channel, Elgar doesn't sniff at it"
"pitched up around off stump, driven to mid-on and he quickly turns around after thinking about the one"
tapped through the off side for one
"short ball, de Kock swishes at a pull - <b>but only manages a thin nick to the keeper!</b> Another old-ball breakthrough for Australia, another to Pat Cummins, whose four-wicket salvo has left SA thoroughly winded here! De Kock was tempted by the gap at square leg but was perhaps done for pace, tickled an under edge through to Paine"
"angled in from round the wicket, defended on the stumps"
turned down to the leg side
tossed up and pushed in front of square on the off side
uses the feet and drives one down the ground
"over the wicket to Big Vern, who waits and works the ball with the spin to get off the mark behind square"
"back around, sliding on with the arm and skimmed to backward square leg"
"over the wicket, holding its line outside off as Philander hangs back"
"yowzer, that's a nifty nut, reversing away as Philander feels for it and is beaten in the channel!"
"length outside off, manages to cover the line this time and jab square"
short and climbing as Vern watches it through
"dug in, 140kph and this time Philander isn't going to sit and watch, raises the bat in anger and hoicks four over square leg - pounded"
"another bumper, this time he lets it go outside off"
"tossed up on off, Elgar closes the front door"
pushed through and tapped back down the track
leans on a front-foot block
"tossed up around the line of off, Elgar smothers the ball"
a touch quicker and he drops the bottom hand off the bat as he jabs it away
"this bounces a touch more, hits the splice of the bat as Elgar hangs back"
"good length in the corridor, left alone"
"touch short, Philander sits back and clubs a cut for one to the sweeper"
"full, just a touch overpitched and Elgar eases it down the ground, lovely timing and Josh Hazlewood has to put in a full-length dive to drag it back from the rope"
comes across and shows the ball a straight bat
"wicket-to-wicket from MMarsh, turned to the leg side"
"good length, Elgar thrusts forward and keeps it out once more"
"flighted, played with the spin to leg"
tossed up and defended coming across on off stump
"big turn fro Lyon, this rags back in and thuds into the pads... in actually fact, that flew off the inside edge, but Philander's body got in the way to prevent it carrying to short leg"
tapped down into the off side
floated up and turned to leg on the back foot
"gives this a bit more air, Philander props forward and dead-bats is securely"
"Marsh probing away, stump-to-stump, defended"
"keeper still up to the stumps, Elgar camps in the crease and defends"
"goes a touch straighter, jabbed back towards the bowler"
"length outside off, left alone"
"oof, 129kph but it pops off a length, past the shoulder of the bat and into the gloves as he feels for it"
angled in on the stumps and worked to mid-on
"this goes on with the arm and takes the outside edge, but Philander manages to run it wide of slip for a couple"
"floated up around off stump, defended"
tossed up and defended on off stump
"flighted, pushed back down the track"
"lobbed up full around middle and off, Philander leans on it"
"full length, Philander opens his shoulders but can only bunt the ball to mid-on"
"angled in towards off stump, Elgar prods it into a gap for one"
"jabbed down towards point, Philander wants a quick one but a knackered Dean Elgar sends him back in time"
"and that's why they're sticking with the old ball! <b>Reverse swing does for Philander</b>, just enough movement away to draw the edge - Mitch Marsh bags a wicket, SA continue to wobble towards the close"
"length ball, straightening a touch and it jumps to hit the splice and loop short of gully!"
shuffles across and tickles one into the leg side
"round the wicket, dobbed on off and defended"
"short ball, Maharaj swipes skittishly across the line and <b>top-edges clear of the keeper and slips running back!</b> Doesn't quite go all the way, but he survives"
"thudding into the pads, they go up for lbw now! But this hadn't quite straigtened enough"
"length around off, Maharaj prods it away"
"pitched up, Maharaj lines it up and dinks the ball towards mid-on"
"oh dear, that's a shocker... SA lose their eighth as <b>Maharaj flubs a catch to extra cover!</b> Brain scrambled by reverse swing and pace? Maybe... Hands hard and foot nowhere near the ball? Certainly. That's a rubbish way to go any time, but particularly when you're team is on the slide and hanging on for the close with a centurion at the other end"
"Starc greets him with some chin music, steepling bounce as KG nods it through"
"round the wicket, length delivery holding its line on off, defended coming forwards"
touch straighter and he works it fine for a single
"goes full on leg stump, Rabada keeps it out"
"length, 135kph and Rabada plays a correct-looking punch square on the off side"
"full outside off, stroked towards cover as he gets a stride in"
"short and this gets big on KG, who <b>thick-edges the ball just short of slip!</b> Smith dove forward but couldn't get there"
"over the wicket to Elgar, who blocks a length delivery"
pitched up and clipped back past the bowler for one
"pitched up and driven, nicely played by Rabada and he gets a couple through cover"
"full length, again Rabada attempts to thrash the ball through the off side, fails to connect this time"
"length, rising in the channel, steered down towards point"
"yaroo, spanked for four! Rabada absolutely <i>creams</i> a drive past extra cover, those long limbs unfurling like a carnivorous flower"
"Hazlewood finds his length in the channel, round the wicket and nipping away"
"pitched up, met coming forwards with a dab into the covers"
"this climbs off a length, 131kph and it slams the splice of the bat as Elgar lunges forward, the ball diverts through backward square"
"shortish, KG jumps back and blocks towards his toes, the ball bobbles wide of the stumps"
"oof, he takes this on the body, rearing from a length and beating the bat on the inside"
"hits a length around off stump, Rabada lines this one up"
"round the wicket, outside off stump, full length, wide line, left alone"
stabbed into the covers to get the score moving this morning
"tight line, back of a length, hops through to the keeper as Rabada just about avoids playing at the ball"
through to the keeper once more
"good wheels from Cummins, over the wicket now, angling across the left-hander from just back of a length"
"right behind the line to defend this one, as Cummins drops short once more. A good aggressive start to his day's work"
"round the wicket, angling down the leg side, clipped firmly off the hip to fine leg"
"back of a length, tucked to midwicket"
"round the wicket, angling into the pads, flicked square once more. Hazlewood just straying in line a touch"
"<B>banged in short, but the top-edge falls safe!</B> A sharp bouncer, good pace, startling lift, Rabada swings impulsively into the pull but is lucky with his placement"
fully behind the line and punched down the ground
"a swishing bouncer, and that clears everyone! Over Rabada's shoulder as he has another go, and over the keeper's head too!"
"outside off, and through to the keeper on a wide line"
"width and a full length, a touch of late outswing as Elgar stretches for the drive but can't connect"
"stabbed defence, outside off stump. gathered in the covers"
"round the wicket, back of a length, really hitting the bat hard as he pushes for the breakthrough. Elgar gets right behind the line"
"sharp pace again, through to the keeper once more"
pushed to cover again
"banged in short, Rabada doesn't quite commit to a back-foot block, playing down into the crease"
"very full, attacking the stumps, dead-batted back down the pitch and that's a sharp, sneaky single as mid-on swoops round"
"tight to off stump, stabbed out to point and yet another swiftly judged single"
"<b>ooh, nearly!</B> This one jags back in, and loops off the thigh pad out into the cordon. No bat involved but tricksy movement off the deck"
fenced down into the ground off the back foot again.
"on the back foot, and a calmly placed pull behind square to keep the strike"
"<B>top edged but effective!</B> South Africa won't mind that, another bouncer to Rabada, another combative swish across the line, and the keeper has no chance to intercept that!"
"hoisted with a pleasing report of willow, down to backward square. He's standing up for himself this morning. As if that was ever in doubt"
"full length, outside off, poked down into the pitch"
"full once again from round the wicket, another nuggetty stab out to extra cover"
"on the back foot, lining up the angle into the stumps and blocking into the off side"
"<B>wallop!</B> Dismissive thump across the line, another short ball, but Elgar was waiting for it this time on the back foot, cracking it in front of square with a de Villiers flourish! That's his highest Test score against Australia"
"behind the line, pushed to cover"
clipped off the pads out to square leg. This is already a very healthy start for South Africa
"short again, down the leg side, Rabada falls inside the line and wafts another pull to fine leg. The short ball is the preferred option this morning, but I wonder if pitching it up might be worth considering"
"outside off again, slightly fuller, defended"
"very full length, and defended back down the pitch"
right behind the line once more
"fuller length, behind the line, pushed to the off side"
"banged in short, Rabada ducks but leaves his forearm in the firing line, a deflection takes it just out of the reach of Paine's fingertips behind the stumps"
"well bowled, that's a more threatening length, ironically. Fuller, drawing the drive, and beating the edge with late movement"
"too wide this time, and Elgar frees his arms with alacrity! A crashing cut over backward point and away to the rope! South Africa are motoring towards 300, which was their first objective this morning"
punched off the front foot into the covers
"well bowled again, nibbling through to the keeper from outside off"
"top strike! Fuller this time from Hazlewood, but right into the slot for a measured drive through mid-off. Tasty batting"
"another swishing pull, to backward square. Rabada is playing a blinder here, taking on the short ball and backing himself to connect more often than not"
"squeezed defence, into the leg side, hopping into line"
"clipped out to deep midwicket, and up comes the 300. South Africa have righted the wrongs of their afternoon session"
solidly blocked on the back foot
"more pace, whistling through to the keeper. Australia have been good this morning, but South Africa have been better"
"another fizzing bouncer, can't connect with a flinched pull"
"short again, Rabada is pre-empting the bouncer now, and walks inside the line in an attempt to deflect it very fine. Misses out"
"short once more, Rabada ducks without a care in the world"
"fuller length, still a fraction short, but it draws a loose poke as Rabada follows the angle outside off. Better from Australia"
"back of a length once more, and Rabada, with his blood pumping, has another go. Deep backward point in place, and a wide gully"
"short again, outside off. Rabada ducks again"
"poked into the on side, calm and composed"
"banged in short again, outside off, as Rabada drops his hands"
"<B>short, pulled, safe!</B> Rabada is making his own luck with his aggressive intent, I reckon. Another shovelled pull, a spiralling top-edge, but lands safe at fine leg"
"turned inside out this time by a better-directed short ball, aimed right at the ribcage"
bang! That's an awesome bit of biffing! Meeting the fuller length with an utterly out-of-character thump through the line! Holding the pose and dumping the ball right to the brink of the rope
"nip off the deck on a middle-and-leg line, flicks the pad and flies out to point"
"round the wicket, in the slot, a hard-handed drive, <strong>a simple edge to slip! </strong>Well, that was uncomplicated"
"round the wicket, tossed up into the toes, and blocked"
"dumped over long-off! Well, why not! In the slot and slogged high and handsomely!"
"width outside off stump, and left alone"
"edged and gone! A carbon copy of the Rabada dismissal, in the slot for the drive, and tweaking away. Lyon has two in the over, and South Africa's innings is done!"
"sidles in and pitches short, 127kph and Cameron Bancroft fences it down into the leg side, elects not to run"
"touch straight again and worked away through backward square leg, they come back for two"
"nice shape on this, 124kph but it's that ticklish line and length outside off, Bancroft feels for it and gets a low outside edge"
"pushed down the leg side, no swing and the batsman misses with a flick"
"good length around off stump, Bancroft blocks it resolutely"
"touch short again, Philander up above 130kph for the first time, jabbed towards square leg"
"steams in, hits a length at 140kph straight away, blocked towards mid-on"
"yowch! This kicks at David Warner, hanging back in the crease and he <b>takes a blow on the arm</b>, the ball then ricocheting into the body - on comes the physio, that's going to ache come this evening"
"pitched up, inviting the drive and Warner accepts, opens the face a touch and slides a 141kph ball to the rope at deep backward point, easy as you like to get off the mark"
"fullish on the pads, Warner clips the ball fine and wants two... but the fielder keeps them honest"
"touch short of a length around off stump, 139kph and not much swing as yet, Bancroft defends"
"charges in again, over the top of off stump, Bancroft gets his big ol' melon into line and blocks with a straight bat once again"
"couple more for Warner, who covers the movement across him and steers a couple through the off side"
"yoinks, this takes off from a length! Philander finds a mini-trampoline buried in the Newlands surface and sends shocks waves through Warner's bat handle as he jumps to fend it away"
"ooh wee, now he clips the inside edge, Warner not quite forward trying to drive, runs to fine leg"
"back of a length, 131kph and nibbling in, blocked"
"good length, curving a touch out of the hand but Bancroft lines it up well and leaves alone"
"probing away, 128kph on a fourth-stump line, steered down in front of square"
"length ball angled across, and Warner nearly chops on again! Not really the width to cut but he went at it hard, squirted the ball past leg stump"
"angling in, 141kph and defended back down the track"
"excited shouts as Rabada finds the inside edge of the bat, it loops in the air through backward square leg... but there's no one there, Bancroft trots the single"
"too full, rifled to the cover boundary! Warner climbs into a cover drive, low in his stance and using 141kph to his own advantage"
"oh, even better, <b>a murderous scyth past extra cover for four!</b> This wasn't a half-volley but he dispatched it via first-class delivery to the ropes"
"skelped off the pads, <b>three in a row!</b> Morkel gamely gives chase but he can't reel it in, Warner lets his bat do the talking in his battle with Rabada - this could become a proper brawl (within the confines of the Laws, of course!)"
"ooh, beats the outside edge, some distance between bat and ball as Bancroft feels for it"
comes across and defends on off
"pitched up and cracked through the covers, Bancroft finds his groove and sends one on a rail to the fence"
"draws his length back, left alone outside off"
"intriguing tussle this, Bancroft again left poking in the channel, a genuine play and miss"
"yeesh, that's close to the timber! <b>Big inside edge from Bancroft</b> as the ball snakes back between bat and pad, flies <i>just</i> past off stump and away for four!"
"digs the ball in short... and Warner hurls his bat, KABOOM! over fine leg! That has gone <i>miles</i>, high up into the stands - someone is going to have to fetch it!"
"FETCH THAT! <b>Five boundaries in a row for Warner off Rabada!</b> Just a touch of width and he slashes it through backward point, and you can sense KG's temperature rising!"
"<b>bowled hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiim!</b> Rabada lands the decisive blow, up off the canvas and demolishing off stump! This enthralling duel is ended by Rabada slicing through Warner's tentative defence and sending the stump pinwheeling back. An extraordinary innings from Warner, struck on the arm and then responding with a flurry of boundaries before being run through, bowled off stump for the third time in the series"
"pitched up and angled across Uzzie, who can leave"
touch short and jabbed away to the leg side
"good pace, 140-plus kph in the channel outside off"
"gets a touch straight, worked off the pads into a gap at midwicket and Khawaja is off the mark"
"angled across in the channel, nipping away as Khawaja comes across"
"ooh, that's close, skates through to the keeper past the outside edge"
"beaten and struck on the pads, not given but SA decide to <b>review</b>. This dipped across Khawaja and flicked the back pad as he got squared up... but I think that's going to be missing off stump, given the angle from over the wicket. Yep, impact was umpire's call and it was then heading past off stump, always a bit speculative"
"pitched up in the channel, no stroke this time"
gets a touch straight and worked away for a couple
"Philander goes knocking in the corridor once again, left alone by Khawaja"
"heat on this, 148kph and arrowing in at Bancroft, it deflects down to fine leg"
pitched up and steered towards point from the crease
"tight lines from Rabada, he's not under attack now, 145kph and Khawaja defends on off"
"oof, that's a spicy meatball, 148kph once again and Uzzie has to bail out at the last moment as it threatens the top of his bonce"
"on the body, forced through midwicket for a couple"
"length around off, lines it up in defence"
"good length, looking for a chink in the armour, Bancroft defends solidly"
"oh, dreadful running... <b>but the underarm from cover is well off target!</b> Bancroft dropped the ball into the off side but the call left Khawaja struggling for his ground, luckily the throw was poor"
"in the channel outside off, 128kph and sliding through as Khawaja shoulders arms"
"down the leg side, flick and a miss from the batsman"
"tight around off, Khawaja defends"
touch short of a length and Khawaja defends from the crease
"yoinks, how has he not edged that?! Testing length, 143kph and the ball holds its line, fades past the edge into the gloves as the arms begin to go up..."
"dug in short, Bancroft sees it early and ducks"
"back of a length, pushing the speed gun to 146kph as Bancroft attempts to work it off his body"
"full and straight, <b>149kph/92mph as Rabada clicks up through the gears</b> but Bancroft plays it well, flicked nonchalantly off his pads and it races away through midwicket"
good length on the stumps and tapped down into the off side
"back of a length, comes across to block... another front-foot no-ball from KG"
gets into line again and defends
"good length and he draws Bancroft out, takes the outside edge but he controlled it well for four through gully"
"more risky running, again Khawaja seems to be on his heels as Bancroft drops the ball into the covers, but Markram can't hit the stumps!"
"dug in short, Uzzie swivels on the pull... <b>and sends it straight down the gullet of fine leg!</b> Rabada with the catch in front of the stands! More whoops around Newlands as Morkel strikes with his third ball; he's always going to get extra bounce and Khawaja didn't seem to have factored that in, though he usually plays the pull shot well"
"welcome to the crease Smiffy! Banged in short, 137kph and sliding leg side"
"length, speared into the covers coming across"
"another bumper from Morne to finish the over, Smith ducks it"
"rising from a length, scuds into the pad, think it was high though... they take the leg bye behind square"
"avast and belay! Smith smokes a square drive for four! It was full and wide and asking to be hit, really - so Smith did"
"hits a length around off, Smith defends"
"criminy, that's a beast of a ball, <b>148kph and it hits Smith in the armpit!</b> He was moving across and looked like he wanted to leave but the ball wasn't in the mood to comply, Smith stuck in the crosshairs and struck a stinging blow"
"Rabada oversteps again, charging in looking for that extra yard"
"touch short outside off stump, Smith jabs it down towards backward point"
"fuller, searing pace at the stumps, but Smith thrust his bat down and keeps it out to end a ferocious hour of Test match cricket!"
"trundles in and hits a back of a length outside off, climbing through to de Kock as Bancroft lets it go"
"touch short and wide, 135kph and left alone once again"
"coming back in this time, bouncing at a nasty height, Bancroft phlegmatically closes the face and blocks"
"whoosh, that's gone to the fence, 145kph in the channel and full enough to invite the drive, flies uppishly but behind point and away"
"goes wide and fires the ball in, short of a length and tucked to leg"
"banged in, rising to crunch into the splice as Bancroft gets up on his toes, well defended down into the off side"
"good length, rising sharply as Smith pongos across his stumps and defends"
"ripper, 148kph and past the outside edge! Rabada slips back into his groove, glides in and hammers the pitch short of a length, Smith was trying to force off the back foot and is beaten"
"touch fuller, <b>hits 150kph/92mph now</b>, Smith lines it up and blocks on off"
"length ball in the channel, Smith drives with a flourish, all cubist angles but no timing this timing, rolls to extra cover"
"fired in straighter, a heat-seeker on the front pad, Smiffy manages to squirt it away through backward square leg"
"slightly wide, climbing off a length and left alone"
"dug in short at the rib cage, Smith hops across and blocks"
"touch back of a length outside off, left alone"
"Morkel attempts to bounce Smith, who isn't interested in cross-batted shots, for now"
"extra lift, Smith fences at it - <b>and sends a simple catch to gully!</b> Smith can't believe it, Morkel looks like he can't believe it... but you'd better believe it, Australia's captain is gone, <b>his first single-figure score since the Adelaide Ashes Test!</b> The pace was good but Smith doesn't usually waft at those if he doesn't need to. All eyes on Rabada but Morkel is the man to take the head of the snake"
"length, slightly leg side and he dobs it down from the crease"
"slightly back of a length, 143kph and Marsh covers his stumps in defence"
"and he's thrumming away on a good length immediately, fish-tailing in a touch as Bancroft blocks"
"touch short, Bancroft wants to tip and run but again he's left his partner in the doo-doo! <b>A direct hit from Bavuma and Marsh was struggling</b>, but the throw misses by a whisker!"
on the stumps and tucked to the leg side
"wicket-to-wicket attack from Big Vern, lined up in defence"
"length ball, 126kph and attempting to nip to across the southpaw, tapped away to the on side"
"in the channel, 129kph/80mph and winking flirtatiously at the batsman as he comes across and shoulders arms"
"that's a fiendish line, short enough to leave but you've got to hold your nerve, the ball jagging back in as Bancroft does so, shoulders arms"
"fuller, nibbling in a fraction, clips the inside edge as he reaches forward, gets a single down to fine leg"
"hits the pitch hard, the ball nips away and judders the outside edge, flies low towards Elgar in the gully... but this one didn't carry, squirts away for a single"
"dug in back of a length outside off, Bancroft rides it and drops the ball into the covers, this time they don't risk the run"
"bosh! Bancroft takes on the short ball and clouts it over square leg, meaty connection and that bounds away into an unguarded part of the field"
"back of a length, 143kph and blocked on off"
"angled across the bows, Marsh happy to let those go"
"fuller and closer to off stump, testing his patience and Marsh does have a nibble this time, stroked towards extra cover"
"length ball, comes across and defends on off"
"ambles in and pushes the ball through in the corridor of bamboozlement, slightly short and Marsh leaves"
"another length delivery around off stump, defended"
"straighter line, 126kph on middle and leg, tapped towards midwicket"
"short, 143kph and rising outside off, this time Bancroft judges his nudge into the covers well"
"round the wicket to Marsh, pitched up and entices the drive, the ball flies through backward point - managed to keep on top of it and they pick up three"
"flicked away off the pads, Philander does terrific work on the rope at fine leg to prevent four"
"pitched up and punched through mid-off, couple more to Bancroft's tally"
"woof, 140kph and sizzling into the keeper's gloves, Bancroft beaten as he groped in the channel!"
"overpitched, lovely timing from Bancroft, pinged back down the ground... Morkel got a hand on it and had Marsh diving for his ground, but the ball diverted past the stumps and away for four"
"length around off, 131kph and tapped down in front of square"
"yeesh, how close was that to the top of off? Tight lines, looking to give the batsman a thorough frisking, but Marsh judged it well"
"and again, 130kph on a rail just outside off, Shaunie has to watch it closely, leaves again"
"this is Scrooge McDuck tight from Philander, the ball snaking back but he's just a fraction short and Marsh can let it go"
"straighter, jabbed down to the on side"
"good length and nipping away appreciably this time, doesn't make the batsman play"
"yikes, that's cut him in half! Back of a length and jagging back a <i>ridonculous</i> amount, flies over off stump as Bancroft tries in vain to get his bat down"
"short of a length, lets this one go"
"on the stumps, 133kph, Bancroft shows it a straight bat in defence"
"oh, keeps low, hits the front pad as Bancroft walks across... but missing leg stump, I think, might have clipped the bat, too"
"round the wicket to Marsh, who defends"
"slightly too full and Marsh bullets a drive to the cover rope for his first boundary - neat and compact, like a barber applying a swift buzz cut"
comes across and misses with a flick
"length in the channel, 127kph and nibbling away, Bancroft decides not to feed the fishes"
"pitched up and Bancroft drives, <b>nearly drags on to his stumps!</b> We've seen him go that way before, but this time the ball squirts to fine leg"
"touch short, the ball swerves away from over the wicket as Marsh leaves"
"scuttling through low, length delivery around off and it hits the toe of the bat as SMarsh lines up a block"
sliding on to the pads and tucked away square for one
"round the wicket, short of a length, 136kph and nudged down to fine leg for one more"
"angled in, climbing to deflect off bat and the thigh pad as Bancroft flicks to leg, there's man at leg gully but he can't cut it off and <b>that boundary takes Australia into three figures</b>"
"short of a length outside off, left alone"
"short, wide and <i>crunched</i> to the point boundary, <b>that's a splendid way to go to fifty!</b> Bancroft sees it early rockstars the cut for four, TV right out of the window, there. Brings up his third Test half-century"
pitched up and punched through cover to the sweeper
"tip and run into the covers, this time Bavuma isn't quick enough to trouble them"
"over the wicket, lobbed up and blocked on off stump"
"tight lines, patted away coming forwards"
"this skids through a bit quicker, he drops back and chops down on it"
"flighted on off stump, Marsh props out to defend"
"tossed up, wheeling away rhythmically already, blocked from the crease"
"slightly flatter and Marsh goes back, turns down into the leg side"
"short of a length, 139kph outside off, Bancroft ignores it"
"ooh, there's the line, shaping away a fraction as he draws Bancroft into an indeterminate push, beats the edge"
"back of a length, line slightly wide and he can leave this time"
"short, angling in and chopped down into the off side form the crease"
"pitched up, Bancroft steps out smoothly and steers a drive through backward point, nicely done and he gets another boundary"
"good pace and bounce in the channel, left alone once more"
"onto the front foot, drilled into the covers"
"lovely footwork, lovely timing! Sashaying to the pitch and pounding through the covers!"
"big stride forward, a slip is lurking but met with a full face"
"aggression again, advancing down the pitch, looking for the lofted drive but settling for a clip to mid-on"
"advancing to meet the pitch of the ball, pushed back up the pitch"
"fuller length, met with a straight bat, head over the ball, nudged to mid-on"
"ooh, feisty bowling, back of a length, climbing past the edge with a bit of late movement. Bancroft stays inside the line"
shoulders arms once more
"nip off the pitch, raps the back pad"
"outside off, and zipping through to the keeper. A bit of nibble off the deck now, and good pace from KG"
"hooping outswing but Bancroft picks the wider line early, and watches his drive onto the middle of the bat. That's quality"
"tight line, fuller length, dabbed defence into the covers and they screech through for the single"
"round the wicket, dabbed into the gap"
poked into the covers
"head over the ball, meeting the full length with a clip to wide long-on"
"more flight and bite, big grip from outside off stump, but firmly pushed away"
drilled into the covers but what a stop from Bavuma! Diving full stretch to cut off a certain four. He's lightning
"clipped off the pads, in the air for a moment, but dies in front of short mid-on"
"round the wicket, angling into the left-hander on a full length, and stabbed out to point"
"sharp running into the covers, bat and pad together as Rabada probes away on a full length"
"fired down the leg side, Marsh has a waft but can't connect"
crunched to short cover as Marsh meets the full length with a straight bat
"round the wicket once more, point is on point to gather a squirty defensive push"
nip back into the left-hander! Marsh was halfway committed to a push outside off and just about changed his mind as the ball jagged viciously back into him. Ungainly but well played in the end
"down on one knee, a subtle lap-sweep behind square, using the pace of the ball to excellent effect"
"tossed up from round the wicket, a full face of the bat in defence"
"chiselled firmly off the toes, and that whistles through midwicket. Bancroft is playing with extreme fluency now"
"full face of the bat again, pushed to midwicket and Maharaj is miffed that there's a single on offer there"
"clipped uppishly to mid-on, easy pickings for Australia at the moment"
"better bowling, dragging the right-hander forward for a full-faced defensive push"
"round the wicket, attacking the hip and dabbed to the leg side"
"banged in back of a length, nip off the deck and solid back-foot defence"
"on the legs, tucked to short midwicket"
firm block to the off side
"angling back into the pads, as Bancroft stands firm in defence"
"nip off the deck once more, but from back of a length. Bancroft sights it early and lets it go"
solidly behind the line
solidly blocked
"clipped to leg, but no way through there"
"a compact drive into the covers, neatly played"
gathered in the followthrough as Marsh gets behind the line
"clipped on the up, into the leg side and they scamper through"
"outside off, through to the keeper with a flourish of a leave-alone"
"that's sumptuous! Over-pitched outside off stump, and a rifling cover drive, played it late, weight leaning through the ball, and timed to perfection"
a big yawning leave outside off
stoutly blocked back down the track
a yawning leave outside off stump
"nip off the seam, but on a wide line. An unruffled leave-alone"
"a hint of outswing on a wide line, stabbed out to point"
"stretching onto the front foot, and firmly placed to mid-off"
"another leave outside off, lining up the outswing and letting it go"
"back of a length and curling outswing, Bancroft is beaten but makes a meal of it. Half a yard fuller and he could have been in business"
"takes the edge this time, but going down all the time, and clean through the vacant third slip! A moral victory but more runs to the total. The 150 is up"
"stands tall in defence, blocked back down the pitch"
"tight line, angling into the left-hander, stoutly blocked on the back foot"
"splice-jangling bounce from a full length! Marsh rides it well, taking off his bottom hand to control the shot"
"Marsh chases the wide one, and <strong>there's the breakthrough!</strong> ... 300 Test wickets as well, and what a key moment to do so. The bounce pushed Marsh back on his heels, and he wasn't in control as he nicked to the keeper"
"big nip off the seam, as Mitch Marsh lines it up and misses it by a mile"
"outside off, and through to the keeper, more jag and bounce from a good length"
fully forward and dabbed into the covers
"stretching onto the front foot, and solidly blocked"
"<strong>that's a jaffa!</strong> Hooping swing from Philander, his trademark line and full length, shaping down leg then bending past the off stump with nip off the seam. Misses the edge by a whisker"
this one tails back and holds its line. Left alone
another leave-alone. A lot resting on Bancroft now
"drawn onto the front foot, and defended into the covers"
"wider line, keeps a touch lower as it swings through to the keeper"
left alone on a very wide line
"outside off, too wide once more to draw a stroke"
"banging out a consistent line and length, but consistently too wide to tempt a stroke"
left alone again
"<strong>this is a tighter line!</strong> Rears at the gloves from an off-stump line, and flicks the thigh pad, en route to the slip cordon. Excitement, but no bat involved"
"no stroke once more. A very Harmison-esque over there. Lots of bounce, intermittent threat"
"big stretch onto the front foot, worked down the ground"
"outside off, and through to the keeper"
"big stride once more, angled defence into the off side"
"<B>celebrappeal from Big Vern, and with good reason, that's plumb!</B> He doesn't bother looking at the umpire as he sets off towards the cordon, tight line, nibbling back into Bancroft's front pad. He has <B>reviewed</B>, but more in hope than expectation. Yep, smashing middle and leg."
"fullish, around off stump and prodded defensively to the on side"
"pitched up n the corridor, Paine watches it through"
"oi vey, he's right on the money to start with, straightening off the deck and climbing past the outside edge"
"length ball, this nips away a touch and Marsh can leave more comfortably"
"shortish, 130kph a foot or two outside off, no stroke offered"
back of a length and zipping through as Marsh goes back and shoulders arms
"good line, gets him thinking about the shot, just leaves him enough"
"whoosh, past the bat again, 137kph and this drew Marsh into a genuine push before seaming through to de Kock. Morkel on it from the get go"
"pitched up outside off, tapped towards mid-off"
lets this one go in the channel
"130kph wobbler in the channel outside off, Paine demurs"
short and rising to be blocked over off stump... and Nigel Llong calls him for overstepping
"length outside off, Paine shuffles across and leaves"
"tap-tapping away in the channel, Paine leans on to the front foot, sniffs the breeze and shoulders arms"
"angling in a touch more, blocked on off stump"
"ah, and that helps break the dam, Marsh stepping across and stroking a controlled drive through the covers to get off the mark"
"shortish, 135kph outside off stump, left alone"
"lovely delivery from Morkel, pitched up a bit further and then decking away as Marsh feels for the drive and is beaten"
"slightly wide this time, 138kph and left alone"
"oh, done by another jaffa! Maybe <i>just</i> a fraction too short, allowing the ball to straighten past the edge as Marsh thrust at it from the crease... but that's textbook Morkel"
"dabbed into the covers, they chance the single against Bavuma again... but the throw is wide of the stumps! Think Paine might have got home anyway"
"gottim, that's pitch-perfect Philander on his favoured cabbage patch! Not much Marsh could do about that ball, a femme fatale on off stump, <b>it kisses the outside edge and curves through to the keeper</b> - chewed up and spat out. SA taking a grip here"
"shaping away on a seductive length once more, Cummins lets it go"
"nearly gets his man! Straightening just enough on off stump, takes the edge but flies low towards the cordon"
slightly straighter and blocked into the leg side
"probing away, line and length in the corridor, no stroke"
sends down another in-out nibbler but Cummins watches it carefully by
"touch full from Morkel, 137kph outside off and Paine clips a drive to the fielder"
"shortish, comes across and taps the ball away"
"good length, angled in and holding its line, Paine shoulders arms"
"Morkel is giving nothing away for free here, again it's watched through hawkishly outside off"
"nipping away off a length, slightly wide and Paine can leave well alone"
dropped down towards point and despite an initial call of 'No' they make the single comfortably
"bit of width, Paine shuffles across and spanks a drive to the cover sweeper"
"Vern and his ball-on-a-string seek out the top of off, Cummins covers it"
"gets him fiddling in the wind this time, slightly back of a length and Cummins can leave but there's magnets in these deliveries and he's <i>this close</i> to nicking off"
"gets a little straight, worked off the pads for a couple, Cummins off the mark"
"full, curling away, 130kph and driven but without timing to mid-off"
"sliding down the leg side, this goes quick a long was a Cummins flicks at it, de Kock does well to get a hand on it and prevent more than a bye"
"drops in the bumper, not seen too many of those from Morkel today but it's well directed, Cummins takes evasive action"
"in the channel, back of a length and Cummins can stay inside the line"
"that's a beauty again, touch short and jagging away as Cummins goes fishing and is beaten"
"fired in this time, worked across the line"
"bangs in the short ball, Cummins ducks hastily"
"finishes with a ripsnorter, reversing away from the bat from back of a length - good luck hitting those"
"releases the pressure straight away, dragged down and Paine seizes on a bit of width to hammer four through backward point"
tossed up further towards the front foot and defended to extra cover
"chipped back past the bowler! Maharaj threw himself across but couldn't get to it, struck pretty firmly coming forwards by Paine"
"flighted, spinning away outside off, Cummins leaves"
"tossed up and met on the front foot, defended softly back down the track"
"gets a it more dip, straightening on middle and off, Cummins blocks doughtily"
drops short and Paine swivels to bat a couple away on the pull through square leg
"oof, that's not far off, bit of an injudicious swipe from Paine, on his heels and beaten for pace"
"short of a length, 144kph and sizzling through in the channel outside off as Paine throws his hands up"
slightly short again and this time Paine dabs one into the covers
"banged in, 143kph and veering back at Cummins like a Vespa cutting through traffic, fended down to fine leg for one"
"in the channel, again Rabada is a fraction short and Paine can usher it through"
tossed up and blocked on off stump
"flighted, Cummins plants the front foot to defend"
"sliding on a touch flatter and the ball pops low off the inside edge, short leg lurking"
"pushed through outside off, Cummins goes back to cut but finds point"
presses forward to block on the stumps
"loped up full and Cummins taps the ball down the ground, accepting the offer to keep the strike"
"excellent line, lifting from a good length, beats the bat as Cummins hangs back"
"short ball, the batsman hunches down in his bunker"
"length, jagging back in at 145kph, Cummins blocks into the covers"
"full in the channel, 141kph and played neatly square on the drive, Maharaj scuttles across to cut it off and prevent a run"
dug in back of a length and whistling through outside off stump
"this comes back in menacingly to clip the pad, heading down the leg side, thought"
tossed up and pushed square on off stump
Cummins leans into another solid forward defensive
"flighted, stroked back to the bowler"
"tossed up straighter, presses out to block"
"Maharaj gives it some more air, again Cummins taps it away cautiousl"
"angled in full on middle and leg, nudged to the on side and Maharaj hops across to field"
"short ball, dropped down into the covers and they give Bavuma another chance to pull off a sharp run out... but he underarms wide of the stumps"
comes across and steers the ball square
"that's the line, <b>big outside edge and it's snaffled at third slip!</b> Rabada reverses the ball away at a fair old lick and it's too good for Patty C, de Villiers plunges to his left to take the catch and Australia are seven down!"
"round the wicket, length ball curving away, 138kph but wide enough for Starc to ignore"
"touch short, angled in and prancing past the bat as Starc dangles it hopefully"
"nip-backer this time, Starc pre-meditates his leave... and it practically shaves off stump on its way past! Rabada has his hands on his knees, close but no cigar"
"flat outside off, Paine drops back and cuts forcefully towards backward point"
tossed up and tapped back down the track
"wheeling away, Paine comes across to defend"
steered into the off side
floated up and patted back down the track again
"given some flight around middle and leg, Paine pushes it watchfully away to end a maiden"
"short of a length, Starc goes after this one, bit top-edgey but he picks up his first runs over cover"
"reversing away, Starc stretches for the ball, <b>steered low into AB's bucket hands!</b> Another excellent catch from third slip, diving forwards to scoop a thick edge, giving Rabada his third and denting Australia further"
"oof, he takes this on the heart! Short and slamming into the body as he drops the hands... but we know Lyon's got ticker"
"rising in the channel, fences at the ball as is beaten"
"another snorting lifter outside off, Lyon can't law bat on those"
"pitched up a bit more and Lyon counters, hoicking the ball clear of mid-on for three to get off the mark"
"full length in the channel, Lyon clubs it in front of point for a couple more"
"teasing delivery, fullish and seaming enough, beats Lyon's airy waft"
"<b>dropped!</b> Or, at least, missed... Philander has hurt himself here, having dived full length for a catch running across from mid-on. Lyon scooped the ball high in the air, towards the midwicket area, and Philander couldn't quite get a hand on it - he then seemed to jar his knee, possibly wind himself, too"
"short of a length, 135kph outside off, left alone"
"pitched up and dabbed behind square, de Villiers hared up from the cordon and had a chance to run out Lyon, he was well short but the throw was off balance and wide!"
"through to the keeper, did that go under the bat? Lyon was late on it, the ball might have kept low... but on we go"
pitched up and pushed along the carpet to mid-off
"dug in short and Paine whirls on the pull, slaps it away behind deep square leg for four"
"curving through outside off, lets it go"
"short of a length, 144kph and climbing like Lizzie, George and Ralph to be taken high up by de Kock"
"fires this one in straighter, Paine gets into line"
"back of a length, 139kph and left alone in the channel"
"Morkel goes full, stump-splattering length, swatted away calmly by Lyon"
"bouncer now, swung away h-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-g-h in the leg side... but it's wide of Rabada, who runs around the rope but won't get to it as the ball plops into the outfield"
"pitched up, 138kph and Paine tries to withdraw the bat, ends up deflecting the ball into the turf"
"tight, off-stump line, defended on the back foot"
"steams in and sends the ball down on a shapely line in the channel, Paine lets it go"
"short and there's room for Paine to cut, gets a couple to deep backward square as Maharaj tumbles after it"
"outside off, and through to the keeper"
"stabbed down to third man, and that'll help no end"
"backs away as Rabada goes wide on the crease to create an angle, and cracks firmly to point, just short of the fielder"
"<B>a flying edge and dropped by Amla!</B> A massive wipe through the line from Lyon, a very thick edge, flying high to the left of first slip who reaches high but can't cling on!"
"very full and tailing into the toes, no appeal as Rabada thumps the pad, down the leg side"
"leaning forward, stabbed into the covers"
"a dirty dobbler outside off, actually a pretty good line and length, and uneasily wafted away"
"short and wide, and slapped hard to deep point"
"back of a length, crunched hard through the off side, that's a solid bit of ball-striking"
"short, wide, pies. Lyon gleefully thwacks another cut-drive through the covers"
"<I>that's</I> more like it, tailing in with the reverse swing, and demands a respectful block on middle and off"
flipped off the pads to the leg side. That experiment was a resounding failure
"clears the front leg and lines up a chaotic slog through the line. Short leg flees to the boundary, even if the ball doesn't"
"round the wicket, Lyon walks inside the line and pulls compactly to backward square"
"leans forward, poked into the covers"
"that's a magnificent drive through long-off! Hitting the ball on the up, not remotely to the pitch of the ball, but what an eye. Slotted"
"<strong>a dismissive slap through point!</strong> Well, well, these are vital runs. Like Rabada this morning, Lyon is taking the positive approach to the short ball, leaning back and flinging the bat!"
"<B>dropped by de Villiers at third slip!</B> Another slash at a good length delivery, and AB tumbles back but can't cling on as the ball arrives at pace. A rarity"
"chopped off the back foot to point, Amla fumbles but quickly recovers"
"stretching forward, solid defence"
down on one knee and swept compactly to deep square leg
"squared up on middle stump, reaching forward to smother the spin"
walking into a defensive push to cover
"solid full-faced block, back down the pitch"
"wide line, doesn't get up much, Lyon is hanging on the back foot, way outside leg, and can't reach that"
"neatly tucked into the leg side this time, as Lyon stands his ground on the back foot"
"loopy slower ball, right up to the blockhole, and pushed to the off side"
right behind the line to block
"sharp running between the wickets, to mid-on"
"that's a sweet strike, clean through the covers to bring up the fifty stand. South Africa's turn to look bereft of ideas"
"twirled up, outside off stump, a hint of turn as Paine leaves alone"
dragged forward and tucked to the leg side
pushed to mid-on
flicked into the leg side
"a pounding sweep, through the leg side. Not quite timed, but plenty intent"
"ouch, Maharaj wears this one in his followthrough as he drops into the long barrier to gather a firm push. An awkward bounce, right into the breadbasket"
"banged in Lyon, angled into the body, and hops over the top of a loose wafty uppercut"
"extra bounce from a full length, jagging over an attempted backfoot steer"
"short and misdirected, that's a poor ball but an excellent strike, attempting to cramp Lyon as he retreats to leg, but instead playing straight into his hands. Pulled firmly through the leg side"
"clears the front leg, and <B>battered over the covers!</B> Lyon is flying! Watched the ball right onto the bat, and belted it!"
"too much room this time, and misses with another wipe through the off side"
"a massive mow through the line! But Morkel jags this one back over the top of the stumps. A maiden fifty is on the cards for Lyon, and he knows how he wants to get there!"
forward and pushed to cover
"<B>bissects keeper and slip with a late cut!</B> Effective, if chancy. Not sure it was quite the intended shot..."
pushed back down the pitch
"left alone, and misses the off stump by a whisker! That was the arm ball, and it kept coming back in..."
"big stride to defend, head over the ball"
"pushed firmly, on the up, back to the bowler"
"slashed in the air ... Elgar back-pedals at point ... and <B>takes the catch!</B> Superbly judged, at full stretch, and what a brilliant cameo that was. Lyon deserved a maiden fifty, but kept attacking to the bitter end"
"well bowled, jagging back on the angle, and grazing past the off stump"
"stabbed into the covers, looking for two, but think better of it. Never run on a misfield, as they say..."
nudged to mid-off to get off the mark
nibbling back into the right-hander
"round the wicket, three slips in place, a sturdy clout to mid-off"
"outside off, curling away off the pitch, and through to the keeper"
"swinging in sharply, but down the leg side, flicks off the thigh pad but they decline the single"
"outside off, no stroke this time"
"dead-batted into the leg side, and this time they take the single. Two balls for Hazlewood to see off..."
"round the wicket, nips away, Hazlewood dangles the bat but is never in danger"
dabbed to point off the back foot. Solid defence from the No.11. Australia keep their end up
"swing on a full length, well watched onto the middle of the bat and clipped to mid-on"
"outside off, curling away, no stroke here"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
"a crunching drive, on the walk, but straight to short cover. A pleasing connection but nothing to show for it"
"inducker, climbs into the thigh pad as Paine shapes to leg"
"through to the keeper, as the umpires start to contemplate the light ..."
"round the wicket, slides down the leg side, short delivery and Hazelwood can gets out of the way without drama"
"dug in at the body, Hazlewood fends and gets a glove on it... and that will be four to fine leg, gets it away safely"
"back of a length, straightening a touch outside off as Hazlewood has a dabble and misses"
"pitched up, prodded into the covers coming across"
"good length, 143kph and tailing in towards the stumps, met with a solid block down the track"
"short, but casually flipped over gully for four! Knew what he was doing there, rocked back and angled the bat to ramp the ball fine of deep backward point, and tweak Rabada's tail in the process"
"shortish outside off, Paine swats a cut but finds deep point, they don't take the single"
"slightly short in the channel, left alone"
"back of a length, again wide enough for Paine to come across and leave"
"climbing through, 131kph as Morne starts off a touch ginger, no stroke"
"oh yeah, that's a beauty, fuller and curving away from the rough side, beats the outside edge as Paine feels for it"
good length and zipping through to the keeper as he shoulders arms this time
"short, 141kph and soaring through outside off as Hazlewood swings and misses"
"fires in the yorker, but Hazlewood is equal to it! This was full and straight at 143kph, but he gets the bat down and Gandalfs it  - 'You shall not pass!' - in front of the stumps"
"banged in short at the body, again Hazlewood plays the cheeky ramp, just one to third man this time"
"more short stuff and Paine hooks in the air, bounces out towards deep square leg"
"got him, <b>steered to first slip!</b> Hazlewood gives Rabada a fourth with a rather deferential fiddle, nicked to slip - and off they go, South Africa taking a handy 56-run lead on first innings (although it could have been a fair bit more)"
"fullish outside off, hint of inswing but he leaves it be"
shouts of interest as Markram chops down late on the ball and Paine leaps to grab it... but was on the bounce
"full length, Markram gets out and drives, plinked to point"
"<b>dropped!</b> Khawaja grasses a one-handed chance at gully! Starc throws his head back in anguish, it was a thick outside edge as Markram went hard at the ball, seemed to take Khawaja a bit by surprise, he might have been able to get there with both hands but the attempt looked casual and went straight to ground"
"slides on to the pads and flicked for four now! Just a tickle of bat, sends it fine, increasing Starc's frustrations"
"pitched up in the channel, he wisely lets this one go"
"good length in the channel outside off, nibbling back a touch and left alone"
"good footwork from Elgar, comes across and punches assertively towards mid-off"
angled across and again he can leave alone in the channel
"goes round the wicket now, 130kph on a length but wide of the stumps, no stroke"
"dug in short, a loopy bouncer sails down the leg side"
"back of a length, 137kph and rising over the stumps, Elgar grinds it up for flour to make his morning bread"
"length on off stump, Markram shuffles into line and taps the ball down"
"licks from Starc, 145kph and getting extravagant carry outside off, Paine has to leap for the take above his head as Markram shoulders arms"
"short of a length, closer to the stumps and Markram blocks steadily"
"banged in, 143kph on the body and tucked down to the leg side"
shoooooootttttttttt! Not a bad ball from Starc but Markram is swiftly on to the front foot and booms a drive through the covers for a genuine boundary this time
"dug in short, whistling through in the corridor as he drops the hands"
"angled in from round the wicket, defended on off"
"ooh, nicely bowled but Elgar gets away with a scissored prod, the ball shaped a touch as he brought the bat down at an angle, thick-edged low through gully for a few"
"in the channel, happy to leave"
"length ball, 136kph and sliding in, beautifully dealt with by Markram, just cushioned back down the ground, doesn't quite go all the way"
"back round the wicket, Elgar leaves alone outside off"
"length, 137kph and spitting towards the bat handle, Elgar jabs it away square on the leg side for one"
"Starc stays over the wicket to Elgar, puts it on a length, 143kph around off, defended"
"sprayed on to the pads, not enough swing to make this dangerous and Elgar stands and belts it through midwicket for four"
"hurled down straight and again it's meat and drink for Elgar, clipped for a couple more"
"corrects his line, touch short and wide, left alone"
"angled in and straightening on off, crabs across to blocks"
"bumper, very high and a touch leg side as Elgar crouches out of the way"
"length ball around off stump, Markram shows it he bat face"
"beauty from Hazlewood, holding its line and darting past the outside edge as Markram prods, can't get forward because of the length but somehow manages not to hit it"
"angled in with the arm once again, this time he lines up the block"
"back of a length, 131kph over the top of off, Markram defends"
"bit of width on offer, Markram steers the ball along the ground past gully for a couple"
"fired in straight, tucked to the leg side"
"slung down full in the channel outside off, 143kph and bunted to cover coming forwards"
"touch short, Markram comes across to defend"

"up on the toes, pushed off the back foot to the off side"
"sharp lift outside off once more, as Markram this time has a go with a back-foot punch. Gathered at point, but that was a touch chancy"
"<B>and again!</B> This time it flies for four, but Markram knew nothing about that, the leaping bounce meant he was never in control once he'd committed to the stroke, and was very lucky not to splice it to gully"
"pushed onto the back foot, fuller and straighter this time"
bouncer. Markram ducks
squeezed into the off side from a fuller length

It was pitched up, inviting the drive, but the Mighty Hash used to leave those all day, until they were <i>just</i> right. Instead, he's made a mighty hash of that, and given Australia an opening"

"draws him across, prances to take the edge - <b>gone!</b> That's good bowling, Hazlewood briefly turning our attention back to the game with a rising delivery, utilising the hard, new nut - it flew off the edge and Marsh pouched it safely to prise de Villiers from the crease in the 60s for the second time in the match"

"pitched up, taken off the pads through square leg"
"banged in, Philander loses control on the hook... <b>but Hazlewood steps on the rope as he tries to takes the catch!</b> That was clearing fine leg, would have needed some acrobatics to bring it back in for a catch... and, to be honest, Hazlewood didn't really look in the mood"
"pitched up and punched through cover now, nicely played by Philander, wielding his cudgel to good effect"
"on the pads, this is clipped fine, that'll be four more! Frustrations mount for Starc - <b>and the SA lead goes above 350</b>"

tossed up on off and tapped back to the bowler
"there she blows, heaved over long-on! Using those long levers, right under the ball and powered beyond the ropes. <a href=http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/22884879/he-great-servant-south-african-cricket  target=_blank>Could have been an opener</a>, you know"

"dug in short and Philander pulls through midwicket, takes the single"

"tossed up, draws him out... <b>and a thick edge goes to slip!</b> Three in a blink for SA! Maharaj gets the wicket he so nearly had in his previous over, a nicely flighted bit of cheese followed by the mousetrap snapping shut on Khawaja"
"gottim, <b>brilliantly caught at forward short leg!</b> Maharaj goes charging off, he's on a hat-trick, Australia are four down and Newlands is in foment! Spinning in and jabbed away off his glove, the ball looped to Markram's right and he stuck out a golden paw to take the catch as he crashed to earth!"
"round the wicket, straightening a touch, defended without drama"
"floated up full, Marsh lunges out to defend"
"flighted, punched firmly into the man at silly point on the bounce"
"gives it some air, Marsh blocks this one solidly to finish a double-wicket maiden for Keshav Maharaj"
"slung down in the channel, lets it go"
"back of a length, thundering through outside off and Smith leaves again"
"rapid from Rabada, 143kph and rising sharply as Smith thrusts his hands up"
"shortish, again Smith gets into line"
"back of a length, wide of off stump and again he leaves it well alone"
"angled in a touch more, 138kph and Smith blocks"
"tossed up from round the wicket, stroked through mid-off"
"full and flighted, Smith gets off the mark with a drilled single to long-off"
"yelps of excitement around the bat as Marsh leaves, the ball smuggling its way past off stump... just a inch or two away!"
tossed up and tapped away
"lovely shot from Marsh, overpitched on middle and off, makes room and crumps it through the covers"
"nicely bowled, dipping and getting Marsh reaching out for it, stabbed away"
Smith shuffles across and lets a shortish ball go
"Rabada has found a mesmeric groove here, but it's a touch short and wide again, Smith can leave without fear"
"fuller, still wide in the channel, 135kph, no stroke offered"
"slightly back of a length, again Smith doesn't need to play"
"takes on the hook, and <b>the top edge sails all the way!</b> Pace and bounce from Rabada, 143kph and targeting the batsman, Smith will take the dividend, though"
"back worrying away in the corridor, Smith happy to leave"
"wheeling away round the wicket, tapped to cover"
"flighted, entices him to go harder at a drive, manages to keep it down as the close fielders groan in expectation"
floated up and blocked on the front foot
"drops short, Marsh sees it early and is in position to throw those Popeye forearms through a powerful cut for four"
"lobbed up closer to the stumps, Marsh defends"
comes forward and punches to cover
"over the wicket, short of a length outside off, 135kph and left alone by Smith"
"fuller, gets him driving, Smith lances it to cover coming forwards"
"now Smith's out, a carbon copy dismissal - <b>steered to gully again!</b> Back of a length and climbing as Smith threw the hands, a thick outside edge flew with laser-guided precision into Elgar's midriff! The deposed captain is dismissed, Australia are five down and Newlands is drinking it all in!"
"dug in short and Paine slams a pull away to the square-leg boundary, off the mark with a counterpunch"
"pitched up a bit more, shaping away as Paine sticks his head out and leaves"
"short of a length, this comes back in but it was wide to start with, no stroke required"
"dragged forward, pushed to cover"
"an emphatic wallop clean through point! Well, why not. Maharaj tossed it out a touch wide, and here's a chance to send some close fielders scattering like pigeons"
"fully forward, head over the ball"
"flogged on the up, out to deep cover"
"looped up, and pushed to the off side"
"cracked fiercely off the back foot, a tumbling stop from Philander at backward point"
"squared up on the back foot, and pushed back down the pitch"
"caught on the crease a touch, tentatively poked into the off side"
"wow, that is a perfect off-stump lifter, full length, <I>exploding</I> off the seam, and past a startled splice!"
"wider line, no stroke this time"
drilled into the covers
left alone outside off stump
"flogged into the covers, where Maharaj intercepts with ninja reactions.That was travelling"
pushed out to cover with a full face of the bat
"deflected down into the off side, just wide of slip"
left alone outside off
nothing doing here
"low full toss on the pads, gratefully clipped away"
"<strong>another one bites the dust!</strong> A massive energetic hook, a total miscue, and de Villiers at third slip is sufficiently alert to dive forward and scoop a low chance, while the rest of the fielders would probably have been looking to midwicket! This is a complete meltdown of Australian resolve now. Their chances of on-field redemption were slim anyway, but this is grim for them now"
"<strong>fierce and fast, and Morkel is on a hat-trick!</strong> Or is it? Cummins has reviewed, he thinks that has come off his wrist, not his glove, but it was savagely short and leapt like a cobra into his flinching defensive hop. Now then, that looks to have hit his wristband, which might technically make it glove... which might definitely confirm it is out! <strong>Yep, off he goes!</strong>"
"driven with hard hands, but good contact, over mid-off, through the vacancies created by the attacking field. and all the way to the rope"
"speared outside off stump, no contact this time"
"banged in short, and flinched down into the leg-side, <B>just wide of short leg!</B>"
"banged in short again, Starc rides the bounce"
"round the wicket, clipped up to mid-on and they need a bit of scamper to make it for the single, but Rabada's shy is well wide"
"turn from outside off, and blocked"
thumped down the ground to mid-off
"stands tall on the back foot, blocked into the covers"
"squeezed in the air, past the flailing short leg. Tricksy turn and bounce to the left-hander"
punched with intent to short cover
"dumped with intent, back over the bowler's head. Starc wants to go down swinging"
"through to the keeper this time, more threatening bounce"
"<B>pop from a good length, and so close to short leg!</B> Right off the face of the bat, but luckily for Starc it went straight down the pitch and out of the fielder's grasp"
"short, pulled, <strong>thwacked!</strong> Ouch, that utterly clanged the helmet, Starc was through the shot before he knew it, and that's a nasty blow to the temple. He seems fine, but understandable concern"
pushed onto the back foot from round the wicket. Blocked
"pop-a-doodle-do... <strong>easy pickings for short leg!</strong> Trademark Morkel length, angling in, exploding off the deck, pounding the bat, and looping into Markram's hands under the lid!"
"tossed up on the toes, flicked to the leg side"
"flicked into the leg side, bottom hand coming through as the ball is gathered at mid-on"
"full face of the bat, punched back to the bowler"
poked into the covers
"forward, and tapped into the covers, a crazy sharp single, to Bavuma of all people, and blow me down,<strong> that's out!</strong> A fast flat shy, a fine gather from de Kock, and Lyon is run out without facing a ball!"
"angled bat, defensive prod"
tucked off the pads to deep backward square
tight line and left alone outside off
"prodded into the cordon, an involuntary twitch of the bat on a good length"
"full and fast, attacking the stumps, tucked to the leg side"
blocked back down the pitch
"outside off, leaping off the deck and flashing past a chancy cut!"
"thumped with lots of bottom hand, out to deep midwicket. A curiously leg-sided close field for the No.11"
"ver full length, Paine plays all around it, <strong>and up goes the finger!</strong> Paine is <B>reviewing</B> and though there's no edge, it does seem to have just pitched outside leg - I thought it had reached him on the full at first... But no. On we go..."
tucked to the leg side
"looped up into the blockhole, Maharaj gathers in his followthrough"
"sliding on past the outside edge, as Paine lines up an ambitious cut. Too full and tight for the shot"
"down on one knee for the sweep, and emphatically played. Bouncing away to fine leg"
"leaning back, cut up and away through third man, and up comes the hundred!"
"short and massively wide of the batsman, and the wicketkeeper! You can't rescue those!"
"sharp once again, much better line, gallumphing into the splice as Hazlewood hops to defend"
"uppercut, <strong>but straight to fly slip! </strong>Well positioned, Philander rushed around to pocket the chance and give Morne Morkel a hugely deserved five-for in what might yet be his final Test appearance!"
