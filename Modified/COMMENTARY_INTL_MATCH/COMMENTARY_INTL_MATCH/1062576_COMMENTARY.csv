"<strong>dropped by Nair first ball</strong>. A poor shot first ball. This ball is swinging from the hand, early swing, and he still pushes at him. Gets a thick edge, to the left of Nair at third slip. He dives, and gets only his thumb on this. Nair up in his stance too early"
"more swing, some seam too, and this time Warner lets it go"
"middle and leg, swinging towards off, Warner gets a single off the inside half of the bat"
this one swings back in. The first ball to Renshaw comes in after he would have seen all the earlier ones go away. Clever bowling. Renshaw equal to it in defence
"swinging back in again, clipped wide of mid-on, and Ashwin misfields there to convert a sharp single into an easy one"
"Bhuvneshwar overpitches looking for swing, Warner right behind it, and punches this through cover. One extra fielder in the cordon means one fewer in front of the wicket"
"short of a length, just outside off, left alone by Renshaw"
"short of a length, on off, angling away, defended from the crease"
"short of a length again, into the body, Renshaw rides the bounce and keeps it down. Easy pace"
"bowled him but he was lbw before he was bowled. An uncharacteristic shot from Renshaw. Umesh has pegged him back with short deliveries, and has now bowled the perfect pitched-up outswinger, which swings back for Renshaw. He plays an expansive-looking drive instead of defending, and it sneaks back to miss the inside edge, hit him in front, and the ricochet into the wicket"
"short of a length again, into the body, and Smith gets inside its line"
"full and wide, Smith thinks of it but doesn't drive. Carried head high by Saha"
"testing delivery. On a length, on off, holding its line, defended by Warner, but this has asked him to honest"
"again, straight, on a length, makes him play again. Warner defends to leg"
"swinging back in again, Warner gets bat on. Not the middle but the inside half will do for a single to fine leg"
"wide on the crease, and big banana swing against the angle. Smith back in the crease, covers it, and defends with an open face"
"outswing again but not that big. Extra bounce, and hits him high on the bat as Smith defends"
"wide on the crease for another big outswinger. On the surface it looks like he is slipping down the leg side, but it swings late towards off. Smith does well to play this back with a straight bat. This is high-quality bowling, and so far good defensive batting from Smith"
and he pitches up to Warner after staying predominantly short for others. Draws a watchful defensive shot in front of off
"on a length, pitches outside leg, angles towards off. Solid back-foot defence again"
"short of a length, tucked away off the hip, in front of short leg, gets a single"
"short of a length, middle and off, angling down, and Smith gets inside its line"
"short of a length, outside off, punched wide of mid-on for a single"
"short of a length, outside off, and Warner punches it away for four through point. This is the first really short ball he has got with width available too. So that is an indicator of where not to bowl to him"
"full, outswinger, not big swing, pushed to mid-off"
"wide on the crease, slightly short of a length, defended outside off"
"the way Smith plays looks dangerous at the outset as he shuffles across again and looks to play against the line, but the bat comes down right in time and places it wide of mid-on"
"tell you what he has done, he has eliminated the lbw and Smith goes across the wicket to flick this length ball through square leg"
"fuller, gets some swing back in, Smith defends with a dead bat, and is hit on the inside edge. Lucky this doesn't roll on to the stumps"
"drives a length ball on the up, but can't beat mid-off"
"back to pitching it up to Warner, who defends with an open face"
"length ball, on the pads, Warner looks to to play to leg, but it seams away to hit the outside half of the bat. You have to respect the early-morning freshness"
"on a length, straight, runs off the inside half of the bat"
"short of a length, outside off, dropped wide of cover for one"
"short of a length, just outside leg, defended from the crease"
"on a length, on off, angling away, pushed wide of cover for a single"
this one seams back in but after pitching outside leg. Goes for four leg-byes off the protruding thigh pad
"on a length, on off, right behind it in defence"
"on a length, on off, defended from the crease"
"slight swing back in, Warner right forward in defence"
"<strong>that one kicked at him from nowhere</strong>. Slightly short of a length, just outside off, he is looking to defend it with a vertical bat but it bounces at him, and he follows it with a horizontal bat. Luckily for him, it flies over the slip cordon"
"fuller, on off, defended solidly"
"wide length ball, but not wide enough for Smith who shuffles across. He drives with an open face, in front of point, for four more, all along the ground"
"in the air, and deliberately so. Smith makes a statement there. Drives a length ball on the up and takes the cover fielder on. Clears him over his head"
"Umesh stays wide outside off, and Smith gets into a shape to drive and then leaves exaggeratedly"
"full outside off, squeezed out in front of deep point for a couple"
"bouncer, straight, Smith gets inside the line, looking to hook, but leaves it alone at the last moment"
"<strong>top edge on the pull</strong>. Could even be the glove. This short ball doesn't quite come on, and he is early into the pull after having moved inside the line. Gets a single fine of fine leg"
outswinger but starts too far outside off to make him play
"wide on the crease, gets some swing again, but Smith doesn't play at it despite the initial angle"
wide on the crease <strong>and extra bounce</strong> from a length. Smith does well to take the bottom hand off it as he defends

"outswinger from wide on the crease, left alone"
"stays with outswingers, driven solidly, but straight to cover"

"wide half-volley, driven to cover, Rahul does well there despite a bad bounce at him"
"short of a length, outside off, stays low, defended"
"wide on the crease, looking for outswing but there isn't any now. Smith takes this from outside off, and he has whipped this wide of mid-on for four"
"and now the square drive. Wide length ball, he covers it, and drives it in front of deep point"
"on a length, on off, pushed with an open face, Pujara makes a diving save at cover"
"short of a length, outside off, pushed towards point for a single. No man at point. That man has been pushed back"

"on a length, a set of stumps outside off, defended back to him"
"wide on the crease, length ball, around the fourth stump, and he has clipped this to midwicket"

an offbreak that doesn't turn but it starts on middle and is going down
"down the wicket, beaten in the flight, aborts aggressive intent and defends"
"on a length, Warner caught neither forward nor back. The body stretches out and defends"

"short of a length, on off, and he runs this into the vacant point region"

"short of a length, closer to off, punched to cover"
"full, middle and off, defended back to him"
"slower in the air, nice drift and dip. Pitches on off, straightens, and he defends off the front foot"

"slight shimmy, Ashwin drops this flat, punched to midwicket"
"on a length, middle and leg, clipped square for a single"
"goes back to a length ball, manages to keep it out with an open face. Not much turn on offer yet"

"wide length ball, exaggerated leave from Smith"
"short of a length, wide, punched away, in front of deep point, and he gets a couple"

"on a length, middle and leg, worked away for a single"
"full, middle and leg, driven to cover"

"an offbreak that doesn't turn. Warner defends in front of his body, gets an inside edge onto the pad"
"nice dip again, and Warner forward in defence"
"flatter, Warner goes back, opens the face to guide it to the left of point. A yes and no ensues, and no prevails"
"fullish, uses his bottom hand to drive this to mid-on"

"short of a length, goes back to work this square of midwicket"
"tossed up, some dip on this, draws a watchful defensive shot"

"on a length, on off, dips on him, defended back to him"
"looks to jump out of the crease, Ashwin slips in a quicker delivery, he defends from the crease, and is hit high on the pad"

"nice turn. <strong>He beats Smith again</strong>. On a first-day pitch. Dips on him to create the distance, and then goes past the edge"
"<strong>and now the edge</strong>. he corrects the line to make sure he takes the edge. Soft hands from Smith make sure the edge dies, and travels wide of slip. Extremely casual from Ashwin in the chase"

stays back to defend a length ball outside off
that is too short. Smith loves it. He goes back deep into his crease to punch this between cover and point
"short of a length, outside off, punched to midwicket"
slightly short but Warner fails to punish it. Plays this to mid-off
<strong>edged past slip</strong>. Jadeja creating chances every over. Warner throws his hands at a ball tossed up. This one doesn't turn. That's the natural variation. But it flies wide of slip

"short of a length, outside off, that's the <strong>100th run for this partnership</strong> as he places this between point and cover. The two shake hands"

"on a length, on off, slight movement back in, defended back to him"
"full, just outside off, defended with an open face"
"short of a length. Mind you. This is just short of a length, but he has gone deep into his crease to pull this through midwicket for four more"
"caught at slip! Stayed back to one that was a bit fuller and the extra bounce resulted in an edge on the high part of the bat, first Test wicket for Kuldeep Yadav and it was one India sorely needed. He pitched that around off stump and Warner pushed at the ball with firm hands. Turned a bit, not too much but enough"
"a much fuller length on a straighter line, Marsh plays it on the leg side"
"turns away from the left-hander outside off, Marsh lets it go this time"
"this one turns into the left-hander, it's the googly, Marsh played it from the crease and I don't think he read it because his defence is a bit hurried"
"scores his first run with a clip off the pads, too straight a line from the wristspinner"
"on Smith's pads this time, the batsman doesn't connect with the flick but the ball goes off the pads behind square"

Short delivery, rib high, at his body, marsh looks to get inside the line but the ball follows him. He aborts the pull but is a little casual in getting out of its way, and the ball kisses the bottom of the glove on the way through to Saha"

"wrong'un, hits a crack on off and rolls along the surface as he leaves it alone"
"down the wicket to take this on the full, but that square midwicket is perfectly placed for that shot"
"wrong'un, picks it off the pitch and punches it to deep point for one"
"still getting swing. This is an outswinger, Handscomb opens the face of the bat, gets a single to point, from where Jadeja absolutely rips the stumps out with a deadly throw"
"this has happened 1000s of times. Smith shuffles across, the ball is straight, you think you are in for an lbw shout, but then the bat comes down in time to smother all your hopes. Another single ticked off"

"flighted outside off, presented with a dead bat"
"on a length, on the pads, Smith goes back to work it around the corner"
"lovely shot. Handscomb down the wicket, takes this on the full, and goes straight of midwicket, beating mid-on too. That gap is small but he has threaded it"

"full, just outside off, defended off the front foot"

"on the toes, whipped away to deep midwicket for one"
"full, on off, driven nicely against the turn, but straight to short straight cover"
"tossed up outside off, pushed to mid-off"
"lovely bowling. The drift has got Handscomb. It is the late drift that has created the gap between bat and pad. Handscomb sees a full ball and drives. He is right in terms of length, but the ball drift away late, making him play away from the body. The ball turns back after pitching, beats the inside edge, and Handscomb is bowled. This is special bowling from the debutant"

"short of a length, just outside off, defended from the crease"
"on a length, outside off, defended from the crease"

"on a length, on the pads, worked past short leg for one"
"wrong'un perhaps, on the pads, worked nicely around the corner for one"
Maxwell drives big. With the spin he goes as Kuldeep bowls it full. Goes over mid-on. One bounce into the fence
defended off the front foot
"wrong'un. Beautiful bowling. India's trump card is coming good here. A bit of magic there. Kuldeep slips in the wrong'un with the scrambled seam. Maxwell doesn't pick it. He goes back to work this around the corner. The ball turns towards off from middle and leg. Maxwell is squared up, and the ball turns to flick his pad on the way to the top of off.

"Smith is gone. Huge wicket. Rahane takes a lovely low catch at slip. Smith plays for an offbreak. This is a length ball, around off. Smith is back, looks to cover the turn, but the ball doesn't turn, and takes a sharp outside edge. Rahane catches this low to his left. Second big catch from Rahane this session"

"Ashwin has gone for a six but he shouldn't mind this. Cummins winds up for a big hit over mid-on, but the ball turns and he ends up dragging to cow corner. There is a deep midwicket in place so not really the best of shots"

"on a length, middle and leg, solid forward defence"
"teasing bowling from Kuldeep, and he strikes. Just like with Handscomb, he tosses one right up to Cummins. He can't resist driving at it, but the ball dips on him, and he ends up chipping this back to Kuldeep, who has four on debut. That too on the first day of a Test"
"on a length, outside off, turns in, defended off the back foot"
seems like the wrong'un. The turn is not sharp. Defended off the front foot

"drift into the pads, defended off the inside half of the bat"
"drift again, and Wade defends one back to him again"
"flatter, into the pads, and Shreyar Iyer might have produced a sensational run-out. Iyer is the substitute fielder at square leg. Wade works this to leg, and they seem surprised by the field placement. Iyer fires in a low throw into the stumps. Saha seems like he has disturbed the stumps before the ball comes in, but even if that is the case, only one bail has come off with his impact and the second one comes off with the impact of either the ball or the gloves removing it with the ball in hand. So that looks out. And is given"

"flighted outside off, defended back to him"

"flighted legbreak, pushed back to him"
"swept away from outside off, between the two men deep on the leg side. Gets a couple"
"wrong'un, pitched outside leg, Lyon has no clue about it as he defends. This is similar to Maxwell except that Maxwell went back and exposed his stumps. Here Lyon is hit on the pad, and this can't be given because this is pitched outside leg"

"nice drift and turn, a touch too full, and solidly defended back to him"

"tossed up, dipping on him, defended off the front foot"
"slightly short, and he goes back to punch this to deep point"
"this is when you need Kamran Akmal to tell you 'ghoomegi ghoomegi' [it will turn]. Lyon sweeps, gets a top edge, Umesh looks to field at long leg, but the ball turns away from him at the second bounce and slides away for four"
"smacked it. Solid clean sweep, between the two men deep on the leg side. All along the ground and too powerful for anyone to field"

down the wicket to drive this past the diving Ashwin for a single to long-off
"long half-volley, driven hard, but straight to mid-on"
"flighted outside off, defended back to Jadeja"
"<strong>sensational fielding from Jadeja but that produces four overthrows</strong>. Wade down the wicket, hits this hard, but to Jadeja's left. Jadeja lets the throw rip, which has Wade diving. Quick quick reaction from Jadeja. The half-volley throw bounces over Saha's glove"
"sharp turn, off the thigh pad to short leg"
"how long do you keep Jadeja out of action? He gets one now, kissing the off stump of Wade. Wade tries the big sweep in front of square, but misses the ball. It looks like it is in the slot for the shot, but has it drifted away? It squeezes under the bat, and takes the top of off. Wade is filthy with himself after having batted so well. Gestures he should be playing straight. More so because there are just 18 minutes to go to stumps"
"on a length, outside off, defended off the front foot"
"nice dipping delivery, doesn't turn as much as expected, and runs off the outside edge of a defensive bat to bring up the 300"
lovely outswinger first up. Beats his outside edge as he defends just outside off
"wide on the crease, another outswinger, and Lyon leaves it alone"
"and the inswinger claims Lyon. An innings without any reviews comes to an end. India will have to bat for about four minutes this evening. This is actually a good shot for a No. 10. Bhuvneshwar swings it in, he clips it away late, but fails to keep this down, and Pujara takes a good catch diving forward at midwicket"
"good carry for Hazlewood off a length. Left alone, but there is good swing"
"wide length ball, swings away and kicks away too. Left alone, and Saha collects it head high"
"fuller, closer to the stumps. A touch too straight. Pushed to mid-on"
"short of a length, just outside off, and it kicks and leaves him. Rahul does well to not jab at it"
"fuller outswinger, outside off, left alone"
and left alone outside off to end the over and the day's play
"and Vijay is off an running. Good pro-active running. Short of a length, soft hands, guides it in front of point, and the early call means they finish an easy single"
both batsmen are off the mark as Cummins slips a length ball down the leg side for a single
"wide length ball, left alone"
"short of a length, left alone outside off. No extravagant bounce"
"pitches one up, fifth-stump line, and left alone"
"angles one in, defended from the crease. No lateral movement for Cummins in his first over, neither in the air nor off the surface"
"clips away a straight length ball into the leg side, past midwicket, and Lyon puts in a big chase and saves a run with a slide"
"<strong>drops short of mid-off</strong>. Casual shot from Vjay. Is this the wake-up call he needed? Casual casual drive outside off. The ball stops at him, lobs in the direction of Warner at mid-off, and it falls short"
and now he is back to leaving them alone outside off
"bouncer, at him, and it flies. Vijay ducks under it. Wade collects it overhead"
"good carry from just short of a length outside off. Hazlewood would have wanted that spot to be fuller, though, because Vijay has left this alone"
"lovely shot. Vijay gets a big stride in to cover the line of the ball as Hazlewood pitches it further than that bare patch. He drives it on the up, keeping it down, and sending this scorching through the covers for four"
"length ball, angling in, defended to midwicket"
"pitched up full and wide, asking him to drive, but Rahul doesn't go for it"
"short of a length, on off, defended off the back foot"
"sharp short ball into the ribs, 142ks, Rahul jabs at it with his eye off. He is lucky this has not lobbed up. No short leg either"
"that is sharp. Really sharp. <strong>Bouncer at 147ks</strong>, at off and middle. Rahul does really well, takes his gloves out of the way and sways out with the top half of his body. Wade has to collect this overhead"
"short of a length, outside off, and left alone again. Good over: excellent bowling, good defensive batting"
"<b>lovely bowling</b>. Hits a crack on a full length just outside off. It seams away like a legcutter. Vijay is lucky not to get an edge on it. He has played the angle and looked to play through midwicket. If he had played straight, he would have edged this"
"similar length, slightly straighter. Defended to leg"
"straight length ball again, clipped to midwicket"
bouncer to mix it up. He doesn't want him coming forward to cover that length on that crack
"short of a length, no misbehaviour, defended off the back foot"
"<strong>hits the crack again</strong>. Vijay this time plays the line, and the ball deviates past the edge. That crack is fuller than good length and not quite a half-volley"
"Rahul fends, which is what Australia want him doing, but this one doesn't get up, and he keeps it out well"
"on a length, fifth-stump line, and left alone. India's openers seem they are up for the challenge of batting the new ball out even if they don't get the runs"
"short of a length, outside off, and this is good running. He drops this towards the covers with soft hands, and Vijay calls him early"
Wade stretching his body while collecting a bouncer down the leg side. Vijay ducks early
"too full, clipped away off the toes for one"
"wide length ball, left alone, and collected head high by Wade"
"on a length, swinging in, defended off the front foot"
"honing in on that crack just outside off. This one swings in, Vijay gets the stride in, and defends"
"full outswinger now. Wider than that crack. Vijay defeds with an open face to point. Vijay wants a single, but Rahul sees Maxwell there and sends Vijay back"
"wide length ball, left alone"
"bouncer, outside off, not too high, and Vijay sways out of its line"
"length ball, fifth-stump line, left alone after getting a stride in"
"and Rahul cashes in first ball. Lyon flights this wide, bowls it a touch too full, and he drives it between mid-off and cover. Excellent batting"
"flatter, quicker, and Rahul is waiting on the back foot to work this past short leg for one"
"full, middle and leg, defended back to him"
"full, dipping on him, defended to midwicket"
"on a length, middle and leg, again worked to midwicket"
goes back to work a full ball past midwicket for a single. Finds a way to miss that fielder
"wide length ball, left alone"
"slightly loose drive. There is a short cover in place, and he has managed to play this wide, but he has also played this away from the body. Australia shouldn't mind this one too much"
"slightly fuller, and Vijay gets a stride in before shouldering arms"
inside edge as he defends off the front foot. Might have hit the crack and seamed in
"<strong>half-volley to Wade</strong>. Again off that crack, fuller than good length, just outside off, and this time he takes the edge. Wade dives to his right, but it falls short"
"slightly too full, and defended solidly by Vijay"
"goes back to a length ball, gets an inside edge into the pad, but it falls safely"
"nice dip on this, Rahul ends up defending in front of his body"
"flighted outside off, clipped on the walk to midwicket"
goes back to defend a skiddy offbreak
"flighted nicely, overpitches, but this time Rahul finds the man at cover with his drive"
"flatter, on a length, Rahul goes back to defend"
"bouncer, outside off, easy to leave alone. Still getting it into the 140ks"
"and Hazlewood finally strikes. He has been testing this channel relentlessly. he has beaten the edge repeatedly, one edge has fallen short, and finally Vijay makes a mental error, pushing out in front of his body. The length ball deviates after pitching, deviating enough to take the edge. Wade takes a regulation catch. Vijay looks back when walking off. Words spoken? If yes, not a great sight after the spirit this Test has been played in. Watched the replays. No send-off. Just a long look at Vijay"
full outswinger first up. Pujara defends from the crease
"Hazlewood pitches right up to Pujara again, and he drives it through extra cover all along the ground. They need to test Pujara with the bounce, not swing"
"and he pulls the length back. And Pujara leaves it alone. On a length, outside off, and he shoulders arms"
"gives him a bouncer, but it slides down leg. Pujara ducks it"
"short of a length, into the body, down the leg side, and left alone"
"<strong>dropped at first slip</strong>. This has flown off a full length, taken the edge, and hits Renshaw's finger tips at first slip. Both the batsmen and the slip have been done in by the pace. This just flies after hitting a rogue patch. And he left it at 146ks out of his hand. This one wobbles late too. Posthumous swing. This is just rapid. It has reached the boundary in no time"
"length ball, no misbehaviour off the pitch. Defended"
solid front-foot defensive outside off
"full, outside off, defended solidly again"
"bouncer, at off, and Rahul sways out of its line. excellent stuff from Cummins"
"length ball, a set of stumps wide, left alone"
"fuller than good length, Pujara is forward to this and defends"
"on a length, around off, defended off the front foot"
"short of a length, wide, Pujara doesn't cut and rightly so, because this one bounces more than expected"
"short of a length, on off, defended from the crease"
"loose ball. Down the leg side. On a length, Turned away to long leg for one"
"and Pujara off the strike immediately, dropping a length ball wide of cover for one"
"short of a length, outside off, left alone for Wade to collect head high"
"fuller, around off, solidly defended back to him"
"short of a length, rib high, he sort of jabs at it, and keeps it down"
crazy bouncer. It chases him as Rahul is swaying out of its line. Nearly a replay of the Ranchi dismissal. Rahul manages to get his gloves out of the way this time
"short of a length, outside off, left alone"
"length ball, on off, slight extra bounce, defended off the front foot"
"tries the bouncer, but it stays low. Only rib high, and Pujara does well to duck underneath it in a hurry"
and now the length ball in that bare patch. Pujara does well to not play at it. Good carry again
"slightly fuller than good length, swings back in, defended off the front foot"
"short of a length, not too high, Pujara does well to keep this down with the bottom hand off"

"nice dip and some turn, defended to leg"
"goes back to a length ball, keeps it out"
"just short of a length, left alone after getting a stride in. Extra bounce excites them again"
"good running. A length ball holds its line, hits the outside half of his bat, and they charge through as this has gone to the left of cover"
"short of a length, outside off, left alone"
tries the bluff of the full ball. Rahul right behind it. Defends this to mid-on
"short of a length, rising towards the chest, Rahul rides the bounce and defends"
"on that barren patch, on a length, gets extra bounce but Rahul defends well"
"down the wicket, takes this on the half-volley, takes a single to long-on. This is where Rahane was refreshing. He cut those singles down with his fields yesterday"
top-edged sweep but into the gap in the leg side. The deep square leg was more long leg so Rahul is in no danger. Drags this from well outside off
stays back to defend a length ball
"good shot. Slightly risky but he was committed to this so it is difficult to catch these. He goes back to force a length ball. The outside edge flies wide of slip. Had he not gone ahead with the shot, this could have gone to hand"
the offbreak that doesn't turn. Hits the outside half of the bat as he defends
"flat length ball, stays back to defend this to leg"
"short of a length, into the ribs, fends this down with soft hands. Gets a single past short leg"
"good bouncer. At his body. Just a touch too high, and he ducks under it"
that leg slip is in play but he has fended this wide of the man. You can not say you are in control when he you fend blindly with a leg slip in place. This just goes wide of that man

"on a length, straight, from wide on the crease, defended back to him"

"shapes up to cut, but then sees it is not that short, and pulls out at the last moment. Precision batting"
"short of a length, wide outside off, left alone"

"wide length ball, better from Rahul this time. Leaves it alone"
"full and straight, 147ks, defended to leg with the angle"

"into the pads, Pujara keeps this down and places this wide of leg slip"

"bouncer, on off, Pujara sways out of its line"
"pitches up after the bouncer, but Pujara is right forward. Defends this to mid-on"
"wider on the crease, makes him play at a length ball that he is better off leaving. Pujara, though, plays it with soft hands and guides it to gully"
"flat, wide on the crease, defended off the back foot"
<strong>is that dropped?</strong> Not really but this goes for four byes. Turns off a length and stays low too. Squeezes between Wade's pads
calculated shot. Slog sweep from outside off. No deep midwicket in place so he is happy going against the gentle turn. Doesn't bother keeping it down
"slow in the air, dipping on him, defended back to him"
"flighted outside off, pushed to the left of square cover for one"
"flat, on a length, outside off, Pujara defends this back"
"extravagant drive to a length ball, is hit on the inside half of the bat, midwicket fields"

thick outside edge as he pushes outside off. Falls short of point. Is there turn for O'Keefe?
this one stays low as he goes back to defend
"wide on the crease, on off, defended from the crease"

"short of a length, into the body, played to midwicket"

"<strong>edges but short of slip</strong>. An uncharacteristic push to a length ball outside off. The outside edge is taken, and it falls well short of Renshaw"
<strong>half-volley to short cover</strong>. Loose drive to a wide length ball. Fails to keep it down. Lyon dives to his right at short cover. Rahul lucky again that it doesn't carry
"full, pushed to cover"
"short of a length, outside off, played with open face to gully"

"short of a length, rising towards the chest, Rahul fends, It falls towards cover"
"and Cummins has got Rahul. The India opener goes for the low-percentage hook to a red-hot bouncer. Rahul hooks from well outside off, and toe-ends it to cover. This is high-quality fast bowling, and Rahul loses his concentration. That third man has made him hook by blocking the ramp"
"on a length, Rahane defends from the crease"
<strong>Rahane nearly repeats Ranchi dismissal</strong>. That is a big mental error. Looks to ramp a bouncer with a fine third man in place. He is lucky he has made no contact. Pujara goes up and has a word with his captain
Rahane doesn't back away. Reminiscent of his pulling Johnson at MCG. Deliberately goes over midwicket for four. Avoids all the fielders for this bouncer
<strong>six off top edge</strong>. Rahane really lucky here. This is not even short enough to pull. Rahane seems to have made up his mind to pull whatever length it is. He gets a massive top edge tat flies over the keeper's head
and Pujara keeps on defending merrily

"Pujara down the wicket, drives this wide of mid-on, and takes a single"
"flighted outside off, defended off the front foot"

"short of a length, around off, defended back to him"

"full, on off, and he closes the face at the last moment for a single to leg"
"flat, from wide on the crease, defended back"
"slower in the air, defended watchfully to cover"
<strong>is this dropped?</strong> Rahane just can't help himself. He drives at one wide outside off. There is a puff of dust and turns past the outside edge. No edge but Wade doesn't collect it clenly

"flighted, slow in the air, defended off the front foot"
"<strong>appeal for lbw but the height seems to have saved Rahane</strong>. Perfect delivery, on off, turning back, past the inside edge, but it is bouncing too high. First real lbw appeal of the Test. Umpire's call on hitting wickets. No review taken anyway"

"flat, turning in, defended to short leg"
"lovely shot. Pujara breaks the shackles with a shot he can sleepwalk through. Down the wicket, takes this on the half-volley, drives this along the ground and between mid-on and midwicket. <strong>Another fifty for Pujara</strong>"

down the wicket to drive this to mid-on
"flat, outside off, defended to leg"
sharp turn from short of a length. Enough time for Pujara to recover and defend off the back foot
too quick and down the leg side. Pujara loves it there. uses all his pace to work it fine of backward square leg
"and Lyon has produced the wicket. Old-fashioned offspin bowling. Tosses this up wide, drifts it away, has Pujara defending it away from the body, the ball rips back in to hit the glove, then the pad, and then lob up to short leg. Huge wicket. The immovable Pujara has been removed"

"flighted outside off, defended off the front foot"
Ashwin moves forward as the ball drifts away from him. Uses his reach to defend it
"wide length ball, left alone, and more disconcerting carry for Wade. Smith has a laugh about it"
"bouncer, makes Wade fly again to keep byes down as Rahane lets this go outside off"

Ashwin calls the bluff by moving forward to a length ball and defending it solidly

"down the wicket again, reaches the pitch of the ball and drives it to mid-off"
"flighted on off, defended back but from the crease"
"flighted outside off, shimmies down to defend it"
that shimmy last ball might have produced the flatter delivery. Ashwin goes deep into the crease and punches at this. The thick outside edge goes past slip. This is well thought-out by the batsman

"down the wicket, reaches this on the half-volley and drives this to mid-on"

"<strong>given not-out for lbw </strong>but we have the first review of the match. Rahane pads up to a flighted delivery outside off. This one doesn't turn, comes back in with the angle, but not enough to be hitting the stumps. The on-field call stays"
"flighted outside off, defended off the front foot"
pads one away outside off. This one turns a little
"nice rip on that ball, full, middle and leg, defended off the front foot"
"goes back, lets the length ball turn, works it around the corner, gets a single"
"flighted outside off, defended off the front foot"

"flighted outside off, whipped away to deep midwicket"
"nice dip, turn and bounce, but from middle and leg, and hits him in the ribs. Clearly going down and bouncing over"
goes back to a flat length ball. Some turn there. Defended
and Ashwin is manufacturing his own length by going deep into the crease. Cuts this delivery. This is hardly a cutting length. Beats the man at point too. Excellent batting
turn and bounce from middle and off. Disturbs the top surface to. Goes off the glove for a single past slip
defended from the crease

"Ashwin looks to go back to a flatter delivery, the ball turns in sharply, making him defend"
"short of a length, easy single into the leg side"
"what a sharp catch. Smith returns the favour to Rahane after Rahane took that great catch to send Smith back. This is even better, I'd venture. Rahane stays back to a flat delivery. This is flat all right but quite full, which means it has less time to turn as much as Rahane expects it to. This bounces at him too. The outside edge flies sharply to slip, but his hands go up perfectly and pouch it. My word, if Lyon is done for a while, what a final kill this is"
sharp turn from a length. Ashwin does well to not follow it
defended wide of cover for one
"paddle sweep first ball. From middle and leg. wade goes 'oh my goodness'. Saha connects, gets a couple"
"slow in the air, right forward to defend this"
"looks to paddle sweep again, the ball bounces into Saha's face, they appeal for a leg-before, and it is not given. <b>Australia use their second review too</b>. This one pitches in line, and it has the minorest of disturbance on the Ultra Edge as it passes the top edge. They conclude there is no bat involved. The replay shows him hitting on the arm, and then the face. Hit in line, but the projection shows it is bouncing over the stumps. The not-out call stays"

more dip and turn. Saha goes back to keep it out
"<strong>huge shout for lbw as Saha pads up</strong>. Given not out. This one has turned in sharply, and he is hit high on the pad as he leaves this one alone. The bounce has saved him here. They don't review"
"full, pushed wide of cover for one"
another paddle sweep but again too straight. Hit on the pad again. Half a shout. But this one is missing leg
"flighted just outside off, defended off the front foot"
"<strong>appeal for catch behind the wicket</strong>. Smith has initiated the appeal, and the review. Saha is beaten comprehensively, and I think it is the bat hitting the ground that has created this sound and make him waste the review"
"flighted outside off, right forward to defend"
"flighted outside off, Saha strides forward and shoulders arms"
"Lyon has another big fish. Catches Ashwin on the back foot, and spins this past his inside edge. Ashwin has a chat with Saha, and reviews this decision. Ashwin caught on the wrong foot here. On a length, outside off, turns past the off stumps, we have an umpire's call on impact, and the ball is hitting the middle stump on projection. Lyon on a roll again"
"<strong>has he injured Wade now?</strong> Sharp turn from middle and off, past the outside off, hits Wade in the shoulder with sharp turn and bounce"

stays back to defend a length ball outside off
"stays back to a fullish delivery. Not much bounce, which means he can defend it well"
"nice loop, defended off the front foot"
"on a length, straight, defended"
"Jadeja leaves the crease, O'Keefe fires it in, and Jadeja defends"
"and Jadeja bats the way he knows to bat. Takes the long-on on, and sends this full ball sailing over the man. Comfortable six"
"flighted outside off, and he sensible places this in front of point for one"
"flat, middle and leg, defended back to him"
"lovely shot from Saha. Too full, Saha presses forward and places this between mid-off and cover"
"full, middle and leg, pushed to mid-on for one"
"lets this turn, goes deep into the crease, works this behind square for one"
"goes back to cut a flat delivery away, but finds the man at point"
"slower offbreak, left alone outside off"
stays back to defend a flat length ball
and Jadeja shows he can smack the world conqueror for a six. Goes back to pull a short ball over wide long-on. That's 1000 Test runs for Jadeja
"wide length ball, left alone"
"cuts him in two. On a length, outside off, seams back in, past the inside edge, and Wade collects this chest high"
"wide length ball, left alone"
"wide length ball, left alone again"
"on a length, on off, hits the outside half of the bat as he defends"
"<strong>dropped by Renshaw at first slip</strong>. This is much easier than the one he put down in the morning. Again a perfect full delivery. Saha pushes at it, gets a genuine edge, goes about rib high to Renshaw, who gets both hands to it, but the ball pops out. Again a late wobble with the seam parallel to the ground, but Renshaw will be filthy with himself for this one"
"full, down the leg side, and again Jadeja misses out"
"shapes back in, flicked across the line, but straight to midwicket"
"shapes back in again, defended off the back foot by Jadeja"
"this one angles away, defended with an open face by Jadeja"
"really full, just outside off, dug out for a single straight of mid-off"
kicks at Saha who has to take the bottom hand off as he defends this length ball
"Wade saves three leg-byes. This one is flying off Jadeja's thigh pad, but wade dives to his right to get a glove to it"
"short of a length, a set of stumps wide, left alone"
"full ball outside off, but this time Saha doesn't push at it"
and he leaves another length delivery outside off
goes for the really full one first up. Saha keeps it out
"full and straight, clipped to midwicket by Saha"
"full ball, swinging in, misses the inside edge, but it is going down the leg side. India get a leg-bye"
"wide outswinger, Saha covers it, drives with an open face, but straight to point"
"slightly short of that driving length, and Saha leaves it alone outside off"
"wide on the crease, Saha leans forward, but doesn't play the angle. The outswinger is allowed to sail through harmlessly"
"short of a length, into the body, worked behind square on the leg side for one"
big lbw shout again but Hazlewood doesn't have his line right against Jadeja. Sliding down leg for a leg-bye
<strong>Erasmus has given him first ball but Jadeja reviews it immediately</strong>. And Jadeja is right. The bat hits the back pad to create that sound. This length ball seams back in and past Jadeja's drive. The UltraEdge shows nothing on the bat. Clear daylight visible. Overturned without fuss
"on a length, outside off, slight shape back in, and he has left it alone this time"
<strong>big lbw appeal</strong>. Not given. Has this come back enough to be pitching within the stumps and also hitting the stumps? Replays show this has pitched outside leg. Good call from Erasmus
"full sucker ball outside off, Jadeja plays a loose drive, and is lucky to not edge it"
"<strong>inside edge saves him</strong>. This one nips back in and hits his back pad, but he has got an inside edge"
"really full delivery swinging back in, and Jadeja is equal to it, keeping it out"
"wide length ball, shapes away, left alone by Saha"
"nice drive off the front foot, but Australioa have a deep point to keep this down to two"
"this one goes like a legcutter, from a length, just outside off, and Saha does well to not follow it with the bat"
"full and wide, swinging away, Saha gets a stride in and leaves it alone"
"bouncer, well outside off, Saha stays under it. Easy to avoid when it is outside off"
"wide on the crease, bowls an outswinger against the angle, makes him play, but Saha covers the movement well"
"lovely shot from Jadeja. Cummins looks for that full ball swinging back in, and Jadeja gives it the full face, driving it between the umpire and the non-striker"
"short of a length, straight, defended with his weight on his toes"
"short of a length, straight, hits him high on the pad. Jadeja's weight is back again. Ripe for a length ball just outside off"
"Cummins bowls the lbw ball on a length, Jadeja's weight is back, but the bat comes down in time"
"short of a length, outside off, left alone"
this one seams away from a length just outside off. Jadeja still caught with his weight back. Lucky not to edge it
"short of a length, outside off, left alone"
"on a length, just outside off, pushed to short cover"
"bouncer, middle and leg, sending Saha back. Wade has to collect it overhead"
"slides a length ball down the leg side, concedes a leg-bye"

"full, just outside off, pushed to mid-off"
"bouncer, Saha ducks it, and again almost bursts through Wade's gloves. Just keeps rising all the time"
"wide on the crease, Saha opens the face on a length ball to guide it to the left of deep point for a couple"
"short of a length, Saha pushes at it outside off, and is beaten on the outside edge. The ball holds its line slightly"
"length ball, just outside off, extra bounce, and Saha defends with the bottom hand off"
"short of a length, rib high, these are the ones you can glove to the keeper, but Jadeja gets his hands out of the way and watches it go under his armpit"
"on a length, outside off, pushed forward of third man, and they call back for the second. Good calling and running"
"on a length, on off, defended off the back foot"
"full, outside off, pushed to cover"
"bouncer, at his body, Jadeja ducks it"
"appeal for lbw but pitched outside leg, and they concede a leg-bye"
"short, into the body, fended away"
appeal for a leg-before but this has pitched outside leg. Too short for it to pitch within and also hit the stumps
"serious wheels on that. Short of a length, into the ribs, but Jadeja gets inside the line and raises his hands up to avoid it"
"the sucker ball outside off, and left alone. Jadeja doing well here"
"the lbw ball, straight length ball shaping back in. Defended from the crease"
"digs this in short, rising towards the chest, and Jadeja gets tall to fend it down"
"low full toss, driven to long-on for a single. <strong>Deficit under 40</strong>"
"flighted outside off, driven to deep cover for a single"
"this offbreak dips on him, but Saha clips him away to deep square leg for one"
"flighted outside off, pushed to the right of Maxwell at cover, but they don't take him on"
"full, drifting in, pushed to mid-on"
"and Jadeja takes Lyon on. This is a seriously good innings from Jadeja. Is he doing a Pune-like Starc here? He has hit a length ball against the turn, and has sent it sailing over long-on"
"on a length, straight, defended back to Cummins"
"edged, but soft edge, and past gully, and they get a couple despite a Saha slip on the turn. He reaches 1000 Test runs, deficit is under 30 now. Also fifty for this stand"
"short of a length, outside off, pushed towards deep point for one"
"lovely shot. Full, wide and fast, driven well in front of deep point, gets an easy three"
"bouncer, at him, and Saha ducks it"
and everything going for India now. Saha edges this past gully for four. Soft hands make sure it goes down. India have added 31 in nine overs this morning. Excellent batting once again from the lower middle order
"tossed up outside off, and Jadeja places this forward of point to pinch a single"
"Lyon gets the length right now. Short of driving length for Saha and he hits the pad, but is headed down leg"
"appeal for short-leg catch, but seems to have come straight off the pad. Replays confirm that"
bounce from a length outside off. That's an overpinner. Wade has tough time collecting this
"flighted high, clipped to short midwicket"
"nice dip and turn from outside off, defended off the back foot. Lyon bowls a much better over"
"<strong>huge lbw shout, not given on the field, and I don't think we have tracking available right now</strong>. Swinging back in to hit him on the pad, but it has pitched just outside leg. Good decision. Not reviwed"
"pitched up, driven hard, but straight to mid-off"
"Jadeja flays at a shortish ball outside off. He lashes it to third man for four. That is what frustrates you with Jadeja. He can look out of touch, and then unfurl such shot"
"<strong>and immediately he nearly gets him</strong>. A length ball seams back in, past the inside edge, and over the stumps. The bounce here saves Jadeja. A long hard stare from Hazlewood"
"on a length, outside off, defended from the crease"
"on a length, shaping back in, defended off the front foot"
"too full, and he lets Saha off. He just pushes it down to long-on for an easy single"

"another bouncer, straight at him, and Saha ducks it again"
"short of a length, outside off, left alone"
"nice drift into him, defended off the front foot"
"turn again after dipping. Hits the edge, but it goes between slip and silly point"
"<strong>edged and past slip again</strong>. Everything going India's way here. This one turns from just outside off. Has Jadeja committed. he stabs at it, following the turn, but the edge goes wide of slip. Jadeja into the 40s"

"wide length ball, left alone outside off"

"full and just outside off, defended to mid-off"
flat fast offbreak outside off. Jadeja leaves it alone
"short, and he goes back to cut it away to deep point"
"nicely played by Saha. Goes back, lets this length ball turn and bounce, and then works it around the corner"
"nice drift into the pads, he is excited, but Jadeja gets enough bat on it to get a single to leg"
goes back to a length ball. Lyon gets turn and bounce. Defended
"swept away from outside off, gets a single"
"errors creeping in now. A length ball down the leg side, easy single for Saha"
"length ball outside off, extra bounce, left alone"
"length ball, swinging back in, looking for that lbw, but Jadeja gets the bat down in time and places it square of midwicket for one"
"bouncer, Saha's knees are on the floor as he ducks it"
"full, swinging away, Saha equal to it in defence"
"<strong>has the inside edge saved him?</strong>. Review from Australia. Is this a desperate attempt? It is. Clear inside edge there. Australia have no reviews left. This is a really good ball nonetheless. Hits the crack, on a length, seams back in, hits him flush in front, but Saha has got an inside edge. These two have frustrated Australia"
"tull full, drilled to mid-on, a bit of a misfield there from Renshaw, and they get the single"
and right back to work a length ball around the corner. Smith needs a backward short leg here
"flighted outside off, defended off the front foot"
"flight and dip, opens the face, gets a single in front of point. And there is another fielding error to make this two. <strong>India in lead</strong>"
"tossed up outside off, defended to cover"
<strong>the sword is out again</strong>. The dressing room is on its feet. Pushed square of cover for a sharp single. What an incredible fifty. Mix of patience and calculated assault. There is a final flourish to this sword dance. Shows how important he rates it. And he exults in the end too
"full and wide, left alone"
"dip on him, defended to cover"
"flighted outside off, drilled to long-off for one"
"on a length, defends an offbreak to short leg"
"low full toss, swept to long leg"
"full, outside off, pushed forward of point for a single"
"<strong>hit on the helmet</strong>. Jadeja looks to hook this 140k bounce, early into the hook, is hot on the left arm and then onto the helmet. Jadeja shows no discomfort"
"sharper quicker bouncer, and Jadeja shapes up to hook before leaving. The best way to leave this alone"
"and Jadeja hammers this in for Australia. This short ball is not too high, and he is in position to hook. Over midwicket he goes. This is like his innings at Lord's in 2014"
"and Jadeja still hooks. Not in entire control, but he has got his fourth six of the innings. Head-high bouncer at 145ks, top-edged fine of long leg. Jadeja taking the risks and they are paying off"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"short of a length, at him, pushed to cover. is there another word at him? Jadeja just smiles"
"short ball, Saha goes back to pull, but this one spins sharply. Saha plays this back to Maxwell"

"short ball, he goes back to punch it to deep cover"
"full, driven to short straight midwicket"
"overpitched again, driven to cover"
"flighted outside off, Saha right forward to smother the turn"
"the bluff from Cummins. Bowls the wide length ball after bowling short for a long time. Jadeja drives at it with no feet. He is expecting a bouncer. He throws his hands at this, away from the body, and gets a thick inside edge back onto the stumps. But what an innings from Jadeja. He has got India's noses ahead, and has frustrated Australia"
"on a length, just outside off, defended from the crease"
"bouncer, from wide on the crease, Bhuvneshwar sways out of its line"
"full and fast, and Bhuvneshwar right behind it. This is proper technique from India's No. 9"
"length ball, down the leg side, good pace, carried in front of the face by Wade"
"short of a length, straight, defended off the back foot"
"flighted on off, defended off the front foot"
solid front-foot defensive
down the wicket to drive this to deep cover for one
"nice dip and turn, gets a soft edge, wide of silly point"
"loose drive from Bhuvneshwar, and a sharp catch from Smith again. O'Keefe tosses this up wide, Bhuvneshwar drives on the up and away from the body. The edge is taken, and Smith takes a quick sharp offering. O'Keefe has a wicket in his first over of the day"
"full, on off, defended back to O'Keefe"
"what a great catch from Smith. He is doing it all by himself here. Brute from Cummins to get the resolute Saha off. Short of a length, rises at his face, and because it has reared off from this length, Saha has to take evasive action. The shoulder of the bat is hit, and the ball looks like it is flying over Smith at second slip. He rushes back and takes it one-handed behind his body and over his head. And while he is coming down, the ball tries to slip out of his hand, but he regains control of it with his whole body out of balance. Australia staying alive now"
"full and straight, nearly a yorker, kept out by Umesh"
"and Umesh is off the mark. Short of a length, into the body, tucked away off the hip"
"five runs there for India without any bat or body involved. This bouncer just keeps flying, and Wade goes over head, and gets just one hand on it. Not enough to keep this in"
"bouncer, he ducks into it. The ball is still rising as Wade collects it"
"length ball, angling in, pushed to vacant mid-on region to get off the mark in Test cricket"
"short of a length, outside off, left alone"
"Kuldeep shows he has a first-class hundred to his name as he nails this sweep from outside off, all along the ground, for four through square leg"
"<strong>bat-pad but through vacant backward short leg</strong>. Kuldeep defends in front of his body, gets the edge, but is lucky"
"slow, full, pushed back to him"
"turn and bounce, but slow, and Kuldeep defends well"
well forward to defend a slow full delivery
"on a length, straight, defended to mid-on"
"short of a length, wide outside off, he has a half-hearted waft. Beaten"
"beauty from Cummins. Short of a length, just outside off, holds its line, beats the edge"
"and Umesh gets off strike. He is batting sensibly here. Short of a length, guided to third man"
"on a length, on off, pushed to cover"
"short of a length, hip high, worked past short leg for another single. The leaded goes past 30. Every run hurting Australia. Every run scored here means one fewer India need to get when batting last"
"well done Wade. He has had a hard time with posthumous swing here. Balls wobbling late. This one, though, is about reach and athleticism. Short of a length, down the leg side, it keeps going. Wade flies to his left to make a one-handed collection"
"on a length, straight, defended"
"flighted outside off, defended off the front foot"
"on a length, straight, defended back to him"
"full, middle and leg, defended to short leg"
"down the wicket, reaches the pitch of the ball, drives this to long-on"
"roundarm, not looking to spin it, defended back to him"
"five-for for Lyon. Kuldeep sweeps from outside off, and he gets a massive top edge. A superb catch in the deep by Hazlewwod. It looks easy on TV. He has judged this perfectly, goes to his right, and takes it overhead a couple of feet inside the fence"
"on a length, swing away from him after pitching middle and leg. Guided to gully with an open face"
""
"<strong>four off the edge</strong>. Renshaw is squared up as this full ball swings away from him. Soft hands mean the edge goes straight to ground, and finds that gap between the three slips and gully to perfection"
"another swinging-away delivery, left alone. is he setting him up for the one that comes back in?"
"short of a length, outside off, angles away, played with an open face to gully. Along the ground"
"full, outside off, defended with an open face after covering the line"
"<strong>slashed away</strong>. He has edged it, and there is a square third man in place. He has taken his chance, and it has come off, but not the safest of shots, looking to cut up and over with the third man in place"
"short of a length, outside off, punched straight of cover for a single"
"<strong>beauty there</strong>. Looks like this will swing in, but pitches on a length, just outside off, and seams away. Renshaw has to play the swing, and the seam beats the edge. Lucky not to edge it"
"wide length ball, and left alone this time. Collected head high by Saha"
"<strong>what a take by Saha</strong>. Umesh shows India fast bowlers can bounce too. Renshaw in a right tangle. He is saving his face with his gloves in front. The bouncer keeps flying, and misses his glove. Saha flies and bends behind him to make a one-handed collection and save four byes here"
"short of a length, just outside off, left alone, and collected head high by Saha"
"<strong>nearly gone</strong>. This has taken off from nowhere. This has hit a crack, jusn short of a length, and gone off like it would on a trampoline. Warner is hit on the chest as he is off the feet and fending. Just over the heart"
"<strong>Nair has dropped Warner again. At third slip again. Diving to his left again</strong>. Short of a length, outside off, angling away, shoulder of the bat, Nair dives to his left, and Rahane from gully almost gets the rebound. Rahane ends up diving too far actually and is hit on the wrist. Mind you, Nair is a highly rated slips fielder at first-class level. Getting up too early or picking the ball late?"
"bouncer, and Warner ducks it"
"and this one shoots through. Left alone outside off, and bounces well in front of Saha"
"short of a length, down the leg side, Renshaw misses out on runs"
"short of a length, outside off, opens the face to guide it to gully."
"this drop from Nair doesn't hurt India too much. Australia minus-22 for 1. Perfect delivery. This is on a length, shaping up to swing back in, lands just outside off, and seams away after pitching. Warner has to pay at it. Not sure he has to drive at it as hard as he has done here. His outside edge kisses the seam of the ball as it passes him. Great seam bowling. Late wobble too for Saha, but he adjusts well. Nair gets pats on his back"
"Smith gets inside the line of a straight length ball, and clips it past square leg for four. Easy peasy"
"short of a length, straight, worked to leg for a single"
"short of a length, straight, defended from the crease"
"length ball, straight, defended off the back foot"
"he ducks into a bouncer that stays low, and gets him on the forearm. All happening here, and Australia are looking unsettled"
"short of a length, outside off, defended back to him"
shuffles across and leaves alone a wide outswinger
"inswinger, excites the bowlers as he shuffles across, but he manages to whip this to deep midwicket"
"on a length, outside off, defended from the crease"
seams back in from short of a length and hits him on the thigh pad. Batting not getting any easier
"<strong>beaten outside off</strong>. Again some seam from a full length outside off. He pushes at it, and is beaten"
"on a length, just outside off, defended off the back foot"
"short of a length, outside off, left alone"
"short of a length, takes this from outside off, places it to the left of fine leg, and comes back for two"
"length ball, set of stumps outside off, left alone. That is the line to bowl to Smith"
"bouncer outside off, Smith shapes up for the hook, but drops his wrists and moves out of the way at the last moment"
"on a length, slight seam back in from outside off, defended off the back foot"
"on a length, straight, making him play. Renshaw defends off the back foot"
"length ball outside off, left alone"

"full and angling in again, and while on the crease, Renshaw defends well"
"bouncer, Renshaw sees it early and ducks it"

"straight length ball, whipped away, and there is a deep square leg to keep this down to one"
"full, on off, defended from the crease"
"short of a length, just outside off, defended from the crease"
"good stop by Vijay at second slip. Renshaw pushing away from body, <strong>gets an edge that falls well short of second slip</strong>. This is how he got out in Ranchi"
"short of a length, into the ribs, Renshaw gets inside the line and helps it along, using his pace for four to fine leg. Long leg a touch too square"
"short of a length, outside off, he rises with the bounce and plays this to gully with soft hands"
"amazing shot. Cracking. Pulls this from outside off, and from short of a length, and pulls it all along thr ground, behind square on the leg side. Gets four for it"
"wide length ball, and Smith covers the line and swings square with an open face. There is a square third man in place, but he has no chance here"
"bowled him. One short of 500 runs this series. One short of India's lead. This is just massive. Don;t think this is a part of a plan. Bhuvneshwar bowls another hit-me short ball, Smith hits it, but it doesn't quite come on, and he gets a bottom edge that flattens the off stump. Bhuvneshwar is pumped up. Much like Prasad was after flattening Sohail's off stump in 1996. Is this the Test and the series? Should have cut it, Smith's gesture after the wicket suggests"
"short of a length, straight, pushed to mid-on"
"on a length, outside off, defended off the back foot"
"wide length ball, defended"
"bouncer, right at his head, this is climbing steeply, and Renshaw does well to avoid it"
"Umesh has got one more. India are running away with this here. Great bowling. No matter how good you are, if the short bowling is so fast and so good, you are going to make a mental error. This is short of a length, rising into the chest, and he is squared up and fends at it. Saha does the rest after the edge"
"Maxwell looks to avoid a short ball, it stays low, hits him on the arm, and goes for a leg-bye. Batsmen have been given out lbw for this in the past"
"on a length, straight, defended off the back foot"
"bouncer, at him, and he gets under it"
"wide length ball, left alone"
"short of a length, straight, worked away to leg. <strong>Australia in lead</strong> but have lost three wickets"
"<strong>beauty</strong>. Unplayable. Short of a length, just outside off, Handscomb has to play the angle, but this seams away and kicks away. Collected head high by Saha. Misses the edge by inches"
"fuller, Handscomb is caught on the crease, but pushes this to mid-on"
"bouncer, outside off, wide, and left alone"
"nice shot. Short of a length, wide outside off, he goes across to it to guide it past the gully. Along the ground"
"on a length, outside off, defended off the back foot"
"short of a length, straight, punched to mid-on"
"bouncer, middle and leg, at his shoulder. Maxwell does well to get inside its line"
which is why Maxwell is not hooking. Gets inside the line of another bouncer
"wide length ball, Maxwell drives on the up, not bothering about keeping it down, knowing the field is set for short bowling. Gets four through cover"
and with the shot leg out he fends one towards that position for a single
"wide length ball, left alone. Umesh still rapid"
"beautiful shot. Short of a length, wide, he gets right behind it, on his toes, and punches it between cover and mid-off. All along the ground"
"fuller, closer to off, defended off the front foot"
"that is beautiful batting. Just a sensational punch shot. He goes back to a shortish ball, and this time he beats the man at cover to his left. Beats the square third man to his right"
"nearly repeats itself. Bhuvneshwar pitches it up, gets some back in, Maxwell drives big and gets an inside edge onto the pad"
"on a length, just outside off, defended off the front foot"
"short of a length, just outside off, defended off the back foot"
"on a length, dip outside off, runs off the outside half of the bat for one"

"drifting this away and turning it back in, defended off the front foot"
"down the wicket, reaches its pitch, and defends it back to Kuldeep"
"wrong'un, picks it off the pitch, and punches it down to mid-on. Not sure he is picking him out of the hand yet"
turn first up. He loves planting that doubt. Defended off the back foot
"slower in the air, outside off, left alone this time"
"too full, driven down the ground, but India have the mid-on up to plug the single"
"slow in the air, dipping on him, defended back to him"
"flighted outside off, nicely driven with the turn, but straight to short cover"
"tossed up outside off, driven to deep cover for one"
"down the wicket, drives this with the turn, but India still have the mid-on up to plug the single"
"down the wicket again, this time he beats that short straight midwicket to his right for one to deep midwicket"
"lovely shot. Too full from Kuldeep, Maxwell gets to the pitch of the ball, and drives it between mid-off and cover. All along the ground. <strong>Has he picked the wrong'un here?</strong>"
and now he picks the regulation legbreak and goes over mid-on. Twice with the spin he goes. Flat six from Maxwell
"wrong'un, this time he has picked it from the pitch, nut he gets behind it in defence. Similar to how he got out in the first innings, but covers the stumps this time"
"full, middle and off, defended to cover"
"full, on off, driven back to Jadeja"
"wide on the crease, angling into the pads, defended to leg"
"nice dip on this, defended off the front foot"
"flighted outside off, pushed to mid-off"
"nice dip on this length ball, Handscomb has to come forward to defend"
"<strong>edged</strong>. Turn and bounce, too thick an edge for India's liking as Handscomb pushes at this outside off. Off the shoulder of the bat it goes, between silly point and slip"
stays back to defend a length-ball legbreak
"short from Kuldeep, and he goes back to punch this against the turn, and left of cover for four. Regulation legbreak this"
"legbreak, coming back in, defended to short straight midwicket"
"wrong'un, just a touch too full, and Maxwell defends it even though he hasn't picked it early"
<strong>pulled uppishly to short midwicket</strong>. Topspinner from Kuldeep. Upright seams there. Another trick from his back. Hurries Maxwell up. He is lucky this doesn't carry to Jadeja at short midwicket
"flighted up now, and defended back to Kuldeep"
"nice dip, middle and off, some turn, and defended back"
"drift and dip again, defended to leg, but hit on the inner half of the bat"
goes back to defend a length ball. Does well
"<strong>uppish drive</strong>. Jadeja teases him outside off, and he drives it in the air to short cover. He is lucky this has bounced just short"
"<strong>Handscomb lives dangerously on</strong>. Goes back to this shortish ball, there is turn and bounce for Jadeja, but Handscomb goes ahead with the shot, and the outside edge is strong enough for it to carry over slip"
"<b>the non-turner now</b>. How do you bat against Jadeja? This one is tossed up on off, and out of natural variation this goes straight on, and misses Hnadscomb's inside edge. Also misses the stumps. Great take from Saha"
Maxwell goes back to defend a length ball
"flighted, and he is out of his crease. Drives this to cover"
"short of a length, straight, <strong>keeps low</strong>, and Maxwell does well to get an outside edge on it"
"sharp turn from outside off, runs off the inside edge past short leg for one"

goes back to defend a regulation orthodox legbreak
"down the wicket, defends after getting beaten in the air"

"full, outside off, pushed back to Ashwin"
"down the wicket, beaten in flight, defends to point"

goes back to defend a length-ball offbreak
"sharp turn from outside off, but the bounce and turn means there is no lbw shout"
"overpitched outside off, driven to the right of deep cover. Vijay puts in a diving save to save two runs"
"on a length, defended off the front foot. Hits him high on the bat"
driven on the up as he pitches this on a length and outside off. Gets a single to deep cover
<strong>shooter</strong>. Squeezes under his bat as he goes back. Fourth-stump line there. Saha sensational again in saving byes
goes back to defend a length ball again
"flighted outside off, pushed into the shin of silly point"
"swept away hard, <strong>straight into Pujara at short leg</strong>. Maxwell checks on Pujara, who is all right"
"<strong>dangerous sweep</strong>. From the line of off, gets this wide of short leg this time"
"<strong>that's another beauty from Rahane</strong>. Smith and Rahane are outdoing each other at slip. This is a length ball, outside off, hits the bare patch and refuses to turn. What it also does is takex extra bounce, and flies off the edge. Rahane is falling behind, adjusting for this quick offering, and takes it two handed. Great reflexes, great hands"
"full, down the leg side, even Saha can't catch up with this"
"on a length, on off, stops at him, defended uppishly"
"drift into the pads, runs for a single off the inside half of his bat"

stretches forward to defend this back to him

"on a length, no turn, hits the outside half of the bat"
stays back to defend a length ball
"length ball, into the pads, flicked away with hard hands, gets a single into the leg side"
"<strong>big big lbw shout but is it high?</strong> Not given, but India review it. On a length, an offbreak that hits a crack and goes straight on instead of turning. Hits him on the flap, above the knee roll. Height is the only question here. Ball tracking shows this is umpire's call on the top of middle stump. The not-out call stays"
"drift into the pads, defended to leg"
"tossed up outside off, Wade forward to defend it"
stays back to defend a length ball outside off
"short of a length, into the pads, and Rahane has a short fine leg to plug that single and the paddle sweep"

dangerous shot. Sweeps a full ball from the stumps. He has managed to connect this but Jadeja won't mind it
stays back to defend a length ball
"<strong>sharp turn and a big appeal</strong>. Dips on him, turns past the outside edge, and not given. Saha also whips the bails off. Checking for the stumping, but he is in"
"tossed up, on off, defended in front of his body"
right forward to defend this and end the over
"non-turning offbreak, Wade is playing the line and defending in front of the pad to avoid the lbw"
late defensive. Not forward enough. Gets a bottom edge
better defence this time
"flat length ball, outside off, punched to cover-point"
"he is leaving this alone but the ball goes straight on to hit his bat. Hits the middle of his bat, and this goes to slip on the bounce"
"<strong>wide of gully</strong>. Ashwin tosses this up to tease him, Wade has a hard drive at it, and the thick edge goes wide of gully. Nair from point gives it a spirited chase, manages to keep it in with a desperate dive, but the momentum of the ball trickles it into the skirting"

"flighted outside off, defended back to Jadeja"
"down then wicket, pushes this to cover after getting beaten in the air"

defends a length ball outside off
<strong>big lbw appeal as this one doesn't turn</strong>. Seems to have hit him outside the line. Not given. Rightly so. But the ball is doing crazy things off this pitch
"flighted outside off, nice drift, draws him into a push away from his body, the soft outside edge goes wide of slip"
"quicker from Ashwin, defended off the back foot"
"brain fade from Maxwell? He has padded up to one outside off. No shot offered, the umpire confirms. Maxwell reviews the out decision. He has padded up to a fullish offbreak outside off. This is a massive break in concentration. This is a big offbreak, looks like it could even miss leg, but desperately for Maxwell it returns an umpire's call on the leg stump. One centimetre of the ball hitting the leg stump there. The on-field call stays"

"flatter, on a length, defended to short leg"
"down the wicket, beaten in the air as Jadeja tosses it up wide. He stabs at it to prevent a stumping"

turn and bounce again to hit him on the thigh pad
defends a length ball to leg. Wade hanging in for dear life
"short of a length, Cummins lets it hit his thigh pad"
"cuts him in two. Cummins is late on this. Just short of a length, nips back in, and he is late on the defence. <b>The bounce saves Cummins</b>"

"short of a length, outside off, left alone"
"brave leave. Full ball, fifth-stump line, and Cummins shoulders arms"
"wide on the crease, short of a length, outside off. Left alone again. Brave leave again"
inside edge onto the pad but forward of short leg. There is turn and bounce
"full, middle and leg, driven to long-on for one"
defended off the front foot. Hit high on the bat
"beautiful bowling to a lower-order batsman. Toss it up, tease them, draw a drive, turn it to take the edge, and watch your captain and swallow another catch"
nice dip and turn past the outside edge. O'Keefe ends up defending well in front of the body
and this one is closer to the stumps and goes straight on. O'Keefe gets the inside half of the bat on it
"short of a length, outside off, left alone, and Saha still collecting it head high"
"full, just outside off, pushed to mid-off"
"on a length, straight, defended back to him"

"short of a length, straight, defended back to him"
"wide length ball, left alone"
"flighted on off, defended back to him"
"what a catch by Pujara at silly point. This is straight off the bat. Not off the bat and pad. O'Keefe defends in front of his body, the ball bounces at him, goes to silly point's left off the shoulder of the bat. Pujara sticks his left hand out. The ball props up, and he gets his both hands around before the ball can touch the helmet grille"
"on a length, outside off, defended back to him"
"flat, middle and off, pushed back to Jadeja"
"slower in the air, dipping on hi, drawing a drive, beats the edge"
"wide on the crease, full, angling in, defended"
"on a length, outside off, pushed towards point for a single"
beats the outside edge. This ball is still doing things for the quicks. Beats the outside edge after holding its line outside off
"and second slip takes the catch. A meek push to a length ball outside off, and Vijay laps it up at second slip. Sharp catch. India one strike away"
Hazlewood looks to sway out of the line and ramp a short ball. Misses
"full and straight, defended to mid-on by Hazlewood"
"dug in, Hazlewood backs away and fends it to deep point. Wade turns down the single. Wants to face Jadeja"
slog-sweeps one to deep midwicket. Turns down the single
"down the wicket, pushes it to cover"
"down the wicket again, makes room this time, and lofts this over cover for a six. Wade playing to the plan. Defend till nine-down and then hit"
"sweeps this hard, gets a couple square of deep midwicket"
"short of a length, on off, drops this into the leg side for a single. One ball for Hazlewood to defend"
"full, on off, defended back to him"
<strong>dropped by Ashwin</strong>. He doesn't pick it. Cut away outside off. Gets an edge. Late wobble? Ashwin upright too early. Put down. That is a fact
"walks at him, pushes a shortish ball to leg"
"full, outside off, driven hard to mid-off"
"lovely drive on the up, but again he finds extra cover. Good fielding placement again. Cover is straighter here"
"short and wide, drilled away to deep point for four. The lead goes past 100"
"short of a length, pulled wide of mid-on, Rahane's misfield there converts this into two. Ideally wade doesn't want two because this is the last ball of the over. He has rushed back thinking he can get three, but Rahane is really quick"
"on a length, on off, dead-batted"
"slow in the air, Hazlewood defends, hit on the glove"
"what a sharp catch by Vijay at gully. They are checking with the third umpire. Soft signal is out. <strong>And has Vijay has dropped this?</strong>. Yes he has. Vijay is coming back from the dressing room. He must be taking has pads off. This one is low to gully as Hazlewood edges, Vijay catches it, but he grasses it. He doesn't get his fingers in. Or so the third umpire rules. Vijay claims he has his finger under it"
"carrom ball outside off, left alone"
"another appeal, given again, and Hazlewood has reviewed this one. Will this innings resume again? Seems like this has been given out caught at silly point. No edge, though. This has hit him on the knee roll in front of off. They check the lbw too. This has returned umpire's call for height on middle stump. The on-field decision remains, which means the umpire must have given him out lbw on the field"
"on a length, just outside off, Rahul defends off the middle of the bat"
"<strong>desperate desperate for Cummins</strong>. Straight ball, holds its line, looks like he is getting an lbw, but the bat comes down and the outside edge goes between the slips and gully"
"lovely shot. Rahul has hit two of the 27 required. Half-volley, just outside off, punched to the right of mid-off for a four"
"bouncer from wide on the crease, Rahul drops his gloves and sways out of its line"
"and is that the third of the 27 boundaries India need to regain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy? A length ball, into the pads, nicely clipped away. Rahul might send a thank-you note later"
"bouncer, Rahul is expecting it, he breaks his back leg, and gets under it"
"full, outside off, defended with an open face"
"full, on off, Vijay solid in defence behind it"
"wide length ball outswinger, Vijay follows it, hits uppishly towards point, and Maxwell misfields on the dive, allowing two runs"

"lovely shot. Full, middle and off, and he clips it with the angle, between mid-on and midwicket, comes back for three"

"length ball, into the pads, clipped to midwicket"
"offcutter, or so it seems, Rahul defends with the bottom hand off"
"<strong>beats the edge</strong>. Seams away from a length, he pushes at it, and is lucky not to edge it"
"wide length ball, collected head high by Wade as Vijay leaves it alone"
"on a length, extra bounce, hits the shoulder of the bat as Vijay defends"
"bouncer, middle and leg, makes him duck it"
"short of a length, outside off, cuts away, left alone"
"length ball, beats the inside edge, appeal for lbw but it is headed down leg. Not given, and somebody <strong>has talked Smith into wasting this review</strong>. Missing leg, replays show. That is just desperate captaincy"
<strong>sharp turn</strong> and massive bounce. Imagine if Australia had 50 more to play with. Rahul defends at a full new ball and it rips past his outside edge
goes back to defend a slow length ball
"wide on the crease, flat trajectory, Rahul defends from the crease"
stays back to defend another length ball
"tossed up outside off, defended solidly off the front foot"
and Rahul keeps it out with a defensive off the back foot
"full, down the leg side, and Vijay misses out on runs. Just a little late in an attempt to clip it"
"on a length, swinging in towards off, defended back to Hazlewood"
"short of a length, straight, defended to leg"
"<strong>big big low shout</strong>. Hear two sounds, and even if it is pad first, the impact must be outside. Not given. Not reviewed. Replays show pad first, but he is outside the line"
"<strong>this is a bigger shout, and this has definitely hit him in line</strong>. Not given again. Maybe the inside edge. That is what has saved him here. Big inside edge. Vijay a little casual this morning. This has nipped back in from a crack"
"short of a length, outside off, left alone"
"on a length, flat in trajectory, Rahul goes back, bunts this into the leg side, gets a single"
"flighted outside off, driven to long-off, and both batsmen are off this morning"
"short of a length, goes back to cut it, but finds the man at point"
"flighted outside off, defended off the front foot"
"<strong>sharp turn for four byes</strong>. Wade doesn't follow the turn far enough. Quick turn and low bounce from a length. Past the bat, kisses Wade's gloves, and goes through"
goes back to work a flat delivery around the corner on the leg side
"on a length, on off, hits the low part of the bat as Rahul defends"
"again, staying around that middle and off, looking for the lbw. Rahul defends from the crease"
"<strong>heart, it is broken</strong>. Hazlewood draws the false shot. Bowling for lbw for a long time, and now the heavy ball outside off. Rahul punches, it gets big on him, and the edge goes between the slips and gully at a catchable height. Only 76 to go now"
good calling and good running. Just drops this length ball slightly forward of point for a sin gle
"pitched up outside off, Vijay gets a stride in and drives this. Straight to mid-off, though"
"wide on crease, full outside off, defended off the front foot"
"lovely shot. Rahul is feeling it now. Tossed up outside off, Rahul leans forward and across, and square-drives it past deepish cover"
"full, fast, played back to O'Keefe"
"powerful sweep. From middle and off, and it scorches the outfield as it travels to deep square leg"
"on a length, straight, worked to leg for a single"
"no turn as Vijay leaves this one outside off. Not close enough to disturb the stumps, though"
solid forward defensive to end the over
"gets him on the thigh pad. Hits the crack, rears up and cuts back in. Might have hit him on the box. If Australia had 70 more runs to play with, hmm"
"short of a length, outside off, left alone"
"almost a legcutter at 138ks. On a length, on off, holds its line against the angle, squares him up, but they won't get the lbw because of the bounce"
<strong>unplayable</strong>. That is a proper legcutter that has kicked away and gone away from the batsman. Rahul does well to not follow it
"this one stays low, and Rahul does well to keep it out"
"short of a length, at him, defended from the crease"
"short of a length, down the leg side, Vijay watches it go under his armpit. Oh hello. This has come off the glove. They don't appeal. Only half an appeal. Cummins has fallen in his follow-through so he doesn't know what happened, and Wade puts in only half a shout. <b>Australia let another opportunity go</b>"
"wide length ball, Vijay drops this wide of cover with soft hands. Once again, good calling and sharp running"
"short of a length, into the hip, tucked away to fine leg"
"full and straight, defended to mid-on"
"full, half-volley, crunched to the left of mid-off, and Warner makes a diving save"
"short of a length, outside off, defended off the back foot"
"on a length, on off, defended to mid-on"
"wide length ball, kicks off from there, but too wide to make him play"
"Rahul taking every opportunity to score. He knows this is not an easy pitch. The moment he sees one short, he is quick to rock back and dismiss this from his presence. Through midwicket. Only 60 left now"
"full, just outside off, defended back to Hazlewood"
"this is a sharper bouncer. gets it head high. An unconvincing pull from Rahul, and he is beaten"
tight leave but he does so after getting a stride in to cover the stump
Cummins gets his man. This is a beauty. Vijay pushes at one outside off. The length ball holds its line to take the edge through to Wade. This time he appeals
"full and fast, on the pads, hits uppishly to forward square leg"
"wide length ball, left alone"
appeal for lbw but more out of enthusiasm than conviction. Perhaps they got excited they beat the Pujara bat. Going down leg after hitting a crack
"wide length ball, left alone"
"Pujara is out the only way he looks like he can get out. They have been taking these singles all along. Pujara drops this forward of point and sets off. Then he stutters mid-way. Rahul stops too. Then they go ahead with the run. Maxwell charges in from point, and knocks the middle of the middle stump out with a sizzling direct hit. Pujara is gone"
"too full, there is a long-on in place, and Rahane pushes it there gently for a single"
"sharp turn and bounce from outside off, hits him in the rib"
stays back to defend a length ball that stays low
"tossed up outside off, front-foot defence from Rahul"
stays back to defend a flat offbreak
the offbreak that doesn't turn as much as Rahul expects it to. Beaten on the outside edge as he goes back to play at it
"lovely punch. That will calm some nerves. Cummins overpitches, and he gives it the full face, and sends it crashing to the right of mid-off"
"Rahane is a man in hurry. He loves to hook as he showed at MCG in 2014-15. He hooks again, making sure he goes in front of square and not to the man on the hook. Only 51 more"
"short of a length, outside off, defended with an open face to point"
"short of a length, tucked away off the hip for a single"
"<strong>heartbreaking for Cummins again</strong>. Bouncer, at his face, Rahul throws up his hands to fend it, but the ball doesn't carry to gully"
"another nasty short ball, Rahul keeps it down, playing with the bottom hand off the bat"
"on a length, just outside off, defended to leg"
"goes back to cut, but the ball is too full for the shot. Finds the man at point"
"swept away fine from just outside off, knocks off another run. Under 50 required now"
"another edge goes for four. Rahul pushes at a wide flighted delivery that drifts away from him. No turn from there, and Rahul will take these"
"swept from well outside off, easy single"
moves forward to defend a length ball outside off
"bouncer, straight at him, Rahul ducks under it"
"short of a length, wide outside off, left alone"
"short of a length, outside off, pushed in front of point. A repeat of the Pujara run-out except that these two are fast runners, there is no hesitation, and they go right through. Maxwell rips out the stump again with a direct hit, but Rahul has made it"
"looks to pull, but the ball stays low, and nearly ricochets off his body to the stumps. Misses the leg stump by a set of stumps"
"uses the pace, helps this along, target under 40 now. Just the innings India needed. Cummins just goes a touch too straight with this short ball. Rahane takes it from his armpit, and sends it crashing fine of fine leg"
"another bouncer, this one is bigger, and outside off. Rahane curbs his instinct to ramp it"
stays back to defend a flat length ball
goes back to work a sharp offbreak towards long-on. This is actually very well played. Controlling that amount of turn and then placing it wide of the bowler
"flatter, shorter, worked wide of short leg for one"
"thick inside edge, two bounces to short fine leg. Rahul looks to play a fullish ball to long-on, but the ball rips in from the rough to take the inside edge"
stays back to defend a length ball outside off
"lovely shot. Lyon drops slightly short, and he goes back to punch this through the covers. Rahul nearing yet another fifty"
"As Rahane did at MCG in 2014-15, he takes short bowling on. Even before the ball is let go, Rahane is prepared to hook. He knows what is coming. And dismisses this from his sight with a disdainful six over midwicket"
"freeze the time when Cummins gets into his delivery stride. Rahane has already opened up his body and moved well outside leg to access the off side now that there is a deep midwicket in place. He then crashes this short ball over cover for a flat six. This is aggression, more aggressive than any stare or any abuse hurled at the opponent. Pat, Mitch Johnson faced this at MCG too. That was when Rahane shepherded a shaken-up Kohli with such aggressive batting"
"gets inside the line to keep this hook down, takes a single to fine leg"
"bouncer again, and Rahul ducks it. He is not hooking them like Rahane"
"short of a length, wide on the crease, defended from the crease"
"another bouncer, Rahul keeps his gloves down, and ducks under it"
"on a length, outside off, Rahane goes back to push this in front of point for one"
"full, on off, and Rahul defends. Good to see Rahul is not getting too excited by Rahane fireworks"
"and he gets four now. He has waited and waited, and now he finds the loose ball. The ball is slightly short, and Rahul does the rest by going deep into the crease. Cuts this away to point"
"on a length, goes back, defended to leg"
"tossed up, driven against the turn, but can't get this past the diving Cummins at mid-off"
"sharp turn after some dip, hits the pad, but Rahul has got himself outside the line of off"
"full, middle and leg, defended back"
"good bounce from a length, hits the inside half of the bat, and Rahane rushes back for the second"
"full, outside off, driven hard, but not past Maxwell at cover"
"flighted outside off, Rahane right forward to defend"
"O'Keefe fires this down the leg side, and Rahane gets some glove on the sweep. Only 11 left now"
stays back to defend a length ball
"good bounce and turn, he goes back, but keeps this down. It bounces in front of short leg"
"stays back, pushes a length ball in front of cover, gets a single"
"sharp turn, big shout for lbw, but clearly going down. Goes for four leg-byes off the inside of his pad"
"flighted outside off, pushed into the covers for one"
"tossed up outside off, no anxiety to get to a landmark. Pushes one into the covers for a single"
"flat, into the pads, worked to backward short leg"
"full, flat, into the pads, worked to backward square leg"
"flat, shortish, Rahul pulls, is beaten, but it is headed down leg"
"goes back, works a length ball into the leg side for a single. Not thinking of the fifty. Good to see"
and Rahane picks another single. O'Keefe just bowls a full one into the pads
"lovely work from Rahul. And India have won the series. Rahul exults. Shows how much it means to him. Short of a length, goes back to punch it bast midwicket. They run three when they need only two. What a series for Rahul: six fifties in seven innings on challenging surfaces against challenging bowling"
