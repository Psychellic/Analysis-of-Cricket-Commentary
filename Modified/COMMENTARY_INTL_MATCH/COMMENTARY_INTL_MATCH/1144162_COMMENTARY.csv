"wide down the leg side this time. Full and fast, but the line goes awry. He's perhaps getting put off by the constant movement across the crease from Klaasen"

"wide of off stump, and he drives it through covers. Backward point is able to cut it off, though"
"<strong>GOES ON TO THE BACK FOOT AND SMASHES THIS THROUGH MIDWICKET!</strong> What a way to bring up 50 for Miller. Just latches on to a really delicious length ball, delivered fast to him. Right in the arc...out of the park!"

"<b>edged over the top of slip!</b> Babar through his hands at the first delivery, which was angled across him, and sliced an edge over the top of a leaping slip fielder"
"thumped out of the middle this time! It's another length ball from Beuran, and he offers Babar width outside off. Again he frees his arms, this time lacing the ball over point"
"<b>BOOM!</b> Three in a row from Babar. And this is the best of the lot. Full, but again it's wide from Beuran and Babar leans into a cracking cover drive"
"width again, but this time Babar cuts over the top of it, a bottom edge bouncing towards gully"
"very full on off stump, and Babar drives. Miller runs around from mid on and puts in a dive to stop what could have been another boundary. He's electric in the field"
"Fakhar's off the mark straight away, turning a full ball into the leg side and sprinting through for one. <b>14 runs off the first over!</b>"
"and he finds some swing straight away, but it hoops down the leg side"
"tapped into the covers, and they steal a quick single"
"full and wobbling around on off stump at 134km/h, Babar driving to mid off"
"<b>beautifully steered by Babar</b>, who opens the face of the bat very late to run the ball down past a diving short third man. Not the worst delivery, but it's excellently played"
"<b>turned around the corner for four!</b> Babar is on the charge here, and he swivels into a pull to a short ball, easing the ball down to long leg"
"<b>eased down the ground!</b> This was so well placed as Babar had mid on to beat, and mid off charging around as he stepped forward to drive"

"and an excellent finish to the over for Sipamla, who keeps Babar quiet with a tight line"
"Fakhar clears his front leg and has an <b>almighty heave</b> at a full ball from Beuran, slugging it back over his head and down the ground for four. He didn't get all of it, but got enough"
"Beuran pulls his length back, Fakhar cutting the ball down to third man"
"<b>beaten on the cut</b>. Beuran has possibly got away with one here, offering width outside off but beating Babar's cut. Just ran his fingers over the ball"
"and the change-up is a full one on off stump, Babar nudging a single to mid off"
"it's a slower ball from Beuran, a cutter, but Fakhar spots it and waits on his cut to thread the gap between backward point and gully. They're missing a trick, having moved third man out of position"
"against the run of play, Beuran has struck! <b>Fakhar sized up a bouncer and aimed for the bleachers</b>, but he got underneath it and could only get the ball as far as Janneman Malan at deep square leg. South Africa really needed this strike"
"and Babar welcomes him to the crease with <b>a crunching pull</b>, well in front of square and past a diving midwicket fielder"
"Dala slips his line down the leg side, and Babar just needed to help the ball on its way down to fine leg to <b>bring up the team fifty</b>"
"<b>and again!</b> Babar is unstoppable. Dala tries to correct his line, but instead offers a short, wide ball outside off, Babar clubbing his cut - again well in front of square"
"slower ball from Dala, but Babar spots it and nudges the ball into the leg side"
"sprayed down the leg side, gifting an extra"
"that's better from Dala, who bends his back to <b>beat Babar's outside edge</b> with one that's angled across him"
"Talat finds the boundary straight away! It was a leg stump half volley that he clipped into the leg side, placing the ball just so to beat both midwicket and a diving Morris, running across from mid on"
"a hint of spin in to the right hander, and he works with it to collect a single into the leg side"
"<b>edged, but past the keeper!</b> Shamsi tossed it up outside off and found some very sharp turn. Talat threw his hands into the drive and edged the ball through the vacant slip region"
"again Talat is forward to drive, but this time he finds the middle - but not the placement, as it's just the one to cover"
"<b>big appeal from Shamsi</b> as he finds some purchase and spins the ball in to hit Babar's front pad, but it's high and the umpire says no"
"Babar skips out to drive, but pings mid off"

"length, outside off, and he cuts it, but the man at point stops it comfortably. Great work by Reeza Hendricks, <em>diving</em> away to his right"
"comes down the wicket, and deposits a length ball over long on for <strong>SIX</strong>! Perhaps the bowler paying the price for overdoing the slower ball a bit?"
"length, outisde off, and he gets it off the top end of the bat as he shapes to cut. Gets it fine down to third man"
"plays a length ball with the turn, back towards the bowler"
"goes for a big slog, and is able to get an inside edge towards long leg. Beats van der Dussen down there, though he intended to send this ball towards midwicket"
"down the wicket, and goes inside out to a length ball outside off. <strong>Sublime!</strong> All the way through covers"
"<strong>DELICATE!</strong> Allows the ball to turn back into him, and then just late cuts it fine enough to tease the fielder at short third man. Morris tries his best, but cannot pull it back"

"length, angles across him, and beats his outside edge"
"slower ball, angling across him, and he swings...and misses. Delivered at 127kph"
"steps down the track and goes inside out towards short cover...to Miller. Miller has a go at the striker's end, but cannot hit. Could have been <em>curtains</em> for Babar Azam!"
"length, outisde off, and he pushes it towards covers and picks up a single"
"full ball, and he looks to launch it down the ground, inside-edges it on between his legs towards the keeper. Klaasen has a go at the non-striker's end. It would have been the end of Azam again! <strong>Survives a second time in two overs!</strong>"

"short, wide, and he latches on to it with a vicious off drive, but there's a man at the extra cover fence to clean this up"
"short, climbing into him at 134kph, and he is able to keep a hook towards midwicket low enough"

"fuller, straighter, and he drills it down the ground, where long on quickly gets rid of the ball"

"short, and he has looked for another swing across the line...and <strong>perished!</strong> Slower ball again, from around the wicket, and Asif Ali was effectively trying to across the line and drop kick it towards long leg. Took the top edge and flew high in the air, and Shamsi took a great catch to his right, running over his shoulder and tumbling down, from short fine leg! They are checking for the no-ball, but the front foot seems fine, and so does the bounce. Meeting it just ahead of his helmet grille, from the look of things. <b>Called a no-ball!</b> That's a free-hit then! A no-ball because it's the second short ball of the over"

"slower ball, and he picks it...goes over mid off and clears him comfortably in the end!"
"<strong>mid-stump goes flying!</strong> Full, straight, fast. No chance for Imad once he missed contact. If he had hit it, it might have flown straight over long on, but as it turned out, he was making contact with air. <strong>Is this the decisive over from Morris?</strong>"
"straight, and he drills this straight back past the non-striker. <strong>Power and precision!</strong>"
"length, and he cuts it away, but cannot beat point"
"slower, outside off, and he throws the kitchen sink at it, but can only get it towards cover"
"length, and he has gone across the line, and <strong>holed out</strong>! It was slower through the air, bowled with the knuckles, and he ended up top-edging a swing across the line, and it carried more or less straight to van der Dussen at backward square leg"
"<strong>swings, and misses!</strong> Full, fast and straight at the leg stump. Hasan was making way to go inside out, but was just beaten by the sheer pace and accuracy of this"
