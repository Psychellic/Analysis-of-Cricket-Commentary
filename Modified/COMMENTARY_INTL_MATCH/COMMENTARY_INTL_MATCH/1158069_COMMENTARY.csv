"tentative block from deep in the crease, gathered at short leg"
"curling in towards off stump, pushed with a loose waft to the off side"
"well bowled, yorker length, bending back into the toes, Bairstow can only dig it out, back to the bowler"

"knee-high full toss, clipped to midwicket"
"on the pads, and Cottrell ruins a fine over with a wayward inswinger, helped off the legs through backward square"

"flat-batted biff outside off, not quite getting to the pitch yet"
"flipped to the leg side, but can't beat mid-on"
"good connection off the toes, but midwicket pounces well to cut off the run"
"outside off, looking for the clobber through the covers but thinking better of it"
"fenced through square leg with a closed face, easy pickings"
"full length, lifting into the pads, nudged to the leg side"
"<B>too short, and tonked with intent through cow corner!</B> That's more like it from Bairstow, a stiff-forearmed slam across the line, reading the length early and loitering with intent on the back foot"
"<B>Holder adjusts his line and pays the price!</B> Too much width outside off this time, and clobbered through point"
"<B>a dirty slog through the line!</B> That's old-school filth from Bairstow, dumping the ball back over the bowler's head with no thought about timing. Just pick the line and hit through it!"
"nurdled through third man this time, leaning on the width to pick the single"
"fenced into the covers, off the back foot"
"guided into the covers, on the front foot, and picks the gap"

"back of a length, a modicum of turn, Bairstow rocks back but can't time his pull"
leaning forward to defend
"leaning back, and <B>banjaxed into the crowd!</B> Across the line, swatting against the spin. Have some of that!"
"<B>the same, with knobs on!</B> Bishoo's lost his length here, and Jonny's in a mood! Over the leg side again"

pushed into the covers
fenced into the off side
angled prod into the off side
"wider on the crease, shaping back into the right hander. Blocked"

"on the pads, tucked behinds square"

"clears the front dog, slashes through the line,<strong> and up and over extra cover!</strong> Hales is getting busy"

"up on the toes, and defended to the on side"
crashed into the covers but <B>just short of the man</B>. Careful now ...
"tighter line, and draws a respectful block into the off side"

opens the face for a dab to point. No way through there

"on the pads, worked square"
"clipped firmly to the leg side, Bairstow hurtles back and up comes the hundred at a very tidy clip"
"<B>bowled him!</B> Bairstow was trying to be cute, running the back-of-a-length delivery down to third man. But he didn't get enough angle on the stroke, and played it straight down into the crease and onto his stumps. He perhaps suffered for a lack of strike in recent overs. Just six balls in the last five overs"

"back of a length, coming in from outside off, Root stays back and runs the ball to third man once again"

"over the top of middle stump, tucked to midwicket"
"short and wide, Root slashes hard... Thomas starts to celebrate before looking round at a statuesque Bruce Oxenford. Dismayed faces all round and West Indies <b>review!</b> What does UltraEdge say? <b>Yes, there's a tickle!</b> Hope and Thomas heard the nick, Root probably did too, and although Oxenford didn't, he now raises his finger! Done for pace by Thomas for the second innings running"

"slides back and across, clipped to deep square leg"
"back of a length, and <B>crashed over deep midwicket!</B> Morgan sits so deep in his crease, and is waiting on the back foot to slam this onto the grass and bring up his half-century"
"width on a full length, flogged on the up to deep cover"

"wide line, a hint of outswing, but too wide for the umpire's liking"

"wide line, <strong>crashed abusively over the covers</strong>, just out of the reach of the fielder!"
"<B>another full toss, another dismissive six!</B> Morgan walks across his crease, drops to one knee, pounds a slog-sweep over the leg side. This is carnage!"

through they trot for another single
low full toss - <B>so many full tosses!</B> - and Buttler this time flogs it with that spring-loaded bottom hand though long-on!
"looking for the yorker, fired past the pads, and <B>flicked on its way!</B>.. deary me. The dam has broken!"

swing across the line to deep midwicket
"rolls the fingers on a slower ball, and it's just <B>four runs off the over</B>. A modicum of respite for West Indies"
"back of a length,<strong> too easy for Buttler!</strong> A golf swing back over the bowler's head, and into the wall of the stand!"
"<B>high full toss, top-edged and taken at third man!</B> But this is very likely to be a <B>no-ball</B>... yep, a notch above waist height, I reckon. The umpires agree, and here comes <B>a free hit</B>!"
"wide line outside off, a swing and a miss from Morgan, who is still seeking that elusive hundred"
"<B>there's the hundred!</B> Yet another full toss outside off, yet another monstering over the leg side! Down on one knee, middled over long-on, and England are charging for 400 here!"
"crashed to the leg side, wide and full"

"full and straight, well dug out as Holder finds his length this time"
"full, straight, but a cunningly disguised slower ball! Morgan swings out to the deep, doesn't get enough bat through it this time, <B>pouched at long-off</B>... and out comes Cottrell's salute, delivered with impressive conviction in spite of his team being in full retreat!"
flogged through the covers. Normal service is resumed!
eased down to long-off
"charging down the track, muscled back past the bowler, and Stokes as well, who sways as the missile sizzles past his ribs!"

"slower ball, thumped down the ground"
"<B>spanked into the stands yet again!</B> And Buttler gives Cottrell a salute as he trudges back to his mark! Another low full toss. The umpteenth of the innings, and it vanishes over cow corner again!"
an open-faced nurdle and up comes <B>the 400</B>. Gosh.
"boshed down the ground, on a full length"
cuffed without much decorum down to long off
"<B>England equal the sixes world record!</B> Buttler clears his front foot, biffs through the line, and that's 23 and counting for the innings, matching West Indies in Barbados last week!"
"reverse sweep, but Stokes can't reach the wide line"
too wide this time... we'll have that one again
flashed out to deep cover
"into the stands yet again,<strong> Buttler brings up his 150 with the world-record 24th six of the innings!</strong> Over deep midwicket!"
"<B>bowled him!</B> Buttler's fun is over ... another wipe to the leg side, a slower ball wriggles through his defences, and a gracious handshake as he retreats to the pavilion. 150 from 77 balls ... one blow shy of a 200 strike rate ... next time maybe!"

"smashed on the up into the covers again,<strong> but on the bounce to mid-off</strong>. A good cutter, taking the pace off that one"
"too short, and <B>hoisted off the hips and over square leg!</B> West Indies get moving again. And that has probably confirmed that Morgan will give Wood a breather now. Save him for another burst later?"

"back of a length, dabbed into the off side"
"smashed into the covers, an excellent one-handed pick-up from Stokes, but the shy is wayward"

"outside leg stump, tucked off the pads to short fine leg"
"fenced off the back foot, past the sprawling point and gathered by the sweeper. Plunkett doing a fine job once more. Can he get out of the over cheaply?"

"full-faced defence, on the back foot, pressed to mid-off"
"short and <B>absolutely caned through midwicket!</B> There was a man back on the rope, but he met that on the top of the bounce so sweetly, no chance to haul that in!"

"fired down the leg side, and <B>that's brilliant from Gayle</B>, reversing his stance and paddling it oh so fine behind square"
<B>heave ho!</B> Up comes Gayle's 150 with a monster mow over midwicket! Was that half-chance earlier in the over as good as it will get for Rashid?
"onto the front foot, and <B>dumped up and over long-off!</B> Rashid tosses it up, but the Kraken has well and truly stirred after that momentary alarm!"
flicked to the leg side

"angled across Gayle, but inside the tramlines, that's a fine delivery"
