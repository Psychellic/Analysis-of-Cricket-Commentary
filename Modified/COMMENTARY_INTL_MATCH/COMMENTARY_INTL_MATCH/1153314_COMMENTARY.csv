"<b>flicks it straight to deep square leg</b> full length on the stumps, tempts him into playing it in the air and he picks out Shimron Hetmyer perfectly. Ooh but what do we have here? <b>This could be a no-ball</b> It's very tight, and it looks like Roach doesn't have anything behind the line. It's touch and go however. The third umpire is taking his time with this one. One team is going to feel hard done by, by the decision. And it's a no-ball! Right decision in the end I think. Liton gets a lease of life, and Bangladesh get a <b>free hit</b>"
