"over the wicket, back of a length, 145kph/90mph and rising to judder the bat as Kohli hangs in the crease and blocks"
"shortish, hits the thigh pad as Kohli pushes to leg, Mills touching 144kph/89mph"
"angled across, back of a length, plenty of pace (146kph) on the ball - and cracked through backward point for four! Slightly aerial, maybe off the toe of the bat, Kohli squints at his blade and frowns, but he is up and running"
"length on the stumps, Kohli shuffles across and tucks this away behind square on the leg side one"
"length ball, fired down in the channel, not quite 90mph this time, Rahul watches it by"
"short and wide and slashed over backward point for four more! Using the pace and he guided it up and over deliberately - nine runs off the over, decent start for India"
"fullish outside off, drilled to point coming forwards... and Jordan had overstepped. Oh dear"
"good length outside off, goes for the booming drive - and misses"
"wide ball, maybe cross-seam and Kohli swings away from his body, fails to connect. England enquired but umpire Nitin Menon not interested in the edge or calling wide"
"fired down the leg side, this one will be wide"
"length in the channel, beats the bat again, Kohli chasing the expansive shot on the up and fails to connect"
"slightly straight, Kohl brings the bottom hand into play and slogs over mid-on, not as pretty but much more effective, bounces away for another boundary"
"dupes him with the cutter this time, taking the pace off and it slides past the inside edge as Kohli looks to work to leg"
"leg stump, following Kohli as he tries to make room, ends up coming down and tucking one through midwicket"
"back of a length on the stumps, Kohli nudges one more off his body"
"round the wicket, dug in short and there's serious gas on this, 148kph/92mph and searing a trail through to the keeper as Rahul sways away"
"grunt of exertion from Mills as he digs in a back-of-a-length ball, again tops 91mph but Rahul dabs it into the off side... and Morgan then underarms into the stumps, with Kohl safely in, and they run a second, to Mills' chagrin"
"shortish, sprayed down the leg side"
"good length, bit of width and Rahul reaches for the drive, gets a thick outside edge down to third man"
"wide of the stumps, possibly a slower ball, Kohli comes across and dabs it through gully. Yep, that one was out of the back of the hand"
"taking the pace off again, 114kph/71mph and tapped towards point, Kohli bellows 'No!'"
"launched over the off side, not the cleanest of strikes but it skips away. Roy gives chase from point but can't quite pull it in"
"slotted, that's a gorgeous shot! Length outside off from Plunkett and Kohli steps out to spank a lofted drive for four more"
"beats the bat this time, shorter and flying through as Kohli swipes at it"
"fullish, maybe a cutter, tapped into the off side and they take one"
"oof, that looked a painful blow, extra bounce and it hits the glove, 135kph/84mph on the stumps and fended into the leg side"
"steps away to leg, Plunkett follows him, closes the face for one more through square"
"pitched up, shuffles into line on off stump, flicked through square leg to the boundary rider"
"full and straight, Rahul cautiously tucks the ball towards mid-on"
"banged in short, Rahul goes to pull, gets in a tangle - and short fine leg pockets the top edge! Simple formula, simple catch, and England break through. Good pace, directed at the body and tucked him up"
"pitched up outside off, leans into a checked punch to mid-off"
"back of a length, 138kph/86mph and worked to leg, mid-on has to run in and they scamper the one"
"slower ball from Jordan, Kohli waits for it on middle and leg, flicks around the corner for another single - decent over for England"
"length ball, angled in at 140kph/87mph and clipped off the pads to deep square leg"
"pitched up in the channel, Raina leans into another gentle drive to mid-off"
"here comes Raina, looking to hit Plunkett off his length, sliced over backward point and although Rashid gets round from third man he mucks up an attempted tumbling stop on the rope to concede a four"
"looking to make room again, Plunkett follows him, worked off the pads"
"good length outside off, Kohli happy to angle the bat and run one behind square"
"Raina steps out to give it some more humpty, off the toe of the bat but he still clears both men running back from the edge of the circle, not quite a straight six but it bounces away to the fence"
"pitched up around off stump, pushed back down the ground"
"pitched up and worked into a gap on the leg side, they hustle back for two - and that's the India 50"
"short, possibly a cutter, slightly leg side and Raina swings and misses - given wide"
"hits the pads this time, half an appeal from Stokes, he was jumping across, probably pitched outside leg"
"fuller length, 143kph/88mph in the channel, comes forward to stroke one through cover point"
"length, pushed across the left-hander from over the wicket, Raina drops back and angles one more to third man"
"full on the stumps, worked across the line to deeps square leg - India ticking along"
"Kohli attacks, whips the wrists... and picks out midwicket! The crowd noise drops as the captain heads off, golden-arm Moeen does the trick. That was struck very firmly but Morgan was alert and plucked the catch nonchalantly"
"round the wicket, tossed up and prodded into the off side"
"pushed through a touch quicker on the stumps, Yuvraj leaves his crease and loses the ball between his legs, whirling around to regain his ground - but he was safe"
"floated up outside off, comes forward to punch down the ground"
"flatter and straighter, Raina works to leg"
tossed up and Yuvraj comes forward to tickle one more down the ground
"back of a length outside off, steered through point"
"banged in short, the bouncer rises wide of the stumps... and called, Raina not even bothering to go after it"
"length ball, Raina dances out this time and swats over point, there's a man in the deep to cut it off"
"length ball on off stump, 131kph/80mph and punched to mid-off"
"back of a length, gets Yuvraj fishing outside off stump, the ball fades away past the outside edge"
"shortish, driven off the back foot, straight to mid-off... who misfields, Plunkett has to turn and lumber after it, gifting Yuvraj a couple more, to Stokes' immense dissatisfaction"
"slower ball, slightly wide and Raina guides it with laser precision behind point and wide of third man for four. Stokes has got a cob on after that, no mistake"
"floated up on the stumps, worked into the leg side for one"
"tossed up, straightening on middle and leg, Raina defends"
"uses the feet, comes forward and pushes a single towards long-on"
"tossed up straight, Yuvraj tries to make room to hit down the ground... and gets a thick inside edge to short fine leg"
"this time he slots it, pumped down the ground for four! Full and inviting on off stump and Yuvraj clubs through the line"
"sees him coming, fires the ball in flat, worked off the legs through midwicket for one"
"short of a length, Yuvraj flails across the line... big, spiralling top edge... and Rashid comes up with it at fine leg! That's an excellent running catch, they'll check upstairs but the soft signal is 'out'... Rashid had to run in off the boundary and plunge forward, he got both hands around it as he went to ground and came up with the ball safely. Plunkett strikes first ball, too! The short ball does the trick"
"dug in again, this flies through at nose height as Raina sways away"
"length on the pads, tucked through square for a single"
"length on the stumps, Dhoni nudges into a gap on the leg side"
"pitched up, Raina narrows the gap further, turns it into a half-volley and drills the ball wide of mid-off for a welcome boundary"
"full toss from Plunkett, on the pads and Raina scoops into the leg side, bounces short of deep square running in"
"tight lines from Moeen, tucked into the leg side"
"over the wicket, angled in flat, Dhoni tucks into the midwicket area and charges back for two"
"tossed up, worked off the legs, just the single this time"
"pushed through flat and Raina goes to sweep, gets a bottom edge to short fine leg"
"tossed up, comes forward on off, punched down the ground"
"flat on the stumps, Dhoni happy to deal in singles for now, flicked off the pads for one more"
"length on the pads, 136kph/85mph, no room to swing those helicopter arms, clipped to deep backward square"
"plops it on a length, Raina backs away... and plops it over the boundary rope! First six of the innings, swatted high into the evening sky, cleared the front leg and heaved for India"
"bowled him, behind the legs! Stokes slips in an inch-perfect leg-stump yorker (that would of course have been fodder had Raina gone the other way)... The batsman had moved across, missed with a flick to leg and off popped the bails. Another vital breakthrough for England, checking the momentum"
"back of a length, stays in the crease and opens the face, good running brings them two"
"shortish outside off, tapped down into the covers"
"back of a length on the stumps, Pandey turns it off his body into the leg side for another single"
"over the wicket, darted on middle and off, Pandey nudges it away defensively"
"rapped on the front pad, trying to play to leg - given! Think Pandey played his pad rather than the ball here, looked pretty good on line, just got tangled up with his shot. Struck in front of off, not much turn, probably would have hit middle"
floated up and defended into the covers
"pushed through outside off, goes back and runs three off the face past short third man - that takes India into three figures"
"flighted, Dhoni waits in the crease and punches down the ground"
"gets this up in the blockhole, Pandya jams down on it, single to long-on - another excellent over for Moeen and he finishes with a T20I best of 2 for 21"
"length ball, stays a bit low as Pandya defends on off stump"
"on the stumps, Pandya moves across and tucks to midwicket"
"angled in with the arm, again he picks out the fielder, can't get it through the ring"
"goes short, Pandya pulls in the air, in front of the diving midwicket fielder, Stokes has to go flying around the boundary from long-on, he slides to stop it but the ball keeps rolling towards the rope... and then he throws himself bodily into the air again to palm it back, making sure he wasn't in contact with the boundary. Acrobatic stuff and it works!"
"length ball outside off, goes back and runs one off the face"
"pitched up, Dhoni can only poke this into the covers - three off the over, England have the brakes firmly on"
sprayed down the leg side
"pitched up, in the slot to drive, struck firmly but extra cover does well to take the pace off"
"full outside off, Dhoni had stepped out and he plays a fairly orthodox cover drive, laced past the man on the ring and beating extra cover - lovely schtuff"
Stokes aims for the tramline... and misses. Was trying to keep Dhoni guessing
"goes full and straight this time, clipped off the pads"
"banged in short, 136kph/84mph and Pandya pulls... but hits the splice and it dribbles back to the bowler"
"loses his line again, this time a slower ball trundles a yard or so down the leg side"
"full and fast, 142kph/88mph and wide of off stump, Pandya can't time his drive, picks up one through cover point"
"length on the pads, Dhoni tucks it to short fine leg and they hustle through - 11 runs off that nine-ball over as Stokes finishes with 1 for 37"
"slower ball, sits up outside off stump, paddled through square leg for one"
"banged in short, Pandya skies a top edge... safely pouched at deep backward point, Mills strikes! Had to swing for the hills but was done for pace trying to cut and it ballooned limply out towards the boundary. That is Mills' first international wicket"
"pitched up in the channel, comes forward and pushes through the covers for one"
"short of a length, 144kph/89mph over the top of off, worked away into the leg side but they won't get back for two"
"shortish, 144kph/89mph and rising outside off, stabbed towards point"
"slower ball Rasool watches it carefully, runs a single down to third man"
"shortish, full pace on off stump, swatted on the pull through midwicket"
"pitched up, Dhoni clips off his toes like a gent tossing a stick for his dog in the park, gets it between long-on and deep midwicket and they come back for two"
"skips out early, Jordan sticks to his plans and bowls a wide yorker - dot ball, Dhoni doesn't even swing for it"
"pitched up towards the blockhole, bunted to long-on"
"low full toss, 143kph/89mph and Rasool is hit on the pad flicking across the line, runs to short fine leg"
"full on off stump, Dhoni can't get under it - or doesn't try - and punches one more down the ground to long-off"
"short otuside off, maybe a slower ball, Dhoni toe-ends a cut thorugh point"
"dug in back of a length, 86mph and pulled without timing through mid-on"
"slower ball, Dhoni goes back and swats it towards short fine leg, Rashid collapses like a falling tree and fails to cut the ball off"
"back of a length, at the body and Dhoni is hurried, manages to squeeze it away into the leg side"
"shortish, outside off, Rasool dabs a single behind point"
"finishes with a back-of-the-hand slower ball, Dhoni doesn't seem to pick it and gloves a pull into the leg side"
"full toss, bludgeoned back down the ground, Jordan sticks out a hand and can't hold on. Think it bounced, would have been an almost-impossible chance, though you have seen Jordan take them... Dhoni makes sure he scampers back to keep the strike"
"full but not quite the yorker and Dhoni finally nails one, creamed back down the ground for a straight boundary - India needed that"
"full and wide, Dhoni latches on to it again, smeared through point for another four! A vengeful blow and it flew to the left of deep cover"
"pitched up, Dhoni hammers a drive, straight to extra cover... and Rasool is halfway down, Dhoni unmoving, Jordan completes the run-out!"
"pitched up, 145kph towards the toes and Dhoni again pings a drive to mid-off, doesn't run"
"full again, dug out but Dhoni can't time it, squeezed down the ground and they push for the second, could be tight... Bumrah makes his ground as Jordan breaks the stumps, which means India have totaled 147 for 7 from their 20 overs"
"tight line, nudged into the leg side, could have been a single, but no need to take risks just yet ..."
"outside off, driven to cover where Kohli of all people lets a soft shot dribble through his long barrier! That will irk him no end as the batsmen jog through"
"more width, but smacked hard to short cover where Kohli this time makes no mistake"
"open face, guided down to third man"
"onto the front foot, crunched out to point. A tidy restrictive line so far, asking the batsmen to reach for their strokes as they come to terms with the pace of the pitch"
"open face once again, guided to third man"
"battered high and hard over the man at point, who stretches high on the edge of the circle but doesn't have the reach! Good fast hands, climbing through the line of the ball"
"not quite such an impressive stroke, but he'll take it! A bit of an ugly mow across the line, skewed tantalisingly out of the reach of mid-on, and away to the rope"
"shorter length, fenced down to third man"
"high and handsome! Billings strolls across his stumps, launches the ball high over the vacant fine leg, picking up the full length and dispatching it for a maximum!"
"full and straight, conventional defence, for once"
"too short, a fierce short-arm pull through square leg. That is a sensationally varied over of boundary-harvesting!"
"on the pads, tucked square, easy pickings so far for England"
"wow, that is sublime! A bow-like swing of the bat, launched ferociously over long off!"
"outside off, a swish, a miss, that stayed a touch low"
"sliding down the leg side, half an appeal from Dhoni, but the wily old goat was simply trying to distract from the wide ..."
skips across the stumps to ease another single to the leg side. Smart batting
"wider on the crease, looked like a slower ball. But well tapped into the leg side, they jog the single with the field back on its heels"
"slower-ball bouncer, Roy wanders into line and hauls a measured pull into the leg side"
"well, no standing on ceremony there! Down on one knee, sizing up the length in an instant and sixing it out of the park!"
"great comeback! Roy's fallibility to spin continues as he is beaten by some low bounce outside off, and slogs a loose drive into his own stumps!"
Root gets into line for his sighter
"driven with a straight face, and more sloppiness in the field, gifting a single through mid-off"
"down the track and bowled him! Billings skips down to whip the spinner across the line, but ends up yorking himself as the ball drifts back into the toes. What an over! That's brought Kanpur to life again!"
"tight line on off stump, solid defence back down the pitch"
solid in defence
worked into the leg side
"flicked off the pads, out to deep square leg"
"drifting into the left-hander from round the wicket, defended"
firm drive and a half-stop at cover. They steal the single regardless

"down the track, attempted flick, cannons off the toes"
"up on the toes, pushed out to point"
"big stride forward, smothering defence"
"well bowled, leaping off the pitch from a very full and straight line. Morgan is forced to defend"
"big stride, driven back to the bowler"
"outside edge, deflected to short third man. Another excellent over, but England you sense are happy to sit tight on the spinners for now"
"back of a length, firmly driven to a tumbling cover"
"inside-out and over the top! That's a lovely strike, making room to leg, leaning into a drive over the off side, and connecting sweetly"
"on the pads, worked to leg"
"worked into the leg side again, the right-hander's leg side that is"
"tucked off the pads, two is the call from the moment the ball leaves the bat, and they make it easily"
"tucked to mid-on, another comfortable single. Nine off the over and no sweat broken"
driven into the covers
"right under the nose, punched into the gap at mid-on"
"round the wicket, chiselled into space at midwicket"
"another firm strike from under the eyeline, Nice pointy-elbowed drive to mid-on"
"a bit of width, and a mistimed slap to point"
"pierces the infield with another drive, but the sweeper tidies up on the boundary's edge"
"full length, sharp pace, defended back to the bowler"
"back of a length and scuttling through a touch, Morgan attempts a whip to leg but is struck on the pad. Outside the line, most probably"
"very full again, Morgan defends straight down into the crease, and Root, ever alert, hustles through for the single"
"on the back foot, pushed into the covers"
punched into the covers
steals another single with a calm nurdle. England cooking along just fine
"that is a superb strike. Tossed up high, Root committed himself to the gallop down the track, got right to the pitch, and fizzed a fierce drive through the covers. No stopping that"
"fuller length, pushed out to cover"
"wallop! Down on one knee, fast and committed hands, climbing into the slog-sweep, and that's gone the absolute distance!"
"on the front foot again, clipped to long-on. Sensible batting to rotate the strike again"
"width, and turning wider, Root reaches for a slapped cut, with his back-foot wisely anchored in the crease"
"another precious dot, doesn't turn, but does bounce, over the top of another long-levered slog-sweep. Well bowled"
"width outside off, chopped firmly down to third man"
"on the pads, flicked into the gap, and they somehow chisel two runs out of that one. Perfectly weighted lack of pace on the shot (or lack of shot, as it turned out)"
"on the pads, worked to the leg side"
"round the track, but comprehensively beaten by the lack of pace. Almost pirouettes in his followthrough as a mow finds thin air"
defended from a full length into the leg side
worked down to third man for another single
"reverse sweep, into position early, and good sharp running brings a couple"
"flicked to leg, more easy pickings"
thwack! That's a dirty long-hop and Morgan is in the form to put that where he pleases! A partial pirouette and launched over wide long-on
follows up with the sensible single again. Clever batting
Root returns the favour
nudged into the leg side. Another fuss-free over of progress from England
"bouncer, very short"
worked into the leg side. Easy peasy
"attempted pull, deflects off the thigh pad"
"down the track, high-elbowed drive into the gap in the covers, and that is exquisitely placed and timed. Looked as though it would be cut off, but just kept getting away from the sweeper"
"cut in half by this one, but another single into the leg side"
"clever deflection to the man at backward point. Again an insta-call from Root, who is always sharp backing up"
"on the back foot, flapped up to mid-on. Another excellent over of progress"
"punched down to long-off, another single to the target"
"on the pads, flicked into the gap at midwicket"
tucked to midwicket
"slapped dismissively, up and over wide long-on! Not massively off-length, but Morgan was through his stroke so quickly"
worked into the off side
clipped behind square. Root will play that shot til the cows come home
tapped out to the covers
"smashed high into the leg side, doesn't have the legs, and that could be a brilliant piece of fielding from Raina, who takes the catch, topples back, and tosses the ball back into play with a millimetre to spare. Saved four runs there"
a rare dot!
worked to the leg side
another nurdle into the ever-widening gaps in the field
"on the toes, dabbed square"
"fifty for Morgan, and it's a turbo-charged way to get there! Spanked into the midwicket stands!"
"a toe-ended slog down to long-off, and India have their breakthrough! Morgan wanted to finish this in a hurry, and why not? Chasing a ball that he was never quite to the pitch of, and a fine third-wicket stand of 83 comes to an end"
"Root nudges another single, his umpteenth of the innings"
inside-edged defence into the leg side
shovelled into the leg side
"tight line on off stump, defended"
"on the toes, whipped to the leg side in true Root-ian fashion"
"on the hip, clipped to the leg side"
"tapped into the off side, throughts of a single hastily aborted, and Root had pretty much given up on making his ground, except the shy from the covers clipped his heels instead of the stumps!"
finds the gap this time with a whip into the leg side
"bowled him! Root aimed something expansive over the leg side, but that keeps low and sends his leg stump cartwheeling! But hang on ... what is this ... that back foot looks dangerously close to the front line. This is going to be a <B>no-ball</B>, I think! Indeed it is, and well, that sums up India's day. With a <B>free hit</B> to come"
"bowled him again! But it of course doesn't count. Root turns his stance inside out in pursuit of a ramp to leg, but is yorked in undignified fashion"
worked to the leg side
"down the leg side, and a fumble behind the stumps to add to India's woes"
"back of a length, a bit of a dirty swish across the line, and takes the outside edge through third man. A bit curious, but it really no longer matters. Looks like Root is practicing giving it some welly!"
"better timing this time, a hoisted pull through deep midwicket, a half-save on the boundary's edge, and just about clawed back at the second attempt"
"round the wicket, and this one ghosts through to the keeper"
"tonked. In the slot, and hoisted over midwicket. That'll do"
"low full toss, and fetched through midwicket once again! Just two needed to seal a crushing win"
worked into the leg side. Scores level
"pushed firmly into the leg side, and that is the end of that!"
