full and wide outside off. Holder does well to let it go through. One free run for West Indies
"full on leg, and Holder's slog is mistimed to deep backward square leg. <B>Eleven off the over</b>"
"full on middle, and he goes for the big shot over extra cover. Can't time it well, and the ball is in the air for ages. Rubel gets under it at long off and does manage to hold on! Sends Holder home."
"full on middle, and defended back to Fizz off the front foot"
"<b>lucky!</b> An excellent delivery that costs Fizz a boundary. Back of a length outside leg, and Powell tried to nudge it to the leg side. Takes a leading edge, and flies between keeper and gully!"
"good length ball outside leg stump, and Powell flicks this off his pads to the leg side"
"full outside leg stump, and he misses the paddle sweep. Hits the bat's handle and flies away to the off side instead. They appeal for lbw, but the umpire signals runs"
"good length on leg stump, and Powell misses the leg-side swipe. Hits his front pad, and the lbw appeal is turned down! Looked much closer, but maybe the height saved him. A chance of a run-out as well, as Mushfiqur has a shy at the stumps with Powell outside his crease. But he misses."
"full outside off, and the drive is drilled to the fielder at cover. All the infielders are on the 30-yard circle"
"knee-high full toss but wide outside off. He swings across the line, and gets a good connection too, but the shot goes to long on on the bounce"
"yorker on off, and shoveled to cover. Just a single"
"full outside off, and the slog takes the bat's inside edge! Almost beats the keeper, but Mushfiqur sticks his left hand out and stops the ball. Saves a certain four"
"attempted yorker on off stump, and all Nurse can do is thump a drive down to long on"
"full on off, and Powell can't put this away! It was in the slot to be thumped, but the ball takes an inside edge to the leg side. Powell is disappointed, but atleast he keeps strike"
"<b>over wide long on!</b> Make that 22 off five! Full on off, and lifted into the stands. In his arc, and Powell doesn't miss out"
"good length on leg stump, and the pull goes to deep midwicket. No chance of a double. Gets Nurse on strike"
"full outside leg stump, and Nurse's wild swing doesn't make contact with the ball. It goes through to the keeper and now the equation becomes seven runs per ball."
"good length outside off, and he backs away before cutting to Rubel at cover point. Rubel cartwheels and stops a certain boundary!"
"back of a length outside leg, and he flicks it square to deep midwicket"
"full on off, and Nurse brings out a front foot defence to end the series.<B>Bangladesh win by 18 runs!</b>"
