"<b>indecision in the running</b> as Kamran comes forward to drive to cover, both batsmen engaging in some stop-start running before eventually completing a single"

"another short one, but this one doesn't get up as high and Pollard pulls to midwicket"
"<b>hits the stumps!</b> Hasnain has come back really well from the mauling he got earlier, and now he dismisses Kamran with a full one that shapes in through the air towards middle stump even as the batsman walks across to the off side and looks for a paddle-scoop. Good pace too at 140km/h"

"<b>dropped at long on!</b> The ball was fiercely hit, but almost straight to Umar Akmal. He sets himself with a reverse-cup, but the ball bursts right through it and hits him on the cheek"

"this is tremendous bowling from Bravo, who zips in another pinpoint yorker that tests the defence and threatens the toes"

Watson cuts hard but Fletcher dives smartly to his left at backward point to cut it off

"Shehzad drives a full toss sweetly back down the ground, but Pollard zips across from mid on, dives to cut it off, and then sends a shy at the non-striker's stumps. Watson was diving to make his ground, and a <b>direct hit would have had him</b>"
"<b>driven on the up</b>, through cover. Not a great deal of foot movement from Shehzad, but his hands are just right to thread the gap"

"Umaid's short to start, and Watson climbs into a powerful pull out to deep square, where only a dive from Imam stops a certain boundary"

"tapped down through backward point, where Fletcher throws himself to his left and is very upset with himself when he doesn't stop it cleanly and allows the single"
"this is too easy with third man up inside the circle. Short and wide from Umaid, and Watson times his late dab just right to collect four to third man"
"<b>missed chance at mid on!</b> Surprisingly, it's Hasan Ali in that position. Watson chips his drive and the ball bursts through Hasan's hands at mid on. A timely dive could have resulted in a clean catch. And in fact, he seems to have hurt himself missing that one, and immediately leaves the field for some attention from the physio"

"nicely placed by Watson, nudging the ball softly into the acres of space on the leg side. As the man sprints in from deep midwicket, they take a chance for a second run"
"<b>moosed over cover!</b> Slower ball from Umaid, but it just sat up outside off, Watson slamming his shot well in front of square"
"<b>Hasan misses another one!</b> Dawson might have struck first ball. Shehzad top-edged his sweep and it carried all the way to Hasan at fine leg, but he almost over-runs it coming in off the rope and lets the ball through his fingers"

Shehzad gets across to the off side and sweeps hard down to fine leg
"<b>huge appeal!</b> Watson got across to the off side as well, and set himself for a paddle sweep. Has it hit the bat? The glove? The pad? Zalmi believe it's the latter, and they take a <b>review</b> when the umpire turns their appeal down. But replays show the ball coming off the glove, so this will be <b>fifty for Watson</b>"

"<b>thrashed wide of midwicket!</b> This wasn't all that short, and Watson pulls it off the front foot and well in front of square. In fact, the shot beats midwicket on his left, so straight was it hit"

<b>wonderful innovation!</b> Shehzad walks across and scoops a full one up and over fine leg for a four to <b>raise the century stand</b>
"<b>top edge drops safely!</b> Shehzad wanted to mow a length delivery over long on, but the ball rushes him and the top edge loops towards short third man. Both point and third man converge, but the ball comes to ground before either is in position"

"Umaid offers a short, wide one, but Watson misses his cut"
