"short of a length with some late movement away outside off, rising up to waist height as Latham takes it"
"<b>just wide of square leg</b> as he pulls this early. It's short of a length and closer to the off stump this time, moving away again. He gets the hands through early and ends up dragging it aerially"

"short of a length at off stump, defended off the back foot"
short of a length and slanted across off stump. Stands tall and punches nicely through the line to get it wide of mid-off. Williamson chases but can't parry this back in at the boundary after getting there
"full on leg stump, watchfully tapped to short midwicket"
full and slanted down leg side. Can't get bat on the flick
nicely timed. Good length on leg stump and he leans in and closes the face at the right time to nudge this through midwicket
"full on off stump, stands put in the crease and lifts this through the line, over the non-striker. Through it early and it ends up dragging it a touch, but safe enough in the end"

"length on the pads, nudged on the up to midwicket"
"full and just outside off, drilled straight to mid-off on the up"

<b>appeal for lbw</b> but that's going over. And there's an inside edge. Roy walks at Southee and gets one that's angled in. Tucked up as he looks to flick

"<b>New Zealand have had a horror start</b> in the field. Length ball outside off ends up to Latham's left off the inside edge. He shies at the non-striker's end where Bairstow is well in. No one's backing up and Williamson gives chase from mid-off. For the second time, he gets there but fails to drag it in after putting in the slide"

"good length on off stump, testing his mid-riff's mobility. Roy fully forward to defend solidly"
"<b>over square leg.</b> Superb from Roy. Seemed to climb with the ball that was dug in short. The hands were coming from underneath and adjusted well. He used his wrists late to place it too, all while holding his shape"

"<b>a review for lbw now.</b> Roy trapped on the back foot, Latham says it's pad first. Looks high on first look and appears to have pitched outside leg as well...Latham's right about the contact. It is pad first. But tracking confirms out suspicion. <b>That's pitching outside leg.</b> The original not-out decision stands."

"tossed up on leg stump, met on the full and drilled to long-on"
"glorious shot inside-out. This is full on middle stump, he gets the front leg out of the way and lifts it cleanly over extra cover"

"good length on off stump, blocked on the front foot"
"<b>well taken!</b> Santner leaps forward and scoops one up at short fine. Roy will wait around, but that's a clean catch. He looks to pull and is early on it. It's a top-edge as the ball spins towards the off side. It hangs in front of the fielder who has picked it late, but adjusts superbly to get his hands under it with a forward pounce"

"tossed up on off stump, driven to short extra-cover"

"back of a length outside off, punched to sweeper cover"

"flatter, quicker legbreak close to off stump, pushed into the covers and can't quite find the placement for the quick single. A rare dot ball"
"Oh my, <b>nearly drags it on</b>. It was perhaps not short enough to pull, and there's some slow turn that means he has to drag it from well outside off. Bottom edge, and then into front leg"

"back of a length on leg stump, worked away through square leg"
"length ball angling in from wide of the crease. Shapes to play the inside-out drive, but it doesn't really come on - may have been another knuckleball - and he turns his wrists to play it to midwicket instead"

"ooh, well bowled, and a huge appeal, but the <b>umpire isn't interested</b>. Length ball, knuckleball, nips back in to beat Root's attempted drive down to long-on, and hits front pad. Clipping the outside of the top of leg stump, according to ball-tracking - can't complain about the decision"
"shortish on off stump, makes himself room to chop it through point"
"flat length ball on middle stump and Root attempts another reverse-ramp. Another appeal for lbw, and it isn't given again.

<b>on the roof</b> over long-on and it bounces outside. I reckon there'll be a new ball from this end. Bairstow backs away and by this point he's become immune to the knuckle ball. He swings the old-fashioned slog and the official distance on that is <b>113 metres</b>
"backs away again and chops it late. Gives short third man a sliver of hope, but he beats him comfortably"
"<b>taken at short third man.</b> Bairstow walks off with some pride, acknowledging the crowd at ever corner. It's been a top innings, despite the ugly end. An offcutter from Munro, full on off stump. He's looking to go over midwicket but gets a top edge"

inswinging yorker at the toes. Nudged to midwicket's left.
"<b>googly, top edge, tumble, wicket!</b> Five wickets for 13 runs. This is surreal. Ali looks to go over midwicket but he's assuming this one's coming into him.

"<b>'yesss,'</b> says Latham as he takes this down leg side. The umpire raises his finger. Root appears to have gloved this hook shot. Bouncer doesn't come on as quickly as he expects it to. He's inside the line and playing away from his body by the time it arrives"
"short of a length on off stump, mistimed punch on the up. Lands in front of Southee"
short ball outside off is hammered on the up to sweeper's right. It looks like it'll be the first boundary in eight overs. But Boult has a point to prove today. Sprins some 20 metres and dives one-handed to keep it in
"short of a length outside off, mistimed punch to mid-off"
shot. Nicely done by Rashid. Bouncer at an off stump line. Might have been of the slower variety. He's under it and he puts the bat up to lift it over the keeper
full and headed down leg. Rashid looks to flick and gets a deflection off the pad. Latham flies to his left and saves three
<b>who needs fielders.</b> Boult goes for the base of off stump and he damages it. Rashid looking to nudge this through cover but he's playing inside the line
"yorker wide outside off, goes with his hands and gets this out to third man"
another yorker. This one headed for leg stump. He backs away and gets a thick outside edge to third man as he looks to go over mid-off
"yorker just outside off, squeezed straight to backward point"
"yorker just outside off stump, jammed to mid-off"
yorker on off stump. Met on the full and carved behind square on the off side. Sweeper cleans up to his left
yorker in the channel outside off. Backs away and chops at it. Beaten. That was tailing in but not enough to hit off stump
"<b>shot!</b> Anticipates the line and length, hops into the off side and uses the angle to scoop this to the fine leg boundary. Superbly executed, he was nearly outside the pitch on the off side as he got under this"
superb hit again. Dances around in the crease a shade before standing tall. Southee gives him a knee-high full toss on middle stump and he pumps this straight over the bowler
"lovely. Curran is giving England some momentum. Exposes the stumps, gets another full toss at knee height and he slices it to the backward point boundary"
"wow. What an innings this is. Anticipates the slower ball, stays put in the crease and launches this over mid-off. It's an offcutter on a good length at off stump. He does so well to lift this, because he's on the back foot"
"<b>Nicholls does superbly</b> to his right at deep square to save two runs. Leaps full length to stop this pull shot on the bounce. Curran was backing away, Southee followed him and he nailed this pull. Came back for the second to complete this and was safe on the run out review"
"back of a length close to off stump, punched to mid-off"
"length ball on off stump, defended solidly back down the pitch"
"back of a length close to off stump, and there's all sorts of confusion after Guptill plays late, with soft hands, into the point region. Roy charged in from backward point, and as he did so Guptill and Munro did a whole lot of yesnoyesno, but no one went too far out of his crease for any real alarms"
"back of a length on off stump, defended into the off side"
"back of a length again, on a tight off-stump line, punched to cover point"
"once again, that perfect top-of-off-stump line and length, angling in from slightly wider on the crease this time, and Guptill blocks it back to the bowler. Woakes begins with a maiden"
"perfect start from Wood, the perfect delivery to a left-hander from over the wicket. Full, with late swing to straighten the ball into the stumps. Munro plays all around it, looking to flick with his head falling over. No bat, straight onto front pad, and it's given. Munro's reviewed, however... Definitely no bat on it. It's pitching on middle stump, and it's hitting middle stump. I really don't see why Munro reviewed that unless he perceived some sort of non-existent inside edge"
"back of a length on off stump, and Williamson begins in typically Williamsonesque manner, jumping back and across and tucking it away through square leg"

"back of a length close to off stump, gets on his toes and defends towards cover point"

"length ball close to off stump, defended to short extra-cover"
"back of a length again - he's been utterly metronomic so far - and very close to off stump. Guptill defends nice and late, and the ball bounces behind the wicket, towards slip"
"all the pressure of all those dots, and Guptill has succumbed. Woakes deserves this, but you have to wonder if Guptill went too hard too early. Looks to make a bit of room and hit over mid-off, but the length isn't full enough for that. Hits high on the bat and balloons up for mid-off to move a few steps to his left and catch it"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended into the point region"
"back of a length once more, fifth-stump line, punched into the covers. He's consistently hitting the high part of the bat as well, I should add"

"full now, angling into middle stump, clipped to midwicket"
"back of a length outside off, shuffles forward to push into the covers"
"length ball close to off stump, driven to mid-off"
"looks risky, but pretty routine for Taylor. Length ball angling into off and middle, and Taylor gets forward and - playing around his front pad - works it away to long leg. Don't try this at home, folks"

"length ball angling into off stump, defended back towards the bowler"
"back of a length on off stump, rises on his toes to defend into the covers"
"shortish, fifth-stump line. Williamson looks to jump back and across and work it into the leg side, but has to adjust for the bounce Woakes generates, and plays it back to the bowler instead"
"ooh, <b>nearly plays on</b>. Back of a length again, in that fourth-stump zone, and Williamson is half-forward, looking to play his favourite chop down to third man. Ends up inside-edging it past his leg stump"

"length ball on off stump, punched to mid-on"
"fullish on off stump, and Williamson puts it away sweetly, brings down a perfectly straight bat and just eases it between the non-striker and the umpire, and mid-on has no chance chasing back"
"back of a length outside off, presses forward and lets it come on to guide it down to third man"
"length ball outside off, Taylor looks for the flat-bat drive through cover but doesn't really have the room he needs, ends up checking his shot. Rolls slowly to cover point"
jumps wide of the crease this time and angles one into Taylor's pads. Tucked away to long leg
"length ball, fifth-stump line, defended into the covers"
"shot! Beautifully timed, this. A pretty good length, but it swings away early and provides a bit of width, and Taylor gets on the front foot and strokes it on the up to the left of cover"

"length ball, swings late and straightens towards off stump. Shows the full face and defends back down the pitch"

"back of a length outside off, lets it come on and dabs to the left of backward point"

"ooh. Back of a length, just a bit of width, slapped away crisply but this time straight to Roy at backward point. He fumbles to allow the single"

"back of a length close to off stump, stands tall and punches towards cover point"
"back of a length on off stump, defended towards midwicket"
"short, rises to chest height while angling into Taylor's body. His weight is on the front foot but he manages to bring that bottom wrist into play and pull it away over the long leg boundary. Wow"

"back of a length outside off, chopped down to third man"

"shuffles a couple of steps down the pitch and across to the off side. Curran reacts by bowling a shortish ball outside off, and he dabs gently into the point region to pick up one"
"for the second time in this innings, Williamson <b>nearly chops on</b>. Wanted to dab the ball to third man like he often does, and the ball nipped back in a touch to take the inside edge, before rolling onto his back leg"
"a bit wider outside off this time, and he safely chops it down to third man"
"down the track and Rashid's drift and lack of turn confound him. Wants to clip into the midwicket region, but in the end the ball beats his inside edge and hits his front pad - a feeble lbw appeal, but that struck his pad outside leg stump"
"a bit of flight outside off, driven into the covers"
"down the track again, clips it off middle and leg through square leg"
"this was coming sooner or later. Out of his crease again, and this time Rashid dangles one wider outside off. Not quite to the pitch of it, and he's hitting against the turn, but he just swings freely through the line and clears the long-on boundary"

"short and very wide, and Taylor slaps it away to the point boundary"

"short, angling down leg, and that's not how England would have thought they'd get Williamson, but it is what it is. Looks to pull, they go up in appeal for a gloved caught behind, and it's given out. Williamson doesn't look happy - did he not get a touch on it? In any case, thanks to Munro's wasted review, there's nothing he can do about it"

"<b>England have reviewed for lbw.</b> This is a very full ball that strikes Latham in front of leg stump. He appears to have shuffled and showed leg stump as he misses the flick. This prompts England to take the review...the first look at the replay suggests no evidence of bat. More importantly, it appears the ball wasn't as full as first perceived and therefore is probably pitching outside leg...yes.<b>Pitching outside leg.</b> Review lost."

beaten as he looks to sweep. This climbs up from a good length outside off

"back of a length on off stump, punched to the right of extra-cover"

"back of a length outside off. Taylor goes for the big hoick over the leg side, ends up top-edging it fine to the third man boundary"
"slower ball, back of a length on off stump. Drops it gently into the off side and takes off for the single. Stokes fields in his follow-through, turns, and throws, but misses the stumps at the non-striker's end. He would probably have been in even if the throw had hit the stumps"
Sees him shaping to make room and fires in a full one wide of off stump. Can't connect despite shuffling across in response
"bouncer outside off, and Taylor's found the gap adroitly. Just uses the pace to ramp it, and beats third man to his right. One bounce and over the rope"
"tries to fire in that wide yorker again, and this time it's well wide of the tramline outside off"
"full again, not quite a yorker, and a lot closer to off stump. Taylor clears his front leg, aims for a flat-bat hit over cover, and ends up top-edging to the third man boundary again, just past the right glove of the keeper. They all count..."

"tosses it up slower and much wider, and he fetches a sweep from outside off to deep midwicket, without quite getting down on his back knee"
"floated across the left-hander towards off stump, and he plays a perfect reverse-sweep, except he hits it straight to short third man"

"shortish on off stump, pulled to deep square leg"
"length ball on middle and leg, clipped down to long-on"
"oh man, that's a candidate for shot of the innings. Brings up 150 as well. A near-yorker, on a fourth-stump line, and he brings those hands and wrists into play to squeeze that to the right of backward point and render sweeper cover's dive useless - even though he got his hand to the ball"
"shortish on off stump, pulled to deep square leg"
"full on off stump, and Curran has broken the partnership. Slower ball, and Latham loses his shape while trying to go over mid-off. Got too much undeneath the ball, and ended up slicing it high in the air to backward point"
"shortish, close to off stump, cut hard but straight to backward point"
"tossed up slow, wide of off, swept along the ground to wide long-on"

"digs it in short outside off, and de Grandhomme has ramped this for six! Stunning shot, middles it perfectly, and simply lifts it into the gap to the left of third man"
"slower ball, and de Grandhomme doesn't pick it. His head falls over as he goes into his flick too early, thick inside edge into pad"
"another slower ball, and this time de Grandhomme spots it, holds his shape, and simply flicks it for six. Back of the hand, but it is of no avail, as it goes soaring into the grassy banks beyond deep square leg"
"slower ball again, short, outside off, plays a nice, controlled pull out to deep backward square leg"
"shortish outside off, lets it come on and dabs to third man"
"yorker, right at the base of off stump. Digs it out into the off side, thinks of one, but the bowler moves swiftly in his follow-through to deny him"
"wide yorker, nails the line if not quite the length, and Taylor, reaching out to slash, can't connect"
"low full-toss on off stump, clips it to long-on and hobbles to the other end"
"another yorker outside off, jabbed to the right of backward point"
"full outside off, not quite a yorker. Drives it hard, with a lot of bottom hand, straight to mid-off"
"shortish on off stump, pulled away through square leg"
"short, lots of width too, but he doesn't really move back and across. Just swishes hard at it from a standing start, and doesn't connect"
"low full-toss on off stump, punched hard to mid-off"
"fullish on off stump, whipped to long-on"
"low full-toss again, on off stump, jabbed hard but straight to extra-cover"
"wide full-toss, and de Grandhomme smashes it straight to backward point. He could have hit that anywhere, but he finds the man right on the edge of the 30-yard circle, at knee height. Dunedin goes silent. What a match this is"
"fullish outside off, driven to the left of sweeper cover"
"good yorker, provokes an lbw appeal as Taylor plays around it. Not given, and Taylor looks in a lot of pain. Has he smashed his bat into his own toe? Looks likee an inside-edge too"
"full, slanting away from off stump, driven to sweeper cover"
"wide-ish yorker, stabbed away to the left of the sweeper. Could have taken two had his legs permitted it"
"in the blockhole on leg stump, clipped to the left of midwicket"
"that's yuuuuge! He's been landing his yorker there or thereabouts for two overs now, but this one's underpitched, and it's a half-volley just outside off stump. Taylor swings freely through it and sends it flying over long-on and out of the ground"
"lovely hands. Wide yorker, squeezed away to the right of third man, forcing him into a desperate dive, and they somehow scamper two as well"
"again he misses the yorker, and sends down a wide half-volley. Taylor flat-bats it to the cover boundary, and it's down to under a run a ball again. He's moved into the 170s too"
"slower ball, back of a length on middle stump, tucked away through square leg"
"slower ball on the pads, clipped away to the left of short fine leg. Deep backward square leg runs around to stop it"
"skiddy short ball on off stump and Nicholls doesn't time the pull right. Bottom-edges into the pitch, down by his feet"
"and again, misses the pull. This one's a slower short ball, and it hits top edge, left shoulder, and then rolls down to third man"
back of a length on middle and off. Makes a bit of room and dabs it down to third man
"yorker outside off, jabbed to extra-cover"
"full-toss on off stump, stump-high, and he opens up at the hips and just swats it away over the midwicket boundary. The bat speed was just astonishing"
"length ball on off stump, makes a bit of room and carves it to deep point"
"length ball wide of off, flat-batted to sweeper cover"
"short outside off. He'd usually cut this, but he's thinking six now, and he goes for the big pull and misses"
"in the blockhole close to off stump, flat-batted hard to mid-off and he hobbles through for one"
"full, flicked off his legs to deep square leg, and he retains the strike"
"swings across the line at a full one, misses, there's a huge lbw appeal, that's not given (pitched outside leg, I think), he scrambles out of his crease, he's sent back, he slips. The throw from backward point misses the stumps. Everything is happening, and Henry Nicholls is the bundle of nerves in the middle of it all"
"full outside off, and he drives it hard, along the ground, and straight to mid-off. Oh man."
"full, on the pads, and Nicholls finishes with a six! He's done it! A flick, and it sails flat over the square leg boundary. What a hit. It was in his slot, but he had to put all the nerves of the last few balls out of his mind. He does it, and there's barely a smile on his face at the end of it as Taylor hobbles across to hug him"
