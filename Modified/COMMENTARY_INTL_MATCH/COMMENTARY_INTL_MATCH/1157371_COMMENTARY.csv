"floats this full just outside off, defended gently wide of cover for a quick single"
"shapes to drive, but feet nowhere to the pitch of the ball. Toe-ends this into the off side. Good angles from Mitch Marsh, making him do what the batsman doesn't want to early in his innings."

gets outside the line of the stumps and works this into the leg side.
"turns this gently into the leg side again, the line was more middle and leg this time."
"shapes away a full delivery from middle, Fakhar inside-edges a drive to short mid-on. Once again wasn't leaning into the stroke"
"works this full delivery on the stumps to mid-on, a touch late to get down to the ball. Very, very high backlift so by the time it comes down, it's quite late and hence there isn't much timing."
"works this wide of mid-on, once again off the inner part of the bat. This seems quite a bit of a struggle for Fakhar, he's survived alright but <strong>has looked far from convincing </strong>"

"short of length outside off, Azhar gets on top of the bounce and punches into the gap past extra cover."
"<strong>beauty!</strong> Azhar rooted to the crease, this is full and just a fraction outside off. He has a poke but luckily there isn't much deviation and this whizzes past the outside edge. Mitchell Marsh has been on the money this morning."
"touch short and drifting into middle, defended back"
drifts into off stump and spins away to beat the outside edge as Fakhar prods inside the line of the delivery.
"nice flight, lands this on middle and gets this to break away a bit. Fakhar squirts this forward defensive shot past silly point with soft hands."

toe-ends an attempted slog sweep to short fine. <b> Came off a thick inside edge </b>

reaches out to this tossed up delivery and works it from outside off towards midwicket
"slow, sharp turn from outside off, the length is quite short so Azhar uses all the time he has to go back into the crease and work this to short fine leg."
spins back in to roll off an inside edge to the leg side as Fakhar plays forward
"goes back into the crease, makes room and steers this into the gap behind point. <strong>Should've been three though, lazy running.</strong>"
"tucked into the gap at deep square. Starc had to run in a long way from deep midwicket, better running this time. Sensed the opportunity rather than switch off seeing Starc."
"are they going for a review? Sharp turn that defeats Fakhar's forward prod, the question was if it lobbed off an inside edge onto the pad and then to the keeper. They think about it for a while and <strong>decide against it</strong>"
"<b> oh, dear. Labuschagne has put down a catch at midwicket. </b>. Holland beat Fakhar in flight, got this to dip and it looked like the batsman checked his flick. This was just a simple lob and he should've done better than that. Straight in and out as it was dying on him. Should've been taken. Holland is pretty upset"
"length on the stumps, defended gently."
gets outside the line of the stumps and sweeps with the spin to deep square leg.
"drifts in and spins away to roll off a thick outside edge past slip, they run two to <strong>bring up the half-century stand</strong> Things are happening here for the spinners, Lyon shouldn't be too disappointed."

turns this from a length outside off to short leg.
"this time Azhar is gone, and it's flight from Lyon that has done him in! He was looking to step out and drive against the turn inside-out, didn't get to the pitch, defeated by the dip and only managed to get a thick inside edge as the bat face turned in his hand. Lyon wasn't going to miss that dolly. Azhar Ali's poor run continues. An opportunity went begging in the previous over, not this time around."
"this is a sensational catch at silly point and Lyon is on a hat-trick. Sohail is gone for a first-ball duck. There's drift and bounce from middle, Sohail jabs at this, goes straight off the face of the bat and this is an excellent reflex-action catch by Travis Head. Trouble for Pakistan. What a morning this is turning out to be for Australia."

"shortens his length just a touch, but gives it plenty of revs. He's looking for some bounce and fizz, but there's  not much this time. Defended."
driven but straight to extra cover. Nice flight once again from Holland. Much better start from him here than in Dubai. Pakistan have their backs to the wall and it will need a special effort to wriggle out of this. Who is out to save them?
lunges forward and defends towards short leg. Avoided.
"has this lobbed off an inside edge to short leg? Australia have reviewed. S Ravi was firm in saying not-out. Let's see. There's turn, sharp one at that and there's a very slight deflection onto the pad off an inside edge, or so it appeared. Even before the catch was taken, Paine was pretty sure there was a thin edge. Snicko says there was clearly a spike and so <strong>Australia have three wickets in four balls. </strong> Excellent decision to go for the review. Could've been a tricky one considering they've already lost one, but they went with it and now stand vindicated. Real trouble for Pakistan."
gets well outside the line of the stumps and smothers this.
"what a ball, they're imploding sensationally and this is a poor shot that isn't going to earn him any credit as he walks back. Mickey Arthur is furious. Perfectly pitched. There's a lot of flight from outside off, Babar steps out to drive inside out but is beaten by the dip and turn. He leaves a huge gap between bat and pad, the ball breaks in to beat his swing and crash into the stumps. Lyon can't believe what he's just seen. Sensational morning, a morning of madness. Pakistan are committing hara-kiri. <b> Pakistan have now lost four wickets in six deliveries for no runs </b>"

gets a long way forward and across as he smothers it.
"makes a bit of room and bunts this into the covers looking for a quick single. Fakhar is late to respond but he has to really hare across as the throw is fired quickly to Paine. A direct hit may have had him. Fakhar's bat was in the air as he put in the dive but managed to graze the turf a split-second before the bails came off. Very very close, phew. Pakistan would breathe a sigh of relief."
right behind the line in defence
goes back into the crease and bunts this into the off side

"drifts in short, onto middle and leg, worked with the angle to deep square leg."

"works this to midwicket, there's a slight misfield but they don't take the run."
once again works this with the spin to short midwicket
"sharp turn again from length, Fakhar plays down the wrong line. Was he expecting the googly? Lunged for it and played way outside. Enough gap for the ball to sneak in to hit him just below the knee roll. There wasn't much bounce so height was never going to be in question. Ball tracking confirms this would've gone on to smash into leg. Australia have a big breakthrough at the stroke of tea. What a disappointment, Fakhar falls short of a maiden century. But he's played wonderfully well. Rare lapse in concentration with the tea interval imminent. Labuschagne's legend as a partnership breaker takes another small step."

"flatter and quicker, he shaped to cut but it zipped through and he checked his shot, knocking it away"
"<strong>Edged behind!</strong> Superb leg break! This is a quintessential leg spinners dismissal. Tossed up outside off, Bilal reaches out to defend, it just turns and bounces just enough, not a lot, to catch the outside edge, Paine takes a great catch opening up to his right. Brilliant from Labuschagne."
"shorter leg break outside off, he drives off the back foot to cover"
"tossed up outside off, he drives neatly into the covers"

short ball into the rib cage and he lets it <strong>hit him flush on the left elbow!</strong> He was late to pick it up and braced and copped it right on the bone of the elbow. That really hurts. He's taking his time here. The physio is out with the anti-imflammatory spray to numb the pain. He sits down to take a break with the physio treats him. He is in some pain. The physio just pressed on the spot he was struck and he is writhing in pain.

"decides to slip one in full, Siddle is solid in defence."
"Siddle was expecting this to be outside off, but is suddenly rushed into defending it as the ball comes back in a long way to pin him plumb in front of middle. Shocking decision to not give it out on the field by umpire S Ravi. The height was never in doubt and hawkeye confirms this would've smashed into leg stump.
