"glides in, puts the ball delicately on a length outside off, shaping away as Azhar leans out and leaves alone"
"touch fuller, 139kph/86mph and curling in this time, Azhar brings the bat down on a clip to leg and <i>just</i> gets some inside edge on it before the ball thuds into his front pad"
"pitched up in the channel, on to the front foot and punched to cover"
"full and shaping away, 143kph/89mph and Azhar is well forward this time, plays a firm cover drive but again picks out the fielder"
"pitched up and checked on the drive wide of mid-off, Kohl seizes on it and there's again no run"
"touch shorter, straightening in the corridor of Bamber Boozler, throws his hands up in the air (like he just don't care) and leaves - maiden to start with from Bhuvi"
"starts with a full toss on the pads and Zaman misses out... Bumrah started to think about an lbw appeal but that was rank, missing by a couple of stumps"
"good length on middle, 139kph and defended back to the bowler"
"full, swinging but down the leg side and that's an easy call"
"good pace, angled across from over the wicket on off stump, Zaman thick-edges past his stumps for the first run off the bat"
on the stumps and nudged into a gap to get Azhar off the mark
"goes very full, 146kph/90mph and dug out on leg stump by the alert Zaman"
"tight lines, Zaman happy to gets used to the feel of bat on ball, defends to the on side"
edged but wide of second slip! Bhuvneshwar snakes one menacingly in the corridor outside off and Azhar gets just enough on a fend down to third man for a single
"dropped into the covers, this could be tight... but Jadhav's throw misses! Would have been gone with a direct hit, that was an adrenalin-fuelled call from Zaman but he survives"
pitched up on middle and leg and worked down square for a safe single
"putting pressure on the field again, this was more calculated, whipped wide of mid-on and he beats the throw"
"touch shorter, comes across on off stump and pushes the ball square"
"length on off, 138kph/86mph and defended back towards the bowler"
"on the hips, goes for the flick down the leg side, misses but gets the extra"
"<del>got him, nicked to the keeper!</del> No! <b>Bumrah has bowled a no-ball!</b> Come back Fakhar Zaman, you can have another crack... He was lured into fishing at a quick, bouncy, length ball angled across him and Dhoni took the regulation edge; but they checked the replay and Bumrah was clearly over the line. Just look at Kohli's face! #Fuming"
"ooh er, not sure that was where Bumrah wanted it, either... but he manages to nutmeg Zaman down the leg side and gets away with it. Zaman was trying to swing the free hit into Camberwell but missed"
"doesn't get away with this one, chopped past the stumps again and it races fine for the first boundary"
tucked down into the leg side and again they hustle through for the single
"short, 146kph but he uses the pace to his advantage, Azhar draws himself up and clubs a short-arm jab back past the bowler for four more"
"better length from Bumrah, defended on off stump"
"slides this down the leg side... eventful over, this one"
pitched up and dabbed down short on the leg side
"angled across, 143kph/88mph, short of a length but slapped to backward point"
fullish and pushed along the carpet towards mid-on
"banged in short, Zaman hooks... and gets a boundary off his helmet! They'll go down as leg byes, of course, but that's becoming a trademark shot for him. Beat the top edge but deflected away between keeper and slip"
comes across on off stump and defended
"dug in back of a length, here comes Zaman - already a distinctive sight - dancing down and coshing a pull to deep square leg. Already looking to capitalise on that extra life"
"good length on the stumps, defended solidly coming forwards"
"bit of width, Azhar throws the plumbing at it, gets a thick edge and it <i>flies</i> fine of third man, that's four more. This time Kohli claps his bowler in encouragement, knowing that on another day the edge could have gone to hand"
"fullish, comes forward and pings it to mid-off"
"now that's not an attractive shot... Azhar swings like Babe Ruth but completely fails to connect, might have nipped back off the seam"
slides this one down the leg side... another freebie from Bumrah
"slower ball from Bumrah, nicely bowled, played without timing into the covers"
"that's got timing a-plenty, though, as Azhar steps across on off and whistles a glance through backward square, giving fine leg no chance"
"good length on off, Azhar keeps his composure and defends once more"
"shortish and worked off the hip, fielded on the edge of the ring but they scamper another quicker single"
pitched up and Azhar forgets his 'strong and stable' mantra again and miscues a heave back towards the bowler
good length around off stump and pushed gently back down the track
"slightly fuller and tailing in, 137kph/85mph and Azhar breaks the wrists on a dab wide of mid-on, it's a tight run but again the throw is off target"
"taking the pace off to Fakhar again, prodded into the covers"
"full and straight, 140kph/87mph and drilled back down the pitch by Zaman.. but Bhuvnesh is alert and grabs it in his follow through"
"tossed up, spinning in and tapped down to the on side"
"flighted, this spins past the inside edge and down the leg side as Azhar works across the line"
tossed up and pushed down the ground coming forwards for one to long-on
"oh dear, not a good start to Zaman, pushed well down the leg side for another wide"
"floated up on the pads, Zaman closes the face and clips a single past midwicket"
pushed through outside off and steered towards point
"on the charge, dumped over long-off! Azhar plays the shot that won Pakistan the Oval Test against England last year, dancing down and smiting Ashwin cleanly beyond the boundary boards. Pow, right in the kisser!"
flatter on off and Azhar blocks
"digs in the short ball, good pace and it climbs above Zaman's attempted pull"
"good length, slanted across the southpaw, who stabs the ball towards cover"
"another bumper, again Zaman swings the haymaker but fails to connect... did that flick the shoulder? Dhoni claims it without a murmur"
"tight around off stump, good length and Zaman gets into line"
"pushed across, still offering no width, comes off the glove and runs towards backward point"
"now very leg side, cramping Zaman, who swishes across the line and the ball deflects off the pad towards point... another maiden for Bhuvneshwar, amid the hurly-burly"
tossed up and worked with the turn to the on side
"flighted, outside off but Azhar is well forward and down early, collars the sweep and it flies hard and flat through deep backward square to bring up the Pakistan 50. They're looking in decent shape"
tossed up and worked back down the ground for one
"tries to come down the pitch but he's nowhere near the ball, slowed down and dipping as he heaves and gets a thick inside edge through square leg"
"full and flighted, tickled into the leg side for one more"
"not sure he knew where that was going either, flatter from Ashwin, going on rather than turning and Zaman thick-edges past his stumps"
"over the wicket, angled across slightly back of a length and guided to third man"
"worked off the pads down into the midwicket area, this is another risky single, Azhar is out of the frame as Rohit hurls to the non-striker's end... but misses!"
"lovely shot, smoked like a kipper back down the ground for four! Touch too full but the timing was everything, just a punch but then it took off, beat mid-on and rattled away"
"round the wicket now, bit of width in the channel, slashed through point"
"lbw appeal, Azhar rapped on the knee walking across... Kohli elects not to review. Maybe outside the line? Height also an issue, as he had moved some way down"
"fuller, darting in to thud the pads again... but that's missing leg stump"
"round the wicket, pushed through on the stumps, worked to fine leg"
tossed up and worked in front of square with a turn of the wrists
"full, drifting in on the pads, clipped to midwicket"
full and flighted and whipped away square coming forwards
"round the wicket, angled in flat, this time Zaman backs his defence"
"clubbed through the leg side, Zaman gets another boundary, stepping down and flicking firmly off the legs"
"shortish, comes across on off stump and defends"
"fired down the leg side, did that flick the pad? No, the umpire signals wide"
"back of a length on off, worked towards midwicket as he moves into line"
"full and fading to the leg side, again raps the pads and it rolls away square for a single"
stays in the crease and works one off the hips fine
"pitched up and clipped wide of mid-on, Yuvraj has to move to his right and again they hurtle through safely"
"dropped into the covers, Pakistan's running continues to veer between the sublime and the, well, risky... But again the throw misses, with Zaman glancing over his shoulder as he runs the bat in. They've not quite hit 'ridiculous' yet"
"continuing to push the ball in from round the wicket, turned off the pads"
"tossed up, bit more action on the ball, Azhar leans on it and breaks the wrists for one square"
"floated up full and Zaman attempts to reverse-sweep, doesn't get a good connection and point cleans up"
pushed through and hits the pads as he stays planted outside leg stump
on the stumps and worked for one
"tossed up on middle and off, softly turned through square leg"
"that's a good nut to start with, nipping the ball back off a length, hits the back leg... Richard Kettleborough not interested in the lbw appeal. No bat involved, that looked a pretty close shout, but again Kohli saves his review"
"dug in short, that's a feisty bumper, Zaman can't do much other than ride it and keep the ball down"
"dug in again this time he nails the pull, straight out to deep square leg on the bounce"
"sliding on to the pads, flicked fine for one"
shortish and whipped away off the back foot through the leg side
"short outside off and Azhar clouts four more, slashed in the air but behind backward point and it gives third man no chance to cut it off"
"angled flat on the stumps, Zaman prods one back past the bowler"
"fizzed through on the stumps, pushed back to the off side and Jadeja springs after it to field"
"angled in, Azhar comes down the pitch, doesn't get to the pitch but manages to squeeze a single back down the ground"
"Zaman uses his feet as well, crunches a drive towards wide long-on... but an excellent flat throw from the deep keeps them to one"
"tossed up on off, pushed through mid-off coming forwards"
"sliding across the left-hander, who stays back and guides to backward point - tidy opening over from Sir Jaddu"
"dug in short, rising over off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"full, 138kph/86mph and tailing in to middle stump, clipped firmly but well cut off on the dive at midwicket by Yuvraj"
"length ball, Azhar draws himself up and punches with a high elbow, Kohli swoops on it at short extra cover"
"skips down, attempting to hit over the top... and he does, in a way, but sliced from high up on the bat and <i>just</i> out of reach of mid-off and cover!"
shortish and worked off the hip for one
pitched up and prodded back past the bowler for another single
"stays leg side of a full, but flat, delivery outside off and carves it through cover point. That is Pakistan's best opening stand in ICC events against India"
"tosses it up, but it dips before Zaman can get to it on the half-volley. Pushes it to mid-on"
stays back and blocks a good length ball on off stump
"sees a slightly slower, slightly wider delivery and yanks it over to deep midwicket with a slog sweep"
"a hint of turn, but it's nothing to trouble Azhar, who drives through the line to sweeper cover"
"an outstanding shot to bring up Pakistan's hundred. The fearless Zaman steps out to Jadeja - that's a hard thing to do - gets to the flat, good length ball where it pitches and belts it past long-on's left"
"out comes a frantic 'yeah, yeah, yeah' as Azhar pops a length ball to short midwicket's left and the quick single is easily taken"
"skirts <b>past the outside edge</b>! Oh you tease, says Zaman as he looks back to watch the good length ball dart through to the keeper"
"tiniest little width and Zaman carves it behind point. Jadeja's there, he gets a bad bounce, he puts his body behind it, crawls over like a baby demanding its favourite toy stay with them and then promptly, as if he's lost the mood, throws the ball to hit the stumps at the strikers end. Totally off balance. But nails it like a boss"
""
"swivels on the back foot and Azhar places it well enough behind square leg to think about two, not there."
"short and wide, Zaman sizes it up, in an alternate universe he'd have spring boots that propel him high enough to smash that over point. Unfortunately here, he has to let the ball go"
"shortish and outside off, punches it through cover"
"times the pants off a slightly shortish delivery outside off, but he picks out point"
"goes wide of the crease for a reasonably full delivery - and yet Zaman cuts it! And how well has he done it too. Waits just enough, makes his room and carves it behind point"
"cramps him up by firing it down leg, Zaman backs away and punches to long-on"
"good length ball on middle and leg, clips it through to deep square leg and Azhar Ali has fifty! The man who lost the captaincy. The man they said bats too slowly for this format. He's making a statement."
"another! This is brilliant batting. They're using Jadeja's pace. They're taking him on to make sure India have even more headaches. Oh, and Zaman has fifty too! Pakistan have all the momentum now, as this shot, a step away crash right through Yuvraj at point, establishes. Third fifty in row for the new opener"
"back of a length on middle, punches to mid-on"
"controls the hook so well, hanging back, waiting for the ball to come at him, at head high, and then rolls his wrists as well to keep it down to long leg"
on the pads and Zaman flicks it away like it was an errant mosquito
"another hook, playing this one in the air like he just doesn't care. Mostly because square leg is deep"
"pummels the short ball to the left of deep midwicket. Fierce, off the front foot. This is getting tasty. Pakistan are looking like they're pushing on"
"looks to upper cut a short ball way outside off, but isn't able to. One of Azhar's go-to shots really, in one-day cricket. He smiles after it fails. Recalibrate!"
"pushes it through on leg stump, Zaman moves away to block it"
"a half stop from Yuvraj at point, moving to his left, makes sure this cut shot only ends up a single"
"beautiful placement! That's how you put away a bad ball. MS yelps from behind the wicket his displeasure as Azhar carves the ball behind point, well out of the reach of Jadhav"
"slower through the air, but still wide enough that Azhar can hang back and cut to the left of the sweeper"
"tosses it up, he steps forward to punch to cover"
"looks for another drive, but it goes straight to short cover. Wicket-to-wicket bowling without any wickets yet"
"pushes it into the pads, Zaman moves away and clips to square leg"
uses the angle from around the wicket to his advantage as he pushes to long-on
"flatter delivery on off stump, pushes to long-on"
"cuts a ball, pretty full, slanting so far down leg. Jadeja is bowling this line because Zaman is giving himself so much room"
"Yuvraj hits the stumps at the non-strikers. Has Zaman made it? The third umpire comes in. He watches the visuals, watches as Zaman gets away a little nudge to short midwicket and puts in a full-length dive, keeps his bat down as well"
"he's gone! His partner was ball watching and he has to pay for it! Azhar's one! India have their breakthrough. The Oval erupts. Oh, this is poor from Pakistan. There's always a single there, and Azhar had made sure of it, placing the clip to the left of square leg. And it's India's weak fielder there too - Bumrah. He basically trips over himself and falls on top of the ball. Then has the good sense to pick the right end - the keeper's - and Azhar has to walk off, muttering to himself."
"fuller delivery on leg stump, Zaman drives to mid-on"
"tries to pull off a reverse sweep, which is a useful shot to have when you are moving away all the time. Doesn't pick the gap at point"
"fuller delivery on middle, clips to short midwicket"
nudges it behind square leg
"fires it in on leg stump, Zaman makes room, but he has to settle for hitting short midwicket"
waits on the flighted delivery and nudges it to the left of short midwicket. Only one from the over. India are masters at this. Going through their overs quickly and giving very few runs
"flatter delivery on leg, punches it to long-on"
"shortish and on leg stump, clips it through midwicket"
"shortish and outside off, carves it in front of short third man, and Bumrah covers it well"
"races down the track and heaves it down to long-on's left. Two there, two taken"
"slower through the air, from around the wicket, Zaman is into his push early and the ball pops up for a slight distance towards long-on"
"loads of flight, and enough dip that Babar can only tap it to short midwicket"
"wallops it over long-on! And look at it go. Zaman certainly does. Races down the track - a fast one, so credit to his quick footwork for coming down the track and manufacturing the length he likes - and then gives it the good old tonk"
next one is predictably quicker and shorter and Zaman carves it behind point. He's signalling a momentum shift. Manifestation of which is Kohli being forced to come up to his bowler and put a consoling arm around Jadeja's shoulder
punches to long-on
"good length ball, with a little flight outside off, drives to short cover"
"flatter delivery outside off, slaps it to sweeper cover"
"smacks it over cover! There's no one there so who cares how he times it. Jadeja tries, in vain, to one-up the advancing batsman who is making room. But he reaches out and scythes the ball over the top of the packed offside infield. Sixteen off the over"
drills a shortish delivery on off stump to long-on
"pushes it through down leg, because Zaman is constantly moving to leg. This time, the clever guy, stays put and collects a wide"
another one down leg. Ashwin is faltering...
"how has he hit that so well?! He has no balance. His head is all over the place. So much for the people yelping about technique. He comes down the track, so Ashwin slows it down and throws it wide. Still the batsman reaches out and clatters it straight down the ground"
"and then the picture perfect cover drive, making Bhuvi on the long-off boundary dive to stop the boundary. Zaman is on song!"
"fuller delivery outside off, blocks"
a neat little dab behind square leg to return the strike over to the bulldozer
"thick outside edge, which runs away to the third man boundary. Sixteen run over followed by a 17 run over. Pakistan off and running. Plays the late cut, but I'm not sure he intended for it to go so fine"
clatters a short and wide delivery to deep point
"gloves it over the keeper. He's an instinctive hooker.  Just can't help himself, and often he doesn't time the ball when the ball climbs up to his throat as this has. Anyway, he's into the nineties."
"taps and runs to cover, where Yuvraj, one of the older players in the squad, is posted. Good cricket"
<b>beats him</b> with a back of a length delivery outside off. Babar was looking to steer it to third man
good shot! Gets on top of the long hop on leg stump and pulls it smartly to the right of the deep fielder at square leg.
"full length ball on off stump, defends"
"shortish and outside off, carves it towards short third man"
drives a flighted delivery on leg stump to long-on
"tosses it up on off stump, blocks it to short midwicket"
"loops it over the eyeline, gets it to dip, Babar can only push it towards mid-on, but Kohli intercepts it from short midwicket"
"shortish and outside off, cuts to point"
"lovely tight lines, with Ashwin getting dip. Kohli has pulled his field up as well to keep the new man on strike. No run to square leg"
swivels on the back foot and pulls a short ball on his ribs to long leg
"shortish and outside off, steers it to point"
"good length ball outside off, kicks up off the pitch a bit and Babar is beaten. Hits the seam and straightens as well."
"fuller delivery on off stump, punches to mid-on"
slices a back of a length delivery outside off to deep third man
"cramps him with a shortish delivery on the hips, Zaman tries to short-arm jab it behind square leg. Has to settle for a leg bye"
"premeditates a sweep and he's there! Sensational Hundred! The Oval stands up to appalaud. The Pakistan flags reach for the sky and Zaman soaks it all in. Gets to the mark with a shot that he is in no position to time. He's reaching for it, the ball is slow and well outside off, he has to make all the power, and that is hard to do when he is off balance. And yet...."
slices a full delivery outside off to short cover
"shot! Steps down the pitch, making room, and Aswhin bowls just outside off, which gives him all the opportunity he needs to lift over cover"
<b>inside edge</b> as Zaman slaps at a full delivery outside off and the ball zips through off Dhoni's kene to short fine leg
"fuller delivery on leg stump, pushes to long-on"
punches down the ground and Ashwin dives across to his right to stop it
"well-directed bumper, angled across outside off, Zaman nods it through"
"pitched up, in the channel, waits for it and opens the face but steers the ball to backward point"
"dug in, Zaman isn't in control as he hooks at this, comes off the splice but loops square of midwicket and bounces away for a couple"
"leg side from Pandya, steps across but can't force it through the infield"
"length, 134kph/82mph in the channel, Zaman cagily prods through square to deep point"
"short ball, doesn't get up all that high and Babar belts a pull in front of square, Dhawan does really well to save a boundary hurling himself forward in front of the rope"
"tossed up and smoked into the stands at deep midwicket! Wham, bam, thank you, Zaman! Nicely in the slot and he clears the front leg, scoops it high into the Alec Bedser Stand for his third six"
tossed up and he skips down to thrash one of the covers
"over the wicket, flighted on off, Babar goes down early and paddles one fine"
"round the wicket, pushed through and worked to midwicket from the crease"
"flat trajectory outside off, goes back to steer one through backward point - that's the Pakistan 200. But they want more, so much more"
"Ashwin gives this some air, spins into the pads as Babar comes down and isn't able to work it away"
"slogged into the air - and brilliantly taken by Jadeja running back from point! Pandya has taken the BIG wicket, Zaman won't be finishing this innings off, he departs for a sparkling maiden ton - and India have a window to get back in and try to burgle the initiative again! Ugly shot, stepping away and trying to smear over the leg side, the ball was pushed a touch wide for that, and it went straight up and down behind square on the off side"
comes across and defends a shortish ball outside off
"back of a length, stays deep and opens the face down to third man"
"lovely ball, teasing length in the channel and Babar throws the bat at a drive, beaten past the edge"
shortish on the stumps and swatted away with a horizontal bat
"full, 137kph a foot or so outside off, Malik leans into a crisp drive but picks out extra cover"
back of a length outside off and steered through backward point from the crease
"fullish on off, jabbed back towards the bowler"
"in the channel, Malik drops back and angles the bat to run a single to third man"
"that'll help, a full toss on the legs and Babar rotates the wrists on business-like flick to deep backward square leg"
"length ball on off, prodded into the covers"
"touch shorter, Babar plays nice and straight to punch one more out to the deep cover sweeper"
dug in very short and Babar misses with a cross-batted swipe
"touch short of a length, Babar gets on top of it and steers into a gap in the covers for a couple"
full now and bunted towards mid-off coming forwards
"length, 138kph/86mph and muscled over midwicket, Babar shows no respect for a perfectly decent ball and picks up another boundary"
goes back and across and pushed a single through point
"back of a length, Shoaib tucks it down towards midwicket"
"pushed through outside off, dabbed through cover point"
"round the wicket, flat on off stump, Malik punches another single square"
fizzed through and taken through the covers off the back foot again
"now Shoaib skips out, he's to the pitch despite Jadeja's pace, and wallops six into the stands by the groundsman's hut! Malik sounds the cavalry horn - toot, toot!"
"fired in again and pushed through mid-off, neatly done, keeps the strike turning over"
angled in and worked back past the bowler
"short and wide and slugged over backward point, not entirely in control but he went hard at it - the Boom Boom Dictum - and it flew wide of third man and away"
"on the stumps, touch short and clipped off his legs, superbly timed and it's into the wide open spaces at deep backward square leg"
"good length on off, pushed back to the bowler"
slings this one down the leg side - another in the extras column
shortish outside off and slapped off the back foot through the covers for one more
"length, angled in at 134kph/83mph and Babar flicks one behind square"
"slams in the bouncer to finish, that had some heat on it and Malik can't connect with a pull... Decent figures from Pandya, 10-0-53-1 in unforgiving conditions"
"low arm, pushed through on the stumps, Babar rocks back and heaves a pull through square leg"
"flat outside off, Malik is batting in a cap and he throws his hands through a sliced drive, almost gets it past the man on the ring but a good stop prevents four"
on the stumps and shovelled back through mid-on
"worked off the legs, they think about two but won't get back for the second"
"this is almost Malinga-esque round-arm from Jadhav, Babar watches it slide behind his legs"
slung down behind the legs once again. Erm...
tossed up and bunted down the ground for one to long-off
"urgh, filth from Jadhav, a long hop that Shoaib should by all rights blast into exile, never to be seen again... but he's almost falling over by the time it reaches him and ends up slapping straight to cover"
"good length in the channel, waits in the crease and runs one to third man"
tight line and Malik comes across to push towards cover
"Bhuvi wins the mini-battle, short of a length and quick, rising through to the keeper as Malik swings hard and misses"
"and he wins over the distance, too! TKO for Malik, who swats an ungainly shot high out towards deep cover for a simple catch! This was short outside off, Malik seemed to be trying to forehand smash it through the off side but sent it ballooning up and over the infield"
"this is Rolls Royce precision from Bhuvnesh, worked back down the track for no reward"
"length on off, tucked off the hip but again finds the fielder - superb over, just a single and the wicket from it. Look at those figures from Bhuvneshwar so far!"
and straight away Hafeez leaps out of his crease to hammer a four past long-off
darted in and pushed back to the bowler
comes across on off and pokes into the covers

dabbed on the back foot behind point
tossed up and Babar comes forward to tickle another single
"full outside off and driven into the ground, over the leaping Bhuvnesh in his follow through"
"Hafeez is rooted on the crease, wanting to come forwards but unable to as Bhuvnesh bangs it in"

"hammers the middle of the pitch, this one is too high though"
"low full toss, on the pads and whipped away through square leg for one"
"full and straight, 134kph/83mph, Babar clips another single off his pads"
"good length, snaking in towards middle, Hafeez nurdles one more behind square"
dobbed on the stumps and pushed back towards the bowler
tossed up and gets this away down the ground
"the floater does it, chipped to long-off! Babar was moving around his crease, Jadhav continued to dolly the ball up innocuously, no pace on it for the batsman to work with and he sends it straight down the throat of Yuvraj standing on the boundary. No fifty for Babar, and Jadhav's, ahem, efforts pay off again"
pushed through and steered fine of short third man for one
"round the wicket, slow and loopy outside off,  Imad goes back and slaps through point"
lobbed up and stroked down towards long-off coming forwards

"angled across the left-hander, who sits back and cuts for one"

murderous blow! Imad clears the front leg and sends this with blunderbuss power straight back down the ground for another Dorothy
"lobbed up and he skips out again, doesn't quite get hold of it, one towards long-off"
"over the wicket, flat on off, Hafeez taps back past the bowler"
"starts with a back-of-a-length ball in the channel, Hafeez cuts at it and misses"
"length and <i>hammered</i>, way back over the rope at deep square leg! Hafeez creams the previously immaculate Bhuvnesh into the crowd, picked the slower ball - and brings up the Pakistan 300 in the process"
on the stumps and worked down the ground
"well bowled, up in the blockhole, Imad can only dig it out but they get one through mid-on"
"full and wide of the stumps, sliced through backward point, Jadhav does well in the deep to slide and stop it - and they perhaps should have run better, only managing two"
low full toss on the pads but Haafez can only swing it for one to deep midwicket
"slower ball, wide of the stumps, swatted through backward point"
"goes wide of the left-hander, comes out as a low full toss but Imad can't do much with it, slugged down the ground"

"stand and deliver, Imad channels Adam and the Ants, backs away to a slower ball and <i>smears</i> it for four, beating the man at long-off"
"sprayed across, full and wide and Imad misses out"
"pitched up, again Imad can't get under it, drills a single to long-off"
"hits the blockhole once again, Imad shovels it into the leg side"
"Hafeez seemed to be thinking of a ramp or paddle shot here, getting low outside off but he changes his mind at the last minute and pushes short into the covers"
"spears the ball in full on leg stump, 143kph/88mph and chopped through midwicket to the sweeper"
"goes very full and wide, might even have been a wide if Hafeez hadn't chased after it and managed to bottom edge wide of the keeper for one"
"now Imad tries to improvise, switching his hands over, Bhuvnesh maybe spots this and bounces him, ends up coming off the arm guard towards fine leg"
"this has been another superb over from Bhuvnesh, he wins the bluffing battle with Hafeez, full ball outside off and he can't connect"
goes across his stumps early to try and scoop but Bumrah follows him with laser precision and fires it into the pads
"round the wicket, brilliant yorker from Bumrah, through Hafeez off bat and pad, into the stumps... but the bails stay on! That has <i>smashed</i> into the base of off stump, the bail jumped - although didn't light up - then landed back in its groove!"
"full again, Hafeez can't get under it, bunts through the covers"
"that's high, swung away for one - but signaled as a no-ball, so bonus for Pakistan"
"angled in full on leg stump, Hafeez slugs it in front of deep midwicket for a couple more"
"full, tailing in and clipped through midwicket for one"
"full on off, Imad muscles it powerfully back down the ground, long-off doesn't collect cleanly - and Bumrah has overstepped! So that's another free hit coming up"
"comes back well with a slower ball, dipping outside leg stump and Imad can't lay bat on it, ricochets away off the pads for a leg bye"
"superb yorker to start with, fired in from over the wicket, Imad jams down on it for one"
"brilliant stuff, full and wide, Hafeez chops it back to the bowler, who stays calm and fields in his follow through as the batsman dives for his crease"
"nailed, straight back down the ground! Didn't look like Hafeez was in a good position to play this, low off the bat but clean enough to sail all the way, a much-needed blow"
full on off and dug out through the covers for a single
"now the bouncer, excellent pace and direction, Imad is tucked up and can't connect on the pull"
"short ball, Imad swings hard but again fails to brings about a commensurate result, squirts for one through the covers, no getting back for a second - so Pakistan fall just short of 340 but still post a pretty impressive score after being inserted"
"<b>inside edge</b> as Rohit tries a cover drive, reaching away from his body. Oooh, he normally leaves balls like that at the start of the innings"
"there we go. Spots the good length ball, darting past him with the angle. Says he wants nothing to do with it"
"you absolute beauty! This is why Pakistan wanted Amir, even a version that only just recovered from a back spasm. The inswing. This scary, sensational, freakish ability to move the ball even on the flattest conditions at searing pace. Rohit is about as ready for this ball as the we are for Bruce Willis to actually go to outer space and drill a hole into an asteroid. #Armageddon. Stuck in the crease, plays around his front pad. Pinned on the knee roll.,Gone"
"beats him first ball! At 145 kph, 90 mph! A fast bwler's friendly hello to the world's leading batsman"
"drills the overpitched delivery down to mid-off, but Malik moves to his right quickly and stops it"
shuffles across onto off stump and clips it through square leg
blocks a shortish delivery on off stump and sets off for a single. His captain says no
"cramps him with a good length ball at 136 kph, this is the length, the one where the batsman doesn't know whether to come forward and drive or hang back and flick. Dhawan gets a bottom edge onto pad"
steps forward to block a delivery head-hunting for that mythical thing called 'top of off stump'
he's been brilliant against the short ball this tournament. Seems that's where his work to play late really shows. Sends one coming to his head down to long leg
"some seam movement outside off this early in the innings and Kohli, wisely, ignores the ball angled across him"
shifts onto off stump to whip a ball off his hips to long leg
"outside edge zips through point and cover point. Kohli, moving onto off stump to open up the leg side, plays a touch too early. Amir is a clever bowler. He won't keep looking at 145 kph."
"pitches it up on off stump, Kohli drills it back to the bowler and Amir collects it himself and aims a throw. The Indian captain, grinning all the way, brings up a hand to say 'stop, let's not go overboard'."
"<b>dropped</b> by first slip, Azhar Ali! He yanks his cap off his head and throws it to the ground, wishing it would open up under him. It is a dolly really. Coming around about waist high, needing him to move to his right. Azhar does so, lines the ball up so well to grab at it with both hands but it pops out. Poor Amir. He bowls a peach and it's all for naught. It's back of a length, nipping away just a touch to beat the middle and take the edge. Even one of the No. 1 ranked batsman"
"got him next ball. Amir, you legend! He takes flight. He punches the air like it spoke ill of his family. A fit, even a half fit bowler like him is worth tons for a team. This is back of a length, on off stump, and Kohli, looking to move across and flick into the on side gets a leading edge straight to point. Amir makes him play early. Amir sends him back. Amir puts a smile on Pakistan's face. Amir is making The Oval chant his name"
"fuller delivery on off stump, pushes it towards point, tentatively..."
defends a back of a length ball on middle
"back of a length on off stump, Yuvraj blocks and looks up to think if he could escape the strike. But point, cover point and another man from the slips race up to stop it all. Pakistan switched on"
opens the face and runs the shortish delivery towards point
"short and outside off, Yuvraj evades it"
"shapes for the pull, but considering the situation, Yuvraj thinks against the aggressive option"
"looks for that famous punch off the back foot, but he is a touch unsure. Not the Yuvraj of old who'd come to the crease two down and bully the bowlers."
"off the bottom of the bat goes the back foot drive to cover. Maiden from Junaid. Pakistan, top draw."
"low full toss on middle, flicks to square leg"
"on the pads, attempts a flick, it comes off the pad and Dhawan looks for the single. Yuvraj says no. India looking to just survive this devastating salvo from Pakistan"
"well played! He takes on the short ball and hooks it so well that Amir will think twice about this ploy. He shouldn't but the timing, and the time itself he had to put the ball away, will make him nervous"
"nearly past mid-on, but again, Malik moves to his right and stops a boundary. Dhawan's drive this time, looking a million bucks"
"picks the slower ball, and this time he'll have the boundary. Delays his contact with the ball, then pounces on the width. Sublime batting"
"<b>just past point</b> and a flying Shadab Khan! The shot is Dhawan's strength, hanging back and punching the ball with an open face. Places it just well enough"
clips a fuller ball on middle to long leg
nails a backfoot drill to mid-on
stays beside the back of a length delivery on off stump and blocks to cover. Hard hands. Sign of nerves. He can't dab and run yet. Can't manouevre the field yet
"top edge as he goes for the hook, and the 134 kph delivery, coming at his left ear, soars over the keeper"
<b>beats him</b> for pace and bounce. Nothing is a flat pitch if you have a bowler who is fired up. And Junaid certainly is. Languid glide to third man thwarted
rooted to the crease as he blocks to cover point
"slips it into the pads. Dhawan's flick doesn't meet the ball in time, so India take a leg bye to long leg"
"thinks about it... Can I? Can I? Can I really? Eventually, the back of a length delivery, searching high and low for the outside edge is left alone"
covers the line of a back of a length delivery at 143 kph just outside off
well played! This good length ball is hurtling into the middle of middle stump but Yuvraj plants the big broad face of his bat on it instead.
steps forward to block a 142 kph missile just outside off
"firm push to the right of cover, but that infield is tighter than a jam jar that was left alone for millions of years"
hammers it through that off side infield that seems so impregnable with Yuvi on strike. Course he gets tripe to deal with too. Short and wide. Smashed through cover
blocks a slightly slower delivery outside off to cover point
"beautiful shot! There's width. There's plenty of traffic in the cover region. Bumper to bumper and yet his flash threads the gap. Dhawan on the move, and importantly for India, signs of swing are vanishing"
reads that the next ball will be straight and is ready with the flick to long leg
"<b>past him</b>! His front foot is not ready to move. This is a simple fuller delivery on off stump, and it skirts past the tame poke through to Sarfraz"
"on the back foot for a punch to mid-on. Yuvi's holding on, gamely. He is betting on finding his timing soon enough. And when he does..."
"back of a length on off stump, blocks"
"143 kph, gets in line with a shortish delivery on off stump and punches to cover point. The speeds he's bowling, you'd never have thought he had a back spasm"
"full on off stump, at 143 kph, defends"
nicely played. This is a pretty good ball. Looking for middle stump. But Dhawan softens the hands on his bat and pushes it to mid-on for a quick single. Lovely batting
opens the face and rides the width outside off for a single to third man
"nicked off, It's Amir again! This time with extra bounce! Is there anything he can't do?! The perfect ball. It's a cross-seamer - brilliant thinking - in that off stump corridor. Dhawan loads up the glide to third man, as Amir might have predicted as he held the ball across the seam, willing it to bounce more. And it does. Grazes the outside edge through to Sarfraz who leaps for joy. This is the power of a fast bowler on a mission. They end games in a matter of minutes."
"tries to defend a tossed up delivery from around the wicket, doesn't quite connect"
"in full flow! It's taken a while, and it comes against the spinner, who Yuvi likes. Gallops down the track to meet the flighted delivery at its pitch and heaves it over wide long-on"
"looks to flick a tossed up delivery on middle, but he doesn't hit it. Weathers an lbw appeal as the umpire things this would slide down leg"
drives a flighted delivery on off stump to long-on
steps down the pitch and there is enough power that a half stop from mid-on doesn't stop it from its single-minded trek to the boundary
"stands up tall and smacks a short ball on off stump through extra cover. He struggled against pace, but looks top notch against spin"
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
moves across to off stump for a full delivery and blocks to mid-off. A ball most other right-handers would have come forward to block. But don't argue with Dhoni. The entire Oval will be down your throat the way they're chanting his name
blocks another near-yorker delivery on off stump from deep in his crease
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
lets go a good length ball outside off
moves across the stumps and ignores a short of a length delivery angled across him. Flicks his pad along the way to the keeper
"fuller ball on off stump, drives to mid-off"
"spots the short ball so early that he is into the shot a bit too early. Somehow though, Yuvi's timing sends it almost all the way to the midwicket boundary. Good work from Zaman out there"
works a shortish delivery on the hips through vacant midwicket
"full on off stump, finds mid-off with the full face of the bat"
"short of a length and outside off, Dhoni lets it loiter along in the corridor of uncertainty"
"plants it fuller, but Dhoni won't bite outside off"
"tosses it up on leg stump, Yuvraj flicks through midwicket. Calls of 'teek hai, teek hai [it's okay],' from Sarfraz"
"comes down the track, looking to drive through cover. But this is the googly, which spins past the middle of the bat, takes the inside edge and wanders through midwicket"
"good length ball, on off stump, flatter as well. Dhoni comes down the pitch to block"
drives the flighted ball outside off to the sweeper
"toldja he bowls a mean googly. Loops it up, the ball nice and tempting, bringing out the cover drive and leaving it behind"
"<b>huge appeal for lbw</b>, Shadab thinks it is pad first, and it's the sharp-turning leggie as well. Shadab is absolutely certain. He has convinced his captain to <b>review</b>. Replays show that it is pad first. Hits low as well. But Yuvi has a decent stride in. On-field call is not out. But it has to be changed! Ball-tracker shows it will hit middle of middle and the 18-year old has a strike all his own. Made his captain take DRS and then celebrates a vital wicket."
"back of a length on off stump, slaps it into the covers"
crashes a short delivery outside off to point
"taken by the deep square leg fielder. Dhoni's gone! The leg trap, the short ball trap was set and it's been sprung! There's a quick check for the no-ball. And Hasan's fine. He is better than fine after bowling this short ball, rising up towards Dhoni's ribs, cramping him on middle and leg. The batsman swings hard, and he's a good puller, Dhoni. This time though, he top edges to Imad, running in and diving foward. Hasan pulls out his trademark celebration, the pretend smoke bomb onto the pitch and as the smoke clears he is there, arms spread wide, looking like a proper hero."
"you ripper! Shadab again, this time at point, leaping to his left, flying actually, to grab the slap behind point from Hardik. Saves runs. Looks awesome"
"fuller ball on off stump, pushes to mid-on, spots the weak fielder Junaid and pinches the single"
"fuller delivery outside off, no shot"
"googly again, tossed up, but at 94 kph. Pandya works it through midwicket"

seems to read the legbreak out of the hand as he drives through cover
gets his front leg down the line and pushes a flighted delivery to long-off

loads of pace - 143 kph - makes Jadhav's bat turn in his hand as he pushes to mid-on
yanks a back of a length delivery outside off to mid-on with a whirl of his wrists
"short and on off stump, Jadhav evades it"
"oh, outstanding! Jadhav humiliates a perfectly good ball with nothing more than a roll of his wrists. Shuffles across to get in line and then produces a whiplash that could inspire tornadoes. Super shot through midwicket"
"tosses it up outside off, drives to short cover"
picks the gap behind point. The ball is only slightly short and Pandya picks it early and smashes it to the left of the fielder
belts an overpitched ball on leg stump to long-on
"tosses it up, slowly, on off stump and Jadhav blocks"
presents the full place of the bat on middle. The ball seems to skid on.
"top edge and the captain takes it himself at cover! 'Yaaaah,' he yells feeling a Champions Trophy coming his way. He sees Jadhav shaping to pull a short ball, he loves that it goes straight up, he sends nearly six of his team-mates rushing for the same catch back and takes it himself"
comes forward and pushes a couple through the covers

"oof, that's a tasty shot, leans out and hammers a lofted drive well back over long-on, first six of the innings - better late than never?"
floated up on off stump and strokes through the covers coming forwards

"tossed up straight, under the eyes and punched towards midwicket"
lobbed up from over the wicket and driven through mid-off

floated full and worked into a gap square
"dragged down, Pandya waits in the crease and steers it down to long-on again"
"tossed up and fetched into the (rapidly emptying) stands! That's a meaty blow, showing his power with a swing to cow corner"
"six more, in the slot and he clears the rope at long-on! Pandya is giving those India fans still hanging in there something to cheer about"
"six more, that's beastly hitting! The number of the devil brings up Pandya's half-century from 32 balls. Need a few more of those to get India dreaming, though..."
pushed through outside off and this is tapped gently into the covers
"smashed through extra cover, Pandya continues to run amok! Opens up his body to hit in to out and he <i>absolutely creams</i> this"

"shortish, defended on off stump towards point"
"over the wicket, angled across and Jadeja plays down into the covers from the crease"
"mix up! Pandya's run out! He is furious and well he might be... Jadeja played into the covers, not sure if he called but Pandya was well down, his partner had begun to move down the pitch before turning back and the fielder had time to pick his end, throwing to Hasan to complete a simple run-out. Terrible from Jadeja, ball-watching and costing India their last hope"
"round the wicket, short ball and worked away off the body for a couple"
