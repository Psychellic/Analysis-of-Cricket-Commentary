"pushed through outside off, angling away from Munro further. He sizes it up and slog-sweeps it high and far over midwicket. Bam! What a start for Munro and NZ"
"shorter and outside off, Munro leans back and chops it away in the gap through the covers. Babar Azam chases hard and hunts the ball down"
"inducker from Imad, skidding into the pads, Phillips hangs back and clips a single away behind square on the leg side"
"tossed up slower on middle, sticks in the pitch, Munro checks his drive and instead chips it to Imad's left. In the air but safe in the end"
"short and sliding in at the stumps, a back-foot punch to long-on ensues"
"short and darted on off and middle, Munro sits back and shovels a single down to long-on to round out the over"
dug in short and outside off - Ashraf bowls a heavy ball - more a short-arm flap than a short-arm pull to short midwicket off the back foot
"banged in shorter and outside off, Munro loads up for a pull, does not middle it, spliced over wide mid-on for four"
"short and wide outside off, enough leeway for Munro to free his arms and utterly batter it through the covers. Fetch that"
"<strong>slower offcutter outside off</strong>, short as well, Munro does not pick the change-up. He swings early and collects a whole lot of fresh air"
"overpitched on the pads, picked away to deep square leg"
"short and angling into the body, Phillips hangs back and fends it off to the leg side"
"Munro backs away outside leg, exposes all three stumps, inside-edged away, hits the keeper's pad and rolls away"
"sliding through outside off, down the track and hacked to the leg side off the inside half"
"back of a length and spins in, a back-foot punch to mid-on is the answer from the batsman. Shadab (believe it or not) fumbles and misses a run-out chance. Phillips is interested in a single, he is halfway down the track, but Munro sends him back. He has enough time to undo his steps thanks to the fumble"
"full on the stumps, tapped to mid-on's right for one"
"tossed outside off, not much turn with the new ball for Hafeez, Munro clears his front leg and hoists it up and over mid-off, who's inside the circle"
back of a length and zips back in to cramp Munro for room. He chops an inside edge onto the pad as the ball trickles away to the off side
"back of a length and nipping away outside off, looks like the slower offcutter. Munro is early into a pull... and misses"
"<strong>Oh my WHAT.A.SHOT from Colin Munro</strong>. He races down the track, Ashraf sees the advancing batsman and digs it short and outside off. Munro goes airbone, this rises over his hip, he adjusts and launches it over mid-off for six. Outrageous hitting from Munro"
"<strong>Miscued to long-on, Hafeez runs in and drops it.</strong> Should've been taken. Slower offcutter, short and outside off, spliced away in the air and Munro gets away. The ball pops out when Hafeez's elbow hits the ground"
"short and outside off, 139ks, shovelled on the up to mid-on"
"slower one outside off, presses forward and scoops a drive only as far as cover"
"back of a length and outside off, swatted away like a fly to the left of Zaman, who throws himself to his left to stop this"
"short and nipping in on middle, punched up to mid-off"
"Munro steps out, manufactures his own length - half-volley - and belts the ball to mid-off. Hasan's front foot had strayed"
"full-toss on middle, sliced away to the covers, another front-foot no-ball from Hasan. Sarfraz walks up to his bowler and has a polite little word with him"
"really full and outside off, this free-hit is hit down along the ground to long-on"
"short and keeps coming into Munro, he backs away and jabs a single to the covers"
"full and just a shade outside off, dragged away to deep square leg off the inside half"
"slower ball outside off, Munro adjusts and carves it away square through the off side for four - hit to the right of cover and left of backward point"
"leg-stump yorker, Munro jams it out to long-on and keeps strike"
"very full and swings back in, inside-edged away through midwicket. Movement in the air for Afridi"
"on a length and outside off, Munro stays leg-side of the ball and scythes it away to backward point"
"short and outside off, Munro stays leg-side of the ball again, and flat-bats it away to mid-off's right. 50 partnership up for NZ, Phillips has only contributed 5 off 10. Remember, Sanath and little Kalu?"
"back of a length on the stumps, jabbed away. Phillips eats up another dot"
"Has Phillips nicked behind? Sarfraz is confident that he has his man. And up goes the finger. In-between length, angling away from over the stumps, Phillips wants to flick it - maybe towards midwicket - but inside-edges it behind to the keeper. Afridi hands Pakistan a much-needed breakthrough; although it's not the man they wanted"
"fuller on middle, Williamson hangs back and defends it back"
"back of a length and angling into catch the pad, but this is slipping down leg. Off the pad and rolls behind, Sarfraz gets to the ball. <strong>There's a mix-up between the wickets</strong>! Sarfraz isn't quick enough and NZ recover"
"back of a length and spins in a bit, punched with the break down to long-on"
Munro ventures outside leg and slaps one from the stumps to long-off
"looped up outside off, Williamson dances out and chips it with the break over midwicket. You don't need these muscular slogs in T20s, just need to clear the infield"
picked off the pads through midwicket
"Munro follows Phillips.<strong> Two in two overs for Pakistan</strong>. Munro ventures down the track, Hafeez shortens his length and keeps following the moving batsman. Munro swings and inside-edges it behind, he's too far down. Sarfraz collects the ball this time and whips the bails off. Munro gone for 44 off 28. It was good fun while it lasted"
"back of a length and turns away outside off, punched to sweeper"
"full on middle, presses forward and laces a single down to long-off"
"full and straight, whipped away behind square on the leg side"
"full and spins away outside off, eased to sweeper"
"on a length and outside off, pushed down to long-off"
"floated up on middle, blocked away to the leg side"
"pushed through outside off, this non-turner is blocked to Shadab's right off the back foot"
back of a length and spins away outside off to beat de Grandhomme
"skiddy short ball outside off, shovelled away to wide long-on. Williamson decides against the second"
"darted short and outside off, chopped back to the bowler off the inside half"
"drops a legbreak short and outside off, pulled to wide long-on for a couple of runs"
"Shadab holds this back, KW adjusts to the slow turn and jabs the ball back to the bowler"
"flat and outside off, slapped on the up to the covers"
"speared flat and short on off, jammed away past the left of Imad, he lets it through to long-off"
"short and turns away outside off, leans back and cuts firmly to sweeper cover"
"<strong>De Grandhomme holes out to long-on</strong>. Malik dives to his left and hangs on. De Grandhomme steps down the track, Imad holds this one back and gets it to turn away from the batsman. He aims to clear the boundary, instead skews it off the bottom to long-on. The spinners are squeezing NZ again"
chopped from the stumps towards sweeper cover
"pushed back to the bowler.<strong> From 50 for 0 in the Powerplay, NZ slump to 68 for 3 in 10</strong>"
"tosses it up on middle, Williamson gets forward to block"
reaches out and drives to cover as Shadab bowls slow and teases the batsman forward
a bit of turn as he holds the length back - only slightly though - which is why Williamson is forward with an open-faced block
"premeditates a sweep, taking a length ball from outside off and sending it to square leg"
"picks the gap in front of point as he lunges forward, reaching out to a wide delivery outside off"
whips the full delivery on middle to the left of deep midwicket
"steps out, but he still can't get under the ball and so Taylor has to settle for a flick, all along the ground, through midwicket. Good work from Imad, adjusting the length"
backs away and cuts the flatter delivery off the stumps to the sweeper
"another trip down the pitch, and this time Imad trumps Taylor by making the ball drift into the pads. The batsman tries another flick but makes no contact with the bat. Williamson pulls him through for the leg bye"
cuts to the sweeper
"shimmies down to drive the shortish delivery on the up to cover. Shadab is prowling there, moving quickly to his right"
"cuts the ball looking to take off stump. Top work from Babar at point, covering ground to his left and stopping the single. The captain will be pleased."
hammers the short and wide delivery to the sweeper
that's good work. He delays the cut shot just that little extra second so he can beat point
"<b>gorgeous strike</b>! Strides forward - getting to the pitch of the ball and launches it over extra cover, looking graceful as ever. This shot - extending the defence and picking that gap to the left of mid-off - has added so much to Williamson's T20 game"
"risky second run, and Taylor's already walking off the field. Great work from Pakistan again. At the start of this sequence, it seems like Williamson has done well with his flick, playing it softly enough to take the extra run. But Asif Ali sprints from the boundary, picks the ball up and flings a hard and flat throw right next to the stumps at the bowler's end. Shadab does the rest and Pakistan are now properly belting out their age-old UAE tunes. Squeeeeeeeeeze through spin."
pulls through square leg
slips down leg
"flighted on off stump, he defends"
pulls the shortish delivery on off stump through midwicket
cramps him with a back of a length delivery on middle. Anderson knocks it down by his feet
swings a full delivery out to long-on
backs away and chops the ball to the right of point
works the full one off middle stump to deep midwicket
"goes for the slog, seeing a length delivery on leg stump, but the lack of pace on the pitch doesn't allow him the benefit of any timing. Single to deep square leg"
"takes it from well outside off and scoops it over fine leg. And it's a very tall fine leg too. Shaheen Afridi is running back after the ball and stops it at the edge of the boundary. Williamson wants three, but Anderson says no"
steers a wide yorker down to third man
"another yorker, this one on middle, Anderson digs it out"
"launches it to the midwicket boundary! Anderson spots the slower ball, sets up a strong base, clearing that front leg, and pulls it for all he's worth. <b>Second boundary in the last 10 overs</b>"
swings all around a yorker on off stump and hears an uncomfortable crunch as the ball passes his back leg and goes through to the keeper.
"length ball, and it's invitation for Anderson to go for the slog again. Gets just enough bat on it to split the field between square leg and midwicket"
splendid batting! It's all in the placement here and he works so hard to get it just right. Makes a little room on leg stump. Waits for the tossed up delivery to arrive - which is a big deal on slow pitches - and carves it to the cover boundary
pulls the short ball out to deep midwicket
"tosses it up on leg stump, Anderson thumps it back at the legspinner"
steps out of his crease to slug the tossed up delivery on off stump out to long-on
"there's more evidence of how hard it is to hit out against a short of a length delivery. Williamson spots the length. He waits too. But when he finally pulls, he still gets an inside edge to long-on"
knocks the shortish delivery on leg stump to long-off
"nails the yorker on middle, Anderson can only squeeze it out to long-on"
backs away and gets a shortish slower ball to deal with. Williamson slaps it to point for a single
"<b>swings and misses</b> and that's only because of the change of pace. Anderson gets the length he wants and he goes for the slog, ever so eagerly, but Hasan trumps him with the offcutter"
"<b>smaaaaaaash</b>! The yorker goes wrong. Anderson clears the front leg, picks up the low full toss and launches it over long-on. Absolute power"
"and again! Brute force from Anderson as he picks up the slower ball this time, standing tall against it and pulling it to the midwicket fence"
"finds a way! He finds a way to score off even a leg-stump, pin-point yorker! Four to fine leg. Boy, oh boy! Anderson, where have you been all this time!?"
"oooh, he's clipped a leg-stump half-volley straight to deep backward square leg. The intention is to get a couple of runs, but Williamson ends up timing the ball too well. Oh the irony. He's had to struggle to connect with the ball all innings, but persevered ever so well until now, only to get out to a shot he ends up hitting better than he even wanted to"
"looks for the big hit, down the ground, but the full length slower ball beats him"
full and straight. Anderson can't get any leverage on it and so has to settle for a single to long-on
"low full tos,s which he taps back to short cover. Run-out chance there with Anderson backing up at the non-strikers'. Shadab misses his mark by just a tiny bit"
"another <b>sensational yorker</b>, on the base of middle stump, and Seifert, who is a big-hitter, isn't able to do much about it."
"wraps things up with a yorker - and if only for variation, this is on off stump. Seifert digs it out to short cover and Anderson has a <b>run-out scare</B> again. Ooof, Shadab is electric in the infield"
swings the yorker on off stump down to long-on
carves a low full toss to the cover boundary. Hasan - strangely - is missing the blockhole and he's being punished for it. Mercilessly punished
"scoops the slower ball over square leg. He was hoping for another quick delivery, somewhere near the blockhole that he could get under, but Hasan spots the batsman trying to scoop and changes it up so well"
"<b>maaaaaasive</b>! Picks the offcutter, clears the front leg, swings violently and though it hits only the bottom of the bat, Anderson has so much power that it sails away"
"full on leg stump, whips it away behind square leg"
"heaves the full delivery on middle out to the left of long-on for a couple. Needs a dive from Seifert and he puts it in. Full length, keeping the bat from bouncing. Good effort from the NZ wicketkeeper"
"mis-hit, but look at it sail! Seifert premeditates the scoop again. But this time, with Afridi bowling at full pace, the ball ending up a full toss on middle stump as well, the batsman profits with his invention"
"taken at long-on! Looks a million bucks with the freaky shots but when he has to hit down the ground, he doesn't get enough power. Slower ball does Seifert in as he makes contact with only the toe-end and is caught at long-on"
steps out but the heat-seeking yorker on middle has too much on it for Anderson to do much about. Single to long-off
"slower ball, outside off, Southee swings, he misses, Anderson tries to pinch the bye, but Sarfraz relays the throw to the bowler and Afridi hits the stumps at his own end with Southee well short. This was any way a ploy to get Anderson back on strike and that's been accomplished"
"full on leg stump, Anderson mis-hits it to deep square leg. Ooooh, he's been pasting those over the ropes. But here, he misses out"
slogs the length ball to deep square leg for a couple
"short and sliding across off, Zaman marks his return with a four. He skips back and cracks it away behind point"
"flat and pushed through outside off again, Zaman latches onto it again, sends it behind point for back-to-back fours"
"Zaman uses his feet, sort of yorks himself, and squeezes a single"
"tossed on middle stump, pushed past the bowler, straight of KW at mid-on"
"sliding through outside off, Zaman reaches out for the ball and jams it to the covers"
"on a length and angling in on middle, Azam dances out and plays it back to Patel"
"good length, catches the pad, and rolls away behind square on the leg side"
"back of a length and largely holds its line outside off, Azam throws his bat at the ball and inside-edges a four past the left of the diving NZ keeper"
shuffles across off and picks off a single to square leg does Azam
"short and keeps rising on Zaman, he looks to upper-cut the ball over short third man. No dice"
"back of a length and angling away outside off., Naaah, can't offer so much room to Zaman. He stays leg-side of the ball and cracks it between point and covers"
"<strong>slower offcutter </strong>outside off, Zaman does not read the pace variation, tips it to the off side and hares across for one"
"overpitched and outside off, drilled through the line to cover"
"hip-high short ball on middle,<strong> Zaman launches it into the top tier.</strong> He has Sarfraz clapping in the dug out. He swivels on the back foot and dispatches it into he oblivion. Soars up and over midwicket"
"full at the stumps, driven to mid-on for one"
"back of a length and angling in towards the hops, worked away square of short fine leg by Azam. Sodhi chases and jams his left knee into the turf. He seems okay, though"
"short on the hips, a whirl of those wrists sends the ball to deep square leg"
"<strong>leg-stump yorker</strong>, 140ks, Zaman, having jumped outside leg, somehow digs it out"
"slower, short ball, on middle, swatted off the back foot to deep midwicket"
"back of a length and on a fourth-stump line, Azam punches on the up to cover"
"slower short ball outside off, 129ks, Azam is waaaaay too early into his pull and does not make contact.... or may have under-edged it in front of the keeper. Yes, Ultra Edge detects a spike. The keeper should have dived forward and attacked the ball. This'll go down as a missed chance. Replays suggest it was the offcutter from Southee"
"back of a length and angling into off, Azam shuffles across and clips it with the angle to mid-on"
"shortish and outside off, carved to the covers"
"slower cutter outside off, chopped to short third man for one"
"on a length and outside off, <strong>nearly 150ks</strong>, Azam uses the pace of Mile to his advantage and clatters it on the up. Through the covers"
"back of a length and too straight, flicked away to deep backward square leg"
"Zaman backs away outside off, this is the <strong>slower one from the back of the hand</strong>, this legcutter is jabbed through the covers"
"<b>Kane Williamson, you beauty</b>! He throws himself to his left from mid-off and completes a one-hander, inches from the ground. What a play. Milne fires it very full on middle, 147ks, Zaman backs away outside leg, does not get underneath the length. The bat twists in his hands as he scoops a low catch. That it was a catch was down to Williamson's athletic intervention at mid-off. The NZ skip barely celebrates Cool cat. Zaman is stunned"
"leg-stump half-volley, Asif flicks it away to deep square leg"
"back of a length and skidding in at off, chopped behind to the diving keeper"
"short one outside off, sits up to be smacked. Azam obliges and nails it through the covers off the back foot. And welcome, de Grandhomme"
nudged off the pads wide of short fine
"slower ball, nurdled to Patel at short fine leg again. Pakistan steal another single from right under his nose"
"full and nipping in to have the batsman falling over the flick, but heading down leg"
"full and straight, knocked down to long-on"
"slower offcutter, clipped to square leg. <b>Not even a hair to separate both the sides at the end of the Powerplay. 50 for 1</b>"

"darted down leg, left alone, wide"
"short and fizzes through outside off, rocks back and chops the ball through the covers"
"short and attacking the stumps, forced down to long-on off the back foot"
"slid through on middle, pushed to cover"
punched down to long-on
"tip and run to the covers, KW swoops down the ball but the throw is wild - over the keeper's head"
"slower cutter finishes on the pads, knocked fine of Patel at short fine leg for one"
"legroller on off, punched to midwicket"
"back of a length and floated up at off stump, punched down to long-on for a single"
flicked off the pads to deep square leg
"another cutter, but the length is short, allowing Ali to camp back and secure a single down to long-on"
"slower offcutter, just a shade outside off, played back to the bowler"
"dragged down on middle, Ali has ample time to skip back and club a pull over midwicket"
"back of a length and breaks away outside off, cracked to sweeper cover off the back foot"
"fires it short on leg stump, Azam ventures deep in the crease and pulls the ball between deep midwicket and wide long-on"

"Ali sizes up another short legbreak that spins away outside off, this is punched with the break to sweeper cover"
"shortish and outside off, a jabbing punch to long-on ensues"
"slower short ball on middle, drags a pull to deep square leg off the back foot"
"slower short ball outside off, heaved away to deep square leg. Colin is giving the batsmen no pace to work with"
"slower short cutter outside off, lashed away to deep backward point of the back foot"
"back of a length on the stumps, tapped away to the left of Taylor at short midwicket"
"on a length and outside off, Ali surges down the track and drills in the ball away to long-on"
"<b>dropped</b> at long-on by de Grandhomme! All the silliness in the world is stuck in this three second play. Sodhi bowls short. Asif top-edges the pull. And de Grandhomme slips as he tries to get under the ball, and that moment where he loses his balance, does him in"
"<b>run-out chance</B> but Babar just about makes it. Mistimes the drive to cover and then comes a misunderstsanding between the two batsmen. Eventually, all is well for Pakistan"
"steps out but Sodhi pulls his length back, keeps his line straight and ensures Babar can only knock it back down the pitch"
keeps the front leg away as he slices the good length ball on middle to cover
too wide outside off.
leans forward and thumps it to the cover boundary. This is splendid batting from Babar. He's looking so comfortable on this slow pitch. He knows the target in front of him. He knows New Zealand's spinners will give him chances to hit out. And all that calm is making his game all the better
waits on the shot and that extra second helps him carve the shortish delivery well behind point
"whips it over to long-on, MS Dhoni helicopter style"
slips down leg
"flicks off the pad and is set to run away to the fine leg boundary, but Seifert dives to his left and stops it"
"full on middle, knocks it down to long-on"
"backs away, the bowler follows him, and finally Asif flicks the ball off his pads to long leg"
"walks down the pitch, de Grandhomme responds with a slower ball on middle, but he still manages to dab it to third man. Unruffled."
steers the length ball on off stump to the sweeper
"slower ball - it's the leg cutter - on middle and leg, Babar tries to sweep it away but he's beaten"
"this is at top pace, which Babar pulls to deep midwicket"
picks the change of pace and heaves it over midwicket. Just too full from Southee. Almost a half-volley and Asif Ali just swings free
"huge appeal for lbw, but the umpire shakes his head. Asif gets struck somewhere near his thigh as he goes for a pull and is beaten for pace. Babar, awake to an opportunity, pinches a leg bye"
backs away - but he's done in by Southee's cleverness. He takes all the pace off and keeps the ball wide of off stump and that leaves Babar too far away from the ball to make any connection
"taken at mid-off! It's the change of pace again, with Babar looking to hit drive on the up and clear the infield. Not enough on the ball to take it that far though. New Zealand have a sniff. Just a tiny sniff"
nudges the length ball to short midwicket
turns the fuller delivery from outside off to midwicket
"full on off stump, he makes room and taps it into the covers"
drives to short cover. An over full of slower balls from Munro. Accurate slower balls too
follows him as he makes room outside leg. Hafeez hits along the ground to long-off
drives to long-on
"lovely bowling. He keeps the length short - which is good on a slow pitch because the ball doesn't come on - and more importantly the line is on middle. With no room, Asif's cut shot only goes to point"
slugs the full delivery on leg stump down to long-on. Nearly took out his partner though
goes for the reverse sweep and only just manages to squeeze the ball past the keeper  Think it takes a deflection off Hafeez's glove
"nicely tossed up outside off, Asif lets it go, looking for a wide. No luck"
"doesn't carry to the sweeper! The pressure of an ever rising required rate is showing on Asif as he charges out of his crease. Sodhi sees the danger and slows it right down, keeping it wide, making sure the batsman has to reach out to make any sort of contact."
taps the shortish delivery out to deep point
swings the back of a length ball on off stump to deep square leg
"slogs a length ball out to deep midwicket. 'Catch,' they cry, but it doesn't carry to Phillips"
slogs the fuller delivery on middle to long-on
"cuts the back of a length delivery, juuuuust outside off, to deep point"
"steps out and launches the length ball over wide long-on. Brave batting from Asif. he knows he has the power. He also knows Munro is simply bowling length in line with the stumps. So he steps out of his crease, gaining momentum as he goes and that helps him big time"
"<b>lbw to a full toss from round the stumps</b>! The change of angle is fair, an effort to cramp the right-hander, which is fair, but the execution just goes for a toss. Even so, Asif, set up to pull the ball, misses completely and gets hit on the back leg right in front of middle stump. That's ridiculous cricket from all parties involved"
"superb shot! There's just a hint of room on offer and Hafeez takes full toll. Gets down on one knee and slog sweeps it to oblivion. Which, for specificity, is at deep midwicket"
cuts to the sweeper
"and another! Hafeez is doing it in style. Even though he isn't to the pitch of the ball, he fancies it and tonks it well over the head of long-on"
"<b>falls short of Phillips</b>, diving forward at deep midwicket. Oooh, Hafeez is in a proper mood, although how else are you supposed to treat a short ball on leg stump?"
a bit of turn as Malik tries to cut the short ball and it darts so far away from him that he only just meets it with the bottom of the bat
steers the shortish delivery through to the sweeper
"premeditates the reverse sweep, but a full ball on off stump only ends up at point"
<B>inside edge</b> and it nearly goes onto the stumps. A rare quick delivery from Munro. And the new batsman isn't quite ready for it
gets under the length ball (seems like a knuckle ball too) and clears long-on by a distance. Splendid hitting from Malik
knocks a back of a length ball to long-on
"full on off stump, drives it back at the bowler"
steps out and taps the shortish delivery to long-off
"slow, wide yorker - doesn't quite hit the mark - which allows Hafeez to squeeze a single to cover. Direct hit from Williamson at the striker's end, but Malik is home"
"keeps the ball wide of the batsman shuffling across his stumps, but he's penalised for it by umpire Raza. Went just past the guide line"
looks for that wide-line yorker again but it doesn't quite pan out. Only Inches outside the guide line.
"yorker outside off, Malik bunts it down to long-on"
drills the full and wide delivery to the sweeper cover
smashes a slower ball to long-off
"slower ball outside off, Hafeez taps it to cover. But if he had let it go, this would have been a wide too"
"shapes to scoop, but the ball is too full and so he gets back upright and shovels it to deep midwicket"
"near-yorker on middle, he drills it to Southee at mid-off, they go for the run, and a <b>direct hit would have had Hafeez</b>"
"taken at deep midwicket! Ooof, and it comes off a full toss too! Malik looks to end the game in one shot, but this is a big ground and he can't clear it."
"low full toss on middle Hafeez taps it to long-on and they pinch a second run as well. Poor throw from the deep. Munro, it looks like. <b>Run-out chance missed again</b>"
"launches it over cover and Pakistan win the game and the series! Half-volley sent soaring away by Hafeez, who has played a lovely little innings here"
