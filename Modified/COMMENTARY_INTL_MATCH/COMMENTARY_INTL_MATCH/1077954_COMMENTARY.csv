"gets this to hold its line from length on off stump, defended off the backfoot"
"once again super risky from Brathwaite. Far too across again as he negotiates this incoming length ball to the leg side. Right now, keeping it down while looking to work leg side seems an arduous task for him. The struggle is on"
"excellent from Amir. Bangs one in short on middle, Brathwaite look to get on top of the bounce to fend but is rapped on the glove. Rolls to third slip."
"confident push down the ground past the bowler. No mid-off, so they'll get two. Got forward, covered the swing this time and then played it late"
"floats a full delivery across, left alone"

"lunges forward, allows the ball to come on and then defends to point"
"the dropped chance doesn't cost them. Amir has struck with a beauty. Boy, he's worked him over or what. Upright seam, gets this to shape back in just a touch and then the ball nips away off the seam from length on off to take the outside edge, Sarfraz accepts it gleefully. Brathwaite never looked comfortable."
"slides one onto the pads, worked wide of mid-on to get off the mark"
"angles a length ball across the left-hander, left alone"
in the slot to drive but Hetmyer resists temptation. Wobbly seam but it angled in just a touch from outside off
"this time, Hetmyer falls to the trap. Poor, very poor. Again the one that goes across, the length is full and there for the drive. He looks to play away from the body, throws his bat at that and gets a thick edge to Azhar who takes an excellent catch at third slip. The ball was still on its way up when he collected it sideways. Familiar start for West Indies."
"floats a full-length delivery outside off, left alone this time"
"misdirected. Full and sliding down leg, Hope falls over on the flick but the ball deflects off the pad and beats Sarfraz to the fine leg boundary."

starts off with a full toss and gets away with it as Hope smashes it straight to deep cover

"just short of a good length and outside off, steps back and punches the ball to point"
"beautiful legbreak. <strong>Turn, bounce, and fizz.</strong> Just too hot for Hope. Yasir tosses it up, gets it angle into the right-hander, then break away. Hope does not really move his feet. He has a lousy prod at it. He had to play at it because it started on middle. Yasir shaves the outside edge. The keeper judges the bounce well and snaffles it"

"back of length on off, hops across and shows the full face of the bat to defend"
"the ball tails back in late to hit him on the back foot. The angle - bowled full from wide of the crease - may have caused the doubt in the umpire's mind. Powell looked to flick but was beaten for pace and was late to come down to the stroke. At the point of impact, the ball didn't have a long way to travel. Clearly no inside edge and hawk-eye shows that would have crashed into leg stump. Amir surprised him with the length and Pakistan have a strike against a run of play."

firmly behind the line of that away-going length ball in defence
"<b> the change of bowling works immediately. </b> Younis has taken a superb catch at second slip. Slants this length delivery across Vishaul, who pokes at the delivery with an angled bat. The ball was dying on Younis, but he stayed low and got his hands properly underneath the delivery to make a potentially tough catch look easy."
<b> uppish but safe. </b> Dowrich caught on the crease as he plays forward to a delivery that came back in late. Cover was in business for a while
hit high on the left pad but the angle would've taken it down leg. Dowrich was squared up by the length as well.
"short, and punished. Outside leg, he uses the depth of the crease to flat-bat this into the deep midwicket boundary. Half-century earns applause from his mates. Can he kick on to make a century?"
driven with the spin to mid-off.

"Amir ventures wide of the crease and brings this back into the right-hander, tucked away to the right of midwicket, to the right of the square leg umpire. The fielder runs across and gamely chases the ball. Yasir was the fielder, I think. Dowrich and Chase go for the second. Yasir's throw is flat and accurate, Sarfraz simply lets it to clatter into the furniture. But the <strong>bails refuse to budge</strong>. Sarfraz and Yasir are bemused"

"<strong>Maiden Test wicket for Shadab</strong>. He pumps his fist and lets out a big roar. The feline Younis claims another sharp, low catch. This was the perfectly pitched legbreak, spins away outside off, and drags Dowrich forward. He prods with an angled bat, does not cover the line, and nicks it to slip.

"lovely length, pitching it right up there, and it appears he can move the ball both ways. This one comes into Holder who blocks it with a straight bat"
"he's got him! Fantastic start for Pakistan. Abbas spreads his arms wide and runs into his team-mates to celebrate after bowling a ball no batsman would want to face in the first over of a day. Hits a good length, seams in off the pitch and has Holder in two minds. Should I play, should I leave, should I... but before he could finish that thought, his inside edge is taken and Sarfraz takes a good catch to his left"
"beautiful control and Bishoo gives it the respect it deserves, leaving a good length ball in the corridor outside off"
forces him to put bat to ball by bowling fuller. Always a good idea against No. 9 batsmen.  Bishoo inches forward to block to short cover
"teaser again, just outside off, and Bishoo almost fell into the trap. Three slips are waiting for the outside edge, and they almost had it as the batsman pokes away from his body"
"back of a length and outside off, offers no shot"
avoids a full delivery quite wide outside off
"the centurion's gone! Pakistan couldn't have hoped for a better first two overs today. For so long Chase has defied them. Bested them. But now, having to restart his innings, against the new ball, and a special bowler, he offers a tentative prod and the outside edge is taken. It flies low to second slip and Younis Khan has already shown his reflexes are better than ever."
"good length ball on top of off stump, Joseph, the new batsman, punches to cover"
"beats him with the angle. A back of a length ball pitches on middle stump, forces Joseph to play, and dances past the outside edge"
"another delivery that zips past the bat. Joseph, though, is doing well not to push at these deliveries. He is accounting for the one that comes back in but by making sure he doesn't chase them, he wouldn't be nicked off"
"back of a length and outside off at 124 kph, Bishoo avoids it"
"once the bowler shortens his length, the angle across the left-hander makes him think he has the width to cut. Bishoo tries and fails. The slips grumble."
"again, a feeble shot. This is basically a half-volley outside off, but Bishoo is reluctant to come forward. He just thrusts his hands and is lucky not to nick off."
moves around the wicket for a full delivery on off stump. It is pushed to mid-off
"looks for the cut, but again, he has little chance of connecting when he doesn't move his feet. It looks like it's only a matter of time for Bishoo"
poor ball. The batsman is under so much pressure and he is given the one ball he would love. Short and on the pads. Bishoo flicks through midwicket to give West Indies their first runs of the morning
"<b>falls short of first slip</b>. Amir does everything right - hitting back of a length to keep Bishoo rooted to the crease. The line is on off stump, so he has to play it. Then he makes the ball straighten to take the outside edge. But the ball dies before it reaches Shafiq"
"slides into the pads, looking for the magic awayswinger, Bishoo is able to flick it away behind square leg"
sweetly struck. This time Bishoo stands up tall against a shortish delivery outside off and authoritatively punches it through cover
"the runs won't be a balm for the pain. Bishoo is struck on the arm guard by a bouncer. He is in no position to handle the ball. Instincts tell him to duck his head, but his hands are still high, which end up helping West Indies as the ball - aimed at middle and leg - deflects over the keeper"
"good length ball looking for the top of off, keeps it out"
firm backfoot defence to end the over as Amir continues targeting the stumps
"good length ball on middle and leg, defends"
"his front pad is right in line with this full delivery on middle and leg, but the bat comes down quickly enough to save himself from an lbw"
"again, looking for the lbw with a full, inswinger. Joseph brings a straight bat to deny Pakistan"
"not a bad ploy, the short ball. Joseph looks to pull it from way outside off, and for all the fortune it brings he might as well have done better ramping it over the slips."
"shortish on off stump, blocks"
"full on off stump, with a touch of swing into the right-hander. Joseph comes out with an on drive but gets an inside edge through midwicket instead"
"the outside edge squirts through the gap between the slips and the gully. It might have gone to the boundary and brought up West Indies' 300, but the bowler should get points for this. Making the ball straighten, making the batsman play, and bringing out a false shot"
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
"smacks it to point, and the fact that he has hit it so hard allows him to get a couple with the fielder fumbling."
looks for the blockhole but Bishoo is able to keep this out too. Him being keen to stay on the back foot is helping him now - as opposed to when he was brand new - because he has got his eye in a little better.
"slower short ball outside off, Bishoo guides it to point"
blocks a shortish delivery outside off to cover. Bishoo seems comfortable off that length. Over to Amir to bowl fuller

"back of a length and outside off, defends"
"goes for a bouncer on middle and leg, Joseph looks for the hook, but he is beaten for pace"

"back of a length on off stump, pushes to short cover"
"full on middle and leg, demanding Bishoo step off his back foot where he is most comfortable. Push to mid-on"
"just short of a good length on off stump, Bishoo covers the line well"

"shortish and outside off, cuts to deep third man"
"there's a gap at cover, and he's able to pick it, playing an aerial drive. That's what Pakistan want. That's why Amir bowled it full and wide and has two slips waiting"
tempts him with a full and wide delivery - having moved around the stumps - Joseph looks for the big booming cover drive and connects with nothing
"straight to mid-on! Abbas, you beauty! Just seconds before this ball, he was asked to go out of the attack. But he wanted to bowl one more and now he shows us why. Such a tame wicket, though, as Bishoo presses forward to a full delivery and bunts it to Yasir Shah"
defends the good length ball on off stump
"back of a length on off stump, knocks it down"
"through the bowler before he can get down. Abbas looks back, and finds mid-on and mid-off are on the ball. Shannon's power goes to waste even though he did nail a good length ball with a meaty drive"
"shortish and outside off, ignores it"
"full and tailing down leg, Joseph looks to flick but the swing is too much for him. For that matter, it's too much for the lbw appeal as well"
good length ball on off stump - turning just enough - Joseph covers it
hangs back against a shortish delivery outside off and cuts to point
"beautiful bowling. This leggie has everything it needs to trouble the batsman. It's tossed up, drifting in at first and then turning away. Even nudges the batsman back in his crease. Joseph manages to block it though"
"shortish delivery, nudged away"
"oh ho ho, a full toss sneaks under the bat and topples leg stump. Who needs the perfect legbreak? Yasir and MIsbah high-five each other, grinning away as the West Indies innings comes to a close with the No. 10 batsman slogging at a loopy delivery, missing it altogether, getting hit on the pad and then looking back to see his stumps broken"
"136kph, back of a length and outside off, the batsman shoulders arms"
"delivers the early yorker, but Azhar won't be fooled. Even if the ball is curling in through the air and nearly throws him off his feet"
"shortish and outside off, with a little curl away, Azhar ignores it"
"back of a length and outside off, no shot necessary. The umps miss a massive no-ball."
"<b>ripper</b>. He is express pace, but his control is what sets Gabriel apart. Here he pitches on a good length, in line with off stump, making Azhar play. But the ball seams away off the pitch and nearly takes the outside edge"
"full and outside off, drives serenely through cover"
"starts off with a back of length delivery that nips away from just outside off, Shehzad shoulders arms"
"draws him forward with the length but this is around the sixth stump, and so Shehzad leaves"
"short of length and angling away from well outside off, watched through to the wicketkeeper"

"once again drivable length, touch too full. Shehzad doesn't fall for it and lets it go"

"drifting into the pads, worked past the infield towards midwicket. Easy pickings"
"sharp turn from length outside off, Azhar leaves. Did well to cover his stumps by walking across. Ensuring it didn't come back enough to hit the stumps"
climbs onto him but Azhar does well to use the depth of the crease to get on top of the bounce and bunt it back down the pitch
worked across the line to mid-on
"uppish but into the gap. Fires this full, Azhar wrists this into the gap at midwicket"
"angles a full ball on off from wide of the crease, driven to mid-off"
gets on top of the bounce and bunts the short of length delivery on middle
whips an incoming length ball to midwicket

"pitched up outside off, cover is out so the drive is on, but Shehzad is happy to leave"
check-drives a full delivery to mid-off
"starts off with a length ball on middle and leg, worked to deep square leg. Not the kind of delivery you want to be bowling with a packed cordon"
"angles a full delivery on off from wide of the crease, defended back down the pitch"
super delivery. Probing away around the off stump channel. Shehzad with a leave but would've been worried for a split-second. <b> Very close to the off stump </b>
hops back and across to wrist the incoming length ball to short midwicket
gets a good stride in to bunt the full ball to short cover
"too straight and down leg, tickled to fine leg. <b>First run in 29 deliveries for Shehzad </b>"
"full on off stump, the perfect ball for the drive and Shehzad produces it. Timed well, but placed straight to mid-off"
"back of a length and outside off, offers no shot."
"misses out there. Couldn't ask for more than this for a loose delivery - short and wide. Shehzad goes for the cut, but the ball sneaks below his bat"
"allows a full delivery to come to him so that he can clip it off his toes to mid-on. He had nearly spooned a catch playing this very stroke, but this time, he plays late and closer to the body"
good length ball on off stump at 131 kph - is that speed a sign of Gabriel being less than 100%? Shehzad defends
<b>almost plays on</b> as he thinks just because a delivery is short of a length it can be cut. Gabriel's angle brings it a lot closer to him and foils the stroke
"beautiful bowling - so good that he has floored Azhar. Digs in a bouncer and makes sure it follows the right-hander. The batsman does well too, dropping his wrists and swaying his head out of the line"
"good batting. You leave the difficult bouncers, but when they don't rise up, you have to pull them away. Otherwise fast bowlers will keep aiming for your head all day"
"lovely carry through to the wicketkeeper, and Joseph can watch it all the way through because his line was outside off and so did not tempt Azhar to play"
"gets up off his toes and clips a shortish, 133 kph delivery rising above his hips through to deep square leg"
"good length ball on off stump, Shehzad covers it well"
"meets a fulll, inswinging delivery with the straight bat. No run to mid-off"
"leans into an off drive, but is careful not to overhit the ball. Finds mid-off"
"the pace on the ball forces Azhar to take his bottom hand off the bat. Must have been jarring, getting a chunk of leather thud into the high part of his bat at 86 mph"
"beautiful cricket - first from Azhar, standing up tall against a short delivery that wasn't all that wide and crunching it to short cover's right. Then over to Chase, who dives to his left and saves a certain boundary. That shot was so well hit"
"shortish delivery on middle and leg, clips it through to long leg"
gets behind a back of a length delivery on off stump
"picks the short ball early and ducks under it. Gets so low that the ball - which didn't bounce as much as Gabriel expected - still lobs the batsman. Also, no-ball. By about a foot"
"shortish and outside off, slices it behind point, and Gabriel has overstepped again. Well over the line again."

works it away off his pads through square leg
"back of a length and outside off, Shehzad doesn't care for it"
"shortish, but not quite wide enough to have a free range of movement with the arms, which is necessary for the pull. Shehzhad tries the shot without it and inside edges to midwicket"
"fuller delivery on off stump, defends"
"fuller delivery outside off, Shehzad watches it sail past"
"tries to enjoy the benefits an overpitched delivery offers by driving it straight past the bowler, but mid-on in close enough on hand"
smashes a short and wide delivery to cover. West Indies only concentrating on keeping the runs down.
punches a shortish delivery outside off stump to short cover
"connects with a cover drive a touch too early, and so checks his shot. The result: there is no follow through which keeps the ball down and sends it to the fielder"
"full and wide outside off, Azhar ignores it"
"<b>risky, very risky</B> but it still brings up the fifty for Pakistan. Azhar thinks he has some runs on offer as he sees a full and wide delivery. Throws his bat at it, gets a thick outside edge that flies through the gap between the lone slip and a lone gully"
"full on off stump, keeps it out"
lets the short of a good length delivery come to him before putting it down
"full and shaping into the right-hander, but it is not moving enough to threaten the off stump, so Shehzad leaves"
works a shortish delivery from off stump to midwicket. He consciously shuffles across to make this shot happen - which shows he is at least looking for runs
"full and outside off, drives straight to mid-off. These deliveries though should be put away. This was a half-volley allowing the batsman ample room to free the arms"
"full and curling into the base of middle stump, Shehzad does well to present a straight bat"
"full on off stump, drives it back to the bowler"
has no intention to reach out to good length balls outside off
"wise leave, and finally Gabriel hits the right length - not a half-volley, not short either, just in between, where the batsman is unsure of driving or punching. Azhar, though, read the danger and shouldered arms"
goes wide of the crease for a good length ball outside off - about a stump too wide to tempt Azhar
allows wide yorker to wander aimlessly past
"back of a length and outside off. Azhar bounces on his feet as he evades it. And once more, Gabriel's front foot strays"
no interest in nicking off to those good length deliveries outside the off stump
shoves his bat high into the sky again as the ball wobbles past the off stump
"belts out an appeal for lbw, but Holder's back of a length delivery hits Shehzhad on the thigh, after coming off the inside edge. Not even the slightest interest from umpire Oxenford"
covers the line of a length ball on off stump
blocks a shortish delivery on middle.
"looks to drive on the up, but he has no timing on the shot. Good length ball on off stump ends up at mid-off"
"tries to nudge a shortish delivery angling into him to the leg side, but he picks out midwicket. Had he waited a bit more, square leg was completely vacant"
"sets up for a pull, but the short ball outside off gets higher and higher and he decides it's best to avoid it"
"into the pads and Azhar is able to tickle the ball through the wide open leg side field. There is no midwicket, no square leg and mid-on has to race across, two-thirds to the boundary"
"fuller delivery outside off, defends"
wide half-volley and Shehzad finally plays an aggressive stroke. Pierces the gap at cover for a couple of runs
good carry through to the keeper as he hits the deck outside off. Shehzad ignores it
"pins him in front of middle! This is a searing delivery - at 93 mph - and it zips in at the batsman, goes through Shehzad's lazy drive on the up and hits him on the back leg. <b>This is plumb</b>, but Shehzad goes for a review, and would you believe it, <b>Gabriel has no-balled</b>! Tactical DRS, eh? Well done, Pakistan"
"full toss outside off, and it is met with the gentlest of defensive blocks"
"full on off stump, Shehzad clips to mid-on"
gets across to a shortish delivery on off stump and turns it to the right of short midwicket
"lovely bowling. Hits the deck just outside off, makes Azhar think about playing, and then leaves him looking sheepish as the ball straightens past the outside edge"
gets in line with a shortish delivery on off stump and pushes it to mid-on
"teaser outside off, but Azhar refuses to drive or play any kind of shot. Switch hit? Nope. Reverse sweep? No thanks, leave me along."
"<b>keeps low!</b>. The ball was originally shortish - so much that Azhar was jumping back in his crease to block, which makes it all the more difficult for him to get low enough to block. If that had only been straight..."
"back of a length and outside off, no shot needed"
"floats a full length delivery around the fifth stump, not much deviation in, Shehzad leaves"

"slants a full delivery on the pads, picked into the gap at midwicket"

"slower and fuller on off stump, skews off the outer half of the bat to point"

"fuller and quicker through the air on middle, leans forward and dabs it back down the pitch"
"slow turn from off stump, goes back and across, defended gently"
lunges forward and taps it wide of short cover. Miscommunication. Azhar was halfway down the pitch when he was sent back.
"<b> beauty! Drew him forward with the length. </b> This drifted in, pitched on middle and spun past the face of the bat. Close"

"steps out, the bowler sees that and fires it full and wide, Shehzad is forced to stretch a long way to his right and keep that out"
steps out and wrists a delightful on-drive. The ball was no more than a couple of inches to Bishoo's right but it was hit really hard. Super timing
"<b> Chase perhaps lost it. Didn't even attempt a return catch. </b> Azhar closes the bat face, gets a leading edge. On the bounce to the bowler off the back of the bat"

"fires this on middle, bit of spin away, Azhar cuts to point. Didn't have the room to play the full-blooded stroke"
"too full outside leg, Azhar gets to the pitch and paddles this behind the keeper. Rolled his wrists over the ball to keep it down and ensure he didn't get a top-edge. They're getting a move on now"

whips a shortish delivery outside leg to square leg
"spins away from middle, left alone"
"what was Shehzad trying to do? He'll do well to answer that to his coaches in the dressing room. Or wait. He can actually do that later, because Chase has overstepped. He sees Shehzad stepping out and fires the full ball down leg cleverly, Shehzad can't reach and the keeper takes a couple of seconds to gather his composure and then break the bails. Shehzad was so far down that it could have qualified as a run-out. <b> What a time to bowl your first no-ball in Test cricket.</b> Shehzad can walk blindfolded on a freeway and not get runover"
"fires a length ball on middle and leg, kicks it away off the pad"
"tossed up on middle, turned to mid-on"
off the pad? Gabriel with a comical dive at short fine. Does a Sydney Harbour Bridge over the ball and then escorts it to the boundary. Somehow manages to pull it back in. <b> Could have slipped over the ball and turned his ankle! </b. What is happening?

"shuffles across to a good length ball turning away from him, and watching it do so"
"<b>oh so close</b>. Shehzad makes a move down the track and mishits the cover drive. It's aerial, and it demands Jason Holder at short cover to move quickly to his right. The captain puts out his right hand, but it doesn't stick"
"turning away outside off, so very slowly, Shehzad doesn't bother with it"
"that's better. He charges out of the crease, full of purpose, and turns a flighted delivery into a full toss. Then it's all a matter of picking his spot. Shehzad goes over wide mid-on"

gets a good length ball to straighten but Azhar is able to cover the line and play late enough that there is no real danger
"excellent work with the wrists as he gets inside the line of a shortish delivery and lifts it over the short leg fielder. Difficult shot to pull off considering the lack of room, and the ball coming up higher than Azhar would ideally have wanted"

turns a shortish delivery - even it if seems to keep low a tad - behind square leg
tosses it up on leg stump - bowling around the wicket - Azhar blunts it

"back over the wicket to Shehzad, who takes a stride forward and blocks outside off"
"check out the wrapping on this one. Bishoo hand delivers another gift to the batsman, a juicy full toss - and who else could it be today but Shehzad, who belts it over cow corner. Pakistan have 150 now, without loss"

"seems like a legcutter, which Azhar has no trouble handling. Clips to short midwicket"
that's well played - and the umpire adds one more run to a very good shot by reminding Gabriel of a problem he knows painfully well. He oversteps with a short ball outside off and has to then watch Azhar carve it behind point with a well timed shot
"full on off stump, blocks"
"drifts the ball into the right-hander, at a full length, Shehzad gets bat and pad together to keep it out"
"'catch it,' they cry, but don't they know it's Shehzad, the man who sends shivers down the lottery industry's spine? He has charged out of his crease, looking to clatter the ball over mid-off, but ends up with an outside edge that loops over point"
keeps back to a flatter delivery and blocks
"stays back and leaves the ball, reading it as the legspinner pitching outside off"
"oho, he's caught at slip. No such thing as fourth time lucky apparently. Shehzad was saved by West Indies' ill-discipline so many times today, but now, he is undone by a peach. Lovely, ripping legbreak, draws him out to block, making him reach away from his body. It spins past the middle, takes the edge, and Shai Hope dives low to his right to pick up a fine catch"
"tosses it up on off stump, capably defends it"
"fullish on middle and leg, Azhar nurdles it through midwicket"
"pops a leading edge and the Gabriel does well to bend low in his followthrough and snap up the catch. Big man gets a big wicket and replays indicate the front foot is fine as well. Babar, so very new at the crease, does not know how slow this pitch is. He sees a length ball on the pads and his reflexes force him to flick too early. Soft dismissal"
gets in line with a shortish delivery and blocks
"full on off stump, Younis refuses it passage"
"evades the line of a bouncer, just outside off. Ducking is not quite the way to go though, the ball only just went over the stumps"
"back of a length and outside off, ignores it"
"comes around the wicket for a length ball, but since Azhar picks it early, and since he knows there is ample turn in the pitch, he hangs back and cuts to point"
"tosses it up on middle and leg, defends"
"quicker and flatter on leg stump, Azhar doesn't have the time to press forward, but he has to because this is a full ball too. Awkward block"
"shortish and slow on leg stump, turns to square leg"
"gets the drive out, but he can't beat mid-off"
"pierces the gap at cover as he waits for the shortish delivery to spin away from him, exploiting the eventual room. As long as Bishoo bowls this very ball, and he so often does, this line of attack won't perturb a batsman with Azhar's ability"
"short and outside off, Azhar goes for a cut and misses"
"good length ball outside off, Azhar ushers it to the wicketkeeper"
"full and outside off, drives to cover"
"shortish and outside off, Azhar swivels on the back foot and pulls through square leg"
jams his bat down on a full delivery outside off and guides it to cover
"fullish on off stump, blunts it firmly"
"sends a full toss on leg stump racing towards the midwicket boundary. Pulls up though, on the outfield for Kieron Powell to stop with his boot"
"huge turn outside off, and West Indies believe there is an edge on the way through to the wicketkeeper's gloves. Holder is asking for someone to counsel him, but Dowrich himself doesn't look confident. They don't take the review So Younis can bat on. Though he wouldn't want to repeat that stroke. Lunging forward and reaching for the ball that kept on spinning away from him"
"good length ball outside off, no shot offered"
"falls to a long hop! West Indies are loving this last session. Karma working in their way? How else would you explain Younis, a man who has banished short balls from spinners for a millennia, picking out short midwicket?"
"tosses it up on off stump, defends"
comes forward to block a flighted delivery on off stump
"<b>keeps low</b>, but Azhar, by virtue of staying at the wicket for so long, is able to tap it towards point"

"full on off stump, defends to mid-on"
"good length ball outside off, refuses to play"
"back of a length on off stump, Azhar plonks the bat on top of it"
"slices a full toss on off stump to point, where Chase sprints to his right and stops the prospect of runs"

gets down low to sweep a flighted delivery outside off to long leg
strides to the pitch of a full ball and slices it to point
gets in line with a full delivery outside off and blocks to cover
"the ball pops over to gully, off of Misbah's thigh pad. West Indies appeal for a catch, but do not look for a review when umpire Oxenford shoots it down.

"oh, dear! Guess what! He won't get the century! Yet again. Look at Holder and the West Indies fielders celebrating. Caught in two minds one short of a ton. Short of a length, outside off, Misbah makes a late decision to leave it but is late in withdrawing his bat. Unwittingly edges it to second slip off the front glove as it kicks up all of a sudden. Successive scores of 99 for the Pakistan captain"

No inside edge, definitely and hits him on the flap of the front pad before hitting the back thigh, so this could be gone. Replays confirm it would have hit the top part of leg stump. It was back of a length and angling in, beats the batsman trying to close the face of his bat and flick it away, hits the back thigh. Shafiq walks away rubbing his thigh. Replays confirm ball would have hit the top part of leg stump, so the on-field call remains"

"strays down leg, Hope beaten on the inside edge. The ball ricochets towards point via the pad"
"and Yasir strikes. Against the run of play. Chase just grew in confidence in his attacking ability after that sweep.

He tried to flick but realised this one came back in a long way and tucked the bat behind the pad. Luckily for him, Hawkeye shows it would've just clipped leg stump, and so the call stays with the umpire. <b> Because he said not out, it will stay not out. </b> Not a terrible review by any means.

"Hope picks out cover. He can't quite believe that, but you run that risk if you hit in the air. Tossed up outside off, plenty of flight. Quick through the air. Hope isn't to the pitch, the ball has room to spin, it does, stops in the surface a touch and Hope finds cover, a reverse-cupped catch. That's a special knock from Hope. Great effort"
"there you go. Two in two. Just a bit of movement, and that is all you need. Fullish delivery outside off, the ball pitches and seams back in. Vishaul pokes at that, bat away from pad, and gets a thick inside edge which clatters into the stumps. If Pakistan had an opening before this, they have two now. A little bit of movement is a lot better than a lot of it in this level."

"genuine edge. Full around off, fourth-stump line. Outside-edged to second slip on the bounce. A sign of the dying bounce"
"one more. What a catch by Younis. That is an exceptional grab. Younis has a sheepish smile. Was that the googly? It was. Holder goes back, looking for a punch through cover. The ball spins back in, but not as much spin as Holder expected. There was a thick outside edge, it clips Sarfraz's glove and flies towards Younis' left at first slip, who parries, fumbles and holds on to a sensational catch. The umpires just check if it was taken cleanly. Soft signal is out. Third umpire decision out."

Seems initially as though it would go down leg and the sharp angle is what prompted Shehzad to go for the review. Replays show the ball would have barely clipped leg stump, just the outside part of it, so on-field call remains"
