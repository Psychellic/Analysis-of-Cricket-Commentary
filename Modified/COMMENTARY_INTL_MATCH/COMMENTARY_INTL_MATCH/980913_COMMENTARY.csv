"129 kph, caught on the crease as he attempts a nudge off the pads. Zaheer though extracts a bit more bounce, and crucially some inward movement to beat the batsman"
that's just about perfect. Zaheer plants it on a good length targeting off stump. It's at 130-plus kph and curves back into the right-hander. Vijay gets a good front stride as he blocks
"beautiful bowling! The first two zipped in at the right-hander, and knowing that, Zaheer has slanted this back of a length ball across him. Vijay pokes and misses"
"good on Vijay to play late, runs the length delivery behind point to get off the mark"
"131 kph, an uppish flick from Vohra through square leg. Perhaps this back of a length ball came at him a little later than he expected."
opens the face and slides the shortish delivery off the front foot to cover. A short cover had also been in position for that ball. Signs of a slow pitch?
driven to cover
"that was rather academic. The last ball was hit along the ground for no runs, so Vijay decides the next time the ball is flighted he will go over the infield. Gets to the pitch and lifts it superbly"
"<b>dropped</b> by a rickety-looking Zaheer running back from cover, but the recovery is good enough that Delhi capitalise on a run-out chance. Vijay was looking for that extra cover loft again, but Negi foxes him by holding the ball back. The batsman seemed to be reaching for it, the ball skewed up off the outside edge. Zaheer couldn't make the most of the opportunity, but a mix-up between the two batsman offers another one and this time Delhi do not miss. Karun Nair the man with a throw, and it zoomed in right at the base of the stumps for the wicketkeeper to do the rest"
"flighted outside off, driven to cover"
"shortish and outside off, cut away past the slip fielder. A very thick outside edge, but that will do"
strides forward to block a tossed up ball
"does make up for his fielding with balls like that. Ripper of a delivery, pitching on a length and veering away past the outside edge"
back of a length draws the batsman into a poke outside off. It's the offcutter that's gripping in the pitch and getting purchase
"third offcutter on the trot, and Zaheer beats Vohra's flailing bat again"
"finally bat on ball, and there was a run-out chance again! Vohra strides forward and glides a shortish ball to point. Wants to get off the strike, but is sent back rightly"
back of a length and outside off  - rather slow too - Vohra was on the back foot trying to use his wrists and yet the ball goes back down the pitch
"that's the fourth time he has beaten the bat in this over! It's off a shortish length, not much movement. A similar state of affairs with Vohra's feet. Just his hands reach out for the ball and they do not make any contact"
"how has that not taken off stump out! Morris seems to be asking the same question, as he walks back to his mark with his hand on his head. This one's pacy. Very pacy. It's full, it draws Marsh into driving even when his front foot's asleep. The gap between the bat and pad is exploited by the inswing he generates"
"good length ball outside off, driven through the covers"
"just the kind of shot that shows everyone at the ground how much pressure the batsman's under. Vohra stands legside of the ball and slashes at it. The outside edge flies away over the offside infield, Negi rushing back from point pulls it back just in the nick of time"
"149 kph, pure pace! Marsh goes for a pull, but he has mis-hit it into the point region."
"140kph, spears in a yorker, and it was swerving in as well. Jammed onto Marsh's back boot. He wasn't ready for that. Superb variation. But the impact was just outside leg"
"shortish and outside off, dabbed towards point to get off strike"
"looks for the yorker, with a man positioned almost at short leg. But Zaheer's pace is more or less medium nowadays. Marsh works it to square leg"
"good length on middle, Marsh nudges to short midwicket"
"shortish and just outside off, Marsh rides the bounce towards point"
"shortish and outside off, cut away to the boundary. Just waited an extra second on that ball to make sure the width on offer was capitalised on"
stays on the back foot as Zaheer keeps hitting the deck hard. Clip towards midwicket
"slower ball on off stump, Marsh blocks it down the pitch"
not the best start for him. Angles into the right-hander's pads and Vohra helps it on its way behind square leg. Simple cricket. Didn't look to overhit it
"back of a length on middle and off, Vohra opens the face and scampers across before point can catch up"
"very good behind point, a strength that has at times become a weakness in Tests. Marsh steps forward to a good length ball angled across him and slices it away"
"there's more evidence of his timing. A little more effort into this shot though, going deep in his crease to get under the length ball and smash it to the point boundary."
gets under it again and the upper cut flies to the third man boundary. Superb cricket
"goes for the blockhole, Vohra jams a straight bat down on it. Brathwaite shows his frustration at conceding back-to-back boundaries by feigning a throw"
"how bout that for a first ball in his 100th IPL game? Tossed it up over the batsman's eyeline, and Marsh is tempted. He rushes down the track, gets beaten by the dip, and de Kock does a good job behind the stumps. He had been blinded by the batsman, but stayed low, rose with and towards the ball down leg and flipped the bails over"
"foxes him with the googly. This is lovely bowling. Out-thinking the batsman. A jittery Miller reaches for the ball, but his feet are rooted to the same spot. So close to the outside edge"
"goes for the sweep, perhaps on instinct, Miller gets enough bat on it to find the fine leg boundary"
that's a short one - skidded through under Miller's bat as he went for a pull
strides forward to a good length ball and works it with the spin. Bisects deep square leg and deep midwicket
moves back and punches a shortish leggie through the covers
"beaten for pace. This is at 140 kph, and it straightens after pitching as well. Vohra doesn't get back and across, so his push with hard hands does not meet anything"
"a low full toss on middle and off, Morris has his hands on his head. It was the slower ball gone wrong. Vohra whips it away to long leg"
has to leap off his feet to block this 146 kph shortish delivery on middle and leg
another great take! De Kock throws himself to his right and comes up with a one-handed save. Morris is bowling very briskly tonight and this was a yorker. Slides down leg before Miller could connect with his flick
"right up there, but with width this time. It's the perfect length for a drive. Miller misses out though as he picks out Zaheer at mid-off"
"133 kph, shortish delivery on middle and leg, Miller goes for a swivel pull. Didn't make the sweetest connection, which means only a single to long leg"
"just enough on it to fly away past the diving de Kock. Morris goes for the bouncer, and it comes looking for Vohra's ears. The batsman though swivels on his back foot, and though he didn't make the soundest connection, he benefits"
"ooooh, that's another big blow! The appeal was instant, and insistent. Miller seemed to have decided he would combat spin with sweeps and Mishra has cottoned onto that. This is a googly that pitches marginally on leg stump and strikes him flush on the front pad. Height, good. Adjacent, yes. But HawkEye did show half the ball pitched outside leg."
"out comes the wrong'un again. Maxwell did not pick it. Stayed deep in his crease to read it off the pitch, but his hands weren't quick enough with the flick to make contact"
"more googlies! Maxwell is right back in his crease. Looking to play the ball off the pitch, but again he has no chance. It was pitched too full for him to adjust. Weathers an lbw appeal as he misses a flick again, but this would have slid down leg"
"oh, he's bagged a duck. Mishra tosses this one up and finally Maxwell decides to go on the front foot. But he doesn't hold himself. back. Lofts, but has very little power on it because he couldn't get under it well enough. Long-off runs in and takes a good, low catch"
tossed up and skirts down leg leg side.
"tossed up outside off, driven through the covers"
"good length ball on off stump, Axar Patel the new batsman defends well enough"
"flighted just outside off, defended"
"good running from Vohra, clips a flatter delivery through to deep square leg and gets back for the second"
stays back again having judged the length to be shortish and picks it into the gap at midwicket
"a little shortish again, but Axar, bogged down by the situation, defends"
"looks to force a good length ball to long-off, but cover cuts to his left and stops it"
moves back and taps a good length ball to long-on
"stays back to a loopy legspinner and picks it through midwicket. Axar said no, then just took off, and was sent back by a bemused Vohra"
goes back and blocks a good length ball on off stump
punches a slightly flatter delivery on off stump to long-on
"these googlies are slipping through Kings XI's defences like Trojan horses. Mishy dresses them up as legspinners, pitching on and around off stump, Vohra thinks it will spin away and sets himself up for the cut. By the time he realises what is really happening, it is too late. Leg stump takes a pounding"
"flighted on off stump, strides forward to block"
"flighted outside off, eased towards point off the open face"
"tossed up outside off, Axar drags it down to long-on"
"flighted just outside off, driven to long-on"
"shortish and outside off, Axar rocks back and cuts to deep point. Jayant isn't getting much turn, but he still has a slip and is getting away with a few bad balls because of Kings XI's batting slump"
moves back and drills a flatter delivery from outside off to midwicket
gets forward and outside off to pat a flighted delivery outside off to long-on
"back of a length, punched into the covers"
"fuller ball on middle and leg, sent through to deep square leg courtesy some wrist work"
"moves around the stumps for a back of a length slower delivery, Axar is back and across a little too early and though he adjusts his bat swing, he is struck on the pads. Too high for the lbw shout"
"good length, slower again, Axar looks for a cover drive but the inside edge wanders into the leg side"
looks like he is dealing with slower balls almost exclusively. Just varying his length - this one's the short one - Axar tries a pull and mistimes this too
"shortish and outside off, Axar dabs it behind point"
"legcutter, Saha spotted it, waited on it and dabs it towards point. But he was also looking for a single, when his partner wasn't. Point hits direct and this is trouble. Saha does stretch, but has not dived and that will cost him. JP Duminy with the throw."
"flatter delivery on middle and off, tucked towards midwicket"
"flighted just outside off, defended into the covers"
now he gets turn. The outside edge skirts away past slip and to third man. Dipped on the left-hander
"stays back for a good length ball on off stump, defended"
stays back and blocks a flatter delivery on middle
"goes for the lap sweep, the premeditated kind, Jayant pitches it on middle and it goes on with the arm past the leg stump and into the keeper's hands. QdK has been superb tonight."
"shortish on off stump, blocked with soft hands to point"
lovely bowling. He keeps pitching back of a length - where there are patches of grass - and the seam hits there and deviates away. Axar goes for a backfoot push and is beaten
"well placed! There was a deep square leg and long leg, Axar pulls hard and keeps it down and bisects them"
"back of a length on off stump, defended"
"shortish and outside off, cut to point. Duminy could have had Axar had he hit direct again. He had opened the face to try and beat the fielder to his right, but Duminy's too good"
"yorker on middle, Axar pats it down to long-on"
"haven't seen him make much impact with the ball, but Negi's completed a superb catch at backward point. Axar goes back and is in two minds. Its a short ball, it had to be slashed away but the scoreboard pressure makes him wonder if he should go hard. In the end, he just slices the ball and Negi runs in, dives forward and takes it cleanly"
"tossed up outside off, Mohit reaches forward to block but with him not reaching the pitch, it turns and jumps at him. Hits the pads"
overpitched and Mohit slog sweeps it to the midwicket boundary.
skids through past is pads as Mohit goes back to flick
"slashed over the covers. Length ball, but it was far too wide. Mohit frees his arms and gets some vital runs"
"moves around the stumps, Jayant bowls the one that goes on with the arm. Mohit gets an outside edge to point"
clipped behind square leg
"low full toss on off stump, Mohit doesn't know whether to bash it of be circumspect. Checks his lofted drive and nearly gives catching practice to Zaheer at mid-off."
"slower ball, pitched fullish on middle, defended from the crease"
"another offcutter at 123 kph, targeting Johnson's pads, perhaps trying to avoid giving him room. Johnson goes for a flick, doesn't connect, settles for a legbye behind point"
"jabs a shortish delivery with the open face, and Brathwaite at deep third man suddenly realises he was under pressure. Dives to his right and saves a single"
"looks for the yorker on middle, Johnson was backing away and just about puts bat on it. That was 146 kph says the speedgun and cover makes sure its a dot"
"shortish on leg stump, nudged into the leg side but not far enough to beat the bowler"
"that's gone so high, but Morris looked perfectly comfortable getting under it. Mohit simply goes for a big hit. Just a big swing of the arms. The ball skews off the outside half and is then in the hands of the man at mid-off"
"goes for the blockhole, pushed to long-on"
clears the front leg and goes for a wild hoick over the leg side. Zaheer's offcutter beats him
that took the bottom edge as Sahu was looking for a slice behind point. The offcutter did get the better of the batsman and yet it ends up at the third man boundary
"shortish and outside off, slogs and misses"
"goes full and straight, driven to long-off"
"was that a bit of reverse? It's at 143 kph, aimed at the blockhole, and spears into the right-hander. Defended"
"fuller ball just outside off, Sahu slashes it to deep point"
"yorker on middle, Johnson pushes it down to long-off"
"another one looking for the base of middle, pushed down the ground"
"big old slog and the Morris slower ball beats him and topples off stump. Yorkers are good, but sometimes you also need that odd bit of variation"
"that should have cleaned Kings XI up - 146 kph inswinging yorker, and Sandeep, the batsman gave it a free pass by backing away. Just skirts past the off stump. Brilliant bowling from Morris"
"swiped away between midwicket and long-on, Sanju Samson runs to his left and stops it well"
"length ball, and even though Brathwaite tried to follow the batsman making room, it was in the slot to be smacked. Sahu lofts it over long-off"
"slower ball outside off, Sahu slogs it to the left of deep midwicket"
"looks to go full, Sahu punches it to cover"
"nice and full on off stump, worked away to deep midwicket"
"slower ball outside off, slog across the line, dot."
"fullish, tight on off stump, a bit of swing away from de Kock, check-driven to mid-off"
"a little bit shorter and wider, chopped into the covers with a diagonal bat"
back of a length. De Kock meets this just outside off stump and works it to long leg
"length ball, a bit of movement in towards off and middle. Iyer was coming forward, looking to push into the covers, and ends up playing into the midwicket region off the inner half of his bat"
"overpitched, a bit of width, and de Kock frees his arms to slice that over cover point"
"length ball on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"nice length outside off, angling further away. Iyer is a little late coming on the front foot, and is still on the move while he plays this attempted extra-cover push. The ball beats his outside edge"
"a bit of shape into the pads, tucked away to the left of midwicket"
"back of a length, straightening towards off and middle. De Kock is opened up a little while defending back down the pitch"
"shortish outside off, opens his bat face to dab to backward point"
angles this one into the pads and de Kock tucks it quietly to fine leg
"back of a length on middle and leg, worked away towards long leg"
"took ages and ages to bring his finger up, and it seems Shreyas Iyer has tickled one down the leg side. It was a good length ball, slanted quite a distance down leg. Just the kind that would normally end up on the fine leg boundary, but it ends up as a very fine edge that the keeper has no trouble getting behind. Snicko, however, suggests there was nothing on it."
"good length ball, moving in off the deck, Samson defends a little gingerly"
tests Samson with the bouncer. Uncomfortable height - around his neck - doesn't make any contact with his pull shot
"back of a length on off stump, pushed into the covers"
inches forward at a good length ball and pushes it towards mid-off
crisp strike into the covers - this time off the back foot in accordance with the shortish length - but he picks out Axar
"might have misinterpreted the length there. De Kock stays deep in his crease, set up for the pull, but it was a lot fuller than that.  Hurries into the stroke and finds a single at midwicket"
"steps forward to a back of a length ball on off stump, defended"
shimmies down and whips a back of a length delivery from off stump to mid-on
"bouncer, ruled one for the over, and a scream from Mohit indicated how much he put on that. But despite all that, it slides harmlessly down leg with the batsman hardly interested"
"that was dangerously close to Axar at deep midwicket. Samson was looking to simply chip a back of a length ball over the infield, but might have got a lot more on it than he intended"
"walks at the bowler, but Mohit keeps his head and bowls a good length ball on fourth stump. Would be risky to try anything besides a block and that's what Samson does."
"a little too full to cut, but de Kock plays the trajectory, and is eager to push the score on. Cuts and gets a bit of an edge"
"gets down for the sweep, but it's a little too quick and offers him very little room to free the arms. Axar appeals, but it had struck him outside the line of off stump"
driven to long-off
"<b>dropped</b> by M Vijay at deep square leg! He had made a lot of ground running in, but as he got close to the ball he had to bend low and that put him off balance as a result of that sprint. De Kock looked for the sweep again, but his timing wasn't quite there this time either"
"flighted outside off, driven into the covers"
"lashed over point. Width and that's what de Kock thrives on. The minute he sees something outside off, he knows he will capitalise"
""
superb timing from de Kock as he flicks an overpitched ball from middle to deep square leg
a simple glide to deep third man as Samson uses the pace on this shortish delivery outside off
"fine leg was up, so all de Kock had to do was get some bat on a fuller ball angled into him. Minimum effort, maximum reward."
"132 kph, back of a length and outside off. de Kock closes the face as he directs the ball to short midwicket"
chops a shortish delivery to find a single behind point. Soft hands. The ball barely travelled past the square
"poor start, and he's saved by a rapid Maxwell at the deep square leg boundary. Awfully short ball on middle, pulled away"
doesn't get his length right that time either. Shortish and quite wide outside off too. Samson reaches out and cuts to deep point
"oh, well played. De Kock went as far back as he could and a good length ball ended up being just right for a slice behind point."
"goes back again, but this time Sahu tightens his line and lands it on off stump"
"terrible ball, but it does end up as a dot. Halfway down the pitch, de Kock moves across to try and pull to fine leg. No connection"
"should have been stumped! Sahu has bowled a beauty, tossed it up to drag the batsman outside his crease. De Kock goes for a flick, but the ball dips and turns between his bat and pad. Saha didn't keep his eyes on the ball, and he didn't even react as the ball zipped past his right"
leans across on front foot and tucks it through midwicket
"that's a fine shot. Strides forward, reverses the bat and sends a length ball hurtling away to the third man boundary. Flat of trajectory and just the right length to hit out"
""
"shortish and outside off, de Kock backs away and that gives him the room he needs to lace the ball through the covers"
goes back on a ball on middle and works it to midwicket
""
"lovely little lap sweep. De Kock plants his front leg across outside off to avoid the lbw, lets the length ball come to him and lets it ping off the ramp he had created with the bat. He knows Axar doesn't turn the ball too much. Knows he can just play him as a medium pacer"
""
"that's a gentle little slice past point. Samson made sure he opened the face enough to beat point on his left. Played it off the front foot, pushed off it for the first run, and comes back for the second"
"flighted just outside off, driven back at the bowler"
"tossed it up, Samson liked that, runs down the pitch and drills it to long-off"
"flighted on off stump, de Kock sweeps it to long leg. Didn't look for any power, just wanted to give it direction"
"that should ease his nerves. Samson has had to hold himself back all this while, but now he has turned a good ball into a bad one. Runs down the track the moment there was flight on the ball, gets a full toss and lofts it over long-on"
"fuller ball outside off, slapped past a diving cover fielder and with mid-off on the circle, they can pinch a single"
"banged into the middle of the deck and it soars over the batsman's head. Too far over to interest the batsman, but the umps catch on"
bashed down the ground. Mohit went short again and allowed the freedom for Samson to pick his spot - straight back over the bower
"back of a length and middle and off, sliced to deep third man"
lets a shortish delivery slide off the open face towards point.
"the penalty for his playing across the line is that he has to weather a big lbw appeal from Mohit. Hit him on the flap of the pad, but he was back in his crease. Perhaps pitched outside leg. Samson pulls him through for a single. Maxwell raced in from point and had he hit the bowler's end stumps direct, that could have been close."
slower ball - shortish in length - Samson stays behind it and dabs it towards point
"fires it down the leg side, Saha moves across but can't collect it cleanly. Mohit at short fine leg sends a throw that nearly injures the wicketkeeper"
very deft. Samson watched the short ball pass him and then plants the open face of the bat in its path. The ball hurries away to the third man boundary
"and this one shows his power. Short ball with some width, Samson goes back and punches through point"
"another short ball, but this time he can't pierce the off side ring"
pushed into the covers
comes down the track and drives to long-off
"flighted on off stump, de Kock comes forward to defend and gets an inside edge to midwicket"
a little wide outside off and Samson had to reach out as he plays a cover drive
"picked up the slower ball and launches it down the ground. It was overpitched on middle and de Kock lifts his back foot up, keeps his front foot straight and presents a straight bat"
"swings from the hip and this pull shot was enough to beat the deep midwicket fielder. Didn't even care there was a man there. Hit it in the air, even with protection on the boundary"
worked to long  leg
"another slower, shorter delivery outside off, Samson runs it to deep third man"
"moves around the stumps to the left-hander too, but it was a terrible ball. Banged in short and down leg, de Kock swivels on the back foot and pulls it high over the long leg boundary"
gets down the track to knock a good length ball to long-on
"shortish and angled across the left-hander from around the stumps, de Kock glides it behind point"
"flighted on off stump, driven to long-off"
"shortish and outside off, patted into the covers"
"he's missed a straight one. Samson hared down the pitch and looked to slap one down the ground. But Axar bowled it quicker and flatter, it sneaks below his bat and knocks the stumps"
on the pads and Negi plays a neat little leg glance to get off the mark
"goes against the spin, but he had reached the pitch of the ball and therefore doesn't have to worry about the risk. Lashes a flighted delivery over cover"
"shortish on middle and leg, pulled to deep square leg"
in the slot for the slog sweep and Negi does not disappoint. Sends it soaring over the midwicket boundary to stamp Daredevils' dominance on this match
