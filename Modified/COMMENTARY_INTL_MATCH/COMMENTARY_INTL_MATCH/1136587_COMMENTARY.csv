"full on middle, slower ball at 114.4 ks, but Rayudu picks it and holds his shape as he carts it over long-on. This man is in some form"

"flat and powerful. Pitched right up to Raina with the gift of room, and he shovels it straight over the bowler's head after freeing his arms"
"that's even better. Steps down the track and mows this over long-on. A typical Raina strike, just giving the impression that it may not be clean, and then sailing well over"

"too full and a bit of width as he floats it up outside off, Rayudu jams the bat down and hits the turf"
"has he picked the fielder there? Yes, he has. Comes slightly forward and then slogs this Pandya delivery but it sails right into the waiting hands of deep midwicket as he doesn't find the power he's looking for. Cutting didn't have to move an inch. Surely, that counts as a failure for Rayudu going by his ridiculous form this season?"

"drills this, one bounce to long-off. Saw this in his swinging arc, brought out his powerful bottom-handed whip to belt this. <strong>Typical Dhoni shot</strong>"

"slapped to point, where there's a misfield by Suryakumar. Dhoni pinches a single to keep strike"
"drifts in and spins away from middle, turned to the leg side"
"sees Dhoni stepping out and fires this wide. No problem, Dhoni does well to reach out and then slam this inside-out over cover. Foxed him but he still had enough to use his reach to pick this."
"<strong>beaten by the googly, but is safe! </strong> Steps out to swing, misses but has the presence of mind to quickly plonk his bat back in. <b> Only Dhoni could've stumped Dhoni there </b>"
"the bottom-handed drill is sent soaring into the stands at long-on. Too full from Markande, just a little skip down the pitch from Dhoni as he tees off in style. So close he got to the pitch that he negated the turn superbly."

"full toss outside off, Dhoni reaches out to hit this well but picks out deep cover where Evin Lewis takes a dolly. Was McClenaghan looking to bowl a wide yorker? Doesn't matter, he's got the wicket somehow."
works this half-pull from outside off to deep backward square leg
"no room to swing, so he ends up slicing this pull to Markande at point. This is very good from McClenaghan, hit the deck hard to extract bounce. The effort ball has done the trick. Well held by the 20-year old. Mumbai are roaring back at the death."
"cramped for room, plays the short-arm jab to deep midwicket"
"slower length ball outside off, steered straight to point but he's off the mark"
"backs away to go over the off side, McClenaghan angles it in to cramp him. Raina goes through and just manages to hit it past cover point"

"wallops this length ball to clear deep midwicket.  Bumrah shortened his length so Raina didn't get underneath it, but didn't matter. Not much of a backswing but he still managed to generate enough power to clear the ropes."

"pulled, one bounce to deep square leg"

"backs away, so Hardik goes full and wide, Billings toe-ends this swing across the line to long on"
whips this full toss from outside off towards deep midwicket
steps out and heaves this straight down Cutting's throat at long-on. Hardik's slower deliveries are yielding returns for Mumbai at the death.

"right into Raina's swinging arc and he's walloped this over deep midwicket. Saw Raina backing away, and tried to cramp him but ended up straying on the pads. Raina didn't miss out."

"ah, throws water on a good, tight over with this legside back of a length delivery that Lewis swivels and helps along to the fine leg boundary"
another leg-sidish delivery. CSK can ill-afford this. Angled into his pads and Suryakumar gets on his toes before tucking it off the pads behind square
"that's much tighter. A short of a length delivery around off, Suryakumar jabs it back to the bowler from the crease"
"short ball, Yadav mistimes his pull and swings early to get hit around the rib cage area on his right side"
"this is not the ideal length to be bowling at all. Too short, and so much width on offer. Yadav waits and then jumps before slashing a late uppercut through third man"
"back of a length, angled in towards middle, flicked away to deep backward square leg"
"fullish around leg, turns it away behind square leg for a quick brace"
gets slightly squared up by this back of a length delivery and ends up dropping it just in front of the bowler
not much room to work with there but Yadav makes up for it by shifting back and subtly opening the face of his bat to knock it through backward of point

"this time the doosra, the length is too short though, punched to long on"
"slider that drifts back in to keep a touch low, Lewis eases this down to deep point"
