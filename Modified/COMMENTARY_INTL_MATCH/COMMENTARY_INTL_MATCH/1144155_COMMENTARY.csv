"back of a length and seams back in to pin the pad, but the height seems to be an issue. Not given lbw by the umpire. <strong>Sarfraz wants a review</strong>. Abbas' front foot is fine. The ball starts outside off and shapes in to hit the front pad above the knee-roll. I think this is going to be umpire's call. Yup, the tracker returns umpires call on leg stump and de Bryun survives. Abbas looks skywards"

"Another appeal for lbw from Abbas. Umpire Wilson raises his finger, de Bryun knows he has been trapped in front. Nice and full, reverses in, de Bryun, having shuffled across, does not lay bat on ball and is pinned in front of middle. That's adjacent and the batsman doesn't even bother to review. Abbas finally has some success after the break"

"much fuller on off, blocked back to Amir"
"<strong>Amir finds reverse swing,</strong> finds the outside edge, and it settles into the gloves of Sarfraz. Good length and curving away close to off stump, which means Bavuma to play at it.

"<b>he's got him with an offcutter!</b> Or so he thinks. Azhar reviews. It's got him on the pad, but he's been given out caught at gully. SA and the umpire think there is an inside edge on that. But it'll be checked for two dismissals...first indication from the replays is that there's no bat on it. It's hitting the flap as he defends on the front foot...and it's missing off stump. <b>Good review.</b> The double sound was the ball flicking the flap and then going onto thigh guard, not bat onto pad as it appeared at first"

"length ball wide outside off, left alone"
"length outside off, blocked into the covers"
"<b>big appeal for catch behind.</b> Wilson says not out. South Africa review. This short of a length ball jumps into Masood and cuts him in half. There's a sound as it passes him and sails over the stumps. QDK takes it down leg side...<b>there is thigh guard on it.</b> But was there an edge first? Ultra Edge awaited...<b>a disturbance as it passes bat.</b> Thin edge, thigh guard, and taken down leg. Decision overturned. Masood doesn't look happy about that. Big angry strides up the tunnel."

"back of a length and in the channel at 140ks, left alone"
"<strong>De Kock thinks he has his man</strong>, but umpire Ravi shoots down the caught-behind appeal. Elgar chats with de Kock and calls for a review. Olivier runs in hard and hits the deck harder. Back of a length and zipping away outside off, Olivier tempts Azhar into jabbing at it. Daylight between bat and ball. Poor review from SA and they lose it"
"short and outside off, Azhar arches back and lets it pass"
Shafiq gets on top of a short one outside off and forces it to the covers off the back foot

"<b>Nasty, nasty delivery from Olivier</b> and it puts Azhar out of his misery. Olivier roars right in the face of the outgoing batsman. Back of a length and explodes from the pitch outside off, Azhar jumps off the ground and is airborne as he desperately fends at the ball. Gloves it through to de Kock diving away to his right. Vicious bounce. What a miserable tour for Azhar Ali"

yorker just outside off. Jammed into the leg side off the inside half
<b>falls short of mid-off!</b> Babar will always go for the pull. Almost costs him this time. It's not as short as he thinks it is. And it's wide and seaming away outside off. Half-pull and it lobs off the toe-end as he checks the shot. Mid-off won't get there
"short and wide outside off, left alone"
"short at off stump, defended on the back foot"
hits the <b>right bicep</b> or possibly the right side of the chest as he drops the bat to let this pass. Short ball dips in at him

<b>outside edge</b> past second slip. Short ball up in the corridor. Looks to punch but that gets too big on him. Thick edge flies wide of the cordon
"<b>got him!</b> Doesn't give you a chance, this guy! Short ball again. Just gets so steep when he hits that length, more so than any other bowler in this line-up. Babar wants to get on the back foot to defend this. It's not a bad option at all. But it gets to throat height and he can't control it from there. A glove and QDK takes a simple catch"
"<b>bowled him!</b> He continues this double-wicket over trend! Third time for him in the Test. Sarfraz is hanging back in the crease expecting a bouncer. They've just brought in short leg. It's a trap. This is a short of a length and ball and it tonks the top of off, coming in with the angle. Sarfraz is too late on the defence"
"<b>shot!</b> Length ball in at off stump, and a good forward stride to punch firmly on the up past the bowler"

bouncer at an off stump line. Quickly crouches to get out of the way
"short of a length just outside off, defended into the covers"
"<b>taken at second slip.</b> Was a matter of time before one went up instead of down. Length outside off. Gets forward to defend.

"length at middle stump, languidly pushed into the leg side off the front foot"
"length at off stump, blocked into the covers"
"<b>short of third slip.</b> Short of a length just outside off. Not enough room for the cut, which he has attempted. Jams his glove as it drops to De Bruyn's left at third slip"

<B>top edge</b> sails over the keeper. Faheem playing the shot that got him out in the first innings. Short and climbing at the helmet. Swipes and swivels. Safe this time
short and slanted across off stump. Uses the angle to get on top of the bounce and slice it wide of gully

"<b>in front of square this time.</b> They put in a square leg halfway in from the boundary, so he needed to go in front of the stumps this time. Keeps his eyes on this short ball and drags it through midwicket as it slants across him"

"length outside off, punched to extra cover on the up"
"<b>oh great catch!</b> Markram at wide gully. He's not squatting like a normal cordon fielder does. On his toes and walking in, ever so slightly as the bowler runs in. Then he gets static and is ready to spring at it with a crouch as Faheem looks to cut a ball that is too close for the cut. It flies high to Markram's left but his initial momentum from the faux walk-in means he is in a good position to explode to his left. And he does it. And he gets two hands at it to grab on. Tumbles gracefully to his left to arrest the momentum too. Superb."
