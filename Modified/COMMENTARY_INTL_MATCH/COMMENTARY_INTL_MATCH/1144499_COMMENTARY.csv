"premeditated slide across the stumps, a back-foot punch out to cover"
"<B>huge appeal!</B> And after an eternity, Sarfaraz calls for the <B>review!</B> It was certainly adjacent to the stumps, but he was playing a stroke, so couldn't possibly be lbw ... an inside-edge maybe? Nope. That is a very sketchy waste"
"<B>zinger!</B> Leaps off the deck, past the gloves as the batsman leans forward and is sent rearing backwards. Amir is making the ball talk, but luckily for Warner, he doesn't understand Urdu!"

opens the face to steer another deflection into the off side
"looped into the blockhole, Smith retreats to leg in an attempt to make some room through the covers"

"145kph, short and angled across, climbing off a length, he misses trying to cut"

"138kph, angled into middle, he pushes towards cover and they pinch one"
"141kph, full angled into off, he whips this from off stump to long on"
"<strong>caught behind!</strong> 134kph but this rears off a length and catches the gloves on the way through to the keeper! Good short ball, Cummins was surprised, tried to lean back and cut but the bounce and pace was too much, it comes off the gloves and an easy catch for the skipper"
"141kph, full on off, he is camped on the crease, gets a leading edge after closing the face and it runs to cover"
"137kph, short into the ribs, he's uncomfortable fending this away into the on side"
"136kph, cracking bouncer, he tries to pull but is beaten for pace and bounce"
"slower ball banged in, he pulls without control, it hangs in the air for a while but falls short of fine leg"
"slower ball angled into middle, he clips this behind square for a single"
"<strong>LBW!</strong> Superb yorker! Carey <strong>reviews</strong>. It was full and tailed into the front shoe, he got it out of the way but it hit the back pad infront of leg. No bat involved by the looks. Nothing on ultra edge. Ball tracking says ... <strong>OUT</strong>. Pitched in line, hitting in line, smashing leg stump! Good decision. Even better bowling."
"129kph, good length angled across, he drives on the up through cover-point to the sweeper"
"full angled down leg, he flicks this fine of fine leg, Shaheen makes an excellent diving stop to save four"

"tight line and length, on the back foot, but an over-step! It's a <B>free hit coming up!</B> In fact, it shouldn't have been called, but too late now..."

"poor ball, on the toes, clipped behind square but well enough gathered on the bounce by the sweeper"
"back of a length, off-stump line, tough to take on that sort of ball so Fakhar shoulders arms and accepts it as a sighter"
"<B>sizzler!</B> Pitches on the left-hander's off stump, goes with the angle, climbs past the outside edge as Fakhar holds his line"
"<strong>this one goes like a 88mph offbreak!</strong> Pitches on off, turns a mile off the seam"
tapped back down the pitch
"another one jags wickedly off the seam, as Imam plays inside the line with a vertical bat"
"stands tall on the back foot, solid defence back down the track, half a thought of a single but Starc swoops quickly to send Fakhar scurrying for his crease"
"over the wicket, outside off, hitting the seam and climbing through to the keeper as Imam drives uppishly with hard hands"
"<strong>huge appeal!</strong> Starc goes half a yard fuller, and suddenly that jag off the seam is right up to the edge of the bat. Did it graze through to the keeper? The Aussies decline the review"
"back of a length, the first hint of width of the innings, so Fakhar <B>climbs into the cut with hard hands</B>, Richardson at third man is expertly positioned and gobbles the flying edge. That was a sucker punch, and Pakistan's hopes of a composed start are already looking wobbly"
"on the back foot, cautiously blocked into the off side"
through to the keeper on a tight off-stump line. Babar leaves well alone
"full length, blocked on the back foot in front of all three stumps. Solidity is the order of the day"
"<B>stand and deliver!</B> Babar waits for the over-pitch outside off. No footwork, but none needed! Just launching the hands through the arc and away to the point boundary!"
"head over the ball, solid block"
"tapped into the covers, pressing forward from deep in the crease"
"back of a length, angled into the legs, nudged to midwicket"
"<strong>short, and clattered!</strong> Imam takes no prisoners with that pull! A decent bouncer, well directed, but he's right on top of the stroke, rifling it through square leg!"
"91mph, into the toes, but Imam is well placed to block it back down the pitch"
"tight line, back of a length, defended with a compact stance to mid-on"
"right up to the toes, hint of outswing, solidly into line to defend. Australia on top but signs of composure from Imam in that over"
<B>that is liquid cricket!</B> Oozing through the covers with a sumptuous high elbow! Just a touch over-pitched and punished with alacrity!
"back of a length outside off, anchored in the crease in anticipation of the short ball, and dabs down to gully from under the nose"
"solid once more, drawn forward from the crease by a length ball on off stump. Blocked"

"once again, playing it late under the eyeline, poked to cover"
"<strong>crashed through the covers!</strong> Another punishing flow of the bat, Babar serves notice that anything in his area will travel!"
"on the back foot, blocked down into the crease"
"outside off, and <B>this one takes off from the deck!</B> Another beauty, but Imam to his credit refuses to be drawn into a nibble as he holds the line of off stump"
"<strong>short, slashed, clear of the slips!</strong> Short again from Starc, but on a wider line. Imam's reflexive pull takes a fat toe-end and soars over the cordon!"
"<strong>too full, too obvious!</strong> Imam knew it was coming, the attempted yorker, but with no swing, it was a simple flick through the leg-side from a well-set, well-balanced batsman!"
"outside off, back of a length, and a cautious, judicious leave. No need to chase those!"
"full once again, but sliding into the pads, and <B>clipped sweetly through fine leg!</B> All of a sudden, Pakistan are galloping along!"
"very full, tailing into the timbers, blocked on the back foot"

"fenced into the covers, a touch squared up by some nip off the deck"
"solid block, back to the bowler"
"on the legs, clipped to mid-on. Another dot-ball to extend the sequence ever further"
"<strong>finds the edge this time </strong>as Imam pushes with hard hands! But falls short of slip, surprisingly. That was a genuine nick"
"on the back foot, worked to the leg side"
"<strong>pinged off the pads</strong>, out through the leg side. Babar's bottom hand comes off the bat as he reaches round to time his clip, and it sizzles to the rope!"
"worked into the covers, off the back foot"
"short, pulled, another boundary? Nope, gathered at deep midwicket, and it's a <B>rare single!</B>"
through to the keeper
"squared up on the back foot, fenced down to third man"

"nudged into the off side, tip and run"
"back of a length, outside off"
"<B>that is a thing of beauty!</B> Babar's timing has been like a jazz drummer today! A stunning on-drive, feet slightly splayed to allow a measured push through the line to whistle to the rope. Gorgeous"
through to the keeper outside off stump
"short, and <strong>slapped straight to Richardson on the fence!</strong> That's a body blow! Babar's drives alone were going to win this game at a canter. But he's lured into a response to the bouncer, and doesn't come close to getting his wrists over the ball. Dragged down from way over his head like an amateur fly-fisherman, and backward square is in business again"
"outside off, hits the seam and jags. Rides the bounce into the gully"
"round the wicket, outside off, an open-faced poke to backward point"

"lofted into the toes, Hafeez drops to one knee on the sweep ... <B>doesn't nail it, but places it square of the sweeper!</B>"
"<B>he's nailed that one!</B> Ab-so-lute-ly massive, over long-on, with a semi-shimmy down the pitch and into the stands!"
