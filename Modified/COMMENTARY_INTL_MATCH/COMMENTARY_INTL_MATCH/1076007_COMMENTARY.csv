"pushes him back with a sharp, back of a length delivery on off stump. Babar defends"
"short and wide, hammers it to backward point"
drives on the up and looks for a quick single to mid-off. Gayle had about as much interest in that run as he has in dying his hair pink
"looks to hit hard, and mistimes a good length ball into the covers"
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
"racks up a maiden. Irfan's pace and his unerring accuracy around the off stump - coupled with Babar's nervousness at the crease, going at the ball hard, means he has failed to pick the gap with the drive. This time he finds point"
"<b>beauty</b>. Gayle is pinned to his crease, aiming to defend a short of a good length ball moving across him. Seams away off the deck, past the outside edge"
opens the face against a back of a length delivery and finds point
lets go a shortish delivery outside off. Islamabad not keen on giving drivable balls to Gayle
"143kph, cramps him for room on off stump and Gayle can only poke it back to the bowler"
slugs a back of a length delivery to mid-on. Even making room and powering the ball - that too with Gayle on strike - results in a dot ball. <b>First time that a PSL game has begun with 11 dots</b>
<b>two maidens on the trot</b>. Although really Gayle should have done more with this short ball on leg stump. Tries a leg glance and instead makes connection with thigh pad
"back of a length and outside off, flashes and misses outside off. That's 13 successive dots to start the game"
"there's the first runs, with Babar taking a ball aimed at the top of off stump on top of its bounce and crashes it over wide mid-on. Tough place to access against a seven-foot tall seriously fast bowler"
"fends away a bouncer. It climbs up towards Babar's left ear and he plays a pull, instinctively. The man up at fine leg goes chasing after it, puts in a slide to try and drag it back, but he is unable to do so. Could be that he is worried about a collision with Pooran running to his right from deep square leg and they do collide"
guides it to the third man boundary. Superb shot. All he does is let a short ball on off stump come on and gives it direction
"full, straight, whips it to long leg. Effortless shot from Babar. This is perhaps the easiest boundary he's hit. Half-volley from Irfan"
"moves around the wicket for a short delivery outside off, smacks it to the right of deep third man. Babar drags Gayle across for a second, and the throw, coming to the keeper's end is relayed across. Haddin hits direct but the batsman is safe"
off the mark with a gentle little clip through midwicket. One off seven now
"good length, moving across the right-hander, Babar pushes to cover"
"picks the back-of-the-hand slower ball, takes the risk of hitting across the line though. He has to make connection and he does. Enough to even beat short fine leg on his right"
"slaps a fuller delivery behind point. Not perfectly timed, and good effort from point as well, diving full-length to his left"
dabs it behind square leg for his second single of the night
"full on off stump, digs it out to mid-on"
"that's in the slot. A length ball, giving the left-hander width to hit through. And he muscles it with that big bad bat through extra cover"
"ooh, this is a better shot. Hits it through extra cover again, but this ball is short, and it's well outside leg, intending to cramp him up. But Gayle shifts beside the line and belts it"
"clears the front leg again, Sami does better, hitting back of a length and preventing Gayle access to the off side. Mis-hit to mid-on"
"pings a yorker on middle and Gayle just about keeps it out, off the inside half of the bat. Squeezes it through his legs to short fine leg"
backs away and heaves a slightly slower ball on leg stump to long-on
"takes a full ball on off stump and whips it through square leg. Risky shot, but he seems quite okay with that"
"a little roll of the wrists, but he seems to make sure while making contact, the bat is straight. So the full ball on off stump goes to mid-on"
"fuller delivery on off stump, whips it to midwicket"
hangs back and drills a shortish delivery to long-on
"length ball on middle, Gayle goes deep in his crease, gets under the ball and puts it into orbit over the square leg region"
"knocks him over! Looks for a repeat of the slog over square leg, but this time Rumman bowls it fuller, and pitches it outside off stump as well. In dragging the ball, Gayle gets an inside edge onto his stumps. The umpires check for the no-ball. It's all fine"
"back of a length on off stump, blocks"
"strikes first ball! It's the googly, and the batsman has no clue. Shadab wheels away in celebration, utterly chuffed with himself. And so he should be. He has deceived Babar to such an extent that he plays down the wrong line, defending, looking for the legbreak and is instead pinned low on the front pad right in front of middle stump"
"it's the one that turns in again, but Malik picks it, helped perhaps by the length being short. Flicks to long leg"
drifts into the pads and he works it through square leg
"tosses it up on off stump, Malik puts bat in front of pad to block"
"drives to long-off, lunging to get to the pitch of a flighted delivery outside off stump"
seems to have picked the variation as Sanga leaves a good length ball outside off and it spins away further
"back of a length and outside off, Malik is a little lead-footed. So his attempt the reach for the ball doesn't pan out"
opens the face and guides the shortish delivery on off stump to deep third man
"digs it in short, and angles it into the left-hander. Sanga evades it, Haddin though does not have the same luxury. Has to leap full length to his right and does very well to prevent a boundary"
"defends a shortish delivery on off stump. Sanga reluctant to come forward, worried about the bouncer from the seven-foot quick"
works it off the base of middle stump to midwicket. Misfield from Watson
"full toss on off stump, pushes it back down the pitch"
"beats him with a jaffa. It's back of a length, bites into the pitch and rears away past the angled bat that Malik uses to find runs at third man"
ginger little poke on off stump as Shadab bowls a quick googly on off stump. Even a batsman of Sanga's class can't pick it. Outside edge for four to third man
"tosses it up on middle and leg, Sanga looks for a cover drive, but gets an inside edge onto pad"
"shortish and outside off, goes for a cut, inside edge"
"flatter delivery outside off, heaves it to deep midwicket"
"spots Malik rushing down the track and bowls a really quick, really flat delivery on middle and leg. The batsman has to rush into putting bat down on it"
"pulls a flatter, quicker delivery on off stump and makes such solid connection that it screams to the square leg boundary. That is not an easy shot"
"back of a length on off stump, Sanga tries to force it, but his drive finds mid-off"
"steps down, but Watson sees the batsman's shenanigans and digs in a bouncer. Called wide though. Oh, well I suppose it was really really short but Sanga was advancing"
"back of a length and outside off, glides it to deep third man"
"taps the offcutter down to third man. Set up for the shot a bit too early and has to go through with it. Considering the length, it could maybe have been slogged over the leg side"
"sweetly hit. This is full, outside off and Sanga gets down with it and slices it through backward point"
"shortish and outside off, lets it come on and dabs it to deep third man"
picks the gap to the left of deep square leg. it's all in how he waits on the slower ball to arrive on his pads and then the roll of the wrists gives it enough power to race away. Top shot
"lovely shot, Malik spots the loopy legbreak, loves that it's attached with some width as well. Lays into a drive through point. Lazy fielding at deep point, Dwayne Smith puts (only) his foot down but it ain't enough"
drives to long-off
"tosses it up on leg stump, Sanga gets to it on the full and flicks to short midwicket"
gets inside the line of a flighted delivery on off stump and drives to cover
drifts down leg and Sanga works it to deep square leg.
drives to long-off to retain strike
"back of a length on middle, whips it to midwicket."
flicks a length ball on leg stump to long leg
"mistimes the pull. Goes after the short ball, but makes connection off the bottom part of the bat, the consequence of going through with the shot too early. A catch bobbles over to Misbah at midwicket. A fuming Sanga walks off"
"fuller delivery outside off, drives to cover"
"flies away to the backward square leg boundary. Short ball, only rising to his stomach, and a short-armed jab takes care of the rest"
"back of a length on off stump, works it away through square leg"
"tosses it up on off stump, drives down the ground to the left of the bowler"
"quicker and flatter outside off, Malik plays the late cut to short third man"
they are appealing for pad first and the finger goes up. Bopara asks his partner for check - which probably means he is not sure he's hit it - and then goes for <b>review</b>. It's the googly again. Bowled flatter and quicker and outside off. That makes Bopara shuffle across for a late cut and that means his front pad becomes prime target. Hits that first. Could the impact be outside off? It is. And Karachi probably have the first successful review in T20 cricket
"<B>dropped</b>. This is a good length ball, the normal legbreak, Bopara goes back to drive through the covers, gets an outside edge. A teeny-tiny deflection to the wicketkeeper Haddin, who can't keep hold of it"
"googly again, and he is in line for an lbw again. Waiting deep in his crease, hurrying into the a straight bat shot to save himself"
"flighted on off stump, works it through midwicket. Fine spell from the 18-year old legspinner. Picked a wicket with his first ball, troubled batsmen through his spell of 1 for 23"
"comes down the track, but he is deceived by the slower ball. Lovely from Watson, beats Bopara on the outside edge playing a horizontal bat shot"
reaches out to a full delivery outside off and slices it to deep third man
"full on off stump, works it to midwicket and pinches a single"
"full on middle, pushes it down to long-on"
"short ball on middle, Malik pulls it to long leg"
"belts a half-volley down the ground to the long-off boundary. There is a fielder there, but he is too square to be of any use this time"
"shortish and outside off, gives it a little touch, looking for the third man boundary, but Watson down there does well moving to his left"
"back of a length on off stump, works it through midwicket"
blocks with the open face and a good length ball from around the stumps is sent to deep third man
cramps him up with a short ball but Malik somehow manages to pull it to deep square leg
works it off his pads to long leg
"excellent shot. He doesn't have much room to work with, so makes some of his own and slaps a short ball on leg stump to deep cover"
"fantastic catch and it's Shadab again. Hurtles in from the long-on boundary, dives forward, sticks out both hands and takes the ball only inches off the ground. The umpires are checking on the legality of it, but the soft signal is out. So a slow length ball, that ideally should have been crashed out of the city, is mistimed rather badly. Replays indicate it's a clean grab, with his fingers under the ball as he rolls over"
"steps down the pitch, and nudges a shortish delivery on middle and leg to long leg"
"on the pads, flicks it behind square leg"
sees Pollard aiming to walk down and digs in a short ball. The umpires don't like the height on it though
pushes his hands at a good length ball outside off and finds a single at cover
"short ball, pulls it to deep square leg. Goes for a risky second run, and a fantastic, flat, hard through may just have caught him short. Superb work from Asif Ali."
"hangs back on off stump, set to heave if it it's full over the leg side. But with it being short, he cuts to deep third man"
"wallops a back of a length ball over the man at long-on. That's more like it. Raees digs it in, only makes it rise up to the stomach and Wasim hits it as hard as he could. That's it. Just a brutal swipe"
"that's well bowled. Nails the yorker on off stump and Wasim, having to slog every ball to get a good total for his team, can only dig it out"
"another full delivery on off stump, squeezes it out to long-off"
"full and outside off, Pollard looks for a big drive over long-off and comes up with a whole lot of nothing. The back of the hand slower ball dips under the bat swing"
"now the bouncer, on middle and leg, Pollard avoids it"
has to move out of the way of a leg-stump yorker and then flicks through to deep midwicket
"back of a length and outside off, belts it to mid-off"
"slots the wide yorker and Wasim is unable to do much with it. Looks for the glide behind point, but is beaten for pace"
"as hard as he tries to hit, the yorker on middle will only go as far as long-off"
"backs away, and though he gets the length to get under this time, he mistimes the pull to long-on"
"that's unlucky for Sami. Pings the blockhole on leg stump, but Wasim gets an inside edge which bursts through his legs and to the fine leg boundary"
"low full toss outside off, slices it to deep point"
"caught on the midwicket boundary. It's Asif Ali again, taking it brilliantly. His work though is set up by a slower ball from Raees, on off stump. Wasim goes for the slog and he hits it high rather than long. Asif gets under the steepler and calmly takes it. Some needle between the bowler and the outgoing batsman"
"two in two. Plants it full and outside off, Pollard drives it ever so elegantly to the fielder at long-off. Raees just stands and strokes his beard, like the schemer in an old-fashioned movie"
"oh, it could so easily have been a hat-trick. This is full, straight, looking for middle stump. But Amir defends with a straight bat"
"yorker on off stump, digs it out to extra cover"
"off stump knocked back. Spectacular yorker. Sohail is deep in his crease, hitting all across the line and his end is swift. Raees bails out of his followthrough, spreads his arms, looks down and soaks it all in"
slower ball wanders down the leg side and the umps punish him for that
"low full toss outside off, drives to extra cover for a single. Ends his spell, 4 for 25 from four overs"
"taken by mid-off running back. It's a low full toss - Sami going for the yorker - Mir looks to clear Raees inside the circle, but is unable to"
"low full toss outside off, carves it to deep cover"
"length ball outside off, he makes too much room as he slogs and ends up being beaten"
"middle stump lights up and Karachi have been bowled out inside their 20 overs. Yorker, thunders through the batsman's defences"
no feet as he pokes at a good length ball pitching on off stump and seaming past the outside edge
"back of a length and outside off, taps it to cover"
"goes wide of the crease for the inswinger, but the line is on leg stump, allowing Smith to flick to deep square leg"
plays it beautifully. Calmly waits for the overpitched ball to drift across him and then lashes it behind point
"moves around the wicket for a good length ball, and this time Asif is very late to come forward and meet it. Finds cover with his ill-timed drive"
blocks a shortish delivery on off stump
"back of a length on off stump, defends to cover"
"width on offer and Smith gets it up and over backward point. Stand and delivery stuff, and though it isn't perfectly well timed, with these short boundaries, it is enough"
"gets it to bouncer a bit more, and tightens the line on off stump as well. Blocks to cover"
tries to flick a good length ball that is speared into leg stump. Only manages an inside edge onto pad. Wanting in footwork
nudges a length ball through midwicket
works a fullish delivery on off stump past the left of midwicket
punches a back of a length delivery to cover
"in the slot on off stump, Smith heaves it over the midwicket. Probably could have hit it straighter"
"what a catch! Sanga flies. He simply flies to his right and takes a one-handed screamer. Smith goes for an on-the-up drive through cover, only offers a thick outside edge and after that - considering it is such a massive deflection - Sanga takes centre stage. Leaps to his right, takes it right on the webbing. Then he brings the left hand over to steady it on as he falls to the ground. Fantastic from the 39-year old"
"nice and tight on off stump, Haddin does well to get behind it"
hangs back to a short delivery outside off and chops it to point. Asif at the non-strikers' end thinks there is a single but he is sent back
"chops on! That's a double-wicket over. No room for the cut. The bounce is too much as well. Perhaps he should have gone up and over the slips. But instead he goes for the shot through point, gets an inside edge and onto middle"
"short ball outside off, short-arm pulls to deep midwicket"
"back of a length and outside off, pushes it towards cover"
"top work from Sanga again, after Asif is beaten all ends up by an indipper. The batsman is shaping to cut a ball that isn't really short enough. Jags in off the seam as well. Only just misses off stump and the wicketkeeper dives to his left and gets a glove to it"
works it through midwicket
"full on off stump, works it to the right of mid-on"
"shortish on off stump, he pats it down to mid-on"
"back of a length and outside off, serenely sends it down to third man"
"beats mid-on running back. This goes straight up with Asif looking to loft a ball on off stump without really getting on top of the bounce. Can't really be called a chance, Amir did everything he could to get under the ball, just isn't fast enough"
pulls to deep midwicket
"back of a length and outside off, glides it behind point"
"full and outside off, slugs it to mid-on. Very bottom-handed player"
"tips and runs to midwicket, and considering it's Gayle there, it's a sound plan"
mistimes a drive on the up to mid-off. Trying to hit the ball too hard
"picks up the short ball and pulls it all the way over deep square leg. Timely release for Asif, and the bowler has to be marked down for this. Bowls the length he can get under, and gives him the room to free the arms"
"back of a length on fourth stump, Asif is caught hopping as he defends. Inside edges it past the cut strip on the leg side"
gets in line with a shortish delivery outside off and dabs it right through Wasim at point. Misfield. He suggests the ball turned after bouncing in front of him
pummels it down the ground. That's the other length you can't bowl to a bottom-handed player: length with a tinge of width
"slower ball outside off, defends behind point"
"pushes it through on off stump, Misbah is able to flick it through midwicket. These sliders, that seem to race on after pitching, could make Wasim a tough bowler to face especially off the back foot"
"fuller delivery on off stump, drives to long-off"
"hammers it to the point boundary. Superb timing from the captain. Sees the bad ball - short and wide, and waits on it just that little extra to beat the fielder on the point boundary, on his left"
"drifts it down the leg side, Misbah flicks and misses. Sanga does well again behind the stumps, despite being blinded"
"shortish and outside off, cuts to point"
"tosses it up on off stump, drives to extra cover"
"full on middle, Misbah looms over it and flicks through square leg"
"shortish and outside off, cuts to deep cover"
"tosses it up on off stump, Asif lunges forward to block"
"<b>dropped</b> by Pollard at long-on. Comes running in from long-on, dives forward to try and get under the ball, and though he gets two hands to it, he spills it. Almost seems like he positions himself a little too far to the right of it. The ball didn't deserve a wicket - short and wide - and the mistimed pull shot threatened to give it one. Until Pollard intervened"
"full toss, flicks it through midwicket"
slices it through point
makes him reach with the square drive as he tosses the ball up and gets it to spin away outside off. Single through point
"through him! What a strike. And it's the Wasim special. The arm ball, holding it with only the forefinger, aimed at a good length and skidding on. Misbah plays away from his body, offering a big gap between bat and pad and pays for it"
tosses it up outside off and drives through to long-off
"length ball on off stump, he inside edges it back to the bowler"
nudges a length ball through midwicket
"into the pads, Watson misses the flick"
lobs it up on leg stump and it dips on Watson all of a sudden. Just manages to dig it out and the mischief maker Wasim sticks his tongue out. Thoroughly enjoying himself
"yanks a flighted delivery from outside off to deep midwicket. Slog sweep, a very awkward looking one, brings up the team's fifty"
thumps a short ball on off stump to the deep midwicket boundary. Dew affecting the leggie
"well bowled. It's flighted on middle, bringing the batsman forward. Watson is wary about hitting against the turn and so defends"
"full toss on off stump, smashes it down to long-off"
gets beside the nicely tossed up delivery on middle and drills it to cover
"short, wide, smashed, but there is protection in the deep. had he waited a little more, he could have found the boundary on Amir's left"
"flatter delivery outside off, drives to long-off"
flicks behind square leg as Wasim sneaks in that single-fingered arm ball again
works a quicker delivery on middle through to midwicket
"good length ball on off stump, defends, gets an inside edge towards midwicket and a misfield allows a single. Amir the culprit"
nudges a full delivery from outside off to deep backward square leg
"cleans him up! Karachi keep fighting. And Watson, coming forward to drive with a closed face, isn't there quick enough. The ball sneaks under his bat, hits the pad and then onto the stumps"
"sweeps past the man at short fine leg. Excellent stroke. He sees Gayle is the fielder there and he isn't the quickest movers. Didn't really have a chance in the first place, with Asif finding the gap to his left."
"tosses it up on off stump, works it through midwicket"
"shortish delivery outside off, cuts to deep point"
"goes for a sweep, misses, that's an extra"
"shifts his weight back, and to the leg side, to cut to point"
caught at cover. Couldn't have picked out the fielder better. Innocuous delivery. Almost a half-volley really. Could have smashed it. But instead he pops it to Bopara
"tosses it up on leg stump, whips it to long-on"
"pushes it through on leg stump, Pooran makes a conscious effort to block with a straight bat"
"massive appeal for lbw and it's been given. Wasim is running through them. Is Pooran going to review? He really should because this may go down leg. And finally, they go for the check. It's the pace again, beating the batsman, especially with him playing a cross-bat shot over midwicket. No bat. Ball-tracking says it clips leg stump and the umpire's call of out is upheld"
"fuller delivery outside off, defends"
"works it off middle with a flick, which is dangerous with Wasim skidding the ball through"
"tosses it up on leg stump, works it away to deep square leg"
"fuller delivery on middle, nudges it away towards long leg. Finishes an excellent spell, 3 for 18 while defending 126"
"looks to sweep, and Sanga goes up in appeal for some reason. He didn't catch the ball, so it's not for that. Length ball sliding down is called a wide"
"smacks a flatter, quicker delivery to deep point"
goes back and whips a short delivery to long leg
"that's gorgeous. The set batsman Asif tries to be a bit cheeky, going deep in his crease to try and late cut the ball, but he waits for too long. Basically guides the ball into the keeper's gloves, undone by a little more turn than he expects. Usama Mir sets off on a jaunt. Good work from Sanga too, to rise with the ball"
"appeal for lbw and Usama is certain about it. The umpire isn't so gives the benefit of the doubt to the batsman. Asks the review. This is a really full delivery on off stump, Sami comes forward to block, and he does so down the wrong line. The bat is beside the ball with him playing for turn. There isn't much, and because of that it hits pad first. This could be gone. Ball-tracking gives up all reds and Sami is outta here"
"tosses it up wide outside off, he lets it go"
"flatter delivery on middle, defends. That's the end of another top spell from a Karachi spinner, despite the palpable dew - 3 for 24"
"back of a length on off stump, blocks it"
"oh dear, this should be a run-out. Karachi have two cracks at it because Raees has slipped. The throw from cover misses. Then Raees, who has lost his bat, has to scramble on his knees to reach his ground on the second throw from midwicket"
smacks a back of a length ball on off stump to the long-on boundary
"misses the offcutter outside off, but it's a bit too far outside off says the umpire"
"plays all around the slower ball, it's back of the hand too, and the stumps are shattered. Just your average tail-ender hitting right across a striaght delivery"
"full and straight, and somehow Irfan keeps it out"
"full on off stump, defends"
"back of a length and outside off, he cuts and misses"
"taken by long-on running to his left and Karachi are through. The defending champions Islamabad crash out, failing to chase 127. Length ball, skews it over the top and once the catch is taken, Amir borrows Raees' wicket celebration. Just standing there, tipping his head to the side and folding his arms."
