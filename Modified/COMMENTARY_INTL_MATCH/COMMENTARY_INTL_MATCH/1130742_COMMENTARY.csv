"pitched up and slanting away outside off, Tamim presses forward, meets the pitch and push-drives through the vacant cover-point region"
"Lakmal finds late inswing and hits the front pad of Tamim. But it pitched outside the leg stump, and it was perhaps bouncing over the stumps too. The opener was struck above the knee-roll"
"back of a length on off, solidly blocked on the front foot"
"full and nipping away just a shade outside off, Tamim pushes away from the body and watches the ball<strong> skip past the outside edge</strong>"
"full and angling away wider outside off, Tamim shoulders arms"

"full on off, presses forward but does not meet the pitch, winds up squirting an inside edge to the midwicket region"
good length and angling into a forward-defensive to mid-on
"Loose, loose shot. Full and wide outside off - possibly on a sixth-stump line - Anamul simply throws his hands at the ball. He has a big swish at it and only manages to drag a thick inside edge back onto the stumps. The leg stump is tilted back. Anamul has a long stare at the bowler, he can't believe what he has done. He has bagged a six-ball duck. The search for a solid opening partner for Tamim continues"
"good length and angling away outside off, Shakib takes it on the up and drives it gloriously between the covers and mid-off. Chandimal chases the ball but dives gingerly and early, letting the ball roll away to the boundary"

"shortish and outside off, punched on the up to cover"
"<b>Danushka, you beauty</b>! He throws the stumps down from backward point at the striker's end but catch Shakib short. Huuuuuge wicket for Sri Lanka. This was even shorter and outside off, punched into the cover-point region. Danushka tears across to his left, swoops down on the ball and nails the stumps.Tamim called for the single, there was a brief hesitation between the wickets, and Shakib gave up in the end. Danushka is one of the best fielders in the SL side. Can't take him on"
"full and outside off, tapped into the covers"
"<strong>Another stunning piece of fielding from Danushka</strong>. His brilliance in the field has sent back both Shakib and Tamim. He throws himself to his right from backward point now, stretches out with both hands, and snaffles a catch. Credit to Lakmal too for banging it short just a shade outside off, surprising the batsman and forcing him to splice a catch. It actually reared up from a back of a length"
"Lakmal runs in hard, hits the deck harder, but this bouncer sails over the batsman and the leaping keeper. The ball rolls away to the boundary"

short and angling into a clip to square leg
"back of a length and angling in, blocked to point off the back foot"
"short and angling down leg, deflected off the thigh pad to fine leg"
<strong>Lakmal has bounced out Mahmudullah</strong>! There was only one man at the boundary on the leg side and the batsman has picked out Chameera at fine leg. This was a plan: dig it short and attack the body with assistance from leg-gully and fine leg. This chest-hunting ball rushes Mahmudullah into the hook and he holes out. Excellent bowling and excellent fielding to boot from Sri Lanka
"short and outside off, Sabbir ducks out of the way"
"lifting short ball on off, Sabbir rises with it and drops it to backward point"

"tossed up on off stump, Sabbir presses forward and drives the ball to short midwicket"
"<strong>skidder, shoots low</strong> on off stump, Sabbir keeps it out"

"good length again around off, 132 kph, kept out with a defensive block"
"full again around off, 130 kph, another block into the off side"
"drifts down leg, was there some glove on that? Yes, there was. <strong>It's a drop</strong>, it's poor from Dickwella. Strays on the leg stump, Rahim gets a bit of glove on his flick, the ball flies to his left, but Dickwella gets a bit of glove on that, and then it races away to fine leg."

"nicely played, a tad short and wide, Mushfiqur stays back and carves a cut fine, towards third man for a couple"
"on the pads again, swept nicely but straight to fine leg"
"a big appeal, no says the umpire. Flat, spinning down leg, Rahim misses a flick. Dickwella collects and appeals. Mushfiqur is not happy that wasn't called a wide."
"but he strikes ... Mushfiqur has something to say to Sabbir. That was an awful stroke at 57 for 4. A full delivery on middle and leg, the ball moves back in slightly, Sabbir runs down at the bowler and looks to smash him over mid-on but that inward movement takes it off the inside half and lobs to mid-on. What a chance for Sabbir, he has thrown it away."
"short and wide outside off, 125 kph, left alone. Why are Sri Lanka targetting new batsmen with short balls? Surely, the better option is to go full and open more options. And go short if it doesn't work?"
"full delivery around off, a thick inside edge towards square leg for a single"
"good length delivery around middle and leg, defended solidly."

"flat down leg, swept away to short fine leg, who runs to his left and parries the ball away towards square leg"
"two more, leg byes. Flat delivery outside off, the ball spins back in. Rahim, it seems, has got outside the line, but the ball rolls away towards fine leg for a couple of leg byes. <strong>Chandimal wants to review though</strong>. Doesn't look like there is bat, it spun back and hit him on the front leg in front of off. Was there too much turn? Actually, UltraEdge has a spike as it's passing the inside edge, so leg byes may have to be changed to runs."
"flat and wide, spinning in, chopped away towards deep point for a run"
"lovely hit through cover, 72 kph, lots of flight outside off from Sandakan, drilled through cover for a couple. Not a great over this this"
"a googly, off the pad, down to fine leg for a leg bye."
"wow, that's a well-directed bouncer, on middle. Climbs steeply on the batsman who plays it down somehow. Very awkward fend"
"127 kph, short and wide again, Abul goes after it, and gets a toe-end on the shot, races away past slip for four."
"128 kph and taken! So Sri Lanka continue to strike, but Abul Hasan reviews after speaking to Mushfiqur. He should have known. It's a full delivery outside off, the ball comes back in, takes the inside edge and carries through to Dickwella, who dives away to his right. That's an appalling review, you only get one in ODIs, and Mushfiqur or any other batsman can't review now if they get a shocker. A big spike on UltraEdge."
"good length on middle and leg, 130 kph, worked away into the leg side, to midwicket"
"a short, wide delivery outside off, close to a wide but not a wide."

"on the pads, 137 kph, nudged to midwicket"
"and gone! A slower delivery around off, the ball cuts back in, the offcutter, Mushfiqur slogs his wicket away now. Not very clever batting. Mushfiqur charges at Chameera, doesn't get to the pitch and whacks it away straight into the hands of short midwicket"
"leading edge but just wide of cover. Full delivery on middle and leg, he is quick through his flick, it lobs away but in front of cover"
"a short delivery on middle and leg, worked away wide of leg gully."
"wow, how do you get out to that? A short delivery drifts down leg, Nasir looks to swivel into a pull and hit it for six, but all he can do is get a bit of bat on that. Flies to Dickwella's left, and he takes it. Would have been wide, but he wanted a boundary. 80 for 8 now"
"nice and slow down leg, off the pad into the leg side. A big appeal but sliding down"
"a googly, short and wide outside off, goes too wide, called a wide"
"wow, a massive swing. Flight on middle and leg, Mortaza clears his front leg and looks to slog this away. But the ball turns back in, goes through a massive gap between bat and pad and hits leg stump. Not a terrible shot with the circumstances, but flawed execution"

"a googly down leg, a massive slog rolls away to fine leg"
"full and wide outside off, blocked"
"the slog sweep is taken at long-on! A googly outside off, Rubel clears his front leg and slogs the ball into the hands of long-on. Bangladesh are bowled out for 82, <strong>their ninth-lowest ODI total</strong>"
