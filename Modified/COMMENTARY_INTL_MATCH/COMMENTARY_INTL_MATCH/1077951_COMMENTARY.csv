"straightens his line, on off stump, Lewis is across the crease and flicks down to fine leg"
"touch of extra bounce from short of a length, takes the splice of the bat to the covers"
punched off the back foot towards mid-off and that's a well-judged single to Kamran Akmal
works a back-of-a-length delivery to midwicket...no great movement for Amir as yet
"comes round the wicket, on off stump, pushed to the on side and that's another good single"
"fuller, at off stump, back over the wicket to the left hander, pushed to mid-off"

"back of a length outside off, driven from the back foot to the left of mid-off"
"gets across the crease and plays a sweetly-timed flick through midwicket...has the fielder managed to flick this back? He reached the ball, but missed the first flick as he slid. Then tried to recover and has done it superbly in the end, keeping himself inside the rope. Good save by Hasan Ali"

"back over the wicket, full at middle and off, squeezed to midwicket"
"full outside off, driven sweetly but picks out cover"
"short of a length, and pulled to deep square leg! That's a bit of a giveaway...his eyes lit up at the short ball, he went for the pull but sent it straight to Hafeez who was in off the boundary a touch and took the catch very well above his head"
"over the wicket, back of a length, driven to mid-off"
"edged, through the gap! Sends this wide of a diving Sarfraz and there's just one wide slip in place. Was a wider, fuller delivery outside off, he chased it without footwork and sent the edge at catchable height where first slip would have been"

"over the wicket, on off stump, tucked to midwicket"
"full at off stump, defended back from where it came"
"that's an elegant shot, picks up a full ball angled at the stumps and flicks it over mid-on...goes one bounce for four"
"drags the length back, defended to midwicket"

pushed with a straight bat down to long-on

"spins down the leg side, an appeal for a catch but he was nowhere near that"
"back at off stump, defended to the leg side...innings hasn't quite gone into reverse, but West Indies going down the gears"
"<B>dropped</b>! And the pressure should have brought a wicket. Akmal spills a simple chance at mid-off. That's a bit village. Powell used his feet, drove in the air, and it was straight at him"

"tossed up on middle and off, blocked down into the leg side"
"flat on off stump, Hope goes back to defend"
pushed through a touch straighter and this is worked into a leg-side gap for one

"tossed up outside off, steps out and punches down the ground"
"flat on the stumps, Mohammed shows it a straight bat in defence"
"spins in, past the inside edge, rapped on the pad... Simon Fry shakes his head! Was it turning too much? Pakistan elect not to review, probably hit him in line but the angle was against the offspinner there"
full on the stumps and worked away through square leg for one more
"scudding through flat on the stumps, defended"
Mohammed hangs back in the crease and blocks to leg on off stump

"lands the legbreak, straightening on off stump, dabbed for one"
"floated up outside off and again, Hope comes forward and drives square"
short again from Shadab and Mohammed is back in the crease and pull one to long-on - expensive introduction from the leggie. But that's why they are a luxury item

gets on to the front foot and steers this one through the covers for a single

"flatter legbreak, Hope goes back outside off stump and clips through mid-on for one"
"gives it some air, Mohammed heaves up and over, inside out and they get a couple to the deep cover sweeper"

"length ball outside off, Mohammed steers square for another single"

"full and flighted, straightening on middle and leg, defended from deep in the crease"
"unleashes the full toss, swung down the ground for one to long-off"
"this is definitely the googly, spins inside the bat, thuds into the front pad... big appeal from Shadab but Simon Fry again shakes his head. This time Pakistan do <b>review</b> the not-out decision. Think it's going to be similar to the Hafeez one, hard to get everything lined up from this angle, with the ball spinning in... and yes, Hawk-Eye has it missing leg stump. So, as you were"
"ooh, nicely bowled again, a quicker legbreak and Hope swishes and misses on the back foot"
"in a tangle, Shadab pulling the strings now, slips in another googly and Hope falls over his front leg, playing across the line and hit on the pad... but outside the line this time and Shadab doesn't bother to appeal"
"tossed up on off stump, punched through the covers for one"
"length ball, driven into the covers coming forwards"

"fullish in the channel, driven without timing towards cover"
"good length, cushioned square and Mohammed declines the runs as backward point hares in"

"overpitched, drifting down the leg side and Hope only has to get a tickle on it to send the ball fine - that's his first four, from his 74th ball faced!"
tossed up and punched through the covers coming forwards
flighted and defended from the crease
"slightly short, Mohammed swats past the dive of Shadab and they scamper one as mid-off slides to cut it off"
"dragged down, Hope heaves into the leg side... but will only get one to deep midwicket on the bounce. Heyells in frustration that he didn't put that away for a boundary"
"pushes through the googly, down the leg side... Sarfraz collects and wasn't happy at the signal for wide. Did it brush the pads?"

"|Hope comes across to drive, bottom hand coming off the bat, gets one through cover"
"swung to leg, high into the Providence sky, Shoaib Malik is following it over his head at deep midwicket... takes the catch on the run but then treads on the boundary rope as it tries to toss it back in! Super effort but in the end he took it out of bounds with him. No one near to help out with a relay if he had managed to release in time"
comes across and steers one more into a gap

goes back in the crease and knocks into the leg side
"angled across outside off, opens the face and guides it wide of third man"
"almost drags this on, Amir round the wicket, he's reaching out away from his body"
"full outside off, drives forcefully and it skews down to third man who can't stop the second much to Sarfraz's annoyance (FYI: Akmal at third man)"
"this nips back, beats the inside edge, takes the thigh pad"

"full and straight, pushed back to the bowler"
tucked into midwicket
"length outside off, dabbed square to backward point"

"angled into the hip, flicked off his hip backward of square"
"round the wicket, short of a length outside off, and there's some Caribbean flourish - a hint of Gordon Greenidge as he plays a whip-pull off one leg, places it behind square. Lovely"
"this time there is fortune, but it's back-to-back boundaries, coming forward into a length delivery outside off and the inside edge shoots past leg stump to fine leg"
defended back to the bowler
"edged, caught behind! Back of a length outside off, he's aiming to run it down to third man, tickles the top edge and it's a simple chance"
almost another edge...Carter as a flat-footed waft at his first ball and nearly edges to the keeper
"good stuff, back of a length at 140kph, nips back and Carter is hurried into his defensive shot"
driven to cover
"not out of the middle, aiming an expansive drive over the off side and it skews off a thick edge over backward point"
"very full, gives himself a touch of room and drives to long-off"
"an appeal for lbw as this spins back from outside off, he was well across his crease...not a bad shout, actually"
"that's a big drag down and put away handsomely into the stands, rocks back and pulls over deep square leg"
"fuller again, on the pads, worked along the ground through midwicket"
"full outside off, a bottom-handed swing across the line and he doesn't make contact"
driven into the off side
"over the wicket, back of a length at off stump, neatly timed through straight midwicket...Sarfraz's volume goes up a few levels"

pushed back to the bowler
"his struggles continue, it's a big full toss which is swung over the leg-side boundary"
"short outside off, Carter rocks back and cuts through point, placed nicely as well...crowd getting into this"
"Shadab gets his revenge! Not much celebration. The ball is outside off, Carter goes for the slog sweep and it spins considerably to go under the bat and into middle stump"
beaten! A lovely legspinner which Holder drives at...a slip in place
"and again...two in two. Pitches on off stump, dips and spins away, beats Holder's outside edge"
"three strikes, but Holder is not out...another perfect leggie to end the over. Pitching around middle and off, spinning past the edge"
gets across the crease and works from outside off to square leg
"back of a length outside off, angled to third man"
fantastic stroke! A back-of-a-length delivery which he picks up very early and pulls well in front of square
"full outside off, driven to deep cover...better to be full than short"
worked from outside off to midwicket
"short of a length, this time it's a slower ball, doesn't come out of the middle as he pulls and it loops wide of short fine leg"
the captain unleashes...strides down the pitch and drives handsomely straight down the ground. Into the second or third tier
"flatter, shorter, pushed to cover"
cut off the stumps to point
"taken at long-on...now Hope tries to go straight down the ground, comes from low down off the bat, doesn't have anywhere near the distance of Holder's shot and the fielder comfortably settles under it"
can't find the gap in the off side
"fuller, he uses his bottom hand to work down the ground to long-on"
beats him with a low full toss outside off at 138kph
"full at off stump, from round the wicket, pushed back to the bowler"
"huge appeal for lbw, Junaid is pleading, it's very full and straight, Holder playing across it. Sarfraz did well to cut it off while appealing"
"aims for the off-stump yorker, can only drive towards long-off"
"low full toss, driven through the covers and wide of the sweeper"
"good delivery, full at off stump, squeezed out to cover but a wasteful throw from Hafeez gives away a second"
"over the wicket, full and straight, driven down the ground"
"terrific yorker, at middle and leg, jabbed to the off side"
"finds deep midwicket...misses his yorker but a fraction, Holder gets underneath it but doesn't quite have the placement or power. Shadab makes good ground and holds it nonchalantly"
"a slower short ball, angled across Nurse who is through his shot early"
"fired in at the pads, pitches outside leg, doesn't make contact and it's another dot ball"
"uses his feet, comes down outside leg stump, makes it into a full toss and clubs to long-on"
"full outside off, driven to cover on the edge of the ring"
"super stuff, a perfect yorker from round the wicket, jabbed back to the bowler"
"uses his feet this time, carves over cover, but it's just a single to the sweeper"
"sweetly struck, it's in the air past Junaid but went very quickly...long-on is able to get round"
"a slower short ball outside off, completely defeats Permaul and it's called wide...perhaps a little harsh"
"back full at off stump, angled square through the off side, good placement...a bit more shouting from Sarfraz when there might have been a run out chance if he was by the stumps"
"does quite get the yorker in this time, flicked in the air over midwicket"
"done again with a slower ball, back of a length, which he tries to swing through the leg side"
worked down the ground to long-on
"dug out down the ground again, they sprint back for the second"
"finds cover. He aims to swing this down the ground, only gets height (and a lot of it) and it's a simple catch for Hafeez coming around inside the circle"
"short of a length, clothed down the ground"
"and a run out to finish...uses his feet, the ball rolls back to the bowler who sees the non-striker is miles out of his crease and walks up the stumps to break them"
"pitched up, Kamran closes the face to play to leg... and gets a leading edge to cover! He's gone for a golden duck and West Indies are among the wickets straight away! Perfect start defending a small(ish) total, Gabriel strikes - though perhaps not the wisest shot selection when you haven't seen how the pitch is playing"
gets into line and defends
"slides this down the leg side, Hope doesn't take it cleanly - called wide"
"short of a length, 138kph around fourth-fifth stump, Babar drops it down softly towards his feet"
banged in and Babar again lines it up to block into the off side
"short and a touch wide, goes back to cut but gets a bottom edge towards backward point"
"beats him for pace this time, back of a length in the channel, Babar throws the hands through a cut but misses"
"lovely seam position, puts it on a length and it zips through outside off as Shehzad drops back and shoulders arms"
"tight line, this time he shows it a straight bat in defence"
"maybe a touch fuller, 134kph/82mph and pushed towards mid-on cautiously, half-forward"
"length ball on off, Shehzad comes forward like a Roman auxiliary behind his shield and blocks"
"in the channel, good carry for Holder, touch of shape away from the right-hander, who leaves"
"angled in towards the batsman, 136kph/84mph and tucked into the leg side, no run there - maiden to begin with for Holder"
"length ball, 142kph/88mph on middle and off, Babar moves across and turns the ball towards square leg, no real timing in the shot"
"Gabriel marauds to the crease and hammers a shortish length just outside off, defended on the back foot"
"touch short, driven into the covers off the back foot, slight misfield in the covers... and Babar and Shehzad have run straight into one another! Such was the force of the impact that Shehzad's helmet popped off his head, but he was able to stay on his feet and hobble into the crease at the striker's end as the throw came in. Lucky the collision didn't cost them - kids, that is not how you take a single"
pitched up and driven along the carpet towards mid-on
"<b>dropped!</b> Full, 145kph/90mph, Shehzad completely miscues and the ball lollipops towards mid-on... where Walton drops it diving forwards! He made up the ground to his left, seemed to get both hands to the ball, but shelled it. Gabriel is understandably not amused"
"length ball, angled in on the stumps, clipped through backward square leg for a couple"
"goes back and opens the face for one to third man, Holder concedes his first run"
length ball but it's sliding down the leg side
"shortish outside off, Shehzad jabs it towards backward point on the back foot"
"pitched up on middle and off, clipped neatly back down the ground for one"
"dabbed down into the off side and Carter comes racing in, not quite the full Jonty but he launches into an underarm throw, narrowly off target - but I think Shehzad was in"
comes across and pushes into the covers
"full on off stump, struck firmly back down the pitch but Holder sticks out a hand to stop it as Babar leaps to regain his ground"
"slightly short of a length, outside off and Babar drives with his hands away from his body, gets an inside edge"
"play and a miss, good heat from Gabriel, slightly wobbly seam but it ducks back in and fizzes past the edge"
"lovely timing, driven coming forwards and he threads it between extra cover and mid-off, evading two desperate dives and running away for the first boundary of the Pakistan innings"
"tighter line from Gabriel, 135kph/84mph and Babar shows it a straight bat"
"full, again Gabriel touches 90mph but this is wide, room for Babar to free the arms and he clumps the ball past backward point for another boundary"
"pitched up, in the channel and mistimed into the covers coming forwards"
"WHADDACATCH! Shehzad's time is up, he resorts to aggression, too close to cut, really, and the edge flashed late to Hope's right but the keeper threw himself sideways and grasped it low down with one hand - another ones bites the dust!"
"and Holder greets him with a bouncer, followed by a few choice words. Hello Hafeez!"
"back of a length on the stumps, turned to the leg side"
shortish and once again worked off the body to leg
"length, top of off stump, 128kph/80mph and Hafeez lines it up to block"
gets off the mark with a leg glance fine for one
"full-length ball, just outside off, draws Hafeez into the drive - and a thick inside edge flies </i>just</i> past leg stump! It'll go for four but that's a moral victory for Gabriel... Not that you can do much with those"
shuffles on to the front foot and defends this time
"angled in a little straighter, Hafeez turns it down into the leg side"
"pitched up on off, 141kph/88mph and driven without much timing towards mid-off, they make it home as the throw comes in"
"length ball in the channel, Gabriel still pushing the speed gun up towards 90mph, slashed down to third man via a thick outside edge"
"pitched up and stroked through the covers, classical stylings from Hafeez although it won't quite bring four as the ball is reeled in a few yards from the rope"
"in the channel, climbing through off a length, no stroke offered"
"good length, slightly too straight and Hafeez clips one out to deep square leg"
"lovely stroke, as if he could hear Muzzammil's words in his hears, slightly full and straight from Holder and Babar whips it away wide of mid-on to the fence. Slick"
"moves across and taps down into the off side, early call of 'No!'"
"back of a length outside off, leaves this one to fly through to the keeper"
"dug in short, only 133kph/82mph but Babar isn't interested and swiftly ducks it"
"short ball and it sits up for Hafeez to swat over square leg in controlled fashion, not enough pace in the pitch for that line of attack"
"good length outside off, dabbed into the covers moving across"
"touch shorter, 139kph/87mph and it's softly dropped into the covers for a single, good strike rotation"
"bowled him! Babar plays on, leg stump is pegged back and Gabriel slaps the turf in elation... That's a huge wicket for West Indies and Pakistan are in the doodoo now. Maybe nipped back at him, Babar rather wafted at it, left a big gap and it ricocheted into the woodwork"
"full, angling in, nicely timed back down the ground but mid-on cuts it off"
"short, 142kph over the stumps, Malik hops back and blocks down into the leg side, they pinch a single to get him off the mark"
"fullish around middle and off, pushed back down the ground, fine of mid-on for a single"

"full and straight, 135mph/83mph, clipped through backward square leg for a single"
"good length in the channel, veering back in late as Malik leaves"
short and wide and that is slotted through wide of third man on the cut
touch back of a length and tapped down into the off side
"fullish and Hafeez reaches forward, gets a thick low edge down to third man"
"back of a length, Malik raises his hands in the air to allow the ball through outside off"
"fuller, 140kph/87mph around off stump, blocked towards mid-on"
"length ball in the channel, tailing back in but not enough to make Malik play"
"full outside off, Malik jabs down on it and steers into the covers"
"slightly full, pushed in front of point, Hafeez goes barreling off down the pitch but Malik sends him back - there's a chance for a run out here but the throw misses! Bishoo was the fielder from cover, only had one-and-a-half stumps to aim at but he was off target and Hafeez can pick himself up from the dust and continue"
"filthy loosener from the leggie, a half-tracker outside off that Hafeez adroitly thumps down the ground, couple of bounces to long-on"
"full, that's a better delivery, patted away defensively"
"oof, that's spun, ragging away past the outside edge with Hafeez in no-man's land"
"floated up full on off stump, pushed back down the track"
"flighted and spinning away once more, takes the edge... but it dies short of slip!"
floated up on the stumps and worked into a gap
"full and dipping down the leg side, Hafeez goes to sweep - did it flick the pad? Hope collects but not called wide"

tossed up and worked back down the ground for one

"flat, straightening outside off and stays a touch low, Malik miscues into the off side"
"a fraction short outside off, allows Hafeez to play off the back foot. He cuts to point"
"this time he finds the gap, playing with a straighter bat this time, opens the face and places it wide of backward point. Lovely use of the wrists...ah, he was help by some spin off the outfield, too"
"prods forward, plays to cover"
lovely ball! This spins sharply past the outside edge. There's a small query about a stumping and it's being checked but the foot remains behind the line
"full at off stump, defended on the front foot"
"stretches well forward, bat in front of pad as he defends"
appeal for lbw as he misses a sweep at a very full delivery...they decide against the review. Was there a bottom edge involved? Perhaps leg-side. Replay shows would have bounced over leg stump
"plays back, opens the face to point"
"tries to cut, too close to that, almost over off stump and the bounce beats the top edge"
"this keeps a touch low, was quite short, but he watches it close as he goes back and flat-bats towards mid-on"
"wider outside off, he stretches for it and doesn't get any timing"

"width outside off, he deftly opens the face and runs it square through the off side"
tapped square to the off side
"too short, again, and it's put away square of the wicket, this time with more of a square drive than a cut"
"much better, but the slip has come out...full on middle and off, spins, takes the outside edge and runs towards third man. May not have carried to a slip, but that's the problem with the loose stuff. Captain loses confidence"
"straight, on a length, worked to midwicket"
"sharp spin! Rips in from outside off, takes the bottom edge into the pad. Actually, no edge at all. Front pad first. Was smashing all three!"
"wider outside off, he cuts and misses"
"waits a fraction longer, dabs a full delivery to short third man"
"plays forward, pushed square to the off side"
"more sharp spin, he's playing back, that's dangerous, not far from dragging this on. Very good first over"
another play and miss from the cut shot
"full at off stump, leans forward and pushes to cover"
gets right across outside off and plays a strong sweep through square leg...excellent use of the crease

pushed towards cover
"short outside off, Bishoo is supported by his point fielder who manages to parry the cut shot"

"spins in from outside off, takes the pad as he comes forward, well outside the line for the lbw appeal"
"touch short, he has time to rock back and place it through the covers"
"angled in at leg stump, clipped to square leg"
"a short ball, dispatched through midwicket with a strong pull and that takes him to an excellent half century from 58 balls"
"on a length outside off, chopped down to third man...registered as 91mph"
"comes forward, pushed with an open face to backward point who makes a sharp save"
"oh dear, he's overstepped, the ball is worked to midwicket...he's often pushing the line. Yes, a big no-ball"
"and he takes full advantage! Went back and across, deep in the crease, and picked up a full-length delivery - short of a yorker - and drilled it over long-on. Top strike"
"back of a length, pushed to point"
"and now he pulls through square, this is dragged down, he swivels nicely and confidently puts it away"
"this one goes in the air, working a full ball to the leg side, hint of leading edge but safely over midwicket"
"wide outside off, defended"
"slower through the air, tapped to leg"
goes back to a shorter ball and back cuts fine of shirt third man...more deft touch
pushed into the off side...that's all they need to do
big appeal for lbw as he gets across his crease and misses the sweep. Given not out by Simon Fry. They go for the <b>review</b>. Has it hit him in line? Umpire's call on impact and where it's hitting

"full at middle and leg, another sweep shot and this one runs quickly behind square area...didn't seem to quite come out of the middle, but whistled to the rope"

"full at off stump, 136kph, defended"

"full outside off, pushed to the covers, the running not convincing and Malik is sent back"
