"short of a length at the stumps, backs away and cuts straight to point"
"slower short ball, slammed in at an off stump line. Creates room by walking into the leg side and looks to pull this. Can only slice to midwicket's left"
<b>top edge falls safely</b> in the square leg region. Bouncer gets steep as he looks to hook and takes his eyes off the ball. Was looking to check that shot or even evade by the time it got up in his face
short of a length and rising into the body. Mistimed pull towards deep midwicket
"short and just outside off, pulled into the turf towards deep square"

short and in at the ribs. Gets on top of this and drops it behind square with soft hands

"short of a length and just outside off, makes room and swats it down to long-on"
"<b>guided straight to the keeper it seems.</b> But he reviews after being given caught behind. Short of a length and climbing up outside off. He looks to run it down to third man as it angles back into him off the pitch. <b>There is a tiny spike as the ball passes outside edge.</b> Sri Lanka will lose the batsman and the review. It's a faint edge, he probably didn't feel it. But that's a fair decision and he's gone"
<b>past the edge.</b> Length ball pushed across the corridor. Hangs the bat out at it and can't make connection

"<b>launched over deep backward square!</b> Overpitched and on the pads. At his pace, the batsman need only get connection on the whip. And he does"

"full and just outside off, mistimed drive along the floor to long-off"

"full slower ball on off stump, makes some room and clubs this to sweeper cover"
<b>smokes it over long-on!</b> Wow! Richardson looks for the slower ball but drops it short. It sits nicely up at off stump and Malinga just lines up beside it and flat-bats it
full at the stumps. Makes room and drives to extra cover's right
