"punched firmly, but straight to point, who is quite close in"
"quick out of the hand at 141km/h, but even quicker off the bat! Avishka just stood up on a rising cross-seamed delivery and forced it away backward of point. This pitch looks a belter"
"<b>caught by Shamsi at mid on!</b> Steyn pulled his length back and despite the slow track, Tharanga found himself in an awkward position as he tried to pull, splicing the ball straight up.

"Ngidi keeps it tight on off stump, Mendis defending"
"left alone outside off, and there some howls of excitement from behind the stumps as the ball seams sharply in. It looked close, but with the bounce Ngidi is finding, he was safe"
"goodness me, Steyn hurls one down the leg side and the ball bounces well in front of de Kock, slipping through his gloves"
"closer to off stump this time, and he's forward to defend"
"a touch of extra vim in this one at 139km/h, and it's left alone outside off"

"rising outside off, and he's guided down to third man"

"a touch straighter, and he's tucked square"
"worked off the hip, Phehlukwayo stopping it close to square leg"

"<b>caught off a short-arm jab!</b> Nortje pulled his length back a little, Avishka was rushed into a pull, and the ball is spliced straight to short midwicket"
"<b>and he's gone first ball!</b> Nortje gets a delivery to burst off a length down the leg side, the ball kissing the gloves as Primayal tries to glance and de Kock diving to catch it. <b>Primayal's out to his first ball in international cricket, and Nortje's on a hat-trick</b>"
"well, his hat-trick ball is short again, and rising over leg stump as Kamindu ducks under it"

Kusal is up on his toes to guide a back of a length delivery down to third man and turn the strike over
"flicked off the pads, but straight to midwicket"

"and he's forward again, driving this time but finding mid on"
"Phehlukwayo tests Kusal with a short one, but he's equal to it and rolls his wrists on a pull to get the ball out to deep square"
