"<b>chops it on!</b> More nerves from Zimbabwe! Only one batsman has looked assured today, but he's at the non-strikers end as Roach angles another one into a tight line outside off. It's a forward defence ball for Taylor if he isn't batting in the 10th over with two wickets down. But the stride is short, the intent to play is half-baked and the result is disastrous for Zimbabwe.

West Indies review. Masakadza walks as soon as they do....<b>but he has over-stepped!</b> Oh dear. It was such a good bouncer, climbing at an off stump.

It was actually there for the big slog sweep, but like Williamson yesterday, the ball just spins away and takes the top edge. Dowrich runs towards short leg and takes a simple catch. A legspinner always <strong>puts more revolutions on the ball</strong>, which makes sweeping a dangerous option."

flighted on off stump. Powell comes aggressively forward and cracks his drive to the man at deep mid-off.
"<b>Dropped</b>! Brendan Taylor, what's happened there? Bishoo telegraphed his slog-sweep and Cremer pushed the ball out wider.

"<strong>big shout for lbw from Raza</strong>, umpire Simon Fry does not budge. Cremer chooses to challenge the on-field not-out decision. Tossed outside off and breaks back in to beat the inside edge and ping Hope on the back pad. There's a spike on UltraEdge, but it comes from the bat hitting the ground.

turns this with the spin to backward square leg
"attempts a full-blooded reverse sweep past point but misses it completely as the ball spins back in just a bit more than he expects.  The ball hits him on the roll of the pad, looks to be in line. The only question is if it may have missed the stumps. Relays suggest the impact was just in line and will stay as umpire's call. Ball tracking shows this may have just clipped leg. Lucky for Zimbabwe that it was given out on the field. They continue to chip away, this partnership was slowly beginning to turn the scales for West Indies. This is brewing quite nicely"

He changed his angle, coming around the wicket, and Hope played inside the full delivery, expecting more spin than there was. The ball zipped straight on, rattling the off stump.

"he's forward this time, and driving at a floated delivery outside off.

Pushed through flatter and quicker on off from around the wicket, Holder plays back to it and is pinged on the pads. Oh dear, the tracker returns three reds. There wasn't any inside edge either.

reduce the 122-run deficit by four. This is a gentle half-volley outside off and Masakadza blasts this through extra cover. No fear whatsoever. So what if there's just 25 minutes left for lunch. Emphatic start

"short of length outside off, watched through to the keeper again"
gets a good stride forward and bunts this full-length delivery to short cover
uppish but into the gap between cover and mid-off. Authoritative from Mire

He goes from wide of the crease and lands this length ball around the fifth stump, lands this on the seam and gets it to jag back in a long, long way. Masakadza attempts to leave but is shocked to hear the ball rattle into the stumps. Body blow for Zimbabwe early in their second innings."

"oh, dear. I don't know what Mire was thinking. This is a length ball that angles back in from wide of the crease, Mire looks to pull off the frontfoot but the ball zipped past his stroke to hig him on the right thigh. Since this kept a touch low, it was pretty adjacent and would've crashed into the stumps. <b> A pull shot against an express bowler to a not-so-short delivery with lunch just a few minutes away? Very poor. </b> Zimbabwe end a shocker of a session with another blow in their bid to wipe out the deficit."
"a loose one to start off, full and wide outside off. Stays low as the ball goes through to the keeper"

"full on middle and leg, angles down the leg side even before Ervine could decide what shot he wanted to play"
"Big appeal for lbw from Roach, not out says the umpire. They're going up for the <b>review.</b> It was full on off and the batsman came forward to defend, and in real-time it seemed like it was bat-pad. Replays, however, suggest it was pad first. Impact is outside off, and despite the ball hitting middle, it's not out. They lose a review."

"back of a length on middle, cramps him slightly but manages to punch off the back foot"

"back of length delivery on middle, defended solidly"
"slower length ball outside off, Taylor hops across and defends"

Taylor knew he was a dead duck and so didn't even bother reviewing that. Zimbabwe in some trouble now."
