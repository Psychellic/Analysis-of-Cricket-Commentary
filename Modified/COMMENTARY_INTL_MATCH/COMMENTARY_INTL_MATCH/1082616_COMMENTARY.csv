"starts with a loopy, low full toss, which Vohra drives to long-off"
"offers a touch of width and that's more than enough for one of the best batsmen in the world. Amla holds his shape, gets to the pitch of the half-volley and caresses it past the left of the cover fielder"
"immediately the next ball is flatter and quicker, Amla taps it to long-off"
"flighted delivery on off stump, eased to long-off"
"good work, as he stops a single by diving to his right in his followthrough. Happy to keep flighting the ball, Agarwal."
"the variation goes wrong. Wants to finish the over without too much damage, so he goes for the flatter, quicker delivery. Only thing is it's short and wide. Amla picks the length so early, rocks back and cuts it past point"
"there for the drive and Vohra times it superbly. Lovely high elbow, good stride forward, the only thing missing is the placement. Hits straight to cover"
"great bowling, and what a super catch from Karthik behind the stumps. This is a Test match length, which does not allow Vohra the clarity about what he needs to do with his feet. Should I go forward, or back? And by the time he can decide, the ball is on him, having seamed away off the pitch. Vohra has to play, and for that trouble, he gets an outside edge that is excellently pouched by Karthik diving to his right"
"full and wide outside off, Marsh flashes and misses"
"lovely timing, off a mis-hit. Marsh is drawn into playing away from his body by a wide half-volley. And yet it beats the two points running after it and even the deep third man running to his left."
"that's more like it. Brings out the straight bat, puts in all his power. The only reason this isn't a four to long-on is because Nathu got down to it in time and deflected it to mid-on"
"dabs it to point and since it is just enough to the right of the fielder, they take him on. Jadeja gets in a direct hit at the keeper's end, but Amla is well in"
"shortish and outside off, chops it towards cover point"
"pushes it through on middle and leg, Marsh clears his front leg and punches it to mid-on"
comes down the track and drives a good length ball to cover
"fires this in short, presuming Marsh would come down, and he does. Flick to deep midwicket"
"spears it past cove's right. Makes this shot with his footwork. This is a short, quick, delivery. But it is turning back into middle stump. Amla though has planted himself outside leg stump and uses a straight bat to pick the gap. Glorious"
nudges a stump-to-stump ball towards square leg
"searches for the top of off stump, Amla guards it with his life, and a straight bat"
stands up tall to get on top of the bounce of a shortish delivery outside off and punches it to point
back of a length slower ball outside off gets a delicate dab to third man
"shortish on middle and leg, perfect for the backfoot nurdle through square leg"
"oh, he's turned on. Fine leg is inside the circle and Nathu is preferring to bowl shortish deliveries on off stump. Those are good balls, but in this format they have to go. So Amla walks across, looking to lift him, using all that pace, over the fielder inside the circle. Mistimes it. But good plan"
"full on middle and off, drives to mid-off"
"back of a length and outside off, Amla drills it to mid-on"
"the shortish length is okay, but that he has tied it with width outside off stump, width that Marsh can use to free his arms, that's bad. Pulls it through midwicket"
"goes full and straight, Marsh can only keep it out"
"on the pads, hits the pads, with Marsh just a tad beaten for pace. Pinches a leg bye"
"walks across outside off, but he is unable to do much with the back of a length delivery. Inside edge onto pad wanders towards midwicket"
"super shot, because he picks the shortish length so early. Rocks back and nails the cut behind point"
"lovely from Amla. Runs down, gets a well-improvised short ball outside off. But Amla slaps a flat-batted swat over the bowler's head. Not great timing, but enough"
"may have been the knuckle ball. Slower ball on leg, Amla misses his flick into the leg side. Struck on the body"
"full and wide, a knuckle ball. Of all the places to bowl. Amla opens up his bat face and carves a cut behind point. Delectable stroke-making"
"good length outside off, chopped towards short third man."
"not great timing again, but carries the distance. Another shortish delivery on middle and leg, Amla stays in his crease and slaps a pull. Gets just enough to clear long-on."
"a slower delivery outside off, punched on the up to cover. Good stroke"
"full and wide outside off, hit to cover"
"comes down, looks to hit the ball too hard. Isn't in good shape, flicked to deep midwicket"
"flat and quick on middle, defended. Nice lines these"
"too straight this time, flicked through square leg for a run"
"flat delivery outside off, some bounce. Marsh misses a cut. Karthik didn't expect Marsh to miss the cut. A bye as he fumbles"
"ooh, lucky. Flat down leg, swept to short fine leg. Amla should have put that away"
"tosses it up nice and wide outside off, but makes it dip just enough so that when Marsh goes for the cover drive, he can only find the fielder"
"excellent footwork. Charges the rookie, gets to the pitch of the flighted delivery and launches it over his own head"
"clear plans to take on the debutant. Advances again, and even though Agarwal throws it wide, to beat the outside edge, Marsh is able to reach out, get his head over the ball and time the drive to the right of cover"
stays back and nudges it off his hips to midwicket
"gets some drift into the right-hander, and then turn off the pitch. Amla has to wait a bit, on the front foot, before he can punch it to long-off"
"shimmies down again, Agarwal expects it, Marsh expects Agarwal expecting it and simply ticks it to deep square leg to snag a couple"
hangs back to a flatter delivery outside off and cuts to point
"round-arms this flatter delivery just outside off, and the higher pace messes with Amla's timing. Winds up for the cut, but off that big backlift, it takes time to bring the bat down. Mistimed through cover"
reaches out to a flighted delivery and drives through cover
"the only ball Jadeja tosses up... Phew, you have to be so switched on to play like this. Amla comes forward and lifts it handsomely over extra cover. Carries all the way, off little more than the extension of a defence"
"fires it into the pads, Amla goes for the flick, gets just enough bat to beat short fine leg on his right"
works it away to deep midwicket and that takes us to the time out
"walks outside off to enable him to take a good length ball from outside off and bunt it into square leg. No bat, just a leg bye"
"slower ball does him in! Marsh relies on his timing, his touch and Tye knows that better than most having played for the same franchise for years. Goes for the knuckle ball, Marsh doesn't pick it, goes for the flick and finds himself meeting the ball way too early. He looks up horrified as the ball loops over to midwicket for the easiest catch"
gets off the mark straightaway with a nudge off his hips - and the ball only got there because Maxi moves across his crease
"back of a length and outside off, Amla deflects it to third man on the boundary"
"<b>run-out chance</b> but it needed a direct hit. Nathu Singh is the man at short fine leg, brought into the game by a flick from Maxwell. He looks for the single, but Amla is not sure. Both batsmen are just staring at each other in the middle of the crease as the ball zips past the stumps at the keeper's end"
"slanting into the pads, and all Amla has to do is bring those sublime wrists he has into play. Leg glance, too fine for short fine leg, and that means he has his second fifty-plus score in two games"
"loopy delivery outside off, Maxi reaches on the half-volley and nails it to cover"
"oh, tripe bowling. Too short. Too rank. Maxi rocks back and pulls monstrously to deep midwicket, and were it not for the quickness of Jadeja, moving to his left, it would have been four"
hangs back and cracks it through cover
"gets down low, looks for the reverse swat, but he misses it altogether and is struck on the hip. Might have been too high for the lbw shot"
"now goes for the switch hit, but this tossed up delivery - the flight is probably why he went for the shot - dips on him quickly and denies him leverage"
"low full toss on off stump, bunts it to long-on"
"no, no, no, you can't allow Maxwell to get under the ball. He picks th e short delivery so early, rocks back, swivels on the back foot and launches it over midwicket"
"full and curling into leg stump, Maxwell stands still, brings his powerful bottom hand into play and slugs it to long-on"
"fullish on off stump, Amla dialls up the drive, but even he wouldn't have predicted he would get four. Mostly because McCullum is the fielder there, but this time he falls well below his usual standards. Lets the ball through his legs, not bending low enough"
"loopy slower ball, which Amla reads just in time. He had set up for the sweep, delays his shot just enough to pinch a single to short fine leg"
"goes full and outside off, Maxi, leaning back, drags it away to midwicket"
"offcutter, easily picked, but since it lands in the blockhole, Amla can only dig it out"
"for the longest time, he is not sure what shot to play, because the quicker, flatter delivery pitches on leg stump. Normally he would flick, but this one turns. So credit to Maxi to waiting on it and then nudging it straighter to long-on"
works it to deep midwicket
"cuts a flatter delivery, angled down leg stump, to deep point. How has he done that? by making rook outside leg"
"excellent shot. As flat and at the stumps as Jadeja is bowling, Amla clears his front leg and lets loose"
"fires it onto the top of middle, but Amla hangs back, lets it come on and dabs it to short third man. Should have only been a single, but that fielder concedes overthrows"
"ooh, mistimed pull. Jadeja drops his pace right down for this ball, and gets some assistance from the pitch as well. The ball holds up. Amla is already set up for the pull and has to delay his swing. Inside edged single to square leg."
"tosses it up, makes it drift into leg stump, Amla digs it out to long-on"
"in the slot and Maxi never needs an invitation. He turns good balls into sixes, not to mention slow, loopy, overpitched legspinners. Launched over the sightscreen"
faster delivery - at 94 kph - and wide outside off. Maxwell goes for the slap and inside edges it to the bowler
"rushes at the rookie, taking full toll of his nervousness, and for his trouble he gets a thigh-high full toss. Smashed over deep midwicket"
drags a flighted delivery from outside off to long-on
"first IPL wicket for Agarwal and it comes off some special catching. The ball comes back at him, hard, and low. But he's ready to take it. A quicker delivery becomes a short one but it still brings Lions some luck"
"excellent batting. He sees fine leg up, plants his front foot across, outside off, and lap sweeps a flatter delivery, using all its pace to his advantage"
"looks for the reverse sweep, but though the length is there for it, to get under the ball and power it away, the pace is too quick. Struck on the front thigh, but he is bending down to hit the shot and is in line with middle stump."
"pushes it through on off stump, Axar blocks"
"drives through cover, off the back foot"
"good length ball on off stump, Stoinis goes back and pushes it down to long-on"
"round-arms a flat delivery into middle, Axar pushes it to long-on."
"shortish on leg stump at 131 kph, Axar blocks"
"full on leg stump this time, but a lot slower. Axar reads the change in pace and works it to deep square leg"
rolls on his back foot to pull a short and wide delivery to deep square leg
"knuckle ball, he pitches it short and it climbs awkwardly on Axar. The surprised batsman just about dabs it to short third man"
"goes for the yorker, Stoinis digs it out, Tye thinks it comes off the inside edge, onto boot and goes chasing after a catch, moving to his right and leaping with one hand outstretched. No luck"
"smashed down the ground. This is full pace, it is length and to wrap up the trifecta, it is also wide outside off. Axar gets the room to swing his arms and finds a boundary to long-off"
"sticks in the yorker on off stump, the best Stoinis can do is protect his wicket"
"juicy full toss outside off, all the swinging room a power-hitter can hope for, but Stoinis smashes it straight to cover"
"low full toss on leg stump, Stoinis whips it to deep square leg"
"loopy, slow yorker outside off. Axar leaves it. The ball pitches inside the wide line, but the angle takes it past and the umpire calls it wide. Tough call"
this is why bowlers are scared to go for the blockhole. Misses his length by the slightest of an inch and Axar is able to belt it between the stumps and the non-striker
"slower ball, on middle, Axar is into the slog a bit too early and gets an inside edge to deep midwicket"
"picks the slower, good lenght ball, Axar, and he flicks it through to deep midwicket"
"shortish delivery, holds up in the pitch, making Axar hold his shape a little longer as he tries to block towards point. It's that deceptive knuckle ball again"
"full on middle, Stoinis reilies on his timing, basically only bringing his bat down in line with the ball, and it scorches the turf on its way towards the straight boundary. If not for a dive from Finch, running to his left from long-on, that would have been four"
nudges it off his pads to deep square leg
"knuckle ball on leg stump, Axar goes for the flick, unaware of the danger. The ball pops up but there is no one up inside the circle at midwicket to take the catch"
"beautifully done. Stoinis is looking for big hits. So deny him the pace. The knuckle ball from Tye, hitting a good length, fooling the batsman into thinking this could he hit out of the park. Stoinis takes the bat, he mistimes it to long-off"
"shortish and outside off, and it's slow as well. Axar is prepared to pull, but has to delay his shot"
you can't give the part-timer such pressure overs but Lions had little choice. The offcutter is pitched on a length on leg stump and Axar gets under it to lift it over deep midwicket
"another slower ball outside off, this one at top pace, and even that goes against Smith because Axar swings, gets an outside edge and it flies past the right of short third man"
"moves around the wicket, goes slower ball again, but Axar is waiting for these. He is not being deceived by these. He's in fact loving the change to get under the ball. Launches a massive six over long-on, into the second tier"
"good running catch by Finch at long-on. Axar fancies taking on a short ball, just outside off stump, and he could well have got himself a boundary if not for the long-on fielder's calmness under pressure. Moves to his left quickly, sticks out both hands just far enough and makes a touch grab look easy"
"full and wide outside off, carves it to deep cover"
"yorker on off stump, Saha digs it out to cover and pinches a single"
"gets his yorker to swing in to Saha, who is making room outside leg stump. Single, dug out to long-off"
"yorker on off stump, Mohit is able to spear it to deep cover for a couple"
"low full toss on middle and leg, Mohit pops it over to the sweeper cover"
"full toss on leg stump, heaves it to deep midwicket"
"finally gets hold of the full toss. Brave of Thampi to keep looking for the yorker, but it's a very tough delivery to pull off under pressure. Saha is camped deep in his crease and belts it over long-on"
"nails the yorker this time, Saha digs it out, the ball doesn't even go past the cut strip, but they look for a single. Thampi fields it himself, runs back to the stumps at his end and runs Saha out"
"wow, what a start. Back of a length inswinger outside off, McCullum opens the face of the bat and guides the ball behind point for four. Perfectly played. Not overhit."
"and again. Manan gets around from deep point this time. Short and wide, scythed behind point for a couple. Don't keep bowling there"
"wrong shot selection. Good length outside off, well outside off. McCullum chooses a pull and the ball goes past. A cut the better choice"
"well bowled. Keeps it straight, accurate, no room, not short. Defended back"
"a wide yorker. Well not quite a yorker, but a very overpitched delivery that is bunted to cover"
"McCullum misses a full toss! A low full toss, straight. The worst ball of the over. McCullum just plain misses his flick. Struck in front of off. Absolutely plumb. Gets away with a not-so-great over does Sandeep"
"back of a length and outside off, Finch punches to short cover"
"just lobs over Marsh at mid-off. Another dreadful shot from a Lions opener, but this time it was a better ball. Back of a length, close enough to off stump to make people wonder why an international opener would be pulling that. Skews off the outside edge, and there's just enough wood on it to save him"
"length ball on middle, Finch flicks it to deep square leg"
keeps Raina to a dot with a shortish delivery on off stump
"that's well played. Realised he didn't need to do much with Mohit straying onto his pads. Just had to make sure his leg glance beat short fine leg. And it does, easily to Cariappa's left"
he's got his timing working. Gets back and across to a shortish delivery outside off and just dabs the ball past backward point
hammered to the wide long-on boundary. Raina turns bully. Takes a perfect delivery for Test match cricket - on a good length on off stump - and pummels it off the front foot
"they have long-off back to Raina, which ends up useful now as he belts another good length ball between the stumps and the non-striker"
"backs away, Sandeep follows him with a shortish delivery. Finch does his best to power it away, but finds cover. But wait, that's not the end of the action. Raina thinks there is a run here, gets halfway down before he is sent back. Stoinis gets a direct hit, but the Lions captain makes it"
gets up on his toes to whip a back of a length delivery to the right of long-on
he is in some form. And because of that he is only seeing gaps. There is one between backward point and short third man and Raina slots a low full toss - aka a misdirected yorker from around the wicket - in there by just getting down low and opening the face
"once he sees length, and some width though, he becomes brutal. Hammers it past the bowler to long-off"
"back of a length and outside off, steers it to deep point"
"tucks him up with a short delivery on middle, Finch is just able to pull to deep square leg"
"full on middle and leg, mistimes the flick to midwicket"
"such sweet timing. Sure, this is asking to be sliced to deep point, but Raina does it so well that the sweeper has a lot of work to do running to his right"
"short and wide outside off, Raina tries to slice it to the third man boundary, but Sandeep is in the way"
"he has climbed into that. There is very little wrong with the ball - good length on off stump, angling across the right-hander - but Finch is such a good hitter of the ball straight down the ground. Lofts it over long-off"
"magnificent shot through midwicket. He beats the man inside the circle on his left, but also makes sure it has enough power to beat the deep fielder on his right"
jumps back and outside leg to cut a flatter delivery on the stumps to extra cover
cut to point
"tosses it up on off stump, drives to long-off"
"gets the carrom ball working. Finch doesn't pick it as he stands still in his crease, wanting the ball to turn into him so he could lift it over mid-off. Ends up beaten"
"another one turning away from the right-hander, Finch this time expects it, and punches to cover"
"starts with a slow, wide yorker outside off. Raina gets low and drills it to deep point"
"back of a length, right over middle, FInch backs away and smacks it to cover point"
"back of a length and angled into leg stump, Finch backs away and punches to mid-off. There is no one backing up Marsh's throw and Lions pinch a second"
"Stoinis thinks he has the catch, but both he and the umpires are looking for confirmation. Soft signal is out and it appears the be clean. Excellent work, first from the bowler Mohit, who sees Finch backing away and immediately bowls wide and full. The batsman reaches out to drive and gets it off the toe end. Then it was all up to Stoinis, who moves to his left, dives low and, to me, he has his hands under the ball. Tons of replays are being used. Tons of time is being taken and Finch thinks he might get lucky and goes back to taking his guard. In the end, the right call is made"
"lovely hit, because he picks the slower ball, holds his shape that bit longer and then pulls the ball close to his body. That gives him all the power he needs to beat short fine leg on his left"
"shortish and outside off, he tries to hit it too hard, is on the front foot as well, so the lack of timing is expected. Dot to cover"
"good length, spinning away from Raina, who smacks it to deep cover"
"pitches the carrom ball full on middle, Karthik is right behind it"
"tosses it up on leg stump, works it between deep midwicket and long-on"
"hangs back and pushes a good lenght ball to the left of long-off. Good batting on the heels of a wicket. Not letting dots build, but not losing their heads either"
"and when the bad ball comes... The length is short, and it comes off slowly off the pitch, allowing DK all the time he needs to rock back and nail it through extra cover"
leans over the flighted delivery on middle and nudges it through midwicket
"short on off stump, Karthik pulls to deep square leg"
"back of a length on off stump, and he goes for the drive on the up. Mis-hit towards midwicket"
"slower ball outside off, Karthik reads it and so delays his drive to make better connection. Single to long-off"
"slower, short ball, outside off. Raina loves width, but his timing is shot because of the lack of pace. Cuts to cover point"
"another slower ball, coming into the left-hander on off stump, Raina taps it towards short third man"
"full and outside off, comes down the track and drills it to long-off"
"there really is no margin for looseners in this format. First ball in, he betrays a little rustiness, with a short delivery on middle, and it's been belted to the square leg boundary"
picks it away off the pads through square leg
"flatter delivery on middle, Raina goes back, uses a straight bat because it isn't quite short for the cross-bat, finds a single between long-on and deep midwicket"
"lets the good length ball come on and tucks it, softly, behind square leg"
"round-arms it outside off, he's bowling over the wicket to the left-hander, by the way, Raina pats it to point"
"excellent work by Maxwell, first in placing himself at a hot spot - deep midwicket for Raina - and then pulling off a fine catch right on the edge of the boundary. He positions himself as far back as he could, has his eyes on the ball all the way, realises he has to jump, times that perfectly, and comes away with the ball in hand, and stops just short of the rope. Excellent balance. So a short ball has possibly turned the game. The gun batsman backs himself to clear the man in the deep, but his timing is just a shade short of what it needs to be"
"good length ball on off stump, turns it to the right of long-on"
"lovely timing on the late cut, specifically designed to beat the backward point fielder on his left. Good work from deep third man running to his right"
drifts down the leg side as Karthik flicks and misses
"drives on the up, fluently, through to the sweeper on the off side"
"back of a length and outside off, pats it to point. Needless throw results in an overthrow. Maxi the culprit this time"
"reads the slower ball so early, and is helped by the fact it is short as well. Swivels on the back foot and pulls it powerfully to the backward square boundary"
"the ball doesn't even leave the batting crease as Karthik is surprised by a quick, shortish delivery climbing up on him. Jadeja, though, knows the single is on offer and races through"
"slows it down, pitches it on a good length on off stump and gets it to turn away from the right-hander. Karthik gets a single, pushing towards point"
"continues over the wicket to the left-hander, looking to cramp him. Jadeja is able to tuck it towards fine leg"
"this is the quicker one, off a round-arm action. It's pitched full, but the trajectory makes DK push back therefore he has to hurry into a block"
"now back to those slow deliveries on a good length on off stump, DK finds a single at cover"
"offers with to Jadeja, and he takes full toll. Hangs back and carves it to the left of cover point"
nudges a good length ball off his pads towards midwicket.
"tosses it up on off stump, pats the full toss down to long-on"
"fullish on off stump, but Jadeja still hangs back and manages to chop it towards cover. MIller is the man subbing there. Takes his eyes off the ball as he prepares to throw"
"carrom ball, flat and outside off, Karthik reads it, jumps back in his crease to cut to deep point"
"carrom ball again, full on middle, Karthik stays back and as a result he can only block"
"super work at short fine leg. This is four for all money, as Karthik goes for a sweep, and connects so well. But the fielder dives to his left and saves three"
"leading edge, and Cariappa takes the catch himself, diving forward. The around the wicket angle from the offspinner - and the fact that he is bowling flat and quick, not really trying to turn the ball - makes Jadeja close the face of the bat a bit too early. This time, though, the ball holds in the pitch and deviates from the straight. Cariappa sees the mis-hit, realises he has an opportunity and dives forward to take a good, low chance"
"shortish and outside off, Karthik rocks back to cut to the left of the sweeper"
"comes down the pitch, Axar bowls flat in response, single towards deep midwicket"
"good length ball on middle, Smith is drawn forward, but from there he has nowhere to go because Axar is bowling slow. Defends"
"poor work from the man at long leg. Cariappa does all the good work, running to his right, as quickly as he can to hunt down the sweep. But he slides too late and gets caught in the turf. The ball goes through him"
"good length ball, blocks"
"has he got all of this? No. Smith's holed out to long-off. This seemed like the ball that could get the batsman going. Slow, loopy, almost overpitched. The loft over long-off is a logical option, but there is a man there, a good fielder, Stoinis. Smith backs himself to clear him, but his power fails him this time"
"does not pick the very straight, very full carrom ball, plays all across it and is trapped plumb in front. Nath, in his first match of the season, under immense pressure, backfires"
"beats him on the outside edge, or so says umpire Anil Chaudhary. Cariappa goes for the trusted carrom ball, against the new batsman, Andrew Tye. The batsman goes for an on the up drive, playing inside the line, expecting the ball to come in. A very good hat-trick ball doesn't get the wicket"
leading edge as Tye plays the for the flighted ball to come into him again. Falls short of the short third man fielder
"the mis-hit from the proper batsman now, and it lobs over the bowler's head. Leading edges, leading edges everywhere"
comes down the track and belts it through to deep midwicket
drives it through to the sweeper cover
"flatter delivery on off stump, whips it to deep midwicket"
"third man is up, and the cut from Tye has decent pace. Natarajan does well to catch up with it"
launches it over deep midwicket. Gets a length delivery on middle and leg and mauls it.
"goes cross-bat against another flat delivery on middle, single to deep square leg"
backs away and cuts a good length ball from off stump to deep cover
"gets enough on a flat, quick length ball, sliding down leg and that flies away to the fine leg boundary. Timely lap sweep"
"short and slow outside off, but that's in accordance with his field. He has a deep point and the cut shot finds that man"
"nails the yorker, and it dips under Tye's bat as he flicks to strike him low on the pad. Impact outside off. Good call from the umpire"
"another slower, short ball, Karthik tries the leg side now, but there's deep midwicket policing the boundary. Good bowling"
"the yorker, with some tail into the right-hander, Tye, with a drive to long-off, gets a couple"
"slower, short ball outside off, Tye goes straight now, but long-on keeps it to a single. The lack of pace means batsmen can't whack it away even if the length is short"
"cuts to the right of the sweeper, holding his shape against a slower ball. Even after all that good work, the batsman gets only two"
"starts with a full toss outside leg, and it's perfect for a batsman like Karthik, who is an excellent sweeper. Gets the shot past short fine leg's left and it whistles away"
"looks yorker again, and though he misses his length, the line is loads better. On off stump, and DK, looking to slog, gets an inside edge to long-on"
"goes slower ball bouncer, and Tye gets a top edge over the keeper. That's a bit unlucky. He had done the batsman looking for the big hit in and yet.."
"goes back to the yorker and topples middle stump. No need to be funky if you can nail this ball. And it even reverse swings into the right-hander, looking to heave it over long-on. Tye misses, Sandeep hits"
"low full toss just outside off, bunts it to long-on"
"he's switch hit an almost yorker to the third man boundary. What an innings, that's his fifty. This is such a high risk shot, but he guesses this ball will be near the blockhole, and that gives him a leg up."
"angles it across the right-hander, who is making room outside leg. Thampi swings and misses. DK comes up to talk to him now. Thampi needs to get a single"
"he goes for the wide yorker, but it slithers the other side of the wide line. Thampi is again, backing to leg and is left swinging wildly"
"full delivery on off stump, Thampi slogs and gets an inside edge to deep square leg"
"looks for the full, wide yorker, as his field asks him to. DK preemts that too, moving across outside off. But it is just too wide for him to do much about. Reaches out for it and clonks to cover"
"hits the yorker outside off, Thampi gets an outside edge, Saha dives to his right but isn't able to hold on"
"full and outside off, Karthik, now batting outside off stump because the line of attack is wide, launches it over to deep cover"
this becomes a full toss as it passes the wide line outside off. Thampi leaves and collects the extra
"full and wide outside off, Thampi tries to pierce the gap at cover, but misses. Good tactics. Tailenders can't hit the cover drives as well as they can muscle slogs"
"that's harsh. Karthik moves right across off stump, his back leg is right over the wide line as he leaves the ball. The back of a length slower ball. And umpire Erasmus calls it a wide. That's just unfair"
"goes full, on fifth stump, Karthik drives it back where it came from"
"back of the hand slower ball again, and though Karthik does pick it, under pressure to score big, he is beaten. Goes for the slog over wide long-on, against the turn of the ball, because he has to"
"full, slow, and wide outside off, Karthik waits on it and slams it between the sweeper and long-off. That's about the best a batsman can do to balls like these, and hope his timing is good. This time, it isn't"
"offcutter, pitches short, and into the body. Karthik misses out on the pull. Under pressure, he doesn't hold his shape for long enough"
"another slower ball, back of the hand, to the tail-ender. Good plan. Thampi slogs across the line, and misses wildly. Karthik pinches a bye"
finishes the over with his top pace and its a dot too. Karthik tries a late cut but is beaten
"inside edge to the fine leg boundary. This is a yorker, reversing into Thampi. He goes for a whip through midwicket and gets lucky"
"short delivery on off stump, Thampi walks down to it and pulls between deep square leg and deep midwicket. Miller, the substitute, racing to his right, puts in the dive and saves a boundary."
"full and just outside off, Thampi swings it over to deep midwicket"
"slower short ball down leg, Karthik pulls to long leg"
yorker just outside off. All that can be done to that is a chop towards cover
there it is. Yorker zips past Karthik outside off and Kings XI have finally defended a total this season
