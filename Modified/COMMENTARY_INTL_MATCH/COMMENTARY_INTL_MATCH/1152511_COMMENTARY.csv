"slashed away first ball, no sighter for McCullum, offered up a short, wide delivery and he goes up and over backward point. Nice start!"
"<b>but he's gone second ball!</b> Blimey, what a start...McCullum charges down the pitch this time, has a mighty swing, it comes off the toe end, goes straight up in the air and is a simple catch. Sensible approach?"
"the first ball for Bryant, speared full into the pads, misses his attempted flick"
"back of a length outside off, sliced over the gully area down to third man"
"short, top edged, another boundary...giving himself a touch of room to the leg side, has a cross-batted swipe, flies straight back over the keeper"
"this is fuller, heaved over straight midwicket, long-on is able to get across...play yourself in, folks"
"full at the stumps, pushes forward"
"that's a terrific drive, goes very full at the stumps, stays leg side of the ball and treads it between cover and mid-off"

"good length at the stumps, 141kph, pushed towards mid-on"
"a shorter delivery, good pace, outside off and beats the top edge as he looks to cut"

"moves to the leg side again, this time sends it straight down the ground, swinging through the line of a back-of-a-length delivery"
"sliced over short third man! Lynn is flying...stays leg-side of the ball, doesn't move around as much this time, the ball is just outside off and he's full control of the back-cut"
"that's a very short bouncer, Lynn sways out of the way"
"well bowled, a leg-stump yorker at 151kph which he jabs out to the leg side"
"good length, straight, and he brings a defensive push from Lynn...that's a victory"
"full outside leg, follows him, clipped along the ground through midwicket"

"this is terrific from Siddle, gets the leg-stump yorker in, all Lynn can do is get the bat down on it"
"low full toss, straight, clubbed back past Siddle towards mid-on"
"full and straight, Lynn gets away a powerful sweep shot which goes over square leg. Brave start from Lynn"

"dragged down a fraction short, and it's <b>miles back over deep square leg</b> as Lynn gets the pull off the middle of the bat"
"back of a length at off stump, angled down to third man"
"<B>huge moment!</b> Siddle strikes...Lynn came down the pitch, was a back-of-a-length delivery, Siddle angled the ball into him which meant he couldn't get the leverage he wanted. Simple catch for long-on"
"full, angled in the pads, they abort the lbw appeal"
"full outside off, and that's just a classic cover drive, no slogging about that. Textbook, foot to the pitch, driving through the line"
"full again, outside off, driven nicely again but finds cover this time"
"back of a length at off stump, defended...more excellent stuff from Siddle"
"short of a length, a googly, tapped towards slip"
"a short delivery, no timing in the shot as he pulls to long-on"
"an appeal for lbw as he misses his slog sweep, taken on the back leg. Maybe the bounce saved him"
"<B>another huge appeal</b> for lbw as he again misses a sweep at a googly, he's certainly not picking him. Did it do too much? Very close"
"on the pads, clipped to short fine leg"

"short, angled into the body, he's through his shot and gets a glove to the leg side"

gets right across outside off and works it to deep square
"<B>dropped</b> at long-on...round the wicket, he uses his feet, lofts it in the air between long-on and deep midwicket, Lehmann runs around and grasses it. Not a dolly, but they are normally taken"
"<B>but gone this time!</b> Held back nicely from Short, Bryant comes down the pitch, doesn't get to the pitch and it takes a leading edge into the off side"

"another short one, he's through the pull early, clips the helmet through to the keeper"

"round the wicket, swept backward of square"

"<b>is this run out?</b> They are all over the shop...a length ball on off stump, dabbed to short third man, he brings out the dive and Pattinson <i>just</i> makes his ground. <b>Oh goodness, he's given this out!</b> Has the third umpire pressed the wrong button? Drama here...the bat was slide in with the back of it on the ground, rather than the flat front side, so does the third umpire think there wasn't anything grounded? Bizarre scenes at the Gabba. The umpires are chatting. Ricky Ponting calls it a '100%' wrong decision if this has, indeed, been given out. Pattinson hasn't walked off yet. Confusion everywhere. <B>And now Pattinson walks off</b> Boos ring around the Gabba. Big controversy here. <B>Now Pattinson is coming back out</b>. He will carry on batting. Astonishing scenes"
