"a nice gentle start, full and swinging away, Guptill gets forward and defends. A little bit of swing."
"looking for the single, won't get it. Full and straight from Bhuvneshwar, driven away towards mid-off, past the bowler's left. Kohli dives and stops the run."
"comes charging down, and sends the ball over square leg for four. A good option from Guptill. Full and straight, the ball swinging in, flicked away over square leg for four. Wanted to hit the ball in the air from the outset"
"full and straight again, driven right back to the bowler, who fields and returns a throw to the keeper"
"good change in length, around off, on a length, defended into the off side"
strays down leg for a leg side wide. Started that too straight
"a decent end to the over. Digs this in short outside off, Guptill watches it carefully and sways out of the way"
"not a great start. Shortish and wide outside off, a hint of width, but Munro lays into a cut and finds the gap behind short point. Not a bad ball, but at this level, the batsmen are superb"
"the slower ball, offcutter down leg, Munro comes charging at him and flicks to deep square leg."
"good length delivery around off, some seam movement back in. Good line. Punched into the off side. Stay there"
"nailed! That's what Guptill will do. On a length around off, Guptill gives himself some room and bludgeons a straight drive, past the bowler."
"a low full toss, looking for the yorker, flicked away to midwicket."
"a good end, slower delivery outside off, dabbed towards point for a tip and run single."
"fine bowling, at his field. Full and straight, defended to mid-off"
"a slower ball that did not cut, full on middle and leg, skewed away into the off side, towards cover. The knuckleball"
"trying to bowl that defensive line,  but this one strays down leg for a wide."
"clattered to Kohli at mid-off. Full and straight, Guptill backs away and smashes a drive to mid-off. Kohli picks up and hurls a throw at the bowler's end where Munro was racing back."
"another slower delivery, this is good defensive bowling. Guptill wants to go, hit straight over the infield. But another well-executed slower ball on middle, defended into the off side for one"
"excellent change in length. Hasan Ali does this very very well. Digs the bouncer in on middle, Munro gets underneath"
"superb shot. It's another bouncer on leg, Munro watches the ball till as late as he can and pulls past square leg. Dhawan at long leg runs to his right but can't haul it in. Super quick outfield."
"movement? Not a good ball, although the TV commentators think differently. Short and wide outside off, right in Guptill's hitting arc, but somehow he manages to get the ball to seam away. Which made it a good ball, I suppose. But can't depend on seam, you can on swing"
"a full toss on middle, which catches Guptill by surprise, bunted back to the bowler"
"fullish outside off, driven to cover for one."
"good length around middle and leg, skewed into the midwicket region. The fact that New Zealand are trying to attack, but are just not able to get it away says how good this bowling has been"
"and again. Munro looks to open up the off side by clearing his front leg but it's a well delivered slower ball on leg. All Munro can do is defend into the off side for one, well batted too"
"a low full toss on leg, driven to long-on for one. Terrific over"
"flight on middle, all parties want to see if some spin is there, driven back to the bowler"
"too full mate. Can't bowl there. Overpitched on middle and leg, Guptill takes one stride forward and lifts the ball. With his power, more than enough even with bad timing, but there is good timing"
"interesting bowling. This is attacking bowling in the Powerplay, which is not what India were doing in the previous few overs. Lots of flight on middle, driven over mid-on. Not good bowling"
"my gosh, that has gone a 1000 metres back. Lots of flight on middle and leg, Guptill stays low, and slog sweeps the leather off the ball. Way over midwicket. Too much flight"
"flat outside off, defended into the off side for another good, tight single"
"the googly outside off, pushed into the off side. Better length off that last ball. But a poor first four deliveries from Chahal, especially if the plan was to be defensive"
"shortish length around off, Guptill comes charging down but fails to make contact. Well bowled."
"superb again, bowls this short on middle and leg after seeing Guptill backing away. Cramps him up for room. Pushed towards extra cover for one"
"good length delivery outside off, outside-edged towards Siraj at short third man, who nervously fumbles. No damage done"
"sliding down. Full on leg, that angle taking the ball down. Guptill misses a flick and India query, more than appeal. One leg bye"
"that's in the gap. Shortish around off, Munro arches his back and nails a cut past point, past backward point. Superbly played"
"shortish outside off, Munro under-edges this towards the keeper. Good end from Bumrah, a good over"
"still some flight, but there are more men out now. Full on middle, driven back. 'Duur wala acha hain,' says Dhoni (the farther one is good)"
"quick down leg, swept down to short fine leg. Bad line, gets away with it."
"loads of flight but very wide outside off, good line with that trajectory, swept away to deep midwicket"
"flight again but wide outside off, heeding Dhoni's advice, drilled down to long-off."
"pushed through, quick around middle and leg, punched to midwicket. Can he finish well?"
"the switch hit, Munro plays that shot very well, a very productive area for him, the quick one and straight, hit away to deep point or deep square leg"
"an appeal, but definitely not out. Short and slow down leg, Munro misses a flick, off the pad towards the keeper"
"a bouncer on leg, pulled down to fine leg for one. Good bowling"
"a full toss on off, drilled with a straight bat to long-off, 136 kph from Siraj"
"picks the slower ball and deposits it over the boundary at long-on. Lovely batting. Sees the slower offcutter on off early, Munro nails a lofted drive right back over his head"
"well-executed yorker down leg, the quick delivery, Munro very late on it. Gets some bat and some boot on it down to fine leg for two"
"another slower ball, smashed for six. Maaaaasssssive. A predictable slower ball on leg, Munro stays in his crease and hammers the ball over midwicket. Superb timing"
"excellent start from Axar, short and slow and straight, Guptill defends into the off side"
"slightly short and wide outside off, carved through the off side for a couple, past point"
"full around off, Guptill wants one through cover  but the ball slides on, hit back to the bowler"
"looking for the big slog sweep, quick down leg, clipped to deep midwicket. 'Bhaaago,' (run, to the deep midwicket fielder) goes Dhoni"
"another big heave, but Axar got that underneath Munro's slog, full down leg, hit to deep midwicket"
"good end, fires this in on middle and off, Guptill stays back and hits the ball back to the bowler"
"short and wide, too wide, slashed to the deep point fielder for one"
"quick and straight, fired in around off, driven back to the bowler. Better defensive bowling"
"another big six. Some flight down leg, Guptill comes running at Chahal, gets underneath that and slog sweeps the  ball way over midwicket. Six more"
"short and wide, lots of width, slashed to the deep cover fielder."
"terrific shot again, short and wide, nailed past cover. The fielder runs across and cuts the ball in, Dhawan the fielder"
"good stop from Bhuvi, saved five. Short down leg, Munro goes back and pulls over midwicket. Bhuvneshwar sets himself up for the catch, sees he can't catch the ball without going over the boundary so just taps the ball back in, with no intention to catch as he falls over the boundary. Good stuff"
""
"quick on the pads, a fine flick towards fine leg for one"
"there's five extras. Full and well down leg, Munro misses a flick, Dhoni misses too, and there are five runs"
"full outside off, Munro winds up and swings, one to deep midwicket"
"full outside off, driven to long-on off the inside half"
"six more. Quick and straight, Munro gets underneath the length and swats the ball easily over midwicket for six. Too easy"
"<strong>dropped</strong>! Shreyas Iyer pushes the ball over the boundary. And that's Munro's fifty. Short around off, Munro stays back and pulls towards long-on. Iyer is aware of the boundary behind him and lets that get in his head, doesn't use the few inches behind him and palms it over"
"short and very wide outside off, left alone. Wide called"
"gone! The same way Chahal got him in the first match, Pandya again but a much easier catch. Lots of flight on middle, Guptill wanted to go more over long-on, instead of long-off, and so the ball skews off the outside half, instead of a straight bat. The ball goes up and Pandya runs in to take a simple catch"
"the switch hit again, fired in wide outside off. Munro fails to make contact"
"very wide outside off, but just inside the tramline, maybe not. Wide says the umpire."
"the googly around middle, worked to deep midwicket"
"not out says the umpire. <strong>But Kohli reviews right away</strong>. Flight around middle and off, Williamson misses a paddle sweep, the ball lobs off the arm and into Dhoni's hands. Is there a nick as the ball passes bat? It definitely hit the arm, but there seems to be a tiny tiny spike on UltraEdge. No, thinks the third umpire. Guess there was too much doubt. But <b>why did the umpires not check for the lbw if there was no edge?</b> If there was no bat, then surely they should have checked for lbw?"
"flight around off, driven back"
"<strong>terrible throw from Rohit</strong>. Had so much more time that he thought. Full around off, driven to cover. Hesitation between Williamson and Munro. Munro finally decides to go, it's too late. Rohit side-arms a throw very wide of the keeper. Dhoni dives to his right and tries to palm it back towards the stumps. Unsuccessful"
"short around off, punched to long-on"
"full and slow down leg, swept down to short fine leg"
"quick and straight, flicked to deep midwicket"
"how did he get so much power behind that? Not good bowling, right in the slot, full down leg, heaved away well over midwicket for six. Too easy"
"short around off, punched to long-on"
"lovely batting. Short around off, sits up for Williamson to stay low and lay into a pull. Picks the gap perfectly at deep midwicket"
"shortish outside off, carved towards point for one"
"keeps a touch low, short around off, pulled down to fine leg for one"
"his bottom hand has some exceptional power in that. It's a low full toss around off, Munro gets underneath that and just lifts the ball back, sooo much power, four past long-off"
"better delivery, Change in pace, the short offcutter outside off, goes past the outside edge"
"a low full toss outside off, driven to wide long-off for a couple. Nice running from Williamson, forced Munro back."
"can even hear myself think now. A short slow offcutter down leg, Munro watches the ball right onto his heave. Lots more elevation than distance, but with pulled-in boundaries, it doesn't really matter, does it? Just over deep midwicket"
"four more. This is touch batting, not power. Full and wide outside off, Williamson knows exactly which is his boundary option and executes, gets underneath the delivery and lifts the ball over cover"
"<strong>Siraj's maiden international wicket</strong>, that of Williamson, he'll take that. Full down leg, a poor ball I must say. Williamson flicks uppishly towards square leg, but doesn't get enough power behind that, Rohit runs to his left, and takes a reverse-cupped catch by his shoulder. A stronger player and that would have been six."
"a low full toss around middle, punched away to long-on"
"full outside off, driven neatly to long-off to open his account"
"take that Eoin Morgan, or Nat Sciver. The non-intended nutmeg right through his legs. Clearly beaten for pace, but he improvises really well. The yorker down leg, Munro somehow gets some bat on it, through his legs, to the fine leg boundary. French cut."
"and the wild slog to end, a slower ball around off, Munro's big heave results in an under-edge towards point"
"<b>dropped by Chahal</b>. Can't do that India. Full and wide outside off, stabbed in the air at deep cover. Chahal runs back, gets right there and the ball bursts out of Chahal's hands. India's fielding struggling under pressure."
"good length down leg, worked away towards deep square leg"
"not a bad option, it's a productive area and he is tiring so behind the wicket works. A slower wide yorker, Munro makes no contact"
"nicely placed. A slower wide delivery outside off, Munro backs away, looks to carve the ball over cover but gets a thick outside edge which is right down second slip's throat. Don't think second slip is there at this stage"
"good length around off, Munro backs away and the ball hits the pad towards square leg. An appeal, not much chance. A leg bye"
"bat, pad, NZ don't care. On the pads, Bruce gets pad on that, the ball races away past short fine leg. Poor line, wanted to cramp him up but the margins are sooooo fine in this format."
"just over long-on. A 118 kph slower delivery around off, Munro watches the ball onto his bat and lifts the ball over long-on. The ball skews off the outside half, not timed very well. But even Kohli can't haul it in. <b>Into the 90s</b>"
"well bowled, quick on the pads, flicked towards square leg for a couple. Munro races back"
"just strays down leg. Off the pad towards the keeper but the umpire calls it a wide. Why can't teams review these? I know India don't have one, but if they did ..."
driven away to long-off. Just struggling for timing
"nicely played, welcome to T20 cricket. This is not really a shot India play, apart from maybe Rohit.. But the rest of the world does. Full around middle and leg, Bruce stays low and scoops the ball over the keeper for four. The Buttler or AB way."
"well bowled, on a length around off, chopped towards point for one"
"well finished, full down leg, flicked to deep midwicket. Not the greatest returns, but not many bowlers have good figures. He can only get better, I suppose. 4-0-53-1"
"good length delivery around off, defended back"
"shortish around off, pulled away towards midwicket for one. Tiring, slowing down is Munro"
"short down leg, off the inside edge down to fine leg. Bumrah following Bruce as he backs away"
"he won't be the fastest New Zealander to a T20I century. Shortish and wide, the ball takes the under-edge to the keeper"
"whipped away for a couple towards square leg. Good length on the pads, flicked to deep square leg, Rohit runs to his right and stops the boundary"
"full around off, drilled to long-on. Terrific over from Bumrah"
"good length outside off, chopped away towards short leg. Moves to 99"
"a slower legcutter outside off, Bruce makes contact too early, the ball rolls along towards long-on"
"there it is. <b>Munro's second international T20 hundred</b>, take a bow. Short and wide outside off, slapped past cover for a couple. Takes off his helmet with a big, beaming smile. Superb"
"short and wide outside off, swatted to long-off. Really struggling for timing now, fatigue having its impact"
"superb yorker around off, jammed away to long-off for one"
"intentional over cover for a couple. A wide slower delivery, Munro lifts the ball over cover, a chip for two. 4-0-29-0, fantastic from Bhuvneshwar, some of the best defensive bowling you will see, even in the Powerplay"
"full outside off, Bruce shuffles across and bunts a slap-flick to square leg, who hits the stumps at the bowler's end, but the ricochet earns him another"
"full and wide outside off, 142 kph, driven to long-off for one. Struggling for timing"
"fantastic. When a batsman is as tired as he is, I reckon captains should have third man and fine leg back, because the shots in front of the wicket are tougher. <strong>That's what McCullum and Sangakkara do very very well</strong>. On a length, Munro shuffles across and scoops the ball past short fine leg"
"full delivery outside off, driven towards long-off"
"a big slog goes past the heave. On a length on middle and leg, Bruce is through his mighty swing as the ball seams past the edge"
"full around off, a thick inside edge down to fine leg for one."
keeps his shape nicely and nudges a fuller delivery on middle and off to mid-on.
lofts it over long-on! These front foot pulls of Rohit are really audacious and this time he takes on a proper fast bowler and deposits him back over his head
"pitches it up on off stump and Rohit defends firmly, and the crowd has either gone 'ooooooh' or 'booooo'"
lets the shortish delivery come on and clips it off his hips to deep square leg
"lovely line, refusing the left-hander the room he loves and forcing him to plonk the 142 kph short ball back down the pitch"
shovels a short ball angling across him to the left of midwicket - signs that he is seeing the ball well and is reading the length early
"angles a back of a length delivery into the left-hander, perhaps getting it to nip off the deck too. Dhawan is slow to pick up all that and is hit on the thigh"
"through him! It's that inward movement again - only slight - but combine that with scoreboard pressure that makes Dhawan play outrageous shots way too early and it is deadly. Good length ball, the batsman tries to whip it over mid-on, misses the line completely and turns around to see his middle stump flattened. After his worst ODI and T20I outings over the last week, Boult is back!"
"didn't get to bat on debut, so he vents those frustrations against a very full and very wide delivery outside off, flaying it to the point boundary"
"continues angling the ball across the right-hander, and Iyer dabs it to deep third man"
"<b>beauty again</b>, and he goes up in appeal for a caught behind. Umpire Nandan is unmoved. Hits the deck hard, and a length that does not allow Rohit to move forward or back. Tries to adjust with the hands, but is undone by the movement"
"<b>given out caught behind</B>! It took a while for Nandan to raise his finger - so much that the wicketkeeper Phillips was desperately urging his captain to review. It eventually isn't needed - but a double-wicket over is exactly what New Zealand needed. And who else but Boult to provide it. Back of a length, pushing across Rohit, who looks to glide it to third man, while being stuck on the crease. A bit of extra bounce and a bit of nip off the pitch does him in."
"back of a length and outside off, Iyer smashes it behind point. He's prolific in that region"
""
walks down the pitch and looks to flick a shortish delivery over midwicket but makes no contact
rises with the attempted bouncer outside off and defuses it down to third man
keeps him pinned in the crease and Iyer responds with a punch to cover
"clears the front leg and smashes a short delivery over point. Brilliant hit, mostly because there is no one on the boundary and he has realised the bowler is only interested in banging it hard into the pitch, and not look for a good length"
"he checks the shot - and the ball goes off the bottom, and inside half of the bat, and yet it absolutely sails over mid-on."
"pushes on a good length delivery, looking to force a good length ball outside off through the cover field. But though it beats Nicholls at extra, Williamson is there as back up, and if his throw at the stumps hit target at the non-strikers', Iyer might have been in trouble"
"surprises the batsman with an excellent bouncer! It's sharp as well, coming up to the badge and Kohli is fairly late in going for the hook. There is no square leg though to take the catch"
"through point again! He is waiting for these balls so beautifully. Lets them come into his hitting area, gets up on his toes, and taps it on top of the bounce to the right of point"
looks for the wide yorker and Iyer slices it to deep third man
"pummels the ball down the ground! Steps down to it, not caring it is delivered at 141 kph, and thwack! Umpire runs for cover. Boult ducks lest he be hit"
steers a shortish delivery outside off to deep third man
fierce hit to cover point! Lifts himself to his full height and bullies a fairly short ball with a perfectly vertical (if angled) bat to the fielder
runs the short ball on off stump down to third man
"defends a shortish delivery to cover, searching for a single, but Kohli spots the ball has gone to the left of Santner, which is his throwing hand and says no"
hangs his bat out upon seeing width and is <b>beaten</b> outside off
"chucks the left leg out of the way and hammers the ball to cover, literally, with the bat going straight up over his head like a periscope and hacking down"
makes room to drive a full delivery pitching outside leg stump to cover point
<b>some turn</b> as a quicker delivery on leg stump squares up the batsman as he blocks
"fires it into the pads and Iyer, looking to heave it away over square leg, doesn't make contact"
"steps out of his crease and ends up meeting a full toss while it is still on the way down. As a result, he mistimes his slog to midwicket"
hangs back and flicks a flatter delivery on middle to midwicket
"drives a full delivery on leg stump to long-off. Only three runs off the over, as is expected of a fingerspinner <a href='http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/21275127/magic-mitchell-santner' target='_blank'>defying the odds</a>"
shifts his weight back and punches a short delivery on leg stump with a vertical bat to deep midwicket
rocks back seeing a long hop outside leg stump - but it suddenly gains pace and loses height and Iyer only just manages to squeeze the ball towards midwicket
drills a quick straight delivery to long-on
"very rapid. no room. Iyar tries to cut it through the gap at point, but he is beautifully tied down"
"and now the slower delivery, tossed up and drifting into leg stump. Iyer tries to come down the track, but he is nowhere near the pitch, looking to hit across the line and doesn't make contact"
"whips a flatter delivery on middle and leg between midwicket and long-on. Kohli wants two, but Iyer says its hit too hard and they settle for one"
"spears a full toss between point and short third man! Beautiful cricket, he steps out to Santner, turns a delivery meant to cramp him on middle into a boundary ball by opening the face at the last second"
"advances again, and this time, he goes through with a lofted shot despite Santner adjusting his length and pulling it back. Power. Sheer power to make sure it clears cover because there's no one behind him"
"goes for the revers sweep, weathers an lbw appeal, and with New Zealand wondering about a review, Kohli pinches a single. <b>Kane Wiliamson goes for it</b> in the end and replays suggest the ball - quick and angled into leg - strikes Kohli low on the front foot. Ball-tracking says it will be missing the stumps. Kohli gets a fistpump going. He wants to do this."
drives it through extra cover
"half-volley on leg stump, which Kohli punishes with a pristine shot over long-on. That's the <b>fifty partnership</b>. Kohli has been getting leg side of Santner's deliveries so easily and is then targeting the straight and extra cover boundaries which are his strengths"
this time he goes across to a good length ball on off stump and nudges it to long-on
"good length on off stump, Kohli hits through the line over extra cover"
"back of a length and outside off, Kohli slaps it to deep cover"
attempts the front foot pull against a short ball outside off and misses out on a boundary. Looks like he doesn't like pace off the ball
"that's a leading edge and Munro takes it himself! Excellent cricket! It's a knuckle ball, the seam wobbling as it hits a full length on middle and lures Iyer to slog across the line. The ball soars into the night sky. it's swirling, it's teasing and Munro tracks it perfectly, running to his right, near midwicket or mid-on and holds onto it, which is all that matters"
flays a drive all along the ground to the sweeper cover
"back of a length on off stump, pats it down to long-on"
"doesn't pick the wrong 'un! And Pandya wears an absolutely bewildered look, as if still unable to reconcile with the fact that he has been completely foxed. On a pitch that isn't turning much, a legbreak bowler can pitch the googly in line with the stumps and still hit them, which is what happens. Sodhi hits the perfect length, tempting the batsman to shift his weight back to try and cut. But then the ball spins the opposite way, Pandya is hurrying into a flick across the line. He can't catch up with the ball in time"
clips a shortish delivery off his pads to long leg
drives to long-off
a little turn on this shortish delivery outside off and Dhoni slaps it to long-off
"defends a tossed up delivery on off stump, opening the face"
"pulls the short ball on off stump to long-on, and with it being a quicker delivery, he isn't able to get his timing going. Kohli slams his bat down on his pad in frustration"
"fuller delivery on middle, Kohli taps it through midwicket, looking for two, but the man races in from the deep quickly enough to deny that"
"drives, without quite stretching all the way forward, and finds a single to long-off"
"offcutter outside off, Kohli stays beside it and cuts to the right of backward point. Good work from the fielder, putting in a dive and keeping it to a single"
"back of a length on leg stump, Dhoni nudges to midwicket"
"full toss outside off, powers it to sweeper cover"
"hammers the ball to the straight boundary! A whirl of the wrists as he meets it on the half-volley, head right over it, weight coming forward, timing top class."
gets down the pitch and clips a fuller delivery through midwicket.
"pushes it through on middle and leg, Kohli looks to work it through midwicket, but misses"
"waits on the back of a length delivery on leg stump, adjusts to the turn and bounce and defuses the ball to midwicket"
"tries to pinch a second by tapping the ball gently through midwicket, but the fielder races in very very quickly"
"one-bounce and into the sightscreen! Beautiful batting, using his feet to get to the good length ball on leg stump on the half-volley and lifting it back over Santner's head"
"drives inside out through cover to get his fifty. Celebrates it with an almost casual raise of his bat, his head bowed, his mind full of the desire to play through the innings. He's in one of his moods. LIke he was against Australia in Mohali in the last World T20"
waits on the good length ball on off stump and slices it to short third man
clips a shortish delivery outside off to deep midwicket
that's the strength he draws from those wrists! He digs out a ball that is very nearly a yorker and deposits it to the midwicket boundary
"slower ball, that sticks in the pitch, and forces Kohli to lose his shape as he flicks it through midwicket"
"looks for the slog upon seeing a short and wide delivery - but with Munro taking the pace off the ball, it is enough to make even Kohli, in this form, mistime his shot through midwicket"
"pushes well in front of his body - another sigh of the back of a length delivery holding on the pitch. Outside edge wanders to the left of backward point, who does extremely well to dive and stop the boundary"
"<b>missed stumping</b>! Sodhi is having a grand old time - luring Dhoni forward with his flight and deceiving him with his drift. The batsman panics, going for the flick against the turn, and is soundly beaten. Dhoni is wrapped up like a gift for the wicketkeeper, but Phillips, behind the stumps, however is unable to capitalise"
hares out of his crease and launches the legbreak on middle and leg over long-on. Brutal hit
out comes a long hop and Dhoni's attempt to flat bat it down the ground to the boundary is foiled by Sodhi
"<b>squares him up</b> with a quicker delivery, drifting into leg stump and breaking away sharply. Dhoni just about defends"
"gets the the ball, on off stump, to dip nicely and Dhoni, trying to drive, isn't able to. On top of that, he has to roll his wrists to combat the turn and keep it down"
down the track for a flick to long-on
charges out of his crease and hacks the short ball outside off to mid-off
"cramps him with a 142 kph delivery, which hits the deck and hustles Dhoni. He tries to flick, but only gets an inside edge"
"slower ball, short as well. Dhoni runs at the bowler, blindly, and swings across the line. An outside edge results to third man"
"comes down the pitch, making room, but Milne foxes him with a slower ball bouncer. Kohli sees it coming up to his head and he evades it, looking for a wide. But he has advanced and so can't expect such liberties"
b-e-autiful! Kohli eases down the pitch lashes a good length ball outside off to the left of long-off and Williamson's dive isn't enough
"yorker on middle and leg, Kohli squeezes it to third man to retain strike"
"advances again and chips a good length ball to long-off - he wants more than that, but Kohli has to check his shot because he doesn't get the length to get under"
"pushes the ball through on middle, and it goes on with the arm. Dhoni doesn't read it and plinks it down to long-on"
"shortish and outside off, Kohli eases it to cover"
"misses a wild slog! It doesn't seem to be Dhoni's night. Charges out of his crease, intending to get to the pitch of the ball, but he can't. The dip does him. The drift makes him swing across the line."
comes down the track and launches a manufactured half-volley on leg stump over long-on
"quicker on leg stump, Dhoni works it to deep square leg"
"Dhoni is stuck doing the splits! And could he be stumped? This is outstanding bowling. He realises the batsman will be making room to bring out his power game and so lobs up a teaser right over the wide line. Dhoni, as a result of his premeditation, is stuck twisting his body into a very odd shape to stay within his crease"
comes down the track for a hoick through midwicket
"caught behind! Kohli is the only man going for this total and with his loss, India might be done. Again, he is forced to take a risk, haring down the pitch and looking for a lofted shot down the ground. Santner bowls it quick, cramps him up and gets a thick edge which Phillips takes very well, close to his chest."
on the pads and Axar works it through square leg
stays lower than Dhoni wants it to as he plants his front leg down leg and pulls over the ball
down the track for a flick to deep square leg
walks across but he can't do much about a yorker outside off. Spears it to deep cover
"yorker, tailing quite late into the left-hander, but that helps Axar work it away to the fine leg boundary"
"no pace on the ball and Axar can't put enough on it to beat extra cover. It's a very short ball, it's an offcutter, and it's wide of the advancing batsman. Beautiful tactics. Axar reaches out to make contact, in doing so he loses his balance, and so power."
follows the batsman's move across off stump and nails the yorker
"full on off stump, Dhoni flicks to deep midwicket"
"low full toss outside off, Dhoni hits it down to long-off"
cracks a short ball outside off to the extra cover boundary
keeps the front leg away and heaves a full delivery on off stump out to long-on
"<b>dropped</b> as Dhoni mistimes it to long-off, and it is Santner's third spill of the series (at least). After he throws the ball back, he puts his hands on his knees and affords himself a smile. Makes good distance running to his left to track down the ball as a flat-batted smack to long-on goes awry. But it just doesn't stick in the mitts"
"full and outside off, slogs it to deep midwicket"
slower ball goes wrong and is wided down leg
"full toss on middle stump, whips it to the square leg boundary"
"a slower short ball outside off, Dhoni pulls it to long-on"
into the stands behind midwicket. It's a length ball from around the wicket and Dhoni gets under it and heaves it into the crowd
"full and outside off, smears it to long-off and doesn't take the single. He's one shy of a fifty"
"the short ball gets too big on him - arrives too quickly as well - and the pull shot goes only as far as square leg. Finally something sticks for Santner. And Boult, after two of his worst performances ever, has four-for"
"full and outside off, Bumrah slices it to point"
"slower ball in line with the stumps, Bumrah gets an inside edge to fine leg"
"yorker on middle, Bhuvi pushes it to long-on and that's the game"
