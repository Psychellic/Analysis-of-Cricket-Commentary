"poor ball, false shot, misfielding on the boundary. Gee, this is a good start. This is short and wide, Dickwella flashes at it with no feet. Gets an outside edge past the two slips. Jadhav moving to his right, slips and the ball bypasses him"
"fuller delivery outside off, secures the outside edge again as Dickwella pokes outside his off stump. Down to third man again"
drifts down leg as he pitches a good length ball on middle and finding new-ball swing.
<b>appreciable swing into the right-hander</b> as Chandimal gets an inside edge onto the top part of his pad
"<b>outswinger</b> which squares Chandimal up as he defends to cover. Good control from Bhuvi, the kind that is expected of him"
"tries to clip a fuller delivery on leg stump to long leg, but he is a little tentative"
lets go a good length ball outside off
"on the pads and Dickwella lifts it towards the square leg boundary. Outstanding shot, the kind he plays in his sleep, picking the ball up using his fast hands, but he should have run harder."
"full on off stump, blocks back to Bumrah"
stands up tall and punches a shortish delivery outside off behind point
"gets some nip into the right-hander off back of a length, Chandimal nudges it to long leg and informs his partner about the new-ball jagging around"
"<b>slower ball</b>, outside off - he took out Dickwella with such a delivery in the last game, and again today the batsman is early into his shot. Checks it so the drive goes down to cover"
<b>appeal for lbw</B> as he pins Dickwella to the crease and hurries him with his pace. Umpire Wilson thinks it pitches outside leg and so shakes his head
plays with the ball snaking away from him as he late cuts it to deep third man. The shortish length might have helped Chandimal pull the shot off
"<b>jags away off the seam again</B> and Chandimal follows it with his hands, opening the face of the bat to make sure it goes wide of the second slip"
"stands still and throws his hands at a back of a length ball going across him. <b>Beaten</b>, and after it, he shakes his head like he wants to clear it of such shots"
moves across onto off stump and whips a shortish delivery on middle and off to the square leg boundary. Sensational wristwork to send a ball intended to dart across him out there
wanders right across outside off again and Bhuvneshwar pitches it up and shifts his line wider. The batsman defends to cover
"<b>just past gully, as Rohit dives full length to his left</b>. There is some juice in this pitch! And India have a fine bowler to exploit it. Bhuvi pitches it on middle, gets it to rear up and away from the left-hander. Dickwella fends at it and survives"
"<b>pins him in front now</b>! But Dickwella is looking to see if he should take <b>a review</b>. And he does. So lets see if this yorker has worked. First thoughts were this ball hit his feet on the full, and if so, he would have been plumb. But replays show clearly that the ball has pitched and then hit the back foot - and because of that Dickwella will survive because it <b>pitched outside leg</b>"
"slower ball, looking for the top of off stump, defends well"
"back of a length on off stump, blocks"
"another <b>massive appeal for lbw</b> as Dickwella swings right across the line. Bumrah is certain this is out, he's trying to convince Kohli to go for the review, and he finally has. India might have their man here, folks. Searing yorker, beats Dickwella, having pitched on leg stump, hits him low on the pads in front of middle, and then HawkEye projects it to crash into the stumps. Umpire Wilson changes his decision and Sri Lanka have lost their in-form opener early"
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
<b>ample lift</b> outside off as he hits the deck hard and makes the ball seam away from Mendis' outside edge.
"good length, outside off, Chandimal ignores it as it seams away"
"steps into an on-the-up drive outside off and slices it between point and slip. He isn't in perfect control of the shot, but he feels he needs to play it because Bhuvi has offered width"
"now comes the inswinger, which Chandimal responds to with a straight bat"
"back of a length on off stump, blocks into the off side, which has been bolstered. One of the slips has moved into the covers after that boundary"
"gets across onto off stump, and after waiting that little bit to let it come on, he pats it to midwicket"
"loads up the drive again, but this time, he's into the shot too early and it skews off the inside edge to mid-on"
<b>straightens past the outside edge</b> as Bumrah hits the deck and lures Mendis into a bad shot
"full on off stump, Mendis gets his front foot to the ball, his head settles over it, and down comes the straight bat. Lovely"
"flirts with a back of a length delivery outside edge and he's <b>beaten soundly</B>. Bumrah showing his wares with the new ball, showing he has more dimensions than just being a death-overs specialist"
"<b>another lbw appeal</b>, and Wilson turns it down on account of height. Beautiful bowling though, having set the right-hander up with balls darting away, this one jags in off a good length and traps Mendis on the crease"
defends a shortish delivery on off stump to point
blocks a good length ball on off stump. That's a maiden
goes for the short ball because Chandimal has been happily pressing forward. The batsman ducks
clips the thigh pad and slithers through Dhoni behind the stumps as he tumbles to his left and doesn't get low enough quick enough
"141 kph, and that <b>pace surprises Chandimal</b> as he plays across the line and gets struck on the thigh pad again. This is a gorgeous pitch for the new ball. About time in one-day cricket"
"goes for the bouncer again, right over middle and off, Chandimal indulges in a hook but it soars over his top edge"
drivable ball outside off and Chandimal takes it on. Finds mid-off though
"blocks a good length ball outside off to cover, and that's a maiden too. Last 12, no runs."
"full toss on off stump, Mendis isn't quite ready for it and to adjust for that, he takes his bottom hand off the bat as he drives to mid-on"
"good length ball on off stump, pushes it to mid-on"
"tries to flick into the gap at midwicket, left open intentionally to lure that shot out with Bumrah getting the ball to straighten from middle. <b>Leading edge</b> wanders to cover"
"<b>good grab at second slip by Rohit</b>. The thick outside edge flies to him, demanding him to dive to his right, and he takes it with both hands. Super stuff. Of course, he has that chance to show off because Bumrah keeps hitting the deck and making the ball jag away. Mendis wafts at it, with his feet moving the other way from the shot, and pays for the mistake"
"back of a length on leg stump, nurdles it to long leg"
"gets on top of the shortish ball on off stump, but before that he has moved across to make sure he can clip it past the left of midwicket. Excellent balance, and as a result his timing is on song"
"he's been bowling superbly, but as a fielder at third man, he is ridiculous! Bumrah settles behind a slap heading to him and then lets it graze past his thigh to the boundary"
the angry fast bowler comes back with a bouncer on middle. Chandimal ignores it because it's got too much height
"back of a length on off stump, defends to cover"
"goes for the flick, and though he's timed it well, it finds Chahal at short midwicket"
"another bouncer, soaring over his head on middle and leg, and umpire Palliyaguruge in concert with his colleague at square leg call it wide. Bhuvi's not happy"
"pushes a shortish delivery to the left of mid-off, good touch, good single"
squares him up on middle as Thirimanne defends to point
"plants the slower one at the base of middle, Chandimal works it behind square leg"
a <b>ripper</b> that pitches on off stump and carries on with the angle past the left-hander's tentative poke
"<b>how has that not taken the edge?</b>. This one swings, as opposed to movement off the pitch, as Bumrah pitches it up on off stump, lures the drive, and leaves the batsman looking a bit silly"
"good length ball on middle, defends"
"<b>third time beaten</b>, now off back of a length, with the ball bouncing past the shoulder of the bat held by a hard-handed Thirimanne"
leaves a good length ball shaping away from the left-hander. Good end to the over both from Bumrah and Thirimanne
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
"whirls around for an lbw appeal, Bhuvi wants it, but Dhoni isn't quite so keen, he thinks there is bat and he's quite right. A back of a length ball on off stump, which Chandimal tries to bully with a flick through midwicket."
"pulls the short ball from across his left shoulder, and as a result, he gets a top edge over the keeper"
"back of a length and outside off, leaves it alone"
"good length, on off stump, Chandimal keeps his bat and pad together to block"
"<b>appeal for caught behind</b> and Dhoni has a sheepish smile on his face as everyone look to him for the DRS call. Indecision means they don't go for it. But what a ball. Hits the deck, rears away off the pitch, has Chandimal distorting his body to poke at the ball. <b>Soundly beaten</b>"

"steps out to take the tossed up ball, turns it into a full toss and drives it to long-off"

works a good length ball on middle to long leg
drives a fuller ball outside off back to Chahal
"too straight, and Thirimanne accepts it gratefully, tucks it off his pads to the fine leg boundary"
"excellent timing, just a big stretch forward for a defensive push to a good-length ball outside off. Rolls away crisply through cover and they take one"
"extra bounce now. Banged in short, and he's caught the bottom thumb. Chandimal was on his toes, shaping to tuck the ball into the leg side off his body, and was probably expecting it to rise chest high. Hits the thumb and deflects onto the helmet grille, and Chandimal's thumb is now getting some attention from the physio. That must have been super painful"
"predictably, another short ball, and it's well directed, angling in and rising to around neck height. He took his eye off the ball, but he played close to his body, dropped his bottom hand, and the ball hit the handle of his bat and dropped down softly by his feet"
"shortish on off stump, defended into the backward point region"
"another short ball, getting up to around head high. He's caught in two minds, between ducking and fending, decides to try and fend into the leg side, and the ball hits high on the bat and drops into the off side instead"

"nice loop on middle stump, clipped to the left of midwicket, who dives, gets a hand to it, and deflects to mid-on"

"bouncer, gets up way over head high this time and Chandimal, who initially shaped to hook, has no option but to leave it"

"back of a length and outside off, Chameera pulls again, and misses again"
"evades a short ball outside off and that's the end of <b>a maiden over, in the 47th</b>."
"he's through the short-arm flick way too early, and the offcutter eventually arrives to strike Siriwardana on the body. Almost at the grille even"
slugs a length ball on leg stump out to the deep square leg boundary. Brutal hit. First boundary off Bumrah in his ninth over
"backs away and launches a length ball on leg stump over the cover boundary. This is high-quality hitting. Siriwardana has seen that four of India's five boundary riders are on the leg side, so he makes room to open up the other side"
"back of a length and quick, Siriwardana tries to pull it to the fine leg boundary. No dice"
"<b>maiden five-for</b>! And he celebrates it with a huge smile on his face. Lovely stuff. Goes full, goes straight, and in response the stumps go flat. Siriwardana had his fun, but this slog doesn't work out."
"full and outside off, scoops it in the air through cover point"
backs away to block a shortish delivery on middle
in the slot and Chameera finally gets his pull working properly. All through the previous over Bhuvi beat him on that shot and bowled a maiden. This time it's a rank long hop and the batsman sends it away to the square leg boundary
"races down the pitch, making room,. so Bhuvi spears it at Chameera's toes. Single into the off side"
"another yorker on leg stump, the batsman whips it down to long-on"
"bouncer, follows Chameera's move down leg. Pull and miss"
"that bouncer's gained too much height, but not too many are bothered about that because while pinching a bye, Chameera is run-out at the non-strikers' end. Dhoni moves to his left to collect the ball, and quickly sends it across to Bhuvi, who takes a couple of steps to the stumps and underarms it through"
"short and outside off, Malinga swings and misses"
"slower ball, lobs <b>just over middle stump</b> as Fernando tries to lift it over the off side."
"yorker on off stump, digs it out"
backs away to hack a good length ball on middle through midwicket. Gets an inside edge onto boot
flirts at a back of a length ball outside off and is beaten for trying
"another slower ball, outside off, Malinga wafts at it, is comfortably beaten. But on its way through the keeper, it does a little mischief. Sticks in the turf and rears up at Dhoni's head. Has little chance of stopping it"
squirts it out to deep third man
"drills it past the left of mid-off,Jadhav gets a hand to it, and then races back to stop the boundary."
"a bit of outswing straightaway, fullish and close to off stump. Defended into the covers"
"shortish outside off, stabbed to cover point"
"a bit more width, short too, and Rohit stands tall and slaps that away through point. Not the greatest start from Malinga so far"
"back of a length on off stump, defended towards point"
"back of a length outside off, punched towards backward point"
"back of a length on off and middle, defended to mid-on"
"you do not bowl there to Shikhar Dhawan. The man loves room outside off, and this is a little overpitched too, just lashes the drive away through square cover"
"back of a length, closer to off stump, lets it come on and dabs to third man"
"back of a length, close to off stump, defended towards backward point"
"length ball on middle and off, a tiny bit of shape back in, defended back towards the bowler"
"full, close to off stump, punched to mid-on"
"big appeal for lbw, and that's a really good ball. Excellent length, pinned Rohit to the crease, and a bit of inward movement to beat his attempted on-drive, but the question is, did it pitch in line? Umpire Joel Wilson doesn't think so, and Sri Lanka have reviewed... Well, we won't even get to where it pitched, because replays show a clear inside-edge onto pad"
"Gone, and that's Malinga's 299th in ODIs! Not enough room for the cut, and he stays leg-side of the ball and tries to chop it away. A bit of inward shape, and all he can do is inside-edge into his middle stump. This was the sort of ball most left-hand batsmen would have looked to get behind and play towards mid-on or midwicket, not even mid-off"
"length ball, straightens slightly on an off-stump line. Gets back and across to tuck it away through square leg"
"back of a length, close to off stump, punched to cover point"
"length ball, fourth-stump line, lets it come on and punches with an open bat face, into the gap between backward point and cover point, aiming for placement rather than power, and Kapugedera moves to his left from cover point to cut it off"
"back of a length, a little closer to off stump, punched to mid-off"
"length ball angling in, a bit of late away shape towards off stump. Defended towards mid-on"
"back of a length, angling across and shaping back slightly towards off stump to cramp Kohli for room. Defended into the on side"
"fullish on off stump, blocked to short extra-cover"
"beauty. Knew what he was doing there, slanted it away, wide of off stump, inviting the cover drive on the up. Kohli goes for it, misses, and he's lucky not to edge it"
"back of a length close to off stump, gets back and across to defend with soft hands. Then he picks the ball up with a tennis-style juggle with his bat, and flicks it to a fielder"
"fullish outside off, stretches out to push into the covers"
"full, fourth-stump line, blocked to mid-off. End of an excellent, probing over, a maiden"
"length ball, strays onto leg stump, clipped away through square leg"
"a bit of outswing on a fourth-stump line, fairly full. Kohli stretches forward to drive, and extra-cover dives left to stop it"
"back of a length on off stump, goes back and across and pushes with a straight bat to the right of mid-on. Good shot, knew exactly where he could pick up a safe single"
"short, a bit of width, Rohit has to wait slightly because it stopped on him, and he let it come on, and then cut it away crisply to the right of backward point"
"back of a length on middle stump, and Rohit plays a lovely little clip, the bat utterly straight until the point of impact, to the left of deep square leg"
"bouncer, slightly misdirected, ends up down the leg side. Wanted to attack Kohli's left shoulder, I think, and tempt him into the hook"
"short outside off, lets it come on and opens his bat face to dab it down to third man"
"gone! Fernando's got his man. Not the way he must have visualised getting the Indian captain out, but he won't care. It's not exactly a wicket-taking ball, on the pads and asking to be flicked. But Kohli's maybe a touch early on it, and maybe the left-armer's inswing makes him hit it finer than he'd like, and he ends up flicking in the air, to the man stationed at long leg. Chameera's the fielder, and he takes it brilliantly, diving forward as it dips on him"
"back of a length wide of off stump, left alone"
"length ball close to off stump, defended into the covers"
"back of a length, shifts his line wider again, hoping to tempt Rahul to play away from his body. He ignores it"
"back of a length, slanting away from off stump, another solid leave"
"ooh, now he has a little poke, and doesn't connect. Good ball, just short of a good length, and a little closer to off stump than the previous one. Looks to punch into the covers without really getting back and across, and he's lucky he doesn't edge it"
"length ball on middle stump, defended to midwicket"
"back of a length, fifth-stump line, 141kph. Carries through to the keeper at shoulder height after Rohit leaves"
"a touch shorter this time, a bit of width, and Rohit puts that away beautifully, standing up tall and bringing his bat down utterly straight to punch it away through point"
"ooh, risky. Length ball, Chameera shifts his line a little wider, and he goes to drive it on the up, away from his body, and slices it to the left of backward point. Goes in the air, just too wide of the fielder to complete a diving catch"
"length ball, closer to off stump, defended into the covers"
"length ball, fourth-stump line, defended to mid-off"
"good ball, slanting across and nipping back after pitching just short of a good length. Shapes for the back-foot punch into the covers, initially, then adjusts to play a hurried defensive flick into the leg side"
"again some shape back in. Defends firmly into the pitch, and the ball nearly bounces back up and hits Rahul's helmet"
"too straight, clipped off the pads to the left of long leg. First runs off Fernando for 17 balls"
"back of a length on middle stump, lets it come on and tucks it away to long leg"
"full, and Rohit plays around his front pad and provokes an lbw appeal, but that definitely pitched outside leg stump. Ball rolls away into the square leg region for a leg bye"
"fullish, pitches just outside off and continues with the angle away. Left alone"
"fullish, sixth-stump line, left alone"
"back of a length, fourth-stump line, defended to backward point. Kept a little low, and hit fairly low on Rohit's bat"
"length ball angling into off stump, defended into the point region with an open bat face"
"back of a length, angling into off stump, punched to mid-off"
"back of a length, a bit of width, leans back and stabs it crisply but straight to backward point"
"ooh, streaky! Rohit was getting a little restless after all those dots, and he goes back to cut a fairly full delivery wide outside off. A bit of late outswing, and the ball takes the outside half of his bat and flies away wide of first slip. One more slip, and that would have been rather interesting"
"ooh, this is nervy stuff from Rahul. Shuffles across his crease rather than going forward or back, and the ball straightens slightly, into him, and keeps a little low. Jabs at it, and the inside edge hits his back leg"
"back of a length close to off stump, pushed gently into the covers for a quick single"
"back of a length on off stump, punched towards mid-off"
"back of a length on off stump, punched to mid-off"
"length ball slanting across towards off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"again that uncertain length, and a bit of inward movement. Rohit plays hesitantly, a push rather than a shot or a block, looking for a single into the covers maybe, and the thick inside edge rolls away towards long leg"
"short on off stump, gets up to chest height but without any real pace, and Rohit loves it there, pulls it away and deep square leg, throwing himself to his right after sprinting hard, can't cut it off"
"back of a length outside off, opens his bat face to guide it to third man"
"shot! And a super stop at backward point. Hasaranga the fielder, diving to his right to cut off a fiercely struck square-cut from Rahul"
"length ball fairly wide of off, gets a nice stride out, lets it come on, and pushes towards point"
"back of a length close to off stump, and a bit of inward nibble. Rahul goes back and across to defend, and gets another inside edge that rolls into the backward square-leg region"
"length ball, fifth-stump line, left alone"
"oh man. Every second shot of Rahul's has come off the inside edge today. It wasn't quite short enough or wide enough to punch through cover off the back foot, and he had to go at it with an angled bat as a result. A bit of inward nip, and the thick inside edge eludes leg stump and runs away to the fine leg boundary"
"back of a length close to off stump, pushed gently into the covers for a quick single"
"lbw appeal, but that pitched outside leg. Good-length ball, and you need to swing it in a lot more than that to be able to pitch in line and still hit the stumps. Played all around it, but he was in no danger because of where it pitched"
"length  ball on off stump, presses forward, waits, and drops it into the point region with soft hands to turn the strike over"
"full, fifth-stump line. Not the biggest stride forward to drive, slices it to backward point"
short and wide and this time Rahul just smashes it. Up on his toes to lash a cut through cover point
"another inside edge. Another one nips in off the seam, from just back of a length. Rohit wants to dab that to third man, and the ball hits his inside edge, bounces down close to him, and then up to the keeper"
"down the track and Rohit goes for the big hit to try and relieve the pressure. A bit of width, and he extends his arms gratefully and slashes it up and over the covers"
"length ball on off stump, defended into the covers"
"back of a length, angling into middle and off, clipped away quietly through midwicket"
"back of a length close to off stump, and yikes, now a mix-up to go with all the inside edges. He walks out of his crease, dabs to the right of backward point, and sets off for a single. Rohit responds instantly, and it should have been a comfortable single. But for some reason Rahul stops, watching the backward point moving to his right to stop it, and then resumes his journey to the non-striker's end. All that means he needs to dive to save himself, and a direct hit may have been interesting. As it happened, the fielder missed the stumps"
"back of a length close to off stump, dabbed away to third man"
tossed-up offbreak outside off. Doesn't turn like Rohit expects as he comes forward to flick through mid-on or midwicket. Ends up taking the outside edge and running away behind point
"stays back to a length ball turning in towards off stump, defends to short leg. The orthodox offbreak"
"loopy offbreak wide of off, and Rahul goes for the big flat-bat drive and misses. Went too hard at it, the shot was on"
"back of a length on off stump, goes on the back foot to punch to the right of deep point"
"googly, but it's also a long-hop, but that doesn't matter, because Rahul has picked out the fielder at deep midwicket with his pull. What a way to get out. It was almost as if he was telling himself he would impose himself on Dananjaya today, and then his eyes lit up as soon as he saw the short ball, but he failed to take enough precautions to keep his shot down or hit it away from that man on the boundary. He just had to run a few yards to his left and accept the simplest of catches"
"legbreak, pitching just outside leg and then straightening with extra bounce. Nervous start for Jadhav, lifts his bat out of the way and pads up"

"<b>does him again!</b>. For the second time in two matches, Dananjaya gets rid of Jadhav. This one is the legbreak, tossed up and straight. The batsman goes for a sweep, hitting right across the line and missing completely. Hits him on the back thigh as he is kneeling and umpire Wilson says that's adjacent. HawkEye confirms that's three reds."
"legbreak becomes a full toss on off stump, drills it to long-on"
"<b>keeps low</b> does the legbreak, and Rohit is just about able to bring his bat down in time for a single to long-on. Trots across to the other end with a look to the heavens that says, 'he's hard enough to play as it is without these vagaries of the pitch'"

"he's up to the short ball at 143 kph this time, shifting his weight back and pulling it behind square leg, because he wants to avoid the boundary rider. <b>Fifty for Rohit</b>"
"gets the pull away again! Don't bowl short to me he says, and is more than a match for a 143 kph delivery coming up to his chest. Rolls on the back foot, gets on top of the ball and places it between long leg and square leg on the boundary"

stays back to a good length ball on middle and leg and blocks

"shortish outside off, opens his bat face and guides it down to third man"
"short, wide, and Dhoni gets up on his toes and slashes it away, uppercutting deliberately and hitting it to the right of the man at backward point. What a way to bring up his fifty"
"slower length ball on off stump, defended to short extra-cover"
"length ball on off stump, shows the full face to push towards mid-on"
"slower length ball, fourth-stump line, watches it well and stabs towards backward point"
"short, a bit of width, and that's lovely from Dhoni. Leans back this time, and cuts late, to the left of backward point, and forces Malinga to run to his right from third man and pull off a football-style sliding stop at the boundary"
"length ball on middle stump, makes room and punches into the covers"
"flat, angling down leg, and that's superb from Rohit, judged the line perfectly, opened up at the hips while sinking down to his back knee, and sweeping flat and hard past the square-leg umpire"
"tossed up full on middle stump, driven down to long-on"
"out of his crease, and out of the ground. Long-on is in place, but Dhoni doesn't care. Jumps out with his backlift high, clears his front leg, and easily clears the man on the boundary"
"down the track again, and this time he gets too close to the pitch of a flatter delivery and jabs back to the bowler"
"down the track once more, clipped away through midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, lets it come on and nudges it to the right of midwicket to bring up the 150 partnership"
"slower ball, wide of off, leans back and slashes to the left of third man"
"back of a length outside off, punched to the left of deep point, where Vishwa Fernando makes a tumbling stop"
"slower ball, back of a length on off stump, lets it come on and dabs gently into the point region"
"back of a length, fourth-stump line, lets it come on and guides it down to third man"
"another slower ball, back of a length and outside off, and Dhoni opens his bat face to run it down to third man"
"and that, belatedly, is that. Full-toss on the pads, and Dhoni miscues his flick, but it won't matter. Everyone on the leg side is in the circle, and it loops up over midwicket and lands safely beyond the fielder turning around and chasing back towards the boundary"
