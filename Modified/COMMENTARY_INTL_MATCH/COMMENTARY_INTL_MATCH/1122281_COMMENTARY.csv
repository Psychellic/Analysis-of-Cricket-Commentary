"a good length delivery around middle to start, Rohit stands tall and defends back up the pitch"
"nicely bowled, goes wider of the crease and goes fuller outside off. Rohit lets it go watchfully"
"139 kph, full and straight, pushed up towards mid-off from the crease"
"phew, what happened there? Bounce already in this pitch, like the Test. Variable bounce. Back of a length delivery around off, the ball climbs and climbs <strong>and hits the splice</strong>. The ball falls just short of the diving point fielder."
"beauty! Back of a length delivery outside off, the ball pitches, holds its line and beats Rohit on the outside edge."
"trying to withdraw the bat, but the ball takes the inside edge! Why? It's because of the length and pace. The indecisive length - Rohit doesn't know whether to come forward or go back - and Rabada's pace - more then 135 kmph. It all results in an uncertainty in Rohit's play. A thin inside edge as the ball seams back, and Klaasen has his first catch in international cricket. Lovely start from Rabada"
"a poor start from Ngidi, overpitches outside off, the ball is too full and Dhawan strides forward and caresses a drive through cover. Lovely timing."
"drags the length back, not as full. Full and straight, driven back to the bowler"
"back of a length outside off, the ball pitches and moves away, left alone, 135 kph"
"that's a good length, slightly fuller than good. And Dhawan strides forward and pushes to mid-off. Not much swing, but <strong>there is bounce in this surface</strong>"
"back of a length around off, angling away, 137 kph, defended to cover from the crease"
"well bowled, 129 kph, a nicely-directed bouncer, Dhawan watches it go by. Had enough time to watch it past."
"beaten on the outside edge. Not much from Rabada or Kohli. A full delivery outside off, pitches and moves away just enough to beat the edge. If you're beating Kohli's bat, and not taking the edge, it's a good ball."
"a short delivery around middle and leg, hurries Kohli, but he has got underneath"
"<strong>and Kohli's given</strong>. A duck? Kohli reviews. It was a full delivery down leg, Kohli walks across and misses a flick. Did he walk across too much? Yes, says the umpire! Is there a spike? There seems to be a discernible spike as ball passes bat. There are spikes all around. And so it seems there is bat. Just clipping the side of leg stump, on HawkEye."
"full delivery on a fourth-stump channel around off, defended to mid-off"
"good length delivery outside off, Kohli gets forward and defends into the cover region. Superb bowling from Rabada"
"full delivery down leg, strays too far and Kohli helps himself. Didn't walk across too much, instead just flicked it fine to the fine leg boundary. Spoiled two maidens to start from Rabada."
"another poor ball from Ngidi, full and wide, overpitched, Dhawan caresses a drive through cover. Easy runs. Has to be closer to off stump"
"bowling two lines already. Strays on the pads, 140 kph, worked down to fine leg for a run"
"not a very good start from Ngidi, too straight and flicked down to fine leg for a run"
"that's better from Ngidi, but Dhawan plays that really well. Back of a length outside off, Dhawan opens the bat face really late, carves it past slip. By the time third man runs around to his left, the ball is hurtling away too quickly. A dive, and a half stop but the ball rolls away"
"back of a length around off, defended back"
"good length down leg, worked away to midwicket from the crease."
"full delivery outside off, Kohli gets forward and defends watchfully. Still no swing, just a hint of seam. But lots of bounce"
"back of a length around off, the ball moves back, blocked back under his eyes"
strays down leg for a wide. Started that too straight
"good length around off, seams back in. Played nicely back. Kohli getting himself in, this is definitely SA's chance. He rarely gives it away if he gets past this"
"smashed! Just a touch short, Kohli goes back and nails his pull through midwicket. His form is so good that he reads the length very quickly"
"back of a length outside off, left alone watchfully"
"good finish, short again but much wider outside off, asking Kohli to cut if he wants runs. He doesn't right now, left alone"
"short and wide from Ngidi, slashed to third man for a run"
"much better line, goes wider of the crease and uses the inswinger, so he doesn't start it too wide. Left alone by Kohli, he's playing that shot well"
"too straight from Ngidi, this is not very good bowling. Too inconsistent. Kohli simply flicks him through square leg for four. Nonchalance"
"shortish outside off, the ball seams back, left alone"
"back of a length, climbs on Kohli, back of a length, Kohli gets on top of the bounce to defend. Keeps it down nicely."
"good finish. Using the surface, dug in around off. Kohli is right on top of the bounce to defend. He looks in really good form, his technique is spot on too, waiting for bowlers to come to him."
"fullish around middle and leg, played to square leg. I don't see much swing (none in the air), there is some seam"
"nailed! Short and wide outside off, cannot bowl there to Shikhar D. Slashed to point, where Duminy somehow stops it."
"full outside off, a thick outside edge to third man. That's a better length to Dhawan. Around the fourth-stump channel"
"good length delivery outside off, fourth stump again. Blocked to cover"
"143 kph, terrific delivery, good length on a fourth-stump channel. Kohli stands tall and blocks. But keep it there"
"great over from Rabada. 143 kph around off, Kohli is right behind the line to defend. Just one off the over."
"a full delivery outside off, the ball slices off the outside half to third man. Dhawan throwing his hands at it, meeting the ball a touch early maybe"
"full outside off, the ball skews off the inside half to midwicket"
"oh yeah! 137 kph, delectable. Overpitched outside off, Kohli strides forward and drills a cover drive, just a punchy push. Awesome timing."
"excellent single now. Back of a length outside off, tapped towards gully, with soft hands. And Dhawan calls Kohli through, much to his delight"
"good length outside off, pushed into the off side, towards cover."
"through the gap again and four more. Too full outside off, Dhawan strides forward and caresses his drive through cover, not fantastic timing but enough for four even on pretty big square boundaries"
"good length delivery around off, looking for that off bail. Defended. The line is impeccable"
"full delivery outside off, Kohli leans forward and drives to mid-off with decent timing, not great. Met the ball a fraction of a second later"
"142 kph, what was that from Kohli? Back of a length, maybe even short. Kohli is so comfortable while swaying, that he thinks of upper-cutting, misses. A smile from both parties"
"a yorker outside off, jammed out."
"another bouncer, well-directed, towards leg, Kohli is rushed, off the glove to square leg"
"lovely shot. Overpitched outside off, Dhawan comes forward and nicely times a drive through cover. Just too inconsistent and India have pounced on that, which is why they have 44 in 9 overs"
"a full delivery outside off, defended back, 134 kph"
"good length delivery outside off, 136 kph, chopped away towards point, Dhawan refuses the run, rightly."
"ooh, lucky. Full delivery outside off, Kohli spars at the ball, hits the inside edge and beats short fine leg. Square leg runs around to his right and cuts off the boundary"
"full and straight, blocked back, nice line"
"a good length delivery outside off, 138 kph, looks to punch the ball through cover but the ball comes back in, hits the inside half towards cover"
"137 kph, an inside edge for four. Back of a length outside off, Kohli goes at the ball again, a thick inside edge beats the stumps and short fine leg and earns Kohli four. Has to be careful of that inward movement."
"back of a length down leg, worked away to deep square leg for a single"
"a full delivery outside off, 129 kph, keeps a touch low, dabbed to point"
"a full delivery outside off, 126 kph, Kohli drives on the up, to the sweeper cover for a run"
"that's well bowled, on a length around off, worked to midwicket. Kohli says no this time."
"128 kph, full and wide outside off, punched through cover, finds the fielder"
"full outside off, 126 kph, Dhawan runs down at the bowler and drives to cover. A good comeback from Phehlukwayo, very important for him to find confidence early"
"full delivery outside off, Kohli shuffles across and comes forward and flicks the ball through midwicket. No man there, two more"
"bounce! Back of a length around off and middle, the ball keeps climbing, hits the splice of Kohli's bat. Took him by surprise."
"142 kph, <strong>out if Duminy hit</strong>. Another poor call. Full delivery outside off, taps to point. Kohli calls for one, Dhawan responds. Out by more than a few inches had he hit."
"good length delivery outside off, patted towards point."
"slightly shorter, and Dhawan picks the length early, pulls to deep backward square leg."
"141 kph, full delivery outside off, pushed to mid-off. And Kohli calls. His call, and he makes it easily. Dhawan labours towards the other end."
"131 kph, full and wide from Phehlukwayo, Kohli throws his hands at it, finds a thick outside edge down to third man"
"129 kph, runs down, but the ball strays down leg. An untidy collection from Klaasen as the ball drops late on him. Two free runs for India."
"128 kph, good length delivery outside off, Kohli uses his wrists to flick the ball to midwicket, followed by a loud call of 'nooo'"
"127 kph, digs it in, short and wide, dabbed to third man for a run."
"130 kph, just wide of midwicket for a couple. Back of a length around middle and leg, pulled away with bad timing, just wide of the fielder. Their concentration isn't very high"
"back of a length outside off, pushed to point from the back foot. A good stop from JP"
"126 kph, tripe from Phehlukwayo. Back of a length and well down leg, all Dhawan needed to do was get some bat on it, very fine to the fine leg boundary. Has to be better than that, very good first over followed by a terrible one."
"139 kph, good from Morris, full around middle, defended."
on the pads and Kohli helps himself to one through square leg. SA struggling a touch

"excellent over from Morris. Back of a length outside off, chopped down to third man for a single."
"more tripe from Phehlukwayo, full and wide outside off at just about medium pace, slashed past point. Has to be closer to off stump."

"full and wide outside off, carved away to third man for a run. Opened the bat face."
"got away with that. That is not good bowling. A short back of the hand slower ball, slashed to deep point. Should have put that away"
"dug in again, short around off, 126 kph, pulled to deep square leg. At that pace, he isn't going to trouble Dhawan with the short ball"
"127 kph, another short ball that is easily pulled to square leg. Has to be full at his pace, but he doesn't want to be smashed back."
"full and straight, worked to midwicket for a run."

"a short delivery outside off, Dhawan looks to open the bat face and guide the ball over gully, but makes no contact"
"too short and Dhawan helps himself to four. Back of a length down leg, Dhawan pulls into the gap behind square. Got on top of the bounce, hardly hurrying Dhawan. Not good from SA"
"SHORT AGAIN. Back of a length around off, pulled to deep square leg."
"full outside off, driven firmly back at the bowler"
"ah, there it is. The Dhawan sweep. And it brings up <b>his fifty</b> It's is go-to against wristspinners. Plants the front leg forward and hoicks this length ball to deep square"

"<b>taken at short midwicket.</b> You could see even against Tahir that the slower it got, the more edgy Dhawan was getting. Duminy floated this up at off stump.

"<b>and he's made Rahane play a poor shot.</b> A small play from Markram, putting a fielder in the batsman's sight. And one dot ball later, Rahane feels the need to step out again. Once again, he's beaten in the flight. Dips and drifts away from him. He's reaching out and his bottom hand is coming off. It's a feeble chip to long-off off the bottom of the bat"

He has missed a straight one, he went way back but like de Kock in the first ODI, he just misses one. Three reds on HawkEye, so SA lose their set man and the review. Sinking again against wristspin."

In the end, he has to get down on his knees and swipe across the line to try and make a sweep out of it. It skids under the blade and hits him on the back thigh, right in front of the stumps. No doubt there, it was pitching in line. India brought back a wristpinner to get Morris, they've got him first ball"

"<b>not picked</b> again. Wrong'un. Phehlukwayo gets adventurous on the back foot, exposing two of his stumps to try and cut. Just gets the bat down to survive"
his response is to go the other way and cover those two stumps this time. Kuldeep floats it outside off and wide from him. The loop beats him as he goes across the line and another top edge is taken easily at extra cover

<b>oh yes. Ngidi is a fast learner.</b> Nails the slog as this length ball comes into him from outside off. Finds the midwicket boundary on the bounce.
and that's what he does. Wrong'un straightens from middle stump at a good length. Ngidi looks for the slog again and he's struck in front of off stump
