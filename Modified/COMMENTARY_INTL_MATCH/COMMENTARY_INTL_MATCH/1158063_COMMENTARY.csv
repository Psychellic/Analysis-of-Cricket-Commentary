"<B>crikey!</B> Jerusalem hadn't even started, and <B>Burns so nearly chopped on!</B> Kicking off the surface from round the wicket, into an upraised bat, and down agonisingly close to the poles!"
"left this time, with a touch more comfort than previously"
"wider line, pushed through from round the wicket again, no stroke"
"Burns is starting to line them up better now, not a lot of carry as he lets another one zip by"
"a bit of swing, but too wide to tempt a stroke"
"swing again, but directly from the hand. Ends up pitching well wide of the stumps, and after an anxious opening delivery, that was a pretty comfortable over"
sliding down the leg side. A nice comfortable sighter
bat on ball for the first time in Tests. Leaning onto the front foot
"up onto the toes, aggressive intent from Denly, who chops firmly out to point, without much timing"
"<B>a swishing drive!</B> Can't fault the intent, but careful now! A half-volley length, but skims through to the keeper, past the edge"
"<B>wide line, massive lift off the deck!</B> Denly has another mow, he really, really wants that first run. Dowrich leaps to gather"
"banged in on a good length outside off stump, good carry again from Gabriel, as Denly leaves well alone this time"
pushed out to gully off the back foot
"wide line outside off, no stroke offered"
"good movement from a fuller length, bending into then away from the left-hander"
"solid lines from round the wicket, Burns presses forward with hard hands, but the ball zips safely by"
"<B>oh dear, that's loose!</B> Very full and swinging, and Burns has a flat-footed drill into thin air"
"wider line, nip off the seam, no need to play this time"
"full length, swinging into the toes, driven hard into the covers"
"wider line, no stroke this time, probing away on a pretty full length, which is seems just the ticket in these conditions"
"fully forward, and pressed into the off side. Still not off the mark, but looking more composed at the crease now ..."
"very full, and punched down to mid-off. England still probing for that elusive first run"
"on the back foot, hops back and across to block back down the pitch"
"through to the keeper, no stroke offered once more"
"banging away outside off stump once more, left alone"
"on the toes, too straight from Roach and <B>clipped supremely out through square leg!</B> He played that shot beautifully in Barbados, and has picked up where he left off"
"stretching forward as Roach adjusts his line and length, fuller and wider outside off"
"<B>edged to second slip and Burns is done for!</B> Finds the perfect line and length this time, angled in from round the wicket, demanding a crease-bound defensive prod, and Holder stoops low in the cordon to scoop up a fine take for a big unit"
"over the wicket now from Roach, and tucked to the leg side to get off the mark instantly. Denly looks on enviously"
"<B>full and so straight!</B> Denly completely misses that, and that's surely got to be close! West Indies <B>review</B> and little wonder. Did it nip too much? Going over the top? That's the only thing that's saving him ... <B>umpire's call on leg stump!</B> Just a fraction too much of the ball was deemed to be missing leg, but my God, that was as out as they come, in all honesty!"
"inswing on a full length from Gabriel, but Bairstow is equal to the challenge, watching it carefully onto a leg-side clip"
"climbs off the seam, through to the keeper"
"finally, <B>Denly is off the mark</B>. Another inswinger, yorker length, and tapped cautiously to short cover for the single. Lucky, lucky chap"
"<strong>driven loosely at a full length! </strong> No foot movement, as Bairstow was lining up the inswinger, and was lured into the poke outside off"
"outside off again, through to the keeper"
"through to the keeper once again with good carry, a bit of inswing this time. Challenging line and length, allied to good aggression"
pressed forward into the off side
tucked to the leg side
"leaning forward, head over the ball"
"banged in short, and Bairstow sways inside the line. One for the over"
forward and pushed into the off side
"bigger stride this time, meeting the full length with an angled bat, out to point"
forward and blocked back down the pitch
"<strong>pop!</strong> This one bursts off a good length, kicking into the splice as Denly manages to ride the bounce and steer it down into the cordon. Well played in the end"
"wider line, fuller length, no need to play at that one"
"<B>beautiful drive!</B> Not quite as well timed as it appeared, but that was right in his slot, overpitched and wide of off stump. Hauled back in, just inside the cover boundary"
"very full again, and seaming away. Left alone"
through to the keeper again. It's tough work out there!
"wide on the crease, a bustling full length, flicked with the angle through the leg side"
"probing angle back into the stumps, defended firmly back down the pitch"
worked into the leg side once again. A productive area for YJB this morning
"punched on the up, off the back foot, out to point"
"angled bat, stabbed out to the off side"
"stretching onto the front foot, and defended back down the pitch"
"<B>short, wide, a toe-ended long-hop to the keeper!</B> Oh my goodness, that is a limp, miserable way to go. A horrid loosener, luring a flat-footed flap, and scuffed through to the keeper! The end of a thoroughly non-descript first Test innings. But at least there's room for improvement when his second chance comes about"
"through to the keeper, no stroke offered"
"<B>another long hop, another slash, and inches short of point!</B> Roston Chase thought he was quids in, but that just died on him as he stooped to scoop!"
"outside off, shaping away, through to the keeper"
"a bit of nibble from a fuller length, zipping away"
"<B>well bowled!</B> Fast and straight, just back of a length, but climbing sharply towards Bairstow's upraised bat. West Indies have got their game faces on again!"
"full length, probing line, left alone"
"curling away on a full length again! That's a lovely teasing delivery, no great pace, but areas, areas, areas."
"more movement on a full length as Root stretches forward to defend to the off side, advancing out of the crease in 
 a premeditated fashion"
more calmly left alone this time
"wider on the crease, angled in, more lovely shape off the pitch as Root leaves alone"
"straighter line, stabbed to the leg side. A maiden from the metronome"
"pitched up, floaty half-volley in the channel, looking to draw an indiscretion... left alone"
"length ball, coming in and blocked into the covers, YJB thinks about one before being sent back"
"good length outside off, 139kph/86mph as Bairstow gets into line and shoulders arms"
"oof, <b>close to the edge!</b> There was a noise, too, as the ball went through... but no appeal. Think that stayed a touch low as Bairstow aimed a cut"
presses out and shows this the full bat face in defence
"full, too full, and punched back past the bowler's outstretched hand, couple past mid-off"
"short of a length, climbing up towards the armpit as Root rides it in defence"
"length, straightening in the channel, fourth-stump line and Root watches it through - again the ball keeps a smidge low"
"touch shorter, rising through in the corridor as Root moves across and leaves"
"length but a touch wide, Root steps forward and lets this go"
"does him, <b>that's a boomerang ball from Holder!</b> Curved in and then out, like a tight corner on Scalextric, past the dangled bat"
"takes the edge this time, <b>but it flies between the gullies for four!</b> Touch lucky, but he just managed to keep it down"
"back of a length outside off, YJB lets this one go"
"<b>picks up four attempting to leave!</b> Bairstow wanted to withdraw the bat, the ball jumped a little on him, scooted away past gully once again"
"pitched up and tapped for one, off the toe of the bat into a gap at cover"
"gets a touch straighter, tucked down to the leg side"
"full, 141kph outside off, YJB watches it through"
"rising from a length but again the line is wide, Bairstow leaves it be"
"back of a length, Root works it off his hip"
"short and <b>slashed over the slips for four!</b> Width and it was a calculated risk, cutting with a flourish and it bounces away"
shuffles into line and holds his bat up out of the way
"shortish, 125kph/78mph outside off, watches it by"
"sliding in, YJB gets across and blocks"
"full length, Bairstow plants the front foot and <i>creams</i> a straight drive... into the stumps at the non-striker's end!"
"jeepers! Brutal bounce, hits the top of the bat handle - <b>and Hope catches the rebound after Campbell gets a hand on it!</b> Un-play-able, Root snatching his hand away as if touching a hot pan; the ball looped up, up, up and seemingly away from the grasp of the back-pedaling Campbell, at third slip, but he managed to tip up and Hope circled round from gully to complete a top bit of fielding!"
"fired in straight, Buttler blocks on off stump"
gets into line and defends softly
"short of a length, zipping through in the channel outside off, Buttler lets this one go"
"back of a length, 137kph/85mph, tucked down to the leg side"
"short outside off, again he can let this one go"
"short of a length, rising up to hit the splice/glove as YJB pats it down"
"full, that's a juicy drive ball, <b>Bairstow smashes it back through mid-off!</b> SHout of 'catch!' from Holder, but extra cover wasn't getting near it"
"short ball, nibbling away, he rides the bounce and <b>blaps through point for four more!</b> Bairstow throwing counters, with England on the ropes!"
"full, just outside off, lets this one through"
"shorter, outside off, again Bairstow doesn't commit"
"overpitched and YJB seizes on it, <i>crrrrrrrruuuuuuuunches</i> another straight drive through the V for four. Eventful over!"
"angled in, worked off the pads for his first run"
"length ball, hits the seam - <b>ghosted through him!</b> Straight over the stumps from Joseph, past the inside edge, YJB can only grin ruefully in response"
"full, in the slot, <b>beautifully timed down the ground!</b> Another boundary for Bairstow, stroking it cleanly through mid-on"
"short ball, clumped through the covers this time! <b>Bairstow swats up and away in front of square</b>, getting into his work now"
"tighter lines, defended coming across"
"short of a length outside off, lets this go"
"pitched up, Buttler is on the walk and defends around his toes outside off"
"good length, 121kph/75mph and nibbling away outside off, leaves this one alone"
"lavish movement for Holder, angled in with the arm and then sidestepping like JPR Williams as Buttler comes across and plays inside the line"
"length, covers the line in defence"
"superb ball, rising up to beat an uncertain prod in the channel"
"comes down, extra bounce finds the edge - <b>gottim!</b> Balloons off the shoulder of the bat, straight to second slip, and England sink further in the Antiguan sand! Holder strikes now, Buttler's tactic of leaving the crease fails to work as he becomes the latest top-order bat to come a cropper on this green surface"
"good length outside of, Bairstow lets this one go"
"shortish, room to free the arms, battered to backward point"
"touch short, 142kph/88mph outside off and holding its line, left alone"
"full, tempting the drive, swing and a miss from YJB"
"pitched up, fourth-stump line at 145kph/90mph. comes off the outer half of the bat to backward point"
gets on to the front foot and leaves
"stays over the wicket, angled across the left-hander, short and left alone"
"back of a length, straighter and worked away off the pads to get going"
"fullish, nipping away outside off, left alone"
"similar line, Bairstow leans out and leaves"
"pitched up, shaping away as the batsman comes across and lets it go"
"pitched up, and BOOM! <b>Bairstow leans back and gives it some welly over extra cover!</b> Outrageous shot, really, on the first morning of a Test in which your team has already lost four wickets... But my, he struck that sweetly!"
"yikes! Full toss from Gabriel, clipped nonchalantly off his hip by Stokes... Just an 142kph/88mph beamer, there"
"short on off stump, 144kph/89mph and climbing through, YJB drops the hands"
"dug in, wide of the stumps and Bairstow hurls the bat, <b>clears the leaping Holder at second slip!</b> Deliberately done, I think"
"full outside off, rifled on the drive through cover-point! <b>An emphatic way to bring up your fifty!</b> Bairstow is on it like a car bonnet, today - much to the delight of the travelling Barmies in the stands"
"length outside off, rapid from Gabriel... Bairstow nods it through"
"touch short, <b>150kph/93mph this one</b>, but YJB just watches it coolly through outside his off pole"
"dollied up wide of the stumps, pushed through and left alone"
plunges forward to defend on off
"flighted, met on the front foot"
"lobbed up, <b>skittish sweep from Stokes</b>, goes hard at the ball but fails to connect"
floated up and blocked into the covers
"spinning away outside off, lets this go"
"fired in at the batsman, YJB rides it and nudges in front of midwicket for one"
"round the wicket, speared in but it's a touch leg side, Stokes gives it a pat on the behind and sends it scooting to fine leg"
"another low full toss, 145kph/90mph, clipped through midwicket in front of the sweeper for a couple"
"pitched up, that's a better line, a foot or so outside off and Stokes leaves"
"full length outside off, bunted towards mid-on"
"this stops a touch, 143kph/89mph and Stokes pokes it awkwardly into the on side, the ball lands safely - and that will be <b>lunch</b>, with West Indies showing an undiminished appetite from Barbados"
"outside off, jagging away, no stroke offered"
"<B>oh my word, that is so close!</B> Full and straight, if Bairstow hasn't inside-edged this, he is toast! <B>West Indies review</B>. He just played the wrong line, and there's clear daylight ... what's this hitting, then? <B>Smashing leg stump!</B> Umpire Gaffeney hasn't got himself very well calibrated today, that's two big decisions he's not given. But that is also vindication for DRS. And well, England are rocking, in the distinctly non-horns-up-dude sense"
"flat-footed, crease-bound stab to a full length. Hmm... not entirely convincing"
stabbed into the off side once more
"<strong>a loose, wafty drive</strong>, Moeen is so conscious of the short ball, he can't get his feet moving for the half-volley"
"a big booming outswinger, looking to lure another flat-footed waft, but too much room on that occasion!"
"more confident punch this time, better weight transfer as he finds the gap at long-on for his first runs of the series"
"a compact drive from a full length, a good sprawling stop at mid-off"
"<B>savage lifter from a good length!</B> Absolutely brutal ball, rearing into Stokes' thumb from round the wicket. He flings his bat to the ground with a groan as the ball loops high into no-man's land behind square"
"well played, Ben Stokes. Puts the last brute out of his mind, strode forward into a full-length prober, and drilled clean down the ground with a high followthrough"
"short, sliding down the leg side, swivel-pulled to backward square"
"short, sharp, hoicked out to the leg side, without much care or attention it has to be said. Two men lurking in the deep, but he didn't quite connect well enough to reach them"
"fully forward, punched to the leg side"
"full length from round the wicket, lifting off a good length but well left alone"
"firmly forward, pushed back down the pitch"
"full toss, very low, very straight. Stabbed firmly back to the bowler"
"outside off, open-faced glide into the off side"
"full again, Moeen leans forward once again, feet still glued to leg stump, but he's finding the middle a bit more now"
squirted down through the cordon. Gully stretches across to his right but can't intercept
"pulled, down in front of square, rolling the wrists on impact"
"<B>spanged on the badge!</B> Moeen leans back into the pull, but that short ball was onto him like a freshly stepped-on rake. Clunk!"
"poked into the off side, and Stokes, manfully, hustled him through for the single. Good teamwork, getting his buddy out of a hole"
"whooshing drive to a full-length delivery, inside-edged onto the pads"
bouncer. Stokes ducks. Eyes on the ball all the way. That's the way to do it
"<B>edged and gone!</B> That's another absolute beauty from Gabriel, pushing Stokes back into the crease from back of a length, angling in to demand a defensive poke, then nipping away to take the edge. A simple catch for Dowrich and England are deep in the soup!"
"full length, tucked to the leg side"
"oof, close! Angled in, grazing past the off stump as Moeen leaves alone"
"a wafty flog, roughly through the line of the ball. That's how I play all my drives. Any old portion of the bat will do! Thwacked through long-on"
"outside off, no stroke this time"
pushed back down the track
urgh... another revolting flat-footed waft. Finds thin air this time. Just as well really
"hoisted round the corner, that's excellently middled, and placed, bissecting the men behind square to bring up England's hundred. Hurrah!"
"full length, speared into the toes"
tucked to midwicket for the single
"angled into the pads, can't work it away"
"<strong>fierce pace!</strong> That rears at Moeen's gloves, but luckily for him it is half a yard outside off. Draws a loose involuntary stab nonetheless"
"fuller length from round the wicket, angled prod into the gully"
full length and blocked back down the track
"whanged down on a good length outside off, no stroke offered"
"angled to the leg side, swept up by midwicket"
"a paddle pull from Moeen, picking up another short ball with a very deliberate dump into the leg side. No ducking from Mo today"
"over the wicket, full and straight, punched back down the pitch"
"a plink down the ground, was aiming high over the leg side but skewed over the bowler's head instead. Mid-on gives chase"
"outside off, wide line, full length, through to the keeper"
"<B>short and sharp again!</B> Round the wicket with that nasty cramping line, and that has Moeen sniffing the leather in the most literal sense!"
"better from Mo, sliding back and across to press defensively into the off side. His feet moved that time, which is progress!"
"punched firmly into the off side, well stopped with a dive"
forced back into the crease with extra lift from a full length
"full length, met in the blockhole with a vertical blade, punched into the covers"
"outside off, left alone"
"ploughing that furrow, through to the keeper once more"
"tight line, lifting off the deck, and blocked"
"outside off, no stroke offered, a hint of nibble away from the bat"
firmly forward
left alone to clock up another maiden
"good pace on a tight probing line, a bit of bend back into the left-hander, who blocks"
"squeezed very fine, good opportunistic run-pilfering. Joseph strays onto the legs, and that brings up <B>11,000 first-class runs for Moeen</B>. See, he can bat!"
"outside off, nudged down into the cordon"
"a flashing drive, weight not quite into the stroke as short cover collects"
"swished out to point, with a flash of the wrists. Slightly wider, but a good back of a length"
"splatted into the leg-side, Foakes wipes his bat across the line, not dissimilar to the sort of not-quite-shot that Jack Russell might have played. Midwicket gathers"
"on the back foot, punched out to the leg side"
shoulders arms from round the wicket
"<strong>another dirty hack across the line! </strong>Looking to heave on the up through the leg side, but doesn't make proper contact"
"outside off, and climbing through to the keeper with good wheels"
"<B>well bowled!</B> A bit of swing back into the left-hander from a full length, but Moeen, to his credit, watches the ball well into the middle of a leg-side clip"
"on the back foot, tucked to the leg side. No need for a run-out!"
"outside off, trampoline bounce from a full length. Drive that at your peril!"
"<B>nibble and bounce!</B> This is a lovely line, full length, a bit of swing, and hitting the seam. Everything in working order"
keeps low this time as Foakes lines up a cut
"probing line and length, not over-exerting himself, just testing the batsmen's patience"
"well bowled again, pounding out a full length, through to the keeper again"
"zipping off the deck yet again, left alone, and that will be <B>drinks</B>"
"Holder trundles in and puts this on a length outside off, shaping away and Moeen leaves"
"short ball, well-directed and it seems to keep coming back at Moeen as he thinks about cutting and then tries to drop the hands, swaying back like a man carrying a tray of drinks and trying to avoid a wasp"
"back of a length on leg stump, worked down into the leg side"
"pitched up, across the bows, Moeen lets this one go"
"too full, <b>Moeen strokes it back down the ground</b>, lovely bit of timing and it runs away to long-off"
"pitched up around off stump, this time he taps down on it defensively"
"length, nibbling back from a fourth-stump line, stays low as Foakes jabs down, the ball rebounds back but safely off the pads"
"length, 135kph/84mph outside off, good carry as the batsman gets across and leaves"
"short ball, width on offer for Foakes, who hangs back and steers four through backward point - <b>England's best partnership in terms of runs now</b>, too"
"fullish, mistimed on the drive towards mid-off"
"fired in towards the pads, Joseph belts out and appeal... maybe a touch leg side, Foakes flicking across the line"
comes forward and blocks on off stump
"lobbed up wide of the stumps, Moeen immediately swings for the hills - <b>carved up and over cover</b>, bounces away to the rope"
pushed through quicker and steered square for one
"over the wicket to the right-hander, Foakes comes forward and pushes the ball back"
"angled in, not much sign of turn as Foakes taps it away"
"tossed up, worked to leg"
"strangled shouts of excitement as Foakes flicks at a leg-side delivery... Dowrich couldn't hold on, neither could short leg plunging forward! Not sure he hit it, anyway"
"full toss, Moeen dabs it through the covers and then scuttles back for a second as Gabriel wanders after the ball from mid-off"
"good line from Joseph, tailing away in the channel and it draws an uncertain prod"
"full and wide, <b>Moeen flays it through point</b>, juicy stuff and he's a batsman who loves to tuck in when the opportunity is there!"

"left alone once more, slightly wider line from back of a length"
"shaping away on a fuller length, <B>Moeen is beaten </B>as the ball curls past his edge. Tidy"

"back of a length, inside-edged into the midriff, and away to safety"

"good lift off the deck once more, Moeen leaves alone"
"<B>Moeen is gone!</B> It looks a horribly tame dismissal, but that surely kicked from a good length.

"full face, defended back down the pitch"
"wider on the crease, pounded through on a full length, left alone"
"<B>short, pulled, splattered onto his own stumps!</B> That's a desperate way to go, he climbed into another wayward leg-side delivery, but was early on the shot, and an awkward deflection off his gloves flew down into the bails, via his hip"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
"<B>extra bounce, and another one bites the dust!</B> That's lovely bowling from Roach, drawing the batsman forward as this one sticks in the pitch, pops off the splice, and Holder's posting of a fourth slip pays off for Windies!"

"<B>yorker! And that's it!</B> Anderson was convinced it was the bouncer coming up, and was already galloping off towards the square-leg umpire in anticipation. A futile flail of the bat, but his timbers are shivered, and that's England's innings cooked!"

"full length outside off, through to the keeper"
"<B>That. Is. Unplayable!</B> A real spring in Broad's step now! Angled into the left-hander, and <I>exploding</i> off the seam! Bairstow takes it above his head from a full length!"

"tighter line, lifting into the midriff"
"<B>a zinger!</B> Outside off and bursting off the seam, through to the keeper once more!"
hops into line on the back foot. Broad is visibly bouncing back to his mark... he's feeling it...
"<B>massive appeal from Broad!</B> Round the wicket, thudding into the pads, but the instinct is that that was too high. Even Broad interrupted his own celebrappeal to petition the umpire, which was a clue..."

comes across and defends
"full on off,  Campbell tucks into a firm straight drive, times it nicely fine of mid-off and that'll runs away - <b>first boundary of the innings</b>"

plants the front foot and defends with an open face
"full, on off, clipped firmly back to the off side, Moeen dives across to cut it off"

sliding in with the arm and nudged off the hip
"round the wicket to the southpaw, left alone in the channel"
"back of a length, Campbell attempts to leave, <b>and steers it straight to slip!</b> Or does he...? Campbell immediately <b>reviews</b>, seemingly confident that it wasn't bat that diverted the ball; and sure enough, replays show it came off his forearm - close to the glove, but not close enough to be out. Good review, and <b>the decision is overturned</b>, Campbell stays"

"angled in straighter and chopped off the body, rolls into the leg side"

"length outside off, holding its line through to the keeper"
"presses out, tries to leave as the ball straightens and again ends up playing it, off the face of the bat to gully"

"straighter line and flicked away, slightly aerial but safe through backward square leg"
"length on off stump, presses out and defends"
"drops a tad short, Campbell rocks back and whirls a pull down to fine leg"
"pitched up and punched back down the pitch. Anderson is chuntering away here, too. West Indies scoring all sorts of psychological points"
"back of a length, Campbell attempts a short-arm pull, <b>gets a top edge into his upper arm</b> and it loops away to safety. Broad stands there looking at him quizzically, like some strange specimen he doesn't know how to classify"

round the wicket pitched up and met coming forwards with a dead bat

"full, another booming inny, clips the inside edge as he defends, the ball runs square"
comes across and dabs into the covers to keep the strike
"dug in, Campbell pulls and a top edge goes sailing into the leg side... <b>but Bairstow hasn't quite got the legs to get there!</b> No chance for Moeen running in from the fence, and YJB gave it everything. Broad just stands there holding his hands to his face"
left alone in the channel
"full, tailing in, thudding into the pads and Broad asks the question...! <b>Heading down leg</b>, I think"
"hits a length, this bounces up to kiss the gloves as he presses forward"

"length, nipping away, but wide enough for Brathwaite to leave well alone"
"pitched up, Brathwaite has a dip this time - <b>slashed up and over the slips for four!</b> For Broad, now read Stokes. Dame Fortune seems to have a soft spot for the batsmen this morning"

"touch short and wide, lets it go"
"length outside off, <b>flipped high into the air</b>... but well back over mid-on and it bounces away to the rope! Nearly the same shot as Moeen got out to yesterday"

"fullish, stroked towards point"
"pitched up outside off, Campbell leans into an uppish drive, bobbles away towards long-off for a few more"
"speared in on off stump, holding its line enough to catch the leading edge - but it squirts low into the covers"
"Stokes finds the edge - <b>and this time Buttler holds on!</b> Success for England at last, as Campbell again misses out on a maiden Test fifty. He's had more lives than your average alley cat, but finally pushes a little too forcefully at one off the back foot, steering the ball to second slip"
"fullish length, Hope comes across on off and defends"

"grunt from Anderson, back of a length and this takes off, that's a jaffa but Brathwaite keeps his cool and makes sure he gets well out of the way"

comes across and covers the line
"length ball, jabbed into the leg side"
"fired in with the fury of a bowler scorned, more fuss-free dead-batting from Brathwaite"
"<B>Stunning take down the leg side by Bairstow!</B> Huge appeal from England, but umpire Dharmasena is unmoved. Rightly so, as that was off the hip. But Jonny, gosh .. one handed, at full stretch. Foakes dropped one like that in Barbados, I'll have you know..."

"wide on the crease, angling in, beating the outside edge. Well bowled again"
"up on the toes, clunked into the covers. Hard deck-hitting from Stokes once more"

"soft hands, angled bat, poached boundary through the cordon. Easy"
pushed back into the crease to defend this time

"outside off, through to the keeper"
"<strong>zing!</strong> Stokes hits that ridge once more, wide of off though, as the ball fizzes safely past Brathwaite's nose"
pushed back onto the stumps
<B>another spicy lifter!</B> Stokes thumps the deck with lovely angle back into the right-hander. Brathwaite hops and keeps his hands low enough to avoid contact

"scuds through a touch low, into a defensive block"
pushed onto the back foot to poke into the off side
"<B>nearly poked back to the bowler!</B> Hope is sent hopping back into his stumps, an uppish prod loops off the splice, but dies inches short as Stokes clatters through. Nothing is going for England today!"
"outside off, through to the keeper again"
<strong>panned down the ground!</strong> Curran's weakness is the floaty one outside off. Too easy for Brathwaite to free his arms and splat the ball past the in-field
"better length, much fuller and straighter, zips through to the keeper"
big carry down the leg side as Brathwaite jabs his gloves at the ball
"a mistimed drive, a bit of a half-volley, but can't capitalise"

back of a length and worked to midwicket
"full on off stump, punched nearly but straight to mid-off"
"oh my word, <b>he's nutmegged himself but the ball misses leg stump!</b> The England players are all on their knees, Hope chopped down in defence and the ball spun back sharply, but <b>just</i> past the woodwork"

"pushed through, worked off the hip for a single"
defended on off stump
pushed through and Bravo gets an inside-edge to backward square leg
"short and rising past the bat, <b>another strangled appeal from England</b>... Broad knew he'd missed it, gives him a stare and turns to return to his mark"
"<b>he's feathered this one, though!</b> Broad has his reward, inducing a rather scrambled back-foot prod from Hope... A punch of the air, and all that pent-up emotion is released! First wicket of the day for Broad, who's had to work hard for it. Seemed to roll his ringers down the side of the ball, a lickle legcutter and Hope fenced away from his body"
"back of a length outside off, Chase gets across and shoulders arms"
"spitting from back of a length, smashes the shoulder of the bat - <b>but flies past the dive of Buttler!</b> Would have gone straight to third slip, you know, but England had stationed sort of two-and-a-half, and it flew through the gap"
"shoots low, <b>castled him!</b> Broad bursts through, vintage stuff from the big, bad, better-than-his-dad lad! Chase had narry a chance of keeping that out, hitting a length and scuttling through to knock off stump out of the ground! Chase left on his knees, poor sod. An old-fashioned Broad-side rocks West Indies"

"top of off, 137kph/85mph and it thuds into the splice of the bat as Hetmyer defends coming forwards"
"superb line, nips past the bat, half an appeal from behind the stumps - <b>clipped the back leg on its way through!</b> Not much Hetmyer could do about that, apart from not hit it"
"short and a touch wide, shoulders arms"

<strong>leaping past the edge!</strong> Anderson finds that ridgy back-of-a-length
"a cautious stab from deep in the crease, slightly reluctant to come forward after that last nut"
"<B>dropped!</B> A brilliant diving finger-tipped effort from Rory Burns, pouncing forward and to his left. He made brilliant ground to a fast flat drive, but having got there, he should have clung on!"
"<B>clattered through third man!</B> You let me off, I give you licks. Fair's fair"
"round the wicket, a very straight line, angling into the knee roll"
"stabbed out to the off side, and that's good opportunistic running"
pressed into the off side
"<B>no they can't!</B> A miserable, leg-sided pie from Moeen, dragged down and straight into Hetmyer's arc. He needed no second invitation to slam that into the stands!"
"stretching forward, looking for the big shot but it's not there this time"
"<B>skewed into the deep, where Anderson takes a blinder!</B> That's the way to do it! Hetmyer galloped to the pitch, didn't quite get there, aimed a wild hack out to cover, where Anderson sprinted across, tumbled forward, pouched the chance, and boots the ball away in a self-righteous fury!"
angled defence into the gully
"forward once more, eased into the off side"
nudged out to backward square to get off the mark

"wide line, and chopped into the cordon off an under-edge"
"another bit of extra nip off the deck, through to the keeper"
"<B>takes the edge but beats second slip!</B> A fine delivery from Stokes, but England's lack of commitment to their cordon costs them again. It might not have carried, but it might have been intercepted"

"through to the keeper, no stroke offered again"
into line outside off and defended
"well bowled again, but <B>yet another edged boundary!</B> England have leaked runs through their cordon all day.  Some can be put down to accidents, but in a game of fine margins, it's becoming costly"

"looped into the toes, clipped to mid-on for a sharp single"
"on the pads, fenced through the leg side"

leaning onto the front foot to block back to the bowler
"pounding out a good length outside off stump, no stroke offered"
"good ball again, edged again, Stokes is making things happen from a middle-and-off line, almost over-compensating for the variable bounce. Squeezed through point in a hurried flurry of limbs"
firmly into line to defend
"<B>full, and dipping late!</B> That's a fine delivery, doodlebugging down to the crease, but a thin inside-edge saves Bravo from a raucous lbw appeal!"
"bouncer, as well he might. Ducked"
"good lift from a fuller length, left alone"
sliding into the pads from round the wicket
"well bowled, pushed across the right-hander and straightening off the deck"

"good length, arrowing in on off stump, blocked towards point"
"gallumphs in, hits a fullish length and Dowrich drives uppishly, bobbles towards mid-on"

"good length on off, jabbed watchfully into the covers"
"holds its line, rising outside off and turning Dowrich round, taken on the bounce by a leaping Burns at gully"
fitred in straight and tucked to the leg side

back of a length and sliding down the leg side
"shortish and shaping away, 133kph/82mph and left alone as Dowrich comes across"

"over the top of off, shows it a straight bat in defence"
"short and sliding down the leg side, flick and a miss"
"comes across, prodded into the covers and there's a moment's indecision before Bravo thinks better of running"
short and wide and <del>carved gloriously over cover-point</del> plinked to cover... That ball maybe stopped in the pitch slightly
"skidding into the thigh pad, leg side and it deflects square, again he's sent back"
"over the wicket now, pitched up and zipping through wide of the stumps"
"good length on off, stays a touch low but Bravo is equal to it"
on the stumps and nurdled for one
"oof, not sure about that shot... full and tempting outside off, Bravo tries to send this 300 yards down the fairway with his two wood, but connects only with fresh air"
"full and sliding in to hit the pads, Broad goes up for lbw but that was optimistic, deflects away fine for a couple"
"good length, shaping away as Bravo comes across and can leave comfortably enough"
"<b>dropped!</b> Maybe... Put down at slip, but <b>I think that was a bump ball</b>, though the England players have their hands on their heads. Buttler again, though hard to tell if it would have been given out or not. Best to take the catch and then let the umpires decide!"
lets this one go outside off
"full and swinging late, nicely timed back down the pitch, though, hits the non-striker's stumps and deflects for a couple"
"nip-backed, thuds into the pad - given by Chris Gaffaney! Dowrich <b>reviews</b>, though, and it's shown to be going over leg stump! So that's <b>another decision overturned</b>, Gaffaney this time giving one out that wasn't!"
length on off and poked to cover
"full and seaming past the attempted drive, struck on the back leg - <b>no, says Gaffaney!</b> Once bitten... Maybe a touch high, and England decide not to chance a review"

again Bravo comes across and leaves it be
"Broad continues to hang the ball out wide, not doing too much there, left again"

"length ball, jabbed away via an inside edge"
pitched up and clipped through square leg
"length around off, defended"
"touch full, that's a lovely bit of timing from Dowrich, <b>pinged back down the ground</b>, a controlled punch past the persevering Anderson!"

"fullish, turned to the leg side"
"length on middle and off, defended down to the leg side"
"dug in short on the stumps, Bravo taps stoically down to the leg side"
"pitched up, in the corridor of uncertainty but Bravo has got his protractor in his pocket, steps out and confidently shoulders arms"

"good length in the channel, holding its line, no stroke"
"short ball, sailing through as he ducks"

squirted through the off side for one
"full ball, this swings late but Bravo still connects pretty solidly on the drive, Stokes getting a hand down in his follow through"
pitched up and left alone outside off
"close for Broad again! Gets him feeling for it a couple of inches outside off, still no dice, though"
angled in straight and tucked off the pads - <b>fifty stand between these two</b>
"over the wicket, fullish around off stump, defended to leg with the bat turning in his hands"
"gottim, a mule of a ball! <b>Kicks from a length, jams into the glove and lobs to slip!</b> Dowrich is prised out by another spiteful delivery, crunching the bottom thumb as he tried to get forward. Broad picks up wicket number three"
"full length, a touch wide and he calmly watches it through"
"low full toss, that's clipped the pad and runs away to fine leg... England think it was in line with leg stump and decide to <b>review</b>, though I think that's a bit of a punt. Yep, impact an inch or two outside leg, so not even umpire's call and <b>England will lose that review</b>"
"full and curving back, jumps to hit Bravo on the thigh as he reaches forward. Takes the blow and grits his teeth"
"chipped to leg, shouts of 'catch!' from England but it doesn't carry to midwicket"
"in the channel, this fizzes through at shoulder height as YJB takes"
pitched up and blocked on the front foot towards cover

"line and length but a touch wide, Holder again watches it zip by"
"pushed in with the arm, down the leg side as he comes across"
"snuck through,<b> is there an inside edge...?</b> No, indicates Dharmasena! Cleared the stumps, maybe just flicked the back leg, England went up in unison. But Holder wasn't having any of it"

"round the wicket, angled in, jabbed down into the crease"
"outside off, holding its line, another calculated leave from Bravo"

leaping off the pitch but on a wide line. Broad hasn't quite got it on a sixpence like he did this morning
"round the wicket, angling in, nipping away"
"through to the keeper, good discipline from Broad, and Bravo, but a distinct lack of threat in that over"
"full length, decent swing into the toes. Encouraging first signs"
"good lines, shaping across the right hander and curling towards the top of off. Blocked"
"firmly forward, and defended to the leg side"

"low full toss, pressed into the off side"
"jags from a full length, squeezed down into the cordon, gathered on the bounce in the gully"
"<B>savage lifter, and Bravo is struck on the forearm!</B> It wasn't especially short, but that just flew from a good length, snaking right towards the armpit! Couldn't get away from that as he raised his arm reflexively!"

cut into the covers
"outside off, nothing doing there"
firmly into line to defend back down the pitch
"curling away on an off-stump line, pressed out to point"
through to the keeper again
"<B>stunning from Holder</B>. Little wrong with the ball, nice curl back into the off stump, but Holder read the length like a billboard and leant into a firm straight drive, bat meeting ball clean on the half-volley"
through to the keeper again again
"outside off, curling away"
"full length, pushed across Holder's bows. No stroke this time"
angled down the leg-side
"bouncer from round the wicket, and this one really takes over. Bravo turns turtle"
"<B>more nasty bounce!</B> Lobs off the glove, out to leg gully, but there's no-one round the corner! With Stokes' angle, and the ridge, that seems an oversight"
<strong>zipping off the deck!</strong> Another fearsome lifter but wide of the upraised gloves
pressed into the covers
"good and probing from Stokes, attacking the stumps and squirted off the back foot to point"
"fenced off the back foot, out to cover"
"flogged off the front foot, not perfectly timed, but forces an energetic sliding stop from Buttler in the covers. He does well"
"worked off the pads, out to square leg"
"leg-sided, blocked to cover with a full face off the bat on the back foot"
full face of the bat once more. Straight back to the bowler
"leg-stump line, a defensive option with a hint of shape to off. Holder blocks once more"
"swaying inside the line of a well-directed short ball, angling into the batsman who keeps his hands low as he limbos"
drops the hands once more as Stokes drops short again
through to the keeper once more as Stokes tests the middle of the pitch. He's not letting up in this spell
"thumped in short yet again, as Bravo this time chooses to duck the straighter line"
"fuller length, good option, with the man pushed back into the crease, but he watches it well"
"<strong>attempted yorker. </strong>Canny from Stokes, but Bravo is wise to it. Very impressive effort, but he's got to be due a break before England break him"

"long levers, pumped down to long-on"
nudged to the leg side

into the off side
"wider on the crease, fizzed through to the keeper"
<B>sharp and straight!</B> Pinging off the deck and through to the keeper past a startled edge
<B>punched in the air but safe!</B> A toe-ended drive up and over the covers! Holder took a big stride but didn't quite get there. Plenty gaps in the field though

"full face, stabbed down into the off side, which prompts Moeen to move Jennings right under his nose"
"instant impact, as Bravo doesn't quite commit on the front foot and is beaten past the outside edge, much like Burns the other day"
stabbed into the covers for a single
"big stride, angled bat, defended into the leg side and Holder sets off for a risky but well-judged single"
leaning forward again to defend

"on the back foot, right behind the line of the ball"
<B>another zinger!</B> Stokes hits the ridge and nips another away from the lanky Holder

"poked into the off side, where Jennings continues to lurk"
forward with diligence once more
"pushed back into the crease, and nearly slides one into the pads. Bravo gets enough of a splinter of bat on ball to spare the lbw appeal"
"leaning forward, and pushed to silly point again"
"a yelped appeal, but that was just tight lines, no real lbw chance as Bravo hid bat behind pad"
"pressed onto the front foot, head over the ball again"
"punched down the ground, but off a fat inside edge. Mid-on swoops"
"driven once more, as Stokes strays a foot too full and is pumped on the up through the gap. Holder's big stride punishing any error in length"
"well played again, riding the bounce on off stump and deflecting down into the gully"
"straight lines, defended on the front foot."
<strong>zips past the edge once more.</strong> There's been so many balls like that in this innings. England will surely nick the lot when their turn comes
"full face, no way through. Stokes' work for the day is done. He'll need a good kip after that. And he beats the turf in frustration as he reverts to his fielding position"
"leaning forward, head over the ball. Jennings loiters on the corner of his vision like a nosy neighbour"
"<B>beats the edge</B>. Lovely line, Bravo not quite forward this time"

"wafted uppishly through the off side, he's off the strike, probably for the night ..."
"turn from outside off, as Holder slides back and across to defend"

"outside off, pounded through to the keeper"
"wide line, no stroke offered once more"
"squirted in the air, out through third man. That's useful runs, if a bit streaky. Well clawed back inside the rope"

"inside-edgy poke through the leg side, just leaning on the fuller length"
"rising into the hip, and well flicked through backward square as Moeen canters round"

"zipping through to the keeper once more, a buzzing length from Anderson"
"leaning half forward on the front foot, such long levers, there's no need to over-commit in defence"
"<B>snorter!</B> Holder can but hold his bat straight down the original line and pray, as this one zips from an off stump line, past the outside edge. Lovely"
"tucked into the covers, off the front foot"
"hitting the bat hard from a full length, angled into the off side"
"<B>pinned on the fingers as Broad gets one to kick!</B> But they get to pinch the single anyway as Broad under-arms into the stumps, and away to no-man's land"

thumps into the thigh pad as Anderson draga his length back
"on the pads, worked to the leg side"

"excellent leave on a full length, skimming over the bails"
"half an appeal from Broad as Bravo wears one on the knee-roll, but that was going over, and probably pitched outside leg too"
"back of a length again, an easy leave outside off"

"<B>edged, and safe!</b> Dies just short of the diving third slip and gully. Stokes I think gets a hand to intercept the boundary"
"good carry from back of a length, through to the keeper"
<B>beaten outside off</B>... fuller and tighter but there's just no catching that edge when it matters
"banged in short, there's a surprise! Over the wicket, straight over Bravo's lid as he ducks"
pushed onto the back foot to block
"flinched off the hip.... But Jennings, tumbling to his left, gathers well. No inside-edge on this occasion"
angled down the leg side
up on the toes to defend down into the leg side
"banged in short, Bravo rises to his toes to defend"
"<B>snicked and there's the breakthrough!</B> Reward at last for Anderson, who finds some extra bounce on a waspish back-of-a-length, just a touch of movement off the deck, and Bairstow tidies up!"
"lovely full-faced drive to open his account, clangs into the non-striker's stumps, and they run for the deflection"
"that's a lovely line from Jimmy, bending past the outside edge from a full length, as Bravo pokes loosely"

through to the keeper outside off stump
poked out to gully

forward and blocked to mid-on
firmly behind the line to block once more
forward and defended again. It's solid fare from the Windies
"on the hip, flicked calmly through the leg side"
more solid sounds of bat on ball as Roach gets into line once more
<B>big fat edge and up comes the 100 lead!</B> Kept it down just enough to elude the widest of the slips ... valuable runs in an attritional morning
"diligent defence, leaning onto the front foot to press to cover"
"beats the outside edge again, good lift but just can't snag a catchable edge"
"round the wicket, <B>and this one snaps at Bravo's fingers!</B> Nasty lift from a full length, and he wrings his hand in pain"
"fuller length, and <B>this one scuttles!</B> Well watched by Bravo, who digs it out at shin height"
"<B>beaten outside off!</B> Lovely line, lovely length, hint of movement. You can but pray you don't nick those"
"<B>massive flash!</B> And why not, it was wider and fuller, but it also jagged off the seam and past the edge"
"on the pads, flicked to the leg side"
"drilled into the deep, that's good concentration at the end of a testing over"
"<B>huge wipe outside off, and a fine flying take!</B> Roach threw the kitchen sink at a back-of-a-length lifter, a fat nick, rising all the time to the cordon, where Stokes adjusted well at second slip and clung on above his head! Another timely breakthrough"
flashed on the up into the covers
"full length, tight line, solid back-foot defence"
"well played once more, standing tall on the back foot to repel all comers"
"good leave on a tight line outside off, a fraction short from Anderson so Joseph's mind was quickly made up"
"<B>half an appeal as Joseph is rapped on the pad</B>, but that looked a touch high. A challenging over though"
"round the wicket, stabbed defence on the back foot"
"keeps low on the legs, but Bravo whittles the single to midwicket"
"through to the keeper, outside off again"
solidly clunked in defence
"overpitched from Broad, into the toes, and neatly clipped to midwicket"
Bravo dots it up to negotiate the first hour without personal alarm
"pitched up and <b>biffed straight back down the ground for four!</b> Joseph unfurls a lofted drive, high front elbow and it bounces away. Anderson's sympathy may be ebbing..."
"extra lift from a length, <b>hits the gloves and loops away</b>, lands safely behind square - no short leg in"
"angled across, climbing through in the channel"
"shortish, Bravo thinks about playing at and then drops the hands"
"fuller around off stump, presses out to defend"
"Anderson pitches the ball up, looking to take it across, blocked coming forwards"
"short and at the body, <b>Joseph pops the ball back up</b>... but it won't carry back to the bowler! Awkward length for a tall man to get out the way off"
"hits the bat handle again, attempting to flick it away, drops just in front of him"
"fuller, bluffing Joseph, who blocks coming forwards"
"short outside off, 126kph/78mph and he gets fully in behind it"
"length ball, angling in and tapped to the off side"
"dug in, rising towards the ribs and Joseph jabs it away, in the air but in front of short leg, lands safely"
pushed across the bows and Bravo gets a single going back on off to dab behind square
"shortish, still targeting the body, blocked on the crease"
"length ball, bouncing and nipping in to hit the thigh pad, high and leg side"
"stabbed towards point, quick single as the throw comes in... but Joseph was home, I think"
"short of a length, 129kph/80mph and tucked off the body"
angled across and steered towards backward point
"and he strikes with his first ball of the day, <b>edged low to third slip!</b> Stokes' line can often be challenging, just because of the way his arm comes over, and Joseph could only fend a rising ball to the cordon"
fired in back of a length and ducked
"short, rising over middle and off, tapped down to the on side"
"back of a length, 139kph/86mph and Gabriel stands up tall, bunts it down to short leg on the bounce"
"another bumper from Stokes, lets this one go"
"good length, 135kph/84mph and met with a straight bat - Gabriel does his bit, time for Bravo to have a dart?"
"round the wicket, tossed up on off, blocked"
"gives this some air, Bravo is forward and pushes it away"
touch straighter and tapped back to the leg side
"shorter and wide of the stumps, Bravo cuts to deep point... but turns down the run on offer"
"tossed up, Bravo dances down and <b>drills a flat six to long-off!</b> He moves on to 49, one ball left in the over"
"floated up, Bravo attempts to close the face to the leg side, gets a low leading edge to mid-off - no run there, so Gabriel will be on strike to Stokes"
"digs the ball in short, heading leg side as he raises his bat up out of the way"
"hits a length, maybe a cutter from Stokes, with the batsman back... ends up deflecting to slip off the hip"
shortish and turned calmly to leg

"full on off, 143kph/89mph but Gabriel is equal to it, bunted back"
"short of a length, comes across to defend again"
lobbed up and defended on off stump
"flighted, this spins a touch outside off, lets it skid through"
"ooh, dabbed off the back foot, <b>nearly carries to slip!</b> Stokes sticks out an instinctive paw but the ball bounced in front of him"
"flighted, on the stumps, worked into a gap on the leg side - <b>that's his half-century</b>, applauded around the ground! Fantastic stuff from Bravo, no matter how scratchy he was starting off. Been more than two years since he last raised his bat in a Test match"
tossed up and belted towards long-on for one
"walks down, some turn for Moeen, <b>and Bairstow completes the stumping!</b> Bravo was in for the long haul but that's the end of the road for him and West Indies, walks off for a round 50 after grafting his backside off for the cause"
"oh, that's come out wrong, <b>wanged down the leg side</b> and it doesn't give Dowrich much of a chance - five wides to start off!"
"finds his line, back of a length and defended jumping across on off"
"good length, 132kph.81mph outside off, swinging in a touch but after it has gone past the batsman"
"short ball, <b>proper throat ball</b>, rearing at Burns' mush from back of a length! He jerks his head out of the way at the last moment, in the approved style. Feisty!"
"touch short and wide, Burns creeps across and let sit go"
"shortish, 128kph/80mph and worked into a gap at midwicket, Burns off the mark"
"over the wicket to Denly, pushed down the leg side, Dowrich gets to this one"
"charges in from round the wicket, slings the ball down short, Burns prods it in the air but in front of short leg"
"banged in very short, 140kph/87mph and Burns sees it early, hunkers down in his trench as Dowrich leaps to take the ball above his head"
"more chin music, play it again Shan! <b>Pings off the glove and flies towards leg gully!</b> No one stationed there, though, and he gets off strike"
"back of a length, outside off and he can let this one go"
"closer to the stumps, jabbed down square from the crease"
"slides the ball down leg, 142kph/88mph as Denly tickles across the line but doesn't connect"
"short of a length outside off, Burns gets low and steers a dab-cut towards backward point"
"in the channel, 134kph as Burns comes across, no stroke"
"fired in straighter, a touch leg side and whipped fine for a single"
"short and slamming into the thigh pad as Denly plays across it, <b>doesn't quite carry to short leg</b>, Hetmyer reaching forwards... No bat involved, anyway"
"full, skidding on, <b>straight into the front pad</b> - Kemar likes it, Kemar <i>loves</i> it, but Kumar Dharmasena doesn't! Looked leg side to me, and Holder perhaps agrees as West Indies elect not to review"
comes across and blocks on off
"Gabriel slams the ball in halfway down, balloons over the crouching Burns"
"over the wicket now, 142kph/88mph bouncer, over the stumps and flying through"
"shortish on the hip, Burns taps it down from deep in the crease"
"dug in, chest high but angled across and slightly wide, Burns can sway out of the way"
"back round the wicket, hits a length on off as the batsman comes across to defend"
"touch short and tucked off the hip through backward square keg for one, meaning England go to <b>lunch</b> without loss"
"fired down the leg side once more. Lots of aggro from West Indies so far, but no such much accuracy..."
"that's a better line! Bursting past the edge from a full length outside off, round the wicket to the leftie"
"<B>fenced through third man</B>... soft hands from Burns, heading down all the way"
"outside off, keeps a touch low as Burns leaves alone"
"lifting off the seam this time, outside off as it holds its line. No stroke once more"
"<B>jaffa!</B> Such a tight initial line, fading in to cramp the left-hander, then bursting off the seam. Burns avoids fencing at it"
"stabbed into the off side, rising with the delivery on off stump"
attacking the splice with a tight line on a back of a length. Pushed on the up to cover
"well bowled again, kicking from a fuller length, forcing Denly to play it on his toes on the back foot, fenced out to point"
"<strong>short, and Denly climbs into a pull</strong> but it doesn't get up! Yikes, that skims past off stump by a whisker"
"angled into the pads, half an appeal, but clearly going down"
"<B>another reflexive pull, and Brathwaite at fine leg drops the top-edge!</B> That was a nasty lifter from Gabriel, Denly seems determined to play aggressively against the short ball come what may, but the chance went begging as Brathwaite sprawled forward to a looping steepler..."
"fuller length, tucked to midwicket"
"on the legs, and that's a freebie for Burns, who really misses out on those clips. A bit like the man he replaced at the top of the order..."
"a compact drive on a good length, gathered in the covers"
"<B>a wild flash</B>. The ball was there for a swish, but Burns' feet weren't"
"another leg-side flick, and this time that's an excellent connection. Good progress as England bring the deficit <B>below 100</B>"
sailing through to the keeper.
"<B>massive appeal but that could be sliding over!</B> Gabriel aims full and straight, and Denly is so late on it. But the captain is unconvinced by his bowler's petitions"
"<B>fizzer outside off stump!</B> This one kicks off the ridge, flying past the splice as Denly dangles his bat loosely in response"
"more confidently pushed out to point, half forward to the fuller length"
"<B>well played this time</b>, a fraction of width and a chance to free the arms. Belted firmly behind point for a welcome boundary"
attempted yorker but fired down the leg side. Dowrich gathers with a tumble
"short again, another swingeing pull, not timed once more, but the intent is plain. No messing about!"
"full and straight, met with a firm punch through long-on. Good contact"
"wide outside off stump, no stroke offered"
"that's a better line from round the wicket, shaping into Burns' favoured pads, but holding its line. Defended to the off side"
"lifting through the keeper, good kick off the deck as Burns leaves alone"
"<B>hustled on the back foot as Burns nearly plays on!</B> Similar to his first-Test dismissal, neutral bat, angling the ball down into the crease and back towards the timbers. He scuttles off the strike once he's ascertained the danger"
pushed into the covers with solidity
"<B>ripper from round the wicket!</B> Straightens with venom, like a snake under a steamroller, and zips past the edge"
"on the back foot, pressed out to point"
"good aggression once again, but off-line as Burns walks inside his stumps and lets the ball breeze past his armpit"
"very full, and straight. Dug out to the bowler"
tucked into the leg side
"angled down the leg side, good pace once again but not quite making enough balls count"
"probing away outside off, angling back into the stumps"
"fully forward, solid defence"
"tucked off the pads, looking more confident all of a sudden"
<B>spanked through the covers!</B> That's the way to do it! Denly finding his feet now after his early alarms. Over-pitched and beautifully balanced!
"firm defence, blocked back down the pitch"
"short and sharp, zipping past the nose"
pushed into the off side
nudged to the leg side
"banged in short, Burns sways inside the line"
on the pads and flicked firmly out to the leg side
short and hopping over the gloves as Denly leans back. Not really testing the technique with that length
"punched into the covers, off the back foot"
"<B>oh good lord, he'll make them play alright!</B> An aberration from Burns, back of a length from round the wicket, but angled into the body. Burns leans back into a ... what? A cut, an uppercut? But he doesn't factor in the lack of pace, and it's a simple flat-batted steer to Campbell in the slips!"
"good length outside off, from over the wicket. Left alone"
"wicket-to-wicket trundling, just the ticket for this deck. Pressed forward to defend"
"lovely line and length, no liberties to be taken when you are pounding it out on and around off stump. Blocked again"
"a fraction shorter, every bit as straight, tonked off the back foot to cover"
"on the toes, flicked to the leg side"
"<strong>attempted pull, and Denly wears this one!</strong> Right in the hip as he under-edges on the back foot"
"banged in short, and through to the keeper"
"on the back foot, a flashing pull to midwicket. Well intercepted"
"half-forward, bat and pad dangling in defence"
"<B>scuttles!</B> Angling in, hits that length, and Denly does well to adjust late and protect his timbers!"
"flat-footed drive, zipping past the outside edge"
"outside off, back of a length, Bairstow kneels inside the line"
"whisked off the pads, and worked to fine leg. Bairstow is rapid between the sticks"
"outside off, angling in, no stroke offered on a very tight line"
"attempted cut, keeps a fraction low, and Bairstow misses out as the ball skids through"
"<strong>pinged out through the leg side</strong>, that's too short at Holder's pace, and put away with aplomb"
"better line and length, a bit of jag outside off, YJB leaves alone"
"good pace from the outset, full and straight"
"pushed into the off side, off the back foot"
"good probing line, attacking that awkward spot on the pitch, and punched to the off side"
"<B>beauty!</B> Perfect length for this pitch, can't commit to the front foot, and when you aren't quite there, you never know what the ball will do. This one zips past the splice!"
"<B>kicks from a good length!</B> This is excellent from Joseph, dragging it back a foot and pinging into Denly's ribs. Short leg looks on"
"outside off, a more calm leave. Lively times!"
"length ball, sliding down the leg side as Bairstow flicks, gets something on it and the ball scuttles away"
"uff, <b>not far from chopping on!</b> Slightly loose prod from YJB, clips the inside edge but lands safely"
"back of a length on off, comes across and defends"
"short of a length outside off, coming in at Bairstow as he attempts to cut, <b>drags the ball past his stumps again!</b> Holder looking a bit miffed here"
"straighter line, still back of a length, 127kph/79mph and pulled through square leg for a couple"
"bowled 'im, <b>top of off!</b> Holder's nagging line brings reward, no bat on this one as Bairstow aims an expansive mow down the ground, just a <i>hint</i> of seam movement back in, and pop goes the weasel! Big wicket, England's buccaneering No3 sent back"
"touch short outside off, Denly gets into lina dn leave"
"in the channel, the line is a touch wide and Denly drops back, leaves it be"
"fuller, 134kph/83mph around fifth stump, again no stroke offered"
"shaping away, wide enough to leave"
"pitched up, invites the drive but it's not timed, trickles to extra cover"
"short of a length, 132kph/81mph and Denly chops down on it, well struck and well fielded this time"
"shouts of excitement as Holder brings the ball back in, Root gets into line"
"stays back and shows it the bat face, tapped down to the off side"
"length, 131kph/80mph and defended, falling over slightly to the off side"
tight lines and blocked into the covers
"length ball outside off, 79mph and nibbling through to the keeper"
"good length on off, Root bows his head over a solid block"
"short ball, climbing through outside off as Denly has a yahoo at it... fails to connect. Steady!"
"good length in the channel, lets this one go"
"back of a length, 140kph/87mph around the line of off, Denly blocks coming forwards combatively"
"banging away around fourth stump, defended again"
"wide on the crease, speared in at 142kph/88mph and this clatters into Denly's inner thigh as the Windies appeals fade on the grounds of height... That'll be tender in the morning"
"pitched up, a tempter outside off, nothing doing from the Kent man"
"length on off, steered towards backward point"
"flicked down the leg side, <b>Dowrich goes springing after it</b>, but won't get there! Fantastic leaping effort as Root glanced fine, but that gets him off the mark with a boundary"
hung out wide of the stumps and left alone
"shortish on the body and dropped down into the leg side, Denly calls him through"
"hits a length, sneaking back in to hit the back leg... <b>Holder belts out and appeal</b>, but I think that was high. Ah, there was an inside edge, too"
"length on off, 128kph/79mph and blocked coming forwards"
"full and wide and Joseph R goes back to Joseph, A to steer a couple past gully - first runs Alzarri has conceded today, in fact"
"length ball, defended coming across his stumps"
"puff of dust off a length, prancing to beat the inside edge, there's a sound on the way through but Joseph doesn't appeal. Holder, however, decides to <b>review</b>, on the basis of some sixth sense... <b>and Root looks to be in trouble!</b> UltraEdge picks up a scrap of glove before the ball clips his hip, and <b>the decision will be overturned!</b> The England captain doesn't agree, it seems, but he's on his way, Rod Tucker telling Chris Gaffaney to belatedly raise the finger"
"pounding away in the channel, left alone"
"tighter line, climbing up to hit the label as Buttler defends on off"
"fired down in the corridor, 139kph/86mph and Buttler lets it go once again"
"comes forward, pushes in front of mid-off and they pinch one... the ball then ricocheting away off a direct hit for a second"
"fullish length, defended on the front foot"
angling in and worked to the leg side
"fuller, Denly loses his footing flicking through backward square, which probably scuppers the chance of two"
"oooohhh yeeeeaaaah, lovely line from Holder, taking a detour on off stump as Buttler pushes and is beaten"
"pitched up and defended softly coming forwards this time - Buttler happy to play Holder from his crease, unlike the first innings"
"139kph/86mph, short of a length and coming back in, but not enough to make Denly play"
"Denly's a goner, <b>bowled leaving!</b> Muted celebration, but West Indies are understandably cock-a-hoop... Not for the first time today, off pole takes a walk! He used the angle brilliantly, and after being given a thorough working over in the course of his 62-ball innings, Denly makes a decisive error"
"shortish and a touch leg side, left alone"
"huge appeals from behind the wicket! <b>Stokes rapped on the back leg</b>, again Joseph is uninterested, Holder charging up from slip like Sir Viv in his pomp... but no review this time, probably going over"
"<b>dropped!</b> Thick edge from Stokes, a can-opener of a delivery from Joseph but <b>Campbell shells it going to his left!</b> He got there well enough, but then seemed to lose it, the ball squirming form his grasp to gasps around the ground"
"pitched up and shovelled away, Stokes in survival mode"
"pitched up and wibbling away, lavish movement as <b>Buttler chases it on the drive and is beaten!</b> That was a whisker away from five down!"
"coming in with the arm, Buttler leaves this one"
"good length, plenty of nip off the deck, watches this through"
"dug in, this surprises Buttler and seems to pop up off both gloves, no short leg though and it falls to the turf"
"length ball, left alone outside off"
"holy moly, <b>that's an absolute jaffa from Holder!</b> Snakes alive, England haven't a prayer... Fired in and then curling away late as Buttler prods blindly"
"strays on to the pads, flicked through backward square for a couple"
"crackerjack, <b>beats the bat and clears off stump!</b> Stokes is so nearly skewered on the crease, pongo from a length and this misses everything!"
"short and leg side, fenced at without making contact"
"pitched up on off and Stokes makes contact with this one, pinged down the ground for three to long-off"
"full and driven, Buttler on the move this time, nicely played back in the V and he gets three as well"
"back of a length, 139kph/86mph outside off, leaves this alone"
"full and tailing in outside off, Buttler leaves watchfully"
fired in straighter and tucked to leg
"pitched up, in the slot and <b>blasted through the covers for four!</b> Buttler fires a salvo in response"
"woof, beats him again! <b>Unplayable stuff from Holder</b>, arcing in and then away as Buttler plays down the Bakerloo"
"testing line, not quite full enough to suck him in this time"
"pushed in with the arm, 129kph/80mph and worked off the hip for one"
"back of a length on off stump, defended square"
fullish length on the pads and deflected behind square
"shortish, 135kph/84mph around off stump, Stokes shows it a straight bat"
"slanted across the lefty from over the wicket, left well alone"
"short outside off, 141kph/88mph but Stokes gets bravely into line"
"pitched up in the channel, left alone and that will be <b>tea</b>. Anyone for crumpets?"
decent line and length to open proceedings
"attacking the knee-roll, squeezed to the leg side, and <strong>this could be a run-out!</strong> Stokes wanted the single, the shy came in, Joseph backed up brilliantly as he dived for the crease"
"causing bother from the get-go, full and fast, and Buttler buckles as he's beaten for pace"
"flung down on a probing length, just wide of off stump. Left alone"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
flogged into the covers
"round the wicket, rising on off stump, blocked on the back foot"
"wide line, keeps a touch low, toe-ended chop to point"
"outside off, through to the keeper once more, with a bit of nip off the seam"
"back of a length, and <strong>battered through the covers off the back foot!</strong>. Up on the toes, not so much freeing the arms as detaching them from his torso"
"fuller length, tighter line, still that handy shape away to the cordon to keep the batsman thinking"
"through to the keeper, not stroke offered"
"too short, big late swing, not a lot the keeper could do with that!"
fuller length this time
"<B>sumptuous strokeplay!</B> Not a whole lot of effort, but sweet timing, clean through the covers with a high arcing followthrough"
"fuller, straighter, keeps lower. Stabbed to cover"
solid block into the off side
"banged in short, through to the keeper"
stretching forward on a good length to defend
"outside off, through to the keeper with a hint of outswing"
"probing line outside off stump, left alone again"
"advancing out of the crease in a show of intent, but left alone as Roach draws his length back"
punched into the off side
"<strong>driven, and splatters his own stumps!</strong> That's a massive moment in this Test. Stokes, you sensed, was just itching to get on with it ... that sashay down the pitch earlier in the over case in point. This was thrown out wide so there for the drive, but his feet didn't quite match the intent of his bat. A big drag-on, and England are in major strife"
"outside off, full length, zipping away. Left alone"
"lovely length once more, not quite there to play through the line"
"outside off, lifting off the deck"
"full and straight, pressed back into the crease and defended"
"aggressive lines from Gabriel, taking on the stumps and forcing Buttler to hop into line or face the consequences"
"over-pitched, and <B>flogged to the rope!</B> Buttler isn't giving up the ghost, he's ripe for plucking any scoring option, this time clean through the covers with lots of bottom hand"
"back on better length, outside off. Left alone"
"lifting through to the keeper, no stroke this time"
"tighter line, good leave from Moeen"
"very full on a wide line, Moeen opens the face to squirt through third man. Opportunistic and effective, if risky"
<B>beauty!</B> Exploding off the deck with outswing from a tight line. Moeen just flinches as the ball whistles by
"probing length, attacking the top of off as Mo defends with an angled bat. That'll keep the slips interested"
"<B>bowled him!</b> Oh my word, that is just weak as a new-born puppy! Full, fast, tailing into the pads this time, but Moeen just plays all round it... no desire to put his body behind the line and keep it out at all costs. Just a reversion to one-day gung-ho mode... and we've seen what can happen to England in that format too when faced with good accurate bowling"
hopping back and across to defend
"tailing into the pads, deflected down the leg side"
"banged in short again, hops inside the line"
"attempted pull, and doesn't properly connect. The ball bobbles down into the crease. Foakes seems a bit bothered still by that bruised hand"
"wider line outside off, through to the keeper"
defended to the leg side
"back of a length, and that is a fine stroke, hauled from outside off through long-on. Would count as imperious in any other context. Defiant, maybe?"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
"<B>a drilled drive through long-off!</B> Good intent from Foakes, but that was a bit of a floaty half-volley"
"outside off, no stroke offered"
<B>lovely inswinger!</B> Right into the toes and Foakes just about digs it out on the creaseline
"<B>zips into the batsman once again!</B> That won't help Foakes at all, an ambitious drive, not quite to the pitch, and the ball bursts through the top and into the forearm of his right hand"
"through to the keeper, no stroke offered"
"<strong>nipbacker!</strong> Far too high, but Holder is excited as Buttler shoulders arms"
"very full length, too full on this occasion, Joseph can't cut it off at mid-off. Holder just over-straining on occasions in this spell, and Buttler is just the man to capitalise"
"into the toes, clipped uppishly out through the leg side, another priceless boundary to bring England ever closer to parity"
"outside off, through to the keeper with a hint of outswing"
solid in defence this time
"full and straight, squeezed out to the cordon as Roach nips one into his thigh-pad"
"solid block into the covers, leaning forward on a full length"
"whipped on the up out through the leg side, <B>more valuable runs</B> and the deficit is just 1"
"wide line, good carry and late swing. No stroke this time"
"<B>Massive appeal on the inswinger!</B> Gaffeney is unmoved, but Holder <B>reviews</B>. My initial instinct is that this is optimistic. It went fast and late, but <B>no, that is bending straight into the middle of leg stump!</B> Brilliant review from Holder, he was convinced that was hitting, and he has been amply vindicated!"
"round the wicket, full and straight, blocked"
"trundles away outside off, left alone"
"<strong>wicket to wicket, and slammed on the pad!</strong> Up goes the finger, this was leg-sided, but the finger went up instantly! <strong>Buttler reviews</strong>, he has to ...  and it is trimming the bails! <b>England are dead in the water!</B>"
"speared into the pads, down the leg side, Broad scampers off strike, as well he might"
"<B>thumped on the up, clean through the covers!</B> Here we go, the fightback is on"
"outside off, too wide for a man in a mood to miss out on. Bashed through point with elan"
thumped into the covers
"<B>Broad shuffles across his timbers and up goes the finger!</B> This is a turkey shoot. Deep in his crease, looking to play French cricket. This is an ex-contest, it has ceased to be... And that is so stone-dead that <B>even Broad doesn't gamble the review</B>... yeegads"
"full and straight, flashed to the leg side"
"outside off, curling away, you're not touching that one ..."
"<B>oof, there's no laying bat on that!</B> Full, straight, outswinging yorker. Too good for thee, Jimmy lad!"
"<B>brilliant!</B> Tormenting the outside edge with full, fast outswingers. Anderson can't do diddly-squat"
"<strong>beaten again!</strong> Curling past the edge, with a cordon of assassins lined up behind him. Anderson must be wondering, what is the point of it all?"
"standing tall in defence, blocked to cover"
a windy waft outside off stump
"very full, very straight, Curran is reduced to declining singles. The indignity"
"advancing down the track, a whoosh through the line, but can't time it. Again, no single"
"flogged on the up, over the covers. Here's the single"
Anderson walks back and across to see off the over. His job is done for now!
"full-length outswinger, a solid drill to long-off, but again, no single at this stage"
"gives himself room, and carves into the gap in the covers. Is the single on this time? Nope"
"fuller length, into the toes, whipped uppishly to the leg side"
"smashed out to the leg side, banged in short, and they pick off a couple"
"slower ball, well picked, boshed through long-off. Roach almost got a finger on that, aiming for the run-out at the non-striker's end"
"banged in short, well bowled. Curran can only duck, and now Holder has six balls at Anderson"
"<B>slower ball, chipped in the air, Joseph at mid-on ends the innings!</B> Brilliant bluff from Holder, rolled his fingers, Anderson was early on the shot, a fine stretching catch. WEST INDIES NEED 14 TO WIN THE SERIES!"
"short and wide, Brathwaite rocks back and hammers a cut for four!"
"tighter line, left alone outside off"
"jagging in at 137kph/85mph, hits Brathwaite on the thigh as he jumps back"
"straightening on off, defended into the off side"
"touch short, 135kph/84mph and rising towards the hip, deflected to backward square leg"
"length ball, turned off the stumps towards mid-on"
"round the wicket, dug in and flicked off the hip, rolls behind square"
"fullish, tailing in and jabbed slightly uppishly through midwicket, in front of short leg for one"
"off-stump line, gets on to the front foot and defends"
"pitched up wide of the stumps, Campbell piles in and <b>lashes four through the covers!</b> One hit away now"
"jumping from a length, past the bat and hits him on the hip coming forwards"
"pitched up, a touch leg side and skidding into the pads... Not given but England <b>review</b>, which is tantamount to timewasting. They're just delaying the inevitable, though: clearly missing leg stump"
"short ball, smashed beyond the ropes at deep midwicket, <b>West Indies win by 10 wickets and seal the series with one to play!</b> Rally round that!!"
