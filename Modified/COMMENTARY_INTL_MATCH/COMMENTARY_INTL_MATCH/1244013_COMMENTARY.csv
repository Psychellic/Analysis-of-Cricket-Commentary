"length, <strong>takes the edge</strong>, but goes past second slip. Nippy pace, angles in and straightens a touch. Perhaps Gurbaz could have let that pass, but it flies off the edge, and goes just to the right of second slip and runs away to third man"

Ireland seemed keen on reviewing this, but the standing umpire didn't seem too sure about the time left for them to do so. If the umpire has not given a signal initially, it would mean he gave it as runs, but he has now indicated this is <strong>four leg byes</strong>!"

"length, around off, and comes in with the angle, and he defends"

"length, and able to guide it past point towards third man"
"back of a length, and he punches this to cover"

"fullish, and he looks to drive. Gets it off the inner part of the bat, gets it away to deep square leg"
"<strong>slower ball, does the trick!</strong> Cutter, angled across, and Balbirnie perhaps fancies his chances of getting this through the square leg region. The ball stops a bit, and he ends up playing an uppish poke towards short mid-wicket, where Rashid Khan, who else, dives forward to take it. Throws it up in celebration, and Afghanistan know they have another big name out of the way"
