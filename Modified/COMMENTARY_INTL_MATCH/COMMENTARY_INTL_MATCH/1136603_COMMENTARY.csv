"tossed outside off, Watson ventures down the track, gets close to the pitch, and belts it past the left hand of Sodhi. <b>Relays suggest Sodhi just finger-tipped it away</b>. Only a harsh man will call it a drop. Sodhi, in fact, saved three for his side"

length ball pushed wide outside off and he slashes away from the body to get this to the sweeper on the bounce

<b>clears the keeper</b> with a top edge. Same ball that got Rayudu to chop on. Except Watson looks for the pull to this quick short ball outside off
<b>got him!</b> Jofra making it talk with his pace! Short of a length ball on off stump and once again he's late on the pull. This time it's angled in at his body so the swinging room is lesser. It hits the bat higher. Buttler skips to his left and tells short fine leg to stay out of his way to put his gloves to good use
goes around the wicket and fires one straight down leg side. Archer hasn't found any rhythm against Raina. Switch to over the wicket maybe?
another one. Same pattern - full and down leg. Raina falling over into the off side trying to flick but that's fizzing past
short ball in the channel. Gets on one leg and hurriedly bunts this into the square leg region
short ball aimed at the ribs. Quickly gets on his toes and stabs it though the leg side
this angle is not working at all for Jofra. Another length ball fired down leg side

"googly, into the pads on a length. Stands tall and tucks it fine off the back foot"
leg stump ball at a length. On the front foot this time as he taps it fine on its head. Long leg has a lot of running to his right before putting in the slide
"<b>taken at short fine.</b> Binny pedals backwards and falls awkwardly on his back, but he's held on with the reverse cup. Another ungainly hoick by Raina against a googly he hasn't picked. More a sweep, in fact. Regulation top-edge taken at 45"

short of a length and spinning away from off stump. Tapped to extra over off the back foot
lovely bowling. Keeps putting it up there slowly. Keeps them on the back foot. Even Dhoni can only tuck it into the square leg region. What an over

slower ball at a length on off stump. Gets deep in the crease and taps it into the leg side off the back foot
"yorker speared in at middle stump, backs away and jams it towards long-off"
slower ball dug in too short...according to the umpire. Dhoni lets this float in the corridor. Didn't look so high to me...<b>but I was wrong.</b> That was way over the head

slower ball at a length wide outside off. Reaches out and carts this off the toe-end to long-on
"offcutter outside off, tapped to long-off off the toe-end"
<b>run-out appeal</b> at the non-striker's end. Dhoni has taken the stumps down at the other end but the bowler hasn't got a hand on it. Billings it looking for a run though as the ball deflects towards the bowler who now has to run back at the stumps and uproot them with ball in hand. Manages it but Billings' dive saves him
"legcutter, back of a length and into the body. Looks to pull but he's cramped on it. Gets it out to deep midwicket"
full toss on leg stump. Backs away and looks to slog it out the city. Gets it into the leg side off the high part of the bat
and again. Full toss too quick for him. His attempted slog dribbles into the midwicket region
"for a change, a batsman is angry with a wide call. Or the lack of it in this case. Bounce lifts past his attempted hook and the leg-umpire signals first bouncer. Rightly so"
"yorker on middle stump, digs it past the non-striker and comes back easily for the second"
"<b>inside edge</b> zips past short fine. A full, straight ball and Dhoni has his front leg out of the way to get a short-arm helicopter in. Finds the boundary"

"<b>drilled over mid-off!</b> Stokes making life easy for Billings today it seems. Length ball on off stump, backs away and slams this flat"
<b>dropped at deep square!</b> Debutant Chopra runs in and can't hold on. Slower ball and he reaches out to drag this with a slog. Simple catch after making his ground but he doesn't complete it
"<b>direct hit</b> from Buttler. Dhoni forgets to cross over. A stunning yorker from Stokes outside off and Billings can't get bat on it. Runs down the pitch, looks back, finds the stumps being tonked. Well outside the crease"

"full ball on leg stump, swipes off the inside half of the bat and can only get it as far as fine leg, to his left"

Umpire Barde refers it to Nitin Menon, the TV umpire. <strong>The soft signal is out</strong> Skids on middle, non turner, Buttler backs away outside leg, and looks to smash it through the covers. He inside-edges the ball onto the boot, the ball touches the ground, before Dhoni grabs it with one hand"

"full and straight, Samson sweeps it flat and hard to the right of deep midwicket. Billings tears to his right, slides, knocks the ball away. The ball still rolls away towards the boundary.

"back of a length and angling into the hips, swatted to deep square leg for a double"
<strong>Has Dhoni dropped this</strong>? Buttler shuffled across off even before the bowler delivered. He does not get enough bat on the scoop to fine leg. He tickles it away. Dhoni dives to his left and goes for the ball with one hand but it pops out. Replays suggest it carried to him. That's dropped

Game, set, and match for Royals. Dhoni shakes his head. Sums up the night for CSK"
