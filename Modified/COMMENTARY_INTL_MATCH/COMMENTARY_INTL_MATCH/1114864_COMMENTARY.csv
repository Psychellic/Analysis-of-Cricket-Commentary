extra short on off stump and zips off the surface. Attempted pull but the ball goes over his blade. Billings does very well to stop this ball from flying over his head

"short on off stump, backs away and pulled over the square-leg umpire. Neither deep midwicket nor fine leg can get to the ball. A very useful four"

"<b>it's on the roof! Goes over the Bill O' Reilly stand!</b> Ridiculous! Full on off stump and he launches into that. Smacked over deep midwicket, and the slog should've earned him a dozen. It's not a small boundary by any means in Sydney. 104 metres"
"full and wide outside off, slashed over the off side. Opens the bat's face and lifts this over point. Third man has no chance, and ht ends with a 17-run over. <b>Strikers finish on 167 for 3</b>"

"pitched up and right up Hughes' alley to drive it through the covers. Not quite off the middle of the bat, however"
"Roy does not middle it this time but clears mid-off and watches the ball trickle away to the boundary. He slinks away outside leg stump, the bowler goes shorter. Roy aims a loft but ends up slicing it up and over the fielder"

"hip-high short ball on middle stump, Hughes swivels on the back foot and swats it out to deep square leg"

shoulder-high short ball on the off stump. Pace is your best friend. Pace is your worst enemy. Roy uses the pace of Stanlake to his advantage and unleashes a rasping front-foot pull. The white ball flies to the midwicket boundary
"good length and seams away outside off, nearly catches the outside edge"
"edged and Carey pulls off a belting catch. Good length and nips away outside off, bounces, takes the outside edge. Carey moves late, throws himself to his left, and <strong>completes the one-handed catch</strong>. Maddinson was just looking to run it down to third man. He did not get enough bat and Carey showed off his stunning reflexes. What a game he's having"

pretty full and angling into a front-foot punch down to mid-on
Silk slinks around the crease and quietly dabs this length ball to midwicket
"pitched up and attacking off, forward defensive"

whipped from off stump to deep square leg
"short and angling across from around the wicket, back-foot force to long-on. <b>Silk hits a fifty in his first match of the season</b>"
Silk ventures outside leg and aims to open up the off side. But Rashid chases the moving batsman with a googly that fizzes off the pitch and tucks 'em up for room. Silk still goes through with the cut only to chop it back onto the stumps. Rashid has his hands aloft and wheels away. I bet this is going to be one of the most enduring images of the BBL
"tossed outside off, driven through the line to long-off"
"skiddy googly, breaks back in, the batsman hangs back and jabs it past the right of the bowler"
"good length and breaks back in sharply, this wrong'un seems to be heading down leg with the sharp angle from over the stumps"

"Abbott backs away outside leg, has a mighty whoosh at this short ball outside off, and only connects with thin air"
"Stanlake lights up the stumps! Abbott makes swinging room outside leg yet again, Stanlake holds his own. He nails a full ball on middle and sends back Abbott"

"shorter and angling across off, flies past the hook"

O'Keefe ventures across off and misses the scoop over fine leg
"off-side wide, floated really wide, left alone"

"Dwarshius winds up and <b>plants Neser into the crowd beyond wide long-on</b> now. One-handed catch in the crowd. Too full and outside off, he clears his front leg, gets under it, and slogs it with brute force. Bam"
"Neser follows the overpitched ball with a wide yorker outside off, creeps under the swinging bat. Dot"
"low full-toss outside off, swatted across the line between deep midwicket and wide long-on. There wasn't a two there. Horrible fielding and throw from the deep. On the half-volley to Carey - he can't collect it cleanly"
mighty full and outside off - not the perfect yorker - but good enough to defeat the wild hack of the left-hander
"middle-stump yorker from Neser, Dwarshuis can only inside-edge a single to the leg side. Top comeback from Neser after being hit for a six off the first ball of the over"
"<strong>Neser hits the base of middle stump</strong> with a ripping yorker. Dips late, creeps under the bat, and secures Strikers' six-run win. Great finish from Neser"
