"outside off, and offering some width, and Imam lays into it. Drives forcefully and in the gap between cover and point. Fine shot!"
"length ball, that comes back in and they have <strong>appealed</strong>. Turned down. They have gone for a review though, possibly for a caught behind. It passes close to the bat, but doesn't seem to have taken either bat or glove. Hafeez was pressing forward and looking to defend, the ball cut back in sharply to beat the inside edge. <strong>The umpire might have a look at the LBW shot, but it bounces above</strong>."

"angles across him, and he watches it through with his bat raised. The line was far too outside off-stump for him to be tempted"

"angles across him, and he shoulders arms to it"
"angles across, and Hafeez looks to leave it, but the ball takes his bat as he was about to take it out of the way. Thankfully, crept along the floor to the gully region"

"shorter in length, and straighter. He hangs back and defends"
"<strong>DROPPED!</strong> It's angled across Imam, and he goes for the drive again. This time, his feet didn't move as much, and that led to him getting the outside edge. It was travelling quickly to Latham at second slip, who failed to latch on"

"angles across Hafeez, and from a good length. He is opened up a bit, but does well to play it with soft hands to the offside"

"tries to bowl this straighter, but drifts down the leg side, and Hafeez glances it fine, and the outfield does the rest"
"length ball, and a good leave from Hafeez. The ball cuts back, but the bounce is true, and it passes well over the off stump"
"another terrific ball! Bowled at 136.4kph, and cuts back in sharply after pitching. Hafeez lets it go again, and it bounces over the top of middle this time"
"angles across, and is bowled at nearly 136kph this time. Hafeez lets it pass. Good contest brewing between the two experienced men..."
"pitched up, as he looks for swing, but again drifts into Hafeez's pads. He goes back and flicks it down to the long-leg region"
"outside off stump, and dying on the batsman. He shoulders arms and lets it through"
"<strong>first blood for New Zealand!</strong> This was again outside the off stump, and Hafeez for once got tempted into letting his bat hang out, and just took the outside edge. The ball was dying on its way to Tom Latham, but he was positioned low enough to scoop it up with ease. Makes up for the previous lapse from him, but a vital breakthrough inside the first hour"
"outside off, and moving away off the seam. Azhar watches it through without nibbling at it"
"<strong>CHANCE!</strong> A fuller ball, and Azhar gets tempted into going for the drive. It takes the outside edge, and somehow contrives to go perfectly between Watling and Taylor at first slip!"

outside off and moving further away. He lets it pass without fiddling at it
"length ball, that jags back in. Imam caught in the crease, and gets hit in front of the stumps. The bounce would probably have taken it over the stumps, though"
"fuller ball, and a hint of movement away, as Imam comes forward to defend. This is another good spell of pressure coming from Boult. Excellent new-ball bowling, especially for the conditions..."
"shorter in length, outside off, and Imam lets it pass"
"outside off, and on a length as it swings away. Azhar comes forward but refuses to be drawn into a shot"
"a little fuller, and again on off stump. The ball keeps a bit low, as Azhar shoulders arms."
"fuller, and he comes to the length of it and eases it through covers. A much better shot, with the right footwork to match"
"<strong>GONE!</strong> Air of inevitability about this, as de Grandhomme has been homing in on that line outside off stump. Another cutter that goes across him, and Imam goes forward looking to defend it, but gets the outside edge of the bat. Carries nicely to Latham, who makes no mistake this time. What a start this has been for New Zealand!"

Second Test hundred for Haris Sohail, got by tucking a full ball to mid-on's left. He's been good down the ground, and that's where he gets the big run. A relieved acknowledgement of the dressing room, most of which was in splits over the last few minutes. Kisses the ground, says a prayer, and a reserved smile from the man"

"<b>trapped on the back thigh</b> and he's in line of the stumps. This skids through quickly from around the wicket. Did he get bat on that? There were certainly two noises. He was looking to play the flick. Pakistan has no reviews left, of course. <b>Replays show ball was sliding down.</b>"

"<strong>DONE HIM IN!</strong> Length ball, and just a little bit of movement in, and creeps through the tightest of gaps between bat and pad. Nicholls stretched forward, but his feet never really got close enough to the pitch of the ball. The bat was quite far forward, and the ball goes in with the natural angle, and clips the top of off. <strong>The clearing of the throat is on...</strong>"

"tossed up, and he presses forward to defend"
"tossed up, and he looks to sweep, and it goes in the air towards midwicket. <strong>FIVE FOR YASIR!</strong> Goes off the outside of the edge as Wagner goes for an almighty heave, and that went quite high in the air. Bowled from the back of the hand, and a good catch by Hasan Ali, sprawling away in front after running a fair distance. The sajda from Yasir, who has a chance to match Imran Khan's 14 wickets in a match..."
"tossed up, and Ajaz whips it away with the turn as it pitches on middle, and gets it towards midwicket"
"length ball, and he defends from the crease"
"<strong>IT'S OVER! YASIR HAS 14!</strong> Tosses this up, and Boult looks to come forward and defend, but gets a feather edge as it spins viciously past his bat and is collected by Sarfraz. Instant appeal and celebration from the bowler and his teammates, and the dreaded finger goes up as well. Eight in the first and six in the second for Yasir Shah."
