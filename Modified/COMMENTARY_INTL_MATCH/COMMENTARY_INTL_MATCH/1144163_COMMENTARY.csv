Malik and Talat are neck and neck as they both head to the non-striker's end when the bails come off. This is a really tight call. <b>After an interminable delay of approximately four minutes, Malik is finally given out</b> as he was marginally behind Talat when the wicket fell."

"quicker, flatter and fuller from Shamsi, Asif digging it out to point for one"
"Asif aims an almighty heave at Morris' first ball, which is on a length on off stump, but slices it high into the darkening evening sky ... Klaasen sprints back as the ball plummets down, but can't quite get underneath it"
"<b>swatted through cover!</b> Imad spots a full ball from Morris - perhaps the attempted yorker - and dances down the track to turn it into a full toss, hammering a drive out through cover"
<b>straight back over his head!</b> Imad clears his left leg and dispatches the ball back from whence it came. Morris keeps walking in his follow through and there's plenty of heated chat between batsman and bowler
"shorter from Morris, though not quite the bouncer. Imad is up on one leg to pull, but can't beat the field"

"he starts around the stumps to Asif, who reads the line early and finds a single into the leg side"
"<b>clubbed to wide long on!</b> Imad must have a really good eye. Beuran dug this in, but Imad was waiting for it, hammering the ball well in front of square. In fact, he's slugged it to wide long on"
"bouncer again, but this is a much slower one and Imad is too soon into his pull shot, gloving it to short fine"
"angling in towards the stumps on a full length, and Asif eases it to long on for a single"
"very nicely bowled by Beuran, who fires in a full, wide yorker than Imad has to stretch at to reach, toe-ending it back to the bowler"
"<b>undone by the slower ball!</b> Imad was getting fidgety after those two dot balls, and he just tried to hit this a little too hard even as he mis-read the delivery, which hit a length and cut in just a touch off the pitch to rattle the stumps"

flicked off the pads for a single through midwicket
"swiped out into the leg side, on the bounce to the fielder. Excellent changes of pace from Phehlukwayo in this over, once he recovered from that slightly iffy start"
"<b>monstrous hit over long on!</b> It was there to be hit as Morris dished up a long half volley, in the slot, and Asif pings his shot right out of the middle"
"Morris pulls his length back and takes the pace off the ball, delivering this one at only 120km/h, Asif staying deep in his crease to shovel the ball through square leg"
"Faheem plants his front foot and heaves right across the line, the ball scooting past his inside edge"
"full and wide, and Faheem swipes it out to Dala on the cover boundary. Asif wants two but Faheem sends him back"

"on a length, just outside off, and it's punted to long off for one"
"<b>now Faheem finds the boundary rider!</b> He lined up a full ball from Beuran and tried to hit it down the ground, but he just didn't get enough on it. Miller was the fielder down at long on, and he made no mistake. He usually doesn't"

<b>and another one!</b> Pakistan are giving South Africa fielding practice under lights. Amir drives flamboyantly at his first ball but picks out van der Dussen on the deep cover boundary. He barely had to move out there.

"<b>through him!</b> Length ball on middle, and going straight. Malan tries to punch with the bat's full face, but the ball sneaks under his bat by the time he plays the shot. Extra bounce, too, from Imad, and Malan's middle stump has been pegged back"
"full on middle, and he brings his bat down to muscle a straight drive. Flies off the bat's outside edge to mid off"
"full outside off stump, and Dussen has teed off! Drags a slog from outside off stump, but he's toe ended that shot completely. In the air for ages, and mid-on - running towards the boundary - can't get under the ball. Lands just beyond Amir near the boundary as Dussen gets a reprieve"
"full on off, and angling further across. He covers his stumps and then shoulders his arms"
"<b>keeper and bowler go up to appeal</b> but the umpire says no. Length ball on middle that's angling across the batsman. Klaasen tries to defend, but the ball whizzes past his outside edge to the keeper. Some noise, probably the shuffle of the batsman's boots, got the fielding side excited"

"<b>hits his helmet!</b> But Rassie says he's alright. Short ball on leg, and he tries to pull. Gloves the shot right onto his face, but the helmet grille saves him from any damage. The umpires, nonetheless, want to check if Rassie is OK. The physio rushes in to take a quick concussion test"

"<b>down the ground, one bounce and over the rope</b>, Morris getting a great connection on a full ball"
"that's better from Faheem, bustling in and firing in a pinpoint yorker at Morris' toes. All he can do is dig it out"
"clubbed out through midwicket, but along the ground as once again it's very full and Morris can't get under it. He calls immediately for two to get back on strike"
"another fine yorker from Faheem, and Morris angles his jab down on it to find a single to cover"
"<b>Faheem's yorker is too good for Sipamla</b> and he's out to the very first ball he faces in international cricket. Full, straight, and the stumps are rattled. Pakistan close in on a consolation win"
"Faheem aims for another yorker, but it slips out as a low full toss that Shamsi nudges into the leg side"
"<b>Afridi drops a caught and bowled chance!</b> This should have been the end. Morris almost swung himself off his feet trying to hit this over the rope, but top edged the shot. Afridi got under it himself, but the ball just popped out"
"canny slower ball from Afridi, and it has the beating of Morris outside off stump"
"a slice drive sends the ball bouncing out to deep cover, but Shamsi doesn't want the strike"
<b>heaved onto the grass banks!</b> Morris eyes up a full ball in his half and sends it into the crowd beyond midwicket
"<b>a maiden T20I fifty for Chris Morris</b> and he gets it with another massive hit down the ground. Great knock, but not enough to turn the game"
"Afridi ends the tour with a yorker on off stump that Morris digs out to point, and that's that!"
