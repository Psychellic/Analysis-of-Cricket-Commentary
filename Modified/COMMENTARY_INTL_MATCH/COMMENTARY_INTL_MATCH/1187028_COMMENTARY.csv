"wider of off stump this time, dead-batted"
"fuller on middle stump, almost squared Rohit up. Batsman manages to drive it down to mid-on again"
"shorter delivery, batsman gets behind it nicely to block. Good first over so far from Cummins"
"some movement around off stump, thick outside edge through the covers. The <strong>first over is a maiden</strong>"
"exquisite drive from Dhawan, the <strong>ball races back down the field to the boundary</strong>. Full and straight, and Dhawan simply timed it straight back down the ground"
"shorter from Starc, fended to the leg side"
"full and straight again, this time Dhawan defends it to mid-on"
"hits Dhawan on the pads. The ball was going down the legside, though"
"wild lash outside off stump from Dhawan, <strong>lucky to miss it</strong>. Worst delivery of the day so far, arguably, well outside off. Dhawan wanted to smash it through the covers"
runs it down to fine leg. Five from Starc's first over
driven on the up to mid-off
"a bit of width, and Dhawan <strong>latches on to it in a flash</strong>. Pinged past a diving cover-point fielder all the way. When you give Dhawan a chance to free his arms, you'd best be prepared for what follows"
"short of a length, leaves this one alone"
"leg stump line this time, and flicked down to fine leg. Dhawan is looking dialled in right from the start"
"slightly uppish, but in the gap and <strong>races to the square leg boundary</strong>. Ordinary delivery, really, dragged down the leg side. Rohit just needed to get some bat on it"
"goes shorter this time, Rohit tries to beat fine leg, who's in the circle, but the ball goes straight to him. Another excellent over for India"
"targets top of off, fended to backward point"
full toss wide outside off stump. Batsman didn't quite time it
"cut away to the third man boundary, where Cummins did especially well to ensure it didn't go for four"
"nearly went through the gap between bat and pad. Length delivery, inside edge on to the pad. Dhawan was momentarily unsure where that ball was going"
"well, that's just meat and drink for Dhawan. 146kph, full, dragged down the leg side. Dhawan needs only to use the pace and he sends it barrelling past fine leg for four."
defended
"oooh, Rohit misjudged the line there. Wanted to get on to the back foot to pull, ball goes underneath the bat"
worked away to square leg. Cummins getting back to that wicket-to-wicket line that earned him that maiden over
"too close to cut, play and a miss from Dhawan. This is the line Cummins needs to consistently bowl to the left-hander"
and again. Dhawan looking for room to open up the offside. Thick bottom edge
"fuller, <strong>nearly got the outside edge</strong>. Dhawan poked at it, no feet movement to accompany the hands. Fortunate to be beaten"
"quick run to mid-on prompts the fielder to have a shy. Direct hit, but the ball deflects away to allow the batsmen to run another one. Nevertheless, excellent over from Cummins again"
"back of a length, driven back to the bowler"

"<strong>gorgeous</strong>. Full on off stump, and Rohit leans into the drive, and the cover fielders don't even move. There would be no point."

"just outside off, left wel alone"
straighter line to Dhawan
"runs down the track, Richardson reads this and pulls his line back, forcing the batsman to fend it down to the legside"

driven on the up to mid-off
"length delivery, timed to cover"
"another expansive drive, gets a thick outside edge and goes down to third man"
defended
"worked to the onside, Good running"
"too easy fro Dhawan. Cummins goes down the legside again, and Dhawan just needs to <strong>flick it down to fine leg</strong>. The fielder isn't even at the boundary, but I suspect that might not have made a difference"
"back foot punch, straight to a fielder though"
"this one beats the cover fielders though. Rocks back and <strong>crunches it through the offside</strong>. Cover point thought about giving it a chase, turned around and saw the ball racing away and stopped dead in his tracks."
"guided through the onside, and the pair change ends. The 50-partnership comes up"
"bit of hesitation, and had Richardson stopped the ball, a run-out was on."
takes the pace off the ball. We might see more of that given how flat this wicket looks right now
and again. Rohit works it away to square leg and keeps the strike
runs it down to midwicket
"short delivery, and it cracks Dhawan in the ribs. Enough presence of mind to take a single, but <strong>he will need treatment</strong>. He has gone down"
"bit of bounce here. Struck Rohit high on the bat, nearly got him on the gloves"
"wicket-to-wicket, blocked"

"floated on a fullish length on fifth stump, Rohit uses his lengthy reach once again to slog sweep this flat over cow corner, one bounce over the rope."
"so classy for so much of this first hour, Rohit looks very clumsy falling over to this missed sweep and is given lbw. <strong>But he's gone for the review!</strong> And it's frankly a terrible review. He clearly lost his bearings falling off balance losing any sense of where he was in front of the stumps. Missed this full ball and was struck halfway up the shin. The ball was ripping out middle and off stump 3/4 of the way up. Shikhar should be equally at fault on the wasted review for not talking him out of it if he's got a good view at the non-striker's end."

"crunched to extra cover, the timing not there to find a gap"
persists with the leg stump line to Kohli. Too easy for him to nudge it to fine leg once more
"flashes, flashes hard, flashes hard enough <strong>the edge beats a leaping wicketkeeper</strong>! Races away for four. Decent delivery from Starc, deserved a better outcome"

"dragged back, driven to mid-off"
"bouncer. Seemed a bit high, but Starc gets away with it"

"pushes Dhawan onto the back foot. Muffled appeal; the bowler seemed to believe it had brushed Dhawan's pad. Nothing doing, though"
opens the bat face to short third. Good running again
"runs down the ground, nearly yorks himself, though. Rare dot delivery"
that's enormous. Dances down the track and absolutely thwacks this into the stand behind cow corner. The sweetness of the timing on that!
"and the poor ball comes. Down the onside, and Dhawan helps it to the fine leg boundary. This may well be Agar's last over"
strikes him on the pad. Slight appeal from Agar

"slower ball, Kohli reads it early, and works it away to the on-side. <strong>Partnership is 99 now</strong>"
"<strong>the hundred partnership comes up</strong>! And how! Sees the slower ball early, rocks back,  waits for it, and deposits it back over Richardson's head for four"
"what just happened there! Dhawan has <strong>holed out for 96</strong>! It was under the armpit, the line Australia have targeted for so long. Dhawan used the pace, timed it perfectly, but saw it carry straight to the fielder at fine leg. Tremendous innings, but doesn't get him to three figures"

"scratchy knock comes to an end with an ungainly hoick. Pressure was building ever so slightly on Shreyas, Zampa floats this one up on a fullish length on middle stump, the batsman goes for an impetuous flick heave across the line and misses badly.

nudged square on the leg side
good length from Agar. Not allowing Kohli to come down the track or rock back. Takes a single down long-on instead
"overpitches it, and pays the price! Full flighted ball, and there's no turn. Rahaul lofts it back over the bowler's head and it cannons into the sightscreen. Gorgeous shot"
rocks back and carves it behind third man. 10 off the over already
crunches it down to long-on
"dinked into the onside, and the lack of pace means the two can come back for a couple. Excellent batting by India. They appear to be scoring big runs without taking risks"

sweetly timed to midwicket. Fielder does well to keep it to one
"slower ball, nudged into the offside. Good over from Australia at this stage"
"<strong>he's gone! Zampa's got Kohli again!</strong> What a catch that is! Kohli lofted him straight back over his head, looked for all the world it would go for six but for some incredible work on the boundary. Agar takes a clean catch about six inches from the rope, feels himself going over and lobs the ball over to Starc. Incredible coordination for an incredibly big wicket"

driven to long-off
chipped to deep midwicket

smart running. Just timed to mid-off and he's on his way
crunched to cover-point. Beautiful timing on it
"short delivery, looking to pepper Jadeja, I suspect. He gets off strike"
"low full toss; this isn't good enough, but KL Rahul most certainly is. Pure timing which beats the man at deep cover-point, and he <strong>brings up his 50</strong>"
"is that the shot of the day? I'd venture to say so. Starc at full tilt, and he's lifted him over extra cover for six as if he was Chris Harris on sedatives. Rahul has so much time right now"
"dragged down. This is a costly over, and <strong>300 is up for India</strong>"
"short ball, helped away to the leg side"
"sensibly keeps it short once more. But expensive over. Australia would have been counting on Starc, and his next two overs may be crucial to the game's outcome"

"slower bouncer. Rahul turns his bat into a periscope and sort of tennis-smashes it to midwicket. Sharp running by the duo again, they have been superb"
"full pace, shorter delivery. Rahul swings, but for once, doesn't connect"
Cummins has tried to be too clever by half. This short ball Rahul was lying in wait for. Just opened the face of the bat and helped it away over third man <strong>all the way for six</strong>. Incredible shot.
"attempted yorker, but Rahul moved back in his crease, and flicked it to fine leg for four. A diving Labuschagne can't prevent it"
keeps the strike for the last over
no timing from the batsman. Went straight up but into a gap.
pull shot gets Rahul back on strike. He's on 80 with 4 balls to go. Any chance of a 100?
misses it completely. Slower ball and a wild hoick that goes through to the keeper. They run a bye Australia aren't too concerned with preventing
"and <strong>that's Rahul gone</strong>. Well done for being so unselfish, to be fair. Went through to the keeper and Rahul as desperate to get back on strike. Carey got the direct hit; a diving Rahul was well out of his crease"

"short on sixth stump, Warner goes for the full pull shot instead of the short arm jab this time, drags this high over midwicket with a lot of wrist power and it bounces away to the rope."
"<strong>Pandey! The Barracuda!</strong> Length ball angled across fifth stump, Warner spanks this flat toward cover, didn't look like he wanted to keep it down but didn't get the elevation either. Pandey on the ring times his leap perfectly to intercept it with his right hand reaching high over his head. 10/10 from the Swiss, the Russian, the French and the Brazilian judges. Nonchalant flick in the air after the catch before being mobbed by Jadeja and Shreyas. Warner cracks a grin. That was special."
