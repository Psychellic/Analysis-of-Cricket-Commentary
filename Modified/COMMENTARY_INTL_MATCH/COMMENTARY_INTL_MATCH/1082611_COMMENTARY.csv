"on the pads to start, worked to midwicket. And Jayant oversteps. Absolute rubbish from Jayant. How can you do that? Already Sunrisers with the momentum. Gives Dhawan a chance too"

"a wide yorker outside off, 145 kph. Dhawan can't reach his attempted cut. Bat hits ground."

"full and very wide outside off, Warner can't reach that"
"145 kph, massssive wicket. Morris gets Warner. A back of a length delivery outside off, the ball moves away late. Takes the leading edge and lobs up in the air.

"Mathews starts with an offcutter on off, pushed to long-off"

"132 kph, on a length on leg, Dhawan inside-edges the ball into a not-so-pleasant spot. Pain for Dhawan, he'll take a couple of seconds"

"yes, says Williamson. So he picks a length delivery and whips it away over square leg. Super stroke. Proper timing. Not his strength, but made that looked T20"

"good length delivery outside off, carved down to third man"
"a cutter outside off, worked to square leg for a couple. Williamson struggles to come back for two. A better throw from Billings would have had Williamson"

"first ball goes up. Full outside off, Williamson shuffles across and flicks but gets a top edge.

"there it is. it works. A slower delivery outside off, Dhawan struggles to hit his cover. Inside-edged to square leg"
"taken. Morris gets another. Awful delivery. Good length way down leg. Dhawan gets across, is too early through his swipe, the ball takes the toe-end and flies to deep square leg. Mathews takes a sitter. Good knock from Dhawan, played anchor well."
"bowled. Superb bowling. Sees Yuvraj has walked across so he fires a full yorker down leg. Even if it missed the stumps, it was too close to be called wide. Yuvraj hits the bat into his pad or ground and misses a flick. 146 kph, accurate yorker. Think he aimed just for that. Excellent from Morris"

"short, wide outside off, cut and cut hard off the backfoot, beats point who tries to get down to his right"
"sliding in with the arm on leg, pushed off the front foot between midwicket and long-on. Long-on picks it up and they take him on and come charging back for the second. And, guess what. There is a throw fired at the bowler's end. Yuvraj picks it up on the bounce and breaks the stumps. He seems pretty confident that Karun is short of his ground. And he is. He stretched a long way forward but probably needed to put in a dive"
left alone outside off
"short, wide, slapped off the backfoot through backward point"
"he may be struggling but he is not going to put those down. Full and outside off, Pant swipes hard across the line, and though he hits it with the turn, it was angled across and he ends up sending it into the hands of Warner at long-on. First-ball duck for Pant"
"seemed like a dropped catch for a moment. Short and wide, tries to cut but the ball bounces too much, gets a little beaten by pace as well. Gets big on him, hits the keeper's glove and goes away. They steal a run, given as bye by the umpire"

""
"full, on the pads, clipped straight to midwicket"
"slower short ball, outside off, just 112 kph, Mathews is through with the pull early and misses"
"short again, the bounce is slightly steep and he cannot find the middle of the bat as he pulls to deep midwicket"
backs away very early. The bowler makes the adjustment in length and drops it short but does not adjust the line. Needed to angle it into him and cramp him for room. Iyer flays it over point as he finds the room to open up his arms
"length, spinning away, steered to backward point with an open bat face"
"good use of the feet. Comes down the track, meets the pitch of this. It is pitching outside off and he makes sure to move towards it, keeps a still head and lofts it over long-off"
"tries to slog against the turn, on a length, spinning away, beats him and misses off-stump by not much"
"googly, coming into the pads, clipped away towards fine leg"

"that was quite wristy. Gets into position early and turns it away behind square. ON a length, outside off, gets his front foot across and lofts it over backward square leg by using the wrists"
"comes down the track looking to hammer this short of a length ball, slower in pace and knocked down to long-on"
"short again and rolls his fingers over it. Mathews has to wait before he tries to ramp it over, but there is no pace and he cannot reach the bounce"
"short of a length, does not get on top of the bounce entirely as he slaps it out to sweeper cover"
"back of a length, outside off, opens the face of his bat but gets it just wide of backward point"
"looking for a yorker and ends up bowling a full toss outside off that is pushed down the ground, between long-off and long-on"
"very full, a yorker, squeezed out to long-on"
"just short of long-on. Walks across and Bhuvneshwar tries to take it away from the batsman. Fires it wide outside off and the batsman has to reach out for it, tries to loft and gets it off the toe end of the bat"
trying to take it away from the batsman again but this time he just sends it outside the line outside off
"fullish length, punched hard down to long-on"
"good shot, well-played. Backs away to give himself room and just responds with a whirl of the wrists. Opens the face of his bat and clears short third man"
"length ball, angled in at the pads, Mathews picks it up from the pads and swats it over square leg. Powerful wrists"
"good ball, hits the blockhole outside off and all the batsman can do is jam the bat down and squeeze it out to covers"
"moves across and away, gets a low full toss that is pushed wide of long-on. There was a chance for the second run but they needed to push harder"
"yorker on leg, jams the bat down and digs it out between long-on and deep midwicket. This time they push for two and get it easily"
"backs away and the bowler follows him with a very full ball, pushed down to long-on. This is good bowling. Not much can be done if it is that full"
"ah, gets it wrong off the last ball. All the good work undone. Goes for a yorker and ends up bowling a full toss on middle, whipped away backward of square leg for four. And that is the <b>fifty of the partnership</b>. This pair is keeping Daredevils alive"
"fuller ball, clears the front leg and tries to go big over the leg side, misses out, and ends up drilling it between long-on and deep midwicket"
"a near-yorker outside off, can't get underneath it as he pushes it to covers"
"Ojha fumbles allowing a bye to be taken. Slower ball, outside off, Iyer backs away and has to reach out for it, can't make contact. Sloppy from Ojha"
"full toss, coming low into him and Mathews flicks to midwicket who dives to his left full-length and stops it"
"what a ball and what a shot! That is a stunning shot. Yorker, outside off, jams the bat down and opens the bat face at the very last minute, gets it past the short third man fielder"
"short of a length, outside off, flayed hard with a flat bat but does not time it too well. Gets it away to sweeper cover"
"full toss, on middle and leg, Shreyas whips it hard but straight to backward square leg. Missed opportunity at a boundary"
full toss again but this one's not as low as some of the other ones. Comes on a knee height for Mathews who clobbers it over long-on. Needs to get the yorker right here. This one could still swing either way
"there it is, he nails it, finally. Yorker, on middle and leg, all Mathews can do is dig it out back in the bowler's direction. Can he nail more of these? Couple more of these and it's game over"
"great stop from Ojha. Another yorker, wide of the crease and angled in, Mathews was backing away outside leg stump, misses the ball which goes between bat and legs and Ojha dives to his left to stop that. That could have easily been four byes. Kaul gets some reverse there"
this is great bowling. Intelligently varies his pace. Drops it short but it is a slower ball. Really does not come on at the pace Mathews would have liked and he flat-bats it. Can't get any sort of timing on it and finds long-on
backs away to this short of a length ball and just flat-bats it away through extra cover. It is cut off at the deep and that is the game
