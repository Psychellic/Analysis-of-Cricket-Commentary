"full, wide outside off, and that's too wide"
"back of a length at off stump, played to the on side"
"full at off stump, driven firmly back at Southee who collects. Finch has to be alert to get back into his ground"
"full toss on leg stump, flicked down to long leg, Wade will feel he missed out"
"big appeal for lbw, not given! Williamson has called the <strong>review</strong>. Full, angling into the stumps, Finch falls across it as he aims to leg. And it's umpire's call on hitting leg stump! Relief for Finch"

"another huge appeal for lbw! Coming down the pitch, misses his flick to the leg side"

"back of a length, straight, worked off the pads backward of square"
"a short delivery, pulled in the air in front of square, pulls up on the outfield as it's flick back near the rope"
"<strong>terrific shot! </strong>Philippe's wrists on show again. A full delivery on the pads, flicked very strongly with plenty of bottom hand and clears deep square"
appeal for lbw...this shapes back into the pads and beats the inside edge. Perhaps doing a little too much
in the air straight down the ground but not cleanly timed
"more power through the leg side, and placement, full at the toes and it's sweetly flicked between midwicket and mid-on"
"this one is out of the middle as well, but driven straight back at Boult who is able to get down to it"
"<strong>sent down the ground first ball!</strong> A full delivery outside off, Finch lofts it all the way with just enough force to clear the long-off rope"
"walks down the pitch, back of a length, misses his flick to the leg side and it rebounds off the pads"

"a slower ball, full outside off, drives it in the air over cover...he's flying along. Pressure on Neesham"
"gets a yorker in outside off, skews off an inside edge down to long leg. Big over for Australia"

leans back and drives to deep cover
"full at the stumps, driven over midwicket and it ends up being timed well enough to go all the way"

"again lands in space! Things going Australia's way today...tried to go straight down the ground, almost reached long-off"
"<strong>taken at long-on! </strong>Doesn't get away with it this time. Came down the pitch, had to reach for the shot, went a long way in the air which gave Guptill time to get across and complete a very good catch"
"good length and into middle stump, stays leg side of that and opens the face to run it to third man's right"

good length and cramped at middle and leg. Looks to jump to create room but can only pat that out to extra cover
"short and just outside off, cut into the turf to wide third man"

"short of a length and turning away from off, cut to sweeper cover"
"beaten on the reverse sweep. Shuffles into Sodhi's wide line, can't get bat on the big swing"
"short and wide outside off, cut to sweeper cover"
<b>high full toss outside off</b>. Looks like he was trying to push that through quicker and it slipped. It is high enough to be a no- ball. A mistimed swat to long-on from Maxwell
"<b>oh gloriously swatted over the off side!</b> Looks like a switch hit, because he's changed into a left hander for this. Stance and all. It's short of a length and he uses the turn to pull that over cover to <b>bring up a much needed fifty</b>"
"short outside off, cut to sweeper's left"
"tossed up full and wide outside off, mistimed drive to long-off"
"full and just outside off, shuffles and drives along the floor to long-off"
short of a length and rising at off stump. Backs away and looks to slap that over cover. It ends up in front of long-on off the toe-end
<b>misses everything.</b> Maxwell through his slog too early. Looks like an offcutter from Neesham that grips and climbs over off stump from a good length
<b>beaten again.</b> Another slower ball at a length. Maxwell's down the pitch this time to clear the off side and is through it early
forces him to withdraw. Banged in short and wide outisde off. He shuffles for the pull but that one's gripped and climbed as well
"<b>'oh nooooo,'</b> shouts Neesham. He's slid this into Maxwell's pads, short of a length and it's an easy tickle down to fine leg"
<b>sliced between short third man and point.</b> Finch well in the zone now. This is short and angled across middle stump. Arches to create room and places this into the gap

"yorker just outside off, jammed back down the pitch"
"slower ball at a length just outside off, dropped into the covers with soft hands"

"bisects the square fielders again. Poor from Boult. Short and wide outside off, he waits on that and cuts it along the floor"

"slower short of a length ball, skidding low as Maxwell splits his legs to try and chop behind point"
"reverse ramp from chest height! Shortish and climbing in the corridor, sets up early, drops into the leg side with his upper body and gets it away"
"beaten on the reverse ramp this time. Short and climbing outisde off, a bit too far to connect on this occasion"
good length and well down leg side
short and high at middle stump. Backs away and is beaten on the upper cut
"<b>slapped over square leg.</b> Looks for the slower short ball this time, but it's given Maxwell a lot of time. It's a little in front of square too, this pull. Climbed into it"
"full and wide outside off, shuffles and drags it out to deep midwicket"
"oh this is clever bowling. Slows it right down to 77kph, drops it at a length and it dips before spinning away from off. Maxwell beaten on the sweep"
"reverse sweep for six. Just another day for Maxwell. Length, turning and climbing outisde off. Uses all of that to his advantage and then swivels to put it away"
"fuller and flatter outside off, hits hits back leg as he looks for the reverse sweep again"
"<b>taken at short third!</b> Slow and turning away outside off again, makes Finch wait and wait. He can only drag that to the fielder there. Finch's innings ends - and it's one that he'll be relieved by. Got lucky with an lbw early on, and he cashed in"
"short of a length outisde off, mistimed punch to extra cover"
short and wide and gratefully slashed past point
<b>whewww that is flying away!</b> Over square leg and shatters the backrest on a seat. Slower ball and short outisde off. Walks into the line and then...that bat-speed. Incredible

"low full toss at leg stump, backs into the leg side and just chips this over the bowler's head. 18 off the first four balls of this over"
"oh glorious. The range of this man. Unreal. <b>Brings up fifty off 25 balls.</b> It's a length ball outside off. Not driving length, but he gets on his knees and uses his wrists to carve this past point. Sprints away to the boundary"
"<b>carted over midwicket!</b> 28 off the over! Short outside off, lines him up and swats it over midwicket. No one on the fence there because they've had to protect the off side. Neesham finishes having conceded 60!"
"short of a length and into off stump, backs away and chops to third man"
"slower short one outside off, waits on it and cuts it over point. Boundaries off his last seven balls now. Southee going with the same plan as last over and Maxwell is waiting on that"
"yorker at middle and leg, splits the legs and squeezes this off the thick inside edge to deep square leg's right"
"<b>slogged over deep midwicket.</b> In the slot outside off, he gets his weight into the back foot and almost falls into the line of this one before swinging his hands clean through it"
"yorker following him down leg side, looks to whip it into the leg side - whips it into his ankle instead"
"<b>good catch diving forward by Seifert.</b> Full and in at the stumps. Backs into the leg side to try and reverse ramp over short third. Inside edge onto pad, lobs up for the keeper who does well to get under that with a lunge. What an innings from Maxwell. Got his last 40 runs in 11 balls"
"short of a length and just outside off, chopped to point at off stump"
"short of a length at off stump, looks to drop that into the covers and can't get it off the pitch"
"length outside off, looks to drive through cover with the angle. That straightens and takes the inside edge which falls in front of Seifert"
"full at middle stump, shuffles and has a big swish at it. Gets a thick inside edge past short fine. Sodhi's rather slow running after that and they pinch a third that Boult is not happy with"
"short of a length outisde off, shuffles across and pats to point"
pumped down the ground but only one. It's full and in the slot. Gets the full face on it but long-off is pretty striaght
"wide yorker outside off, jammed to extra cover's right"
"beaten. Good length and wide outside off, shuffles and is in line to crash that over cover. But that jags away late"
"<b>tough chance dropped at sweeper.</b> Stoinis looks to lash this length ball over extra cover and ends up slicing it high in the end. Conway runs in and dives forward, but can't get his fingers under that"
"full outisde off, chopped into the covers"

defended to the on side
"short ball outside off, fetched with a cracking pull shot in front of square"

the bottom hand comes through as he drives to mid-on

"<b>lbw appeal turned down and Australia review it.</b> That hit him high on the leg, might even have been in the box. He was looking to slog from a length and was pinned on the back leg. The line was alright, middle an leg. But that might be too high...yes it is. Australia lose the review"

"full at off stump, leans in and flicks to deep midwicket"
"<b>appeal for catch behind and it is given.</b> Neesham not too sure, but he won't take the DRS. This is full and sliding across him. He looks to drive through cover and jams the bat into the pitch. It's also got a thin outisde edge by the sounds of it as this happens. He walks back for a golden duck to close out a bad day. Agar has <b>three wickets in the over!</b> And a ball to come still"
"full and into leg stump, flicked to midwicket's right"

"<b>and that is that.</b> Richardson takes it pitch side off his own bowling. Good length ball at the stumps, Sodhi clears the front leg and gives it a big heave. It's a skier and taken comfortably around hort midwicket"
