saved by the bat. Or is he? This skids through from back of a length and thuds into his pad in front of middle stump as he gets on the back foot. Plumb if there's no edge on it. Umpire has said not out. Chandimal reviews. He has walked well across the stumps....and replays show it is <b>pad first.</b> He's a long way across and I can see leg stump on the replay as this strikes the pad. Impact <b>just in line</b> of off stump. Only just. Would have been umpire's call if it was a centimeter to the right. But it isn't. He's trapped and he's out. Decision overturned.

This was slow, tossed right up at middle stump. He'd been flicking this for the most part, but now he exposes the stumps, and plonks his leg across to the off side. The ball is well away from where his foot is. He's locked and he can't get low because of the line. Hands come down late, ball sneaks under the bat and leg stump is tonked"
