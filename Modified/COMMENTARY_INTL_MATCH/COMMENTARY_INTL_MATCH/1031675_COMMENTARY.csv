"pitched up full on off stump, jabbed defensively into the covers"

"angled across the southpaw Gayle, who steers another single wide of mid-off"
"short of a length, on the body and tucked through backward square leg"
bit of shape in and Gayle gets an inside edge to the leg side

"pitched up, bit of a half-volley but Hope pings his drive straight to mid-off"
"full length in the channel and Hope punches another drive to mid-off, slightly closing the face when he wanted to go through cover"
"slightly short, in the channel, Gayle steps away <b>and carves it into the crowd again!</b> Four sixes in a row for the 'Universe Boss', who is coming down hard on Ball's case... Not a bad delivery, really, but muscled off a length"
"short, swings hard again, will it go for six to third man...? No, not quite! Bounces just short of the rope and goes for four"
"full outside off, Gayle moves his front leg and <b>booms it back over long-off!</b> See Ball, hit Ball for Gayle at the moment"
"this time he follows him as he moves to leg, jammed for one off his pads"
"fired into the pads and Hope whips it away through midwicket, he runs the two almost before Gayle had completed one"
"that's a good ball, finishes with a dot, some respite for Ball as he whistles one past the outside edge"
"Curran tames the beast for a moment, full and swinging, defended"
"Gayle shimmies in the crease, full and straight, a slower ball from Curran, chipped down the ground - <b>and Plunkett holds a blinder!</b> First ODI wicket for Curran and it's the Big One, really canny bowling, Gayle losing control as he looked to clear the ropes again, back-of-the-hand delivery and Plunkett sprinted back from mid-off to hold it diving full length"
"pitched up outside off, tapped into the covers"
"slightly overpitched, on the stumps and Hope crisply strokes four back past mid-on, nicely played again - he's looking a bit more at home against the white ball than he did during the Tests"

driven on the up square through the off side
"back of a length at off stump, pushed into the covers"

"full outside off, pushed back to the bowler"

"worked off the stumps straight of midwicket, Roy manages to slide and flick the ball back into the non-striker's stumps but Mohammed is home"

"angled in full at off stump, 85mph, defended to cover"

Rod Tucker has a flick through the angles available but can't give him out on the evidence available"

"on the stumps, worked down the ground for one"

tossed up and chopped into the covers
"pushed through flat and wide of the stumps, cut firmly to deep point"
"too straight from Rashid, sits up and Hope adjusts rapidly to rock back and swing a pull away - that's his fourth four in four balls, having gone 77 deliveries without!"
"flighted, prodded through the covers"
"steps out, tries to hit down the ground... but it's not got the elevation <b>and Root takes a running catch wide of long-off!</b> Mohammed punches his bat in frustration, maybe got done in the flight and the shot skewed short of the rope"
"googly from Rashid, played off the back foot and worked firmly to midwicket"
"pitched up and driven, there's bat involved and <b>Buttler can't hold on leaping to his right!</b> Actually, I think that was a bump ball, as Hope chopped down on it... Still a good bit of work to stop it flying away"
"fired in on off, pushed towards cover"
"good length, driven on off stump and he still can't get it through the ring"
"fired in full, dug out back to the bowler"
"slower ball, outside off and Hope can only pat it to point"

"fired in, Ambris prods one through the covers"
"length outside off, Hope carves over the off side... <b>but this one sails straight to the man on the boundary!</b> Billings steadies himself and holds on above his head and Ball finally gets some reward for his flogging. Fine innings from Hope but he goes tying to lift the scoring"

"hits the pitch hard, Ambris taps into the covers and takes one"
"short, climbing outside off, Powell rides it and runs one to third man to get off the mark first ball"

"this one he gets hold of, <b>slugged down the ground for a Dorothy!</b> Sweet connection from Nurse and it sails over long-on"
