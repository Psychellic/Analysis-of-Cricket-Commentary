"<b>slapped for four!</b> Starts around the wicket, and pitches outside off. Narine backs away, makes some extra room, and crunches this past the diving cover fielder. Tripathi the man who couldn't stop it"
"aaaand stumped! Narine came dancing down the wicket, but Gowtham dropped his length. Pitches it just outside off and the ball spins away from Narine. He misses, and Klaasen whips the bails off in no time. Big, big wicket!"
"length ball on off, and spinning into Uthappa. Keeps his eyes on the ball and nudges it off his pads to the leg side"
"full outside off, and spinning into Lynn. Tries to drive it towards midwicket, but it takes a leading edge! Falls in front of cover point"
"full just outside off, and nicely driven straight down the ground. Gowtham gets his hands behind the ball, but it ricochets towards mid off. They jog across for one"
"<b>gone through everybody!</b> Attempts the reverse sweep, but the ball spins sharply down the leg side. Won't be called a wide since Uthappa changed his stance, but Klaasen can't hold onto that either"
"<b>drops just short of mid on!</b> It was full on off, and Lynn goes for a slog towards the leg side. Comes off the bat's inside half and lobs in the air. Lands between midwicket and mid on"
"length ball just outside off, and angling in slightly. Uthappa drops his gloves and plays it towards the leg side off the back foot"
"quick! Full on middle, but going down the leg side. Lynn did go chasing after it, but couldn't manage to clip it off his hips"
"mistimed this time. Archer pitched it on middle, but the ball jagged in sharply. Hits the shoulder of his bat, and goes towards square leg"
"shaping into the right-hander, but just a bit too much! Back of a length on middle, but angling down the leg side"
"carbon copy! Pitches on middle, but the ball shapes into his body and then down the leg side. The umpire spreads his arms wide again"
"length ball on off, and angling in once more. Uthappa adjusts on this occasion, and nudges it off his body towards the leg side. Doesn't look comfortable at all"
"back of a length on off, but Archer's really getting some pace. The ball gets some extra bounce, and hits his glove. Uthappa was merely trying to defend it off the front foot"
"quick single to end the over. Back of a length once more, but Uthappa gets inside the line of the ball and defends with soft hands. Cover's too far, so Uthappa can call for the run"
"<b>leading edge, and caught by the bowler!</b> Tossed it up, and Uthappa tried to work it towards the leg side. Through his shot too early, and the ball lobs straight back to KG. Big jump from the big man, and he manages to hold on to it. Two wickets in seven balls for Gowtham"

"just a bit more air offered, and Lynn smacks this through the cover region. Winds up early, waits for the ball to land, and then slaps it through the off side"
"wants a single, but sent back! Full just outside off, and carved off the front foot to cover point. Lynn's halfway down, but he's been asked to go back"
"Back of a length, but outside off stump. Rana chooses to shoulder his arms, and the carry to the keeper is quite promising"
"length ball outside off, but angling in slightly. Opens his bat's face and taps it through cover point. Chase for the man in the deep, but he manages to intercept"
"short! This time it's aimed on middle stump, and Rana backs away trying to cut it over slip. Pulls out of the shot eventually though"
"disaster! Mistimed to midwicket. Full on off, and Rana looks for the release shot. Attempts to slog it over midwicket, but it's sliced. Easy as ABC for Unadkat"
"full on off, and defended off the front foot. Tapped back to the bowler."
"and almost goes there first up! It was full on middle, and DK comfortably whips it off his legs past the square-leg region. Well timed, and there's no one there in the deep. Four welcome runs for KKR"

"just a bit of extra rip for the final ball. Full on off, and worked off his legs to the backward square region. Enough time to come back for the second"
"fuller outside off, DK leans into this wide half-volley and lofts this inside-out over cover point. Lovely"
"another teasing half-volley outside off, belted through the line between cover and mid-off. Very poor from the most expensive Royals' buy."

looks to sweep but this was spinning away sharply from outside off. <strong>Beaten</strong>
"punched straight back to Shreyas. Big wicket! Another googly that he lands on length outside off, this stopped on Lynn as he looked to punch, checked his stroke and Shreyas takes the simple offering on his followthrough. KKR in some trouble."

"googly which he didn't get to the pitch off, <strong>thick inside edge past leg stump</strong> to short fine leg"
"steered fine down to the third man fielder! Sodhi's dive stops the boundary. It was a length ball outside off, that DK opted to open his bat's face to"
"carbon copy, and this time it's a more composed stop from Sodhi. Length ball outside off once again, and DK uses his wrists to open his bat's face late"
"fuller, and just outside off. Driven to Gopal at mid off this time"
"uses the pace to play it fine, and KKR are third time lucky! Sodhi was fine enough, but this time the ball flew off the bat, and third man can't cut it off"
"back of a length on the fourth-stump line, and Gill punches it off the back foot. Plays it square to the cover point region on this occasion"
"off the bat's shoulder, but lands safe! Length ball on off, but takes some extra bounce. He tried to nudge it towards the leg side, but the ball flies away towards point instead"
"tossed up on off, and driven off the front foot. Excellent stop by Tripathi there to keep it down to one"
"attempts that Kohli-esque inside out drive, but can only play it to long off. It was full on off, and tempting for the youngster"
"full just outside off, and spinning into DK this time. Defended off the back foot"
"flat on middle and leg, and worked off his pads to deep backward square. They walk across for the one"
"length ball, wide outside off. Which basically means it's a googly. Gill rocks back, and punches it straight. Gopal stops it on his follow through"
"pitches on middle, and that's been flicked to square leg. The region's vacant so they take a quick single. Gill wants the second, but that's a resounding 'no' from DK"
"length ball on middle, and turning across the batsman's body. Punched off the back foot towards midwicket on this occasion"
"flighted, and lands full on off. Karthik takes a big stride forward, gets to the pitch of the ball, and then drives through the delivery's line. Goes to long off"
"<b>whipped!</b> Full on off, and he drags it to wide long on. Great uses of the wrists to direct it there, but Binny's dive ensures it's not a four. More runs saved by Binny tonight"
"back of a length, on middle and leg. Gill goes onto the back foot and turns it off his pads to midwicket"
"flighted on off, and he comes down the wicket before driving to long on. Easy single"
"not afraid to flight the ball. Lands on middle, and entices the batsman to drive. Gill's through with his shot early, and it comes off his toe end. Still manages to find enough behind it, to take it to the fielder at long off"
"flat on off, and DK walks across to the off side. Gets down on one knee, and paddles it to deep backward square. Work for Unadkat in the deep"
"full outside off, and turning further away. Driven with the bat's open face to cover point on this occasion"
"good length outside off, and that's been cut furiously past point! Proper cricket shot, and that breaches the infield. KKR getting a move on, now"
"<b>going, going, gone!</b> Teases Archer at long off, but goes just beyond him. Full on off, and Gill was quick to shimmy down the ground. Full swing of the bat thereafter"
"length ball on off, but spinning into Gill. Taps it off the back foot to point"
"<b>there's the fifty partnership!</b> Yuuuge over. Half-tracker outside off and Karthik rocks back to earn some extra time. Swivels, and then pulls it over cow corner. Expensive!"
"<b>thumped!</b> Through point this time! Loose ball first up. Wide outside off, and Gill sent this powerfully for four"
"cramps him for space, and finds the edge! Back of a length on off and zipping straight through. Gill chose to cut, but it was close to his body. Finds the bat's top edge, and Klaasen makes no mistake. An exciting innings comes to an end"
"length ball outside off, but Russell was thinking of making room already. Eventually forced to reach at it, and punches it to cover"
"short! Pitches on middle, and soars straight through to Klaasen. Russell had made some room to pull, perhaps, but played no shot"
"short on middle, and goes straight through to Klaasen again. Russell chooses not to play any shot, knowing that's too high. <B>No ball for height</b>. Free hit..."
"<b>maximum use of the free hit!</b> Full on leg stump, and Russell gets his front leg out of the way before depositing it over the long-on boundary. Raw power"

square turn from leg stump to take a thick outside edge that rolls to short third man. <strong>Squared up completely</strong>
"through with the pull too early, this googly spun back in, took ages to arrive. Hits him in the midriff. Could've had a cup of tea and then pull"
rocks back and cuts straight to backward point. Superb over.
"scooped him up and over the keeper's head, straight scoop for six. Half-century for DK. He was looking away while trying to use the pace, got a big, <strong>fat top-edge that just flew.</strong> This is injustice"
steps out and wallops this length ball to sweeper cover
"<b> just over Samson's outstretched hands at wide long-on! </b> This is a slower length ball that spins away from outside off, Russell backs away and fetches this slap from outside off, ends up dragging it but still manages enough"
Jaydev hasn't learnt. Keeps giving width and keeps getting whacked! Russell clears his front leg and slaps this to the extra cover boundary. Very poor
"slower and fuller, lucky to get away with that. Russell mistimes this slog over cover to the fielder at the edge of the ring"
works this off length from middle to deep midwicket
"toe-ends this lofted hit and Rahane, moving backwards from the edge of the ring at cover, takes an excellent catch. Not easy, but he covered ground nicely. Big wicket, but DK's played a gem. Good execution of the slower ball, there as no pace to work with for DK."
"sitting up nicely for the pull, Russell has muscled this over deep midwicket. Too short, not the best delivery to bowl at this stage. Russell didn't get it anywhere near the middle but still managed to clear it"
"bounce and angled in from wide of the crease, Russell looks to pull, the ball deflects off the thigh pad to short fine leg"
"tails in late, yorker-length on middle, squeezed to midwicket"
Beaten! Backs away to carve this over point but Laughin shortened his length and angled it in to cramp him for room.

"looks to swing this slower delivery over cow corner, beaten. Played too early"
"walks across to sweep this full delivery outside off, beaten. Just give the strike to Russell, mate!"

"right into the blockhole, he backs away to go over cover but can only manage to squeeze it back to the bowler"
"slower short of length ball that got stuck into the pitch, Russell backed away, held his shape very nicely and then flat-batted this over long-off. Deep into the stands. Lined himself up superbly. <strong>Forehand for six</strong>"
backs away and belts this juicy full toss to sweeper cover. Just eight despite that six.
"veers in a yorker but just ends up slipping this down, Russell manages to get out of the way. Wide. Can't fault him for the effort"
"too far wide outside off. Russell has the presence of mind, lets it go. He was initially backing away, so Laughlin went outside off. Just outside the wide line"
"swung away to the wide long-on boundary. This was a mishit but didn't matter. Backed away, and swung this from outside off"
"backed away to swing this full toss over deep midwicket, but misses and hits his pads. Angled in and would've missed leg"
"mistimes a swing off a thick inside edge to long on, Samson hared in even as he hit it"
"has he timed this? No. Excellent catch by Archer running around from long-off. The good thing though is they've crossed over, so Russell will be on strike. Archer had to be mindful of the long-on fielder running across too, but he stopped in his tracks to allow Archer to complete it."
"backs away and drills this fuller delivery to the extra cover boundary. Laughlin didn't miss his length by much, went for a yorker and got punished. Long-off was no more than three metres away from the ball, had no chance"
"yorker, squeezed to the off side as they scamper a single. Russell finishes on 49."
"<b>falls in no man's land!</b> Leading edge, and the ball teasingly soars over cover's head. Full on leg, and Rahane tried to play it towards square leg. Lucky, lucky"
"back of a length outside off, and he misses the cut. The ball takes the bottom edge and goes to DK. Russell falls over on his follow through, but looks okay"
"length ball just outside off. Angling into Rahane, so he fends it off the back foot. Tapped towards Tripathi at the non-striker's"
"carved over point! Uses the pace to cut it over the infield! Width offered outside off, and easily done by Ajinkya Rahane. Looks so good"
"on off stump, and Rahane taps it with soft hands towards wide mid on. Will get Tripathi on strike"
"goes short, and Tripathi rides the bounce. Fends it off the back foot and carefully sees the over out"
"full on off, and he's through his front-foot drive too quickly. Comes off the bat's top half, and lands just in front of the bowler"
"back of a length outside off, but angling into Tripathi. Tries an extravagant cut, and the ball finds the edge of his bat. Sliced to third man"
"Tripathi backs away so Prasidh follows him. Full outside leg, and Tripathi can't drag it towards the leg side. Hits the handle of his bat, and the bat goes flying! They take the single though"
"full on off, and that's drifting into his pads. Rahane takes a step forward, gets inside the line of the ball, and then drives it past midwicket for a classy four"
"full outside off, and Rahane chooses to defend it towards cover point. Played with soft hands"
"length ball on off, and he fails to work it successfully towards the leg side. Defended eventually"
"<b>beautiful!</b> Tripathi's a different batsman when he opens. It was flighted just outside off, and he leans into an excellent drive. Sweetly timed"
"flatter ball, on leg stump. Tripathi nudges it towards the vacant square leg region, but they settle for only the single"
"good length outside off, but it's the wrong'un this time. Turns sharply into the batsman, and he punches it to cover point"
"<b>given!</b> But will Rahane review? Yes he does. It was a skidder, that hit Rahane really low. The googly again that forces the error from the batsman. Way too much spin on offer, so wonder if that would've gone down leg. Replay time. And it's <b>missing the stumps!</b> Rahane survives."
"angling into his pads once again, and Rahane turns it off his pads to the fielder in the deep on the leg side"
"it's the google again. Lands outside off, and jags into the batsman's pads. Tries to cut, but too close to his body. Checks that shot, and chops it down to point in the end"
"finds the gap! Pitches outside off, and he was quick to gauge the short length. Flawlessly pulled, and placed perfectly between the two fielders in the deep"
"too short, and Rahane won't let those go. Cuts it, and the ball flies over point once again. Could've gone for six, but lands just short of the boundary"
"good length on off, and that's been played to the midwicket fielder off the front foot. Calls early for the single"
"back of a length on off, and cramps the batsman for space this time. Defended towards cover, and that allows them to steal a single"
"full on off, and that's been driven down the ground. Played to mid off, and Chawla does well to intercept it"
"slower ball, but wide outside off. Tripathi waits for eternity trying to cut, but he misses. Wants the 'wide call' but the umpire isn't interested"
"slips this down leg, will have to rebowl that"
"spinning back into middle and leg from length, turned wide of square leg"
"sharp turn from middle and leg, hit on the thigh pad as he looks to whip this square"
"down on one knee as he swings this over long-on. Clean strike, too full and get got underneath the flight nicely to back his strengths and clear the ropes."
"goes big, clears the ropes again. This clears deep midwicket. This is the carrom bal that spins away from off, used his height to stretch forward, down on one knee and bang"
"saved by an inside edge! Flatter length ball on off, he is struck on the pad but was very clearly a big edge. <strong>KKR review nevertheless, and lose one</strong>"
turns this shortish delivery gently behind square for an easy single
"He survived in the previous over but the lost review doesn't cost KKR. Tripathi chips this back and Chawla puts his right hand out on the followthrough to pluck that off running to the left. Tripathi jabbed at this googly, got it high on the bat and it lobbed. Eden roars"

"paddled nicely down towards fine leg. Kuldeep went flat, so he had pace to work with."

"whips this from outside off towards deep midwicket, aggressive running"

"too short, and punished! Samson opens up the leg side and pulls this to the right of deep midwicket."

"too full, googly that he smothers nicely to ease this to long off"
"lofted with the spin, clean strike inside-out to the sweeper cover boundary. Lovely timing"
"length ball, and too wide outside off. Comfortably cut off the back foot to deep point. A loose ball to start his spell"
"pulled with disdain! Played so casually. Back of a length outside off, and Samson's so quick to play that kind of shot. Excellently played over cow corner"
"punches this drive in the air, but it falls short of point. Length ball outside off again"
"width offered again, and Samson cuts it late enough for it to go between point and short third man. Absolutely played to perfection on this occasion"
"slower ball, but wide outside off. Mistimes his cut to the off side, but has enough time to take the single"
"chance of a run out, but misses! Length ball outside off, and it's been steered to short third man. They want the single, and they're going for it! Safe eventually"

"low full toss outside off, and Rahane drives through the line. It trickles away to cover"
"length ball on leg stump, and turning into his pads. Tapped towards the non-striker"

"full on off, but Rahane takes a step forward and smothers it towards cow corner. Man there though"
"flatter ball, and it turns away from the batsman. Tries to punch it towards cover, but comes off the bat's inside edge. It trickles down to midwicket, and Samson returns for two"
"almost a yorker on middle stump, and Samson's straight drive takes an inside edge. The ball ricochets onto his toes"

"misses the pull completely! Back of a length just outside off, but the ball stays low. Rahane misses the shot"

"goes for a wild swing, but misses completely! The ball hits his front pad, but impact's on leg stump. That would never have gone on to hit the stumps"
"<b>sent into the stands!</b> Uses the depth of the crease to make use of Narine's length. Slightly short, and it's been pulled to cow corner"
"<b>in the air, but short of cover!</b> Full outside off and turning into the batsman. He's through his drive too early, so the ball lobs up. Safe eventually"
"<b>caught and bowled, once again!</b> Tossed up on leg stump, and it's the wrong'un. Rahane prepares to sweep, but he's played it way too early. Comes off the bat's toe end, and the leading edge is swallowed by the bowler"
