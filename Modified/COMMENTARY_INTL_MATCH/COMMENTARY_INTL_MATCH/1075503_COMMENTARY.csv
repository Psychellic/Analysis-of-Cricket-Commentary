"back of a length at off stump, skewed off the outside edge through point"
<b>holes out to deep square leg.</b> Probably instinct to go after the short one after copping one on the helmet. This cramps him at chest height and he swipes it straight to the fielder who is 15 yards in from the boundary
<b>yorker</b> at leg stump. Does very well to keep it out
<b>dabs it wide of short leg</b> as he looks to get on top of this. It's climbing at his rib cage
<b>nearly run out</b> after he does very well to defend this bouncer. It rises sharply from a length and he takes his bottom hand off as he fends at it. It runs wide of short leg who swivels and throws at the non-strikers end. <b>He was short of the crease</b>. Mid-on can't get in position to back up
"<b>top edge</b> lands wide of fine leg and goes into the boundary. Another short one at middle stump, and he's not one to leave"
"<b>misses the outside edge and the off stump</b> by slender margins. This is full and angled away from the left-hander, who is camping on the back foot and pokes lazily at this, with both middle and off visible"
"<b>dead ball.</b> Short one at leg stump, he leaps to try and evade this. It deflects off the thigh guard and runs fine. But the umpire doesn't think he was evading"
"<b>fends it off the chest</b> past de Kock. Bouncer climbs rapidly, it's in the air as he hits it, but it's well wide of the keeper"
<b>pulls in the air</b> but wide of deep square. No control as he takes on the bouncer
"good length, angled in at off stump. Defended down the pitch"
"<b>edged</b> but wide of third slip. Back of a length in the corridor, rises on him as he looks to defend. He didn't get behind the line and it was a fend in the end. Elgar can't reach it with a dive to his right"
"back of a length at off stump, defended off the back foot"
"bouncer, too short, too far down the leg side. A rare bad ball"
"<b>inside edge</b> onto boot. Looks to drive this full ball through the covers, but the feet aren't moving"
"short one at middle stump, jumps, defends"
"good length at off stump, pushed to extra cover on the up"

It appeared to be going down leg side. <b>They've reviewed...</b>in fact, replays show it hit the front pad first, which was further down leg. Wickets is <b>umpire's call</b> so the decision remains. No loss of review."
"short of good length and spinning away outside off, punched to the point region"
"shortish, pitching outside leg and angling across the left-hander, Imrul rides the bounce and drops it in front of point"
"ooh, that's a nasty blow. Mushfiqur has been hit flush on the helmet. He has dropped down on his knees and has taken his helmet off. He's down in some pain clutching the side of his head. This doesn't seem good at all. It was a short ball, Mushfiqur was really tucked up and had little time to react. He ended up taking his eyes off the ball and wore it bang on the side of his head. The South African doctor rushes out to meet him as well. They need to confirm if there has been a concussion. He is back up now which is a wonderful sign. That seemed horrible. Change of helmet being called for"
"more of the short ball. Olivier isn't one to relent. This one's banged in halfway down but angled down the leg side which means Mushfiqur isn't quite in the firing line like the previous time. And besides, he does well this time to get well under it and does so well in time"

"short ball, slightly wide outside off, gets on top of the bounce and drops it down"

"short ball, pitches outside leg, he gets under it but the ball barely goes over his back as it doesn't climb much"

"full around off, spinning away, defended"
"short of a length, not much turn, just about straightens around off but Mushfiqur makes enough room to crack a cut off the backfoot through point"
"now Mahmudullah has been hit on the helmet. Again, taking his eyes off the ball. Short ball, comes on dead straight to him and the ball pings the helmet and goes to the cordon where Amla tips it over. The impact wasn't as forceful this time"
""
<b>in the air and just short of gully</b>. Opens the face of his bat slightly to this short of a length ball outside off and the ball goes on the bounce in front of the fielder. Needs to be careful when doing that

"fullish, angled across the off-stump of Mushfiqur who is sure of it and lets it go"
"fullish, pitching just around off and nipping away late, Mushfiqur shoulders arms"
"full, pushed across a long way, not going to make him play with that line"
"error in judgement from Mushfiqur. Lets one go but has worn it on the pad. Top delivery from Parnell, though. Mushfiqur wasn't entirely wrong in letting it go. Like the previous deliveries, this one's angled across. Pitches on a length around middle and leg. Mushfiqur plants the front foot across and lifts his bat but the ball nips in ever-so-slightly very late to hit the pad. Mushfiqur opts for a review. Replays show that the impact is in line and the ball would have just about clipped off stump so the umpire's call remains"
