bad start. All about discipline from the start. Goes down for an extra and South Africa are off. Already need to pull things back
"much much better. Full delivery outside off, de Kock leaves. Not much swing. None actually"
"excellent line from Amir. On a length around off, no swing but impeccable line. Blocked away"
"full and straight again, tight line. Defended by de Kock."
"nicely played. On a length outside off, just enough room for de Kock to bend his knees and cut through point. Just timing. Third man gets across first"
"fuller than good length outside off, still not much movement but left alone comfortably."
"good finish. On a length again, around off, played back towards his pad."
"carved to third man. Short and slightly wide outside off, slashed away on the bounce to third man for a run."
"good length down leg, played away quietly towards square leg"
"finds the gap. Lovely stroke. Full outside off, just punched through extra cover for a couple."
"fullish and straight, towards leg. Still no swing. Pushed towards mid-on. Full face of the bat"
"short and wide, was there for the cut and Amla cuts. But makes no contact. Extra bounce maybe?"
"lovely hit. Just a tad inconsistent with their lengths, this is overpitched and beautifully driven on the up to cover. Dot."
"shortish length down leg, de Kock wants to leave it but it's on the leg stump line. Flicks his thigh pad on the way to the keeper"
"excellent delivery. Pitching it up, hopefully to try and swing it, but there is none available. De Kock forced to defend"
"some inward wobble. Good length outside off, swinging back in. If there is some swing, that line is awesome. Swerves back in, hits de Kock's thigh pad."
"beautiful this. Fullish, straight, defended towards point."
"141 kph, <b>out if he hit.</b> Full on the pads, worked to mid-on for a terribly-judged single. Mid-on picks up cleanly, Shoaib Malik misses the stumps at the non-strikers end. Pakistan's best fielder."
"on the pads again, Amla will pick em off day and night. Worked through square leg for a couple"
"full delivery outside off, no swing. A thick inside edge into an unpleasant area. Tentative"
"<strong>big appeal, high</strong>. Full, straight, quick, accurate. Beats de Kock's inside edge, struck on the pad. Going high."
"the first boundary of the day. Good length outside off, de Kock cuts, but there isn't the room he wants. Takes the edge and goes through the vacant third slip region. Lovely bowling this"
"back of a length this time, using that length for the first time today. Defended towards leg with that bottom hand"
"fullish outside off, defended"
"another lovely shot. Back of a length outside off, punched to point from the back foot"
"bouncer over leg stump, rises a long way and forces Sarfraz to jump and parry it with an outstretched right hand after Amla ducks. Wide signalled - side-on replays show it wasn't really necessary for him to duck"

"back of a length, close to off stump, punched to short extra-cover"
"fuller now, slanted into the corridor outside off, left alone"
"another bouncer, down the leg side this time. Amla misses the hook. Sarfraz's attempt to distract the umpire by appealing for caught behind doesn't work. Signalled wide"
"back of a length on middle and off, nice line, defended right under his eyes, with soft hands. Ball rolls to backward point"
"full, close to off stump, punched to the left of mid-off"
"back of a length, angling into middle stump, worked away through midwicket"
"that terrific line continues. Full, straight, more off and middle than middle and leg. Clipped to square leg."
"fullish length on a fourth-stump channel, pushed to cover. 'Very well bowled, <em>beta</em>,' yells Sarfraz. It is pretty good bowling"
"not a bad ball, but still cut for runs. Shortish outside off, punched through point for three. The point fielder gets across to save one. Slow outfield, plenty of rain, all correlated"
"slower ball on off, no cut or turn. Nudged to square leg. Just be there for six balls."
"short. Bumper. Good line, outside off. The pull would have been a tough shot. De Kock leaves"
"flicked through midwicket for three, another slower ball on middle and leg. Merrily chipped. Pulled back again because of the slow outfield."
"good length, aiming for the top of off. Defended towards extra cover"

"good length and straight, clipped towards backward square leg for a run."
"slower offcutter on middle, guided towards point"
"fuller than a good length outside off, punched away towards cover"
"smashed away. Back of a length outside off, but Amla converts it into a bad ball by walking across and slapping the ball over square leg for four. Nicely done by Amla"
"full outside off, full enough to drive and de Kock leans into it. But a thick inside edge takes it down to fine leg"
"wow, that should not have been one. Good length on off, lovely line, but Amla gets outside the line, angles his bat in a way to bring his wrists into his flick down to fine leg. Not many do that better"
"straightish, on middle. Worked to wide mid-on for a run"
"too straight from Junaid. A cry of anguish. It wasn't Amla, who flicks the ball easily through square leg. Knew where the fielder was so didn't hit him"
"through again, two more. On a length on middle, shovelled off the inside half through square leg for a couple."
"a slower delivery, 134 kph, outside off, dabbed to gully."
"flat on leg and middle, worked to square leg. Defensive bowling, from around the wicket"
"that's plumb. Amla doesn't bother reviewing. Amla tries to do what he normally does, walk across and manufacture a single. But Imad is always accurate. Delivers it with the seam rotating parallel to the ground. It pitches, and carries on to strike Amla in front of middle and off. Intentionally not trying to turn it has worked."
"full, straight, accurate. Pushed to cover."
"full and straight again, giving absolutely nothing away. No turn. Blocked"
"straight, too straight maybe and du Plessis flicks to backward square to get one"
"that's width. An unusual offering, he rarely provides width. De Kock, too, taken aback slightly misses a routine cut. Maybe there was extra bounce."
"gun straight. No turn. Full outside off, pushed to cover"
"quick outside off, 87 kph. Faf's bottom hand takes it to long-on for a run."

"flat 0on off, nudged to midwicket"

"quick outside off, blocked towards point"
"should have done better but that's not an error at least. Full outside off, pushed to mid-off where the fielder is late on the ball. De Kock gets through for one."
"flat on off, blocked"
"quick, and flat. Nice length. Played away into the off side. Dot."
"well bowled. Sees de Kock coming and fires it down leg. Flicked to deep square leg, where Fakhar fails to pick up cleanly, enabling a second run. Sarfraz yells. Pakistan confidence dented in the field"
nudged towards midwicket
"flat on the pads, worked away to deep midwicket. Not one ball has turned"
"big appeal. No, says the umpire Illingworth. And Pakistan don't review. Full on the pads, de Kock misses a flick and is struck in front of leg. The ball ricochets towards Sarfraz, De Kock was out of his crease. But he is already up in appeal. Sliding down, I presume. <b>All reds on HawkEye</b>, out on review."

"shortish on off, shovelled to midwicket"
again. Looks to whip to midwicket. It's full so it's not dangerous. Finds midwicket though
"absolutely dead in front. Another one lbw. Another one missing a straight ball. Flat on off, de Kock gets low and misses his sweep. Was that the wrong choice of stroke considering how full it was? Was it premeditated? No bat on that, and it's plumb indeed. Easy call for Illingworth"
"full and straight, defended"
"overly full, worked to midwicket from the straight line"
"that's great running. AB did not even look at where the ball had gone, complete trust in Faf's call. Faf said yes, AB said kay. Worked to midwicket. A lesson in running between two equally quick runners"
"AB's gone first ball. What? Wow. South Africa in tatters. Flat and wide from Imad. It does nothing but go on with the arm. But it was so wide that AB had to reach out for that so much that it skews off the outside half. Straight to point who takes a reverse-cupped catch. Massive wicket. Humongous moment in the game. AB hasn't score much since SA have arrived in England, not by his standards at least."

"oh my goodness, what a sensational delivery that is! Like the last one, it's angled in from around the wicket, and like the last one it straightens. This one, though, isn't quite as full as the previous ball - it's on the perfect length, leaving Parnell rooted to the crease - and its initial line is directed towards middle stump, before the movement takes it past the outside edge of the left-hander's defensive bat to crash into off stump.

"slower, straight ball. Morris anticipates something else, backs away and improvises a sliced cut to third man"
"given! Was that sliding down? Was there some bat? Umpire Illingworth gives it, <strong>and Miller reviews. </strong>A superb yorker, full and straight. Was there some reverse swing there? Either way, there was no bat on that as Miller fell over his shot, done in by pace and plenty of movement. <strong>Missing leg stump says HawkEye</strong>, and that decision is overturned. Good review, used judiciously through the innings and SA still in this."
another terrific yorker from Junaid. On middle. Jammed out nicely.
"cleaned 'im up this time, but Junaid has overturned. Beautiful and ugly in one ball. Sensational and awful. Big no-ball. Good call  by umpire Ravi. On a length on middle, Morris is beaten by pace, goes through his half-flick and knocks into middle stump. Free hit."
"good comeback but has himself to blame not to have a wicket. A yorker on off, pushed tamely to mid-off"

another yorker. Terrific stuff. Just great. Kept out though. This is sensational cricket. Not easy to play this. Pakistan's execution has been quite exemplary

"another yorker outside off, jammed away to mid-off for one."
"full and straight, driven to long-on."
"a low full toss on off, moving back late. Worked to deep midwicket"
"and gone. Big wicket. Full delivery on off, Morris wanted to go over mid-off, a good option, but at this level you have to execute almost perfectly. Morris doesn't, the bat handle turns in his hands and he just lobs a drive to long-on off the inside half. What that means is the SA lower order is now exposed to the swinging, reversing ball."
"yorker outside off, pushed to mid-off for a run. Vital <b>fifty for Miller</b>, his slowest in ODIs, but it's one of his best."
"chipped to mid-on, on the bounce. Full and straight, Rabada is low, waiting for that yorker. Just bunts the full length"
"there is that yorker on middle, Pushed away to point for a run. Pakistan, led by Junaid, think this has hit Rabada's toe front. And<strong> so they review. </strong>If it was toe first, it's out. But the toe isn't close to the ball. And so it's an error from Junaid. I hope he thought it actually hit the toe first as opposed to hoping that it had. Could be crucial in a few overs"
"nicely played. Full and wide outside off, pushed to the sweeper cover."
"nice change in length. Goes short outside off, Miller misses an upper cut. Good option from Amir."
"fullish delivery on middle and leg, Miller misses it, ricochets down to third man. Was it sliding down? Yes, says Illingworth"

"on the pads, worked to short fine leg for an easy single eventually. Keeping Miller on a tight leash"
"nicely bowled, worked to deep midwicket. Miller scurries back for two. A misfield by Shadab. That's one run saved by SA with their running"
"and again. Chipped towards long-on for two more. Hit quite badly, and so the second is a stroll."
"there it is. Full, straight and in his arc. Where has it gone? Up and away. Powered over mid-off, use of that bottom hand to get underneath the length. His muscle does the rest"
"a short, slow bouncer is very high. Miller misses an upper cut. Wide called."
"another short, loopy slower ball outside off is carved to the sweeper cover for a single. That's two for the over."
"a low full toss on middle, hammered past Miller for a run to long-on. This is good stuff from Rabada, all you can ask for"
"another slower ball on leg, flicked away to square leg. Just one."
"that will do nicely. Good length outside off, Rabada swings, and gets bat on it. A thick outside edge through the slips region for four. The worst type of four to concede"
"superb catch by Hasan Ali. Full outside off, Rabada wants to go over long-on but can only skew the ball towards a slightly deep cover. Hasan tracks it early, importantly judges it early, gets across to his right, gets underneath it and takes a lovely catch. Made a terribly difficult catch look terribly simple. Asks for some noise from the crowd."
swung away to deep square leg. Denies the run. On a length on leg
"a slower ball on middle, Miller misses a swing. Excellent execution of the slower ball, beat Miller with the lack of pace"
"shortish delivery on middle and leg, pulled away to deep midwicket who fumbles and allows the second. That was clattered, good effort from Shadab to save two there"
"another dot. Full and straight on off, finds mid-off."
"a slower delivery down leg, swung away but finds short fine leg. Another dot. Vital runs missed but the right tactic"
"finds the gap to finish. Back of a length outside off, slapped away past cover for four. Sensational timing. That;s his first four. Just six off the final over."
"full outside off, driven to cover point"
"fullish, angling in from wide of the crease. It's a teasing line close to off stump but Azhar judges it well and leaves it alone"
"back of a length, angling into off stump. Gets back and across and blocks to midwicket"
"ooh, extra bounce in the corridor. Goes back to defend and the ball smacks him on the bottom glove. Does well not to jab too hard at it, keeps it down in the direction of backward point"
"length ball on off stump, defended back to Rabada"
"back of a length, angling into leg stump, tucked away to the left of long leg to get Pakistan off the mark"
"length ball outside off, Fakhar leaves his first ball in ODIs alone"
"short, wide, and Fakhar is off the mark in style. A gift, and he accepts it, slashing it away over backward point"
"ooh, that's some steep lift, just outside off stump. Jumps from just short of good length and zips past the gloves as he tries to punch off the back foot"
"full outside off, nice stride out to push to the right of short cover. Early call, quick single easily completed"
"back of a length, slanting away from off stump, Azhar leaves"
"length ball close to off stump, shuffles across and looks to clip into the midwicket region. The angle means he plays it too close to the bowler's follow-through to get a single"
"in the blockhole on middle and off, blocked back to the bowler"
"full on off stump, driven to mid-off, who comes in quickly to cut off the single"
"<b>ouch</b>. Looks for the bouncer, leg-stumpish, too quick for Fakhar. Swivels to hook, and the ball hits his helmet grille before hitting the glove and then the back of his bat. Could have gone to slip had it made better contact"
"fullish on off stump, pushed towards mid-off for a quick single. AB clutches his thigh after chasing and failing to pick up"
"shot! length ball on off stump, and that's a super shot. Just shows the full face and punches through the line, beats mid-off easily to his left. AB's hamstrings aren't in the best shape, and he doesn't chase with any real speed or intent"
"back of a length on leg stump, and Fakhar picks up another excellent quick single. Lets it come on, plays with a straight bat and soft hands to the left of midwicket"
"short outside off, not too much width but Zaman doesn't mind. Slaps it away at the top of its bounce and sends it racing through point"
"short, even more width this time, and this is all too easy for the debutant, flays it away and puts it into the gap to the left of backward point"
"back of a length, closer to off stump. Lets it come on and dabs it to third man"
"short ball, a bit of nip back in towards the body. Jumps to ride the bounce and tuck it into the leg side. Ball beats his inside edge and hits thigh pad"
"back of a length on off stump, lets it come on and tucks it neatly into the backward square leg region"
"back of a length outside off, lets it come on and uses his hands well to dab it to the right of backward point. Big mix-up between the batsmen as Fakhar turns back for the second before Azhar sends him back. Throw goes to the keeper's end, and that gives Fakhar just enough time to turn around, run back and dive in by the time the keeper can throw to the bowler's end. Throw misses anyway"
full on middle and leg. Gets his front pad out of the way and drives towards mid-on
"back of a length on off stump, punched crisply to backward point"
"wow. I thought he mishit that one. Length ball slanting across to off stump and he clears his front leg and swats it over mid-on. Seemed to hit the outside half of his bat - which turned a little as well - but the ball just flew, and went all the way over wide long-on"
"back of a length on off stump, not too much wrong with that ball, and he's cleared his front leg to make just a bit of room, and then flowed his bat through it with an open face to drive on the up to the right of cover point. Wow"
"length ball on off stump, clears his front leg and pushes towards mid-off. AB sprints in, dives, and throws on the dive towards the bowler's end. Is he injured or not?"
"length ball, fourth-stump line, Azhar presses forward and defends towards cover point"
"length ball on middle stump, worked away to the left of midwicket"
"back of a length, fourth-stump line, gets back and across and on his toes to defend into the on side"

"shortish outside off, jumps to get on top of the bounce and squirt a defensive dab into the point region"
"length ball on leg stump, clipped gently to the left of midwicket"
"short on off stump, and that's a good, early step back and across across to get into a great position for the short-arm pull to the right of square leg. Rolled his wrists over nicely on top of the bounce"
"back of a length on off stump, defended to mid-on"
"length ball outside off, steps forward confidently to push on the up into the covers"
"back of a length on off stump, defended to short midwicket"
"length ball on off stump, straightens just a touch. Azhar shows the full face to defend to mid-on"
"short ball from around the wicket, and he's taken another blow to that helmet. Side of the helmet after he top-edges a hook, and he just stands there and grins it off"
"superb bowling from Morkel. He's really earned this wicket. Set it up with that bouncer, and now he bowls a slower offcutter, just short of a good length on off stump. Zaman clears his front leg, perhaps looking for the pull, looking for the short ball. Picks the slower one late, only offers a feeble push, and the ball pops off the shoulder of the bat to slip"
"shortish outside off, punched to the right of third man"
"and another! Short ball this time, outside off, and Azhar goes for the ramp over the keeper. Middles it well enough, but third man is back - not perhaps the wisest choice of shot, therefore - and Tahir tumbles to his left as he takes the catch"
"ooh, excellent ball. Another short ball, this one jags back like an offbreak towards Babar's midriff. Manages to bring his bat around to work it around towards long leg"
"back of a length on off stump, defended into the on side"
"back of a length outside off, Hafeez offers a non-committal push and the thick edge falls short of slip. Didn't really jab at it, but there wasn't much else right with that shot"
"length ball, a little wider, left alone"
"back of a length on off stump, defended into the covers"
"back of a length, a little closer to off stump, lets it come on and blocks towards cover point"
"bouncer now, gets through quickly and angles into the batsman. Doesn't give him too much time to duck, and he only manages a half-crouch to evade it"
"shortish, close to off stump, gets on his toes to block towards backward point"
"ooh, straightens just a touch in the corridor and bounces steeply off a length. Half-forward to defend, beaten by a fair distance"
"back of a length, closer to off stump, defended into the point region"
"bouncer outside off, sinks to his knees and sways his upper body away from the line to leave it alone"
slower short ball wide of off. Keeps low and sneaks under Babar's attempted cut
"shortish in the corridor, a bit of seam away. Well played by Babar, withdrew his bat from the line to leave it"
"length ball, nips in late towards off stump. Babar doesn't commit early, lets it come and defends into the off side"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended into the point region"
"ooh, loose poke from Hafeez. Short in the corridor and he pokes at it. A bit of away movement beats his outside edge"
"and again, beaten. This one's a little wider. Goes for the punch away from the body this time, can't connect"
"back of a length, closer to off stump, punched towards cover point"
"fuller now, angling into off stump. Stays on the back foot and defends into the off side"
"back of a length in the corridor, defended into the covers"
back of a length outside off. Lets it come on and pushes towards backward point
"a run, after 20 successive dots. Back of a length, close to off stump. Waits an instant longer this time and chops it down to third man"
"a little fuller in the corridor, a bit of nip back in. Hafeez covers his stumps and shoulders arms"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"bouncer over off stump, Hafeez ducks"
"length ball, angling down leg this time. Gets his front leg in the way of the flick, and the ball hits the outside of his pad and rolls down to fine leg"
"shortish, a bit of nip back in towards off stump. Hafeez would usually look to pull this - he's a good puller - but he tries a tentative little whip instead and inside-edges into his pad"
"back of a length, too close to off stump to punch into the covers. Hafeez plays it squarer, down into the ground and bouncing up towards backward point"
"lucky, but as a batsman you need luck in certain situations. Shortish again, outside off. Punches away from his body and gets a thick edge that flies away wide of slip"
"shortish, angling into off stump. Chops down on top of the bounce and hits it hard into the ground. The ball bounces over the backward point fielder, who dives left, and third man stops it moving to his right"
"short, angling down leg, Babar misses the pull. Didn't extend his arms fully"
"length ball angling into leg stump, clipped to the left of long leg"
"short, a bit of width, cut away to the right of third man and they scamper through for two"
"back of a length on off stump, pushed into the point region"
"short ball outside off, rises steeply to beat Babar's attempted pull. De Kock is at full stretch to prevent four byes"
"short outside off, a bit of seam in to cramp Babar a little as he looks to cut. Hits the high part of the bat and rolls into the covers"

"back of a length outside off, lets it come on and guides it to third man"
"shortish again outside off, steered down to third man"

"full on off stump, clipped to midwicket"
"short outside off, chopped away to deep point"
"tossed up slow on middle and leg, blocked back to the bowler"
"full on leg stump, clipped to deep square leg"
"back of a length googly, turning into off stump. Goes back and across to tuck it to the left of backward square leg"
"short outside off, stabbed to backward point"
"just short of slip. Good length outside off, just enough outswing. Even more surprising because it was cross-seam. Takes the outside edge and lands in front."
"good length delivery outside off, Babar pokes at that and is beaten. Cannot be indecisive against these bowlers"
"fullish outside off, excellent line but length is great too. Seeing if there is enough nibble to get the outside edge. It is more a outside half as this goes down to third man"
"fullish around off, blocked. Excellent bowling"
"full outside off, carved towards point"
"superb over. On a length outside off, offering neither width nor the length they want. Hafeez defends."
"flight outside off, driven to cover. Keeps hitting fielders"
"flat outside off, Babar comes down but Tahir shortens the length and forces Babar to defend"
"a yorker on off, skewed back to the bowler"
quicker. Pushed through. Goes on with the arm. Babar punches to cover
"<strong>big appeal</strong>. Bat hitting ground. Flat and wide outside off, Babar drives but hits ground and not ball. Good non-review"
steered to the sweeper cover from the crease
"full and straight, driven back to the bowler. Morris picks up with his right hand and throws back. Aggression."
"back of a length on leg, Babar nonchalantly chips the ball over midwicket for a couple. Knew the field and lifted it over"
"good length outside off, guided to third man"
"gives himself room, it's straight. Definitely premeditated. Full and straight, Hafeez doesn't play the risk-reward game well. Gets away with this, sliced through point. Tahir, from third man, gets across to save one."
"good length around off, defended towards point. Good line"
"four. Excellently hit. Back of a length down leg, Babar pops inside the line and pulls. Because he made that effort to get inside the line, his pull goes fine. Fine enough for four to fine leg."
"a googly outside off, goes past the inside edge. Hits the elbow, goes through de Kock for a crucial run"
"flatter down leg, wide"
"bat-pad, or pad-bat? It's raining. Flat on off, and it hits the pad. <strong>AB reviews. </strong> De Kock said there was bat. Two clear botches on Snicko, one on the inside edge. But it looks like pad first. Definitely pad first, as is indicated by UltraEdge. Two reds, and one green. Can you believe it? Going over the stumps. Remember, it was a googly, so more revolutions on the ball and more bounce as a result."
"another googly that Babar doesn't pick. Flat on off, awkwardly played away"
"overpitched on off, driven away past the bowler's left who parries the ball"
"flat and wide, cut to point"
"legbreak outside off, carved to the sweeper cover"
"full and wide from Parnell, crisply driven through cover for a couple. Not a good start."
"full and wide outside off, left alone. Good. Use that angle"
"again. Good length outside off, left alone"
"again. Angled away outside off, Hafeez gets to his drive late. But beaten by just pure angle, a left-armer's"
"good length outside off, pushed away towards point. Dot."
"and again. Full and wide outside off, goes past Hafeez's outside edge again. Terrific comeback by Parnell"
"flat outside off, carved to the sweeper cover for one"
"a googly outside off, hafeez picks this, gets forward and defends"
"block, block, block, six. As long as you hit that six. Hafeez picks this too, gets down, gets to the pitch and lofts the ball over long-on for six."
"flat down leg, going down. Goes past Hafeez's inside edge. Struck on the pad"
"nicely slowed up outside off, pushed back"
"flat and quick on leg, a thick outside edge to the sweeper cover. Very tentative both sides"
"full and wide outside off, hammered away through to the sweeper cover. One more. SA need a wicket"
"good length on off, pushed away to the bowler's right"
"full and wide outside off, slapped through to deep extra cover. There is one more"
"a misfield from Duminy at backward point. good length outside off, sliced to him. He slips over in retrieval."
"oh my. That's tripe from Parnell. Short and wide from around the wicket. If you come in with that angle, you should not be giving so much width. Sliced in front of point. That's not a good ball."
"better but one ball too late. Good length on off, defended away."
"bang on straightaway. Good length on off, a loosener of sorts in terms of pace. Easily defended"
"goooone! Tahir is ecstatic. He's taken a lovely catch. A nice short delivery, aimed at the badge. Hafeez plays a pull and doesn't bother keeping it down. the room for error reduces drastically when you choose that option. Gets a thick leading edge to fine leg. Tahir runs in a few metres and takes a terrific, pressure low catch. Another start for Hafeez, consumed so many balls and then got out."
"back of a length down leg, good option. Wide called but good tactic"
"good length outside off, 132 kph, defended"
"a slower ball outside off, defended"
superb bouncer. Terrific length. Malik ducks underneath. Can't go off for bad light.
"excellent cricket. Magnificent. Back of a length on middle, played down towards midwicket for a quick, tight run. Good response from Babar. AB is quick on it and hits the stumps at the batsman's end. But the run is so well judged that no one could have effected that run-out, if AB couldn't/"
"back of a length outside off, tapped to point"
short and wide. That's rubbish from rabada this time. Malik cuts up and over point. Excellent execution
"nicely bowled. Full outside off, a thick outside edge past gully. Races away to Tahir's left at third man, who gets across, fields well and slips into the boundary. Signals four immediately."
"fullish outside off, defended"
"back of a length outside off, carved down to third man for one"
"full and wide, was there to be driven but has to stretch too much. Goes past. Another dot. Good over for Pakistan"
"back of a length on off, clipped to square leg"
"full outside off, hit on the up to cover. Just lands in front."
"that's great batting. Short and wide again, Malik gets underneath the bounce intentionally and cuts over point. No intention at any point to keep that down. Quality from the outset"
"back of a length on leg, clipped down to fine leg for one."
"that's his second bad ball of the spell. Back of a length, short and wide outside off. Babar cuts over point for four more. Maybe some fatigue creeping in"
"better response. Back of a length outside off, bunted into the off side"
"good length outside off, dabbed to third man for one. 143 kph."
"good length outside off, dabbed towards backward point who leaps on the ball to prevent one"
"fullish and wide outside off, hit to extra cover. But Rabada has overstepped. He did this in the series against England too, and should be learning from that. An awful offense"
"back of a length on off, shovelled to midwicket."
"nicely played. A legcutter outside off, driven languidly to mid-off."
"a bouncer on middle and leg, too high. Just the one for the over called"
"runs. Overpitched from Rabada, full and straight. Babar leans into his delectable on-drive and finds the gap to mid-on's left. Races away."
