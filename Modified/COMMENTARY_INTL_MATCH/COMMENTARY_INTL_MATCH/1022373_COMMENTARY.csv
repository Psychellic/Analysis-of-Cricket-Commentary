"length ball slanted across the left-hander into a wide-ish channel outside off, left alone"
"and again, angled into the fifth-stump channel, trying to invite the loose drive away from the body. Tamim doesn't oblige"
"length ball on off stump now, Tamim defends with a half-stride forward and across. Played slightly across his front pad there. Might be a little dangerous if Bhuvneshwar can swing it into him"
"finds a tiny bit of movement in to cramp Tamim on a middle-and-off line. Starts shorter than the previous ball, and he lets it come on and tucks it into the square leg region"
"fullish, fourth-stump channel, no swing, left alone"
"bowled him! Not the greatest shot from Sarkar there. Length ball, angling away wide of off stump, and his front foot goes nowhere as he reaches out to drive. Plays with an angled bat, and can only chop it onto his stumps"
"too straight, starts with one on Tamim's legs and he tucks it away fine, too fine for fine leg to run around and stop the boundary"
"length ball angling into middle and off, gets a stride forward and uses the angle to work it away through backward square leg"
"fullish, too much width, and even though it wasn't a half-volley, Sabbir puts it away easily, gets forward and drives with a full follow-through through point"
"ooh, this one nipped back quite a bit from outside off, exaggerating Bumrah's angle into the right-hander. Came forward to defend, and the ball zipped between bat and pad and over middle stump"
"back of a length, a bit of width again, slashed away to third man, off the outside half of the bat"
"good ball, hits the pitch hard just short of a good length, in the corridor, and gets it to straighten a touch with steep carry. Good leave from Tamim, just pulled his bat away from the line of the ball and let it pass"
"length ball on off stump, defended"
"length ball again, a touch wider outside off, defended to cover point"
down the track comes Sabbir and he gets some width from Bhuvneshwar. Just frees his arms and lofts that over extra-cover
"ooh, full, a bit of inswing towards off stump. Sabbir was looking to drive into the off side, gets a thick inside edge that runs away through backward square leg"
"there's that inswing again. This one starts from just back of a length, and Sabbir, looking to go on the back foot, can't connect with his hurried flick. Hits him on his thigh pad"
"shot, shot. A touch too full this time, outside off, and Sabbir opens his bat face and just eases it through cover point. His two previous fours were hit with extravagant follow-throughs. This one he just timed"
"good ball, again gets it to straighten in the corridor outside the left-hander's off stump. The length brings Tamim half-forward, and the movement beats the outside edge of his defensive bat"
"strays onto Tamim's legs, and he tucks it away to fine leg"
"back of a length, angling into middle and off, blocked back to the bowler"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended to Dhawan in that short cover point position"
"once again he charges out of his crease, and gets close to the pitch of the ball. Has to make himself a bit of room because of Bumrah's inward angle, and he lofts inside-out over mid-off. Doesn't really middle it, hits close to the toe end but he manages to clear mid-off comfortably"
"back of a length on off stump, defended into the covers"
"back of a length, pitching just outside leg. Straightens a touch into Tamim's body, and it hits his thigh pad as he misses the leg-side tuck"
"ooh, this one goes the other way and opens Tamim up. Fuller, starts from outside leg stump. Looks to close his bat face and work it through square leg, and the leading edge flies wide of second slip"

"back of a length, angling in towards off stump, goes back and across to defend back to the bowler"

"Sabbir steps out again and Bhuvneshwar bangs in another bouncer. Outside off, this time, and Sabbir can't connect with an off-balance pull"

"length ball angling into off and middle, clipped to midwicket"
"back of a length on middle stump, clipped to midwicket"
"ooh, again he gets it to straighten away from the left-hander. He's drawn into playing because of the angle Bumrah is creating from around the wicket, and the line, which is very close to off stump. Hits the deck and beats the edge with movement"
"length ball on off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"back of a length on off stump, defended to short extra-cover"

"slower length ball angling in towards off stump, defended into the cover point region"
"another bouncer, over middle and leg this time, ducks quickly to get under it"
"got him! Another slower ball, this one's shorter and much wider than the previous one. It took ages getting to Sabbir, begging him to go after it. He does, but in an effort to manufacture some power, fails to keep his cut down, and hits it straight to backward point"

"length ball close to off stump, punched crisply and Jadhav dives left at cover point to stop it"
"ooh, a small change of line, shifts it a bit wider and gets it to shape further away, late. Mushfiqur looks to punch away from his body, and he's lucky not to edge it"
"back of  a length on off stump, defended into the off side. Straightened a wee bit"
"shortish, angling into the body, tucked away to midwicket"
"length ball on middle stump, and Tamim gets that half stride forward and across and plays around his front pad to work it to long leg. Bhuvneshwar throws his hands up - he smells an lbw here"
"a strange time to play a shot like that. Back of a length, angling into off stump, and he makes himself a lot of room and tries to cut. Only manages an inside-edge that runs away past his leg stump"
"oh, lovely. This time he stays beautifully still to a length ball just outside off stump, and transfers his weight forward at the perfect moment to punch it to the left of mid-off"
"that's how you play the cut, Sabbir Rahman. To be fair, the shot was on this time, not a great ball. Mushfiqur holds his shape beautifully, rolls his wrists over on top of the bounce, and slaps it away to the right of backward point"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended into the covers"
"ooh, well bowled. Again hits the deck hard on that in-between length, but this one's pitching on off and middle. The angle makes Tamim look to work through midwicket, and then it straightens and he adjusts late to defend back to the bowler"
"shorter now, angling into the body, gets on his toes and looks to tuck it into the leg side, can only play it down a short distance though"
"slightly fuller, angling into middle stump, and he gets his front pad forward and across and works it to long leg"
"back of a length, a bit of nip back towards middle and off, punched towards mid-on"
"lovely delivery, straightens it slightly from a good length close to off stump. Defended into the cover point region"
"down the track, looking to make room to hit through or over the off side. Bhuvneshwar shortens his length and the ball beats his slash, just outside off stump"
"length ball with the tiniest bit of swing towards middle stump. Looks to work it leg-side, playing across his front pad again, and the angle and swing force him to hit it back to the bowler off the outside half of the bat"
"length ball on middle and leg, clipped to midwicket"
"ooh, slightly loose. A slip had come into place just before that ball, and Bhuvneshwar slanted it across the left-hander, pitching just short of a good length. Pushed at it away from his body, didn't really get back and across, and played it with an open face to third man"
"back of a length, angling into middle and off, defended back to the bowler"
"bouncer over middle and leg, Mushfiqur ducks"
"full, angling into off and middle and giving no room, punched back to the bowler"
"tossed up on off stump, defended to short extra-cover"
"full, a bit of drift, but this one drifts down the leg side as Tamim misses the flick"
"nice slow flight on off stump, drops just short of a driving length as Tamim stretches out, and he defends back to the bowler"
"a bit shorter, just outside off, waits deep in his crease to steer it wide of slip - replays suggest this was the seam-up arm ball"
"tossed up just outside off, presses forward to block it back to the bowler. No turn"
"similar delivery to the previous ball, a bit slower though. Gives Mushfiqur a bit more time to get further across and work it to midwicket"
"fullish on off stump, punched back firmly to the bowler"
"digs it in short now, just outside off. Comes onto Tamim quicker than he expects, and the ball hits the high part of the bat and loops up, but safely, into the wide mid-on region. Square leg was up for that ball, and he was looking to play it in that direction, but it just skidded on quicker than expected. He's overstepped, though. Wait, it's because there were only four fielders in the circle."
"Another short ball, on off stump now, and this time he makes room and lifts it up and over for a catch to Ashwin at deep point. They run back for a second"
"back of a length outside off, lets it come on and steers to third man"
"back of a length outside off, dabbed to third man"
"played on, but Hardik's bowled another no-ball! Shortish outside off, and Tamim goes for the pull again, only managing an inside-edge into his stumps. But he's overstepped by just a few millimeters."
"shortish and wide, too wide outside off for Tamim to attempt a stroke"
"low full-toss just outside off stump, and he clears his front leg to make a bit of hitting room and swings freely to drive to the left of mid-off, all along the ground"
"another short ball, gets up to an uncomfortable height close to his right shoulder. Manages to control his pull down to long leg"
"full, and again he drifts one down the leg side. Tamim can't connect with his flick"
sees him step out and bowls full and at his feet. Jabbed back to the bowler
"full and flighted on leg stump. Looks to play leg side, closes his bat face early, and gets a leading edge rolling back to the bowler"
"tossed up outside off, driven to long-off, a little on the up"
"goes back to one that's only marginally short of a good length outside off, chops it to backward point"
"length ball pitching on off and turning towards leg, gets down low to sweep to deep square leg"
"down the track and Ashwin floats it into middle and leg, looking to deny swinging room. Driven inside-out to long-off"
"fullish slower ball on off stump, gets forward and defends into the point region"
"sees Tamim stepping out and bangs in a bouncer. Tamim was looking to make room and hit over the off side, ended up too far from the ball to attempt to hit it"
"shortish, angling across to off stump, tucked away to the left of midwicket"
"ooh, play and miss. Not enough room to cut, and he was looking to adjust and play one of those controlled dabs, but the ball bounces over his top edge"
"back of a length, angling into middle stump, tucked away into the square leg region"
"bouncer, releases with a grunt and gets it to lift steeply over off stump. Too steeply in the umpires' opinion after Tamim backs away from his attempted hook"
"full on off stump, shuffles across and clips through square leg"
"full outside off, driven to long-off"
"quickish length ball on off stump, not much turn, goes on the back foot to punch to long-on"
"down the track and Ashwin slows it down, drifting it into Tamim's pads. Stretches out to defend, gets an inside-edge that rolls into the leg side"
"a bit flatter, fairly full just outside off stump. Gets across quickly, gets low over the ball and scoops it neatly to the keeper's left"
"flat, just a touch short, just a touch too much width. Waits nicely and uses the pace of the ball to dab it to the right of short third man"
"flighted now, much slower on off stump, swept to deep backward square leg"
"another attempted bouncer, gets up to shoulder height and he controls his pull well to play it down to deep backward square leg"
"length ball on middle stump, shuffles across to tuck it to the left of long leg"
"down the track, Pandya spears it into his legs to deny him room, but Tamim adjusts brilliantly to whip it away, up and over midwicket, and finish with his back leg gloriously upraised"

"bouncer over off stump, Mushfiqur ducks nice and low"
"back of a length close to off stump, dabbed to third man, and that will be drinks"
"flight on off, Mushfiqur get across and turns one down to fine leg. High percentage shot, playing with the spin"

"a tad short and wide, sliced behind point for a couple. Good area to hit the ball"

"flat on off, a little bit of turn, defended"
played away towards point. Keeping it tight and accurate
driven with the spin towards sweeper cover
"That's another fifty for Tamim. I'm not sure how good a shot that is, but it has returned four. Flat and straight, typical Jadeja. Tamim reverse laps, gets a bit of a top edge and it luckily, for him, lobs over third man"
"slow outside off, the ball turning in. Defended"
"pushed away towards midwicket, where the fielder is quick on it"
"flight on middle, Mushfiqur gets down and chips one towards midwicket"

"spoils a maiden with a tight run. Flat and wide, dabbed to third man for a run"
"intentionally lifted over third man. Another reverse sweep for four. That's flat and straight too, but Rahim calmly gets underneath the length and gets it over the fielder at short third man"
played quietly towards cover
"Mushfiqur looks for the slog sweep. Flat, quick and full, Mushfiqur misses his sweep, Dhoni whips off the bails in quick time  but Mushfiqur scraps his foot back just in time. Good awareness from Mushfiqur, can't be lackadaisical with Dhoni behind the stumps. <strong>Just a smidgen behind the line</strong>"

"slightly short and wide outside off, sliced to the sweeper cover fielder for a run"
"another quick dart on off, punched back. Pulled back that over nicely"
"quick outside off, rather full. Guided to third man"
"a long run, but Kohli's swiftness forces them out of it. Whipped to midwicket. Kohli sprints to his right"
"a low full toss outside off, pushed to long-off"
"lovely shot. It's flat but too wide, Tamim just laces a cut through point. There is no point, there is backward point. Sweeper cover is more towards a deep cover. And the ball scurries through"
"and this is to the other side of the sweeper cover. Flat down leg, Tamim runs down and lofts the ball elegantly over cover. Sublime batting."
"and those strokes force Ashwin to drift on the pads, Tamim says thanks with a nudge. Just a touch. Enough bat. Wide of fine leg for four. Pressure on India"
"Bhuvneshwar doesn't look good while stopping that, but as long as he does so, who cares? Flat down leg, whipped over midwicket for a couple."

"a run at least of every ball. Flat on middle, pushed to long-on. Excellent batting"

"short outside off, swatted away to midwicket"
"overpitched outside off, driven away towards cover"
"and Jadhav strikes. All those dots and Tamim is forced into a big shot. Straight and accurate from Jadhav, the length isn't full or short. But Tamim wants to hit through midwicket. He misses his slog sweep and the ball goes onto hit leg stump. Done in by pressure and Jadhav's length, not the right option, a cross-batted stroke to that ball"

"lovely fielding from Jadeja. Flat outside off, cut to point's right, Jadeja dives to save some runs"

"this is flat and quick on off, hit towards long-on"
"flat outside off, shovelled to midwicket. Another dot"
"and the pressure is released in the form of another wicket. Short and wide outside off, the ball turns in. Too close to cut, Shakib goes back and tries to hit the gap in front of point but Jadeja's flat trajectory and angle (the ball spinning in) means it's not a high percentage stroke. The ball skids on with the arm and takes a thick edge. Quite a big deflection. But Dhoni's gloves are again in the right place and he nonchalantly makes an awfully tough catch look ridiculously simple. Toe end of the bat"
"too much width, full and wide outside off, driven to the sweeper cover"
"tossed up outside off, straight. Driven back"
"another dot. Quick outside off, pushed towards cover."
"short and wide outside off, sliced to the sweeper cover. The fielder dives to his left"
"overpitched outside off, a yorker. Pushed back to cover"
"another one and Bangladesh are collapsing. So many dot balls, so much pressure. I'll release it all in one ball, says Mushfiqur to himself under his breath. So Mushfiqur thinks he can come down and swing. Jadhav tosses this up outside off, the ball dips late. Mushfiqur is too close to the ball, so decides to whip through midwicket, but it doesn't pitch. So he clips a full toss straight to midwicket, where Kohli won't drop them."
"flat outside off, worked to midwicket"
"that's a bad ball. Short down leg, clipped to midwicket. This is where pressure builds"
"flat on off, Mosaddek opens the face to push towards point. Dhoni is quick on it, to prevent one"

"ooh, extra bounce again, with a bit of nip away. Hits that hard length in the corridor and beats the outside edge as Mosaddek looks to run it down to third man"

"ooh, fumble from Dhoni. Saw Mahmudullah looking to step out and bowled it straighter, towards his pad. Turned sharper than the previous balls and beat his flick, but Dhoni, moving quickly to his left, couldn't hold on at the first attempt. Don't think it was a stumping chance anyway, because he had a lot of work to do to collect and then move right to knock the bails off. Mahmudullah wasn't far out of his crease either"

"six down. That's excellent bowling from Bumrah. Hit the deck hard again, but this time he angled it into the batsman's body. Mosaddek looked to pull, but he was cramped for room and could only offer a return catch looped back off the high part of the bat, near the sticker"

"full-toss on middle and leg, clipped to midwicket"

"low full-toss on middle and off, clipped to the left of long-on. Misfield by Yuvraj allows a second run, and they complete it easily despite a mix-up. Taskin didn't want the second. Mashrafe was always looking for it"
"back of a length outside off, dabbed down to third man"
"length ball slanted away from off stump. Taskin plays and misses, looking to drive on the up through the off side"
"and again. This one's a similar delivery in every respect except pace. This one's much, much slower, and he plays too early and the ball rolls down to Dhoni"
"three in a row. This is the normal pace delivery, and he pulls his length back slightly. Jabs at it, looking to push into the covers, and can't put bat to ball"
"he's really struggling here, Taskin, and that's also because Bhuvneshwar is giving him nothing. Bangs it in shorter this time, but along the same angle as the previous ball, and he aims a big pull at it and misses"
"action replay of the previous ball. Short ball slanting away from off stump, Taskin pulls and misses"
"and now an edge, and a valuable edge at that. Low full-toss outside off stump. Taskin clears his front leg, slogs, and nicks it to the left of Dhoni"
and another edged boundary brings up Bangladesh's 250. Bumrah follows Mashrafe's movement away from leg stump with another rising short ball. He swings mightily at it and the ball flies to the left of the keeper off the top-edge
"shot. This one's not quite as short, and it only gets up to waist height. Clears his front leg, makes just enough room to flat-bat between mid-off and extra-cover"
"now the yorker. Backs away, tries to jam down on it, and the ball misses inside edge and leg stump"
"another yorker, on off stump this time. Was backing away initially, and then reaches out to try and squeeze it through point. Only manages an inside-edge that rolls to the left of Dhoni"
"backs away again, gets a thigh-high full-toss that he swats away to long-on"
"another edge, this one only costs one run. Now Taskin clears his front leg and looks for the big swat over the leg side. He's cramped for room, though, and the ball rolls off the edge to third man"
"short ball at Taskin's body, pulled to deep midwicket"
"yorker on middle stump. Looks to clear his front leg and slog, gets no leverage and the ball rolls away a short distance into the leg side off the inside edge"
"now, having followed Mashrafe whenever he's given himself room, he elects to bowl a slower ball, back of a length, wide of off stump. Tight call, Mashrafe leaves and the umpire signals wide"
"in the blockhole just outside off, jabbed down to long-off. The ball didn't travel too quickly, and the batsmen scurry two"
"makes room to try and flat-bat down the ground, only manages an inside-edge off this back-of-a-length delivery. Jams it down into the pitch, right by his feet, and picks it up and flicks it back to the bowler"
"off-stump yorker, and that's nicely played by Mashrafe. Opens his bat face and stabs it off the middle of the bat... but straight to Ashwin at backward point"
"length ball on off stump, makes a bit of room and flat-bats to long-off"
"an untidy start, a length ball on leg, clipped through square leg for a couple. Nice timing"
"beautiful. Length delivery outside off, lifts and kicks and beats the bat of Rohit outside off"
"good length delivery outside off, not much movement. Defended back"
"nice comeback. Keeps it on a length outside off, Rohit plays it towards cover with as straight a bat as possible"
"133 kph, back of a length outside off. Rohit stays back and punches to extra cover."
"good end. 131 kph outside off, accurate. Blocked away"
"back of a length outside off, a 130 kph offcutter. Played back"
"lovely shot. Good length outside off, Dhawan stays back in the crease but still manages to find a gap in front of cover for four. His weight was on the back foot, yet got enough power."
"cannot bowl there to Dhawan. 132 kph outside off, sits up for Dhawan to hammer through point with a terrific cut shot. In the air, but he knew where he wanted to hit that"
"good length, on a fourth-stump channel. Better comeback. Defended towards cover"
"back of a length on leg, easy pickings. A simple nudge through square leg for one."
"good end. 135 kph, fuller than a good length outside off, Rohit is hesitant but plays the ball towards cover"
"full outside off, 132 kph, brings Dhawan forward, crisply driven to mid-off"
nicely played. Transfers his weight onto the front foot and then leans into a drive to find a gap through point. A deep point fielder cleans up.
"good length outside off, 130 kph. Rohit stays back and works the ball to mid-on"
"on a length on off, worked through square leg for one. Just too simple. This is exactly what India want in the first few overs"
"an offcutter on leg, defended back. Nothing troublesome here early"
"fullish length, straight and accurate, played back towards the bowler. Decent over, but a tad too defensive?"
"too much width. Pitches it up, wide and full outside off. Rohit leans forward and caresses a square drive into the surface. Wide of point and races away"
"135 kph, good length outside off, cramping Rohit for room, defended towards point"
"tight around off, defended back"
"133 kph, full and wide outside off, too much width and the length is hittable too. Rohit sinks his back foot, perhaps waiting for a shorter length, but then improvises nicely to drill a square drive. Sensational timing."
"on a length, around off, better comeback but played away towards square leg"
"the best of 'em all. Allll timing, all class. Full and straight, Rohit offers the full face, high elbow, head over the ball and just lets ball meet bat. No over-hitting, no lofting. Crisp through mid-on"
"an offcutter on the pads, worked to square leg, 118 kph. This is just far too easy"
"good length outside off, 128 kph, no movement, no pace. Rohit punches to cover."
"nice lines, but punched away without much fuss to mid-off. With that length, Rohit can hang back and play with time to spare"
"oh yes. That's incredible. Another offcutter, but this is outside off, spinning back in slightly. Rohit brings his bat down at a different angle and flicks the ball through midwicket. No one there. Wrist power"
"good length around off, 126 kph. Pushed to mid-off from the crease"
"a touch of width. Fullish outside off, moves away slightly. Rohit opens up his bat face and guides one to third man"
"edged but lands well short of slip. Short and wide, the ball seaming back in. Rohit gets an under edge towards the slip fielder, who does well to stop runs"
"overpitched, a yorker on off is jammed away towards mid-on"
"too full, outside off, a half-volley. Driven to short cover."
nicely played. Not short enough but there is enough width. Rohit closes up any gap between bat and pad and guides this down to third man
"good length outside off, not much movement. Pushed away into the off side"
"too short. Sits up for Dhawan. Tries the bouncer, tries something different off the last ball. On middle and leg, not enough pace. Dhawan is able to pull through backward square leg. All along the ground."
"good length delivery outside off, a hint of away shape. Pushed to extra cover from the back foot"
"fullish and wide outside off, some seam movement back in. Shovelled towards midwicket"
"good length delivery outside off, more movement back in. Defended, with bat and pad close together"
"full outside off, played back towards the bowler"
"picks the length so early. No entirely short. Good length. But it's the lack of pace that helps this shot. Good length on middle, sits up for Rohit to swat over midwicket. Just too easy"
"good end. Fullish around off, comes back in, but not much trouble for Rohit in his defense"
"short delivery on leg, pulled down to fine leg for a single"
"full and straight, 142 kph. Rohit gets to the ball slightly late and gets a thick inside edge to fine leg"
"oh yeah. Awesome. Good length outside off, not short or wide enough to cut. So Dhawan chooses a different option, a punchy stab into the surface towards point. It hits the pitch adjacent and bounces over point. Exemplary timing"
"good length around off, played back towards the bowler"
"four more. And Dhawan re-takes the top spot in the run-making charts of this tournament. Taskin drops short, on middle and leg. Dhawan pulls, places this intentionally behind square by getting there slightly early. Wow"
"132 kph, humongous. Another one that he drops short outside off, it isn't troubling Dhawan. He is so quick on that length that his bat speed through the ball is so quick that the ball flies over square leg. Amazing stroke-making"
"fullish and straight, worked to midwicket"
"fullish outside off, seam movement back in. Played into the off side"
"fullish and straight, perhaps another offcutter, worked to midwicket."
"finds the gap again. More runs. Fullish outside off, punched, more skewed through point for a couple more"
"too straight from Mashrafe, worked into the gap at midwicket for one"
"an offcutter on the pads, 114 kph, nudged to short fine leg"
"137 kph, another delectable stroke but this finds point. Doesn't make the shot any less elegant. Fullish outside off, just a carved punch hurries to backward point"
"good length on off, shovelled towards midwicket."
"lovely timing. Back of a length outside off, Rohit gets on his toes and plays a late cut past backward point for a couple to third man"
"on the pads, 139 kph, worked to midwicket"
ooh. Short and very wide outside off. Rohit leans on a cut and finds backward point. Good stop by Mosaddek
"136 kph, good end. Tight around off, played away. Trickles back wide of the off stump. Rohit sends Dhawan back"
"another short ball with not enough pace, on leg. Pulled down to fine leg. Can't bowl there too often"
"Rohit sends Dhawan back again. Fullish around off, dabbed towards point. Dhawan comes hurtling down before being sent back by Rohit. The throw isn't accurate, so all's well"
a late cut off the 123 kph length delivery to third man earns Rohit one more
"a bouncer, slower delivery, offcutter. Helped along to fine leg. This is hardly troublesome bowling"
"slower delivery on off, 112 kph. Rohit strides forward to defend"
"another cutter on off, whipped through square leg"
"too short, too wide, too simple. Carved to third man"
too straight again. And pays the price. Dhawan just gets some bat. Doesn't need more. And the ball flies away to the short fine leg boundary
"full delivery outside off, pushed to cover"
"a slower delivery on leg, worked away through square leg for a single"
"too straight from Rubel, nudged to fine leg for another run"
"139 kph, short outside off, punched to point. Decent over from Rubel, but what they need is an over that has four wickets"
"another offcutter outside off, defended into the off side"
"fuller than a good length outside off, hit towards cover"
too much width with that length. Rohit can stay back and hit a punchy stab to the sweeper cover
"an offcutter outside off, pushed into the off side. A misfield at cover makes them think of a run, but they decide against it"
"that's a bouncer on leg, doesn't hurry the batsman who pulls towards fine leg with no trouble at all"
"another bouncer, outside off. Pulled to deep square leg"
"flat on middle and off, punched to long-on from the back foot"
an overpitched delivery on off and middle is worked to the fielder at deep midwicket. How easy is this
nurdled down to fine leg
"lots of flight outside off, driven elegantly through cover for a couple. Long-off cleans up"
"driven to the left of cover, who dives but a parry allows one"
"overpitched on middle and leg, pushed down to long-on"
"another offcutter from Mashrafe, fullish and straight, hit back to the bowler"
"another slower delivery on off, nice lines. Pushed to mid-on."
"not good bowling. He has been getting away with that length, but not this time. Another bouncer with no pace. Dhawan gets inside the line of that and pulls behind square. All along the ground"
"somehow Dhawan chips his wicket away! It's yet another offcutter outside off, Dhawan shimmies down and looks to hit over mid-off but the ball skews off the outside half and goes towards point's left. That cut, off the ball, may have been the reason for the ball going to point, as opposed to mid-off."
"back of a length outside off, gets nicely behind it to defend into the covers"
"short outside off, not too much width, gets nicely on top of it and stabs it crisply but backward point dives left to cut it off"
"floated up outside off and Rohit drives square. Poor fielding at backward point by Mashrafe, a little slow diving left, and the ball races away for four fairly preventable runs"
"some flight again, outside off, and this time Rohit drives to the cover boundary. Too full from Shakib here"
"tossed up on middle stump, clips it down to long-on to bring up fifty. What a tournament he's having"
"back of a length, slides in with the angle to deny Kohli room goes deep in his crease to punch to long-on"
"length ball on the pads, clipped into the square leg region"
"tossed up on middle and off, driven to long-off"
"length ball close to off stump, gets across and defends to mid-on"
"length ball, fairly wide of off, gets a good stride out to punch towards deep point and bring up India's 100"
"back of a length close to off stump, lets it come on and meets it with a straight bat, at the last possible moment, to dab into the gully region"
"short on off stump, pulled to long leg"
"back of a length, angling into middle stump, gets on his toes to defend towards midwicket"
"ooh, good ball, a yorker on middle and leg. Rohit stays nice and still and has all the time in the world to pull his front foot away from the line and clip to midwicket"
"full on off stump, driven to mid-off"
"length ball slanting across to off stump, stretches out and plays a nice checked push to deep point"
"ooh, dangerous. Slower ball, fairly full outside off. Rohit is early into the drive, checks himself, and spoons it in the air but to the left of extra-cover. Bottom hand comes off the handle as he plays the shot"
"length ball on off stump, defended into the covers"
"length ball on the pads, tucked away to long leg"
"yorker on off and middle, and Kohli looks to flick it against the angle. Ends up squeezing it back towards the bowler"
"short, a bit of width, Rohit leans back and slaps it away to the right of third man"
"back of a length, just outside off. Shuffles across and punches to midwicket"
"length ball, a touch wider, gets Kohli to stretch out and defend towards point"
"bouncer outside off, and I think that rises steeper than Kohli expects. He wants to pull, but improvises a tennis smash from over his right shoulder and places it wide of mid-on"
"short again, this only gets up to waist height as Rohit stands tall and pulls to the right of deep square leg. The fielder didn't have too far to move, but the ball just went too quickly"
"another boundary, this one not as authoritative. Short again, this time outside off. Extra bounce as Rohit looks to punch into the point region, and he gets a thick edge that flies to the fine third man boundary"
"back of a length on leg stump, worked to long leg"
"full slower ball on middle stump, defended to mid-off"
"full outside off, driven to the right of backward point, who moves quickly to stop it. He timed that really well"
"length ball slanting into the fourth-stump channel. Presses forward to defend, and it nips away slightly, takes the outside edge, and rolls down to third man"
"full on off stump, overpitched, Kohli shows the full face to punch it back down the ground, between the stumps and the non-striker"
"bouncer, well directed, rises over Kohli's left shoulder. Watches it well and hunches slightly to let it pass over him"
"full outside off, opens his bat face to stab it down to third man"
"back of a length on off stump, hops back and across to clip to deep square leg"
"fullish on off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"back of a length outside off, dabbed to third man"
"back of a length outside off, punched to deep point"
"looking for that yorker, doesn't quite get it as full as he'd hope but it's still a threatening enough ball, full and slanting into off stump, to induce a full-face defensive push to mid-on"
"full, angling across towards off stump, and how well timed is that? Just leans over it and clips it gently, and it just keeps rolling away to the midwicket boundary without seeming to lose any steam. Deep square leg had no chance"
"and now sweeper cover has no chance. Overpitched again, outside off, and Kohli gets his head right over the ball to drive, left elbow high, to the right of the boundary fielder"
"back of a length on off stump, walks across and tucks it into the square leg region"
"back of a length outside off, nips away a touch off the pitch without any great pace. Rohit dabs to backward point"
"fuller now, angling into off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"full on off stump, just shows it the full face and eases it to the right of sweeper cover"
"fullish, wide of off. This isn't a half-volley, but on days like this Kohli will just take a big stride out and drive on the up like it's the easiest thing in the world. Again, sweeper cover has no chance"
"back of a length on off stump, goes back and across and punches with a straight bat, wide of mid-on"
"short, just outside off, pulled to the left of deep square leg"
"short, just outside off, takes a couple of steps across and clips it on top of its bounce, down towards long-on"
"shot! back of a length, and that isn't too far from hitting the top of off stump - it's maybe a couple of inches outside off. Rohit waits, leans back, and opens his bat face and just the perfect moment to place it to the left of backward point"
"short, wide, and this time he stands up and flashes a square-cut that beats backward point to his right. This isn't great bowling, and these two are making it look too easy"
"a bit of width and a touch short, goes back and slaps to the left of sweeper cover"
"tossed up outside off, driven firmly and extra-cover dives left, gets a hand to it, but lets it roll away a few feet to allow the single"
"full now, on middle stump, whipped down to long-on"
"nice length outside off, some away drift and no turn back in, defended to short extra-cover"
a touch short now and Rohit waits on the back foot to punch to the left of mid-off
"length ball, turning in towards off stump, clipped away through forward square leg"
"back of a length outside off, in that channel that Kohli isn't too fond of. Shuffles a long way across and looks to push into the covers. Thick inside edge, rolls a few inches wide of off stump"
"shortish outside off, punched to deep point"
"shortish, just outside off, gets back and across and uses his wrists to work that into the midwicket region"
"good length ball, fifth-stump line, Kohli stretches out and shoulders arms"
"short outside off, doesn't quite come on to Kohli, who's shaping to pull. Waits and drags it along the ground towards deep square leg"
"ooh, a little loose. Back of a length, slightly wide of off, a bit of extra bounce maybe. Rohit flirts at it away from his body, looking to steer it through point perhaps, and the ball zips past his outside edge"
"back of a length on middle stump, whipped to deep midwicket"
"length ball on off stump, uses his wrists to work it to the right of square leg"
"floated up on off stump, and Kohli uses the hang-time of the ball to get a long stride out, while staying perfectly balanced, and drive with a perfectly straight bat between mid-off and extra-cover"
"back of a length, turning into off and middle, clipped to midwicket"
"tossed up slow outside off, stretches out and whips to long-on"
"back of a length on middle and leg, clipped to the right of deep midwicket"
"back of a length outside off, defended into the point region"
"back of a length, a little closer to off stump, defended into the covers"
"length ball, fourth-stump line, defended to short extra-cover. I think it may have straightened a touch off the pitch"
"fullish, on off stump, clipped to midwicket"
"streaky. Short outside off, and Rohit was on the front foot for some reason. Slashed at it, and got a thick edge down to third man"
"full-toss outside off, about knee-high, punched to mid-on"
"back of a length on off stump, punched to sweeper cover"
"floated up slow on off stump, driven quietly down to long-off"
"flighted again, wider and fuller. Too full for Rohit to time his flat-bat drive, drags it along the ground to extra-cover"
"oh my. Another loose moment from Rohit. Stepped out, Shakib shortened his length and bowled it slower. Looked to work it to long-on, sent a leading edge ballooning up over extra-cover, who turned and ran back but couldn't catch up with the ball"
"edged, and is that really a chance? I wouldn't think so. Perhaps no tshort enough for the late dab, and the thick edge hits Mushfiqur on the knee"
"back of a length, punched down to long-on"
"back of a length, fifth-stump line, punched to the left of deep point"
"ooh, length ball pitching on a fourth-stump line and nipping back in. Rohit defends without really getting a stride out. Inside-edge bounces down near his feet and trickles into the leg side"
"length ball on off stump, shuffles across and clips into the midwicket region"
"short, a bit of width, leans back to slap it straight to backward point"
"full outside off, steps forward and flicks to deep midwicket"
"short outside off, gets up to shoulder height, and that's such quick feet from Kohli to get across and swivel on his back foot to pull to the right of mid-on, with a turn of the wrists at the top of the bounce. A superb way to bring up the smoothest of fifties"
"short outside off, slapped to the left of deep point"
"back of a length on off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"full on off stump, driven to long-off"
"back of a length on middle and leg, goes back to punch to long-on"
"stays back to a length ball on middle and off, looks for the punch to long-on. Midwicket moves quickly to deny him"
"full on middle and off, driven firmly, inside-out, to extra-cover"
"starts with a rubbish, flat long-hop angling into middle and leg. Rohit pulls it to the square leg boundary"
"floaty and very full outside off, stabbed to backward point"
"flight and dip just outside off, defended back to the bowler"
"another short ball, this one isn't quite as short and Rohit has to crouch a little to pull it along the ground to deep backward square leg"

"back of a length now, worked away to deep square leg"

"wide yorker, jabbed into the cover region off the inside half of the bat"

"a big step down the pitch, and he calmly drives this pitched-up ball to long-off"

"back of a length on middle and off, goes back and works it to the right of midwicket"
"fullish on off stump, and I was about to begin typing thinking this was just a push to mid-off. But that jab is timed so well that mid-off has no chance to stop it to his right. Doesn't move at all"
"back of a length on off stump, hops back and across to clip it through square leg"
"bouncer, rising steeply over middle stump. Looks to hook but it's too quick for him and it's through to the keeper in  hurry"
"slower length ball slanting across to off stump, defended into the covers"
"shortish, at the body. I think it's the cutter, nipping away off the pitch. Rohit wants to tuck it off his hips through square leg, ends up playing it towards the bowler off the leading edge. Played with soft hands, though, so no chance of carrying"
"another short ball, and that brings up his 11th ODI hundred. Hooks it away, and it's in the air - it comes off the outer half of the top of his bat, and Mosaddek, running to his right from long leg and diving, can't quite reach the ball. It's hit the boundary cushions on the full"
"overpitched on off, driven into the surface towards cover"
"fantastic timing, sensational placement. Very full outside off, drilled to the right of cover. No chance for long-off"
"flat down leg, skids on and beats Kohli on the inside edge"
stabbed towards the sweeper cover
"plenty of flight on off, Rohit strides forward to defend"
"and he drops short outside off, Rohit goes back and carves a cut to the sweeper cover."
"half-volley outside off, Rohit looks to hit the ball through cover but the ball skews away off the inside half to mid-on"
"a slower length delivery outside off. Speed says 132 kph, worked to midwicket."
"four more. Too full outside off, Rohit offers the full face and gets four. The mid-off is wide, like how de Villiers place himself. That allows batsmen to hit straight, to the right of the fielder"
"another terrific shot. Overpitched outside off, drilled to the sweeper cover"
"<strong>that's his first run there.</strong> Against Sri Lanka, he got out tried to play that stroke. He's shown great discipline to avoid that shot. Now, he brings out the late cut for a run to third man"
"full and straight, a solid block"
"tossed up on off, driven to long-off"
another languid drive to the sweeper cover.
"a tad wider outside off, Kohli finds cover"
"this time, Kohli goes back and hits to long-on. Just a minor advantage, adjusting your body and the direction in which your bat comes down"
pushed to long-on again. Slightly short
"flat and wide, skewed. Opened the bat face late to get one to the sweeper cover"
"short and wide outside off, Kohli gets underneath the length and slices a cut over point. Very intentional, very classy. Tripe from Taskin"
"improves his line, straighter, close to off, nudged to midwicket"
"now, he's bringing out plenty of late cuts. Shortish and wide, dabbed to third man"
"a no-look pull for four. A well-directed bouncer on middle, Rohit pulls and plays this behind square. Not quite in complete control, but he met the ball at the perfect time - to get it behind square"
"a shortish delivery on middle, pulled away to deep square leg"
"fullish outside off, Kohli <b>mis-times one</b>. Back up the pitch via the pad"
short and very wide and very very slow. Cut but finds point
"quicker, straighter and fuller. Rohit cuts and finds the gap in front of point for a run"
"tossed up with a round-arm action on leg, defended"
"drifts on the pads and Kohli says thanks. Just a bit of bat is all he needed, to fine leg, another boundary"
"overpitched on leg, driven to long-off for a single."
"enough of prodding and plodding. Flat and wide outside off, Rohit brings out an IPL drive, lofting the ball powerfully over cover for another boundary."
"drops short filth. On middle and leg, a donkey drop. And Kohli pulls through midwicket for four. Absolute tripe"
"flat and wide, left alone this time"
punched to long-off for a run. <strong>Kohli is the quickest ODI batsman to 8000 runs</strong>
"on middle and leg, nudged to square leg. Well done by Rohit"
"quick on off, Kohli goes back and pushes to long-on"
"oh yes. Flat on off, pushed back to the bowler. Well played Rohit"
"flat and wide outside off, guided to third man"
"quick on middle, pushed to long-off"
punched away off the back foot to the sweeper cover. One more.
"on the pads, nudged away to deep square leg. Easy as ..."
"87 kph, on the pads, pushed away to long-on."
"Kohli goes deep in the crease and meets the straight ball with an angled bat, gets one to square leg"
"and that will be it. Kohli finishes on 96. A very wide overpitched delivery that is crisply driven, one of many today, through cover for four. A punch of the air, more delight than annoyance. And India set up another blockbuster on Sunday with <b>Pakistan to determine the winners of the 2017 Champions Trophy</b>"
