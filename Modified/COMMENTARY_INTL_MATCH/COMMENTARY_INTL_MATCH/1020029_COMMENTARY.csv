"on a length to start on middle, some typical inswing, worked away to square leg with the angle of swing"
"a big appeal. No. Four leg byes. Full and swinging into Amla, swings in too much. Strays down as Amla misses a flick. Takes his pad and races away to the 12-metre fine leg fence"
"nice adjustment. On a length outside off, holds its line this time because it is delivered with a cross seam. Defended"
"ah, very 2015 World Cup semi-final like. Boult bowling it full, threatening Amla's inside edge. Hit into the pad"
too straight goes Boult and Amla flicks away through square leg. Comparatively massive boundary on that side. We may not be seeing too much more of a full length
"holds it's line again. Fantastic over from Boult. Full and straight, de Kock falls over as he misses a flick. Rapped on the pads, sliding down"
"phew. Amla walks right across and misses a flick. The ball is full and quick, just missing leg stump."
"that's tripe to Amla. Full on the pads, a hit-me delivery. Amla whips his flick through backward square leg"
tries over compensating and dishes out something short and wide. Amla gets under the length and cuts over point for four. Not good from Wheeler
"good run. Good delivery. Tight around off, Amla drops it by his his feet, towards cover, and calls for a run. De Kock responds well, the run is easily completed. That's a manufactured run, crucial in T20 batting."
"cramping him for room. Length on middle and leg, de Kock shovels a flick to square leg. Got to watch that line, he's very strong off his hips"
"short and wide outside off, de Kock backs away, looking to hit the ball straight. Some extra bounce takes the ball over the bat"
"beauty. Full length outside off, a fifth-stump line. Amla allows himself an atypical waft away from his body. Beaten"
"walks down, shimmies forward, gets a full delivery and driven away to point"
"wow, superb fielding from Wheeler. Back of a length outside off, Amla opens the face and dabs the ball in front of slip. Goes though him. But Wheeler at third man puts in a dive to save three"
"straight to the fielder at deep square leg! There was one fielder patrolling the whole leg side boundary and de Kock picks him out. A fuller than a good length delivery on middle, de Kock picks the length early, goes back and pulls. Gets plenty on it but that's the long boundary. Straight to the fielder. Six on the Highveld. Out in New Zealand."
"full and straight, driven away to mid-off. Impressive bowling from Boult, not going too short too early on these short straight boundaries."
"on a length outside off, left alone"
yikes. Starts with a short nothing delivery way down leg. A loosener
"good comeback. On a length on middle and leg, worked through midwicket. Nice length too."
"<strong>superb</strong>. Gets swing. Good length delivery outside off, the ball swings away late. Faf is lulled into playing but the ball moves away and beats the bat"
"up and over! Safe option from Faf. Full delivery outside off, swinging away. Faf gets underneath the length and lofts the ball over cover. Safe because he hit that in the direction of swing."
"full and wide, Southee goes wide of the crease. Pitches it full and shapes away, beats Faf's loose leaden-footed drive"
"excellent bowling this. Tight line around fourth stump, some away movement too. Blocked"
"there you go. That won't be six on many other grounds but it is here. Full and straight on off, Faf gets low and scoops the ball over fine leg. The short fine leg fielder is chasing after it but the ball clears the boundary. That's amazing. <b>51-metre six</b>"
"a genuine edge, but in the gap. Full outside off, sees the length and goes all in. Amla gets a thick outside edge which flies between slip and the keeper. Almost six that."
"short and wide, pulls the length back because of those short boundaries. And pulling your length back is fine, but your line has to be good too. It isn't here. Width. Amla cuts through point"
"four more. Over-compensates with a short length delivery on the pads. Amla relies on timing and placement, whips through backward square leg"
"four in four. That's the best delivery of the over but such is the game. Full outside off, not too full. Amla is sucked into an early drive, hits it uppishly and just wide of the backward point fielder, diving to his left."
"nice. Length on middle, worked to midwicket"
"goes too straight again does Wheeler, Amla flicks his wrists and helps himself to a run through square leg. Not over-hitting, not even hitting, just timing"
"well played. Good length delivery outside off, Amla gets on top of the bounce and dabs to third man. On the bounce. These balls are flying around"
"slower delivery outside off, bludgeoned. Faf picked it early, waited for the ball to come to him and then slapped the ball through cover. Nice shot selection. Good start for Faf too"
"blooper moment. Full outside off, carved to point where Phillips, the debutant, gathers the ball and mis-throws to third man instead"
"shot of the day. Full on the pads from Southee, Amla just lets the ball come onto the pad and then chips the ball over midwicket with superlative timing."
"four more. Southee goes short on middle, Amla pulls through square leg this time. Easy execution."
"a good comeback from Southee. Back of a length on middle, Amla gets on top of the bounce to defend. A Test-match stroke. Where is the cross-bat hoick?"
"flight outside off, a hint of turn, drilled to the sweeper cover"
"on the pads and short, Amla misses out on a run by missing a whip. Hit on the thigh pad"
"nicely bowled. Slowed up outside off, extracts some purchase, worked to midwicket"
"fired in outside off, cut to deep point from the crease. Just the single."
"flat again and straight, worked to midwicket. Santner's length has been really good this over"
"Faf comes down but Santner draws the length back and slows it down, Faf improvises a whip to long-on. Superb over"
"on the pads to start, worked though backward square leg for a couple. Nicely played, good running."
"full and straight, Faf is squared up as he looks to nudge into the leg side. A run to mid-off off the leading edge"
whips the ball from well outside off to square leg. Superb wrists of Amla to the fore
"the wide bouncer. De Grandhomme dug this in so short. Faf backs away and watches it go over a leaping Ronchi, who is upto the stumps. Third man gets around"
"oh what timing. Back of a length outside off, Amla stays tall and punches a cut behind point for two, Almost to the boundary"
scythed away to the sweeper cover
"wants to go straight. On a length and straight, Faf backs away and hits the ball on the up towards Williamson at mid-off who nimbly gets across to his right"
"'hit, hit, hit' screams Ronchi. Phillips can't release well again. Flat and straight, tapped straight to point. The fielder is quick on it but one-bounces the throw to the keeper"
"yikes. A rank long-hop on middle. Amla waits, waits, waits and then pulls to deep midwicket"
"oh wow. Mis-timed so badly but it clears long-on anyway. Faf runs down to the pitch, doesn't get there but with these boundaries, he goes through with the stroke. Mis-times his loft, hands in the air but clears long-on's leaping hands"
pushed to long-on. Mis-timed again
"flat and quick on middle and off, chopped to point"
"there it is. If the mis-timed sixes are going for sixes, what about the ones that are decently timed? Faf backs away, gets a full length delivery and lofts the ball over long-on with nonchalant ease. Off the toe end, but it clears the fielder easily"
"tries to avoid bowling full, bowls short and wide. Amla cuts through backward point and <b>gets to his fifty.</b> He's got there rather quickly"
"fuller length on off, mis-timed drive finds cover"
"six more. My word. Full delivery on off, pace off the ball. Amla backs away and lofts the ball over long-off. That's a long way back. Sensational"
drilled past the bowler for a run. Long-off cleans up
"nice. Yorker on leg, Faf jams the ball out"
"good bowling. Swerves back in, full on the pads. Faf misses a wipe across the line and is struck on the pad."
"full outside off, Amla wants to loft over long-off but mis-times his loft so badly that it goes towards long-on. Skewed off the inside half"
"attempts a scoop. That's quite a calculated risk. If he connects, there's a good chance that it goes for six. Gets right across but just misses this one"
"<strong>dropped! Santner drops a sitter</strong>. Back of a length on leg, Boult followed Faf. A cross-batted slap goes straight up, Santner settles underneath it at backward point but the ball just bounces out of his hands. Was probably Ronchi's catch"
"on a length on off, dabbed to third man"
"back of a length on off, a mis-timed swat to long-on. Excellent length for this ground, very hard to hit"
"again, good option from Amla, but just failed execution. Back of a length outside off, Amla wants to ramp the ball over the keeper but makes no contact. Another terrific over from Boult"
"oh no. That's plumb. That's probably the worst ball he'll bowl to get a wicket. A high full toss on middle and leg, Faf gets down to scoop over fine leg. Misses the ball and is rapped right in front. Easy call. Not a bad idea again, execution isn't great. Fine margins."
"ooh, out with a direct hit? Full and straight, pushes to mid-off for a quick run. AB hurtles through and would have been safe even if Williamson hit"
driven to long-on for a run.
"full and straight, driven to long-on. He'll prefer playing with a straight bat early in his innings"
"shortish on off, pulled away to deep midwicket"
"126 kph, short and wide, slapped to the sweeper cover."
"flat delivery on the pad, AB misses a flick. Struck on the pad"
worked away to square leg. Nice length again
"<b>a missed stumping!</b> Flat and quick, drifts on with the arm. Amla shimmies down and misses a mow across the line. Ronchi is unsighted and misses the ball. Four byes."
"flat and wide, Amla miscues a lofted drive over cover"
gets low and sweeps the ball over fine leg for four. Anticipated that length because of how difficult it is to control a full length. Clever batting
"fires in a low full toss on leg, worked away to deep midwicket"
""
AB gets a full length and lofts the ball over cover for four. Got underneath that sufficiently
"on a length on off, worked to square leg"
"taken this time. Back of a length delivery on leg, follows Amla as he backs away. Amla is cramped for room, harried for pace and all he can do is mis-time a pull to deep square leg. The fielder comes in, settles underneath and takes a comfortable catch. Great start to the tour for Amla. Well bowled from Wheeler"
"strays in line, the length is nice but too straight. Tickled away fine, past Ronchi's dive. Four."
""
"well played. Flat and wide outside off, Duminy waits before dabbing the ball fine towards third man"
lovely batting. A discernible improvement in the way he's been batting of late has been his decisiveness in feet movement. Gets right to the pitch of the ball and lofts the ball over long-on. Eased into the stroke because of that advance
"slowed up through the air, on leg, worked to square leg"
"flat and quick on off, pushed away to long-off"
"a low full toss on leg, clipped to deep square leg"
"superb bowling. Plenty of flight and drift but wide of off. AB reaches out for the ball, drills through cover for a run"
"a bouncer on off, AB picks the variation and slaps his pull to midwicket. Nice timing but didn't find the gap"
"huuuge! AB backs away, de Grandhomme dishes out something full. Whacked way over midwicket. Sweet timing"
"mis-timed and gone! Massive wicket this. AB backs away again, de Grandhomme goes full on off. AB ends up stretching out for the ball because of that initial movement. Even with mid-off up, AB can't clear him. Toe-ended to mid-off. Another bad delivery that gets a wicket. He actually took pace off that, so credit to the bowler."
dabbed away to third man off the open face
"full outside off, Behardien misses a drive"
"good length outside off, slapped to cover"
"good length outside off, Duminy tries a dab through third man. But misses. Looking for that short boundary but behind the keeper"
worked away through midwicket. Cramping Duminy for room. Lovely delivery
"full and straight, badly timed to mid-off"
"nicely played. Short and wide from Southee, Duminy ensures he got underneath that and lifted the ball over point for four."
"four more. Short on middle and leg, Duminy gets across and just paddles the pull down to the short fine leg boundary. Made that stroke easier by getting forward and opening up the shot"
"short on middle and leg, pulled away to deep square leg on the bounce"
"superb stuff from Wheeler. An inch-perfect yorker on off, jammed away towards short midwicket. Duminy wants one, Behardien doesn't. Wheeler picks up, and throws the stumps down even as he falls over while releasing. Duminy is <b>just fine returning</b> to the crease"
"all fine margins here. Wheeler tries the yorker again but misses by just enough for Duminy to get underneath that. Once he does, he lofts the ball easily over long-on"
"dropped? Duminy backs away, Wheeler follows him. Flicked away with great timing to de Grandhomme at deep midwicket, who runs in and collects the ball cleanly but the ball landed just short. Excellent fielding"
"a bouncer on middle and leg, Behardien misses a pull."
"short on middle, that's not a bad delivery actually. But the thing is it's predictable. Behardien is hunting on the back foot, whacked away way over midwicket. Good batting this, thinking and making life easy for himself."
"nice end. A yorker down leg, Behardien jams it out to long-on"
"straight to long-off. Caught on the boundary. Full outside off from Boult, Behardien gets underneath that easily but lofts the ball straight to the fielder. Should have hit that for six"
"slower ball outside off, pushed away to cover point. Good change in pace. Boult has been outstanding this evening."
"bouncer down leg, Morris runs down but misses a pull. Good change in length this time. Amazing stuff, this is where bowlers win matches when batsmen are expected to score."
"a wide yorker outside off, jammed away to the sweeper cover"
"eeks, that's probably not the best delivery. Full and wide, Duminy gets across but just plain misses a lofted drive"
"another swing and misses. Full and wide, Duminy misses the length completely. Was there to hit again. End of quite simply the best spell of T20 bowling I've seen in a while. 4-0-8-2"
"short on middle and leg, Morris anticipated that length, sat back and swatted the ball easily over midwicket. A flat six"
good delivery. Sees Morris backing away and coming forward so he fires it full and wide but inside the tramline.
"well bowled again. A slower ball down leg, Morris waits and heaves but misses connection. Just misses leg stump."
"a low full toss on off, looking for the yorker, sliced past point for a couple. Another well-executed delivery. If you are going to miss a yorker, miss it there."
"run-out. Another good delivery, sensational comeback from NZ. A legcutting slower ball outside off beats Morris' wild slog across the line. Ronchi picks up and throws the stumps down at the batsman's end as Duminy tries to steal a single."
four to finish. Nice batting from Parnell. Gets right across and swivels a flick into the gap between square leg and short fine leg.
"oh, nice start from Morris. Bowls it full outside off, gets plenty of away movement. Phillips lets this go."
"brings this one back in prodigiously. Great stuff. On a length, bringing the ball back in, tapped away towards point. Adjusted well did Phillips."
"on a length and straight, tapped towards point. Wants one but the fielder is quick to prevent his first international run. Good pressure from SA"
"back of a length outside off, Phillips misses a cut. Beaten for pace and bounce."
"there is his first run. Full on off, the ball swerves back in, driven to mid-off for a run"
"shot! Full and wide from Morris, Williamson lets his hands go through with a drive. Races away through cover point. Sublime timing. Class right from the outset"
"136 kph, full and straight, pushed to cover. A loud call of 'no' from Phillips. Knows what he wants, looks in control"
"beaten for pace again. Full outside off, Phillips misses a cut."
"a low full toss from Paterson on off, mis-timed towards mid-off for a quick single."
"good length on off, inside-edged to square leg"
"hustled for pace. Back of a length delivery outside off, Phillips is late on his pull, but gets enough to clear mid-on. AB cuts it off, running across from mid-off"
"that's well done. Good length around off, pushes towards point for one. That was not a boundary-scoring option so he took a sensible option, drop and run"
"Phillips' stuttering innings ends. Full and quick on leg, Phillips' feet are nowhere but he has created enough pressure to know he has to attempt a swipe across the line. Gets a thick inside edge and de Kock gets across easily to collect. Excellent line from Morris. On point so far have been SA"
"bowled 'im. First up. Full and straight from Morris, Munro looks to send his first ball over long-on but is undone by some inswing. The ball creeps in between a big gap between bat and pad to knock back off stump."
"slower ball on the pads, worked to square leg"
"full and straight from Morris, troubling Bruce for pace, defended to mid-on"
"good length outside off, Bruce is troubled for pace as he looks to pull. His first instinct was duck. Had to improvise a slap to mid-on"
"a double-wicket maiden. Awesome stuff from Morris. Full delivery outside off, the ball shapes away and beats the bat. Superb bowling."
"on a length on off, Williamson blocks. Good lines"
"shimmies down, and dabs one to third man from the crease. Well bowled."
"good single from Williamson. A yorker on middle, jammed away into the pad from Bruce. Williamson calls his partner through"
"back of a length delivery, sees Williamson coming. Strays down leg and Williamson misses a pull, but that was close enough to leg stump to be legal"
"on the pads, Williamson misses a flick, struck on the thigh pad. A leg bye to square leg"
"that's massive. Full and straight from Paterson, Bruce watches the ball onto his bat and then gives it a good thrash. Way over long-on."
"short of a length outside off, Williamson bails out of a pull because of the line. A cut would have been a safer option but played the next best shot with the position he was in"
"back of a length outside off, carved to third man from the crease"
"fullish delivery outside off, Bruce gets forward and defends to point"
"short of a length outside off, Bruce backs away and looks to hit over point but is beaten by bounce and pace."
"goes right through. A yorker down leg, 143 kph, Bruce is so late on his flick. The ball somehow misses leg stump. Morris owning NZ"
"gets this through this time. Back of a length outside off, Bruce somehow guides this through point. Found a gap even though it was uppish"
"swung away, on the bounce to deep square leg. Good length delivery on leg, Williamson doesn't time his swat"
"good length delivery outside off, Bruce tries to slog the ball through midwicket but mis-times a slap to mid-on"
"Williamson gets low for a scoop, misses. Parnell strays down leg and is punished. No way Williamson could have scored of that, good call"
"good length on leg, worked to square leg"
"a wild wipe is missed. Pace off the ball, a slower delivery on leg. Bruce is early through his pull"
"short and wide this time, Bruce stays in his crease, opens up his stance and thrashes the ball through cover. Nice timing"
"badly timed. Back of a length on leg, Bruce mis-times a pull over midwicket for a couple. Harried by the length"
"there is the boundary for the over. Back of a length down leg, Williamson nails his pull through backward square leg. Good shot selection"
"back of a length outside off, Williamson comes down the pitch but can only stab a ball to cover"
"picks out the fielder. Big wicket. A short delivery on leg, sits up for Williamson. Doesn't go all into the pull or keep it down or find the gap. All he does is picks out the square leg fielder to perfection. An easy reverse-cupped catch"
"shortish length outside off, dabbed towards third man for one"
"fullish around leg, no room, pushed away towards mid-on"
"nice end. Full around leg, played back to the bowler."
good bowling. Sees Bruce backing away so he follows him. Driven away towards mid-on
"some missed runs, on the pads down leg, Anderson misses a flick and is struck on the pad. Another dot. Anderson can't take too long"
"a swipe, mis-timed. great fielding from Paterson. On a length, Anderson's mow goes through backward square leg, the fielder gets across to his left and saves two"
"a slow delivery on off, dabbed down to third man"
"huge! Back of a length on middle and leg, Bruce goes deep in his crease and swats the ball way over square leg. Got enough behind that"

"flat on off, patted towards point"
"a googly on off, worked to long-on"
"the googly outside off, beats Anderson's swipe. Got down on one knee, looking to go over long-on. No connection"

"another googly outside off, shortish. Hammered but straight to deep cover. Fantastic bowling"
"another one that is quick and straight, inside-edged down to short fine leg. Just one."
"beaten. Back of a length on middle, Bruce misses a pull and the ball goes over the stumps. Getting out of hand now"
"good length delivery outside off, slapped back towards mid-off. AB cleans up."
"skied and taken. Is that it for NZ? Full on middle from Phehlukwayo, Anderson can only top-edge a heave and the ball goes straight up. De Kock shunts everyone out of the way, gets underneath it and takes a comfortable catch."
"fullish length outside off, goes through Bruce's bat. Another dot."
"short and wide, a hit-me delivery. Cut comfortably over point"
"somehow misses the stumps. On a length on middle, goes over the off stump."
"tossed up on off, driven away to long-off. Just one"
"fires this full and wide outside off, Bruce watches that go by"
"cleaned 'im up and that should be the game too. A ripping googly, the length is dragged back to create enough room for the ball to turn. Goes through a massive gap between bat and pad and knocks back off stump. Sets off on his celebratory run."
"gone first ball. Another googly from Tahir. This one doesn't turn too much. Ronchi plays for some, plays inside the line and the ball takes the outside edge. De Kock collects cleanly, sending Tahir on another run of joy."
"another googly on off, played into the off side"
"shortish and quick, mis-timed back to the bowler"
"on a length on off, shovelled to deep square leg"

guided to third man from the crease
"a high bouncer on off, de Grandhomme ducks. Wide called"
"good length on middle and leg, shovelled away to midwicket for a run"

"quick, flat and accurate outside off, played back"
"slogged away for six. A googly on middle, de Grandhomme picks the googly, gets down and sends the ball over square leg"
that is massive. He gets down to the pitch and sends the slog way over long-on. Hits the roof and returns into the field of play
"excellent bowling. Sees de Grandhomme coming and fires it wide outside off. He is too far from the ball to control, so he skews a slice and picks out the man at the sweeper cover boundary."
"the googly outside off, pushed away to long-on"
"fired in outside off, driven to cover for a run"
"six more. On the pads, Southee backs away and cobbles a slog deep into the stands over square leg"
