"good length at off stump, defended off the back foot to point"
"is he gone? <b>Yes he is!</b> That was the most sullen caught behind dismissal you will see. This is back of a length, outside off stump. Amla chases it with a cut and it carries through to Kedar, who doesn't appeal. No one appeals. Not till Amla appears to be walking off, at which point Aniket raises the question and the umpire, Shamshuddin, says okay"
"back of a length in the corridor, grips the pitch and nips away sharply to beat the outside edge"
"good length at off stump, big stride forward as he defends to mid-off"
"enough, says Guptill. Walks at the bowler, follows this full ball outside off and lifts it over extra cover. Got it off the bottom of the bat but the bat swing takes it well over"
"good length at off stump, defended square into the off side"
"offcutter, back of a length at leg stump. Forces him to offer the full face and push it past Marsh. He was looking to flick that initially"

"good length at off stump, slight shape away. Gets behind it and defends off the front foot"
"oh good ball. This is a dry, cracked wicket and his height is helping. Thuds into pitch at a length in the corridor, moves away to beat the outside edge"

"good length outside off, plants a stride in and looks to lift this over mid-off, but this is a slow pitch. He isn't to the pitch there and is through the shot early.

holes out. Disastrous start for Kings XI. Slides this across the left hander from around the wicket at a good length. Marsh wants to bludgeon this on the up but the angle has done him. Not the shot for this pitch. Hits it straight to long-off

"good length at off stump, he runs it to short third man off the back foot and ignores his partner who is looking for a run...then responds when the fielder fumbles and in the end it's a silly mix-up as the throw comes in. He has turned around and plonked his bat in time though. Third umpire confirms."
"good length at middle stump, goes on the back foot and punches it to long-off"
"<b>oh dear.</b> Completely messes this up, Jadhav. Stumping missed. This is drifted in nicely at off stump. Saha is down the track and closes the face too early. He's beaten on the outside edge and is way down the pitch. Jadhav doesn't collect. But he still has time to pick it up and break the stumps. Messes that up too, can't hold on."

"gone. Good bowling from Chahal. Tosses this up at a good length and gets it to dip quickly on an off stump line. Vohra sees it above eye level and is ready with the slog sweep, but that is down and spinning away before he can fully execute his shot.

"tossed up at leg stump, gets in a stride and pushes it to the bowler's right"
"back of a length at off stump, dropped into the off side with soft hands"
<b>dropped.</b> Aniket at backward point. Should have seen this coming. Maxwell goes for the reverse sweep at this good length ball. Connects decently but it is head height for Aniket who is too slow in getting the hands up
"good length, angled down the leg side, tickled to fine leg off the thigh guard"
oh poor Chahal. Another dreadful piece of keeping from Jadhav. This is full and pitching just outside leg stump. Maxwell is inside the line as he looks to slog this and completely misses. Jadhav has barely gotten up and hasn't even attempted to catch this
"good length at leg stump, backs away and pushes it back down the pitch after it skids on"
the bowler can't believe this. Watches Maxwell waltz across his stumps and bowls a good length ball outside off. Once more Maxwell is beaten on the slog and this time it squeezes through from between Jadhav's legs
this is good bowling. Watches him go down the leg side and follows him with a full ball. He can only squeeze it back to the bowler
"Maxwell is late on the reverse sweep at this length ball on middle stump, and skies to short third man, where Badree watches sheepishly before getting under it and holding on...<b>hang on, this could be a no-ball.</b> Phew. The umpire sent it upstairs after the catch was taken and replays showed he was very, very close to overstepping. The benefit of doubt is given to the bowler, it seems."

"back of a length at off stump, pushes into the off side off the back foot"
"full ball, angled into the pads. Flicked past short fine leg but long leg is there to cut it off"
"bowls a yorker down leg side, Saha looks to flick it square but gets an inside edge. Fine leg is very fine...but he <b>misfields and gives away a second</b>. Aniket."
"good length, offcutter, literally cuts the outside of off stump. Saha knows third man is in so he's looking to bunt this between that fielder and backward point. But there isn't enough room and the stumps light up"

"full at off stump, driven to long-off with a straight bat"
"goes for the bouncer outside off again, this time he looks for the upper cut and gets it off the outside edge. It goes fine and third man goes one-handed to his left...but it skids off the surface and goes under his arm for four"
"good length at off stump, pushed to extra cover off the front foot"

"back of a length in the corridor, looks to run this to third man with the angle, beaten on the outside edge"
"another appeal from Jadhav, but it's turned down. Another back of a length ball, angled across from middle, beats the outside edge as he tries to push to third man"

"short ball at middle stump, another attempted slog, beaten again. Flies over the stumps"

"ooooh this bounces back off the roof. A gentle length ball outside off stump, easy for Axar to swing his bat at this. Nails the connection and it's well over long-on"
"this is full and wide outside off stump, he hangs deep in the crease and slices this square. Chahal runs a long way to his left from sweeper cover, puts in a slide, loses his balance as he gets up, stumbles a bit but maintains enough balance to keep that in as it rolls away from him"
"short ball at middle stump, swivels and puts the pull away, over and wide of short fine leg"
shot. Shuffles across the stumps and camps there. Watson provides an overpitched ball in his arc and he clobbers this past the non-striker and well away from long-off
"goes for the yorker, misses by a long way, this is well past the wide marker"
"overpitched outside off, bat turns in his hands as he looks to hit this over extra cover. Not enough timing, but wide enough from long-off to take two"
"full ball at middle stump, can't get under this and can only poke it back down the pitch to the bowler"
"swing there as usual for Sandeep, brings it into Mandeep who defends the ball to leg"
"he wants a quick single, Gayle is scrambling to the keeper's end as Mohit swoops in from mid-on to fire a throw but misses. It was another inswinger, sltraighter this time, which Mandeep pushed to mid-on with a straight bat"
"shapes it away at 127kph not too far from Gayle's bat. Pitched around middle and off on good length, Gayle presented his bat close to the pad but missed"
"comes down and hands a catch straight to point! It was another swinging delivery from Sandeep, Gayle walked down in line with the leg stump and the ball swung enough to take the outside edge and fly straight to the fielder"
the ball is bang on middle stump and what does Kohli do first ball? Shuffles across to glance it fine down the leg side for four. Such confidence and anticipation
doesn't move that much now and waits for the ball to swing in to drive it past midwicket for two in the gap
"pulled for six over long leg! It was too short, too wide down the leg side, giving Mandeep time to wait and pull it late over the fielder to send it all the way"
"still too short and it's angling away way too much, Mandeep crunches it through the extra cover region off the back foot for a crisp four"
"<strong>inside edge</strong> falls short of Saha and deflects off him for four more! This was back of length outside off, Mandeep wanted to turn it to the leg side but the bat turned in his hands, there was an edge and luckily for him it fell short of the keeper before heading to the boundary"

"no movement now, slightly outside off and Mandeep chops it to third man"
"stays a bit low outside off, Kohli is on the back foot and defends as he watches it carefully"
"he's got Kohli too, <strong>clean bowled</strong>! Kohli charged down quickly, it was an inswinger from Sandeep which pitched around off and middle and came in, Kohli swung hard and missed it completely. What a blow for RCB, what accurate bowling from Sandeep"
there's an appeal for a <b>run out</b> as AB drove that dead straight and it hit the stumps at non-striker's end. Sandeep is claiming it touched his fingers and replays show it did. It looks like Mandeep's bat was down just in time but the third umpire wants to be 120% sure. Not Out gives the local crowd some relief
"starts outside off with a length delivery, Mandeep pushes that into the covers nicely"
swings it away pretty wide outside off but it's just inside the wide line
"nicely bowled outside off with no room and good length, he leans forward and defends to cover"
makes a bit of room and slices that with a thickish edge just over and wide of point! Aaron wasn't giving too much room so he made some on his own and gave it enough aerial route to keep it far from point

"good delivery to end the over - 142kph, seams in a bit from outside off, Mandeep is hurried a little bit to defend it just in time to off"

sees it's slightly overpitched with a hint of room and swings his bat to send that rolling between the stumps and Mandeep for four
"<strong>almost got him</strong>! AB opened up to drive that over the covers, it was a good length ball and a legcutter in fact to beat AB's outside edge and also the off stump"
"smacks it for six! Shuffled across to off this time, was served a short ball too and he clubbed it over midwicket"
"AB <b>caught behind</b>, Sandeep is on fire! This is beautiful swing bowling from Sandeep under pressure. He keeps his head and bowls it in the channel just outside off with lovely shape, AB charges down like Kohli and gets a thick outside edge for Saha to snap it easily"
"he takes a step or two down to negate the swing, Sandeep tries to shape it away a little from off and KJ defends it back nicely"
"angles it in to cramp him for room, Mandeep stays back and defends it back"
"just back of length, not too short, Mandeep tries to send it to leg with a short-arm pull but doesn't middle and finds mid on"
"that's much better. From Mandeep. It was much shorter, he stayed still and pulled it handsomely over the midwicket region for four"

"145kmh, nicely bowled outside off, Jadhav leans into it to defend from the middle to mid off"

"135kph, usual pace outside off and Mandeep punches it to sweeper cover"
"this is easier than catching practice to Axar Patel at short cover. Jadhav also charges down, not sure why, it's the slower ball, he tries to loft it over the infield but miscues it to Axar"
"length delivery outside off, Watson goes down on a knee and <strike>pops the question</strike> drives it down to mid off"
"slightly flat outside off, Mandeep cuts it off the back foot to sweeper cover"
"this one comes in with the angle towards off, Watson drives it nicely to long off"

hardly any room again and he pushes it to cover with a straight bat
bit more towards middle stump and Mandeep helps it down to long on

"back of length again, not as much room, but he punches it to sweeper cover nicely"
"angling in towards middle and leg, clipped off the pads easily"
"some bounce and beats Mandeep! Nice seam position, landed on it I think, and takes off from length. Mandeep tries to run it to third man with a cut but is beaten"

"that's a yorker after a six, and Mandeep digs it out to deep midwicket"
"darts it towards off stump, pushed into the covers for one"
leans into the full delivery and pushes it back
"slower through the air outside off, helped wide of point for one more"
"comes in with the angle a bit, Mandeep goes back and tucks it to leg"
"that's not a great ball but Watson has <strong>edged</strong> it to the keeper! It was short, it was wide and Watson got into position to cut it fiercely but only managed a thin outside edge. Saha did the rest"
goes back and across a bit and tucks the ball with the turn towards midwicket. Off the mark straightaway
"gets an edge first ball, Negi wanted to punch that into the off side but got a thick inside edge just past the keeper for a single"
"gets the middle stump! He rolled in a straight delivery from around the wicket, it was slightly short so Mandeep opened his stance to pull that over midwicket but he missed it completely and the ball hit the sticks"
""
"outside off with some room, defends it to cover"
"slightly fuller on middle, tucked to leg for one"
"<strong>big shout</strong> for lbw turned down! Coming in with the angle from outside off, struck Aravind right in front of middle but the umpire said no straightaway. Inside edge? No, replays show it was going over. Great call from the umpire"
"fullish outside off at 141kph, Negi defends it back towards mid off"

"lbw shout from Maxwell, but Aravind got an inside edge on this flat delivery from outside off"
