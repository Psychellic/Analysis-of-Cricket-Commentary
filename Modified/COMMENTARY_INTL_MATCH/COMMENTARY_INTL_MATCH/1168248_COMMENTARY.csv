"full on middle, and drifting into his pads. Flicked off his pads to deep backward square. Short runs around the boundary to intercept"

"back of a length on middle, and Dhawan takes a couple of steps forward to meet the ball. Punched to cover point, but can't pierce the gap"

"back of a length outside leg stump, and he rides the bounce to nudge a shot away to fine leg for a walking single"

"back of a length on off, and Dhawan uses his feet again. Punched to cover on this occasion"
"back of a length, slightly slower from Behrendorff. Worked off his hips to deep square leg for one"

"full just outside off, and pushed to deep extra cover for a walking single"
"<b>ramped straight to third man!</b> Back of a length outside off, and Rahul opens his shoulders to play a cheeky shot over third man. Done in by the lack of pace (119 kph) and the uppercut lobs in the air. No mistake from Richardson running in"

"length ball on leg, cramping Dhawan for space. Mistimes a pulled shot past short fine-leg to the man in the deep"
"slider on middle, and Kohli pulls along the ground to deep midwicket. Kohli completes the single quickly, but pushes Dhawan for the second. Sharp throw from Jhye Richardson and it's a <b>direct hit!</b> But Kohli's dive saves him. That was closer than he would've liked. Big roar from the crowd"
"<b>play and a miss!</b> Back of a length outside off, and he goes for the pull. Ball whizzes under his bat"
"full outside off, and he opens the bat's face to drive over cover. Stoinis, though, runs in from the boundary and dives forward to take a stunning catch. But it's been taken so close to the ground, that the umpires want to have a second look. Not sure which team will be happier with the wicket. Replays suggest that the ball did hit the ground, but his fingers may have been under it by then. Soft signal was <b>out</b> so this should be interesting. What does TV umpire Menon feel? Dhawan's gone if the TV umpire's unsure because of the soft signal. And the TV umpire says 'out'. But, we'll never know whether it was a conclusive decision or he stuck with the on-field umpire's call. India lose their second, and Dhawan's tiring innings comes to close"

"back of a length outside off, cut crisply to backward point"
"and again, a nice-looking, firmly struck cut, straight to backward point"
"ripping turn this time, similar line and length to the previous two balls. Pant is unsure whether to cut or leave, and he ends up not connecting"
"gone, the pressure's told on Pant! Tosses this one up enticingly, a fair way outside off stump, and Pant goes for the big heave and loses his shape. Wasn't quite full enough for him to control perfectly, and it turns and skews up in the air for Jhye Richardson to take an outstanding catch, sprinting to his left from long-off and throwing himself horizontally at the ball"
"very full on off stump, jabbed to midwicket"
"shortish, close to off stump, hurries through and Kohli pulls along the ground to long-on"
"ooh, that skids through, and is past Dhoni and leads to a hesitant appeal for a stumping. Up it goes to the third umpire. Quickish ball outside off, dips a little shorter than Dhoni expects as he walks forward to try and play it into the covers. Goes with the angle, past his inside edge, but he does extremely well, almost does a full split, to stretch his back leg back and juuust land it past the line"
"flighted a little slower outside off, slapped to cover"
"a bit of flight again, this time he flat-bats down to long-off"
"not that short at all, but Kohli is onto the back foot in a flash to create a boundary opportunity. Not that wide either, but the footwork has made this a cuttable ball, past the left hand of the diving backward point fielder"
"tossed up outside off, driven to sweeper cover"
"flattish, back of a length, angling across the stumps from over the wicket. Rocks back to pull to the right of long-on"
"slowed down, pitching just outside leg. Dhoni goes down on one knee for the leg-side heave, plays too early and misses and is hit on the back leg"
"another delivery along a similar trajectory, flighted and inviting Dhoni to go for another slog-sweep. Dhoni watches it better this time, and the ball soars way over the midwicket boundary"
"flatter now, on middle stump, goes back to whip it but can't get it past midwicket"
"short googly outside off, slapped to sweeper cover"
"flat again, straightens towards middle and leg, goes deep in his crease to pull to deep square leg"
"length ball outside off, carved up and over the covers, to the right of the sweeper. Not quite middled - he may have wanted to hit it straighter than where it landed up"
"back of a length on off stump, pulled to long leg, off the inner half of the bat. Kohli seems to be going a little too hard at some of his shots today"
"back of a length on off stump, opens up a touch and flat-bats to extra-cover"
"fuller now, angling into middle and off, and Dhoni hammers it away, clearing his front leg and simply bashing it down the ground, between the bowler and mid-off"
"back of a length, angling into leg stump, worked away to long leg"
"back of a length on off stump, carved away to deep point"
"wide, shortish slower ball, reaches out and slaps towards third man"
"short and wide, and Dhoni puts it away with ease, gets up on his toes and cracks it away to the point boundary, in the air to the right of the fielder at backward point"
"back of a length on middle and off, punched to long-off"
"length ball on off stump, and Kohli shuffles away from the line to make a bit of room, and lofts it cleanly, into the gap and over the boundary, to the left of long-off"
"a bit wider, Kohli has to reach out for it. Goes hard at the ball, a kind of front-foot uppercut, and third man, running to his right and diving, can't quite get to it before it bounces, but he can keep it from going to the boundary. Zampa the fielder"
"ooh, that was pretty much in the slot, and Kohli isn't too pleased with himself. Fullish, a bit of width outside off, and Kohli swings a little too early and misses his lofted off drive. May have been the slower ball, mind"
"slower ball, back of a length, angling into the body. Dhoni swivels to pull it off his hip towards long leg"
"slower ball, full and fairly wide of off. Dhoni drags it along the ground to long-on, bringing his bottom hand into play"
"and yet, he can hit shots like this. Another slower ball, on a length and finishing on about off stump. Kohli just brings his wrists into play and flicks it all the way over the midwicket boundary"
"and another! Similar length, wider this time, and Kohli frees his arms to deposit it high over the extra-cover boundary"
"That's a Mahendra Singh Kohli shot alright! A couple of steps down the pitch to the off-stump length ball, and he brings his wrists into play once more to whip it high over the forward square leg boundary"
"stump-high full-toss on off stump, clipped down to deep midwicket"
"back of a length on middle and off, pulled to deep midwicket"
"this is a good, containing length for this pitch. Flat and hurrying through at just under stump height. Goes deep in his crease to whip to long-on"
"flat again, but much fuller this time, right up near Kohli's back leg. Has to drag his front leg away from the line to try and flick it, and misses. Hits his back leg, but easily missing leg stump"
"flat length ball outside off, goes on the back foot to chop it to backward point"
"flat again, on middle and leg, goes back and punches to deep midwicket with a straight bat to bring up his fifty"
"again that hard-to-attack length, on off stump. Dhoni makes a bit of room to cut, a few yards to the right of backward point"
"dangled up slow on leg stump, slog-swept on the bounce to deep midwicket"
floated up and right in Dhoni's slot on off stump. Clears his front leg and gives it the full bottom-hand treatment to deposit it beyond the wide long-on boundary
"flatter, more leg-stumpish. Looks to pull but not quite short enough, drags it to the left of short fine leg off the inner half of his bat"
"fullish and quickish on off stump, makes some room and flat-bats it hard to long-off"
"monstered. Flights it again, lands it in MS's hitting arc just outside off stump, and he simply clears his front leg and hoicks it high over the midwicket boundary, that's landing in row L on any ground in the world"
"what a costly decision this has been, giving Short the 18th over. Shortish, on off stump, makes a bit of room and slaps it away to the point boundary"
"full slower ball outside off, quite wide. Goes hard at it, looking to hit over cover, and misses"
"excellent wide yorker, almost. Maybe a harsh call from Anil Chaudhary too - only marginally past the tramline, but Kohli had shuffled across in premeditation too. Reached out for it but couldn't connect"
"bam. Doesn't get his attempted wide yorker wide enough or full enough, and Kohli takes a step across his stumps to get a little closer and swing through the line to clear the long-off boundary comfortably"
"low full-toss outside off, driven to long-off"
"slower ball, back of a length, close to off stump, flat-batted down to long-on"
"low full-toss wide of off stump, great hands from Kohli to play a sliced drive into the gap between backward point and sweeper cover. Sharp running too to pick up two"
"wow. Full outside off and Kohli steps across once again and frees his arms through a hard, flat hit straight back over the umpire's head - not that far over - and run away to the boundary in a flash"
"wide yorker gone horribly wrong. Dhoni doesn't even attempt to play it, and Handscomb throws himself across the turf to prevent it from running away for even more runs"
"another wide outside off stump. Slower short ball, and Dhoni has to reach for it to try and cut it. Can't connect"
"miscued, and Dhoni won't get his fifty. Cummins bowls a cross-seam ball, just short of a good length, on about off stump, and Dhoni, aiming towards long-on, slices it instead and long-off takes a simple catch walking a few steps forward off the rope"
"slower bouncer, gets up to head height over off stump. Kohli shapes to hook and has to adjust to the lack of pace. Helps it along the ground through wide mid-on"
"back of a length on off stump and DK doesn't middle it, but he won't care. Goes for the cleared-front-leg pull and drags it off the inside half of his bat, into the gap to the left of short fine leg"
"slower bouncer outside off, and DK waits, waits some more, and uppercuts firmly, up and over short third man, to the right of the fielder"
"quick length ball, angling into DK's legs to try and deny him room. Clears his front leg and looks to whip over the leg side, misses, but they sneak a quick leg-bye even as Cummins closes down the ball in his follow-through"
"down the track, Cummins tries to bowl a slower ball out of his reach, well outside off, but doesn't quite succeed. He only allows Kohli to free his arms, and he does so gleefully to launch a crisp hit over the long-off boundary"
"<b>inswing</b> first up, but drilled through the covers! Full on off, and coming into Short, but he times this well to the wide long-off boundary"
"length ball, much better line. Once again jagging inwards, and Short inside-edges a flick right onto his pads. Ball rolls away to the off side as they scamper across for a single"
"back of a length, just outside off, and Stoinis carefully defends off the back foot"
"length ball, on off stump, and this pace will not bother Stoinis. Swivels, and pulls in front of square to the midwicket boundary"
"length ball, slightly outside off stump, and fended off the back foot to cover"
"full and wide outside off, and he presses forward to drive. Struck well, but intercepted at cover point"
"length ball on leg, and angling across Short. He tiptoes and steers a back-foot tap to point"
"length ball, wide outside off but coming inwards. Punched firmly through the infield, but Krunal chases after it, and parries the ball back to his partner. Solid throw from the deep to MSD"
"back of a length outside off, and he rides the bounce to punch. Off the bat's top-half, and it rolls away to mid off"
"back of a length outside off, and the ball doesn't bounce as much as Stoinis expected it to. Tiptoes to punch, but toe-ends the shot to mid-off this time"
"full outside off, and Stoinis is deceived by the slower ball (116kph). Looks to drive through the covers, but splices the shot to midwicket instead"
"back of a length outside off, and the ball jags away slightly. Cut away - but not well - to point for a single"
"full just outside off stump, and driven away from his body to mid off. Mistimed on this occasion"
"<b>He answers the captain's Kaul!</b> Back of a length on off, and Stoinis looks to pull. But ball sneaks under his bat, and clips the top of off stump. Another failure from Stoinis, the opener"
"full outside off, and a bit of <b>outswing</b> from Kaul. <strike>Maxi</strike> Finch looks to drive away from his body, but the ball whizzes past his outside edge"
"length ball, wide outside off, and he cuts this into the ground. Ball takes an awkward bounce as it's goes over point, but Rahul manages to get a hand to it, and slow the ball's pace down"
"<b>misfield!</b> From Rahul. Full ball outside off, and the square drive seems to go straight to point. But ball goes through him, and he's forced to give the ball a chase"
"full on middle, and he presses forward to defend. Ball rolls away to cover"
"back of a length on middle, and Short shapes up to pull. Mistimes a flat-batted shot to mid-on"
"length ball on middle, and angling away from Short. Cut square, but can't thread the gap"
"back of a length on middle, and nudged off the back foot to the sweeper-fielder on the leg side. A walking single for Short"
"length ball on middle, and worked off his hips to the leg side. Placed behind square, and the fielder at deep midwicket is too far away"
"length ball just outside off. Finch offers the bat's straight face to defend, and taps it back to Shankar"
"<b>sliced in the air!</b> And Dhawan completes the catch with a thigh-five to boot. Finch's poor run continues. Back of a length on off, and he looks to pull over midwicket, but the ball doesn't rise as much, and he lobs the catch to cover."
"<b>appeal for lbw</b> but Bumrah withdraws after realising there's an inside edge. Length ball on leg, and Short misses the swipe towards midwicket"
"full on middle, but Short chooses to go onto the back foot. Tapped to the off side, but finds mid off"
"full on middle, and he takes a step backward again, deep into his crease. Pushed to mid-off"
"full outside off, but Maxwell shuffles towards the ball's line, before punching to mid-off for a quick single"
"full on leg stump, and clipped to deep square leg for a walking single"
"<b>top-edged, but goes all the way!</b> Short ball that's soaring over Maxwell's head, but he attempts to pull, and gets enough connection to clear the boundary behind Dhoni"
"full on middle, and swinging slightly away. Driven away from his body, but mistimed to cover's left"
"full on off, and <B>crunched!</b> Just a bit of width, and he picks this early. Smacks it past cover's left for a much-needed boundary. Just four balls left in the Powerplay"
"back of a length on middle, and he raises his front leg, before pulling along the ground to deep backward square"
"back of a length on off, and he works this - off his hips - to the gap near square leg. Just a single on offer though"
"full toss wide outside off, and he <B>slaps this freebie</b> to the extra-cover boundary for four. No movement of the feet, all the power coming from his quick hands. Short's not missing those"
"length ball on off, and angling inwards. Worked off his legs to the sweeper-fielder manning the cow-corner region"
"back of the hand slower ball, full on leg stump. Muscled through mid-on's left to Chahal at cow corner"
"length ball on middle, and <b>paddled</b> over square leg! Delivery angling in, and he helps the ball over the infielder"
"another slower ball, length delivery outside off. He mistimes a square cut to the off side"
"length ball, wide outside off, and he tries to steer this shot between point and gully. Krunal runs to his left, and dives sideways to stop the ball from sneaking through"
"short on leg, and he stays on the back foot. Raises his front leg, and then helps a pulled-shot over the square-leg umpire's head"
"slower ball, full on leg, and whipped off his toes to deep midwicket"
"back of a length, quickish, on off stump, worked away through midwicket"
"shot! That wasn't all that short, and it was pitcing on middle stump and turning away a reasonable deal, but Maxwell rocks back and puts his bottom wrist to full use for a whip-pull that easily beats deep midwicket to his left"
"fuller, on the pads. Misses the flick, or maybe gets an edge on it, and the ball rolls towards short fine leg off the outside of his front pad"
"nice idea, but the execution goes slightly wrong. The quicker slider, angled away from Short and forcing him to reach out to drive. Just ends up angling it too wide"
"googly on a length, worked away wide of midwicket"
"looks to bowl that wide line he's bowled with success to Maxwell, but ends up bowling it too wide. Left alone"
"back of a length on the pads, nudged away through square leg, and doesn't put too much weight on the shot, so they can scamper two"
"wide length ball, rocks back to slap it to sweeper cover"
"flat, back of a length, angling into the stumps, makes room and punches to extra-cover"
"not that short, angling into middle stump, rocks back and pulls to the left of deep midwicket. Kept slightly low but he watched it well and crouched a little while playing the shot"
"flat, slanted across the left-hander, no turn back in. Lovely shot from Short, hangs back and chops it away to the left of the diving backward point fielder. Not the most athletic-looking effort from Bumrah"
"back of a length on off stump, makes room and punches to long-off"
"fired into the pads, clipped into the backward square leg region"
"length ball on off stump, and that's easily put away, just frees his arms and hits it flat and hard, back over the bowler's head"
"fairly full, on the pads, clipped down to long-on"
"gone, that's an excellent... wait, that's just slipped through Rishabh Pant's grasp at backward point. Short outside off and Short cuts uppishly. Pant dives forward and to his right, and the ball bursts through his hands about a foot off the ground. A <b>dropped</b> chance, relatively straightforward"
"shot! A bit of flight outside off, and Maxwell has lofted that effortlessly over the wide long-off boundary"
"looks to clip this through the leg side, closes his face early and sends a leading edge rolling into the point region"
"fairly full outside off and Short goes for the big loft. Doesn't connect cleanly, and luckily for him it goes flat and bounces well short of long-off"
"fired into the pads, clipped away through midwicket"
"flat, back of a length, keeps going with the angle towards the batsman. Clears his front leg to pull but it isn't short enough and sneaks under to hit thigh pad"
"fuller now, clipped quietly to long-on"
"flat, back of a length, turning from off to middle, stays back and whips through square leg"
"and Maxwell still finds the boundary. Floats this full and wide, seemingly secure with long-off and extra-cover back, but Maxwell is able to flat-bat this much straighter, bringing his bottom hand into play, and find the gap to the right of long-off"
"slower this time, on leg stump. Looks to flick and pops a leading edge just out of reach of Krunal, leaping to his left with left arm outstretched"
"length ball on off stump, stays back and slaps it to long-off"
"and he strikes first ball! Slower ball, angled across the stumps from over the wicket. Short clears his front leg and looks to hit it over the on side with a cross bat, and ends up slicing it high in the air, to Rahul waiting under it in the covers"
"short outside off, stops on the batsman a little and he chops it down to point"
"slower ball, but it's misdirected, on the pads, and Maxwell still finds enough pace to use and glance it away fine, a long way to the right of long leg who's stationed quite square"
"another slower ball, loopy and descending onto Maxwell's front foot. Clipped to long leg"
"back of a length outside off, stabbed away into the cover point region. Doesn't come on for the cut and he ends up meeting it well in front of his body"
"slower ball gone wrong, ends up whanging it waaay outside off stump"
"wham. He's bowled a lot of slower balls, and Maxwell was well prepared. Back of a length, on off stump, and he's back and across in a flash and has all the time in the world to swat this away over the midwicket boundary. That makes it 13 off this over, and 38 off Shankar's four. I guess India will take it, especially since he got the wicket of Short."
"tossed up outside off, driven to long-off"
"back of a length, cramping Maxwell with the angle from round the wicket. Worked off the hip into the backward square leg region"
"flat, back of a length, angling into leg stump. Punched down to long-on"
"flat length ball on off stump. Goes back almost by rote, and he doesn't have the room to actually punch it where he wants - to long-on. Ends up playing a defensive push into the on side and Krunal cuts off the single"
"back of a length again, worked to deep midwicket to bring up his second fifty of the series. Excellent innings"
"again, back of a length, stump-to-stump, angled in from wide of the crease, no turn, and forcing the batsman to go leg-side. Clipped away to deep midwicket"
a couple of steps down the pitch and Chahal fires it a little shorter and wider. Driven to extra-cover
"down the track and this time Chahal bowls it at his pads, flat and quick. Clipped away quietly to deep midwicket"
flat slider on leg stump. Makes a lot of room and opens his bat face to squeeze a single to the right of backward point
"down the track once again comes Handscomb, and that's a lovely crisp hit. Ends up getting one right in his slot for the inside-out chip over wide long-off, hits it well enough to nearly carry all the way"
"length ball on middle and off, swept away to the right of deep backward square leg"
"back of a length slider on leg stump, makes room to punch to deep extra cover"
"nice change of pace. He usually goes quick, quick, quick, and Maxwell is too early on his slog-sweep, misses and the ball hits him high on the thigh"
"wide outside off, back of a length, Maxwell reaches out to cut and misses"
"back of a length on middle and leg, pulled to deep midwicket"
"length ball on off stump, pulled in the air, on the bounce to deep backward square leg"
"flat length ball angling into off stump, and too quick for the reverse-swat. Bit of an lbw shout, but India don't review. May have straightened just enough to miss off stump"
"whoa, that's the biggest hit of this innings. A big front-foot stride to a back-of-a-length ball close to off stump, and he generates incredible power through his hips to wallop that waaay over long-off"
"flat and back of a length again, and Maxwell goes too early into the pull, drags it along the ground to deep backward square leg"
"back of a length on middle and leg, nudged into the vacant midwicket region and they scamper two while the fielder sprints in off the boundary"
"full, just outside leg. Was looking to cramp him by attacking his pads, but he's marginally missed his line, and Maxwell gets down on one knee at great speed and swivels through a sweep that easily clears the backward square leg boundary"
"Chahal goes to his wide-outside-off line, and Maxwell's response is emphatic, a reverse-sweep off incredible power and bat-speed, whacked over the point boundary. The key was how quickly he created a wide base with his footwork"
"full on the pads, clipped to deep midwicket"
down the track and Chahal floats a full one outside off. Pushed out to deep extra-cover for one
"flat, fairly wide outside off. Hurries through to beat Maxwell's attempted cut"
"shortish outside off, jabbed to the left of backward point. Krunal dives, stops it, and throws to the bowler's end. Bumrah is in front of the stumps, he leaves it, the ball misses the stumps, and they sneak an overthrow"
"full, plenty of width, a rare free hit from Bumrah, and you don't bowl those to Maxwell in this mood. Drives it up and over cover, finishing with a high left elbow"
"in the blockhole on off stump, jabbed down to long-off"
"length ball on off stump, opens his bat face and steers it down to third man"
"that's a great shot. Not the most attractive shot he's played, and it's muscled rather than timed, but he's gone so deep in his crease to convert a slightly back-of-a-length slower delivery into a short ball and he swivels to beat the diving square leg fielder"
"very full outside off, Maxwell slices it flat and hard towards deep point"
"short ball just outside off, maybe the knuckle ball, and Maxwell swivels too early into his pull and gets hit on his back"
"dismissive. That's smacked the top corner of the sightscreen, on the full. Length ball outside off, and he just clears his front leg and smacks it through the line"
"in the blockhole on off stump, whipped away to deep square leg"
"yorker just outside off, good use of the hands to steer it to the right of third man"
back of a length slower offcutter heading towards leg stump. Punched down to long-on
"waist-high full-toss. We'll have to check for no-ball here. Yup, it is, but it doesn't matter to Maxwell, who opens up at the hips and simply wallops this over wide long-on. Sensational hitting, moves to 98"
"another full-toss - seemed close to waist height but perhaps just below - outside off. Maxwell flat-bats it on the full to long-off, but this, of course, is a free hit"
"yorker just outside off, jams his bat down and squeezes it past the right of the diving keeper. Off the cue end of the bat, and he'll only get a single, but that's all he needed to bring up his third T20I hundred. First Australian to the mark. What a player."
"length ball outside off, opens his bat face and jabs to backward point"
off-stump yorker. Gets his front foot out of the way and fashions a one-legged flick to square leg
"full-toss, about stump high, on middle stump. Punched straight back and it hits the middle stump at the other end"
"another low-ish full-toss. More leg-stumpish this time. Punched to long-on, bat jarring on impact"
"full on off stump, Laxmaned down to long-on"
"back of a length close to off stump, slapped to point, can't beat the diving fielder"
"ooh. Backward point is right on the edge of the circle, and Handscomb has opened his bat face and squeezed this off-stump yorker straight to the fielder to get off strike"
"make that one off three. What a sensational shot. Attempted yorker misses the length marginally, and the wide-ish full-toss is launched straight back over the bowler's head with an incredible bottom-handed shovel"
"and there's the win, Australia seal a 2-0 series victory. Back of a length on off stump, and Maxwell makes a bit of room and flat-bats it to the right of extra-cover. He's been simply unstoppable today"
