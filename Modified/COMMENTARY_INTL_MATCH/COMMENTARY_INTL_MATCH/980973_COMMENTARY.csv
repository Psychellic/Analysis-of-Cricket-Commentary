"oh no. Poor start to Mumbai's new home from Southee. Short and wide, not sure what else you expect from that length to this man. Warner slaps the ball in front of cover, races away for four. Yummy start for Warner"
"nice length, swings back in and hits Warner high on the pad, in front of leg. Southee tumbles over in his follow through, but belts out an appeal after. Way too high for consideration. A scampered leg bye"
not a great line from Southee. Fullish and drifting on Dhawan's pads. Flicked but straight to short fine leg. Southee needs to start his inswinger a lot wider outside off
lovely. 136 kph. Not a great line again but the length was really good. The inswinging yorker swung back in late and was swinging down leg in fact. Dhawan somehow got bat on his flick to square leg. Hustled for pace
"well played. Good length on off, Warner opens the face of his bat to glide to third man"
"another yorker. Doesn't swing as much, 139 kph, on off. Dhawan jams out to mid-off"
"impeccable lines and lengths. Good length on off, Warner taps it to points and wants one, but Dhawan says no"
"Warner gets a response from Dhawan this time. Similar lines and lengths, very close to off and middle, Warner defends towards point and sets off"
"nice lines these from MM. 132 kph, in the channel around off. Dhawan stays back and punches to cover"
a bit of width. Rather be straight than there to Dhawan. Shortish outside off and scythed to third man
that is a god run. Nothing wrong with the delivery at all. Warner brings out all his experience to push with soft hands to mid-on and get one. Good length on off and middle
"127 kph. Not a bad choice of delivery, bad execution. The bouncer is on leg, instead of more towards off and middle. All Dhawan needs to do is get bat on his pull, and get gets four to fine leg. Helped along"
"slower offcutter on middle, glided down to third man"
"oh yes. Superb shot from Dhawan. Fullish length outside off, Dhawan strides forward and punches the cover drive between cover and mid-off. Rohit sprints it down and keeps the ball in. Easy three"
"ooh, well bowled. Short on off, Warner surprised by the extra bounce, tries to get on top of it to ride it down but can't. Steered past point, to thirdman, uppishly"
"short again on middle, pulled into the ground, to square leg. Got on top of the bounce well, rolled his writs over"
"another slower cutter on middle, tapped to square leg with soft hands. knew exactly what he was doing all along, and he makes two with enviable ease"
"well bowled. Full on leg, hustling Warner for pace who flicks to deep square leg"
"slow but short on off, thwacked to cover off the back foot"
"slapped for six. Warner is in some form. This is an incredulous shot. Tossed up on off, Warner doesn't bother getting close to the pitch. Instead, he bends one foot and smashes the ball over long-on."
"shortish and wide outside off, cut to point"
"that was all hands. Sensational batting this. Shortish on off, Warner backs away, and slices the ball in the gap through point. Played that touch later to find the gap. Magnificent"
"91 kph, good pace. Decent length, on off, and swatted to cover."
"great stop from Rohit. A loose offering outside off, short and wide. Warner backed away initially, but then reached out for it, smashed the cut to extra cover where Rohit put in a boundary-saving dive"
"cut for four again. Warner is in great touch. Not even that wide from Bumrah, he backs away just a  touch to create room, and then he finds the gap through point. My, my."
"slower offcutter on leg, tucked to square leg for one"
"good lines. Good length on off, top-of-off stuff. Patted to point."
"another slower delivery on off, keeps a tad low. Dhawan misses his pull, evades off stump by not too much"
"137 kph, full on off, driven to mid-off. No run there. Dhawan sends Warner back"
"nice comeback from JB. Another offcutter on off, Dhawan inside-edges towards short midwicket and gets one"
"nicely played. Short on off, Dhawan sways out of the line and then steers the ball past gully"
"lucky Mitch, lucky lucky Mitch. Short and wide to Warner, scythed away, Rayudu gets across from point and stops the ball"
"goes over the infield this time. This is enjoyable batting from Davey W. Not a bad delivery at all, good length on off. He manufactures a shot by giving himself room and smashing over mid-off"
"won't get away twice. Mitch is short and wide again, Warner sees the opportunity and puts the offering away, past point with a laced cut. Sensational timing."
"127 kph, slower delivery outside off, smashed to that deep cover fielder"
"fullish outside off, inside-edged to midwicket, Warner wants two again. Dhawan sends him back"
"poor start for Hardik. Drifting down leg, Dhawan misses a routine flick. clips the pad to the keeper"
"short on middle, pulled away to backward square leg. Sufficiently in the gap for two"
"slower ball on off and middle, bunted to midwicket"
"poor line and punished again. Hardik has not had a great IPL so far. Straying on leg, Dhawan whips the ball away with discernible use of the wrists to get it fine. Bumrah's exuberant dive in vain"
"leg side-ish again, worked away off his pads to midwicket. Two more, really nice timing"
"awful bowling from pandya. Just can't adjust his line. Another offcutter on leg, Dhawan nudges off his pads to backward square for a couple more"
"well bowled, sees Warner advancing and shortens his length and pushes it wider. Warner improvises with a well-timed cut to point"
"92 kph, slower and wide outside off again, a slap-chop to cover"
"very fast and very wide outside off, Warner thinks he will get the extra but the call of wide never comes. he isn't too happy either"
"short and wide again, the same modus operandi from Bhajji. Cut to short third man for one"
"oh nice placement. Krunal, this time, with some sloppy fielding. Shortish and wide, Dhawan finds the gap between third man and point. Krunal wasn't decided whether to go with feet or hands. In the end, he kicks at air and allows the ball through"
"shortish but straight, pulled to square leg"
"Dhawan not happy with the umpire this time. Very wide outside off, may have been just outside the tramline, marginal call."
"offcutter outside off, sliced to the sweeper cover"
"another cutter, pace off the ball seems the way to go. Pushed to long-off with the angle"
"bowled from way behind the crease, a Pollard special. Dhawan comes down and scythes the ball past point. Dhawan had to wait before meeting the ball"
"108 kph, bowled from very wide of the crease. Another offcutter though on off, patted to point."
"yet another offcutter outside off, very wide outside off, called this time"
the 728th offcutter Pollard has bowled in a row. Warner gently plays the ball to point for one.
"very short, very wide, slapped to point"
"92 kph, fired in outside off, way too wide again. Called"
"short outside off, swatted in the gap at midwicket for four. Reached out and dragged the pull. Wow, what batting"
"short and quick on off, <strong>Warner misses a cut</strong>"
pummeled for four. Understandable that harbhajan was bowling wide in fear of his protection but he errs now and almost bears the brunt. drilled back at harbhajan's feet who hurries to get his feet out of the way
"massive, just a massive moment in this game. Harbhajan bowls it wider outside off, Warner chooses a lofted drive but doesn't get all of it, the ball skews off the outside half into Pollard's reverse-cupped hands at long-off. Pollard is more than happy."
"well finished. Harbhajan allows the ball some air outside off, kept a tad low and KW whips to midwicket"
"a bit of a sloppy fumble. Darted in on off, Dhawan stays back to punch back to KW, Krun;al gets in the way but allows the ball through"
"fired in on off, steered to third man"
"nicely bowled. Floats it up outside off, slap-drive to long-off earns Dhawan one"
"flatter on middle, 96 kph. Nurdled to midwicket for one, a dive by Rohit"
beautifully bowled. Sees Dhawan coming and drops the ball shorter outside off. Dhawan is nowhere near the pith and so he just pushes it back
"slowed up outside off, driven to long-off for one. Tidy over for Mumbai"
"91 kph, lots of air on off, not much turn. Driven to long-off. Dhawan seems intent on taking this deep"
"flat again outside off, punched back to Dhawan , Harbhajan stops it nicely"
"gone, chipped straight to midwicket. A nothing shot from KW. Well bowled though, lots of air on the offbreak and KW plays too early, gets a but of a leading edge. Rohit scurries in and dives low in front of him to pick up the ball inches off the ground. Great catch."
"flat on off, carved to the sweeper cover"
"quite flat again, not much air on that. Dhawan stays back and drives back to the bowler"
"a bit of loop and slowness to that, Dhawan has enough time to rock back and work to square leg"
"short and wide outside off, whacked away with a sliced cut to sweeper cover"
"good length, outside off. Shaping away. An outside edge to third man"
"slower ball on off, nice cutter. Good direction. Pushed to mid-off"
"another slower ball on off, pace off. Turned to square leg, just one"
"what happened there? Big chance for anothee wicket, but Bumrah can't hit. Yorker on off, Yuvi plays to short midwicket. Dhawan races off for one but Yuvi says no. Dhawan is nowhere near as bumrah picks up. He turns around and fires an inaccurate throw to the bowler's end. Rohit was hurtling in too."
"slower offcutter to finish, defended to point. Great over from JB"
"132 kph outside off and full, Dhawan mis-times a drive to mid-off."
"shot! Short and wide, Yuvi stays back, and then leans into the cut to find the gap past point for a couple. Well played."
"good bouncer, well-directed too. Yuvraj can only hurry underneath"
"a forward shimmy from Yuvraj. Very full on off, Yuvi drills a drive to long-on"
"super shot. Good fielding at the boundary too. Full toss on middle, scythed away through point. Rayudu at sweeper cover keeps it in with a nice dive"
"a wide offcutter this time, Dhawan chooses to pull but the ball keeps low and sneaks under Dhawan's cross-bat"
smashed. 100 kph offcutter outside off from Polly. Yuvraj thanks him with a drilled drive past cover. Power
"massive from yuvi. Shuffles across, sets up and swats the ball over long-on. Huge, the Yuvi of old. What a shot. A nice clean swing through the ball. Can't bowl there to anyone"
"offcutter on off and middle, Yuvraj gets bat on his pull, to short fine leg. Some smiles"
"another slower delivery outside off, pushed to long-off to give Yuvraj strike"
"over the keeper for a couple. A very slow ball on middle, a lazy shot as the ball is top-edged over the keeper. Short third man runs around to clean up."
"short and wide, Yuvraj looked to force it through cover but did not make connection. outside the wide tramline but Yuvraj had shuffled across"
"slower delivery on off, Dhawan shuffles across and tries to work the ball past short fine leg but misses. The ball hits him high in front of off. Big appeal, but easy call."
"another slower cutter, Mumbai taking pace off the ball continually. Yuvraj meets the ball earlier, and swats to deep square leg, on the bounce"
"under-edged for four. Full and wide outside off, Dhawan reaches out for it and gets an edge. Flies to the third man fence"
"yet another offcutter banged in the middle of the pitch. Dhawan pulls to deep midwicket for a fifty. Good innings, he has anchored this."
"136 kph bouncer on off, Yuvraj backed away and swatted at it furiously. Missed, but the wide is called"
sensational power from Yuvraj. Another slower ball outside off - predictable - and Yuvraj muscles his drive past cover. Great batting. Mitch M has got to vary his pace
"much like that. A shortish delivery outside off, slapped in front of cover this time, even Pollard at long-off can't prevent two."
"great batting. Gives himself some room, Bumrah's full delivery is very wide and so Dhawan reaches out for it and slices over third man. Nice"
"inch-perfect yorker down leg. Dhawan backs away yet again, but fails to connect"
another offcutter and Dhawan was anticipating the full delivery. he shuffled across and ramped the scoop over short fine leg. Nice execution
"no, full tosses are a big no-no at this stage. Full toss on middle, and flicked to the backward square leg boundary"
"the offcutter misses Dhawan's flaying bat. Outside off, three boundaries and two dot balls"
"114 kph slow offcutter on off, tapped to point to end another productive over for Sunrisers"
"pace off the ball, outside off, Dhawan inside-edges his heave to fine leg and scampers back for the second"
"136 kph, full and wide outside off, drilled to long-off, but just one."
"muscled into the stands over midwicket for six. Power, all power. Not a bad delivery but these slower deliveries are quite predictable, cross-batted swipe over deep midwicket for a humongous hit"
"thrashed off his hips to square leg, on the bounce"
"poor ball this. A slower bouncer down leg, all Dhawan needed was some  bat and that he got. Raced to the fine leg fence, this is some charge."
"excellent finish. Yorker on leg, Dhawan digs it out. Yuvraj says no."
"offcutter on middle, Yuvraj shaped for a mow over midwicket, but improvised a nudge to square leg"
"dropped. But did Parthiv save three? Slower delivery again, Dhawan walks across and scoops it. Parthiv gets across with a leap but can only get fingertips on that. The disadvantages of being short"
"another cutter outside off, chopped back to the keeper"
"low full toss, full pace on it ensured Yuvraj got to the ball later. On the bounce to Pollard at long-on"
"another full toss, this isn't great bowling. He was waiting for that, and just checked his heave over square leg. Adequate connection and six"
"four more. Backs away, the bowler follows him and then Dhawan helps it along, to the backward square leg boundary. Big overs"
"great batting from Yuvraj. Mitch M fires it full and wide, but Yuvraj shuffles across and sweeps the ball into the gap at square leg. There is no deep fielder there"
"excellent yorker, squeezed to midwicket. Yuvraj has played a more-than handy cameo"
"short and wide, a flat-batted slap to long-off for one."
"137 kph. Mitchell McClenghan fires a full and wide delivery. But Yuvraj is so deep that after he withdraws from the stroke, his bat comes down and hits the off stump. Yuvraj has hit his own stumps. Just standing too deep. End of a great cameo"
"offcutter outside off, Henriques swings and misses. Vital dot ball. Dhawan will not get on strike"
"good length on middle, worked to deep square leg for a finish to end."
swings that in and tickled to the square leg fence for four. What timing. Poor ball though. Too straight from Bhuvi but nice swing
"good length and way too wide outside off, steered to third man. Bowling on both sides of the wicket"
"good length, pitched outside leg, swerves back in and hits Parthiv on the thigh pad. A mini appeal is quickly withdrawn"
"another poor delivery. Full and wide, sliced to KW at backward point who puts in a boundary-saving dive"
"brings this one back in, fullish and coming back in outside off, driven to cover. Full face of the bat"
"given. Immediately given. Good length, and darts back in from off. Parthiv is hustled for pace and doesn't read the direction of swing. Hits Parthiv in front of middle, was that a tad high? Marginal so not a bad decision. Bhuvi's dual swing direction helps take a wicket"
"gone. Big big wicket for Sunrisers. Match-changing moment in the game. Very full outside off, comes back in just enough. Rohit drives loosely and gets a big inside edge which clatters into off and middle stump. Rohit went after the drive with leaden feet. Poor shot"
"nice shape. Fullish and wide outside off, Pandya plays defensively towards point"
goes straighter and whipped to wide mid-on. Nice shape again from Nehra
"good length outside off, Krunal pokes and is beaten convincingly"
"full length on off, driven to mid-off"
"a nice change-up but poor direction. Short on leg, Pandya helps it along to the fine leg fence. Easily done."
"almost another wicket. Banged in on a good length on off, Rayusu lets the ball come before defending late. the ball lobs up and bounces over the stumps"
"quite full on off, driven to mid-off"
shot. Strays in line again does Bhuvi and he is punished. Whipped away off the pads over square leg and four easy runs
"good length outside off, steered down to third man with the open face. Well played"
"clears the infield and almost makes the boundary. A fullish length delivery which shapes away, and Krunal gets a leading edge over cover. Just two though, good fielding"
"in the gap and four. Nice batting, full delivery on off, Krunal drives and finds the gap wide of mid-off. Did not time it too well, but he still got four"
"134 kph, good length on off, some inward shape to the right-hander. Played down to point for a quick run"
"superb shot from Krunal and that has cleared the long-off boundary. Good length on off, krunal lofts the ball with a clean straight bat, holds the pose too. Times it really well too. All things right about that"
"fullish on middle and leg, whipped away to wide midwicket"
"taken. What a beauty from Nehra. Short delivery on off, Rayudu surprised by some extra bounce tries to ride the ball, but then decides the ball is getting too big on him, and then tries to drop his hands. But by then it is too late. The ball hits the handle of the bat and lobs off towards backward point. Easy take"
a bit of a misfield from cover allows Buttler to get two free runs. Full on middle and hit nicely to cover
"taken and Mumbai are tottering. Nehra has three. Pushed wider outside off, Buttler, with leaden feet, prods again and gets a thick outside edge. Naman dives full-length and takes a stunning one-handed take to his right."
"good length outside off, Krunal wafts and is is beaten"
"another one and Mumbai are falling away, very very very quickly. Back of a length on leg, the ball stops in the surface and Krunal goes on with his whip. Gets there early and ends up chipping the ball to midwicket. Mumbai are in deep trouble."
"beaten. Not sure if Hardik attempted to play that. Good length outside off, Pandya plays inside the line and the ball deviates past"
"hits a good length on middle, solidly defended under his eyes"
"136 kph. Full length on middle and leg, the ball deviates in off the seam and strikes Pandya in front. Too high though"
"shortish and wide, Pandya goes after it and gets a thick outside edge, to third man"
"good length on off, not much movement. Defended"
"good length outside off, 126 kph. Pandya goes after it but mis-times a drive to mid-off"
"the no-look pull. Short on middle, Hardik did not bother keeping his eyes on the ball but somehow connected to square leg for one"
"fullish on off, Pollard defends solidly, under his eyes. Despite so many wickets going down, Pollard can't defend deliveries. he has got to look to get off strike and pick up singles at least"
"slower ball on leg, Pollard looking to defend, misses. Off the pad. He has got to do more."
"better. Short delivery on middle, pulled but to short fine leg. Rolled his wrists nicely on that"
"short and wide, slapped to the sweeper cover fielder"
"strays down leg, clipped to fine leg for a run"
"rather full outside off, inviting the ball to swing. Uppishly pushed to deep cover"
another poor delivery down leg from Moises. Pings off Pollard's pads and flies towards fine leg
"130 kph, good length on middle, worked to a wide fine leg"
"ooh, nice. Fullish outside off, the ball swerves away. And  beats Pandya's bat"
"full outside off, Pollard goes for a big hit down the ground. good choice of stroke with mid-off in the circle. Despite mis-timing it, it clears mid-off and runs away for four"
"short and wide outside off, squeezed to point"
a forward shimmy and gets a short delivery. Pollard pulls behind square and finds the gap for four. Found the gap really well. Rolled his wrists on it.
"138 kph, steps out again. Fullish outside off, skewed to midwicket off the inside half of the bat"
"good length outside off, glided of the open face to third man"
"slower offcutter at 116 kph outside off, drilled past cover. Warner hurtles to the ball to keep the batsman to one"
"another slower delivery outside off, hammered along the ground, to mid-off"
"121 kph slower delivery on middle, swatted to deep square leg. Just one"
"overpitched on off, a drilled drive finds mid-off. Pollard biding his time"
"131 kph, is that the game? it could be. Pollard holes out to long-on. And Mumbai's hopes are falling away drastically. Fullish on off, Pollard chooses to go over long-on, but cannot find adequate connection. Off the inside half and long-on takes a sitter"
"full length on off, driven into the surface, to mid-off"
"122 kph. Good length on off, Pandya cross-bats a swat to long-on, on the bounce"
"given first ball. Good length on middle and cuts away, Pandya pokes at it and it looked like, he missed his waft. But the umpire raises the finger and Pandya is now gone. Pandya is not happy at all. Inconclusive replays"
"fullish on middle, 135 kph, driven to long-on after backing away."
"ooh, slower delivery outside off, Harbhajan pushes at it, with his feet stuck in the crease. Convincingly beaten"
"back of a length on middle, awkwardly nudged to square leg"
Southee runs at the bowler and bunts the ball to long-on for one

"full and wide outside off, Harbhajan lofts his cover drive for a couple in the gap over cover"

"full and straight, pushed to long-on. Mumbai have no choice but to play for net run-rate"
"slowish delivery again outside off, tip and run to cover"
"end of another frugal over. Good length slower ball on off, played back"
another one. Southee is gone now. Another of those cutting offcutters that rip past a right-hander. Southee wants to hit that into the long-on stands but all he can get is a thin nick on it and the keeper takes an easy catch.
switch hit attempted first ball. Yikes. Somehow he gets bat on it to square leg/point. Hmm.
"137 kph, the quicker fuller ball, squeezed to midwicket"
"low full toss on middle, nudged to wide long-on for a couple"
"offcutter outside off, Harbhajan leaves"
"slower offcutter again outside off, chipped to deep point"
"good length on middle, pushed down to long-on"
"just in front of Warner at long-on. Slower delivery outside off, slapped to that fielder with a cross-batted swat"
"another slower delivery on middle, Harbhajan this time, goes for a wild slog but gets a thick inside edge. Evades the stumps and goes to the fine leg fence"
worked to fine leg
"direct hit and would have been gone. MM switch hits again, and connects this time. Straight to short third man/fine leg. Mustafizur picks up and fires but misses at the batsman's end"
"slower delivery on off, swatted to deep midwicket"
"134 kph, MM executes nicely this time. Shuffles right across and scoops the ball over short fine leg. More in control"
"low full toss on off, drilled to long-on"
"ooh, goes wider of the crease and the offcutter rips past Harbhajan's bat"
starts this one too straight and it goes further down leg. Wide called
"another cutter, but this one has started too wide outside off. And carries on. Called. Not sure that was a wide"
"130 kph, good length on middle, Bhajji closes the bat face to find a nudge to midwicket"
"yorker outside off, McClenaghan fails to connect."
"taken. Mitchell McClenaghan's exuberant knock ends. Another offcutter on leg, McClenaghan plays too early and gets a thick leading edge. Lobs up to Henriques at midwicket, who backtracks and takes a good overhead catch"
"a thick outside edge for four. Yorker outside off, Bumrah plays it late and squeezes four to third man"
"slower delivery outside off, tapped to third man"
back of the hand slower ball goes wrong. Very wide outside off and left alone
"full and wide, thwacked to the sweeper cover for a run"

"112 kph outside off, driven to deep cover"

"full toss on leg, clipped wide of midwicket for four. Dhawan puts in a desperate dive but can't haul it in"
"yorker on off, jammed out"
fullish length outside off. Steered to point. Absolutely nothing happening
"132 kph, edged and gone. Mumbai stumble to a massive loss. Sunrisers muster a massive win. Shaped away outside off, Bumrah pokes and gets a thick outside edge which is well taken by Naman."
