runs in quick and fires in a back of a length ball that is pushed across and beats the outside edge

"back of a length, lot closer to off-stump than the first two. Slightly squares up the batsman and beats the outside edge"
"now he tries to get the front leg out of the way and swings wildly. He had to move closer to the ball. Instead, he goes away from it and ends up making no contact"
"finally come contact. And it's a short ball on leg and middle, around chest height, pulled away through the backward square leg"
Taylor switches back to the outside off channel but pushes it across at a very full length. Noor Ali is able to get behind it through and carts it uppishly through covers for four

"length ball, off stump, punched straight to point"
"backs away early but this time it works in his favour as it allows him the room to free his arms. Full ball, enough width outside off, slashes hard and carts it over the backward point fielder"

"short of a length, outside off, manages to jump and negotiate the bounce before patting it down into the off side"
"advances down the track and looks to swipe across the line, gets an inside edge into the toe. He didn't seem to be in great balance there. The head wasn't still"

"length ball, angling in, tries to tuck it fine but the ball goes off the pad instead"

Williams bowls smartly to take the pace off and darts it in very full on the stumps. Noor Ali is so far across there is really not much he can do about it. Tries to stick out the bat with his left hand and makes no contact as the ball crashes into the stumps"

"slower length ball, outside off, not picked by Stanikzai who swings early and gets beaten"

"full and on the stumps, Samuels drills it uppishly. Long-off lets it go through the legs after running to his right but luckily for him had long-on backing up. Still, it gives them an extra run"
