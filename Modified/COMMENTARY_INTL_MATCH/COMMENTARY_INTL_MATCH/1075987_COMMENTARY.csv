"starts on a full length, gets his natural away movement. Easily played into the off side, towards cover"
"a tad straighter, still full. Not much swing. Just a little bit of away seam movement, outside-edged down to third man"
"nice stroke. A tad short this time, short and wide. Scythed down to third man for a run. Played that late"
""
"good stuff. Full again, in a good channel just outside off, carved down to third man with an angled bat"
"straying down leg, rapped on the pad. Full delivery on Shafiq's pads, he fails to make contact. An optimistic appeal is quickly aborted"
"a bit of a whirry action. Full and straight to start, defended towards mid-off"
"strays down leg this time, wide."
"on the pads again, Shehzad misses a flick. Off the pad towards square leg"
"too straight yet again, worked away through square leg for one"
"lovely line, but well played too. Full and straight, prodded away towards cover for a quick run"
"goes over mid-on this time. Again, full. Again, straight. Predictable. Shafiq goes up and over mid-on. Easy"
"looks to go over again, fails to time it. Full outside off. Shafiq mis-times his drive to mid-off"
"nice line, nagging away around off, blocked"
"good length around middle, jabbed to midwicket for a couple. But is he quick enough? Shafiq needed a full-length dive and that saved him. Kept the bat face pointing up. Good effort from Shafiq."
"given! A bouncer down leg, Shehzad tries to get outside the line and help the ball down to fine leg. But can't get bat on his stroke, just glove. A simple catch for the keeper and Lahore strike! Beaten by some extra bounce"
"comes down to Tanvir and flamingo-flicks him through midwicket for a couple. Proactive stuff from KP. Lovely shot, great timing"
"big appeal. On the pads, KP misses a flick, the ball ricochets towards short fine leg. Pitched way outside leg"
"full and wide outside off, slapped away with bad timing to cover."
"the carrom ball to start. Full outside off, KP looks to turn the ball through midwicket, but gets a leading edge to cover"
"short and wide this time, slashed to extra cover"
"a touch straighter and fuller, Pietersen nails his sweep to deep backward square leg"
"a slog sweep! Tossed up on off, Shafiq gets low and pounces all over his sweep. Just beats midwicket, the fielder at the boundary makes a mess of his dive"
"gives himself room this time, full and straight, hit away to mid-off. Bad timing"
gets waaay outside off stump and misses his sweep. The bowling team inexplicably goes up in appeal. No run
"nicely played. Full delivery outside off, hit up to mid-off with great timing. Doesn't find the gap"
inside-edged into the stumps. A massive wicket. Pietersen runs at the bowler and wipes his bat through the line. There is a bit of inward seam movement though and the ball takes the inside edge and whacks leg stump. One of the Gladiators' best batsman.
"good length outside off, pushed away towards cover from the crease"
"just struggling with timing are these batsmen. There is some natural movement too. Full on off and middle, swiped to midwicket"
"full outside off, comes down again and drives hard to mid-off"
"lovely change in pace. A slower delivery on middle, Shafiq is way too early through his pull and is hit on the body. Clever bowling"
"flat and wide, driven away towards point"
"drops short on off, Rossouw goes back and slaps his pull to mid-on. A naughty fumble allows one"

"good length. Flat and straight, pushed back"
"a good single, push and run to cover"
"another nasty wipe across the line. Slow down leg, Shafiq gives himself room, Narine follows him. Beaten"
"shortish and wide, nailed to the deep sweeper cover fielder"
"runs down at the bowler. Good length on middle, Shafiq advances and mis-times a pull back to the bowler. Looking for muscle, not timing, not his strength"
"he'll get four this time. Not the greatest looking stroke. A slower bouncer outside off, Shafiq gets a top edge which flies in the gap at backward square leg"
"good length on off, hammered back to the bowler"
"no run there. What? Short and wide, pushed to short cover. Shafiq calls for one, puts his partner in jeopardy too. The fielder misses the stumps at the bowler's end. <b>Out by a distance if he hit</b>"
"bat goes over square leg. Waaaatch out! The third umpire is called for. The ball went somewhere towards midwicket. While everyone was looking at the bat, the batsmen complete two. The bat handle is in Rossouw's hand, the rest of his bat isn't. They have plenty of replacements these days. Rossouw's foot is inside the crease, plenty of replays."
that's better from Shafiq. Stick to his strengths. One of them is his touch. He gets low and reverse-paddles the ball down to the third man boundary. Fantastic
"the hard sweep this time, earns him one to deep square leg"
"tossed up outside off, drilled down to long-off"
"flat outside off, Shafiq runs down and flicks to deep square leg. One"
"another nice paddle reverse sweep. Flat on off, played with soft hands to short third man"
"short and wide, crashed straight to cover"

"nice slower delivery, good length on off. Mis-timed away towards point"
"a slower delivery that goes wrong. Strays down leg, wide"

"bad delivery. Short down leg, pulled down to fine leg for one. Lucky to get away with that"
"and gets a wicket with his first ball. Full and straight from Narine, Shafiq gets low, looks to paddle the ball down to fine leg. Fails to make any connection and the stumps light up. A struggling innings ends"
"poor ball, gets away with it. Short and wide from Narine, cut away but straight to backward point"
Rossouw shapes for a switch hit. Narine fires this way down leg. Rossouw never left . Wide
"shortish outside off, pushed away to cover"
"on the pads this time, length down leg, Rossouw misses a flick. Hit on the pad"
"a tad full this time, drilled down to long-off"
"huge wicket this. Sarfraz goes. Slow delivery outside off, it's short too. Sarfraz sees the length and decides to cut. The offbreak rips in, takes the inside edge and then clatters into the stumps. Poor shot selection. Excellent captaincy from McCullum to have Narine bowl one here."
Rossouw runs down and heaves one to deep midwicket. Not great timing
"well bowled. Pushed wide outside off, Nawaz leaves."
"on the pads, flicked down to short fine leg"
"nice. Slower through the air, straight, pushed back"
"runs down, Yasir fires the ball outside off, inside-edged into the pad"
"short again, wide. Hammered to cover. Another dot. Just two of the over. Good stuff."
"out? Direct hit and that should be No.5. On a length outside off, carved to point. The fielder picks up cleanly and throws the stumps down at the bowler's end. Fantastic fielding. Elliott got in front of the stumps, but let the ball hit the stumps. The Qalandars have been on point today"
"slower ball outside off, mis-timed back to the bowler"
driven away to deep cover for one
"another offcutter outside off, so slow. Inside-edged towards midwicket. Pace off ruling the contest"

"short and wide, crashed out to deep point"
"slow outside off, worked to deep midwicket nicely, just one though"
"darted in on off, the offbreak, defended"
"shortish and a tad too wide, drilled out to deep cover for one"
a reverse lap to short third man for a run
pushed down to long-off. End of a fantastic spell of T20 bowling. 4-0-16-2
"a low full toss, hit down to long-off for one"
that's a nice stroke. Too much width from Elliott. Rossouw gets low and hammers a lofted drive over cover. Superb timing
"a bouncer. Short delivery on off and middle, Rossouw feigned a lap sweep, then executed an upper cut over third man for some runs"
hit to the deep extra cover fielder for one
"four more. Getting a move along now. Length outside off, hammered past cover and that will be four"

"fired in on middle, pushed to long-on. 'Keeper's end,' yells Rizwan. The second isn't attempted"
"shortish delivery on middle, scythed away to deep point"
"fired waaay down leg, wide"
"taken. Bhatti takes the catch at long-off, a nonchalant attempt but doesn't matter if you take them. Yasir tossed that googly up, inviting a heave. Thisara can't stop himself, skews the ball off the outside half and an easy catch is accepted"
"flat delivery outside off, tapped to short third man"
nicely driven to long-off with the spin
"uh oh. Naughty fielding. Flat outside off, Rossouw gets a thick outside edge which races down past short third man. Irfan can't get his hand down the ball, concedes a couple extra runs"
"a length delivery on off, played down to third man for one"
"on a length outside off, dabbed down to third man"
another neat dab down to third man for a run

"slower ball on off, pushed down to mid-on"
"sees Rossouw coming, fires this on middle, pushed to long-on"
"good single, pushed to McCullum at cover and Rossouw sets off. Should not have been one there"
"flat on middle, a mis-timed reverse sweep to short third man"
"better from McCullum. Flat delivery outside off, hit to cover. No run"
comes down and gets enough on his drive to clear the fielder. Not quite to the pitch but he had enough to get the ball over the fielder at long-on. Nice clean stroke
"four more. Short and wide this time, scythed to deep point for four"
"huge! Short delivery on middle, Rossouw hammers his pull and it clears the fielder at midwicket. Fantastic batting"
hit nicely past cover for a couple more. Fifty for Rossouw. Fantastic rearguard effort this

"a slower ball on middle, Rossouw mis-times his heave to deep midwicket. Lovely change in pace"

"excellent over that. Just four off it. Slower ball outside off, jammed away to long-off for a run."
"how did he get that there? Looks for a lap sweep over short fine leg, gets the ball over the keeper for a couple."
swiped away through midwicket. Full and straight from Irfan. The fielder at long-on dives to his left and saves a couple. Good effort
"taken at long-on. End of an excellent innings that from Rossouw. Full on middle and off, right in the arc. Rossouw gets underneath it nicely, but gets more elevation than distance. Umar Akmal takes a well-judged catch at long-on"
"nice stuff. Full and straight, hammered to long-off for a couple. The fielder dives to his right to save a couple more"
"a yorker on off, squirted away to deep midwicket, just one more"
"a yorker on leg, Mills misses his slog and is struck right in front of leg stump. Given. Replays show the ball was missing leg stump."
"nice start, flat outside off, played towards point"
out goes the reverse sweep. Roy gets low and gets the ball to clear short third man. Clears the fielder comfortably

"another boundary. Good length on middle, Roy pulls, doesn't keep it down. Sits up for Roy to hammer through midwicket"
"whoa. <strong>Terrible communication from Roy</strong>. Good length on middle and leg, worked to square leg. Roy calls for one, realises there is no run, and sends McCullum back. Anwar Ali misses at the bowler's end. Hung him out to dry there did Roy."
"on a length outside off, defended"
"very slow, short. Roy slaps the ball in front of cover for four. Just too easy. Poor bowling that"
"just a tad short and McCullum is all over it. Pulls to deep square leg, picks out the sole man there"
"another boundary. Flat on off, Roy gets down and clears the fielder at short third man. Sweep ball-striking. One of his easier shots"
"flat on off, drilled to long-off"
"four more. McCullum runs down and swipes the ball over midwicket, on the bounce and over."
"slightly short on middle and leg, pulled to deep square leg for a run"
"bowled this time. Flat delivery on leg stump, Roy gets low, looks to paddle, but misses. The ball clips leg stump and the Gladiators have their first"
"hammered away for four more. On a length on middle, McCullum waits for the ball to come to him and then crashes a pull over midwicket"
that's the slower ball. McCullum runs down but is flummoxed by the change in pace. Rolls through to the keeper
"on a length on off, carved away towards third man"
worked down to fine leg
"a slower ball on off, McCullum let that come to him before carving one down to third man"
"well bowled. Puts extra oomph in this, gets the ball to slide through to the keeper. Beaten for pace"

"on a length outside off, carved away past point for a couple. Nicely played, let that come to him"
"on a length outside off, carved down to third man"

Rizwan comes down and defends. At least the intent to score is there
"leading edge just past cover. On a length on middle, a thick outside edge to long-off"
good single. Tip and run to point. Gets back and just pats this towards point
"beauty. Full delivery outside off, the ball beats the bat. Plenty of turn. Superb length, drew Rizwan forward"
what happened there? The umpire walks towards his partner to have a chat. Has it carried? Shehzad doesn't think he's taken it. A thick outside edge just lands in front of first slip. Lovely flight
"flat outside off, pushed to long-off"
"big appeal and given. Pad first, then bat. Flat delivery on middle, Rizwan plants his front foot forward, puts his pad in line with the ball. The slider goes on, hits the pad, then bat. Sir Viv Richards goes wild on the bench. Well bowled"
"flat and straight, blocked"
"shortish delivery outside off, carved out to deep point"

"flat delivery on middle, Elliott goes back and punches to long-off"
pushed back towards the bowler

"another slower ball, worked away to deep midwicket"
"slower yorker outside off, jammed out"
worked away through midwicket
"full and straight, played away to long-off awkwardly. Good over from Perera"

"comes down the track, driven to long-on"
"flat down leg, clipped away to square leg, another single"

"another slower delivery, straight. Narine misses his slog again. Did that pitch outside leg? Yes says the umpire"
a thick outside edge and it races away past short third man. Pace off the ball. Lucky for Elliott
"another one. What are the odds? Slower delivery outside off, Elliott looks for the same stroke, to go over cover, the ball takes the outside edge and evades a diving Sarfraz to his right"
"off the middle this time, but one to long-off"
"slower ball outside off, trickles away to the keeper. No pace at all"
"some pace there. A quick bouncer on leg, Elliott lets this one go"
"a bouncer on leg, pulled to deep midwicket"

"a wild swing, completely beaten, excellent slower delivery"
"another bouncer on off, wide given. Over the head. Sarfraz was not happy"

driven to long-off with the spin
"fired outside off, Narine doesn't care, clears his front leg and heaves the ball way over long-on. Six more. What an innings he has played"
"full and wide, inside the tramline. Bhatti misses his drive"
"how is that? A direct hit at the bowler's end. it's either a wicket or two runs. A length delivery from Mills, tapped to cover. The fielder picks up, turns around and effects a direct hit at the bowler's end. Bhatti is short by a few inches. Fantastic fielding. How crucial will that be?"
"gone! Quetta have the wicket they need. What bowling from Mills. Doesn't bother with the slower delivery, goes full and straight. Just a touch short than a full length. Narine is rooted in the crease and the ball pins him right in front. On this surface, bounce is hardly going to be a factor. Given."
"just wide of slip. Full outside off, a thick outside edge. Splendid captaincy from Sarfraz, he has third man so fine for the No. 11"
"good length outside off, blocked to cover"
"uh oh. Full and wide, Yasir looks to go over mid-off. No contact. Suddenly, run rate is a factor too"
"short on off, pulled to long-on"
shouldn't be a run there. Worked down to short fine leg for a quick single. Is there a direct hit? Irfan took his time to get across but got there eventually
driven decently to long-off. Another single.
"straight up and Hasan takes a juggled catch. The Quetta Gladiators <b>complete a stunning turnaround victory</b>. A touch short from Hasan, yasir goes back and looks to pull but gets a thick leading edge, goes straight up and Hasan settles underneath it."
