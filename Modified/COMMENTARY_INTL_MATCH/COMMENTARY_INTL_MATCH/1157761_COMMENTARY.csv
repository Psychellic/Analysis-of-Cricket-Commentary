"length on leg stump, deflected to square leg with the angle"
"<b>drilled straight to mid-off!</b> Rohit upset with himself. This was a slower ball that he's picked and it's landing at a leg stump line and is overpitched. It's there for a pasting, but he's managed to go neither above mid-off, nor to his left. It's hit hard, but Brathwaite does well to hold a stable base and take it with the reverse cup"
"length at leg stump, walks down and jabs towards mid-on"
another slower ball that isn't going to be known for its covertness. Nicely lobbed at middle stump and he slogs to find deep square at the fence

<b>sliced over extra cover.</b> This is very short and very slow and he's almost moved too soon into the leg side. Reaching out in the end and has to generate a lot of strength from his core. But that is the advantage of the Powerplay. You only have to clear the field. This runs away
"full on middle stump, drilled back to the bowler"
<b>massive turn.</b> That's come out of nowhere! Short of a length and in at middle stump. Rahul looking to play it with the angle and turn it into the leg side. Is made to look like a tailender as it rips away. No way anyone was getting bat on that
"full on middle stump, shuffles and flicks to deep square"
short ball pushed well down leg side. Left alone
"<b>got him!</b> Rahul wants to smoke this over mid-off, but he hasn't come close to the pitch of it. There's a small deviation away from a length outside off and that is enough. The head and the foot were well inside the line of the ball, the hands flailing far away"

slower ball lobbed up at off stump. He taps it with soft hands into the newly vacated extra cover region. It's his own doing. Allows him the second
offcutter at a length on off stump. Taps to deep extra

"length at leg stump, gets forward and turns it to short fine"
"length on middle stump, mistimed heave to deep midwicket"
"short at middle stump, pulled to deep square"

"length ball outside off, looks for the reverse sweep and misses"
"flat and full outside off,  drilled straight to long-off"
full and just outside off. Driven to long-on with a closed face
<b>whipped</b> between deep square and deep midwicket. Impeccable placement again. Overpitched and on the toes. He makes sure to swivel and place his exactly where he wants

"length outside off, steps out and drives straight to extra cover"
"full toss on leg stump, flicked uppishly between deep square and deep midwicket"
<b>falls short of Pierre</b> and it bounces over the fine leg boundary. That's a good shot option. A length ball on leg and he just bends down and ramps this. It lobs high to Pierre's left and he sprints and lunges at it. Won't get there. <b>That is a maiden fifty</b> for Pant
"yorker at leg stump, can't get bat on the attempted flick. Deflects into the leg side"

"full and wide outside off, driven on the bounce to extra cover"
"<b>slips</b> out of the hand and it ends up a full toss at stomach height. Pant looks to swing it over the boundary at square leg, but he's lost his bearings. It runs to fine leg's right"
attempted yorker is a full toss down leg side. Looks to paddle this but can't connect
"yorker at off stump. Clears the leg and swings for it, but he can only get it out to long-off"
another full toss that he can't get a hold of. Drags it to deep midwicket's left with a slog off the inside half
"<b>oh that's harsh from the umpire.</b> Pant walks down the pitch and skips away from this yorker headed for his heels. It goes by leg stump, where Pant was originally standing. Brathwaite not impressed with the wide call. He has a case."
"length down leg side, follows the batsman who shovels this into the leg side"
"length at middle stump, runs it to short third man off the outside half"

yorker at the toes. Clipped along the floor to deep square
"full and wide outside off, controlled drive to sweeper's left"
"<b>smashes middle stump.</b> Pant wants to open the face and ramp this through the gully region. Gets the front leg well out of the way and pokes at it with the face open. The physics just won't work on that. It's a yorker aimed in at middle stump from around the wicket. But it's been that kind of innings, and it has been rewarding for him."

"length at off stump, dipping sharply as he opens the face and slices this past point"
"<b>straight to square leg.</b> Length ball flat at a length, runs down the track and flicks straight to the fielder"
"<b>clubs it straight to long-on!</b> Oh dear! How has it come to this? Length ball lobbed up outside off. Steps out and pummels this, flat and straight to Pollard who is ten yards in from the rope. What an innings from Dhawan, but will this shot end up haunting him?"
"<b>misfield from the bowler!</b> And they run through! Oh Fabian Allen nearly had it. The best fielder in the West Indies side can't quite wrap his hands around this. Length ball at leg stump, Pandey taps gently towards mid-on and Allen does superbly to lunge and get across to his right. DK has long begun running and is halfway down the pitch as Allen gets a hand on it. But he only parries it past midwicket, who is running in towards him and therefore won't be around to cover. Allen is devastated, his team-mates console him."
