"back of a length on the pads, tucked to the leg side as Gayle accepts the sighter"
"thumps the pads this time, jagging from a leg-stump line, cramping Gayle for room"
"<strong>that is a beauty!</strong> Bangs out the perfect line and length, perfect seam position, and zings past the edge as Gayle props forward!"
"driven with intent, a pleasing report of willow, but a fast-travelling ball is half-stopped at mid-off. Gayle isn't interested in the single"
"<strong>another snorter!</strong> And it's swing that beats Gayle this time, wobbling past the edge from an off-stump line. Gayle doesn't chase it, to his credit"
"a maiden to open proceedings, as Gayle raises his bat out of harm's way. Tidy work"
"back of a length, down the leg side, a bit of a loosener as Lewis swings into a pull but can't connect"
"<strong>zippy pace!</strong> Better line, back of a length, and leaping past the edge on a fourth-stump line as Lewis drops his hands"
solidly forward on middle and off. Archer finds a fuller line and length this time
"the first run off the bat, uneasily fenced to the leg side as Lewis rises with a rib-targeting delivery and deflects it into space"
"through to the keeper, late swing as Gayle leaves alone"
<B>strewth!</B> That had some heat! Gayle flinches inside the line as Archer bangs one in and it really takes off through to the keeper
"outside off on a tighter, fuller length. No stroke offered. This has been a very impressive start from England, but West Indies are playing it cool. They can make hay when they are settled"
"crunched with intent and a high followthrough into the covers, a touch of width but can't cash in"
"stabbed to mid-off, and Gayle lumbers into a quick single... the fielder was hanging back, tempting him to go for it, and he just about made it in good time"
"through to the keeper once again. 137kph on that occasion from Woakes, or 85mph if you can't do the maths"
ploughing through on a tight line with a hint of movement away from the left-hander. Left alone again
"a cramped drive into the covers, striking it on the up but straight to the fielder"
"<B>yorker!</B> That is tremendous bowling from Woakes, just slipping in the fuller ball, rattling through Lewis's defences as his weight toppled forward in anticipation of another drive. No issue with the zing bails on that occasion, England are up and running!"
"beaten again, outside off, as Archer clocks 91mph on that occasion. Tight line to off stump"
another leave-alone as Archer ploughs a pacy furrow outside Gayle's off stump with seam and bounce to the fore
"on the stumps this time, 90mph once more. Gayle blocks with a full face of the bat, slightly leg-sided in his stance"
"<B>another fizzing bouncer!</B> Was fractionally leg-sided but crucially, straight at Gayle's lid! Signalled as the one for the over as the batsman flinches inside the line. 91mph on that occasion"
"outside off, more serious heat outside off"
"<B>Gayle flings the bat this time, and so nearly chops on!</B> Fractionally shorter, so out came the pull, but he was so cramped in the shot, an under-edge zips over the bails, and away to the unguarded fine leg!"
left alone calmly to accept the first-ball sighter
"solidly forward, bat on ball to midwicket"
"in the channel outside off, another leave-alone as this one seams towards the cordon"
"reaching for the drive, not quite there. Scuffed off the toe, back to the bowler"
"tight line once more, angling in towards the off stump as Hope shoulders arms."
"this is superb, constraining new-ball bowling. Test-match lines and lengths, and demanding Test-match concentration as Hope leaves again"
"<B>stand and deliver!</B> Gayle has had enough sighters, this one is a full length, so the flat-footed Gayle woofs a slog through the line, and Archer has to skip his toes out of harm's way as the missile sails through long-on!"
"<B>bang! There goes another!</B> To hell with all of this, says Gayle, as he mows a back-of-a-length delivery through deep midwicket!"
"Archer responds with a leg-stump lifter, a good option when those levers starts swinging. Cramped for room and jabbed down into the leg side"
"<B>sizzling delivery!</B> Tight line, back of a length, a hint of nibble off the deck as Hope plays the off-stump line and is grateful to get away with no nick to the keeper"
"soft hands this time, down into the cordon. Well played"
"<B>fierce!</B> An 89mph bouncer, into the armpit, as Gayle is tucked up on that leg-stump line once more and is forced to take late evasive action. Finds the single nevertheless"
"a sliced hack down to third man ... but <B>Wood can't gather with a desperate stretch!</B> He made such good ground, and seemed to have it for a split-second, but his tangle of limbs allowed the ball to squeeze out. He was perhaps late to sight that shot..."
"forward, and pressed into the covers"
edged ... <strong>but on the bounce to second slip</strong>... this is getting lively!
"lovely strike, excellent stop! A full, firm face of the bat, straight back down the pitch, but Woakes leaps to his right to pounce on the ball"
"back of a length on a wider line, no temptation to have a hack there"
fired down the leg side as Hope can't connect with his clip off the toes
"tight wicket-to-wicket line, 83mph this time, so Woakes is clicking along nicely. Solid defence"
"<B>slapped with vigour through the leg side!</B> Gayle is flexing his muscles now ... climbing into anything back of a length, and finds the gap"
"<B>slashed hard over point!</B> Doesn't connect properly, but the intent is plain. Plugs in no-man's land as they turn for the second with the cover ring giving chase ... talking of which, <B>Jason Roy has pulled up lame!</B>"
"short and sharp, Hope flings his gloves at the ball in self-defence"
"chipped in the air for a moment, but safely to mid-on"
"short again, sharp again. Defended"
hops back and across with an open face to push to cover
"short and wide, there for the slap through the covers but can't connect properly. Thinks of the single but thinks better of it"
"<B>tonk!</B> Have some of that, just a fraction of room to unleash the levers, and Woakes is panned over long-on!"
"<B>smoked into the stands!</B> Oh boy, this is getting tasty now! A pre-meditated march down the track, anticipating the fuller length, and crunched over the bowler's head!"
flicked off the pads to square leg
"<B>squared up and gully would have swallowed that!</B> Instead it flies safe to third man. Hope is having a torrid time, but so long as he loiters while Gayle struts his stuff..."
"full, straight, judiciously blocked as Gayle leans down into the crease"
"back of a length, prodded back down the pitch. 92mph on that occasion"
"driven with intent, but off an inside-edge and gathered at mid-on"
"slower ball, Hope waits well, flicks his wrists and accepts the single to third man"
"on the toes, tucked to midwicket, and Gayle takes the quick single as Archer waves his arms in mild frustration, I think he thought the fielder could have been onto that quicker"
"a flick off the toes, raps the pad, looking for another single but not this time"
"<B>furious pace!</B> A 92mph lifter, not even a bouncer, but Hope knew nothing of it as it leapt off the cross-seam, and pounded his gloves while he was turning turtle! It's lively out there"
"a big wind-up, attempted slap from outside off, but can't time the stroke"
"fuller length, open-face and angled to third man. The slips have scattered now, with the Powerplay over"
"slower ball, down the leg side, Gayle was beaten but on the wrong line"
"full and straight, Gayle plays with circumspection from deep in the crease, out to the leg side"
"<B>a crunching drive, but Morgan swoops well!</B> That's a vital stop, Hope's best shot of the day bar none, but a dive to his left stops the boundary"
fenced through third man once more
"short and eased out to the leg side, Gayle chooses discretion on this occasion and picks off the single to midwicket"
"full length, outside off, through to the keeper. An 86mph sighter"
"swing from back of a length, Gayle shoulders arms as Wood takes a tumble in his followthrough"
"pinged through to the keeper once more, Gayle takes another look as the ball angles across his bows at 87mph"
"full and straight, blocked down into the deck as Gayle continues to show restraint against the new bowler"
"fended with discipline into the covers, leg-stump line, cramping Gayle for room"
opens the face for a fiddle through to third man. Point dives but can't intercept as Rashid tidies up
"opens the stance in anticipation of a wipe over the leg side, but ends up fencing to point for the single"
"<B>edged and so close to Buttler's glove!</B> No slips, no chance! Hope accepts his first boundary of a torrid stay..."
"zipping through to the keeper, outside off"
"dragged to mid-on from way outside off stump, a solid connection though, to bring up the fifty stand"
"slower-ball bouncer, Gayle ducks, as the ball hops obediently over his head, like a scottie dog doing a trick at Crufts"
nudged off the legs. Gayle has been somewhat becalmed in the last few overs. Something has to give surely...
"<B>there he goes!</B> Takes on the short ball, but it's a long old boundary, even for Gayle! Bairstow has a long, long time to consider his life choices as the ball plops into his hands, and that is a very, very big wicket..."
"leaning forward, pressed into the covers to get off the mark straightaway"
"<B>massive appeal!</B> Wood thinks that's stone-dead! No response from umpire Dharmasena, but <B>England review</B>. It was angling in on a very full length. If there was no inside edge that's going to be close. Hope was playing round his front pad, and yep, <B>that is smashing leg stump!</B> A fine review from England and a sudden flurry of wickets. Hope's torturous innings is ended, just when he might have been getting settled."

"length ball, across him and he slaps it hard, but can only get it down to mid on"

"fuller ball, outside off, and he makes some room for himself, and tries to smash this down towards long on. Gets it off the inside of the bat, and seems to have done some damage to his blade. Replacement is being shuttled out"

"angles across him, and again he looks to go on side, but can only find short midwicket"
"length ball, and he drives it back towards the bowler"

"fuller ball, at the pads, and he looks to down the ground but can only drive it to mid on"
"short, and he goes for the pull, and just about clears midwicket. Didn't get it off the middle, and the England strategy of bowling across him, and a bit short seems to be frustrating him"
"length, and he stays back and swings this towards deep backward square leg. A good shot, but will only get a single for his efforts"
"bangs it in short, and he looks to pull this away. Gets a fine edge and it runs away to the fine leg fence"

controlled flick to one on his pads down towards fine leg. Some hard running fetches them two
defends a length ball on the pads towards short midwicket
presses forward to defend a length ball
"goes back to cut this towards point. There's a little celebratory squeal. <strong>What's happened here?</strong> It's actually Buttler's gloves which have displaced the bails. The umpires come together, and they seem happy to leave it as a dot ball"

"<strong>there's the breakthrough!</strong> Joe Root was brought on for this express purpose, and he plucks the return catch as Hetmyer miscues a simple drive down the ground. The ball may have gripped a bit, but it just popped straight back up towards the non-striker, and Root gleefully accepts this, and celebrates like Botham did with his little jig in 1992. <b>The partnership comes to an end 11 short of getting to three figures!</b>"

"<strong>two for Root!</strong> Stops on Holder this time, and he was looking for turn on this one. Didn't turn at all, in fact Root may have bowled this seam-up, and it pops back up for Root. He's the top wicket-taker in this innings already"
"clipped down the ground to long-on, and up comes Pooran's fifty. A fine knock so far, but he needs to go on with Windies on the ropes all of a sudden ..."
"<B>jeepers, steady on!</B> Tossed out wide, Dre's eyes are like saucers as he climbs into the slog, and <B>so nearly inside-edges onto his stumps!</B>"

"width outside off, but not a lot of it, dancing at the crease in a bid to nail his cut shot"

Root burgles another superbly economical over as Pooran dabs back down the pitch. This is quite the mini-spell!

"<B>banged in short, Russell takes the bait, Woakes takes the catch!</B> It was travelling, but straight to the man at deep midwicket, and the culpable fielder a few moments ago shows good ticker to swallow the second opportunity"

drags the length back by half a yard and hits the middle of the bat hard as Pooran leans forward to defend
"bouncer, well directed. Pooran ducks as Buttler gathers with a hop to the leg side"

"<strong>short and sharp!</strong> Is there any glove on this as Pooran withdraws his bat late? England reckon so, and are <B>reviewing!</B> Buttler is in temporary chance and makes the call ...<B>and it's the correct call!</B> A clear spike on Snicko, and England have the big one! The angle into the left-hander was key, as the ball kept chasing Pooran as it climbed off the deck"
"walks across the stumps, and <strong>Archer is on a hat-trick!</strong>  Cottrell reviews, as well he might. It was angling towards the leg side, and umpire Dharmasena took an age to decide... but <B>that is smashing leg, and the wicket stands!</B>"
"full and straight from round the wicket to the left-hander, Fended away with enough bat outside off stump. But that's a telling over all the same..."

"head over the ball, sturdy block back down the track"
worked off the legs as Rashid loops up the googly

leaning forward to block the round-the-wicket line with another full face of the bat
"short and sharp<strong>, another massive appeal for caught behind!</strong> England <B>review again</B>. Carbon copy of the Pooran dismissal, except on this occasion, the gloves are safely out of harm's way. <B>Review lost!</B>"

"slower ball, cunningly bowled, tweaks into the hips"

"round the wicket, attacking the stumps, an open-faced stab to point"

<B>lines up the pull but that's through him like a rapier!</B>
"banged in short, attempted swing through the leg side, again no contact"
"<B>swished once more, a clear noise, and Buttler gathers!</B> Brathwaite is crestfallen, that's come off his arm not the bat, but <B>he has no review left and has to walk!</B> ... EDIT: There was a thin edge before the arm, so justice has been done either way!"

"deflects off a wild swipe, down to third man"

"short, and a bit wide again, and he has a dab at it. Goes off the toe of the bat towards point"

"short, and he defends from the crease"

"short, angles into him and he plays this to point"
"short, and he cuts this towards point"
"short, and he plays it towards point with soft hands again"
"dug in short, angles across him, he looks for the pull but misses. Good take behind the stumps"
"full, and he drives this straight back past the bowler. Ramrod straight, down to long on. <strong>Super shot!</strong>"
"fuller, and jags into him a bit. He skews a drive towards the on side, but picks up a single to the right of short midwicket"
"back of a length, and he defends it towards point"
"full, and he launches into an <strong>absolutely gorgeous extra cover drive</strong>. Root, you beauty!"
"short, and he pulls this off the toe-end of the bat towards mid on"
"short, and he guides this down to third man"
"starts with a half-tracker, and Root swings this around on the on side. Short fine leg does a decent job of getting some hand to it"
"short, jags into him and he defends"
"short, and he leans back and creates some room to create space for the cut. Gets two towards Oshane Thomas at third man. <strong>Great running!</strong>"
"length, angles into him, and he defends"
"banged in short, and he tries to swing this over towards long leg. Gets it off the inside of the bat, on to his grille and down towards the keeper"
"dug in short again, and he bails out of an attempted pull. Called a wide for height"
plays a length ball outside off towards covers and picks up a quick single
"welcomed to the crease by a <strong>picture-perfect square drive</strong> by Root. Full, outside off, and he leans into it. Shades of the game's greats in that shot!"
"full, a bit wide, and he squirts this away towards third man. Oshane Thomas gets to the ball after a long chase, but cannot prevent the third"
"short, and quick (<strong>135kph</strong>), angles into him, and he wears this on his body after dropping his wrists"
"short, and quick again, and he ducks under this one"
"fuller, and he drives this towards mid on"
"short again, and he lets this pass as it angles in towards him"
"length, jags into him, and he defends this"
"short, and he has swung this around to the on side. Not quite off the middle, but he has placed it well. Trickles into the deep backward square leg fence"
"short, and he plays this towards point"
"looks to go fuller, but sprays it down the leg side"
"fuller, and he flicks this away as it angles into him. Cannot beat short midwicket"
angles into him and he tucks it off his hips towards deep backward square leg
"looks to go full again, but again goes too far down the leg side. Hope takes it well down the leg side, but they will have to bowl this again"
"short, and he swings this down towards long leg. A little roll of the wrists to keep it down"
"short, angles into him, and he fails to get any bat as he tries to play this towards fine leg"
"short, and he defends it as it cuts in from outside off"
"short, and he plays this down the wicket off the back foot"
"fuller, and it keeps a bit low as he looks to swing this through midwicket. No contact with the ball, and it <strong>doesn't miss the off stump by much</strong>"
"fuller ball, on the pads, and he can walk across and whip this away towards deep square leg"
"shapes back in after pitching on a length. <strong>Strikes him on the pad, but may have taken the inside edge</strong>. Stifled appeal from Holder"
starts by going down the leg side
"short, just outside off, and he lets it pass"
"length, outside off, and Bairstow guides this over where second slip might have been. <strong>Cheeky!</strong>"
"short, and he looks to play the upper cut, but doesn't get any bat on it as it passes through to Hope"
"short, and he hooks this away towards deep backward square leg"
"short, and he runs this down towards long leg with a roll of the wrists"
"short, and chases him as he looks to duck out of the way. <strong>Both batsmen and bowler are rocked by that!</strong> Bairstow takes his helmet off to assess any damage as it strikes him, while that was too much effort for Russell's wobbly knees. Goes down on the pitch and takes a while to get back up"
"length, and he presses forward to play this towards covers"
"fuller, down the leg side, and he tries to flick this. Gets it off the pads and they can sneak in a leg-bye"
"length, but drifts down the pads, and he can work this off his pads towards long leg. Played with soft hands, and they pick up two quite comfortably"
"down the leg side, and he can get enough bat to run it down to fine leg. <strong>Easy!</strong>"
"short, and this time it's a bit luckier for Bairstow. He was looking to bail out of a pull shot, but got enough of the bat to run it off the edge down to fine leg"
"fuller, straight at the stumps, and he defends"
"short, and he goes back and works this off his pads towards deep backward square leg"
"length, and he defends from the crease"
"length, angles into him, and he plays it towards covers"
"short, and down the leg side, and he lets this pass"
"length, and he goes back to whip this off his pads towards deep backward square leg"

"short, angles into him, and he plays it towards mid on"
"short again, and he plays it towards point"
"length, and he hangs back and works it to the right of mid on. Picks up an easy single"
"length, and he swings this away on the on side, but cannot beat short midwicket"
"down the leg side, and called a wide"
"short, and he goes back and plays this towards long leg"
"short, and he swings this around towards long leg. Some running around to do, and that enables them to come back for a second"
"dug in short, and he gets enough time to swing this round towards long leg. Some work for the fielder to do, and they hare through for two again!"
"short, and he has to reload this one. Bairstow lets this pass"
skews a drive towards mid on
"just a bit short of a length, and he makes some room for himself and slaps this hard towards midwicket. Pre-empted the length, and <strong>responded perfectly</strong>!"
"<strong>short, and he holes out to third man!</strong> it takes a long time in coming, but West Indies finally are able to pick up a wicket with the short ball. Dug in short, and wide, and Bairstow goes for the upper cut, but cannot clear the fence. Carlos Brathwaite doesn't have to move much to take this"
"pushed onto the back foot, blocked down into the crease"
"short and swished across the line, but that's too short for the umpire's liking"
"<B>drilled back past the bowler!</B> In the air for a while but wide of Gabriel in his followthrough. In fact, that was closer to him than it seemed. Never moved his palms in time"
cracked on the up and <B>Gayle gets the biggest cheer of the day</B> for a diving stop at point!
flicked off the pads through backward square leg
clonked into the covers with a full face of the bat
"up on the toes, right behind the line, and poked to the off side"
"full face, pumped into the covers"
"up on the toes, patted out to point"
"<strong>that's poetry from Root</strong> ... an ode to a summer's day, dreamily creamed through the covers off the front foot. If the sun won't shine, that will have to do!"
standing tall on the back foot and poked into the covers
"outside off, and poked down through third man"
"too short, and <B>punished through deep midwicket!</B> Woakes is camped on the back foot, fully anticipating the length of attack, and duly clobbered!"
"short, Woakes has a waft in an attempt at a ramp-cum-uppercut, but can't get close"
"quick again from Gabriel, whistling through an attempted pull at 88mph.  But some sizeable dents in the requirement in that over"
"outside off, lifting off the deck and defended on the back foot"
"opens the face, guides down to third man"
"leaning forward, head over the ball with an open face, steered into the off side"
hopping onto the back foot to defend round the corner
"pulled out to deep midwicket, <B>heart in mouth for a moment </B>with the fielder circling, but it lands safe"
"tucked off the toes, <B>up comes Root's fifty</B>, a run a ball, and thoroughly effortless"
"<B>timing to the fore once more!</B> Root leans on a half-volley outside off, and another cherry-picked four ensues through long-off"
firmly into line on a better length this time
"solid once more, and defended back down the pitch"
"short again, hauled round the corner with a roll of the wrists. Another couple to the cause"
"on cruise control now from Root ... another full-faced push through long-off, a sprawling effort from Bravo to claw in the ball but <strong>his foot was touching the rope</strong>. Nothing going West Indies' way!"
"dipping into the toes, more ironic cheers as Gayle stoops to conquer at midwicket"
"outside off, too much width, <strong>whisked through point with a flick of the wrists!</strong>"
"hops into line, can't beat the sprawling fielder at point"
nudged down to third man
"opens the face to run the single down to third man, and they rush back for the second"
swinging into a controlled pull through the on-side. Easy peasy
"short again, brainless bowling, really. Root is camped on the back foot, <strong>crunches through a pull</strong> and deep midwicket has no chance!"
"dobbed onto a good length outside off, and worked with an open face to point. Gayle still bowling in his aviators, because ... he can"
nurdled to the leg side
"back of a length, <B>popped in the air but too straight for midwicket!</B> A deep-set mid-on gathers"
"ooh, cheeky ... wicket-to-wicket line, Root rocks back and can't quite nurdle it away, an ambitious appeal for lbw"
walking across his stumps again for the nudge to leg
"down on one knee, sweeping way outside leg ... Root can't beat fine leg, and Gayle acknowledges his tidy over with a salute! Root titters, as well he might..."
nurdled to the leg side
walking across his stumps to block into the off side
"short, leg-sided, <B>honked out through backward square!</B> Some spurious fielding on the boundary's edge, but it was all the delivery deserved, frankly"
"short again, pulled with a touch of the hurry-ups out to midwicket"
"up on one leg, in a Lara-lite whipped pull behind square. Not really timed, not left-handed, so there the comparison dies"
"rising to meet the back of a length, and pushed into the covers"
"flicked from a leg-stump line to midwicket, Gayle's non-turning dobbers have often proven tough to get away ..."
"defended once again, a constrictive line"
tucked to midwicket
"sweeping, but misses out as the ball slides past the leg stump"
defended to mid-on
"on the legs, this is tidy and tedious stuff from Gayle, which is exactly what West Indies need. Bore England into a breakthrough!"
half an appeal as Root is rapped on the pads on a leg-stump line. Nothing doing
clipped to midwicket once more
"nudged off the pads to the leg side, there's not a whole lot of jeopardy out there right now..."
"too short, a cross-batted thump to the midwicket sweeper"
bobbling past the leg stump as Woakes misses with a flick
"short, pulled, gathered in the deep"
"flicked from the back foot to mid-on, this is tidy but unthreatening"
"up on the toes, and chopped down to third man"
defended into the off side
"<B>humongous appeal, and that's got to be close!</B> Woakes just planted his front foot on an off-stump line, but Gayle - in cap and shades - got one to turn sharply! Outside the line is the only thing saving him! and sure enough,<strong> Kumar got that one spot on</strong>"
"sharper delivery, banged into the deck and nipping like a seamer. Woakes watches well to defend"
fired past the leg stump
"walking out of the crease, eased down to long on"
sliding back into the crease to push another single to long-on
"tossed up, and clipped to wide long-on"
"full length, and punched down the ground"
"slow bouncer, Woakes stays in line and eases a pull through backward square"
"nurdled to fine leg, another one ticked off"
another whistling pull out to the midwicket sweeper
"wide on the crease, angled into the pads, clipped to square leg"
"flogged out to deep midwicket, Fabian Allen slides round impressively to cut off the four, then signals to the crowd to make some noize. He's enjoying his day in the field, even if some of his team-mates are less enthused"
worked to the leg side
"full face of the bat, advancing to another length dobber. Eased to mid-on"
"sliding down the leg side, and hoisted with a lofted sweep behind square"
"another sweep from outside leg, gathered behind square"
"back and across, pressed down to long on"
"into line once more, defended back down the track"
"line, length, block. Dot"
"angled into the toes, clipped with the inswing behind square"
"thumped to deep midwicket, where Fabian Allen has clearly been making friends! A huge cheer as he pulls off a regulation stop"
"opens the face, guided to third man"
"deep in the crease, waiting for the ball to reach the bat, and angled out to point"
"<strong>short, pulled, four</strong>. It's a rinse-and-repeat line of attack today. Anything back of a length has travelled"
"rocks back for a chop through the covers, and that is <B>pure timing and placement!</B> Looked like nothing more than a calm single, but it just kept running away from the fielder"
worked to the leg side
"tightens up on off stump, and blocked"
"worked to long-on, another single to the cause"
"leaning back in the crease, dabbed into the on side"
"on the back foot, and blocked down the ground"
back and across to tap into the leg side
"sweetly struck! Very full from Gabriel, so out comes a perfectly full face, placing the ball back past the bowler to move into the 90s"
"<B>straight through him!</B> Didn't seem an untoward delivery, but Woakes was looking for the open-faced glide to third man and the ball seamed back through the gate"
"cramped for room on the back foot, valiant aggression, if a touch late in the day. Dabbed down into the crease, and vague thoughts of a single"
"a flat-batted thwack, back at the bowler, who flicks the ball at the non-striker's bails with Root safely in his crease"
"short and sharp, Woakes flinches and the ball zips over his head"
"oh look, a fuller ball. Straight, and he drives it back to the bowler"
"fuller, on the pads, and he chips it away towards deep backward square leg"
"down the leg side, will have to re-bowl this"
"width outside off, and he fails to get a drive going"
"fuller, and he drives it to covers"
"short, and called a wide as it keeps rising past Woakes. Direction was fine, the length was <em>too short!</em>"
"shorter ball, and he plays it on to his pads in trying to run it down to third man. Drops harmlessly near point"
"short again, and he ducks underneath this. Everybody expects a wide, but none called"
"full, on the pads, and he flicks this away towards short midwicket"
"just a tad short, and he goes back and punches this through the gap between cover and point"
"short, down the leg side, and he looks to swing this away to fine leg. Half-appeal from Gabriel, but called a wide. They have lost their review too, remember..."
"full, and he lays into another square drive. Won't go to the fence, but brings himself <strong>within three of his third World Cup century</strong>"
"short, and he has whipped this away towards deep midwicket"
"dug in short, and he <strong>holes out to long leg</strong>! Woakes couldn't help himself as that was pitched short and asked for the pull. Top edge carries it just a little short of long leg, and substitute fielder Fabian Allen running in takes a good, low catch!"
"down the leg side, and called wide as Stokes walks across and tries to glance this down to fine leg but misses out"
"short, and wide again, and Stokes leaves this. Was pretty close to a 15th wide, surely..."
"short, and he has swung this away to the right of long leg. Wanted a second, but the return was fired in fast..."
"length, and he plays it away towards point"
"short, and he swings this down to fine leg to bring <strong>Root back on strike</strong>"
"short, fittingly so, and he runs this down towards fine leg. Hundred for Joe Root, and he takes his helmet off and flashes a satisfied grin as he soaks in the applause. <b>Hundreds in World Cups against Sri Lanka, Pakistan and now West Indies. 16th overall</b>"
"length, played away towards the on side"
"short, and he goes back and plays this towards square leg"
"short, and he forces this off the front foot, past mid off. <strong>Pretty amazing shot, when you consider where he placed this one!</strong>"
"fuller ball, and he has whipped this through midwicket to seal the win. <b>Root and Stokes give each other a hug, as they should</b>. This has been an overall professional performance from the hosts, and that has certainly lifted the gloom from all the washouts over the last week or so at this World Cup!"
