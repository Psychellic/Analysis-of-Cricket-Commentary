"Ishant galllps in, pitches slightly full on off and Rahul steps out to whip to midwicket, quickly on the move for a single"
"stays over the wicket, angled towards slip and Gayle dabs it down in front of point and ambles the one"
"touch shorter, 135kph over off stump, Rahul shows it a straight bat"
"short of a length around the line of off, no swing and this is punched to extra cover"
"pushed a little straight, well fielded by Shkhar Dhawan at square leg, <b>and the two batsmen are standing mid-pitch</b>... time enough, though, for Rahul to get back. Bit of yes, no, maybe from the pair there"
"slower ball, worked off the pads towards deep backward square to keep the strike"
"tossed up and <b>blootered straight back down the ground!</b> Free-and-easy swing through the line, bottom hand off the bat and it sails over the ropes"
"pushed through quicker, this one is tapped away"
"on the stumps, Rahul is down on one knee, <b>hoicked over backward square this time!</b> Another sweet connection, bounces away"
"has that lured him out? Delhi are keen... Tossed up and spinning away, Rahul overbalances a touch and Pant whips off the bails. <b>Foot's on the line, and Rahul's a goner!</b> Took a couple of blows but Lamichhane lands one in return, first wicket down in the second over"
"floated up wide of the stumps, grips a touch and he lets it go"
"pushes through the Bosie, rags in as Agarwal goes back and clips it off the pads for his first run"
"back of a length over middle stump, defended on the back foot"
"shortish in the channel, dabbed away behind point for one"
"angled across the left-hander, Gayle bides his time and pokes towards mid-off"
"gets this away, dug in with pace off, Gayle hangs back and <b>glides the ball late past the dive of short third man!</b> Good touch for a big man. Like Peter Crouch"
"ah, now that's what we expect... <b>Kablammo! Smoked over long-on!</b> The sound off the bat was like the crack of doom for Ishant, who didn't looked back. Went 101 metres, apparently. Decent starter for 10"
"drags his length back, tucked down on the back foot for one"
"drops short, the googly spinning in from outside leg stump, <b>Gayle smashes it through backward square</b> - no one there, four all the way!"
"lobbed up slower on the stumps, Gayle defends this time"
"<b>dropped!</b> And it flies back down the ground for four! <b>Tough caught-and-bowled chance</b>, to be fair, Lamichhane did well to get a hand on it, nearly lost a digit for his troubles"
tossed up and punched into the covers off the back foot
"another googly outside leg, Gayle goes back French cricket style and thumps four more past short fine leg, Ishant rather going down in instalments"
"looped up outside off and <b>Gayle smears this in front of point for four more!</b> Brutal from the Boss, just a rueful look form Lamichhane"
"good wheels on off, Agarwal defends"
"shorter, climbing through as Agarwal makes room and flays unsuccessfully, trying to hit inside out"
"tight line, this time he's beaten trying to cut"
"pitched up, 147kph from Rabada, punched on the front foot but Gayle isn't interested in running as cover swoops"
"dug in short, Agarwal hacks across the line, <b>Rutherford holds on to the top edge!</b> That was an unequal five-ball contest, Rabada the winner by knockout as Agarwal's wild swing failed to get beyond the ring - though it took some catching, as the ball practically came down with ice on it"
"pitched up from round the wicket, jams the bat down... <b>and squeezes out four through backward square leg!</b> Bit streaky, but KXIP will take 'em. Rabada concedes his first runs"
"short of a length on off stump, Gayle plays it watchfully"
"short, no width on offer, tapped down into the leg side and Ishant fields"
"dug in again, climbing through outside off, Gayle lets it go"
"short again, cutter from Ishant but it spins away allowing Gayle to free the arms and lash a cut past the diving Shaw at point"
"another slower ball, Gayle attempts to pull but doesn't get a good connection"
short of a length and Gayle pings a cut but picks out the fielder this time. Good over from the floppy-haired stallion
"tossed up nice and slow from over the wicket, Miller stays back and drills down the ground"
"flat on middle and leg stump, nudged off the pads, Gayle takes his third single of the innings"
"slightly quicker, straightening outside off stump and punched off the back foot to long-off"
"lobbed up full and Gayle frees the arm but miscues a heave out towards deep midwicket, just one there"
"full and flighted, whipped away with the spin"
"<b>smashed into the night sky!</b> Gayle trying to bring down a UFO... Mishra goes the distance from the final ball of the over, royally spannered into the croid at deep midwicket"
"strikes first ball! <b>Miller slam dunks himself, picking out deep midwicket!</b> He came down the pitch but got under the ball, going towards the longest part of the ground, more height than trousers and it's well taken by Shaw"
pushed through and dabbed off the pads for one
flat on the stumps and Mandeep flicks it fine
"pushed through outside off, Gayle satisfies himself with another punch from the crease"
"dragged down a touch, Mandeep jumps back and flaps at the ball, pulled down the ground amid a whirl of arms"
darted on the stumps and Gayle pushes into a gap for one more
"full toss and <b>Gayle munches it for six more!</b> Filthy from MIshra, would have been rude not to respond in kind, a lusty hump into the stands... moves to the brink of fifty"
"flatter ball, worked away off the back foot for one - <b>that's his fifty</b>, just 25 balls to get there"
tossed up and stroked square from back in the crease
"dragged down, more tap from the Boss! <b>Smoked into the crowd at deep midwicket!</b> That's meat and drink once again, gone back many a row..."
"oh dear, <b>nearly a run-out chance!</b> Pushed into the off side and Gayle was slow to get going, not sure how close it would have been with a direct hit at the bowler's end"
pushed through and clipped for another single
"floated up, nicely in the slot as Mandeep steps out, <b>lofted gently, lovingly, all the way over the rope at deep extra cover!</b> Top shot"
flatter and punched square from the crease
"darted, a touch wider, steered to point"
"low arm, angling the ball in, Mandeep paddles it away and comes charging back to the danger end, as Gayle hobbles for the second"
floated up and driven down the ground
lobbed up and glanced fine off the pads
"length ball on off, pushed to mid-off"
"fuller and a bit wider outside off, Gayle waits for it and glides to third man"
keeping to a stump to stump line and Mandeep turns it off his pads to deep square leg
"on the fifth stump line again and fullish, Gayle steers to third man"
"down the track, he had to manufacture pace there, but Rutherford digs it in short and quicker, and he doesn't get hold of the pull, slaps it straight back"
"back to 114 kph, short of a length, and Gayle waits on it and pulls it gently to square leg"
"pacy one length and outside off, jabbed to backward point"
"good length on off, Gayle pushes it off the backfoot and is alive to the quick single"
nice looking steer to a fuller one outside off but he can't beat point
"back of a length now but sticking to just outside off, Mandeep opens the face to run it down to third man"
goes for the yorker on middle stump but not quite there and Gayle flicks it off his toes to deep square
ooh that kept a bit low. Slower ball by Rabada's standards at 128 kph and Mandeep was too early on the pull. Good length outside off and goes under his bat to the keeper
"<b>that one needs to be fetched from way into the crowd</b> He seemed to have pre-decided to attack Lamicchane, decent enough ball outside off but he gets down on one knee and slogs sweeps it into oblivion"
"<b>relay catch on the boundary and that's a huge moment</b> They're checking upstairs, but Gayle is walking. Bowled from much behind the stumps, wrong 'un that bounced a little bit more, Gayle rocks back and pulls powerfully. Ingram at deep midwicket catches it over his head, and he's overbalancing... overbalancing, but spots Axar a good ten yards away. Just in the nick of time, lobs the ball to Axar, who has a wide smile on his face while catching it. Amazing work by Ingram there."
"another wrong un, Curran didn't really read it, came on the front foot and defends with soft hands"
"good bowling, gets it drift across and turn into Curran who can only push it back"
"fuller on the stumps, comes forward and pushes to the bowler's right"
"<b>another wrong 'un does it</b> Curran had no clue, and he was looking to jab it away, but it bounced a bit more and came on slower and he ends up popping it back for the easiest of return catches."
"drags it too short, Mandeep goes deep in his crease and whips it to midwicket"
"flatter on off and kept lower, Ashwin watches it carefully and steers it away towards gully"
drifts on the pads and Ashwin is able to gently nudge it into the mid-on region
"ooh, that had him caught in two minds. Drifts on leg and spins sharply across, kept out at the last moment"
too short and Mandeep rocks back to pull this powerfully to deep midwicket. Hit too well almost so he has to sprint back to make the second run
"given some more air, and Mandeep works it of the front foot to midwicket. Wanted the second but Ashwin sent him back"
"a touch too full on the pads, worked to midwicket. Mandeep looking for the second again, but there wasn't one there and rightly sent back"
"<b>good shot</b> drags it down short, a bit quicker, Ashwin spots it, goes back and flicks it well, placing it between deep midwicket and long-on"
"googly, Ashwin blocks it from deep in his crease"
"he's playing him by going well back, perhaps trying to play him off the pitch. Legspinner, on a length and he pushes it wide of the bowler"
"tossed up outside off, he takes a big stride and pats it back"
"<b>dropped by Rabada diving forward at deep square</b> too short and Mandeep's eyes probably lit up. went at it hard, pulling off the back foot but didn't connect sweetly. Rabada put in the dive but couldn't hold on. Lamichhane ends with 3 for 40"
"given room outside off and he manufactures a slap-drive over extra cover. Great timing, and one bounce into the fence"
"fuller outside off, takes a stride out and drives to long-off"
too short again and Ashwin wanted to pull that between long-on and deep midwicket but didn't get the placement right and long-on collects
"down the track, gets some drift on this so it ends up on the pads and he tucks it to deep midwicket"
"quicker one on off and turning away, bunted down to long-on off the outside half of the bat"
goes back in his crease to whip this length ball to long-on's right
"flattish on the stumps, punched to cover"
"good length on off, punched to long-off"
"<b>got him</b> Mandeep gave him the charge, but Axar out-smarted him, and fired it in well wide of off stump - though within the tramlines. Pant collects and whips off the bails."
"fired it in on leg stump, he wants to whip it but misses, struck on the pads"
"<b>cracking shot</b> given room outside off, a bit short and he stands tall, and unleashes a cover drive with a flowing backlift to bisect the field"
"length ball on the pads, flicked to deep square"
"ooh just beats his outside edge. Length ball from around the wicket, angled in and he plays inside the line"
"good length outside off, Harpreet stays beside it and steers to backward point"
"back of a length just around off, Ashwin gives himself some room and steers it to third man"
"back of a length just outside off, he stands tall again and punches. A hint of vintage Yuvraj in that, but doesn't get the timing right. Goes to mid-off"
"<b>swatted</b>. Clever shot by Ashwin, was moving about in his crease and Rabada went for the short one. But he had cleared his front leg and given himself space so he could club a pull shot and place it well, wide of midwicket"
"the bowler responds with a pacy back of length ball that almost cuts him in half. Backing away to make room again, but can't lay bat on ball"
"stands and swings, but doesn't connect. angling across and he cleared his front leg to try and crash it through off, but no contact"
angling across too far outside off and he'll have to bowl that again
"too far outside off once again, he's not getting his radar right, wanting to angle across and make him reach for it. But too wide"
"<b>what a shot</b> moves slightly across expecting Ishant to stick to the line wide outside off, and gets in perfect position to flay this over cover with a flourish."
"yorker outside off, squirted to point"
"too short and Ashwin clobbers a pull shot again, but long-on tidies up to his right"
"carved through the offside again, to deep point. Stayed in his crease and went deep to deal with this fuller length ball on off"
"he was giving himself room but Ishant follows him. Ashwin equal to it though, clips it off his toes to long-on"
"<b>short ball does it</b>. Ashwin was backing away to give himself room and swat through the legside, but Rabada had seen that in his last over and bowled a pacy short one closer to the batsman, denying him room. He goes through with the pull anyway but gets it near the end of the bat, and the ball loops to long-on, where Shreyas Iyer takes a good low catch tumbling forward"
"another short ball, 144 kph, Harpreet goes to pull but doesn't get hold of it. The ball pops up towards a vacant mid-on region, so safe"
"<b>they've stolen two byes off a slower bouncer!</b> Viljoen ducked under it and it went straight to Pant. He still decided to take off for a single. Pant relays to Rabada, who misses the stumps while under-arming and they take a second"
"slower ball, Viljoen comes on the front foot to whip it with his wrists to deep midwicket. Slide and save keeps them to two"
"slower ball, length outside off. Misses the pull but they run anyway and take a bye. This time Pant relays the ball to Rabada, who stops it with his feet and doesn't attempt another under-arm"
"<b>what a finish!</b> Harpreet has been impressive in his first IPL outing. Was ready for the short and fast bouncer, pulls it from shoulder height and connects beautifully, sending it soaring over square leg."
"length ball, nips touch as it hits the seam and Shaw has a waft, plays around it outside off"
"shortish, 149kph and slapped off the back foot, no timing and it trickles to point"
"dug in outside off, 130kph, maybe a cutter, Shaw has a dash and again fails to connect"
"back of a length, coming in and this is worked square of midwicket for DC's first run"
"shortish, 146kph and punched firmly off the back foot, sends it to point"
"slightly back of a length, too tight to cut and Dhawan misses with an attempted force"
"round the wicket, back of a length and he again swings at it and misses"
"length ball, stand-and-delivered back over the bowler's head! <b>Crunchy shot for a straight four</b>, Curran too easy-paced for that length"
"touch short and whipped away into the leg side, sounded sweet off the bat but the man in the deep comes around"
"over the wicket, pitched up at 137kph, no swing as Dhawan dances down and cracks the ball to point on the bounce"
"poor ball, offcutter drifting straight and Dhawan flips it away nonchalantly off the pads, in the air but wide of short fine leg for four"
"slower ball and he hacks to leg, big top edge from Dhawan, it's swirling towards fine leg... <b>but Shami doesn't get anywhere near it!</b> A swirling chance, up into the glare of the lights, and it didn't look like he picked it up running back from the circle"
Shami is now tonked for the first six! <b>Whirled away over deep backward square by Shaw!</b> Right out of the screws and into the crowd
"pitched up and driven, lands a few yards short of mid-on"
"fullish, an offcutter from Shami, beats the drive on the inside"
"short and a touch leg side, finds a leading edge as Shaw closes the face"
"full in the slot, taking the pace off... but Dhawan rapidly puts it back on, <b>creamed over cover</b>, beats the leaping fielder and races to the fence!"
"back of a length, chopped down past the stumps via a bottom edge and they scamper through"
"chipped into the covers, Dhawan comes and then changes his mind... <b>and Mandeep hits the stumps at the non-striker's end with Shaw stranded!</b> Give his partner a reproachful look, it was Dhawan's call but he decided it wasn't on way too late for Shaw to get back. Excellent throw to hit one-and-a-bit stumps"
"short and wide, slashed and it skips away off the outside edge! Down to third man for four"
"slower ball, short and wide and <i>larruped</i> through point for four more! Threw the entire kitchen at that, never mind the sink"
dug in and Dhawan cuts this in front of point for one
"short and at the body, Viljoen going over the wicket now, worked away for one"
"back round the wicket, dug in and tapped down on the back foot"
"round the wicket, and sliding through outside off, Dhawan dances... <b>and clears long-off in a blink!</b> Clattered for six. Welcome to the IPL, son"
pushed through and worked away through midwicket
"darted quickly just outside off, Iyer is back and slashes past the infield, opens the faces and sends the ball fizzing behind point for his first boundary"
lobbed up and tapped into a gap
"fast delivery, 94kph and pushed through outside off as Dhawan comes at him, deflected off the pads"
"touch short this time, Iyer presses out and then hops back to throw his hands through a cut, bisects the men at cover and that will run away!"
"round the wicket, drops short and Dhawan is back and crunching a pull, gets it through again - starts the over with a boundary"
"uses the feet, pushed into the off side"
"flat on the stumps from over the wicket, played softly into the leg side and Iyer immediately makes the call for two"
darted on the stumps and clipped firmly to square leg
"floated up a touch wider, Iyer is on the front foot and pushes one square on the off side"
"floated up outside off, Dhawan punches to cover - another dot ball, Ashwin finishing the over well"
tossed up on leg stump and clipped through midwicket
punched down the ground
"floated up, room for Iyer to ram a drive on the half-volley, well stopped on the boundary by the diving Gehardus Viljoen"
pushed through and chopped into the covers going back
angled across outside off and Dhawan happily cuts for one
"full and drifting on to leg stump, Iyer dabs off his pads"
"lobbed up and drilled back at the bowler, does well to get a hand on it"
"oop, that has gone completely wrong, pitched about a yard in front of him and bouncing numerous times off the cut strip... Iyer wants to hit it, <b>and the umpire signals no-ball</b>. Murugan doesn't look happy with that call"
floated up full and heaved into the leg side without timing
pushes through the googly and this is cut away for one
tapped into the covers
"floats up a Bosie on off stump, clubbed into a gap the leg side, just one though"
"flighted, outside off and spinning in as Dhawan steps out and cushions it in front of square"
tossed up from round the wicket and tapped away
"round arm delivery, sliding leg side as Dhawan flicks at it and misses... <b>They check for the stumping</b>, but his foot was always grounded. Just a wide"
worked into the leg side
"pushed through, <b>clips the outside edge and runs fine!</b> Not where Iyer was aiming, done by the carrom ball"
defends this coming forwards
"tossed up, another carrom ball and driven for one"
"round the wicket, angled flat on the stumps and turned through midwicket"
punched into the covers
"dew taking effect, maybe...? Slips out the hand, well wide of the batsman and Rahul can't cling on to it either"
tossed up on the stumps and nudged into a gap leg side
"floated up full, Dhawan rolls out the reverse-sweep, <b>squirted past backward point and that'll run away!</b> Cute stroke and well executed, closing in on his fifty now"
"another slippery soap bar, wide on the off side"
excited appeal from Murugan as Dhawan chops down on a leg break... Was it pad first? No thought of an appeal
"pushed through outside off stump, Dhawan drops back and cuts firmly behind the sweeper"
"googly to finish, sits up for the cut - but Dhawan finds the fielder this time"
"keeps it full and around off, pushed to point off the front foot. They decide against the single"
"hint of shape across the right-hander, but he is able to negotiate it well, steers it to third man comfortably"
"good length, stump to stump, Dhawan presses forward and defends it back to the bowler"
"<b>beamer</b> the dew is making it hard for sure. That slipped out of Curran's hands and ends up at Dhawan's throat almost. He does well to pat it down, and it bounces to the keeper. Free hit coming up"
"too short and Dhawan goes to pull hard, but doesn't time it all that well to deep square leg. Overthrows gives them two. Harpreet threw it well, but Rahul couldn't collect"
"clobbered, but straight to cover. He absolutely leathered a cover drive there to a full one outside off"
"length ball going across him, ends up wide of off and he has to reach for it to slap, but gets an under-edge to the keeper"
"gives it some air and gets it to dip on Dhawan, who goes down to sweep but doesn't connect. The ball rolls to short third man off the pad"
"tossed up, very full on the stumps, clipped off his toes to long-on"
"googly, on a length and turning away, he pushes it to short cover and they take a quick single. <b>Fifty</b> for Dhawan. Perfectly paced knock for this sort of chase"
"very full again, shimmies down the track and takes it on the half-volley, driving it straight back. Long-on runs to his left to tidy up"
"tossed up again, and Dhawan is down the track too, drives to extra cover"
"drifts on the pads and Iyer comes down the track again, tucks it off his pads to deep midwicket"
"<b>smashed</b>. Tossed up, went a bit wide of the crease, but a bit too full. Iyer uses his bottom hand and allies it with a good stride out to hit this straight back and into the sightscreen"
"carrom ball, pushed to leg side"
too far down leg and that will be wide
"length ball outside off, slapped to cover"
"full outside off, driven fluently through cover"
"good length on the stumps, nudged into the offside for a single"
"tossed up a bit too far, seemed like the ball slipped out a tad, but the batsman can't take advantage, digs it out to cover"
"back of a length outside off, cut away but backward point dives to his left to save it"
"too short on off, and he pulls it off his hips to deep square leg. didn't time it perfectly, but placed it well"
"<b>Ashwin takes a tumbling catch while avoiding Gayle</b> back of a length off-cutter, and Dhawan wanted to pull it hard, but because of the movement, he got it off the toe-end and sends it up swirling in the air to deep midwicket. Ashwin ran back and had it well covered, but Gayle was also converging. In the end, Ashwin did well to hold on to it and avoid a collision with Gayle. Ashwin ran from mid-on, Gayle was running back from midwicket"
"on the fifth stump line, gets down low to square drive it to deep point"
"good length outside off, defended to backward point"
dug it into the pitch but doesn't rise too high and it's down leg. Pant able to flick it off his hips to square leg
too far down leg and it's a wide
"good length homing into off stump, inside edge onto pad and it rolls towards point"
"back of a length outside off, punched to extra cover"
"slower bouncer goes down leg, he paddles it to fine leg. Gayle at short fine dives to his left and gets a hand to it, but it still goes to the boundary"
"getting some shape away from the batsman, but it's back of a length ball and he's able to punch it to cover's right"
"angling into him from around the wicket, he was giving himself room but Curran followed him. Squirted to point"
"clears his front leg and slashes it. Length ball on the stumps, wasn't in perfect control but the thick edge takes it to the point boundary"
"<b>caught by Curran at deep square leg</b>. Could it be... could it be...? Tried to fetch a pull from outside off to a ball that didn't really bounce all that much, ends up getting more height than distance. Curran has to merely take a few steps to get into position and gobble it up."
"dug it into the pitch short outside off, doesn't come on to the bat, he stays in his crease and slaps it to extra cover"
"angled into him from around the stumps, and pushed to cover. They set off for a quick single. There is a shy at the stumps but it misses. Might have been close"
"good length outside off, nudged to point. Ingram calls a loud 'NO' with Iyer taking a few steps down"
"full outside off, goes to drive but can only get it to long-on off the inside half of the bat"
"loses his line, down legside. Wide"
"good shot, picked his spot. Back of a length, seemed to hold in the pitch again, but Ingram was in position to pull and does it by going over the in-field. Once bounce in the midwicket fence. He placed it where no fielder was there"
"full outside off, Iyer guides it carefully to third man"
"good length on leg stump, tucked off his pads to deep midwicket"
"good length on off, tapped to short mid-on"
"good work by Rahul behind the stumps. Iyer backs away to have a thrash at it through extra cover, but the bowler follows and goes between bat and pad. Because he has moved away so much it's well down leg side but Rahul dives and stops the ball"
flays at this full one outside off and a thick outside edge rolls to third man
"good length on off, swiped across the line to deep square leg. Not well timed"
"has an absolute thrash at that, width outside off and room to free his arms, he does so with a powerful cover drive, but straight to the cover fielder"
"dug in short and Iyer is defeated on the pull, hits his chest and rolls to short third man"
"<b>great placement and shot</b> full ball on the fourth stump line, and he drives with an open face to place it to short third man's left and to the fence"
angles it into him this time to deny room and he squirts it back to the bowler
"he's in perfect control is Ingram. Short ball, off-cutter and he swivels to pull this off his hips and to the square leg boundary. Doing it calmly"
"<b>Ingram's taking charge</b>. He's not going to allow another botched chase on his watch. Super shot this, gave himself room and drove it from his toes through extra cover."
"back of a length outside off, moving away. Iyer wanted to steer it, but ends up feeling for it, with the ball going past edge"
"short ball into the body, he pulls to deep midwicket to raise <b>fifty</b>"
"<b>knocked him over</b> Ingram wanted to finish it off in a hurry perhaps, danced down the track to drive and ends up yorking himself. Ball screams through and knocks the middle stump out of the ground. Still time for a twist?"
"<b>there's a collision and a run out, it looks like</b> this was a length ball on the pads and Axar tucked it to deep square leg and called for two. Shami had finished his follow through and was in a legitimate position at the edge of the pitch, watching the ball. Axar turned around and half-collided with him, which meant he wasn't in time to beat the throw. He's not happy. Shami shrugs and says he didn't come in the way. And he's right"
another length ball on leg stump tucked to deep square. They are not going to take a second this time!
"cleared his front leg to have almighty thwack at it, but gets an under-edge to long-on"
"length ball angling into him, he was walking across, whips this to deep midwicket"
"smashed back with incredible power straight over the bowler, but long-off runs in and collects on the bounce. Great work from Miller. Rutherford thought it was a boundary and only set off for a run late"
"slashed this over cover, gets a thick outside edge but it falls safely and they take two. Risky shot, but fortune was with him"
"back of a length, swatted across the line and <b>he's picked out the gap at midwicket</b>. Delhi get over the line. They've won a match at home, though they stumbled and fumbled and wobbled and weaved at the finish line. But they got over it, which is what counts. They move clear of KXIP in the points table. Iyer will be pleased to have seen this through. No second miracle for Curran and Punjab, but they still managed to drag it out till the last over - commendable given Delhi's position"
