"tossed up on the stumps, defended from deep in the crease"
"flighted, Burns presses forward outside off, takes the inside edge and runs low to short leg as he blocks"

"tight around off stump, 83mph but not coming back enough to make him play"
"excellent line, Jennings presses forward and <b>thins one through to the keeper!</b> No doubt about that, an audible nick and Jennings walks - he won't be following up his Galle ton with another biggie.

Dilruwan and Dickwella just <i>know</i> this is hitting, and Hawk-Eye agrees, thudding into the top of off stump with enough conviction to overturn the original call... Stokes is a goner!

"Burns too uses his feet but couldn't middle the drive, a single nonetheless as the ball rolls towards covers"
Root pushes forward and defends this on the leg side
almost a run-out! Good work there back the man at short leg. Burns pushes it on the leg side and the momentum brings him out the crease. The short-leg fielder gets the ball in his right hand and shies at the stumps. A direct-hit there and Burns would have been gone

"another reverse sweep, however, straight to the short third man fielder this time around"
"now a paddle sweep, worked gently towards fine leg for the fourth brace of the over"

"tossed up outside off, inviting the batsman forward who pushes at it and misses"
"a big appeal for caught-behind, there was some noise as Burns missed the sweep, but it was the bat hitting the ground"
"no doubt this time. Edged and taken as Akila Dananjaya strikes in his first over. Flighted outside off, Burns pushes and gets an outside edge, a good low catch by Dhananjaya de Silva. They are checking upstairs if it was a clean take and that's clear, hands under the ball and England are 89 for 4"
"tossed up around off, comes forward and blocks"
"fuller on the stumps, at 88kph, pushed back from the crease"

"drops short, Moeen goes back and swings across the line... hit on the pad! Not given by Erasmus but SL <b>review</b>, and this could be a case of Moeen, Moeen, gone! Yep, smacked on the knee roll, Hawk-Eye says it was bulldozing leg stump. Not exactly a hall-of-fame dismissal but they all count, and England's little fightback is curtailed"

"tossed up on the stumps, Buttler tickles one through mid-on"
uses the feet but picks out midwicket
"Foakes sweeps, the ball sidles through via pad and wicketkeeper, slip takes the catch - <b>given!</b> Was there a bottom edge on that? Foakes obviously thinks so, as he's walking off. The ball definitely deflected off the front pad, but hard to see if bat was involved without Snicko... Whatever the case, Sri Lanka have rid themselves of England's meddlesome wicketkeeper"

round the wicket and <B>beats the edge!</b> Curran wobbles a touch as he stretches outside off.
"<B>massive turn and this could be stumped!</b> Curran stretched forward, didn't get to the pitch and toppled over as he did so! Off came the bails, but <B>where's the bowler's front foot?</b> Millimetres in it, but that's legit. And, crikey, Curran has done magnificently there, he does the splits to keep his back foot anchored as the bails came off, then swaps his toe for his bat as Dickwella belatedly plucks out the stump for a second attempt! So much going on, and a bog-standard dot-ball is the upshot"
forward and defended
firmly pressed back down the track
"<B>reverse sweep, and that's a massive wicket!</b> Buttler doesn't keep his shot down, and top-edges a lob to backward point. The end of a belting innings that was both agenda-setting and counter-attacking. And definitely worth a hundred in ordinary conditions. But what can England's tail eke out from here?"
firmly pressed back down the wicket

decent leave! Slightly wide line and doesn't grip much as it shapes past the edge of the off stump

defended again into the off side. Canny lines and lengths
ball-sniffing defensive block

"ooh, not far from carrying to slip! Leach prodding tentatively from the crease as the ball turned away from him"
"hello, sailor! Leach brings out the slog-sweep from his locker, bludgeoning four through midwicket! Didn't see that coming"
floated up and tapped away defensively to the off side
"floated up outside off and Curran reverses the hands, swats it to backward point"
presses forward and squeezes the ball out square
"pushed through a touch flatter, Curran drops into the crease and swipes a cut, again finds the fielder"
"tossed up on the stumps, chopped through the covers backing away to the leg side"
"spin for Dilruwan, ragging away past the outside edge as Leach gropes in the dark outside off"
"floated up nice and full, jabbed into a gap in the covers"
"flighted, spinning away as Leach comes across"
"this grips and hits the outside edge with Leach squared up on the crease, but he manages to keep it down"
taps this one away from the crease
"<b>bowled him with a peach!</b> Too good for thee, Leachy... Pitching on middle and leg, spinning sharply and giving the top of off a Glasgow kiss"
"given lbw first ball! Struck on knee roll playing back... but Anderson <b>reviews</b>, and it looks like this might have been doing too much! Yes, ball-tracking measures the impact as outside off, never mind where the ball was going to end up (clue: missing), so Anderson gets a life"
"beaten pushing forwards now! <b>Did Dickwella shell an edge there?</b> No, I think it missed the bat and flicked Anderson's thigh pad on the way through"
tossed up and steered through point... Curran decides to take the single on offer
"floated up on off, lunges out to defend"
"hello, it's the Burnley Lara, rolls out the reverse-sweep and connects pretty well, but picks out backward point"
"extra bounce here, beats the outside edge on the back foot, Dickwella rising hastily to take the ball above his waist"
tossed up full and Anderson lumberjacks a sweep away through backward square leg for one
"now Curran is able to take an easy single into the covers, keeping the strike for Dananjaya... Curious all round"
"floated up on the stumps, Curran defends watchfully"
"humped straight back down the ground for six! <b>Clean swing through the line from Curran</b>, who's taken his cue at last"
"slows his pace down, looking for some deception, Curran taps it away"
presses forward on off to block
"BOSHTY! <b>Smoked into the crowd at long-on!</b> Big Sam rolling out the big shots now, belting Dananjaya for another maximum"
"pushed through flatter, tucked off the pads calmly for one to keep the strike"
"tight lines on off, tight forward defensive from Curran"
"punched back down the ground through mid-on, but now he declines the single"
short of a length and heading leg side but he misses out with a lusty swing
tossed up and tapped away
"flighted, spinning away and Dickwella whips off the bails - the keeper is confident, but he always is. What does Chris Gaffaney think? There's about one frame in it, and the umpire comes down on the batsman's side! Maybe just an atom or two of boot rubber in contact with the turf and Curran survives"
"never mind singles, Curran's getting 'em in sixes! <b>Smashed over the pickets at long-off!</b> Cashing in while he can"
"tossed up but drifting leg side, Anderson shovels it away behind square - and that's going to go for four, <b>bringing up the England 250!</b>"
"pushed through outside off, Anderson reverse-sweeps... and somehow deflects the ball away for a leg bye to get off strike"
"flat delivery on off stump, Curran defends"
"fires this wide as Curran wanders down, he's nearly in trouble but throws the bat  and hoicks the ball towards cover, then slopes back to his crease"
"opens the shoulders, <b>hooned over deep extra cover for six more!</b> His big shots are inversely proportional to his size and this <i>soars</i> over the boundary, with the fielder in the deep desperately backpedalling!"
and he impishly picks a gap through point for the single he needs to protect Anderson for another over
"tight line from Dilruwan, defended coming across"
tapped away on off
"floated up straight and Curran aims an almighty yahoo over the leg side, misses completely but the ball turns far enough to clear off stump and fly past Dickwella for byes!"
pushed through and defended
"fired flat on off stump, Curran punches into another all-too-easy-to-find gap at cover for a single"
"Anderson defends soundly on off, to cheers from the Barmies"
"over the wicket and pitching outside leg stump, Curran reverse-sweeps but can't get it into a gap for two, so declines the single"
"nicely bowled, this spins sharply past the outside edge from leg to off"
"tossed up, Curran skips down and whips into the leg side, there might have been two... but he hadn't set off hard straight away, so again sticks at the striker's end"
"dragged down and Curran latches on, <b>spanks another Dorothy Dix over square leg!</b> That's his fifty, rocketing up through the gears - he's added 33 from his last 25 balls"
pushed through flat and he taps it away
"Dananjaya bowling the wheelie bin line outside leg, but Curran pokes it into a gap and scampers through, to the bleary delight of the English-supporting sections of the crowd"
"flat delivery, Curran comes across on off and defends"
"presses forward, gets a thickish inside edge to the leg side, there's a single if he wants it... but he doesn't"
"tossed up outside off, Curran goes back and shows it a straight bat"
"ooh, how's that gone there...? He's somehow managed to sweep the ball back past his off stump! Must have been inches from playing on"
"lobbed up on the stumps and worked into the leg side, Curran this time calls the single"
"flighted, Anderson is emboldened to sweep, but only succeeds in finding backward square leg"
tossed up and poked into the leg side
"<b>dropped!</b> Pushpakumara puts down a goober at long-on! Curran stepped out and tried to clear the man, sent this straight to him... but the catch popped out"
"flighted, outside leg and prodded away"
"and now he pumps the ball well back over long-on, to rub it in! <b>Sweetly struck down the ground once again</b>, Curran hurtles on"
tossed up and tickled square on the  leg side for another easy run
"and he does, even reverse-sweeping with impunity, though without reward"
"full on off, Curran leans out to defend"
"round the wicket, fired in straight and tapped to the leg side"
tossed up and prodded away on off stump
"gets into line, all very vanilla from Curran so far this over"
"pushed through, shows it a straight bat into the covers"
"floated up and Curran can't quite get this away past cover - a maiden to Dilruwan, and it keeps Anderson on strike for the next over"
"tip and run, dabbed to the leg side and Anderson scampers off the strike straightaway"
"on the legs, tucked to midwicket"
"a madcap scamper down the track, and for once he loses his shape on impact, and scuffs his mow to square leg"
"way outside leg, and <B>swept gloriously for four to ruin one of the great stats</B> ... <a href='http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;orderby=batted_score;qualmax1=0;qualmin1=0;qualval1=fours;template=results;type=batting;view=innings' target='_blank'>this one, in case you were wondering</a>"
"on the back foot, stabbed to gully without much intent for once"
tucked out to deep square leg to keep the strike. This is an absolutely belting performance from the child-man
"on the back foot, defended to the leg side"
"<B>flat and fierce to long on, and that could be a brilliant catch!</B> Mathews stoops low, and emerges with the ball embedded in his palms, it's a stunning interception regardless of the catch, as that was travelling. He shrugs as he stands up, and the umpires call for a review. It's a very grainy image, so who knows what they can make of that. The soft signal was <B>not out</b>... aha, that's a better image, clearly bounces. On we go"
"sliding onto the back foot, and blocked away"
"<B>smashed hard out to long off,</B> and that is the end of an absolutely gun innings. Right under the ball once again, looking to clear the ropes as ever, but doesn't get the elevation for once"
"zinging down the leg side, decent carry on the wrong line"
"swing, but leg-sided again, and a super take from Foakes, stretching massively to his left. He took a catch with his second delivery at Galle but that was an even better effort"
"Foakes being made to earn his keep again as Anderson strays to leg yet again. There's swing, he just hasn't harnessed it yet"
"outside off this time, and stabbed down to third man"
"full and straight, targetting the toes of the right-hander and squeezed to leg"
"bending back into the knee-roll, helped with the swing to fine leg"
solid line and length with a hint of shape towards the slips. Blocked
"<B>ghosts through bat and pad!</B> Plays for the swing and beaten on the angle, so close to an inside-edge!"
"firmly pushed to mid-on, tidy line and probing swing"
"on the toes, chiselled out to deep square leg"
"three slips as this one is dangled outside the right-hander's off stump, back of a length to tempt the cut, but nothing doing"
"wider line, across Silva's bows. Through to the keeper"
"<B>beauty!</B> Bursts past the outside edge with good carry, and half an appeal from Foakes behind the stumps. Kept his bat just inside the line"
"down the leg side, more strangled appeals, but nothing there. Good pace from Anderson, and movement too, but his line is awry so far"
"better line, good length, bending sharply towards the cordon as the batsman leaves alone"
"tucked out to deep point, solid bat on ball"
"tailing in from outside off, firmly blocked with a full face of the bat"
"full once more, right up to the blockhole. No way through there"
"firm defence, more threatening wobble on a good length"
"outside off, played with soft hands into the off side"
"very full, fractionally too full, and that's excellently played, clean through long-on with a high elbow"
"on the toes, tucked to the leg side"
"shaping past the legs. Umpire Erasmus is sizing up the danger area, Curran may be getting a touch tight in his followthrough"
defended on the up to mid-off. That may be the end of a fine day's work for Young Sam
"full, straight, blocked"
"very full again, and defended back down the wicket"
"fenced through the cordon, and eludes Curran at third man! Soft hands, keeping the ball down, and a slightly muffed attempt at a gather on the boundary's edge"
"<B>that's the length for Anderson!</B> His first ball that has really kicked from a good length, past a flimsy poke"
"zipping into a defensive push on the back foot. Better now from Anderson, but maybe too late to delay the onset of the spinners"
"raps the pad on a full length, climbing over the stumps. A solid finish to the over"
"making things happen straightaway, as Karunaratne goes for a walk and is thumped on the pads by a big tweaker. Too far down to think about the review this time..."
"on the pads, flicked backward of square for the single"
"looped up, dips late, eased up to wide long-off for the single"
"on the toes, tucked square. There's turn on offer already, and that was in the air for a while, but well wide of short leg"
"punched back to the bowler, with a good stride"
sliding back and across to work to the leg side
"round the wicket, wide line, stroked elegantly to deep cover"
"tossed up, slowly slowly through the air, and clipped back to the bowler"
"head over the ball, stretching forward on off stump"
"<B>edged but short of slip!</B> The bounce did for Dimuth, and that so nearly passed Stokes on the full. Close!"
fully forward to block again
"pushed back into the crease, punched on the up to deep cover"
"round the wicket, inside-edged past leg slip as Karunaratne stabs forward. Sharp turn for Leach"
"fully forward, and defended to cover"
"angled bat, glided to backward point"
"<B>bowled him!</B> That's a snorter from Leach, perfect line, perfect length, angled in from round the wicket, gripping the deck, straightening past the edge and into the top of off!"
"<B>huge bite and bounce!</B> Beats the edge, well taken by Foakes who whips off the bails for good measure"
scuffed out of the rough with the toe-end of a loose drive

"defended into the off side, big stride"
"<B>slaps the pad but sliding down!</B> This one doesn't turn, and the natural variation is threatening both sides of the bat"

"advancing to the pitch of the ball, chipped to the leg side but into short leg's shins"
"wristily across the line, gathered at short midwicket"
"on the back foot, stabbed past square leg"
"back and across. Solid in defence, but he's being made to concentrate hard"
"very full, clipped off the toes to wide mid-on, they scamper the single"
"sharp bite from outside off! Defended with a big stride, as the ball embeds in the midriff"
"more turn, nearly wriggles through as Pushpak pushes with hard hands"
"this is a threatening line, just outside off, and really fizzing for the gloves. Stabbed uneasily down to the leg side"
sweeping ... trying anything to relieve the mounting pressure. Backward square limits the damage
fenced to the leg side
eased down to long-on
"<strong>big turn!</strong> Beats the edge with four men now lurking round the bat. Foakes gathers well, as a reminder to keep that back foot anchored"
"driven to short extra, technically a dropped catch, but that just smashed him!"
"<B>jeepers, that's done everything!</B> Flight, bite, dip, turn, bounce, over the top of middle and past the hand of slip!"
"outside off, more alarming lift off the deck"
"stabbed away, the nightwatchman survives. But golly, there's life in that deck already!"
<strong>oh my giddy aunt</strong>! A beauty to start straight away. Huge turn and beats Karunaratne
and now the one that goes on with the arm. Awkwardly defended off the back foot
"more delicious turn, but left alone"
swept to short fine leg. Moeen already found his funk
slightly overpitched and driven down to long off for the first runs of the day. Joe Root applauds the rendition of Jerusalem
nice turn in and a solid defence to end an encouraging over for Mr Moeen
"round the wicket to Karunaratne, slightly on the pads and clipped out to deep mid-wicket for a trundled single"
"solid prod forward from Pushpak, as Leach hones in on off stump"
"tossed up and edged, but wide of second slip and Moeen gives chase"
"review! Leach gets nice turn and beats Karunaratne's inside edge. Russell Arnold reckons bounce could be the factor. Beats the edge. Has it turned too much? <strong>Pitched on off, but it's missing leg!</strong> Review lost."
"flighted and full, driven to short mid-wicket"
"<strong>did that carry?</strong> Worked off the back foot in a hurry. Jennings is at short leg, and moves like a fox to try and take the catch. Hits him straight on the boot"
very full from Moeen and driven nicely through the covers for a couple. It's all action out there!
"lobs up in the air, but well wide of short leg. Surely a wicket is just around the corner..."
a horror slog from Pushpakumara. Doesn't connect with it and it lands safe in front of mid on
"<strong>that was an ugly, ugly shot</strong>. Again a horror swipe across the line, and the man is set like the bear trap there at mid-wicket and England have got their first of the day. That was an ugly hoick, and it got what it deserved"
tossed up with a hint of turn and driven down the ground to long on for an easy single
"tossed up and full, Karunaratne defends. End of a fine over from Moeen"
"full once more, perhaps a touch too full, and dug out"
driven comfortably away to long off for a single
worked off the back foot into short leg

"full and on the pads, and clipped out to the boundary rider at deep mid-wicket"
"nicely tossed up, but again too full. As a result, not enough turn to put Dhananjaya under any issues. Driven away through cover"
"nice from Moeen, giving it plenty of flight. DDS forward and defends"
"slightly full and again driven, this time to long on"
"round the wicket to Karunaratne, and that's a solid defence"
<strong>bit of extra bounce</strong> as Karunaratne looks to cut. Beats the top edge

"back of a length, Karunaratne rocks back and cuts out to deep point"
"lovely turn as Leach fizzes it back of a length, worked through the gap at square leg for a single"
"<strong>edged</strong>, but just short of slip. Keeps a touch low and Stokes can't believe that hasn't carried"
Dhananjaya prods forward as Leach goes full
"starts this one on middle, searching for that Hollywood delivery, but this is defended"
on leg stump and clipped nicely through short mid-wicket
"<strong>nearly another!</strong> Karunaratne shimmies down the track, takes the edge but doesn't carry to leg slip"
goes for the drive but this comes off the inside edge. Risky shot in the circumstances

"indecision from Karunaratne, unsure whether to come forward or back. Ends up going back and defending"
full this time and driven to Rashid at mid on
"lovely line and length, just searching for turn, and solidly defended"
"again, uncertainty about whether to get forward or back, and it's somewhere in the middle. Defended solidly enough, but Karunaratne will need to be careful"
Dhananjaya dances to the pitch of this and pushes it back to Leach
"fuller this time, and again it's defended back. Fascinating contest"
"flighted on fourth stump, defended to point"
"goes for the leave, but that's always risky. Encouragement for Leach that Dhananjaya thinks he's on top"
"back of a length, and whipped through mid-wicket"
"nicely played by Karunaratne. Round the wicket, not enough turn and nicely guided with a deft late cut down to third man for four. <strong>Brings up the team 50</strong>"
"four more as Dhananjaya pushes this confidently through extra cover. Rashid gives chase, but he can't pull it back in"
simple push down the ground for a single. This partnership blooming at the moment
solid push as Karunaratne waits for the turn on the front foot
"tossed up and full on leg stump, driven to Rashid at mid on"
lets this go as Moeen tries to entice him to prod at one outside off
"<strong>oh that's a spitting cobra!</strong> Perfect length, turns at the last minute and Karunaratne is unsure where to play that. Beaten"

"<strong>beats him</strong>. Outside off, Dhananjaya prods forward and is beaten"
"<strong>more spicy turn</strong>, and that's ragged once more past the outside edge"

"tossed up very full again, and Karunaratne's happy to take a single down to long off"
"round the wicket to Dhananjaya, a big stride forward and it's defended"
a bit quicker shorter of a length and worked through the covers. Mr Rashid has to go chasing once more. This is not the sort of day where you want to be doing shuttle runs from mid off to deep cover regularly
"loads and loads of flight, and that's <strong>smooth as silk</strong>. A very firm strike down the ground, nutmegs his team mate and it's four for Dhananjaya"
"good length well outside off, Dhananjaya happy to take a big stride and defend"
on off this time and again it's worked down the ground for a single
"<strong>off the outside edge</strong> along the ground to point! Lovely pace off the ball, and that's a risky drive from DDS"
solider defence this time as it's on off
rocks back as this is a fraction shorter and it's worked out to deep cover for a single
"gets down low to sweep, but misses. Hits the pads, but it's comfortably outside the line"
reverse sweep ahoy! Nicely played and that's great work by Rashid rushing round at third man. Saves it from going to the fence
"again a reverse sweep, this time Rashid barely moves"
Karunaratne closes the face early and the ball spoons off a leading edge along the ground back to Rashid
worked through square leg for a single
short and with appreciable turn. Cut to deep cover
"more appreciable turn, but a touch too short and turning leg. Karunaratne plays it late through leg slip and away"
"again, too much on the pads and worked to fine leg"
too short and worked down to long off. The classic mixed bag to start off with by Rashid. Will need to find a better rhythm if Root's to stick with him throughout the day.
played late by Dhananjaya as he nudges this off the back foot down to third man
worked off the back foot to short mid-wicket
low full toss bunted back to Leach

solid press forward and worked out to deep mid-wicket
"arm ball slides on, and Dananjaya has to defend"
"<strong>you lucky, lucky boy Karunaratne!</strong> A filthy drag down and it ends up spooning off a leading edge. Nearly carries to deep mid-wicket. Brings up the 50 partnership"
"dragged down once more, and Dhananjaya pulls it past Moeen at mid on and away for four. Rashid really struggling to get the length right so far"

solid defence that time as Rashid lands one once more
tossed up but it's a low full toss that's swept out to deep mid-wicket
"<strong>appeal for LBW</strong> as England think that's pad first. There's a discussion between the fielders, but no review taken. Again, that was the straight one from Rashid and Dhananjaya didn't pick it"
indecision from Karunaratne and he defends in the crease
full and worked calmly out to deep mid-wicket. England trying to make things happen as Karunaratne digs his burrow for the day

back of a length this time and worked out to deep mid-wicket
just short of a good length again and Dhananjaya defends
pre-meditated sweep down to fine leg for a couple. Stokes was off in hot pursuit very early to that. Over Foakes' head and away

defended to mid off
"full this time, and Karunaratne nudges it back to Rashid"
"Karunaratne is starting to bring out the full array of shots, and gets four with another nicely timed reverse sweep"
"reverse swept once more in the air, and that's <strong>Karunaratne's 50</strong>.  He's had to face a few absolute beauties, but has been extremely patient."

"floated up full, driven back to the bowler"
"length ball, shaping in a touch from over the wicket to the right-hander, worked through square leg"

"sliding across on a good length, 134kph/83mph and the batsman lets it go"
"some movement across the bows, again the line is a fraction wide and Karunaratne can leave while hanging on the back foot"

"dropped square on the off side, Stokes swoops... <b>and runs out Karu with a direct hit!</b> Stokes is the partnership-breaker, the man to make something happen, even when he's not bowling! That is a <i>sensational</i> bit of work in the field, he sprinted up from gully, he turned on a dime, had only one stump to aim at, but Karunaratne was struggling and and the throw caught him inches short of the crease!

"shortish, 136kph/84mph in the channel, de Silva hops into line"
"four more, <b>swatted for a Roger Federer forehand back down the ground!</b> That will get Stokes ticking, I'm sure. Nonchalantly done by de Silva, knew what was coming and just wristed it through mid-on"
"and now Stokes takes a BLINDER at slip! Beautifully bowled by Leach, flight and dip and spin, <b>kisses the outside edge as Mendis gropes forward</b>, it's an instinctive chance - but Stokes sticks out his left paw and snares it with preternatural certainty!

"Dhananjaya thought about playing for the turn there, but defends to mid on"
a fraction shorter and bunted away to cover
"lovely line and length, but no turn that time and Mathews defends"
"<strong>oh that's a special delivery</strong>. Flighted massively, on leg stump, it dips and turns to beat the outside edge"
"<strong>GETS HIM THIS TIME!</strong> That was beautiful bowling. Lovely turn and bounce on offer, Dhananjaya prods forward, it's kissed the edge and Foakes gobbles it up. England will deal with 3 or 4 overs of Rashid all sorts if he then produces a delivery just like that"
right on the money and Roshen prods forward
very full with massive flight. Defended into the off side and half a thought of a single
shorter and watchfully defended into short leg

short again and punched through the covers for a single

short again and defended. Roshen till to get off the mark
now he defends to backward point and they scamper a single

and now a drag down bunted to long on. Rashid not found his range entirely
defended with soft hands to backward point

short again and careful defence once more
solid prod once more

tossed up and punched down the ground for a single. Mathews is looking at home here
very full on leg and nicely worked through mid-wicket
another quick single through mid-wicket. Rashid swoops but they make it through
<strong>plays for turn that isn't there.</strong> That whistles past the outside edge
there's turn there this time. Leach in his funk
"more leg side this time from Leach as he goes for a ball of the century, but no turn there and dabbled down to fine leg for runs"
"good length on middle and off, defended"

ripper! Draws Roshen forward and this spins on a matchstick past the outside edge
"back of a length, plonked to cover off the back foot"
"outside off, Mathews waves it through to Foakes"
"<strong>Foakes is magic, and so is Adil Rashid!</strong> Prodigious turn, takes the edge and Foakes takes this on the second attempt. Great reactions from the keeper. Sri Lanka in trouble now. Rashid earned that through finally finding a range. He may not get every delivery right, but when he does, he is a joy to behold"
sweeps straight away as this is too much on leg stump
"<strong>huge appeal!</strong> Full and on middle, that may have turned too much. A long conference about a review, but they decide not too"
swept through square leg from outside off
on the pads and worked to square leg
"tight line, staying round the wicket, and it's defended"
"reverse swept powerfully from way outside leg. Rashid gives chase from third man, but can't get there"
"and now he's doing a little dance, making a little love, and getting down tonight. Defended to mid-wicket"
"more accomplished sweeping, this time conventional, and it's down to fine leg for a single"
"drifting on the pads, and nurdled round the corner to short fine leg for a single"
too short and that's worked out to deep mid-wicket. Root's got the man out there as protection
dances down and then dances back. This is going to be one entertaining sing song ding dong
<strong>chipped but short of catching cover</strong>. The fielders are certainly in the game
"more lovely bounce, this comes off the pad as it turns and lobs into the leg side"
too short but Roshen only finds cover off the back foot

tasty turn and bounce back into Roshen. Pings the gloves

pads away one comfortably outside off that doesn't turn much
"short with minimal turn, whipped on the bounce to short leg, who stands tall"
"short once more, whipped to mid on and there's half a thought of a single. Quite rightly, they decline"
"a shimmy down, but just a defend. Roshen willing to be patient"
given some width as Rashid drops it short and it's cut away nicely for four through point
"dangerous! Roshen is down the track, realises he's in no man's land so has to pad it away, and there might have been a faint edge. Foakes dives, but can't get there"
clipped through mid-wicket for an easy single
"Roshen attempts the reverse sweep, but doesn't connect cleanly"
"back of a length, looks to work through mid-wicket but finds only short leg"
"back of a length again, worked to Burns at square leg. Pressure building..."
sharp turn back in once more and it's defended
"off the edge round the corner, but Foakes can't react in time. Things are happening"
another sweep and it's just a single. England trying to turn the screw and get another wicket
"reverse swept in the air! Dickwella didn't time that at all, but he gets lucky as no-one is there at cover area"
"tossed up invitingly full and outside off, left alone"
tighter line and Roshen plays inside the line. Lovely bowling this

"full on off, Dickwella defends"

Nothing zen about that, another wasteful dismissal, Sri Lanka seven down"

tossed up outside off and tapped away
"straightening in the channel, clips the outside edge but runs low and wide of slip"
"big turn for Leach, hit on the arm sweeping... and England decide to <b>review</b> after a lengthy discussion. But the replays immediately suggest the ball was very leg side, this looks a wasted resort to DRS; yep, pitched well outside leg stump, poor call to review that"

floated up full on the stumps and tapped down

"still some turn, but too far outside for Dilruwan to care about playing it"

"round the wicket now, lobbed up on middle and leg, Burns whips him away for another fuss-free single"
pushed through and chopped for a single
"tossed up outside off, this spins away sharply as Jennings thinks twice about cutting"
presses forward to defend
"zipping on with the arm, gets a bit straight and Jennings nurdles away off his legs"
"floated up outside off, Burns thinks about playing and then holds his bat inside as the ball turns through to the keeper"
gets a stride in and pushes this into a gap for one
tossed up wide of the stumps and Burns is beaten attempting a hard sweep
"plays this with a straighter bat, poked into a gap in the covers"
"lobbed up full, Jennings sweeps for one off his front pad"
"flighted, Burns advances and whips to midwicket, who's set back and giving them one... the throw at the non-striker's end is a direct hit, ricocheting away and giving them a second"
tossed up and defended coming forwards
"floated up and Burns again tries to sweep from well outside off, the ball shoots into the covers off the pad and they pinch one more"
"pushed through wide of off, Burns is deep in the crease and slices a cut for a couple"
"bit of drift in for Dulruwan, and turn as Burns closes the face, gets a low leading edge a couple of yards in front of slip"
"flat, dragged down, Burns can chop risk-free through square on the off side"
"flighted outside off, Jennings tucks in with his favourite party move, <del>flossing</del> reverse-sweeping for a boundary to third man"
"quicker arm ball, on the stumps and defended"
"pushed through fast and flat again, Jennings presses out and gets a thickish inside edge"
"lobbed up very full from round the wicket, Jennings clamps down on it"
"flighted, presses out and defends"
"<b>did that carry?</b> Slip isn't certain, neither is Dananjaya, so the umpires will send this up to Chris Gaffaney - soft signal is <b>not out</b>, and it looks to have bounced into the fingers. Good ball, teasing line and it straightened to kiss the edge, but Jennings survives it. The catcher, Dhananjaya de Silva, doesn't look too disgruntled with the outcome"
tossed up and pushed through cover point for one
touch short and wide and Burns cracks it through square off the back foor
"tossed up nice and full on off stump, Jennings blocks"
"darted on the stumps, Burns is down early to sweep a single"
"tossed up and this straightens, clips the outside edge and runs wide of second slip, tight run to backward point but I think Burns was home"
floated up full and clipped into the leg side
"drops short, Jennings is back in the crease and nudges one more through midwicket"
"tossed up outside off, Burns steps across and then gets his gear well out of the way as the ball turns appreciably through to the keeper"
"too straight from Dilruwan, drifting on to leg stuimp and Burns pings another sweep through backward square leg for four - he's cruising along at 91.30"
touch short outside off and Jennings drives off the back foot
"gives this some more air, drags Jennings forward and into a tentative push, past the edge and into the gloves"
"another reverse-sweep from Jennings, picks out backward point"
"Jennings presses forward with bat next to pad, there's a scream from behind the stumps... S Ravi isn't interested. Dickwella seems to have forgotten that you can't be out lbw if you smash it with the bat first"
"full on leg stump, Jennings wears it on the pad attempting to sweep"
floated up and Jennings strokes to the left of mid-off and calls the single early
"another stifled appeal, Jennings leaning out to be hit on the pad, very leg side"
tucked down to the on side
pushed through on the stumps but he's a touch short and Jennings whips him for a couple
"straightening outside off this time, punched through cover point"
"plays off the back foot, steered past the diving Lakmal in the covers"
floated up and defended stoically on off stump

cut with a flourish through backward point as Burns drops back
presses forward to defend
floated up and blocked resolutely once more
full and flighted and Jennings smothers it again
"oof, that's taken off! Just when we were beginning to think the pitch had nodded off... Big turn from just outside off stump, Burns aiming a cut and then thinking better of it"
"loses his line down the leg side, Burns gets a bit of bat on it to squirt the ball past Dickwella - <b>and that boundary takes England into the lead</b>"
"floated up on leg once more, Burns seizes on the chance to sweep again and crunches four more!"
"goes back and chops forcefully behind point, well stopped"
pushed through and prodded away off the back foot
"sliding down the leg side, big appeal from Dickwella (natch)... Lakmal is asking his players if he should review, but there's little enthusiasm for that, in contrast to the appeal. Think it brushed the pad"
"stabbed through the covers off the back foot, <b>raising the fifty stand between these two</b> - although sadly this will never be included in their stats for opening together"
"tossed up and he goes for the sweep, doesn't connect this time"
pushed through outside off
floated up and defended on the front foot
"overpitched, Burns stretches out and lashes the ball square, beats the dive of the fielder in the deep - that's four more!"
"tossed up and worked away to the leg side, they decline a risky run"
"fired in on the stumps, defended with bat tight to pad on middle stump"
flat and blocked coming across on off
"sliding in with the arm from round the wicket, Jennings tickles it away for one"
plopped on a full length and Burns defends
"full, driven through extra cover, Mathews is across from long-off but he misfields to give Burns a second"
"quicker ball, beats Burns on the inside, huge lbw appeal from Sri Lanka... and meanwhile the ball has scuttled to the boundary! Lakmal asks for the <b>review</b>, though I think Burns has got outside the line here. Yep, that's another poor bit of reviewing by Sri Lanka, Dickwella leading the chorus again. Burns survives and SL have burned a review"
drops a touch short and Jennings fires a back-foot punch square for two
"dollied up on off stump, tapped towards extra cover"
"flighted, this spins away as Jennings presses out, left through to the keeper"
goes back in the crease and dabs the ball square
"tossed up full and spinning sharply, left alone"
"beautifully bowled! <b>But there's no edge</b>, despite sucking the batsman in and then smuggling it past the forward push"
shifts back and punches into the covers
"<b>sooo close</b>! The part-timer gets an offbreak to go on with the arm and Burns, letting the ball go, heaves a sigh of relief as it goes past the off stump"
a tad short and Burns rocks back to cut to the sweeper
lunges forward to defend a good length ball outside off
"good batting, plays the original line of the ball, coming forward as far as he could to smother the turn"
a hint of width and Jennings leans forward to drive through to the sweeper
"lovely shot. It's tossed up on middle. Jennings knows he can reach it - he's tall - and then brings out the sweep shot, hands over the ball, wrists working to keep it down"
"launches it to the midwicket boundary. Not the most perfect connection. Might even have been a bit of a top-edge, with Burns not to the pitch of the offbreak because it dips on him. Goes through with the shot and benefits big time"
"<b>misses the sweep</b> as Akila corrects his line, targeting outside off and getting a bit of turn. Might have been a touch fuller too"
"creams it to the man at deep point as he steps away from the ball, earning the room to cut off the stumps"
a little too much flight there and Jennings ushers the full toss on middle to deep point with a reverse sweep
"that's the legbreak, which Burns picks, goes back and defends in front of off stump"
"drifting in with the angle from round the wicket, Jennings defuses it where short leg might have been"
rock-solid defence again as he moves forward to a good length ball on off stump
"plays late, close to the body and with soft hands. Jennings is on point today"
"<b>bit of an outside edge</B> as de Silva hits an in-between length, not letting Jennings and his giant front foot stride close to the ball"
shifts back to a flatter delivery on leg stump and blocks
opens the face as he slides back to cut the ball behind point
"<B>reverse sweep goes straight to slip</b>! Eish. That's a bad way to go. Jennings is very good with that shot, but here he premeditates, and that gives just enough warning to the bowler. Akila responds by pushing the ball through quicker, pulling the length back, getting that little bit of bounce that is the biggest enemy to cross-bat shots."
"starts with a sweep shot, which comes off the top edge and goes to long leg"
"brings down a straight bat - takes extra care to do so because even though the ball keeps drifting into leg stump, it will dip and it will turn and a closed face is a big no-no in such cases. Single to mid-on"
"shapes for the little scoop to fine leg, but Akila spots this too and fires the ball in quick and outside off. This one stays low though and Root has to block"
"hammers the full toss to deep square leg. That's the legbreak gone wrong. England's captain likes getting off to quick starts. He's got one here, in a very important innings"
goes round the wicket for an offbreak angled across the right-hander. Root gets to the pitch and defends
blocks on middle and leg
"keeps it nice and tight with the stumps, with a flatter trajectory as well, Burns can only dab it down"
"a little more air this time and, immediately, he goes for the sweep"
cuts the quicker ball on middle to point
slow turn allows Burns to do what he pleases - in this case make room to cut to cover
"<b>uppish</b>! But there's no one at mid-off to gobble it up! Shenanigans from the pitch as a simple, good-length offbreak holds up and bounces a lot more than Burns expects. And he's halfway into the cut shot and just can't pull out."
shimmies down the pitch to flick the length ball outside off to deep midwicket
sweeps the full one drifting into middle and leg. Can't hit the gap at square leg
"<b>beats him</b> as the left-arm spinner slows it down, and pitches the ball on off stump, making Root play with a straighter bat and almost getting the benefit for it"
reads the length so well. He knows it's full enough to reach with a front foot stride and then sweeps the ball bullishly to the midwicket boundary. Straight of midwicket even!
"<b>misses the sweep</b> and that's because of a lovely bit of deception from Pushpakumara. He lobs it up, tempting the shot, but the pace is slow, and there's extra revs on the ball, getting it to dip under the bat and do him in"
"full on off stump, defends"
"tosses it up on off stump, blocks"
<b>big turn</b> as Akila lures Burns forward with a tossed up delivery that grips the pitch and veers past the outside edge like it's allergic
"<b>first Test ffity</b> and it's come at a vital time for England. Lovely sweep shot, getting right forward, head over the ball, wrists keeping it down, an ode to his ability to pick length early. Good stuff, #NewChef."
whips the shortish delivery on middle away through midwicket
"<B>excitement</b> as Root steps down the pitch, is beaten by the lack of flight and nearly pops a catch to short leg."
sweeps the tossed up delivery on middle and leg past short fine leg. Lakmal's the man there and he's been struggling with some kind of niggle on his leg. <b>England lead hits fifty</b>
"sweeps it away to deep square leg and he can do it without any trouble because his front foot is well outside off stump, ruling out lbw"
stays back to a length ball on middle but then has to do well to defend it since it keeps a tad low
"little lap sweep from Root, pushing his weight forward and just giving a bit of direction to the ball. No power in the shot yet it gives him two runs"
"neat little dab to point as Root gets legside of the ball, waits for it to turn, and wallops it"
"<b>dip, turn and nearly the edge</b>. Root isn't quite to the pitch of the ball and that means he's opened himself up to a bit of trouble."
"<b>top edge</B> lobs over the keeper, and goes past the backtracking slip fielder. It's another sweep - England have committed big time to it and it's... eh... got mixed results so far"
"goes for the reverse sweep, with Akila going round the wicket."
pitches on middle and spins past Root's legs into the keeper's gloves
"goes back to a fairly full delivery and as a result, he has to bring that straight bat down in double quick time"
"<b>huge lbw appeal</b> but umpire Erasmus says no. And Sri Lanka, having once been bitten, are now shy about the review. This one is much closer though, Root having lunged forward to block and being done in by the turn. Beats him on the inside edge. Looks adjacent.... <b>Ball-tracking says it would go right over the stumps</b>"
"quick and full on middle, Root blunts it better, that front foot not interfering as much as it did the last ball"
sweeps the full ball on off stump to deep square leg
"gets forward to block on middle, but the ball keeps drifting in and picks up an inside edge before wandering to midwicket"
"goes round the wicket but Burns keeps coming down the track against the ball spinning into him. He may be beaten on the lack of flight, but still manages to flick it away past short leg"
"slows it down, tosses it up, draws Root forward, who blocks with soft hands and exploits the gap at midwicket"
"oh, that's outstanding! Sri Lanka are trying to cramp the left-hander for room, that's why the left-arm spinner is coming round the wicket, but this ball is short, Burns shifts back quickly, making room as well and carves it to the point boundary"
"<b>gives him out lbw but Burns has reviewed</b>. DRS is only taken after a long chat with Root. So it's possible he doesn't have an inside edge. He does, however, have a long stride forward while he plays the sweep shot to a ball from round the stumps. Pitches on middle, hits on middle, hitting the leg stump, three reds and Burns has got to go, taking one of England's reviews with him"
"full on off stump, safely negotiates it"
"<b>huge turn, and the lbw appeal is huge as well</b>. Dilruwan is coming from round the wicket, it pitches outside off, darts in like a snake to hit Root's pads even as he thinks he has it covered. It's likely the impact is outside off, but Lakmal goes for the review anyway. Clearly he's being fed wrong information from the bowler and close-in fielders. Replay confirms that - a impact a good distance outside off - and Sri Lanka have lost all their reviews in this innings"
gets down low and sweeps the short ball on leg stump to long leg
"<b>pins him in front</b> and now it's England's turn to think about a review and Stokes has gone for it. Quicker delivery from Dilruwan, pitching at a full length on off stump. Moves in with the angle from round the wicket, and straightens just enough to be troublesome. The left-hander misses the sweep and ball-tracking says it's hitting leg stump. England have lost both their reviews as well!"
goes back to a length ball on off stump and blocks it
"runs down the pitch to take it on the full and whips it to the midwicket boundary. Phew, the power on that shot! Mathews is down there, running to his right, but ends up over-running in the end"
another trip down the pitch as Buttler works it down to long-on
shifts his weight back and cracks the short ball on off stump past the left of cover. Brute force again
"tosses it up, getting the ball to drift into the right-hander. Buttler drives smoothly to cover"
"plays for the turn, and is looking a tad uncertain about it, largely because he's not to the pitch of the ball and then has to guess what the pitch will do. Manages an inside edge to midwicket"
"violent sweep shot, taking the ball from way outside off - that's how you don't get lbw playing the shot and also have the chance to bring in all your power"
"pushes it through on middle, Root defends, taking care to play the line of the ball and not the turn expected"
"sweep again, making sure his front foot is to the pitch of the ball on off stump, which allows him to smother the possibility of spin"
flicks the loopy delivery off his leg stump to deep midwicket
"sweeps again - he's not been allowed to get down on his knees for the shot because of the pace on the ball, and the length being so full - but Root manages to pull the shot off"
steps down the wicket and hammers the full delivery on leg stump to long-on
"shimmies down the pitch but Dilruwan pulls the length back enough that Root has to think about the turn, and therefore, can only nudge the ball to midwicket"
"pushes it through on off stump, Root goes right back to keep it out"
"<b>huge appeal for caught behind</B> but umpire Erasmus shakes his head. Sharp turning offbreak, which Root tries to glance away. Might just have brushed his thigh pad"
"gets himself into position to play the inside out cover drive, but sensing the dip on the ball, he holds back his power"
"shortish on middle, Buttler punches through the covers"
"loops it up just outside off, Root defends it"
sweeps a ball that is roughly in the same vicinity of the one he defended earlier in the over - full and outside off
"makes him reach out as he drives to long-off, Pushpakumara getting the ball to dip late"
"tosses it up on middle, Root blocks it and that's lunch"
"tossed up on middle and leg, defended pressing forwards"
"<b>dropped!</b> But that would have been a screamer, had Kusal Mendis pulled it off... Aggression from Buttler to his second ball after lunch, uppish but hit fiercely and Mendis did well to get fingertips on it diving to his left at short midwicket"
tossed up on the stumps and flicked away with the spin
"tossed up and clipped through square leg, nearly place for a couple"
flighted and worked down into the on side
"<b>skips through everyone!</b> This was hard spun and beat Buttler's expansive drive, <i>shaved</i> the top of off stump and then zipped past Dickwella, too! A lick of paint from bowling him, there"
floated up and worked away to the leg side
"oh, close again, <b>grubs through past leg stump!</b> This has just flatlined from a length on middle and leg, scooting past Buttler's heels as he prodded frantically"
tossed up straight and defended
"flighted on off, Buttler taps into the covers"
leans on a solid forward defensive
"tossed up nice and full, tickled along the carpet to the man at extra cover"
"dances down, Dilruwan fires it leg side but Root manages to shovel it away for one"
"struck on the pads attempting to sweep! Erasmus unmoved! That looked mighty close, maybe sliding on with the arm from round the wicket... No reviews for either side now, remember"
tossed up and flicked through the leg side with more control
floated up full and Root leans on a forward defensive
driven down the ground coming forwards
"<b>is that another drop?</b> There was a sound as Buttler chopped across the line playing back, went straight into and out of the gloves"
tapped away on off stump
"angled in and dabbed to the leg side, big gap for a single there"
tossed up and defended coming across
"flighted, outside off and Buttler brings out the reverse now, paddle for one"
"full but too straight, Root is down on one knee, <b>slams a sweep through backward square leg!</b> This game ain't slowing down, England's lead over 100"
"flatter, Root lines it up on defence on off"
"floated up full from round the wicket, Buttler defends softly"
"use the feet, not to the pitch but he kicks it away into the off side for one"
"flighted, spins a touch as Root drops back, defended late in front of the timbers"
"good bowling, the arm ball drifts across Root as he props forward, past the outside edge and into the gloves"
floated up straighter and he's nudged off the pads
goes back and across and works it away for one
"pushed through outside off, Buttler dabs it behind point"
"tight lines, defended on the front foot"
floated up and blocked
"angled in a touch flatter, this skids on to hit the front pad with Root defending... Heading down leg"
"wheeling away on the stumps, turned into the leg side"
pushed through and Buttler stands up tall in defence
"over the wicket now, Root drops back and guides it behind square"
"tossed up, Buttler reverses the hands in a trice, whips an aggressive Bizarro-sweep through point for two"
"big movement across, no turn and he ends up defending late but safely down"
"floated up and swept in the classical fashion, just one through backward square"
"now Root starts switching it up, too, reverse-dabbed through gully for another single"
"now that's just good old-fashioned power and timing, bit of width outside off and <b>Buttler opens up to hammer a cut through cover point!</b> Bash-tastic"
tossed up full and Root taps it away
presses forward and smothers the ball
"flatter delivery on the stumps, Root drops back and works it away to leg"
"lobbed up on off, full and flighted and Buttler defends"
plunges forward and shows it a straight bat once again
"better from Pushpakumara, diligently probing around off stump, bit of dip and turn and Buttler blocks watchfully"
"round the wicket, Root pushes it back"
tossed up and spinning leg side as Root sticks out a pad
"skips out and drills the ball along the turf, Dananjaya fields"

touch short and worked away off the hip
"floated up on the stumps, Root content to nudge it away defensively"
"punched back to the left of the bowler, who gets down but fails to cut it off and Buttler takes one"
tossed up and defended on off stump
"this squirts through past Dickwella on the leg side, looks like Root just got some glove on it sweeping"
"tossed up, the ball bounces outside off and Root carves it away, nicely timed for a boundary"
"short and wide and he cuts again, this comes off the toe of the bat and runs fine, Lakmal does well to drag it in just in front of the rope... <b>but three runs takes Root to fifty</b>, a vital knock from the captain"
lobbed up and driven through mid-off to the man set back
"round the wicket, floated up and prodded away"
flat and clipped behind square on the leg side
"tossed up around the line of off, Root bends over it in defence"
"gets low to sweep this time, just a little paddle away through backward square leg"
"goes over the wicket, full outside off and Buttler reverse-sweeps it through backward point for a couple"
"oh, he's played on! <b>Another batsman falls sweeping!</b> Buttler trying to reverse again, but the line was straighter, cramped him for the shot and a thick bottom edge bounced down and into the stumps! Change of pace might have done for him, as well, but it was heading down the leg side until he dragged it on to the woodwork... Second time that stroke has done for him in this match"
"tossed up and Root reverse-swats - <b>just wide of the diving slip!</b> Never change, England"
"on the stumps, defended"
"bowling over the wicket, pitching on middle and leg, Root blocks"

"<b>mullered into the grass banks!</b> Slog-sweep from Moeen, he's read the instruction manual! Nailed it, too"

blocked on the front foot
"flat and skidding on as Moeen goes back, thuds into the pads... Heading down? Maybe an inside edge"
"shouts of excitement around the bat, but the ball drops safely"
"lovely stroke, not seen many runs scored in the V today but Root knows his way around a straight drive, pings this fluidly back down the ground"

"down the track, clipped on the up to deep midwicket"
"round the wicket, met on the back foot with a full-faced poke to cover"
"<strong>sweeping again, gone again!</strong> Looked very adjacent to the line of off stump, no reviews for either side remember. Moeen goes cheaply again, and this Test swings again. I reckon he was a bit unlucky there, the ball wasn't spinning sharply, just angling back in from outside off, but he needed to lay bat on it really!"
"a legbreak to the right-handed Foakes, stabbed off the pads to the leg side"

open-faced glide to point
"held back through the air, eased into the off side"
"crunched on the back foot, to the off side"

"advancing to the pitch, stabbed down into the deck"
"flicked energetically to long-on, good use of the feet once more"

solidly into line to defend back down the pitch
"inside-edged prod, down to backward square"
"sliding down the leg side, Root stabs with a full face and deflects behind square, but short fine leg gathers"
"tossed up outside off, wide on the crease, Foakes is forward with his bat and pad together"
"sharp turn from way outside off, Foakes half-plays, half-leaves, as the ball lobs into the off side"
"swept again, he does nail it well when the shot is on. Backward square gathers a fast-moving ball"

"shortish, punched to the off side, cover prevent the single"

"on the walk, tucked down square and Foakes turns down the run... Root scuttles back and then gets a run anyway thanks to an overthrow at the striker's end"
"goes for the yorker, sliding leg side and Foakes only needs to tickle it fine, glanced to the rope for easy runs. Maybe a hint of reverse for Lakmal, though"
"shouts of excitement as Root slogs leg side, <b>but the ball doesn't carry to the man on the rope at midwicket!</b> Not Root's most astute attacking shot of the day"

worked off the pads to the leg side
flighted and straightening a touch as Foakes presses out to smother it

"straightening on the stumps, hits the front pad - <b>given!</b> No reviews, so Root will have to drag himself away. He was, of course, sweeping (reverse this time); don't think he got any bat or glove on the ball, and it looked pretty adjacent, turning down the line of middle stump from round the wicket. Nevertheless, a fabulous innings from the England captain and he's given his side a chance"
"oh, <b>bowled him first ball!</b> No lower-order heroics from Scurran today, that was perfectly on line from Dananjaya, spinning past the outside edge to nudge off the off bail... They check with the third umpire, so subtle was the deflection, but all is good. Two in two for Dananjaya, bags his five-for, and this match is swinging again!"

"sharp spin, Rashid is back on his sticks... <b>Up goes umpire Ravi's finger!</b> It turned a long way, but probably would have been hitting leg stump, given how deep in the crease he had gone. But hang on, looks like <i>there was an inside edge!</i> Reviews blown, though, so Rash is toast"
worked away to the leg side
""
"ooh, <b>so close to the outside edge!</b> Jagging off the pitch as Foakes presses out and is beaten"
floated up and worked away
"dabbed behind point going back, Foakes wants the single to get the strike for the next over, Anderson has to hustle... but he beats the direct hit comfortably enough"
floated up and Anderson reverse-sweeps for four! More precious runs for England here

"very full, looping into the blockhole to be defended"
"open-faced prod into the leg side, defending the middle and leg line"

worked to the leg side
"head over the ball, blotted back to the bowler. Up comes mid-on to save the single ..."
"<B>hooned into the stands!</b> Down the pitch, place-slogged over the leg-side, if that is even a shot. Chose his spot very deliberately, then tonked it to bring up a very fine fifty"
"reverse sweep straight away, but straight to short third man"
nice turn from just short of a good length. Anderson plays inside the line
big attempt at a sweep shot. Hits the hip and goes to slip
<strong>the spin does for deep square leg!</strong> Hit hard out to the deep square leg and Pushpakumara makes an absolute pickle of fielding that. Beaten comfortably by the turn
solid push forward as Anderson defends
dead batted by Anderson as Akila goes full
"turn on offer, hits the pad, Dickwella starts an appeal worthy of waking the dead, but then opts against it as he's hit outside the line"
tally ho! Foakes dances down the track and plonks it over cow corner. This is going to be entertaining!
dragged down and pulled to deep square leg. <strong>No single taken</strong>
solidly blocked outside off as Dilruwan pushes this through
"pushed down the ground and Anderson calls Foakes through for two. In my view, England should look to take whatever they can"

"round the wicket, on off stump, defended"
worked through square leg but nothing taken
driven to short cover. No chance of a run there
"flight on offer, driven nicely but no single taken"
pushed to short cover. Now they'll start looking at t'single

"a muted appeal for caught behind as this is fired down leg, with Anderson looking to work it round the corner"
"back of a length, bunted to short cover"
"goes for a delicious sweep. Unfortunately for Sri Lanka, all he's done is wafted at thin air"
<strong>and it lasts just one ball.</strong> Anderson is playing for turn. Gets an inside edge and it's pushed into the stumps
"on the money straight away, a smidgen of swing, and Karunaratne defends"
hangs it on a good length outside off. Left alone like a watchful owl
<strong>fires in the yorker</strong>. Donkey Kong (DK) digs it out
on the hips this time and DK becomes Mr Tickle to work it round the corner for the first runs of the chase
back onto a good line. Solid defence from Karunaratne off back of a good length
"again, there to be worked off back of a length, and Karunaratne helps himself to four more down to fine leg. Not Anderson's finest ever first over"
very full and Kaushal pushes it out to deep cover for an easy single
"<strong>beaten!</strong> Karunaratne was playing for turn, there wasn't any, and he's jabbing at thin air"
defended late and jabs it down to third man. Karunaratne is playing for our dear old friend non existent turn
pushed nicely off the back foot to deep cover for another single

"very, very full, jammed out to cover"
"good length on off, solid defence"
good carry from a good length outside off. Left lone

"a hint of swing on the same line, pushed to mid-wicket"
"fuller length, pushed back to Anderson. A maiden"
"back of a length on the pads, clipped through mid-wicket and they get a couple"
slow turn and defended to backward point
"hook, line, sinker and the fish is in the fryer! <strong>Brilliant from Leach</strong>, drawing Kushal to come dancing thanks to the flight. He comes out for that dance, but he doesn't expect as much turn. Beaten, and Foakes whips the bails off quicker than Magnum PI. First wicket for England"
"the arm ball hits new man Dhananjaya on the pads, but always sliding down leg"
"driven out to deep cover, but that sort of shot early in his innings will give Leach confidence"
worked to short mid-wicket. Ends a great over for England
"goes full and on off stump, defended by DDS"
puts it in the 5th stump corridor. Dhananjaya says no thanks
"closer line, defended into cover point, and a loud bark of no"
back of a length once more and defended

finishes the over in the corridor once more. Anderson building pressure nicely for England
"full and flighted once more, Karunaratne comes down and pushes to long on"
"big lunge by Dhanan, ends up pushing it back to Leach"
"oh my Starburst, Opal Fruits and lucky charms! <strong>What a catch by Jennings at short leg!</strong> That's brilliant! A bit of a needless shot from Dhananjaya, as this is on leg stump. He should be sweeping this, but instead pushes forward. It's airborne enough that Jennings can get his mitt under it and pulls off a blinder. Sri Lanka wobbling more than jelly being carried down a pot hole fuelled road"
"flights it outside off. Defended by Kusal Mendis, who I'm sure didn't expect to be in this early"
"<strong>crazy attempt at a slog sweep over cow corner!</strong> It beats both Foakes and Stokes, but bonkers shot so early in your innings. That was not played with control"
pushed to short cover and that's another great over for England
round the wicket outside off. Left alone
tentatively pushed off the back foot through the covers
tip and run through point as Karunaratne is relatively solid
"full outside off, pushed to mid on. Will be interesting to see how Mendis will play this"
"<strong>you maverick Kusal!</strong> Wants a single that's never there, is sent back, but gets it as Buttler misses his shy at the stumps"
"angling onto the pads, worked through square leg for one"
flicked past short fine leg and they get back for a couple as Burns has to swoop round like a pigeon to cut this off
"tossed up outside off, defended to Buttler at short mid-wicket. A puff the size of Portsmouth came up then!"
pushed down the ground and they get through for a single
driven firmly to short cover. Leach has Mendis in all three innings so far
"big appeal for LBW as Mendis attempts to sweep. <strong>We have ourselves a review!</strong> It wasn't given, but this was very full. Front foot is fine. I tell you what, that looks closer than I first thought. No bat involved, so down to ball tracking. It's crashing into leg. <strong>Leach has four in four v Kusal!</strong> England are rampant!"
pushes with the turn to short cover
"angling back in, DK knows this is wide enough to leave"
jammed off the back foot through square leg and they get through for a single
tentative from Mathews outside off. Dangling his bat but gets a big enough chunk on it to come out of the middle. Not entirely convincing though

off the thick inside edge out to short mid-wicket
back of a good length and cut out to deep cover
solid from DK as Leach keeps it full

"gets down low to paddle this fine, won't quite run all the way for a boundary"
tossed up full and defended
"flight and bite, <b>but the edge flies between keeper and slip!</b> So nearly another for England, but Stokes just couldn't react in time, this time - zipped off the bat as Karunaratne pushed forwards, diverted over the gloves and past the groping Stokes"
presses forward and dabs one into a gap at cover
lobbed up on the stumps and Karu defends

tossed up and swept for one into the leg side
"strokes the ball towards point, they need to hustle through but do so"

"oof, that's a gimme, full toss from Moeen and <b>Karu twocks it unceremoniously through midwicket</b> for a welcome boundary"
comes forward and tickles one through the covers
"<b>dropped!</b> Well, that would have been extraordinary, too... Stokes holds his head as if he's just dropped a dolly, but in reality he did well to get a full paw on the ball, a reaction chance by his bootlaces but again it doesn't quite stick!"
"goes back and steers behind point, <b>raises the Sri Lanka 50</b>"
"full toss, <b>launched into the air over mid-on</b>... and it lands safely, having initially looked like Mathews had holed out, bounces away for four!"
comes across and punches this for a single to deep cover

"touch short, Mathews has time to rock back and cut to the cover sweeper"
"Foakes leaps across as Karunaratne paddles the ball safely for a couple, <b>causing hoots and cheers around the ground for his fifty</b> - second of the match. Can he go on and play a match-winner?"
floated up and worked nonchalantly off the legs for one more
prodded into the covers

Rashid dives across to his left but can't cut off Mathews' drive
"full outside off, spinning back as Karunaratne sticks out his front pad... outside the line but playing no shot, don't think it came back far enough"

<strong>big appeal for caught behind</strong> as Mathews plays for turn that there isn't. Scuttles under the bottom edge
<strong>100 up for Sri Lanka</strong> as Mathews cuts through third man as Rashid drops it short
confidently played off the back foot out to deep cover. A solid start for the hosts since lunch on the whole
"<strong>YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!</strong> That is outstanding. Jennings has taken another epic. Actually, it's Foakes. But that is brilliant anticipation from the pair of them. Karunaratne has got down to sweep this. Jennings has anticipated it and gets going. It's swept hard and Jennings can't hold on, but parries it to Foakes who is also alert. Forget relay catches on the boundary; that is up there with any of them"

off the outside edge to backward point
"more on middle this time, solidly blocked"
"bite off the pitch back of a length, pushed to backward point"

<strong>just</strong> short of Stokes. England now rampant once more
solid defence this time from Roshen
cut hard but backward point cuts it off once more
another thick outside edge through cover. Thinks of a non existent single
defended tentatively off the back foot. Rashid has found his funk
driven on the bounce to cover. Sri Lanka under the pump

very full and Roshen just about digs it out
full again and dug out
"tries to sweep, but doesn't connect cleanly. Roshen does not look as comfortable as he did last innings"
a bit too leg side from Leach and it's a delicate paddle round the corner and they get back for three
on leg and worked round the corner for one
"short, Mathews rocks back and punches out to cover for one"
off the thick outside edge to backward point
tentatively pushed forward
"the slider, and Roshen just about gets enough bat on this. Not sure he read that"

forced to go back as Leach darts it in back of a length and defended
"short and width on offer, cut to deep backward point"
"Roshen drawn forward, and it's defended"
"beaten by vicious turn. Just about survives. Meanwhile, Sam Curran has been seen in the changing rooms nursing his side strain. He won't be taking to the field today."
Mathews leaves one that he appreciates is the leggie. Risky leaving anything to Rashid though
"short once more, Mathews waits for the turn and works it out through cover"
silly amounts of turn. Beats Roshen's bat by the size of a football pitch
not as much turn and again worked out to backward point
more on the leg stump this time and Mathews works it past short leg
down the track for a small shimmy and worked through mid-wicket for a single
played inside the line and this goes past the edge
"<strong>classy!</strong> Too full from Leach, Roshen leans into this and caresses it through the covers"

lunges forward and defends
full once more and pushed back to Rashid
"big turn from short of a length, worked out to deep cover"
quicker ball sliding through. Roshen plays it very late

short again and easily worked away. Rashid gone a bit too short of late
"flighted outside leg, defended"
"worked off the hips to Anderson at fine leg, who underarms this in"
"lobbed up to where short leg would have been, Foakes can't see it in time to react"
"goes for the sweep, but doesn't get a run"
dead batted as Leach keeps it on off
release shot for Roshen as Leach goes too short this time. Some cheer for the home fans

"brings out the sweep as Leach goes more on leg, worked down to Anderson at fine leg"
"probing line and length on middle, Mathews defends"
"<strong>there's Mathews 50.</strong> Cut out to deep cover and they trot through for a single. A fine knock so far, but a long, long way to go"
big turn from outside leg to outside off. Defended to slip
full and pushed through mid-wicket. They scamper a single
"perhaps Jennings is human after all! Inside edge, on to pads and it actually hits Jennings on the helmet. Scrap that, replays show no edge!"
worked down the ground
"very full on middle, driven back to Leach"
cut out to deep cover point once more
wristy whippage through square leg as Leach bowls a full bunger
on middle and a big prod forward from Mathews

another solid defence to finish the over. A real game of cat and mouse going on here
"a shimmy from Mr Silva, but defended to short cover"
"back of a length, pushed through point and they run through for a single"
cut out to deep point. Sri Lanka in milkingtons mode
"<strong>oh that's a ripper!</strong> Roshen wanted to shimmy down, but it absolutely spanks off the pitch past the outside edge"
"and again Roshen wants to dance, but has to defend"
"brings out the googly, very full, and Roshen defends"
"slightly shorter, defended off the back foot"
solid defence from Mathews as Leach lands it on a length
powerfully cut as Leach goes a bit too short
genuine edge as Roshen pushes at one outside off. Flies through a vacant third slip region and away for four. The school kids at the ground are loving this
on off this time and Roshen defends
beaten by some sharp turn. Roshen and Mathews building themselves a nice trench here
"back of a length, defended to short cover"
Buttler has to dive to stop this one as Mathews punches it to him at short cover
on leg and that's defended once more
"<strong>a sensational googly</strong>, Mathews did not pick that and it just about whistles over the stumps"
"Roshen unsure whether to go forward or back, and in the end has to defend"
<strong>150 up</strong> for Sri Lanka as Roshen cuts it out to deep cover
"pitched up by Leach, Roshen defends back"
Roshen plays inside the line after thinking about chasing
and again. Sensible batting from Roshen
forward from Roshen and a solid defence
short and plenty of turn. Roshen leaves well alone
full and Roshen gets out to smother it
nearly a mix up as Mathews and Rohen partake in a game of yes no for a single that's never there
Mathews goes back into dead batting the ball
"back of a length, turn there, but only finds cover"
another cut out to deep point and another easy single
Roshen's more indecisive and plays this very late to backward point
"yorker length, driven to short cover. And that's <strong>drinks</strong>."
"pushed through and driven off the back foot, Yorkshire's Jonny Bairstow is on as sub fielder at deep extra cover"
tossed up and defended softly on off
"pushed through, Roshen drops back and dabs towards point"
"scudding into the pads, England go up... but it's somewhat half-hearted, Leach signalling it was probably heading down leg. Marais Erasmus was unmoved"
"floated up, straightens a touch and he gets across to block"
quicker and straighter but again Roshen covers the line
floated up full and worked down the ground
"flights the googly, spinning back in from outside off but Roshen seemed to pick it and stuck out a pad, grinned back at the bowler"
"big turn from around leg stump, <b>struck on the pad</b>... S Ravi turns down the appeal! Was it outside leg? England ask for a <b>review</b>, but I think that's optimistic. Yep, landed an inch or two outside leg stump, so England lose a review"
"oi vey, another ripper from outside leg! This explodes from the pitch and jumps across to Roshen to hit him on the back thigh pad... but no bat involved and the ball lands safely"
tossed up and pushed through mid-on
Mathews nudges into a gap
"flattish on off, Mathews is back in the crease and pokes to cover"
"touch short, Mathews is across and crunches a drive in front of the sweeper, hit too well or else there might have been two on offer"
tossed up and driven square on the front foot
"tossed up and tucked into the leg side, came off the inside edge"
"slow and flighty, straightens a touch as Roshen watches it on to the middle of his forward defensive"
gets a stride in and defends once more
tossed up and defended softly coming forwards
punched into the off side
"floated up and turned down to the leg side, past the close catcher for one"
"tossed up on off, leans into a forward block"
again plants the front foot and shows it a straight bat
"flighted, lots of air, plenty of revs... not a jot of interest from the batsman as it spins through to the keeper outside off"
"floated up from over the wicket, Mathews works for one through midwicket"
"too full, in the slot to drive and that's what Roshen does, slam his foot on the accelerator through the covers for four"
pushes forward and defends
"concerted appeal from England, <b>Roshen struck on the knee roll going back</b>... Erasmus shakes his head! No review this time, though it looked closer than the Rashid lbw shout to me"
"spinning in from outside off, plays this one safely down"
worked away with the spin through the leg side
floated up and pushed away on the off side
tapped away on the front foot
sliding down the leg side and it flicks the pad as he tries to work across the line
"full on the stumps, defended"
"dragged down, a dirty half-trakcer from Rashid but Roshen can barely reach it and toes a pull to mid-on"
"flighted, outside off, pushed into the covers"
superbly struck! Full outside off and Mathews reverses the hands to <i>bludgeon</i> the ball through backward point for four
"flighted, <b>this clips the inside edge</b> but slides behind the man under the helmet and away for one more"
"uses the feet, Roshen comes out and bashes a single through mid-on"
"flatter, Mathews gets a stride in and then plays it with his pad"
"'HOOOOOWWWWAAAAARRGGGHH!' was the cry from Foakes, and they're going to check this... He took the ball down the leg side and then flung it at the stumps as Mathews began to move his back foot; but it was just about still grounded at the point the bails were broken, so he's okay"
comes across and taps the ball away
comes across and steers through the covers
"flatter outside off, Mathews cuts in front of square"
"hit on the back pad, <b>he's being peppered</b>... but that pitched outside leg stump again, only a muted appeal this time"
floated up and driven through cover point coming across
pushed gently into the off side
"tossed up and straightening off the pitch, defended around the line of off"
"presses forward, tapped softly to the off side and he sets off... but Foakes is haring after it and Mathews quickly sends his partner back"
"spin, plays it well, tucked to the on side"
"has this got him?! Beaten on the inside flicking to leg, the catch is taken at slip... No dice from umpire Erasmus but England are adamant and go to the DRS! Did he get a tickle on it...? <b>Yes, just a feather!</b> Brushed the edge as he squeezed the bat down, on to pad and then Root claimed the catch! Roshen falls, Moeen with the breakthrough, a <i>huge</i> blow for Sri Lanka"
"tossed up full and swept, struck it well but Rashid gets around to prevent four at deep backward square"
"rolls out the reverse-sweep now, <b>nailed through backward point for four!</b> If there's a man in the SL line-up likely to take England's frenetic sweep-or-die (or both) approach, it's Dickwella"
pushed through and nudged into the leg side
"flat outside off, Mathews goes back and cuts one"
"round the wicket, premeditated reverse from Dickwella, Stokes had moved across to his left but it skips by him low on the inside - bump ball, gets him three"
"stays round the wicket, rips it out of the rough, Mathews struck on the pads playing back... Not dissimilar to the ball that got KL Rahul at The Oval a couple of months ago, but Mathews made sure he got something in the way"
"short and spinning across, room for Mathews to free the arms and club him through cover for four"
"another boundary, <b>roundhouse smashed to the midwicket fence!</b> Poor ball from Rashid and Mathews increases the pressure with a no-nonsense biff"
"back over the wicket, tossed up and blocked on off stump"
pushed through and patted away on the stumps
"miscued, high over cover, <b>but it lands safely!</b> That wasn't really a full-blooded attacking shot, just a misbegotten poke, Dickwella lucky to get away with it"
"tossed up from over the wicket, Mathews sweeps calmly for one more"
"flighted, shuffles into line, swept off his front pad"
"pushed through and Mathews is deep in the crease, flicking off the back foot, short leg gets in the way"
presses forward and defends on off stump
"pushed through and defended into the covers, Buttler is swiftly on it but they scamper through"
"stays round the wicket, lobbed up on leg stump, clipped through midwicket"
presses forward on off stump
"goes for the sweep, the shot which did him in the first innings, picks out backward square leg"
tapped into the covers coming forwards
pushed through and Dickwella shows it a straight bat
"tossed up, spinning through and Foakes whips off the bails in one fluid movement, both feet were grounded"
goes back and jabs the ball down to the leg side
"woof, this spits like an angry llama! Mathews was aiming a reverse-sweep and Stokes had made a move, think it hit him on the arm and looped between keeper and slip"
"tossed up, Dickwella goes for the slog-sweep, crunched to the midwicket boundary! <b>The SL target comes down below 100</b>"
"swept again, flat and behind square this time, Rashid gets around in the deep to cover"
presses forward to defend
"round the wicket, Mathews can't get it away to the leg side"
leans forward and defends on leg stump
goes back and whips to midwicket where Buttler gets down to prevent a single
"flat delivery, Mathews punched through mid-on"
floated up and blocked on the front foot
"flat outside off, Dickwella is going to slice and dice as ever, swatted in front of point and the man in the deep can't cut it off! Four more, he's raced to 20, putting the pressure back on England"
tossed up and worked into a gap
goes for the sweep and picks up one more
"spinning in and nudged off the hip, they push for the single as the throw is fired in from short fine leg - <b>but it takes an awkward bounce and nearly zonks Foakes</b>, before flying to the cover boundary for four overthrows! The locals in the crowd hoot and holler their appreciation for the gift"
"full on the stumps, again he sweeps, again he gets it away for one"
lobbed up and Mathews is across to calmly tamp down on the ball
punched to cover coming forwards
"flat outside off, Dickwella reaches away from his body and panhandles one through point"
"floated up from round the wicket, straightening a touch as Mathews goes back and defends"
Mathews flicks the ball off his pads through midwicket
"tossed up on the stumps, swept to backward square leg"
"rolled out, flat offbreak but a touch wide, Dickwella chops to cover where Buttler swoops on it"
"pushed through, struck on the knee roll sweeping, half an appeal from Root... Heading down leg, I think. But that over has eaten up five minutes and the players head off for <b>tea</b>, England looking the more frazzled at this stage"
"round the wicket, but too short and worked out to deep mid-wicket"
Dickwella sweeps out to deep square leg. Another single. Down to 80
"<strong>GIVEN!</strong> Moeen strikes third ball. Mathews reviews, but is it in vain? That looks fairly plumb to me. Height could be the only thing that saves him. Umpire's call on hitting. Clipping leg. HUGE MOMENT! DO NOT GO ANYWHERE!"
very full and defended back with a huge puff of dust
back of a length and defended
Dilruwan survives the over. The Barmy Army have found their voice in fine fettle
"sweeps again, chim chim, and it's down to fine leg for a single"
"attempts to sweep outside leg, but misses. Juicy turn once more"
driven through point and they trot a single
Dickwella shimmies down and defends
attempts a big reverse sweep but doesn't connect. Crashes into the pad outside off
attempts the conventional sweep this time. Hits him outside the line
"they're going upstairs to check a catch. Dilruwan edges it round the corner to Stokes, who clings on. <strong>Soft signal is out.</strong> It hasn't carried. It's milimetres short. This is so tense; I can't take it anymore!"
solid defence from Dilruwan as Moeen goes outside off
all sorts of appeals. Is it too high? Root chooses not to review. Would have been Umpire's call as it was clipping leg
worked from back of a length through backward square leg
reverse swept with aplomb and they scurry back for two. The Sri Lankan fans applaud
full on leg. Dickwella defends
squirms off the outer edge along the floor through the covers
Leach strikes! Is that the match? That hit him on the full and might have just been outside the line. He opts not to review so there will be no review. Sensible too as Dilruwan's foot is straight in front
"round the wicket, a low full toss outside off, but patted into the covers"
high-elbowed push back down the track to mid-on
"squirted out square, past the lurking Jennings at short leg and away to square leg"
"tossed up, outside off, driven with an outside edge to backward point"
"reverse-swept straightaway, a sign of things to come from Dickwella, there's a sweeper at deep backward point in place for that stroke"
"defended on the back foot, out to backward point as Moeen finds some slow spin from back of a length"
"sweeping again, can't make proper contact as Foakes swoops from behind the stumps to gather"
"swept again, better contact this time, tonked out to deep midwicket where Rashid gathers on the bounce"
"head over the ball, stoutly stabbed back down the pitch"
firm block on the front foot. Solid start for Sri Lanka
"attempted sweep, sliding down leg"
"another full toss, tapped into the gap, a sign of tension perhaps from England"
firmly pressed back down the pitch
hops back to defend into the leg side
just back of a length once more. Solidly behind the line
firm defence on the back foot. That'll do for now for the batsmen
"reverse swept again, Burns does well to gauge the spin and keep his feet as the ball plugs in front of him"
pushed to mid-off
"<B>just a hint of purchase this time!</b> Fizzes past the edge, too wide to snag it, but something to think about!"
"<B>toe-ended over cover!</b> Loose from Akila, looking for a slap into the off side, but over-balancing as he does so. Close!"
eased down to long on
"more turn, but very slow. Solid in defence"
"hint of extra bounce, as this one is worked out to backward square leg"
"<B>big appeal as Dickwella sweeps!</B> Root thinks about it, but not this time... nope, that was under-edge of the bat"
"another full toss, Leach's third, another sweep. Clubbed firmly out to the leg side"
"<B>big rip from outside off!</B> Foakes can't gather as it bursts back through the gate. That was tossed up, and bit as a consequence"
"pressed into the vacant mid-on, easy pickings"
head over the ball to defend
"<strong>edged and gone!</strong> That's the one England wanted! Lovely from Moeen, the extra flight on a full length does the trick, dips late as Dickwella leans into a hard-handed drive, grips the pitch, kisses the edge and fizzes to Stokes at slip, who clings on with ease!"
"<B>big appeal as Lakmal is rapped on the pads!</b> Angled across the right-hander, turns back in sharply, but struck outside the line"
"<B>England are rampant now!</B> Another beauty from Moeen, a carbon copy of the previous ball, but tighter to the stumps, the angle around the wicket opens Lakmal up like a tin of beans, before straightening the ball through the gate and into the top of off!"
"thumps the pads once more, but nothing doing this time"
"a bottom-handed waft out of the rough, no real contact"
"pushed deeper into the crease, tucked to the leg side"
"patted into the off side, off the back foot"
"pressing forward, almost toppling out of the crease as he makes contact"
"right back on the stumps to defend, as Leach hunts his five-for"
"flipped in the air, but bissects the men at short leg and leg slip"
"<strong>driven, and misses as Leach gets one to bite!</strong> Foakes whips off the bails, no edge, but plenty threat. A quick check for the stumping, but the back foot is anchored"
"firmly pressed back down the track, head over the ball"
"ambitiously swept, but misses everything as Foakes whips off the bails"
solidly pressed into the covers
"<B>huge air!</B> Slow and wide turn as Akila launches into a Murali-lite kamikaze gallop down the track. Foakes has to gather high to his left, giving the batsman time to dive for the crease as the bails come off!"
blocked into the covers
beaten outside off again
"back of a length, fenced out to the off side, but can't pinch the single"
"that's the length, dipping outside off and tweaking past the edge"
"down on one knee to slog-sweep, a bit of top-edge but safe enough to get Akila back on strike"
"right back into the crease, blocked to the leg side"
"chiselled into the leg side, mid-on gathers"
"<B>another massive wind-up, another miss!</B> Down on one knee to sweep but the ball's no longer there"
"<strong>Leach thinks he has his five!</strong> Looked for all the world like a bump-ball, but the soft signal is out as Pushpakumara pushes a full length ball straight back to the bowler! Sure enough, that's straight off the toe, a puff of dust as the ball scrapes the turf in doing so, and England have won the Test, and the series, in terrific style!"
