"strikes him on the pad, with Powell running down the track looking to flick the ball over midwicket. Half an appeal for Bhuvi, but the ball pitches outside leg"
down the leg side again - by a couple of yards actually. Easy call for the ump. Tough work for Dhoni though
"126 kph, seems to be into the shot - nudge through midwicket - a bit too early and gets struck below the stomach"
"shortish and outside off, slaps it to point"
"<b>caught behind</b> and the crowd absolutely loses it. The first ODI in this stadium and it's a sea of blue in the stands and they rises as one as Bhuvi pitches the ball up. Tthe upright seam hits the deck and moves away. The length is full. So Powell is on the drive - but it's an on the up drive, with the hands pushing away from the body - and that does him in. The little bit of movement does him in"
"leans into the drive, and Hope has better success because he's closer to the pitch of the ball. No run to mid-off"
"<b>oooh</b>, he's forward again, looking for a hard-handed push into the covers, but seeing the line of the ball - around that fifth stump - and Bhuvi's tendency to nibble it around, Hope practices caution in the end. Soft-handed dab to backward point"
steers the back of a length delivery outside off to third man
cramps him with a short ball on middle and it forces Hope to get off his feet as he turns it to midwicket
lets the good length ball go outside off
"<b>bowled him</b> and it's insane bowling! Movement off the pitch again - and that's all the more venomous when it's pitched up, at Bumrah's pace. Hope is coming forward, a little lazily, and is surprised that the ball bounces as much as it does. Tends to happen with Bumrah - hits the deck so hard, generating all his pace in the last couple of steps and that ridiculous right shoulder and so even length deliveries kick up. Hope tries to negotiate it by standing up taller, but he also ends up playing away from his body and the gap between bat and pad is massive. Misjudgment, inside edge, stumps broken"
slips down leg
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go"
"cuts back in off the seam again, Samuels shoulders arms. And let's all breathe."
solidly behind the fuller delivery on middle
hint of inswing - movement through the air as opposed to the pitch. Powell inches forward and flicks to midwicket. Good thing he gets bat on it or he might have had to deal with a big lbw shout
"good length ball, wobbling away outside off. Tempting but not quite enough for Powell to play"
nice and tight on middle - with the ball seaming into the right-hander as well. Powell stops it in its tracks with a straight bat
"gets the opportunity to go back and looks far better, punching the short ball into the covers"
"good length ball on off stump, Powell is slow to come forward and block, which is why he gets an inside edge that goes nowhere"
"<b>beats him</b> by getting the ball to swing away outside off. Samuels is such a reluctant batsman to come forward. So these full deliveries look even more awesome with the batsman stuck in the crease and reaching for it, feebly"
slants it into the right-hander - and it's full again. Samuels stays back and blocks.
"full and outside off, presses forward nicely now and shoulders arms"
"threatening line again - a shade outside off and the ball curling in through the air. Samuels does well, planting his front foot across, protecting his stumps and leaving outside it"
<b>outside edge</b> as Bumrah's outswingers keep working their magic. Curls away late. The length is again pitched up. But Samuels is simply not comfortable coming forward when the ball is in line with the stumps. Kohli tracks the nick as it comes on the bounce to him at third slip
tailing into the pads - perhaps looking for the magic ball that veers away from leg stump. No success here as Samuels flicks it to long leg
pulls the bottom hand off the bat as he gets in line with a fuller delivery outside off
hits on the up - and he makes the decision to do so because of the width on offer. Can only hit it as far as mid-off though
"good length, outside off, no shot"
"carves it to the left of cover, but the ball holds up in a very lush outfield. Best shot of the morning from a West Indian blade as Samuels takes advantage of a chance to free his arms"
"pitches it up on off stump, Samuels defends"
"lovely bowling. He's getting a hint of movement away. And he's making sure the batsman has to keep that in mind all the time, simply by targeting the top of off stump on a full length. Samuels, here, negotiates it with a block, the bottom hand flying off the bat"
full and wide - teasing Powell into a drive away from the body - but he won't be baited
blocks a shortish delivery on off stump to point
"lofts it over the infield, absolutely gorgeous! The straight bat, and keeping it close to the body, is such a change to the wickets earlier in the day. If you attack, you need to do it like that. Couple of bounces to the long-off boundary"
"<b>ripper of a response</b>. Bumrah pitches it up, the angle of the ball forcing Powell to play, but the late swing away beating the outside edge and turning him inside out"
slants it into the pads and hits the apparent target
"136kph, blocks a short of a length delivery on middle"
"<b>half an appeal for lbw</b> but it might be a touch high. Samuels is rapped above the knee-roll as he falls over trying to play a flick. Bhuvi's pitching it up and as a result of that, he gets movement off the pitch, this time into the right-hander"
"<B>inside edge</b> as Bhuvi hits a good length and the ball seems to hold in the pitch, along with moving into the right-hander"
opens the face and guides the back of a length delivery to point
"thumps it to the long-off boundary! This time there is no swing and more so, Samuels comes forward to a pitched up ball, getting himself in to glorious position to hit through the line"
"<b>sensational</b>! The balance at the crease. The simplicity of the movement. It's all class when he gets it right, like here, as he flicks to the right of mid-on, making sure he picks that gap with a roll of the wrist"
works it to midwicket.
"<b>too good</b>! Even off a shorter length, Bumrah gets the ball to deck off the surface, the movement so stark that Powell, who is pushing at the ball, can't meet up with it"
"<b>and again</b>. It's the same plan. Tease him on the fourth of fifth stump and trust yourself to get movement off the pitch. Powell, not moving his feet, when he should he going back, is done in by the late seam movement away"
"now for the one that ducks back in and Powell is late on his shot selection, the ball thudding into the high part of the bat"
steers the shortish delivery outside off to point
forces him back again with a short ball on middle. Powell gets the middle of his bat to it
goes wide of the crease to target the top of off. Powell lets it come to him and dabs it to point
starts with a loopy old yorker and Samuels is wise to the threat
that is boss-like! It's a length ball. It give him room. And Samuels stands still and smashes it over the top. <b>Blockbuster hitting</b> from Samuels
"pulls his length back and corrects his line as well. With no room, Samuels dabs it to point"
"oh, this is now turning into a highlight reel! <b>Samuels has woken up</B> from his longtime slumber and he's showing that even at 37, he's a force. Picks up a length ball - and perfectly good ball - and wallops it over midwicket"
works it off his hip to square leg
"bouncer - good response from Khaleel, he's not taking these big shot lying down - but there's a little too much height on this"
"goes on the bounce to third man as Samuels stays leg side of a short ball and scythes it away. Oh, we're in for something special if this keeps up"
gets it to drift into Samuels' pad. He gets it out of the way to block
loves the flight on the ball and hammers it back at the bowler
"goes hard again, but Jadeja is not putting too much pace on the ball, and he's also targeting an area just outside off. That means Samuels, not exactly moving his feet to the line of the ball, is made to reach out and only gets an inside edge"
"good length on off stump, he defends"
drives the flighted delivery to cover
"good length and outside off, Samuels steers it to point and Jadeja <b>ends a maiden</b>"
"length ball, angling across the batsman who comes forward and defends it towards covers"
"another length ball, a tad wider this time, Powell steers it towards third man"
"a bouncer this time, comes slower off the pitch as Samuels goes for the pull, was early in his shot, gets hit on the shoulder and gets a leg-bye as Dhoni makes a partial stop"
"good length, no room at all, Powell was looking to flick it uppishly over midwicket, gets cramped and ends up lobbing it just short of mid-on"
"length ball, once again in the body, backs away and swats it to mid-on"
"short and connects the pull this time, Dhawan at deep square-leg tidies it up"
"length ball, in the line of the stumps, pushed back"
"slower through the air, around off stump, a little bit of turn as Samuels pushes it towards cover"
"length ball, at 90kph, Powell pushes it towards short midwicket"
"straying on the pads this time, flicked behind the square for one"
"<strong>and a soft dismissals!</strong> Jadeja gets his first. It was slower through the air, just around off stump, Samuels was once again early in the shot, ends up offering a dolly to Kohli at extra cover"

"starts with a wide length ball, Hetmyer lets it go"

"length ball, around off stump, Powell comes forward and defends"
"length outside off, steered towards point where Jadeja is quick to the ball and prevents the single"
"length ball, coming slower off the wicket, almost squares Powell who gets a thick edge towards covers"
"length ball, just outside off, Hetmyer was guilty of playing on the up, but good thing is he checked his shot as a result the ball didn't carry to Kohli at extra cover"
"length ball, looks to work it on the leg side, gets a leading edge which lands safely to the right of Jadeja at point"
"down the leg side, goes for the flick but misses, an appeal for caught-behind but denied"
"length ball, around middle and leg, defended"
"length again, Powell pushes at it, gets a thick inside edge towards square leg"
"length ball, goes back and punches it back towards the bowler"

"length ball, pitching well outside off, played gently towards fine leg"
"fuller, around off stump, pushed back towards the bowler"
"length outside off, goes back and punches it towards long-off"
"slower in the air, fuller on middle and leg, flicked but the square leg fielder makes a diving stop to his right"
"fuller but Hetmyer plays it back, misreads the length altogether and is rapped on the front pad. Anil Chaudhary denies the appeal, Dhoni says he is not sure about where it pitched, but Jadeja insists on the review. Replays show it pitched in the line, beat the bat to rap Hetmyer right in front and would have gone on to hit middle and leg. Dhoni chuckles at the end of it"

"another short of length outside off, another push by Holder, a thick outside edge this time dribbles towards third man"
"<strong>Powell departs</strong>. It was bouncer which caught Powell unprepared who ends up half-pulling it towards deep square leg, where Dhawan takes a couple of steps forward to take one of the easier catches. A finger-on-the-lips celebration by Khaleel"

"length outside off, slight turn there is enough to beat the bat again"
"length ball, pushed back to the bowler"
"short of length outside off, cuts it to the point fielder"

"bangs it in, Holder sways his head away"
"<b>beats him</b> with a length ball that holds its line outside off. Bit loose from Holder, who's normally known as a very correct batsman"
enjoys the angle into him as he waits on the short ball and flicks through midwicket
"yorker, a shade outside off, Allen is up for the challenge"
"<b>taken at long leg</B>! The short ball does it, as is the angle of the ball, coming sharply into the right-hander. Allen goes for the hook, but with the ball always climbing on him - at point of contact, it was above his throar - the top-edge was the likeliest result."
"sliding into the pads and Holder is able to tickle it away to the fine leg boundary. Riskless cricket. And look, it yields a profit"
"drives it away, smoothly and all along the ground, to long-off"
"loops it up outside off, lunges forward to defend"
"hangs back against the shortish delivery on middle, in an effort to tuck it to midwicket and pinch a single. No luck"
"<b>outside edge</b> as Jadeja gets the ball to dip before the batsman, lunging forward, can reach it. That allows the tiny bit of turn and the mis-hit to run away past the two slips"
presses forward to block
"tosses it up outside off, Paul looks for the cover drive, considering the ball keeps drifting across him, but he ends up with an inside edge"
"leans into a drive, to the right of extra cover, the front foot taking him across and towards the pitch of the ball"
"<b>big turn</b> and that's why a ball pitching on off stump zips through past the batsman's thighs, and into Dhoni's gloves"
steps back and punches the shortish delivery outside off to cover
"flighted on off stump, he defends well"
"<B>appeal for lbw</b> but umpire Wilson says no. India are thinking about the review and Kohli calls for it. <b>Massive turn</b> from Kuldeep again, this good length ball drifting over to off stump, dragging the batsman across and making him play outside the line. The legbreak beats the inside edge and strikes him in line with off stump. Ball-tracking says it would only clip the leg stump - Allen has a big stride and there is a lot of turn as well. So, in the end, it's a fair result. <b>India keep their review</b> and Paul bats on"
"tosses it up on middle, blocks it out"
<b>outstanding shot</b>! He stays leg side of the full delivery. But he's looming over it. His body weight is going into the drive and that puts him in perfect position to smack the ball through the covers
keeps out a good length ball on middle
"<b>edge falls short of slip</b>. Credit to Holder, who plays with soft hands the moment he realises he's in a bad place. Stuck in the crease against a good length ball that is turning"
""
pristine cover drive! It's a half-volley outside off and Holder lays into it with a straight bat. Fine batting from the West Indies captain
"eases the ball through point, but because it's Jadeja, there's a bit of indecision. Both Holder and Allen stand still in the middle of the pitch before they see the ball go past Jadeja and then they go through for the single"
"gorgeous cover drive again, the key being his ability to stride forward to the pitch of the ball. Holder's long levers working very well"
"good length ball outside off, drives to long-off"
"he's hitting against the turn, but Holder's ability to plant that front foot to the pitch of the ball negates most of the risk in the cover drive"
"full toss here, which Holder smacks through cover again"
skips out of his crease to meet the ball where it lands and flicks it to long-on
"<b>the ball dips</B> on Holder's off stump and sensing the danger, he only defends."
dabs the shortish delivery to point
"<b>taken at mid-off</b>. Driving on the up on this pitch, where the ball keeps stopping on the batsman, is risky business. Even Holder pays enough mind to that as he looks to beat Jadhav inside the circle. Makes contact with the high part of the bat - that means there's no timing - and the fielder even has to run up and dive in order to get under it. Khaleel celebrates by putting two fingers on his lips - he was reprimanded by the ICC for his celebrations in the last ODI"

"shortish and outside off, he slices it to point"
"fullish on off stump, Bishoo's right behind it"
"bouncer on and around off stump, Bishoo sways out of the way"
"taken at long-on! It's a steepler, demanding Rayudu to run forward and to his right as well. But by the time the ball is on its way down, he is already in position, taking the catch ever so cleanly. Top-edged sweep from Paul and he is tempting into the shot only because of the amount of flight Kuldeep puts on it. Lovely wristspin bowling"
"plenty of drift taking the ball outside off. That draws the batsman across. Then comes the dip and turn, setting Roach up for the lbw. Lucky he gets bat to it"
blocks the full delivery on middle
"<b>pins him lbw but Roach has reviewed</b>. This is lovely bowling again.,The legbreak dangled outside off. The batsman pushing across to play the original line of the ball and then is beaten by the dip and turn. Strikes him in line with middle and off, but ball-tracking says there's so much turn that it misses leg stump. Umpire Wilson will change his decision"

"length ball, around middle and leg, turned away towards deep square leg"
"length ball, around middle and leg, pushed to short midwicket"

"length ball, comes forward and defends"
"fired in, length ball, but down the leg side"
"plumb in front, Jadeja gets a four-for! length ball, spinning back and hits the batsman on the back leg. West Indies decide to review, more in hope, I must say. And that's three reds on replay, would have hit middle and leg"

"<b>that's no. 200</b>! And it's a beauty too. Stands tall against the length ball and monsters it over long-on. Afridi, Gayle, Jayasuriya, Dhoni, De Villiers, McCullum and now Rohit - the 200 sixes club in ODIs"

"If India get to within 25 runs of their target, the break will be pushed back, and it's happened. Rohit also goes to 49 with a blistering shot down the ground. It's a length ball on off stump. Rohit keeps the front leg and away and goes on the charge. b<We need a new ball, people</b>"
