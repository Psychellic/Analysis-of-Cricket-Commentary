a bit of away-swing straight away. Fullish length and gets some assistance through the air and Klinger withdraws his bat late as he changes his mind

"gets another one to shoot past the outside edge. Good length, shaping across, Marsh sticks his bat out in the channel and gets beatenn narrowly"
"make that three in a row, although this delivery was a lot different. It was full and wide, making Marsh reach out. He slashes hard at it and gets beaten, more comprehensively on this occasion"
shot! Half-volley outside off and Klinger crunches the drive through extra cover. Gets it perfectly between cover and mid-off. Laced with timing

fuller and angling in on off. Has his foot firmly planted as he had enough room to swing his arms and lofts it straight and clean over the bowler's head
goes for a cut and the bowler has the last laugh. It was a short ball and bounced quite enough to leave the batsman a tad uncomfortable. He has to jump late to adjust to the extra bounce and ends up not getting it off the middle. Goes off the splice uppishly towards third man where Steketee settles under it
comes forward and pushes it into mid-on

goes down for a reverse sweep and does not make contact
tries to flick this length ball away to the leg side and ends up inside-edging it to the pads before the ball lobs in the air. The wicketkeeper grabs the catch and they appeal for a bat-pad which is given by the umpire
"googly, misses everything. Marsh had no clue about that and the ball misses his inside-edge, the stumps and the wicketkeeper, none by much, as it goes away to the fine leg boundary"
"good length ball, stands tall and tucks it off the pads behind square for a well-run brace"
"short ball, pulled powerfully past square leg. Deep backward square runs to his right but has no chance of getting anywhere near that. Thumped"

""
"short of a length, punched off the backfoot to long-off"
comes down the track to meet the pitch of this ball. But he does not middle the loft and skies it to long-on where Buchanan settles under it and snaffles it reverse-cupped. Does well as he had to run quite some way to his left. And it was not to his natural side

"pitched up outside off, comes forward and drives it uppishly, past the diving extra cover fielder"
shuffles across to this length ball and works it through the off side
"what a shot! Huge hit. That's gone a long, long way into the stands. It was short and Turner nails the pull shot as the ball crosses the deep midwicket boundary and disappears into the crowd. Nothing ball really, fired way too short and does not kick up much to trouble the batsman"
knocked back to the bolwer
"short ball, pulled hard but the square leg fielder does well to dive to his left and gets his hands to it as he takes the momentum off"

"fuller on off-stump, driven to long-on"

"good length ball on off, worked to point"
"fuller and on the pads, clipped away off the toes to deep square leg"

"full and wide, sliced straight into the hands of backward point. Goes hard as he tries to drill a square drive and ends up playing uppishly"

"short of a length ball, dabs it with soft hands towards the vacant mid-on region. They hurry back for the second by the time the long-on fielder can runs in and field it"
great running. punches this short of a length ball through extra cover. There is a fielder in the deep and he picks it up well and fires a clean throw at the bowler's end. But the batsmen are too quick and complete the brace comfortably
"short ball, lays into a pull shot and the ball screams past the deep midwicket boundary"
works this between long-on and deep midwicket and they grab another brace by the time the two fielders can converge. Marsh smartly picking gaps and running hard here
"full ball, clipped off the toes, they do not even think of the second this time as the ball goes straight to the fielder at deep midwicket who gathers it cleanly"

"full and wide, drilled straight down to long-off"
"short ball, on leg and middle and angling away. Wildermuth tries to ramp it up after leaning back, but it is well-directed and quite close to him so he cannot make contact despite arching a long way back and across"
opens the bat face and works it to backward point. Misfield allows them to take a single. Clumsy effort from the fielder who fluffs a simple stop
walks across to this fuller ball and crunches a drive down the ground. It goes straight towards the boundary but long-off and long-on both converge on the ball and one of them picks it up
"Marsh has really cut loose here. That was dismissive. It was short and Marsh makes room for himself before slapping it through covers. Absolutely smashes it and the ball goes on the bounce over the boundary, and yikes, nearly hits the cameraman who has to get out of its way real quick"
"fuller ball, pushed to long-on"
"catch, what a catch! Buchanan runs a long way across and takes a delightful catch. That was not easy at all. Whiteman goes down looking fo a slog sweep and top-edges it to the midwicket region.

"fuller ball, clipped off the toes to fine leg"
"fuller ball, drills it wide of long-off"

"slower ball again, and another great caught-and-bowled. Marsh tries to slog it and gets the timing horribly wrong. Skies it straight up in the air and lost his balance as he played the shot. His head foes up straight away as he knows he has not timed it well. Steketee settles under it and it takes what seems like all of eternity before landing but he takes it with remarkable composure"
"yorker, squeezed out to midwicket"

tucked behind square off the pads
backs away early and the bowler follows him with a back of a length ball on leg stump. The batsman tries to ramp it away but there is no pace on that and he cannot make any contact
and that's another fuller ball that is deposited into the stands. Can't be bowling there at this stage or any stage of a T20 game. Full and on the toes and it's easy for Agar who lofts it clean over long-on

slaps this wide ball and chops it towards extra cover
"fuller ball, drilled wide of long-off and they take on the fielder there for the extra run. Throw is fired at the bowler's end and he does not collect it cleanly as he seems to be in a hurry to take the bails off. Had he collected it, it would have been a run out, but they get two instead"
"what a start! Short ball and Peirson swivels around and pulls, and the ball sails over the fine leg boundary. Clean hit to start off the chase"
"short and wide ball, outside off, Peirson opens up his arms and flays it over backward point and the ball goes on the bounce past the boundary"
<b>dropped</b> Fullish length ball and Peirson flicks it away. There is a short midwicket in place and it goes straight to him. But Klinger makes an absolute mess of a relatively straightforward chance and spills it

advances down the ground to meet a length ball and hammers it to long-off
"short ball, Peirson lays into a pull shot and gets it on the bounce over the midwicket boundary"
"one shot too many and pays the price. Fuller ball, bang on the stumps and Peirson pays the price for swiping across the line. Tries to force it through the leg side and misses it altogether. It was a straight bat and he is bowled through the gate"
"short of a length, tucked off the pads to square leg"
sprays a full toss and McCullum quietly turns it away to the fine leg boundary. Just used the pace of the bowler on that occasion. No power. And it is also called a no-ball for height

"slower short of a length ball, blocked towards mid-off"

turned away to midwicket for a quick single
"moves across early to protect the off-stump before trying to flick this ball away. But he gets it off the pad instead and the ball rolls into the leg side. The bowler darts across on the follow-through, slides, picks it up and fires a throw at the non-striker's end but does not hit"
"length ball, waits for it in the crease and tucks it to square leg"
"shot! Richardson is greeted with a lovely, clean six over long-on. It's on a length and angling in and all Lynn has to do is give himself some room before using the angle to loft it. Goes a long way back"
"predictable response from the bowler. Bouncer on leg, ducked under"
"short of a length, angling in, tucked to midwicket"
"what a shot! How do you explain that! That's pure, raw power. Change of pace from the bowler as he lands one short and gives ample width outside off. Lynn flat-bats it, gives it an absolute smack as the ball goes over deep extra cover and bounces just after crossing the ropes"
""
"appeal for caught behind from the wicketkeeper and not given. Richardson seems a bit stunned at the call too. It was a short of a length ball, angling in on leg stump. McCullum was looking to pull it away, but does so from an awkward position and the ball goes to the wicketkeeper. Did not seem like there was any edge or glove on that one and it is called a wide"

bang on target straight away. Good length ball that lands on leg and middle. Lynn quietly blocks with a straight bat
"short ball at 143kph, gets big on Lynn and comes on too quickly. He misses the pull shot and has to arch back more a bit late as the ball shoots past him. Well-directed bouncer"

"short and wide, opens up his arms and flays it through covers, sweeper cover tidies up"
"length ball on off, Lynn was in line early and had enough room to open up his arms and crunch it over long-on. Had the front leg out the way early so he had ample time to muscle it"
"tries a similar shot to this short of a length ball but it is a lot straighter and he gets cramped for room as a result, misses and the wicketkeeper collects it"
gets down to sweep and gets hit on the pad as the ball goes to short fine leg. They do not bother appealing for the lbw as it was going down the leg side
"oh, what a catch! That is sensational. Hang on, he's stepped on the rope. Seems like it is David Willey at long-on. Times his jump to perfection but the foot lands on the rope as he completes the catch. He threw it away when he realised that the momentum was carrying him over the ropes, throws it up in the air and comes back to catch it agin. But his foot landed on the rope the moment he had completed the original catch. Coming to the ball, Lynn came down the track to take the ball on the full before lofting it"

"<b>dropped</b> Misjudges a catch running back from short fine leg. McCullum was trying to slog sweep and got down on one knee, got a top-edge for his troubles"
length ball and too much width on offer. Lynn just opens up his arms and flat-bats it over cow corner. That was a slower ball and still goes way back into the stands. Really no idea how he is doing this
that's even bigger. Superb balance as he swats it 93 metres over long-off. It was a length ball outside off and he absolutely thumps it
