on the back foot and punched pleasingly through the covers to get off the mark
"tight line to the right-hander, with a bit of shape through the air. Defended"
"on the pads, that's a gimme. Amla leans inside the line, gets a tickle of bat, and lets the pace do the rest"
"outside off, left alone"
flogged into the covers to complete the over
"good bounce from a full length, de Kock takes one hand off the bat to combat"
"well bowled again, more leap from a good length, and de Kock looks around anxiously to make sure he hasn't chopped the ball onto his stumps. He hasn't"
"short, attempted pull, a bit streaky but they all count. A bottom-edged pull through fine leg. The bounce is giving him something to think about"
"well bowled, a full-length slower ball strikes the pad, but it pitched outside leg"
good length again
"levered into the covers with a big flow of bat. Not really timed, more forced"
"lovely strike, but a pretty terrible ball. A full, outswinging half-volley, Amla barely needed to move to flog it through the covers"
"better delivery, tighter line, and left alone"
"outside off once again, a nibble of outswing as Amla leaves alone"
"cracked off the back foot, Amla is seeing it gloriously now! Pounded down into the off side, flies past the flailing backward point. Lovely"
left alone once more
"tighter line again, but a solid over of process for Amla"
"a fraction too short, and de Kock climbs into another pull. Still hasn't timed one today, unlike his partner..."
"on the pads, tucked in a more measured fashion into the leg side"
"on the back foot, hauled into the leg side"
he timed that one alright! A slashing cut but backward point does well to get his body in the way as the ball fizzes off the used pitch
"width, and slashed into the covers once more, and straight to the fielder again"
no way through there
"fuller length, defended on the back foot, on a fourth-stump line. That's the right area to pressurise Amla"
"extra bounce from a good length, and if this had been a Test match, that would have got short leg very interested as it pinged the glove. Well bowled"
"lovely shape outside off, and Amla is lured into a massive wipe. No foot movement, and he shakes his head as the ball flies by"
"onto the front foot, solidly blocked"
"on the front foot, and that's another lovely bit of pressure-relieving from Amla. Overpitched again, and he was so quickly into position for the drive"
"width, and wallop! Who needs footwork when you have located the middle of your bat? Backward point has no chance"
"on the pads, chiselled into the leg side and that is too easy for QDK. Kumara came round the wicket, and it vanished at speed through midwicket. Such balance at the moment of impact"
"extra bounce, and de Kock rides it well. Deflected down to third man"
"more good lift off the deck, and defended with high gloves into the off side"
"full length, defended down the track, and that's been called, but there's no way that was over the front line! A <B>free hit</B> coming up, and unjustly so"
justice is done as a zippy lifter flies through unscathed

tight line and blocked back down the track.
defended into the off side

"better ball, lifting from a good length"
"attempted yorker, effective enough. Dug out and back to the bowler"
"short again, whisked round the corner with a roll of the wrists. Deep backward square tidies up"
"full length again, crunched fairly innocuously down the ground, but two men converge, and both leave it for the other. Through the ball trundles, all the way to the rope. Whoops"
"too short, too wide, QDK leans back in avaricious fashion, and hauls a pull through the gap at wide long-on. Free flowing, in every sense"
"round the wicket, on the front foot, a high-elbowed jab to mid-on"
"outside off, crushed out to backward point"
"on the toes, flicked through midwicket. If this was a pick-your-own fruit plantation, QDK would need to be weighed by the time he went to pay for his punnet ..."
tighter line
"outside off, an elegant down-on-one-knee drill into the covers, but straight to the fielder this time. That was a handsome strike..."
"too short, choose your spot... QDK chooses backward square leg, and that is his 3000th ODI run! The third-fastest by a South African, and the fastest by a wicketkeeper. What a player"
"fuller length, drilled up to mid-on"
"tapped out to point, another single"
"up on the toes, defended to the off side"
"on the pads and tucked into the gap at square leg. There should have been two there, but de Kock wasn't interested"

"advances down the track to meet Lakmal's adjusted line and length outside off, and guided through the covers off the front foot. That is a gorgeously audacious stroke"
"on the pads, tucked into the leg side"

"pushed out to point, off the back foot"
"on the pads, turned to the leg side"
"dancing down the track, using the feet well to ease another single to long-off"
"that is lovely. Just overmatched a fraction, and QDK picks his gap in the covers and eases it to the rope. That's his fifty, and he has waltzed it"
turned to the leg side
"on the front foot, a gentle push to long-off for another single"
"battered into the covers with flashing wrists, but short cover pounces well"
squared up a touch and pushes back to the bowler
defended into the off side
"drilled into the covers, more ominous timing"
"in the air, the first <strong>half-chance</strong> of the innings! It wasn't a drop as Mendis was at full stretch but it definitely brushed his fingertips as Amla flicked a touch lazily on the up through short midwicket"

dabbed into the gap to bring up the hundred in double-quick time

pushed through flat outside off and Amla allows this one into the keeper's gloves
"dragged down slightly, there's room for Amla to swish it away off the back foot, easy pickings for four more down to third man... Undoes much of Vandersay's good work in previous overs as the runs continue to flow for SA"

"dollied up on the stumps, Amla clips through midwicket"
"fullish and dipping on off, pushed back to the bowler"

"back of a length outside off, Amla opens the face towards third man"
"width for the cut, goes up and over... but cover runs in to take a good diving catch and stop de Kock in his tracks! Opening bowler Lakmal claims the breakthrough - but its taken until the 27th over.

good solid contact from another drive into the covers
whittled into the leg side
"battered, but short cover gets his body in the way"
"round the wicket, pushed down to long-off"
compact drive down to long-on. Content with the singles for now
a decent over so far. Tempting the big shot over the top with a full length. Settles for another single down to long-on
"wider, and cut to point"
"fuller length, clipped to midwicket"
"whoops. A full toss, and Amla marches into the nineties with a help-yourself hoick through midwicket. A vaguely promising over becomes another expensive one"
"full length, tucked to the leg side"
outside off and patted into the covers
"wider line, worked to cover"
"full length, probing the stumps, pushed into the leg side"
nurdled to square leg. The 250 is up...
"gives room, goes for the ambitious mow down the ground, doesn't get hold of it properly, and that's a well-judged take at long-off by Lakmal, to end another enterprising knock"
down on one knee for a premeditated sweep to fine leg. He's off the mark
"outside off, and a pleasing report of willow as AB times a back-foot flog to deep cover"
"crushed into the covers. A low full toss, but straight to the fielder"
"outside off, a rare leave"
"looped up, and that's a good stop by a diving point"
"down the leg side, and though AB misses with his sweep, he does enough to put the keeper off. It's a win-win for SA"
"back of a length, AB lines up a pull but doesn't connect ideally. No matter, it's still 10 off the over"
"outside off, tight line, an attempted drive but not quite timed"
"down the ground, gives himself room, frees the arms. That's what the crowd have been waiting for! Up and over long-off for a one-bounce four"
tucked into the leg side
worked to leg from a tight line on off stump
"wow. Reverse-sweep, and utterly nailed. Into position early, keeping his balance, and filleting the gap"
a big wind-up and an under-edge past the stumps. But he keeps the strike... Amla lost his boot midway through that single!
"smashed on the up, but straight to the man at deep extra cover! Not quite the post-Kohli-at-Chinnaswamy silence, but mass disappointment all the same. A short-and-to-the-point 14 from 9 this time"
leaning onto the front foot to punch another drive
off the mark straightaway
"onto the front foot, driven into the off side"
"width, and an attempted cut. No contact this time"

"well bowled, a tight line outside off, Duminy dangles his bat and looks for the single, but it's not on"
"outside off, poked down to third man"
"opens the face, tapped to third man, and there it is! Amla's 24th ODI hundred, and his fifth at Centurion. Equal most with De Villiers for South Africa in ODIs. Jolly good show"
"more width, and a flashing cut from Duminy"
"on the toes, whittled into the leg side"
"back of a length, Amla is looking to heave that into the leg side but doesn't quite connect properly"
"round the wicket, aiming for the blockhole and more or less finding it. A single to cover is the upshot"
"back into the crease to haul a pull into the leg side. Not quite perfect, but another single"
"angled into the pads, deflected to the leg side, but this has been a good over so far"
"well bowled once again, following the batsman and cramping him for room on the legs"
shorter and heaved into the leg-side. Fine leg can't make it in time to take a catch but he does sweep up the boundary
another single to keep the score ticking
"too wide, Amla leaves alone in the hope that the umpire will outstretch his arms. He does"
"in the slot, booming launch over the bowler's head and into the gap. One, two bounces, and over it rolls"
too much width and Amla climbs into that one too! Here he comes...
woof! That is the sound of the selfish argument going up in smoke as Amla batters a huge six over square leg to bring up the 300!
"onto the front foot, pushed to cover. That was an effective over... and it's not over yet"
"down on one knee, Duminy attempts a haul into the leg side, and doesn't connect. Still, 18 off the over is solid enough"
pulled round the corner
"not out of the middle of the bat, but finds the gap on the legside with an uppish drive, and that races away"
"What a strange dismissal! Paddled around the corner, it deflects off the top of his thigh pad, onto the back of his bat, and lobs gently to Dickwella behind the stumps!"
"low full toss, a fairly effective delivery in the circumstances. Worked to long-on to get off the mark"
"attempted flick through third man, reversing his stance, but not quite making full contact"
"that's a horrid delivery, a wide outswinging full toss, curling as if directly to the backward point boundary. So Berhardien does the decent thing and sends it on its way"
"battered through backward point once again, and the only question is whether this hit the rope on the full. Certainly did"
"short, and mishit into the gap at midwicket"
tapped into the gap
"full length, wide of off stump, hoicked into the leg side"
"back of a length, chopped to point"
"good delivery once again, really full length, denying South Africa much chance to free the arms. Recovered well from that first ball"
"slower ball, tapped to midwicket"
"wow, that is some connection. Wide of off stump, so Amla opened the face and timed the pants off a lofted uppercut. Clean through point for another six"
"dragged into the leg side, falls short of the deep midwicket sweeper"
"on the pads, worked to deep square leg"
"inswinging full toss, that clatters into Behardien's back leg and they hobble the bye"
that is a massive swipe over long-on! Right underneath the ball and hoisted brutally into the crowd! South Africa on the charge with four to go ...
"outside off, and driven into the covers"
"a premeditated adjustment at the crease, but the bowler isn't fazed and that's a good retort, full and straight"
"too short, just a fraction too short, but Amla was hanging back in his crease, waiting for any chance to get underneath his shot, and this sails clean into the stands at cow corner!"
"going, going, gone! A fraction fuller, but every bit as in-the-slot for Amla, who is seeing it like a planet now. A free swing through the line and straight back over the bowler's head. Clean and deadly. Like neat vodka"
"outside off, and crunched to cover. Doesn't beat the field this time"
"slower ball, very full but dragged to long-on for another single"
worked into the leg side
"he's there now! Another baseball-style mow through the onside, and that is his fourth score of 150-plus. His last 50 from 19 balls!"
"tremendous hitting! A leg-stump full toss, Behardien curls into a murderous pull, pirouetting on his back foot and that clears midwicket by several metres"
"outside off, squirted square and they rush back for two as third man slides round"
"width, but adjudged just inside the tramlines as Berhardien topples in his attempt to drill through the off side. In fact, that should have been called"
another dot ball. Precious!
"makes room and crashes yet another four through the off side, clearing the infield and piercing the sweepers"
"on the back foot, another stonking strike, but this time it's straight to the fielder! A cool take at deep point, right on the boundary's edge, to end a brilliant innings"
down the track and drilled to long-off
"low full toss, slower delivery, worked to long-on"
"back of a length, and that's a steepling swipe into no-man's land at midwicket. Lots of hang-time, but no-one there to take the catch"
"outside off, carved on the hop out to extra cover"
"outside off, trying to keep the ball inside the tramlines, but this one slips"
"wide again, this time Behardien chases it, and that's a horrible <B>drop</B> at long-off! Made the ground, then muffed the chance"
"persisting with that wide line, it was a full toss and Behardien thought he'd made good contact, but long-on makes no mistake, unlike his mirror-image"
"wide once again, inches the wrong side of the guideline as Morris refuses to chase it"
"same line, and this time Morris does have a go, toe-ending to point"
"got to credit him for persistence, but that's another one that's the wrong side of the marker"
"better, another wide outswinger, that one would have been inside the tramlines, and Morris jabs a single to third man"
"round the wicket, Parnell chisels a single to long on"
"wide full toss, good contact from Morris, but the cover sweeper limits the damage. Not a bad over despite all the wides, as South Africa finish on an imposing 384 for 6"
"short and slightly leg side, hits the thigh pad as he looks to play across the line"
"driven on the up and he gets it through, that'll run away to the fence... Made a little room and threw his hands through the shot, laced between mid-off and extra cover"
shortish on the stumps and turned into the leg side
"back of a length, Dickwella flashes at a wide one - called by the ump"
"short and at the body again, Dickwella nudges one through square leg"
"good length, shaping back in a touch as Tharanga closes the face and turns towards midwicket"
short and flying through outside off at 137kph as the batsman reaches for it uncuccessfully
"starts on the money, pitched up and swinging in, dug out into the leg side for one"
"good length, pace up above 140 clicks, Tharanga jabs at the ball coming back in"
"he's off the mark now, clipping a fullish ball through midwicket, deep square leg has to run around to cut it offf"
"shortish and there's some width for Tharanga to cut, well struck but it's straight to Duminy, just above head height, and it <b>bursts through the hands!</b> He reacted quickly and you'd have backed Duminy yo hold on there... a tough chance but still a drop"
"brings the ball in and hits the pads, pitching outside leg"
"full outside off, Dickwella doesn't move the feet much, just launches the ball over cover... doesn't quite run all the way and Dickwella was guilty of dawdling and admiring his shot, so they only manage to run two"
"angled across and slashed down to third man, off the outside edge"
""
"short of a length and thudding into the thigh pad, runs away behind square"
"there's the Dickscoop, already his trademark, gets down early and ramps a 142kph ball over his shoulder nonchalantly for four"
draws his length back a touch and Dickwella can't get it away
"dug in short, swing and a miss from the batsman... and it just keeps going, clears the keeper and runs away for four extras"
"good length on the stumps, Tharanga defends"
"angled across in the channel, Tharanga's bottom hand comes off the bat as he slices a drive... and it sails down the gullet of third man! First blood to SA, Morris celebrates without emotion. The Cape Town centurion falls"
angled across and this is played in more controlled fashion down to third man for one
"banged in short, rising sharply as Mendis makes like a goose and ducks"
"slightly back of a length, 136kph over the top of off stump, Mendis defends securely"
"length, on the tramlines... or outside the tramlines, it seems"
"pitched up and Mendis goes for the booming drive, it's not really full enough and the ball zings past the outside edge, holding its line before thudding into de Kock's gloves"
"and another Dickscoop from Sri Lanka's ice cream man, this one sails all the way! Impudent stuff, the ball was outside off but he went for it nevertheless and managed to trampoline the ball past his left ear and into the boards"
"backs away this time and cracks four back down the ground, more old-fashioned humpty but he gets another boundary and Rabada's figures take a hit"
squirted into the off side for a single
"pitched up and pushed through the covers, gets it into a gap for one"
"short and rifled over point, Dickwella freeing the arms to crack the ball to the fence once again. Used the pace and swatted it disdainfully away"
"fires the ball in full and straight, scudding into the pads and Rabada belatedly appeals - probably outside leg, decent comeback from Rabada, though. Dickwella bends down and tosses him the ball"
"good length around off stump, Mendis shows it a straight bat"
"probing away, 142kph on off, punched into the off side coming forwards"
"pitched up, Mendis leathers it... straight to mid-off! Hit slightly high up the bat, wasn't the half-volley that Mendis was hoping for and it flew at a nice height to AB, who's got some of the best hands in the business, to take it falling backwards. Second wicket for Morris, SL's top order coughing and spluttering again"
"angled across, he drops back and plays the ball down... narrowly past his stumps! He was worried for a moment, there"
"short of a length, goes back to pull but sends it to short fine leg"
shuffles across his stumps and pushes a length ball towards mid-on - that's a wicket-maiden for Morris
short and wide to begin with - and the loosener is deposited on to the grass banks! Dickwella goes after it like a threshing machine on full bore and launches an uppercut for his second six
"steps away, cracked off a length over the covers, four more! Not a bad ball but Dickwella made room and slapped a rising ball dismissively to the rope"
"Parnell targets the body, Dickwella nudges it through midwicket for one"
"full on the stumps, punched neatly back down the ground, past the sprawling Parnell for one"
"holes out, Dickwella screws his shot to mid-off! Parnell gets his revenge and Dickwella departs for a T20 39 off 19 rather than the sort of substantial score Sri Lanka needed from one of their openers.

"full and sliding into the pads, Weerakkody glances fine for a couple"
"swings across the line, up goes the top edge - taken! Weerakkody looks despondently at the ground as he turns to trudge off. Took on the short ball from outside off but looked to have been beaten for pace. SL are in bits"
"good length around the line of off, defended"
"sliding on to the pads, de Silva works it away to fine leg"

KG sprays this one down the leg side
"better line, 144kph on off, shows it a straight bat coming forwards"
"gets forward and tries to leave, ends up playing it past his stumps into the leg side"
"bowled, the googly does for him! Tahir sprints off on his victory lap - it was a nice bit of bowling, to be fair, tossed up and spinning back in as de Silva tried to play across the line, might have got a sliver of inside edge before the zing bails lit up"
