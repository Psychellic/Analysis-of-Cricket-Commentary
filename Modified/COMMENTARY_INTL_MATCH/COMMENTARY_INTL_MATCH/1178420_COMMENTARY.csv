Pandey cut it so fine, it went into Samson's gloves and he held on. The batsman seemed to think about setting off for a run then decided against it, and in that process, lost balance. Samson broke the stumps at that precise moment too."

"<b>put down by Aaron diving to his left at short fine</b> Length ball outside off, Shakib walked way across his stumps and tried to flick it fine. Didn't time it, so the ball wasn't travelling fast. Aaron dived to his left and got hands to it, but couldn't hold on"
"<b>brilliant return catch by Unadkat</b>. He's shown Michael Jordan-like hang-time in the air. Brilliantly bowled slower ball on the stumps on a length. Hooda has no clue about it, way too early into the flick and he pops it in the air. It's flying above Unadkat but he times his jump perfectly in the follow through to pluck it with his left hand stretched out full, in the air. And he's pumped."

"<b>sitter dropped by Shreyas Gopal at fine leg</b> that was a quick one that hurried on to Saha, who could only paddle it straight up in the air. It was going straight to Gopal, who fluffed it."
"Oshane's not going to be denied for long. Saha's been out of cricket for a while and a pacy, back of length ball that's zipping in from off is not the easiest to face. He was giving himself room to try and swat it into the legside, but gets a thin top edge that is held by Samson behind the stumps."
greeted by a snorting bouncer first up and he ducks well under it
"<b>holes out to wide long on</b> another slower ball, length outside off. Shakib tries to fetch it from there and wants to pull it to midwicket, but it's a long boundary and he has to generate all the power himself.

"slower ball down leg, tried to sweep it but misses. Will be wide though"
"another slower ball, he's down the track to swat it over cow corner but it takes the inside edge to fine leg. They hustle for two, the fielder there was a mite slow in getting to the ball"
