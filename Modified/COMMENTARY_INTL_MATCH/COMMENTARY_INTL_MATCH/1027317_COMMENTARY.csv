"ambles in and finds his length, slightly too straight and Brathwaite is off the mark straight away with a nudge between midwicket and mid-on"
"too short, too wide and given the treatment, Lewis is away without delay too, a meaty thwock in front of cover and it races for four"
"two in a row, this time creamed on the drive! Pitched up outside off and Lewis just stepped out and languidly drilled the ball through the covers for another boundary"
"short of a length, this time he goes back and looks to tuck to leg, gets a leading edge"
"dug in short again, over the stumps and defended on the back foot"

"length ball, straight line, tucked to the leg side"
"shortish, bit of width outside off but Lewis finds point with a stand-and-deliver push"
"similar line, again Lewis draws himself up to punch in front if square, cut off by a dive at cover"
"on a length, comes across and taps into the off side"
"slightly short, Lewis looks to work across the line... but a leading edge loops to cover, well taken diving forwards! Finn looks delighted, that's his 99th ODI wicket and England have the breakthrough. Looked like the ball maybe stopped in the pitch but Lewis, who blazed his first two balls to the fence, goes without adding to his score"
"length ball, good bounce in the channel as Powell presses forward and blocks"
"short and slightly wide and Powell throws the bat through a firm cut, sends the ball whistling through backward point to get off the mark with a boundary"
"<b>dropped!</b> Full and chipped towards mid-on... where Morgan <b>can't quite grasp it!</b> He made a superb leaping effort, going to his left after Brathwaite popped the ball back high in the air, Morgan got one hand to it but the ball squirmed out as he hit the ground"

pitched up and pushed along the ground towards mid-on this time
"length ball, angled in on the stumps, Brathwaite nudges towards square leg"

"shorter length, turned defensively into the leg side from the crease"
"good length in the channel, Powell steps out and cushions the ball into the covers"
"short ball, over middle and leg, tucked towards midwicket on the back foot"
"half a shout for lbw as Finn rips one through Powell, trying to play to leg... High and probably pitched outside leg, though"

"short of a length, Powell blocks from the crease"
"tight lines from Finn, pushed towards mid-on as Powell moves across his stumps"
"banged in short, goes for the pull, big top edge - and Finn pouches it, for his 100th ODI wicket! Powell falls going for the big shot when strike rotation might have been more prudent, possibly done for pace although it only clocked around 80mph"
back of a length on the stumps and worked to the leg side
"angled in, Hope waits in the crease and flicks to leg, again it is cut off"
"length ball around middle and off, defended"
"slightly back of a length, fourth-stump line, pushed into the covers"
"shorter, wider and Brathwaite flashes, it flew quickly and evaded the leaping Root in the gully... Would have been a blinder if he'd managed to take that, but think it missed the fingertips"
"back of a length, driven firmly in front of square but Billings makes a superb stop at cover point"
"this stays low, scuttles past the outside edge with Hope on the back foot, bobbles through to Buttler"
fuller and straight and pushed back towards mid-on
drifting in on to the pads and Hope nurdles one through square on the leg side

"good length, presses forward to push towards mid-off"

"back of a length, Hope gets on top of the bounce and rattles his wrists through a rasping square cut that flies to the fence"
"straighter line and turned down into the leg side, early call of 'No!'"

similar back-of-a-length ball and again Brathwaite returns it to the bowler

"dug in back of a length, worked off the body to midwicket"
"kicking off a length, 130kph/80mph and fended off into the leg side for one"

"back of a length, drops into the crease and opens the face for one to third man"
"bit of width, Hopes throws the hands through a violent-looking cut... only to nick tamely to the keeper and give Stokes a wicket! Didn't bounce as much as he was expecting and took the under-edge, but that's a blow for WI, with Hope the nearest to a fluent-looking batsman we've seen"
"shortish outside off, stabbed down towards point"
"pitched up and Mohammed is on the front foot, strokes the ball gently towards cover"

a wristy drive into the covers for another single
"banged in just back of a length, flicked out to midwicket with no great intent"
"slower ball, takes an eternity to reach the batsman as it sticks in the pitch. Dabbed out to point with a cross-bat waft"

"slightly back of a length, and a well-disguised googly. Mohammed dances to cut, and adjusts late"
eased into the leg side
"a fraction short, and panned out to cover. 'YOU'VE GOT TO RUN IT HARDER!' bellows a very bellowy chap in the stands. He's been making enough noise for the whole island today"
"crunched to the leg side, but straight at the fielder. Lots of meat in that stroke."
"similar shot, less power but more placement this time, as the sweeper at cow corner jogs round to field"

"wicket to wicket line, draws the batsman forward to defend"
"spanked into the leg side, who needs footwork when you wield your bat like a scythe?"
"a lofted clip off the toes, looking for two but that was sharp work in the deep, hurtling in to limit the damage"
"another measured single, and there's the fifty stand. Well done, keep at it"
tapped down to long on to return the compliment
"a bit of width, and patted into the covers"

"onto the front foot, and drilled to cover"
"tight wicket to wicket line, blocked with a full face to the off side"
"hauled into the leg side, an ambitious pull, but Stokes is well positioned to intercept"

"into the covers, on the front foot"
"back of a length, whittled to the leg side"
"spank! Four dots had built the pressure, but with the ball not turning much, Mohammed plants the front foot and heaves clean through the line. Well played"

"make that 100 dot balls, as Finn finds a good length and Brathwaite pushes to cover"
pushed into the gap
"banged in short and wide, Mohammed climbs into an ambitious cut, against the wind, and Plunkett was briefly in business in the deep"
tucked off the hip to the leg side
"<B>dropped!</B> And that's a stinker by Stokes of all people at midwicket. A bouncer from Finn, outside off stump and Brathwaite was never in control on the pull. Nor was Stokes, who seemed to have done the job, back-pedalling under the ball, but it just ricocheted off his chest... And he's leaving the field with a damaged finger as a consequence too ... whoops"
"outside off, tapped down to third man"
forward and tapped to long-on
"back of a length, gentle turn from off to middle, tapped to gully"
an ambitious appeal as Brathwaite is caught on the crease
"down the track, through the gate, stumped by a country mile! Brathwaite looking to step up his tempo with his fifty approaching, but Moeen found just enough turn from a tight line, to beat the inside edge of an attempted loft over the leg-side, and Buttler did the rest"
"round the wicket to the left-hander, pushed down to long-on"
"outside off, chopped to cover"
onto the front foot and drilled back to the bowler
"good lift on an off-stump line, fenced to the gully"

another dot to add to the pile of dots
squared up and a leading edge loops tantalisingly out through the vacant backward point
worked to the leg side
"big turn, leaning forward"

"forward, clipped to midwicket, and a misfield from Bairstow enables a hesitant single to be completed"
forward and defended
"too full from Finn and that's a good stroke. Head right over the ball at the point of contact, and smacked through long-on"
"lifting off the deck, dabbed to gully, and they steal an overthrow as the shy ricochets off the non-striker's stumps"

thick outside edge flies down to third man

banged in short and down the leg side
"patted to cover, and a clean pick-up from Morgan could have been a run-out! A bit of confusion between the wickets as Windies attempt to pick up the pace"
"short, and banjaxed over deep midwicket to bring up the fifty in fine style!"
"angled out to the off side, no way through there"

hauled out to the leg side
"worked for the single, and that will be <B>drinks</B>."
"round the wicket, back of a length and worked off the body - they wanted two but won't get it"
"full and straight, flips across the line... but it's ballooned off a leading edge and will be taken at mid-on! Mohammed has been done by the drinks break, a slight error of judgement and he has to depart, tamely chipped to the edge of the ring"

"angled in from round the wicket, straightening on middle and off, solidly blocked on the front foot"
"fired into the pitch, quicker and there's some extra bounce, turned back to the bowler"
"collared! That's in the stands...! Carter gave Moeen the charge and heaved this handsomely over long-on, he gave notice of his power in the first match and that's another impressive blow"
"goes back this time, skidding on to hit the outside edge, stayed low and the ball ricocheted into Buttler's pad... The keeper appealed but there was clearly bat involved"
punched back down the ground for one - so Moeen finishes with a tidy 1 for 44 from his ten
"short of alength, clipped off the body towards mid-on"
"angled in with the arm, Carter flicks at it and the ball runs away off his pad"
"short of a length over off stump, defended standing tall"
"short again, Holder is on top the bounce thanks to his height, dabs towards gully and they pinch one"
"swings across the line, another skied top-edge... and safely pouched at mid-off! West Indies are threatening to subside here, Carter gave Moeen some humpty in the previous over but Plunkett is a different proposition, not quite full enough to hit down the ground and it skewed high but only as far as the edge of the 30-yard circle"
played towards mid-on from the crease
"touch back of a length on off stump, defended down to the off side"

"flighted legbreak outside off, driven through the covers and they hustle back for two"
"slides this one on, into the pads as Holder goes to sweep... Was there any bat involved? The umpire thought so but Rashid and Buttler were keen on the lbw and Morgan decides to <b>review</b>. Looks like this will be close, don't think he got a bottom edge on the ball... pitched on middle and leg, spinning towards off stump - but it's umpire's call! Fractionally past the midway point of the stump and so it <b>remains not out</b>. That's about as close as you can get, without getting it - you get me?"
"floats up the googly this time, spinning back in to hit the front pad"
"again Rashid slips the googly past the inside edge, Brathwaite not picking it as he tries to work across his pad, this might be closer to lbw... but again umpire Duguid shakes his head"

"brutal from Brathwaite, there's the power we know he has, picks up the short length early and muscles a flat-batted whack past deep midwicket"
"back of a length, makes a bit of room and swipes through cover point"
"short ball again, Holder pulls flat down the ground for one more to long-on"
"slogged into the air, Rashid backpedals... and takes a good catch! Reward for Rashid, he tossed the ball up and Holder swung lustily across the line, sent it about 24 yards back down the pitch but the ball was swirling as it came down and Rashid did well to hold on falling forward to his knees"
"full and in the slot to drive, and he's mullered this, straight back past the bowler as Rashid throws a hand out and it flashes to the rope"

"tossed up outside off, punched into the covers coming forwards"
"flighted, possibly the googly, hits gloves and pad, I think, but drops a few inches past leg stump"
"steps out, Brathwaite hammers this into the leg side, but it won't quite carry... Roy takes the catch and relays it in and that's good night, Kolkata! He must have been hitting into the wind, because I'm certain that would have gone all the way at Eden Gardens. Smartly done by Roy on the boundary rope at wide long-on, he nonchalantly tossed it back underarm as he stepped out of bounds and Billings completed the dismissal"
"legbreak tossed up on off stump, pushed square"
"pushed through a little flatter, skids past the bat and into the gloves"
"floated up outside off, Nurse leans into a drive to the cover sweeper to keep the strike"
short and down the leg side and Nurse swivels to send it packing to the fine-leg boundary
"bowled him, straight through a yawning gap! Nurse was going for the straight yahoo, he held the pose nicely... but you couldn't have squeezed Rahkeem Cornwall between his bat and pad"
"pitched up on the stumps and driven back down the pitch, Plunkett gets fingertips on it and the ball hits the stumps at the other end... but Bishoo was in"
length on the body and turned away for a single
"sensational from Buttler, a run-out finishes it! Gabriel was barely in the frame as they tried to scurry through for a leg bye, the ball had deflected away to Buttler's left but he raced across, picked up and got around to throw right-arm - direct hit, job done"
"tight line, good run, nudged to the leg side, and through they scamper"
"edged and gone! Perfect line and length, full and threatening the edge, pops routinely to second slip, who parries the edge straight into first slip's grasp!"
"attacking the stumps once more, full and straight"
"onto the front foot, pushed into the covers"
"<B>edged again</B>, but this one dies just short of first slip! Feet going nowhere from Root, and you wonder if the keeper might have made an attempt to scoop that up. Lucky!"
"full, attacking, defended. Superb over to launch West Indies' ambitions"
"a fourth-stump line, decent carry, left alone"
"wheeled onto a good length outside off, Roy leans back for a drive but can't connect properly"
"<strong>brilliant effort, but dropped!</strong> Roy utterly smoked that pull through mid-on, but Brathwaite leapt with his right hand, got a good mitt round the ball, but couldn't cling on as he hit the turf. Quality attempt"
"tighter line and length, the chastened Roy blocks"
"huge appeal, and West Indies are convinced they've got their man! A shake of the head from the umpire, but sure enough, Holder <B>reviews</B> with the conviction of a robbed fast bowler. The bat was a long way from the pad, so any noise on Snicko, and this will be overturned ... but of course there is no Snicko, so this has to be the third umpire's judgment. There are sounds galore, including one that could be a nick, but nothing definitive. That could be the benefit of very severe doubt ..."
"outside off, and wafted out to backward point"
"very full length and clobbers the pad! No reviews left of course, but that was probably missing leg"
"that's a beautiful strike, Roy at his very best. Hitting smoothly through the line, head right over the ball and fizzing the drive to the ropes"
"on the pads, and through Carlos Brathwaite's grasp at midwicket! So nearly another outstanding catch, but couldn't quite reach it. England are living dangerously"

"on the back foot, defended into the off side"
"blocked into the off side, a tight and probing line"
"solid areas once again, angling into the right hander and forcing a defensive response"
worked into the off side. England content to bide their time in pursuit of what is still a modest target. West Indies' new-ball excellence has scotched any fanciful notion of hunting this down in 30-odd overs
"banged in short, that's a sharp and well-directed bouncer. Roy flinches inside the line"

"clubbed through the line, up and over mid-off, that's the ticket"
"on the pads, tucked into the leg side"

worked out to the covers
"outside off, and jabbed into the gully"
"back-foot once again, deflected down to the sparsely populated cordon"
tonk! That was the perfect hybrid between golf swing and lofted drive. Punching the arms clean through the ball and over the ropes!
dabbed into the off side
nudged into the gap to keep the runs ticking
"heave ho! A full-blooded wallop through the leg side, but the stiff cross-wind stops it dead in its tracks, and it is a long chase to haul the ball in a few inches from the rope"

"on the back foot, tapped to mid-on"
"angled bat, into the off side. Roy has no interest in Root's quick single"

"outside leg, a low full toss. Gets away with a clipped single"
"on the pads, whittled to the leg side"
spanked through midwicket. Stand-and-deliver stuff
up comes the fifty stand with another hoist through the leg side. Up on one leg and wristed round the corner. Roy is cooking
firmly blocked into the off side
finds the gap
"in the air, another pull into the wind, and it looked very much as though Roy remembered at the last minute that going airborne into that breeze isn't a wise idea. One hand came off the bat as the ball plopped short of deep midwicket"
off line once again as Root clips sweetly into the gap
"now the runs are flowing, on the back foot, punched with an open face through point. Lovely ball striking"
clipped off the pads again
"worked into the leg side, an expensive over to ignite England's chase"
"outside off, cut firmly to point"
"that's a lovely cheeky deflection, reversing the stance and flinging a reverse sweep through third man. Shot"
"looking for the conventional sweep this time, but beaten by extra bounce"
"another attempted sweep, looking to put the pressure on"
"on the back foot, attempted wallop through the off side"

good bite from a looping length. Well bowled

"well bowled, tight line and sharp turn, drawn forward in defence"

a pre-meditated wander across the crease to haul a pull out to deep midwicket
"another single, easy pickings"

"makes contact this time, but straight to point"
"punched into the covers, Mohammed can't gather cleanly"
"outside off, a bit of drift to beat an attempted nudge to third man"

"down the track, clipped to long-on"
worked to leg once again
"a swipe across the line, and it was a very straight line"
"battered high and hard down the ground, but he's not got hold of it, and once again that howling gale plays to the fielder's advantage. The ball stops in its trajectory, Brathwaite on the ropes swallows the catch!"
defended
deflected to square leg with a deft sweep
"lovely strike out to deep cover, onto the front foot and bisects the infield"
"round the wicket, head over the ball in defence"

"full face, and pushed firmly down to long-off"
another single to the single-hungry Root
tapped into the covers
finds the gap this time
"on the toes, whittled into the leg side"
sharp spin and an edge to slip falls short. Tricky out there...
"down the track, high-elbowed drive down the pitch"
"pushed through outside off, some turn as Root plays back, punched to cover"
"looped up, quite wide of the stumps as Root reaches out attempting to sweep, plenty of side spin as the ball jumps over the bat and into Hope's gloves"
"pushes this one through on the stumps, maybe the googly, Root prods it away"
tossed up and poked towards point on the back foot
"full, too full really, Root doesn't allow it to bounce in sweeping a couple off the toe between deep midwicket and fine leg"
"flighted, around off stump, steered through the covers for one more"

"full and flighted, Root watches it carefully and blocks"
"pushed through flat outside off stump, no turn and left alone"
"touch short, Root drops back and clips it though backward point, it rolls gently out towards the rope before stopping short and they come back for three"
"gives it some air, Morgan defends as the ball spins in on off stump"
"tossed up nice and high, uses the feet and bunts another single to long-on"
"sliding on with the arm, into the front pad - and given! Morgan consults briefly with his partner before deciding to <b>review</b>, though I think this is clutching at the proverbial straw. He played the wrong line and Hawk-Eye has the ball bouncing up to dislodge the off bail: umpire's call but that means it stays with Chris Gaffaney's original decision and Morgan has to go, taking England's one review with him"
"looped up full on off stump, Stokes leans over a forward block"
"flatter, skidding on and chopped through mid-off on the back foot to get Stokes up and running"

tossed up and nudged into a gap in the covers
"flighted outside off, Root punches on the front foot but finds the cover fielder"

"floated up on the stumps, Stokes leans on a defensive push"
"tossed up, drifting towards leg stump, hit on the pads but that would have been spinning down"
"pushed through, Stokes goes back to cut - well taken by Hope! Stokes looks at the floor, kicks his feet and mopes off. The Windies have another and they are doing their darnedest to make this interesting. Stokes got a thick edge as the ball spun and bounced into him, Hope following the ball well and soft hands doing the rest"
floated up around off stump and pushed into the covers
"Root continues to pootle along nicely, working another single off his hip"
"full outside off, spinning a touch as Buttler reaches out to defend"
"sharp spin this time, Buttler attempting to cut on the back foot and he gets a thick inside edge on to pad - lands safely"
"floated up on the stumps and worked to midwicket, Buttler had set off for a suicidal run and had to be told to get back quicksmart... good throw and take from Hope but he had <i>just</i> got his outstretched bat back over the line"
shuffles across and taps the ball away
"tossed up on off stump, Buttler pushes to mid-on - just one off the over, plus a few more jitters for England"
"tossed up, spinning away as Root pushed out, <b>edged but it evades slip!</b> Nurse was slightly wide, had to dive to his left and couldn't get there"
"goes back to cut, this time the edge is held, a juggling catch from Hope! England are having a confirmed attack of the vapours now, Buttler back in the hutch without scoring... He hung the bat out rather limply, again Bishoo got the ball to grip and lift and kiss the top edge, nearly escaped the gloves but Hope managed to cling on!"

"full on the stumps, Moeen steps out and punches to long-on"
"bit of drift and dip, Root goes back and flicks another single through midwicket"
"bowled him, neck and crop! Super delivery from Nurse, drifting in and then straightening to clatter middle and off stump, Moeen back when he perhaps should have been forward and England now running a severe temperature. Just what the doctor ordered from Nurse and Windies are threatening to steal this away"
tossed up outside off and pushed into the covers
goes back and lets this one spin away outside of the tramlines
"flighted, on the stumps, Root calmly turns it through square leg for one more"
"floated up, a nice tempter wide of the stumps, Woakes bites and hits the ball slightly uppishly through the covers for a couple"
"given some air, a touch wide and Woakes leaves it be"

floated up and worked back down the ground for one to long-on
"flat and angled in, Root works the ball away through midwicket for one more"
"Woakes sees out Nurse's final ball with a solid block - he finishes with 3 for 34, fine figures and it's given West Indies a sniff"
"short outside off stump, Root drops back and chops towards point"
"short ball, well directed, Root had the hands up instinctively but managed to hold his bat inside the line"
moves across and opens the face for one behind square
"good length in the channel, Woakes defends"
"short of a length, dabbed down on the back foot, there's a wide slip in and he cuts it off"
pitched up and bunted into the covers without timing - just one off the over
pushes through an offbreak slightly wide and Root steers through point
"tossed up, around off stump, Woakes punched through cover point"

"good-length ball, Woakes defends on off stump"
"dug in short, Woakes takes it on and gets a good chunk of his pull, flat-batted down through backward square, Kraigg Brathwaite does a sold job on the boundary to keep them to two"
short of a length and pushed away square on the off side
"length ball, Woakes moves across on off, blocked"
"good nut, this, fractionally back of a length, seaming and holding its line as Woakes prods at it, past the outside edge"
"full and driven, in the air... but it clears mid-off! More frustration for Holder but England will take the runs"
"on the pads, tucked to midwicket"
"on the toes, chiselled out to midwicket"
"on the back foot, punched down to long on"
"outside off, and wow, that was close! Root leaning back for the cut, cramped by slow spin, and nearly grazes a top-edge to the keeper"

forward to block
"tip and run, another single to the cause"
"looped up on off stump, and defended"
"back of a length, and chiselled out to midwicket with good placement into the gap"

"outside off, pushed to cover"
worked into the off side once more

tapped into the off side
"leant back and flogged through the off side, that was a cutter, but it was too short and wide, and Woakes hungrily snaffled the boundary"
"slower ball, and that one leapt off the turf like a tennis-ball legbreak! Hits the seam and nibbles off the edge, but dies short of the keeper"
good old-school piece of fast-bowler fielding. A big size 12 to save the straight drive
"slower ball again, tapped through third man"

"too short, spins back into a full-blooded cut shot to bring up a vital fifty from Woakes, who was the calm head that England needed at a moment of genuine crisis"

"a bit of width, chopped down to third man"

"a bit of bounce outside off, and through to the keeper, past a loose cut"
forward and nurdled to the leg side
wicket to wicket line
down the track and beaten past the inside edge
another single to the cause
another dot does at least mean Root is facing with three figures theoretically in his grasp...
"on the pads, tapped to midwicket. Nothing doing there"
"on the toes, another single"
"<B>dropped!</B> A bit of a long-hop, Woakes leant back to welly a welcome boundary, but toe-ended to Holder at mid-on, who can't cling on with his dive!"
worked into the leg side
forward and tucked out to deep midwicket
"one more single to the cause. Put a fork in it, etc"
forward and clipped to midwicket
"urgh, a dirty mow at a slower-ball cutter. The ball just about hops over the off stump, but that would have been an ugly way to go. Almost hauled himself off his feet"
"big appeal as Woakes walks across his stumps, but going down leg"
bashed into the covers. This is a good over in the circumstances!
"picks the slower ball this time, and the scores are level with a mighty bosh over long-off! The hundred partnership too, as Root's hopes of his own hundred are officially ended"
"lovely delivery! A looping fast leg-break that turns Woakes inside out. A bit late in the day for jaffas, but there you go"
panned into the covers... not yet ...
"a misfield at point, and there it is! England seal the series with a game to spare, after a spirited response to a very wobbly wobble in the middle of the innings"
