"Young's first ball nips in off a length, striking Taylor high on the pad. Headed down leg"
"Taylor sets himself for an ungainly swipe into the leg side. Not the best looking shot, and it's not particularly well timed"
"<b>but this one is!</b> Young pitched the ball right up outside off, searching for swing, but Taylor just put his left foot forward and slammed it straight past mid off for four"
"Young pulls his length back a shade, outside off, and Taylor dabs to point"
"<b>diving stop from Adair at mid on!</b> The other of Ireland's debutants today, and he's made an energetic start in the field, throwing himself to his right to stop another slog into the leg side by Taylor"
"just short of a length outside off, and Masakadza gets back and across to defend to point"
"in the channel, just outside off, and Taylor nurdles watchfully behind square on the off side"
"Taylor walks down at the bowler, but he can't get close enough to put the ball in the slot and has to be content with a tip-and-run single into the leg side"
Kane bustles in but fires this delivery down the leg side to be called wide
"that's better from Kane, who pulls his line back across to off stump to keep Masakadza quiet"
"Masakadza's off the mark with a push towards mid on, the call for a single coming nice and early. Good run"
"<b>flashed over extra cover!</b> Kane offered width, Taylor's eyes lit up. It wasn't quite a half volley, but he threw everything into the shot to clear the infield"
"and Kane's immediately back into his work with a full delivery that spits off a length, squaring up Taylor's defence"
"and he strikes straight away! Masakadza's poor form continues. There was no loosener from Young, and his first ball was short and climbing on leg stump. Masakadza chanced a pull at it, but the ball came off the back of the bat and spooned to second slip instead"
Ervine defends his first ball into the off side
"<b>pace and carry!</b> Young steams in and slams in a short one outside off, the ball zipping past Ervine's attempted pull and thudding into Wilson's gloves"
"on a length, outside off, and Ervine lets this one go"
"<b>hooked over deep backward square!</b> Young dropped another one short, but this time Ervine is deep in the crease and waiting for it, swiveling to slam the ball high over the infield, one bounce four"
"Ervine throws his hands at some width, bottom edging the ball hard into the ground"
"<b>and the shot goes through second slip!</b> Spotting the gap, Taylor immediately looks exploit it by opening the face of the bat and running the ball down past the lone diving slip fielder. Possibly a little more fine than he was aiming for"
"<b>caught at mid off!</b> Taylor came down the track, looking to clear the infield, but he sliced under the ball. Tucker backtracked from mid off, tumbling backwards at the vital moment to hold onto a swirling chance. Early wickets for Ireland"
"<b>swatted over cover point</b>. Adair offered width, Ervine cashed in. He didn't bother keeping it down"
"<b>past the edge</b>, or has he nicked this? Wilson appeals. But the umpire's not convinced"
"a length ball slants across Ervine, who runs it down to third man"
"<b>firmly punched off the back foot</b>. Zimbabwe have had a torrid time in Europe, but Williams hasn't been in the worst form, and he shows that he's still got some touch by standing tall to crack a length delivery through cover point"
"<b>floated up outside off, slotted through cover</b>. Kane offered up a long half volley, wide of off, and Ervine made the most of it"
"<b>through him!</b> Kane finds a much better length, and hits the seam to get this to nip back in to Ervine, beating his inside edge and the stumps"
whipped off the pads and out to deep square for one
"<b>shot of the innings so far.</b> Williams steps into a picture-perfect checked cover drive. It wasn't even a half volley, but he cracked it sweetly on the up"
"full again, and it's tapped to the left of mid off, who dives and parries as the batsmen take a single"
"whipped off the hip into the leg side, just the single"
"Getkate starts with a yorker first up, dug out into the off side"
"nudged off the hip into the leg side, a slightly greasy ball spills out of Delaney's hands at short fine leg, and they're back for the second"
"<b>top edged, all the way!</b> Ervine bends into a sweep, targeting the leg side. The ball balloons off a thick top edge, carrying all the way over the rope"
"firmly pushed down to long on to turn the strike over. Uppish, but safely wide of the bowler"
"full and it's slammed back at the bowler, who puts a solid right boot out to stop the ball in his follow through"
"width outside off, and Williams thrashes a cut through the cover field to <b>raise the Zimbabwean fifty</b>"
"full outside off, and it's tapped down to long off for one"
"reverse sweep from Williams, and short third man pulls out a dive to keep them to one"
"<b>HUGE</B>. Delaney floats one up outside off and Ervine lets his bottom hand lead as he smites a huge blow way, way over long on. Adair was down at the boundary's edge, and watched the ball sail over his head"
"Delaney loops down a low full toss outside off, and it's driven out wide of long off, where Young dives to stop it. Williams slips turning for the second run, so it's just the one"
"<b>onto the roof!</b> Williams gives himself some room, frees his arms, and swings cleanly through the line to collect the second six of the over, beyond long on. Delaney under pressure"
"chipped up and over the cover infield, the sweeper cleans up"
<b>it's raining sixes in Bready</b> as Williams clears his left leg and lifts Adair cleanly over wide long off. <b>That's the fifty stand</b>
<b>and again!</b> Williams stands tall at the crease and slugs a meaty hit over cow corner
"Adair switches to around the stumps now, zinging down a full, wide yorker that's dug out into the off side"
"short again, but Adair doesn't have the pace to hurry Ervine, who rocks onto the back foot and pulls well in front of square"
"pitched right up to him, and Ervine chips a single out to long on"
"<b>a full toss brings relief!</b> Williams might have hit this anywhere. It was a low full toss outside off, and he tried to slot it over the cover field, but couldn't get enough underneath it. Stirling tumbles to his right to hold a low catch, and Ireland have some respite"
"very full, just outside off, and it's dug out down the ground for one"
"Raza shuffles across and looks for a single close in on the leg side, but there's none to be had"
"and he's off the mark with a cute little dab down to third man, taking the ball almost out of the keeper's gloves, so late was his cut"
"<b>helped over long leg!</b> Ervine steps across to off, bends low, and picks a full one up and over the leg side field. That's the sixth six of the innings"
"Ervine looks to repeat the treatement, but Getkate aims fuller and even wider outside off, slipping the ball under the bat"
"a dipping full toss, outside off, is slapped out to the cover sweeper"
but his first ball is a long hop and Ervine steps deep in the crease to muscle a pull out to the deep midwicket boundary
"Ervine skips out to get at the bowler, but his Delaney dives to stop his straight drive"
"<b>there's Ervine's fifty</b>, driving a flighted delivery down to long on to get to the mark from 28 deliveries"
"quicker through the air, and Raza's caught in a slightly awkward position. This could well have been the googly, it didn't seem to break away"
chopped down to short third man for one
"Delaney spears in a full one, but Ervine opens up and crunches yet another boundary wide of long on"
"innovation from Raza, who walks right across to the off side and scoops a slower cutter down to fine leg. The fielder's inside the circle, so they're back for the second"
"<b>skied to extra cover!</b> Raza spotted a full one outside off and aimed for the long off boundary, but could only send a swirling top edge into the grey sky above the ground. Adair gets himself underneath it and holds on"
"pushed through too far outside off, and called wide"
"Ervine slashes a full toss over point, and it's stopped by the cover sweeper"
"Getkate hits a length on off stump, Burl backing away and driving it hard back at the bowler"
"Ervine walks across and fetches another full toss into the leg side. There's protection in the deep, but Ervine calls for the second, taking on Adair's arm. The throw's not quite good enough to catch him short"
"that's too good for everyone, the ball bursting past Ervine's heave into the leg side and bouncing off Wilson's pads into the leg side"
"and he spears in a very full one, from around the stumps, zipping the ball under Ervine's attempted sweep"
"<b>caught in the deep!</b> This was an excellent effort on the hoof from Kane, running around from midwicket to wide long on after Ervine cracked a high full toss out in his direction. He had plenty of ground to make, and a long on fielder in his eyeline, as well as the boundary marker. Top catch"
""
"slower ball from Adair, but it goes awry down the leg side and Moor helps it on its way to beat short fine leg"
"<b>Moor holes out, Adair has his fourth!</b> It was a knee-high full toss, aimed at middle stump, and Moor aimed to power it over the midwicket boundary. But he got more height than distance, Balbirnie coming in from the boundary to hold the catch"
"Burl backs away, Adair follows him, but the left hander works with the angle to clip the ball firmly through square leg to reach the boundary"
his first ball is short and wide outside off and Mutumbami gets up on his tippy toes to thrash it backward of point
"this time Young aims straight, Mutumbami driving down to long off for one"
"Burl eyes up a full ball outside off with a bottom-handed whip into the leg side, and they take on the fielder on the edge of the circle for a quick single"
"<b>tumbling catch from Tucker at fine leg!</b> Young dug this one in short, hurrying Mutumbami's pull. He didn't bother trying to keep it down, but couldn't get a good enough connection to clear the rope, Tucker making good ground and then tumbling forward to hold a low catch"
"slammed down the ground! Full, in the arc, and Burl threw everything into the shot"
"fetched into the leg side, where Getkate at midwicket sprints around to cut it off, hurling the ball back in to Wilson as the batsmen take him on for an unlikely second. Burl's run out, but Zimbabwe have reached a hefty total"
"short of a length outside off, steps across and clips it into the square leg region"
<b>leading edge</B> as he's through the shot very early with the flick. The fielder can't hold on to it at point. That length ball straightened from outside off

"length ball fired down leg, left alone"

uff that was a sweet sound! Length ball slanted in at off stump. Makes a bit of room with a step into the leg side and creams this wide of mid-off
<b>falls short of mid-on</b> as he miscues this slog. It's a knee-high full toss at off stump and he ends up slicing it. Fielder loses his footing as he tries to get to this
"cleared the infield on the off side. Short at off stump, jumps into the leg side and has a swish at this. Bottom hand comes off, but he's got enough to find the cover point boundary"

"short at leg stump, shoveled to deep square's right"
