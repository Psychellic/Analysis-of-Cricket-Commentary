"that's a bit of a dozy start - bowler sends down a wide full toss, batsman bunts it down to third man off a thick outside edge. Yawn."
"that's better! Races away through the covers, with Rohit's trademark timing. Brings down a straight bat, angles the face at the moment of impact and the half-volley screams away"
"<b>seams in at the right-hander</b>, and Rohit is unprepared for the movement off the pitch. His front foot is across on off stump, his bat has to come around it, and doesn't do so in time. Hit on the thigh"
"gently nudges it through midwicket, head over the ball and sweetly balanced as he meets the full ball on middle"
closes the bat face as he flicks a full length delivery on middle to midwicket
"defends a good length ball on off stump, playing with soft hands so he can pinch a single into the covers"
"shuffles back to punch the offbreak, pitched short and outside off, down to long-on"
"offbreak again, straying onto the pads, Rohit clips to square leg"
"looks like a googly, which Rohit looks to lash through the covers. But it peels off the inside edge to long-on, instead."
"wrong 'un again, pitching a shade outside off and turning in. Rahul gets forward to defend"
"good stride forward, soft hands meet the good length ball"
"gets back and across on his stumps, playing the length and playing it well as he flicks the flatter ball through to midwicket"
gets forward to a 139 kph good length ball outside off and pierces the gap in the covers.
hangs back against the shortish delivery outside off and deftly guides it to deep third man
he's into the drive a touch too early and the ball pops up in the air for a little distance on its way to mid-off
"he hasn't timed the ball perfectly, he does play the field very well. There is no one deep square on the off side, so he lifts it over the infield"
"slower ball, at a yorker length, on middle stump - everything right for an lbw shout, except Rahul's managed an inside edge"
"seems like the legcutter, on off stump, at a good length. Rohit covers it"
"legbreak, but it slips out of the hand and becomes a huge full toss. Rahul sweeps it powerfully to the deep square leg boundary. Clearly, the dew is messing with Dananjaya's grip."
"resorts to the offbreak, on a length outside off, and Rahul sets up to cut it away. With it not being as short as he thinks, he ends up bunting the ball to mid-off"
goes back and nudges it off his pads behind square leg.
<B>that's glorious</b>! A back foot punch through extra cover! And to a ball that isn't bad at all. Just short of a good length and only a shade outside off. But so quickly did he jump back that he makes the shot possible.
turns it behind square on the leg side
pushes down the ground to long-on to retain strike
"lets the back of a length delivery come on and dabs it behind point. Rahul looks up, Rohit responds, there is a hint of hesitation, but they make it with no direct hit"
"shapes to cut outside off, and oddly, he misses making connection"
"shimmies down, looking to hit towards long-on. But the ball skews off a bit of a leading edge through cover. A hint of seam movement for Mathews, hitting a good length spot on middle and off"
fine leg is inside the circle and Rahul gets a gift on his pads. Flicks it away square of the man
taps the bat on top of a length ball outside off and takes a single to cover point
"well taken at mid-on! This is a mistimed hoick from Rohit, the ball, which is on a length and a wicket-to-wicket line, hits him high on the bat and therefore does not allow him the power he is looking for. Chameera runs forward, dives and clings onto the low chance with both hands"
defends a back of a length ball outside off and dabs to point
"full and outside off, Iyer gets forward for a push through cover but nicks off through to third man"
full and sliding down leg. He tries to flick and doesn't make contact
shifts his weight back and pats the short delivery outside off to point.
"fullish on off stump, blocks"
"screams away through point! He is outstanding when he can use the bottom hand, and here he nails a backfoot punch, doing quite well to get on top of the bounce of a shortish delivery outside off"
"decent thinking - the slower ball - but it wanders down leg and with fine leg up inside the circle, all Iyer has to do is avoid him. Simple."
"pins him on the pads and it's <b>given lbw</b> by umpire Menon! Rahul though has asked for <b>a review</b>. Mathews is looking dangerous tonight, hitting the seam, on a good length, and in line with middle stump. Thereafter, he gets just enough movement, in this case, into the batsman to beat the inside edge and hit fairly high on the pad. Height could be a concern here. And considering off and middle stumps were visible at point of impact, line may not be adjacent either. <b>Ball tracking says it will be missing the stumps</b>"
"fuller delivery outside off, pushes through to sweeper cover"
"looks to drill the ball past mid-on, but it comes off the bottom of the bat. Mathews is not giving the batsman any room, while also hitting the deck with the seam"
<b>keeps low</b> and Iyer nearly drags onto his stumps. It seems to be a two-paced pitch and Mathews is doing splendidly to keep his line wicket to wicket
shows the full face to the shortish delivery and sends it down to long-on
"a more sedate straight drive, off the front foot, from Rahul to long-on"
"stays leg side of a shortish delivery outside off and carves it over extra cover. Not entirely timed, but he does make sure it at least beats the infield"
"drags the length down and Rahul is waiting for it. Furious pull over midwicket; actually it goes straight of midwicket, that's how early he saw that gimme"
"walks out of his crease and launches the good length ball outside off over extra cover. There is very little wrong with the delivery, just a good batsman expecting the ball to be fuller, and so he goes down the pitch to meet it with great glee"
"<b>some nip away</b> as he hits the deck in line with off stump, but Rahul is able to push it down to third man, even though he squares up on impact"
<b>beaten</b> by the ball bouncing a bit more than Iyer expects as he plays a glide behind point
lets the fuller delivery come on and slants it down to third man
works a shortish delivery on middle to the right of mid-on
"back of a length and outside off, steers it to deep third man"
defuses a good length ball on middle down to long-on
"charges out of his crease, but by doing so far too early, he gives Mathews the warning he needs to increase his speed, shorten his length, and target the batsman's body. Rahul is so badly cramped up as he tries to flick and gets struck on the box. Gonna need some time to recover"
"picks the short ball, swivels in his crease and pulls the ball into the stands behind square leg. Probably the first poor ball Mathews has bowled today"
"<b>almost takes out his off stump</B>. This is superb work from Mathews. Pitches it up, keeps the seam upright, gets it to move off the pitch and hurtles past the defences of Rahul, who looks in top form. Admittedly, the batsman had hared out of his crease, premeditating a big slog and losing his shape quite badly"
"fuller than good length ball in line with middle, Rahul, stuck in the crease as he inside edges through to deep square leg"
squares up Iyer as he hits the deck and gets the ball to straighten on off stump. Iyer uses soft hands and by virtue of that pinches a single to cover. It is Rahul's call and he does well
"that's superb work, waiting for the length ball, waiting until it reaches him and flicks it away to the long leg boundary. Works the angle of the ball coming into him, and also makes sure it beats long leg to his right"
taps a good length ball outside off through point
reads the slower ball and slices it in front of point
"shifts back in his crease, dabs the shortish ball on leg stump by his feet and races across for the single that brings <b>his fifty</b>. Splendid innings. Very few wasted shots."
"full toss, as he runs in from around the wicket, and Rahul ends up hitting it right back at Fernando. Grimace from the batsman, he's missed out"
"lashes it behind the boundary rider at point. He hits it in the air, but with the amount of width he has to take on, he knows very well that he can beat the fielder"
"angled into his pads, with Fernando still bowling around the wicket, and Rahul all but scoops the ball to long leg"
"fuller delivery outside off, eases it down to deep third man and gives the strike back to the man who looks in scorching form. <b>Partnership over 50</b>, with Iyer contributing only 16"
"slower ball outside off, Rahul shapes to cut, but he doesn't quite figure out the change in pace. Inside edges to the wicketkeeper"
"length on middle, Rahul tucks it to midwicket, seemingly into the shot a touch early and having to adjust with his hands, rolling the wrists on top of the ball"
"beautiful cricket. Watches the ball so very carefully and that triggers the instincts honed through years of domestic cricket. They tell him this ball is outside off. They tell him it is short in length. He moves back deep in his crease, waits an age for it to arrive, and pulls off the loveliest of late cuts"
"turns it away through midwicket, and with the ball going along the ground, it picks up a lot of dew. That won't help Dananjaya"
"short and outside off, Rahul pulls it hard to deep midwicket"
flicks a length ball off his pads to deep midwicket
"legbreak, which he lands well enough considering the moisture around. The batsman shifts back and flicks it through vacant midwicket"
"<b>teaser</b> and Iyer nearly falls for it. He's drawn forward by the lavish flight, looking to hit it over extra cover. But the ball dips before he can get there and turns past the outside edge"
"hangs back, swaying away from the line of the short ball, meant to cramp him and goes for the cut. But extra bounce makes sure the ball goes off his glove to point"
"stays still on middle, spots the ball slanting into his pads, and whips it away to long leg. He nearly times it so well that the ball carries all the way to long leg"
"shortish and outside off, he slices the ball to deep third man. And dew nearly makes Mathews give away a boundary. The ball slips right through his hands"
"<b>caught behind</b>. Iyer backs away to try and hoist the ball to third man, but the ball cramps him for room, kicks up more than he expects, takes the top edge and settles in Dickwella's gloves"
"offcutter, in line with off stump, Dhoni is forced into using his wrists to keep the ball down since his feet aren't moving yet"
"bangs the ball in just back of a length and it gets more pace and bounce than Dhoni is ready for. Gets an inside edge and as it skews away towards midwicket, they pinch a run"
gets down the track and flicks the good length legbreak outside off to deep midwicket
whips a shortish delivery outside off to deep midwicket
that's a violent swipe to long-on! He gets out of his crease and unleashes a bottom-handed thwack that might well have taken out Rahul at the other end. That's the shot the long-haired Dhoni played every other ball
"a shade short, which is the often the only response for a spinner after he has been hit as hard as that by an advancing batsman, and Dhoni cuts to short third man"
sweeps across the line of a legbreak and is beaten
"well bowled - this one drifts into leg stump, and then dips before Rahul, trying to push himself forward, to the pitch of the ball, can get there. So he has to roll his wrists to keep the ball down. Dananjaya tries to get across, but he slips and misfields"
"shapes for the cut, but the slower ball cuts back into him and cramps him for room. Rahul can only get a single to point"
"comes down the pitch, but the slower ball works again. Good on Thisara to make sure the length is short enough that the advancing batsman can't get under it."
"bowls him! Beautiful wicket. He knows India are desperate for quick runs. So he denies them pace. Rahul, earlier in the innings, when he wasn't panicking about his rate of scoring was picking those out of the hand. This time he slogs across the line, loses his shape and then his middle stump"
"shortish and on middle, nudges it to long-on"
"down the track, but Thisara ensures the ball is short, and doesn't have too much room either. Dhoni pushes to long-on"
full and outside off - no pace on it again - Pandey looks for the cover drive and is beaten
"advances again but Pradeep ensures the line is on Dhoni's pads, cramping him and preventing a free flow of his hands. Doesn't get any bat to this and settles for a leg bye into the off side"
"full and on middle, Pandey clips to short midwicket"
"slaps a short delivery, only a shade outside off, to deep cover"
extra bounce as Dhoni works a shortish delivery outside off to deep midwicket
"pats a good length ball, off the bottom of the bat, to long-on"
gets across onto off stump - as opposed to running down every ball - and flicks a shortish delivery to long leg
full and wide down the leg side. Dhoni's swing can't get there
gets the length he wants - or rather creates it by coming down - and swings that big bat as hard as he can to send the short ball away to the midwicket boundary. Dhoni on the move
"looks for the yorker and nails it well enough. Dhoni, preempting it, hangs deep in his crease and drills it to long-on"
"in the slot on leg stump, and Pandey sends it soaring to the crowd at midwicket. Clears the front leg and unveils a full swing of the arms. The bat started over his head, came down to meet the ball, and then ends up behind his back"
"looks for the yorker, but it ends up a wide half-volley. Pandey lashes it to the cover boundary. Opens the face to get that gap, to the right of the sweeper"
"slower ball - and it's launched straight down the ground. Looks glorious as the ball flies towards the sightscreen. But there isn't quite enough on the ball to beat long-off and long-on running across. Great effort from Shanaka at long-on, he would have been upset by his team-mate going after the ball, but still pulls off a diving save"
"another slower ball, which Pandey tries to smash straight down the ground again. But he gets a thick outside edge to third man instead"
"change of pace at 110 kph, on a length and outside off, Pandey drills it to long-off"
"low full toss outside off, which Dhoni smashes to deep cover. Sensational timing. Good effort from the man in the deep, Asela Gunaratne, moving to his right"
"off-pace delivery, on a length, slogs it to long-on"
"brilliant! He knows by now that Sri Lanka are banking on the slower balls. So he holds his position nicely, waits for it to get near him and then deflects it to the left of short fine leg. Top shot"
<b>goes just over extra cover</b>! Dhoni looks to hit the low full toss over the offside infield and nearly ends up caught by Gunaratne
"nails the yorker on a fifth stump line and Pandey can only squeezes it out for a single to point. Good recovery from the captain, showing all his T20 experience, especially in these death overs"
"brilliant work, another yorker, outside off, and Pandey bunts it back at the bowler. Pradeep is so very good at finding that length. Even with a wet ball..."
"looks for the blockhole again, away from Pandery's reach, but it skirts too far wide outside off"
"another yorker at 140 kph, and Pandey, getting his back leg across outside off, pulls off a helicopter shot that goes along the ground to long-on"
"shuffles across outside off, so Pradeep goes wider with his yorker, and strays past the tram line. Dhoni leaves and collects the extra"
nails the blockhole and Dhoni squeezes it out to deep cover. Poor Pradeep finds it unfair that they picked up two for that.
"the yorker goes wrong and Dhoni pounces on it. Low full toss, giving Dhoni the room to free his arms and power it away to the midwicket boundary"
"continues attacking the blockhole, wide outside off, Dhoni just about plants his bat out for a single to third man"
"<b>that is outrageous</b>! He knows it will be a wide yorker, and originally he seems to get low in his crease to get ready for it. But then he sees a beamer coming at him and ramps it to the third man boundary"
"smashes the low full toss outside off - the free hit ball - through the cover boundary - and Pradeep, because of a couple of full tosses - ends up leaking 21 runs. It was brave of him to keep going for the yorkers, and he did hit the required length a few times. But there is such little margin for error in this game, at this stage."
"yorker outside off, Dhoni drills it to long-on and picks up a second as well."
"another yorker on off stump, Dhoni lashes it to long-off"
"low full toss, tailing into middle, Pandey is set up to launch it over midwicket, but because of that tiny bit of movement, ends up inside edging it to short fine leg"
digs this out of the blockhole and picks up a single to long-off
"full and outside off, Pandey swings it out to long-on"
"hangs deep in his crease and heaves it over deep square leg! A low full toss from Thisara, on middle, becomes the perfect ball for Dhoni to end the innings off on a high"
"back of a length and outside off, slices it to deep third man"
"gives him width and Tharanga produces a picture perfect cover drive. Pure timing, pure grace and Iyer, the man in the firing line, misfields"
stands perfectly still in his crease - when he really should have been forward - and swings across the line of full delivery outside off. Inside edge down to long leg
"fullish on off stump, blocks and runs to cover"
"backs away, considering there is no one in the deep on the off side, and somehow lifts a good length ball pitching way outside leg stump... over cover"
"slower ball, into the blockhole outside off. Dickwella glides it to point for a quick single. It's a tight one, and that's why Pandey goes for the throw at the stumps. And the fielder backing up, Chahal, mucks it up by not getting down quickly enough. Overthrows for four"
there's competition for the title of 'little Sana'. Dickwella brings out his wrists to bully a good length ball looking for the top of off stump away to the square leg fence. Superb hit
dabs a back of a length ball to short third man.
"he slips and falls over while trying to attack Undadkat. The idea is to get down the pitch, making room for himself, to hit the ball over cover. Doesn't make contact and looks a bit worse for wear."
"taken at cover! His plans are okay, making room to hoist the ball over an offside infield that is packed to the brim. But Unadkat foils them all with a slower ball. Unaware of that, Dickwella, who is making room to get away from the ball, is in the worst position possible. He is reaching, he is hitting the ball with only one hand on the bat, and he skews a simple catch to Rahul. Beautiful deception for a maiden T20I wicket."
"this is at top pace (133 kph), hitting the deck on off stump and seaming into him. Kusal tries to nudge it through midwicket, but gets a leading edge to third man"
"kicks up off the pitch as he goes full pace again (134 kph), and the back of a length delivery on off stump thuds into Tharanga's bat somewhere near the handle"
"back of a length on middle and leg, clips it through midwicket"
"goes for the bouncer, but Tharanga wants nothing to do with it"
"back of a length and a shade outside off, swings it to mid-on"
"launched over midwicket! He's not often known for his legside strokeplay, but here he simply plants his front foot down the line and slogs the length ball away with superb timing"
"cramps him up with a short delivery on leg stump, Tharanga flicks it away, looking a bit uncomfortable, to deep square leg"
there's not much bat on this front-foot swipe as Pandya gets just enough bounce that the ball hits the high part of the bat and not the middle.
"length ball on off stump, defended towards extra-cover"
"slower ball on a length, close to off stump. Lets it come on and dabs gently towards backward point to pick up a quick single"
"back of a length, and this one jags back off the seam and some extra bounce too. Wanted to stay leg-side of the ball and jab that through the point region. Got a thin edge, onto glove, and the ball died before it reached Dhoni behind the stumps. Yorked him, it looks like. The lack of pace did the keeper"
"another slower ball, offcutter. Looks to push towards mid-on, plays a touch early and pops a leading edge up down the pitch. Unadkat tries to dive to his left but slips and doesn't get near the ball"
"back of a length, angling into off stump. Gives himself room and stabs towards backward point"
"slower ball, fullish and outside off. Opens his bat face and steers to backward point. Just two off the over."
"starts with a flat one close to leg stump. Saw Tharanga make room and looked to cramp him and fire one through. Slashes at it and misses, and that didn't miss leg stump by all that much"
"well played. Knows Chahal doesn't want to give him any width, and therefore steps across and gets down low to sweep up and over backward square leg"
"and Tharanga will continue hitting it where the fielders aren't. Not a bad ball. Again saw him trying to make room and fired it at his body, back of a length. Just got enough room to free his arms and shovel it over mid-on"
"fired in flat, on a length, at the body. Tries to sweep and misses. Just clips the outside of his pad"
"flat, down the leg side, and Dhoni takes a beauty down the leg side! Goes for that sweep again, and gets a thin inside-edge onto pad and then to Dhoni, who's in position nice and early and makes it look easy"
"tosses it up on middle, Mathews defends"
"hits him high on the bat as that back spin coupled with back of a length makes the pitch respond to him. Kusal, with no room to work with, can't do much but defend"
works a shortish delivery on middle and off to midwicket
"opens the face against the short ball outside off, but there's plenty of protection at point"
does him with the offcutter - pitched up outside off with no change in the action. Mathews is left wafting outside off
"another slower ball, this one at back of a length. Mathews, stuck in his crease, reaches in front of his body to defend awkwardly"
shifts back in his crease to a quick delivery aimed at the top of off stump and flicks to midwicket
"googly first up, and Kusal, looking to cut the ball, suddenly has to change his shot and work it to midwicket"
"pulls out a reverse sweep - not the worst option to a tossed up ball outside off stump, no chance of lbw - but finds point"
"comes down the track and flicks to midwicket. Kusal wants an extra run, but Mathews sends him back"
nudges a tossed up delivery on off stump to deep square leg
"reverse sweep again, to a ball that is outside off. Gets just enough bat on it to beat the wicketkeeper. Chahal is fine enough at short third man to catch up with the ball"
"loopy delivery on off stump, Kusal slogs away, getting an inside edge to short fine leg"
"starts with a googly, and Kusal seems to pick it, playing the cut shot to deep point"
"tossed up, dips down, spins enough and he's gone. Mathews is searching for the ball as he comes forward. Then, because of the run-rate, he pushes at it with hard hands, nowhere near the pitch of the ball, and spoons a simple return catch. Gorgeous bowling from Chahal"
"pushes a length ball on leg stump to long-on, careful to keep a straight bat and not let it push too far in front of his body"
reads the googly again as he backs away and crunches it to extra cover
"another one that spins away from the left-hander, who shifts deep in his crease and shovels it to long-on"
"gives it some air on off stump, Gunaratne knows it will dip, waits on it and then pats it down to long-on"
flicks the flighted delivery outside off to deep midwicket
"full toss on middle, which Kusal sweeps to deep square leg"
pulls a flatter delivery off middle stump to deep midwicket
"keeps to his crease against a good length ball, trusting his eyes and his wrists to deal with the spin. Even when it goes the wrong way. Googly becomes a single to long-on"
"goes for the reverse sweep, but the ball is tossed up too slow, and is too wide for the shot to work"
sweeps a flighted delivery a shade outside off to short fine leg
"has he just patted the ball into the stumps, instead of collecting the ball and whipping off the bails? In any case, Gunaratne is gone. Replays indicate that Dhoni fumbles, but gets lucky as the ball thuds into his gloves and ricochets back onto the stumps while the batsman is stranded out of his crease. Beautiful bowling, getting the ball to climb over the eyeline so he thinks he has a shot on offer. It drifts into him, forcing him to play against the turn. Then it does and does him around the legs"
"tossed up, and drifting in, Shanaka drives to cover"
"googly, he doesn't read it and goes for a push through the covers. Gets an inside edge instead"
drives through cover
works a flatter delivery off his pads to deep square leg. Googly again
"doesn't spot the googly at all! This is angled into the middle and off stump. Shanaka attempts to play through midwicket, and gets an inside edge to save himself from the lbw"
"clueless against the wrong 'un again. Good length ball, turns in sharply, catches Shanaka on the crease and high on the pad as he hastily tries a flick"
"cuts it over the top of point and short third man, but there is protection in the deep as well"
"taken at long-on! Shanaka goes for the big one, this time misreading the left-arm wristspinner's googly. Hits against the turn, gets it off the bottom of the bat and is caught easily by Pandya running in off the boundary"
comes down the pitch and works a good length ball off his pads to deep midwicket
"looks to drive through to long-off, but the ball skews away to long-on. Googly, so many googlies"
"thinks about a cut shot, but the ball is a touch too full and in the end he ends up playing no shot"
"pushes it through onto leg stump, Thisara flicks to deep midwicket"
"<b>another stumping?</b>. Chahal is grinning away as he fools another batsman with his googly. It's tossed up. It's wide. It's as tempting as the poison apple the queen gave to Snow White. Thisara dances down and goes for the slog. The ball joyfully dips under the ball, spins into Dhoni's gloves and he whips the bails off. That gives him the most dismissals by a wicketkeeper in T20Is."
"tosses it up outside off, works it to long-on"
"down the track, but Chahal pulls his length back and cramps the batsman for room. Kusal pushes the pad at it to prevent from being stumped. He tries to get a leg bye, but since he didn't play a shot, it will be dead ball"
"shortish and outside off, cuts to sweeper cover"
"<b>goes off the bottom of the bat</b>, as Dananjaya tries a pull shot. Chahal's googly doesn't find the target it is looking for - middle stump"
"shortish and outside off, cuts to deep point"
"sets up for a reverse sweep, ends up trying a reverse pull with Kuldeep shortening his length. Can't make contact"
"quicker delivery, pushed through on off stump. Gunaratne sweeps to deep midwicket"
stays back and cuts the googly to deep point
"straight up and Dhoni is on hand to take another one. Lures the batsman out of his crease, but doesn't let him reach the pitch of the ball. Makes him swing right across the line, it's a big top edge and it's a soft wicket"
flicks a good length legbreak to deep midwicket
"tosses it up outside off, defends"
"short of a length and outside off, flat bats it to long-off"
backs away and cuts to deep point
"back of a length, holds its line, Chameera looks to flick into the leg side and gets a leading edge"
good work with the wrists as Chameera sends a ball off his pads to deep square leg
"fullish and outside off, defends and gets an inside edge to deep midwicket"
"bangs it in short, way too short. Even a perfectly vertical bat from Dananjaya can't reach it"
"length ball, hammered back down the ground, but Pandya's hands are there waiting! India can do no wrong today. There is no celebration. He just turns around, hands the ball back and walks off."
"back of a length and outside off, blocks"
"goes for the bouncer, Chameera tries to pull, but he can't get anything on it"
"full and outside off, smears it down to mid-on"
"smacks a length ball down the ground for the first boundary since the fifth over, and only the fifth of the innings"
"full toss outside off, squeezed away to the backward point boundary. Back-to-back fours. Customary joke about London buses."
"yorker on off stump, Chameera gets it towards midwicket"
"appeal for lbw, but the good length ball <s>pings off the inside edge onto the pad</s> actually no, the two sounds were ball hitting both pads. But it would have gone down leg anyway"
swings at a back of a length ball outside off to no avail
too quick for him as he is struck on the thigh pad by a shortish delivery angled into him
"caught at deep square leg! Chameera swings as hard as he can at a length ball outside off but finds the Rahul, who moves to his right and takes it comfortably"
"fuller delivery outside off, blocks it nearly all the way to the cover point boundary"
"tame, very tame as Fernando backs away from the seam bowler and flails at the ball only to send it straight to the hands of point. <b>That's India's biggest victory in T20Is, in terms of runs</b>"
