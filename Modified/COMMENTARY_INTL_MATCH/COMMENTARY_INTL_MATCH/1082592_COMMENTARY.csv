starts off with a wayward delivery down leg. Thing to note is there's some swing
"short of length on off, this one nips back in sharply and Parthiv defends to the leg side"
whipped away off his hip to deep square leg
"nearly a run-out at the bowler's end. Buttler is lucky. What's more is he'll get four overthrows too. Turns this to short midwicket and sets off for a run, dishes in a full-length dive to get back in."
"sliding into middle and leg, Parthiv clips it into the fine leg boundary. Wrong line from Dinda. Too straight, nicely tucked away"
gets half-forward and punches the short of length delivery to mid-off
"width outside off, flayed on the up to Rahane at cover point"
too short and pulled away in front of square. Swivels back and swats that away between midwicket and mid-on
"back of length outside off, hint of nip away as well, left alone"
walks across the stumps and then uses his steely wrists to whip that behind square on the leg side. No chance for the fielder in the deep
gets forward and bunts the length ball outside off to cover
"much better line, length on off, not much room this time, Buttler walks out and blocks"
"length outside off, defended with soft hands"
pulled but straight to square leg
"top shot! Dinda errs in length again. Too short outside off, Parthiv rolls his wrists over the delivery and pulls him over midwicket. Imperious"
crunched but straight to Rahane at cover point. Missed out. This was overpitched and he timed it sweetly
play and miss. Looks to ease the away-going delivery behind point. Dinda shouts his lungs out but Dhoni hardly reacts
"driven on the up past the diving mid-off fielder. Didn't time it as well as he would have liked but it still raced away. On the up, delightful."
"<b> dropped! </b> Oh, dear. Bhatia has made a right royal mess of a straightforward chance. Parthiv slashes, the thick edge flies to third man where Bhatia is hit on the stomach as he looked to grab at that. It got to him much faster than he anticipated."
"starts off with a length ball on the stumps, dabbed to point for a quick single"
walks outside the crease and turns an incoming delivery to the leg side
"drags the length back just a little, he mistimes a pull to midwicket"
"thumped over the long-on boundary. Touch ahead of length, Buttler waits inside the crease and shovels it over the ropes. Intent, execution, all too good"
"scoops him straight over the keeper, flies over the ropes. Trademark Buttler. Bangs a short of length delivery outside off, Buttler walk outside the line of the delivery and then ramps it over. Wow, exhilarating stuff this"
"through him. Makes room to go over cover, but the ball nips back in to beat the inside edge"
gets outside the line of the stumps and sweeps him with the spin into the deep backward square leg boundary
"bowled him round his legs. Typical Tahir sprint to celebrate the wicket. The sponsor logo is nearly ripped off. This is fired full, Parthiv looked to sweep to early, but this one didn't turn much and beat the swing to crash into leg stump. Pune really needed this"
"quicker one outside off, punched to cover"
"pushed through quicker on middle and leg, worked to midwicket"
"drifting into middle and leg, pushed to the man coming in from long-on"
""
"short and wide outside off, slashed to third man"
"change in pace, slower and fuller on middle, pushed to midwicket"
"digs in a slower bouncer, took ages to get to Buttler who looked to play an upper cut. Nearly played two strokes before it got to him. Beaten in the end"
bisects cover and mid-off. Sashays down the pitch and slaps the length delivery into the gap. Don't bother diving
"muscular hit! This is Buttler unleashed. Too short, Buttler has all the time in the world to make room and then slap this over cover. Sitting up nicely for him to smack that. He was on one foot when he made contact"
"length ball on middle and leg, whipped to Tahir at deep square leg"
lunges forward and defends a tossed up delivery
"drives and gets a thick inside edge to short fine leg. Played outside the line, the ball dipped on him as well"
"done him with a beauty! This drifts in from length and zips off the track. Rohit's feet went nowhere as he looked to work it to the leg side, missed it completely and saw the sound of ball hitting stumps. Used the angle superbly there, delivered this from wide of the crease"
"too full outside off, squeezed to long-off"
he's on fire. Someone stop him before he runs all the way to Mumbai. This is Buttler walking back. Plays all around a length ball that skids on. <b> Unlucky though as he gets a big inside edge. </b> S Ravi raised the finger even before they completed the appeal.
"too full outside off, driven wide of cover as they jog the single"
<b> Smith has missed a run-out chance at the bowler's end. </b> Rayudu was miles out. Just pushed it off the frontfoot and took off without looking at his partner
uses the pace to help that down to fine leg
"swing and a miss. Length ball outside off, he looked to heave this over long-on but played too early"
"slow legcutter outside off, dabbed to third man as Rayudu jogs the single"
"angles a length delivery across the batsman, who bunts it to point. There's a direct hit at the non-striker's end but Rayudu, who had his back to throw, dragged his bat in before the stumps were broken"
play and a miss. Gets this to skid across at length
rocks back and pulls a short ball to deep midwicket
"gets this to drift away from the left-hander, who waits and then bunts it with an opened bat face to point"
this time he's too short and is punished. Rana rocks back and pulls that googly over deep midwicket. Muscular hit
steps out and works the quicker delivery to long-on
"slow turn from outside off, punched to long-off"
"too full on off, wrists it to long-on"
whips a length ball to deep midwicket
"floated full outside off, pushed to long-off"
chops one to point. Looked to cut but didn't have the room

worked across the line to long-on
"fires one in from wide of the crease, looks to sweep but the ball lobs off the pad to short fine leg. Played too early"
steps out and works it with the spin to midwicket
"slow turn from outside off, he steps out and works it against the turn to wide long-on"
"googly outside leg, looked for the turn as he anticipated a sweep. Rana went for it but this one was way outside leg"
"swung away into the gap at deep midwicket and long-on, Tahir runs around and fires a quick throw at the bowler's end but he was well in"
"drifting down leg, the googly gone wrong again, and Rana sweeps this past short fine leg. Neatly done"
leading edge but safe. Looked to work across the line again
"as far as return catches go, it can't get simpler than that. Another leg-cutter from Bhatia, looked like Rayudu was looking to go downtown but checks his shot and lobs it back"
"worked to long-on, off the mark"
"off-cutter this time, drives and gets a thick inside edge to midwicket"
gets a good stride forward and eases one to long-off
lunges forward and defends an away-going slower delivery back to Bhatia
uppish again on the leading edge but just lands short of the bowler
"length ball down leg to Dhoni, who fumbles. One extra run. Don't see that often, do we?"
"sensational shot! Bangs one in on middle, Rana pounces onto it in a jiffy as he pulls him behind square. Swivelled and transferred the body weight back before making contact"
"floats it full and wide outside off, squeezed to third man"
walks outside the crease and forces a full delivery to mid-of for a quick single
"slower and fuller on middle and leg, turned to midwicket"
uses the pace of the bowler to ease this down to third man
looks to walk across to whip it fine but misses. Was flirting with the wide and gets away with it this time
gets down on one knee and slogs this to the leg side where Stokes sprints 20 yards at least around the ropes from long-on to take it on the bounce
"off-cutter outside off, he looks to heave this over the leg side but got nowhere near the pitch of the ball and ended up skewing it to Dhoni, who called early and took it without much fuss."

punches a length ball to long-off to get off the mark
nurdles a length ball to midwicket
"length ball that skids in and keeps a touch low too, punched to long-on"
"welcomed to the crease for a new spell with a powerful hit. Too full, Pollard makes room and drills it over his head. Don't try putting your hand out to those."
"appeal for lbw, S Ravi had to decide if it was bat or pad first. <B> Replays confirm it was pad first. </b> That was crashing into the stumps. Pollard is lucky. That pitched on off and went on. Dhoni signals for a review jokingly"
worked across the line to midwicket
"touch short, he rocks back and pulls it into the gap at deep midwicket"
"goes over cover but didn't get to the pitch. On the bounce to Stokes, who attacked the ball from the ropes"
"fires one full on the pads, flicked to deep midwicket"
"hammered past Zampa even before he could react on his followthrough. Once againt too full, drilled. Good luck if you're going to try stopping that."
worked across the line to deep midwicket
"picked the googly but didn't get underneath the delivery to generate power off the big swing, heaved straight to Bhatia at deep midwicket."
lunges forward and eases one with the turn to cover
eased with the spin to long-off
"low full toss but he powers it down the ground, long-on comes around quickly"
thick inside-edge on the drive to deep square. Didn't pick the googly
driven with the spin to long-off
"pushed though quicker, this one fizzes from length, pushed to long-off again"
gets across the stumps and works the googly to midwicket
"one of the flattest hits you'd see for six. Down to the pitch of the ball and boom. Wow, what power. I want that bat. Nonchalance to the core"
"googly which he somehow manages to keep out. Tahir gets to the ball and fires a flat throw to the stumps, hits Pollard but he didn't even flinch."
thumps a full delivery straight to cover
"takes off after punching a length ball straight to cover, would've been gone had Smith hit at the bowler's end"
"<B> dropped. </b> yorker-length delivery outside off, Pollard looks to squeeze this behind point but gets a healthy edge through to Dhoni who fluffs a low chance to his right."
looks to muscle the pull over long-on but didn't get any power behind the stroke. Bat face turned in his land as it rolled to long-on
"fired wide outside off, around the seventh stump. You needed to be Joel Garner to reach that"
"high full toss, hit hard to long-off"
"looked to swing this to Mumbai, hit it towards downtown Pune. Thick edge off a slog to the third man boundary"
"full and wide outside off, hammered to wide long-off where Rahane slides to his left to cut that off"
"stunner from Mayank at long-on. Flat hit that was dying on him but he did well to attack the ball and put in an instinctive dive to pluck that inches from the ground. Lets out an expletive which I can't type here. Stokes, Dhoni run up to congratulate their mate. Pollard was struggling to time the ball since being hit on the elbow"
pushes the length ball outside off to long-off
"squeezed into the gap between cover and point, down to Tahir"
looks to send a length ball from outside off into orbit but misses
"full and straight on middle, Southee tees off like a golfer, connects as the ball smashes into the sightscreen. What muscle"
"sliced over the cover boundary. This is very poor from Dinda. High full toss outside off, Pandya was down on one knee as he used the width to generate the power on the swing"
"leg-cutter but lands it at length, Pandya waits and waits and then thumps this over long-off. This was sitting up nicely for him to swing through"
"MS Dhoni would've been proud of that. Nearest to an helicopter hit. Full and straight on middle from wide of the crease, brings the powerful bottom hand to meet the ball on the full and swing this over long-on"
thick edge past MS Dhoni's outstretched hands. Into the third man boundary in a couple of nanoseconds. Flew off the blade.
"this is nothing more than a short-arm jab. Clobbered over long-on. Bangs a short of length delivery but Pandya didn't have any room to work with, went through with the pull and picked the bones out of that"
"fires this full and way outside off, Pandya looks to carve this over point but can't reach. Not sure why Southee wanted strike. Runs all the way down the pitch but Pandya didn't move an inch. Dhoni hurls the throw to Dinda who breaks the bails at the bowler's end. Pandya;s back foot was briefly in the air and he just managed to put it down even as Southee got into the crease at the striker's end. They needed to look at multiple replays to decide who was out. Southee it is eventually, much to Mumbai's relief"
full toss which he could've swung anywhere he wanted over the leg side but missed. They somehow sneak in a run even as Dhoni fires a direct hit at the striker's end.
"short of a length, angling in, tucks to midwicket and takes off for a very quick single"

"too short and too wide, Rahane flays it over the backward point region and he has made good enough connection for the ball to go into the crowd"
"first, there was brute power and now it's deft touch. Again some width on offer outside off. Short of a length and angled across. Hangs back and delicately guides it between keeper and wide slip"

"drifting on the pads, tucked behind to short fine leg"
"<b>valiant attempt by Pollard but it evades him into the long-on boundary.</b> Rahane comes down the track and chips this one in the air. It seems as though it might be a straightforward catch for long-on, but so good was the timing on that one that it beats Pollard who puts in a full-blooded leap and still cannot get to it.

Smith walks across towards off. Pollard bowls it full and Smith whips it away to deep backward square leg where Vinay Kumar tidies up
"length ball, Dhoni cannot time this pull shot and the ball is fielded at the deep"
"is that the game! Smith launches one into the long-on stands and it is a humongous hit. Back of a length, outside off. It was a slower ball and took some serious hitting from Smith who clobbers it"
"and that is the game. Full, on middle, Smith walks across and flicks it over midwicket. Times it superbly and the ball carries the distance"
