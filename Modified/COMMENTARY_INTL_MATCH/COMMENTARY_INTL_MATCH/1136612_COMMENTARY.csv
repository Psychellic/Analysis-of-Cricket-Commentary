yikes. That's a horror start. Short and very far down leg. Wide.
<strong>beauty! Swing</strong>! A good length delivery pitched on off or just outside off. The ball pitches and swerves away from the prod late. Jaffa
"back of a length outside off, Shaw stands tall and punches to cover from the back foot"
"<strong>beaten on swing again!</strong> That's another beautiful delivery, back of a length outside off. Shaw looks to punch the ball through cover, but the ball swings and moves away late"
"back of a length on middle and leg, punched away to mid-on from the back foot."
"hoicked away over square leg. Chahar tries the other one this time, the inswinger. Back of a length down leg, Shaw picks the length early and pulls easily over square leg"
"<strong>beaten again</strong>! Good length delivery outside off, Shaw's feet are rooted in the crease as he drives. The ball beats the bat"
"was there glove on that? Sloppy glovework from Dhoni. Back of a length down leg, off the pad as Iyer misses a flick. Dhoni dives to his left, but the ball pops out for some leg byes."
"nice work. Good length outside off, outside-halved down to third man for a run. Thakur runs to his right and saves three."
"wow, Shaw struggling against swing! Full this time outside off, Shaw drives and is beaten comfortably. Very loose indeed"
"that's better timing. Good length outside off, punched to wide mid-off. The fielder dives to his left and saves runs, Bhajji the fielder."
"good length delivery outside off, tapped away towards backward point"
"good length around off, Iyer defends towards point solidly"
"swung away. Looking to go through the line. Full and wide outside off, Shaw throws his hands at the ball, mis-hit to mid-off"
"a good change in length but too short. Dug in around middle, Shaw ducks. Too high."
"full delivery outside off, a massive swing and miss from Shaw."
"he's picked the length of that. A slower delivery on middle and leg, Shaw reads the length and swats over midwicket with so much ease. A poor delivery."
"a full delivery on off, it's a wild slog over midwicket. Across the line. A thick outside edge races down to third man. I'm just wondering should such a young batsman be playing these shots so early in his career?"
"good length and straight, defended back towards mid-on"
"back of a length outside off, Iyer makes room and slices a cut to backward point. Picks out the fielder very well. But a fumble allows one."
"full on off, quick. Iyer comes down and pushes away to long-off. More of a leading edge"
"just over midwicket for a couple. Flat and straight, Shaw stays low and slogs a sweep over midwicket. He's looking quite bad with those strokes"
"quick, flat and straight, defended"
"good work. Flat and straight, Shaw slog-sweeps again over midwicket. Just clears the fielder. Thakur goes back and pulls the ball back in."
"<b>dropped</b>. Should have been taken. Quick and straight, it's another ugly across-the-line hoick that travels at head height to Thakur's right. He sticks out his right hand but the ball pops out."
"flat and wide, Iyer tries an open-faced dab but misses."
"and it gets worse. What kind of a shot is that? It's a good length delivery on off, Shaw stands in his crease and looks to hoick the ball over midwicket. No feet movement, no regard for the fielder at long-on. Exuberance, I suppose. But all he can do is splice the ball to long-on. That was not a very pleasing innings."
"good length delivery on off, pushed to cover for one. That's much better cricket, if the ball is not there for the shot, you take one."
"<strong>out with a direct hit!</strong> Good from Pant to trust his partner. But maybe he shouldn't have. A good length delivery down leg, Iyer pushes to mid-on, calls for one, realises his weight is on the back foot so he says no very late. But Pant is already down, he turns back and dives back. But the throw from the fielder is not accurate so he's fine. His wrist is not though. Some damage to his hand."
"clever batting! Makes room, clears his front leg, gets a ball to cut because it's short and wide. He goes from bottom to top and slices the ball over the infield, over point."
"a slower ball down leg, Iyer stands his ground and slogs across the line. Misses. Struck on the pad, but going down leg."
awful bowling. Tripe. He digs a slower bouncer outside off with third man up? Iyer has four free runs if he makes contact: he does with an upper cut over Dhoni.
"full and straight, some swing. Pant works the ball through backward square leg for a couple. He had to get bat on it because it swung back in."
"full outside off, a leaden-footed drilled drive finds mid-off."
"full and wide outside off, another swing and miss from Pant."
"and again! Wow, there is no improvisation or reassessment from Daredevils. Back of a length outside off, a swing and the ball goes over the bat."
"122 kph, a short delivery, aimed at the helmet. Pant watches this nicely, gets on top of the bounce and pulls through square leg for four. Nice."
"130 kph, another bouncer on off. Pant gets over the bounce and pulls, but finds midwicket."
"on the pads from Jadeja, 96 kph, worked to midwicket for one."
"flat and wide outside off, wanted to slog sweep but had to improvise a dab to point."
"on middle and leg, nudged away to deep midwicket again. One more run."
"gets his body behind the ball, like my cricket coach used to say. Short and wide outside off, carved towards short third man. Harbhajan dives over the ball but his broad frame stops the ball."
"beautifully played. That's all class. Short and wide outside off, sliced away off the open face through backward point for four."
"quick down leg, the pace beats Iyer's flick. Struck on the pad."
runs down and shovels a flick to long-on.
nicely bowled. Sees Iyer coming so he fires it wider. Defended to cover.
"short and wide, 91 kph, carved away to deep point."
"that's muscled. Feigns a forward movement then goes back, forcing a short delivery from Bhajj. Rocks back and carves his cut in front of cover. Lovely batting and execution"
"and now a good single. Slow outside off, tapped to point for one"
"a wide yorker outside off, jammed out. I wonder why spinners don't bowl that more, it's a very good defensive option, right?"
"angles this wide, but too wide. Called a wide."
"full outside off, Pant looks to drive but the ball goes past the outside edge, Just missed a straight ball."
"just over cover. Full outside off, chipped over cover for two. A sloppy effort from Thakur and Pant gets two"
"a length delivery down leg, Pant swings across the line, off the thigh pad down to fine leg."
"a slower ball down leg, Pant misses a flick. Off the pad to square leg."
"a slower ball outside off, driven to long-on for a run."
"full outside off, slogged away to long-on for one."
"on his toes, and slogged over cow corner! Full on off, and muscled by Pant towards the leg side. The ball straightened after pitching, but Pant's just too good"
"tries the reverse, but can't connect! It was full outside off, but Pant expected it to be closer to him. Stopped by MSD"
"good length outside off, and cut away past point! Men there inside the circle, but Pant manages to thread the gap with perfection"
"grip and spin! On off, but turning away from Pant. Defended with soft hands"
"flighted outside off, and Pant takes the bait! Slices it over Bhajji's head, and long off's getting under. Nope! Sails just over Bravo"
he'll keep strike. Good length outside off and he walks down the wicket to tap it towards cover
"back of a length on middle, and that's been pulled along the carpet. Man in the deep"
"too close to his body for the cut! On the corridor of uncertainty, but Iyer attempted the square cut anyway. Through to Dhoni"
"<b>cleaned him up!</b> Iyer tries to make room and cut, but Ngidi bowls straight on off stump. Iyer misses, Ngidi hits. Crashes into the top of off stump"
"full on off, and Maxwell flicks it away to wide long on to get off the mark"
"slower ball, and a length delivery on leg stump. Pant shuffles across to the off side, and nudges it off his hips to deep midwicket"
"full outside off, and Pant tries the big heave towards midwicket. Slices it though, and that's gone straight down third man's throat. <b>Lungi gets Pant</b>"
"full on middle and leg, and worked off his pads to deep midwicket. A walking single"
"gets off the mark first ball. Full on off, and pushed to wide long off with ease"
"on leg stump, and clipped off his pads to midwicket. No one's there, so Jaddu has to go chasing behind it"
"full just outside off, and defended with the bat's open face to point"
"back of a length on off, and spinning away from Shankar. Tries to defend, but the ball sneaks just past his outside edge"
"good length on off, and fended towards the off side"
"extras. Yorker, but outside leg. MSD does well to hang on to it"
"full on off, and pushed past the non-striker to long on. They walk across for another run"
"short on off, and he tries to hook it over square leg. Misses, and the ball goes through to MSD. Shankar looks at the umpire for a wide, but nope."
"full on off, and the straight drive goes to deep midwicket. That's because the bat turned in his hand"
"slower ball, and Maxwell mistimes to long on. It was full and wide outside off, and his attempted punch comes off the bat's inside half"
"full just outside off, and that's been drilled! Straight past Bravo, and even beats the man at long off! Bravo did well to get his feet out of the way"
"low full toss, and Shankar plays this towards wide long on. It was an attempted slower ball"
full on off and driven to wide mid off
"flatter on middle, and clipped off his pads to square leg. Two dots"
"flat on middle again, and Shankar goes onto the back foot. Fended towards short cover"
"full on off, and turns away from the batsman. He defends down the wrong line, and MSD whips the bails off. <b>Stumped?</b> Naw, his back leg was always down"
"<b>but he's gone this time!</b> What a terrible way to get out. Full on leg, and he tried to play the reverse sweep. The quicker ball sneaks under his bat, and crashes into the leg stump. Pays the price for playing a pre-meditated shot"
plays it to midwicket to get off the mark. Nice use of the wrists to give it a whip
"on off, and pushed off the back foot towards cover. Comes off the bat's outside half, and goes to deep backward point instead"
"plays it late, and chops it down to third man. Good length just outside off on this occasion"
"punched! But well stopped by Raina at cover. Stood tall, and played it well, but you know how good Raina is"
"short on middle, and that's been top edged! Bhajji makes no mistake at mid on. Quicker ball, and his inexperience to the pace shows. Not as good a performance as last time for Abhishek. The ball got big on him, and eventually cramped him for space. Looks like it's the time-out as well"
"full on off, and whips it off his pads to deep midwicket. Gets off the mark first ball"
"<b>lovely!</b> Short on middle, and Shankar adjusts towards the off side, and flicks it fine past MSD's left. Collects four to end the over"
"yorker, outside off. And Patel squeezes it away towards point. Off the bat's toe end"
"full on off, and worked away towards deep midwicket this time. They walk across for one"
"good length on middle, but sliding down the leg side. A run added to Daredevils' total"
"deja vu! Same line, same length, same result. Good length on middle, and going down leg"
"full toss outside off, and he plays the check-drive to cover. Well stopped!"
"played to the man at deep square leg this time. On off, but angling into his pads. Billings in the deep"
"slower ball outside off, and Harshal waits for a long time before fending it back to the bowler"
"boundary to end the over! That never hurts. Offcutter outside off, and slapped away to the point boundary"

"a short delivery outside off, the slower bouncer. Goes past Shankar's pull"
"a back of a length delivery outside off, Shankar mis-times a pull to long-on for one"
"full down leg, worked to deep midwicket for one."
"digs it in, Shankar reads the length early, stays back and pulls over deep midwicket for a big six. Far too easy once he picked the length."
a wide yorker that is well executed. Jammed away into the leg side.
"that's a good slower ball, it deceived Harshal Patel. But he got there early and still flicked the ball over square leg for six. Enough power"
"full on middle and leg, punched to long-on"
"full outside off, blocked to mid-off for a run. Nicely bowled from Bravo."
"a full toss on middle and leg, pulled away to deep midwicket. Very bad timing on that, under the waist."

"133 kph, a low full toss is worked away to deep midwicket for one."
"just clears mid-off. A good length delivery outside off, Shankar chips a flat-batted swat over mid-off for a couple."

"full and wide outside off, 134 kph, Harshal looked for a lap scoop but tapped it to point"
"a slower delivery outside off, mis-timed again to long-on for a run."
"excellent slower ball, the knuckle ball. On middle. A bit of extra bounce takes the ball over off and middle stump after beating a heave"
"a length delivery on middle and leg, slogged away to deep square leg."
that's a poor delivery. Right in the slot from DJ. A quick length delivery on middle and leg. A well-executed lofted heave over long-on. Full face of the bat.
"much better. A yorker outside off, jammed to long-on for one"
"another poor delivery. A length slower ball on middle and off, Shankar swats the delivery over midwicket. Picked the variation. Might want to change his line."
"length down leg, worked to deep midwicket"
"six more. A nice symmetry to this over: 6, 1, 6, 1, 6. In the slot again and Harshal drills a lofted drive over Bravo's head. Big hit again."
Bravo concedes 52 off four overs! That was the worst last over from Bravo I've seen ever. Ends with a full toss on off and Harshal smashes the ball straight back for six. Hits the sightscreen.
"good length outside off, and punched off the back foot to cover point"
"late inswing! But well defended by Watson. Full on middle, and angling back into his pads"
"full on middle, and shaping into his pads again. Driven to mid off on this occasion. Three dots to start off"
"full on middle, and this has been picked off his toes towards the leg side. Played to midwicket, but yet another dot"
"short on middle, and Watson manages to swivel and pull. Mistimes the shot to deep midwicket, and CSK are off the mark"

"full on off, and going straight into Watson's pads. Defended back to the bowler off the back foot"
"flighted outside off, and driven with the turn past cover. Iyer gives it a chase, and manages to pull it back. Abhishek Sharma cleans up"
"flighted outside off, and it's the wrong'un this time! Turns sharply into Watson, who backs away and cuts to point"
"full just outside off, and defended towards the off side"
"full outside off, and it's the legspinner. But Watson played for the googly, and the drive takes a leading edge. Goes to mid off"
"full outside off, and turning into Watto again. Defended off the front foot to mid on"
"good length on off, and angling away from the batsman. Rayudu, playing his first ball, tries to defend towards cover, but the ball goes past his outside edge. Nice carry to Pant"
"good length on off, and gets big on Rayudu. He glances it down to third man to get off the mark"
"<b>pulled for a flat six!</b> Good length on middle, and way too comfortable for the big man. Thumps it over deep midwicket, with an excellent swing of the bat"
"yorker on leg! Great comeback ball, but Watson manages to dig it away towards the leg side"
"on leg stump, but shaping down the leg side. Hits his pad though, and the ball drops near his toes. They scamper across for a run"
"back of a length on leg stump, and Rayudu walks across to the off side. Whips it off his pads to square leg"
"overpitched outside off, and Rayudu mistimes the straight drive. Plays it back to the bowler on this occasion"
"full on middle again, and almost a yorker this time. Dug away towards mid on, but no single on offer"
"full on off, and tries to slog towards the leg side. Slices it towards deep backward square though"
"length ball on off, and angling into Watson. He drops his hands, and defends it towards the leg side. Rayudu wants the quick single, and he manages to complete it easily. Watson looked kinda surprised by the pace!"
"<b>crunched through cover!</b> Full, but just a bit too much outside the off side. Rayudu goes deep into his crease, and smashes it over extra cover. Great shot"
"back of a length, but very wide outside off. Rayudu did shuffle across to the off side, but failed to connect with the cut. Through to Pant"
"good length on off, and Watson rocks back to fend it off the back foot"
"full on off, and driven down the ground past the non-striker to mid on. No chance of a single"
"slower ball, outside off, and Watson checks his slog. Muscles it over midwicket, and the ball falls in no man's land"
"short outside off, and that's a wild shot from Rayudu. Tries to slap it over point, but absolutely no timing behind that. Through his shot way too early"
"short on off, and Rayudu pirouettes on his toes to pull it to deep backward square"
"full on middle but angling into his pads. Watson misses the shot towards midwicket, and it raps him on his pads. Appeal for lbw turned down. Good decision, the bowler's natural angle would've taken it down the leg side"
"full on off, and that's been thumped over cow corner! Once again Rayudu goes well to deep inside the crease, gets his front leg out of the way, and then powers it into the midwicket boundary"
"quick! Rayudu's too slow to play the pull. Short on off and angling into Rayudu. He tried to repeat that shot, but it's come off the bat's top half and over the bowler's head"
<b>four or six is the question!</b> Drops just short of the boundary. Length ball on off and Rayudu swivels to slog it over the cow-corner region once again. <b>Ten off three</b>
"good length on off, and Rayudu backs away before driving it through the cover region. A packed field inside the circle though"
"good length on middle, but Rayudu comes shimmying down the wicket. Swings his bat towards the leg side, and manages to get some connection behind it. Mistimed, but enough power for it to over the midwicket boundary"
"<B>Twenty-two runs off the over!</b> What a way to end the Powerplay. Length ball on off, and Rayudu backs away to power it over wide long on this time. Swings away, and connects with it well enough for it to soar over the boundary rope. Big, big over. End of the Powerplay too, and they've taken the time-out as well"
"full on middle, and he tries to slog it towards the leg side. The legspin takes the leading edge, and it goes to cover"
"full on middle, and Watson drives it to the cover region"
"flighted on middle, and Rayudu drives it straight back to Mishra. Meets the ball before it could even turn"
"back of a length outside off, and he stands tall to punch it past the bowler's left. Mid off's there"
"flighted on off, and turning away from Watson. He tries to lift it over Mishra, and this time it doesn't have the power to go over long off. Straight down Boult's throat in the deep"
"<b>dropped first ball!</b> Pant the guilty man. Good length outside off, and sliding further away from Raina. He tried to poke at it, but the ball found the outside edge. Oh dear"
"good length outside off, and punched off the back foot past the non-striker to long on"
"full on off stump, from around the wicket. Defended off the front foot by Raina."

"full on off, and defended back to the bowler off the front foot"
"full just outside off, and it's the one that's spinning away. Rayudu's quick to pick that, and drives it beautifully after getting to the pitch of the ball. Long off can't cut it off either"
"flighted on middle, but Rayudu comes down the wicket, converts it into a full toss, and then thumps it over Mishra's head. Oh, delighful."
"full on off, and it's flatter this time. Driven to mid off, and they're taking the quick run. Rayudu would've been gone, except the fielder can't get the direct hit."
an excellent yorker but the line is errant. It's slightly leg side-ish and Rayudu flicks the ball easily through backward square leg for four. Just had to place the ball there.
"better line, more on middle and leg, worked to deep square leg for one."
"a slower ball down leg, worked to deep midwicket. Taking pace off the ball is a good option here."
"full and straight, pushed to long-on. <strong>Another fifty for Rayudu, off 28 balls</strong>. Sparkling form."
"a short delivery down leg, helped down to fine leg for one. Another slower ball, 112 kph."
"good catch by Maxwell! He's hit that well, but he's met the ball too early. Rayudu came charging at the bowler but it was an offcutter. So Rayudu was through the shot a fraction of a second earlier than he would have liked. Therefore, the ball met the bat with its bat face already pointing up. That means the ball will always go higher up than further back. Hangs in the air for a long time. Maxwell takes a good reverse-cupped catch."
"a full delivery outside off, drilled to deep cover for a run"
"naughty. A googly outside off, punched away to the bowler's left. He dives over the ball in his follow-through"
"comes down and chips the ball towards long-on, in typical Dhoni fashion"
"flat and wide outside off, chopped to extra cover for a tight run"
"lots of flight outside off, driven with the spin to long-off"
"another googly, on middle and leg. You can read that based on where it pitched. Nudged to square leg."
"that's the Raina trademark. A flat delivery outside off from Maxwell, Raina lofts the ball over cover so easily. I remember him playing a similar shot in the second IPL, with Matthew Hayden at the non-striker's end. Now, Hayden on air <b>says 'there is no better player of that shot'</b>"
"flat outside off, punched to long-off from the back foot"
"short and wide from Maxwell, and even though the ball is turning back in, Dhoni creates room by generating some power through the line of the ball and scything the ball through backward point."
"an offbreak on leg, worked to deep midwicket for a run"
"flat outside off, pushed to cover. 95 kph."
"flat and wide outside off, carved to point."
"the flat delivery outside off, pulled to deep midwicket for a single."
"95 kph, flat and quick on middle and leg, pulled to deep midwicket"
"quick and flat outside off, punched to cover from the crease"
"a legbreak outside off, tapped to point for a run. And <strong>Dhoni has 6000 T20 runs</strong>"
"the googly outside off, Raina closes the bat face and gets a leading edge towards extra cover for a run"
a very full delivery and Dhoni just pushes it back.
"he's picked out deep midwicket. And Lamichhane is pumped! That was a googly that Raina picked as soon as it was released because of the line - it was down leg. So Raina cleared his front leg and looked to smash that over midwicket, but he did not get underneath it well enough. All he did was pick out the fielder."
"too full, on-driven to long-on"
"runs down the pitch, meets the ball as it pitches and skews a lofted drive to long-on"
"just misses leg stump! The googly down leg, Billings looks for the reverse-swat (he plays that as well very well). But bottom-edged and just misses leg stump"
"shortish and wide, the googly. Cut to point"
"<strong>just short of cover!</strong> That's the shot I was referring to, dancing down and trying to work the ball to midwicket. But the ball spins away, takes the leading edge and lobs towards cover."
"spin for Mishy. Flat on off and middle, the ball spins and beats the bat."
"a very quick delivery on off, maybe the low full toss, smashed to long-on"
"top-edged sweep, down to short fine leg. It's always risky sweeping a wristspinner for this very reason. The googly ALWAYS produces extra bounce because there are more revolutions on the ball. So you'd rather go from bottom to top while sweeping. But Billings tries to keep this down, takes a thick leading edge straight to the fielder. Also, he had to drag the shot from well outside off."
"tossed up outside off, worked to long-on with the spin."
"quick and straight, pushed back to the bowler"
"another dart, quick down leg. Dhoni misses a sweep. Struck on the pad."
"gets to the pitch and Jadeja goes boom! A googly outside off, Jadeja runs down, gets there and launches a massive six over the bowler's head. 89 metres back."
"that's sloppy. Short and wide outside off, carved away to deep cover for a couple. A misfield from Harshal allows two."
"flat and straight, driven to long-on for a run."
"flat on off, worked to long-on. Dhoni knows what he's doing. Letting Jadeja take the risks now, he'll stay there till over No. 20 and take full responsibility then"
"short around off, pulled to deep midwicket"
"the legbreak outside off, pushed to cover. Excellent spell from the young leggie: 4-0-21-1."
"well bowled, the right length. Quick outside off, not full, not short. Jadeja misses a cut."
"a good length delivery on off and middle, worked to deep square leg for a run."
"another dot! A short slower ball outside off, Dhoni misses an attempted dab to third man."
"short on middle and leg, pulled away down to short fine leg. Another dot."
"and again. Another short and wide slower ball, chopped away down to gully for one."
"Avesh does not go for the catch. The bowler says go for it. Full and wide outside off, Jadeja looks to go over cover but the ball skews off the outside half, to the sweeper cover fielder. On the bounce!"
"creamed that, but he finds deep midwicket. Back of a length on off, pulled away with fierce power."
"it's wide, but on a length. Dhoni's eyes light up and he swings, but toe-ends it back to the keeper. DOT."
awesome bowling. He has a clear plan (the easy part) and then he executes to Dhoni with deadly accuracy (soooo hard).
"and now the short ball, around middle and leg. Pulled away to midwicket. Boult goes for the catch but falls over. Long-on throws wildly to the keeper and somehow Mishra gets around to his left to prevent four overthrows. CSK get three"
"a full delivery on middle and leg, swung away to deep square leg for a run."
"that's the game! A stunning over this from Boult. Not just because he has conceded just five and taken out MS Dhoni, but his execution has been awesome. A low full toss from Boult, on middle and off. Dhoni broings out his bottom hand and whips the ball flat. But not enough distance. Iyer runs in and takes a good catch."
"just clears the boundary. Full on middle and off, Jadeja lofts the ball elegantly. Very high but just enough and clears the straight boundary."
"a short slower ball down leg, worked to short fine leg, who falls over the ball, concedes an additional run."
"a short and wide delivery outside off, cut to deep point for a run. That's the better option in these conditions, <strong>can't concede sixes to that</strong>."
"a shortish delivery outside off, swings too early again, to deep square leg."
"a shortish and wide delivery outside off. And again, Jadeja plays over the line, another dot."
"length on middle and leg, 134 kph, off the pad to third man. Sensational night for Harshal Patel: 4-0-23-1 and a terrific cameo."
"a low full toss down leg, worked to deep square leg for a run."
"a full delivery outside off, Bravo backs away and chips a lofted drive towards cover. Shankar backtracks and takes it comfortably."
"short and wide, under-edged to the keeper for a run."
"full down leg, Chahar walks right across and misses a swing. Good non-call, not a wide."
"a slower ball on off, inside-edged to square leg"
"142 kph, full and straight, skewed away to long-on. And <strong>Daredevils take away a 34-run win</strong>."
