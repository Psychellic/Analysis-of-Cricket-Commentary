"good length and angled in on middle, Amla hangs back and works it in the gap between mid-on and short midwicket"
short and darts back into Marsh to hit him on the thigh pad
"short, wide, 140ks, Marsh laps it up. He frees his arms and nails a square cut. The ball rolls away to the boundary"
"short of a length and swings back in, cramps the left-hander for room now. Good comeback from Hardik, after being thumped to the boundary, played back to the bowler"
"the Pandya brothers in action in the first over. Hardik bowls it pretty full outside off. Angled across off. Marsh drives it towards cover-point, where Krunal makes a tumbling save to his left"
"back of a length and angled into Amla, he stands tall and picks it off between mid-on and midwicket again"
"pitched up and outside off, drive-able length, forward and stroked to mid-on"
"Mitchell McClenaghan goes up for a caught-behind appeal down the leg side. Amla ventures across off stump. This is on a back of a length and on a fourth-stump line down leg, Amla misses the flick. The ball may have flicked the trouser on its way to the keeper. Umpire Shamshuddin does not budge"
"overpitched on the stumps, firmly driven back to the bowler. The ball hits the bowlers's shin and rolls towards midwicket. Amla is interested in a single, Marsh isn't. So there is a mix-up near the middle of the pitch. Mitch fumbles, though, and Amla has enough time to undo his steps"
"Nitish Raina at backward point dives to his left and finger-tips the ball away. <b>He drops a tough chance</b>. Good length and width outside off, Amla throws his bat at the ball and slices it in the air. He gets away, carving between backward point and square-ish point"

"wide of the crease, angled in, clips the thigh pad, Parthiv throws himself to his left behind the stumps to stop the ball"
"short of a length and outside off, the ball comes nicely onto the bat, Marsh stylishly upper-cuts it over backward point. The ball flies to the boundary"
"Hardik has a backward point, square point, and cover-point in place, but Marsh threads the gap beautifully. Short of a length, attached with width outside off, flayed away square in that little gap"
Marsh waits for this back of a length ball to come to him and then guides a single to the right of backward point
"short and outside off, Amla attempts a cut, plays a long way away from the body, and slashes an outside edge that does not carry to Harbhajan at first slip"
"lobbed up full and outside off. Marsh moves forward, meets the pitch, and drives to cover"
"97ks, quicker flatter one, angled in, skewed to point"

"turning offbreak on off, worked with the turn through midwicket"
"short of a length and outside off, slapped away again but straight to the man at extra cover"
"back of a length, bounces at Amla, hits the splice and rolls to cover"
"shot! Back of a length, hip-high ball on the off stump, this is almost like <i>that</i> Kohli shot. Amla stands tall and short-arm jabs it over the wide long-on boundary. Stunning strike"
"Malinga replies with a yorker, squeezed out to mid-on"
"on a good length and outside off, driven on the up to extra cover"
"not a drive-able length, hint of width, yet Marsh attempts to drive and squirts it to extra cover"
don't bowl short and wide to Marsh. Malinga gets away. Slapped away to point

"half-volley on the pads, whipped straight to midwicket"
"hip-high short ball outside off, Marsh has been bred on the WACA surfaces, you've got to aim for the head. He swivels on the back foot and pulls to the midwicket fence"
"Marsh has given it away! Harmless full ball on middle, Marsh attempts to flick it over short midwicket. He only manages to chip it off the bottom of the bat to Pollard. Marsh just could not get under the ball there"

"very full and wide outside off, Krunal asks Saha to reach out for the ball. Slices it away to sweeper"
"Kings XI finally get a move on. Amla finally gets a move on. Amla runs down the track, does not meet the pitch, but still lofts it straight of long-on"

"Saha is trying to force the pace. He uses his feet, but does not meet the pitch, the ball turns away. Slices an outside edge to where extra cover may have been"
clipped off the pads through midwicket
leg-side wide
"Saha never really looked comfortable. He uses his feet and misses a straight ball. Kings XI's No. 3 hoodoo continues. The ball dips, Saha swings across the line, Krunal hits the leg stump"

"full and outside off, drilled past the bowler"

"Maxwell skips out, is beaten in flight, but adjusts and pushes a single to long-off. Another good outing for Krunal: 4-0-29-1"
"Maxwell steps away outside the leg stump. Bumrah sends down a head-high bouncer, angled into Maxwell. The batsman looks away, and half-sways, but can't get away from the line. He gets into an awkward tangle as he top-edges the ball onto his chest. The ball rolls to leg"
"short, cramps Maxwell for room, squirted to midwicket"
picked off through square leg
"bouncer outside off, rushes Maxwell into a hook. Top-edged over the keeper's head"
"bam! Short of a length and outside off, Maxwell anticipates the length. He backs away outside leg, takes it from middle stump and slices it deliberately over backward point. Oh boy, those wrists!"
"this is much fuller on the stumps, Maxwell backs away outside leg and flat-bats it past the bowler"
"shot. Pitched up on off from over the wicket, right in the slot. Maxwell gets forward, gets under it, and launches it over the long-on boundary. Sends the ball into the second tier"
"length ball, angling away outside off, Maxwell, having stepped away outside leg, adjusts and <b>golf-swings it</b> straight now, over the bowler's head"
"slower short ball outside off, sits up, Maxwell reads it and disdainfully swats it away to the midwicket boundary"

"<strong>make it five in five.</strong> Maxwell is on fire in Indore. Low full-toss on the middle stump, Maxwell shuffles across off and whips it flat over the square leg umpire"
"chest-high short ball on the middle stump, swatted away to the right of deep midwicket"
"Amla moves across off, this is pushed wider of him, he looks to dab it down to third man. No dice. Beaten on the outside edge. <strong>Twenty-eight runs off it, this is the second-most expensive over of the season</strong>"
"really full on off, Maxwell shovels it away to deep midwicket"
"122ks slower full ball outside off, Amla spots it. He waits for the ball to arrive, the lofts it through the line. Puts Malinga over the long-off boundary. <strong>Huuuuge, and Amla hits the roof</strong>"
"more round-arm than usual from Malinga, very full and wide outside off, past the guideline. Wide called"
"very full and wide outside off, asks Amla to reach out. He does so. Uses his wrists and dispatches the ball over point. What clean hitting from these two batsmen"
"Malinga aims for the yorker, ends up overpitching it on middle, Amla punches it in the air to the right of the bowler"
"big dipper. Slower full-toss, Amla is already through with his leg-side slog. The ball <strong>nearly shaved off stump</strong>"
"Malinga errs in length again. Hip-high full-toss, which is whipped away square of fine leg. <b>Fifty off the last two overs</b>"
"full and fast at 142ks, Maxwell shuffles across off and misses the scoop. Hit on the pad, but impact outside off"
"slower short ball outside off, carved away to sweeper"
"Bumrah trumps Maxwell with the slower ball. 112ks offcutter, grips in the surface, Maxwell is already through with his leg-side slog. The ball dips, grazes the back thigh and disturbs the bails. End of a thrill-a-minute 83-run stand"
"back of a length and outside off, front-foot push to extra cover"
"another slower offcutter, 104ks, nurdled to midwicket"
"off-stump ball, glided to short third man"
"full and skids on, takes the pad and rolls to point"
"length ball on middle, Stoinis aims to hit it out of the park. He gets more height as opposed to distance. Holes out to Pollard at long-on. The big man takes the skier"
"short ball, bounces over the stumps, as Amla swings to leg and misses"
"Amla shuffles a long way across off, the bowler chases him. Amla can't connect with the scoop"
"short and angled across off, 123ks slower ball, Amla slogs early and bottom-edges it behind to the keeper"
"short and wide outside off, Amla reaches out and upper-cuts it with great authority over third man. There's no stopping him tonight"
"short, angled across off, kicks up, zips past Axar"
"shorter on off, dabbed to cover"
"ripping inswinging yorker, finishes on middle, Amla is floored. He manages to dig it out behind square, however. Front-foot no-ball"
"bouncer on middle, Amla hooks and misses"
"finesse from Amla. Full on off stump, Amla, having shuffled across the off stump, laps it away fine of short fine leg"

"attempts a slower cutter and goes down leg, wide"
"nails the yorker on middle, squeezed back to Bumrah"
"short and down leg, past the pull, leg-side wide"
"The 100 is on. This is Amla's fifth six, his most in a T20 innings. Banged short on middle, rushes Amla into a hook. Top-edged over the keeper's head"

"length ball on off, shovelled to deep midwicket"
"slower full ball on leg stump, nudged to deep midwicket"
"middle-stump yorker, dug out to cover for one"
"overpitched on middle and leg, whipped to deep midwicket"
"back of a length, into the pads, Parthiv nudges it towards square leg. That might well be his role, give the big-hitter the strike"
keeps it wide of Buttler's reach - a shortish delivery right atop the wide line - he chops it into the covers off the inside edge
slips down the leg side in his efforts to cramp Parthiv up.
"straying into the pads again, picked off to deep midwidwicket"
"walks at the bowler, having moved across onto off stump as well, drags it towards mid-on. Stoinis prevents a single, moving to his left from short midwicket"
pushes into the covers
"is he off? This is a massive hit over midwicket, and it's been set up by a little skimmy down the wicket and towards off stump. Allows him to take a ball on fifth stump and skewer it into the crowd"
"back of a length and outside off, steers it to deep third man"
"all he does is pick the gap in front of point. Nothing more than a defensive push, with the bat face opening when it makes contact with a back of a length ball outside off. Danger signs"
you know he feels in form when he goes for the scoop so early. Doesn't make a connection though. Gets a single towards midwicket
that's Parthiv's happy place. You can imagine it being full of length balls that are drive-able through cover. Ishant visits it and comes away crying
"shortish on leg stump, Parthiv is a bit hurried (142 kph) as he secures a leg bye towards square leg"
"good change of pace, and an early sign that Kings XI want to keep the ball away from Buttler's swinging arc. Back of a length and humming over the wide line outside off. The batsman pulls and misses"
"shortish and outside off, he runs it behind point"
pierces the field. This is lovely batting. Smokes a near yorker past mid-off's left and he's able to do so by making some room to the leg side
"backs away again, but this time he tries to hit the ball too hard and gets an inside edge to deep midwicket"
"sensational take from Saha, leaping to his right. The length ball on leg stump hitchhikes off Parthiv's pads. Could have easily been a four had it not been for the Kings XI keeper's acrobatics"
clips to the left of midwicket for a quick single. Been only six dots in the innings so far
"flat, hard, and it's maximum! Sandeep's efforts to keep Buttler quiet by hitting the blockhole backfires spectacularly as he delivers a low full toss which is flatbatted over extra cover"
"it flies again! Perfect ball for the pick up shot, on the hips, and Parthiv has made a career off hitting these out of the park over square leg"
whips a full delivery angled across onto off stump to deep square leg
"<b>ooooff</b>, this is hit so hard that Miller's face is almost smashed to bits. He is the substitute fielder for Amla, standing at cover, bring his hands up in front of his nose to try and take the catch. But Buttler's power is so fierce that it bursts through and goes for four"
pushes towards mid-off for a single
"spots fine leg up inside the circle, and places the offcutter on leg stump to his right. Simple placement getting the runs"
"half an appeal for leg before from Ishant, hoping in vain that this good length ball cutting back into Parthiv has hit pad first. No such luck. Inside edge for single to fine leg"
one-bounce over the wicketkeeper's head. Parthiv welcomes Mohit with a cheeky little upper cut. Eyes on the short ball on off stump and he unfurls the ramp just when it is needed
"cracked off the middle again and a length ball singes the tuft, going to mid-off"
"stand and deliver! He is almost deceived by the slower ball, but adjusts, holds the bat in the backlift that little bit longer and by virtue of that he is able to cream it to the left of mid-off"
"length ball on off stump, pushes it into the covers"
mistake from Mohit. Slides a full-pace half-volley down leg stump with fine leg up. All it needs is a roll of the wrists. Some direction. And Buttler does so with ease
"superb shot! It's the slower ball off the back of the hand, Buttler picks it. Makes room so that by the time it pitches as a hafl-volley on middle he is able to smear it through extra cover"
another whopper! Stoinis begins with a short ball from around the wicket and Parthiv simply belts it over deep midwicket
"now through the off side. Kings XI have no answers. Short, angled across the left-hander, Parthiv gets inside the line and carves it through point."
"<b>highest score by Mumbai in the Powerplay in all IPLs</b> and the mark is reached off a slower ball becoming an offside wide, the error brought about by the carnage earlier"
gets under a wide ball outside off and lifts it over the covers. Doesn't time it well because of the lack of pace.
"walks at the bowler, who resorts to the slower bouncer which follows Buttler. Pull to deep square leg"
bunts it to mid-off. The slower ball works. Credit to Stoinis for digging it into the pitch and putting it wide outside off stump against batsmen looking to make room down leg. Parthiv makes his connection off the toe-end. There is no timing and Maxwell takes the catch
nudges it off his pads towards midwicket for a single
leans forward and outside off to flick the ball to long-on
jumps back against a flatter delivery on off stump and flicks it to deep square leg
well bowled. Zips it past the flashing Rana bat outside off stump. Lovely low take from Saha
"looks to nudge it through square leg, but has to settle for a leg bye"
good running. Comes down the track for a tap to long-on and gets across for the second
"nice and slow, and into the leg side as well. Buttler coming down the track is choked for room. Gets hit on the thigh pad"
"into the crowd again, the people over long leg get a chance to show off to the cameras. Pretty good ball this is too - short, fast, coming up to his nose, but Rana swivels on his back foot and pulls it away powerfully"
"fuller delivery outside off, runs it down to deep third man"
sees Buttler jumping outside leg and so bowls a yorker outside off. The batsman has to reach out to make connection and gets a single towards point
great effort from Sandeep on the third man boundary. Saves three runs by running quickly to his right and putting in the desperate dive. Deft little dab from Rana only for one
"over cover! This is slow, but it allows Buttler to get underneath the ball and power it away to the left of long-off"
"full and outside off, Buttler looks to thread it through cover again but gets an inside edge past leg stump"
"flatter delivery outside off, pushed to the right of long-on for his <b>half-century</b>. Strike-rate over 208.3"
"quicker, flatter delivery on the pads. Nudges it towards midwicket"
"in the slot for the slog sweep and Rana belts it away. Gets down low, sets his base, and generates such good bat speed. Sails over midwicket"
"pushes it through, but in trying to do so, in trying to prevent giving room, he slips down leg"
taps it to the left of the bowler and pinches a single
check the miles on that! Too short from Axar and Buttler rocks back and heaves it over deep square leg. What clean hitting. The ball's lost again
"good length ball on leg stump, works it away through midwicket"
"tosses it up on middle, turns it to long-on"
"looks for the slog sweep again, but this is a touch too full and quick. Inside edge to deep midwicket"
"good work Swapnil. He sees Buttler coming down the track, and making room. He still tosses it up, but wide outside off to foil the timing. Only a single to deep cover"
"flatter delivery on off stump, cracks it to the sweeper"
"fires it into leg stump, Buttler nudges it to the right of long-on"
"full on middle, Rana turns it to deep square leg for a single. That's nine dots now in 10 overs. <b>This is also the highest score for Mumbai at the end of 10 overs</b>"
mid-off is up and Ishant bowls the overpitched ball outside off. All Rana needs to do is hit through the line and trust in his power
"shortish and outside off, dabs it behind third man"
"full and outside off, squeezes it out to the sweeper to bring up the <b>fifty partnership off 29 balls</b>"
"gets behind the short ball on leg stump, blocks it into where short leg might have been and pinches a single"
"full and outside off, he tries to carve it through the covers but gets an inside edge"
"<b>almost a catch</b> to long leg! This is a dreadful ball. Slow, short and way down leg. Rana swivels on the back foot with a pull and connects so well that it nearly carries to Sandeep rushing in from the boundary"
"Kings XI can't stop it. They keep trying to cramp batsmen up. They keep bowling flat on leg and Rana, the sweep is a strong option for him, and he uses it again. Massive six over midwicket"
short and wide outside off - awful bowling - and Rana just forehand smashes it over long-on. The required rate is almost a run-a-ball now
"good length ball outside off, blocks it towards point for a single"
"pushes it through on middle, Buttler keeps back and pats it down to long-on"
"full and wide outside off, Rana looks for the loft over extra cover but he gets an inside edge back to the bowler"
"beautiful batting. He knows Swapnil is going to bowl quick. He knows it will be flat. So he hangs back, lets it come on, and plays a delicious late cut. The short third man fielder has work to do, moving to his left. Fumbles to give up a couple"
"looks to skirt the off-side wide line, but he does so on the wrong side. That makes the equation 48 off 48 balls in a chase of 199. This has been a mauling"
reaches out to a full ball outside off and slaps it to deep point. Would have been a wide had he left it
"good length ball on middle, Rana blocks into the off side and looks up, Buttler is already running. Easily taken quick single"
what a hit! That wouldn't have risen over 15 feet. It's a half-volley outside off. Buttler flays it over extra cover. Bottom-handed beastly hitting
"into the stands again! <b>That's his highest T20 score</b>. Short ball outside off, shovels over deep midwicket. Strike-rate still over 200."
"full and outside off, drums it to long-off"
"good length ball on middle, Rana, surprisingly, can only keep it out"
"this is high, who's getting under it? It's the captain. Mohit starts a new spell with a slower ball, Buttler loses his shape in trying to hit it as hard as he could. Ends up skewing it high and Maxwell, at mid-off, takes a good catch. Super innings. Broke the chase all on his own."
"shortish, slower ball on leg stump, Rana tries to dink it around the corner to fine leg. No connection"
"goes for the slower, short ball on leg stump, Rana calmly gets under it"
"offcutter on middle, Rana defends to point. An excitable Hardik is looking for a single, but is made to go back"
"almost seems like he has mis-hit the slower ball, but it still gets past point. Sucked into playing the length - which is full and tempting. Drives away from the body and the offcutter arrives a little later than he expects"
"shortish and outside off, steers it to deep third man"
"picks the slower ball this time, waits on his punch to long-off, and delivers it perfectly"
"that's unlucky. This is a back of a length ball outside off. Rana goes for the swipe and top edges it over third man.
 <b>Four innings at No. 3 and four fifties as well</b>. He's still to hit a four in this innings, but has six sixes"
"full on off stump, drills it down to long-off"
"yorker on off stump, jams his bat down on it for a single into the covers"
"into the second tier over long-on! He's got really strong forearms and they are on show as he somehow gets on top of the bounce of a slower short ball - he's on the front foot, so that makes it all the more remarkable - and hits it straight down the ground"
"mid-off is up and the mis-hit has enough power to lob over him and into the boundary. Low full toss, given the treatment"
"another that races away. Looks for the yorker, but doesn't quite find it. Pandya is able to drill the ball down the ground and the long-on fielder can't get to his left in time"
"good length ball on off stump, pats it towards point"
"picks the slower ball and pastes it to the right of long-off. Good, hard running gets them two"
"game over! This is a slow, short ball, down leg, and Rana pulls it mightily over the long leg boundary"
