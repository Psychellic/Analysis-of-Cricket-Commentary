"full and on the pads, tucked off the pads to deep backward square leg"
stays in this crease to this length ball and steers it to third man with an open bat face
"fuller ball, angling in on the stumps, closes the bat face a tad early and so does not time it too well as the ball is drilled to midwicket"
"fuller outside off, around the fifth-stump channel, drilled off the front foot towards mid-off"
"short of a length, pitching on leg stump channel, does not sit up as much but Kamran manages to pull it away to deep backward square leg"
"short ball, well-directed bouncer on the stumps, Tamim sits under it and lets it go"
"length ball, on the stumps, stays in the crease and flat-bats it towards mid-on"
"good length outside off, not much feet from Kamran who stays in the crease and flays it towards point"
"angling in on leg, pushes it wide of mid-on and takes off for a quick single"
tries to come forward and push this into the off side but ends up chopping it hard into the ground and the ball goes towards the third man region after bouncing
"length ball, tries to pull it but the length isn't quite short and he can only drag it towards mid-on with a flat bat"
"fullish and on the leg stump channel, tries to go big down the ground but does not time it too well and the ball goes towards the midwicket region as they run the single"
makes up his mind early and stays leg side of the ball as Irfan fires it full and on middle and angling away after pitching. Kamran keeps the front leg inside the line of the ball that allows him room to free his arms and pummel it down the ground
SHadab makes a brilliant effort at backward point and almost pulls off a stunner. It's a full toss and Kamran flays it but does not keep it along the ground. Shadab leaps to his left and gets his hands to it but the ball ricochets and goes to third man. Brilliant effort though
tries to heave it over the leg side and gets an inside edge to mid-on
walks across the stumps and pulls but perhaps cramped himself for room as he did it. The ball is short enough but he has does not give himself enough room to free his arms and the ball goes to the on side
"pull shot, gets a top edge and the ball sails over the wicketkeeper's head and goes on the bounce over the third man boundary"
"short ball again, this time he is rushed for pace and he gets hit hard on the helmet as he misses the pull shot and goes along the ground towards mid-off. That was a nasty blow, must have surely shook him up a bit. Brad Haddin runs forward and checks on the batsman as they change ends"
"fires a tempter outside off, in the corridor of uncertainty, draws the batsman forward and Tamim gets beaten as he sticks his bat out"
"Tamim has picked out Misbah at mid-on. Does not get the elevation desired as he tries to heave it away. It's a length ball, angling in on middle and leg, not quite in the slot. Tamim cannot get the ball over the man at mid-on. Goes straight into the hands of the Islamabad captain who plucks it easily though it is hit very hard"
"fullish on the stumps, blocked off the front foot down the ground"
"length ball, angling away outside off, stays in the crease and gets the front leg up as he whips it away into the on side"
"glorious cover drive. That's a tremendous shot to get off the mark. Full and angling away, wide half-volley, right in the slot for Hafeez, who presses forward, leans across and crunches a drive through the covers region. Elegance written all over it"
takes off for a single after bunting this one to mid-on but is sent back by the non-striker. Hafeez is almost halfway down the pitch and he has to scamper back. Throw misses the target at the striker's end but direct hit could have had him in trouble
"short ball, dealt with well by Kamran as he swivels around and pulls it to deep square leg and the ball goes on the bounce to the fielder guarding the boundary there"
"good length ball, angling away from Haeez. The batsman comes forward and sticks his bat out but does not do so with conviction. The angle takes the ball away from him and it takes the outside edge, beats the diving slip fielder as well as the fielder who slides before the third man boundary"
"short of a length and angling away, jumps up to negotiate the bounce before stabbing it into the off side"
"back of a length ball on the stumps, jumps back into the crease and uses the depth before turning it away into the vacant midwicket region. There are two fielders converging on the ball but they have enough time to come back for the second"
"oh, dear, isn't that a soft dismissal! Slower ball does the trick and Hafeez's lean patch continues. Goes at it with hard hands and chips it straight into the hands of mid-on where Misbah takes a straightforward catch"
brilliantly bowled yorker on leg stump and all Morgan can do is jam the bat down and squeeze it out back towards the bowler
"fuller ball on the stumps, clipped off the toes towards fine leg"
"good length ball, Morgan comes forward and blocks into the off side, towards the covers region"
comes down the track early and lofts this over mid-off. Meets the pitch of the ball and gets right on top of that before carving it well over the outstretched hands of the leaping fielder at mid-off and the ball crosses the boundary on the bounce
"good length ball, Morgan covers the line and defends towards short cover"
"change in pace again, slower length ball, angling in, tucked off the pads behind square on the leg side"
"short of a length ball, swivels around and pulls it away fine though it keeps low, no chance for the short fine leg fielder to get that"
starts off with a very full ball on leg stump and Morgan digs it out
drags the length back and it's too easy for Morgan who gets in position early and shovels it off the backfoot. Pulls off the backfoot and it's a flat six as the ball goes over cow corner
makes amends and fires this full and on the stumps and Morgan presses forward and defends it back to the bowler
gets down to slog sweep this one but the bowler adjusts well by not giving the batsman any room. Morgan wears it on the pad and the ball goes fine after pitching on leg stump
beautifully bowled. It's short and wide outside off and Kamran was shaping for the cut shot. But it's the googly and spins back in to cramp him for room and the batsman cannot make good contact
six off the second ball of the over and the bowler ends it by having the last laugh. Another googly does Kamran in. Short and Kamran goes for the cut again but this one spins in and keeps a bit low as well and strikes him n the back pad. And that was crashing into middle. Looked plumb from the moment it made contact with the pad
"full and wide, driven square of the wicket"
"short ball, comes on quickly but there is enough bounce on it for the batsman to comfortably get under it"
nicely done. Length ball in the corridor of uncertainty. Draws the batsman forward and Maqsood almost walks into the shot as he looks to push off the front foot into the off side. Gets beaten for his troubles
"this was bound to happen, you could see it happening. Peshawar trying to force the pace and lose a wicket. Slightly short of a length ball, cuts back in slightly so it cramps the batsman for room as he looks to pull it. Gets a top edge that hardly carries and Sami runs back on the follow through and settles under it"
"short of a length, angling away outside off, waits for it at the crease and stabs it to point off the backfoot"
nearly another caught and bowled. This time it's Morgan who fails to make good contact on the pull shot and the ball lobs in the air to the right of Sami who charges across and dives but the ball lands in front of him
turned away into the leg side off the backfoot
"that's a desperate shot, not convincing but he gets good reward for it. Gets down for a reverse sweep and gets a top edge and the ball clears short third man and goes into the boundary"
floats it up this time and Morgan comes forward and taps it into the off side for a single
tucked off the backfoot behind square
"length ball, spinning into the left-hander after landing on leg stump channel and going down leg"
"pushed into the covers region off the front foot and they take a sharp, quick single"
floats it up nicely but needed to get that straighter. Good turn but poor line. On leg stump and turning in to go down leg and beat the wicketkeeper
"too short, Shakib rocks back and pulls it deep square leg"
"short of a length, tries to pull it away but the ball does not get up as well and he can only nudge it off the bottom part of the bat to the leg side. Or did that go off the glove?"
"short ball, this one sits up nicely for Morgan who swivels around with the pull and the ball goes to deep square leg. The man at deep midwicket run to his left and cuts it off in front of the boundary"
"short of a length ball, angling away, flashes his blade as he looks to cut but it is a tad too close for that shot and the ball shoots past the edge and goes to the wicketkeeper"
"short ball, jumps up to deal with the bounce and controls the pull to deep square leg by rolling his wrists over the shot"
similar to the earlier one that beat the edge. Too close to cut though it is short and Morgan cannot make contact as he opens the bat face
"fullish length ball, angling away around off, opens the bat face and runs it down to third man as they jog the single"
"full and wide outside off, gets Morgan to reach out as he takes a long stride across and crunches it out to sweeper cover"
"length ball, and it was always going to be hard to loft straight down the ground from that length. Shakib presents the full face of his bat and sends it soaring into the night sky but does not get the desired distance as Sami backtracks from mid-off and snaffles it"
"fullish on the stumps, turns it away to midwicket"
"yorker, dug out straight down the ground"
"fuller length ball on the stumps, Moran blocks towards mid-off off the front foot"
"sprays it down the leg side, Morgan tries to glance it fine but does not make contact"
"length ball, angling away, Morgan defends off the front foot and that's the end of a superb over from Butt. Pretty accurate lines and lengths and ends up giving away just two"
"nicely tossed up outside off, Sammy leans forward and crisply drives towards extra cover"
"tossed up and fullish on off, Morgan strides forward and eases it down to long-off"
"spins back in sharply, it's the wrong'un. well-disguised and Sammy does not read it as he tries to force it through the off side off the backfoot. Gets an inside edge that could have gone on to the stumps"
"fuller on the stumps, pushed back to the bowler"
"comes forward to defend but goes hard at it and is in not in any kind of a good position as the feet are stuck in the crease. another googly, misses the outside edge by a very small margin"
""
"full ball outside off, crunches it hard out to sweeper cover"
"slightly short of a length ball, Morgan pulls it hard and the ball screams past the diving fielder into the deep midwicket boundary"
opens the bat face and works this square of the wicket through the off side
"full toss, over the waistline, or so it seemed. But seems like it has hit him on the thigh as he misses the ball as he tries to pull it away fine"
"length ball, tries to wait in the crease and pull but can only drag it towards long-on"
""
"floated up on the stumps, comes forward and blocks"
"fuller ball, slides down leg and Sammy gets down to sweep this to deep backward square leg"
"reverse sweep, straight into the hands of Mohammad Irfan at short third man. Can't help but wonder if that fielder was in place precisely for that reason. Credit to the young legspinner, too, for being unafraid to toss it up and fire it full"
comes forward and muscles a drive to covers
wrong'un again. Afridi does not find the middle of the bat as he tries to cut this short ball and chops it
""
"that's a full toss that dips late outside off, ends up almost being a yorker and Sammy misses it altogether as he fails to put bat to ball"
"short of a length ball, 127.3kph, slapped away to deep point. The throw is flat from the deep and Haddin flicks the ball back towards the stumps but the batsman is back"
how hard did he hit that! That was hammered. In the slot is this half-volley outside off and Sammy reaches out for the heavens with his backlift before shovelling it to the right of mid-off
"short ball, ducks under"
"short of a length and some width on offer outside off, not much pace, just over 122 clicks and Sammy finds backward point as he slaps it late"
Irfan's spell ends with a boundary. Not much wrong with that delivery. It is full and on the pads and should have just been clipped away off the toes. But such is the power of Sammy. Lofts it clean over mid-off and sends the ball screaming into the boundary. That's just sheer power. No other way to describe it
opens the bat face and steers it down to third man
"length ball, room outside off, fetches it from outside off and slams it with an angled bat as the ball goes wide of mid-on and into the boundary"
"that was the toe-crusher, was it? Too full and forces Sammy to jam the bat down hard and gets the legs out of the way as the ball sneaks from between them into the leg side. And even as tries to recover, Afridi pushes him for a quick single"
""
flicked off the pads and the ball sails into the deep backward square leg boundary. Moves across the crease to open up the leg side and just lofts it clean. Misbah's expression is gold as he has his hands covering his mouth
and he pummels another one. Seems like Misbah is due for more anxious moments. More headache. Moves across to give himself some space again and whacks it over deep midwicket and it has gone way into the stands. Misbah's standing there biting his nails
"goes for the yorker and not quite where he would have liked but a decent delivery to end the over, Afridi drills it extremely hard down the ground, to long-on"
"short ball, pulls it on the bounce to the square leg fielder and they take off for a quick single"
that's a tremendous catch at long-on. Slower short ball and Sammy is looking to pull this away. But he can only drag it down to long-on. Sami is slightly deep and runs forward before putting in a superbly-timed dive and snaffles it inches from the ground
moves across to the stump to this fuller ball before dabbing it away to midwicket
backs away to this short of a length ball and slaps it straight to the fielder at cover
"fuller ball, works it down to long-on"
""
"what kind of a shot is that! Length ball, Watson bowls the legcutter and Wahab picks up the drop in pace and waits for it before flat-batting it over long-off. Slapped extremely hard"
"oh, that's a lovely shot. Watson tries to compensate and bowl a wide yorker and Wahab backs away before squeezing it out as the ball goes to the square third man boundary"
"short ball, tries to pull and gets a top edge and the ball flies over the leaping Brad Haddin behind the stumps. So we have had short ball, four, full ball, four, short ball, four. What does Watson have to do here?"
"oh, good lord! He got everything right about that ball. Wahab was backing away and Watson follows him with a yorker on leg stump channel. Wahab is only looking to dig it out and he gets the ball from between his legs off the inside edge and the ball goes to the fine leg boundary"
"that's what he was looking to do the previous ball. Yorker on leg stump and it is dug out between long-on and deep midwicket. Picked the gap well, so they get two"
"Watson ends the over well with another yorker, dug out towards the midwicket region, this time the placement isn't quite there, so they get just one. Still, 21 off that over"
backs away bu the bowler fires a yorker after following him and it is dug out back to the bowler
"tucks him up on the rib cage area with a short of a length ball and Wahab fends it off awkwardly, wears it on the ribs"
"gets down low to slog sweep it but the bowler drops his pace, deceives him with a slower ball and Wahab is through with the shot early, can't make contact"
"stays leg side of the ball but the bowler has done superbly here, bowls a yorker on the stumps that can only be dug out back to the bowler. After the carnage in the previous over, we have four dots here"
backs away to pull but there is not enough room and it comes on at an awkward height. Gets a top edge that lands in front of the bowler running back
"yorker on off, squeezed out through the off side for a single. What a superb over"
"It's a fuller ball outside off and Afridi was looking to clear mid-off. Gets it off the toe end of the bat and skews it to long-off, where Raees, coming off a brilliant over, takes it"
"yorker on the stumps, dug out straight back to the bowler"
takes out the leg stump with a superb yorker. Wahab was backing away looking to make room and misses the ball
goes for the yorker again but ends up bowling a full toss that is pushed back to the bowler

"full and outside off, flashes a drive and sends an outside edge to third man"

"Hasan punches his fist in annoyance. Full in the channel, hunts for the outside edge with awayswing. Smith fishes away from the body and gets away"
"back of a length and on off, punchily played back to the bowler"
"fractionally short on off, Rafatullah swings his hands at a pull. Ends up dragging the ball to midwicket"
"chest-high short ball on middle and leg, Junaid beats Rafatullah for pace and bounce. He top-edges a hook, off the front foot, which flies over long leg"

"length and angling across off, gets forward and pushes the ball to cover-point. The off-side ring is well populated"
"nicked behind. Good length and angling away outside off, kicks up from a length. Rafatullah slashes away from the body and is surprised by the extra bounce. He edges it behind with the keeper completing a regulation catch"
"fuller ball, angling away outside off, closes the face of his bat as he pushes off the front foot and they take off for the single though the ball has gone straight to mid-on. Complete it fairly easily in the end"
"superb delivery. On a length, in the corridor and nipping back in late. Haddin sticks his bat out and gets duly beaten"
"short of a length outside off, opens his bat face and drops it in front of third man"
"short of a length outside off, punched crisply off the backfoot but straight to covers"
gets some bounce as it skids through from short of a length and Smith tries to force it through the off side but does not find the middle of his bat
"fuller ball, clipped away off the pads wide of mid-on"
that's a superb delivery. Cuts back in from the short of a length region and Haddin is looking to tuck it away off the pads into the leg side. It keeps a tad low and he gets rapped on the pads and the umpire's finger goes up almost straightaway. What a start for Peshawar. Islamabad are 15 for 2 after three overs. This is exactly what Peshawar needed defending a low total
worked into the leg side for a single
tucked away to midwicket
"fuller ball, comes forward and clips this through to midwicket"

"fires it full and on the pads, slides in with the angle and it is pushed to the right of the bowler"

"gets a good, positive stride forward to meet this length and stabs it into the off side and thinks of the single but the bowler runs across on the follow-through to gather it and they decide against it"

"short of a length, holding its line outside off this time and Smith punches solidly off the backfoot towards mid-off"
"length ball, skidding through and cutting back in again and Smith manages to tucks it away into the leg side off the pads. Did he get an inside edge on to the pads there? He did as the bowler goes up in a stifled appeal but no problems there"
"fullish length ball outside off, comes forward and blocks and drills it hard into the turf as the ball goes behind the stumps, towards the wicketkeeper after it bounces"

"length ball, angling away on off, comes forward and drops it in front of the covers region for a quick single"
"short of a length ball, stays in the crease and nudges it to the leg side"
cramps him for room by bowling it on off. It's back of a length but Smith can only tap it to the off side off the backfoot. This is good bowling. Can he make Smith try to force something here?
good length ball to end the over. Defended back to the bowler
comes down the track to meet the pitch of this ball and uses the inward angle to clip it away to between midwicket and long-on
tries to slap it through the off side and chops it towards long-off
strides forward to meet the pitch of the ball and drops it in front of the cover-point region
backs away and tries to hammer this one away through the off side but can only work it back to the bowler. Smith is struggling here
"Shakib does well to toss it up and gets it to turn away but Smith brings in the long handle as he reaches out for it and carves it straight down the ground, for a clean six. That was just power that saved him there. Shakib won't be too discouraged by that"
skews it off the splice to the covers region
comes down the track and clips it away to midwicket
stays in the crease and tries to whip this through the leg side but does not middle it and the ball goes towards the short leg fielder. Smith is slow off the blocks and the keeper gathers it and fires a throw. Direct hit at the non-striker's end would have seen the back of him
worked away to deep midwicket
stays back and looks to work this through the off side but the ball spins the other way as it's the googly and takes the inside edge of Smith's blade
"long handle again, that's another pressure-releasing shot. Afridi floats up a length ball and offers up a lot of width outside off and Smith has all the time in the world to get down on one knee and slog it long and hard over deep midwicket"

comes down the track and looks to carve this short of a length ball through the off side but he gets an inside edge and chops it on to the stumps. Peshawar have every reason to believe that they can defend this total. The bowler dragged the pace back there and that did the trick

"shorter in length, cut to backward point"
"length ball, Misbah blocks from the crease and Afridi almost leaps up in celebration as the ball nearly takes out the stumps off the pads. He got a thickish inside edge"
length ball that is angled away and there is just enough room for Smith who stays leg side of the ball and absolutelu pummels it with a half-angled bat past mid-off who starts to his right but has no chance to get to it
"full toss, misses out as he tries to drag it away into the leg side and closes the face of his bat. Went too hard at it and messed up the timing"
slightly slower and on a fullish length outside off. It is going away from him but Smith once again opts to heave it over the leg side. Does not find the middle of the bat but still decent enough connection as the ball goes to the cow corner boundary
that's just brute force. Half-volley outside off and Smith puts the right foot across while making sure he gives himself enough room before crashing it through extra cover
"slower short ball, gets up and tries to flay it through the off side but goes through with the shot early and gets beaten by the lack of pace"

"back of a length and it is whipped off the backfoot very hard back to the bowler. Was that a chance! Yes, it was. That was flat-batted with immense power and Afridi barely had time to react to it. Gets his fingers to it but cannot hold on to the ball. Unfair to call that a dropped catch"

"short of a length, not much turn, whipped away off the backfoot wide of long-on"
"length ball on leg stump, not much bounce, tucked away off the pads through the leg side"
Misbah falters on the pull shot. Not a great delivery. Short and he swivels around with the pull but does not time it too well. Sends it straight into the hands of Wahab Riaz at deep midwicket. That maybe didn't sit up as well as he would have liked. And he got it off the toe end of the bat
"slightly short of good length, Watson backs before punching it against the angle to long-off"

"<b>appeal for caught behind, not given</b>. That was gone, there was an edge but the umpire didn't think so.

"short of a length and wide outside off, punched off the backfoot through the covers region. And that's the <b>fifty for Smith</b>. Can he finish the job for his team?"

"full and wide outside off, enough width on offer and Smith pummels it straight over the bowler's head for a straight as an arrow boundary"
"short of good length and it is just nonchalantly flicked off the pads, gets it wide of the fielder at square leg and the ball goes through the deep backward square leg boundary. Can't be bowling there at this stage to a set batsman"

short ball again but this one gets up considerably and is a wide for height
starts to take a step forward again and Wahab bangs it in and Smith backs away before fending it off and dropping it into the off side with a flat bat. Good contest between bat and ball going on
"very full ball outside off, dug out to extra cover for a quick single"
"oh, dear!  Of all the balls to get out to, he has picked a full toss. But hang on. Is that a no-ball. They are going upstairs to check for height. They check for front foot first and it's fine but just about. Almost overstepped. But no doubts when it comes to the waist height because that was clearly well above waist height. Smith slashed at the ball and holed out to sweeper cover. Could not get hold of the shot because of the height. But he survives in the end and they get a free hit"
"full toss again, very nearly another no-ball. Smith tries to go big over the leg side but cannot get hold of the shot as he flat-bats it into the hands of long-on. Does not matter. The catch does not count"
"oh, dear. That's a shocker. Tries for a wide yorker and ends up bowling a high full toss and well outside off. Nice work by Kamran Akmal to get across and prevent byes. Totally not in control of that"
goes for a wide yorker again but this is a low full toss outside off and is worked away to third man. Smith back on strike
"still can't get the yorker right, low full toss, angling in, drilled away to long-off"
he is restlessly awitching angles but just cannot get the yorker right. Low and wide full toss and he is lucky that the batsman found the bottom end of the bat or it would have been a wide
"very full and too wide again, batsman reaches out and does not make contact and it is a wide. He really needs to take a moment and rethink. This just isn't working out"
make that another attempted yorker gone wrong. Full toss and lot of width and you can't get away with those at this stage of a chase. Watson flays  it clean over long-off. Tamim Iqbal can only watch it go to the boundary. This is turning into a nightmarish over for Junaid and Peshawar
"that's a humongous hit. That one lands on the roof. Watson has laid into a pull shot. Short ball from over the stumps and sits up nicely. Watson was probably expecting a short ball to be around the corner after all the attempted yorkers gone wrong. That's a mighty pull shot, played with authority. On the roof and will stay there"
"yorker on leg stump, tries to flick but is late in bringing the bat down and wears it on the pad"
"slower ball bouncer, Smith gets under it and the umpire thinks the height is fine there"

"short of a length outside off, slaps with a flat bat to the extra cover region and cover runs across and slides to field it. Well-done"
Darren Sammy's six foot five frame can't get to that at the long-off boundary. Great effort as he leaps up and gets a fingertip to it but even he could not get to it as the ball clips the fingers and sails over the boundary. Full and in the slot and it is hammered over mid-off

"low full toss outside off, pushed off the front foot to long-off"

"Watson hammers this to sweeper cover and Smith comes charging back for the second. The throw comes on at the bowler's end and Junaid does not collect the ball. Had he gathered it, the batsman would have been out by a mile"
"slower ball on leg stump, does not bounce and hits Watson on the pad"
there is a review for a run out and Watson is short of his ground. He is gone and the crowd has found its voice again. Islamabad looking to finish it off with one ball to spare but Kamran Akmal gathers the ball and whips the bails off to make sure that does not happen. Worked it with a flat bat to long-on and came charging back for the second
Junaid gets the yorker wrong and bowls a low full toss. Amad drills it past the diving mid-on fielder to take the single and pumps the air in delight. What a match
