a full swingy delivery to start. Full and swinging back in the air. Tamim drives but gets a thick inside edge into his boot.
and that's SL's first. Full and swinging in prodigiously. It was closer to the feet so Tamim was hustled for pace too. Swung back in the air by a stump or two. Tamim struggles to get his feet out the way and the ball sneaks between  bat and pad to hit middle and leg stump. Malinga is elated.
"attacking the stumps again. Full and straight, moving away outside off. Sabbir is watchful in defense"
"a slower delivery this time. 117 kph, slower yorker. Sabbir keeps it out"
that's the change in length. A shorter delivery outside off that takes off and gains altitude as it flies over Kusal's head. Five wides. But a good change-up from Malinga
"leading edge and it lands safe! Full on middle and leg, Sabbir, instead of playing with a straight bat, closes the bat face too early. The top edge lands wide of cover. He gets a run too"
"<strong>dropped</strong>. A sitter. A clanger. Deceives Sarkar in pace. May have been pace off the ball, a slower delivery on off. Sarkar pokes and chips a ball straight back at Malinga who gets low to his left, but the ball hits the hard part of his palm and bursts out. Yikes."
"nicely hit. Full on middle and leg, worked away through midwicket for three. The fielder dived to his left but somehow let the ball go through"
"<strong>big appeal</strong>. No, says the umpire. That pitched outside leg. Full delivery on the pads, Sarkar misses a routine flick."
"heaved over midwicket. Full delivery and straight, Soumya strides down and mows the ball over the in-field. Good hit"
a slower delivery goes awry. Slips down leg for a wide
"good length delivery outside off, Soumya guides the ball wide of point for a couple to third man. Good running, nice intent"
"114 kph, deceived by pace again. Another slower delivery on off, Soumya lines a slog but toe-ends the ball down to third man instead"
"that's good batting. A length delivery outside off, dabbed down to third man for a run."
"a dangerous stroke to the ball swinging away. But it's on the pads, full on leg, flicked to deep square leg"
"swing. But it's poor direction. Full, drifting down leg. Soumya tickles the ball fine. Off the pad or off the bat, doesn't matter. The result is four. Leg byes signalled"
"that's poor bowling. The line was better. Starting that inswinger wide outside off, but he doesn't pitch the ball. A full toss is drilled through cover"
"good run. Full and swinging back in on off, dabbed to third man"
"sticks with the outswinger. Shortish delivery outside off, moving away. Dabbed to point"
"good finish. Length on middle and leg, defended into the leg side. Tidily played by these two"
"nope, poor again. Are they struggling with the grip? Full delivery waaay down leg. May have been close to a wide to a right-hander"
"78 mph, full on off, right in the slot for Sarkar who bottom-hand jabs the leather off the ball, but finds midwicket"
"better. That's more timing, than power. Full on middle and leg, worked away towards midwicket who dives to his right to save some runs"
"this is good, <b>clever, thinking</b> batting. Predicts where the ball could be. With this field, he's thinking something straight. So he dances down, and gives himself room. Gets something full and lofts the ball over cover for four."
"that is good too. A low full toss on middle, worked towards midwicket for a run"
"this is really good from Bangladesh. Again, sees the field, anticipates a straight delivery. Gives himself room in the crease, and drills a drive through mid-off. Not great timing but enough"
"good batting again. Full and straight, pushed to mid-off for one. Essentially, <strong>they've made two extra runs</strong> by looking for singles after a boundary instead of blocking. The finer margins of T20 cricket"
"eeks. Sloppy, sloppy. A slower full toss outside off. Soumya guides the ball down to third man for a run. But the fielder, Sanjaya, fumbles and allows a second. So there's three extra runs for Bangladesh"
was there some bat on that? A slower delivery that is short. That's clever from Malinga. Sarkar gets a bit of bat on his attempted guide but the ball lands <strong>short of the keeper</strong>
"carved past point. Three. Full and wide, Sarkar opens the face and slices the ball past backward point. Third man has to run around."
"no-ball. Free hit. Four. No, five. It's crazy. It's T20 cricket. Malinga loses control of his slower yorker, it's a very high full toss that Sabbir deflects down to short fine leg"
"excellent execution. A wide yorker outside off, Sabbir stays in his crease, tries to get underneath the ball but fails to do so. A catch at cover, not legal of course"
"a mow attempted. Pace off the ball, slower ball on off. Sabbir mis-times his swat to mid-on"
"he takes Malinga on, and gets six for it. Malinga can't stem the runs either. 16 off it. A slower delivery on leg, Soumya lays into his flick and gets so much behind the ball that it clears square leg."
"good batting. Full outside off, pushed towards cover. Prasanna runs in and effects a direct hit at the bowler's end. And Sabbir is short. Looked like he was veering away, instead of going in straight lines. And that could have been the margin of a run and a wicket. Out comes the dab from Prasanna. That's not very good running, <b>can't be let down by simple basics</b> at this level."
"128 kph, good length on middle and leg, pushed away towards cover"
"a wide yorker outside off, Soumya opens the bat face but fails to make contact. An optimistic appeal is quickly shot down. Bat hitting ground"
a wide yorker. Good stuff. Sarkar mis-times his drive back to the bowler. Excellent execution
"Bangladesh lose another. They're falling away. Is that a wise decision? It was good thinking but awful execution. The slower delivery on leg, Sarkar backs away and looks to hit the ball over mid-off, but can only skew the ball down the throat of long-on. He's thrown away a fantastic chance."
"strays down leg, off the pad towards square leg for a leg bye."
"slower delivery outside off, clipped to midwicket"
nicely pushed to long-on for a single
"a low full toss on the pads, worked to midwicket. SL back in this"
hit down to long-off from the crease. Tidy stuff
"that's T20 batting. He shaped for a reverse sweep, but if he missed that, he was gone. Full delivery, swerving back in. The shot goes wide of short third man and carries away to the boundary. Risk and reward, directly proportional with that"
clipped through square leg
"excellent batting. Flat on off, pushed towards point for a run. That's what you do after a loss in momentum"
"pushed through outside off, hit back"
nudged to deep midwicket from the straight line
"that is not good batting. not with two fielders there. Flat delivery outside off, Mushfiqur reverse-paddles the ball towards short third man. Almost carries. Not a percentage option. if there was one fielder there, it would have been a high-percentage stroke"
worked away to midwicket
"again, hurrying Shakib with a flat trajectory. Punched to long-on"
"low-arm action, gets it to skid on. Pushed to long-off from the off-stump line"
"misses his shot and is bowled. Another poor shot from Mushfiqur. A slow delivery on off, offcutter. Gets low, looks to paddle a sweep over the keeper but misses the straight delivery. It knocks into off stump. Not an 8.2 overs shot."
worked away towards midwicket
driven to long-on. Too full that
"full and straight, driven back. Good batting too, pushed back to the bowler with a straight face"
"slow on off and middle, hit back. Tidy stuff from Asela"
"flat and straight, off the inside edge towards square leg for a single"

hit away to cover. Another dot ball
nudged away through midwicket for a run. Good stuff from SL.
nicely hit though cover for a single
"superb timing, even better stop. A full delivery on off is hammered back towards long-off. Looks set for the boundary, but Kapugedara dives to his left to save two runs."
swept away towards deep backward square leg
played away quietly towards square leg for one. Better
"too short this time, good options from Shakib. Drilling his drive to long-off"
carves a guide to short third man. Dot. Six off it. Tidy from both sides
"one more. Bangladesh stumbling along. A full delivery from Prasanna. Shakib tries to hit the ball through cover, but can only skew the ball off the outside half to point. No timing at all."
gets low and paddles a sweep down to fine leg for a couple
"pushed through, flat and wide, guided to point"
comes down and misses a flick. Strikes the pad.
nicely driven but finds cover. Another dot ball
"goes back and punches a jab to long-on. SL tidy again, they've roared back into this"
"slow delivery outside off, driven upto cover"

"should have done more with that. Short and wide, carved away to a deep cover"
"shortish delivery outside off, pushed to point for one"
tapped away towards point for a run.
"carved away for four. That's a sensational shot. Full and wide, scythes it away through point for four. Fantastic timing"
"excellent bowling. Sees Mahmudullah coming and fires it wide, driven to cover. Didn't look to bail out"
"flight outside off, carved away towards deep extra cover"
loads of flight outside off. A full toss. Hit away to the sweeper cover
"they just don't look comfortable while reverse-sweeping. Flat outside off, off the pad to third man"
nicely hit to long-off for a run
"shot! That's sublime batting. Knew his areas. Tossed up outside off, saw cover was open and nailed his drive in the gap. Fantastic timing"
"nice from Mahmudullah. On the pads, flicked to short fine leg for a run. Mahmudullah calls his partner through. there is a direct hit at the bowler's end, but Mosaddek is safe"
"nice slower ball, well worked into the gap at midwicket"
strays down leg for a wide
"nice timing. SL's well-drilled fielding team are just fantastic. A nice yorker, which is whipped with an incredibly strong bottom hand past midwicket, but Kapugedara dives to his right and saved the boundary"
another slower delivery gone wrong. That's another free run. These two doing it nicely now
"executes his yorker on leg, clipped through square leg"
another bottom-handed clip through midwicket for a couple. This is nice from these two. <strong>Using the dimensions of the field</strong>
"a yorker, played to deep midwicket for one"
a nice delivery. Just misses his yorker. A low full toss is worked through square leg for a couple more. Fantastic batting.
"somehow finds the gap. A false stroke but gets away with it. A short legcutter outside off, Mahmudullah carves a cut through point. A bit airy, but lands safe"
"123 kph, low full toss, clipped away to deep square leg"
"a naughty full toss outside off, sliced straight to Prasanna at backward point. Prasanna and Mosaddek exchange some words"
"a legcutter outside off, or the legbreak. Mosaddek misses a cut"
"finds the gap this time. Rubbish bowling. A legcutter, short and wide. Cut through point again. Sits up for that stroke"
"delectable stroke-making. Overpitched delivery outside off, Mahmudullah keeps his shape and hits the best possible stroke. A lovely cover drive. All along the ground"
"full and straight, nudged to deep midwicket"
looking for the yorker again. Just misses it. A low full toss is whipped to deep square leg. These are good results for Bangladesh
too straight. Too full. Clipped down to fine leg for a single
"excellent bowling. Well played too. Yorker on middle, jammed out"
"another low full toss, played away to deep square leg"
"a yorker on middle, bunted to long-on. A call of two, but the fielder is quick on it"
"a low full toss on leg, Mahmudullah should have hit that for four but can only swivel flick to deep square leg"
"a slow legcutting yorker on leg, 94.3 kph. Driven to long-on"
a wide yorker. Actually made wide by Mahmudullah giving himself room. Misses a cut
"runs down and smashes a ball down to long-off. Good, hustling full length that"
"oh, superb. Gives himself room, but Sanjaya nails his yorker. Spears it on off. Mosaddek gives himself room and squeezes a drive behind point for four. Great stuff"
"Malinga's fantastic again in execution. Follows Mahmudullah, who backs away. It's a yorker. mahmudullah tries to do something but carves a guide straight into his middle stump. Just couldn't do much with that."
"a low full toss on leg, nudged away to square leg. Mortaza labours back for the second"
"a dipping yorker. Looks for it, but misses. Strays down leg for a wide"
"oh great bowling. But well played too. Gives himself room, Malinga is zoning in on that off stump. Squirted down to fine leg off the inside edge"
convincingly deceived him there. A slow dipping yorker down leg. Mosaddek gives himself room but plays a flick too early
"chipped to deep cover for a couple. Another low full toss outside off, bunted away for a couple. Another laboured two"
"well played. A low full toss on leg, clipped to deep midwicket for one. Not a bad result. Decent over for both sides"

"a wide yorker outside off, jammed away towards cover for one. Good bowling"
"another slower delivery outside off, carved away to deep point. Just one more"

"slow on middle and leg, played down towards midwicket. This is good decisive bowling"
flicked away towards square leg for a run

"lovely shot. Back of a length on middle, swivel-pulled to the fine leg boundary. Comfortable enough"
drifts down leg for another extra
"good length delivery outside off, guided away towards backward point"
"a wild heave from Tharanga but he won't care. Full and wide outside off, Tharanga opts to go over mid-on but gets  a thick outside edge which flies over nobody at slip"
"nails that. Back of a length on off, sits up for Tharanga and he hammers his swat over midwicket. No one there. These are easy runs"
"back of a length down leg, clipped down to fine leg"
"full delivery outside off, Kusal looks to hit the ball too hard over mid-off. Makes contact with nothing but air"
"gets some swing. Good length delivery on leg, swings back in. Cramps Tharanga for pace. Off the pad into the off side, a good call of yes from Kusal"
"runs down. Back of a length, swerving back in. A mis-timed pull towards mid-on"
"fullish delivery around off and middle, off the leading edge towards cover"
"gives himself room. Good length on middle and leg, Tharanga backs away and hits a punch to cover"
"finds the gap. And that will be four. Good length delivery around middle and leg, Tharanga fails to time his square punch and is lucky that he finds the Colombo grass."
"good length on middle, pulled down to long-on"
"full delivery outside off, muscled to mid-off. Looking to hit the ball too hard"

"full delivery, driven to mid-off for a quick run. Decent stuff from Mustafizur"
paddle-swept to backward square leg. No turn. Straight on
"great execution. And it's six. Flat delivery on off, Kusal gets across, gets underneath the ball and pulls the ball over deep backward square leg, Carries all the way for six."
"hammered for four more. That was good bowling. Saw Kusal coming so he shortened his length. But Kusal picks a good area, straight down. Long-on can't get across"
"nicely swept to deep square leg for one. Exceptional, clean work from Sabbir at the boundary"
"and again, good bowling. Sees Tharanga coming so shortens the length. Tharanga looks to go over cover, but mis-times the ball to deep midwicket"
"gets underneath that sufficiently and will get four. Slow delivery on middle and leg, Kusal dances down, gets close to the pitch and lofts the ball over mid-off. Superb"
"a low full toss on leg, pushed to cover for a run"
superb yorker. On middle. Worked to midwicket
"fullish delivery outside off, right in Tharanga's arc, but he misses his cut somehow"
"another good yorker, low full toss on off. Worked to square leg"
"that's four. Picks the length early. Picks the slower ball early. Picks the line early. Short on middle and leg, pulled down behind square. And his fast hands does the rest."
"shot of the day! And we've seen some pretty good ones. Very full, very straight. Kusal offers the full face and smashes an on-drive to long-on. All timing. Not often associated with Kusal"
"full and wide, caressed to deep cover"
"picks the gap again. Short on off, pulled in front of square for a couple. Nice"
"powered through cover. Short of a length on off, Kusal stays back and flat-bats a slap between mid-off and cover"
"offcutter on off, pushed to long-off"
"Tharanga picks out short third man. Good length delivery outside off, gets some lift from the pitch. Tharanga can't keep his guide down. Picks out Mustafizur who dives forward and takes a neat catch. Too late?"
"good length outside off, carved down to third man for one"
charges. But the length is shortish. So Munaweera guides a dab to third man
"carved away through backward point. A low full toss outside off, Kusal plays this late to get a couple"
"slower ball outside off, slapped to long-on"
"full and straight, a thick outside edge down to third man for one. Decent action, skiddy bowler"

"slower ball on off, pushed to long-off"
"good length on leg, Munaweera punches to the sweeper cover"
"slower delivery on middle, scythed to deep point"
"a soft dismissal. Slower delivery again from Mortaza, Munaweera backs away and chips a simple return catch to Mortaza. Caught in two minds because of that wily line and length. Followed Munaweera, cramped him for room"
"good length outside off, carved down to third man for a single"
"out comes Kusal's strong bottom hand. Shortish outside off, pulled to deep midwicket"
"another reverse-sweep, not needed. Flat on off, hit decently to short third man. But that's at least a productive area for Kusal"
""
"absolute tripe. A filthy short delivery on leg, pulled to deep square leg"
"shortish on leg, worked to deep midwicket"
pushed away to long-off
"full and flat delivery down leg, swept down to short fine leg. A dot ball"
calmly hit to long-on
"flat on off, Kusal backs away and hits a drive to the sweeper cover."
"too much flight, outside off. Nicely carved to deep point for a run"
"a good decision. I've seen those given based on the ugliness of the shot. Flat delivery on leg, Kusal misses a reverse-sweep and is struck in front of leg. The appeal is turned down. Sliding down"
"shot. Picks the length early, gets low and hammers a pull through square leg. <strong>Gets to fifty</strong>"
"slowish delivery on the pads, Kusal misses a flick. Struck on the pads, maybe some bat too"
"good length delivery outside off, nicely guided down to third man. Good technique he has Asela"
"wow, he's so strong there. A full delivery on the pads, but that shot was made by his bottom hand. Picks the length, the line and whips the ball through midwicket. Hit it in the air, needs exceptional strength"
"a slower ball down leg, off the pad to square leg. Playing it nicely"
"slower delivery outside off, carved to the sweeper cover. Opened the face late"
"what was that appeal for? Good length on middle, Kusal inside-edges the ball through his legs for a run to midwicket. Clear bat. 100 up for SL."
"good length delivery outside off, too much width. Slapped to the deep point fielder"
runs down and works the ball to deep midwicket
"the slider outside off, pushed to long-off"
"phew, <strong>didn't miss by much</strong>. Flat outside off, skids on and misses the bat and the stumps."
"short and wide, hit to deep point"
worked quietly to deep midwicket
"shortish and wide, Asela picks out point with his cut. Should have done more with that"
"overpitched outside off, hammered to long-off"
good length delivery. Harries Asela for pace. Inside-edged into the not-so-pleasant region to get hit. Youch!
nicely dabbed to third man. Let the ball come to him
"short, slow delivery on off. Swatted to deep point. This asking rate going up"
"good length delivery outside off, pulled to deep square leg. Just one"
"a yorker to finish. Hit past the bowler for a run to long-on. That's very good bowling, didn't try too much. <strong>Just keeps Bangladesh in it for longer</strong>, take it late"
"flat and wide outside off, skids on, no turn. Kusal misses his reverse sweep"

"<strong>lands in no-man's land.</strong> Flat on off, Kusal runs down and closes his bat face too early. Lobs in the air and falls safe"
"fantastic shot. Flat delivery outside off, walks across, sees midwicket is up and then sweeps the ball over midwicket. Thinking batting"
"tossed up outside off, driven to long-off"
"overpitched outside off, hit to long-off for one. Decent over for SL, nine off it"
"slower delivery and straight, Kusal gives himself room and hits the ball to cover. Decent areas."
"<strong>dropped!</strong> That should be taken at this level. Full delivery outside off, Kusal backs away, and slices a guide to short third man. Taskin somehow lets it go through his hands"
"why wasn't that out? He may still be out, though. Asela is run-out. A high full toss on middle and leg, Asela misses a flick. But did he get some bat on it. The ball ricochets towards cover. Asela isn't quick across the pitch, maybe because of the body blow he just wore. Labours towards the other end. Sabbir runs in from cover, picks up, turns around and effects a direct hit at the bowler's end to find Asela well short. That's fantastic fielding."
"lovely batting. Full and straight, Kusal walks across and lofts the ball over cover. Exceptional stroke."
"slower ball on leg, pushed to long-off"
"full delivery on middle, worked past midwicket for a couple."
"shortish and wide, slapped to deep cover. Just one"

"shortish outside off, pushed down to long-off"
"that's four more. That length is a gamble. A bouncer on middle and leg, Prasanna pulls, gets some glove on that stroke and the ball clears the keeper. Vital"
"full delivery on off, inside-edged towards square leg for one. Very handy over for SL, 12 from it"
"a low full toss, pushed to cover. Low bat lift from Prasanna"
"a slower offcutter outside off, Prasanna looks to lap the ball through fine leg but misses"
"another dot. Good line. Full and wide from Mustafizur, Prasanna misses his drive. Three dots."

"a low full toss on middle and leg, heaved away to deep midwicket. Just one"
"that's a match winner. Full delivery on middle, right in the slot. And boom. Off the middle of the bat and Prasanna's hoick goes way over midwicket for six. A stare from Prasanna."
"taken. Good bowling from Taskin. Back o a length on middle, Kusal backs away, looks to hit the ball straight but can only lob the ball to Soumya at mid-off. One of a very few deliveries Kusal has mis-timed. A special innings from Kusal."
"full delivery outside off, in the arc. Prasanna misses his swing."
"how? how? How did he get so much power on that? Wow. A low full toss, Prasanna just lifts the ball over long-on. 87 metres. Sublime hitting"
"a slower delivery outside off, hammered past the bowler. The mid-off fielder dives to his right to delay the conclusion"
"that's that. A low full toss from Taskin, Thisara watches the ball onto his bat and punches a lofted drive over mid-on for four. <strong>Sri Lanka take an unassailable lead in the T20 series. </strong>"
