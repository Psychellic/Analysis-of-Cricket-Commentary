"short of a length, slower and angled just enough across the left-hander to beat the outside egde"
that's huge. Belted out of here. Offers him loads of width outside off and all Devcich needs to do turn around and shovel this over deep midwicket
that's awful from Zaman. Hasan angles this into his middle and off-stump. Lands it just short of a length and Zaman blindly swings looking for a big heave. Gets tucked up for room and beaten as the ball goes over the stumps
blocked towards mid-off
"Hasan drops it short again but this time it's angled into off-stump, Zaman swivels and pulls to deep backward square leg"
"back-of-the-hand slower ball, fullish outside off, Zaman opens the face and steers to point"
"one shot too many from Zaman who has clearly learned nothing from his previous error. No room again and he tries to cart this back of a length delivery over the leg side but the ball curves in, kisses the inside edge and smashes into off-stump"
"that's a brute first-up to McCullum. Short, dead straight and accurate around middle, McCullum gets completely squared up and just about manages to drag his head out of the way"
Devcich skies this one but it drops short of the two fielders giving it a chase at long-on. Drags this from well outside off and does not find the middle. Sameem at long-on gets down after the ball bounces and gets a hand but he has made contact with the boundary
blocked to the off side
stays legside of this wide yorker and makes no contact
"short of a length, backs away and opens the face to point"
"again drags one from outside off. This is a repeat of the first delivery of the over, just that he's made a lot better connection and sends it soaring over deep midwicket"
"<b>dropped</b>. Umaid almost pulls off a stunner. Sends down a full toss that comes at an awkward height. Devcich awkwardly tries to pull it away and skews it up off the top-edge. Umaid darts back, gets right underneath and gets a hand, too, but it pops out as he drops down and the hand hits the turf hard"
throws hard hands and mistimes this to cover
"angled into middle and leg, clipped to midwicket"
that's huge. Steps down the track to a short of a length delivery and gives himself enough room to flay this well over long-on. An 88-meter six

"attempts a back-of-the-hand legcutter, slips out of the hand and goes slips away outside off"
<b>brilliant save at cover</b>. Hafeez flings himself to his right to stop this hard slap. Absolutely thumped by Devcich. Had four written all over

"full, driven to wide long-off"
front leg out of the way as he gets down on the back knee and slogs a length ball from outside off over deep midwicket. Ugly but effective. Right off the middle
"<b>dropped?</b>. Nah, just couldn't get to it, it seems. Reverse sweep from Devcich, not full enough, and he knocks it in the air as a result. Short third man dives to the right and sticks out the right hand but can't get there. Would have been an outstanding catch"

good high catch at long leg. Wahab with a shortish delivery. Salman is too close to it and miscues a pull off the toe end of the bat. Dawson runs forward and settles under it in the deep. Didn't entirely get underneath it so had to put in a dive in the end to complete it. But well-done
"flighted outside off, Devcich comes down the track and swings big but doesn't get to the pitch and gets a leading edge that pops away to third man"
now that's a clean strike. Lots of flight again and he stays inside the crease this time and slogs it away over deep midwicket
Dawson overcompensates with this length and drops this short. Devcich frees up his arms and slaps it over the long-off fielder jumping up at the boundary

<b>dropped</b>. Devcich has been put down and how costly will that prove? Devcich steps down the track and ends up getting too far away from the line. And it's slower as well and he mistimes his swipe off the outside of the bat to third man where two fielders run towards it. Sameen Gul gets to it in the end and spills

"full toss, pummeled down to long-on"
poor cricket all around. Sadaf squeezes out this extremely full delivery to cover and Akhtar takes off for a run though Sadaf isn't interested at all. He is three-quarters the pitch down and has to make it back. Hasan runs across to cover and had forever to take aim and throw and he misses and they eventually take the single anyway. Horrific

that's some tripe. These are nothing deliveries. Curves in from well outside off and holds its line and he sees the room and punches off the backfoot through the gap at cover
now he sprays it down the leg side. Well down. No control at all on his lines and lengths
"is that also a wide? Yes, it is. Overcompensates with the line and takes it too far outside off"
"gets duly punished for the extra ball. A short one with ample width and Kamran Akmal slaps it through backward point. A highlights package of an over to kick off the chase. Twenty off it. Safe to assume, perhaps, that we won't be seeing Devcich again in this game. At least not anytime soon"
