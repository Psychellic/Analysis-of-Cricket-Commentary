"length, and cracked towards cover. A bit low on the bat, though, as Guptill examines the state of his bat"
"length, angles back in, and he defends"
"<strong>sharp bouncer</strong>, angles in to him, and not short enough for Guptill to get out of the way. Ducks into it a bit, and allows this to pass over his left shoulder. Bowled at 136.4kph"
"length, around off, and he defends"
"<strong>another good ball!</strong> Back of a length, around off, and Guptill's eyes light up, looking to get a slash past point going. It moves away from outside off, and beats the bat"

"length, and he drives this through to the sweeper at deep point"
"length, around off, and he defends from the crease"
"length, played towards short mid-wicket with a flick of the wrists"

"slower ball, around off, and he plays this towards point. Bowled at just 116kph"
"length, comes back in from outside off, and he goes back to tap this right in front of point. Quick single, well taken"
"fuller, around off, and driven back towards the bowler"

"length, angles into his pads, and he whips this away past Finch at short mid-wicket. Only one run before Finch can go after this and pull it back"
"short, and he looks to hook this away. Through to Carey, and they don't have a review remaining. <strong>The umpire says not out anyway</strong>. Good ball, as it angles in sharply after pitching. More movement off the seam than anything else, and the pace just hurries on to Nicholls"
"length, around off, angles back in, and he defends"

"closer to him, angles down the pads, and he can whip it away towards deep mid-wicket"
"<strong>there's the breakthrough!</strong> Hazlewood bowls one slightly fuller, and just around off. Nicholls looks for the drive, but gets a substantial edge as he does so.

"length, and he looks to flick. Has to check his shot, as the ball just holds up a bit on the pitch. Back towards the bowler"
"<strong>that's a good shot!</strong> Skips down the wicket, and clears mid-on. Knows that he just needs to time it well enough to get it over the fielder"

"length on off stump, driven on the rise to sweeper cover"
"<b>run-out chance missed.</b> That's poor, and in-the-shell cricket. Length ball outside off, nudged to extra cover's right. Lazy jog down the pitch without a call. Partner responds late and then jumps out of the crease at the other end briefly. Labuschagne goes for the non-strikers end and misses. Just stuck in a funk, New Zealand, that was nearly curtains for Williamson. The danger would seemingly be at the strikers end where Guptill was halfway down, but for some reaosn, Williamson, who wasn't running at all, also ended up outside the crease"

Not sure if he picked that or not - he looked to flick but the bat was well away from the body. Through the gap goes Zampa and knocks the stumps. Dip and deception."
"<b>big appeal for lbw</b> as he's struck in front trying to paddle. Was there bat? Impact outside off? Slider outside off and he was down early for the shot. Indicates bat or glove as soon as he's hit on the pad. And Hotspot confirms that. No reviews remaining for Australia, remember"

"<b>straight to mid-on!</b> Length ball outside off, steps out and looks to slap that on the rise.

"<b>big lbw appeal!</b> But he might have got outside the line of off. Might have been bat too. Length outside off, shuffled to try and flick that.

"length on leg stump, deflected into the square leg region off the front foot"
"short of a length outside off, chopped to backward point"
"<b>in the air</b> but just wide of mid-off. Offcutter, short of a length outside off. Drives on the up and with the weight going backwards. Not in control of that but safe in the end"
"<b>taken at backward point!</b> Goes on the up once more but this time he won't survive. Short of a length, sticking in the pitch again. Smith leaps to his left and grabs on to it. Not at all an easy shot on this pitch. Cummins was brought on for just this. New Zealand sliding big time"

Colin de Grandhomme took the bait, but also got a bit of the toe end of the bat. Starc takes a good catch, running away and bending to his right.
