ooh nice swing. 126 kph loopy inswinger on Rohit's pads. Not the ideal place to start. rohit tickles it fine with a very deft touch. Past short fine leg for four to start.
adjusts his length straightaway. Starts his inswinger much wider and the line is perfect. Close to off and defended comfortably
"nice shot. Full and wide outside off, Rohit presses forward to drive to cover."
"fullish on off, 129 kph, Rohit lunges forward in a defensive prod. Good line this after a loose first"

"awful delivery after three good ones. Short down leg, Chand cannot connect with a pull, but a wide is called"
"half-volley on off and middle, Chand clips to mid-on. No run"
"nice line. Fullish and wide outside off, Chand wafts at it away from his body. Chand is convincingly beaten"
"gone! Chand has bunted a length delivery to mid-on. Quite a terrible shot. Good length outside off, shaping away. Chand instead of choosing the off side, elects to whip the ball into the leg side. but it is way too wide to drag and hence a bit of a leading chip carries to mid-on"
"full on off, nagging lines. Clipped to midwicket"
"expansive. Rohit picked up the length earlly. Slightly short on off, a mis-timed pull to deep midwicket"
"nice and full again on off, deviating back in. Defended"
"good length outside off, Rayudu hangs back to punch a drive to extra cover."
"cleaned im up. The ball swerves in between Rayudu's bat and pad. And clatters into off and middle. Another poor shot from Rayudu. Full delivery but sandeep has got this ball moving. This one comes back in prodigiously. Rayudu drives from the crease, his feet stuck in the crease. Comfortably deceived and the zing bails are everywhere"
"126 kph, full length on off and middle. Driven to mid-on from the crease."
"flat on off to start, worked to midwicket from the back foot. No spin at all"

"overpitched outside off, driven to cover after a front-foot lunge"
"shortens his length a touch. Good length on off, played away into the off side."

yorker on off. Rohit backs away and squeezes a late dab to short third man
"superb lines these. Good length on off, top-of-off stuff. Blocked from the crease"
"beaten. Goes fuller this time outside off, swings away just enough to beat the outside edge. Wonderful bowling"
"massive. Six. Short change-up on off, not a bad delivery. Good line. But Rana top-edges his pull and it goes a long way. Long long way. Over backward square leg"
slower offcutter to finish on off. Rana strides forward to defend
poor delivery. Short and wide to start from Stoinis. Rohit laces a cut with immense power but Miller dives across to his left to prevent the boundary.
"127 kph. Good length outside off, some away movement. A bit of a leading edge to sweeper cover"
"good length on off, defended to midwicket"
"slower offcutter on off, whipped past midwicket. Just the one but"
"back of a length down leg, off the thigh pad towards fine leg for a couple. Not got his lines right yet"
"121 kph, full on leg and middle. Rana defends"
"ooh, leading edge. Lucky for Rohit. Lots of flight on leg, the ball turns away from Rohit who is through his flick. The edge just evades cover"
that one turned as well. The regulation offbreak to the left-hander. Very wide outside off and called
another offbreak outside off. Punched back
"thrown up outside off, driven powerfully to cover"
"shortish but comes back in towards off, a thrashed cut to short third man"
"short and wide, offbreak. Keeps very low. Slapped to cover"

"flat on off, a bit of turn. Punched to long-on"
"fired in on off, not much turn. Steered to short third man"

"nice line. The flat legbreak on off, turns away. Buttler pushes to cover"
"very flat again outside off, hurriedly driven to cover. 111 kph that delivery"
"another dot. Quite full on off, Rana stays in the crease to glide his cut to point"
"fuller than a good length on off, defended into the cover area for a run"
"126 kph, a bit of nip back in. Good length on off, the ball jags back in to take Buttler's inside edge to square leg"
"edged and taken. Mumbai are in deep trouble. Nicely bowled though. May have been a wily cutter. Full and wide, and as a result of the way it was delivered, the ball cut away from Rana, who flayed at the ball with his feet rooted to the crease. A thick outside edge is comfortably taken by Saha"
"whoa. What happened there. Pollard shimmies down immediately. But Stoinis sees that movement and shortens the length. He withdraws his bat but lets the ball pound into his chest. Ouch. 105 kph, btw."
"nice end. Fullish on off, driven back to the bowler"
"flat on leg, not much turn. That allows Buttler to tuck to deep midwicket, against the turn"

"flatter trajectory this time on middle and leg, clipped to square leg"

"half-volley on off, drilled down to long-off"
"another darter on off. 110 kph. Outside off and full, Pollard smashes a drive to long-off. Another tidy over"
"poor line. Strays down leg, and Pollard misses a flick. But the ball pings off the thigh pad to the fine leg boundary. teased the short fine leg fielder all the way to the boundary"
"back of a length variation on middle, pummeled to deep midwicket. Not appropriately timed"
"gone! Buttler holes out to long-off. Sublime catch from Gurkeerat at long-off. Very full on off, Buttler backs away and smashes the ball in the air but doesn't quite time it well enough. Gurkeerat settles under it at long-off. But the ball bobbles out of his hands. Gurkeerat responds calmly, catches the rebound but as his momentum carries him over the boundary, he throws the ball back in. He returns to the field of play to take the catch. Pressure on Mumbai"
"full outside off, blocked"
"shortish length outside off, tapped into the off side for a run"
"a slower variation at 121 kph on a good length on off, Pandya's closed bat face takes the ball down to fine leg"

"flat on leg, tucked to deep square leg"
"another yorker outside off, Pandya jams his bat down in time."
"well played. Another yorker outside off, Pandya steers the ball in the gap between short third man and point. But third man gets around and gets a hand on it. he recovers quickly, gets up and chases the ball down with a full-length dive at the boundary. Saves one"
"what a shot to finish. A very flat delivery on leg, Pollard gets his bat down in the line and then just whips the ball over wide long-on for six. Immense power on that, fantastic shot"
"six more. Flat outside off, Pandya gets down low and sweeps the ball over long-on. Got enough power behind it too. Superb batting"
"fired in on leg from around the wicket, clipped to long-on"
"another flatter delivery on middle, Pollard calmly tickles it fine where no one is present. Square leg has to run around to keep it in, and he does so but not before the batsmen get three. Cleverly played"
"massive appeal, pitched outside leg. Fired in on leg, Pandya misses a slog sweep;"
"yorker on off, squeezed to long-on"
"mis-timed for six. Axar has a wry smile on his face, primarily because he deceived Pollard there. Slowed up the offspinner, Pollard looked to whip the ball into the leg side but the ball spin away. took the outside half of his bat and skewed away for six over long-off"
"nice idea, but execution lacking. Good length outside off, Pandya plays a late dab but straight to short third man"
"slower offcutter outside off. Too full, allows Pandya to get under it, and then carve the ball intentionally over point"
"shortish on off, Pandya is through the shot too early but finds a gap at wide long-on for a couple"
"not got  that and Pandya holes out to deep midwicket. Shortish delivery on leg, Pandya backs away and mis-times a pull stroke. Got that out of the upper half of his bat. Straight to Axar who takes it casually"
"bowled im. Pollard is distraught. Fuller than a good length on off, the quicker delivery. Pollard goes for a massive heave but misses. Off stumps somersaults and Stoinis is pumped. Good bowling at a crucial time"
"full on middle, nudged to deep midwicket for a run"
"back of a length on off and middle, played away from the back foot"
"slower ball, out the back of the hand, and Southee holes out now. Was into his swipe too early, resulting in him miscuing his stroke. Skied straight to long-off, who took a good catch with his hands reverse cupped"
"first ball is dispatched. Short and wide, poor ball. Harbhajan thrashes a cut through point. Times it beauitfully"
"back of a length on off, Harbhajan hurries back but skews the ball to point"
"would have been out with a direct hit. Yorker outside off, MM hams it out towards short cover and calls for one. Mohit is quick on it and fires an inaccurate throw at the batsman's end"
"nicely played. Low full toss on off, McClenaghan gets low and just scoops the ball over short fine leg. Crucial runs"
"low full toss outside off, Harbhajan shuffles across, clears a foot and horribly mis-times his swipe to mid-off."
"yorker outside off, McClenaghan backs away, then goes towards the ball. Squeezes it back to the bowler"
"taken. McClenaghan holes out now. Fullish delivery outside off, McClenaghan runs to the ball and doesn't quite get under it. Carries to Miller at long-off who takes the catch diving low in front."
"low full toss outside off, swatted straight to long-on"
"good length outside off, karate-chopped to third man for a run. Done his job"

"good length on off, a deft dab to third man gets Harbhajan back on strike"
"another slower back of the hand slower ball confounds Bhajji. Fullish on leg, Harbhajan clears his front foot and defends"
"another one. Harbhajan is through the shot before Mohit has released it. Very slow on leg, Harbhajan misses a slog. The ball bounces over the stumps"
"gets it this time. Another slower delivery on off, Harbhajan backs away and swats it over midwicket. Miller backtracked and tried to palm it back into the field of play but could only get a hand on it. Carries over"
"superb. Speared in the blockhole on off, all Harbhajan can do is jam it out"
"full on off, skewed to long-on. Just one as Maxwell fields."
"a bit of extra bounce first up. Good length on leg, Vijay plays outside the line and the ball hit him high on the bat to fine leg"
"134 kph, strays down leg again. Not much movement. Worked to short fine leg. Amla calls 'yea', but Vijay retorts 'no'"
nice line. Good length on a fifth-stump line. Amla moves across in typical fashion to punch to cover
fullish line around off. Amla walks across and defends to cover
"a prodigious shuffle there. And as a result, he chooses the wrong shot. A short delivery outside off, very wide in fact. Amla walks across and chooses to pull but misses."
"gone. Amla has been given. Southee strikes. Superb bowling. Fuller than a good length on middle, a bit of inward movement. Amla walks across and misses a flick. The ball strikes him in front of middle, a little high but tht was more than likely hitting the stumps. Vital strike"
"stops in the wicket a touch. Shortish length outside off, Vijay drives away from his body. Is through the shot a tad early, uppishly travels to cover"
"131 kph, beaten. Good length outside off, some seam movement away from the bat. Vijay pokes and the ball swerves past the outside edge"

"nice bowling. Good length outside off, Saha stands tall to punch to point. Nice fielding"
"lovely timing. And that is hard to do on this sluggish surface. Rather full outside off, Saha times his drive beautifully. Finds the gap at cover too"
"loose. Not a pitch to drive on the up. Good length outside off, Vijay leaden-footed drives but the ball creeps under"
not a great delivery. Short on leg with fine leg up. Vijay pulls easily in the backward square leg region. Easily done
"in the gap again and four more. Too wide from McClenaghan. Vijay punches the back foot drive in the gap through extra cover. Timed it decently, well enough for four"

"lots of flight on middle, turned to midwicket"
"flat this time on middle, clipped to short fine leg. McClenaghan unnecessarily throws at the bowler's end to concede an overthrow. What was he doing?"
