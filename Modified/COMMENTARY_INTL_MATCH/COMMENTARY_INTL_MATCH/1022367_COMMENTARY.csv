"wayward start. No swing. Shortish delivery down leg, de Kock lets it go and earns a free run."
"good length delivery outside off, still no movement. Inside-edged towards square leg for a single."
"lovely delivery. Good length on off, not much movement so have to be straight. Amla defends under his eyes"
"and again. Accurate around off, a solid defensive stroke. Amla's head right over the ball."
"slightly wider outside off, seams back just a touch. Amla offers no stroke."
"fullish outside off, Amla comes forward and blocks into the off side. Pad very close to bat."
a genuine edge. But the lack of pace from Bhuvneshwar and Amla's Test-type soft hands means the ball goes right down. Past second slip's right for a run
"lovely start. On a length on off, still no swing or lateral movement of any kind. But the line is good enough to earn Amla's respect. Blocked"
"slightly wide, that should be a warning not to bowl there. Back of a length outside off, not even wide enough to cut but Amla executes a nice cut to square third man."
"good call of 'noo' from Amla. De Kock a bit tentative, a bit eager. Works one to square leg and sets off. The calm of Amla"
"136 kph. Back of a length on leg, de Kock misses a glance and is struck on the body. Ouch."
"full outside off, defended back towards mid-off"
"good end. Lovely over. Fullish delivery close to off, de Kock keeps it out. Cautious start from SA, as expected"
"good length outside off, punched from the back foot into the cover region."
"outside off, fuller than a good length and that brings Amla forward, blocks calmly into the off side"
misjudged run. He had to wait for just that fraction of a second more to see if it passed the bowler. Driven to Bhuvi's left. Kohli at mid-off is quick on it and throws off balance but misses the stumps because of that lack of control. <strong>Amla was gone by a mile</strong>
"strays down leg, another wide"
"the line is just a tad too straight to de Kock. With that strong bottom hand, he'll flick all day. Whips this through square leg"
"that's better. It's straight but angled away. Pitches on middle, moves towards off. De Kock is expecting that line, nudges to square leg"
"another calm flick down to fine leg for one. De Kock wanted two, but it ain't there. Sends Amla back"
straight. Elegant. India's plan has been not to give width. But their lengths have been wayward. This is overpitched and straight and de Kock drives straight back with the full face. Delectable hit
"slightly shorter down leg, some extra bounce and it takes the inside half of the bat to fine leg"
"almost rolled back. Good length delivery down leg, Amla pulls but it isn't short enough. Lobs up off his thigh pad, he isn't aware so he cowers over the stumps like he was protecting the stumps from precipitation. The ball trickles past alongside"
"back of a length outside off, punched to mid-off from the back foot"
"that's nicely played. On the pads, worked to wide mid-on for a single. That's Amla strength, manufacturing singles from good balls"
"too straight again, easy run. De Kock nudges down to fine leg"
"that's a better length. Around off, no room, not full, not short. Pushed to mid-off"
"runs says the umpire. Full down leg, off the pad or bat past fine leg. Easy runs. This isn't an attacking line."
"way too straight for a man with a strong bottom hand. Back of a length on middle, nudged down to fine leg."
"that's better. 140 kph, good length outside off. Amla is happy to stay on the back foot and punch, but finds extra cover."
"quite tight outside off, scythed towards point. Jadeja is quick on it"
"nice end. Back of a length outside off, hit up towards mid-off. The line to Amla has been good, not to de Kock"
"that's the first short and wide delivery. De Kock laces a cut straight to backward point. Hmm, missed four there"
"oh superb. Keep the next four balls there. Fuller than a good length, honing in on that off bail. Defended towards cover"
"on middle and leg, clipped to Yuvraj at square leg who sloppily misfields. De Kock wants to take advantage and Amla tells de Kock to chill by sending him back. Quick recovery from Yuvraj"
"fullish on middle and leg, de Kock's strong bottom hand takes a normal drive to mid-on to wide mid-on. Such fine margins and there's one"
"wow. Shot of the day. Back of a length outside off, wasn't short enough to cut. So he didn't cut. Instead, he brings his bat down at a different angle and punches a drive. Cuts out the risk of an edge and finds the gap through point. Typical Amla quality"
"good length outside off, punched on the up towards cover"
"back of a length on middle and leg, pulled to fine leg."
"lovely. Good length outside off, dabbed away to third man"
"good length on a fourth-stump line, shovelled to mid-on from the back foot. Ugly skew"
"short outside off, wrong shot selection. It sits up to be cut but de Kock was anticipating that straight line so he chooses to pull. but the ball goes past. Nice lines"
"138 kph, another ugly stroke. Just a little bit of lateral movement. De Kock wanted to drive, but the ball moves off the pitch with some angle. De Kock's feet are nowhere, rooted to the crease and the ball goes past"
"this is just a good delivery. On a length outside off, and moves away after pitching. De Kock is beaten. No shame, stick it out. ."
"walks right across. Wants to put him off his line and length. Back of a length outside off, Amla walks across and pulls down to fine leg"
"fullish outside off, fourth-stump line. 145 kph, driven to mid-on. Again that bottom hand taking it wider than it should have gone"
"excellent lines. Good length outside off, de Kock blocks towards point"
"fullish delivery down leg, off the pad towards fine leg. Pitching outside leg. Shuffled right across. One leg bye to fine leg"
"a low full toss outside off, 142 kph, Amla wants to play straight so he misses out on a full toss. Beaten by pace as he taps one to mid-on"
"a slower delivery outside off, driven to mid-off"
walks across onto off stump to drag a short delivery through midwicket.
"<b>through him</b>! There is seam off the pitch - even if it is a used one - and Bhuvi is finding it. Hitting the deck, seam upright, on off stump and cuts in sharply to sneak through bat and pad as Amla wafts at the ball with no feet"
"now he leaps from his stance from leg stump out to way outside off to whip a good length ball outside off through midwicket. All that happens, however, is the ball takes the pad and wanders out to point. Sensational length bowling from India. Nothing to drive, nothing to flat bat"
"slower ball, and de Kock is moved to sweep the ball, getting an inside edge to short fine leg. Good stop from Bumrah, diving to his left"
blocks a back of a length delivery on off stump
defends a good length ball coming in towards the top of off stump
"straight on middle and leg, no turn. Worked to square leg"
manufactures room by just nimble footwork and punches a straight delivery but picks out cover
"flat down leg this time, clipped to square leg. Tidy start from Ashwin"
"flat and quick, aware that this is still the Powerp;lay. Good defensive bowling. Punched towards mid-on, midwicket gets across"
drifts down leg for a wide
"lovely. Flight on off, but the length is not full. Amla thinks of hitting that but defends"
"the carrom ball to finish. Flat and wide outside off, moves away. Amla tries to execute a punch through cover with zero footwork. Misses."
"131 kph, length on middle and off, de Kock misses a flick. Beaten on the outside edge. May have played the wrong line. Off the pad towards third man"
"that's short. A bumper on leg, pulled down to fine leg for a run"
"tight run especially to Jadeja but that's well-judged. It earns SA an extra. On a length on off, dabbed to point. Jadeja runs in late, and hurls a throw at the batsman's end. Misses and concedes an extra"
"a bit straight, clipped to fine leg"
"fullish delivery outside off, dabbed to third man for a single. Pretty effective batting, can make up the scoring later"
"135 kph, fourth-stump line outside off, chopped back up the pitch. Amla sends de Kock back"
"quick on the pads, defensive bowling. Worked to deep midwicket"
"fullish delivery outside off, pushed towards mid-off. Not hit too hard but the ball gets past Ashwin. Can think of a few who would have stopped one"
"flat down leg, swept down to fine leg"
"quicker through the air, on the pads. Nudged to midwicket"
"drifted on, skidded on with the arm. An indication that the ball isn't turning. Offbreak on off, slow. De Kock somehow carves a cut to point. Tried to play off the pitch"
"and tries too much. Spoils a good over with tripe. Round-arm action, short down leg and de Kock helps himself to four with a pull past short fine leg"
"fullish and wide outside off, Amla mis-times a leaden-footed drive to mid-off. No timing at all. Maybe this surface is a tad two-paced"
"on the pads, Amla manufactures something by walking across off. Clips to midwicket. Unfortunate"
"short and very wide outside off, Amla thinks of playing an upper cut but is wary of chipping a catch to third man so decides not to chase it"
"this is terrific bowling. Fullish delivery outside off, skewed towards midwicket for a run. Looking to hit that hard"
"good single, or was it? Driven to Kohli at mid-off, who gets across, picks up and under-arms a throw that misses the bowler's end by a few inches. Yikes, out with time to spare."
"<strong>and dropped</strong>. By Pandya's standards, that should have been taken. A full delivery outside off, pushed back to Pandya in his follow-through. Not too hard, maybe didn't know he had so much time. the ball bursts through the hands"
"overpitched outside off, jammed out"
on the pads this time and de Kock finds midwicket. pressure building
"lovely, That's three good deliveries. Flat on off, played back into the body"
"overpitched on leg, pushed away to long-on. Good from de Kock, didn't lose his head after dot balls"
"well bowled. Sees Amla coming and fires it on middle and off, worked to square leg"
"nice end. Full and straight, no room. No experimentation off the last ball. De Kock can do nothing but defend"
"that's massive. Gets right across outside off, converts a full delivery into  a leg side offering and then flicks the ball waaay over square leg. Picks the short boundary, terrific batting"
"shortish on middle, Amla misses a pull. Struck on the body towards third man"
"good length outside off, carved away to backward point. Dot"
"another dot ball. Slower ball outside off, dabbed to backward point. Amla calls yes, but de Kock sends him back. Excellent call from de Kock"
"does it again. Wanted the same result, six over square leg but got right across and flicks to fine leg. Not enough bat on that but he plays with big margins and gets it."
"a slower ball on off, yorker. Jammed out"
"a risky cut. Flat on off, no turn. de Kock cuts to point. Out if he missed, but he didn't"
"quicker, no flight, outside off. Pushed towards cover from the back foot."
"tossed up outside off, chopped towards cover. More signs of a slow surface"
gets down and drives to long-on. Pretty good batting
"flat outside off, nudged to square leg"
nice batting. Gets to the pitch and drives calmly to long-off. Nicely done
"on the pads to start, nudged to square leg. This is defensive bowling"
"flat outside off, punched to the sweeper cover. More fluency in gap finding. Amla's strength in middle overs is to find gaps"
"on the pads again, another simple flick earns de Kock one through midwicket"
"flat outside off, punched again off the back foot to deep point. No turn for Jadeja"
"a reverse paddle. Flat outside off, swept to third man. Nicely executed but finds the fielder"
"worked to midwicket. Flat, quick and straight, Jadeja's usual modus operandi. Good end"
"quick and flat down leg, no turn. Amla gets inside the line and lets it go. Wide"
"nicely hit. That's the difference between quality batsmen. Normally, batsmen choose to go over mid-off, but Amla decides to go wide of mid-off. To his right. Because if he mis-timed it, it would have been a very hard catch"
"flight on off, defended"
"and a wicket. Ashwin strikes. Flat and wide outside off, the ball skids on and Amla is slightly late in his cut. Gets a thick edge and a pretty significant deflection. Dhoni stands his ground, gets his gloves in an excellent position and takes a lovely catch. Quickened up off the surface there. Decent knock from Amla, set a strong platform for SA"
"pretty full on the stumps, pushes it down to long-on easily"
"bit of drift down the leg side, he tries to steer it to leg but misses. That was a stumping chance actually, but Dhoni could not collect the ball the first time"
"slightly full outside off now, de Kock gently pushes it into the covers"
"slightly full outside off, steered towards cover point for one"
"unleashes the reverse sweep as Jadeja comes over the wicket, towards third man for one"
"good length outside off, he punches it through extra cover for one more"
waits for the ball to turn in a bit and cuts it late behind square

"slightly fuller this time outside off, driven into the covers this time and he keeps strike"
"turning into the batsman from length, he flicks it through midwicket for one"
full on the pads and de Kock cashes in. It was towards the leg stump as he erred in line and QdK flicked it away to the right of deep square leg for four
"imparts more air this time outside off, he drives it with the turn to cover"
"some flight to du Plessis this time, du Plessis works it with the turn square of the wicket and comes back quickly for the second. He had to hurry and made it back since Jadhav didn't get a direct hit"
"outside leg now, almost on the pads, du Plessis digs it out to midwicket"
"down the leg side, the batsman leaves but loses his balance momentarily. No danger though"
"ends the over with a fuller one outside off, it's pushed into cover for one"
"short and wide outside off, Faf stays back and steers it to sweeper cover easily"
"short to de Kock too, going towards the leg side, he nudges it behind square for one"

"full and outside leg, he flicks and finds midwicket"
"touch shorter, he tucks it to the leg side and gets one towards square leg"
"fuller on off, a bit of room, and he taps it to backward point for single"
"swing and a miss! Starts the new spell with a scrambled seam on length around the fifth stump, Faf chases it without much footwork and misses"
wayward line now - down the leg side for a wide
"much closer to the off stump, on back of length, he dabs it to third man for one"

"little bit of width outside off, de Kock waits and cuts straight to backward point"
slightly full on the pads and de Kock flicks it away to deep square leg for two
"on the move to the full delivery on outside leg again, flicked away as he often does for one more"
"on middle and leg, gently pushes it to long-on for one"
"short and wide this time, there's room and he frees his arms to flay it to the right of deep cover point. Enough time to come back for the second"
"takes a step down to take the ball on the full, pushes the ball to off and they sneak in a quick single"
"full and outside off, drilled to cover but he finds Kohli"
"short and flat just outside off, Faf hangs back and he cuts it to deep point"
"quicker one towards off and middle, he tucks it behind square on leg and wants one but is sent back by du Plessis"
"bangs it in short outside off, du Plessis pulls it and gets one towards deep midwicket"
"that's <strong>fifty</strong> for de Kock, he has scored again against India. Saw the short ball well outside off and cut it off the back foot to deep point for one"
he also waits on the back foot and taps the short ball late to third man
"finds the gap through the covers with a lovely drive, it was a full ball. Didn't have enough power though so Dhawan runs to his left from deep cover to keep it to two"
"short ball, de Kock cuts nicely but there's Jadeja! He dives to his left, running from short third man and keeps it to one"
"on length outside off, du Plessis defends carefully on the off side"
"loud appeal for lbw as de Kock tries the reverse sweep and he almost missed it, but got glove on the pad so not out straightaway"
"there's the breakthrough from Jadeja! De Kock went for the orthodox this time for a ball that was quicker and well outside off, it turned it a little, went under de Kock's bat and found the off stump"
gets a length delivery outside off and he drives it nicely to sweeper cover to get off the mark straghtaway
"similar delivery outside off, driven into the covers again, for one this time"
"not as much room for Faf, he goes back a bit and steers it on the off side"
"slightly fuller, he goes back and punches it on the up to point"
"too full outside off, AB drives that nicely through the covers from the middle of the bat, just to the left of Kohli at cover, all the way for four"
"slightly shorter outside off, taps it down to third man now"
"strays in line to Faf, it's going towards the leg side and du Plessis tickles it towards fine leg with a delicate touch"
"cuts on the up as it was shorter, but it was in the gap, to the right of backward point, and he gets one"
"bangs in the bouncer outside off, AB lets it go and it's called a wide"
"short ball again outside off, AB hops to get on top of the ball and cuts it awkwardly and finds point"
"dances down the track now and slaps it from near shoulder height, it was short again, to the left of sweeper cover for one"
steps forward to drill a flighted delivery down to long-on
"flatter delivery, slices to cover point"
"hangs back to slap a flatter delivery past Jadeja's left, but he gets a hand to it and that helps extra cover keep it to a dot"
"<b>squares him up</b> with turn! This pitch is forecast as dry, and so there might be something for the spinners. Jadeja finds it as du Plessis setting up to flick, has to adjust and block and in the end gets an outside edge to short third man"
""
"flighted, but bowled quickly again, du Plessis hits it back whence it came"
"allows the short delivery to come on and then knocks it on its head to third man. Easy, peasy, lemon squeezey"
"spears in a yorker and nearly takes du Plessis off his feet! Credit to the batsman, though, that he is able to bring down a straight bat and nick a single to mid-on"
understands the pace of most pitches so quickly does AB. Taps the shortish delivery to deep point
they take on Jadeja! And survive to tell the tale! South Africa not backing down. du Plessis here nudges the ball soft enough that even India's best has no chance to make the run-out at the non-strikers
"stays back, and leg side of the ball, knowing India are hitting back of a length, with third man on the boundary. All AB needs to do is play traffic cop with the open bat face"
"again, lovely. The second he picks up the length as short, he leaps up, shifts his body weight leg side, gets the arms up, angles the bat and finds the single to third man"
pushes it into the covers for an easy single
"AB might be run-out here! Yep. Hardik's throw comes on time and Dhoni does the rest. South Africa's Superman put in the dive, looking very much like his nickname, but he wasn't quick enough this time. Not really a single there, but he responds to du Plessis looking up after patting the ball towards point. Hardik swoops in and sends a rocket throw right beside the stumps"
"tosses it up outside off, drives towards mid-off"
comes down the track and works it past midwicket's left
gets to the pitch of a loopy delivery on middle and clips it to wide long-on
"good length ball on off stump, blocks"
"and someone's gone! <b>Both batsmen at the same end</b>, and the third umpire has to come in to adjudicate which one of them is out. Early signs are that Miller should be run-out. What a waste. South Africa bottling things up after withstanding to pressure so well. So how did this mess happen? Well, it begins with a quicker delivery that doesn't turn. And because of that du Plessis making room to cut gets an outside edge to short third man. He sets off, then hesitates, then sets off again, and du Plessis going a second time gives Miller the go ahead to run as hard as he needs to. Only problem is by that time du Plessis again changes his mind and dives back into his batting crease, before Miller makes it. The throw, such a poor one aimed at the batsman's end, fortuitously ends up at the bowlers. Kohli collects it and breaks the stumps to seal the absolute mess."
"tosses it up on leg stump, works it behind square leg"
"flighted delivery outside off, steers to deep point"
"more chaos between the wickets! Duminy pats it to short cover and runs, du Plessis responds and has to put in the full-length dive to save himself"
clips the legspinner to short midwicket
dabs it off his thighs to fine leg
eases it down to long-off
"huge appeal for lbw, it's given, but  Duminy goes for a <b>review</b> straight away, seems to suggest he's hit it and yes, there's some glove before the ball hits pad. The batsman playing a lap sweep survives"
steps down the track and works it past midwicket's right
"full and wide outside off, slaps it to cover point"
"short delivery on off stump, du Plessis punches to mid-off"
"drives to the right of point, reaching out to the good length ball."
"the full delivery doens't seem to come on, and du Plessis has to take his bottom hand off his bat as he drives to mid-off"
"opens the face against the good length ball on off stump, defends"
goes for his go-to delivery - the bouncer - but it strays credulity in terms of height. Punished by the ump
moves across to work a short delivery off his hips to deep square leg
gets up off his feet to tap the shortish delivery down into the midwicket region for a quick run
goes off his toes to block a shortish delivery on off stump to short cover
works a shortish delivery to long leg

"nudges a slow, tossed up delivery on off stump to short midwicket"
"pushes to short midwicket, off the back foot this time."
"good length ball outside off, opens the face and steers it to deep third man"
pushes a length ball down to long-off
run off the stumps to deep third man off the open face
"tries to pierce the gap square on the off side, but Hardik's line, nice and tight on off stump does not allow him to do so"
too short and that allows Duminy the time he needs to control the glide better. Picks the gap behind point
"beautiful bowling! No more can you say Hardik's a blind hit-the-deck-get-flogged bowler. Out comes the slower ball, understanding that South Africa, at this point, only dare to use the pace of the bowler, and not set the pace themselves. So he sneaks in the slower ball. The offcutter, on and around off stump. It completely deceives the batsman. Du Plessis, who has been hanging on the back foot, has to come forward, but his balance is off. He throws his hands at the ball, gets an inside edge and hears that ungodly rattle behind him"
"full on off stump, drives to short cover"
"digs it in on off stump, Morris steers it to point"
works a shortish delivery off his hips to deep square leg
"down the track for a push down the pitch, but Jadeja intercepts it and then sneakily flicks it back onto the stumps at the bowler's end. <b>Appeal for a run-out</b> but Morris, has not backed up so far that he is in danger. Turns around, grounds his bat and heaves a sigh of relief"
taps a shortish delivery on off stump to point
down the track for a flick to long-on
"width on offer, Morris clears his front leg and lashes it past short cover's left"
moves back to a length ball to try and work with the turn behind square leg. No luck
pushes at a full delivery outside off into the covers
beaten outside the off stump as Hardik angles a good length ball across the left-hander. Bowling to his field. Bowling to his slip
"fuller delivery on off stump, blocks"
"ooh, the deflection off Hardik's boot takes the pace off the drive and positions the ball right between mid-on and mid-off, allowing the single"
"back of a length and outside off, guides it to point"
opens the face and runs the short ball down to third man
"looks for the blockhole, on leg stump, not giving the big-hitter room. Morris pushes it to mid-on"
"back of a length and down leg, Duminy fails to connect his flick"
blocks a shortish delivery to point. Three men up in the circle on the off side. two on the leg side. There's a slip as well. It's the 37th over.
clips a good length ball on middle past midwicket
"full toss on off stump, pushes it to mid-off"
"top edge and it's taken by square leg. South Africa continue to self-destruct. Who's let Dee Dee near the red button?! (Sorry to those who've never watched Dexter's Lab). Right, onto describing things. It's a short ball, on off stump, Morris takes it on with a big heave. But he has no room to play the pull and the lesson of what happens to a batsman when he plays that shot regardless will be etched into his mind forever"
"good length ball on middle, clips to short midwicket"
"short and wide, Duminy cuts but picks out point"
"<b>indecision with the running again</b>, possibly because the fielder is Jadeja. He moves swiftly to his left, it's his strong side, that's why Duminy hesitates at the non-strikers. He says yes to the run just in time for Phehlukwayo to make his ground"
"back of a length and outside off, left alone. That is what South Africa are reduced to. Playing no shots in the 38th over"
"fuller delivery on off stump, defends"
"slower ball, on a length and outside off, Duminy tries to cut and mistimes the shot"
"back of a length and outside off, lashes it past point's left"
"back of a length and outside off, punches to point"
"a shade short, and just wide enough for Duminy to cut. Gets a thick outside edge over the slip fielder. First boundary in more than 10 overs"
"loops it up, and gets it to dip. Duminy, going for the drive, has to reach for it and mistimes the shot to point. Phehlukwayo looks for the single, but is sent back"
drives through the covers
gets nicely forward on leg stump and blocks the tossed up delivery
blocks a length ball that gets some grip off the surface.
gets inside the line of a flighted delivery on off stump and drives to long-off. He's a pretty decent batter. Pretty sound hitter too. South Africa can get 250 plus if these two stay on
slaps the short ball to the sweeper cover
"back of a length and outside off, guides it to deep third man"
seems to have straightened just enough off the pitch that a punch meant to go through mid-off ends up as an inside edge to square leg
"full on off stump, blocks"
"sweet shot, but straight to short cover. Lovely full face of the bat from Phehlukwayo."
now he opens the face enough to beat the man at short cover. Good batting. Simple shots.
"whew, that's mighty close. And Kohli asks Dhoni, then Bumrah, <b>then chooses to review.</b> All this needs to do is hit Phehlukwayo in line. It was a low full toss, straight, and definitely hitting the stumps. Phehlukwayo misses the full toss and is truck in line, the ball goes on to hit the stumps and SA slump further. He has missed a straight full toss. Umpire Reiffel somehow missed that one"
"lovely start. A bouncer, well directed too. Back of a length and straight, Rabada gets away from the line"
"full and straight again, defended towards cover"
"superb yorker, quick but just misses his length. Defended towards mid-off"
"lovely stroke. Back of a length down leg, pulled beautifully behind square. Looked like a top-order batsman"
"fullish down leg, nudged to midwicket"
"overpitched, a yorker on leg, played away"
"flat and wide outside off, cut away towards point"
"flat on leg, no turn. Beats the bat and strikes Duminy on the pad but sliding down. An optimistic appeal"
"lovely stop from Jadeja. Short and wide outside off, cut to point where Jadeja dives to his left"
driven with the spin to long-off
punched off the back foot to long-on
"good length outside off, chopped into the ground towards point."
"edged and taken. Rabada goes. Bhuvneshwar strikes. Impeccable line and length from Bhuvneshwar. Hits a good length, pitches on middle, seams away late. Takes the outside edge and Dhoni dives forward to complete the catch. Just enough lateral movement. More would have beat the edge, less would have hit the middle."
one more. It's all falling apart for South Africa. Great length this. Back of a length on the fourth-stump channel. The No. 10 batsman looks to drive with his bat well away from the body. Gets a thick outside edge and carries to a wide slip where Kohli takes a good catch to his left. Two in two.
"wanted to smash that into Lord's. Shortish and wide, slashed down to third man for a run"
"down leg and Duminy takes full toll. Short on the pads, off the glove or a bit of thigh pad, past Dhoni's right and into the boundary"
"beaten on the outside edge. Fullish outside off, Duminy tries to run this down to third man but misses"
"strays down leg, wide"
"a low full toss on off, pushed away towards cover"
a nicely-directed bouncer on middle. Tahir gets underneath that
"a slower ball down leg, Tahir defends. Watchfully."
"oh that's pretty good. Full and straight from Bumrah, blocked back"
"a low full toss on middle, driven to mid-off. Tahir wants one, but Duminy asks him what's he thinking"
"capable defensive technique. Full and straight again, kept out"
"refuses the run. Rightly so. Back of a length outside off, comes down and slaps a swat to long-off"
"full and straight, inside-edged into the body."
"swung away. What is happening. Is that another run-out? There was a misfield. Tahir is run-out by a distance and South Africa are all out. Back of a length on leg, pulled to deep midwicket. Duminy wants two, but Tahir sends him back. After the misfield though, Tahir calls him through. But by then, the throw is already in and Duminy won't be able to make it. So he sends Tahir back, who dives but Dhoni takes the bails off in time."
"back of a length and outside off, no shot from Rohit"
"back of a length, the ball straightening just enough to square Rohit up as he defends"
"pitches it up on off stump, the ball travels a straight line to the middle of the bat. <s>Traitor, Rabada yells</s>."
"there we go, that's more like it. The seam up delivery hits the deck and rips away off the pitch leaving Rohit and his outside edge behind"
good carry through to the keeper as Rohit leaves the good length ball at 134 kph outside off
"opens the face, to play with the slight movement away. Soft hands keep the short ball down to point"
"starts on the pads and Dhawan, who does get the flick off his pads away more often than not, returns to a place when playing leg side was a weakness. No bat. All thigh"
"he gave up! Called for the quick single and then gave up, giving Miller at cover a free sight of the stumps. Gathers the ball, takes aim, has all the time in the world, but he misses. So the good length ball of off stump gets no reward. Someone's gonna hear about this!"
"fuller delivery on off stump, blocks"
"pushes to mid-on, but with no great pace"
"gets a thick outside edge to deep third man, but it went straight to ground with Rohit using soft hands"
"squares him up with a full delivery on leg stump, making it move away off the pitch. Dhawan stops himself from flicking and twists his body around to present a straighter bat"
"fluent hit into the covers, where Miller dives to his right to stop the ball going too far. Sublime shot goes to waste"
"thats ridiculously good! Bangs the ball into the deck in the corridor of uncertainty, inviting the outside edge to a party. It is tempted, but doesn't stray. Rohit's lucky"
"back of a length on middle, blocks"
<B>bounce</b>! There's so much of it! Where does it come from? Rabada just ambles up to the crease. The definition of a natural athelete as he hits the deck and makes the ball leap over the cutting Rohit's bat
"that's gorgeous! He knows his strengths so well. He trusts them fully and that means if you pitch up to him, in his arc, the straight drive comes out and the timing on it is out of this world"
"so the bowler's response is a short ball, a poor one because it doesn't rise up to the level that would make a batsman panic. Rohit is on his front foot, no less, when he pulls over deep midwicket"
"fuller delivery on off stump, defends"
"shortish on middle, Dhawan gets an inside edge towards short midwicket"
"full and outside off, drills it to mid-off"
picks it up and gives it a good home among his supporters at deep square leg. The crowd goes wild as Dhawan channels his inner Jayasuriya. Sweet as.
"defends a shortish delivery, hopping in line with it and finding the ball doesn't come on to him as he thought."
brings down a straight bat on the shortish delivery on off stump. Soft hands
lines up beside a shortish delivery on off stump and runs it to cover point
"quick single, well taken, for Rohit was on the front foot, already on the move, as he pushes the ball to the left of mid-off"
"shortish and outside off, chops to point"
"goes on the bounce to long leg and the fielder over-runs the ball which darts behind him to the boundary. Phehlukwayo was the man racing to his left, trying to catch a mistimed hook from Dhawan. Tough luck, his momentum was always taking him away"
defends a good length ball on off stump
glides a shortish delivery to point
"looks for the bouncer, making the ball rise over Rohit's left shoulder. The batsman hooks and misses"
"full on off stump, Rohit is reaching out to flick, the ball comes on slowly and it pops out, in the air for just a tiny bit, towards short midwicket"
"that's needless - so for this match, par for the course. Rohit moves leg side, well before the bowler lets it go, Morkel has the chance to follow him with a good length ball. The batsman looks to launch it down to Cardiff, just in case the teams there don't have enough balls, but in the end he nicks off to the keeper"
"gets the easiest ball ever, on the pads, and flicks to deep square leg"
"good length ball, defends towards short midwicket, and because Kohli is out there, he looks for a quick single that really isn't there"
pushes a length ball on off stump to point
"shortish delivery on off stump, Kohli hops behind the line"
"waits on the shortish delivery, plays it close to his body and guides to backward point"
nudges a shortish delivery towards mid-on. He's batting out of his crease to a man capable of bowling 150 kph
"good ball, in the channel outside off, on a good length, asking for that airy-fairy drive from Kohli. He doesn't oblige"
walks at a short delivery at 140 kph and slices it to gully
"fuller delivery outside off, he leaves"
"nice and tight on off stump, Dhawan defends with both feet off the ground in order to get on top of the ball"
ensures his front leg doesn't get in the way of a flick to square leg. Rare fuller ball from South Africa
"full and wide, Dhawan should ideally kick himself into another dimension for picking the cover fielder. Instead, he'll bat on"
"full and outside off, heaves it towards leg, mistimes to mid-on"
"shortish and outside off, runs it to point"
"<b>ripper</b> to wrap up the maiden. It starts with hitting the pitch hard, then darts away past the outside edge of the defending Dhawan. One spicy meatball, that."
defends a shade inside the line of a back of a length delivery that seems to straighten just a tad
"shortish on off stump, pushes it down to mid-on"
moves across onto off stump and guides the shortish delivery to gully
"blocks to the right of short cover, and races off to the other end. Good batting. The field is strong square, so he hits straighter"
opens the face and runs a good length ball down to third man
lets the 141 kph short ball come on and steers it to gully
"full on off stump, pushes to mid-off"
"good shot. He steps forward to the full delivery and cracks it to the left of mid-off. AB stands wide there, perhaps to adjust to Dhawan's strength through the covers"
"uppish, but he pierces the gap between the catchers at cover. Risky shot, but Dhawan backs himself with this shot. He loves this shot. Gets a lot of runs with it. Add four more in his column, please."
"shortish on off stump, blocks"
"back of a length on off stump, defends. Oh, hello, Morkel's overstepped. We've got a free hit!"
"looks for the wide yorker, becomes a full toss, and it's lashed over point. See, that's why you can't look for yorkers this early. It's too hard a ball and there is very little protection in case it goes wrong"
"back of a length and outside off, left alone"
"shortish and outside off, steers it to point"
a touch fuller and it brings Kohli on the front foot. At which point the pitch decides to give Rabada a little more bounce. The ball hits the splice of the defensive bat
"walks across, made to do so by Rabada's incredible, but in this case predictable line, and finds a single at long leg"
"shortish on off stump, dabs it to cover"
"on the pads and Dhawan whips it to long leg for not one but two, good running"
"slower ball, pitching outside leg, Dhawan attempts the flick but doesn't get bat to it. Kohli yanks him across for a quick single and makes his ground despite a direct hit from a diving short midwicket"
"punches a fuller delivery right through point - misfield allows three! Dhawan was not keen on the run originally, seeing Miller move to his right, but once the ball missed his hands, he was gung ho"
"races down the track and is beaten on the inside edge! Lucky (his middle name, I'm serious) is unlucky not to get the Indian captain playing on"
"on middle and off, clips the good length ball through wide mid-on"
"fuller delivery on off stump, defends"
walks down and across the pitch for a slower delivery on off stump. That lack of pace means the drive on the up becomes an inside edge through square leg
drills a shortish delivery to mid-off
"moving across outside off, preempting the line outside off, Kohli is given a full delivery to spirit away to deep midwicket. Damn those wrists are powerful"
"goes shorter, meaning Kohli has only a glide, or the leave along, as options outside off. The glide finds gully"
"back of a length, just outside off, coming back in to take Kohli's inside edge"
gets up tall behind the back of a length ball outside off. Punch towards mid-on. Kohli now 8 off 23. Will his patience win out?
"<b>just short of long leg</b>. Kohli thinks he has a release shot when he sees the ball banged in. Swivels on the pull, hits it in the air and Morkel, racing forward, diving forward, nearly pulls of a blinder."
defends a short ball on middle and leg
"that's outstanding! Can't fault the ball, it was good length on off stump, but because Kohli perceives Phehlukwayo isn't as fast as the others, he walks down the pitch, hits on the up and launches it over mid-off"
lunges outside off and drills the good length ball through the covers
"more good cricket. He is on the back foot as he pushes down the ground, but since he has placed it to the left of mid-off, he knows there is a single"
"shortish and in the corridor, Kohli plays that dinky shot to third man, could easily have played on. Instead the ball goes to gully. The shot will only get him one. But he keeps playing it"
"walks at the bowler again, and this time Phehlukwayo shortens his length and makes sure Kohli doesn't have the room to free the arms. Steer to gully results"
blocks a fuller delivery to the right of gully
"shortish and outside off, chops past point"
"fine shot! Nothing more than an extension of defence, and an infusion of his bottom handed strength. And boy didn't the overpitched ball race away to the long-on boundary"
"short ball slides down leg, India sign as Kohli misses a flick, but chunter as they collect the extra"
whippage! He walks across to the fuller ball outside off and directs it to mid-on. De Villiers is good enough to stop it at mid-on
"opens the face against the short ball and finds gully. Kohli yells in frustration and grins with mischief. He knows with no third man, and with him getting into better form, South Africa are running a risk"
blocks a good length ball past gully's right for a single to backward point
"bangs it in short and down leg, Dhawan looks to hook but isn't quick enough"
"shortish and outside off, mistimes the punch to point"
"gets the indipper working again and he beats Kohli, who is, admittedly, a touch loose. He walks across, trying to hit into the leg side, and the gap between bat and pad is yawning"
"<b>dropped</b> but this is a seriously tough grab! Kohli's weakness dogs him again, regardless of time spent at the crease. He covers the line of deliveries just outside off, but when it's wider, when it's juicier, he can't help himself. Throws his hands at the ball, thick outside edge results. Amla the slipper dives low to his right, one hand out, can't hold on"
pushes to mid-on
races down the pitch and mistimes the slash through cover. The resulting inside edge goes to midwicket
"full on off stump - and it will go for a lot more because of a misfield at mid-on. Sweet shot though, Kohli moving across onto off stump, head over the ball as he flicks to the right of Morkel, who doesn't dive in time."
"starts with a short ball that Kohli punches to long-on. Valiant move to his left and a big dive too from du Plessis at midwicket, but he really wasn't in play"
"quicker and flatter on off stump, defends"
"good line. He tosses it up, gets it to drift a shade towards off stump. Dhawan is uncertain as he comes forward and then blocks to short midwicket"
"super shot. He picks the ball on length, gets under it, and sweeps to the square leg boundary. There's no man there, the boundary rider is at midwicket"
shortish and outside off - might have been the googly - Dhawan picks it and runs it to short third man
"<b>appeal for a stumping</b> but on first sight, Dhawan had his back foot back. The fun all starts with another ball that Tahir spins the wrong way. It zips past the left-hander's outside edge as he reaches out to block. Good on him, though, that after being soundly beaten, he makes sure not to be stumped"
"Kohli comes running at Phehlukwayo, gets a full delivery that he skews to square leg"
"shimmies down again, and drives elegantly at cover. Another dot. But that's good from Kohli. In the face of the bowler"
"a short delivery down leg, pulled to fine leg for a run. Hurried for pace"
"a slower delivery outside off, chopped towards cover."
"<b>lands just in front of mid-on</b>. Morkel sprinted forward but the luck is with India. A good short ball on leg, pulled to mid-on. Dhawan hurried for pace again."
"slower delivery outside off, hit back up the pitch"
"tossed up outside off, driven to cover"
"a googly outside off, Kohli goes back, reads it comfortably and pushes to midwicket"
"not many batsmen have read Tahir, but Kohli is so comfortable. Tossed up on middle, another googly, whipped through square leg"
"that's rubbish. often happens with legspinners. Short on middle and leg, a long hop and Dhawan helps himself, puts it away behind square."
"beautiful batting. This is short and very wide, slashed in front of point. Placed to perfection. Timing great. Owning Tahir"
"flat on off, defended"
"overpitched outside off, crisply driven to cover. Such good timing"
"lovely running. A yorker on middle, jammed away to mid-on. Kohli calls immediately and makes it comfortably"
"shortish, not exactly wide, but there is some width. Slashed to the keeper. Inside edge"
"another slower ball outside off, carved towards point"
"smashed. Don't bowl there. Short and wide outside off, hammered through point. No chance. He's so strong there."
"shortish outside off, pulled to mid-on. Dragged that pull from there"
"fullish delivery outside off, chopped towards point"
"lovely run. Back of a length outside off, played down towards the keeper. Dhawan calls for one and gets there. Nicely done"
"a thick edge into the pads. Full and straight, thick edge into the pad and then towards square leg"
"just over backward point and that'll be four more. Overpitched outside off, so the shot was there to be played. Slices off the outside half, over point and to the boundary. Nothing going SA's way"
"this is through second slip. There is no second slip. Good length delivery outside off, dabbed past Amla. Intentionally opened the face. No third man either"
"good length delivery outside off, guided to gully. Dot this time"
"short and wide this time, cut to point"
"fullish outside off, dabbed away towards gully"
"full outside off, mis-timed into the off side. Dhawan and Kohli both respond positively to the possibility of a run and make it easily"
lovely timing. Just a push races to mid-off. A defensive block off  a fullish delivery
"tries to swat this away but it's too short. A bouncer on middle, Kohli fails to get anything on his pull"
"back of a length down leg, nudged to fine leg"
"back of a length delivery on off, Kohli pops one towards square leg. Extra bounce"
"too straight from Morkel. Driven away to midwicket, a wristy flick"
"superb. A tad straight, on off, maybe even off, but Kohli just brings his bat down at a different angle and picks the gap this time, Wide of midwicket. Wow"
""
"another one. On the other side of the field. Full outside off, Kohli drills a lovely drive through cover. Just timing on that. Awesome"
"good length outside off, played towards gully"
"shortish and wide outside off, Dhawan somehow misses a cut"
"fullish and wide outside off, driven towards mid-off"
"over mid-on for four. Full delivery outside off, Dhawan gets underneath that and lifts the ball over mid-on, who is very short. Dhawan's fifty too, his fine form continues"
driven into the off side. Another dot.
"just a tad short on off, pulled to deep square leg"
"slightly too full, on off. Pushed away towards mid-off. Nicely played by Kohli, all control"
"starts with a leg side delivery. On the pads, Dhawan misses, clips the thigh pad on the way to fine leg for a couple."
"good line. Close to off, played towards point. A loud call of 'no' but an overthrow allows them one"
"good length delivery outside off, defended towards point. High elbow"
"a good length delivery outside off, chopped towards gully. Decent lines, but all too little"
"fullish outside off, another solid block. gets on the front foot to defend"
"back of a length outside off, Kohli gets high in the crease to play towards midiwcket. Lovely batting"
"more tight lines. Good length around off, honing in on that off bail. Worked into the leg side"
"beautiful stroke. Just on off, but Kohli nudges this wide of mid-on for a run. So simple"
"picks up the length early and goes boom. Full delivery outside off, Dhawan swats this over midwicket for four. Nothing too extravagant but knew the length he wanted to execute that"
"in the air but safe. Fullish outside off, driven on the up towards extra cover."
hammered. Slightly short outside off and Dhawan nails his pull to deep square leg
"on the pads, clipped to midwicket. Danger line."
"pulled away for four. Tests the short length in this pitch, it hurries onto Dhawan but he gets a leading edge past the vacant leg gully region for four."
"back of a length on leg, nudged to mid-on"
"fullish delivery around off, inside edge into the pad. 130 kph."
"a slower yorker on middle, pushed down towards mid-off for a single."
"good length outside off, no room because Kohli is standing on middle and off. Defended"
"too straight, on the ribs and worked to fine leg"
"good length outside off, carved to deep point for a run that <strong>takes him to fifty</strong>. Weathered the storm early and is in full control now"
"short outside off, swatted away through midwicket. That may have been a wrong shot but with a 6-3 field, that gap is too inviting. And he finds it."
"a low yorker on off, jammed away towards mid-on"
"four more. Back of a length outside off, sits up for Dhawan to hammer through mid-on. Just so easy. The same control he had during the 2015 World Cup against South Africa"
"a half-volley outside off, driven up towards mid-off"
"good length outside off, carved towards point"
"lovely length. Fuller than good, seaming in towards off. Kohli keeps it out"
"pulled in the air but safe. Short delivery on middle, Kohli can't quite keep it down. Wasn't in control of that, but didn't get enough behind that"
scissored to third man from the crease.
"oh yes. Overpitched and wide, Kohli leans into the drive and finds the gap through cover point. Doesn't quite make the boundary, but three more"
"overpitched again outside off, no movement at all. Hit towards cover"
a nice drive towards mid-off earns Dhawan another run
"full and wide outside off, chopped towards extra cover"
"on the pads, an easy clip through square leg"
"straight-ish, Kohli is standing far too close to off to able to hit that properly. Mis-timed to midwicket"
"what was that? A short delivery, bouncer, well-directed. Kohli tries to get underneath that and scoop over the slips but makes no connection"
"good length outside off, defended"
tapped past gully and he'll scamper for a couple more as deep point gets across
"it'll stop temporarily, in the search of the hundred. Dhawan runs down at the googly, the ball turns away, takes the outside half and lobs towards long-off where du Plessis hurries to his right to make a tough catch look incredibly simple. End of a sensational innings, one that has all but put South Africa out of yet another global event"
"tossed up outside off, driven to cover"
"another googly, driven to long-on. How easily is he picking Tahir? India have some terrific players of spin. They neuralised Shadab too"
"flat and wide outside off, slashed towards point"
"drops short. batsmen are lulled into thinking it's a bad delivery. it's just out of the front of the hand, and Kohli knows it. Worked to midwicket"
""
"good length on off, played towards cover"
"a half-volley and straight, mis-timed drive towards midwicket. Losing the control of the bat handle there"

"fullish on off, 134 kph, kept out"
"fullish and wide outside off, chopped away towards cover"
"pushed through, flat on off. it's short and Yuvraj thinks it's short, thinks it's tripe. It's not. It goes through quickly between bat and pad, and almost hits off stump"
driven languidly towards cover
a solid block to long-off.
"wow, I haven't seen anyone play Tahir as well as Kohli is currently. Short and wide, slashed to point. Knows it's the legbreak, got into position early"
"not sure if read it or not, but put his front foot forward and hit the ball intentionally over long-on"
"flat, straight and quick. AB doesn't choose to review. I'm not sure what the thinking is behind that. That may have pitched outside leg but surely, worth a strategic review? At this time especially. Yuvraj fell over a flick, and was struck right in front. That is not a good non-review, even if he thought it maay have pitched outside leg. Have to play your percentages, and South Africa haven't done that well all day. Will have HawkEye for you soon."

"flat on off, yuvraj chooses to sweep but inside-edged towards fine leg"

languidly driven to long-off
"a googly outside off, carved towards Morris' left at short third man. Dives to his left and saves three"
"my my. That's brilliant. Knows the gaps, it's straight, it's full. No chances of it spinning past either edge. With a straight bat, he flicks through midwicket. That is the shot of the day"
"overpitched on off, driven to long-off"
"another close lbw appeal, struck down by Reiffel. And <strong>AB chooses to review this. </strong>Flat outside off, spins back in and takes Yuvraj's inside edge onto the pad. So this will stay not out. Bat was behind the pad slightly, but the higher part of his bat was sticking out and the ball kissed that. Is it pad first through? Looks like it's bat onto pad. Yup."

"93 kph, on the pads, misses a flick does Yuvraj. Struck on the pad"
"finished with a six, and <strong>India seal their semi-final spot. </strong>Drops short on middle and leg, Yuvraj goes back and says thanks with a swat over midwicket. <strong>South Africa knocked out</strong> of yet another global event"
