length and skidding in at leg stump. Looks to flick it through square leg but doesn't make good enough connection
"fuller this time, on middle stump. Steps out and looks to flick this to long-on. Once more, not connected too well. Taps it into his toe and Sundar is lazy as he stretches to his left. Feeble single down to long-on"
"good length, drifting in at middle, straightening a touch. Pushed aerially towards the bowler"
"nicely played. Sundar is going to skid them in, so you can hit through the line. That's exactly what Tharanga does. A bit of room, half stride, and taps the length ball over mid-off"
"back of a length at leg stump, pushed towards midwicket from the crease"
"good length at middle stump, leans in and pushes to midwicket off the inside half of the bat"
"back of a length, slight shape away from off stump. Watchfully dabbed into the point region with soft hands"
"back of a length and skidding into the thigh guard as he looks to tickle this fine, dribbles through square leg"
"short ball, very wide and swinging away. Past his attempted cut"
nicely bowled. Gets this to rise in the corridor from short of a length. Steps out early and is forced to back away and try to carve this through point. Beaten
"good length at off stump, a slower ball. Defended down the pitch"
"<b>chips it straight to mid-on.</b> There is a lot of bounce in this wicket right now. This one climbs from a good length at middle stump. Dickwella brings out his trademark pick-up shot on the rise, but it gets too big for him. Gets it off the high part of the bat and gets a goodbye kiss from the bowler"

"a much better shot to play against Sundar. Whips this with the angle from off stump, gets it wide of long-on...where Pandya has over-run this. Poor effort"
"<b>got him!</b> Looks to go with the angle again, but this time Sundar gets it to straighten. He's lunging forward to try and flick towards wide long-on again, but it's a leading edge that's taken easily by the bowler"
"back of a length, shaping away outside off. Slashes at it and misses"
"back of a length in the corridor, opens the face and runs this fine past the slip fielder. Kuldeep sprints to his right at third man and can't cut it off"
"<b>holes out to deep square.</b> Oh dear, what are we seeing here. A poor shot from Tharanga. Plays for line - it's on leg stump. But it's a cutter too. He's rolled his fingers over this length ball ad Tharanga's bat turns as he looks to whip if over midwicket"
"short ball, too quick for him. Looks to pull this off his chest, but can only bunt it off the sticker towards square leg"
<b>nearly chops it on.</b> Back of a length and cramping him at off stump. He looks to steer it to third man and ends up dragging it wide of leg stump off the inside edge

shuffles a long way and sweeps a very full ball from middle stump. Straight to short fine
"back of a length at off, shuffles and taps it into the open midwicket region"
<b>outside edge</b> as he looks to cut. Hits some part of Dhoni - presumably glove - and flies past the slip fielder. This was quick off the pitch and cramped him for room
"back of a length in the corridor, nicely timed square drive off the back foot. One-bounce towards Pandey at point who flies to his left and keeps it to one"
"shot. Steps out first ball, gets a touch cramped outside off but he manages to carve this on the up through cover"
"135kph, bouncer at middle stump. Gunaratne looks to ramp it over the keeper but this fizzes past"
"122kph, slower ball on a length at off stump. Plonks the front leg across and flicks to deep square"
"struck on the pad after walking down, but he's met this length ball well outside off. He was looking to whip this forecefully"
"classy. Always is, this guy. Length ball outside off, half-stride to get in line with this and then he caresses it on the up past mid-off"

"full at middle stump, no feet as he swipes across the line. Gets it to deep square's right off the inside edge"
good length and wide outside off. Can't connect as he looks to drive on the up
<b>another stumping appeal</b> against Gunaratne. It's how he's gone in the first two matches. Survives this one after being lulled on the front foot and beaten by a wrong'un
"<b>dropped</b> by Dhoni. Another wrong'un, not picked. It's short at middle and he's still moving as he tries to back away and cut. Thick outside edge and Dhoni can't wrap his gloves around this"
"picks the gap. Steps out, meets it on the full outside off and clubs it past midwicket who is inside the circle"
"short ball, sliding away outside off. Chopped to sweeper cover"
"wrong'un, full outside off. Gunaratne goes well outside off, very early. Sweeps along the floor to deep backward square"

back of a length climber in the corridor. Arches a touch into the leg side and chops it to third man off the outside edge
"short at the chest, pulled to fine leg"
"goes for the bouncer again, but he's dug it too short. It sails over the batsman, who, once again, was in no position to play this. Cramped and taking his eyes off"
"it was coming. Sadeera steps out and wants to clear mid-off, but this gets big on him. It's that kind of a pitch. Dug in hard at an off stump line. He offers the full face, but it takes the high end of the bat. Dinesh Karthik pedals backwards and pouches it"

<b>top-edge</b> lands between fine leg and deep square. No control on the attempted hook and then he's forced to run back hard as Iyer sends in a sensational throw on the bounce

bouncer dug in too short and he lets it go
"good length at off stump, defended into the covers on the front foot"

"better line, starts it wider outside off, lets the ball spin back, worked away towards square leg"
"this one doesn't turn that much, flat outside off, defended ably enough"

charges down and pushes the ball to long-on
"the offbreak, flat around middle and leg, Rahul rocks back and pushes to long-on"
"just over the bowler's head? The googly again, outside off, Rohit comes down, gets to the pitch and drives back. Clears the bowler's leaping hands, mid-off cleans up"
"lovely delivery. Steams in and bowls a full length, gets just enough away shape to beat the outside edge. Not prodigious movement, but enough."

A wild heave from Rahul with the front foot plonked across off stump, was done by pace and movement"
