"pushed through by Zampa, and Abid misses the ball as he flicks across his front pad. It looked like it might be headed down the leg side, and Umpire Dharmasena turns the appeal down.

"<b>big swish outside off</b>, but he hits only fresh air!"
"<b>caught at deep point!</b> Imad backs away and hacks at a slower bouncer. He can't get any distance on the shot though, and can't control it either. Marsh comes in off the boundary and holds a simple catch, Australia grab another!"
"<b>another play and a miss!</b> Richardson is opting for a short-pitched approach, and Rizwan just cut underneath it"
"<b>this will help a little</b>, Rizwan sprinting down the track and flat-batting another short one straight back over Richardson's head"
"on a length, straight, and Rizwan is furious with himself as he can only push it back to the bowler. He was looking for a single to keep the strike"

"an attempted slower bouncer goes awry, looping way down the leg side"
