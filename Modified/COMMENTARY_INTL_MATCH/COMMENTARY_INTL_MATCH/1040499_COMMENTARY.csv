"full, a set of stumps outside off. Solidly blocked into the off side. Looked like pace off the ball"
"a nice line this just outside off, Shah strides forward to defend. A tidy over"
"stopped in the surface. Signs of a tired, sluggish surface. An offcutter on off, Tarakai is through his drive too early and chips the ball over the bowler. Mid-off cleans up"
a nice press forward to push the ball to mid-off. Can't really trust the pace of this surface
"and again. Pace off the ball outside off, Rahmat mis-times a drive back to the bowler"
"a slower offcutter outside off, Rahmat gets forward and defends, bat close to pad"
pushed down to long-on. More pace off the ball
"what a catch! That is special. The pressure of dot balls got to Tarakai. Murtagh, like he has been doing, takes pace off the ball with an offcutter. Tarakai goes through with a lofted drive but gets more elevation than distance. It hags in the air for a while. The fielder at long-on scurries across to his right, keeps his eyes on the ball all along and takes a lovely catch at deep midwicket. It doesn't have the aesthetics of a one-handed screamer but that is a brilliant take. Needed so many things to go right, did 'em all."
"fullish and wide outside off, a mis-timed drive finds extra cover"
driven on the up towards short cover
"another cutter. Full and straight, blocked away towards mid-on. Very tidy stuff"
"more pace off the ball. Shorter but on off stump, another solid block"

"drifts on the pads, Stanikzai misses a nudge and is struck on the thigh pad"
"fullish on off, pushed towards mid-off"

"full and straight, another offcutter. Blocked back"
nicely pushed down to long-on for a run
"overpitched on off, driven nicely down to long-on for one. Full face of the bat"

"flight on leg, a solid defensive block"
"drops short and wide, sits up for Stanikzai but he can only mis-time the ball back"
"worked nicely to fine leg. That was too straight, easy pickings"
"shortish on middle and leg, Shah goes back to push back to the bowler"
"too short on off, easy enough for Rahmat to go back in the crease and swat to long-on"
"eeks, tripe. Short, long-hop outside off. Keeps low after pitching, Stanikzai reaches out and carves a run to deep cover"
"that's a poor ball. Short and wide outside off, sits up for Stanikzai to slice past short third man. Well played, opened the face late"
"adjusts well. Full and straight, pushed towards midwicket"

"nicely bowled. Flat and quick on middle, blocked"
"plenty of flight outside off, Shah drills a drive but finds cover. Has to do more with that"
"and that too. Short and wide outside off, slapped towards Porterfield at cover. Those are two singles Afghanistan should have had."
Stanikzai goes back and pushes the ball towards the sweeper cover
"flight on off, blocked"
"driven back to the bowler. Too many dot balls, adding pressure"
"spins back in from outside off, pushed away towards long-off"
"Stanikzai tries to clear that pressure. And does. Gets down the pitch, meets the ball as it pitches and shovels a flick over midwicket. Long-on can't get across in time either"
"flat on middle and leg, played away quietly towards midwicket"
"lovely shot. Flat on leg, sits up for Rahmat who goes back and intentionally lifts the ball over midwicket. Used as straight a bat as possible to get it wide of square leg"
driven away towards cover from the crease. Porterfield saves one with a dive
"driven to the left of Porterfield this time, he can't get across. A run"
"another short straight delivery, pushed down to long-off"
"hammered for four more. Flat on middle and leg, Rahmat sits low and hammers a pull through square leg. Hasn't yet developed a flipper, so his short ones are just sitting up"
"a low full toss on the pads, worked through backward square leg for more runs."
"another poor ball. Short and wide, sits up for Shah to cut through backward point. Too many easy runs on a tough batting pitch"

""
pushed back towards the bowler with a full face
"flat on the pads, clipped to deep midwicket. Just too inconsistent are Ireland's spinners"

"there is that poor line again. Full and down leg, swept in the gap behind square for four. Easy runs"
"flatter delivery outside off, keeps a tad low. Hit out to deep cover from the crease"
"on the pads, worked towards square leg for one"
"flat outside off, driven to cover. Another dot"

"flight outside off, Stanikzai looked to hit that to cover, but inside-edged to midwicket"
"on the pads, worked to midwicket with the spin"
defended off the back foot

blocked to cover. Too many dots I presume
"flat outside off, Rahmat presses forward to gently defend"
another block. There is no intent to even score of these.
"worked to long-on this time. Using his wrists. Finding fielders is acceptable, but not even trying isn't. Suddenly, the equation comes down to something unmanageable"
"clipped to midwicket for a run, so much better"
runs down the pitch. McBrine sees that and fires it in short. Punched to long-on
nicely played. A leg side delivery is nudged to square leg for one
"loads of flight outside off, pushed out to cover"
"nicely done. Gets a tight delivery on off, Stanikzai allows the ball onto his open-faced bat for a run to point"
driven back to the bowler for another dot. Counting
hit towards cover for a quick run
"there is that pressure. And it has almost resulted in another wicket! Stanikzai gets lucky. Runs down, doesn't get to the pitch but goes on with his swing. The fielder at long-on stepped on the boundary as he was trying to throw the ball back in after catching."
played back to the bowler
"shortish and wide, cut out to deep point for one"
"shortish outside off, carved away towards point"
"driven to midwicket, who is in to cut out the angles either side of him. if he was deeper, he may not have got to this"
and again. Pushed to the fielder at midwicket
just a gentle defensive block to midwicket. Three dot balls
"pressure-releasing stroke. Full and wide, hammered to cover who stops two with a dive to his left."
"a yorker outside off, jammed away to cover"
"that is clean! Shimmies down the pitch, gets to the pitch of the ball and sends a nice clean swing through the line. Sails over long-on"
"flatter and fuller, defended"
"done in this time! Stanikzai goes. Against the ball turning away, that's a dangerous option because if it does spin, then it opens you up to this. Stanikzai wanted to hit that over long-on again but takes the outside half and skews down to long-off. The previous six was also fraught with risk, but that one didn't turn and he got closer to the pitch. This one, he was done in by good bowling. The length was shorter"

defended off the front foot
