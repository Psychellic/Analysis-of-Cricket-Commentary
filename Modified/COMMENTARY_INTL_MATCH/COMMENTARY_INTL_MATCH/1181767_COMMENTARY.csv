"Chahar steams in, but pulls out of the delivery as he gets to the crease, holding onto the ball, and when he delivers the second attempt, he sprays it down the leg side. Nerves?"
"that's better, pitching the ball up to Shaw and finding some curve away from the bat. But it's met with a good stride forward and a punch into the covers"
"Prithvi is up on his tip-toes to crunch a back of a length delivery to cover, Chahar pulling his length back a touch. But he can't quite thread the gap"
"full, and it's driven, but again he picks out cover perfectly"
"and he opens his account with a bottom-edged hack that bounces into space in front of cover point. Quick hands, but the connection wasn't great"
"<b>bottom edged</b> again, the ball ricocheting off the bat and <i>just</i> past the stumps, and they pinch a single before the keeper's up"
"<b>there's that pull shot!</b> This wasn't all that short, but Prithvi hops back quickly into position and nails a pull in front of square, and into the gap"
"accurate start, with a touch of wobble on off stump. Dhawan props forward to push to mid off"
"down the track charges Dhawan, but he flashes under the ball and hits only fresh air"
"full, in the slot, and it's <b>slammed down the ground</b>. Thakur's searching for swing, but there's none to be had"
"<b>and again!</b> This one is straighter, and even sweeter off the blade. Thakur's seam position is excellent, but it's too full and Dhawan is forward to meet it in full flow"
"pulled through square leg now, the bowler switching his length up and Dhawan waiting deep in the crease expectantly. The timing and placement are spot on"
"good follow-up, Dhawan dead-batting to cover for a tip-and-run single to keep the strike"
"rising outside off with some inviting width, but Dhawan cuts over the top of it, bottom edging the ball hard into the turf"
"back of a length, in the channel, but Dhawan rides the bounce well and cracks a single out to that deep point fielder"
"Prithvi pulls, but misses, and he's struck on the thigh. It looks high, the umpire's call is not out, but they <b>ask for a review</b>. He's not the tallest, though, and the ball wasn't climbing too much. But it's three reds, and the decision is over-turned! Excellent review there"
"pushed across him, on a length and outside off, and Munro misses a booming drive"
"slammed back down the ground! Munro danced out at him, getting to the pitch and holding nothing back as he swatted the ball back down the ground, past the bowler and along the turf"
"slower ball to finish, and Munro is slightly wrong-footed on his attempted dab to third man, ball beating bat"
"looped up full, just outside off, and Dhawan turns the strike over with a drive to long off"
"round the stumps comes Harbhajan, Munro tapping softly to cover"
"<b>crunched through cover!</b> Too short, and the ball just sat up outside off. It's a slow track, and his length was all wrong"
"<b>that's better!</b> Flighted up outside off, and Munro loses his shape in an ungainly swipe to leg"
"top edged! Munro's in a rush, and turns into a reverse sweep, top-edging the effort over short third man"
"Harbhajan finds some grip outside off, Munro pinging cover with a drive"
"very full outside off, and Dhawan squeezes a drive out to deep point"
"Chahar comes around the stumps, but Munro uses the angle to work a single into the gap in front of midwicket"
"bouncing over leg stump! Dhawan catches a lucky break after he walks down at Chahar and bottom edges a pokey shot back towards his stumps, the ball just evading the timber"
"held back by Chahar at just over 122km/h, Dhawan turning the strike over with a push to cover"
"pushed down the leg side, but the umpire reckons it's clipped Munro's thigh and doesn't give a wide. Munro disagrees. Vehemently"
"shorter, but slow at only 116km/h, Munro pulling just wide of mid on for a single"
"some grip and spin, but Munro's back and across to nurdle into the leg side"
"<b>Dhoni juggles, but holds it at the second attempt!</b> Dhawan tried to manufacture a glide to third man, but the ball just bounced a little more than he expected. The bounce also took Dhoni by surprise, but he manages to cling on to a juggling effort"
"and he's off the mark straight away with a gentle push wide of long on. Shreyas wants two, but Munro says no"
"Munro stays deep in his crease, tapping a single out to long off"
"flicked off the pads, and into the leg side for one"
"thumped down to long off, Harbhajan copping a stinging blow to the finger as the ball passes him, and a single <b>ends the Powerplay</b>"
"Munro doesn't look in control as he flashes at a straight one, the ball coming off the inside half of the bat and rolling into space on the leg side"
"some grip in the surface! Shreyas is setting himself to play to leg, but he's squared up by one that holds up in the surface"
nudged softly into the leg side
"pushed back hard at the bowler, who stops it cleanly"
glanced with the spin into the leg side
"darter from Jadeja, but even the quicker one grips and Shreyas has to hurry his dab to point"
"Munro slashes under a drive, scooping it in the air through point - but the fielder's in the deep"
"some width outside off, but there's protection in the deep so it's only a single"
"floated up by Harbhajan, and Munro can't thread the gap at cover"
<b>but this time he does!</b> Munro breaks the quiet spell with a flashing drive through extra cover. The placement is perfect
"<b>up and over, inside out!</b> The ball is fuller, and straighter, but he opens the bat face to slice it into the gap"
"darted in a little quicker to finish, and Munro is content to just keep this one out"
"nudged in front of point, and there's no room for a single"
"Shreyas sets himself for a paddle, the ball rushing on and coming off his pad, rolling fine of short fine leg"
"swept in the air, the ball coming to ground well in front of the outfielder"
"pushed down the ground, one more"
"<b>swept straight into his lap!</b> Munro wants to slog sweep this into the stands, but he can't get the distance in the shot, and Bravo barely has to move at deep square leg. Capitals are losing their way ..."
"and he's off the mark straight away, sweeping hard into the deep for a hard-run brace"
"pushed through at his legs, Shreyas driving through mid on"
"very full, and Pant has to reach for this drive outside off, getting the ball down to long off"
an easy punch down the ground brings an ambled single
"lapped up and over short fine leg! Pant walked right across to off and set himself early, lifting the ball deliberately up and over"
tapped into space in front of midwicket for one
"nicely played, a dab to short third man, but it's just the one"
"full on off stump, flicked to midwicket"
"length ball on off stump, blocked towards midwicket"
"full outside off, giving Iyer a bit of room to free his arms. He creates more by getting his front leg away from the line, and drives it along the ground to the left of extra-cover, and a long way to the right of deep point"
"back of a length on off stump, punched to deep point"
"back of a length, angling across to off stump. Gets behind it and works it to the left of midwicket"
"length ball on off stump, looks for the punch to long-on but hits it too close to midwicket, who quickly moves to his left to intercept"
"googly leaving off stump, not short enough to cut, Pant slashes and misses"
"fuller now, on off stump, driven to long-off"
"big swing across the line, and a big miscue. Looked like the googly out of the hand, quite a bit of flight on it, and Iyer went for the front-foot hoick over square leg. It was the googly, but it didn't turn as much as expected, just bounced a little extra, and the top-edge swirls high in the air before Raina settles under it at backward point"
"loopy and full on middle stump, driven to long-on"
"tossed up once more, another drive to long-on"
"aaand again, Tahir keeps it full and on the stumps, and he shows the full face to pick up another single to long-on"
"length ball slanting away from the left-hander into a sixth-stump line. Swings hard and misses, looking to hit over cover"
"back of a length on leg stump, defended back towards the bowler"
"fullish on middle and off, driven to long-off"
"length ball angling across towards off stump, lets it come on and guides it into the point region with an open face"
"short, angling across the left-hander, getting up to about shoulder height, and Axar leans back for the ramp. Unfortunately for him, third man is back on the boundary, and all he does is hit it straight down his throat"
"back of a length on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"shortish on off stump, makes some room to slap to sweeper cover"
"dip and turn, and Rutherford is beaten in the air. Legbreak, tossed up, angling across initially and pitching outside off, and he comes forward to drive against the turn. The ball dips and turns to beat the inside edge and hit the front pad. Runs away past the keeper for four leg byes too. Big appeal for lbw, not given. Did it strike him in line? <b>Dhoni has reviewed</b>... Wow! It struck him in line with off stump, according to ball-tracking, but the ball was bouncing over the stumps!"
"back of a length outside off, zippy googly. Pushes at it without moving his feet and the ball beats his outside edge"
"Rutherford is struggling to pick Tahir here. Another wrong'un, fuller, outside off. Makes room to slash through the off side and he can't put bat to ball"
"beaten again. Dangled up slower, another googly outside off, and he goes for the slog-sweep and misses"
"full, quicker and straighter this time, on middle and leg, and Rutherford clips it back to the bowler"
"slower ball, back of a length, angling across the stumps. Nudged quietly into the backward square leg region"
"unlucky. Length ball angling across to off stump and Rutherford clears his front leg for the diagonal-bat slap down the ground. Hits it straight back towards the non-striker, and Pant tries to jump out of the way and juuust about fails to, gets a smack on his toe"
"slower ball, ends up as a high full-toss on off stump - it's called no-ball - and Pant swings hard but only manages a single down to long-on, all along the ground off the high part of the bat. Tight call, may have been dipping below waist height"
"very full on middle stump, looks to clear his front leg and hit down the ground, but it's too full to get any elevation. All he manages is a single to long-on"
"slower length ball on off stump, opens his bat face and dabs it a few yards to the left of Dhoni. Pant seems in a bit of pain as he completes the single"
"in the blockhole close to leg stump, gets his front leg out of the way and clips to long-on"
"slower length ball pitching on leg stump, angling across towards off. Clipped away along the ground through backward square leg"
"short and wide, deliberately bowled there, pretty slow too. Slapped to deep point"
"goes for short and wide again, but this time the ball sits up outside off, and Rutherford meets it with an amazing shot, slaps it hard and flat, all the way over the cover boundary"
"short again, not as much room to free the arms, cut to the right of deep point"
"back of a length close to off stump, uses his wrists to work it into the vacant midwicket region"
"gone. Length ball wide of off stump and Rutherford aims over the covers again, not full enough for it and it grips and turns. Slices off the outside half of the bat into short third man's hands"
"flat, back of a length, turning towards leg stump to cramp Keemo for room as he tries to create some. Punched back to the bowler"
"full on off stump, clipped away through midwicket"
"full on off stump, he's been very conscious about denying the batsmen elevation. Driven down to long-off"
"length ball on off stump, legbreak, and Pant puts it away. Gets a big stride forward, plays the pull-sweep, and places it perfectly between deep midwicket and deep backward square leg"
"taken, juggled, taken again, but he's over the rope! The googly this time, loopy and outside off, and Pant loses his shape trying to slog-sweep, and hits it high towards long-off. Deepak Chahar is moving towards the boundary as he catches it, lobs it up in the air while stepping over the rope, and unfortunately for him the momentum means he's not succeeded in tossing it back into the field of play"
"full, driven towards long-on"
"tossed up, wrong'un turning in from outside off, swept along the ground to deep backward square leg"
"goes for the leg-stump yorker, ends up bowling it down the leg side"
"shortish slower one pitching outside leg. Steps across to try and pull, and he misses. Doesn't miss the glove by much and the umpire doesn't call wide"
"down the track and Bravo spears a full one away from his reach, outside off. Goes hard at it but can only hit it into the pitch and back to the bowler"
"slower length ball angling away from off stump. Looks to get down on his back knee to slog-sweep, and ends up inside-edging past leg stump"
"full outside off, too full to hit down the ground, driven to the left of deep point"
"boom. Perfect leg-stump yorker, at full pace - 139kph, which is super quick for Bravo - and Paul is sure as hell surprised. Big backlift, clears his front leg, prepared to hit over the leg side, and suddenly the ball is hurtling towards his toe at unexpected pace. Before can bring his bat down the ball is past him and his stumps are disturbed"
"full on middle and leg, clipped to deep square leg. No single taken, and rightly so."
"slower length ball angling away from off stump, hoicked along the ground between long-on and deep midwicket"
"back of a length now, digs this slower offcutter into the pitch, and angles it away from Pant's hitting arc. Again hits along the ground, and again into the gap between long-on and deep midwicket to pick up two more"
"the line was getting a little predictable, and he angles another back-of-a-length ball away from off stump. Pant reverse-swats it over backward point, but can't get too much power on it because it's another slower one. They run two even though he hit it close to the fielder at deep point, and Rayudu's throw misses the stumps with the batsman yards from making his ground"
"got him. Sticks to that line outside off, bowling the cutter into the pitch and making Pant fetch it against the angle. Goes for the big one this time, and can't get it far enough to the left of long-on"
"oh my, Faf du Plessis, what an effort that is! That's full, on the stumps, and Mishra flicks it - it's almost the helicopter shot - up in the air, times it extremely well towards the wide long-on boundary. Faf sprints at full tilt to his right, throws himself horizontally at the ball, and slaps it back into the field just as it's about to clear the boundary"
"another full one on off stump, and this time Mishra steps across and flicks it behind square, up and over to the left of short fine leg. What a shot!"
"flat, angling into off stump, and Boult jabs it back to the bowler, at catching height. Miraculously, Jadeja drops it despite getting both hands to it"
"whoa. Flat length ball on leg stump, and he clears his front leg and hoicks it high over long-on. That was powerful"
"similar line and length, but this time it's slower and slightly shorter. Boult swings too early, a little across it, and misses, and loses his leg stump"
"back of a length on the stumps, jabbed hard, back to the bowler"
"another great effort from Faf, but this time he can't stop it. Down the track jumps Ishant, and he gets close to the pitch and swats it hard and flat, back over the bowler's head, and Faf, throwing himself to his left on the long-on boundary, can't quite pull it back"
"wow, what a finish, and from who! Down the track once more, and this time he makes himself a bit of room as well. Jadeja pulls his length back, and Ishant flat-bats it, middles it, and easily clears the boundary to the right of long-off"
"Boult, as is his wont, is right on the mark first up, curving a length delivery in towards Faf's off stump, but the South African skipper responds with steely-eyed and solid defence"
"<b>big appeal!</b> Boult snakes a fuller one in to Faf's pads and belts out an appeal, but the umpire shakes his head. And there's no review. It pitched way outside leg"
"<b>chaos!</b> What has gone out there? The ball was tapped to point and Faf set off, and then stopped. Watto, too, had started to run, stuttered, and now he turns back. The batsman meet mid-pitch in utter confusion! There are shies at both ends, but they both miss and - eventually - Faf gets down the other end for a single. Phew!"
"full, tapped to mid on. No attempt at the run this time"
"Watto looks for a dab down to third man, but he can't beat gully"
"<b>inside edge</b>, and it might have saved Watson as he's struck on the thigh. At least, it stifled Boult's appeal for lbw"
"rising up outside off, Faf standing tall to meet the ball and punching to point, where an athletic stop saves the run. Capitals are buzzing in the field"
"full, and Faf steps into a thundering drive, but the mid off fielder gets himself in front of it"
"angled in, on a length, and Faf is content defending from the crease"
"slower cutter from Ishant, Faf nurdling it into the leg side. There's another moment of hesitation before they complete the single ..."
"Ishant hits a length on off stump, and Watto softens his hands to collect a quick single, close in on the off side"
"Faf is forward, on the drive, and aims his shot straight at mid off - but this time he calls clearly and early, puts his head down and gets home safely - though the shy also goes wide"
"another brave run! Faf pings mid off perfectly with his drive, but he was always going to run and he's quick enough to have his bat grounded inside the line by the time the shy swerves past the stumps. It was Shreyas with the throw"
"angled down behind point, just the one"
"<b>slugged over the leg side!</b> Faf read the length on this early, and was ready and waiting in position when the ball arrived, pulling hard and in the air off the front foot"
"another tip-and-run single from Faf, tapping to mid off and setting off. He's certainly keeping Capitals on their toes"
"Boult finds some lift outside off, Watson milking a single down to third man"
"Faf whips across his pads, collecting a single into the leg side"
"Faf walks out at the bowler, slamming a drive to mid off. This time he doesn't opt for a risky single"
"once again Faf is down the track, giving Ishant the charge, but he's undone by a change of pace, flinging his hands out way to early and missing the ball"
"worked off the straight by Faf, who collects another single out to deep midwicket"
"Watson waits and dabs late, but he can't beat short third man"
"nudged softly into the leg side, and there's room for a single"
"Faf and Watto are doing this in singles, as a shot comes off the toe end, trickling to mid on"
"Faf backs away, giving himself acres of room, but slices under the ball and very nearly spoons a catch to short third man, who stops it on the bounce"
"slapped up and over extra cover! Faf favours that area, and once again he makes room to set the shot up"
"<b>moosed over extra!</b> This is masterful from Faf, who backs away and powers the ball up and over the cover boundary"
"good follow-up, Faf turning the strike over with a single"
"Watson now looks to make room, but the ball rushes on to him, cramping a cut that goes nowhere"
"Watson cuts again, and hits it better this time, but straight at the point fielder"
"whipped behind square! Faf is reading the length very quickly tonight, and now he's also gifted a helpful angle by Ishant, helping the ball on its way down the leg side"
"<b>past a diving short third man!</b> Faf knew Ishant would correct his line, and makes room to attack the off side. He doesn't keep the shot down, though, and it's not far away from the diving fielder inside the ring. Once past him, it's four"
"<b>three in a row!</b> Length isn't working for Ishant. Faf waits deep, and it's <i>just</i> short enough that he can muscle a pull out to deep midwicket"
"shorter this time, and Faf rides the bounce to tuck a single square on the leg side"
"Ishant aims a full one for Watto's pads, a single into the leg side the result"
"Faf is a little early into this forcing stroke as the ball seems to hold up a little, but the ball rolls into a gap on the leg side and they take a single"
"leggie, floated up on leg stump, and Faf is forward to push to mid on"
"wonderfully flighted outside off by Mishra, the ball arriving at 75km/h as Faf taps to point"
"Faf puts a little more vim in this drive, but he can't beat the cover ring"
"slightly quicker at 84km/h, and it looked like a googly too, but it's read and driven to long off"
"Watson lunges out at a full one, outside off, and drives to long off. He made sure to get forward"
"<b>swept fiercely!</b> Faf has well and truly got his eye in now, and he bends low to get himself in the perfect position to swat a sweep out to deep square"
"and he starts with a slow yorker, delivered at just 110km/h but right on target and aimed at Watto's toes"
"oh dear, the full pace delivery at 135km/h is sprayed down the leg side, evading a diving Rishabh Pant and racing away for five wides to <b>bring up the fifty stand</b>"
a late dab brings a single to third man
"slower one, right down to 102km/h, and Faf waits to flick into the leg side"
"<b>helped on its way!</b> Paul bends his back to send this down at 138km/h, but it's a full toss outside leg and Watson just needs to put bat to ball to get his first boundary"
"Paul finds some cut in to Watson off the track, but the ball is dead-batted into space on the off side and they sprint through for a single"
"<b>this one keeps low!</b> Faf lunged down at it as the ball crept through low, and just about got the bat there in time, bottom edging it past short third man. Munro hares after it, and slides into a dive at the boundary, parrying it back in. But is his foot in contact with the boundary as he does so? The TV umpire Shamshuddin checks out several replays and eventually decides that it's a boundary - and possibly a vital one. It was a very close call, and a tough one"
"lapped down to fine leg! The boundary down there was left open, and Watson bent low to fetch this from off stump and paddle it very fine"
"Watson slog, skies and the ball goes almost straight up! But who wants it? Prithvi Shaw is close in , but it's Munro who runs in from long on ... and he can't get to it in time! Really, that was Prithvi's catch. Munro had so much ground to make up, Prithvi was right there"
""
"punched to cover point, no run"
"slashed uppishly and out to wide long off, where it's Munro again who cuts it off"
"Faf flicks off his toes, and the fielder is in quickly enough from long on to keep them to one"
"Axar darts one in at the stumps, Faf nudges to cover, but he can't find space for a single"
"chopped down towards point this time, but again they can't find a run"
"eased down to long on, and that's <b>fifty for Faf!</b> His 12th in the IPL"
"another paddle-sweep from Watson, and though there's a hint of top edge about this one, there's no-one at short fine leg"
"<b>slammed into the stands!</b> Axar spears another one in at the pads, but Watson meets it with a huge slog sweep and connects well"
"nudged to point, but straight at the fielder"
"length ball close to off stump, slapped to short extra"
"short on leg stump, and there's the breakthrough. Was a little cramped for room while looking to pull this, and he can't quite get the power on it to clear the boundary. Keemo Paul catches it diving to his right at deep square leg"
"full, angling into the stumps, clipped through square leg"
"back of a length on the stumps, doesn't give Watson the width he was looking for while stepping away from leg stump. Dabbed towards backward point"
"in the blockhole on leg stump, jabbed back towards the bowler"
"length ball on middle stump, stays leg-side of the ball and opens his bat face to steer it to third man, past the diving backward point fielder"
"shortish, angling down leg, and Watson just dismisses it from his presence, a whip off his hips that carries all the way over the backward square leg boundary"
"short again, this time it sits up outside off and Watson pulls it over midwicket, into the wide open spaces at that boundary"
"slower length ball on off stump, clipped down to long-on"
"short, shoulder-high ball outside off, plays a checked pull along the ground to long-on"
"slower length ball wide of off stump, and Watson gets a big stride out and fetches a slog-sweep all the way over the wide long-on boundary"
"looks for the leg-stump yorker, ends up sliding down the leg side and forcing Pant into a diving save"
"slower ball, full on off stump, and Watson miscues it for six to bring up his fifty. A little unfair on bowlers, this game can be. Watson went for the big hit over long-on, I think, and he ended up slicing underneath the ball and sending it hiiiiigh over long-off, but he's also managed to put enough into the shot for it to carry all the way"
"full outside off, driven to long-off"
"down the track comes Watson, and this time he's found the fielder. Mishra straightened his line, bowled it at middle and leg to cramp Watson slightly, and his lofted inside-out drive doesn't carry as far as he wanted"
"ooh, could easily have been a caught-and-bowled. Shortish googly spinning down leg. He picked the wrong'un, but it stuck on the pitch and popped up off the leading edge as he looked to work it into the leg side. Didn't pop back to the bowler, though, just a short distance towards extra-cover"
"length ball outside off, pushed back to the bowler"
"flat on the legs, worked through square leg"
"tossed up outside off, driven to long-off"
"full on off stump, worked with the turn through square leg"
"length ball outside off, driven to deep extra-cover"
"tossed up on off stump, clipped to long-on"

"full on off stump, driven to long-off"
"flat length ball outside off, blocked back to the bowler"
"front-of-the-hand delivery, ends up dragging it short, pulled firmly and on the bounce to deep midwicket"
"slow legbreak outside off, waits on it and punches to the off-side sweeper"
"nicely looped up on middle stump. Doesn't get to the pitch with his front-foot stride. Wanted to drive to long-off, has to instead adjust and dab to backward point with an open face"
"flatter and fuller, blocked back to the bowler"
"flat legbreak on leg stump, swept along the ground to deep backward square leg"
"very full on off stump, jabbed down to long-on"
flat length ball wide of off stump. Raina goes for the hard sweep and misses
down the track and Axar angles bowls it flatter and shorter outside off. Looks for the leg-side heave and drags an inside-edge past leg stump and the keeper
"flat, back of a length outside off, waits on it and chops it through backward point"
"shot. Down the track, moving away from leg stump, and he gets into the perfect spot against this flighted ball to loft it inside-out over extra-cover"
"flatter, on the pads, clipped through square leg"
"bowled him. There's already been one thick inside-edge in this over, and now he drags one onto his stumps. This was perhaps a touch too close to cut, and he goes at it with an angled bat and chops it on"
"back of a length, angling across the stumps. Stays leg-side of the ball and jabs to deep point"
"very full, sixth-stump line, Dhoni doesn't really move his feet. Jabs at it and gets a thick inside-edge that pretty much doesn't go anywhere"
"short, down the leg side, and Dhoni helps it off his hip to the fine leg boundary. Fine leg was way too square to even think of stopping this"
"full on middle and leg, clipped to the left of fine leg"
"digs it in short, gets it up near Dhoni's right collarbone. Rolls his wrists over to pull along the ground to fine leg"
"on the fuller side of a good length on middle and leg, blocked back to the bowler"
"full, angling into the pads, clipped to fine leg"
"back of a length, angling down leg, and you can't keep bowling that line. Rayudu tickles it away nice and fine, and fine leg is once again too fine to be able to stop this"
"bouncer outside off, Rayudu thinks of hooking, and in the end decides to drop his bat out of the way and evade it"
"slower short ball, jags in off the pitch from outside off. Rayudu is through his pull too early and the ball grazes his glove and hits his stomach"
"short, wide, Rayudu gets on his toes and slaps it away to the backward point boundary"
"length ball close to off stump, presses forward and pushes towards backward point"
"back of a length in the corridor, nips away off the seam, Dhoni jabs at it without any footwork and the ball beats his outside edge. Ishant's bowled a lot of this sort of ball in Test cricket of late"
"down the track and Ishant tries to cramp him by bowling it full at his feet. Ends up as a low full-toss and Dhoni chips it back over the bowler's head. Munro does well to field it, running hard to his left at the long-on boundary"
"back of a length on off stump, punched to extra-cover"
"short outside off, and Dhoni's pulled it straight to the man on the boundary! Keemo Paul hardly had to move there, at deep square leg. CSK will have to wait just a little longer"
"short, gets up to chest height on off stump, pulled through midwicket, along the ground"
"there it is, CSK are through to their eighth IPL final. Another bouncer, angling into the left ribcage. Steps across and fends at it, gets just enough on it to beat Pant throwing himself to his left behind the wicket"
