"excellent rhythm from Topley now, in the channel again and left alone"
"a touch too wide, just swinging past the tram-lines on this occasion"
"<B>edged and the slips are in play!</B> Sure enough, that carry is rewarded, as Topley hits the seam on a lovely full length, draws the hard-handed drive, and Stokes at second slip snaffles the chance, almost in front of first, high to his right.

"back of a length, on the pads, clipped to the leg side. A fine over"
"<B>high-elbowed punch!</B> Clean down the ground, Rohit hasn't seen much of the strike yet, but makes that one count, a bit flatter from Curran, right into his arc on the full length"
"pushed into the covers, with a waft of the hands"

"angled bat, into the slips on the bounce as Curran draws Rohit forward again"
"awkward half-length from Topley, Virat rides the extra bounce on the back foot, down into his crease"
"much fuller, aiming for the inswinging yorker, but that's just a low full-toss, and Kohli accepts the flick to leg to get off the mark"
"tight line outside off, Rohit leaves alone at the last minute. A quizzical look from Buttler, as if he heard a noise there"
"thumps the pad, and a <B>half an appeal from Topley</B>... Buttler reckons that's sneaking past leg, and he's probably right. Pitched outside leg too. Apart from everything... pretty close"

"back on a fuller length, outside off with a hint of swing"
"<B>short and wide, and clattered through point!</B> Topley's losing his radar a touch in this over"
"another loose one, short outside off, but thumped to short cover"
"<B>banged in short and hoisted over midwicket again!</B> Topley is rather flailing through this over now, needs to finish well"
"... and he does, finding a fuller length and drawing a respectful block. It's been a decent comeback but I suspect his work is done for now"
tucked off the pads to the man on the 45
"lovely line, full length, and zipping past a half-cocked block on the front foot. Wobble seam from Curran"
"stabbed to backward point, riding the bounce from back of a length"
"<B>caught at short backward square!</B> That's a gift for England, a leg-stump inswinger from Curran, easy pickings for a well-set batsman ... or so Rohit thought, as he's got too much wood on the shot, and clipped it straight into Rashid's chest! Reward for Curran's new-ball discipline, and now England have a chance. Another tight powerplay is being rewarded with wickets on this occasion"

"flogged with intent across the line, but high on the bat as Stokes rushes in from cow corner to gather. This has been a sedate over so far. Good work from Topley"
"another slower ball, shaping down the leg side, and he gets out of his over very well. Krunal claws a pull to the leg side, but can't get it fine enough to elude the sweeper Rashid"
"wide outswinger, good areas from TK, thrashed hard but straight at the cover sweeper. A single will suffice from England's point of view"

"over-cooks this one, still aiming for that wide yorker"
"a bottom-handed bash out to deep point. A single to finish Curran's spell. It's another ugly analysis, but TK actually did pretty well at the beginning and end... just got battered in the middle!"
"waist-high full toss, very straight... and he gets away with it on height, as it dips at the last second. Excellent ball in the circumstances... the margins are so fine!"
"round the wicket, slow bouncer, into the body, as Hardik aims for his favourite wind-up over the covers, but gets it high on the bat"
"back over the wicket, and that's an excellent fuller length fast bowl, 135kph, and a bit of outswing too, flogged into the covers"
"<B>pumped through wide long-off!</B> So close to another good delivery, but Hardik's wristwork is outstanding, nailing it hard past the diving short cover"
"<B>Hardik is gone!</B> A knuckle-ball from Topley, banged into the deck, outside off, and a top-edged slog lands in Roy's hands again. He's gone but he's played another good hand... even if Topley has done well at the death"

"<b>slashed over cover</b>. Too short and too wide outside off, he threw his bat at it, didn't middle it but there's no fielder back there so it was a very safe shot. The ball just about trickles over the boundary"
"<b>big shout for lbw not given</b>. That looked really close, maybe impact outside off? Beautifully bowled by Bhuvneshwar, who brought it back in and through the gap between bat and pad as Bairstow was looking to drive. Replays show that hit in line but would have been umpire's call on hitting the top of the stumps"

"<b>clears Hardik at long-on and Roy has crossed the 40s to raise a fifty</b>. Thumbs up to his dugout and a wide grin on his face. Googly by Kuldeep which he didn't pick, was clearing his front leg to loft it high. Gets it off the eend of the bat, and Hardik can't quite reach it"
driven to long-on
"wants to go aerial but can't quite get underneath it, and it goes one-bounce to Hardik at long-on"
"too short, goes back and pulls to deep square leg"
"tossed up on the stumps, dug out to deep square leg"
"good length on off, steers it towards point, staying legside of the ball"
"<b>Imperious</b>. There's a long-on in place but he has hit it so well and so straight that it's gone over the boundary - just about - without the man having got anywhere near it. Overpitched on leg stump and he checks his lofted drive again, and once again gets the timing oh so good."
"<b>Bairstow's warmed up and is unleashing now</b>. Although unleashing has a sense of heavy power in it and he's once again just timed it to perfection. Length ball on the pads, he plays a pick-up shot and flicks it effortlessly over square leg. He's not hit the ball in anger but got 12 off two balls"
"length on off, punched to point"
"length on the stumps, pushed to long-on. <b>Yet another century stand between these two.</b>"
"off-cutter, dug into the pitch, he waits for it and calmly steers it to backward point"
"the checked shot doesn't quite come off this time, it plops in the air but there's no one at mid-on and it rolls to long-on for a single"
"<B>slammed into the stands!</B> Baristow rampages to his fifty in dismissive fashion, another loopy delivery, dipping into his arc, and hoisted up and over long-on!"
"advancing to the pitch, and nudged to the leg side... that's very hustly running from Bairstow, and a better throw might have been tight! Roy was struggling, but Kuldeep couldn't gather"
"<B>no doubt about this run out!</B> An exceptional piece of fielding from Rohit, leaping to his right to intercept a clip at midwicket... the two men had a chance to shake hands in the middle as the flicked return came in... and Roy has to go!"
"<B>raucous appeal for the lbw!</B> No shot offered from Stokes, and it might have been the left-armer's wrong'un, turning back into the left-hander's knee-roll. Outside the line, but that's non-applicable in this case... nope, missing by a distance. <B>Review lost!</B>"
"looped onto a teasing full length, Stokes stretches over the ball to squeeze it to cover"
"back of a length, punched uppishly to long-on. It's 111 for 1. David Shepherd would be hopping mad right now"
""
"standing tall on the back foot, punched to long-on"
"fully forward, and poked to the off-side"
"patted down to long-on, a period of calm from Bairstow as England focus on regrouping"
"width, and <B>Stokes slashes past the keeper!</B> A fat edge, slip would have swallowed it, but that's runs"
"solidly pushed down the line, to long-on. Steady as she goes from England"
"over the wicket, tight lines with the wristy action on the ball. Stokes is cautiously but firmly forward"
"a hack across the line, he felt that one was in his arc outside off, but didn't get hold of it to mid-on"
"jabbed to the on-side, a loud no from Stokes as England risk another run-out there.... careful now!"
"dipping into the toes, nudged to the on-side"
flicked off the pads to midwicket
"sliding into the hips, clipped behind square to keep England moving. It's a bit static after that flurry to the century stand, but a rebuild is fine with the depth to come"
"on the back foot, glided into the covers with an open face"
"high elbow, punched to long-on"
"<B>here goes Stokes!</B> Those sighters have not been in vain. A full-on golf swing through the line, high over mid-on, slapping his backside with the followthrough!"
"shuffling back to make room as the ball turns into a slightly cramped cut, out to deep cover"
"wicket-to-wicket, tight line, dabbed to mid-on with a full face of the bat"
"another big wind-up from Stokes, who seems to adjust mid-stroke to bunt the ball along the turf to deep midwicket, when his original designs had been on the stands"
"on the back foot, blotted down into the crease"
"advancing to the pitch, blocked with intent back to the bowler, who adjusted his length well"
"wider line, a firm crack of the willow through point, but more sharp fielding to crank up the pressure on Stokes"
"a well-weighted clip to the leg-side, but <B>that was a big of a hustle from Bairstow!</B> Kohli had to stretch to gather. Might have been tight with a direct hit from Krunal"
banged in short and that takes off through to the keeper.
"flashed hard to mid-off, in Stokes' arc but fractionally too wide for him to get any power through the stroke"
"round the wicket, probing length, blotted into the covers on the front foot"
"on the back foot, an open-faced punch to deep cover, and that's a well-weighted shot too, but just the single"
"fizzed down the leg-side, and a bye too as Pant can't gather as Stokes' urgent swing perhaps puts him off"
"back of a length, tight line, firmly punched to mid-off"
clawed out to the leg side
"eased to long-on, pressing through the line probing line from round the wicket"
"back over the wicket, and <B>that's a gift for Stokes!</B> Dragged down from Krunal, Stokes might have been shaping for the sweep but rocked back for the pull instead, and hitting with the spin, that was launched over midwicket"
"<B>swivel-pull, more runs!</B> Too short, into the hips, that whistled through backward square"
"good riposte, hitting the seam, and the inside-edge, with a nipbacker on a fuller length"
"<B>drilled through long-off!</B> Bairstow is a majestic driver in one-day cricket, so good at picking the gaps with power. That was straight, and violent!"
"curling into the toes, clipped with superb timing out through midwicket. Good flurry of runs for England right now"
"on the back foot, opens the face to steer down to third man with a hop for good measure"
Stokes returns the compliment with a left-hander's glide to third man. Steady from England to finish another threatening over
clobbered down to long-on
"belted across the line to deep midwicket, and a good tumbling stop to intercept another boundary"
"firm face of the bat, on the front foot, and blocked"
"a swish at a loopy leg-stump delivery, flicks the pads as the bat comes through"
"width, met at the top of the bounce with a thunking cut to deep cover"
"<B>hoisted over midwicket!</B> Stokes shimmies onto the back foot, giving himself oodles of room to launch the long-hop, and that's high over the ropes! Stokes is dealing almost exclusively in sixes for his catch-up shots... and he's ticking nicely now"
"outside off, and through to the keeper"
"swished off the pads, behind square, Kuldeep scrambles well on the boundary's edge to save the four"
"short, wide, crashed hard through point, but Rahul springs into action to intercept"
"too wide again, another comfortable freeing of the arms from Bairstow, and a single out to the deep cover boundary"
"<strong>oof, that zinged through!</strong> Stokes is beaten for pace as the cross-seamer skids past his half-formed clip to leg"
"attempted ramp, but can't connect as he falls away to the off side, seeking the lift over the keeper's head. Thakur as aniticipated has done a good job to cramp Stokes' style in that over"
"opens the face, for a glide to third man"
"tighter line, punched off the back foot into the covers"
"full-faced punch, back through the line"
"cracked hard to deep cover, latching onto the rare width"
"cramped on middle and leg, Stokes jabs the bat through the line to mid-on, and is coasting a little bit as the shy comes in ...<B>oh my!</B>  A bit casual with the appeal there too! This is excruciatingly close. The bail is up before the bat is in, but the zing doesn't light up for another couple of frames... is there a splinter of wood over the line... it's debatable! <B>Not out!</B> And I have to say, I think Stokes is very lucky there!"
"shaping away from the left-hander, and through to the keeper"
punched hard back to the bowler
"<B>a flat pull through backward square!</B> Too short, hanging on the back foot, waiting for the drag-down and dispatching it!"
"tucked to the leg side, can't get this one away"
"on the back foot, flipped to short midwicket"
bottom-handed drill through long-on
"short ball, grrr! Aggression to finish the over"
"<B>lamped through the line!</B> That's Bhuve's most hittable ball of the series, in the slot outside off, a free of the arms through long-off"
"a better follow-up, nipping back off the seam and inside-edged into the pads"
"attempted pull, not quite there for the shot, and under-edged into the crease"
"outside off, and Bairstow can't connect on the cut... might be wise to sit on this over rather than give it away. He's got his boundary off India's best bowler"
"open face, attempted glide through third man, but short third man is in situ to gather"
"poked to long-on to complete another excellent over, that first ball excluded"
"eased down the ground, compact strike rotation"
"a touch too short outside off, cracked firmly into the covers"
"tossed up, and dipping on a full length, blocked back down the pitch"
"<B>a free of the arms!</B> Kuldeep errs fractionally in length, looping it into that slot once more, Bairstow gives himself room with a shift of the front leg, and dumps it over cow corner!"
"on the back foot, zipping through a touch quicker and pushed to cover"
tucked to the leg side. Bairstow is on 94 once more...
"<strong>oops, that's too short and wide!</strong> Stokes can't hit it where he intended, but it doesn't matter. A thick edge through third man to get the over off to a flyer"
"<B>good riposte</B>. An in-between length and a tighter line, Stokes falls forward in his bid to get his push away"
"back and across, cut to cover"
"high elbow, driven down the ground to long-on"
"poked back to the bowler, stopped in the pitch, and <B>inches short of a catch</B>"
"very full, eased to long-on to complete a tidy over"
"<B>clattered into the stands to bring up a sensational hundred!</B> In the slot again from Kuldeep, hauled across the line over deep midwicket. And after barely seeing a ball in the opening overs, he's rushed to a 95-ball hundred that sets up their chase beautifully"
"honked across the line again, but he clothed this one, over-hit it a touch and lost his shape as the ball dribbled to deep midwicket"
"<B>hard and straight from Stokes!</B> Tossed up, above the eyeline, dipping in the arc, and pummelled into the sightscreen!"
"back of a length, pumped to mid-off off the back foot"
"<B>scuffed over the close catcher at midwicket!</B> it's another four, but nearly a misjudgement as Stokes went for the big wind-up, and hit that flatter than intended"
thrashed into the covers. And that will be <B>drinks</B> Kuldeep in particular will need one after that
"tight line from over the wicket, blocked into the covers"
fenced to midwicket with a high elbow
"very full, thumped back at the bowler's shins, and they scamper the single to bring up his fifty as the ball deflects to mid-off. Important innings from Stokes, especially given England's injured batsman"
"banged in short, Bairstow ducks. He's in no rush, clearly"
"<B>flogged so hard through midwicket!</B> Back of a length, Bairstow swivels into his pull, and the bottom hand comes off as he does so. But it makes no difference, that has fizzed!"
"opens the face, glided through backward point, England are ticking along nicely"
"over the wicket, into the legs, nudged to the on-side"
"<B>pumped over wide long-on!</B> Tossed up, dipping in the slot, down on one knee, flogged high over the leg side, rinse and repeat!"
"<B>battered over the leg side again!</B> A couple of steps, Kuldeep's pace through the air makes him a sitting duck to a well-set, aggressive biffer. 77kph. Whoomph"
"<B>tossed up, tonked!</B> Kuldeep is toast. He's butter on the toast... he's the crumbs of the toast left on the plate. I feel so sorry for him. Into the stands again, there's no respite at all. High over his head once more"
"wider line, that's not a terrible response, Stokes rocks back to cut to deep cover"
"A horrible drag-down to finish the over, but Bairstow scuffs his pull to short backward square. Ugh... poor chap. That has to be his work done, surely."
"<B>flambee-ed into the stands once more!</B> Different spinner, same response, rocking back this time to lift the left-arm spinner high over long-off!"
"far too wide this time, we'll have that again"
"<B>rifled through wide long-off!</B> Too short, on that wide line, you can't cramp anyone's style there!"
"so much width, it would have been given as such if he'd left it.  But he's seeing it like a planet now, as he batters hard to the wide long-off boundary's edge"
so wide that barely hits the cut strip... eesh
"round the wicket, into Stokes' arc for a slog sweep, and <B>tipped over the bar by Kuldeep at deep square leg!</B> Oh lummie, it's just following him now. He mistimed the jump, but that was travelling"
"<B>pounded with eye-popping violence over cow corner!</B> Holy smokes, that is smoked! Stokes is in an insatiable mood now!"
"<B>edged, and low past the keeper!</B> Wide line again, not sure it was a catch, but a clear edge. More runs. Wow"
"length ball into him, defended. Whoa, that's radical"
"bouncer outside off, and he sways out of the way. Two dot balls in a row. What alternate dimension is this? Okay it's normal business. Poor Prasidh has overstepped and it's a no-ball plus free hit"
"<b>whoosh</b>. This is stick cricket batting on cheat codes. That was a good ball by Prasidh on a free hit, very low full toss on the fifth stump. Bairstow stands still and pumps it over extra cover. Minimal bat swing. Just how?!"
"length ball nipping into him, Bairstow can be forgiven for thinking he just has to swing bat and get six, this time it thuds into his thigh pad"
"<b>boom</b> he goes straight over the bowler's head. Full toss on off, clears his front leg and slams it straight back. Gets four, which might feel like he's under-achieving."
"slower bouncer attempted outside off, sits up for Bairstow to unwind and have a mighty whack of a pull at it. Once bounce and into the midwicket boundary"
"<b>has he been caugh behindt?</b> The Indians aren't celebrating at all. The soft signal is not out too. This was a great ball to finish the over, a near yorker on a fifth stump line. Bairstow clearing his front leg to give himself room gets a thin edge on it, and Pant flies to his right to catch it. But the ball hit the ground immediately after Bairstow edged it. So not out."
"down the track and leathers this straight back past the bowler. <b>Rohit Sharma is down at the straight boundary</b>. Looks like a left elbow issue. Doesn't look good. Rohit's flat on the ground. This was fuller and Stokes just sauntered down and slammed it back past the bowler. Rohit at long-on ran to his right and dived, couldn't stop the ball. Okay he's back up and smiling now, so not too much damage."
"<b>he's caught behind for 99!</b> Great ball by Bhuvneshwar, who banged it in short down legside. Stokes was always going to go for it, swivelled to pull it, gets a glove on it that flies to Pant. Stokes has his head thrown back in anguish, but really - this is why centuries are over-rated. Who would honestly rate this 99 ahead of any of the centuries in this game?"
"fuller on off, steered to point."
moves across him as he's looking to clip it through the legside. Leading edge flies through backward point
"a defensive shot! Length and tight around off, patted back to the bowler with a straight bat"
"fuller on off, driven through cover"
<b>caught at cover</b>. Half volley outside off and he launched into a cover drive. Nailed it perfectly - except for the fact that it was right to Kohli at cover. Both set batsmen gone for England now.
"good length on a tight line on off, defended to the bowler's left"
"back of a length on off, defended to point"
"<b>stumps shattered with a yorker on off stump</b>. Prasidh Krishna is pumped, and how! Tailed in beautifully, quick ball too, Buttler's too late on the defensive push and the ball sneaks under the bat and bangs into the stumps. Now then, now then..."
"full outside off, shimmies down the track and defends to cover"
"banged in short, leg slip is there for that ball, but he does well to move across and fend it downwards to backward square leg"
"length ball, tapped to long-on"
"length ball strays on the pads, tucked to square leg"
"too short, sits up and he rocks back to cut fiercely through point."
"strays on the right-hander's pads this time from around the wicket, and is tucked to deep square leg"
"tossed up a bit on off, gently worked to square leg for a quick single."
"down the track, gets to the pitch and drives it to long-off"
"too short from Kuldeep, and Livingstone able to go right back and slam a pull shot to the midwicket boundary. Bent the knee nicely while swivelling"
"tossed up on the stumps, gets a thickish edge that rolls to point while driving"
"length outside off, googly spinning away, slapped to cover"
"tossed up on the stumps, driven to long-off on the front foot"
"goes on straight with the arm, length outside off, punched through cover"
"length ball on the stumps, went back to punch, it hung in the air but well wide of Kuldeep to his right. Long-off gathers. That ends Kuldeep's spell, he's gone for 84 in 10 overs."
"<b>hoicked over long-on</b>. Stunning hit. This was bowled on a length outside off, Livingstone coolly stepped out, which meant the lenght wasn't very short, and hoicked it over long-on"
"<b>and now he goes over square leg</b>. Nerves? what nerves? Banged in short, he stays still this time, swivels on the back foot and unleashes a monstrous pull shot."
"back of a length coming into off, stays in his crease and pushes it to long-on"
"back of a length on the stumps, he was looking to tap it into the legside, the ball bounces higher than he anticipated and takes the top edge off his horizontal bat and rolls towards point"
"back of a length outside off, stands tall and punches, straight to Kohli at cover who lets it slip through his hands. Extra cover cleans up but they get a single"
"<b>massive appeal for lbw</b> and Bhuvneshwar is annoyed that's not given. Tells Kohli to review it, who has a wry smile and does so. This certainly looked mighty close. <b>uh oh, here's why the umpire didn't give it out: it's pitched outside leg</b>. Moved after pitching to hit him on the pad, right in front, but that doesn't matter because the ball pitched outside leg."
"fuller outside off and angling away, goes for the drive and thick edges it to third man"
"bouncer going over leg stump, he was moving inside the line and tried to pull, but it got big on him and went over his bat"
"dug in back of a length and he was thinking it would rise up more, shaped to pull, copped a painful blow above the waist. They still take the leg-bye with the ball having rolled into the legside"
"length ball going across him, tapped towards point"
"fuller on the stumps, pushed towards extra cover"
"length ball going across him, beats his attempted steer to third man"
"length on the stumps, punched to long-on"
"back of a length going across him, hops while pushing it to cover"
flashes at it and gets an outside edge that goes very fine. Boundary to third man.
"too full on the pads, flicked off his pads through midwicket"
"good length on leg stump and nipping across him, patted back down the pitch"
"fuller on the stumps, flicked off his toes through square leg"
"back of a length in the channel, too close to cut and he can't connect"
"zipping across him at good pace, he's beaten looking to run it down to third man"
"bouncer, going across him, ends up too short and bouncing too high. Wide."
"full on off, shuffles across and clips to mid-on's left"
"yorker on off, but this is dealt with well, straight bat offered as it's dug out straight past the bowler"
"nails the yorker again, on off stumps, jams his bat down in time as the ball trickles back to the bowler"
"under-edge bounces to the keeper's right, towards slip. Pant dives across and lands a bit heavily on his chest, though he stops the ball. Short outside off, he was looking for a big wind up and an almighty pull, but only under-edged it down."
"bouncer over the stumps, he arches his back to get out of the way and let it go through"
"another bouncer, over off stump this time, he was shaping to pull but had to sway out of the way and drop his hands"
<b>that's a no-ball for height</b>. Banged in so short it just flies up. Well over the batsman. Way over a leaping Rishabh Pant too.
"<b>and England win on a mis-field</b>. Short ball, he rocks back and pulls powerfully to deep square leg. Kuldeep fumbles his take which allows England to take the two runs needed for victory."
