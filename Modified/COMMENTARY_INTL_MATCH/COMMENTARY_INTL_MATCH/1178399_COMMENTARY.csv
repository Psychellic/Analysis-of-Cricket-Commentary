"length on off, Rahul waits for it to come to him and defends it right under his eyes to point"
"length and angled away, rahul fishes at it with his hands, the slight movement away and extra bounce beats him on the outside edge again"

<b>first runs</b> off the thick outside edge. Gayle hangs the bat inside the line at this length ball and gets a run at third man
"<b>squares him</B> up in the corridor. Short of a length, he looks to defend and does well to play with soft hands as this pings to third man off the outside edge"
<b>past the edge.</b> Full and fast and pushed across the corridor. Gayles jams the bat into the ground well after the ball has climbed into the keeper's gloves

length and across the corridor. Changes his mind late and lets this go
short and up at the hips. Gets on his toes and deflects it past short fine off the thigh guard
<b>lovely.</b> This is a slower ball so he's done superbly to pick and punch off the back foot. A tad too short from Bumrah and he gets the weight transfer onto the back toe and gets the elbow high to pierce the infield

"length ball wide outside off, left alone"
"<b>carted to the wide long-off boundary!</b> This is not a great length at his pace - offcutter, dug in short outside off. Clears the front foot and flat-bats it through the off side. Extra cover is back and so is long-off, but this goes between them"

"<strong>finally, Mumbai break a very very threatening stand!</strong> What's more, it's Gayle, the scalp they'd arguably value more even though Rahul has looked pretty good himself. They have an opening now. It was length on middle, Gayle swung hard but the bat seemed to turn in his hands as he made contact with the ball, it was nothing more than a thick inside edge, went flat and hard towards deep midwicket, where he was caught well by the fielder who had dive forward"

"length outside off, Curran picks Bumrah up inside out over extra cover and gets off the mark with a boundary. Confident stroke"
full and wide outside off and Curran slices it over point this time and beats third-man to his left
"slower ball, made his intention to scoop it obvious, Bumrah shortened his length and Curran ends up lobbing a simple catch to the keeper"

"short ball, hurries onto him, Rahul is late on the hook shot and misses"
"slower ball, full outside off, drilled to long-off and the non striker ensures that Rahul is able to come back for the second and that's a maiden hundred for Rahul in IPL.

"short at middle stump, pulled straight to deep square"
"<b>six first ball!</b> He's not exactly known for a 600 strike rate, is he?! Gritty, solid batsman. But this is a short ball down leg side and he awakens the home crowd - his home crowd - by launching this pull over fine leg"

"<b>takes leg stump!</b> Not a natural in this format or in this position, Lad, and the pressure makes him walk across the stumps and expose them. It's an overpitched ball, one he might have flicked, but he has to sort of reach out and fish at this. Shami is quick. Shami hits the stumps."
"length in the corridor, runs it down to third man with the pace"
<b>yorker</b> nailed at an off stump line. QDK has to bring his bat down quickly to keep this out
"class. Among the best set of wrists meet this short ball outside off. Slanting in at the batsman, and sliced neatly to third man's right"
"<b>dropped!</b> Miller has completely mistimed his jump! At backward point. Short of a length  in the corridor. Looks to punch through cover. Thick outside edge. He jumps very very early and awkwardly sticks out one hand, his left, up above his shoulder and allows this to drop to the floor"

"short of a length on leg stump, flicked past short fine off the back foot"
"length ball outside off, dropped into the point region with soft hands"

It sticks in the pitch a touch and QDK is through the hook early. Gets a glove on it. Rahul makes the ground but can't wrap the gloves around this. Seems in pain of some sort now as well"

"carrom ball at a length outside off, punched on the rise to long-off"
"<b>Miller does it perfectly this time!</b> A top-quality sliding catch, running to his left from long-off. It's a loopy length ball outside off, he steps out and doesn't get to the pitch. Goes through with the loft anyway. It's flat and to Miller's left. He runs IN and also to his left and as he's sliding, he gets in the reverse-cup to hold on. Lovely."

"<B>bouncer</b> right up at Pollard's throat, which takes some effort. Pollard leaps off the turf and drops this into te pitch"

"<strong>that's brilliant from Curran!</strong> After being walloped by Pollard, bowls a full one on the pads, Pollard misses the flick and is struck on the pad, the ball trickles towards the bowler and Ishan Kishan takes off for a suicidal single at the non striker but Curran still has to change direction in his follow through, pick the ball up, turn and throw accurately in one motion and he does all of that with great precision to give the visitors more breathing space"
