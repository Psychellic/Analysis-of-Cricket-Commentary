"shortish, a bit of movement in to cramp the left-hander. Looks to defend off the back foot and inside-edges into his thigh"
"once again a bit of movement, and there's an lbw appeal as it keeps a little low and sneaks under Pant's attempted pull. No footwork from Pant. The ball pitched outside leg and was going further down."

"length ball on off stump, maybe a tiny bit of nip in. Gets on the front foot to push to mid-on"
"back of a length on leg stump, punched to mid-on. I think he's wary of Dinda getting a bit of outswing. Didn't risk closing his face on this, just showed the full face"
"short, but there's a deep square leg in place and he sprints to his left to stop Samson's pull, which he fetched from outside off stump"
"full, perfect outswinger to a right-hander, but to the left-handed Pant it is a wide down the leg side"
"bowled. That's a pretty awful-looking shot from Pant, a big heave across the line. Just a regular length ball angled across to hit the top of off stump"

"back of a length on off and middle, blocked back to the bowler"
"length ball on middle stump, Samson plays a checked drive to mid-on"

"back of a length again, looked like a slower ball, and Samson waits and dabs to the left of third man"
"full-toss at waist height, just above I think, and Nair shows good reactions to take a quick back and across step and swat it away over short fine leg. No-ball signalled"
"full-toss wide of off stump, swinging away, and Nair slogs and misses, and his bat slips out of his grip and goes flying towards the square leg umpire"
"goes wide of the crease and angles a length ball into middle and off, blocked back down the ground, towards mid-on"
"back of a length close to off stump, lets it come on and pokes towards point"
"length ball outside off, and this one nips away a little as Nair shapes to defend, and he adjusts just a little to open his bat face and run it down to the third man boundary. Went off the edge, and finer than he intended, but it was halfway deliberate"
"back of a length outside off, dabbed to third man"
"back of a length on middle and leg, clipped away to the left of deep square leg"
"gone, chipped straight to midwicket. Looked to whip that length ball from an off-stump line, and maybe it stopped on him. Yeah, seemed to, and he ended up popping the simplest of catches to R Ashwin"
"back of a length, turning towards off stump, gets on the back foot to push to long-on"
"tossed up outside off, Duminy gets down low to lap it to the left of short fine leg"
"flighted ball on off stump, gets on the front foot to work it towards deep midwicket"

"down the track and he fires it in full, clipped to midwicket"
"that's turn, and slow turn. Goes on the back foot to a ball that turns from middle stump - was looking to work it into the leg side, ended up defending with the full face"
down the track and clips the straightish ball to long-on

"down the track and this time he's close enough to the pitch of the Bhatia leg-roller to try to hit it over extra cover, but he ends up slicing it squarer than intended, and Thisara takes a good catch running to his right at sweeper cover"
"is that another? This legcutter grips and slides down the leg side as Duminy misses the flick, and he loses balance momentarily. Dhoni has the bails off in a flash, but I'm not sure if he's appealing for caught behind or stumped. He lifted his foot a fraction of an inch, momentarily, but he had it down by the time the bails started flashing, and I think if there was a noise, it was a clip off the outside of his thigh pad"
"fullish outside off, driven to long-off"

"down the track to the flighted ball on off stump, whips it with the turn towards deep midwicket"

again he's out of his crease and he bowls it flat at his pads. Clipped to long-on
a step down the pitch to clip this from outside off to the right of deep square leg

"slower ball on the pads, clipped away through square leg"
"in the blockhole outside off, jabbed to extra cover"
"slower ball on middle and off, driven to long-off"

"fullish on off stump, clipped to long-on"
"yorker close to off stump, jams his bat down on it and sends it rolling gently to mid-off"
"whooooooooooooo, that is a sensational hit. It's fullish on off stump, but not full enough, and this is more wrist that anything, a flat, flat-bat whip that sails over the gap between bowler and mid-off"
"slower bouncer does the trick. Brathwaite fetches the pull from shoulder height, from outside off, and can't clear Thisara on the square leg boundary"
"slower short ball outside off, pulled towards deep midwicket, and that is a super throw from Rahane, flat, accurate, one-bounce, and Dhoni collected an inch over the top of the stumps and did the rest with Duminy a good two feet short of completing his second run"
"short outside off, slapped to deep point"

"back of a length outside off, no turn, chopped towards backward point"

"slower ball outside off and Negi goes down on one knee, slogs, doesn't come anywhere near middling it, and somehow manages to clear long-on"

down the track and again Jayant pulls his length back subtly without firing it in. Clipped to long-on
"down the track, and he picks the right moment to do this, after the field change. The line is outside off, and he can free his arms and loft it over mid-off"
"quickish, back of a length on off stump, no turn. Goes back to cut, maybe, and is cramped for room, and ends up swiping it into the midwicket region"
"shortish, and Khawaja is through his pull too quick, and is hit on the midriff. They try and sneak the single, and Khawaja and Shami collide mid-pitch as Shami tries to get to the ball. He turns around, throws at the bowler's end, and misses with Khawaja only halfway down the pitch"
"shortish on middle stump, and Rahane puts it away with super timing, uses his wrists to pull-whip through square leg"

"back of a length googly outside off, dabbed to short third man"
"lovely, lovely bowling. Floated up slower, and it drops shorter than Khawaja expects as he plays a wavy drive away from his body, and it's the googly, turns away and beats his outside edge as he stretches out. Samson has the bails off quickly, and it goes upstairs, but the back foot was planted firmly enough, with a fair part of it behind the crease"
"quickish, down the leg side. I think Mishra saw him stepping out, and fired it in. He looks to hurriedly whip into the leg side, can't put bat on ball, and it rolls to Samson off his thigh pad, and the keeper fumbles and muffs up a possible stumping"
"length ball on off stump, clipped to deep square leg"
"down the track and Jayant shortens his length nicely outside off, driven down to long-off"

"in the blockhole on middle stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"tossed up outside off, and Tiwary slog-sweeps straight to deep midwicket"

"short slower one outside off, pulled to deep square leg"
"what a catch that is! Dhoni slogged at this flattish length ball, didn't hit it too well, didn't hit it too badly, and it could have gone for six if Sam Billings, running to his right, had not leaped across to pluck it out of the air, above his head, and go tumbling to the ground and come up with the ball still stuck in his hands"
"full outside off, dragged to long-on with a lot of bottom hand"
