But Cremer is coaxed into reviewing. <strong>Was there a nick?</strong> Mighty close to the bat. There is a spike as the ball passes the bat on UltraEdge, and that should be plenty evidence to overturn this decision. Mire's maiden Test wicket. And what a ball to do so, pulled that length back, and what it did was leave Hope tentative - whether to come forward or go back.

Definitely off the pad, was it off the face of the bat? Yes, there is a spike on UltraEdge and the on-field not-out decision should be overturned. Not a bit spike, but there is enough to suggest that the ball clipped the inside edge onto the pad. Two fantastic reviews from Zimbabwe. Ervine took a sharp, low catch, running to his left.
