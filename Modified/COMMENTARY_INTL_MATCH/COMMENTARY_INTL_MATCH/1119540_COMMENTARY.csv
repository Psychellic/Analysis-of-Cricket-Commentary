"curling into the pads, a bit of an ambitious single but Buttler's shy from behind the stumps is about as hopeless as you'll ever see in international cricket"
"curling away from the left-hander, two slips in place as Head leans forward to defend"
"width, more swing, driven off a fat under-edge, out through square leg"

tucked to the leg side
"back of a length, Wood falls over in his followthrough, but he's delivered the ball nicely into the channel. Poked to point"

worked to leg
tapped into the covers

"on the pads, nurdled to the midwicket sweeper"

flicked to leg once more to bring up the 100
"keeps low as it slides in from outside off, chopped through point"
"a dirty half-tracker, and <B>tanked straight to the man at deep midwicket!</B> Head is aghast, what a gruesome way to give it away. The long-hop lures him out of his cautious mindset, he seeks to clear the rope, and England have their opening!"
"stays over the wicket, tossed up and tapped back down the track"
"flighted, chipped to the left of the bowler, bump ball"

"flighted, comes across on off and drives for one"
"floated up full on leg stump, March whips one down the ground"

pushed through and defended
swatted away over midwicket! Moeen drops short and Marsh rocks back to heave it over the infield for four more

"outside off, a thick outside edge, through to third man"
"solidly onto the front foot, and walloped to mid-off. There's been a lot of that today, technically correct drives straight to the fielder. Oodles of respect for the bowling"
flipped to the leg side
"<B>bowled him!</B> That is a beauty from Wood, shaping in, just a hint of reverse maybe, skidding through Stoinis's half-cocked defences. Had he got forward he might have had more chance ... of lbw"

"swept, from a very tight line. Got enough bat on it in the end, but that would have been very adjacent!"
"round the wicket, full length, Marsh has a stand-and-deliver swing, and a spiralling top-edge plugs behind the bowler's head. An ugly mow"

"round the wicket, pumped down the ground, back past Wood's outstretched hand"
"rolls the fingers on a full-length delivery on leg stump, slashed into the off side. A good over"

"Agar advances, Rashid sees him coming, adjusts his length. Well bowled"

clipped to the leg side once more
"big swing across the line, hits the pad, and <B>England review!</B> It was turning, so may have done too much. Let's see... <strong>umpire's call, top of leg stump</strong>. Close!"

"googly, starts wide, spins wider"
"<B>absolutely battered!</B> He picked that googly with no problems, a massive wipe across the line and deep into the stands at cow corner"
"shorter, wider, pushed out of the front of the hand, and just helped behind square"
"fuller length, smeared along the deck to deep midwicket"
"hooned through the covers, this is a terrific turn of pace from the hobbling Marsh. Cracking it on the up to ruin Rashid's figures"
thumped out to the deep
"smashed high over the leg side, and up comes <strong>Shaun Marsh's second hundred of the series!</strong> Absolutely brilliant acceleration in the later stages of his innings, and it's a 91-ball hundred, which is useful in any context"
"low full toss, swinging into the toes, and <strong>Carey holes out to deep midwicket!</strong> He nailed it, to be fair, but straight to the man."
"<B>stunning from Roy on the long-on boundary!</B> Another massive wind-up, it dips late on the boundary's edge, where Roy clings on, running towards the rope. He has the presence of mind to pick out Craig Overton ten metres away, running round from midwicket, his team-mate accepts the side-handed lob, and that is Willey on a hat-trick!"
cracked to mid-off to survive the hat-trick ball
thumped out to deep midwicket
"edged, gone, and it's three in the over! Who says Willey isn't a death bowler? Neser makes room outside leg, feathers his off-side slap and Australia are subsiding rapidly"

"attempted yorker, tailing into the pads, chiselled round the corner to bring up the 300"

"well bowled again, a pinpoint yorker, nothing for Paine to do but dig it out"

crunched out to deep cover
"rolls the fingers on another attempted yorker, chopped out to backward point"
"smeared along the ground to long-on, lining up the outswing and connecting well enough"
"round the wicket, angled into the pads, and <strong>Willey strikes again!</strong> Another slog across the line, but was he struck outside the line? Paine can't be bothered to review... but that was umpire's call ... very marginal!"
"slammed high in the air, who wants this? <B>Willey wants this!</B> He sprints out to midwicket, but can't quite reach it to complete his five-for"
"length ball, fizzes through a wild swing"
"cracked airily out to cover, where Morgan pounces with one hand, which briefly discombobulates Richardson. But he gets back safely"
"thumped to cover, and that's the end of Australia's spirited innings"
"short and on the hip, Roy clips it firmly away, past the dive of short fine leg for four off the first ball! Well, I suppose Finch did the same"

"good length on off, defended this time"
"touch too full, that's stroked for four more! Leans into the shot, all timing back down the ground... England into their stride"
good length and punched back to the bowler
"pitched up and smashed through the covers again, YJB eases the boundary count on by one"
comes across and pushes a length ball into the off side
"slams into the back leg, Neser goes up... but Michael Gough shakes his head! Maybe nipping down the leg side? Ah, perhaps some inside edge on it, too"
turned into the midwicket area
"full outside off, YJB throws the hands but doesn't connect cleanly and the ball dribbles to cover"
"banged in, too quick for Roy on the pull... but nevermind, <b>his top-edge flies all the way over fine leg for six!</b> Safe option, with no one outside the ring down there"
"dug in back of a length, Roy rides the bounce"
"straighter line, Roy blocks it back down the track"
"touch short, angling in with the arm, tucked defensively into the leg side"
"too full, that's in the slot again and Roy skewers it through the covers for another boundary. Ho hum"
"back of a length, rising up towards the hip, Ropy only needs to tuck it away on the pull and it races to fine leg for four more!"

"fullish, on the stumps and worked towards mid-on"

"floated up, punched to cover coming across"
"flighted, spinning in and worked towards mid-on, it's a tight single but Roy calls it and looks to be home... although the throw is wayward"
"back of a length, rasped into the off side and they pinch one with the fielder back"
"on the pads, that's a poor ball with no protection and Bairstow just calmly fiddles it away to the fine leg boundary - <b>that's the England 50 up</b>, lickety-split"
"fullish, middle and leg stump, clipped through midwicket"
"on the legs again, Roy doesn't have to exert himself in glancing four more through backward square"
"shot! That is dismissive from Roy, coming forward to a back-of-a-length delivery and he just throws the hands through a punch past point"
on the stumps and tucked for one

"pushed through, beats the outside edge and Paine whips off the bails... they are going to check upstairs, Roy did shift his back foot fractionally but I don't think it was in the air at the time. No, Dharmasena's happy he was in"
