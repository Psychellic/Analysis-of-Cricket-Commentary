"length on leg stump, nudged to fine leg's left"
"short and just outside off, cut straight to cover point"
"<b>misfield</b>  from short fine and deep square hares to the left as if the reputation of the tournament itself is in his hands. Looks like Salt out there, with a slide to his left and push back in. Waqas with the misfield as Zaman flicked this straight to him from a good length"
short and up the ribs. Can't get bat on the flick
"length and pushed across off stump, tapped to extra cover"
"overpitched outside off, drilled firmly towards mid-off where Rizwan gets down with the barrier to field and gets hit on the soft part of his knee. He's hobbling off now"

"<b>slapped</b> over mid-off. Length outside off, skids on nicely and there's a lot of room. Just hits through the line with an angled bat"

"length on leg stump, flicked straight to midwicket"
"full on middle stump, steps out and yorks himself. Taps it back towards the bowler"
<b>smoked it!</b> Full on middle stump. Doesn't step out this time. Gets into the leg side to make room and a clean swing on the slog sweep
"beaten in flight but big swing again. Length on middle stump, loses his shape as he slugs this off the inside part of the bat. No one at the midwicket fence"
"yorker at leg stump, flicked to long-on's left"
length and slanting into him as he backs away into the leg side. He keeps going and swings through the line to get this wide of long-on

"yorker length at leg stump, flicked to fine leg"
"length on leg stump, flicked to deep square"
length and cramping him at leg stump as he stays tall to keep the room. Pokes it down the pitch
can't cramp him this time. Full and into his body as he's moving down leg. But the fuller length allows for a flick and this races through midwicket
yorker. Nicely executed. Straight at the front toe and he can't do more than jam this out
"length on middle stump, behind the line to try and flick, but closes the face too early. Back to the bowler off the leading edge"
"length outside off, jabbed to backward point"
"short of a length on leg stump, whipped to deep midwicket off the back foot"
length ball down leg side. Looks to pick this behind square leg but can't connect on it. Deflected off the keeper

"length on leg stump, turned into the square leg region off the inside edge"

"length on leg stump, pushed into the midwicket region with soft hands"

shot. But sweeper there. Short of a length just outside off and a cracking punch on the rise
"short and wide outside off, pulls off the inside half to long-on"
short ball jumps up from off stump. He's cramped on the pull and it lands on the pitch
"pumped! Overpitched on off stump, doesn't even bother putting the front foot out for this. Stays put and slams it past the bowler"
length ball outside off. Skips into the leg side to make some extra room and scythes this behind point with an open face
length ball into the pads. Stays tall and dabs it off the inside half. Short fine dives to the left but can only parry it into the boundary
"short of a length on off, whipped to deep square. <b>Fifty for Fakhar Zaman.</b> His 11th in the format"
short and skidding through quickly outside off. Stabs at it and is beaten

"short and just outside off, cut straight to point...whose unnecessary gives them a single at deep square"
"short of a length on middle stump, backs away and pulls to deep midwicket"
short ball in the corridor. Looks like a slower one. He slashes on top of it and is beaten on the under-edge
doesn't miss this! Short and up at his chest. Gets on his back toe and whips to deep square's right. A sliding stop there from Delport
"<b>review for catch behind</b> by Sohail. He was looking to play the hook and was cramped. Looked like it came off the helmet as he looked to back down the leg side and hit that...was there an edge before that though? Yes there was! He is gone. As is the review. Replays confirm the right decision was made. A good innings from Sohail  nonetheless, he's given Lahore a superb start to the season"
"it's a slower short ball, which he picks up like a love note wafting into his path, and taps it to deep third man"
tries to whip it over square leg with the ball pitching on a length on leg stump. Will be annoyed he didn't send the people in the stands scurrying
"<b>beats him</b>! Many reckon he's one of the best to ever play the game but here he's done in like a rookie. Shadab gets dip. He gets turn. He has AB reaching in front of his body, panicked into playing against the turn, and is lucky not to get out"
makes room outside leg and cracks a googly to deep cover point
just stays within the offside tram lines as Shadab tries to keep away from Fakhar's bat-swing
goes off the toe-end as Shadab keeps bowling wide outside off and Fakhar keeps trying to swing across the line
pushes it through - the one that spins into AB again - and he doesn't quite make contact with the flick
"sets up in a crouch to deal with a short ball, but he's unable to clear the boundary. Only a single to long-on"
"lashes it to the point boundary! All he needs is pace on the ball and he perks right up. Course this is short and wide so really he had to put it away, if only to prove he's not an imposter"
"heaves it to the square leg boundary! Stands still, winds up, and de-ruddy-well-livers. Too short from Talat again"
"pitches it a little further up, but at his pace, de Villiers is lining him up like those carnival shooting games. BANG! Slog to deep square leg again"
launches it over extra cover! He's on the front foot. He sees room to free the arms. He gets a little taller because there's a touch more bounce than he likes. Mid-off is up. And he just lifts it over the man
"steps away from his crease, Talat follows him and as a result, the pull shot only results in a single to deep midwicket"
"bye-bye baby! It's length again. Straight into the merciless golf swing - he's had plenty of time to practice those after retirement. Yo fans at midwicket, pick it up and toss it back!"
straight down the ground! And it's maaaaasssssive! Shadab errs by looping the ball a little too much and Fakhar winds up and wallops it over the leggie's head
"fires it in flat and quick, Fakhar whisks it to deep midwicket"
backs away and lofts the full delivery outside off over the covers but there's protection out there
"goes round the stumps and may have sneaked in the offbreak! Lands on a length, Fakhar goes for the sweep, but misses"
"taken at point! Excellent bowling from Shadab! He sees Fakhar's petulant stray down the track. Throws it wide of the left-hander's reach, who still looks to drag it from way outside off stump into the leg side, and pays for the mistake. Miscue lobs up and lands in a diving Rizwan's hands"
"pushes it through on off stump, de Villiers works it to long-on"
"full and wide outside off, de Villiers rather mercifully taps it to cover"
"shortish and outside off, chops it to point. Looks like Islamabad are working on the principle of denying AB any pace on the ball"
goes back and flicks the length ball from round the stumps to deep midwicket
straying onto the pads and AB whips it behind square leg
turns the pitched-up delivery through midwicket
"looks like the legcutter, but it doesn't even pretend to turn. AB taps it down to long-on"
goes for the cut but there's not enough room for it and so he chops it into the covers
"slower ball, outside off, with no room, leaving Devcich with little choice but to dab through point"
"taken at long-off! Brilliant effort on the boundary, moving back, leaping up over his left shoulder, both hands high up and a split second later, the ball sticks in them. Sussex's Phillip Salt has just broken the internet. Or well, close enough. And AB, having looked in good touch, is deceived by a slower ball, his loft intended to carry over the boundary not quite reaching its destination"
nudges a back of a length delivery through midwicket
"fullish on off stump, Taylor blocks behind point"
"another slower ball, and Devcich, having got into position to pull it too early, has to adjust his bat swing and settle for a single to square leg"
"full on middle, drums it down the ground, and Asif Ali is at long-on, diving full-length to his right and stopping the boundary"
"hares down the track, putting his own pace if the bowler doesn't give him any, but yet he ends up reaching out for the ball and miscuing it to deep midwicket"
"looks for the blockhole and is rewarded with an inside edge, which he has to watch trickle down to long leg and become runs against his name. Ugh, cruel game"
flicks a full delivery on middle to long-on
lofts the full ball on the stumps to long-on
"premeditates a sweep, looking to help the ball away to fine leg, but Delport benefits by keeping a wicket-to-wicket line with his change of pace deliveries and the little legbreak pins Taylor in front"
"the hop skip and jump down the track just isn't working. Maqsood spots it, sneaks in a bouncer and secures a top-edged swipe to long leg"
"full and outside off, he steers it to deep third man"
slogs a length ball outside off to deep midwicket
holds his shape so well! It's a short ball angled across him and he waits just that little bit longer - he needs to on a slow pitch - and then cracks it to the right of point and to the left of the sweeper. Brilliant batting
a little cut off the pitch ruins Brathwaite's launch down the ground. The offcutter working its magic
"nails the wide yorker, which Brathwaite slices to deep third man"
starts with a wide yorker that Brathwaite isn't able to touch.
"premeditates the scoop aaaaaand it's caught by a backtracking square leg. <b>Out to a full toss</b>. One that gives him plenty of room to free the hands and heft it over the covers. But having committed to playing on the leg side, he ends up top-edging to Talat"
"<b>dropped</b> by Samit running back at fine leg. He does well to track the ball over his shoulder, gets both hands to it, but in the end it pops out. Unfortunate for Faheem, whose variations have been on point tonight. This bit of shenanigans is the result of a slower bouncer which Devcich doesn't quite pick up properly and so miscues his pull"
"whips it to the square leg boundary. Majestic batting from the Lahore captain, stepping into the middle and sending his first ball into the gap and away for four"
<b>is Devcich run-out?</b>. Yep. He's called through for a leg bye after Hafeez misses a pull shot and gets struck somewhere near the armpit but is a bit slow to respond and even a full length dive can't save him from Ashraf's direct hit
"another slower short ball, another batsman through with the pull shot too early, another hit on the body. Except there's no run-out."
takes on the short ball and dumps it into the stands behind deep midwicket. <b>Monster hit</b>
backs away and pulls the short ball to long-on
keeps his balance and swings the back of a length delivery out to deep midwicket
"nicely done - both from the bowler and then from Ronchi, underarming the ball at the stumps and breaking them. It's funny really. Yasir's barely moved from his position as the batsman but replays shows Hafeez is already there, within handshaking distance, and as a result of that, he's the one that's out. The batsmen didn't cross so Yasir has to go"
swings the back of a length ball out to deep midwicket
"full, straight, Afridi plays all around it and is out lbw. Just too quick for him. But wait, the replay <i>seems</i> to suggest he may have been struck outside the line of off stump"
<b>wide of mid-on</b> and four straight away! Length ball with some late swing back in. Cramped a touch but he goes through and lifts it over the circle
"<b>superb fielding!</b> To start with, anyway. Shoaib flying to his right to stop at cover. On on replay that's a <b>dropped catch</b> as well, but he's done stunningly to even get a hand on this. Length outside off, slapped uppishly to his right. He gets a hand on it and throws at the non-striker's end where they get an overthrow"
"length on off stump, stays still in the crease and uses his hands to drag this over the bowler"
"length on leg stump, whipped to fine leg"
"oh nicely timed, but straight to extra cover. Length and pushed across off stump. Slams on the rise with bent knees"
<b>see ya!</b> What a shot! Runs down the pitch at an inswinger that is down leg side. Doesn't lean in - just trusts the bounce and whips the wrists to send this over the midwicket boundary
"back of a length and outside off, he fishes for it and nothing comes up"
""
"goes searching for the ball outside off with a cut shot, but can't reach it"
punches the shortish delivery to cover
"drives down the ground, softly enough to pinch a single to mid-off"
"he's hit on the thigh as he tries to pull a shortish delivery away. And since he's also out of his crease as well, he has to put the pain behind him and rush back to safety"
"appeal for lbw, with Ronchi not quite liking the ball on the in-between length, where he can't pull it, nor drive it. And since there's no room either all he can do is flap across the line and get hit on the pad"
"<b>ramps it</b> to the third man boundary. Splendid batting as he picks up the short ball early, sways his body out of the way and then presents the bat up for it to ping off"
flays it through point! The angle from round the wicket doesn't help Afridi one bit. He still offers room - well room enough for Ronchi who takes guard on leg stump to open up the off side - and he hits through the line like a boss
"yorker on middle, Ronchi just about gets the bat down in time and finds a single at square leg. Outstanding response from young Afridi"
nudges a back of a length delivery off his pads to short fine leg
tries an on-the-up drive but he's beaten all ends up by an offcutter. Lucky it's just a shade outside the line of the stumps
"another pin-point yorker, which Ronchi is somehow able to spirit away to long-on. Excellent finish to the over. Only three runs after the first couple of balls were walloped for fours"
comes down the track and pummels the short ball to the square leg boundary. The new ball is the best time to score runs on this pitch and Ronchi's certainly not holding back
"full on middle, Ronchi swings hard, but it bounces off his pads to square leg"
backs away and carves the short and wide delivery to the point boundary. Outrageous timing
slower ball but it sits up to be lofted over long-on. Too full. In the slot. Dispatched
"pulls his length back, gets a little more pace into it as well, and with very little room on hand, Rizwan can only find mid-on"
swings the short ball out to midwicket
hangs back to the short ball and cuts it strongly to the right of point. Diving stop from Sohail there keeps it to a single
whips a quick and flat delivery to square leg
punches the pushed-through delivery outside off to mid-off
"wicket-to-wicket and Ronchi, even as he tries to make room, can only push it to cover"
pulls the quick and short delivery on middle to deep midwicket
"full and outside off, drives to mid-off"
<b>taken at mid-off!</b> This length ball holds its line in the corridor as Rizwan looks to club into the leg side. Comes off the outside part of the bat and hangs up for Hafeez to take that
"<b>two in two!</b> Terrible ball, but Ronchi has managed to drag it straight to short fine. Short ball down leg side, there for the pull. He takes it on but can't get it over the fielder"
"<b>past the outside edge.</b> Length ball pushed wide outside off, slashes at it and is beaten"
"length on off stump, defended to point off the back foot"
"<b>through the covers.</b> Full ball just outside off, gets his weight into this shot and opens the face late to bisect cover point and extra"
"<b>straight to extra cover this time!</b> Oh dear. That is ordinary batting throughout this over. Length ball outside off, chucks his bat at this without too much feet. Slightly away from the body, no attempt to keep this down. Ends up slicing a simple catch"
"length at off stump, punched to long-off"

"short of a length outside off, punched to extra cover's right"
"length on off stump, reverse sweep nailed. But straight to point"
"<b>missed run-out chance</b> because of a poor throw from AB. That's rare. Length at off stump, steps out and taps to extra cover's left. AB gets to the ball and Delport isn't even halfway up to the striker's end. But the throw is woefully wide"
"short of a length on middle, mistimed pull to deep midwicket"
"length on middle, punched to deep midwicket with the angle"
"length on midde, looks to tap through the off side, gets an inside edge to midwicket"
"length on middle, tapped to long-on's left"

"length on middle, whipped to deep midwicket with the angle"
"length on leg, driven to long-on"
"full outside off, makes room and drives to extra cover"

full and just outside off. Late on the drive. Ends up slicing it to sweeper cover
"length down leg side. Looks to flick, cops it on the front pad"
full and just outside off. Shuffles and drives on the rise. Can't get it past AB at mid-off. A dive to the left from him
"<b>over fine leg.</b> Just helped along with the pace. Short and up at middle stump. Swipes from underneath this and is not in control, but it's just enough bat to clear the boundary"
"full on middle stump, gets down and paddles to short fine"

"<b>he's got a fourth!</b> Can you believe it?! Four wickets in seven balls, incredible. And what a time to pick this one up too. Delport had just begun getting it right. Length ball at off stump, looks to drill it straight. Bat turns in his hand and it is high and lobbed for extra cover, who jogs to the right and holds on. <b>On a hat-trick again.</b>"
"<b>just past point!</b> So close. Short and wide outside off, throws his hands at this and gets it to point's right. His one-handed leap doesn't get him there"

"length on leg stump, flicked to short fine's right"
"short of a length on leg stump, nudged through square leg off the back foot"
<b>straight to short fine!</b> Talat does himself in over here. Moved too early for the attempted ramp. Bowler saw him and got a short slower ball in. It was rising on him by the end and there was no pace on it. Lobbed straight to that fielder

spanked! Clean hitting. Short ball up at off stump. Gets under this and lifts it over deep midwicket who is pedaling backwards

"yorker just outside off, past the outside edge as he looks to jam it to third man"

<b>inswinging yorker</B> at leg stump. Can't do more with that than hitting it onto his own boot
"<b>almost gets the fifth!</b> But Devcich can't hold on with a sensational effort at long-off. Offcutter, at a length outside off. Slammed on the up, flat. Devcich leaps and parries it over the rope. Tries to drag it back into play but he can't quite manage it"
