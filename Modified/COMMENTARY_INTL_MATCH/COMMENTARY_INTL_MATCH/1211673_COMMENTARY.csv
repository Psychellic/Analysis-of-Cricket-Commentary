But wait... after Faf du Plessis walks out the umpires want to check if the ball had hit the Spider-cam wire in that shot. If it did, then it's a dead ball and Maqsood will survive. Nope, nothing conclusive, so we shall carry on. #Drama"

"<B>that's outta here!</b> Good length, on middle, and he swivels before clubbing a pull over the fielder at deep midwicket!"
"<B>appeal for caught behind</b> and the umpire raises his finger late. But <B>du Plessis reviews</b> immediately. This was a ball just outside off, close to his body, and he tries to run it fine, but the ball goes to the keeper instead. Was there an edge on the way to the keeper? Doesn't look like, and maybe the sound came from bat hitting the pad, but there's also a second sound according to snicko when the ball is near the bat. Out or not? Umpire has a difficult call to make... and he gives it out! That's because the snicko showed sound when the bat wasn't near the pad. Great decision by umpire Shozab Raza. Zalmi lose a review"
