"starts with a wide length ball outside off, an inch or so inside the tramline. Left alone"
"back of a length, angling in towards off stump and maybe straightening slightly. Defends after shuffling across, and gets a thick outside edge down to third man"
"length ball slanting across into a fourth-stump line, defended towards cover point"
"back of a length on middle and off, defended into the on side"
"bowled him! He strikes in the first over yet again. No footwork from Sadeera against a length ball that comes in ever so slightly, towards middle and off, and he plays all around it. Maybe shaped to drive on the up at first, through mid-off or cover, and then ended up trying to adjust for the movement and play into the on side, but he only managed to leave a big gap, with his front leg going nowhere, and Usman says thank you very much"
"full outside off, and Usman Khan is on a hat-trick! An excellent ball to the new batsman, slanting it away from off stump, inviting the drive away from his body, and he went for it without getting his front foot across, and only manages to nick it to Sarfraz, who takes a low catch tumbling to his right"
"length ball slanting across towards off stump. Looks to drive into the covers, plays too early, and drags it to the bowler off the inside half of the bat"
"length ball slanting away from off stump, left alone. A bit of extremely late swing towards Sarfraz's right just as the ball reaches him, and he does well to adjust for it"

"length ball on middle stump, clipped to long leg"
"back of a length, slanting across towards off stump, gets back and across to defend"

"and Tharanga leans into a sweetly timed drive. Fullisj outside off, nice front-foot stride ensures he gets close to the pitch of the ball, and he frees his arms and strokes it through cover point"
"length ball angling into off stump, tucked away, with the angle, through backward square leg"
"bowled him, how good is this man! That skiddy, slippery pace, and it nips in from outside off stump, from the perfect length, and it's through the gate before Tharanga knows it. He was stuck on the crease, looking to whip that through midwicket, and next thing he knew was the sound of the stumps rattled. Great seam position - he's generating this movement because of how much backspin he puts on it."
"back of a length outside off, dabbed to backward point"
"big appeal, and it's given! Goes wide of the crease and angles it into the stumps, and Dickwella's head falls over as he plays all across it. He's reviewed, though... That dramatic angle in, plus a bit of inward movement - will this hit the stumps? No inside edge. Impact in line with middle stump, and ball-tracking says it's clipping the outside of leg stump, umpire's call, so Dickwella has to walk back. Four wickets in 11 balls for Usman Khan Shinwari. Remember the name, and all that"
"length ball fairly wide of off, left alone"
"length ball slanting away in the corridor, nips away slightly off the seam and beats Thirimanne's uncertain push"
"similar ball to the previous one, slightly shorter, left alone"

"length ball angling in towards off stump, defended towards mid-on"
"fullish outside off, punched into the covers"
"shot! That's a good-length ball, and he drives it on the up to the cover point boundary. A slight bit of width, and he gets a strong stride in, and lets the ball get as close to him as possible before meeting it"
"back of a length angling down leg, looks to flick it away but it zips through and hits his hip and Sarfraz, moving to his right, can't collect cleanly and concedes a leg-bye"
"back of a length, angling in towards off stump. Doesn't get back and across to defend, just jabs with his hands, and the ball hits the inside half of his bat and rolls into the leg side"
"fullish on off stump, driven back towards the bowler"
"shortish, angling across to off stump, gets a bit of extra bounce. Drops his bottom hand and defends close to his body to keep it down"
"fuller now, not quite a half-volley, but the angle provides him some width, and he takes a short step forward and plays an all-hands drive, with an open face, through point. Excellent timing"
"back of a length, pitching outside leg. Looks to flick but can't connect, and it hits his front pad"
"ooh. Length ball angling in towards off stump. He's a little late coming onto the front foot. Wants to drive into the covers, plays away from his body, and inside-edges past his leg stump"
"back of a length, angling into off and middle. Shuffles across to clip watchfully to midwicket"
"length ball, fifth-stump line. Doesn't quite time his drive, rolls slowly to extra-cover"
"shortish outside off, the inward angle narrows his room a little, and he chops it down to cover point"
"full, a bit of width, and what a way to get your fifth wicket. The softest dismissal for Siriwardana, just reaches away from his body to drive, plays a touch too early, and scoops a simple catch to cover point. This is only Usman's fourth over!"
"a touch too straight, tucked off the pads to fine leg"
"bouncer, angling down leg, and it takes off steeply as Thirimanne ducks, and the keeper isn't tall enough or blessed with a big-enough jump to be able to save four more wides"
"back of a length on off stump, defended into the covers"
"back of a length, a bit of inward movement towards off stump, defended off the back foot to midwicket"
"fullish, wide of off, reaches out with an open bat-face to half-deliberately steer it to third man"
"length ball close to off stump, defended back towards the bowler"
"back of a length close to off stump, opens his bat face and guides it down towards third man, who has some distance to cover to his right, and they steal a second. Still has to dive to complete the second, and he's just in. <b>Or is he?</b> He's diving in, his bat is past the crease, it's only a quarter-inch from the ground, but is it touching the ground when the bails go off? The third umpire thinks so"
"back of a length, angling into the stumps, tucked away through backward square leg"
"back of a length outside off, defended into the covers"
"bouncer, Prasanna ducks under. Was definitely over head-high when it passed the batsman"
"length ball angling in towards off stump, defended towards mid-on"

"back of a length, slanting across to off stump, defended into the covers"
"length ball, fuller than the previous one, angling across to off stump. Stays on the back foot regardless, and defends towards midwicket"
"oh man, nearly another wicket! A full-toss outside leg, and Prasanna swiped at it, managing only a top-edge that looped to the left of Malik at fine leg. Bounces before he can get to it"
"length ball outside off, and that's beautiful from Thirimanne. He's been moving forward a lot more confidently than any of his team-mates, and he transfers his weight at the perfect moment to send this on-the-up drive racing away between extra-cover and mid-off"
"length ball on off stump, defended towards mid-on"
"length ball slanting in towards off stump, defended into the off side"
"length ball curving in late towards middle and off, defended to midwicket off the inside half of the bat"

"fuller on middle stump, clipped to square leg, and Imad gets through a maiden"
"change of angle works instantly! back of a length outside off, Thirimanne plays with an angled bat, looking to guide it to third man, and only manages an outside edge to the keeper. Usman will not pick up a ten-fer today."
"good length on middle and leg, worked away through midwicket for one."

"the response is a short delivery around off, 81 mph, Thisara gets underneath that"
"a slower delivery outside off, tapped away towards backward point for a quick single. But Prasanna is in a terrible position, he looks to evade the ball that's coming at him but doesn't bother about grounding his bat. The fielder throws the stumps down directly at the batsman's end, and he's gone. At point of impact, bat and stumps, Prasanna has turned his head away, looking at midwicket for the left-hander. If he kept his focus on grounding his bat, and not the ball hurtling towards him, he would have made it easily. The bat is in the air and SL are seven down."
"full and straight, hit back to the bowler, Hasan picks up and hurls a throw in the corridor outside off, Vandersay lets that one go"
"overpitched and straight, driven down to long-on for one"

"the googly, quick on middle and leg, blocked back"
"taken at long-off, Thisara's brief cameo ends. The googly outside off, Thisara looks to hit that straight but the problem with that is there is enough room for the ball to spin because Shadab's length isn't too full, the ball spins away, takes the outside half and lobs towards long-off. The fielder runs in and takes an easy enough catch"
"short and wide outside off, the ball spins away, Vandersay misses a cut"
"driven back to the bowler, a touch too full"
"a googly, down leg, Vandersay misses a flick and he is struck in front of leg, but umpire Ravi feels that was sliding down. <strong>Sarfraz reviews</strong>. An excellent review, because that's very close. No bat, but there are three reds on HawkEye and so Vandersay's gone. The googly does the trick again."
"129 kph, good length outside off, defended into the off side"
"full and straight, 134 kph, pushed towards mid-on. Nice defensive technique"
"shortish and wide outside off, Chameera tries to cut but the gulf in skill is too high. The ball goes past"
"changes the length does Usman, the short delivery on leg, Chameera gets underneath that"
"full and wide, Chameera sees width and goes after a drive, it skews off the outside half of the bat, over the sweeper cover for four"

"on a length around leg, worked into the gap at midwicket for a couple. SL inching towards 100"
"fullish delivery outside off, pushed away to mid-off"
"another slower delivery on leg, flicked into the gap at midwicket. Don't think there should have been two there, but Hasan picks up, throws the ball towards the bowler's end and misses. <strong>Out if he hit direct</strong>"
"the legbreak outside off, beaten by a big distance"
"lots of flight, lulling Fernando into an expansive drive, but the ball goes past the edge"
"the googly this time, around off, defended into the off side"
"oh yes, fine shot. Short and wide outside off, Fernando goes back and nails a drive through cover. Sublime timing. 100 up"
"the googly outside off, Fernando goes back and carves a cut towards third man"
"another googly, on leg, inside-edged into the pad"
"85 mph, full and straight, the ball moving back in, driven to mid-on"

"fullish on off stump, blocked back towards the bowler"
"length ball, a bit of swing in towards middle stump, tucked away to long leg - played around his front pad a little on that occasion, but leaned over the ball and played it under his eyes"
"length ball on off stump, and he uses Chameera's angle to make himself some room and punch through cover point"
"length ball angling away from off stump, the angle provides Zaman some width, and that's a monstrous flat-bat slap that goes to the cover point boundary in a flash"
"length ball angling into off stump, defended towards mid-on"
"back of a length outside off, stabbed to backward point"
"good ball, some swing away from the left-hander from a good length outside off. Goes for the cover drive and the ball beats his outside edge"
similar ball to the previous one - this time Imam leaves it alone

"back of a length outside off, again Imam's outside edge is beaten by some swing as he looks to stand still and punch through the covers"
"and again. Not a big enough stride to get close to the pitch of the ball, looks for the angled-bat drive, and the ball curves past his outside edge again"
"wow. He's beaten him for the fourth time in the over. This is back of a length, angling in and forcing him to play, and then snaking away late. Looks to defend off the back foot and the ball slides past that outside edge again"
"full outside off, driven back firmly to the bowler"

"full delivery outsider off, 87 mph, hit into the off side with bad timing"
"good single. Good length around off, driven towards mid-on with soft hands for a quick single."
"back of a length outside off, punched to backward point"
"back of a length, this time Fernando gets the ball to nip back in off the seam. Looks to adjust late and work into the on side but all he can manage is an inside-edge into pad"
"he's had enough of Fernando making him push and prod, and he jumps down the track, gets some width, and smacks it up and over the covers"
"big appeal for lbw as Imam plays around that front pad again. The ball seemed to be sliding down leg - maybe an inside edge too, because umpire S Ravi doesn't signal leg byes"

"back of a length, angling into off stump. Stays leg-side of the ball, looking to punch through the off side, but the inward angle forces him to play it back towards the bowler, off the inner half of his bat"
"length ball on off stump, punched to mid-on. They chance a single even though it didn't go too far from the fielder, and a direct hit at the bowler's end would have had the diving Fakhar in a lot of trouble. Thirimanne, however, misses the stumps"
"length ball on middle and off, blocked back down the pitch"

"that's a poor shot. Much fuller this time, and it turns a bit so it's not far outside off stump at all. Goes back for that back-cut again and the ball beats his outside edge"

A googly outside off, generates so much extra bounce, Zaman picks it and looks to dab a cut down to third man but all he can do is feather that through to the keeper.
