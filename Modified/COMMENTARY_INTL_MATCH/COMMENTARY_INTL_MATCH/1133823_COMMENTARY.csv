nudges it off his pads to midwicket to get the score ticking
"back of a length, angling the ball across the right-hander, Liton blocks"
"drifts down the leg side, easy call for umpire Palliyaguruge"
"glides it down to third man, off the back foot"
flicks it off his hips to deep square leg. Looks like Unadkat is pretty happy banging the new ball into the pitch.
works the back of a length ball around his front pad to deep square leg
"stamp the Tamim trademark on that, and then send it back please! Shifts inside the line of the short ball from over the wicket and flick-pulls it, with his front leg up in the air, with grrrreeeeat style"
"loops it up outside off, Liton taps it down to long-on"
"a little bit of drift into the left-hander, and that's enough to catch Tamim playing outside the line."
"<b>appeal for lbw</b>, but it comes only from the close-in fielders. Washington doesn't even bother, because he knows the good length ball hitting Tamim as he defends would be sliding down with the angle from around the wicket, it"
shifts his weight back to pull the flatter delivery to the right of deep midwicket. Good hustle from Rahul to stop the boundary
"pushes it through full on leg stump, Tamim works it to deep midwicket"
"a perfectly straight ball - pitched up, but not far enough to be a half-volley - forces a tame, almost defeated block. Liton had lunged forward with such happy thoughts, only to be foiled"
"on the pads again and Tamim whips it away to deep square leg. The ball seems to take ages to get there, and Pandey chasing it down has to put in a big dive"
"races down the pitch and slashes the length ball over point. Unadkat tries his best to keep it wide of Liton's reach, to perhaps try and one-up him. But to little avail"
drills a full-length delivery down to mid-off
taps a back of a good length ball into the midwicket region
"walks across his stumps, draws the bowler's fire, and then gently lifts the ball over square leg"
flicks a good length ball on off stump through to deep square leg
"drifts into leg stump, Tamim glances it fine, but there's a man there for the shot"
"<b>top edge and it's taken</b>! Beautiful work from Washington! All he does is plant the ball on a length, a shade outside off. Liton therefore thinks he has the room to free his arms and goes for the slog sweep. But the trick here is the slowness of pace. And the preciseness of length. It pitches just before the bat swings, and then bounces over the middle to take the edge. Lovely stuff."
"brings out the reverse sweep, but the lack of pace from the bowler means the ball barely goes off the square"
"<b>the straighter one</b> and it beats Sabbir all ends up. He's stuck in the crease, not sure how it will spin, and when it does hold its line, he goes searching for it."
"increases his pace now, the line on middle stump, cramping Sabbir as he flicks ti midwicket"
"gets forward to block and once again Washington has wrapped up two overs with virtually no runs.. oh, and a wicket."
"slog sweep, which is a decent option to a flat delivery on leg stump. But India have protection at square leg"
"<b>what a caaaaatch</b>! Shardul Thakur is the man, standing on the very edge of the long-on boundary. The ball is still set to lob over him for six... that is until he leaps up and sticks out a hand and comes down with that little white thing in his clutches! But he's about to overbalance! There's one.. two.. three little skips... with his hands spread out to keep himself within the ropes... and he pulls it off! India's spinners are ruling in Colombo and Tamim's efforts to dominate them sends him back. He tries a brazen loft, coming down the track to instill momentum into his shot. But Chahal, with that uncanny ability to know when a batsman will attack him, shifts his line wider to ensure a mis-hit"
pushes it past the bowler's left
indulges in a slog sweep - and though the ball is pretty full - Sabbir is able to get under it and those strong forearms provide all the power needed to slam it to deep midwicket
"another sweep, but this time the quick, back of a length ball, leaps off the top of the pad and wanders away to short fine leg"
sweeps straight to square leg! Attacking batting... at it's worst? Sarkar is new to the crease. Chahal is one of India's match-winners. And he takes a length ball on middle and gift wraps it for Dhawan to collect
runs down the pitch and swipes across the line to deep square leg
half an appeal for lbw as Mushfiqur nudges a length ball off his pads to midwicket. Would be sliding down.
"shortish on off stump, clips it to midwicket"
"pull... shot... top edge... over the keeper! And immediately Mushfiqur is down the pitch to talk to the batsman, pointing at the vacant square leg region as he completes an animated conversation. Seems like he's telling the big-hitter to calm down"
hacks the back of a length ball to midwicket
full and wide outside off - a little too wide
"goes full and straight, Sabbir walks across to flick, and the ball deflects off the pad and wanders to the wicketkeeper. Shardul wants to check on lbw - the umpire rules against it - and he wants a review. Doesn't get any support from Karthik and the same with Rohit"
presses forward to block towards point and secures the single
"reverts to the reverse, but again, he finds backward point. Unadkat moves to his left and stops runs"
a shade short and wide and Sabbir slaps it to deep point
"yanks a very full delivery outside off out to deep midwicket with a well executed sweep shot. Head over the ball, wrists rolling as he plays it to keep the ball down"
short-arm pulls it to deep midwicket
"pushes it through, but Mushfiqur is waiting for it, camped on the back foot for a little late cut. Plays it softly enough to pinch the single."
whirls his wrists over the full delivery outside off and sends it to long-on
heaves it over the square leg boundary and that brings up Bangladesh's fifty. Good shot selection from Sabbir. Shankar is not really a specialist bowler. He's medium pace. So he hares down the track and slogs him to oblivion
knows the bowler will correct his length and bowl fuller and he's waiting with the scoop! Brilliant cricket! Pre-empted the bowler. Put pressure on him. And reaped all the rewards
jabs the full delivery down to mid-off and sprints through to the other end. Sabbir could not have played the last three balls better
shimmies down again to slog a short delivery out to deep midwicket.
"rolls out the legspinner, which Sabbir dabs to short third man. The throw comes in from Dhawan, it deflects off the stumps into no-man's land, eventually allowing a single"
nice and slow and tossed up wide. Sabbir eases forward and slices the ball through cover
drifts down leg and it needs a top save from Vijay Shankar at short fine leg from becoming a boundary. Mushfiqur's sweep shot is a thing of beauty. Plays it anywhere between fine leg and long-on
"quick and short outside off, he cuts to point"
tries to pull a pretty full delivery - and a quick one at that - and is hit on the pad before he even brings his bat down properly
sweeps the tossed up (possible) googly outside off to deep midwicket
"pushes it through flat on off stump. Mushfiqur keeps leg side of it, hoping it would turn. It doesn't. So he has to quickly spear it through the covers"
"pulls his length back, and makes sure not to give too much room. And as a result, Mushfiqur, coming down the track, has to settle for a single through the covers"
"slogs a full toss out to deep square leg. Would ya look at that, even his bad balls don't go"
"premeditates a reverse sweep and Washington immediately takes all the pace off the ball. So much that Sabbir is standing there, waiting for it to arrive and when it does, he can barely hit it off the square at point"
slices it to cover
comes down the pitch and flicks it to long-on
"tries to advance again, but Washington one-ups him with a yorker, right at his feet. <b>Three overs done, only ten runs given</b>"
"miscues the slice and it's taken! Beautiful bowling from Chahal, but it's fast becoming his signature now. The loopy, wide delivery - this time it's the googly - that confounds a batsman looking to tear him apart. Mushfiqur is reaching away from his body. He plays the on-the-up slash, gets a top edge, and Shankar, running to his right tracks it down and takes it with a good dive."
pulls the shortish delivery on off stump away to deep midwicket
"<b>doesn't read the googly</B> and the front-foot block produces an inside edge, which scurries away to long leg"
"sweeps a very full, very wide delivery out to deep midwicket"
"hangs back, but is put in trouble by the length of the ball being pretty full. Plonks his bat down on it hurriedly and it doesn't go any further than the side of the pitch"
slices the back of a length delivery out to the sweeper cover
comes down the track and heaves a back of a length ball between deep midwicket and long-on
"good work from Raina on the long-on boundary, racing to his right, putting in the big dive and stopping a certain boundary. Mahmudullah is Bangladesh's finisher and he's proving that with some lusty blows over the leg side"
shortish delivery slithers down the leg side as Mahmudullah looks to glance it away
"back of the hand slower ball, which he picks and deftly flicks through to long-on"
turns a full ball down to short fine leg
steps out and launches a slower delivery on leg stump to deep midwicket
"top work on the deep square leg boundary, with Manish countering the ball hitting the turf and spinning away from him. Suddenly he finds himself to the right of the ball and has to stick his hands out to collect a fiercely-hit pull shot from reaching the boundary"
"back of a length from around the wicket, slices it to deep third man"
works the back of a length delivery to short fine leg
"slower ball on middle, Mahmudullah attempts to nudge it into the leg side, but can't"
there we go! Third man is up. The ball is short. Mahmudullah knows all he has to do is push it into the gap and does it brilliantly. What a late cut
"<b>run-out chance</b>! Unadkat races to his right to stop Mahmudullah's attempt at a quick single, grabs it with his dominant left hand, takes aim, and a direct hit would have taken out Bangladesh's finisher. Good work by mid-off backing up as well, could have been four overthrows"
full on off stump - slow as well - Sabbir blocks to pick up a single at point
"dives over the ball and it hurries away to the fine leg boundary. Look away, Chahal. Your captain's not happy. Sabbir sure is. Another expertly executed scoop shot"
shooot! There is precious little wrong with the ball - on a length and on off stump - but Sabbir comes down the track like he owns it and launches the ball over Thakur's head. Majestic!
"beaten by the knuckle ball outside off, and that only happens with it swinging in the air, away from the outside edge."
"another knuckle ball, which Sabbir blocks to cover"
"this is at top pace, and it seems to deck away after pitching! Mahmudullah goes for the on the up drive, with the angled face. But he's beaten. Replays show this is a cross seamer"
"full toss, pushes it to long-on, and Bangladesh are getting a move on. India's quick bowlers are going to be tested in the death tonight"
"flicks it away to the left of short fine leg. Mahmudullah is such a master at manipulating fields. Time and again, he says in press conferences, that though Bangladesh doesn't have big hitters, they can take advantage of poor bowling with smart batting. He's putting it to plan here"
"<b>absolute chaos and Mahmudullah is run-out</b>! The only batsman to put India under pressure and his wicket has been gifted away. The action begins with a slower ball, which beats Mahmudullah. It breaks off the pitch, away from him, as he tries to flick and is hit on the pad. Sabbir is gunning for the quick single. He's halfway down the pitch, he reaches the batting crease, with Mahmudullah having taken a couple of exploratory steps before deciding there is no single. So if anyone is run out, it will be him. Karthik picks up the ball, exploits the madness by throwing it through to Shankar, who fumbles, adding to the drama. Mahmudullah starts running now, at full tilt, But the bowler is able to regain control of the ball and runs it to the stumps"
"full and outside off, drives to long-off"
"full and outside off, slashes it away to the third man boundary. Pretty useful outside edge there"
"back of a length and outside off, Shakib cuts and misses"
"shortish and cramping the left-hander, Shakib dabs it to point"
works the shortish delivery on middle away to deep midwicket
monsters the length ball over the wide long-on boundary. Explosive slog from Sabbir and it comes right off the middle
"fires it full and outside off, Sabbir hits it down to long-off to bring up his <b>fourth T20I fifty</b>"
"backs away, but does it too early, allowing Washington to follow him. Cramps the batsman as he cuts straight to the point fielder"
"too quick, too close to the body, and Shakib can only flick it along the ground to deep midwicket"
"full and outside off, drills it to long-on"
"soars into the stands at deep midwicket! Sabbir picks the slower ball, clears his front leg and slogs it with considerable power"
"goes full, goes straight, goes full pace and that gives him the desired result. A yorker that becomes a dot"
"sails over long-on! Shankar goes back to the back-of-the-hand slower ball. It comes out a juicy full toss. Sabbir stands still, summoning all his power, and then wallops it away with absolute disdain!"
"looks for a scoop - so he's premeditating - and the full toss outside off - the same ball he hit for a six the last ball - <b>pings off the bat, onto his helmet</b> and over to midwicket"
"full and outside off, spears it to cover, looks for the quick single, but has he run himself out in the process? Yep. Shankar does well to gather a fierce throw near his ankles and then knock over the stumps before Shakib can reach safety"
"full and outside off, steers it to sweeper cover"
"full on leg stump, Sabbir works it to midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, Mehidy steers it to point and Sabbir pinches the single, though there was considerable risk. He knows he needs to face the most deliveries in this partnership"
"<b>run-out chance</b>! And though India muck that up, they are reviewing a lbw call made against them. Good ball from Thakur, yorker length, having Sabbir play around his front pad. Replays suggest it should be going down leg. No bat there either. Now after that, Sabbir is tempted to look for a single thanks to his partner taking a few steps down the pitch.The ball is still five feet away from the stumps at the batsman's end. Thakur spots the opportunity, gets to it, goes underarm and misses his target"
beautiful cricket! Third man is up. The ball is short and outside off. All it needs is direction and Sabbir gives it with the angled bat. Splendid work under pressure
"fine leg is up and he exploits that too. <B>Sabbir is playing a blinder</b>! He plants the bat down in line with the knuckle ball, repurposes it to become a ramp and it just sails over Chahal inside the circle"
"short and outside off, pulls it to deep midwicket"
"goes for the ramp over fine leg, but is struck on the pad. Unadkat goes for an appeal for lbw, but Sabbir had moved outside the line of off stump. <b>Oh, but wait, India are reviewing this too</B>. And they will lose it because there is a pretty big inside edge in action here."
"knocks him over! And Unadkat screams in triumph (nowhere near the batsman, so no demerits). This is a slower ball and it will be filed under the age old 'you miss I hit' tactic bowlers regale their grandchildren with over a roaring fire and some marshmallows."
bangs it into the middle of the deck and it gains way too much height. Called wide
"middle stump takes a beating and it's another slower ball, perfectly in line with the target, and the batsman generously plays all around it. Can't expect much more than a slog from a No. 9"
"full and outside off, jams the bat down on it and sends it to mid-off"
"perfectly executed off-drive, but it finds Dhawan and becomes no runs."
"slower ball outside off, Mustafizur blocks it to cover. Two wickets in the over, which ends with a hat-trick of dot balls. Unadkat hits back in staaaaayyyyyle."
"scoops the length ball outside off to the long leg boundary. That shot is always going to be on with fine leg inside the circle. Or even if not, considering the way slog-overs batting has changed"
"races down the pitch and gets a full toss above his waist to deal with.... and deals with it with a monster six over deep midwicket. What a strike! Mehidy is asking for a no-ball, but he doesn't get it because he is so far down the pitch and the ball is on its way down"
"toe-ends a wide yorker out to point. Good bowling from Thakur, going full and wide"
"slices it away to the third man boundary! These are useful runs! And it comes off the knuckle ball, with Mehidy clearing his front leg and carving it between point and third man"
comes down the pitch and lashes it to sweeper cover
"back of a length and outside off, Mehidy slaps it to long-off"
clips a full delivery on off stump through midwicket
"slants the fuller delivery into the right-hander, who is waiting to let the ball pitch and turn. But it doesn't and Rohit gets an inside edge as he hurries to defend his stumps"
"launches it to the long-on boundary, coming down the track to take on Bangladesh's best bowler. Looks a decent idea for the right-hander to play Shakib as an inswing bowler"
"fires it in on middle, Rohit works it through midwicket"
"gets down the track for a nudge to short fine leg. Rohit wants the single, it's his call since it goes behind the wicket, and Dhawan trusts it"
"full and fast on off stump, Rohit drives to extra cover"
"full and outside off, Dhawan blocks to cover point"
"shapes to sweep, but the line is too constricting, so he has to knock it down by the pitch and hope Rohit is up for the quick single. And yes, he is"
overpitched and Rohit mauls it over long-on! That big back lift coming through the line of the ball and then ending up  behind his shoulders... Breathtaking shot....
spears it down leg - and it's short too - Rohit says thank you very much with a pull shot that flies past square leg's left
"that's pulverised! It's into the stands. It's the longest hit of the match! Rohit just jumps out of his crease, takes on a length ball and launches it over deep midwicket #LikeABoss."
"full on off stump, Rohit blocks it down the pitch"
"it's the other opener's turn, with the ball spinning into him, well, that's being generous when the ball is a long hop and it's begging for the pull shot. Dhawan doesn't disappoint"
"full and outside off, works it to mid-on"
turns a full delivery on leg stump to square leg
"taken at mid-on! Excellent effort from the sub-fielder Ariful, running forward and to his right to cling on to a leading edge. Good on Shakib too, holding this ball back even though he is under attack. Dhawan comes down the pitch, looking to flick it in the air over midwicket. But his timing is all whack thanks to Shakib's genius"
"cuts a short ball over to point, Rohit looks for a single, but Suresh Raina, the new batsman screams no, and he's right to do so"
"full and outside off, drives to extra cover"
"back of a length on Raina's pads, he turns it to midwicket"
"hurtles down the track for a slog, but he's beaten on the inside edge. Good stuff from Rubel, beating Raina for pace"
"caught behind down leg but the umpire signals wide. Mushfiqur is adamant. He wants a review. And Bangladesh taken it. It's a short ball down leg. Raina shuffles inside the line and gets an inside edge on the pull shot through to the keeper, who moves to his right and takes a regulation catch. India are two down early, in a big chase, in a final"
blocks the good length delivery looking for the top of off stump
"carves it up and over to the point boundary. Only one bounce before it hits the ropes. All the fielders are inside the circle on the off side, so when he sees the short and wide delivery, he has no reason to hold back"
"back of a length on off stump, clips it to the left of midwicket, where a clear single opportunity exists. But Rohit screams 'no no no no'. Just before screaming a fifth no, he realises there are runs there and accepts Rahul's call"
pushes it to mid-on for a quick single. Easily taken
a little bit of turn as Rohit comes down to block a good length ball on off stump. Outside edge goes to short third man
"mid-off is up and so Rohit dances down the track, gets inside the line of the ball and consciously opens the face of the bat to get it over that fielder. Good cricket."
he gets such height on his sixes! Clears his front leg and goes after the ball with roughly the same fervour as Liam Neeson goes after the bad guys in the Taken movies. Sensational hit over long-off
"full and outside off, drives to cover point"
"on leg stump, works it away to square leg, and then punches the air as if he's missed out"
"back of a length on off stump, from around the wicket, Rahul taps it down by his feet and pinches a single"
"and now he shows off the other side of his game: the one where he knows the gaps on the ground with inch-perfect precision. Brings out the late cut because the ball is short and wide and places it between third man and point. There is absolutely no power in the shot, just class"
"this is the cutter, and there is enough in the surface to provide a little bit of extra bounce. Rohit goes for that late cut again, the ball going to the left of third man. The batsman searches for a single, he's sent back, and is safe only because of a lack of direct hit"
"full and outside off, drives handsomely through to the left of sweeper cover"
"full on off stump, smacks it to short cover"
"shortish on middle, turns it to deep midwicket and retains strike"
"shortish and outside off, Rohit short-arm pulls it to long-on"
"hammers it over deep midwicket. India are pushing ahead of the asking rate, although they are being helped out with the bowlers missing their lengths. This is too short."
"shimmies down the pitch, searching for the ball, which simply goes on with the angle from around the wicket, takes the inside edge and goes to square leg"
"full and outside off, slices it to the left of deep point. That bat was a blur as he whirled it around"
"<b>squares him up</B> with a slower delivery, angled into leg stump and the fact it is only 83 kph  means it can grip the pitch and turn. With it being full as well, it troubles the batsman"
pats a shortish delivery to long-on
"low full toss, which Rohit hits to midwicket"
drives on the up and benefits from a misfield at cover by Liton Das
"punches the short delivery to the left of point. He's found his timing straight away in this innings. So far, without looking to over-hit, he's maintaining a strike-rate of 200"
"full and outside off, blocks to point and demands a quick single. It's risky. Rohit is in trouble as Mehidy dives to his right and gets up, taking aim at the stumps. <b>Rohit has given up, and the throw goes wide</b>!"
"back of a length and outside off, Rohit wafts at it, stuck on his back foot, and is beaten"
"slashes it to the man at deep point, who ends up being surprised at the pace at which the ball reaches him. Rohit is hittin em close to perfect."
"full on middle, Rohit blocks to cover"
nudges a full delivery on off stump to long-on
"skews it.... and <b>it lands safe</b>! There is little need for shots like these, a down the track heave against the turn. He's not to the pitch of the ball, it turns away, catches his leading edge and somehow manages to beat cover"
"sets up for a big shot, that backlift going high, but he seems content in flicking down to long-on"
"cuts off the stumps, and manages to place it well enough to beat the man in the deep too. Special shot from Rahul, moving his feet quickly, making the room he needs to power it away"
"looks for a scoop, but the ball is too full for such shenanigans. India do get a wide though"
stays back with the bowler going flat and quick. Flicks a single to long-on
glides the shortish delivery outside off behind point
runs the shortish delivery to deep point
"top-edges the pull and it lands safely in the hands of deep square leg. Poor cricket from Rahul. This partnership had Bangladesh on the mat and he slides open the door to let them see the light. A short ball, outside off, getting too big for him to yank over to the leg side becomes his undoing."
pulls a short and wide delivery down to mid-on
"full and angled in at off stump, Pandey blocks to cover"
"works a short ball on off stump away to deep square leg. Good hustle from the fielder Sabbir, keeping it to one"
"full and outside off, he drives to the sweeper cover"
"goes for the late cut, even when the ball is very very full, and barely wide of off stump. <i>Somehow</i> manages to get bat to it for a single to third man"
"slows it down to the new batsman, tossing the ball up. Pandey drives to cover"
"strides out of his crease, but Shakib's drift into the right-hander forces the inside edge even as Pandey looks for the drive through cover"
"flatter and quicker on middle, Pandey turns it to midwicket"
"short ball, which doesn't really come on, and Pandey awkwardly inside edges a swipe to midwicket. Beautiful over from Shakib, replete with all that makes him a great bowler. Changes of pace, trajectory and line - and all of them were impossibly subtle"
<b>gets fifty</B> and brings Colombo to its feet! A simple flick through midwicket does the job
"comes down the pitch but doesn't get to the ball, so he makes sure to drive along the ground to deep cover. Good bowling from Nazmul, slowing it right down, giving nothing for the new man to work with"
"full on leg stump, works it to long-on"
smacks a full and wide delivery to long-off
"very full on middle, and Rohit digs it out from the blockhole to extra cover"
"fierce straight drive, and good on Nazmul to bend down and thrust his hands at a ball which might well have been singeing the turf as it left Rohit's bat"
scoops the full delivery from around the wicket to the right of cover
"comes down the pitch and dabs the length ball, meant to cramp him, through point"
lifts a full delivery outside off to long-on
punches the back of a length delivery to extra cover
"slower short ball, completely messes with Pandey's bat swing as he inside edges the pull to square leg"
"slaps it to extra cover - straight to Liton Das - and runs! There is no way he is making his ground. He's not even in the frame when the throw comes.... and goes just wide of the stumps. Mustafizur was right beside it, why wasn't he backing up?"
steps out of his crease and drives the full one on leg stump to long-on
"taken at long-on! Rohit's gone and Bangladesh have pulled ahead in this final! India's captain has been timing them like a dream all night. But this time, going for a slog sweep at a ball that doesn't really give him enough room, he skews it high rather than long"
"shortish on off stump, pushes it down to long-on. <b>That's Vijay Shankar's first ball in T20Is</b>. What a time to face it..."
chips it to long-off.
gets down on one knee and finds the boundary behind square leg. Massive whippage of the wrists! <b>That's the first four for India since the ninth over</b>
"full on middle, drives to extra cover"
"slower ball on leg stump, he flicks it only as far as short fine leg"
"it's on a length on middle stump, Vijay Shankar lets it come on and whips it to the right of deep square leg"
"outside edge wanders over third man to bring up Pandey's first boundary of the night. It's full and wide, he looks to smear it over cover, but will take the result anyway"
comes down the track and heaves it to the long-on boundary. Much more power in this shot and it beats the fielder who has only a few yards to move to his left
"slower ball outside off, he is beaten by the lack of pace as he outside edges to short third man"
"yorker on off stump, Shankar can only keep it out"
carves the short ball outside off out to deep point and Mushfiqur is yelling himself hoarse as the fielder gives up two
"full and outside off, Pandey slogs to long-on"
full and outside off - it's the cutter - and Shankar's loft over cover just doesn't come off. There's a slip in as well from Shakib. Good captaincy
"another cutter, and Shankar has no clue. Looks to swipe it over midwicket, and ends up getting hit on the body."
"full toss, outside off, Pandey smears it to the point boundary, well to the left of the deep point fielder. Looks like he's finally getting his timing right"
<b>huge appeal from the wicketkeeper</B> as Pandey slogs and misses a cutter angled across him
pumps it down to long-off
"yorker on middle, Pandey slices it to deep point and races back for the second as well. The throw is flat but it's just wide enough that in the time Mushfiqur takes to guide it onto the stumps, Pandey is safe"
"in the slot outside off, but Pandey skews it out to long-on, along the ground, mistiming it"
"hammers it to the left of deep midwicket and Vijay Shankar finds the boundary India desperately need. He couldn't pick up Mustafizur's slower balls, but the part-timer Sarkar's are a much easier job"
"yorker on middle, Vijay digs it out and looks for a single. It's very risky, Sarkar only needs to go a couple of steps to his right to collect it. The throw is underarmed. Vijay gives up. But the ball misses target"
"<b>run-out chance at the stirkers' end</b>, after Pandey drills the yorker back down the pitch and looks for a single again. Sarkar collects the ball, hurls it at the stumps and breaks em perfectly. Replays however indicate Pandey got his bat down in time"
swings wildly and the back of a length ball outside off goes away unpunished
"good length ball outside off, Shankar looks to punch it through the covers, but the offcut beats him again. <b>Outrageous skill from Mustafizur</b>"
"full and outside off, it grips in the pitch and darts sharply past Shankar's swishing bat. He's not happy it's not been called a wide"
"full and outside off, goes for the slice behind point, and is again beaten. <b>Four balls, each time beaten</b>. Mustafizur is on the cusp of bowling a maiden in the 18th over a final! What a talent!"
strikes him on the body as he shuffles across and looks to swing it over the leg side.  Pandey gets his partner through for a leg bye
"taken at long-on! What an over from Mustafizur! He's the game-breaker! Continues bowling full and wide outside off. Pandey does manage to get bat to it, but his slog has no timing. <b>Wicket maiden from Mustafizur in the 18th over</b>"
"low full toss and DK pummels it over long-on! Comes in, sets himself up, standing outside his crease, and lifts the ball straight over Rubel's head. This T20 is see-sawing all over the place!"
"heaves it to the right of long-on! And Colombo goes beserk! DK gets his back leg outside off, sets up a strong base, and slogs the half-volley away to the boundary. Rubel's yorker goes wrong and India's hopes rise up"
and it's outta here again! DK is in #BossMode. This is the six Mahmudullah hit to bring Bangladesh into the final and now he watches it from the opposition camp as a full delivery on leg stump is heaved over square leg.
"slower ball outside off, DK looks to cut, but he misses it. Mushfiqur goes for the appeal, but there is plenty of distance between bat and ball"
comes down the track and hammers the back of a length delivery to long-off
"scoops it to the long leg boundary! What an innings! Rubel is one of Bangladesh's bankable bowlers because of the pace he generates. But here all of that pace has worked in India's favour. Like here, with fine leg up, DK brings that shot into play by first moving way down leg to draw the bowler outside off, then gets in position, down on one kneeand sends it soaring away into the night sky"
"full toss down leg, Vijay Shankar can't get bat to it, he can't get a bye either -might have been run-out if Mushfiqur had hit - but the umpire does his job and calls a wide."
"length ball, perfectly set up for the smash down the ground, but Vijay Shankar is unable to put bat to ball."
"full and outside off, drives to extra cover for a single"
"yorker outside off, DK skews it out to deep point and it's only a single"
"picks the gap at third man! It's a very full ball outside off, and that tiny bit of room is just what he needs to plant the open face down on it and send the ball between point and third man"
"<b>taken, it's taken, Bangladesh have a wicket</b>, and it comes despite one man dropping the catch. Long-on runs in to get under the ball. He gets both hands to it but the ball pops out. Luckily, Mehidy has also come running in from long-off and he takes the rebound beautifully."
"flat! hard! AND HE'S CLEARED THE BOUNDARY! INDIA WIN! And the dressing room goes mad! Sarkar is hunched over on the ground! What an innings. DK is lost in the huddle. He has all of his team-mates climbing all over him. He's floored, after he has floored Soumya Sarkar over the cover boundary with incredible style!"
