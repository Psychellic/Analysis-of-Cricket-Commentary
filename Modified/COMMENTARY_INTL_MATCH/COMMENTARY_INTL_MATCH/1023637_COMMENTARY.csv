slider that beats an attempted push into the off side
beaten by the slider again. Playing for turn but the ball kept swerving away
"leading edge that rolls wide of cover, they take a quick single. Not much turn so far. They're skidding through and on each of the three occasions, Ludeman has played for turn"
"this is pushed through quicker on middle, punched back to the bowler"
"backs away and mistimes a push to mid-off, can't get off the blocks. Super start this, not one delivery has been wayward so far"
"ah, well. Commmentator's curse? This one's a full toss sliding down leg, he looks to tickle it fine but the ball deflects off the pad, or did it? Looks like he got a thin edge, races past short fine leg. Useful runs"
"starts off with a length ball on off stump, pushed off the back foot to cover"
"advances down the track and swings the incoming delivery. Looked to hit it square, but gets a thick inside edge that races past short fine leg. Not where he intended"
risky single. But the non-striker trusted his partner's call to complete it. Mid-on had to come in a fair but but the batsmen were well in. Didn't look like at one stage
"looks to whip that  over the infield, toe-ends it past midwicket. Didn't get it off the middle"
"floats it on middle and leg, works it wide of midwicket for a quick single"
"shouts of catch, but this falls just short of cover. Looked to thump it over the man there, looked like the ball got stuck into the pitch, he was too early into the stroke as well"
swing and a miss. Looked to get down on one knee and heave it over the leg side. Nowhere near the pitch of the ball
pushed into the gap between cover and mid-off as they scamper a run
"looks for a reverse sweep, but can't get it fine enough. Straight to Fawad Ahmed at short third man"
"too full, driven firmly to Watson at cover"
"flatter one on middle, whipped to deep midwicket"
slapped but straight to cover again. He tried to manufacture width but couldn't quite pick the gap
"simply extends his arms, uses the width and caresses it between point and third man. Class strokes, pure timing"
"the king of the dab celebrates, doesn't even bother appealing. Lands it at length on middle and off from wide of the crease, Ludeman is hurried into an attempted whip to the leg side but misses it completely. That would have hit leg stump."
"gets back and across, defends the length ball back to the bowler"
advances down the track and swings across the line to beat midwicket. Picked the bones out of that
"steps out again but Carlos sees him advancing and fires it short and wide outside off, Hodge couldn't reach out to it in the end"
forced off the back foot but straight to backward point. End of a successful over
"<B> dropped! </b> He backed away and slapped it off the front foot. Got the front leg out of the way and swung hard, Carlos moved to his right but couldn't hold on at mid-off. Tough chance, but should have been taken"
uses the bowler's pace to ease it to short third man for a quick single
"gets underneath the flight and lofts it back over the bowler's head. Top shot! Not much turn, just backed away, lined him up and whack. Super timing and placement"
"swung across the line, gets a thick inside edge towards square leg"
"play and a miss. This was fired full and wide, he looked to squeeze it behind point but missed"
"top work off his own bowling, this was hit hard but he moved to his left on his follow-through to stop that with one hand"
"starts off with a gift of a delivery. 120 clicks short ball down leg, he swivels back and tickles the pull into the fine leg boundary. Easy pickings"
"another short ball down leg side, swing and a miss from Dunk. Umpire thought long and hard before calling it a wide"
"full, wide and he's squeezed that between backward point and short third man. He backed away, Watson saw him do that and fired it wide, he still somehow managed to reach that. Jeez, super bat that"
"a misfield by Fawad Ahmed at short fine leg give them the extra run. Another short ball down leg side, this was tickled straight to the fielder"
thumped down the ground to long-on using the full face of the bat
"fetches a pull from outside off, can't time it properly, rolls to square leg and they take a run"
"floats this full and wide on off, driven to mid-off and steals a quick single. Dunk just managed to get back in, mid-off was a little slow to get off the blocks"
"slow turn from middle, punched to deep midwicket"
"swing and a miss, a very wild one too! This one turns away from outside off, he was too early into the stroke"
"squeezed towards deep point, backed away and then opened the bat face late to play the stroke"
can't bring those variations into play if it's a full toss. Swung to wide long-on
gets to the pitch of the ball and eases it with the spin to long off
"sharp turn back in, drops it into the off side towards point as they complete a quick single"
"slider but this one is way down leg, good take by the wicketkeeper"
"tossed up on middle, there's sharp turn, Hodge does well to ease it with the spin to cover"
"breaks away sharply from middle, Hodge waits and then dabs it towards mid off for a quick single"
"slides this one across the left-hander, quicker through the air this one, Ludeman swings and misses"
"has he mistimed it? Really tight on the rope at long-off, but the boundary is not big enough. The fielder there thought he had a metre or two behind, but that wasn't the case. This was far from hit off the middle, but it still sailed over. Sydney"
backs away and drives this into the gap between deep cover and long-off
backs away and smashes this straight to cover at the edge of the ring
"ungainly swing to the leg side. He was off balance as he tried to whack that short of length delivery, beaten"
"short outside off, he backed away a little too much but the umpire still thinks Carlos was flirting with the wide line"
"swung into the gap at deep square leg, Green fell awkwardly and stumbled over and so couldn't fire the throw."
"full and straight outside off, he backs away and drives this into the gap at wide long-off. Excellent running to come back for the second"
"swings leg side, gets another thick inside edge that races into the gap at deep backward square leg. He got the middle of the edge! Not entirely convincing, but runs nonetheless"
backs away and then guides the slower and fuller delivery to third man
"whipped to midwicket, Watson fires a throw at the bowler' end but the batsman was comfortably in"
too full and thumped straight to long-off
"chipped over the bowler's head to long-on, jogs the single"
"drilled down to long-off, beats the man there. He didn't have more than a few yards to move but it was struck really, really hard. Top shot!"
"swung with the spin, Carlos at long-on thought he was in business, but it just kept sailing over. Didn't get under the flight but went through with the stroke and just managed to beat the man there. Carlos went with one hand and landed awkwardly. Full marks for the effort"
"googly on middle, tapped into the gap between point and cover for a quick single"
"fires this full outside off, he gets a thick inside edge towards midwicket a they scamper a run"
"floats this on middle and leg, turned towards the man running in from deep midwicket, excellent running"
"flatter one outside off, pushed to cover"
"he's hammered the flat hit over long on. He was waiting and waiting for it, and gave it a good old thwack."
"sensible stuff, drops it towards point, the fielder has some work to do, running in from the deep"
backs away and punches it to long-off
"slow turn from middle, dabs it to short third man and sets off for a run, sent back in the nick of time"
"starts off with one, predictably, from around the stumps, eased to long on"
"swing and a miss. Looked to fetch a length ball from outside off, but was way too early into the stroke"
"slower delivery outside off, backs away and carves it to deep point"
"there's a gift wrapped with a lovely birthday message saying 'hit me, please.' Too full and sliding into the pads, and he's simply picked that up over short fine leg. Can't get easier than that"
pulled across the line towards deep midwicket
forced off the front foot towards the man coming from the edge of the circle at cover
swung across the line to midwicket
"full and wide, he backs away and swings leg side, gets maximum elevation as the ball sails over"
"takes on the man in the deep, and can only hit it as far as Arjun Nair at deep midwicket. This was a juicy full toss on middle, swung across the line but didn't quite get it off the middle. End of a sprightly cameo"
dabs it towards point as they scamper a quick single
advances down the track and then flicks this incoming delivery towards fine leg
"pulled but hasn't hit that off the middle, straight to deep midwicket"
backs away and cracks the short ball to deep cover
"this is just a one-handed chip and boy, that has sailed over wide long-on. He's got a big, big piece of willow and can still connect. Wow, I want that willow"
gets forward and blocks a full ball on off
dabs it into the off side and scampers a quick single
fierce sweep towards deep square leg
"punched back to the bowler, this one kept a touch low"
"angles a length ball back into middle from around the stumps, defended back down the pitch"
"cramped for room as he looks to whip this past midwicket, the inside-edge deflects to the off side and they jog the run"
top work by the keeper. Lenton dived full length to his left to stop that thick inside edge that was flying towards short fine
"full and into middle and leg, Pollard is too slow to get his bat down to flick that, still scampers through for a leg bye"
"flicked straight to short fine leg, on the bounce"
"full and straight on off stump, dabbed behind the wicket for a quick single"
"slower deliver, he muscles the pull and gets it into the gap between deep midwicket and wide long-on. One-handed back flick to pull it back in"
"that's a ripper of a delivery. Watson lets out a roar. This is full, the ball tails away ever-so-slightly from middle, he was still coming down on the back swing as he tried to squeeze it to the off side, played down the wrong line, and gone. End of a super knock from Dunk, but you just got the feeling that he was tiring just a little"
"full toss on middle, punched to mid-off"
gets on top of the bounce and works it wide of square leg
punched down to long-on for an easy single
stifled appeal for caught behind. Watson didn't think there was an edge. The keeper is disappointed. I just think they're lucky to get away with a wide here. Lehmann was clearly late on the hook shot
"flicked over the infield, Carlos Brathwaite comes around towards square leg and slides over to cut that off"
"muscles a length ball across the line, super work from Gibson and Vince. Tag team effort. Gibson threw himself full-length to his left and then lifted it to Vince who fired the throw at deep midwicket"
"back of the hand slower ball on middle, he wrists it towards deep midwicket"
"slides this length ball down leg, Lehmann misses a faint tickle. Could have been four easy runs"
"big appeal for lbw but the umpire reckons the ball was missing the stumps. The keeper collects the deflection and fires a throw at the striker's end, but he was in. <b> Looks like the ball would have crashed into leg stump. </b>"
"full on middle and leg, squeezed to the leg side"
"angled into the pads, worked towards midwicket for a quick single"
"full delivery on middle and leg, worked to mid-on as they complete a quick single. Pollard responded to his partner's call in a jiffy"
"low full toss outside off, swung across to long-off, the bat face turned in his hand as it made contact with the ball"
"sliced to third man. Stepped out to go over point, took it on the full but didn't time it well"
"slower delivery outside off, Pollard winds up and then muscles the hit as straight as a dye, long-off does well to dive full length to his right and pull off a one-handed stop"
"pulled from outside off towards deep midwicket. Pollard had already completed the second by the time Lehmann turned around, and in the end had to simply sacrifice his wicket for the overseas professional. The keeper turned in an underarm throw to Brathwaite, who whipped the bails off at the bowler's end"
"flat hit over long-on. This was a juicy full toss outside off, Pollard went full tilt with that hit, swung across the line and got it off the middle of the bat."
"slower and fuller on off, too close for him to try an expansive drive, gets a thick inside edge back down the pitch"
"back of the hand slower delivery on off, once again can't get any room to ease it into the gap at cover, straight off an inside edge to the bowler"
"swung across the line, on the bounce to long-on"
"it's good no one came in the way of that hit. Predictable stuff from McKay! Short, Pollard waits, waits and crunches the pull into the deep midwicket boundary. <b> This now is Pollard's highest score of the tournament </b>"
"full on middle, drilled to long-on"
"slower length ball, he swings, gets some amount of bat on it and Patterson has tipped the ball through his finger tips into the long-off boundary. He ran in a little too much, and then had to jump and outstretch. Useful, useful runs these"
"yorker on middle and leg, somehow Pollard manages to get underneath that and flicks the low full toss into the stands at deep square leg. 85-metre hit. You need to have a super strong bottom hand to play that. Wow"
"excellent comeback, right into the blockhole, squeezed back to the bowler"
"pulled, but can't find the gap at deep square. Completes the second nevertheless. Good match awareness from Dean, was mindful of the weak throw and chanced a second"
"swung across the line and he's hammered that over wide long-on. Fetched it from the sixth stump or so, and got enough meat on that. Carnage from Pollard, where have you been all tournament, sir?"
"gets a thick inside edge towards deep square, Pollard was just turning when the fielder fired the throw, and he was miles outside the crease when the wicketkeeper whipped the bails off. End of a super innings"
"has he gloved the pull? No. Missed. Too early into the pull, couldn't get anything on it."
"gets some shape back in, this is full on middle and leg, flicked straight to midwicket"
short of length delivery that nips back in and thuds into the thigh pad as he looks to whip it past square leg
"length ball that shapes away from middle, cut away but straight to point"
"swing and a miss. Can't make use of the width on offer. Full and swinging away, looked to slap that through cover but played too early"
"steps out and looks to swing over square leg, but too late on the stroke this time."
hit high on the thigh pad as he looked to work it to the leg side. He played outside the line of the delivery on that occasion. Couldn't have asked for a better start
"full on the pads, worked to midwicket where Hodge misfield and allows a second run"
"beauty! That's the catch of the match, a one-handed stunner. This was slower and fuller outside off, he backed away to go over point but only found a thick edge. The keeper had to take split-second decision. Does he go with  both hands or fling himself like a goal-keeper and try and use the webbing? He chose the second option. The ball stuck, and he held on even as the elbow hit the turf."
leans forward and eases the full delivery to cover
hops across and whips the incoming length ball on middle and leg to short midwicket
stands tall and eases it wide of short third man
crunching cover drive! Down on one knee and bang. The timing is exquisite
thick inside edge to midwicket as they scamper a run
"gets this to nip back into middle from wide of the crease, Watson gets a thick inside edge to midwicket as he pushes outside the line"
"on the pads, driven straight to mid-on"
"wow, that is as delightful as it can get. Watson picks the length early, uses the depth of the crease and punches that between cover and point. It was an off cutter but he read that off the hand"
works the incoming length delivery to midwicket
stands tall and punches it off the back foot to cover
"whipped. Ah, those powerful wrists to get the gap between midwicket and mid-on. Dunk does well to give it chase and then slide across to stop that"
"slower delivery on middle, pushed past the bowler to mid-on"
makes room and slaps this down to long-off
"angles a back of length ball into middle from wide of the crease, punched to long on"
"short of length delivery, swivels back and then brings his wrists into the picture to whip that. Midwicket took the pace off the ball by diving to his left and keep it down to just two"
"looks to arch back and ramp but was cramped for room, went through with the stroke but didn't get enough bat on it. Short third man, running back, tried to recover but couldn't quite get underneath the delivery despite a desperate dive"
"slider down leg, fails to get a faint tickle that was enough to get a boundary"
"this time, he does. Short ball angling into middle and leg, uses the pace of the bowler to flick it past short fine leg"
"slower and fuller on middle, just a gentle tap to mid-on for a quick single"
"backs away to swing leg side but changes his stroke, looks to turn it away instead. Gets a leading edge between cover and point"
"low full toss on leg stump, swept to short fine where the fielder tumbles to his left to stop that"
"full and wide down leg side, Patterson looks to flick it fine but can't get any bat on it. Some exercise for the umpire"
uppish but just short of midwicket
"advances and lofts it over the infield even though he didn't get to the pitch, back for the second as the cover fielder had some work to do"
"short and sliding into middle and leg, Watson waits, waits and then pulls it over short fine leg. Super timing, the key was the placement though, which was impeccable this time"
forces it off the back foot towards short third man for a quick single
"sees the batsman back away and follows him with a slower ball outside leg, worked to square leg"
"the timing on that is simply out of this world. Too full from Pollard, Watson walks across and simply flicks that nonchalantly over deep midwicket. The power of the bottom hand is something else. Wow, this is simply fabulous"
"this time he backs away and thumps him over mid-off. Great shot! Read the slower deliver almost instantly, made room and gave it a whack"
"crashed into the gap between point and short third man. Too much width and Watson, who is well into retirement, won't miss out. He'll pick those away all day, all night"
"slider across the batsman, who makes room and thumps it to long-off"
"lands the quicker one on off, tapped back to the bowler"
worked across the line towards the man coming in from deep midwicket
"quicker one, but too short, he climbs into it and pulls but straight to deep midwicket"
"this one pitches on middle and skids on, cramped for room and so hits it back to the bowler"
"drifting into middle and leg, worked wide of short fine leg for an easy single"
"flatter one on middle and leg, pushed to long-on"
backs away and squeezes a full delivery to long-off
"forced off the front foot to long-off. This is good bowling, not giving the batmen any room to swing"
"slapped down to long-on. Stepped out, didn't get to the pitch but went through with the stroke"
"as easy as they come for Laughlin. This was short but didn't bounce as much as Watson would have liked, he shaped to pull, even went through with the stroke but could only get it off the bottom of the bat. On another night, he may have hit that to down town Sydney. Not this time. The man from long on had enough time to run in, call for it, steer clear of anyone else  and then wait, wait before taking it with his palms facing the sky. Watson grimaces as he walks off"
"full and straight on middle, squeezed past the bowler to mid-off"
"tossed up on middle and leg, eased to long on"
"drifting into middle and leg, wrists it down to long on"
"steps out and slogs one down to long-on, flat hit, didn't get the elevation that he would have liked"
short midwicket comes swooping in to stop that nurdle
chips down the track and works it past the bowler to long on
"backs away, the bowler follows him and then what does he do? Gets down on one knee and sweeps it fiercely into the gap between deep square and deep midwicket"
"tossed up outside off, Rohrer gets outside the line of the stumps and paddles it down to deep fine leg"
slapped across the line towards deep midwicket
"too short, he backs away and then crunches it towards Neser, who slides to his right and pulls off a tumbling stop at deep cover"
steps out and flicks it to deep square leg
"wrong'un this time, Rohrer opens the bat face late to glide it to short third man as they scamper a quick single"
"backs away to carve one over cover, but Sodhi bowls this on middle and leg to cramp him for room, smeared down to long-off"
swing and a miss. Completely deceived in flight. Looked to slog sweep that over deep square
"gets a thick inside edge that rolls to short fine leg. Looked to go over cover this time, but was done in by the fizz of the delivery. Clever bowling this"
"slows it down nicely. Generously tossed up outside off, Rorher check-pushes it, just short of point"
"the frustration of being unable to get the runs kept playing on his mind and has eventually led to his wicket. This was the wrong'un that was superbly slowed down, Patterson backed away to swat that over cover but swung through early and saw the ball cannon into the stumps. Wicket for persistence"
"this is another googly that keeps low, Carlos shuffled across to whip that but missed it"
"full toss on middle, punched to long on to get off the mark"
attempted pull that rolls off the toe end of the bat to the bowler
"got'im! This is a delightful delivery. Flight, dip and turn. This one was drifting in from wide of the crease, spin back in a touch because it's the wrong'un, Carlos goes for a wild slog but wasn't to the pitch of the ball. Missed it completely as the zing bails are disturbed. Sodhi is delighted, this is a wicket well-deserved, one any legspinner would be proud of. Trouble now for Sydney Thunder"
fizzes from off to beat the batsman fair and square. Super ball
"digs this one down to the leg side, behind the wicket. This was full and fired in from wide of the crease"
"through the gate! Sodhi with a celebratory leap. This is superb bowling. This one drifts away, pitches, breaks back in to beat the batsman's attempted flick. Big, big gap between bat and pad and he's wedged through. Is that the end for Thunder?"
"tossed up googly outside leg, he stays inside the crease and blocks"
uses the width to run that down to short third man for a quick single
"too short, he rocks back, uses the width and carves this behind point. Top shot, great timing"
"too full on the pads, turned to midwicket"
"drifting into middle and leg, worked with the angle to deep midwicket"
too short and he's lucky to get away with that. Swivels back and pulls it all along the ground to deep square leg
"nearly chipped that back to the bowler, who moves to his left and stops it on his followthrough"
"into the blockhole, worked wide of square leg towards the man coming in from the deep"
"tossed up on leg stump, the batman does well to smother the spin and work it back down the pitch"
"wrong'un that stops on him, worked to short third man but Lendon was halfway down the pitch when he was sent back. Sodhi does well to collect the throw cleanly and break the bails at the bowler's end. Not even a full-length dive could save Gibson. This is all folding up quickly for Thunder. They're right on the edge"
"another one for Sodhi. This is a sensational spell. Flight, turn and bounce. This one spins back in sharply, the batsman looks to force that past midwicket. The mistake he did was to play outside the line. The umpire quickly raised the finger. That would missed leg according to hawkeye"
gets to the pitch of the ball and dabs it to cover
drawn into the drive and has been snuffed out by one that turns away sharply. Tempts him with flight and then traps him. The hard push finds the thinnest of edges that is taken well by Carey
this is a wrong'un that rolls off a thick inside edge to mid-on
worked to square leg with the spin
"backs away to cut, chops it to cover"
"full toss outside off, crashed to deep cover"
"waist-high full toss that could have been swung anywhere to the leg side, McKay hits it straight to cover"
"this time he gets it right. Backs away, picks the length early and pulls him imperiously over deep midwicket"
"flipper outside off, mistime an attempted cut to cover"
"at the moment, it appears like all Sodhi needs to do to take a wicket is just turn up and bowl. Floats a legspinner outside off, he looks to fetch a slog sweep from outside off, connects well but finds deep midwicket. < b> These are the best figures now by an Adelaide Strikers' bowler. </b>"
stabs forward and pushes it to cover
"six-for and he's finished it off with a cracking googly. <b> The defending champions have been knocked out. </b> This is a short ball that fizzes back in, he backs away to cut, but is done in by the pace. The ball crashes into the middle stump. What a spell by Sodhi."
