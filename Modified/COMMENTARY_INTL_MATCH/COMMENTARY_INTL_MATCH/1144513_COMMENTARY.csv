<strong>nearly!</strong> Tamim has had trouble keeping the ball on the ground early in his innings. Another drive uppishly toward mid-off but Asghar Afghan is lead-footed and more or less falls over trying to flail his arms at it. Never came close to getting a hand to it whereas a more agile fielder might have created a chance.
"<b>beaten!</b> Dawlat pitches this full on fourth stump, it swings away to beat Tamim's attempted drive."
"good length ball, spinning away carom ball, defended."
"<strong>full on off, drives in the air to short cover and Afghanistan are claiming a catch!</strong> Watching live I thought it definitely short hopped and <strong>Liton is standing his ground</strong>. Hashmatullah Shahidi is the fielder. It's 50/50. He lunged forward and the ball lodged in his right hand with his left hand coming off. His head was up high, didn't look at the ball going in to protect his face so he may genuinely not have known if it carried or not. And the third umpire has decided it is <strong>OUT!</strong> Third umpire is Aleem Dar. The soft signal on field was out and he said he didn't see anything conclusive to overturn on the mic'd up conversation. Those kinds of catches are regularly overturned. It'll generate plenty of debate for sure. It looked awkward at any rate as both hands were not under the ball, just the right one."

Bangladesh momentum arrested temporarily."
double-strike for Afghanistan! Rashid gets a good length ball pitching on middle stump to straighten and skid on but <strong>Shakib calls for the review!</strong> Looked stone dead live. Hit on the knee roll with Shakib striding a touch forward. And ball-tracking shows <strong>it's going over the stumps on height! Great review by Shakib.</strong> Is there any doubt that this is his tournament?

"<strong>another slower ball does the trick!</strong> Full marks to Gulbadin for the constant variations which stymied both batsmen this over.

<strong>dropped!</strong> Frankly embarrassing from Dawlat. The same man who dropped Eoin Morgan on 26 on the boundary off Rashid in the England match produces the worst effort of the day - and there are plenty to choose from across these 50 overs. Gorgeous slower ball from Gulbadin landing wide outside off is sliced softly in the air to backward point. Dawlat runs to his right in front of Asghar moving left from short third man. He spills a dolly at head height. 2/10 on degree of difficulty.

<b>slower ball yorker finally rewarded!</b> It was loopy at 99 kph/61 mph. Mosaddek backed away to carve over the off side but couldn't time this trying to swat over the top of it as the ball fell off a table. Toe edge drags the ball onto off stump.

But he rushed the throw to Mosaddek over the stumps and dragged him two yards away to reprieve Gulbadin. An accurate relay would have had him out by 3 yards. Mosaddek is furious at Mehidy.
