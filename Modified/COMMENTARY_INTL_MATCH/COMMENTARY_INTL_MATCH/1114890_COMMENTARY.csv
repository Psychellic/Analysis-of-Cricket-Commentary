"back of a length outside off, goes deep in his crease and whips it to long-on"
"a bit of flight on off stump. Goes down low to sweep but doesn't quite get over the ball. Thick top edge flies over the keeper, just to his left"
"flat, angling into the pads, goes back and clips to midwicket"
"tossed up outside off, stretches out to defend towards point"
"full, slanting away from off stump and providing a bit of width. Gets on the front foot to ease a drive through cover point"

"back of a length, slanting away from off stump, carries at shoulder height to Ludeman after Carey slashes and misses"
"length ball on off stump, punched back firmly but straight to the bowler"

"back of a length on middle stump, makes a bit of room and punches to the sweeper on the cover point boundary"
"full on off stump, driven hard down the ground but mid-on is nice and straight and the ball goes straight to him"
"bowled him! Right up there, not quite yorker length but full enough, and Weatherald plays across the line, looking for the big whip through midwicket. He misses, Tremain hits middle stump. A great start for the Renegades"
"back of a length on middle stump, clipped to the left of mid-on"
"back of a length on off stump, maybe a hint of movement back into Head. Defended back to the bowler"
"back of a length on leg stump, tucked away to the left of midwicket"
back of a length on off stump. Tries to make room and slash through the covers with an angled bat. Extra bounce beats his edge
"full on off and middle, and he clears his front leg and brings his bat down straight and firm to nutmeg the bowler in his follow-through. That was hit really hard"
"fullish on off stump, clears his front leg again and flat-bats it straight, this time between the non-striker and mid-off"
"shortish, a bit of width, slapped to deep point"

"back of a length on off stump, jabbed to backward point"
"and again. Fullish on middle stump, Head plays a checked drive to mid-off"
"length ball on leg stump, whipped towards midwicket, who's right on the edge of the 30-yard circle"
"ooh, nearly. Digs this in short, and the angle from over the wicket gives Carey just a hint of width. Gets on his toes and slashes at the ball, deliberately slicing under it.  Bravo, leaping to his right at full stretch, only gets a fingertip to the ball at short third man"
"length ball on middle stump, clipped to midwicket"
"slower ball on off stump, opens his bat face and dabs towards Pollard at short third man"
"another slower ball, very full and wide of off stump. Goes a little early at the slash and fails to connect"
"length ball wide of off stump. Reaches out for an angled-bat drive and gets an inside-edge that rolls down to Ludeman, who falls to his right to stop it"
"slower ball, back of a length, turning like an offbreak from leg to middle. Goes back and tucks it gently into the midwicket region"

"flat, angling into the pads from round the wicket, clipped to midwicket"
"goes back to a length ball angling into off stump, makes a bit of room and slaps to deep point"
"shortish outside off, slapped to sweeper cover"

"a touch short this time, goes back to pull to deep square leg"
"back of a length on off stump, makes a bit of room and dabs towards backward point"
"smack! Head can really hit them over that leg side, and he gets a pretty decent ball, just short of a good length, on off stump, and he swivels through his hips to smash that over the midwicket boundary"
"length ball on off stump, punched hard to short extra-cover"
"back of a length, slants away from off stump to give Head just a bit of width, and he steps deep in his crease to cut it hard to the right of backward point"

length ball angling to leg stump from wide of the crease. Punched to short extra-cover
"short outside off, wrong'un that slightly stops on the batsman, goes back and punches to long-off"
"tossed up wide of off stump, and Carey puts it away well. Not the easiest shot to play, against the turn from outside off stump with a long-on and a deep midwicket on the rope, but he slog-sweeps and hits the gap"
"a bit flatter, and he goes down on one knee in a flash to slog-sweep flat, on the bounce, to deep midwicket"
"<b>dropped</b>. A bit of dip outside off stump for Hogg as he comes forward to drive with a slightly open face, and then some turn to find the outside edge. Went quickly to the keeper and it bounced out of his gloves"
"wrong'un, goes back and doesn't seem to have picked it. Hurries through an attempted flick but can't make contact, hits him on the thigh pad"
"that's a rubbish long-hop, but it stops on the pitch and barely reaches the batsman - it might have bounced twice before reaching the keeper had he left it. Aims a pull at the ball and manages to drag it down to long-on off the toe-end"
"fullish, wide of off stump. Was looking to make himself room in advance, and ends up too far from the ball to make any contact with his slash"
"shot. A slower ball on middle and leg, and he quickly opens up at the hips and clubs it into the gap between long-on and deep midwicket"
"nicely timed, but straight to the fielder! Full again, wide of off, and Carey middles his drive over the off side, but picks out the man sweeping on the cover boundary"
"back of a length outside off, chopped down to third man"
"shortish slower ball outside off, chops his attempted cut into the ground, to the right of backward point"
"back of a length on off stump, stays leg-side of the ball and punches to deep point"
"loopy full-toss wide of off stump, driven to sweeper cover"
"tossed up full on middle and off, looks to drive to long-on, I think, ends up bringing more bottom hand into it than he'd like and hits it to midwicket instead"
"slow, flighted ball outside off, sweeps powerfully along the ground to the right of deep square leg and the fielder does well to move quickly and stop it at the boundary"
"tossed up wide of off, swept to the left of deep midwicket"
"cleverly bowled. Similar line to the two previous deliveries, but Hogg slows this down just a touch. Through his sweep too early and doesn't connect. They go up to the third umpire to check for the stumping, but he hasn't dragged his foot out of the crease at all"
"back of a length, wrong'un. Looks to go back and punch down the ground, without picking the ball out of the bowler's hand, and the sudden turn into his pads forces him to jam his bat down and flick to midwicket instead"
"slower ball, full on off stump, gets on the front foot for a checked push to long-off"
another slower ball. On the pads this time and Ingram clips to deep midwicket
"very full, wide of off stump, flat-batted to long-off"
"short, wide, full-pace ball, cuts it straight to backward point"
"slower ball, back of a length. This is the offcutter, spinning away from the left-hander, and he steps back and across and brings his bottom hand to play to half-pull, half-whip that to the backward square leg boundary. Super shot"
"full on off stump, driven to short extra-cover"
"short, straightens towards off stump. Again it doesn't come on to the bat. Goes on the back foot and flat-bats it back towards the bowler, on the bounce. He gets his hands to it but can't hold on. They scamper one as the ball rolls into the mid-off region"
"floated up outside off, and that's a super shot. The flat, hard sweep, and he bisects deep backward square leg and deep midwicket"
"and again, smashed into that same gap between deep backward square leg and deep midwicket. This time it's a short ball, and he swivels quickly through a pull"
"tossed up slow on middle stump, driven to long-on"
"slow, flighted ball on off stump, and now Head puts Hogg away. Down on one knee, slightly open at the hips, and slog-sweeps just beyond the rope to the right of deep midwicket"

"fullish, slanting across the left-hander, flat-batted firmly but straight to extra-cover"
"full on off stump, driven to the right of long-off"

"extremely wide yorker, reaches out but can't connect, and the umpire signals wide"
"slower ball slanting away from off stump, and that's halfway deliberate. A wristy slice to find the gap to the right of short third man"

"shortish, skids through at just over stump height and doesn't miss off stump by much after beating Ingram's attempted pull"
"slowish yorker outside off, whipped down to long-on"
"oh my. Looks to bowl the slower one, I think, and lets slip a hip-high full-toss outside off. Signalled no-ball after the batsman slashes and misses"
"nicely bowled. A very slow slower one slanting away from off stump. Ingram begins his slog too early, stops his bat-swing, and tries to make up for the slowness of the ball with a flick of his wrist, but can't connect"
"fullish outside off, eased to deep point"
"in the blockhole on off stump, jabbed down to long-on"
"again, very full, just outside off. Clears his front leg to play a wristy drive to long-off"
down the track and Pollard spots him coming. Slants one wide of his off stump. Brings his bottom hand into play to swipe that to long-on
and Head smacks him over cover first ball. Full and wide of off stump and he flat-bats that hard over the man at extra-cover
"back of a length offcutter wide of off stump - very, very wide of off stump, and the umpire signals wide after Head has a slash at it"
"full on off stump, clears his front leg to jab it down to long-on and bring up his fifty"
"fullish slower ball close to off stump, swiped down to long-on"
"full outside off, driven back powerfully and makes the non-striker jump to protect himself, but only gets one for it - long-off is nice and straight"
"short slower one angling away from off stump, chopped to short third man"
"full and wide of off stump, reaches out to drive towards long-off. Doesn't really middle it, and perhaps that allows the batsmen the time to turn around and sprint back for a second"
"slower ball tight on the stumps, slanting from middle and leg to off stump. Makes a bit of room and chops into the point region"
"full-pace yorker on off stump, stabbed to extra-cover"

"slower ball, full, on off stump, swiped to the right of deep midwicket"
"dipping full ball on leg stump, clipped down to long-on"
"slower ball, 88kph, on middle stump, quite full. Swipes across the line towards deep backward square leg"
"full on off stump, goes back and clears his front leg to whip that to deep midwicket"
"short outside off, and Ingram's bottom hand does its magic again. Steps back and across and just swats that over the midwicket boundary. Bam."
"shot! That's a full-toss angling across to off stump - which is pretty much towards the batsman as he leans across, shaping for the scoop over short fine-leg. Was that over waist high? Not called no-ball, but in any case, he uses his wrists and flips that into the gap to the left of short fine leg"
"Colin Ingram's bottom wrist is just sensational. A length ball, slower ball, on off stump. He whips it across the angle, manufactures all the power himself, and clears the midwicket boundary with a hard, flat flick. Wow"
"full outside off, driven away to deep cover"
in the blockhole on off stump. Clears his front leg to create swinging room and smashes it hard down the ground. Hits the stumps at the other end and rolls away towards deep midwicket
"full and outside off, by a fair distance, the left-hander goes for a slog and misses altogether"
deflects off the bottom edge as he charges down the pitch and a very wide ball that he does well to turn into a full toss ends up crashing into the stumps. The things we see in a T20...
"full and outside off, drives to long-off"
slower ball which Ingram tries to reverse swat to the third man boundary. Can't touch this.
"full and outside leg, he swings hard, but can't get to it again"
"gets under a length ball, at his usual pace, and launches it out to the square leg boundary. Sensational shot. Bottom hand and bat speed."
"again! Over midwicket. And this one's even longer! It's length again, and it's off-pace. Ingram sets up in power position, right leg out of the way, left leg braced on the ground. And then out comes the big swing of the bat."
walks at the bowler to nudge a good length ball on off stump to deep midwicket
"gets across his stumps, which Bravo spots, and bowls short and down leg. Wells manages to pull it to long leg"
"yorker, at 137 kph, aimed at the toes of the right-hander. Wells deflects it to long leg"
"good yorker, but it's been called wide for being few inches outside leg stump. Only reason it didn't hit Ingram's feet is because he had moved across his stumps looking for a big hit"
into the crowd at midwicket as he meets a low full toss with the fiercest of whips
"takes it on the second attempt, and in trying to do so, he lands on his left shoulder. White is the man, almost bumbling a straightforward chance after Ingram backs away but is denied pace from the bowler"
walks all the way across his stumps - giving a free sight of it - and sweeps it short fine leg. Hogg has to juggle it a couple of times before taking it
"length ball slanting across to off stump, clipped away through midwicket"
"full, slanting into a fourth-stump line. Shuffles across to clip to mid-on"
"length ball on leg stump, clipped to deep square leg"

"back of a length on off stump, shuffles across to work it through square leg"
"full outside off, driven crisply but straight to cover point"
"back of a length on off stump, opens his bat face to dab to backward point"
"shortish on off stump, gets on his toes for a jab to the left of mid-on"
"yorker, angling into the batsman's feet. Just about jams his bat down in time and gets a thick inside edge that rolls into the leg side. Just saw a replay. It missed his inside edge and hit his back pad. Impact well outside leg stump, though"
"back of a length on off stump, opens his bat face and dabs towards backward point"
"back of a length outside off, opens his bat face to guide it down to third man"
Shot! That's full on off stump and he brings his wrists into play for a gorgeous drive to the left of mid-on

"short outside off, leans back and cuts to third man"
"length ball angling across to off stump, clipped to the left of midwicket"
"fullish on middle stump, whipped away to the right of deep square leg"

"shot. A length ball slanting away from off stump, and Harris opens his bat face and slices it away over backward point. Excellent quick hands"
"length ball on off stump, defended into the covers"
"short on off stump, pulled downwards with a nice turn of the wrists, but straight to midwicket"
"length ball on off stump, clipped to the left of midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, defended into the covers"
"short on leg stump, and he skips away from leg stump, makes himself room, and uppercuts it over the keeper. The Renegades are off to a bit of a flier here"
"shortish, wide of off, carved to backward point. He'll be disappointed he hit it straight to the fielder"
"back of a length close to off stump, gets on his toes to defend to backward point"
"length ball outside off, and Siddle has struck. Ludeman goes for a angled-bat drive through the covers and only manages a thin edge through to Carey"
"back of a length outside off, shuffles across and jabs to the left of backward point"
in the blockhole outside off. Harris clips it back to the bowler
"length ball on leg stump and Harris whips it high in the air, into the gap between deep midwicket and deep square leg. Drops down four-fifths of the way to the boundary and Lehmann, running to his left from deep midwicket, can't quite reach it on the slide"
"back of a length outside off, chopped down to backward point"
"full on off stump, clipped to midwicket"
"slower length ball close to off stump, presses forward and dabs to backward point with an open bat face"

"once again, back of a length and tight on off stump. Punched back to the bowler"

"Tossed up wide of off stump, reaches out to drive and slices it to the right of backward point"
"quick legbreak outside off and White, pressing forward, plays down the wrong line in defence"
wrong'un. White sees the initial line and gets down quickly for a reverse-swat towards backward point

"full-toss wide of off stump, carved in the air, to the left of third man"
"full on off stump, whipped to deep midwicket"

"full on middle stump, clipped to long-on"
"flighted ball wide of off, swept hard, along the floor, to deep midwicket"
"Now Harris looks to sweep from off stump, only manages a bottom edge that trickles down to short fine leg"
"googly wide of off stump, that's too short to reverse-sweep, and he can't connect. Went for the shot looking at the line, but he would have been a lot better served trying to cut that."
"all those quiet overs have produced that shot, and this wicket. This is a length ball angling across to off stump, and he slogs across it, against the angle, and only manages a top-edge. Climbs high into the sky and the keeper Carey, sprinting to his right and throwing himself flat on the ground, takes an excellent catch"
"ooh. Shuffles across his stumps, and perhaps spotting that Stanlake fires a fullish ball, aiming at leg stump. Ends up sending it down the leg side, but White definitely did expose his stumps with that shuffle"

"back of a length, skids on towards off stump, goes back to whip to deep midwicket"
"slower short ball outside off, pulled to deep midwicket"
"Ah, here's one. A length ball angling into off stump and Cooper walks across and scoops it away, over short fine leg"
"slower bouncer over middle stump, and suddenly the Renegades have two fours in two balls. Hooks it away without getting too much power on it, but the placement is good, too far to the right of deep square leg for the fielder to be able to pull it back with the dive"
"bowled him! He knows White has been trying to sweep him whenever he can, and he bowls a flat, good-length googly, but holds the pace back a bit. White swings across it too early and the ball pegs back off stump"
"quickish legbreak on middle stump, defended back down the pitch"
"back of a length on off stump, clipped gently towards deep midwicket and they scamper two"
googly turning into middle stump. Pollard presses forward and clips with the turn to the left of short fine leg
"shortish, wide of off, quick turn to beat the attempted cut"
"short outside off but it's the googly, not much turn but enough to cut down the width Cooper has to cut. Chops it to the right of backward point"
"length ball, slower ball, outside off, and Cooper mishits it for six! Was he really looking to hit that over long-on? I'm not sure. I think he was looking to hit over mid-off, but he's into it early, doesn't really get all of it, but it just about carries over the rope, to the left of the fielder on the boundary"
"Ooh, there's an appeal for a run-out here. Direct hit, and they've gone to the third umpire, but a big stretch from the big man and Pollard is home, just about. A clip into the midwicket region, and they chanced a second run as Neser chased right from long-on and made a sliding stop. Excellent throw"
"yorker, and he's just missed off stump as Cooper's walked all around the crease and missed an attempted reverse-scoop"
"low full-toss outside off, flat-batted into the deep to the right of sweeper cover"
"back of a length, angling across to off stump, pulled to deep midwicket"
"high full-toss, I think just over waist height, and it's at Pollard's hip. Just gets enough bat on it to tuck it down to the fine leg boundary"
"yorker on middle and leg, clipped to long-on and it takes its time getting to the fielder, allowing the batsmen to pick up another two"
"back of a length close to off stump, Cooper looks for the pull, and he ends up getting a top-edge that shoots up nearly vertically. Carey, behind the stumps, only has to move a couple of steps to his left to take the catch"

"full now, angling into leg stump, whipped away through square leg"
"back of a length outside off, clubbed to long-on"

"shortish ball over off stump, sneaks below Bravo's bat as he swivels through an attempted pull. Probably beat him for pace too - that was 151kph"
"fullish on off and middle, clipped towards deep midwicket"
"tossed up wide of off, Bravo looks to launch that over long-off, and the dip and turn makes him slice it squarer than intended. All of that is just the precursor to a TRULY ASTONISHING CATCH. Laughlin sprints to his left from long-off, catches it when he's running at full tilt, headed towards the rope. He sends a back-hand flick back into the field of play just as he jumps over, and Jake Weatherald, coming the other way from sweeper cover, has to complete it by throwing himself to his left because Laughlin has flicked it flat and hard and a long way infield. Weatherald grabs it with both hands, at full stretch"
"tossed up wide of off, this time it's fuller and he lofts it just beyond the reach of Laughlin flinging himself to his left after sprinting from long-off"
"back of a length on off stump, whipped away to deep midwicket"
"back of a length outside off, chopped to backward point"
"flighted ball on leg stump, and Hodge has swept him for six over deep square leg. The man on the boundary is the tallest man on the field, Billy Stanklake, but even he can't catch that, despite adding a few more feet to the equation with a  jump and a stretch"
"slower ball on the stumps, and Pollard goes after it - he has to - and picks out deep midwicket. Probably wanted to hit it to the fielder's left, but there's a bit of offcut on the ball and it causes him to hit it squarer than he'd have liked to"
"full outswinger wide of off, driven to the right of deep point"
"slower short ball wide of off, signalled wide after Hodge lets it go"

"slower ball, full, looks to slog it away and only ends up hitting it back to the bowler in his follow-through. The ball either bounced on the ground, very close to his bat, or straight up off his left foot. They're checking with the third umpire and it's bounced on the ground, so it isn't a c&b. Siddle also missed the stumps at the keeper's end with the batsman quite a way out of his ground"
"yorker outside off, slapped straight to extra-cover"
"very full again, heaved to deep midwicket"
"slower short ball, and Wildermuth has swatted that down the throat of deep square leg coming in off the boundary"
"slower full ball wide of off stump, Hodge slashes and misses"

that late outswing again. A full-toss outside off and he slaps it to the right of sweeper cover
"in the blockhole, just outside off, squeezed to the left of extra-cover"
"high full-toss on off stump, immediately signalled no-ball. Opens up and looks to hoick it away. Hits him on the glove (?) and rolls into the point region"
"the bails start flashing as he does Hodge in with a slower, outswinging yorker. Plays all around it, but it's a free-hit, and the ball hits off stump and runs away to the third man boundary. Maybe a thin edge on it too - the umpire doesn't signal byes"
"wide yorker, jabbed to the left of extra-cover"
"yorker angling down leg. The batsman was looking to make room, and it squeezes between his legs as he misses a flick and rolls down to the keeper"
"full-toss on leg stump, and Hodge has smashed this into the third tier beyond deep backward square leg. Was this over waist height too?"
"wide yorker, Hodge can't connect with the open-faced stab"
"full outside off, and Hodge lifts it over extra-cover and picks up another four"
"another full-toss, angling into leg stump, Hodge opens up and whips it away for another six over deep square leg"
