"overpitched full outside off,  lands just inside the guidelines. Terrific delivery. Dot ball as the batsman can't reach out to it"
"full and wide outside off, crunched off the front foot to deep point. Green will keep the strike. <b>Fourteen needed for Thunder to keep their season alive</b>"
"full outside off, tries to slog this over the bowler's head, but this time Green slices it. In the air, and it's taken by the man at point. Slight drift away from the fielder as the ball comes down to Earth, but he composes himself and completes the catch"
"slower ball on off stump, muscled towards the leg side. Not hit hard enough, and allows the batsman to complete another second"
"yorker on leg stump, pinged to deep midwicket as he hits it too well. No chance of a second run here. No. 11 will have to face the next ball"
"back of a length outside off stump, slower ball that Fawad can't pull. Misses the shot, and it shoud've been a wide with the ball going over his head. But it's called a dot"
"low full toss on off stump, bunted to midwicket for only a single"
"slower ball full on middle stump, McClenaghan misses the slog and that's lbw. Impact in front of middle stump and <b>Renegades win by nine runs!</b> Renegades move to third for now, but not confirmed of qualification yet. They still have a game to go. <b>Sydney Thunder are eliminated.</b>"
