"full and into the pads, shoveled off the front foot to deep square"
<b>taken at sweeper cover.</b> Meredith brings a wicket in the middle overs again. Looks like an offcutter. Full and just outside off. Conway looks to drill that through the off side and ends up opening the face too much. Off the thick outside edge and straight to the fielder
<b>lbw given and Williamson reviews.</b> Length ball pins him on the flap of the front leg as he looks to turn it into the leg side. Was on a leg stump line with the angle possibly taking that down.

<b>pulled in front of square.</b> Short and sitting up at hip height. Stays put in the crease and slaps it on the rise

"<b>taken at short fine.</b> Looks to pump this short of a length delivery over deep midwicket but it gets big on him. A top edge is all he can get and Marsh takes a simple one around the corner. Guptill walks off to a standing ovation, he's set New Zealand up for a series win"
