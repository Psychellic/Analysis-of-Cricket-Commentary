short and very wide. Raina won't chase.
full toss outside off. Can't get the full swing under this slog. Hits it straight to long-on

<b>get out of the way.</b> He has bludgeoned this. An overpitched ball on off stump and a murderous swing under it to send it past the cameraman straight above the sightscreen

"<b>bowled him!</b> A tired shot from Rohit, who misses out on a third T20I ton. It's a length ball on leg stump. Everything you want at this stage. He slogs at it and can't get anywhere near making contact. It tonks the top of leg stump"
<B>past the glove</b> as he looks to play the hook. And not called wide. This bouncer looked to be well down leg side.
"<b>another at deep midwicket!</b> Length ball on leg stump, clears the front foot and slogs, finds the fielder. As easy as that. Four wickets for Chase."

"short of a length in the corridor. Allows it to come on and drops it into the off side, behind point"
"<b>top edge</b> taken by mid-on. Too fast for the pull. Awful position with the legs, not optimal with the hands. Stirling not close to being behind the line of this. It loops up and Kuldeep takes this just behind the umpire"
length ball speared in at off stump. Defends into the off side
"<b>oh that's close!</b> It's got to be bat, if that's not out. Front foot planted right across the stumps as he seemingly misses this attempted flick....oh yes, there is an inside edge. Good decision."
"length ball down leg side, whips and misses"
nicely put away. Gets up with the bounce on this short of a length ball and lofts it handsomely over square leg

"slower bouncer on leg stump, hooked to fine leg"
