"a gentle push to mid-off, rather like the start of a sparring match where the fighters are testing each other's reflexes"
"some movement off the pitch, and solid carry through to the keeper too. Rahane's hands venture out, but his feet don't, and therefore he is beaten"
that's a bit poor. Rahane has every opportunity to cut this away - plenty of width - but he is again not moving his feet well enough.
"opens the face and with the ball coming in at off stump, he is able to run it down to third man"
"zips past his flick, but since it does so down the leg side, the umpire penalises Umesh"
"<b>dropped</b>, but look at all this pace and bounce! Yet the speed gun says this is only 132. Umesh hits back of a length, Tripathi pokes outside off stump with an angled bat. There's the slightest outside edge, but all the pace the bowler puts, and the hardness on this pitch, ensures that is enough to take it over the wicketkeeper's reach on his right"
"backs away to try and slap a length ball right through the line on the off side, but is again confounded by the rapid pace in this pitch"
opens the face and runs the back of a length delivery outside off to deep third man
"swivels on his back foot to pull a shortish delivery, into the body, to long leg"
"<b>try hitting that</b>. This is Test match bowling on a Test match pitch in a T20 match. Woakes makes it seam away off the pitch, and it climbs all the way up towards Rahane's chest outside off. The batsmen tries to block but he's comfortably left behind"
brings his bat up towards the shortish delivery outside off and runs it to deep third man
"137 kph, this is shortish on middle and off, Tripathi loads up with the pull a touch too early and inside edges onto his pads. Quick single taken"
can't be bowling there on any kind of surface. Half-volley on middle and leg and Rahane clips it to the midwicket boundary effortlessly
superb hit. Looks like these boys are getting used to the pace here. Tripathi comes forward to a good length ball and drills it through the covers. On the up and bam!
"and the angry fast bowler comes back with a bouncer, making Tripathi duck for cover. The ump calls it wide for height"
"shortish on off stump, he blocks to one of two short covers"
"slots one in the blockhole outside off, Tripathi slices it to deep third man"
"good length ball on off stump, pushes into the covers"
cramps him for room and allows him only one scoring shot - the flick to midwicket
"sprints down the pitch and belts it through the gap at cover. There are two men in the region, so while he is charging out, he makes room for himself, and then when he makes connection with the good length ball on leg stump, he opens the face just enough"
"good length ball, drifts down leg as Rahane misses the flick"
"good length ball on off stump, turns it through midwicket"
takes a good length ball from outside off and works it down to long-on
pushes it through to long-on
"appeal for a stumping. Beautiful work from Narine to set it all up, he knows Tripathi is a batsman who goes hard at the ball, so he treats him to a ball that pitches on a good length and zips away past the outside edge. Tripathi has not read it off the hand, his back leg has come out, but Uthappa takes too long to gather and break the stumps"
""
"good length ball on off stump, turning away, Rahane keeps back, ready to flick, and then checks his shot upon reading it off the pitch"
"short and wide outside off, carves it to deep third man"
"sees the chance for a dab to third man, but he isn't quite able to direct it past the wicketkeeper"
"tonks it over the bowler's head, and it has just enough power to become a baby six. Takes a good length ball and slaps it with almost a cross-bat"
flicks it away through to deep midwicket
"skips down the track, turns a fullish delivery into a half-volley and bazooka's it to the straight boundary"
"punches a full delivery, angled into him, to mid-on. Great timing again."
"loops it up onto middle and leg, Narine taps it towards square leg"
"backs away and slaps him over point. He is playing Narine on length, positioning himself outside leg to make sure he has the room to free the arms"
"quicker delivery - good ploy from Narine, doesn't allow the batsman time to move in his crease - on middle and off. Tripathi also does well to open the face as he blocks to pinch a single to point"
"good length and outside off, Rahane shuffles across and whips it to midwicket"
"the second a slower delivery comes his way... it's tossed up too, and Tripathi gets on one knee and sweeps it to the right of the square leg fielder"
"another tossed up delivery gets the treatment. Tripathi loves the chance to get under Narine's deliveries and slogs it away, to the left of square leg this time"
"back of a length on off stump, punches it to long-on"
"<b>dropped</b> by Yusuf running back from midwicket. This is perhaps a catch for long-on. But the fact that he is on the boundary sows doubt into Yusuf's mind, so he takes the call to go for it. Tripathi, meanwhile, is watching it all, having played an awful slog to a back of a length ball on off stump. Finally, when the ball slips through Yusuf's hands, he breathes easy"
"fuller delivery on off stump, pushes to cover"
"back of a length on off stump, pushes to long-on"
"pushes it into the covers, they think of a single, but point is quickly onto the ball. There is no need to throw, however, but he does and gives away an overthrow"
"full on off stump, drives to long-off"
"mistimed... opportunity.... oh, but it falls past the reach of Gambhir at short cover. A shortish legspinner sticks in the pitch and Rahane, looking to go deep in his crease and flick it to midwicket, nearly popped a catch"
"goes back to cut a quicker, flatter delivery to point"
guides it towards backward point
"hangs back, even to a fullish delivery, because that's how good he is with the dab to third man. Takes it almost out of Uthappa's gloves. Short third man does his job well"
"through him and Chawla gives him a kiss too. This is the googly, quicker, flatter. Tempts Tripathi into a cut, which suggests he was looking for the ball to spin away. And when it doesn't, he just inside edges it onto his stumps"
"googly keeps low, but Smith has shown the capability to handle those deliveries before. That broad, straight bat comes down on the ball to protect the off stump"
"full on off stump, sent down to long-on"
falls just short of short midwicket. Smith seems to be into the flick a touch too early and the half-volley almost becomes a wicket-taking ball
"carves it through to the sweeper, and Smith is eager for the second run as well. Puts in a dive as well. Should be safe, it isn't a direct hit. And he is. Excellent technique. Bat face pointing down to make sure it doesn't bounce as he hits the ground"
"whips it away to deep square leg, loves those balls coming into middle and leg"
"back of a length and outside off, pushes it to long-off"
continues finding gaps on the leg side off balls meant to find sanctuary in the off-stump corridor. Shuffles that little bit across to spoil their happily ever after
"loops it up onto off stump, Rahane nurdles it to long-on. Only going at a run a ball"
opens the face to a flighted delivery outside off and slots it to the right of backward point
"almost does him in! Super stuff from Chawla, seeing Rahane advance, and instantly bowling it flatter and wider. The batsman tries to adjust his shot and dab it towards point, but he is still beaten. Props to him to still find a way to plant the back leg back"
"offers a little room, and a little flight, and Rahane sweeps it strongly to deep square leg boundary"
leans on the tossed up ball outside off and drills it to long-on
"goes wide of the crease to try and give Smith a few more things to think about. The ball is turning, just enough, for KKR to be troublesome. Smith drives to point, but the fielder doesn't get down in time. That's terrribly poor"
"too short, and Rahane takes full toll. Kuldeep's introduction is a bit of a sour one. No sooner does he deliver the long hop is it hurtling to the midwicket boundary"
"<b>lbw appeal</b> as Rahane is totally deceived by the googly. Lunges forward to a flighted delivery, but doesn't get to the pitch. Closes the face of the bat, thinking it would spin into him. But it goes the other way and hits the back pad. Umpire says no, and replays indicate it would miss off stump"
"nails the sweep, taking a flighted delivery from outside off to deep square leg"
<b>totally squared up</b> as he is preparing to sweep and suddenly has to bail out of the shot because this is a googly. Defends
loops it on off stump and Smith knocks it to long-on
"reads the googly this time, coming forward to block outside off"
"charges out, but he gives his intentions away too early. Chawla fires it flat, and into the leg side, forcing the batsman into a tangle and getting a dot"
throws it up outside off and Smith spears it to the sweeper cover
"gets outside leg, Chawla follows him, and all that means a flick to long-on. Rahane does well though, in timing the shot softly enough to get two"
lifts it over extra cover. Magnificent. He drifts outside leg and does so late enough that Chawla can't adjust. That allows him to munch on a half-volley on middle and leg
"tucks it through to long-on, and he makes sure, again, it is hit gently enough to find two runs to long-on"
gets in the googly to keep the last ball to a dot. Rahane blocks to the right of the bowler
"splits the men at deep square leg and deep midwicket and so confident is he of doing that that he doesn't even keep the ball down. Sweep, without getting down on his knee"
"moves back, expecting the ball to be flat after the boundary previous ball, flicks it through midwicket. Hustles across for the second too, putting in a spectacular dive"
nudges it through the gap at midwicket
"goes for the sweep, probably seeing the flight on the ball, and gets a single to deep square leg"
stands tall and belts a half-volley to long-on
"moves outside leg, that backlift becoming bigger, but when it comes down, he only attempt a push to short cover."
"shortish and outside off, Smith looks for the cut shot, putting his all into the shot. So naturally he gets an outside edge to the third man boundary"
"opens the face to try and pick the gap between short third man and backward point, but Yusuf puts in the dive to keep it to a single"
"another appeal for a stumping, but Rahane seems to have his back foot planted down behind the crease. Oh wait, replays indicate otherwise. Good bowling from Narine, going wider outside off when he sees the batsman making room outside leg. Rahane cuts at it desperately, and is fast losing balance now. He tries dragging his foot back and then he has no choice but to lift it up and plonk it down and it is at that very moment that Uthappa breaks the stumps. Lucky break"
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
"shortish and outside off, Dhoni slices it to the sweeper"
whips it through to deep midwicket
"tosses it up outside off, Smith drives to deep cover"
"charges out, but gets too close to the ball outside off. Eventually, jams the bat down and drives to long-off. Overthrows offer him to get back on strike"
"right through short midwicket. Dhoni's power has the man utterly bewildered. Yusuf is the man there, refusing to get down and as a result the ball races off to the boundary"
"up and over! Skips down the track, gets under the length ball and launches it over long-off to roars of 'Dho-ni! Dho-ni! Dho-ni! Dho-ni!'"
"advances again, this time Chawla pushes the ball onto the pads to cramp Dhoni. Flick to square leg"
moves across to work a quicker delivery on off stump to deep square leg
"starts with a googly, and Smith misjudges it. Brings the bat across from gully in front of his pad on leg stump. Leading edge drops safely"
swipes a fuller delivery over to long-on for a couple
"deceives the batsman with a googly, with Smith looking for a push to long-on and being beaten on the outside edge"
stays deep in his crease and nails a flighted delivery to long-on
"and then all stare as the ball just lobs them. Gifts him a long hop and Dhoni leaps back in his crease and pulls. Still only gets a top edge, but that's enough to get him six over midwicket on his right"
"more iffy fielding from KKR. Dhoni dabs it towards point and pinches a single. Darren Bravo looks to run him out with a direct hit, but misses. Dhoni is then alert enough to steal the overthrow too"
"offers width and it leads to a painful result. Perhaps Narine is trying to keep the ball away from Smith's reach. But as he plays the cut, he gets an under edge to the third man boundary"
yanks it to long-on
"tosses it up outside off, Dhoni lunges forward with a block to cover. He's teasing the fielders, making his ground in time and watching throws fly past the stumps. Looks for the overthrow again, but this time no luck"
taps it towards backward point
"full delivery on off stump, Smith slogs it to deep square leg"
"shortish and outside off, slices it towards short third man"
nudges it towards deep midwicket
"topples him with the googly! Kuldeep rises above the pressure! This is the 18th over, and MS Dhoni is on strike. He mauls spinners. And he comes down the track looking to do the same to young Kuldeep. But the left-arm wristspinner sneaks in the googly, makes sure it is flat and pitches it on a length that Dhoni can't get under. Best of all, Kuldeep sees Dhoni unable to pick the variation and though he tries to adjust, the ball spins past his defences and Uthappa does the rest"
sweeps it to deep square leg
"shortish and outside off, Smith pats it to deep extra cover"
"it's the wrong 'un again and another batsman fails to pick it. Uthappa goes up for a stumping and he's pretty confident. And the replays show why. Tiwary, who has been a prolific hitter for Pune, down the order has been sent packing. Pays the price for lunging at a flighted ball, thinking it would turn into him, playing across the line, and allowing it to sneak through bat and pad"
"outside edge as another batsman is foxed by the wrong 'un. Christian looks to flick a good length ball, but it zips in away in the opposite direction. There were two slips waiting for the false shot, but the ball goes past the second's right. What an over from the 22-year old. Two wickets and only five runs"
"yorker on off stump, works it to deep midwicket for a couple"
"low full toss on off stump, whips it away to deep square leg"
"full and outside off, muscles it to long-on"
full and wide outside off - that's top work from from Woakes because Smith is moving away outside leg and suddenly has to change all his plans. Reaches out and bunts it to mid-off
"goes short and angles it into the right-hander, it's off-pace as well, Christian goes for a pull and fails to connect."
smashes it into the crowd over cover. The one ball that every batsman wants at this stage - length. Christian does well to target the off side - the line is wide but so many batsmen at this stage look solely at the leg side.
"and again, he gives the big-hitter Christian all the leverage he needs and watches another length ball disappear over wide long-on"
"what a strike! This is full and wide, and Smith slices it over point. There is no power in this. Just pure timing. Pure class"
"yorker on off stump, Smith grinds it out to point and gets his fifty"
"legcutter slower ball, and it comes off the pitch so slowly but gets really really high too. Christian is waiting, with his bat high over his head, waiting and waiting and waiting. And then pokes the bat up like a periscope to get a single to point"
"cramps him up with a quick delivery on the pads, Christian doesn't connect with a flick, but takes the leg bye"
"looks for the yorker, wide outside off stump, he strays though, outside the guideline. Christian, making room, can't reach it. But he does respond to the call for a bye"
"full and outside off, punches it to mid-off. Had he placed it any wider, he could have got a four. There was no one on the boundary in front on the off side"
"full toss on middle stump, Christian looks for the big hit, but he picks out deep midwicket. All said and done though, this is a pretty good total"
"great first delivery. Very full, angling in on off and middle and moving away sharply off the seam. Tremendous seam position. Narine tries to jam the bat down with an open face and gets beaten"
"and that's the batsman's response. Poor delivery from Unadkat, though. Drops it short after an extra slip comes in. Narine flays it over the in-field on the off side and gets it away to sweeper cover"
"short of a length, angled in at the batsman, Narine tries to tuck it fine off the hips but cannot make contact and the ball goes down the leg side"
"fuller, outside off, Narine tries to work it across the line. But there is a drop in pace that is not picked by the batsman, Narine closes the face early and chips it in the direction of mid-on"
"back of a length, outside off, opens the face of his bat and stabs it to the backward point region"
"good length, outside off, drops it in front of gully and takes off for a quick single"
"and again, Narine tries to whip it across the line, he has to play it from outside off, this one comes on at a fullish length and finds the inside edge of Narine's bat before going through midwicket"
"shortish, outside off, tries to cut but the ball does not bounce as much and he gets beaten"
"and this time he tries to fetch a pull from outside off and swings hard, done in by the lack of bounce and makes no contact"
"crunched. Fullish, outside off, not the prettiest of drives from Narine but effective. Keeps the front leg away from the line, does not try to get behind the line and just drives between mid-off and extra cover"
"and this time he gets an outside edge. Tries to force this fuller ball through the off side, away to square third man"
backs away early and tries to get the front leg out of the way. But the bowler follows him with a length delivery on leg stump and Narine makes no contact as he tries to pull it away
"fullish, on leg, misses the attempted flick of the batsman and raps him on the pad. Optimistic appeal for lbw from the bowler but that seemed like it would miss leg"
"sliding on leg, fullish, clipped away to midwicket for one"
"on a length but drifting on leg, tries to tuck it fine and wears it on the pad instead"
"short of a length and not much turn outside off, stabs it towards point for one"
"they go up for a run out. And, guess what! That's gone by a comfortable distance. Great piece of fielding from the short fine leg fielder. Gambhir tucks it late and they take off for a single. Narine is not quick enough as Shardul Thakur at short fine dives forward and hurls a throw to MS Dhoni who just flicks it on to the stumps. Helps it on its way in true Dhoni style"
"short of a length, no turn, punched off the backfoot to backward point"
"goes for an ill-advised sweep from outside off, it's too full and he cannot get low enough to make contact, off the pads and into the off side. Big appeal for lbw, but seems like the impact was outside off"
"short of a length, down the leg side, misses Uthappa's bat as he tries to tuck off the pad"
"good length ball, knocks it back to the bowler who gets a hand to it and pushes it away in the direction of mid-on"
"full, driven to mid-on who makes a diving stop"
fires this wide outside off and Uthappa swings hard and misses
"not great connection but sees mid-on inside the circle and takes his chance. Full, outside off, cross-seam delivery, so it does not come on as well as Uthappa would have liked, lofts it over and one-bounce over the long-on boundary"
""
"short of a length, pitching outside leg, Gambhir turns it away behind square as he jumps up to get on top of the bounce"
"too close to cut. Gambhir gets beaten outside off and slightly moves outside the crease. It's on a length and just comes on with the arm, Dhoni makes an appeal but the umpire wasn't interested in it. Gambhir had done okay"
"drifting in on the pads, turned away to midwicket"
"shortish, comes on with the arm, Gambhir makes room and slaps it out to point"
cut again off the backfoot and this time he has pierced the field. Gets slightly more width to open up as well and intercepts point and backward point
"tries to flick it away to the leg side, back of a length, but changes his mind late and ends up knocking it back to the bowler"
"overpitched, outside off, hammers a drive through extra cover"
"was the deliberate from the batsman? Back of a length, just outside off, opens the face of his bat late and runs it down to third man"
"stops on him slightly, not much pace. On a length and Uthappa chips it in the air as he closes the face of his bat early"
"width on offer outside off, crashes it out to sweeper cover"
"back of a length, was that the cutter? Seems to cut into Uthappa as he gets an inside edge to the pad"
"short and wide, opens up his arms and flays hard but misses"
"full, outside off, Gambhir targets a big hit down the ground. Clears the front leg and comes up with a full swing of the bat. Gets comprehensively beaten outside off. He was done in by the angle, probably expected it to angle into him but it came on straight with the arm"
"short of a length, does not turn much and Uthappa opens the bat face late to short third man"
"just over the top of extra cover. Fuller, outside off, slanted across and Gambhir plants the front foot out of the way and chips it over"
gets down for a slog sweep and this one slightly spins away and he gets an inside edge back towards the bowler
<b>dropped</b> Jaydev Unadkat makes a mess of a chance at deep midwicket. It's another slog sweep gone wrong. Uthappa gets a lot of elevation but not the desired distance. Unadkat just falls backwards as he tries to take it  and falls down. It was an overhead catch and the head almost bangs his head against the turf even as the ball goes into the boundary
""
hammered through long-off. Comes down the track and gets on top of it before crashing it straight and hard
"deft. Uses the pace on that delivery. Short of a length, not much width on offer outside off, hangs back in the crease and beats short third man, gets it finer with an open bat face"
"full, outside off, gets the front foot out and smokes it over long-off. Clean hit"
"pitched outside off, right in the slot for Uthappa who gets on top of it, meets the pitch and gets down on one knee before flat-batting it over long-on"

"full, outside off, it is overpitched and Gambhir lofts it over extra cover. Sweeper runs across to cut it off as the ball bounces in front of the boundary"

"comes forward and tries to flick it away into the leg side, chips it in the air, between mid-on and midwicket"
"back of a length, shuffles across and whips it away through midwicket"
"overpitched, too full, outside off, giving the batsman enough room. Uthappa is slightly out of the crease and that allows him to meet the pitch and loft it over long-on"
"slants it away from the right-hander this time and fires it wide outside off, not called  awide"
too close to off-stump but Uthappa dangerously opens the face of his bat and steers it to short third man

"good length ball, outside off, Gambir opens the face of his bat and runs it down to third man for one"

"short of a length, closes the face of his bat early as he tries to flick it into the leg side and ends up knocking it back to the bowler"
that is some serious improvisation. Walks across outside off early. It is short of a length and he gets down on one knee and just helps it along as he pulls it away to deep fine leg
"back of a length, angling down the leg side, misses the attempted tuck and goes off the pad towards fine leg"
"short, wide, slapped uppishly through backward point. Giving the batsman all the room he needs to flay it and pays the price"
"short of good length, on off, pulled off the backfoot to deep midwicket for one. That brings up <b>Uthappa's half-century</b>. What a blinder of an innings this has been."
"full, on the pads, works it around the corner as he tucks it just backward of square leg"
backs away to get the backfoot outside leg. It is full and is drilled out to deep point
"full, gives width outside off, Gambhir crunches a drive but straight to extra cover"
"<b>dropped</b>. Again. Washington Sundar this time. Gambhir gets a top-edge on this pull, perhaps didn't get the room he was looking for. This is a much tougher chance, to be fair. Sundar dives forward at short fine but just can't latch on to it"
"short, sitting up nicely for Uthappa and he pulls this with all the might he can muster. Clobbers it over deep midwicket and sends it sailing into the stands. They keep dropping it short, not learning from their msitakes"
"back of a length, Gambhir is happy to just tuck off the pads to deep square leg for one"
"short and angling in, too easy again, Uthappa swivels around and pulls it away to deep backward square, beats square leg running to his right at the deep"
"some width on offer outside off, Uthappa taps it and chops it in the direction of backward point"

"full and on middle and leg, turned away to deep fine leg with the angle"
"short, Gambhir pulls it away through square leg"
"oh, dear! Tell you what, that may have been a wide even if there was a pitch adjacent to it. Completely loses his line and fires this down the leg side, no chance the keeper is going to be able to get there, no need to try, in fact"

"short and wide, cut off the backfoot through point. Pushes back for the second as sweeper cover runs to his right and fires a throw to the keeper's end. Dhoni collects the ball and flicks it on to the stumps but he is comfortably inside. <b>Fifty for Gambhir</b>"
"full, outside off, drilled down to long-off"
"short and outside off, Gambhir jumps up to deal with the bounce and Gambhir slaps it uppishly over backward point"
"too short, Gambhir shapes up for a pull but sees the steep bounce and lets it go. Called a wide"

"back of a length, angling in, nudged around the corner to deep backward square leg for one"

"full, sliding in on leg, Uthappa backs away outside leg and slog sweeps it over deep midwicket. Into the stands, she goes"

"gone. Uthappa tries to finish it off with one final big flourish. It is short of a length, slower ball from Unadkat, who had rolled his fingers over it. Uthappa backs away and tries to slap it away with a flat bat, gets it off the top part of the bat to long-off, skews it in the air and sends it into the hands of Tripathi who runs back a few steps and snaffles it"
"back of a length, punched firmly to backward point"
"full and outside off, just has a poke at it without moving the feet, ball flies past the outside edge"
"back of a length, outside off, run down to third man with an open bat face. <b>First IPL runs for Darren Bravo</b>"
"full, wide, driven without feet and straight to extra cover"
"is that another one? Yes, it is. Gambhir this time, trying to pull one away but there was really no room for it. And it bounces too much for him too, skewed off the top edge straight into the hands on mid-on"
"sticks his bat out at this wide delivery, outside off, gets nowhere near it and the ball goes past the outside edge"
"back of a length, stabs it off the backfoot through point."
"that is the game. They finish it off with a boundary after all. Too full and outside off, Bravo drives crisply through covers"
