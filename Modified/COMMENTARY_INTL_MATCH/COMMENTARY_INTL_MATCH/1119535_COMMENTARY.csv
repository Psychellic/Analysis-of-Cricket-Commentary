"outside off, width and a welcome chance to leave the ball alone. A hint of swing at the ball goes by"

"jag off the seam, as the slope takes the ball away from the left-hander. Cook flinches involuntarily"
"pushed onto the back foot, tucked into the covers"

no shot offered

through to the keeper
"<strong>beautiful bowling</strong>, holds its line from back of a length and nips past the edge"
"wider line, Stoneman is able to let this one go with less fuss"
"<B>bowled him!</B> That is an absolute beauty and due reward for Abbas's diligence this morning. Full, threatening, seaming back through the gate, blasting the timbers with the batsman caught on the crease. Another failure for Stoneman, so here comes the skipper!"
"too straight from Amir, who is seeking swing but this one just drifts onto the pads and through square leg it goes"
"fenced through third man, another boundary, but this is a moral victory for the bowler... an open face and a thick outside edge"
"pushed onto the defensive, a sharp single, <B>a terrible single!</B> Babar at mid-off gathers, and Root wouldn't have been in the frame had the shy been accurate!"

"angled into the right-hander, and nudged to the leg side"

"better line, still a touch too wide to tempt Cook, who shoulders arms"

"more confidently onto the front foot, and thumped to cover"
"banged in short, over the shoulder and too far down the leg side for the umpire's liking"
"<strong>full, swinging, gone!</strong> That's a terrible miscalcuation from Root, Hasan dangled the bait, as unsubtle as a lump of seal blubber in a pond full of killer whales, and drew a massive wiping drive. A thin nick through to the keeper, and England's skipper departs in single figures!"
"pitched up, touch to straight to the southpaw and Malan gets off the mark first ball with a leg glance"
"nibbly length around middle and off, Cook defends with a straight bat"
"pushed through in the channel, 84mph and left alone"
"thudding into the pads, looked like it pitched leg side and Paul Reiffel shakes his head... but Sarfraz asks for the <b>review</b>. Uff, that is close, it <i>has</i> pitched in line, but Hawk-Eye reckons it would only have clipped the top of off stump, so it's <b>umpire's call</b> and Cook survives"
"short ball, Cook responds by knocking that into a cocked hat, rolls the wrists and batters pull square for four!"
"angled across the left-hander from over the wicket, 84mph but wide enough to ignore"
"leg-stump line once again, this time Cook does get some bat on it and jabs to midwicket"
"pitched up, but again it's on the pads and Malan wallops a boundary through backward square leg... he's flying, SR of 300"
"gottim, <b>Malan nicks behind!</b> Hasan has another, he's bounding around Lord's like Tigger in the Hundred Acre Wood... Finds his line to the lefty, lovely angle across and the ball just leaves Malan enough up the slope as he tries to drop his bat in defence. Thin edge, but Malan knew it, and immediately turns for the hutch"

"wheesh, licks from Hasan, 88mph and this nips back, a whisker away from the top of off as YJB shoulders arms"

"oh yes, nicely bowled again, this make Cook play and then feints past the outside edge"
"touch short outside off, lets this one go"

"excellent stuff from Ashraf, he's getting the ball to go here, whirring away as Cook hangs back and manages to draw his bat inside the line at the last moment"

"touch back of a length, lets this one zip through"
"full outside off and Cook latches on to a cover drive this time, picks out the fielder"
"pitched up, plinked back past the bowler for one fine of mid-off"

"round the wicket to Cook, who fences a little uncertainly at a rising ball in the channel"
comes across and taps this down defensively
"good pace, but wide enough for the batsman to leave"
"tricky stuff from Hasan, this hurtles back in from outside off stump, Cook trusts his angles and leaves"

"fullish, sliding into the pads and Cook filches a single to fine leg"
"pushed through on a length, no stroke required or offered"
"drifting away with the angle from over the wicket, 84mph and Cook leaves it be"
"spanked back past the bowler! Regal straight driving from Cook, waits for the bowler to come to him and then creams it past mid-off as if it was 2010-11 all over again"
"good length, touch wide and he's happy to watch it through"
"fractionally overpitched and Cook tucks in again! Driving with the ease of a young Nigel Mansell, this is Brands Hatched for four through cover"

"length ball, 87mph and no width on offer, tapped back down the track"
"tight on middle and off, Bairstow defends"

"a full tempter in the channel, YJB thrusts out the front pad and leaves"
"starts over the wicket, lobbed up full and Cook nurdles it away off the pads for a single"
"full and draws him forward, Bairstow pushes a drive into a gap"
"nicely looped, maybe a googly but Cook smothers it playing around his front pad"
pushes through the legbreak and Cook waits for it and clips with the spin through square leg
"flighted, around off stump and YJB tickles another single coming forwards"
"touch short, chopped into the leg side off the back foot"
"Amir spears it down outside off stump, no movement back in and Bairstow can leave comfortably enough"
"yowser, that's gone like a frisky puppy, pitching on the stumps and then swerving and bouncing late, completely kippers Bairstow but he's lucky not to get anything on it!"

"superb line to Cook, straightening the ball past the groping forward prod"

"<strong>wide on the crease and Bairstow is beaten on the outside edge!</strong> Completely out of the blue, he had been looking so solid, but seemed to play for the angle rather than the seam movement, and back goes the off stump!

"big appeal for a catch down the leg side! Those behind the wicket were keen, but Anderson not interested. Imam went to glance it away, super one-handed take low to his right but it's just thigh pad"
"short of a length, straight, Azhar a long way across his crease looking to work it away and the ball takes the thigh pad towards long leg"
"full outside off, better length, left alone"
"this is shorter and wider, a comfortable leave"
"gets one on the stumps, back of a length, defended"
this one jags back from short of a length and takes Imam on the thigh guard as he aims to leave ti alone
"full outside off, comes forward and drives, skews off a thick outside but safely fine of gully"
"full outside off, left alone"
"back of a length at off stump, defended to mid-on"
"full at off stump, and that's very good batting as he pushes into the covers and comes through for a quick single to rotate the strike"
"full, pushed down the leg side"
"he pulls the bat inside the line of a short-of-a-length delivery, looks good as carries through to Bairstow but again too short"
"fuller, outside off, carries through to Bairstow at chest height"
"full and straight, flicks across his front pad and finds midwicket"
was that bat or glove? Bairstow can't gather it with a dive down the leg side. It came off the hip
huge appeal for lbw! Tucker again says not out <b>Root calls the review</b>. If this has pitched in line it looks out. It's pitched in line and that's smashing middle and off. England have their breakthrough. Imam caught on the crease against a fullish delivery.
"finds a good length angling across outside off, beats the outside edge as Haris plays a nervous poke first ball"
"and he strays in line, full on leg stump, strongly flicked away through square leg"
"back outside off stump, full, left alone"
"in-dipper, raps the pads as Azhar works across the line, England go up... but Reiffel isn't interested and Root elects not to review this one. Looked like it was slipping down"
"round the wicket to Haris, 85mph and shaping in as he turns to the leg side"
"length ball, this holds its line around off stump, solidly blocked"
"fuller, trying to drag him forwards, Haris lines it up"
"oof, beautiful shape on this, slicing its way across the batsman from over the wicket... but fractionally short of a length and Sohail is beaten but unbowed. A top delivery for the cameras"
"good length, blocked down to the off side"
"pitched up, nipping back and into the pads... Tucker shakes his head. Inside edge? Yes, some bat involved, probably outside off stump, too"
"another big appeal, this thuds straight into the knee roll of Azhar's front pad - but definitely outside the line"
"pitched up and yammering away at that front pad, Azhar gets his bat down solidly in defence this time"
"ooh, testing line, veering back in at 87mph - but short enough for the batsman to leave"
"length, slides this one down the leg side"
"in the channel, decent pace and carry but wide enough to leave"
"full, swinging into the pads, nice seam position but Haris deals with the movement and chops a single wide of mid-on"
touch short and straight and nudged off the hips
"length, begins to go across Haris but he gets his bat down in line to block"
"full, 85mph in the channel, slightly wide and he shoulders arms this time"
"slightly overpitched, 87mph and this gets him driving, not the cleanest connection but it's worth three past mid-off"
"full and straight, Azhar closes the face a little early and gets a low leading edge back past the bowler"
"dug in short by Broad, flies through above the ducking batsman"
"angled across in the channel, shaping away and left alone"
"more short stuff, again Haris gets down in his bunker"
"another running-down-the-pitch appeal from Broad, then there's nearly a run out chance into the covers... Root signals he thinks it's high? Looks like some bat involved, too"
"shortish, lets this one go in the corridor"
"full and a touch wide, Haris waves it through"
"short of a length outside off, 85mph to start off with and Azhar jumps into line"
"cranks it up to 89mph now, but fired down the leg side"
"fullish, played with soft hands into the off side and Root can't gather it cleanly as they take a sharp single"
"over the wicket, length ball, 88mph and straightening around off, Haris defends from the crease"

"back of a length, 85mph over the stumps, prodded towards mid-on from the crease"
"pitched up, good heat on the pill, 89mph as Azhar comes across to block on off"

"on the stumps, touching 90mph again, turned down to the leg side"
"short, whirring through outside off as Azhar drops to his knee"
"length, racing stripes in the channel outside off, watched well and left alone"
"ooh, nearly sucks him in, short and fast, 89mph outside off stump and Azhar is drawn to it but manages to <i>just</i> keep the bat inside the line"
"fired across the left-hander, Haris dabs one through backward point"
"round the wicket, angled in and then straightening, no stroke offered"
"tight line, hits the seam and nips away, so close to suckering him on the drive... but no bat on it"
"back of a length, this swerves in and clips the thigh pad, runs away to the rope at fine leg for extras"
"full and nipping away, but quite wide and Haris can ignore it"
"length outside off, 84mph but again he leaves it be"
"back of a length, 88mph outside but not much in the way of lateral movement, defended from the crease"
"fuller, a touch wide and this shapes away slightly, but Azhar doesn't need to follow it"
"shortish in the channel, nothing doing from the batsman"
"tailing back in, 88mph but still Azhar isn't forced to play"
"pitched up at 89mph, a foot or two outside off, left alone"
"banging away in the corridor, making a racket with the pots and pans - but Azhar just stays in his room and ignores it all, playing out a maiden"
"round the wicket, nice curve back in at Haris, who gets an inside edge on to his pads"
"full and sliding leg side, flicked wide of the man in the deep for a couple"
"nicely bowled, good length and juicy enough to get him reaching for it, seams past the outside edge"
"fullish, this is tapped away in defence"
"straightening again from round the wicket, skips away for one off a leading edge"
"touch short, 82mph and worked for a single through square leg"
"back of a length, dropped down into the off side"
"angled in, Azhar jumps across and defends"
"fuller, 86mph and shaping away a fraction, no stroke"
"some inswing for Wood now, Azhar has to play forward and takes a blow on the gloves"
"this is better from Wood, he jumps wide in his deilvery stride and gets the ball to straighten <i>just</i> enough, beats the outside edge"
"slams in a bumper now, Azhar stays deep and ducks it"
"short of a length from round the wicket, clipped off the hip for one"
"over the wicket to the right-hander, pitched up wide of the stumps, Azhar stays on his rock"

"pitched up, this swings in a touch as Haris gets forward and drives to mid-off"

"it's a bluff, the ball pitched up, Azhar stabs it away into the off side for one"
"round the wicket to Haris, snaking into the back pad and Wood belts out an appeal... Reiffel turns this one down, height probably the issue. Beat him for pace, I think"
"<b>dropped!</b> Turned around by a seaming delivery, but <b>Stokes grasses it going one-handed from third slip</b>... when the ball was travelling straight into the breadbasket of Malan at second! Stokes grimaces, England miss their chance"

"touch back of a length around off stump, Azhar blocks from the crease"
"pitched up, this one bobbles through"
"full, pushing the pace up to 88mph, driven to cover"

"short of a length in the channel but coming back in, defended down to the off side"
"round the wicket from Wood, into the pads and worked for a single"
"now the chin music kicks in, sub-woofer thrumming, 88mph, the ball rears and hits glove/bat handle as Azhar fends at it... manages to keep the ball down with the catcher lurking"

"touch short, defended on off stump"

"round the wicket, pushed through with plenty of energy and it's on target straight away, Haris blocks resolutely"
"floated up full, tapped into the covers coming forwards"
"quick offbreak, there's some drift in as Haris goers back to cut and gets a bottom edge into the turf"
tossed up and punched into the covers
"full, gives it some air, Haris crunches a drive this time, straight to the man at cover"
"drags this down a touch and Haris slams four past cover point, firm connection and it runs up the slope to the boundary - <b>bringing up the Pakistan 50 in the process</b>"
"back of a length, towards the ribs but Azhar rides it and defends to the on side"
lets this one go outside off
"length, gets Azhar pushing a little hesitantly, squeezed towards gully on the bounce"
"keeps plugging away in the channel, nothing doing from the batsman"
"short and at the body, Azhar lets it hit on on the hip and runs away"
"dug in, 86mph and rising over off stump, Azhar lines it up well and drops it safely down on to the crease - and that is <b>stumps</b>, the end of an excellent day for Pakistan"
"outside off, a decent sighter, a touch too wide to lure a stroke"
"full length, tailing into the left-hander's toes, compactly drilled to cover"
"round the wicket, and Sohail is beaten on a loose, flat-footed drive. A driveable length, but he needs to be careful"
"full once more, straighter line, and solidly blocked into the leg-side"
"Broad seems half a yard fuller this morning, this one is squeezed a little awkwardly behind square, but into the gap for the two runs"
"angled defence, down through third man, good soft hands keeping the ball down all the way"
"outside off, shaping down the hill and left alone with no alarms"
"stands tall on the back foot, blocked to the leg side"
"fenced off the back foot, into the covers, a bit of shape for Jimmy but nothing dramatic just yet"
left alone with gloves raised high
"tighter line outside off, angling in, no stroke offered"
"through to the keeper, beats the bat in theory, but in practice it was too short to challenge the edge. Plenty time to stay inside the line"
"dragged forward on the off stump, that's a good aggressive length, forcing Azhar to play"
"outside off, zipping off the seam and left alone. Bairstow wears that one a touch awkwardly on his fingertips."
dabbed to the leg side
inside-edged onto the back thigh. Azhar yelps
compactly stabbed into the gap in the covers
"angling in on the back foot, left alone. Broad looks threatening this morning"
"round the wicket, into the hip, and clipped sweetly up the hill to the Grandstand rope. Well timed"
"outside off, better line from Anderson, nothing doing there"
"wider line, fuller length, left alone"
"onto the front foot, and pushed into the covers"

"wider line from round the wicket, met with a compact push into the covers, a pleasingly full face of the bat in that shot"
"outside off, left alone"
"outside off, no stroke this time. Good pace still from Broad"
drawn onto the front foot to block
angling towards the cordon and left well alone
"good delivery, nipping back off the seam and passing uncomfortably close to the top of off. Well left in the end though"
"angled bat, pressing the off-stump delivery out to cover"
"over-pitched for a change from Anderson, a bit powder-puff from round the wicket, and eased with confidence into the gap in the covers. Tidy batting"
"<strong>over-pitched again! </strong> Anderson once again finds no swing to accompany his fuller length, and that's another thumping stroke, straighter back past the bowler"
"<strong>get some of that!</strong> Anderson is fed up of being driven, hauls his length back, and thumps Haris in the ribs. Grr!"
"<B>much better!</B> That was full but more threatening, jagging off the seam from over the wicket this time. Haris hauls his bat inside the line"
"back of a length, defended with intent on the back foot"
"<B>the best of the lot</B>. Anderson finds an awkward mid-length on a very tight line, with a bit of nip off the seam for good measure. Arguably too short to find the edge, but Haris had to be on his mettle to stay inside the line"
"<B>sweetly driven!</B> Azhar is starting to enjoy himself now, climbing into rare width on a full length from Broad, and flogging it through the covers"
nudged off the pads as Broad strays in line. Out to deep square leg
"angled in to the right-hander, blocked by Azhar, right up on his toes"
<B>beaten outside off stump</B>. Good lift off the seam but past the edge
"very full length, no stroke offered"
"<B>beats everything!</B> Jags off the seam from a very full length, wobbles past the edge and clangs into Bairstow's already sore fingertips. That is the threat that Broad can pose when he pitches it up. He is definitely the likelier lad this morning"
"full length but on the pads, clipped behind square"
"<B>well bowled!</B> Root seems to think there was a nick on that,  but it just seemed to seam round the edge of the bat and through to the keeper. Good aggressive length though!"
"up on the toes, as Wood hauls his length back. Blocked down into the crease"
worked to the leg side
"<B>drilled through the covers!</B> That is perfection from Azhar, waiting to pounce onto the front foot as soon as the ball is in his slot, and pierces the gap"
"outside off, no stroke offered"
"round the wicket, back of a length, passes through to the keeper"
"outside off once more, no stroke offered"
"round the wicket, full length, but a lack of jag in this delivery, angled defence down through third man, and a well-judged chase and slide from Dom Bess to cut off the four"
"speared down the leg side, no bat on that one"
"fuller and straighter, but Azhar is equal to that one, turning it around the front pad and out to the leg side"
"wider line, no shot needed or offered"
"round the wicket, thudding through to the keeper"
"no stroke offered once more, a decent line and pace from Wood but not threatening consistently just yet"
"banged in short, and through to the keeper"
"wider line, no stroke there"
tapped into the covers for another single
"full length from over the wicket, punched to mid-off"
"banged in short from round the wicket, and Haris rides the bounce to tap it into the off side"
"left alone, through to the keeper"
"tighter line, fuller length, but that's an excellent leave. Precisely the sort that less well-set visiting batsmen tend to nick to slip. But Pakistan are well versed in these conditions after a month of preparation now.."

"wide line, full length, no stroke"
"round the wicket, solid defence on off stump"
"atttractively driven, but straight to the man at cover"

"round the wicket, stabbed into the covers off the back foot"
"sliding down the leg side, back of a length"
"banged in short from round the wicket, England trying to mix it up with a bit of bodyline, but Azhar is equal to that one"
"round the wicket, sharp pace on a good length. Left alone"
"nip off the seam, but from a wide line. Haris leaves alone as the ball passes his off stump"
"<B>big nip!</B> Jagging down the Lord's slope and crashes into the pads. Doing too much, but encouraging signs for Stokes"
solidly blocked on the back foot as this one holds its line
"full length, wide line, no stroke"
"leaning onto the front foot, defended to the leg side"
"short and leg-sided, a definite ploy with the leg slip still in place. But Azhar keeps his gloves out of harm's way as the ball flashes past his ribs"
short again and swinging past the limboing right-hander
"up on the toes, and pierces the covers once more with a measured push. Positively serene at the moment from Pakistan"
"<B>inside-edge from a fuller length?</B> Very much so, and flicks the hip as well to take it clear of leg slip. Safe in the end but a half-opening"
"short, and ducked"
"<B>edged and gone!</B> There it goes, Wood earns his reward for just mixing things up a bit. Banged it in at first to force Haris into his shell, then snagged his edge with the fuller swinging length. A fine innings, good bowling too, and that will be <B>drinks</B> to end another absorbing hour..."
"Stokes trundles away in the corridor, left alone"
"length ball, Azhar gets into line and plays no shot"
"good length, straightening a touch with the slope from the Nursery End, 86mph but again left"
"drops short and Azhar pounces, just a checked-jab through point but that rattles away to take him into the 40s"
"fuller, angling in towards the stumps, on to the front foot and pushed with half a bat to midwicket"
"pitched up, 87mph and tailing back in from outside off, not tight enough to make Azhar play. He's got his Lord's geometry spot on so far in this innings"
"full, 89mph in the channel, a touch wide and he can watch it through"
"length ball, again a foot or two outside off, no stroke"
"slightly shorter, climbing through to the keeper at 86mph, again he doesn't need to play"
"dropped into the covers, nicely played as he rides the bounces and dabs one to get off the mark"
"bangs in the short stuff, aiming towards the ribs, dealt with well as he forces it away round the corner"
"oh, Asad... <b>nearly runs out his partner!</b> It needed a direct hit aiming at one stump, with Bess haring up from gully, but Azhar would have been short of his ground! Instead, it's one in the book to Shafiq"
"fullish in the channel, holding its line and left alone"
"shorter, tucked off the body towards square leg"
"opens the face, that'll be four, drawn outside off but Shafiq played it well and steered the ball through gully for his first boundary"
"woof, that's jumped, off a length but fizzing through into the gloves as Shafiq thought about pushing at it"
"nicely played again, gets on to the front foot and sends a push racing away down the incline towards the Mound Stand"
"shaping in, 85mph but not close enough to the woodwork to tempt Azhar"
"banged in short from round the wicket, Shafiq bobs out of the way"
"at the body, 87mph and fended behind short leg, Root goes scurrying after it"
"staying round the wicket, slung full outside off and Azhar snaps on a punched drive, Buttler at short extra cover dives to scoop it up"
"back of a length at the body again, tucked to leg, straight into Root's breadbasket on the bounce"

"full length, driven without timing through mid-off for a couple"
"short and wide, rank stuff from Stokes and Azhar tucks in his napkin and helps himself, cut through point with alacrity for four"
"back of a length at the body now, again he's equal to that, worked away for one to leg"
"full and wide of the stumps, left alone"
"that's a better line, just doing enough to weech its way past the outside edge as Shafiq fiddles outside off"
sliding down the leg side as he comes across
"another good ball to finish, hitting the seam and wobbling through past the bat, Shafiq in two minds and nearly caught betwixt them again"
"over the wicket, pushed through flattish on off stump, Azhar defends"
"ooh, he's got in a tangle here, trying to come down the pitch but Bess shortens his length and a leading edge squirts back towards the bowler"
tossed up on the stumps and defended
"where's that gone?! <b>Goes for a premeditated sweep and sends a top edge wide of slip...</b> but Stokes had already tried to run around to the leg side and is in no position to go for the chance! Looked catchable, from where he was originally standing"
pushed through on the stumps and nurdled past short leg to get off strike
"flighted, around off stump, Shafiq presses out and dinks one through point"
"flung down in the corridor outside off, Shafiq continues to watch them well"
"touch shorter, comes across to block"
"pitched up, Shafiq clamps down on it coming forwards"
full in the channel and met with a firm clump towards cover
full but sliding down the leg side and Shafiq just needs a tickle on it to send the ball racing to fine leg
"pitched up around off stump, blocked on the front foot"
"Bess tosses this up outside off, not much turn and defended pressing forwards"
"pushed through on off, Azhar defends"
"on the stumps, goes back and shows it a straight bat"
"flighted, outside off and Azhar drops back, plays the ball softly through backward point - <b>there's the half-century, a fine knock in tough conditions from Azhar</b>. Can he go on and get himself inscribed on the honours board?"
"oh dear, <b>that's a misbegotten charge down the track!</b> Shafiq tries to heave Bess over long-on but only succeeds in getting a thick inside-edge past short leg for a single"
flatter and quicker to finish the over and Ahzar defends
"some shape straight away, pitched up and straightening to hit the leading edge as Shafiq closes the face"
fullish and pushed into the covers coming across
"full, swinging late and again Shafiq gets into trouble working across the line... but the edge lands safely in front of point"
angled in and tapped to the leg side
"Anderson fires one in, <b>smacking into the front pad</b> - and given! Azhar lingers, thinks about the review... then turns on his heel. The switch does the trick for Anderson, bringing the ball back up the slope and into the knee roll. Hawk-Eye had it clipping the top of middle, so it wouldn't have been overturned. <i>Huge</i> wicket for England"
"another inswinger first up, 84mph, Babar leans out and defends around his pads"
"flighted, around off stump, Shafiq settles on a forward defensive"
comes forward and dinks a single through mid-on
"pushed through, some shouts of excitement as Babar defends"

"this pops up off a length, Shafiq does well to keep it down"
"now Anderson goes the other way, like Austin Powers, past the outside edge as Shafiq gets suckered into playing"
floated up and defended coming across
slightly short and Babar opens up the shoulders to slap his first runs away through point
"flat offbreak, not much turn and blocked on off stump"
"tossed up, this time he leans forward to smother the ball"
"good use of the feet again from Babar, dropping deep into the crease to make this delivery a short one, then glided past backward point for three, Wood giving good chase"
"flighted, tapped into the on side"
"length, rising up and holding its line as Babar stabs it towards point"
"angled in straighter and he dobs the ball down towards midwicket, tight single but they scuttle through"

"in the channel, 83mph and fading away a touch as he gets into line and leaves"
"tight lines, poked into a gap for one more"

"propping onto the front foot, and pushed to cover"
"<B>edged, but short of second slip!</B> Not quite to the pitch of the ball, but nor did he push too hard. Soft hands into the cordon"

"angled into the stumps, good probing line and length from Broad, on a very full length"
"fenced to the leg side, working around the front pad"
"<B>slashed and safe!</B> That's a rare terrible stroke from Shafiq, somehow lured into a wild unbalanced back foot whack, and Buttler actually ducks at third slip rather than go for the catch! Not sure he'd have reached it, but he was caught as unawares as the batsman"
"flipped off the pads, escapes the strike to ponder the error of his ways"
"outside off, no stroke offered"
"squared up on the back foot, a bit of nip off the seam, but no luck yet... the ball squirts out to cover off a leading edge"
"fuller length, easier leave on a wide line"
"pumped through the covers. England have been probing, but it's Pakistan making the running. That one sat up for the stroke"
"raps the pads, but sliding down"
"leaning onto the front foot, and worked into the covers. A tough run-out chance for Bess who gathers well and releases in mid-air, but the batsman was probably home either way"

banged in on a short but straight line. Defended
"full length, a hint of outswing, compactly driven into the covers, where they take on Stokes' arm. That's confidence for you!"
"<B>huge appeal!</B> England are convinced, there was a clear noise as Shafiq left alone.  But<B> it's the point of his elbow!</B> Cook actually said as much, and the fact that the batsman was rubbing his funny bone might have been a hint... but honestly... they've burned a <B>review</B>.

And Shafiq survives!"
"oh, fenced to slip, <b>gottim this time!</b> A much simpler chance, looping to Malan and he plucks it from the sky - no third life for Shafiq! Stokes is the partnership-breaker, a real throat ball, perhaps taking out his frustration after the drop"

"going away from middle and off, stabbed to backward point"

gets into line and blocks a short ball
"bouncer, <b>gloved down the leg side, taken!</b> Stokes digs out another, the short ball finally pays off against Shadab, but not before he's notched a valuable half-century. Good tumbling catch from Bairstow, on a tricky day behind the stumps"

"good follow-up, outside off, through to the keeper"
"<strong>another tremendous slog!</strong> Goes absolutely nowhere, but you've got to admire the intent. Root is the man cowering under the lid, perhaps Abbas senses a chance to take revenge for Babar's break!"

"watchfully dabbed into the covers, staying slightly leg-sided so there's a danger of being castled with that stance. But the only castling is Stoneman's shy from point, which flicks the stumps and gives away overthrows!"
"Mo has a mow, a helicopter-wipe of a pull shot to a steepling bouncer. No contact. Pakistan march on!"
"short and sharp, but that's well played, swaying inside the line and dropping the gloves low"
"<strong>another bouncer!</strong> Sharper and straighter this time, but again, pretty good evasive action, bat a little high on this occasion"

"sliding back and across, solidly into line on the back foot"
"angled into the pads, that's well picked off by Root, using the pace to turn it very fine, a tumble on the boundary's edge cuts off the four"
"through to the keeper, this is tidy work from Abbas, just plugging away on an off-stump line, and nipping it away on this occasion"
"through to the keeper, no stroke offered"

"short of a length outside off, driven square to point"
"a short delivery, Root gets over the top, rolls his wrists, and pulls to deep square"
"full at off stump, presses forward and pushes to the left of mid-on"

"back of a length at off stump, defended to the off side"

"pushes this one fuller outside off, left alone"
"back of a length outside off, Root opens the face and guides it towards gully"
"wide outside off, left alone"
gets forward and defends to backward point
"short outside off, Root shapes to play square through the off side...ball doesn't quite come off as expected and it takes the bottom of the bat"
"good length at off stump, defended on the front foot"
"big appeal for lbw...has it pitched in line, or is there an inside edge? <B>Sarfraz has reviewed</b>. Was just short of a length, so where it's pitched looks the issue. No bat. Yep, pitches well outside leg. Poor review"
"nicely bowled, pushed across on a good length outside off and think Stoneman played at this...yes, for certain, he was beaten"
"very full outside off, he gets a stride forward and drives through the covers...good work by Imam to chase it down and flick it back"
left alone outside off
"wide outside off, no need to play"
"short outside off, a square cut is well intercept by Imam at backward point"

"round the wicket, some sharp spin from outside off, turns past the inside edge into the front pad"

played off the back foot to the off side
"<b>that's kept low and taken off stump</b>. Stoneman camped on the back foot, the ball pitches in the rough outside off, spins back and he is nowhere. Off stump pegged back. Though that did keep low, so perhaps he's a touch unfortunate, Stoneman had to be forward"
"he gets right across his crease, can see all three stumps, and works this to the leg side. Dicey."
"good length outside off, left alone"
gets across to off stump and pushes to the covers
a bouncer which flies over Root's head

"banged in short, Malan ducks"
"full and straight, worked into the leg side with a flick around the front pad"
"onto the front foot, again, looking to get forward at every opportunity which is a good sign. Much as Cook achieved in the first innings"
"<B>battered on the helmet!</B> Wow, that is a <I>savage</I> delivery, clattering the lid like a cobra bite, not desperately short but leapt viciously, and dislodged the stem guard to boot. Malan receives a standing count from the physio. What a ball. Hasan had telegraphed his intentions with two men back on the hook, but he then served up an absolute peach"
back and across to defend in front of middle and off
"late cut, that's a very nicely played shot, just waiting for the ball to go past him before dabbing through third man"

"another short ball, but Malan reads this one early and ducks underneath"
"pushed right back onto the stumps, the lunge onto the front foot is noticeably absent as Malan defends"
"takes on the short ball this time, well played, staying tall at the crease and picking off the single to backward square"
clipped uppishly into the leg side
"driven on the up to point, <B>a brilliant sprawling stop from Imam, and Malan would have been gone for all money!</B> One stump to aim at, and he missed by an inch! Crikey"
"worked around the corner, out to the leg side"
stretching onto the front foot. Silly point and slip in attendance
worked to the leg side from back in the crease
"tossed up, and punched to mid-off with a straight full face of the bat"
"well played and placed, just a touch of width to accompany a slightly shorter length, and Root punches with an open face through third man, very late"

fully forward to defend
"another attempted back-cut, but this time backward point is on hand"
"hello ... in-dip on a full length, that's a handy start. Sliding down but the bend was self-evident"
"outside off, keeping low and Sarfraz does well to gather on the half-volley"
"very full length, bending into the stumps once more and Malan stays back in the crease to work it to midwicket"
"more leg-sided, and an easy clip off the toes, but Root's second run is a bit of a squeaky-bum moment! Another direct-hit, and that was out too!"
"through to the keeper, very tight line, tailing in towards the off stump"
"this one nibbles the other way, and Malan is lured into a loose flick outside off. Well bowled..."
"a bit of a rare long-hop, and slammed out to square leg. Not a lot of finesse in the shot. A bit like a labrador offered a plate of spaghetti"
"round the wicket, and on a fuller length, clipped to midwicket"
closing the face on impact to tuck another leg-stump ball to square leg
fenced off the hip to the leg side
"down on the sweep, <strong>a huge appeal for lbw</strong>, Malan sets off for an instinctive single, and has the ball <strong>shied the stumps with him out of his ground?</strong> No, Malan has dragged his foot back just in time! All going off out there!"
defended to the leg side... Pakistan are swarming!

worked into the covers

tucked off the legs
"big stride forward, blocking back down the pitch"
tossed up and driven with more freedom out to deep cover
"<B>and there's the fifty!</B> Well played skipper ... if ever there was a day to convert, it's this. Another trademark open-faced glide through third man. A productive stroke today"
forward and drilled to short cover
"banged in short, hoisted out to deep midwicket, a touch more freedom now that he's past fifty"

opens the face to slap out to point
"tossed up, low full toss in the end, clipped firmly into the leg side"

fully forward to defend... and that will be <B>drinks</B>
"full outside off, brings Malan reaching forward as he defends to point"
"<b>edged and taken!</b> Amir provides the breakthrough and it's an excellent catch. In the channel outside off, a touch of reverse away (I think), draws Malan forward and finds the edge. It had to be Sarfraz's catch, wouldn't have reached first slip, and he dived across to pouch it. Dropped a similar one in Ireland. Top work"
"full outside off, left alone"
"<b>through him!</b> Two in three balls. A ripper from Amir. On a good length, nips back past Bairstow's inside edge and clatters into off stump. You won't see much better from a left-arm quick. Bowling gold"
just gets a fraction too straight to Stokes first ball and it's whipped sweetly through square leg
"length ball, wide outside off, left alone. Phew, what an over"
whipped out to deep midwicket
"nicely played, Stokes is quickly out of the blocks, whips this from full outside off through midwicket"
"<B>oh my goodness, is this out?!</b> Would be a heck of a way to go. Stokes has crunched a cover drive into silly point, it as rebounded up and been claimed by short leg sprawling across the pitch. Soft signal is not out. Ah, well, it's clearly gone into the ground before smashing into the fielder's boot. As you were. To be fair, Stokes looked pretty calm throughout"

"on the pads, flicked out to deep square leg"
"full at off stump, defended on the front foot"
plays back and drives to deep cover
"<b>oh boy, another one bites the dust!</b> Stokes has just whipped this into the hands of midwicket. Went back to a shorter delivery, eyed up the leg side, but it was a rather half-hearted effort with no placement and neatly taken moving to his right by the sub fielder"

plays back and defends to mid-on
pushed into the off side

"full at the stumps, defended"
"<b>he's been given but has reviewed it!</b> Suspect more out of hope than expectation. Good length, nips back, takes him on the knee roll. There's no bat involved. Clipping at worse, you would think. Never mind that, it's smashing leg stump"

works a straight delivery behind square on the leg side
"good length at off stump, defended"

"another <b>big inswinger</b>, appeal for lbw as it smashes into Bess' back pad but it looks to be sliding down the leg side. Sarfraz ponders but decides not to review. Think he hit it as well"

"no stroke once more, too wide to tempt Buttler, though you have to say, temptation must be at the forefront of his mind after the IPL feeding frenzy"
"a fraction too short, and <strong>that's the Buttler power that we've come to recognise.</strong> A front-foot biff through square leg, the umpire sways and the fielder can't reach"
"opens the face and glides another boundary, up the hill to the cover boundary. That'll do"
"premeditated shuffle into line, I sense Beast Mode may be about to be flicked on. Well, why not really"
"<B>that's beautiful</B>, leaning forward, full face of the bat, leathered through the covers. Half an hour of this intent could get interesting"
"attempted leave, but in the end, a well-placed steer off the underside of the bat, through third man. He's off the mark"
