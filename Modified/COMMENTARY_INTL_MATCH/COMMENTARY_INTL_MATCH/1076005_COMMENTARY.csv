"runs straight away. Short of good length, not much turn outside off. Smith crunchily punches off the backfoot, past the extra cover fielder diving to his left"
"arm ball, comes in with the arm and pings him in front. Missing leg"
"drifting in with the arm again, extremely loopy. Clipped away to short fine leg"
"in-dipper, sees the angle coming in and shifts his weight towards the off side to open up the on side play. Shorter in length also and it is pulled to backward square leg"
"quicker ball, raps him on the pad. Seems like it was heading down leg"
gets a leading edge to the off side as the bat face closes early and they run a quick single as the ball goes to the covers region
"takes on the angle of the bowler. Slightly off with the line, loosener from Amir, short of good length and it is pulled away behind square"
much better angle. Angles it away but just enough to cramp him for room outside off. Short of a length again and Smith tries to crunch it through the off side with a half-angled bat but cannot make contact as the ball narrowly beats the edge
"short of a length, rises on the toes to ride the bounce before dropping it in front of the forward short leg region and takes off for the single as Amir gathers the ball"
"good length ball, thinks of turning it away into the leg side but he is forced to play the line and he defends it back to the bowler"
"short of good length outside off, not much movement, stands in the crease and punches it to mid-off"
"back of a length, stays in the crease and works it with the angle to mid-on, wide of the fielder there for a quick single"
"width on offer outside off. Fullish length, not much movement outside off and Duckett crunches it square of the wicket where point makes a diving save"
"fullish on the stumps, pushes it to mid-on for a quick single"
"length ball, angling in on middle, effort ball from Sohail and it is defended off the outer half of the blade to the covers region"
gets it to straighten from the short of a length region. It was angling in. Smith tries to work it with the angle into the leg side and gets a leading edge that flies through the third man region
"angled in outside off, tucked away off the hips to fine leg for a brace"
"short ball, backs away to make room and tries to go big over the in-field. But the bounce is too steep and he makes no contact as the ball sails comfortably over willow and settles into the keeper's gloves"
"good length ball, gets it to angle in from outside off and it is punched firmly to mid-off"
"slightly short of a length, tries to pull it away but it does not come at the pace he would have liked. Does not sit up as much either and he struggles with the timing as he ends up dragging it towards mid-on on the bounce"
"ooh, that one cut back in sharply, seems like it was off the seam. Duckett gets a healthy inside edge and the ball beats the keeper on the way to the fine leg boundary"
"slower full ball outside off, driven off the front foot to the covers region"
"good length, pitching outside leg, whips it away off the pads to the midwicket region"
"good length, angling in on off, uses the angle to push it gently from the crease towards mid-on for a quick single"
"full and wide, holding its line a more than set of stumps outside off and Duckett stays leg side of it. He backed away in fact to give himself room before lifting it over extra cover"
"this time the length is slightly back, on a length and outside off again. The angle is the same and Duckett punches it crisply off the backfoot through the covers"
"and just when it seemed like he was getting some momentum going, he has picked out mid-on. And it is Pollard, he does not drop those. Fullish and Duckett was looking to clip it away. Fails to keep it along the ground, sends it to the right of Pollard who dives and snaffles it. It was the back-of-the-hand legcutter, actually, so the lack of pace probably meant he could not keep it down"
drops it in front of point with soft hands and calls immediately for a single. Non-striker responds well and makes the crease even as the point fielder's throw at the keeper's end misses the stumps
"fullish length ball, it's the other variation - the offcutter - this time which is nudged away to backward square leg"
"back of a length and angling away outside off, opens the bat face to run it down to third man"
turns it away into the leg side towards the midwicket region and the bowler runs across to field it
"good length on off, punched straight to cover"
works it down to mid-on who is slightly deep for a single
"pushed across to the left-hander and gives some width outside off, works it square of the wicket but cannot beat point"
opens the bat face but cannot pierce the gap between short third man and backward point
"fuller, shuffles across and clips it off the pads through midwicket"
"good length ball, spinning slightly in from middle and off and turned away behind square with the turn"
stays back to this length ball and waits for it before drilling it down to long-on
back of a length and the batsman moves across towards off early before paddling it to short fine leg where Gayle dives and pushes it further away as he does so
tossed up on off and tries for a reverse sweep. Inside-edged to the pads
"length ball, tucked off the hips to square leg. There is a fielder at deep backward square leg and he is able to pick it up"
"good length and spinning away ever-so-slightly, waits before cutting it out to sweeper cover"
"fired down the leg side, tries to flick but wears it on the thigh guard"
"sharp drift on that one, taking it away from the batsman and giving him room outside off, slapped away to sweeper cover"
too short. The batsman came down the track and Wasim dragged the length back. But he overcompensates and the batsman is able to slap it away to sweeper cover
"pitched up ball outside off, drilled down to long-off"
"short of good length. There is no turn at all, so bowling at that length is not helping. Smith rocks back and picks the gap through deep midwicket as he lays into a pull shot"
"there was never a run there, it seemed like. Very good fielding sees the back of Talat. It was pushed wide of the bowler, to covers, and Smith called for the run. The bowler runs to his left and throws it to Sangakkara who does the rest"
"short of good length, whipped off the backfoot to the leg side"
gives it too much air and bowls a full toss that is driven back to the bowler
"given a lot of air again and it is too full outside off, drilled through covers"
"fuller length and pitching on leg and spinning away, pushes it off the front foot to the off side, drops it to the covers region for a quick single"
tries to back away and force a cut but gets cramped for room and is beaten
comes forward and drives gently and away from the body to mid-off
"off-cutter, short of good length and angling in, defended to the off side. Some intent has to be shown at some point now, surely"
"there's the first signs of aggression. Shorter ball and Watson was looking to pull it. But it is a back-of-the-hand legcutter, although it spins like an off-break and comes into Watson cramping him for room. Misses"
you could see this coming. There had to be some sense of urgency shown halfway through the 10th over. And it has fetched a wicket for Islamabad. Short of a length ball but there is no pace on it. Slower again and all Watson can do on the pull is drag it down to long-on and straight into the hands on Kieron Pollard
"short of good length and cutting back in sharply around the leg stump channel, tries to get the front leg out of the way and work it away fine but ends up wearing it on the pad"
"slower ball and this one's fired wide outside off as well, making Haddin reach out for it. Haddin gets an under edge and the ball goes on the bounce to the keeper"
"no pace but lot of power. Full and just outside off. Smith clears the front leg and absolutely hammers it over the bowler's head. Flat-batted thump, sends the bowler scampering for cover"
fires it down the leg side as the drift takes it too long down leg
short of a length and width on offer outside off. Cut to backward point and he pushes for the second. Sangakkara collects the throw and flicks it to the stumps but he has ground the bat and makes it back safe
pitched right up and in the slot for Haddin. Not much turn and Haddin is able to get right on top of that  Gets the front leg out of the way to give himself room to free his arms and launches it over long-on
tries to do the same over the off side this time as he launches it but does not get hold of it. The ball lands just away from the extra cver fielder running back
"too full on off, pushes it down to long-on"
Smith shows Haddin how it's done. Right on top of it and it is almost an effortless shot. Pitched up outside off and just about enough room outside off. Smith launches it over long-off with exquisite timing
"flat and short, drifting down leg, Smith tries to pull it fine but cannot beat short fine leg. Got away with that one did the bowler"
"opens the face of his bat to run it down to third man but cannot get it square enough, perhaps because of the lack of room, and the ball goes on the bouncer to the wicketkeeper"
tries to slog it hard and misses it. There was a slight noise and it seemed like there was an inside edge. The ball misses the stumps and Sangakkara as well. No edge as it's given a bye
"dippind full toss, angling in on leg, whipped away to midwicket and they push back for the second, almost bumped into each other but the throw is not sharp enough and they complete the second"
"fuller ball, struck firmly back to the bowler and seems like he has been hit on the left hand. That's his bowling arm and the ball has bounced off the wrist before going to covers. That was hit extremely hard. Must sting. It hit him on the back or side of his palm, seems like"
"fuller and angling in, Smith is trying to slog it big and gets an inside edge that goes along the ground to the fine leg region"
"slower ball full toss, dipping on Haddin. Pushes it through covers and sweeper runs to his right and collects it. Good running as they come back for the second"
"short and wide outside off, slashes at it and makes no contact"
"full toss, angling away. Smith looks to force it through the off side and the ball goes off the outside edge to the third man region. Lucky boundary, but he'll take that"
"short ball, tries to pull but mistimes it to short midwicket as he is beaten by pace and the ball also got big on him. lazy running from Smith as Amir runs across and fires a throw and Smith was not dragging his bat. Direct hit would have seen the back of him"
front leg out of the way to this length ball and shovels it down to long-on as the ball goes on the bounce to the fielder
"fuller outside off, squeezes it out straight down the ground and they jog the single"
shuffles across initially before backing away to this fuller ball that is drilled to long-off
"Haddin has picked out Kieron Pollard. Haddin was looking to launch this fuller ball over long-on, just that it was wide outside off which meant he had to fetch it and drag it from all the way there. And the cow corner is a long boundary. Pollard runs to his right to snaffle it"
"there's no stopping Pollard. Tell you what, it was not as easy as he made it seem. Smith tries to do what Haddin did earlier and it seems like this is a clean shot. The ball was full again but unlike the previous one, it is coming into Smith, so you would think he has made better connection. Well, he has. Just not high enough for Pollard to watch it sail as he runs to his right and simply sticks his right hand out to pluck it out of nowhere, just like that"
"fuller ball, drilled through the off side to the deep. And the bowler has overstepped. what a time to do it, off a hat-trick ball!"
"fuller ball, drills it straight down the ground and long-off, running to his right, gets down in time to stop the ball in front of the boundary as he pushes it back"
"slower ball, on middle and off. Misbah shifts back to use the depth of the crease and slog sweeps it over deep square leg. Clean strike"
"yorker, angling in, tries to dig it out to the off side and inside-edges it to the pad"
goes for the yorker again and bowls a full toss that is pushed down to long-on
"good bowling. Yorker outside off, squeezed out into the off side and they run a single as Amir runs forward and picks it up on the follow-through"
"fuller on leg and middle, gets away to make room before drilling it straight down the ground. splits the gap between long-on and long-off and they scamper back for the second"
"tries to vary the length and it goes horribly wrong. Slower bouncer, sitting up nicely at shoulder height and it is pulled with authority over deep square leg"
"oh, what a shot! Great improvisation, but unfortunately for him, he has holed out to fine leg. Moves away towards off and uses the pace on the delivery as he tried to scoop it. Malik runs in and pouches it"
"fuller ball, hits it too straight and hits the stumps, deflects off the sticks to the off side and they come back for the second"
moves towards off again and shifts back deep into the crease. Full ball and Misbah whips it away but keeps it in the air and it goes straight into the hands of Gayle's bucket-sized hands at square leg. Barely had to move a muscle to take that one
"full and wide to start, Azam tries to lay into a square drive but misses."
"ah shot! Overpitched from Irfan, Azam stays in his crease and drills a delectable drive through cover. Sublime timing"
"the length is slightly shorter outside off, Azam leans into a drive and finds cover"
"there is the length that Irfan is known for. A back of a length on middle and leg, Azam gets underneath. Too high, a wide called"
"a swat through midwicket. Back of a length outside off, Azam stays tall, watches the ball onto his bat and then clatters a pull"
nicely played. Gets a good length delivery and Azam allows the ball to come onto him before dabbing one to third man
"edged for four. A full length from Irfan, Gayle gets half forward, rather tentative. Gets a thick outside edge which dies down, between slip and the keeper"
"a length delivery outside off, Azam chops one back towards the keeper. Was looking to guide it to third man"
"full and straight from Sami, Azam falls over a flick and is rapped on the pads. A big appeal is shot down. Sliding down"
"<strong>dropped!</strong> Duckett drops a dolly. A length delivery outside off, Azam stays in his crease and chips a catch to cover, or what was supposed to be a catch. Duckett gets both his hands up but somehow lets it go through"
"and that will be four. Back of a length on off, Azam pulls down to fine leg, past short fine leg"
worked away wristily past midwicket for a run
left alone outside off
"short of a length and outside off, punched gloriously off the backfoot but brilliant stop by Shadab Khan at point who flings himself to his left"
"tries to flick this one into the leg side. Length ball, misses and gets hit on the pad. But appeal turned down as it pitched outside leg"
"good length, angling away to the right-hander from leg and middle, tucked away to the leg side for an easy single"
tries to harry him with short ball but it is heading down the leg side and goes over the front shoulder as the big man ducks under
stays back to this length ball and inside edges it to the short fine leg fielder. Got a glove actually
"short of good length, gets slightly big on him and he chops the punch to covers"
"length ball outside off, tries to get the front foot out of the way and flay it over the off side but does not get hold of it and the ball goes on the bounce to the fielder at mid-off"
"fuller ball on the pads, clipped off the toes to midwicket and they jog the single"
comes down the pitch and looks to shovel this with a half-angled bat but it was an in between length and it goes to the right of the bowler on the bouncer as he does not get hold of the shot
"that was down the leg side, would have been called a wide if he had mot made contact. Tries to whip it away and inside-edges it to the pad before the ball rolls away towards square leg"
"dipping yorker length ball, almost a yorker and Gayle squirts it off the inside edge behind square as the ball goes to fine leg. It was the back-of-the-hand slower one and Gayle did not pick the drop in pace"
"good length on middle stump line, tucked off the pads to deep midwicket"
turns it into the leg side from outside off and they jog the single as the ball goes to midwicket
comes down the track but this one dips outside off and Gayle gets an under edge to the keeper that goes on the bounce
there's the first one from Gayle. Full and in the slot. Just swings his bat and launches it over long-on after fetching from just outside off. Did not try to hit it hard at all
this one's hit with a lot more power and authority. Flat and into the stands as Gayle lays into a pull shot against this short ball that sits up nicely at waist length
"full toss, angling in, closes the face of his bat early and skews it off the leading edge to mid-off where the ball drops just short of the fielder there. Just short, though"
"tries to launch this one straight down the ground but all he can do is chip it over the region between mid-off and extra cover. The ball drops in no man's land, just eluded two fielders"
"fuller ball, nearly a yorker and Gayle has drilled it straight down the ground. Sami runs to his right from long-on, slides across and pulls it back just in front of the boundary. They go upstairs to check if he has done fine there. Touch and go and given a four. His foot was in contact with the rope as he pulled it back"
turned away to square leg
that's the best of the lot. Hit with an air of authority. He actually wanted to thump this one and does it really well after stepping down the track and getting to the pitch of it. Over long-on and into the stands
"fuller and outside off, as big as the last one if not bigger. Drags a slog sweep from outside off and such is the power of the man. Sails well into the stands"
"just how much power does he have in those wrists? Advances down the track, gets to the pitch, flick of the wrists and over and above deep square leg"
"shorter ball, tried to pull but it was flat and quick and wears it on the pad. Hit outside leg"
highly entertaining over comes to an end with Gayle perishing. Ajmal has the last laugh but what a start. Gayle showing the first glimpses this PSL of what he's capable of. Comes down the track and tries to heave it over the leg side. But the width outside off means he has to fetch it and he does not do a good job of it. Skews it off the leading edge to Irfan at short third man
"drifting in with the arm on leg, tucked off the pads to short fine leg"
defended back to the bowler off the backfoot
tries to cut but not enough room and it goes off the edge of the blade to backward point
"tries to flick it but the turn is too sharp and takes it down the leg side and Sangakkara misses the flick, so does the keeper"
"short and wide, rocks back and cuts to sweeper cover"
"fat and quick, tries to pull but hits him on the hip as he gets cramped for room and fails to make contact"
off the mark with a push down to long-off against this fuller ball
floated up outside off and beautifully carved through extra cover. Turns away from Sangakkara just enough to give him room and he lofts it over the region and the ball beats the two fielders converging on it
"fuller outside off, driven through covers"
"short ball, rocks back and pulls. Man at deep midwicket, and he will cut it off"
lucky boundary. Ajmal tosses it up and fires it wide outside off. Sangakkara flashes his blade and tries to crunch it through the off side but gets an inside edge that goes through the keeper's legs and beats Irfan at third man who runs after it
driven back to the bowler
"flat and short of a length, stays in the crease and knocks it back to the bowler"
swings across the line with a flat bat but that is the googly and spins the other way to beat the bat
gives it too much air and bowls a full toss that is driven past the bowler diving to his left and goes to wide long-off
"fails to clear long-on. It was pitched up and angled away outside off. Sangakkara tries to launch it but it goes flat and hard straight into the hands of the fielder stationed there. Sangakkara is furious with himself, whips the air with his blade as he walks off. Credit to the bowler for enticing the shot by floating it up"
"flat and short of good length, wrong'un outside off, punched to mid-on"
short of good length and whipped away to long leg
"tries to entice the drive by floating it up and the batsman comes forward and obliges. Goes inside-out and just about gets it over the outstretched hands of the fielder at extra cover. The bowler did well but the batsman was equal to the task, managed to find enough elevation on the lofted drive"
"short of good length, bowled with a scrambled seam, punched to covers"
"full and outside off, exquisite timing as he drives through coves after pressing forward. Deep point runs across and fields it"
"short of a length, outside off, opens the face of his bat but cannot beat backward point"
"short ball, comes at around the grill, but not much pace. Malik does well to control the pull shot to deep square leg"
"short of a length outside off, change of pace, shuffles across to protect off before turning it away to midwicket"
comes down the track and Watson drops it short. Malik does the late adjustment well and opens the face of his bat to steer it to third man
comes down the track and drills this very full ball back to the bowler
advances down the track and again gets too close to it as he drives it into the off side to the extra cover region
slashes hard at this wide ball and gets an inside edge that goes through the keeper's legs. That one gripped and turned a mile outside off
comes down the track and the bowler drags the length back and Malik is forced to knock it back to the bowler
can't understand the hurry. Malik stays in the crease this time and looks to slog it. But it is well outside off and he gets a top edge. Haddin settles under it
nails a perfect googly that sees the back of Azam. That is the ball of the night and could be a candidate for the ball of the tournament. Azam plays down the wrong line as he expects it to turn like a traditional legbreak would do. It was on a length and spins it to breach  his defence take out his stumps
sees it going down leg and leaves it
"short of good length ball, opens the bat face and runs it down to third man"
"fuller ball, pushes it off the pads, mid-on runs to his left and dives but the ball gets away from underneath him"
"short of good length ball, plays a half-tuck half-pull as the ball goes through square leg"
"good length outside off, drops it in front of covers and sets off for a single but is sent back"
"short ball, some room outside off and sitting up nicely for Bopara. That must break the shackles, eases some of the pressure that was building up. Bopara lays into a pull shot as the ball goes through midwicket. Poor ball"
"length ball, angling in, nudged to midwicket"
"short of a length, raps him high on the pad as it kicks up extra and the ball goes away towards short third man after hitting him around the midriff"
"closes the bat face early, slower ball and he has missed it as the ball goes off the pad behind the stumps to short third. Height was an issue there"
"back of a length on middle and off, steered to point. Tries to pinch a single and is sent back by Pollard"
"fuller, driven back to the bowler"
sprays it full and down the leg side
"short of a length, does not bounce much, pulls along the carpet to deep backward square leg"
"short ball, this one gets very big on him and he pulls it along the ground to deep backward square leg, didn't try to hit it too hard. Just five more needed for Karachi qualify"
tries to back away and pull this short ball but the ball follows him and he drags it down to long-on. They call for two and Bopara responds favourably
and there's the shot that <b>seals Karachi's qualification</b>. Pollard backs away and tries to slog it but the angle takes it away from him and he skews it off the outside edge to third man. Punches the air in delight
backs away to pull this short ball but it follows him as it is angled in and he gets cramped for room and is beaten
"tries to move towards off and scoop it, does not get hold of it and the ball goes wide of the keeper"
tries a reverse scoop to this full and wide ball outside off and makes a mess of it as plays all over it and misses it
"just over the outstretched hands of the extra cover fielder. Full and outside off, just enough room to crash it through that region"
"slower full ball, tries to back away and heave it over the leg side but misses and the ball misses the leg stump on its way to the keeper"
"fuller ball, driven hard to long-on and they push back for the second. Raees fails to collect the throw. Sami fumbles but recovers and fires a good throw. Had the bowler collected it and taken out the stumps, he could have been gone"
"fullish ball, drilled hard through the leg side. Long-on and deep midwicket run across and the latter picks it up to cut it off in front of the boundary"
"very full ball on the pads, comes forward and manipulates the field nicely by picking the gap wide of long-on fo a comfortable brace"
"and Pollard, like last evening, seals it with a boundary. Short ball and Pollard swivels around with a pull that goes through midwicket. Short midwicket was in place but no chance of getting that"
