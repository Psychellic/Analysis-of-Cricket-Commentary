"<b>run out chance missed at the bowler's end!</b>. Length ball on off, Rohit pushed it to short mid-off. Extra cover sprinted in and under-armed a throw, and Rohit had initially taken a few steps down. Rahul responded but was sent back. Had to dive. Would have been out with a direct hit"
"left alone, well clear of off slanting across him"
"angling across him, left alone"
"hint of shape into him, on the stumps on a length, Rohit gets behind it and defends solidly"
"sticking in the pitch a bit, is the ball. On a length again, Rohit wants to punch on the up, but doesn't get the timing right and it trickles to mid-off. <b>Maiden over</b>"

"extravagant movement while angling it across, ends up well wide of off."
"<b>out comes the Cottrell salute</b>. Back of a length on leg stump, tucks Rahul up a bit. He was looking to flick it, but is a mite early into the shot, and the ball takes the leading edge to lob straight up and settle into Hetmyer's hands at short mid-on."
"good length and tight line on the fourth stump, he lets it go"
"fuller nibbling around off stump, pushed off the front foot towards mid-off"
"imperiously driven to long-off to get off the mark. Too full and on a driving length, he just leans into it"
"<b>castled him!</b> What a huge moment in the match this. Cottrell has two in the over, but the second one is Kohli. Rolled his fingers over it, back of a length outside off, Kohli was looking to open the face and run it down, but it takes the inside edge and clatters into stumps."

"low full toss, was probably an attempted yorker, flicked to square leg"

too wide outside off again. Another wide

"back of a length, punched to long on, off the back foot"
"<b>through Pooran's legs at midwicket</b>. Bad ball, dragged too short and Pant smashes a pull into the ground, hit quite hard. Pooran was set to gather it but perhaps got bad bounce and the ball goes through"
"<b>lovely placement</b>. Full outside off, Pant takes a stride out and drives powerfully through cover. The man in the field can't get to it on his right. The man on the boundary can't run around and stop it to his left"
"<b>flicked straight to deep square leg</b>. Offcutter on a fuller length, Pant went down and flicked it powerfully, almost Kohli-like, generating distance and power, but not quite enough, as he picks out the man in the deep. End of a very good innings"

"short, well outside off, cuts to deep point"

"full on the pads, whips it with his wrists between long-on and deep midwicket"
"late swing into the batsman, who is trying to almost helicopter it away, but misses. Thuds into pad and Joseph's appealing - bad idea because it was easily going down leg and it also gives the batsman the space to steal a leg-bye"
"yorker on leg stump, he gives himself room but it's too close to his body to do anything much and he can only hoick it to long-on"
"giving himself room again, Joseph keeps it full and straight on the stumps, and the batsman slaps it down to long-off"
"this time he didn't give himself room, though made as if he would. Joseph bowled it full and just outside leg, but with Jadeja staying put, he was in ideal positoin to flick it past short fine leg"

"length ball angled across him, he horribly mis-times his swipe, and it lobs up to Pollard at long-on, who holds on easily"
"fuller on the stumps, jams his bat down in time to send it to midwicket. Quick single taken, safe despite the fielder running in and effecting a direct hit at the striker's end. <b>wait a minute, replays show Jadeja was out of the crease!</b> The umpire didn't go upstairs though. And now they're going up to the third umpire. Which means Jadeja will be ruled out. Bit bizarre sequence of events. Wrong process, but right decision? If a West Indies fielder appealed when the direct hit was effected, there is still a justification for going up to the third umpire, even if late in the proceedings. But is it okay to go up <i>after</i> having seen the replay? That's one for the law mandarins to figure out."

"yorker length outside off, swipes at it, wanted to go in the direction of cover but takes a thickish edge to short third man"
"slower ball on a length, too far down leg. Wide"

"length ball, swipes across the line to deep midwicket"
"normal pace bouncer that flies through, past his attempted wild slog"
"back of a length on middle and leg, pulled to midwicket"
"length ball on the stumps, he's moving across and bunts it square to give the strike to Dube"
"full outside off, Dube uses his power to drive this over extra cover. But Pollard's at wide long-off and runs across to tumble and save the ball"
"length ball on the stumps, Dube clears his front leg and swipes across the line. Doesn't get hold of it. Slower ball that stuck in the pitch and he gets more height than distance, holes out to long-off"
"full toss on off, smears it from deep within his crease but straight to Cottrell at deep square leg. Chahar thinks that was above waist height and is looking displeased it wasn't called. they belatedly go up to the third umpire who confirms, it was above the waist. Chahar survives."
"well bowled, going across him and on a yorker length and he misses it. But they take the bye, even though it's gone to the keeper"
"leg cutter on leg stump, mistimes his pull to deep midwicket but gets enough on it to get a couple"
"yorker outside off, he was moving across, drives it to extra cover and they'll end only with a single"
"full, swings in towards off stump, driven to mid-off"
"back of a length, close to off stump, swings away late and Hope ends up getting beaten on the <i>inside edge</i> while trying to defend. Was he playing for more swing than there was? Huge gap between bat and body"
"another outswinger outside off, a little fuller, left alone"
"back of a length, a bit of shape away from the right-hander, punched into the point region"
"length ball close to off stump, gets forward and defends towards backward point"
"length ball outside off, a bit of outswing again, left alone"
"beauty. Late outswing in the channel outside off, from a good length. No footwork from Ambris, just defends from the crease and gets beaten by a long way"
"another outswinger on a good length close to off stump, this time Ambris gets a bit of a stride towards the ball and defends to cover point"
"length ball on middle stump, and that's superb timing, clipped away through the vacant square leg region, leaving fine leg far too much work to do"
"shifts back to the outside-off line, a little wider than the first few balls. Quite full, left alone"
"lovely shot again. This wasn't too straight - it was a length ball on off stump, but Shami doesn't get as much outswing on this occasion, and Ambris times his flick beautifully to beat midwicket diving to his right"
"length ball outside off, a bit of late away movement, left alone"
"back of a length outside off. Decent amount of width for the back-foot punch that Hope is attempting, but the ball stops on the pitch, and he ends up playing too early and hitting it back to the bowler rather than through the covers"
"big outswing from outside off, fullish length. Left alone"
"length ball, fifth-stump line, gentle outswing, left alone"
"back of a length, closer to off stump, punched to mid-on"

"fullish, close to off stump, shows the full face for a push to the left of mid-on"
"ooh. Outswing from a leg-stump line. Squares up Hope, who plays slightly across the line, looking for midwicket, and ends up playing it back to the bowler off the outside half of the bat"

"back of a length close to off stump, defended into the covers"
"back of a length on off stump, gets on his toes to ride the bounce and defend to point"
"big appeal for lbw, and it's given. Ambris doesn't review. Length ball angling into the stumps, and Ambris looks to flick. He was playing for outswing, I think - a dangerous thing to do if you're playing across the line like that - and the ball keeps going with the angle instead and brushes front pad before hitting his back pad. Hitting middle and leg, according to ball-tracking. No front-foot stride at all from Ambris"
"full, slanting across into the fifth-stump channel, left alone"
"back of a length close to off stump, punched to cover"
"length ball slanting across into a wide-ish line, looks like the slower offcutter. Hetmyer has a poke at it, with an open face, and edges it on the bounce to slip"

"another offcutter, this time on a stump-to-stump line, clipped towards mid-on"
"back of a length, angling into off stump, stands tall and chops to backward point"
"ooh, lucky. Back of a length, angling in in the channel outside off. Hetmyer plants forward and looks to slash it away, but the inward angle denies him room. There's extra bounce too, and the thick edge flies over the fielder at slip"
"back of a length, close to off stump, chopped down into the point region"
"length ball angling into middle and leg, clipped to midwicket"
"another edged four. Bouncer, skiddy one that climbs towards Hetmyer's left shoulder. Goes for the hook and top-edges high over the keeper's head"
"length ball close to off stump, gets forward for a push towards mid-on. Didn't quite middle it, and that gives him the time to take a quick single"
"full, angling in towards middle and leg, slower ball. Looks to clip it square, ends up playing it into the short fine leg region off inside edge and then pad"
"shot. Length ball, fourth-stump line, nothing wrong with the ball, but Hope steps forward and drives on the up, with a turn of the wrists on top of the bounce to find the gap between cover point and extra-cover"
"shortish outside off, and the ball stops on Hope as he shapes to cut, ends up dragging it down to mid-off"

"back of a length, angling in towards off stump, punched towards mid-off"
"back of a length, angling into off stump from wide of the crease, clipped to midwicket"

"fullish outside off, doesn't quite time his drive and it dribbles out towards extra-cover"
"fullish, angling in towards off stump, gets forward for a push back towards the bowler. They've gone upstairs for a belated run-out appeal, after Shami flings a direct hit at the batsman's end. He's well in, though"
"skiddy bouncer over off and middle, and Hope has to duck very low to get under it"
"back of a length close to off stump, punched to extra-cover"

"tossed up, floating across the right-hander and pitching outside off stump. Clipped with the turn to long-on"
"flighted ball, full and close to off stump, driven to long-on"

"length ball turning from middle to off, gets forward to block"
"tossed up, drifts outside leg and spins back in. Looks to sweep, misses, and the keeper misses it too. If it had turned a little more, he could have been bowled round his legs"
"slow flight close to off stump. Looks for the cover drive but plays too early, bottom hand coming into play. Ends up inside-edging into the turf by his feet"

"tossed up wide of off, driven to cover point"
"another googly, spinning away from off stump. Stretches out to block into the covers"

"shortish outside off, stabbed away to deep point"
"tossed up slow on off stump and Hetmyer drags a big drive down to long-on, all along the ground"
"starts with a short, wide one. Uncharacteristic, because he usually attacks the stumps from that angle. Hetmyer slaps it away to the point boundary, and the sweeper is too far in front of square to be able to cut it off"
"shortish, closer to off, slapped to sweeper cover"
"full on off stump, clipped to the right of midwicket, and they set off for a confused single. A stutter in between, and Kohli dives, stops it, and throws at the keeper's end, but it's too far from the keeper to create a run-out chance. Could have been close, because Hetmyer was a little late getting going"
"shot., This wasn't as wide as the first ball. Instead, he uses the depth of the crease, and waits on the ball before cutting it away past backward point"
"tossed up wide of off, driven to sweeper cover"
"tossed up on middle and leg, clipped towards midwicket"
"shot. Read the length beautifully. Dangled up slow on off stump, and he knows he's hitting against the turn, but he judges the length well, knows it's within reach of his swing, and he slog-sweeps it mightily over the midwicket boundary"
"back of a length close to off stump, goes back to try and force it past backward point, but Rahul dives to his right to make a good stop"

"back of a length, spins from off to leg, and he goes back to work it to deep backward square leg"

"flat length ball on middle and off, gets forward to clip with the turn through square leg"
"flat and full outside off, gets forward to jab into the covers"

"back of a length on off stump, goes on the back foot to clip to midwicket"
"shortish outside off, chopped to backward point"
"tossed up on leg stump, the line possibly telegraphs the googly. Hetmyer reverse-sweeps to backward point. Too full for him to get a full extension of his arms and put any real power on it"
"back of a length on off stump, goes back and defends with the turn to midwicket"
"length ball spinning from leg to off, gets forward to defend into the covers"

"slower ball, digs it short of a length, Hetmyer fetches the pull from outside off to deep midwicket"
"<b>hung in the air a while</b>! He was early into the push forward and it pops up, but drops short of Kohli at short cover"
"length ball on the stumps, slaps it down to deep midwicket"
"back of a length, pace off outside off. That's going to be Chahar's plan to Hetmyer, with three men on the legside boundary. This time the batsman whips it to deep midwicket along the ground"
"length on the stumps, punched to extra cover"
"back of a length but close to off stump, he goes back and uses wrists to whip this to long-on"
"<b>Chahar misfields at short fine leg</b>. Drifts down leg and is tickled fine. Chahar is rushing in as they take a quick single and doesn't collect, resulting in an extra run"
"length outside off, driven to long-off"

"short, rocks back and pulls to deep midwicket. Not timed perfectly"
"fuller, punched on the front foot to long-off"
"length ball, strays on the pads, tucked to deep square leg"

"length on the stumps, defended back down the pitch"
"digs it in short to Hope also now, who also goes for the pull. Gets it to deep midwicket, though without any great timing"
"back of a length, coming into him on off, he stays back and swipes across the line to long-on. <b>Fifty</b> for Hetmyer."
"slower short ball outside off again, and he he bottom edges an attempted pull onto boot. He's lucky it didn't roll back and disturb the stumps"

"length ball closer to off stump, he shuffles across and plays it to mid-on with a straight bat"
"short outside off, clears his front leg and slaps it hard to long-off"
"tossed up, full on middle, he makes room and drives inside out to long-off"
"<b>dismissed</b>. Dragged short again by Jadeja, and this time Hetmyer connects nicely. Goes back and slaps a pull shot over long-on"
and once again! This time he goes deep and smacks it over deep midwicket. Are the IPL scouts watching?
"length ball in the channel, opens the face to run it down to third man"
"good length on leg stump, sticks in the pitch a bit, and Hetmyer ends up pushing it back to the bowler"
angles this across him on a fullish length outside off. He mis-times the slap to mid-off
"<b>super shot</b>. This has been hit between long-on and deep midwicket and managed to beat them both by how well he hit it. Too short from Dube, and he rocks back to pull this powerful and flat."
"length ball, going across him, plays it on the front foot to extra cover"
"length ball on the stumps, goes deep in his crease and flicks it off his pads to deep midwicket"
"length ball outside off, defended into the offside"
"tossed up, drifts down the pads, turns it round the corner on the front foot"
<b>lovely shot</b>. Hetmyer's winning this battle handily at the moment. This was quicker on a length outside off - because he couldn't afford to be short after those sixes - and Hetmyer goes back and cuts it past backward point
"fuller on off, worked off the front foot"
"fuller outside off, comes on the front foot and guides it to point"
"quicker one, length ball nipping into him, he flicks it off his pads to fine leg"

goes back and flicks it off his pads to deep square leg
"<b>inside edge goes for a boundary</b>. Came off the glove in fact. Good ball on a length and jagging back in, the bounce caught him by surprise as he was coming forward. Clips his glove and goes to fine leg"
"fuller outside off, driven to the man on the cover boundary"
"back of a length on leg, hint of movement away, steered to point"
"yorker on off, and he jams his bat down in time to push it to mid-off. <b>Overthrows</b> and they get an extra run. The fielder, let loose a throw that nobody could collect at the bowler's end. Pant had to dive to his right to stop the ball but couldn't gather cleanly"
"<b>whoa, what a hit!</b>. Too short and he rocks back to absolutely smoke it over deep midwicket"
"length ball on the stumps, guides it to point"

"<b>brilliant diving stop by Pandey at the point boundary</b>. But this was an equally brilliant shot too. Kuldeep's been bowling it wide of off and spinning it away. Hetmyer's caught on and he waits for this, gets into position nicely by transferring weight across and cutting it"
"fuller on the stumps, lunges out to defend"
"length ball on the stumps, he takes a big stride and smothers it"
"length ball, he went back to this one, and wasn't in perfect position to play it, ends up jabbing it down"

"tossed up on a length outside off, he can't get to the pitch despite a big stride and mistimes the drive to mid-off"

"tossed up on off, gives himself room and drives to wide long-off"

"slower now, on off stump, stretches out to block to extra-cover"
"drifts onto the pads, and Hope tucks it fine of short fine leg"
"lucky. Full, angling in towards off stump. Looks to clear his front leg and drive over mid-off, and gets a thick edge that runs away to the third man boundary. Short third man is too square to cut it off"
slower bouncer outside off. Too early on the pull and he ends up hitting it back to the bowler
"another slower bouncer, a little wider outside off. Hetmyer swings and misses thanks to the loopy bounce, looking for the pull"
"<b>dropped</b>. Iyer has put down a straightforward chance here. Short, angling into off stump. Sits up, but loses a bit of pace off the pitch, and Hetmyer can't get this flat-bat hit to carry over long-on as he might have expected. The fielder at long-on, Iyer, dives forward, and can't wrap his hands around the low chance a few inches off the ground"
"back of a length, a bit of width, opens his bat face and steers it between short third man and backward point"
"back of a length outside off, steps forward and drives on the up to deep point"

"low full-toss now, on off stump, and he drives punchily to the left of extra-cover, leaving long-off no chance"
"full now, clipped to deep midwicket"
"wow. That's full and angling into off stump. Not the full length that allows you to get forward, but the near-yorker length that doesn't, in theory, give you room to free your arms. But he shifts his weight back, Lara-style, and drills it hard to beat extra-cover to his left and long-off to his right"
"full, on the stumps now, clipped to long-on"
"length ball angling into off stump. Stays back, opens his bat face, and dabs to third man"
"gone. Short now, climbs to shoulder height, and this time he can't clear the rope with his pull. Has to work against the over-the-wicket angle, and ends up picking out Iyer on the midwicket boundary. Generous applause from the Chennai crowd as Hetmyer walks back to the dressing room"
"length ball close to off stump, punched towards mid-off"
"full, close to off stump, opens his bat face to squeeze it out to third man"
"tossed up on middle stump. Can't get to the pitch of it to flick through midwicket, rolls to short fine leg off the inner half of the bat"
"quicker now, clipped to the left of short fine leg and they think of a single but decide against it"
"brilliant. Wrong'un, starting from off stump and spinning away further. Doesn't pick it. Presses forward to push into the covers and it slips past his outside edge. They go upstairs to check for a stumping but he's fine"
"big spin the other way now. The length has been brilliant right through the over, drawing Hope forward but never allowing him to get to the pitch. Tries to flick it and it spins past his inside edge and hits his front pad. Missing leg"
"flatter now, spins down the leg side as Hope looks to shuffle and work it leg side"
"the fullest ball of the over, on off stump, stretches out to drive to long-off"
tossed up outside off. Looks to sweep but only manages to hit it to short fine leg off the bottom edge

"length ball close to off stump, and once again Hope dabs straight to point in an attempt to find a single"
"bouncer now, rising over leg stump. Hope ducks low to evade it"
"short outside off, only gets up to chest height and sat up nicely. A welcome release of pressure for Hope, who pulls to beat midwicket to his right. Deep square leg is behind square, so there's no way he can cut it off"
"length ball outside off, driven powerfully but straight to deep point"
"short again, doesn't get up as much as Pooran expects, and he plays a controlled flick-pull, from in front of his chest, to deep backward square leg"
"tossed up outside off, can't beat point with his sliced drive"
"tossed up nicely again, a little closer to off stump. Looks to sweep and misses, and the ball turns away sharply"
"this is a difficult pitch for a new batsman. Sharp turn again, from off stump. Should have been on the front foot. Looks to make room and is beaten by a long way, jabbing at the ball"
"a bit slower, similar line, swept along the ground to deep square leg"
"beauty. Flatter wrong'un, on off stump, and Hope is stuck to the crease, turned inside-out in defence as his outside edge is beaten"
"quickish again, spinning down leg. Can't put bat to ball as he tries to work it off his thigh pad"
"big appeal for lbw, but is that turning too much? Not given by umpire Shaun George, and India <b>have reviewed</b>. Classic left-arm wristspinner's delivery. Floating across the right-hander, dipping on him, pitching outside off, and ripping back in to beat the inside edge of the forward defensive. Impact is in line with off stump, but, as I suspected, it's turning too much and missing leg stump, according to ball-tracking. Pretty big stride too"
"length ball slanting away from off stump. Not full enough to drive through cover, and the ball beats his outside edge"
"short, gets up to waist height on off stump, pulled to deep square leg"
"back of a length outside off, punched to sweeper cover"
"short, wide, slapped to deep point"
"full on middle and off, clipped to long-on"
"full, angling across to off stump. A little early on the drive, and he plays it back to the bowler rather than through mid-off as intended"
"back of a length on off stump, uses his wrists to play that to long-on"
"slower ball, back of a length, angling into off stump. Looks to work it with the angle and misses. Ricochets off the pads into the backward point region"

"slower short ball on off stump, pulled to deep midwicket"
"short, angling into off stump from wide of the crease, pulled firmly to deep midwicket"
"back of a length, wide of off. Looks to cut off the front foot and ends up bottom-edging towards the keeper"
"full on off stump, pushed towards mid-off"
"shot. Fantastic shot at a crucial time. Short, angling into the ribcage, and he hops across and whips it over short fine leg. Maybe the short ball wasn't the ideal one to bowl with fine leg in the circle, but he still had to play a really good shot to exploit the field"
"in the blockhole on off stump, opens his bat face and steers to deep point"
"full on middle and leg, clipped to deep midwicket"

"shortish, angling across to off stump, flat-batted down to long-on, kind of toe-ended"

"steps out and Dube responds with a slower short ball. Swivels too early into his pull, and he ends up bottom-edging into the short third man region"

"slower length ball on off stump, lets it come on and dabs gently into the off side"
"offcutter, nips in sharply towards off stump as Hope initially shapes to push into the covers. Has to adjust and work it through square leg instead"
"back of a length on off stump, punched to deep point"
"slower ball, back of a length close to off stump. Lets it come on and dabs gently into the point region"
"fullish on off stump, driven firmly and straight to extra-cover"
"bang. Back of a length, angling into the stumps, and it's the knuckle ball. Hope slides away to the leg side to make himself room, holds his shape beautifully, and flat-bats it hard, back over the bowler's head, and over the boundary as well. Super shot"
"and there's the hundred. It's been a struggle, but he's hung in there, fought the conditions and his own lack of fluency, and he's now earning the rewards. Short from Chahar, and he pulls it away to the right of midwicket"
"short ball on off stump, mistimes his pull to midwicket"

"short, sits up at waist height, and Pooran wins it with another cracking stroke, a flat pull to the left of midwicket. What a victory for West Indies"
