"decent pace first-up but sliding into the pads, Roy is off the mark with a nudge to leg"
"outside off, on the back foot, punched firmly to cover"
"on the toes, and that's sumptuous timing from Bairstow, clipped firmly in front of square. Everything he touches goes at the moment. (Even the balls to which he gets out...)"
tapped to the leg side and through they jog
whipped to the leg side
pushed onto the back foot and tapped back down the pitch
pushed onto the back foot and there's a bit of a pop from a good length. Roy rides the bounce
left alone outside off stump
"through to the keeper, and left alone once more"
"on the back foot again, a half-cock drive back to the bowler"
"<B>slammed to the fence!</B> You can't bowl there to any international batsman, or most club batsmen, to be fair. Short, wide, and in the slot for the cut"
"leaning onto the front foot, and pushed back down the pitch"
"another beautifully timed strike from Bairstow, utilising the width and extra pace, placing bat on ball, and easing it through backward point"
"fuller length, tighter line, drilled to cover"
worked into the covers once more
"attempted pull, sounded like a thin snick, but it was off the underside of the arm-pit as Roy was through his shot too soon"
"punched off the back foot, into the covers"
"good wheels to finish the over! A brisk bouncer, Roy contemplates a pull but the ball has soared past him"
punched firmly into the covers but a good half-stop at point ... But Maxwell looks to have landed on his shoulder there... think he's okay
"a flowing back-foot drive, straight to the fielder but good intent from Roy once more"
"full length, hint of outswing, tucked to short midwicket"
"attempted wallop across the line, no contact this time as the ball dies through to the keeper"
"full stride, down the pitch and defended to mid-off"
another thump into the covers
worked to point
"a hint of late nip back into the right hander, who can't time his drive, as it inside-edges into his thigh"
"<B>that is butchered through the covers!</B> Less movement this time, and Bairstow finds a full face, wonderful balance, on the front foot and whistling to the rope"
a bottom-handed punch but straight to short cover this time
"banged in short, but that's not too high for the umpire's liking. Well directed"
a big swish across the line but that is through to the keeper
"<strong>panned through the covers</strong>, oodles of bottom hand, lovely ball-striking"
"good sharp running, England looking lively"
"angling into the stumps, eased out to point off the front foot"
"<B>nailed over long-off!</B> That is formidable power, bottom hand coming through the line. It's a short boundary, but that would have cleared most!"
"<strong>flogged up and over extra cover this time!</strong> Not timed on this occasion, but Bairstow picks his spot well, finding space behind the inner ring. Expensive over..."
"<B>another boundary, this time off the toes!</B> Richardson over-compensates, slides into the pads, and is clipped imperiously in front of square"
"good areas to start, tweaking into the pads"
"pushed confidently into the covers, Bairstow's rapid running ensures an easy couple"
"<strong>thwacked with intent, up and overs the covers!</strong> One, two, three bounces and into the rope. Selective and dismissive"
"fuller face on a more probing length, pressed back down the pitch"
"squashed through point, and up comes England's fifty in dismissive fashion. Too much width and tonked to the rope!"
<B>pounded over the leg side!</B> This is getting brutal already. The early arrival of spin has just clicked England into a higher gear. In the slot and duly slotted!
"punched firmly, but back to the bowler"
"outside off, an offcutter, opens the face and glides down to third man"
"chopped to third man, a swishing back-cut"
cut once more
another back-foot biff through backward point. This is naive cricket from Australia and England are utterly flying now
"flogged off the front foot, tighter line this time, and cover intercepts"
opens the face for a dab through third man
"tighter line, Bairstow has a swish, <strong>and nicks through to the keeper!</strong> Bairstow was a victim of over-confidence there, looking to leather everything in his slot, but picking the wrong shot for that ball. The switch of ends works, and Australia have a toe-hold!"

tucked to the leg side

"dug in again, 81mph on off stump, Hales latches on to a rasping pull shot and <i>creams</i> it in front of deep square leg, that's left the fielder with no chance"
"wanged down short, 88mph and too hot for Roy as he thinks better of hooking"
"rising off a length, dabbed down behind point and they scurry through as Maxwell fields to his left, whirls around and fires in a throw, misses the stumps"
"length, 85mph and defended into the covers"
"oh, ripped through 'im! Richardson spears Hales with the perfect line and length, <b>through the gate to hit the top of middle!</b> That's Kryptonite for Hales, seaming in and sending him back to the hutch for a middling score"
Root lines this up in defence
"short and at the body, 88mph but that's bread and butter on the hip, Root skims it fine and beats the man on the rope to get off the mark with a four"

angled in with the arm and worked through the leg side
"pitched up, Roy hammers a drive at extra cover and Agar can't collect it first time, the ball bobbling away and they take one"
"pulled flat hard into the deep - <b>but D'Arcy Short dives forward to hold a blinder!</b> Stoinis celebrates, but credit to the catcher, a fine bit of work on his debut! Root had skipped down as the ball was banged in short, he tried to get on top of an aggressive panhandle through midwicket and looked like he might get away with it... only for Short to come up standing tall, scooping the ball up inches from the turf and then holding tight as he slid forwards"

"back of a length, slower ball, slapped behind point and good running too"
"<strong>a flamboyant drive through the covers!</strong> Flogged on the up, pierces the field. All of these breaks are doing nothing to disrupt Roy's momentum"
"that, on the other hand, will do very nicely! A cross-seamer from Tye, zipping into the right-hander, catching the toe of the bat as it does so, and <B>what a take from Paine!</B> Changing direction to fling himself down the leg-side, and grabbing in one hand. Quite the recovery from his blow in the face just now!"

"swinging down the leg side, another extra to the cause"
solidly drilled down to long-off
"pushed out to the off side, another fifty stand"
"<strong>inside-edge onto the stumps!</strong> The slower ball does for Billings ... he never got going really, failed to pick the variation and shivered his own timbers"
"<strong>short and slapped in front of square!</strong> Moeen is not going to hang around, and he's got licence to wallop today! This could be fun ..."
"attempted wipe through the leg side, but that one is through him too quickly"

"cracked hard into the leg side, taking on the short ball, and not quite timing it. Lands safe in no-man's land"
"attempted ramp, Richardson adapts his line, so Buttler jabs the toe of his bat at the ball to pick off the single to third man. Impressive ninja skills for the single"

"slashed off the full length, down to third man. Buttler back on strike ..."
"short and slapped to mid-on, a bit scuffed, but they take the single"
"whoops, a mistimed wipe to the leg side, a non-existent single, but Plunkett figures it's better to get Buttler back on strike. He's not even in the frame as the bails are whipped off. Fair play!"
"short, slapped down the ground, back they come for two. This innings may appear to have petered out ... <a href=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;filter=advanced;opposition=2;orderby=team_score;runsmin1=300;runsval1=runs;team=1;template=results;type=team;view=innings target=_blank>but it is still their highest ODI total against Australia</a>!"
