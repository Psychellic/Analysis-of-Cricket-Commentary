"138 kph, some swing. Full but moving back in to de Kock. Starts it too straight though and clips the pad on the way to leg gully"
good adjustment. Hits a good length on middle and off. Not much movement. Blocked with the closed bat face to mid-on
back of a length on middle and leg. A bit leg side-ish to Qdk who works to midwicket
"nice from Dinda. Good length, swinging away from iyer who steers to point with his feet rooted to the crease"
"nicely played this time. Nagging lines around off, Iyer stays back to punch off the back foot, allowed the ball to skew off to third man"
great start from Dinda. Errs in line a touch this time. Leg side-ish line. Shovelled to midwicket
"decent start for him as well. A bit of away shape on a good length, straight! Defended towards extra cover"
"again, goes wider of the crease a touch to get some outward movement. Prodded away to point"
"slightly too straight this time, Iyer punches to mid-on off the back foot for a run"
"beaten. Seems to be just enough in this wicket for the seamers. Full length, moves away just enough to beat de Kock's flaying drive"
"extra bounce this time. Good length on middle, away movement beats de Kock's prod this time. Surprised by the bounce"
comes back in prodigiously to end another good over. Impressive stuff. De Kock miscues a drive to mid-on for one
"given! De Kock plays all around a straight delivery. And plumb. Full on middle, Dinda gets some inward shape. Pitched on leg and middle, and swerves back in to hit de Kock in front of middle. Easy call for the umpire. More movement has done for Qdk"
good bowling. Inviting swing by pushing the ball fuller. A bit too full though and easily nudged to midwicket
"superb lines. Top-of-off stuff, not much movement though and Nair eases into a defensive push to cover"
"inside edged this time. Back of a length on off, some more signs of extra bounce. Chopped into his body"
"good change in length. Surprises Nair. Shortish length outside off, Nair swivels into a pull stroke but no connection"
"too straight again, but tucked straight to midwicket. Another wicket maiden for Dinda this season."
"uppish but in the gap. Nicely bowled nonetheless. Fullish and wide, moving away. Iyer leans into the cover drive and nails it. Races away"
"superb from Ajinkya. Back of a length outside off, chopped into the surface, to third man. Nop, Rahane dives to his left to save the run"
"good run that. On a good length outside off, pushed away into the cover region for a run"
"shot! too much width and punished. Overpitched outside off, Nair doesn't bother keeping it down. Lifts the cover drive over extra cover. Exquisitely timed"
bowling both sides of the wicket. Too straight on Nair's pads and easily tucked off to fine leg for a couple
good end. Nagging away outside off with an outswinger. Pushed to backward point off the back foot
"too straight from Dinda, 142 kph. Helped off his hips to fine leg"
"nicely done. Not adequately timed but well enough. A tad too full on off, and so Nair backs away and lofts over cover. Timing not great but enough power behind the stroke for four"
"great batting. On Nair's pads again, and easily flicked away. To the square leg boundary. Much of the early swing seems to have ceased"
"bunted to mid-on. Pace off the surface? Fullish on leg, chipped for one"
"taken! Another wicket for Dinda. Surprises the batsman with that length. A well-directed bouncer on leg, Iyer backed away for a heave but the ball hustled onto him off the pitch. He was in no shape to pull but went through with the shot. Was in no control of it and could only miscue to deep square leg where Khawaja settles under the sitter"
"a half-volley on off, driven to mid-off. No movement at all"
"nice start. Good length outside off, Sanju pushes to extra cover from the back foot"
"fullish length on middle, nurdled towards midwicket for an easy run"
nice lines. Careful of not overpitching these deliveries and so he bowls a good length delivery on middle. Punched to midwicket
"hmm, some nip back in. Good length, jags back in, probably off the seam. Nair hangs back to block"
Nair shuffles across to off and easily whips the ball to fine leg. A manufactured stroke
nice run. Tip and run to midwicket. Full length on middle and pushed away into the leg side
"ooh, swing immediately for Irfan. Swings back in to middle and leg, Samson clips with the angle to midwicket"
"a tad too straight, Samson should have done more with that. Leg side-ish delivery and the ball thuds into Samson's pads"
"back of a length change-up, 120 kph. Too short, too slow and easily pulled to fine leg"
"shortish and wide, 130 kph. Nair laces a cut to backward point"
"ooh, too straight to play that shot. Back of a length, comes back in with the direction of swing. Nair tries to dab a steer to third man but the inward movement helps in hitting him on the glove"
"short and wide, loose. Smashed to deep cover"
"fullish length outside off, chopped into the surface, towards third man"
"nice and straight on off, a good length. Samson opens the bat face to guide to third man"
"good length outside off, Nair stays back to punch to backward point"
"nice bowling. Delivers one short outside off, Karun tries to pull but the ball is too high and too wide outside off, and so he bails out"
"another dot. 134 kph, good length, jags back in. Nair backs away and swats the ball back to the bowler"
"lovely end to the over. Back of a length outside off, Nair shuffles across but can only tap to point."
"excessively full and wide, Samson executes a late dab to third man. A couple to Ashwin"
"another brace. Again too wide outside off, Samson puts the ball in front of point this time, for a couple to the sweeper cover"
"low full toss on leg, some swing in the air. Driven to long-on"
"lovely shot. picked the length of the shorter delivery early and once he did that, he rocked back and pulled in front of square. Perfectly in the gap for four to square leg. Excellent"
"an overthrow. Fullish on off, tapped to point. Rahane is quick on it and hits the stumps direct at the batsman's end but the ball ricochets for one"
"full and wide, 131 kph. Samson flays a drive but the poke beats the bat."
"overpitched legbreak to start, drilled past cover for a couple. Nicely played"
"and again. More flight, more loop, more width. Smashed to a wide deep cover for a couple more"
"slowed up nicely on off, Nair strides forward to defend towards point. Soft hands mean an easy run"
"flatter on leg, nudged to square leg for a run"
"the googly this time on middle, Nair goes back and punches a checked flick to deep midwicket"
"beauty. Splendid bowling. Slowed it up, drawing Samson forward. The legbreak rips past the outside edge and Samson is closer to the bowler than he is to his stumps. Dhoni completes an easy stumping to end a decent stand. Really nice pace from Zampa"
"fullish on off, pushed to cover from the crease"
"too short, Nair rocks back after picking the length and then clatters the pull to the square leg boundary. Exceptional timing and placed it well too"
"decent comeback. 127 kph, on off. Nair can only defend"
"fullish length outside off, Nair stays back and pushes the drive to backward point"
"fullish and wide outside off, Nair backs away and mis-times a drive to mid-off"
"nicely done. Full and wide outside off, lots of away swing. Pant drives loosely, away from his body, and the ball goes through"
"flatter trajectory outside off, Nair goes back to push to long-off"
"nicely done. Ashwin thinks the batsman is coming but Pant isn't. Flatter delivery outside off, pant slaps to cover who dives to stop"
"lovely. Lots of spin, nice pace and as a result, some spin is extracted. And beats the outside edge"
"flatter on leg, clipped to backward square leg"
"premeditated the sweep. Slow and wide outside off, Nair gets down on one knee and slog sweeps to deep midwicket"
"bunted back to the bowler. Excellent bowling, slowed that up. Pant hangs back to check his flick"
"tossed up on off, pushed to long-off, with the spin. Zampa has been impressive with his variations in pace and length. For a legspinner, his accuracy has been superb"
"googly outside off, Pant stays low to pull to deep square leg"
"tossed up again on off, Nair mis-times his sweep to square leg. Another single"
"flatter delivery outside off, 75kph. Pant misses a cut"
"googly on middle, started it down leg and so it was easier to pick. Pant nails his pull to square leg."
"another wicket. Another googly, Another Zampa wicket at Vizag. Very full was the googly, Pant attempted an across-the-line slog but the away-moving delivery helps take the outside half of the bat. Skied and taken at long-off"
"floated up on leg, defended"
"some more flight outside off, pushed to long-off, with the spin. Great bowling"
"another flighted delivery outside off, the ball deviates in to hit Nair on the pad"
"driven to long-on, with the turn"
"oh no. Poor fielding by Irfan. Flatter delivery down leg, Duminy smashes the sweep but straight to Irfan at short fine leg. The ball goes past for four."
"more flight on off, JP strides forward to play a defensive stroke"
too full to sweep. Flat from Zampa but wider outside off. Nair premeditated the sweep  but misses
"shot! Flatter outside off, Nair backs away and lofts the drive over cover. Played that with the turn"
"given. Another iffy decision. Flat on off, Nair goes for another sweep but misses. The ball spun a touch and hit Nair in front of off, but was there too much spin? It certainly seemed so considering the amount of turn Zampa has been getting. No doubt in ump Shamsuddin's mind though"
"overpitched on off, driven to long-on"
"googly outside off, chopped towards point for a quick run."
"flatter delivery outside off to end, slapped away from the back foot to deep point"
"reverse lap missed. Slowed up at a flat trajectory on off, Morris reverses his body but no connection"
"short on off, Morris rocks back to club a pull to deep midwicket"
"nice pace. Slowish on off, defended towards point for one"
"carrom ball, down leg. Nudged with soft hands to square leg. Just the one"
"flat outside off, a hint of turn. Pushed back to the bowler, another dot"
well played. Much slower on off but JP goes deep in his crease to work to square leg
"82 kph, tossed up outside off. Pushed to long-off"
"flat again outside off, Morris can scythe a cut to deep point, not much more. Great bowling"
"overpitched on middle, turned to deep midwicket with a flick"
"superb. Flat on off, pacey to prevent Morris from getting under the length. Driven to cover"
"loopy delivery this time. Down leg, Morris misses a sweep and is struck on the pads. Pitched outside leg"
"flat delivery on off, Morris goes back and laces a cut to deep point. Another sensational spell, excellent use of the variations"
"uh oh. Flat down leg, Morris helps it on its way to the fine leg boundary. Easy pickings"
much flatter and very wide outside off. Wide called
"another wide. Much slower on off, the ball rips past Morris' sweep, and goes down leg. Another extra"
"floated up outside off, slow. Morris cuts to deep point. Just one"
"slowish and wide, Jp taps a cut to point. Just another run"
"the carrom ball, on middle. Pushed to long-on. Not much happening for Daredevils"
"flat on middle, Duminy rocks back deep to clip to deep midwicket"
"carrom ball to finish. Flat on off, pushed to cover. Daredevils going nowhere"
"the wide yorker outside off, sliced by JP to point who fumbles and allows two"
"scooped straight to short fine leg. Daredevils sink deeper. A low wide yorker, Duminy gets across and executes nicely. But cannot find the gap. Straight to Irfan st short fine leg who dives low to his front"
"short delivery outside off, Coulter-Nile misses a hard pull. Another dot"
"overly full on leg, swiped to long-on. 137 kph. No timing in his stroke."
"lovely from Morris. Yorker outside off, speared in the blockhole. Morris intentionally gets under it and slices the ball over point. Four, amazing shot"
"138 kph, yorker on leg to finish. Morris jams one out to midwicket to keep strike"
"another yorker on middle, Morris inside edges to fine leg. Dinda is quick on it to prevent the second"
"low full toss on middle, Coulter-Nile skews his swipe to deep midwicket. Just one more"
"nicely played again from Morris. Backed away, made room, got a full delivery on leg. And so he carved the ball over extra cover"
shot! First six of the day. Amazing timing. Gets a low full toss on off but he knows mid-off is up so he just times the lofted drive and gets enough behind it to clear the long-off boundary
"oops. dropped and it goes for four too. Low full toss on leg, Morris gets outside the line and scoops the ball to short fine leg. Bursts through Dinda's hands and races away for four"
"massive to finish. What a poor delivery, a low full toss on middle. Morris clears one foot and slogs it away over midwicket. Way back into the stands, what a cameo this has been by Morris"
nice swing to start. A reminder of Zak at his best. Full and swinging in to Rahane's pads who flicks to deep square leg
"full and wide, more away swing. Khawaja drives to mid-off with leaden feet"
"too wide and called, Started his outswinger much too wide and called"
down leg this time and another wide ensues. May have been the inswinger this time
"nice stuff. Full and straight, gentle away shape. Blocked"
"squares Khawaja up slightly. Good length outside off, enough movement to have Khawaja prodding, a thick outside edge to third man"
"a slowed delivery, 132 kph, on off. Defended"
"back of a length outside off, Rahane tries to flick but the ball skews off the outside half to cover"
"poor start. Short and wide outside off, very wide and called. NCN isn't too happy with his landing. A bit of a hobble"
"poor delivery and dispatched. Full on Khawaja's pads, inswing and Khawaja picks it off to the backward square leg boundary. Easy"
"good adjustment. Good run. Back of a length on off, Khawaja stands tall and defends off the back foot. A brisk run to cover"
"ooh nice. Full and wide, just enough outswing to take the ball swerving past Rahane's drive. 146 kph, impressive pace too. The fuller the ball, the more chance for swing through the air"
"nop, cannot bowl there. Full on middle and leg, nudged off towards midwicket"
"steered straight to that gully fielder. Back of a length outside off, glided to JP"
"superb from Jinx. Short and wide, what do you expect? Rahane stands tall and slaps the ball over cover point. Easy runs. Daredevils not off to the start they needed"
"out with a direct hit, but Shami misses. Fullish on middle and leg, clipped towards midwicket. Khawaja sets off, then sends his partner back. Rahane scurries back but the throw misses"
"poor delivery. Full on leg, Khawaja tickles it fine, and the ball races away to the fine leg boundary."
"uppish but safe. Not in control, Khawaja stood tall and drive flashily away from his body. Just past cover and four more"
"slower delivery on off, tapped to extra cover for a run"
too straight again from Zak and worked off his pads to deep square leg.
"awesome. 136 kph, full on middle. An exceptionally-timed on-drives races past the stumps and clatters into the long-on boundary. Supergiants running away with this"
"nicely bowled. Hits a back of a length on off, pacey stuff. Rahane arches his back and executes a late dab to third man"
"full and wide, in the slot for Khawaja who thrashes the drive but finds extra cover. Not the place to bowl to UK"
"much much better. A good length outside off, a fifth-stump line. Khawaja is stuck in the crease and misses a loose waft"
"136 kph and gone! Full and wide outside off, in Khawaja's hitting arc but got there a bit early and the ball skews off the outside half of the bat. Khawaja ends up slicing the ball in the air and straight to backward point."
"lovely lines. Fullish on off, jagging back in. A thick inside edge onto his pads"
"oh no. Slipped out probably. Full and wide, past the tramline and de Kock does well to prevent four wides"
"back of a length on off, Bailey is rushed through the pull and mis-times to mid-on"
"good length on off, Rahane strides forward to defend"
"fullish and wide outside off, punched off the back foot, into the surface to cover"
"almost a drag on. Short and wide, Rahane flays a cut but inside-edges past the stumps"
"well run. Fullish on off, pushed to wide midwicket and Rahane calls 'yea, yea, yea' and Bailey responds"
"fullish length and wide, Bailey, this time, wafts away from his body and is beaten"
"slower delivery and straight, Bailey pats it into Zaheer's follow-through stride. So, Rahane says 'no, no, no' and Bailey responds"
"impressive stuff from Morris. Shortish delivery outside off, hustles Rahane for pace. Rahane arches his back for an upper cut but is beaten by the excess pace"
"fullish on middle and leg, a closed bat face takes the ball to deep square leg. Just the one"
"full on off, driven back to the bowler who has an aggressive shy at the batsman's end."
"ooh, the slow dipping full toss goes wrong. Very high and down leg. No ball called. Way over waist height. Free it coming up"
"smeared away over midwicket. Fullish on off, Bailey clears the front foot and swings through the ball"
"back of a length down leg, pings off Bailey's thigh pad for a leg ye to short fine leg"
"awesome shot. All timing and four for Rahane. Fullish and wide outside off, Rahane stays in his crease and times the drive exquisitely. Just a back foot punch through cover"
"back of a length delivery outside off, pushed to cover from the crease"
"fullish on middle and leg, clipped to wide mid-on for a run"
"full and wide, Rahane times his drive to cover"
"looked like a legcutter on middle, pushed to long-on"
"nagging lines around off and middle, Bailey blocks"
"whoa, what happened there? Short delivery on middle, Bailey gets a top edge on his pull and it clatters into his helmet. The helmet detaches and somehow falls behind the stump. Bailey is alright, although completely unaware of where the ball is. All fine"
"nicely tosses this one up on middle, Rahane defends"
"beautiful pace. Flat on off, Rahane goes back to cut to point"
"slightly too flat on middle, Rahane pulls to long-on. Shami gets around and lets it go through his hands and then his legs and to the boundary. Uh oh. Poor from M Shami"
"the googly? A bit of extra bounce on off, Rahane gets on top of the bounce well and cuts to deep point"
"flatter trajectory on middle, pushed to midwicket, A bit of a fumble allows one"
"82 kph, nice end to the over. Flat on middle but gets some turn. Leading edge to point for a run"
"executes this time. Short delivery on off, the all jags back in but Rahane sways out of the way and gets some bat on his upper cut. Got it off the inside half of the bat, but to the fine leg boundary"
steered to point off the back foot
"fullish and wide, not a great resumption from NCN. Scythed to deep point"
"shortish delivery on off, sits up for Bailey to swivel to deep square leg"
"133 kph, back of a length outside off, glided off the open face to third man"
"134 kph, back of a length outside off, punched to cover off the back foot"
"goes wider of the crease and bowls it fuller, Rahane defends"
s;lightly too short on off and Rahane rocks back quickly to flay a cut to deep point
"lots of flight on off, driven with the spin to long-off"
"flatter delivery, was it the googly? Rahane punches back"
"fullish, but Rahane goes back instead of coming forward, but pushes to cover"
"<strong>big appeal</strong>, the googly. Bailey doesn't pick it and is beaten. rapped on the pads but sliding down leg"
"nice start. Good length on off, the ball jgs back in prodigiously. Rahane is cramped for room, the ball sneaks back in and clips the pad first before the bat. To point."
"more nip for Shami. Good length but starts it too straight, off the pad towards the keeper"
"135kph, back of a length outside off. Rahane flays at the ball and gets a thick outside edge to the third man boundary"
comes back in again. Rahane not quite picking these inswingers. Mis-timed back to the bowler
"six. Shot, much better. Plays it with the direction of swing. Overpitched on middle, Rahane clears one foot and pummels the lofted drive over long-on with enviable ease. Picked his spot"
steered to third man with the open face
