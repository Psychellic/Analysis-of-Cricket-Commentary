"lovely. Good length, angled in at off stump, opens the face and blazes it past point"

"slower ball, low full toss at off stump. Picks it and absolutely nails the slog. Finds deep midwicket. <b>That's fifty for him</b>"
"full toss at off stump, opens the face to find the square boundary  on the off side. Short third man does phenomenally to dive to his right to save a four. Then throws unnecessarily to concede an overthrow to deep midwicet. McCleneghan there"
"yorker at off stump, brings the bat down hard at this. Chops it to short third man again, who takes a crowd-catch and holds on to it this time"

"slower ball, good length outside off, slices it uppishly to find sweeper cover"
"full at leg stump, whips it nicely, wide of deep midwicket who fumbles and allows a second"

"slower ball, short and wide, tapped to short third man"
"length ball at off stump, sits up nicely for him and he pulls this on the up over deep midwicket. This length has become predictable for Pandey"
<b>but it's a full toss next ball and also a no-ball!</b> Oversteps and bowls a knee-height full toss at middle stump for Pandey to dispatch between long-on and deep midwicket while he smiles at the thought of a free hit next ball
low full toss at his legs. He's standing outside leg stump and moves his leg away to let it go past him. Umpire calls wide. Bowler unimpressed. Rightly so.
"<b>misses the yorker again.</b> Errs on the shorter side this time, so it's overpitched at middle stump. Pandey is standing deep. Gets under it and launches it flat over the bowler"
"yorker, full and wide outside off, can't get bat on this. Wanted to pick third man but is beaten"
"<b>this time he's successfull!</b> Low full toss, wide outside off, opens the face and taps it through the slip region to find the third man boundary"
"yorker outside off stump, opens the face and runs it to third man"
"....anti-climax. Yorker at off stump from around the wicket, gets him on the toe in front of off stump and the umpire raises his finger. Even though replays showed he got a big bottom edge on that."
"wide-ish length ball to start, and Parthiv plays a good-looking drive, straight to cover point"
"back of a length in the corridor, a bit of shape away, beats Parthiv's defensive poke. No footwork there"
"short, a bit of width, Parthiv stabs it away crisply, just opens his bat face and sends it racing away to the right of backward point and leaves third man no chance of cutting it off to his left"
"big slash and miss. A little fuller, wide again. Parthiv flays at it and the ball shapes away to beat his bat"
"back of a length outside off, steered down to third man"
"full, a bit of swing in towards middle stump. It's the lbw ball, but Buttler hasn't planted his front leg firmly, he quickly moves it out of the way and clips the ball away through square leg. Lovely shot"
"back of a length, the line is slightly wrong, swings past Parthiv's hip down the leg side"
"shortish, slanting across Parthiv, gives him a tiny bit of room. Flashes hard at it and misses. Thought I heard a tiny click, and Uthappa does a belated half-appeal, but no one else is interested. Big bottom edge, Ultra Edge says."
"back of a length, swinging down the leg side again. Parthiv misses the glance, but gets some thigh pad on it down towards fine leg"
"short, a bit of shape in to cramp Parthiv for room. Tries to cut, ends up chopping it downwards, into the pitch, and it rolls away square on the off side to enable the single"
"full, wide outswinger. Buttler chases and misses, looking for the cover drive. Signal of wide - a little harsh in my opinion"
"back of a length, straightens along the off-stump line. Buttler gets back and across to defend into the on side"
"back of a length close to off stump, dabbed away towards backward point"
"another play and miss from Parthiv. This one threatened to shape in and then nipped away off the pitch from a good length outside off. Went for the big, flashy cover drive and got nowhere near it"
"back of a length, this time it's Boult's turn to swing one down the leg side. Both these bowlers seem slightly put off by the right-left combination"
"ooh,  beaut. Came back in a long way, pitched just back of a length, cramped Buttler, and roared past his inside edge as he chopped hurriedly downwards. Appeal for caught behind, but there was no inside edge, just thigh"
"back of a length, swings towards middle and leg. Buttler lets it come on and tucks it through backward square leg"
"length ball swinging away fairly wide of off. Parthiv is early on the cover drive, drags it to mid-off. Throw from Lynn is at the bowler's end with no one backing up and no chance of running Parthiv out. Gives away a needless overthrow"
"play and miss. Again. Down the track this time, making himself room, ends up a long way from the ball as Boult swings this away from an off stump line. Was looking for the big hit over the covers"
"super timing to follow up. This one's a little fuller, and Parthiv holds his shape much better than he has been. Just waits and plays a regular on-the-up drive and bisects mid-off and extra-cover"
"strange innings, this. A couple of beautiful shots, a lot of ugly swipes. This is an ugly swipe through the leg side, off the bottom of the bat, off a back-of-a-length ball on off and middle"
"down the track, making room. Woakes bowls the wide outswinger, shortening his length a touch. Buttler reaches out for the slap, misses, and for the second time CK Nandan signals a slightly harsh wide off Woakes"
another wide. Saw Buttler looking to make room and bowled it on a sixth-stump line. Buttler just leaves it this time
"back of a length close to off stump, rides the bounce to punch this away through point"
another wild swish and miss. This time he swipes across the line of a back-of-a-length ball angled across into a fourth-stump line
replay of the previous ball. This one was a lot closer to off stump. Parthiv is lucky he wasn't bowled
"same shot again, off the same sort of ball. This time he catches the pull with the inside half of his bat and it bounces gently to the left of midwicket"
"wow. That's a stunning shot. Woakes goes full and at the stumps, and Buttler takes two nimble steps across and scoops it, easy as you like, over the fine leg boundary"
"oh man, what's happened here? Buttler steps down the track, doesn't quite get close to the pitch of this ball. Looks to hit over mid-off, doesn't really middle it, and spoons it high in the air. Lynn, turning around and chasing from mid-off, puts in a big dive, doesn't quite get to the ball, and ends up injuring himself. The ball comes to a stop six inches from the rope, but the batsmen don't notice and only run two before Yusuf Pathan puts in a spint and throws it back. Maybe they didn't run because they didn't want to take advantage of Lynn's injury. He's gone off the field now. Looks like his left shoulder."
"starts his spell with a shortish ball on leg stump, and Parthiv cashes in, pulls it to the right of the deep square leg fielder"
"whoops, misfield. Parthiv steps away from leg stump to try and make room, and Narine lands a sharp offbreak on a good length, spins it across his bat face and he edges it wide of slip"
"pitches outside leg again, flicked to short fine leg"
"looks to make room again, Narine bowls a shortish offbreak and follows him by shifting his line outside leg. Parthiv pokes it gently into the covers"
"no premeditation this time. Narine fires a length ball at off stump. Stays back and chops towards short third man, Buttler calls for the single. Yusuf hits direct at the striker's end but Buttler is safe"
"short, wide, Buttler misses out, cuts straight to cover point, who's inside the circle. The ball did bounce a little extra, though, so he had to work a bit more to get on top of the bounce"
"googly. Parthiv looks to make room to cut, and it cramps him and he bottom-edges into the pitch"
"another googly, I think. This one is short and down the leg side. A wide, after Parthiv missed swatting it fine"
"googly again, cramps Parthiv as he tries to cut. Chopped down into the covers for a hurried single"
"fullish, close to off stump, turns into the right-hander. Buttler stays back and defends"
"down the track now and he doesn't quite reach the pitch. Swiped away, along the ground, to deep midwicket"
"big turn. This looked like a pullable long-hop until it turned sharply, away from Parthiv. He drags it to mid-on, just rolls gently to the fielder"
"back of a length, stock ball that turns in and cramps Buttler for room. Dabs towards point for another quick single"
"back of a length on the stumps, goes deep in his crease to whip through midwicket"
"shortish offbreak, looks to cut but can't make enough room. Jams the ball down into the ground near him, bounces up to the bowler"
this one turns the other way from a fuller length. Buttler gets forward to push into the covers
"this is an offbreak, in the perfect slot for Buttler to smash it away, with the turn, a lot of bat-speed, over long-on"
"back of a length this time, Buttler makes room to flat-bat this offbreak to the left of long-off"
"looks to slog this over the leg side from wide outside off, misses. Narine bowled this one much quicker than his previous balls, I think"
"shortish stock ball pitching outside off, Buttler flat-bats to long-off. The ball seems to be stopping and turning quite a bit"
"wham. Parthiv middles one after a while. Floated up outside off, and Parthiv gets down low for the slog-sweep over wide long-on. He was hitting against the turn, but it was full enough for that not to matter"
"given! Parthiv looks to sweep again, stepped across his stumps before doing so, and missed. Length ball, pitched on off stump, and straightened towards middle and off. Looked a fairly straightforward decision"
"shortish googly, looks to pull, only manages a bottom-edge that runs away to the fine-leg boundary"
"sweeps this time, from outside off down to deep backward square leg"
"length ball on middle stump, turning in. Presses forward to defend and gets an inside edge that rolls into the square-leg region"
"length ball on middle and off, clipped to midwicket"
"back of a length, sliding down leg. Looks to shuffle across and glance it fine. Only gets a little tickle of pad down to the keeper"
"low full-toss, a bit of inswing, and Buttler plays across it and misses. Big lbw appeal, and it's given immediately. I wonder if it may have been going down leg. Seemed to strike him in front of leg stump with a fair distance still to travel, with that late swing. Not the greatest decision from Nitin Menon."
"full on off stump, nearly in the blockhole, clipped to mid-on"
"shortish close to off stump, gets on his toes to punch to deep point"
"lovely delivery, slanting across the left-hander with a bit of outswing. Rana doesn't move his feet, just pushes at it, and the ball beats his outside edge by a fair distance"
"short, a bit of width. Turns away and Rohit edges his cut into the ground, to the man at slip"
"cuts again, another dot ball, this time despite the fielder at backward point fumbling a simple stop. Kuldeep the fielder"
"back of a length outside off, punched to deep point"
"length ball on leg stump, clipped away to deep midwicket"
"a lot of legbreaks this over, and Narine has foxed Rohit with the offbreak. Goes on the back foot and it hurries into him. Big lbw appeal as he plays all around it, given immediately, but CK Nandan shouldn't have. Huge inside-edge on that - two poor lbw decisions in successive overs."
"back of a length, straightens towards off stump. Krunal is stuck on the crease, jams his bat down hurriedly to defend"
"fullish on off stump, defended with the angle to cover, no real footwork"
"back of a length on middle and off, punched back to the bowler"
"full, attacking Rana's feet. He gets his feet out of the way and scoops this in the air, on the bounce, to long-on"
"short, down the leg side. Big appeal for caught behind after Krunal misses the pull. No wide signal from the umpire - that's because it hit him on the hip on the way through"
"short again, this one's chest high outside off, enough swinging room to pull that to the midwicket boundary"
"length ball on leg stump. Seems to stop on Pandya, but he goes through with the flick and just clears the leaping fielder at midwicket"
"tossed up on off stump, Rana goes for the reverse-sweep, hits it straight to short third man"
"flighted ball outside off, driven to long-off"
"shot! back of a length, not too far outside off, lets it come on and uses the pace to dab to the left of the keeper and the right of short third man"
"flighted and very full outside off, a yorker. Rana tries to force it  away through cover, can't connect"
"this time he does connect. Some flight again, full and just outside off. In Rana's slot and he slog-sweeps into the gap between deep midwicket and long-on"
"flight again, and this one's wider outside off, Rana gets a big stride forward and just launches that over extra-cover. Effortlessly done"
"back of a length down the leg side. Krunal looks to shuffle across and work it fine, only manages a thin edge through to the keeper"
big lbw appeal first ball. Not given. Looks like he got the ball to tail in again. Pollard played across his front pad and missed. Height seemed to be the issue there
"back of a length on off stump, clipped away to the left of long leg"
"short outside off, and Pollard will feast on these chest-high offerings. Swivels and pulls hard and flat over the midwicket boundary. Super shot. Short balls need to get up around shoulder or head high to test Pollard"
"slower ball, full outside off, jabbed to point"
"full outside off, nearly in the blockhole, again a bit of shape in. Pollard looks to stay next to the line of the ball and slice behind point with an open face, but can't put bat to ball"
"flighted ball outside off, swept hard to deep square leg"
"back of a length close to off stump, punched firmly back to the bowler"
"Googly, Pollard didn't seem to pick it. Read it off the pitch and defended from the crease, with soft hands"
"pitches the googly fuller and wider, looking to induce the edge to slip. Pokes hesitantly into the point region, sets off, and is slow to turn, but makes it back safely enough. Throw to the keeper is wide, on the bounce, and Uthappa doesn't collect cleanly"
"another googly, but this was short, and he goes back to whip to deep midwicket, who misfields to allow a second"
"stock ball this time, turning in towards middle stump. Pollard plays from the crease, defends it. Didn't seem to read it out of the hand again"
"length ball on middle and leg, clipped away through midwicket"
"they'll get four this ball. Short, angling into Pollard, rising fairly steeply and cramping him. He swivels quickly, though, and pulls fine - fine leg is too square to be able to cut it off"
"back of a length on middle and off, punched to long-on"
"gone! Or is it? How did it carry that far off the thigh pad? Shortish ball at the body, looks to pull, and it lobs up to the fielder at short fine leg. Not much of an appeal from KKR, and yeah, it's off the thigh pad"
"goes deep in his crease to manufacture length, get under this full ball. Can't get under enough to get the elevation he'd like with that hit - which is good for him, because his shot isn't timed all that well and it bounces well short of long-on."
"back of a length outside off. Looks to make room and carve over the covers, misses"
"back of a length, pitching outside leg and turning towards leg stump. Rana flicks to deep midwicket"
"down the track, gets to the pitch of this flighted ball and drives to long-on"
"tossed up on middle and off, looks for the big sweep, drags it squarer than he'd like and Woakes running in from deep square leg and diving forward, can't get close to it. It bounces a couple of feet from him and hits him on the chest"
"down the track again, doesn't get close to this offbreak. Flicks hard at it, and it rolls down to short fine leg and nearly undoes the fielder with sharp turn off the outfield. Was spinning away to Suryakumar's left and he did well to stop it"
"down the track again, gets close to the pitch and clips to deep midwicket"
"ends his spell with a dot ball. Offbreak, tossed up slower. Rana goes for the slog-sweep and misses, and the ball doesn't miss off stump by much"
"big wicket, and is that the match? Wide short ball from Woakes, banged in to get some bounce on it. He has third man back, and Pollard goes for the cut and ends up slicing underneath, up in the air and straight to the fielder"
"down the track, making some room. Woakes bangs it short again, angling across the left-hander. Looks to slap over cover, ends up slicing on the bounce to third man"
"short, a bit of width. Has to jump to get on top of the bounce, chops it to the left of cover"
"shot. Manufactures the length with a big step back, deep into his crease. Shortens Woakes' length, clears his front leg, and flat-bats over cover"
"<b>missed run-out</b>. Again that step back, and Woakes retaliates with a slower ball, fuller. Slaps it to mid-off, and has to run a greater distance because of that back-foot step. The throw to Woakes is on the bounce, and he fumbles it. Ends up breaking the stumps with just his hands, with Rana well short of his crease. Did well to rush back to the stumps, though, Woakes."
"short, wide, and this time Hardik puts it away with a rasping square-cut. Just bullets to the point boundary"
"full-toss, thigh-high, angling down leg. Looks to swat it away and only manages to get thigh pad on it"
"slower ball, back of a length on the stumps. Looks to pull and only manages to squeeze it away through backward square leg off the inside half of the bat"
"low full-toss wide of off stump, and he's found the gap very well. Just angles his bat face to thread it to the left of backward point and the right of third man"
"another full-toss, on the pads this time, and Rana has just flicked that for six over backward square leg! Super timing on that"
"slower length ball outside off, slogged away, along the ground, to deep midwicket"
"what a six-hitter this man is. Short, angling into the body, and he simply clears his front leg and clears the wide long-on boundary with a flat pull. Wow"
"another six! This time it's Rana. Full-toss on the stumps and he shuffles across to the off side, exposes his stumps, and scoops the ball fine, to the right of the keeper, and gets it to carry all the way"
"another full-toss. Are KKR struggling with dew? Similar line and a little higher than the previous ball, and this time he moves leg-side of the ball and scoops it over mid-off to bring up his fifty"
"gets the yorker right, but his line is wrong, a fair way down the leg side."
"he goes full, on the stumps, and he gets his man. Looks to make room, Rana, and slices it to point. Hits it well, too well, straight into Narine's hands at shoulder height"
"yorker on off stump, and that's the shot Harbhajan played to win the Chennai Test in 2001. Jams down with an open face to dab it behind point. He got a two then, only a single this time"
"another full-toss, angling into the stumps, and Hardik has clobbered it. Clears his front leg again, and swings it away, cleanly, over the midwicket boundary"
"slower length ball on middle and leg, the legcutter. Plays with a straight bat, pushes to long-on to retain strike"
"full, down the leg side. Looks to swipe it away through square leg, only gets pad on it, rolls down towards fine leg and they scamper two"
"full-toss again, and Suryakumar has fumbled on the long-on boundary! The simplest of stops, and it slips through his fingers and rolls over the rope. Extra pace meant Hardik couldn't get the elevation he wanted on this, just hit it hard along the ground to long-on"
"bouncer, that's a very accurate bouncer at a pressure moment - rising towards Hardik's head. He does well to sway out of the way"
"<b>dropped!</b> Another bouncer, Hardik has to fetch this pull from over his right shoulder, ends up top-edging. Rishi Dhawan, the deep square leg fielder, runs in, stops, slips momentarily on the dewy turf, and has to dive to complete the catch but can't get near it"
"a four to win it! back of a length, at the hip, and fine leg was to square to stop this. Does well to swat it away really fine, and a despairing dive from Rajpoot can't stop Mumbai from winning this"
