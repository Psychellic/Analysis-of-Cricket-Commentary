"a slightly leg side-ish start, back of a length on Uthappa's hips and an easy nudge to fine leg gets KKR off and running"
"won't be needed if Southee bowls there. Short and wide, an easy offering, but Gambhir's delightful cut finds point"
"ooh, a bit of bounce there. Bangs it in on  a back of a length outside off, the ball flies over Gambhir's flaying bat"
"short of a wide slip, good lines these. Fuller length outside off, a bit of away shape. Gambhir pokes and steers the ball on the bounce to Pollard at slip"
not a bad line but Gambhir walks across and makes it a leg side-ish delivery. His nudge finds square leg.
strays too much in line this time and he'll have to re-bowl that. Wide down the leg side
dabs the last ball down to third man to get off the mark. A tidy over from Southee.
"good tight start from Bumrah with that very rigid action. Fullish on off, Gambhir walks across and plays across the line, to square leg. Buttler fumbles while diving. One to Gambhir. Parthiv keeping today."
"nice stuff. Full outside off, close to off with that inducking movement. Uthappa strides forward and drives comfortably to mid-off."
"there is that movement again. Full outside off, coming back in. Hits Uthappa's bat on the inside half and goes towards mid-on for one."
"ugly from Gambhir, but this is T20 right? Full outside off, Gambhir shuffles to off and looks for a smear over midwicket. No connection with the bat"
"much better from Gambhir. Full on off, and Gambhir drives on the up to wide mid-off for one"
"back of a length outside off, this time. Uthappa is forced into a defensive tap to point"
"back of that length outside off, Gambhir was shaping for a hoick but improvised well, patted towards backward point where Pandya puts in a dive, but fails to stop the run"
"nice, very nice. A tad too straight and Uthappa works it off his pads, past square leg and the outfield did the rest. Uthappa may have shuffled across to convert it into a delivery he could manufacture"
"off the pad for a leg bye. Very straight this time, down leg in fact. Clips the pad and Parthiv fumbles"
"very short bouncer. Gambhir pulls but that was a foot over him. Parthiv leaps and collects, a vexed look on his face"
"nicely played. Back of a length on off, steered away to third man."
good run. Uthappa taps a good delivery down towards cover. All are on the circle and the pair get through for a comfortable run
"four more. Not the most attractive shot but one of the most effective. Overly full on middle and off, Gambhir stays in his crease, his feet nowhere and works the ball past midwicket for four. Looked awkward"
fullish delivery but Uthappa makes it a run again. superb. Pushes to mid-off and calls for the run immediately
"short and wide, Gambhir stays tall and slaps a cut past backward point. Third man is square enough to cut it off"
"worked to midwicket. Rayudu picks up but aims for the umpire's head, misses. Slipped out of his hands while throwing. Some dew maybe?"
"gone, big wicket. Banged in on a back of a length, Uthappa tries to pull but is hurried by the pace and bounce. Way too late on it and the ball lobs up, Pollard takes an easy catch at cover. A solid start turns into an iffy one. Big wicket."
"lovely lines. Full on off, a bit of away swing. Gambhir can do nothing but play it away on the off side"
too straight and shovelled away to deep square leg
"streaky from Gambhir. Not looking too good out there. Fullish outside off, Gambhir drives away from his body and gets a very thick outside edge, Bumrah does well to cover the ground and cut it off, from third man"
"better from GG. Tip and run cricket. Plays one down by his feet, towards point and gets a positive response from Pandey"
"what was that? Almost carried to fine leg too. Short delivery, well-directed bouncer. Pandey plays a forehand swat, without looking at the ball. Off the edgy part"
"fuller than a good length outside off, pushed to cover"
"gets that stroke this time. Full on middle, not a bad delivery but Gambhir was always looking in that area. Flicks off his legs for four over square leg"
"that is a poor delivery and Gambhir puts it away nicely. Short down leg, Gambhir just gets bat on his pull and the short boundary helps."
"shot. Picked the length early, picked his slot and executed with ease. Too short from McClenaghan. Sits up for Pandey to bludgeon through the vacant midwicket region. Neither a bouncer or a good length."
"tightens up his length immediately. Good length on off, Pandey awkwardly hurries out of the line and taps to point."
"slower ball, 132 kph. Or a slowish ball, I guess. Pandey backs away and slaps to point. Did not quite time it well enough."
"all tennis from Pandey. Short delivery on off and middle, Pandey backs away and muscles a forehand down to mid-on."
"good length on off, Gambhir, it seems has taken guard on off, nudges to square leg"
"that is a slower ball. An offcutter banged into the pitch, Pandey looks for a swat through the leg side but is surprised by the change in pace. Misses"
"fullish length on middle and off, Gambhir closes the bat face to work to square leg"
"fullish length outside off, a hint of inward movement. Chopped towards gully for one"
full on off and whipped through midwicket. Superb timing on that. A tad too straight with this stance. Pandya has got to push his length farther outside off
"good chnage in pace.  A slower delivery outside off, grips in the wicket a touch. Gambhir pushes to point and sets off."
"slower delivery but too full, cannot bowl there. Pandey picks it early and that was all that was required. The offcutter cuts back into his hitting arc and the straight loft clears long-on with ease"
"fuller length but outside off, better change. Pandey dabs to third man, bat well away from the body."
"decent start. Not too much flight, on middle and leg. Not trying too much off his first ball, all experience. Pandey flicks to fine leg"
"flat on leg, Gambhir works to square leg. May be needs to be a bit slower to see what is available for him on this wicket"
"flat again outside off, Pandey drills a drive to long-on"
"nice, tossed up outside off but a tad too full. Driven away to the sweeper cover."
"darted in outside off, a hint of turn, not much. Pushed to long-on again"
"fired in on off, tucked away to square leg. Six singles off the over. KKR biding their time"
starts off with a flat delivery down leg does Suchith. Gambhir attempts a cheeky sweep but misses. Wide
"<strong>dropped</strong>. Big moment in the game. Tossed up on off, Gambhir comes down with nimble feet but flicks it powerfully but in the air, straight to midwicket. Comfortable height. But bursts through the hands of Rohit Sharma"
"two for Pandey. Slow on middle and leg, Suchith goes for a hoick but gets some bat on it to fine leg"
"flat down leg, wide called"
"connects with that sweep this time and the lightning outfield gets Pandey four. Full down leg, and helps Pandey with that shot. Placement and timing check, boundary check"
"nicely played, works one off his pads with soft hands and calls for two immediately. Knew what he was doing all along."
"not too slow, not too quick. Good pace. Worked away to midwicket from off stump"
"slowish this time, too slow, lots of time for GG to rock back and work to square leg."
"beautiful bowling, good intent from GG too. Always looking to use his feet but the wily Harbhajan fires it on off, the arm ball. GG improvises a cut to point"
"slow through the air this time, on middle and GG's eyes light up. A massive swipe is attempted but inside-halved down to short fine leg"
"massive. Six all the way, never in doubt. Harbhajan offers a bit of loop, the first time he has to Pandey and pays for it. Hammered over midwicket for a massive hit"
"flat outside off, Pandey looks for a cheeky reverse sweep but gets hit just outside off. Massive appeal. Too much doubt, I reckon"
"nudged away towards square leg, soft hands and placement imperative to two and Gambhir does that excellently. Southee picks up and fires a throw on the bounce but Gambhir makes it. Nice running."
"flat delivery on middle and leg, Gambhir misses a routine flick. Maybe late on it due to the fatigue of last ball's second run"
"superb shot. Danced down the pitch, got there and used the best place on the ground. Right back, over Gambhir's head. Has it carried though? Marginal call, a bit of the turf explodes. But six called. On the full"
"flat on middle, wristily flicked away to deep midwicket. Harbhajan labours across and sticks out a boot"
"Pandey teeing off. A bit of flight on middle, Pandey comes down again but doesn't get any of it at all. Skewed to square leg"
"just over deep midwicket for six. But that was all in his favour. A bit of air from Suchith on middle, Gambhir comes down, hitting with the spin and smashes the ball. Not all of it but enough"
lovely batting again from Gambhir. Shrugging off the uncertainty from the start of his innings. Shortish outside off and chopped behind point for a couple
"flat on off, driven to long-off"
"awesome running from Pandey. Gambhir pushed one down towards wide long-on, Pandey was always coming back and pulled his partner through. But despite a direct hit at the batsman's end, GG is comfortably in"
"shortish length on off, Gambhir opens the face of his bat to guide to third man"
"nicely played. Sitting back, waiting for that length. Not quite short enough for the fine ramp but the open face travels hurriedly to third man"
"shortish outside off, cut away to point for a couple."
"very short delivery, slower bouncer, loops over Gambhir. Called"
"<strong>fifty for Gambhir</strong>, a classy innings after an uncomfortable start. Slower delivery outside off and dabbed to third man. Raucous applause from the Eden crowd and why not"
"140 kph, tight on off but Pandey scurries away from the line to find third man with a steer."
"full on middle, chipped over midwicket for a couple. Decent placement."
"very intentionally played from Pandey. Impressive batting this. A slower ball outside off, Pandey waits and waits and then just steers the ball off the open face to the third man boundary."
"another slower ball on middle, pushed back so straight that it hits the stumps at the bowler's end. Goes through with the run off the ricochet to get <strong>to his fifty</strong>"
"slower delivery again outside off, played away towards point"
"superb execution of the yorker. On middle, but GG does well to jam it out to fine leg for one"
"naughty full toss from Bumrah, looking for that yorker. Pandey flicks to square leg, gets a couple. Harbhajan and Southee collide but Southee does well to stop it"
"fantastic placement required a fantastic bit of fielding from Pandya. Flat outside off, drilled to wide long-off, Pandya needed to put in the dive and did to fruition"
"slowed up on middle and leg, gambhir is unable to get under it, to deep square leg"
"very slow on off, Pandey is way too early through the sweep and toe-ends it back to the bowler"
"gone, beautiful bowling. Flat delivery on off, but with a slower trajectory. The topspinner. Pandey is too early through the shot and gets a leading edge, which is gratefully accepted by Harbhajan"
"flat outside off, fired in. Patted towards point for one"
"nicely tossed up outside off, Gambhir drives loosely away from his body and gets a thick outside edge to short third man"
"short bouncer, Russell backs away, anticipating that length, but fails to get bat on his ramp. Luckily so, maybe."
"slower bouncer, good execution. Outside off and Russell is way too early through the shot. Beaten"
"connects with that alright! Flattest six I have seen. Short again from Southee, Russell sees it early and bludgeons it <s>over?</s> past midwicket. Phew, the power"
"very slow delivery outside off, too wide, called"
"low full toss, looking for that yorker but misses. Not a bad delivery nonetheless. Long-on clears up after the shovel from Andre"
"six more. Another legcutter on off from Southee but Russell lines him up, gets in shape by clearing his front foot. Need more be said? Sends the ball flying over long-on"
"good delivery. Very full on leg, pushed to deep midwicket. Not a bad result for KKR"
"in the gap and six more. Flat from Harbhajan on off,  but that doesn't matter to Russell. Stays in his crease and swats one over midwicket. Placed that beautifully"
"excellent yorker on off, edged down to short third man"
"slowed up on middle and leg, Russell misses out on five runs. Off the thigh pad towards short fine leg"
"flat on middle, a thick top edge goes over short fine leg for a run. Spins away from Bumrah, but he does well"
massive slog attempted but it goes in the diametric opposite direction from where he intended. Looked to go over deep midwicket but gets the toe end which races away to the third man fence.
pummeled to the sweeper cover
"well bowled from Bumrah, very full outside off and quick. Doesn't allow Russell to get under it, drilled to long-off"
"oh no, oh no. Dropped. Eden goes mad. Slower ball on off, Gambhir is too early through the shot. Goes straight up and Bumrah settles under it but spills the sitter."
"in the air again, and falls in no-man's land. Losing his shape through these hits. Did not carry anywhere, over the bowler for a run"
awesome yorker. perfect. Russell can't connect
"slower ball on off, hit so badly to long-on that even Pollard can't prevent the two to the fatigued Gambhir"
"oh no, in that arc and it has gone. High into the night. Slower offcutter on middle and leg, smashed over square leg. An easy six."
"short outside off, slapped to the sweeper cover. On to you, Dre, he says"
"bowled im. Big big big wicket. McClenaghan is pumped. Short delivery on middle, Russell backs away and looks for another of those powerful forehands into the stands but the ball hustles him for pace. The under edge crashes into the stumps. Massive moment. Could be a 10-15 run difference"
"out with a direct hit maybe. Another short delivery on middle, Pathan is very late on it, the pull skews to midwicket. McClenaghan runs after it and throws at the bowler's end but misses"
good delivery. Another slower bouncer and Gambhir misses. One for the over
"goes for four. Shortish delivery outside off, Gambhir backs away and flat-bats it over cover. Suchith runs across but palms the ball back onto his other hand which then ricochets to the boundary"
"slogged to square leg. Absolutely no timing, no shape"
"this time Gambhir has to walk back. Full delivery on leg, right in the arc for the big hit but Gambhir is through the shot too early. Gets a leading edge which lobs up high in the air, Parthiv backtracks and shows his team-mates how to do it, albeit with gloves on. Classy knock"
"full outside off, driven past wide mid-off. Did not look like he got enough but the outfield does it for the batsman again. Flies past the diving fielder"
"good bouncer, short on middle, Pathan too late on the stroke again but lands in no-man's lands, in front of square leg"
"slower delivery outside off, carved away to the sweeper cover"
"slower ball, deceives Pathan, but he gets some part of his bat on it to square leg"
"very wide, full toss outside off. Munro doesn't bother, wide called"
"slower ball on middle, slogged to square leg with decent timing. Midwicket and square leg sprint around but there is a fumble. Just two anyway"
"excellent yorker. Not much Pathan could do, squeezes away to midwicket"
"slower delivery, excellent bowling. Lots of cut and the ball swerves past the hoick"
"another slower ball on off, a very Mustafizur-type offcutter, Munro can't get bat on it."
another one. Munro comes down but can't do much. Toe-ended away to cover.
"yorker on off, bunted down to long-off, Munro races back for the second, but Pathan doesn't bother. Munro is run out."
"gets four does Suryakumar. Four to finish. A slower delivery outside off, Yadav goes for the reverse lap and gets a bit of glove on it, beats short third man and carries to the boundary."
"excellent start. Full on off, tailing back in just enough. Rohit forced into a defensive stroke"
"good again. Full, not as straight, but Rohit pushes to mid-on"
"six for Rohit, in that typical fashion too. A poor delivery, must be said. Full down leg, Rohit picks up the flick and it goes deep over square leg. Easy"
"ooh, the inside edge just evades the stumps. Full and wide, Rohit throws his hands at it but gets an edge to fine leg for one"
"fullish outside off, pushed to cover."
"amazing stuff from Pandey at backward point. Shortish and wide, not the place to bowl to Parthiv. The cut is stopped by a diving Pandey, saved three"
"good length on off and middle, maybe just a hint of away shape. Worked to square leg"
a sound as the ball passed the pad but the umpire calls wide. Strays down leg and Parthiv misses his flick. May have been a bit of pad
"poor ball. Short on leg, Parthiv is quick on that length, has been and always will be. Sends the ball flying over square leg with a swat"
"good length on off, nice adjustment. Tapped back"
"good length but too straight again, a thick inside edge onto the pad for a run"
"excellent delivery. Jumps wider of the crease just during point of delivery, and bowls it full and wide. Rohit plays away from his body, towards cover"
"Rohit at his best. Full on off, the straight bat face is offered and the ball finds the long-on fence in a jiffy."
"edged for four. Too short and too wide again, Russell doesn't learn from the previous over. Parthiv throws everything at it and the edge flies away to the third man bolundary"
"slower ball, good change in pace but too full. Parthiv stays in the crease and drives uppishly, with no feet movement. Easily past mid-off"
"another poor delivery. Shortish and wide, there for the cut and Parthiv goes after it. Misses this time"
"the slower bouncer outside off, Parthiv bends his back, gets into a ramping position but cannot connect"
"another thick outside edge, Flew to third man, Hastings gets in one, maybe two strides to cut it off with a dive"
"overpitched outside off, a lazily elegant drive is ill-timed to mid-off"
"flat delivery on middle and leg, Parthiv hurries back but beaten for pace. The skiddy delivery beats Parthiv's pull, a leg bye to short third man"
"short and punished. Rohit picks up the length quite quickly and hurries back, the pull past square leg earns him four"
"tossed up wider outside off, not much turn. Slides past Rohit's outside edge"
"the wrong un this time, Rohit goes for the big loft down the ground but misses. Uthappa, unable to collect, concedes the bye"
"flat outside off, skids on again and chopped to short third man"
"poor delivery and dispatched. Short on middle, Parthiv goes back and pulls over square leg. Bothered only about clearing square leg and left the rest to the outfield. Clever batting"
"full down leg, wide called. KKR losing the plot, Suryakumar under pressure."
"oh shot. Rohit just looks at home here. Good length outside off, Rohit laces a punchy drive into the covers for four."
"full on middle and leg, pushed towards midwicket and calls for the run immediately"
"ugly but clears the infield. Good length on off, Parthiv comes down and goes for a swipe but the ball skews off the outside half, over point for a couple. Russell does the cleaning up"
"tight lines on off, steered down to third man"
"awful delivery, down leg. Rohit gets bat on it - past short fine leg - four - easy."
decent end but the damage has been done in that over. Full on middle and worked to midwicket
"very flat down leg, Parthiv fails to get bat on the pull, but he does get a wide"
"slow on middle, cleverly pushed to mid-on for one"
"flat but leg side-ish, tucked to wide square leg for one"
"tossed up on off, driven back to the bowler. Good pace that. Not much Parthiv could do with that"
"wrong 'un on off, Parthiv shaped for the cut and went back, but found third man"
"is that out? Parthiv is walking back. Flight on middle, Parthiv comes down and pushes the ball towards short mid-on and unbelievably calls Rohit for the run. Rohit is having none of it. Hogg sprints across, picks up, returns the throw to Uthappa who whips off the bails to find Parthiv well short. Because he was a few feet down the track already, Parthiv may have thought a run was on but it certainly wasn't."
the googly to finish. Pandya picked it off the pitch and kept it out. No wickets for Hogg but a wicket by Hogg.
"Piyush starts with some flight outside off, driven down to long-off"
"flat on middle, put into the gap at wide long-on, but the fielder is quick on it to prevent the second"

"flat on middle and off, pushed to midwicket"
"a flatter delivery outside off, from back of the hand. Not much turn, may have been the googly. Rohit is beaten on the inside edge after attempting a flaying drive"
"worked away into the leg side, to midwicket"
"flat on off, pushed back."
"nice delivery, a bit of flight outside off, pushed to cover for one"
"flat on leg, worked to square leg, easy pickings"

drags that length back on leg and Rohit tucks to deep midwicket
"nice over from Kuldeep, Pandya nudges to midwicket with soft hands and pulls Rohit back for the second."

"flat on off, a thick inside edge from Rohit onto his pad"
"good use of the feet from Rohit, shuffles down to meet the ball as it pitched, the googly took the inside half of the bat back to Piyush, who fumbles to allow the run"
"very full, almost a yorker and Pandya drills it to long-on"
"very full again outside off, too full for Rohit's sweep, goes through. Good take by Robbie U"
"flat outside off, clobbered down to long-on."

"slow through the air on middle and leg, pushed back"
"what has happened there? Slow through the air again on middle, pushed to long-on in the air but the throw is quick on the bounce to the keeper. Rohit looks back to see a hard, white object and ducks out of the way very alte. IUthappa surprised by that late duck is also beaten. And four overthrows."
"gone, Pandya holes out to long-off. Some flight from Chawla, and Pandya sits in his crease, and tries to muscle one down the ground. The ball skews off the outside half to long-off, who juggles but takes it eventually"
"flat on middle and leg, worked to square leg"
"flat outside off, MM shuffles across and goes for a big swipe. Straight to midwicket"
"that's why he has been sent out. Backs away and lofts it over long-off. Not a bad delivery at all, wideish outside off"
"six more. Suryakumar at long-off should have taken it, instead he concedes six. Short outside off, MM belts it down the ground to long-off, Suryakumar is well inside the boundary and lets the ball burst through the hands."
slogged to deep midwicket.
"six more. Gambhir is flabbergasted. Flight on middle and leg, McClenaghan backs away and slog-sweeps it over midwicket. Yikes."

"googly on off, thick outside edge to short third man"
"flat and fast outside off, very quick. <b>McClenaghan misses</b>."
"gone, McClenghan has carried out his duty and is walking back. Very high full toss outside off, would have been wide had he ignored it. But instead he goes after it and mis-times to cover. Munro takes the catch."
"googly on off, Rohit calmly pats it to short third man"
"good length on off, Buttler punches to the sweeper cover"
"fullish length on off, tight lines. Rohit stays in the crease to push to cover. Could that move have stalled Rohit's momentum?"

short and slow outside off. Rohit fails to get bat on his cut.

"full on middle, squeezed to deep midwicket for a couple. Buttler not quite getting that off the middle."
"dropped. Won't be surprised if Hastings has done some damage to his finger. Slower delivery on middle, Buttler backs away, picks the variation and blugdeons it back to Hastings who can't hold on. Very hard chance but KKR needed that desperately"

"yorker outside off from around the wicket, Rohit clears one foot and steers the ball to deep point"
