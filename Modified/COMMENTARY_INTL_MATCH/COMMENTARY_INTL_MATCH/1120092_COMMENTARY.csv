"a touch of seam movement as Southee hits the deck and makes it hold its line. With the length being short though, Rohit is able to cover for it as he blocks in front of point"
"times the backfoot push sweetly past the right of point. Southee continues jagging the ball away from the right-hander, hitting into the wicket"
"probes a fuller length to the left-hander though - right up against his toes - and Dhawan whips it away to long leg. Sensational timing, just as he starts to overbalance."
"carves a back of a length delivery to point, where Guptill dives to his right and parries the ball to cover point, Mitchell Santner"
"goes wide of the crease, and continues bowling short. This time, however, he gifts width to the batsman and Rohit lashes it over point. Does so love the opportunity to free his arms."
"dangles it out there, well outside off, and though the batsman doesn't bother with it, the umpire penalises him for it"
"fuller delivery outside off, Rohit ignores it again"
"pitches it up on off stump and gets it to dart away, Dhawan plays it as late as he can and blocks as close to the body as he can too"
"flowing drive to the right of mid-off, and Williamson, having positioned himself wider than usual, dives to stop the boundary"
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
"cramps him with a shortish delivery at his hips, Dhawan knocks it away to short midwicket"
su-weeeet timing! And it's the result of his reading both the length and the line of the ball early - short and a shade outside off - but playing the shot very very late. A cut which races through the gap behind point
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go"
"much better from Southee, as he combines the movement he's getting away from the right-hander with a good length ball on off stump. That makes Rohit play a tentative block and the outside edge runs down to gully"
"lovely bowling again - from wide of the crease, he angles the length ball in towards the fifth stump and makes it hold its line. Rohit, wary of the threat, leaves"
"brings him forward outside off, but considerate of the swing Southee is getting, Rohit stays cautious and keeps his bat away from the ball"
"shifts as far wide of the crease as possible for a shortish delivery on off stump, slices it past gully's right"
"<b>late swing into the left-hander</b> and Dhawan, by virtue of not having a long stride, is able to angle his front foot away for the bat to flick the ball to square leg"
"full face of the bat to handle the inswinger aimed at middle and leg stump. New Zealand's new ball bowlers are making it swing, but how long will it last?"
"turns it off his hips to long leg, quite straightforward"
"loses patience as he wafts at a good length ball outside off. It hits the deck, nips away, enjoys a bit of extra bounce and <b>beats the bat</b>"
"nice and tight on middle, Dhawan knocks it down"
"shifts a touch wide of the crease to angle the good length ball into the left-hander, perhaps to tempt him into closing the face of the bat and therefore get a leading edge with the way he is making it straighten. No such luck with Dhawan presenting the straight face"
dangles the wide one and Dhawan chases after it - except his front foot didn't get the memo. Went down the pitch rather than across for the drive through the off side to work
"it's wide again, except the length is short and Dhawan can simply stand and thump it through cover. Didn't really test the batsman with that ball"
"keeps searching for the outside edge, a good length ball on fourth stump, armed with just enough away movement as well. Rohit does well to ignore the tempter"
"seeing a shorter delivery outside off, he shifts back and punches to cover point"
"lures him into the drive outside off, with Rohit walking into the shot, suggesting his weight was on the back foot, while handling a full delivery shaping away late. The ball skews away, in the air for a little distance, towards point"
"upper cut, and away it sails! Rohit spots the short ball very early, and with it being outside off, he wisely helps the ball to the third man boundary"
"bowling short to Rohit isn't really a sensible plan. He's ready and waiting for it, getting across on off stump considering this one is angled into his body and pulls it down to long leg"
"pitches it up on middle and leg, getting the ball to swing into Dhawan, who then flicks it to midwicket"
"sticks the bat in front of pad so that he can nudge a fuller delivery, darting into him, to mid-on. Takes extra care to keep the face straight"
"just short of a good length on off stump, Dhawan taps it to point"
"picks the gap through extra cover, and looks regal doing it! Shimmies down the pitch, gets a length ball that allows him to free the arms and he does so with great panache"
slips down the leg side
"last-second shape into the left-hander, which means his attempted drive through extra cover skews off the closed face to mid-off"
on the pads and he works it away to long leg
"defends a fuller delivery on off stump, making sure to play close to the body"
"taken at mid-off! This pitch is truly, properly hard, and the good length ball bounces a lot more than Dhawan anticipates. He attempts a repeat of the drive he played in the last over, only this time he wants to go over mid-off rather than past his right. But those plans are ruined because Southee is able to extract a tiny bit more off the deck. Good stuff"
covers the stumps against a fuller delivery and blocks it
angled into the pads and Kohli ever so easily nudges it to midwicket. Wouldn't be surprised if he yawned after that shot
"treats a perfectly good ball in utterly disgraceful fashion and it hurries away to the midwicket boundary to cry. This is lined up with top of off stump, where coaches tell fast bowlers to aim at. Except Kohli shuffles a long way across, keeps his balance, and whips the ball away with nonchalance"
blocks a good length ball outside off
"full and outside off, lets it go"
"fuller delivery angled across the right-hander, Rohit holds himself back"
"good length ball on off stump, Rohit blocks"
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
"full on middle, Rohit presents the full face and the ball goes to mid-on"
"picks the gap, and to do so, he shifts back in his crease, lets the shortish delivery come on, gets on top of the bounce and nails the gap between point and cover"
"gorgeous! While there wasn't much wrong with the previous ball, this is a half-volley on leg stump, but Rohit fell to this ball in the last game, playing across the line. This time though, he targets the gap to the left of mid-on and profits richly"
"through the covers! It should be bizarre that he can control this shot when the ball is so wide outside off. But Kohli's trigger movement today is helping him do so with ease. Moving across outside off, so that he is closer to the teasers, and so he can play with a straight bat"
"good length ball outside off, lets it go"
"shortish delivery outside off, Kohli runs it down to third man"
"on the pads, Rohit waits on it well and glances it down to long leg"
"fuller delivery outside off, Kohli gets forward to block"
covers the line of a good length ball on off stump
shifts back against a short of a length ball outside off and punches it to cover
"it seems like the fastest bowler on the day is making the ball hold up in the pitch. Rohit actually benefits from that, playing the ball gently and pinching a run to cover"
"fuller delivery outside off, Kohli drills it to the right of cover"
"that's monstrous! Another ball that really doesn't deserve this quality of treatment - if anything it is only a shade short. And Rohit pulls it off the front foot, sending it soaring over midwicket. Absolutely brilliant, which is roughly what Kohli's facial expression translates into as he goes 'whoaaa'"
"the fast bowler comes back with a bouncer at 136 kph, getting up a lot higher. But the thing that beats Rohit is the lack of pace. He's through the pull too soon and is hit on the back"
"good length ball on off stump, which Rohit hurries to meet with a straight bat. Wonder if that kept a bit low"
"targets top of off stump, Kohli doesn't let it go that far"
shuffles across to meet a shortish delivery on off stump and clips it to long leg
"<b>nearly knocks the ball onto his stumps</b>. Very late movement off the pitch into the right-hander makes Rohit block with as soft hands as possible, but that in turn means the ball almost rolls back towards his sticks. Does well to remain alert to that threat and prevent it from coming to pass"
"shortish and outside off, glides it behind point"
"and again, a ball on off stump is picked away to deep square leg"
swivels on the back foot to pull the short ball on middle and off to long leg
"back of a length and outside off, Rohit doesn't care for it"
rises with the short delivery outside off at 135 kph and guides it to the right of point. Guptill does well to catch up with it
"takes a shortish delivery from outside off and pulls it down to deep square leg, playing the shot like the West Indians of old, with his front foot raised"
there's a gully in place to stop Kohli from guiding back of a length deliveries outside off to third man
"back of a length and outside off, blocks"
"taps a shortish delivery outside off in front of point and sets off for the single. Neither man is entirely committed to it, giving New Zealand an opportunity, but the throw to the non-stirkers' end is wide"
"shortish on off stump, Kohli whips it to deep square leg"
"pulls the slow, short ball from outside off to deep square leg, controlling the bat swing so that the ball goes down"
"soft hands, angled face and the back of a length delivery aiming to cramp the batsman becomes a single to third man"
"he goes off-line as the ball wanders a fair bit down leg, and with his standard length being short, Rohit has an easy pull. Tom Bruce on the long leg boundary picks up the ball very late and it goes past him to his right"
nudges it behind square leg
clips a shortish delivery from off stump through square leg
"tosses it up on off stump, Kohli gets to the pitch and works it to midwicket"
"plants the fuller delivery on off stump, Kohli drives to long-off"
blocks a flighted delivery on off stump
"goes wide of the crease to angle the fuller delivery into the right-hander, but Rohit is ready and waiting. Plays a lap sweep quite deftly and places it to the left of the short fine leg"
"pulls his length back, ratchets his pace up, angles the ball on off stump. Rohit blocks"
backs away and slaps a short delivery behind point. Brilliant footwork - because that ball was a fair bit quicker than usual - and then his gift of timing takes over
punches a short delivery outside off through extra cover
steps forward to block a good length ball outside off
opens the face and runs the back of a length delivery down to third man
"full, and a fair bit slow, on off stump. Rohit turns it to midwicket"
"shortish and outside off, chops it to point"
"shortish and outside off, slices it to deep third man"
"<b>beats him</B>, and then launches an lbw appeal! Being slow through the air has its advantages, and one of them is the extra revs on the ball, allowing it to dip sharply on Rohit, grip on the pitch, turn past the closing face of the bat and pin him high on the thigh"
"flatter in trajectory, but of a good length. Rohit is drawn forward, his hands pushing hard and away from his body. The block pops up and nearly carries to the bowler"
ease the ball to long-off
steps inside the line to drive the tossed up delivery through cover
"pushes to cover, where the fielder does well to prevent the run"
"loopy delivery outside off, Rohit gets himself beside it so he can lash it to sweeper cover"
"walks at the medium-pacer, who shortens his length and gets the ball to hold on the pitch. As a result, Kohli's push to long-on goes in the air for a distance"
"spots the ball to be coming in on off stump, so he waits there, armed with the angled bat and takes the single to third man"
whips a fuller delivery on off stump to deep midwicket. He really shouldn't be able to play across the line with such ease
"slaps a short and wide delivery to the left of point, looking for the boundary, but Guptill prevents that. So Rohit settles for the single that gives him <b>a fifty</b> off only 52 balls"
"fuller delivery outside off, drives to the left of mid-off"
"full and outside off, taps it to long-on to retain strike."
"<b>confusion first ball!</b> Pushed towards point and Kohli takes off for the single, Rohit shouts 'no!' and Kohli scampers back"

"tucked off his hips from top of middle towards midwicket, easy single"
goes deep into the crease and worked off his pads to the sweeper-fielder on the leg side

"driven back to the bowler, good length just outside off"
"good length outside off, he walks towards the delivery and punches off the back foot to the deep"
"gets his body behind the line of the delivery, and punches down the ground to long on. Full and just outside off, and easily handled by Kohli"
"spongy bounce this time, good length on middle and Rohit uses his soft hands to push the ball towards the leg side"
"<b>Wristy!</b> Short on middle and off, and Rohit swivels off one foot. Pulled over the square leg umpire's head and the sweeper - who is slightly square - can't cut it off"
"adjusts and drives to long off, full on leg stump and Rohit charges down and goes towards the leg side before playing that shot"
"tucked to short fine leg, good length on middle and played off the back foot"
"drifts onto the leg stump, Kohli goes towards the leg side, getting his front foot out of the way, and drives down the ground"

"cut square from outside off, slightly full and uses the bat's open face to drill the ball past the two infielders square on the off side"
"<b>In the air!</b> But just past Santner's outstretched left hand. Tossed up on middle and off and Rohit drives, hits the bat slightly higher that he would've liked and it goes just past the bowler's hand"
"back of a length just on off stump, punched down the ground off the back foot. Came inside the line of the ball before playing the shot"
"defended off the back foot by Rohit, good length on the fourth-stump line, no room to free his arms"
"good length outside off, the ball comes into the batsman after pitching, plays the late cut but the ball was too close to his body, plays it from near his pads eventually"
"driven off the front foot past point's right, the hand came off the bat and therefore slightly in the air"
"good length outside off, driven to cover off the back foot"
"up and over cover! The over goes for more than six. Pitched up just outside off and Rohit was quick to get onto the front foot. Full swing of the bat, and it's timed well"
"driven to long off, gives Rohit the strike again, gets forward and taps the ball"
hit straight back to Santner. Not allowing the batsman to get any room
"played with soft hands, opens the bat's face towards point and calls early for the quick single"

"big stride forward and driven to long off, full on middle and off and Kohli offers the bat's full face"
"hurries Rohit, skids through after pitching on middle, punched back to Santner off the back foot"
"Beautifully timed. Gave the ball a slight push but he makes the connection so well that it goes past the diving midwicket fielder for four, good length on off but Kohli extends his hands, and lets the timing do the rest"
"punched straight to the diving cover fielder. Full just outside off, and hit well to the fielder"
"short and wide outside off, pokes at it, playing the ball from head high towards third man"
"glances the ball towards third man again, opens the bat's face. It was fullish outside off"

"overpitched on middle, Milne uses the width of the crease to get the ball into the stumps from the wide angle, driven back to him off the front foot"
"played late off the back foot to third man, allows the ball to come towards him and into the stumps before helping it along its way"
"pitched short on middle but the batsman is quick to adjust to the line, shuffles towards the off side and pulls along the ground fine down the leg side, not the best contact with the bat"
"good length just on off stump, defended off the front foot. Displays the bat's full face"
"straight to point, good length just outside off and he tries the deft cut, but can't play it fine enough. Waited for the ball to come to him"
"Sends Kohli ducking! Pitched in short just outside off, and the batsman is quick to get out of the way"
"can't time the punch off the front foot. Boult picks it up on his followthrough. Good length on off stump and Kohli got inside the line of the ball, but no power"
"pulled furiously along the gross to deep midwicket, short on middle but  doesn't rise on him as much this time"
"sticks with the short ball, but <b>wide</b> reckons the umpire. Second short ball of the over, good length on middle but the left hander's angle takes the ball away from him. And ofcourse, goes over the batsman's head"
"driven to mid off and calls loudly for a quick single, easy in the end"
raises his front foot and allows the ball to come to him. Rohit then paddles the ball off his hips to deep midwicket for an easy run
"wide outside off and punched off the back foot with perfection! Slightly short and Rohit plays it late square. Guptill at point dives, but can't stop that. Plays that while standing up on his toes"
"glanced to third man, waits for the ball to come once again"

"<b>Kohli sends Rohit back!</b> Driven off the back foot to cover and Rohit was interested in the run, and took a few steps down the pitch as well but Kohli refuses. Has Rohit racing back, and does well. The keeper was far away from the stumps too"
"tapped down the ground to long off, good length just outside off and played with ease back past the bowler"
"checks his cut shot this time, not the full swing of the bat. The delivery was a good length outside off"
"driven away from his body this time, past the two infielders and straight to the fielder in the deep"
"short third man stops the single. Plays the late cut behind square, but the fielder is alert. Races to his left and ensures the single is stopped"

"tapped past the bowler once again for a single, not much pace to work with and Kohli will keep the strike"

"good length on middle, Santner may have seen Rohit charging and he pitches it slightly shorter, bat-pad"

"pulls the length back this time, good length just on off stump, and punched off the back foot"

"almost an offcutter this time, shortish outside off, and comes in after pitching, glanced towards point"
"good length just outside off, angles into Kohli but he checks his shot. Worked away towards midwicket"
"overpitched outside off and Kohli drives this away from his body. Struck well, and hits the bat's sweet spot as well. Short cover dives to his right, but once it is past him, the chasing Williamson had no chance"
"punched down the ground to mid off, walks down the pitch and makes the contact"
"driven straight past the stumps for an exquisite four. There was mid on, but goes past his left, and runs away to the boundary."

"tiptoes and tucks it off his hips behind square for a single, shortish on middle"

"covers the ball's line which is pitched just outside off, and flicks it off his pads to the deep on the leg side"
"paddled away square on the leg side, goes past the square-leg umpire's right. Raises his front foot, and eases into the shot for some more runs"

easily pulled over midwicket for a boundary. Slightly short and comes into Rohit's body. Got into position early and lifts it over the infield
"punched off the back foot in front of square, the fielder in the deep has to race to his right to stop the boundary. What an exquisite shot this was as well"
"deftly played to third man, waits for the ball to come to him, before helping the ball along its way"
"good length on off stump, opens the bat's face and the ball pings away towards point"
"slightly cramped for room this time Virat, but still enough to play the late cut to third man"
"went for the extravagant drive, and misses it completely! Quicker one to start off, and Kohli is foxed. Latham is quick to displace the bails, but Kohli was back"
"<b>Did that carry? Is that out!</b> Nope, just falls in front of the diving bowler. Spongy bounce and it hits the higher end of Kohli's bat. Goes in the air, and CDG dives foward, but falls just in front before it went into his hands"

"punched off the back foot to mid off, good length on off stump"
worked off his legs past the square-leg umpire for a run
"wide yorker outside off, squeezed away past point's right for a single. <b>And that's drinks.</b>"
"<b>nicks it past the keeper</b>! Kohli and Rohit are having fun out there, and even luck wants to join their party. This is a lovely ball, angling across the right-hander, moving away as well. Kohli tries to flat-bat it over mid-off, but only gets a thick edge. Valiant attempt from Latham, to no avail"
"back of a length and outside off, glides it towards backward point"
"reaches out in front of his body, so that he can meet the dipping full toss and crash it over mid-off"
"short and down leg, Rohit pulls it to fine leg"
"ka-pow! See, this is what India were holding up their sleeves. The knowledge that this is a flat pitch, and if they last long enough they could tire New Zealand out. Boult offers length and Rohit races down the pitch to smack it over cover"
pulls the short ball on leg stump to the long leg boundary. <b>Seventeen runs off the over</b>
"good length ball outside off, blocks"
"pummels it over mid-off! Oh, it's go time. It is hit everything out of the park time. And de Grandhomme obliges with a wide half-volley that Kohli duly hammers"
"pulls the length back, Kohli nudges it off middle stump through midwicket"
can't keep pitching it up outside off when there is no protection on the off side boundary. All Rohit has to do is get under the ball and lift it over the infield
"slower short ball, which Rohit doesn't really pick, but is still able to adjust and pull to deep square leg"
"what a shot! He actually lets the ball dawdle past the stumps, and just as it is set to go into the keeper's gloves, he chops his bat down on it. Why does he toy with the ball like that? To make sure it beats short third man to his right. <b>That's 9000 ODI runs for Kohli, the fastest to the mark</b>"
"low full toss outside off, he drives to short cover"
cuts a quicker delivery off the stumps to the sweeper
"pushes it through on off stump, defends"
"fuller delivery on leg stump, keeps it out"
"quicker delivery on middle and leg, Rohit stands tall and punches it to long-on"
"predicts the line to be on leg stump, and he's out of his crease, ready to smash it over the long-off boundary. A line meant to cramp the batsman is yielding sixes. This is high-class one-day batting."
"good length ball on leg stump, works it through midwicket"
whips the ball on the pads to deep square leg
"the pitched-up delivery outside off is not working when Williamson insists on staying inside the circle at mid-off. There is a desperate dive from the New Zealand captain, but to little effect"
"fuller delivery on off stump, defends"
"tries to slice it behind point, but the lack of pace means he hits the fielder"
"on the pads, Rohit works it to deep midwicket"
swivels on the back foot to pull a short ball wading down leg stump. Single to long leg
"looks for the yorker, comes out a low full toss, Kohli clips it to mid-on"
"slower bouncer, which Rohit persuades to go from outside off stump to deep midwicket"
works a back of a length delivery on middle to deep square leg
"they keep bowling wide outside off without any protection, and Rohit keeps pulverising them for it. For what it's worth, Southee tries a slower ball. Rohit though is able to pick it early, waits until it arrives and then lashes it over mid-off"
"short and outside off, Rohit taps it to sweeper cover"
full on off stump - taking all the pace off it - Rohit works it to long-on
"stands up tall and drills the ball to cover. Rohit thinks there is a single, but Santner moves quickly to his left, and had his throw hit the stumps, Rohit would have been out"
"back of a length and outside off, hacks it to midwicket"
"full toss, which is sliced to the left of cover. Santner half stops it, but the hand he gets to the ball actually helps India get two"
"pulls the length back, draws the pace off, and Rohit, aiming for a big shot, has to adjust and tap it to backward point"
"low full toss on off stump, Rohit scythes it to the sweeper to keep strike. He's five shy of 150, and then has nine overs to go for a mind-boggling <i>third double-hundred</i>"
"whips a shortish delivery on off stump to the right of long-on. Lovely batting. Opens the hips for power and placement, keeps the head still and right over the ball for balance"
"taken at long-off! Rohit walks off with his head thrown up at the sky, he's wondering if he's left a few runs out there, but he goes back with 147 to his name and the entire Kanpur crowd chanting his name. What an innings. A fifth century in the year, and it ends with perhaps one of his only miscues which sends a tossed up delivery outside off to Southee's hands"
"good length, on off stump, and importantly, quick enough that Pandya can't power it away. Block through point"
"flatter delivery on off stump, pushes to long-on"
"finds the blockhole on leg stump, and the cramped Pandya, drills it to long-on"
"beautiful cricket. He leans over the fuller delivery on middle, clips it gently enough and places it perfectly in the unmanned area between long-on and deep midwicket"
"loads up the hook shot, but the 142 kph bouncer goes off the toe of the bat past the keeper"
"good length ball outside off at 138 kph, Kohli pushes it to cover"
glides it to third man
"stays legside of the ball, and purposefully hoists the ball over backward point, knowing third man is very very fine on the boundary. Excellent batting"
"full on off stump, Pandya drives to long-on"
"shapes to punch it through cover, but he's there before the ball, and so it goes off the inside edge behind square leg. Retains strike, on 99"
a simple tap through the covers gets him to his <b>32nd ODI hundred</b>. He's already second on the list of all-time centurions. And he's gaining on the record-holder.
"taken at long-off! Good bowling from Santner, firing the ball in at middle, Pandya has to launch it. He has no other choice. Mistimes the shot, gets too much height, and Southee does well to track it down"
"gets down the pitch, but Santner doesn't allow Kohli the length he wants. Nor the pace. It's a slow, short ball on leg stump and the batsman nearly pops a return catch"
steers it to third man
"goes back to a fuller delivery and tries to flick it across the line. Gets struck on the pad, but the lbw appeal is wasted because the ball would have slid down"
"down the track to turn a good length delivery past short midwicket. And for the third time in a row, Santner, a fingerspinner, finishes his spell giving away less than run-a-ball."
"legcutter, with enough width to be slapped to deep point"
"effortless little whip over midwicket. It is only in this stage of the innings that Kohli indulges in such shots, taking a length ball on middle and sending it soaring out to the boundary rider"
"presses forward, looking for the ball, but once it is short, he shifts his weight back and pulls it down to deep square leg"
"it's short, and Dhoni rocks back to pull it behind square leg. Spots the length very early. And usually, when Dhoni is troubled by a fast bowler, it's when it rises up above his waist"
"slower ball, sliding down leg, Dhoni tries to flick but doesn't make contact. Milne thinks he's got away wide, but as he he is halfway back to his mark, the umpire makes the signal"
"short and outside off, slaps it to deep cover"
"<b>massive grunt of frustration from Kohli</b> as he is unable to pick up the slower short ball early enough. Sets up for the front foot, short arm pull. But the ball, being off pace, takes the bottom edge through to the keeper"
"looks for the yorker from around the wicket and Dhoni bunts it down to long-off. He's fresh enough to do so, and Kohli's fit enough to answer"
"full toss outside off, Dhoni taps it to the right of the sweeper, looking for a second again, but Santner is alert to that and cuts the angle very well."
"another slower ball, which Kohli basically inside edges to long-on. Gets into the slog too early and has to settle for a couple"
"swings a near-yoker from outside off out to deep midwicket, and Kohli is so well conditioned that he can once again get back for the second. Does need a few seconds to catch his breath after the fact"
opens the face to squeeze the yorker outside off to deep third man
"tries to line the yorker right up against the wide line, but umpire Chaudhary says that's too far"
"looks for the yorker, a lot closer to the sticks this time, Dhoni pushes it to long-on, Kohli looks for the second, but it's not on. <b>Ten runs off the over, and it's one without a boundary</b>"
skips down the track to miscue a slightly slower delivery on off stump to long-off
"takes the pace off again, planting the ball wide outside off stump, and well away from Dhoni's reach. The batsman tries to get to it, but only slices it to short third man"
"heaves it over straight midwicket, brings up the 300. Back of a length and outside off, Kohli swings it away right over a man inside the circle"
"taken at long-off! Southee profiting with the slower delivery again, this one comes off the back of the hand, asking Kohli to make all the pace himself. He tries to lift it, perhaps wider of the man on the boundary. But in the end, it carries straight down Williamson's throat"
"wide of long-on! The moment there's pace on the ball, it disappears. This is simply power from Dhoni. Front foot down the pitch and bat swinging right across the line"
"legcutter, on the pads, clips it off the pads and Dhoni collects a leg bye"
"yorker outside off, Dhoni digs it out to long-off. He's racing down the wicket for a second run, but Jadhav says no, and then he's not able to capitalise on the misfield"
walks across outside off and sweeps the fast bowler to deep midwicket
full toss - length gone wrong while looking for a yorker - Dhoni slogs to long-on
"goes over the wicket for Jadhav - and the yorker, meant to be out of reach of the batsman, becomes a full toss. And with Jadhav moving back in his crease and towards off stump, he can lash it away behind point"
around the wicket now as he cuts a back of a length delivery outside off to the sweeper cover
"picks the gap between point and a square third man. Beautiful shot, calculated and clean. Dhoni knows the length is going to be close to the blockhole. He waits for it, gets low with the ball, opens the face of the ball and spears it away. And funnily enough, he's asking for a new bat"
"spots the batsman charging and so bowls quick, short and at the body. Jadhav gets hit, instead of the other way around"
"reads the slower ball well, waits on it to arrive and then pastes it down the ground. Long-on runs to his left to intervene"
"backs away, but Southee follows him with a short ball. With it being slow as well, Jadhav is able to pull to midwicket"
pulls the 106 kph short ball on middle to deep square leg
legcutter goes up in the air and beats the two men chasing after it. Williamson running back from cover and de Grandhomme running forwards from mid-off and the ball lands beyond their reach
"it's impossible that he can connect with the ball that well when he looks essentially beaten by the height on this boundary. Jadhav hares down the pitch, Southee bowls the bouncer and it is pulled in fairly awkward fashion, but somehow it soars over the square leg boundary."
"caught at short third man. Milne joins his team-mates in taking all the pace off the ball. It's actually a legbreak, which Dhoni flat-bats, gets an outside edge and skews it to Munro"
"slower short ball, Jadhav pulls it to long leg"
sends it to long-on
legcutter goes wrong and he's penalised for the ball darting way past the wide line outside off
"full on off stump,  Karthik skews it over mid-off - just over with Williamson running to his right and leaping to try and catch the ball"
"yorker on off stump, Karthik gets a single to short third man"
"caught at long-on! It's a slow short ball outside off, Jadhav pulls it hard, but with there being no pace to work with, and these being decent-sized boundaries, he is taken by Guptill"
"defended off the back foot, good length just outside off and Guptill goes deep into his crease and knocks this back"
"hits the shoulder of the bat and goes down to third man, good length outside off and extra bounce on offer. Surprises Guptill slightly"
<b>Punished!</b> Dispatches the first ball he faces over deep midwicket for a six. Walks down the pitch and slaps the incoming ball over the leg side for the innings' first boundary
"slashed outside off and another boundary, angling away from the left-hander's body and he cuts the ball furiously. Goes past point, and third man has no chance either"
"full just outside off, driven down the ground and that's his third boundary. Not timed as well, but enough muscle in that shot. Goes past mid off, who does not bother moving"
"oh my, my. Four overthrows to end the over. Punched to Kohli - at cover - who decides to take a shot at the stumps. He misses and Rohit can't back up in time. Additional runs to end the over. Sheepish smile from the captain, but Bhuvneshwar is not impressed"
"Bumrah starts off well, good length just outside off, defended off the back foot"
"takes the outside edge, but goes along the ground to third man. Guptill looks to defend from top of off stump, but the bat's open face takes it behind square"
"bounces him! Short and slightly wide outside off, the carry through to Dhoni is promising"
"<b>Hammered!</b> Shortish outside off and Munro charges down the wicket, slapped over the bowler's head and no stopping that. Not as well timed, came off the bat's top half, but hey, it got the job done"
"charges down once again, but can't get this away, good length outside off and worked off his hips"
"takes the leading edge, but falls well short of cover. Good length on middle and he tried to work this towards the leg side, but the ball goes in the opposite direction. Slowed things down, the bowler, for the final ball"
"carved square on the up, back of a length delivery outside off and Guptill cuts from near his body. Just past point's left"
"Munro walks down the wicket and tries to pull square, but the ball goes underneath his bat. It was pushed wide outside off, and the batsman can't make contact"
"drifts down the leg side, good length on middle but the angle takes the ball past Munro's attempted pull"
"driven to mid on for a quick single, punched off the full-length delivery"
"threads the needle! Stays on his back foot, and punches this on the up with the bat's open face. Rohit dives at point, but goes just past him. Three infielders inside the circle on the off side, mind you"
"short on middle, the square leg umpire reckons it's a wide"
"short again, on middle stump, sends Guptill ducking. Well directed this time"
"Defended off the back foot towards point, it's a good length ball just outside off and Guptill sees the over through"
"full outside off, punched back to Bumrah off the front foot"
"driven along the ground to wide-ish mid on for a quick single, full on his toes on middle"
"good length on off stump, angles into his pads, and smacks his thigh pad. Lobs up towards the point-fielding racing in and he holds onto it. <b>Bumrah appeals</b> for something, the umpire says no."
"good length on middle, bunted towards midwicket on the leg side"
"almost a yorker on middle and leg, dug away well by Guptill, who had to adjust from his big back-lift to squeeze the ball back"
"slower ball to end the over, rolls his fingers through his delivery, defended from near his body off the back foot"
"short on middle and Munro charges away, misses the pull and Munro tries to duck, and as he tries to protect his face with the bat, it smacks him near his glove. Reckon the bowler wins that battle"
"pitched in short on off stump, Munro tries to pull but the ball goes over his head"
"more short stuff, Munro backs away and Bhuvneshwar follows him, angles into Munro and cramps him for room. Tries to play the ramp over Dhoni, but misses"
"short once again, Munro tries to hook this down the leg side, but goes past him. Dhoni is interested in a caught-behind, but the umpire calls it a wide"
"full on middle this time, Munro comes inside the line of the delivery and displays the bat's full face"
"another wide, Munro shuffles towards the off side when Bhuvneshwar releases the ball, slides down the leg side."
"another knuckleball, good length just outside off and angles into Munro's body, worked off his hips past midwicket for a single"
"goes past the diving cover-fielder! Punched off the back foot, and Axar - from mid off - races behind it, and throws it at the non-striker's end. Guptill is in, and therefore Kohli is quick to throw this to Dhoni, but the keeper can't collect"
"the ramp comes off eventually, Bhuvneshwar decides to go short for the final ball and Munro backs away and sends this over short third man's head for a four. Phew, that was a marathon over"
"<b>Well taken by DK!</b> And that's Bumrah's <b>50th ODI wicket.</b> Good length on off and Guptill tries to lift this over mid off, not enough power in that, and Karthik races back, gets under the ball, and makes no mistake. That's the first breakthrough"
"full on middle, driven back to the bowler"

"good length on off stump, tapped off his hips towards the leg side"
"good length outside off stump, drives this towards point. Protection there"
"yorker to end the over, squeezed away and calls early for the one. Dhawan has a shy at the stumps, but hits the non-striker's body instead"
"short and wide outside off, and KW brings out a crunching square cut. Enough width to free his arms. Races past point"
"the length forces Williamson to go back, defended off the back foot. Pitched just outside off"
"wide outside off, but can't get the contact on his drive this time. Dribbles away to Kohli at cover"
"good length just outside off, punched off the back foot to mid on"
"good length outside off, opens the bat's face and runs this past point's left for a single"
"slower ball to end the over, pitches full on middle stump, bunted back to Bhuvi. Minimal movement of the feet"
"shortish to start off, drifting onto his pads and punches it past Rohit - at midwicket - to start off another spell with a boundary"
"good length just on middle and off, tiptoes and works this off his pads towards midwicket"
"full on middle and leg, too easy for Williamson. Pandya isn't bowling according to his off-side heavy field, and the NZ captain simples pushes this towards the leg side off his pads"
"tapped off his pads behind square on the leg side. Not as much power off the bat this time, but still enough in it to allow the batsmen to run two"
"good length on off, punched off the back foot towards the bowler"
"drifts onto his pads once again, but this time there's a sweeper-fielder on the leg side for the flick off his pads. Only a single this time"
"tapped to wide-ish mid on for a single, and calls early for the run. <b>The throw breaks the stumps</b> but Williamson was well home"
<b>Slapped!</b> Full-ish on middle and it's a carbon-copy of that first shot of the innings. Flicked furiously over  midwicket's head and it's another maximum
"good length way outside leg stump this time, Munro walks to the leg side as well, thereby craming himself. Inside edge towards the leg side"

"full on middle, punched down the ground, and goes almost past the non-striker, but the diving Axar stops it well"

"Axar around the wicket, slapped on the full to a wide mid off"
"full on leg stump, Munro can't whip this away, hits his pad"
"misses the sweep this time, but the ball dribbles away towards short third man for leg byes. Axar fooled Munro with that delivery, but struck him on the pads way outside the stump's line"
Carved behind point for four. KW is looking good today. Big stride forward and then waits for the ball to come towards him. Dhawan has no chance
"good length on off stump, punched off the back foot towards cover"
"an inside-out straight drive! Pitched full on leg, and Munro charging down plays against the turn down the ground and past mid off for four more to end the over. Expensive over from Axar"
"good length on middle, punched off the back foot"
"delivers the ball from in front of middle stump but the ball drifts away towards the off side, the batsman does well to get behind the line of the ball and defends"

hits with the turn to long-off
"excellent timing! Requires a big effort from Pandya on the midwicket boundary, racing to his right to stop the boundary. A poor ball, on the pads, which Munro hits with the minimal effort"
"<b>appeal for a stumping, with Munro overbalancing</b>. Dhoni, however, isn't entirely sure. And replays confirm why. Though the batsman strays outside his crease, he ensures he returns to safety. So a gorgeous ball, remains a gorgeous ball, and not wicket-taking. Chahal had tossed it up, teasing Munro into a big hit over the covers. But then the ball dips, turns sharply and hurtles through bat and pad"
"a short ball on off stump, pulls it to square leg"

works a flighted delivery on middle to long-on
long stride forward to block a good length ball on middle

"tosses it up outside off, slashes it to extra cover"

"flatter delivery outside off, pushes it through extra cover"
"launches it over midwicket. Clean strike. For once, Jadhav gives room to the left-hander from around the wicket and the length to get under. Munro unleashes the slog sweep and it's an extremely powerful one"
gets down the track and drives through cover
"outstanding bowling! The wristspinner strikes in the middle overs. Who knew? Beautiful flight. Sexy drift. Munro rooted to the crease. Dainty shot, away from the body. It isn't even right to say his defences were broken. He didn't mount any in the first place. Beaten all ends up"

"shortish and only a shade outside off, which is why Williamson isn't able to get his cut away"
"<b>collision between Pandya and Williamson</b> but both men seem okay. Well, barring a bleeding hand for Pandy and a knock on the helmet on Williamson. It all starts with a flick to the left of midwicket, who does well to cut the angle and create a run-out chance. Would have been out had he hit the stumps direct, instead he hits Williamson. Meanwhile, Pandya, running around to back the ball up, isn't able to, and the momentum of his dive puts him on the collisoin course"
pushes to long-on
"tosses it up outside off, blocks"
stays beside the ball and slaps the length ball out to sweeper cover

"swings across the line and Chahal has the big breakthrough! He keeps getting them, and it's often in the same way. The batsman going for a big shot, trying to fetch a tossed up delivery from way outside off. Williamson top-edges the sweep and Dhoni collects the catch without too much incident - he had to sidestep the batsman to get under the ball"

"that's cheeky! He's reverse swept the ball off the back of the bat past Dhoni. He said he played his first reverse sweep in Mumbai. Pulled out his version of it in Pune. And here finds the boundary with it, making sure to send the ball fine of the man in the deep"

"Tight stuff from Bumrah at the moment, once again tight just outside off stump, Taylor can only bunt this away to Kohli at midwicket"
"<b>Goes just past Bumrah's outstretched left hand!</b> Slower ball outside off, Taylor was through his shot early, and the ball popped up in front. Bumrah tried his best, but the ball went just past his fingertips"
"back of a length on off stump, worked off his hips behind square for a quick single"
"punched back to Bhuvneshwar, shortish delivery close to Munro's body. Can't get this delivery away"
"good length on middle, tapped past mid off's right for a run. The angle of the bowler's release took the delivery away from Latham"

"back of a length on middle, tucked off his hips to a wide-ish fine leg for a single"
"full on middle, glanced down the leg side to fine leg for another single. They're keeping the scoreboard ticking"

"full and wide outside off, he backs away to drive it along the ground. Makes good contact too, but Kohli dives to his left to stop that"
"cut square past cover, goes past backward point and Karthik - in the deep - has to put in a sliding effort to stop that. The umpires want to look if DK touched the ropes...nope."
"flatter ball on middle and leg, can't paddle this fine with the bat. Hits his pad and while playing the attempted pull and dribbles away to short fine leg. Well, there's no fielder there and Dhoni races to retrieve the ball. Could've been a run out, but his throw is not directed well"

"slower ball this time, it's a good-length delivery just outside off, mistimed back to Pandya"

"back of a length on off stump, worked off his hips towards midwicket for another run"
"slapped past point for another boundary to end the over, New Zealand in contention and how! Full outside off and cut well. Three infielders on the off side, but he finds the gap. He shuffled back towards the leg side, creating the excess width"
"skids through after pitching outside off stump, cut to Dhawan in the deep"
"tossed up full outside off, turns away from the left-hander's attempted drive. Can't time it well. Straight to cover"

"<b>perfectly placed!</b> Good length on off stump and the around-the-wicket angle helps Nicholls in playing the cross-batted shot in front of square on the leg side. Dhawan - from deep midwicket - tries to stop it, but he just misses"
"<b>Goes over Dhoni's head, and it's a S-I-X!</b> Tries to scoop this over short fine, and he can't find the direction he wanted. Goes over the keeper's head instead, which despite being slightly mistimed, has gone for a maximum. Was down on one knee"

"attempted yorker on middle, finishes up as a full-pitched delivery instead. Pinged off his toes straight to fine leg"

"yorker to end the over, it was just outside off stump and it's been squeezed bast Chahal - at midwicket - for a two runs. A good comeback over from Bhuvneshwar, though"

"yorker just outside off, tries to dig this towards the leg side, but the shot hits his pad instead. The delivery goes nowhere. Gold dust"
"drilled to deep midwicket. He had no business timing that yorker so well, but connects very well"
"attempts the paddle past short fine leg, but misses the shot completely. The ball, however, was going down the leg side anyway. Premeditated from the batsman. Bumrah complains to the umpire before walking back"
"<b>Appeal for LBW!</b> Not out says the umpire, but <b>India review.</b> Full on leg or just outside leg according to the naked eye, misses the whip off his pads, and hits him on his legs. We wait for the replay: pitched clearly outside leg stump. Not out."
"glorious yorker just outside off and <b>Bumrah runs Latham out!</b> De Grandhomme missed the shot, and Dhoni noticed Latham (the non-striker) racing down the wicket. He loops the ball straight to Bumrah, who smashes the stumps with a ferocious throw. Latham is stranded in the middle of the pitch. He backed up way too much before this delivery. Pays his price"
"low full toss on middle, bunted away past midwicket"
"lifted over mid off for a single, full on off stump and muscled, but only for a single. Kohli positioned at long off"

"full and wide outside off, the batsman lets it go, and as the ball angles away towards Dhoni, everyone looks at the umpire. Is that a wide? The man who matters doesn't think so. That's the over. <b>NZ need 15 off the final over to clinch this series.</b>"
""

"yorker outside off once again, bunted down the ground to long off. Not allowing the batsman to get under the ball"
"low full toss on leg stump, clipped off his toes to fine leg. For a moment it seemed that it would run down for four, but Axar was there"
"full toss outside off stump, and the waist-high shot has been pulled away towards cow corner. <b>Is it a six? No! It's caught by Dhawan.</b> But wait, it was a really high delivery, and the umpire wants to have a look for the no ball. The front foot seems fine, and so does the height. Santner was way down the pitch. He has to go. The ball was muscled away, but came off the top half of the bat. That shot needed a better connection."
"low full toss outside off, big swing of the bat but goes one-bounce to Kohli at long off."
"it's a four, but that doesn't matter one bit! <b>India win by six runs, and the series 2-1</b>. It was full on off stump and sliced over short third man for four"
