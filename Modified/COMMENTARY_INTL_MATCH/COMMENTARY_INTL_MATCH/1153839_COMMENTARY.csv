He was a little late to turn, and was comfortably outside the crease. Taylor knew that was that, didn't even bother for the third umpire to give his verdict because he saw closely the ball touching the bowler's fingers.

Didn't have room either so is cramped, still goes through with the shot and ends up top-edging this and midwicket takes an absolute dolly."
