a bit of flight but short enough for Warner to stay back and defend

"slow through the air again, tossed up outside off. Renshaw plays the best possible stroke, a leave"
"poor delivery. Fires this down leg and Renshaw tickles this fine, past short fine leg for a boundary"

"pushed a tad wider outside off this time, Renshaw lets this one go"
"full on off, not too quick but accurate. No swing at all this morning. Renshaw stays forward and defends under his eyes"

"nice line. Flat and straight, a hint of turn. Renshaw got right forward to defend"

"slow through the air outside off, too wide to draw a stroke, left alone"
that's a low full toss and punished! Warner takes the ball before it pitches and flicks in the gap between mid-on and midwicket. Great batting
"flat and quick on off, darted in. Blocked"
short and wide this time from Jayant. Warner goes back quickly and cuts beautifully in the gap at point. Slow surface and Warner picked the length quickly. His footwork made that shot

"beauty. Slow through the air outside off, draws Renshaw forward, and the ball beats the bat by a distance"
"flat delivery down leg, Renshaw makes no contact with his block"
"huge appeal from Saha! India <strong>contemplate the review</strong> and Kohli opts for it. A flat delivery from Ashwin, Renshaw got right forward but there was a bit of spin. The ball misses the bat though. No spike on UltraEdge. 'I've got daylight between bat and ball,' says the third umpire. The bat grazed the pad there."

"pushes it through quicker, and just outside off, Warner keeps back and blocks. Not quite as surely as he would like"
"<b>beaten</b>! This is good bowling from Jayant. He is quick through the air, trusting this pitch to still give the ball enough bite and it does. Good length ball on off stump rips past the outside edge"
"<b>bowled around his legs, but he's overstepped</b> and then the ball wanders over to the boundary for byes! Massive no-ball too, by about a foot. Warner is shifting across onto off stump, to perhaps get closer to ball as it turns and Jayant slides in a quick one into middle, makes it drift on and clip leg stump. All for nothing though"

"tosses it up on off stump, defends"

"much much better. Full outside off, Warner gets forward to defend"
"full on off, when in doubt, go full on this surface. Darted in. Warner blocks. This is a superb battle, Warner clearly dominating Jayant. That's what attacking intent can do"

"goes wide of the crease, round-arm action and fires one on off, blocked"
"fired in again, quick on off, Renshaw defends off the back foot"

"short and slow outside off, defended towards cover"

""

"flatter delivery outside off, chopped to a deepish point for one"

"<strong>that's close</strong>, but first impression is it's a good decision. Good call from umpire Kettleborough. Flat delivery on off, the ball skids on and beats Warner on the inside edge. Probably umpire's call on impact?"

"gets 'im this time. Kohli's bowling change works. A big blow for Australia. Nothing special about the delivery, but the line is good, the length is good. Yadav goes full, a set of stumps outside off. Warner's natural attacking tendency to get bat on ball forces him to play at that, bat away from the pad. His feet get to the pitch late too. Gets a thick inside edge which clatters into middle and leg stump. Will this open an end up?"
"full down leg, left alone."
"this could be a plan actually. Sees Smith walking across and fires it down leg, Smith leaves. Opens up the bowled and caught down the leg side options. Not a bad tactic early on"

"gets right forward to defend. A good way to play spin, decisive feet movement"

"big big appeal! Maybe sliding down. No, says umpire Kettleborough, but <strong>Kohli wants it checked</strong>. Is that a good review when you're gambling or hoping? Definitely no bat. Full and straight from Umesh, but the ball was seaming back, some inward tail. Smith was opened up but the ball was sliding well down. That's not even clipping leg stump. India don't have any more reviews for the next 41 overs. On such a surface, a couple of bad decisions will be made, can only blame yourself"

"Smith needs a dive. Full outside off, Marsh flicks to mid-on and calls for one. Smith sets off late but makes it with a full-length dive, the throw hits him"
"flat outside off, some spin, defended"
pitches outside leg and Marsh pads it away. Can't be out lbw if it pitches outside leg. Get your gloves and bat out of the way though
"goes for the sweep. Flat delivery down leg, Marsh misses his sweep and is struck on the pad"
"that's lucky. A fortuitous dismissal. A flat delivery down leg from Jayant, Marsh is slightly late on his sweep and misses it. The ball hits the pad and then bobbles up onto his gloves and then the back of his bat before settling in Kohli's hands at leg slip. Not a bad option from Marsh, just flawed execution.

"full and straight again, a thick inside edge down to fine leg for a run"
"full and wide outside off, lulls Smith into a drive. Smith wants no carrots, leaves"
"wobbly movement in the air. Full on off, Smith almost has his whole body to Ishant, like Chanderpaul. Blocks."

"too quick still, Handscomb is happy to work the ball towards midwicket"
"excellent end. Slowed up on off, Handscomb sees flight, sees time, gets forward and inside-edges to short leg."
"excellent line. Good length outside off, Smith swishes a leave. A unique leave, always looking to play but if the ball isn't there, he withdraws the bat late"
"pace off the ball it looked like. 142 says the speed gun. Seemed like an offcutter on off, defended to mid-on"
"full and straight, 137 kph, shovelled into the leg side with the angle. Ishant has been good today"
"a definite offcutter outside off, 120 kph. Played towards point for a run, good single again"

"almost chops on. Fuller than a good length outside off, gets his bat down late and inside-edges the ball over the stumps"
"slow outside off, Smith gets forward and defends. Playing as late as possible"
"comes to the pitch, resists the temptation to go through the vacant cover region, and pushes to long-on with the spin. Calculated, riskless batting"
"if it's that full, by all means. Too full from Ashwin outside off, Handscomb leans into a sweetly-timed cover drive through cover."
runs to the pitch and drives to mid-on with the spin
"nice pace, slow through the air, tossed up above the eyeline. Played into the leg side"
"airy. But safe. And four. Handscomb is a tad early into his flick but gets good timing and finds the gap. If he finds the last requisite, anything goes."
"full outside off, inward seam movement. Defended back"
"full delivery outside off, comes back in. Blocked"
"full and straight, Smith shovels a flick through midwicket. Between the two short fielders"
"goes short. A bouncer on middle and leg, pulled away merrily down to fine leg for a run"
"full and straight from Ishant, Smith watches the ball onto his bat as he defends"
"overpitched on off, Smith gets forward and blocks to cover. Should he be scoring of those? Maybe not actually. Good over"
"what happened there? Handscomb almost edged that. Jadeja mis-delivers, the ball sticks in his palm but it's left his hand. Bounces twice and is wide, Handscomb gives it all he has but is somehow beaten. Smiles all around. That should be a wide or a no-ball?"
""
"shortish and a tad wide, Handscomb misses his cut. Beaten by plenty of spin"
"a no-ball. Shortish and wide, pushed to cover. Jadeja oversteps again"
"flatter and straight, worked down to fine leg nicely."
"shortish and wide outside off, played away defensively"
"oh yes. Gets it straighter and slow, Smith stays back after picking the length but the ball bounces and spins to beat the bat. Gem of a delivery, not the only one today"
"flat outside off, Handscomb goes back but the ball spins down leg. Wow, <b>that is prodigious turn</b>"
"too quick and straight, worked away towards midwicket"
"well played. Ashwin goes short and wide, but Smith knows hos much spin is there. Stays back and defends"
"uses his feet, skips down the pitch and works a run to deep midwicket. Really good batting"
"slow through the air outside off, Handscomb defends. Just have to stay there consistently"
nudged away to midwicket for an easy run.
"flat and straight, Handscomb defends. Gets bat on it somehow. Can't play back to Jadeja"
"that was always coming. A flat delivery from Jadeja, Handscomb is undone by the lack of turn and the fact that he is is too far back in his crease. This is the natural variation, the non-turning delivery. Handscomb stays back and the ball skids on to beat Handscomb on the inside edge: the previous delivery should have been a signal. Struck right in front of middle and leg. Out says umpire Llong. Handscomb chats with Smith but walks off."
"flat and wide outside off, he stays in his crease to defend"
"flat and straight, another solid defensive block from Renshaw"
"overpitched on off, kept out"
"some turn. Flat delivery on middle and leg, the ball turns back in and hits Renshaw on the pad. Too much turn for lbw"
"straight to midwicket! After all the hardwork, Smith chips his wicket away. A flat delivery outside off from Ashwin, Smith runs down to the pitch and flicks nicely but can't keep it down or find the gap. Hits it at a comfortable height to Kohli at a square midwicket, who is typically delighted. That's a big wicket. Australia lose two in succession."
gets right forward to defend this. Nice loop from Ashwin
"outside edge and taken? Marsh indicates it has hit the back pad and <strong>so decides to review. </strong>Yes, Marsh is absolutely right. A nice, flat delivery from Ashwin, goes on with the arm and beats the bat. Grazes the back pad on the way to the keeper. 'I've got daylight between bat and ball,' says the third umpire. That's how you use a review. They should be checking lbw too? Yes, they do. Impact is outside and play can resume."

"shortish outside off, Marsh gets forward, looking to smother the spin but the ball turns and beats the bat"
"absolutely dead! Flat on off, the ball that doesn't turn. Jadeja brings this one back in with a round-arm action, Marsh stays back and misses a drive and is struck plumb in front of off. The finger went up almost before the appeal."

shifts around the wicket for a really full delivery on off stump. Wade digs it out
moves well back in his crease to a tossed up delivery on leg stump and is squared up as he defends towards gully. Good that he plays with soft hands

"targets middle and off, Renshaw who stays deep in his crease, defends, mindful of the ball straightening down the line"
"shortish and outside off, steers the ball to point"
sliding down the leg side and Renshaw clips it to deep square leg
"appeal for lbw and umpire Llong has given him. Wade seems to have moved across onto off stump and gets pinned by a skidder in front of the stumps. But this is around the wicket, so could the angle have been taking it down leg? Wade thinks so and he goes for <b>a review</b>. Third umpire Illingworth says no bat involved. Says umpire's call on hitting the stumps, with ball tracking only just shaving leg stump. Tough call on Wade, but he has to go."
"back of a length on off stump, blocks"
"fuller delivery outside off, pushes into the covers"
"starts over the wicket again for a flatter delivery outside leg, Renshaw whips through to deep square leg"

"another slower ball, this thoug his a full toss, outside off, he makes connection and drives to cover"
"back of a length and outside off, leaves it alone"
"round-arm action, slow on off. Starc gets forward and defends. Ashwin may have to drag his length back to these two tall men"
driven away towards a deep mid-off for a run
"edged and taken. Beautifully bowled that. Went over the wicket, chose a round-arm action. The ball pitches straight and so Renshaw thinks he has to play. But he doesn't really. He chases after the ball and edges the ball to second slip, where Vijay gets forward and takes a good catch. Undone by some superb bowling. But that was a really good knock."
"slow delivery outside off, spins back in and hits O'Keefe outside the line"

carves a couple into the gap through gully. O'Keefe comes back for three. Kohli isn't happy at all. Rahul was the fielder who laboured after that. Should have been just two
oh nicely bowled. This one moves away and O'Keefe has no chance. Forced into playing because of the inward movement. Beats the bat
"what a catch that is. Not seen anything better this home summer. That wasn't even really a reflex catch. Short and wide from Umesh, O'Keefe looks to hammer a cut away but the ball takes the outside edge and flies through the slip region. Until, that is, Saha dives to his right, both feet parallel to the ground, and takes a one-handed screamer. Had to leap"
"and he's plumb first ball. Australia have two wickets in hand, two reviews left. The math adds up and <b>so Lyon reviews</b>. Umpire's call on impact says HawkEye. No bat. Umpire Llong's decision is upheld. Full and straight from Umesh, the ball seaming back in to strike Lyon right in front of leg. Looked even more out after he fell over"

"full and straight from Umesh, Starc stays in his crease to defend. Not a lot of movement"
"excellent change in length. A well-directed 140 kph bouncer on middle, Starc takes his eyes off the ball as he pulls and is beaten by some distance. Nice bowling"

"on the pads, clipped away towards midwicket from the crease"
"miscued but enough to clear mid-on, and almost the boundary. Short of a length down leg, Starc is harried for pace again. His mis-timed pull lands just inside the boundary. Onto 49 now"
"superb stroke. Overpitched on off, Starc nails his straight drive to Ishant who sticks out his left hand and saves four. Starc has a smile, Ishant doesn't"

"full and wide from Ishant, Hazlewood offers no stroke"
"tosses it up from around the wicket, onto off stump, Starc lunges forward and blocks. Massive reach."
"in the slot and he thumps it down the ground. Ashwin turns around and walks back, fuming. The first ball he gives a little air to is met with a feral straight-bat thwack"
"drags his length back, bowls it quicker, and beats the outside edge as Starc searches for it"
another big-spinning offbreak leaves the tall left-hander groping outside off
"slog sweeeeep... but he picks out the man at deep midwicket. That's the Australian innings done, Ashwin enjoys the scalp, clapping as he watches Starc walk off. The ball was tossed up again, making the batsman think he should go for the big swipe. But it's a lot closer to middle and leg, not allowing him the leverage he wants. Simple catch at cow corner"
doesn't wait to show the batsman his trump card - the inswinger - lining it up on off stump and making it curl into middle. Vijay nudges it through midwicket to get off the mark
well bowled again. Especially at 140-plus kph. Makes Rahul play at a good length ball on off stump and the inswing he generates makes sure the batsman can't close the face and play across it
"146kph, back of a length and drifting across the right-hander, Rahul covers his stumps and shoulders arms"
"tails in sharply, but the line goes awry, meaning all of the 147 kph is available for exploitation. Rahul moves back in his crease and flicks behind square leg"
"<b>superb bowling</b>. He is probing for the lbw and bowled. Pitches it up. makes it swing in late, and that's besides the pace at which it comes. Rahul just about gets an inside edge"
"lands a yorker just outside off, Rahul gets low and jams his bat down on it."
reads the length as shortish ever so early and jumps back in his crease to open up the off side to the left of short cover
"lobs it up over the batsman's eyeline, who keeps beside the line and nails a cover drive right into Peter Handscomb's shins at silly point"
"nice and slow, as he gives it some air on middle, Rahul blocks"
"well bowled. Held the ball back, and gains some turn off this pitch, Rahul follows it a bit as he blocks"
"tosses it up just outside off, Rahul jabs it down the ground for an easy single to long-off. Shouldn't be allowing that"
gently eases a flighted delivery outside off past silly point's right.
"supremely well timed. It's all in how early he sees the width. It's only a tiny bit, but he thinks it's there for a cover drive and he moves so fluently into the shot. Doesn't look to over-hit. Just times it past short cover's left"
falls for the sucker ball. Starc uses his left-armer's angle and throws it wider to see if Rahul still likes the cover drive. He does and he is beaten by a 147 kph scorcher. And yet it doesn't carry to the keeper
"142 kph, pushes him on the back foot with a short delivery on off stump"
keeps his wrists down and sways away from a short ball moving across him at 148 kph. Good batting. Saw it early
"there's the teaser, well wide of off stump at 146 kph, Rahul, wisely, leaves. It's a weakness of his, instinctively wafting his bat at stuff he shouldn't"
"back of a length and outside off, Rahul shoulders arms"
"good length ball outside off, Vijay is forward, across and then leaves outside his eyeline"
presses towards the pitch of the delivery on off stump and drives it to long-off for a simple single
"well bowled. Lines this up on middle, hoping to get some turn, and perhaps have the batsman flicking across the line. Neither manifests though as Rahul defends well"
leans into a push towards silly point as O'Keefe tosses it up wide outside off
"wrong line and Rahul does every so well to just nudge it to the fine leg boundary. The gentlest, most beautiful, punishment of a bowler's mistake, the leg glance"
"covers the line of a flighted delivery on off stump, moving his back foot across, and pushing his weight forward, to block"
"well left. Vijay is standing on middle stump, he sees the ball pitched short and doesn't bother with it because it will easily climb over the stumps"
"full and wide, inviting the drive, Vijay won't be so easily tempted and again a high-pace delivery goes to the keeper on the half-volley. Wade is going to be severely tested"
"back of a length, around the fifth stump, coming in just a shade. Vijay covers the off stump and ignores it"
good bowling. Starc reads that his swing is diminishing already and so goes to his other weapon - the bouncer on middle and leg. Vijay sees it early enough to duck
"superb shot! Mostly because this is the ball Starc thought he would get a wicket off of. He had plied Vijay with a few deliveries outside off stump to set up this delivery -  full, straight, aimed at the base of middle and curling in through the air. Vijay keeps his feet out of the way and uses those lovely wrists to send it past mid-on's right"
drives past cover to retain strike
"tosses it up outside off, Vijay leans into a drive and finds a single to long-off and finally Smith cottons on to India's plans and brings that man up inside the circle"
"looks for an expansive drive through the covers, making room into the leg side for the unfurling of the hands. Ends up getting an inside edge through his legs. Lovely drift from O'Keefe"
lets a flighted delivery come into him on middle and leg and clips it through midwicket
yanks his front leg out of the way of a loopy delivery that almost comes into the blockhole and flicks it through square leg
"nails a drive against a ball in the slot outside off, but he doesn't pick the gap at cover"
"good length ball, just outside off, VIjay reads the line and doesn't care to do much more than that"
starts a bit too close to middle and leg and the batsman works it to long leg
"gets some curl in the air as he pitches it up outside off, Vijay blocks to short cover cautiously. Lovely technique. Playing close to the body and connecting as late as he can"
firm push to cover off this length ball at 138 kph
"back of a length and outside off, Vijay is happy to let it pass"
"caught behind! Typical Hazy! He can camp on a good length outside off stump for days on end, waiting for the edge. Today he doesn't have to wait long. Vijay pokes, looks back and receives confirmation that he has been done in by a beauty"
"good length ball, moving back into him, Pujara defends with the angled bat to gully"
"tosses it up outside off, Rahul blocks into the covers"
"looks to drive towards mid-off, keeping leg side of the tossed up delivery on middle, but gets a bit of an inside edge back at the bowler"
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
"slow turn outside off, allowing Rahul, who jumped back to try and cut hard, the time to adjust and dab it with a straight but angled bat behind point"
"loops it up on off stump, Pujara pushes it to the right of short cover"
"massive appeal for lbw, but umpire Kettleborough says no. Pujara, not often do you see this, plays down the wrong line as a ball intended to spin away goes straight one and hits him on the back pad in front of the stumps. But before that it took an inside edge so he's okay"
gets the ball to veer in sharply through the air and Rahul uses it to flick to square leg
"<b>cuts him in half</b> as Rahul too goes poking outside his off stump. His feet don't move in accordance to the ball, pinned deep in his crease, but he wants to feel it on bat and reaches out with just his hands"
"full and angled into middle and leg, defends"
"<b>beats him with a beauty</b>. His control of length and line is special. Pitches it on fifth stump, forces the batsman to play with the angle of the ball coming into him, and then makes it straighten at the very last second"
"goes wider of the crease for a shortish delivery at 142 kph, Rahul shuffles in line with it and nudges towards the leg side"
defends with such soft hands that the ball rolls back towards the wicketkeeper. No real threat to the stumps
brings a straight bat down to smother a tossed up ball on off stump
good forward press towards the pitch of the ball on off stump and blocks
goes wide of the crease for a tossed up delivery on leg stump and nudges it in front of square leg
"races down the pitch and pulverises the length ball over the bowler's head. Boy, that was out of nowhere. Usually you see that kind of batting from his opening partner."
"tosses it up on off stump, defends making sure to get to the pitch"
"stands up tall behind a flatter, quicker delivery on off stump and forces it to short cover"
"beautifully worked past square leg. This shot is made by how he waited for the ball to arrive. The front leg is on middle, the bat comes in front of it, straight, and then only at the last minute does he close the face and imbues the power of his wrists into the shot"
"good length ball outside off, defends"
"goes wide of the crease, making Pujara think he has to play at a ball that is meant to hold its line outside off. Clever bowling. Extremely clever bowling for the batsman was originally intended to play and only at the last second did he realise he didn't have to"
"back of a length and outside off, offers no shot"
"full and moving into middle and off, Pujara plants his straight bat in front of his pad to block"
steps forward to meet the inswinger right under his eyes on off stump
"good length ball, turning in sharply from outside off, Rahul hangs back and nudges it into the leg side"
"risky, but he diminishes the chances of his making a mistake by reaching the pitch of the offbreak and slamming it through the vacant cover region"

"shifts his weight back, readking the quicker, flatter delivery, and then uses his wrists to blunt it."
"nicely tossed up on off stump, Rahul covers it well"
"keeps back to a fullish delivery because it is fired in outside off, Rahul does well to keep a straight bat and push to the left of short midwicket"
"full, outside off, Pujara judges it to pose no threat to his stumps and leaves"
"lets the back of a length ball come to him, on and around off stump, and dabs it to point"

"goes wide of the crease for a full delivery outside off, Pujara leaves it alone"
"short of a length and outside off, pushes into the covers"
shifts back to a flatter delivery on off stump and pushes it to mid-on
"some turn - but it's rather slow - as Rahul goes back, looking to flick, and then decides to go a different way. Opens the face to find some runs at cover"
"loops it up outside off to bring the batsman forward to block. Pujara gets an inside edge onto pad, making that a bewildering lbw appeal"
"tosses it up outside off, but doesn't let Pujara get to the pitch of it, even though he is quite a distance forward. Inside edge to short leg"
"and once it's a touch short, Pujara rocks back and whips it to midwicket"
goes back to get in line with a flat delivery on off stump and pats it down
"full at the base of off stump, Pujara uses the straight bat to good effect"
"what a ripper! An absolute rip-snorter! This defies the Pune pitch. It's back of a length and it just takes off. Climbs up towards Pujara's chest, and as he looks to fend at the ball, moving across him, he gets the softest little glove on the ball through to Wade. Australia wanted to take out India's best batsman capable of batting time and they have"
"good length, outside off, at 145 kph, refuses to play"
"he's sucked him in! Starc, you beauty. The most in-form batsman in the world gone second ball. And it's a terribly soft dismissal. Kohli chases after a full and wide delivery and nicks off to first slip. Simple catch. But we're waiting to see if it's a legal delivery. Has Starc kept his front foot behind the line? Yes he has. What an over from Australia's spearhead"
"back of a length and outside off, no need to go after those"
"full on off stump and Rahane keeps it out beautifully. Considering that had 146 kph on it, his effortless defence is just remarkable."
"tosses it up just outside off, defends"
"tosses it up just outside off, nudges it into the leg side"
"keeps back to a flatter delivery outside off, and tucks it past leg gully, making sure to keep it down"

"tosses it up outside off, defends off the inside edge"
"tosses it up outside off, smothers the turn with a big stride forward"
"good length ball outside off, leaves it alone"
"full on off stump, Rahul defends solidly to mid-off. Speedgun screams 146 kph"
"<b>lovely bowling</b>. At 146 kph, the amount of times he threatens the stumps makes him special. This is full, it begins by shaping into the right-hander, but holds its line after pitching. Rahul plays late and defends well because he is careful to play with a straight bat"
"short ball at 146 kph, moving across the right-hander, Rahul sways away from it"
"good batting. He is committing to the shot at the last possible moment. Which is hard to do when Starc is generating speeds of 147 kph. Good length ball on off stump, defends firmly"
"shortish on middle, Rahul clips to short midwicket. Rahane thinks there is a single, but is sent back early enough"
"stays back to a good length ball and defends. Not entirely certainly though, because he isn't sure how much Lyon is turning the ball"
"tosses it up just outside off, Rahane presses forward to block with soft hands. Can't quite get to the pitch"
"<b>inside edge</b> and it just about lobs over leg gully! Beautiful bowling from Lyon. He lines it up just outside off, but the length is key here. It brings Rahane forward, but never allows him to get to the pitch. Then he has to commit to a defensive push, which brings the inside edge into play, soon after extra bounce"
"launches a reverse sweep past point's left. There is even a puff of dust as the ball pitches outside off, and yet the batsman goes for it with all the confidence in the world"
goes back and blocks a flatter delivery on off stump and nudges it into the leg side
"keeps out a quick, flat delivery on off stump"
"full and outside off, Rahane pushes to mid-off"
"teaser outside off, but Rahane is wary of it. Good man, leaves well"
"sweet strike down the ground. It may only result in one, but it should pump up Rahane's confidence. A perfectly good length ball outside off is driven masterfully to the right of mid-off. Warner the man there with a sliding save"
"full and on leg stump at 143 kph, but in stretching for that pace, Starc has bowled a no-ball. Rahul defends it"
"moves around the wicket, but pops out a half-volley outside off. And all that pace - 147 kph - doesn't matter as Rahul comes forward and executes a flowing cover drive, well to the left of the fielder"
well bowled. He is going wide of the crease from around the wicket to try and make Rahul play across the line into the leg side. But the batsman keeps a straight bat to deal with a 148 kph full delivery that holds its line
"sliding down and Rahul is able to clip it towards deep square leg. Pace, 149 kph."
"rocks back and by virtue of keeping a straight bat, he is able to deal with the short turn and bounce. Punches to cover"
"loops it up outside off, making Rahul reach for it while he tries to block. Hits the pad first, but he seems to be playing a shot so no real need to yell for lbw"
"inside edge, as he loops the ball up, but at a slower pace. Rahul, who commits to the shot a bit too early, is beaten by the dip and mistimes the shot. Push to cover ends up in the bowler's hand"
shifts back to a good length ball turning and bouncing into middle and leg. Rahul blunts it
"keeps out a quicker delivery on off stump, from deep in his crease"
seems to sense Rahul wanting to come down the pitch and fires it in flat. The batsman then keeps back and pushes it through vacant cover
"you won't dictate terms anymore says the set batsman, nailing a cover drive on the up and getting it past Warner at mid-off. And if you beat him, you know you've timed it well. How that ball deserved to go for four will remain a mystery"
"shortish on middle and leg, clips to square leg"
"back of a length and outside off, Rahul covers the stumps and lets it go"

"goes for the bouncer at 140 kph, Rahane gets up on his toes and blunts it down on off stump"
"late swing into the right-hander, and Rahane gets an inside edge as he tries an on the up push towards cover. Handscomb at short midwicket gets a hand to it, and then the ball bounces off his boot and goes for a single to square leg"
"aims a full delivery on off stump from wide of the crease, Rahul keeps a straight bat"
"seems like the offcutter just outside off, Rahul presses forward to block to cover"
"full and coming into the right-hander, Rahul has his straight bat close to his front pad. He's played an absolute gem so far"
"loops it up outside off, Rahane stretches forward to smother it"
"makes him reach outside off, and also does well to not let Rahane get to the pitch of the ball. Block to silly point"
"ooh, inside edge, as he looks for a big ole extra cover drive. Wrong length for that, could easily have dragged on"
"good length ball on middle, defends"
<b>beauty</b>! This is a good length ball that pitches just  beyond the reach of the batsman's front foot and then draws up a big puff of dust from the pitch as it skips past the outside edge

"a leg side start, on the pads, harmlessly played into the leg side"
"good adjustment, flat and straight, on off and middle, a solid block"
"slower and wider outside off, Rahane leaves, the ball turns prodigiously but harmless because of the line"
"poor delivery. Short and wide from O'Keefe, Rahane rocks back and nails a cut through point. Picked the length early and rocked right back"
"changes his line, closer to off, forces Rahane to defend"
"good end, got some drift there. Full and slow on off, Rahane instinctively plants his front foot forward to defend"
"139 kph, shortish on leg stump, clip to midwicket"
plays with the open face as he blocks outside off and the 144 kph delivery goes through point
"careful to play with a straight bat as Starc sends in a bazooka on middle stump, and makes it move away a slight bit"
"up and over the slips. Not in control of the shot, but at Starc's pace - 142 kph - with the width on offer there is no real risk in the shot. Top edge over backward point"
"good length ball outside off, Rahane allows it to sail across to the wicketkeeper"
"back of a length on off stump, safely kept out"
moves back to a flatter delivery on off stump and works it through midwicket
"some turn outside off, but with the line also being outside off, Rahane takes the opportunity to leave"
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
"low full toss on off stump, drums it to long-off. O'Keefe as the containing option looks out of place when Australia have to take a wicket now"
"<b>a high-class fifty</b> for Rahul on a difficult track, against a probing attack. And this shot makes a good show of how well he has played. Pushes forward to the pitch of the ball and drives to long-off with a perfectly straight bat"
"good length ball, Rahane opens the face to deal with the turn"
"outside edge, but there is no third slip. Rahul flashes hard outside off stump to a delivery that seems to pose no threat - full and wide outside off - but at Starc's pace, and considering he has got so many wickets with the angle across the right-hander, these are still dangerous"
"good length ball on off stump, blocks"
"past gully's right at catchable height! Another risky shot from Rahul, as he chases a full and wide delivery again. Manage to put enough power with his wrists to get the ball past Mitchell Marsh, who did well to dive across, but the only chance he has if it sticks"
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
"full on off stump, pushes to mid-off"
"good bouncer, and an even better leave. It's short, on middle and leg, and not dug in so short that the batsman can easily spot it. Rahul keeps his eyes on the ball and drops his wrists and sways away. Top cricket"
"tosses it up outside off, Rahane pushes forward to block to cover. That area is vacant"
stays back and blocks a flatter delivery on off stump
"stays back to a good length ball turning into off stump. Good line from Lyon. He's tempting the right-hander to play to cover, against the turn"
"fires it through on middle, Rahane goes back and nudges it to leg gully"
"seems to be beaten by the dip on the ball, as he loops it up a little slower. Rahane thinks it is overpitched and strides forward for a flick to midwicket, but he realises he won't get to the ball and has to use softer hands"
"'catch,' is the cry as Lyon makes Rahane stretch forward outside off to defend, but the ball kicks up off the pitch and takes the inside edge. Doesn't carry to Handscomb at short leg"
"lashes it through cover. Fine shot from Rahul, as he leans into the cover drive. He is within his right to play this shot considering this is a half-volley. Starc has to pull his length back just a bit, if he wants to ply the right-hander outside off"
"142kph, back of a length and outside off, Rahul shoulders arms"
blocks a good length ball outside off and sets off for a single into the covers
"makes Rahane hop a bit, even though he doesn't quite need to - a direct response to the high pace of Starc - as he blocks on middle and leg"
"digs it in, but Rahane sees it early and gets out of the way"
"wafts outside off and Rahane, despite surviving, should be displeased with himself for trying a shot like that. it's the typical left-armer's teaser outside off, on a good length, and the right-handed batsmen just bumbles into the trap"
"tosses it up from around the wicket, and Rahul comes forward to smother the spin"
pushes to the left of mid-off as Rahul does well to lunge forward and get to the pitch of the ball. <b>That's the fifty partnership</b>
"tucks it into the leg side as Lyon moves back over the wicket to Rahane. Length ball, on off, handled"
"this rips up at the batsman from outside off, as Lyon slows it down and pitches it well outside off. Rahane knows it will turn as he gets back in his crease to try and block. But all he can do is <b>get a glove</b> and Warner <b>drops it</b>, diving to his right"
"loops it up just outside off, Rahane defends"
""
"tosses it up on off stump, keeps it out"
"throws it away! And Rahul crumples up, clutching his left shoulder, this looks bad. Awful shot from a batsman who has looked so classy until this very moment. Comes charging out at Australia's weakest bowler and looks to heave him over long-off. But he doesn't quite get the pitch and therefore the shot skews off the outside edge. Warner rushes in from long-off, takes a simple catch and yells his head off in delight"
"loops it up outside off, drives to the left of mid-off"
"has he taken it at second slip? The batsman stands his ground, to be sure if it carried, so the umpires go upstairs to check. Soft signal is out. Would be a spectacular catch if Handscomb has pulled it off. And it is. Outstanding effort. More so because Rahane was looking to hit into the leg side so the fielder would only have known the ball was coming at him at the last possible moment. Dives low to his right and picks it up without the hand even touching the ground"
"good length ball outside off, presses forward to block"
"three in the over! O'Keefe is pulling off a blinder! This is his strength. Keeping the ball there and thereabouts and on a pitch like this, where turn is available virtually from anywhere, he becomes a handful. Took a long time to get into rhythm and now look at what he's done. Good length ball, angled into middle, makes Saha poke at the ball tentatively and the outside edge hitchhikes off the keeper's gloves to Steven Smith at slip"
stays back to a good length ball to play it off the pitch and he turns it to leg gully
"tosses it up on off stump, defends"
"they are asking for a catch off the bat, then boot and to short leg. Umpire Kettleborough goes up to check with his partner at square leg. The soft signal is out. This is a quicker, but fuller delivery, so Ashwin going back is a bit off. He defends hurriedly and it bounces straight off the big toe and Handscomb has pulled off another outstanding catch, diving forward and sticking out his right hand. What an asset he is close in! Special fielder. He doesn't flinch despite being so close in. So he is always a threat"
"pushes forward at a good length ball outside off, gets nowhere near the pitch of the ball, and gets struck under his stomach"
"another inside edge as he lunges forward to defend outside off. 'Catch,' cries Wade but this is too much even for Handscomb"
"shortish on off stump, he keeps back and blocks on off stump"

"good length ball on middle, Jadeja plays inside the line as the ball drifts across towards the slips. Gets a bit of a leading edge"

presses forward to a good length ball on off stump and keeps it out. Forgot to mention that O'Keefe is bowling over the wicket to the left-hander

presses forward to smother the turn on middle and leg
<b>massive turn</b> from outside off as Jayant goes back to try and flick a good length spitting cobra. Misses it altogether
"tosses it up outside off, drives to mid-off"
"lunges forward to pad up to a good length ball outside off. He seems like he is defending, but the bat is hiding behind pad"
"drives through cover, kept vacant to encourage hitting against the turn, Jayant drives along the ground"
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
"has he shelled it at silly point? Well, the ball did fall out of his hands, so all we need is confirmation that Jayant has hit it. Comes forward to a good length ball, with hard hands, but it pitches well outside his reach and he is a sitting duck. Luckily the ball spins past the inside edge and into pad"
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
"bounce, off a full, flat delivery on off stump, and Jadeja his to roll his wrists and yank his top hand off to keep it down and make it go past leg gully"
"they're screaming for a stumping! Australia are already celebrating. And they have a right to, Jayant stretches too far he tries to defend a good length ball. Not sure if he should be playing those, has no hope of reaching them where they pitch. And consequently, the ball turns, rips past the outside edge. Wade collects it well and whips the bails off. Jayant's back foot is on the line and off he goes"
drives a fuller ball on off stump to long-off
nudges a tossed up delivery on middle to short midwicket
"<s>he has five</s>! Oh, but wait, Jadeja reviews and he is absolutely confident this has come off his forearm. This is a length ball from O'Keefe, pulling a puff of dust as it kicks up to bounce over the bat, over the gloves, off the forearm as Jadeja pointed out, and to leg gully"
"flatter delivery outside off, Umesh shuffles across in front of his stumps and works it behind square leg to bring up the hundred"

this one goes straight on. Wicked bowling from Australia. Jadeja just about manages to flick through midwicket

stays back and flicks to leg gully
"tosses it up on middle and leg from over the wicket, the left-handed Jadeja blocks"
"he has five! Who would have thought he would bring about India's downfall? And really, O'keefe hasn't done much more than plug away at a good length in line with the stumps - and that too only after lunch. This wicket though is the result of Jadeja thinking he doesn't have too much time to bat on this pitch with only Nos. 10 and 11 for company. Races down the pitch the moment he sees some flight and slogs to deep midwicket. Can't beat the fielder"

goes back and blocks a flatter delivery on off stump
"pushes to long-off, preferring to play from deep in his crease despite the length being fullish"
"not sure if he plays a shot to that, and umpire Kettleborough rules dead ball, indicating he hasn't. Good length, rips into the right-hander from outside off, Ishant shoulders arms and it deflects off his thigh pad past leg slip"
"finishes it off with his sixth wicket! Umesh runs at the left-arm spinner and slogs against the turn, gets a thick outside edge and Smith takes a fine catch, reverse cup in front of his head to his left"
"punches a shortish delivery to the right of point, hanging back and playing the length"
"pulls out the reverse sweep, Warner with so big a lead, can be devastating. This isn't a full blooded hit though. All he does is give a tossed up ball on leg stump a little direction. Just to a part of the field no one would have expected"
"moves around the wicket for a good length ball on off stump, defends"
"closes the face as he flicks against the turn, and the ball, having evoked a huge puff of dust, takes the leading edge past silly point's left"
"drums it through square leg, the orthodox sweep now, Warner working the angle of the bowler coming into him from around the wicket"
"plays the wrong line and he's been given lbw. Short and sweet from the Bull. Not sure how he could have reacted to this ball, knowing this pitch is turning big. It's the orthodox offbreak, pitching on off stump, so Warner defends outside it. Only the ball goes on with the arm and pins him in front of middle"

"shortish and just outside off, Marsh defends"

"good shot, jumping back in his crease, using a straight bat, opening the face to pick the gap at cover. All timing"
presses forward to block on middle

"<b>rips past his outside edge</b> as Jadeja pushes it through with his round-arm action. Pitches on middle, skips past Smith"

taps a fuller delivery down to long-on
"beautiful shot! A cover drive, which isn't necessarily the easiest shot to play, but Handscomb executes it perfectly. It's simply an extension of defence, so even though he is hitting against the turn, even though he isn't to the pitch of the ball, he is in a good position to time it"
waits on a good length ball - slower through the air - and blocks. Gets a bit squared up doing so

sweeps from off stump and sends the flatter delivery down to long leg
bat in front of pad to keep out a carrom ball on off stump
"taken at leg gully. From having the ball covered one second to losing your wicket the next, this is the danger for a batsman on this pitch. Handscomb read the length as short and shifted deep in his crease to try and flick the ball through square leg, but the extra bounce does him in."
looks to defend a good length ball sprinting past the outside edge. Has no chance of making contact
"plays inside the line of a tossed up delivery, angled into middle, and spinning away sharply. Jadeja goes up for a caught behind appeal, but there is no nick. Plenty of daylight"
"and there's more. Smith defends in line with off stump, playing inside the line of the ball, preparing for the one that comes into him. So while he is beaten, he isn't out"
a thick outside edge drifts past gully and Australia take two. Confirmation of that has to come from the third umpire though. Full length dive makes sure Smith is in

"<b>leaves a length ball pitching on middle stump</b> and as he had judged it, it spins massively and evades his stumps"
goes for a sweep against a flatter delivery on off stump - too quick for him to make connection

nudges it behind square leg
"lobs up a slow, tossed up offbreak outside off, Smith defends"
"short ball outside off, Smith rocks back and crunches it through point"
"plays around his front pad as he tries to block a flighted delivery outside off. Huge lbw appeal, but impact was outside off"
"attempts another slog sweep, and this is a straight ball. If he misses it, he's gone. And he misses it! Australia go for a review though. There is no bat, and ball-tracking - having taken an age to come on - shows umpire Kettleborough's on-field call of out has to be overruled! Wow. Pitches in line, hitting in line, but misses the stumps. Renshaw, tall man makes use of his reach and saves himself"

"good length ball, darting into middle and leg, Renshaw blocks and gets an outside edge past silly point"
"big appeal for an lbw but it's given as runs. Pretty luck for Renshaw, because he is in the worst position possible. Gets down to slog sweep, but the quicker pace, and the seriously full length does him in. That bat is still way too high even as the ball has crossed three-fourth the distance. Renshaw has to adjust, try and bring it down straight and quickly at that. Kudos to umpire Llong for picking the inside edge"
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
"another big appeal for lbw, Ashwin asking for pad first as he lobs up another loopy offbreak on middle and leg, but Renshaw inside edges first through square leg"
"goes for the sweep, taking a length ball from outside off and sending it to long leg"
"shortish and on middle and leg, Smith clips it through square leg"

"back of a length on off stump, Renshaw blocks late and gets a bottom edge to fully"
"solid sound off the bat as Renshaw leans forward to a fuller delivery and blocks to cover. Then, however, he goes towards square leg and onto his haunches for a few seconds. Only for a few seconds though"
"gets <b>struck on his forearm</b> as he misjudges the short ball. Thinks it would climb a lot higher and instinctively goes to duck. By the time he realises that isn't an option, the ball is on him. The physio makes his way out to check on Renshaw. Doesn't look pretty"
"on a length on middle and leg, he gets behind the line solidly"
"the carrom ball on middle and leg, blocked away"
"<strong>dropped</strong>! That should have been taken. Mukund the sub fielder. Flat on off, Smith comes down, inside-edges the ball into his pad and then straight to short leg. Grabs at the ball and puts it down, expected that to come quicker"

presses forward and inside-edges his block towards square leg
another nice gentle front-foot movement to get close to the ball and smother the ball

flipped into the leg side for an easy run
"a carrom ball down leg, worked easily to deep midwicket for one more"

"outside-halved. Slow and full, Renshaw comes down, looking to drive straight but some spin takes the ball past cover for a run"
"Smith hurries down, picks the ball up as it pitched and whips to deep midwicket"
"another drop! Runs just leaking away, catches being put down. Four more. Flat delivery outside off, Renshaw gets low, connects with his reverse sweep, but the top edge was going straight to Rahane at first slip. Instead Vijay, at second slip, sticks his right hand out and parries the ball to the boundary"
"another reverse sweep. Flat and wide, paddled into Vijay at second slip"
defended easily off the back foot. Reads the length so early
"good length ball outside off, Renshaw ignores it"
fishes at a back of a length delivery moving away from the left-hander. Comes up with nothing
connects with a solid drive into the covers. Then walks across to square leg and gets down on his haunches again
"squares him up with a ball that starts on leg stump and then skips away after pitching. Umesh's pace and his ability to make it skid on still threatening batsmen. Renshaw, meanwhile, continues to struggle with his upset stomach"
"slides it down leg and Smith clips it to deep square leg to bring up his half-century. Has over 1000 runs against India, in only seven Tests"
gets in line with a back of a length delivery on off stump
"'catch,' is the cry and Ishant answers in the affirmative at long-off. Renshaw comes down the ground to a length ball on off stump and aims to slug it over long-on. But he isn't to the pitch of the ball, that means it can turn, and take off the outside half of the bat. Walks off banging his palm against his helmet, clearly disappointed, but he has provided a fantastic account of himself, struggling with an upset stomach in one of the toughest places to play cricket"
"prepares for a big slog sweep, but misses it altogether. Considering his front leg was outside off, he has no trouble surviving the lbw shout"
"quicker delivery into middle and leg, Smith moves effortlessly back and flicks through square leg"
"ripping turn, right past Marsh as he shuffles across onto off stump, looking to flick it to square leg. Saha does well moving to his left, despite being blinded by the batsman"
""
"huge appeal for lbw, but umpire Llong says nope. Kohli thinks and thinks and thinks and then goes for it. Looks very hopeful from all that. This is a good length ball, starting outside off and turning sharply past the inside edge. Could easily be sliding down. And yes, that is indeed what ball-tracking confirms. On-field decision stands"
"back of a length and outside off, Marsh pokes outside off and gets an inside edge onto boot"
steps forward to block a fuller delivery on off stump
fierce drive through the covers. Knows its easier facing the fast bowlers on this pitch and so he doesn't care that he is hitting on the up. Second-innings batting for you
driven to mid-on
"wants to get the batsman closing the face and so lines the ball up on middle stump. Pitches it up, which is always good, and gets it to straighten just enough to case problems. Marsh does well to play with soft hands even if he is squared up"
"short ball, from wide of the crease, Marsh sways away"
"gets down the track, but he isnt able to reach the pitch of the ball, good work from Jayant that. Smith gets a leading edge through point"
"tries to sweep but makes no connection. Jayant goes up for an lbw, but it this ball impacted in line, it would be spinning past leg, if it's hitting leg, it would have hit outside off. Shouldn't review, but Kohli does. There's no bat involved. Ball-tracking confirms it is missing the stumps and India have lost both their reviews by the 37th over."
"tosses it up outside off, defends"
moves back despite the length being quite full and then has to hurry into blocking
"smashes a straight drive and had Jayant got a hand to it, he could have lost a finger. That's how hard Marsh had hit it. The moment he saw a little flight, he wound up"

"tosses it up outside off, Smith drives through cover"

""

"another flat, round-arm delivery, bowled at 90 kph. Makes Marsh reach for the ball, but the turn is too big to take the edge"
"finishes off with the arm ball, good over from Jadeja, but Marsh is able to block this out too"
stays back and flicks a flatter delivery through to deep square leg
gets across onto off stump and then flicks a length ball on middle stump to midwicket
"got a good chunk of that. Hits with the turn, gains additional advantage by running at the bowler, getting under the ball the moment he sees it tossed up. After that, it's all about power. Oh and of course the crowd there doesn't want to give the ball back."
nudges it through square leg
strides down the track and flicks a tossed up delivery on leg stump through midwicket
"flatter and quicker on leg stump, Smith shapes to flick but the turn is too much for him"

Is it clipping leg stump? That's all it needs to do. Everyone, including the officials, waiting on HawkEye. This could be sliding down. No it isn't. It's clipping the side of leg stump and India lose their first wicket and review. This is what Smith did so well, played the line of the ball. Vijay played for turn, and was beaten on the inside edge"

"and Rahul's gone too. <strong>India opt for their second review. </strong>A flat delivery outside off, Rahul goes deep on the back foot and misses the ball as it turns back in. Yes, there is spin but Rahul is playing so deep that the ball doesn't have far to travel. Umpire's call on impact and two Reds. If he has played that off the front foot, he had a better chance. That's the second wicket and their second lost review. That was an appalling review considering one had already been used."

lovely stroke. Gets forward and drives wide of mid-off. Renshaw dives to his left and saves two
"bowled 'im. Kohli has left a straight one. Was saying it all along that Kohli was playing for turn, but the danger was the one that doesn't turn. Yes, it pitched outside off. And yes, there has been plenty of turn. But so many of O'Keefe's deliveries have not turned. This one too. Skids on and knocks back off stump. Is that the game? I don't think that was an error in judgement, it was just the <b>wrong approach to batting against spin on this surface</b>."

"uh oh. Yet another soft dismissal for Rahane. Tosses this up outside off, draws Rahane forward. He plays too early and the ball stops in the surface a fraction of a second, because it takes a bit of the pitch with it. Rahane chips a catch to cover. That fraction accounts for Rahane, the difference between a boundary and a wicket"

It comes on slightly slower after pitching and the ball just evades mid-off, who dived forward, to his left"
"dangerous stroke. Flat and wide outside off, Ashwin leaves"
"quick and straight, defended"
"oh my. Ripping turn. Flat outside off, the ball turns sharply past Ashwin's outside edge"
"Smith <strong>chooses to review this</strong>. I thought it was out on first impression. This is very close. Pad first or bat first? Definitely pad first. Another full and flat delivery, Ashwin plays the ball late, the bat getting close to the ball behind the pad. Yes, all reds on HawkEye and Australia have another. O'Keefe takes the match ball and raises it to the crowd because he has ten in the match. Famine and feast for O'Keefe in his Test career. What an effort this has been.

Another slider from O'Keefe, scurries on and hits Saha in front of leg. O'Keefe raises the match ball again, he has his second five-for in as many innings. Umpire's call, just clipping leg stump. That will be tea as well."
"flat down leg to begin, worked away down to fine leg"
"was there an inside edge? Again, does not matter because India have lost their reviews. No bat. Pujara hit his pad with the bat, the ball then skidded on and struck Pujara in front of leg.

"this one goes on with the arm, Jadeja takes it off the stumps, chopped towards point"
a solid defensive shot
"there's No. 8 and Australia are on course for a memorable win. A flat delivery outside off, Jadeja goes back in his attempt to cut but the ball stays a touch low, doesn't spin as much as he expected. All of it results in a thick inside edge that hits off stump. A tad unlucky considering the variable bounce"
"flight outside off, a thick inside edge towards midwicket"
"no reviews and Ishant has to walk back now. India nine down. Gets right forward with his giant stride but Lyon's length is very good. He's allowed the ball to bounce and turn, and so it turns back in and takes Ishant's glove on its way to Warner at leg gully who won't drop that. Australia's spinners have done almost everything right."

"88 kph, flat and wide outside off, blocked."
Jayant runs down and drives the ball to long-on. He refuses the run
"flat and wide outside off, Jayant goes back and pushes the ball into the cover region, refuses the run"
"there it is. <strong>Australia complete a sensational 333-run win. </strong>Slow through the air, saw Jayant coming, dragged that length back, allowed the ball room to turn. It did, hit the glove and lobbed up for the keeper to take. The umpire's finger went up almost instantaneously. But there was no glove on that. Just pad. India don't have reviews left."
