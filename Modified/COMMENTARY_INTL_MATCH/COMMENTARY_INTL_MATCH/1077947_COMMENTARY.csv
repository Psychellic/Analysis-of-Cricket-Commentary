"fast dart on the stumps, bunted towards midwicket"
"short and outside off, skips back and chops the ball straight to cover"
"Shehzad swoops down on the ball and <b>nails a direct hit at the striker's end</b>. Lewis is caught short on the second. This is fractionally short and middle and leg, the batsman goes on the back foot and punches it through midwicket. Shehzad tears to his left from wide long-on, collects the ball with just one hand, and fires a flat, accurate throw. Excellent reflexes from Shehzad. He leaps, pumps his fist, and celebrates animatedly"

"pitched up on off, dinked into the covers for one"
"dug short on off, cramps him for room. Punched back to the bowler"

"short on leg stump, worked towards midwicket on the back foot"
"good length and angling across off, tip and run to cover. Smart running"

"very full and angling in, Walton eyes up a big cover drive and only manages an inside edge onto the pad"
"really full and outside off, driven on the up to mid-off. Kamran, the comeback man, collects the ball and flings it to the bowler. Wahab hugs Kamran and has a laugh with him"
"length ball on middle and leg, Walton picks it up and lofts it beautifully over midwicket. Holds his pose and makes the shot look even better"

"down the track, Imad drags his length back on off stump, pushed back to the bowler"
"an appeal for lbw, umpire Brathwaite raises his finger and sends back Samuels. Non-turning arm-ball. Samuels uses his feet and plays across the line. Imad fires it flatter and faster.

"full on off, defended on the front foot to cover"
"top-spinner outside off, short, chopped to short third man"
"Shadab takes a wicket off his second ball on debut! This one turns in - the wrong'un. Starts outside off and comes back in, Walton was looking for the legbreak, he plays down the wrong line and is pinned in front of middle. The tracker shows this would have grazed leg, pointing to umpire's call"
Pollard uses his feet and drives a full ball to leg for one
"<b>what a debut for Shadab</b>! Poor shot from Simmons, though. He simply drags it back onto the stumps. Normal legbreak outside off, Simmons looks to sweep against the turn. Sweep across the line. Sweeps with his head looking away. That was how bad it was. Simmons only drags it back on via a bottom edge"
"full and outside off, presses forward, opens the face and dabs to point"

"tossed-up googly, goes away outside off, swish and a miss"
"Shadab's debut is getting better! <strong>Three wickets in eight balls for him</strong>. Narine holes out to long-on. WI five down inside 10 overs. Another wrong'un, goes away outside off, Narine drops to one knee for a slog-sweep and ends up skying a catch to Imad"
"flighted full on off, blocked to cover"

"full and outside off, Carlos pushes loosely and inside-edges it onto the pad"
"straight ball on off, Pollard stretches forward and smothers it"
"<strong>Dropped! Kamran shells it at backward point</strong>. Why is he fielding at backward point? Shadab could have had 4 for 3. Tossed-up legbreak, turns away just outside off, Pollard swishes and skews it to the right of Kamran. He was painfully slow to react. Dives late to his right but can't close his fingers around the ball. It pops out. It looks ugly. Pakistan could have had Babar, Shehzad or Malik at backward point"

Brathwaite comes down the track and drives to long-on
"short on the hips, clipped to long leg on the back foot"

"chest-high short ball on middle and leg, fended to short fine leg"

"banged in short, Carlos lays into hit, flat-batting a pull on the front foot, towards deep midwicket"
"length ball on off, right in the slot, Carlos presses forward and swings at . Shehzad runs to his right from wide long-on, takes a swirling catch.... but realises he is about to lose his balance and tumble over the boundary. So, he flicks the ball back into the field of play and saves four runs for his team"
"Pakistan continue to pepper Pollard with short balls. He has been bounced out now. Banged outside off, Pollard has to fetch the pull from there. He ends up top-edging a catch to deep square leg"
"short of a length and angling away, the ball hits the bat as opposed to bat hitting ball. Played to point"
<strong>Flat-batted smash</strong>! Carlos makes room outside leg and shimmies out. This is a head-high short ball angling away around off or a shade outside off. He reaches out and tennis-swings it straight down the ground
"off-stump yorker, dug back down the pitch"
"full and really wide outside off, holds its line, Carlos slogs and does not connect"
"<strong>smashed again</strong>, this time all along the ground. Full-toss outside off, Carlos crunches a drive through the covers"

"slower ball cutting across off, Holder lunges out, swishes and does not connect."
"another slower cutter on leg stump, this is short, Holder camps back and pulls it away to deep square leg"
"Gee, what was that? Carlos pre-meditates - <strong>switches into a left-hander even before Tanvir delivers the ball</strong>.  Tanvir was smart enough to push it well outside leg or outside off (for a left-hander). This cutter is squirted away off the toe end"
"the batsman backs away outside leg, Tanvir follows him and beats the slog"
"short ball aimed at the badge of the helmet, Holder can't control a pull. He top-edges it in the air. Hasan Ali misjudges it. He runs in as opposed to staying back and sees the ball sail over him"
"Holder can't clear mid-off. Length ball outside off, Holder swings at the ball and miscues it to Hafeez"
"slider on middle, he gets forward and blocks"
"flipper that skids back in to cramp him for room, bunted to the off side"
"full and drifting into middle and leg, eased to mid-on to get off the mark"
"the ball drifted back in a long way from wide of the crease, turned to short fine leg"
worked into the gap at midwicket with soft hands. The square leg fielder had a lot of work to do
"hint of width, he rocks back and opens the bat face late to steer this between point and short third man. The distance between the advertising triangle and the hoarding is far too less. Rovman Powell smashes into the board and causes it much damage. Good to know he isn't hurt though."

"touch ahead at length on middle, defended back down the pitch"
worked with the angle to deep midwicket

"drifting into middle and leg, tucked to square leg. Shehzad wanted the single, Kamran didn't"
"too full, flicked to Rovman at long-on"

"gift of a delivery. Full toss outside off, thumped straight to cover point"
"short of a length and outside off, Holder hits the deck hard and generates extra bounce, beats Shehzad's wild cut"
"whoa. Shot. Shehzad runs down the track. Shorter on off, he swats it imperiously to the midwicket boundary. Nobody moved"
Holder hits back. Back of a length and outside off - <b>kicks up and seams away</b> - Shehzad is up on his tippy toes as he wafts at the ball loosely. He only feeds an outside edge to wicketkeeper Walton. Waist-high catch
"short, angled in, <strong>bursts off the surface</strong>, homing in on the chest. Babar throws his bat in front of his chest and fends it off"
"hip-high short ball outside off, slower offcutter, Babar rocks back, picks it, and swats it away to the midwicket fence. That was stylish as well"
"banged in short and outside off, hops and quells to cover"

"Karam ventures outside leg again, another one darted down leg. Left alone"
"floated up on off, Kamran clears his front leg and hoists it over mid-off. Classy Is this 2005 all over again?"
"six and out. Kamran ventures outside leg, Badree follows the moving batsman with a dipping knee-high full-toss. Kamran can't control a slog-sweep and holes out to Lewis at deep midwicket"

Wicketkeeper Walton rams into the chest of his captain Brathwaite, who is thrown back by the impact. <strong>Man down</strong> now .Brathwaite, though, hung onto the overhead catch despite that nasty collision. Brathwaite is down. Banged in short and outside off, Hafeez is late onto the pull and top-edges it hiiiiigh into the sky. Drops down into the hands of Brathwaite. Walton gets an earful from an angry captain"
