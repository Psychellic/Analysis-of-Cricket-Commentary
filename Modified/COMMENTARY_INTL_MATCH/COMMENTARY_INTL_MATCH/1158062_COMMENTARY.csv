"ooh, swing from the outset! Curling from leg to middle and uneasily fended away as Brathwaite is squared up"
"pushed onto the back foot, and nudged to the leg side"
"slightly back of a length, and curling towards the cordon. I think Jimmy likes this ball already"
"full length, and very tempting. Drawing Brathwaite forward and curling under an upraised bat"
fenced into the off side
"through to the keeper, more classic outswing on a good length"
"fenced down through third man, soft hands, and the debutant John Campbell is <B>off the mark with a first-ball boundary</B>"
sliding down the leg side
"tight line, <strong>beautiful line!</strong> Straightening just outside off stump and that's a very good leave"
"prodding forward in defence, meeting a good-length ball outside off stump"
"pushed cautiously with the swing, into the leg side"
"well bowled again, but effectively played! Slightly harder hands this time, but angled wrists, taking the ball down through the cordon and away to the rope"
"full length, leg stump, stabbed out to square leg"
"pushed into the covers, and through they go"
"soft hands once more, as Anderson finds extra lift from back of a length, stabbed down into the cordon"

"wider line, and through to the keeper"
"blotted into the off side, sharp single to keep the scoreboard ticking"
"back of a length, and battered hard down into the turf and away across a rapid outfield. This has been a very composed start from the new boy"

closing the face at the last second to work the single through backward square
"this one pings away from the bat, Campbell does well not to chase it"
"back of a length, through to the keeper once more"
closes the face once more for a deflection to the leg side
"<B>massive appeal!</B> Campbell is trapped on the crease by a late inswinger to the left-hander, but that seems to be sliding down!"
"<B>buzzes past the edge!</B> A classic one-two from Anderson, as this one holds its line and <I>just</I> scalps past the bat"
nothing doing there
"pops from a good length, and tucked to the leg side"
"back of a length and <B>pounded savagely over the leg side!</B> That's the danger when Curran gets it wrong. Too short, too slow, too easy to pick his spot with a roundhouse pull!"
"forward and half an appeal, much better length this time, and a hint of inside-edge"
leg-sided but straightening late. Campbell attempts a pick-up off the legs but can't connect
"better line now from Curran, much fuller"
forward and blotted back down the pitch
"tapped up the pitch, mid-on gathers"
"<strong>big inswinger! </strong>Anderson isn't rapid, but goodness, he's got tekkers! Thumps the pad but sliding down"
and the outswinger to follow. A confident leave

back of a length and jagging back to the right-hander
hurried outside off as Brathwaite drops his hands late
"attempted yorker but slightly off-line, another single to backward square"
firmly forward and pushed back down the track

"lifting sharply off the deck, and riding the bounce well"
"curling into the legs, Curran is finding some movement but it's sliding a little too often into the pads"
"zipping through to the keeper, past the outside edge. Brathwaite played at that one, though he tried to pretend otherwise"
"forward once more, head over the ball, defended down the pitch"
left alone outside off to complete another solid over
"<B>whoosh!</B> Campbell gets a touch cocky as Anderson flings one out wide, and misses with a woolly drive"
"squirted into the covers, another sharp single"
through to the keeper once again

"wider line, curling away, through to the keeper"
driven compactly to cover

"outside off, curling away, left alone once more"
"nipping into the bat from a full length, Brathwaite is waiting on the back foot to block"
"<B>big nip once more!</B> Thoughts about a review as this one thumps the pad, but Anderson reckons it's going over leg stump"

"banged in short, Brathwaite turns turtle. The first bouncer of the morning"
"wider line, and through to the keeper"
"full length from round the wicket, stabbed down into the crease"

"full length from round the wicket again, defended back down the pitch"
"attempted drive, into the covers"
"outside off, wider line and big outswing. Taken in front of second slip by a diving Foakes"

"back of a length, climbing through to the keeper"
"forward in defence, and pushed to the leg side"
"full length, aggressive line, defended once more"
"outside off, and that's a <B>ripper!</B> Climbing off the pitch and beats the outside edge!"
"through to the keeper, and that's the end of a hugely encouraging first hour for West Indies. Runs for Campbell, stoicism from Brathwaite, and just a touch of frustration for England"
"pitched up from round the wicket, Campbell gets a thickish edge driving and it squirts to fine leg"
"round the wicket, ducked by Brathwaite"
"woof, that's a snorter! Short again but not obviously so and Brathwaite was coming forwards, had to jerk his hands and head out of the way at the last moment"
"goes full on the pads, worked across the line and it runs to square leg"
"angling in with the arm, down the leg side as Brathwaite shuffles into line"
"hits a length, this rears up as the batsman comes forward, defused down into the leg side"
lets go a full toss to start with and Jennings has to think about going into his shell - or maybe pulling off another blinder - as Campbell gets down low and paddles a couple fine
"floated up and swept powerfully in front of square, <b>belted through midwicket for four!</b> Campbell's not going to let Moeen settle"
"ooh, <b>that's top-edgy, looping into the leg side...</b> but safe! Bit ungainly that time, trying to sweep but the line was wide of off stump and turning away - Campbell gets away with one"
pushed through flatter and steered into the midwicket region for a single
"over the wicket, flat on middle and off, clipped to mid-on"
pushed through and met solidly on the front foot by Brathwaite
"pitched up and <b>sizzled through the covers for another boundary!</b> Easy, breezy from the new boy, confidently strutting poolside in his mankini"
"short and at the body, Campbell drops back and swats round the corner for a couple"
lets this one go in the channel
comes across and flicks to the leg side
"short ball, 80mph and it doesn't get up that much, pulled for one"
"Stokes was bluffing, sends it full and wide... <b>and Brathwaite slices his first boundary to third man!</b> Things running away from England here"
"flighted, dipping as Campbell sweeps, skids into the pads - <b>given!</b> Campbell perishes by the sword! He consults with his partner before trudging off, DRS won't save him here. Moeen was a little loose in his first opener, but he's found his length and prised out the first wicket of the day"

presses forward and defends this time
"bit slower and loopier, met on the front foot and stroked to cover"

"shortish length, defended with soft hands"
"pitched up and met coming forwards, full face of the bat"
shuffles on to the front foot and steers one in front of point
"booming inswinger from Stokes, full outside off and it comes back a long way, Hope thinks about driving but ultimately plays inside the line"
"short of a length, nipping back as Hope stays in the crease, takes it on the thigh pad"
"dug in, slightly wide on the crease, 133kph/81mph and Hope watches it through"
"fractionally overpitched and <b>that's spanked through the covers!</b> Brathwaite gets a second boundary, skipping out nimbly to hit against the spin"
uses the feet and works through mid-on
"takes on the arm at mid-on, Hope has to hurry... <b>but Root's throw is off target!</b> Think he might have made it home anyway"
floated up and pushed in front of point
"on the charge again, <b>boshed over deep midwicket!</b> High and handsome from Brathwaite, belying his reputation as a blocker... Bairstow was out in the deep but hadn't a hope of getting near it as the ball plopped beyond the rope"
tossed up and tapped away
"full, in the slot, <b>laced back past mid-off for four more!</b> Princely stroke from Hope, picks up his first boundary with a textbook straight drive"
"fullish and met coming forwards again, not the timing on the drive"
"banged in short, he ducks to the off side as it sails through"
"length, 134kph/82mph over middle and off, Hope shows it a straight bat"
"another bumper, 139kph/87mph and aiming for Hope's left ear... ducked again"
dug in short but veering harmlessly leg side
"flat on middle stump, tucked down on the back foot"
"tossed up and shovelled over the leg side, in front of Biarstow at deep midwicket and it bounces away for four... he was aiming straight, nearly undone by some turn, but he gets the reward this time"

"length ball, pushed in on the stumps and nudged to leg"

"floated up outside off stump, Hope steers one through cover point"
"round the wicket, flat on middle and leg, Brathwaite knocks it safely into the turf"
"floated up full, driven back to the bowler on the bounce"
"good length in the channel from Stokes, met with a firm push towards cover"
"full again, Hope doesn't need a second invite, <b>steps out and strokes it through mid-off</b> - that's a beautiful shot for four! Although Stokes might not like the look of it so much"
"good length, defended softly around off stump"
"head-hunting bouncer, Hope ducks"
"length but wide of the stumps and shaping away, left alone"

"tossed up, full and juicy outside off, driven into the wide open acres for one more"
"flat and dabbed behind point off the back foot, good strike rotation from these two"
"looped up full on off, clipped to mid-on who's slightly set back"
"flighted, again Hope's bottom hand comes through as he punches with a flourish to Root at deep mid-on - hit it too well, really"
"flighted, spinning outside off and defended"
gets on to the front foot and taps back

"pushed through, bunted back to the bowler"
"floated up nice and full on off, Brathwaite plays a controlled drive to mid-off - and tucks his bat under his arm, that'll be <b>lunch</b>"
"popping from a good length, stabbed out to point"

"<B>A big swish, a big nick, a tumbling take</B>, and West Indies' resistance is over! A massive mow over the leg-side, Hetmyer decided it was time to go big or go home, and Stokes' swing does enough to find the edge. Four for him. Five for Anderson. The rest ... not so much ..."

"into line once again to defend, rapped on the thighpad by some extra nip off the deck"

A scorcher from Roach, takes Moeen completely by surprise as he flicks a loose defensive bat across the line... a massive top-edge spirals down to Joseph at fine leg, who reverse-cups his hands to claw the ball back and keep himself in play at the same time!"
"outside off, no hat-trick, but what an over! Bridgetown is <I>leaping</I>. I swear it was mostly England fans in the crowd, but the home support are making themselves known!"
Holder plugs away once more on a good length outside off. Solid in defence
<B>beaten outside off once more!</B> Every ball's a coconut right now... as Buttler flinches his gloves
"speared into the pads, a run-out really wouldn't help England's cause! But they are safely home"
forward and defended
forward and driven back to the bowler
on the pads and nurdled to the leg side. It's a grind now for England
"<B>banged in short, and there goes another!</B> This is mayhem! Short and fast, tight to the body and bruising the edge of a defensive blade! Roach has five in the blink of an eye, and ...well, this is extraordinary! England are a rocking, rolling, Roach-ridden mess!"
"round the wicket to Big Sam, the No. 9 shuffles across and plays safely inside the line"
"good length, nipping away a fraction as Curran has a bit of a yahoo, swing and a miss... Risky"
"banged in short, veering down the leg side, gives Dowrich something to do"
"length in the channel, rising outside off and pushed square"
"bit of width, Curran has a dip... <b>flashed for four over the cordon!</b> Runs for England, but streaky ones - edging them (literally) past the 50 mark"
"short ball, Foakes swats a pull in the air, but short of mid-on and they scamper through"
"pitched up and lashed through the covers, <b>Curran latches on and belts four more!</b> Well, this is what he's in the team for"
"hits a length around off stump, Curran shows it a straight bat"
dug in short and tucked off the hip

tucked into a gap for another single
"rising from a length, more awkward angles from Roach, defended off the splice"
"wide on the crease, pitched up and nipping away as Foakes ventures a drive, beaten past the outside edge"
"digs this one in short, looping over the ducking Foakes"
"hits a length, 133kph/82mph and Foakes defends"
jumps back and across and steers the ball to point
"angling in towards middle and leg, clipped towards midwicket - another maiden for Roach"
"short of a length, nudged off the hip through backward square leg"
"pitched up, draws him out, <b>and kisses the outside edge through to Dowrich!</b> West Indies have wicket No. 8, and it's a joyous one for Joseph, his first since the Dominica Test of 2017! That's all, Foakes"
full and blocked around off stump
"touch shorter, Rashid gets front on and defends stoutly"
"ooh, ripper, <b>scoots through past the outside edge!</b> Not much Rashid could do about that"
"beautiful line, speared in at 136kph/85mph and then seaming away as Rashid pokes unsuccessfully once again"
"round the wicket, pitched up and tapped away to the off side"
"full in the channel, gets him driving, squirts low towards backward point"
"shortish, 129kph/80mph as Roach dredges his reserves, Curran blocks"
comes across on off stump
"touch short, wide of the stumps and Curran throws the bat, again fails to connect"
"slightly back of a length, stabbed towards point"
"whippage from Rashid, all bottom hand as he scoops four over midwicket with a casual flick"
"four more, <b>spanked through point...!</b> overpitched by Joseph and Rashid lets those rubber wrists go twang! once again"
"better length on off, Rash defends this time"
fired in straight and tapped to the leg side
"length, swinging away as Rashid hangs back, no stroke"
"in the channel, holding its line as Rashid comes across and steers to point"
"round the wicket, jammed in short and Curran defends up on his toes"

"too full, 137kph/85mph outside off, eminently driveable and that's just what Curran does, pinged to the long-off boundary"
"length ball, tapped down towards backward point"
short but the line is outside off and Curran can duck it easily enough
"<b>that's a beauty to finish!</b> Fired in at 144kph/89mph and straightening just a smidgen from back of a length, whistles past the outside edge with Curran hanging back"
"fullish, stabbed square from the crease"
"that's a good line, curving in and away at 144kph as Joseph warms to his task"
"better still, <b>beats the bat as Rashid gropes around his front pad!</b> Sharp movement away as he tried to work across the line"
"goes wide on the crease, pitched up and driven without timing to extra cover"
"length ball, pushed down the leg side as Rash comes across"
"<b>dropped!</b> Right on the fingertips for Holder, at second slip... Joseph found the outside edge and it went fast and low, <b>the captain unable to hold on as it died in front of him!</b> First blot on the Windies' copybook in the field, thought it was a toughie"
"pitched up and driven, Gabriel gets a hand on it in his follow-through"
"banged in short, 142kph/88mph and zipping through as Curran ducks"
"another bumper, Curran is down early and the ball then swings violently on its way through to the keeper"
"full around off stump, punched square"
"chin music (although on Curran it's up around the ears), <b>balloons off the glove to be caught at gully!</b> There'll be no rescue act from Big Sam today! Gabriel gets among the wickets with a bonce-bothering short ball, and England are in all sorts of strife"
"back of a length, Anderson hops tentatively into line and rides the bounce"
"full and straight, Rashid flicks impishly around the corner for a boundary to fine leg"
"short ball, in the channel... <b>and Rashid steers it tamely to slip!</b> England have been rumbled, blown away between lunch and tea for their <b>fourth-lowest total against West Indies</b>; Rashid far from the most culpable but a soft dismissal nevertheless, Holder reaching across with those bucket hands to nab the edge this time"
"outside off, through to the keeper, lovely shape as it bends from back of a length past the edge"
"up on the toes, fencing the ball down into the pitch"
"lovely line, bending from leg stump to middle, Brathwaite squared up a touch on leg"
short and wide and<strong> slapped to the rope!</strong> Can't bowl there... even if you're an England legend
nudged into the leg side to jog off the strike
firmly onto the front foot and head over the ball
"outside off, keeps low and skitters through to the keeper"

"outside off, swinging away this time, and through to the keeper"
"not even really short, but that was dispatched from the moment it left the hand! Front leg in the air, a la Gordon Greenidge, and <B>whipped imperiously through midwicket!</B>"
"two slips and a gully, as Anderson finds big hoop away from the left-hander"
"well bowled, big arcing swing from just outside off, on a full length, and Campbell is drawn into a loose drive"
"<B>perfection!</B> On middle and leg, and bursting through the top of the deck, past the outside edge of bat and off stump! Can't lay a bat on those"
"similar delivery but a fraction shorter, so easier to line up and leave alone in the channel outside off"
"<B>massive inswinger!</B> Anderson plays his two-card trick to near-perfection and though Umpire Gaffaney says no, England <B>review</B>. To the naked eye it might have done too much .. indeed, <strong>it's sliding down leg</strong>. Close, but no cigar!"
"on the pads, tucked square. A fine, fine over."
tip and run into the off side
"back of a length, and dabbed gently into the off side"
squeezed into the covers once more. Curran is getting a little tight to the danger zone in his followthrough ...
"on the pads, nudged to the leg side"
"squeezed off the front foot, midwicket gathers"
"flicked off the hip out to square leg. Pretty run-of-the-mill from Curran so far. Poor chap, he's been hung out to dry by circumstances"
"wider line, through to the keeper"
"outside off, swinging from leg to off, but too wide to tempt a stroke"
"firmly forward, and pressed down the pitch"
"another big outswinger, but nothing doing there"
"sliding down leg this time as Anderson attempts to bring this one back in, but gets his line wrong"
angled across once again. Campbell lines it up and lets it go
"full length, stabbed back to the bowler who shies in his followthrough"
outside off. Through to the keeper
"outside off, just back of a length, defended into the off side"
"<B>edged, but short!</B> Better from Curran, but played with good soft hands"

very full and swinging away from the left-hander

"on the pads, nudged round the corner with a flick of the wrists"
"back of a length, angling in, and tucked to the leg side"
"round the wicket from Curran and immediately he's on a better line, bending into the right-hander and spearing into the toes"
"back of a length, and defended back down the pitch. Attacking the stumps now which is much better from Curran"
"this is good now from Curran, zeroing in on the base of middle and off from round the wicket, and stabbed to cover"
"banged in short, and Brathwaite ducks"
"curling in towards the timbers once again, and fended to the leg side. Probing stuff"
"full length, angling in, pressed into the gap at mid-off, and through they jog"
"urgh... that's a revolting pie. The Greggs vegan sausage roll of looseners. High outside off, and wafted to cover. Rooobish cricket!"
"better line this time, dipping into the batsman and defended"
pushed calmly into the covers off the front foot to rotate the strike
fully forward and defended back down the track
"a hint of turn and bounce from a full length, Brathwaite walks inside the angle and nudges to leg"
firmly forward and blocked
"round the wicket, curling in, lifting off the deck and pushed to cover"
tucked off the toes out to deep square leg
"firmly forward and eased into the covers. Soporific accumulation from West Indies, which is exactly as they'd have planned it"
"wafted off the toes, out to midwicket. A bit dismissive really, as Curran's lack of pace allows ample time to line up the stroke"
"on the back foot, tight to the off stump from over the wicket. Blocked"
"pushed hard out to point, meeting the swing away from the left-hander with a full face"
"<B>battered into the stands!</B> Campbell has no desire to let Moeen settle, down on one knee as Moeen offerrs him too much room outside off, and a mighty smear over midwicket!"
"another flog-sweep, in front of square, reaches the midwicket sweeper at a rate of knots"
"over the wicket now to the right-hander, onto the front foot, and pushed back to the bowler"
"nudged to the leg side, leaning into the stroke"
"on the back foot, shuffling into line to defend"
"fully forward, and defended"
"that familiar shape from the outset, curling across the left-hander and poked to cover"
"down the leg-side, a stifled appeal as the ball appears to flick something, but I reckon that's thighpad, and so does the umpire"
"better line, very tight to off, and a good leave, reading the swing and letting it go"
"<strong>short, pulled, spliced, but safe!</strong> Intent from Campbell, but Stokes' bouncer was quicker than he'd bargained for! Moeen back-pedalled at mid-off, but never got close"
"full length, swing, blocked back to the bowler"
"big appeal from Stokes once more, but a touch leg-sided as Campbell is squared up on a full length"
"full length, dug out, to the covers"
"stabbed into the off side, solid line and length"
"bounce from back of a length, pressed into the leg side"
"working with the slight hint of turn, but can't time a leg glance"
"stretching forward, full face of the bat this time"
"looped up to the blockhole, solidly defended"
"angled onto the front foot, punched down to deep point"
"back of a length, hitting the deck hard to keep Jennings interested under the lid. Fenced in front of square on the leg side"
"banged in short, and that is flinched away, a little bit reminiscent of Moeen's first-baller. But Brathwaite gets enough bat through the ball to clear short leg and pick off the single"
"thinks about a wallop, leaves well alone"
"banged in short, and hoisted out to the leg side. Once again, Stokes' bouncer hustles through quicker than anticipated. No-one catching by the square leg umpire but that wasn't comfortably played"
fully into line and pushed back down the pitch
"round the wicket, wafted to the leg side"
"<B>swept beautifully out through square leg!</B> Quite a straight line, but picked up from outside off so no danger of the lbw, and utterly nailed"
"into the toes, clipped to leg"
"firmly forward, full face of the bat. Gathered at square leg"
"prodded uppishly to midwicket, and an easy single. This is excellent from West Indies, and the lead is growing steadily"
blotted away to see off another over
"full length, hint of swing, pushed to mid-off"
"<B>well bowled!</B> Jagging sharply past the outside edge, maybe a touch short to snag it, but it looked dramatic!"
fully forward and eased into the off side
squeezed out to the off side
"soft hands outside off, riding the bounce as the ball ends up in the gully"
"a lovely measured punch down the ground to bring up the fifty stand. Another fine start, after their first-innings efforts"
shoulders arms outside off
"back of a length, short enough to have a swat. Out to point"
fully forward and defended to the leg side
swished off the hip out to the leg side
<B>pinned on the pads and England have their breakthrough!</B> Absolutely plumb as Brathwaite was caught playing across the line to a back-of-a-length slider. Into the shins and there's no point reviewing that!
"solidly forward, head over the ball. Blocked back down the pitch"
"a swishy whoosh outside off stump, big outswinger from Stokes, and through to the keeper"
"movement from the hand once more, no stroke offered as Campbell shoulders arms"
"on the pads, flicked fine"
punched out to the covers
"short and sharp, and jabbed off an outside edge, down through third man. Good intent from Stokes, who doesn't believe in lost causes"

"round the wicket, swished uppishly out the leg side"
"pushed deeper into the crease, and defended off the back foot"
"firmly onto the front foot, and pressed back to the bowler"

"<B>pop from a good length!</B> That's more encouraging from Moeen, but the ball dies inches short of Stokes at slip"
nudged off the pads out to the leg side
"on the pads, and tucked to the leg side"
"<strong>short, filthy, and slapped straight to cover!</strong> That's some of the worst cricket of the day, a wild wide bouncer from round the wicket, which ended up with Stokes tripping over his own feet. But Campbell was through the looping half-tracker too early and toe-ended to Keaton Jennings!"
"short of a length, veering in from round the wicket, Bravo lets it go"
"dug in and nudged off the body, gets off the mark behind square"
"oi, oi... back of a length, rising rapidly past the outside edge, Brathwaite back in the crease. One for the cameras"
"touch short again, Brathwaite stabs this towards point"
"tossed up, round the wicket and straightening, defended on the front foot"
"flighted, grips and clips the edge, <b>snapped up low at slip!</b> England have another! Bravo's forgettable comeback continues, lured forward by Moeen's dip and then steering limply to the hovering Stokes"
"full and sliding in from over the wicket, Chase steps out and clips to midwicket"
"pushed through, goes on to take the outside edge - <b>two in three balls for Moeen!</b> Chase props forward anticipating some turn, but there was none, the ball deflecting straight off the edge to that man Stokes again! Lummy"
"tossed up, spinning sharply as Hetmyer thrusts out a leg... Foakes was appealing, but I'm not entirely sure what for"
"flighted, spinning away as the batsman shoulders arms again... but Stokes is adamant the ball brushed the glove as Hetmyer put his dukes up, and England <b>review</b>; has Moeen got another? Kumar Dharmasena, the third umpire, runs the replays back and forth but there's nothing on Snicko, looked to be a little daylight between ball and glove. On we go"
"shortish, Hope shuffles across and taps it down"
"rising off a length, thuds into the bat and then pad, <b>Jennings grabs it at short leg!</b> Stokes roars, Jennings roars, England have ripped out another! Hope's head drops, he has to go, done by some extra bounce and seam movement in... How's your nerve, Windies fans?"
"length ball, Dowrich gets dutifully into line"
"shortish, defended up on his toes in front of off stump"
"dug in and worked around the corner, England have a leg gully lurking and he cleans up"
"short of a length, slightly wide and Dowrich lets it go"
"angled in from round the wicket, tapped away"
tossed up on the stumps and defended
"flatter, Hetmyer goes back in the crease and nudges to leg"
"flighted, here comes the Hetmyer of the first innings, launched inside out over cover but it won't quite run all the way"
punched back to the bowler
"very full, <b>almost yorks him</b>, Hetmyer jamming his bat down with his feet in a tangle... Moeen goes up for lbw, but Chris Gaffaney shakes his head"
"Stokes bangs the ball in, defended on the back foot"
"tight lines, again Dowrich is across and blocking stoutly"
"slings the ball down fuller, but it goes on with the arm down the leg side"
"dug in, climbing outside off stumps, gets on top of it in defence"
"dug in, and met with some fire by Dowrich! The keeper rocks back, <b>batters a pull away over midwicket</b>, that'll race into the unguarded part of the outfield"
"and again, <b>superb timing off the pads</b>, picks up four more! Valuable runs for West Indies"
"Hetmyer gets stuck in, <b>slammed back over long-off!</b> Ice in his veins, lines up Moeen and <i>creams</i> a trademark lofted drive down the ground"
"Moeen spears it in full, jammed down in defence"
flicked off the legs for a single
"and now Dowrich goes downtown, <b>smeared over long-on for six more!</b> Tossed up and smoked"
"pushed through flatter, Dowrich blocks"
floated up and defended calmly on off stump
"full, outside leg stump... <b>and chipped over wide long-on</b>, just a couple of bounces to the rope! More moxy from Hetmyer, a flowing straight bat, Stokes can only laugh to himself in disbelief"
"bangs this in short, momentarily has him off balance before he ducks out of the way"
"back of a length in the corridor outside off, left alone"
"dug in short, Hetmyer sways out of the way"

"back of a length, over the top of off and defended from the crease"
"dug in again, Dowrich is up on his toes, riding the bounce like an experienced cow poke"
"short ball, at the body, tapped down safely in front of short leg"
"angled in and bouncing up off the pad, half an appeal for lbw or a catch at short leg... but there was no bat involved"
"flighted, a touch leg side and shovelled away, picks out backward square leg"
presses forward to block on off stump
"full and leg side again, big swing from Hetmyer but I don't think he connected as the ball scurries away past Foakes"
floated up and worked off the pads
"flighted, outside off and met with a flowing cover drive, wide of the man at long-off for a couple"
"short from Stokes, outside off and Dowrich gets up on his tippy-toes to ride the bounce once again"
"banged in, veering leg side as he comes across and throws his hands up"
"another bumper, this is at an awkward height and Dowrich doesn't want to play, ends up jabbing at it reflexively at the last moment, rather than wear it on the chest"
"snorting bouncer from Stokes, nearly scones Dowrich as he tries to jump and duck at the same time!"
hammered in and again Dowrich weaves out of the way
"banged in short, a touch leg side and Dowrich manages to punch it away safely behind square"

"round the wicket, drops in a half-tracker which Hetmyer hauls through midwicket, there's a man out in the deep for protection"
"full and tempting... <b>but Hetmyer has flubbed it to point!</b> Bit of an anticlimactic way to go, considering Hetmyer has been tonking it all around the park. Buttler holds on this time, having dropped the same batsman in the first innings"

"length ball in the channel, 123kph/76mph and left alone"
"full, squirreling in towards the pads, <b>England go up for lbw...</b> Rod Tucker shakes his head! Was there some bat? Doesn't seem to be on replay, hit the back leg and probably would have shaved leg stump. England don't have any reviews, though"
Holder comes across and leaves outside off

"shortish outside off, no stroke"

short and defended on the back foot
"full length, driven coming forwards, picks out extra cover"

"short and wide, and Burns has been brilliant at seizing on the loose ones! Clattered with intent through point, and he marches into the 30s"
"cracked through the covers once more, but Campbell pounces well to cut off the back-to-back fours"
"whoops, that's wide, going wider. And called, funnily enough, wide"
"<em>much </em>better. Tight to off stump, turning away"

"on the toes, pushed back up the pitch"

"pressing back into the crease, eased on the up to cover"
short and wafted out through backward point
clipped into the leg side
squeezed out to point. Decent plugging but no great penetration. Three overs left on another remarkable day
"defended down to mid-on, back of the length and lifting into the blade"
"on the pads, and that's another firm clip. Lots to be impressed about Burns' progress this evening. He's been busy but composed"
"vertical bat, fended away"
"skiddy lift from back of a length, pressed back down the pitch"
"wider on the crease and <B>scudding into the pads!</B> Did it pitch outside leg, Holder reckons so, to Joseph's chagrin.He is spot on"
"forward, and <strong>punched very sweetly through long-of</strong>f. Up comes the fifty stand, and Burns has the lion's share of that"
full-faced defence
"pushed with lots of bottom hand into the covers, Jennings moves into double-figures"
""
"fuller and tighter, asking more questions now"
"good areas once again, plugging away from round the wicket"

<B>good start!</B> Dobbed onto a good length and gets Jennings in two minds
"looped up a bit wider, Alex Hales-lite delivery, but more action on the ball and a bit of turn"
"<B>big turn!</B> Too wide, but hmmm ... interesting"
"this one slides on outside off.,. this is good all-sorts stuff"
left alone with a touch more turn. Three men on the off side
<B>a grubber out of the footholes!</B> Nutmegs Dowrich and skitters to the rope. More Campbell please!
"outside off, a bit of turn. England have done the needful tonight, but they are not the story"
"hits the pitch hard from round the wicket, looking for the slightest sign of misbehaviour... Burns blocks diligently coming across"
"length delivery, 139kph/86mph but wide enough for him to leave well alone"

full and sliding in as Burns crabs across and clips down to fine leg for the first run of the day
"full and curling away, quite a wide line but Burns thought about following it"
"reaches for the drive, <b>flashed in the air between gully and slip!</b> Not the most wise shot from Burns, the ball full and swinging, but he gets away with it - and picks up four, too"
"fullish, definite movement for Roach, full and bending away as Burns watches it through"
"full, 134kph/83mph, covers the line and tapped back down the track"

full and pushed into the covers
"over the wicket to Jennings, touch short in the channel, lets it go"
"back of a length and swinging away as it passes the batsman, Hope has to earn his corn behind the stumps"
"testing line from Gabriel, just leaving Jennings enough to induce doubt, <i>think</i> he just realised in time and withdrew his bat"
"straighter, 139kph/86mph and tucked to the leg side"
"rund for Jennings now, won't quite go all the way, but he's played this well off the back foot, riding the bounce and guiding through point"
"fullish, Burns bat comes scissoring down at an angle, squeezed towards backward point via a low edge"
"pitched up, holding its line as Jennings gets out and shoulders arms"
"fractionally closer, fourth/fifth stump, but well-judged and left again"
"full, shaping away fro round the wicket at 130kph/80mph, no stroke from Jennings"

"tighter to the off stump, hurled down and straightening a touch, blocked firmly into the covers"
pitched up but wide in the corridor and left alone

"fuller, stroked towards cover coming forwards"
"full on the pads, clipped in business-like fashion in front of square, there's a man out there but they'll come back for two, <b>Burns raising his second fifty in Tests</b> - just a wave of the bat, then back to scratch out his mark again"
"short and worked off the hip, the ball runs fine and they scamper through for two"
"short, flying through at chest height outside off, Burns drops his hands"
"pitched up, 136kph/84mph and that's a pretty driveable pace, <b>Burns dispatches the half-volley through extra cover</b> and England continue to tick over"
"that's the line for Kemar, full and nibbling a fraction, Jennings manages to just get forward enough to blunt it back down the track"
"angled in and holding its line, Jennings presses forward to defend again"
"fullish length, 84mph and tapped to cover"

"short and punched square from the crease, without timing"
"full, driven behind square, off the toe of the bat and taken one-handed by the diving Hetmyer... he enquires of the umpire, too, but that was a bump ball"
"length, slightly wide, Burns leaves"
"not all that short but Burns is across, staying low and he dabs a late cut past gully, in control and picks up four - <b>England pass their first-innings effort of 77</b>, which isn't saying that much, really"

"length, 134kph/83mph and defended with bat tight to front pad"
"plugging away in the corridor, no stroke"
"sends down a tempter, Jennings' resolve breaks... <b>and he slashes a thick-edged drive to slip!</b> Holder grabs it, needed to be a tall man, with the ball still going up as he made the leap to his left from second. Joseph makes the breakthrough in his first over of the day - first wicket since Thursday evening!"
"length ball, this spits to hit glove/bat handle, pops into the on side... No short leg in place, else that could have been a chance"
"over the wicket, shortish around off stump and defended... Holder has overstepped with his first delivery"

"fired in around fourth stump, defended back towards the bowler"
"wide on the crease and angled in, nipping through as YJB leaves alone"

shuffles into line and lets this one go
"length ball, 126kph/78mph and defended on off"
comes forward and taps watchfully back down the track

"full and probing, angled into off stump and nudged up the pitch to mid-on"
standing tall on the back foot to defend

defended back up the pitch
"clipped airily off the toes, that was sweetly timed, but short midwicket was well placed"
"<B>a glorious piece of timing!</b> Just punched out into the gap in the covers, well hunted down on the edge of the rope, but that's the 100 up. It's progress!"
whistling through to the keeper once again
"cut firmly out to point, and half stopped by Chase. Good fielding, but Holder is erring too short... not heeding his own advice last night to pitch it up and risk the drive"
"there is the drive, but it was a bit of an outswinging half-volley, Bairstow finds the gap in the covers, but not the crisp timing that he usually locates"
defended back down the pitch
"much fuller this time, but swinging away as Bairstow leaves"
"thumped firmly off the back foot into the covers, an awkward bobble but well enough stopped in the end"
"full face of the bat, pumped back to the bowler who deflects onto the non-striker's stumps. Burns was safely anchored in the crease"
"tapped into the covers, on the front foot"
"speared out wide, on a very full length, Burns reaches for the drive, as he's enjoying putting bat on ball at the moment, but can't time it"
solidly blocked back down the track
"striding onto the front foot, there's a lot to admire about Burns' approach at the moment. Punched to short cover"
"good sharp delivery, a touch quicker, and Burns rocks back in surprise as he plays late outside off"
fully forward and pushed to the off side
"on the pads, and<strong> flicked very sweetly through square leg</strong>. A touch too short from Roach, and easy pickings"
"too short, too wide, and <strong>clobbered through point!</strong> Nope, Windies aren't feeling it just at the moment. This is good from England"
"fuller length, but still half a yard shorter than his wrecking-ball length on day two. Angled in and worked to the leg side"
"<B>pops off a leading edge!</B> A bit more nip from Roach, as Bairstow closes his face too soon. That's more lively, but point is too deep to capitalise"
that's another freebie for a batsman of Bairstow's calibre! Boshed through point as Roach gets his lines wrong again
tightens up outside off. A leaky over with a hint of threat
solidly blocked on off stump
"another flowing drive, but straight to cover"
back and across to defend
"<B>edged and safe!</B> Yikes, Burns' intent almost gets the better of him this time as a thick outside edge skews past Holder at second slip. Third slip would have swallowed it!"
no stroke offered this time from the chastened Burns
firmly forward and pushed back down the pitch
solidly behind the line to defend
"<B>that's the line!</B> Outside off, jagging away, skittering past the edge with good carry"
"up on the toes, poked to the off side"
"on the pads, whittled through midwicket and Bairstow is in a hurry. Perhaps he's got a boat to catch too!"
"solidly onto the front foot, and punched to cover"
no stroke offered to finish the over
fully forward and defended into the covers
"gosh, that's taken off! Banged in short outside off and leaping through to the keeper"
"wide line once more, fuller length. Left alone"
"prodded into the off side, better length"
"a bit of swing, over the wicket to the left-hander, pressed up the pitch to mid-on"

"outside off, cracked to point"
"better line and length, on off stump and drawing a solid defence"

"pokey defence, into the cordon"
"back of a length, tight line, poked off the back foot with a bit a late shuffle of feet"
"up on the toes, riding the bounce, and deflected into the leg side"
"excellent stop by Hope, the substitute keeper, pouncing well on a very fine leg glance as Joseph speared in a leg-side yorker"
short and a swished pull to midwicket. Well stopped again
"leaning onto the front foot, that's a good full length, just what the skipper ordered"
"swivelled into the leg side, pirouetting in the crease, but without any massive intent"
<strong>that's a glorious way to welcome the new bowler!</strong> Timed the pants off a clumping great clip through the infield. Races away to the wide long-on boundary
"good riposte, ripping through a bit more urgently"
forward to meet the pitch and worked up to the bowler
"eased with the spin into the leg side, a single ensues"
"<B>bowled him!</B> That's the ticket for West Indies, round the wicket, and Burns - with three close catchers on the off side - was cautious of committing to the front foot. Trapped on the crease, the ball slid on and wriggled into the off stump, and well, that's the way to make your lunch taste better!"
"drops touch short from over the wicket, Root dabs it down into a gap and scampers through to get off the mark"
"shortish, coming in from outside off, blocked"
"angled in with the arm, Root stays back and defends"
"rapid bumper, Root takes his eye off it - <b>and gloves to slip!</b> Lots of whooping around the ground... but hang on, it's A NO-BALL!! Big one, too. The West Indian celebrations are immediately drowned out by Barmy Army jeers, as Root turns around and skips back to his crease, grasping the extra life"
"fired in back of a length, defended to the on side"
"short of a length, blocked on off stump"
"dug in, this spits at Root, again he's fending out in front of him, manages to glove this one down into the turf! Hot stuff"
"another snorter, <b>smashes into the gloves but loops safely down the leg side!</b> Root is taking heavy fire, but he survives the bombardment, for now..."
"pushed through from over the wicket, YJB defends"
"floated up outside off, Bairstow goes down to paddle sweep, hit on the pad and there's half an appeal... think he was outside the line"
worked off the legs going back in the crease
"shortish, Root drops back to cut one square"
"very full, this dips to hit the front pad as Bairstow flicks across the line... the ball then ends up at slip, Chase appealing all the way down to the other end of the pitch! Did Bairstow get some bat on it? West Indies decide to <b>review</b>, having a bob each way... No bat, according to Snickometer, and this looks to be outside the line, too. Yep, he was far enough across, pretty much yorked himself, <b>but the on-field decision stands</b>"
tossed up and tapped away
"banged in short at 145kph but Root is up on his toes, <b>flaying four through point!</b> Fire met with a burst of autocannon!"
"back of a length, defended over off stump"
"banged in, 140+ again from Gabriel, blocked back towards the bowler"
"back of a length outside off, pushed into the covers and Root gets off strike"
"short and veering leg side, <b>tickled to the keeper!</b> Gabriel has bombed out Bairstow instead! Seems to be no question about the front foot this time, YJB heading off with his bat under his arm... Clearly got some glove on it, fast and furious towards the ribs, banged in and bounced out"
gets into line and pokes defensively back down the pitch
"ooh, slips this one past the outside edge"
"angled in, not much turn as Root defends"
tossed up and tapped into the covers
"flat offbreak, goes back on off stump and blocks"
"fuller, flicked towards midwicket"
lobbed up wide of the off stump and Root drops back ushers it through to the keeper
"short of a length, Stokes let it go"
"dug in, this squares up Stokes as he goes to defend on the back foot, the ball deflects to slip off his thigh pad, I think"
"pitched fuller, wide of the stumps and left alone"
"barrels to the crease and hits the middle of the pitch, Stokes gets across to block"
"drops short, doesn't get up all that high and Stokes is able to swing away a pull for his first run"
"dug in but again lacking some oomph, Root swivels to pull and Roach then makes a hash of a diving stop at fine leg to gift him four"
floated up and dabbed for one
"Root steps out and drives to long-on, <b>brings up the England 150</b>"
plunges forward to defend on off stump
"flighted, again Stokes gets a stride in and blocks"
"tossed up a touch wide, lets this one spin through"
"full on off, Stokes plays around it... <b>given!</b> He's got completely in a tangle, but asks for a <b>review</b>, which turns out to be very sensible, as he had smashed it into his front pad! Clear inside edge and <b>the decision is overturned!</b> All going off, except for Stokes, who remains"
"pitched up and whipped through backward square, they come back for three"
"low full toss from Gabriel, that's a 149kph thunderbolt that Stokes manages to mistime into his front leg! Gabriel glares, and Stokes squints back down the pitch. Could have gone anywhere, that"
"better length, wide of the stumps and left alone"
"belted back down the ground, Stokes trading blows with the big man... and Gabriel is left on his haunches, seemingly in some pain"
"wide full toss, 145kph and Stokes blinks and misses it"
lobbed up and defended to the leg side
pushed through outside off stump
comes across and taps back down the track

back of a length and defended on off

comes across and taps the ball down
"tempts him forward, full and floaty but <b>Stokes plays a spawny prod</b> and is lucky not to nick off!"
"floated up and blocked on the front foot, head bowed"
"flatter delivery, Root is on the back foot and slices one through backward point"
"Chase goes round the wicket, fires it in on the pads, deflected away square"
"tossed up outside off, Stokes goes back to cut but picks out backward point"
angled in and this is clipped away off the pads for a single
"floated up full, defended coming forwards"
"sliding across the left-hander from over the wicket, Stokes refrains from following it"
steps into line and lets it go
"pitched up, Stokes wants a piece of this, <b>flashes a drive and is beaten!</b> Maybe kept a touch low out of the rough, but that was a wild swipe, bat coming across at an angle"
pushes this back down the track
"pitched up in the channel, Stokes goes back to leaving"
"<b>suckered him again!</b> Perfect length from Holder, not quite there for the drive but Stokes can't resist throwing his hands through it... past the edge and into the gloves!"
"wheeling away, defended on off"
Root comes down and punches to long-on
"ooh, <b>close to the outside edge again!</b> Attempting to drive from the rough, Hope did well to take it low, then managed to whip off the bails as well"

pitched up and punched along the ground to mid-on
stays back and lets this one go outside off
"tossed up on the stumps, Stokes makes room and clips down the ground through mid-on"
"flighted, drifting in and worked to leg, can't get it past midwicket"
"oh dear, Root's on the fritz - <b>steered straight to slip!</b> Nothing delivery, bouncing up outside off, and he's given Bravo catching practice! He survived once, thanks to a no-ball, but the captain is back in the sheds now, and West Indies' victory window just got wider"
pushed right back onto the stumps first-up. Full and tight length
"stretching forward this time, but a probing off-stump line once more"

"forward and dug out, probing length"
pressed with a full face out to short cover
clipped into the leg side
"dropped a bit too short and wide, and slapped urgently out through the off side"
"<B>so close!</B> Not sure how Buttler managed not to nick that. Played inside the line of a ball that spun back in, and <I>just</i> scraped past the edge, and the off stump"
"round the wicket, banged into the deck outside off. Left alone"
"full face of the bat, punched to mid-off"
"short-arm pull, out to the leg side. Controlled stroke"

"better from Roach, fuller, straighter, defended"
solidly forward

"forward once more, into the covers this time"
pushed back onto the stumps and blocked to the leg side

"<B>that's a strike of beastly intent!</B> Full and fast, but met with a supreme bottom-handed bunt through long-off. Such power in those wrists!"

"solid in defence again, as Campbell plugs away from round the wicket"

"on the back foot, chopped through third man. Ben Stokes reaches <B>3000 runs in Test cricket</B>. The fifth to 3000 and 100 Test wickets for England. Chapeau"
"a big slice of pie from Chase. Too short, leg-sided, and <B>monstered over deep backward square!</B>"
"pushed into the off side, poking to third man with flat feet and an open face"
solid block to the off side
"<B>Stokes has been given out lbw!</B> Not a massive appeal, to be honest, and unsurprisingly Stokes <B>reviews</B>. Seemed to grip on an off-stump line, and grazed just past the inside edge, but <strong>UltraEdge says no bat!</strong> That's going to be out! He had been struggling when the ball was pitched on the stumps... the end of a battling but formless stay at the crease"
"leaning forward, hurried a touch but squeezed to safety"
"width, and flashed out to deep point"
"<strong>banged in short straightaway</strong>, but this one slides under the arm-pit and down the leg side"
"<strong>short and fast again!</strong> Moeen bows beneath the ball, looking unruffled so far"

"round the wicket once more, finding a full and straight length on off stump. Tucked to the leg side"
fully forward to defend
"<B>abysmal from Moeen!</B> Just  a hint of width outside off, Mo threw his wrists at the ball as if casting his rod for tomorrow's afternoon of marlin fishing ... Holder at the second of West Indies' slips gobbled the simplest of takes, and off he skulks for a pair. Stick a fork in this one, it is cooked!"
"round the wicket, darted on middle and leg, Foakes pushes it back down the track"
"hits a length in the corridor outside off, Buttler leaves it be"

"full of a length, worked to mid-on"
"FIVE FOR CHASE!! <b>Campbell with a brilliant diving snare at short midwicket!</b> He was horizontal as he flew to his left, grabbing it one-handed, West Indies on another level in every respect!

"stays round the wicket to Foakes, lobbed up on the stumps and tucked to midwicket"
"full and swept powerfully away through squa... HANG ON, <b>that's brilliantly held at short leg!</b> The wind is only blowing one way, here! Hetmyer had his head down, taking evasive action but the ball went straight into his midriff and he came up with it smiling! Six-wicket haul for Roston Chase"
lets this one go
"full on the stumps, defended"
"flighted, Rashid reaches out and whips toward midwicket"
tapped down to the off side
"in the channel from round the wicket, lets it go"
"short, 143kph/88mph and rising up to hit the splice of the bat as Curran defends"
"dung in at 88mph but Curran seizes on it, <b>flat-batted on the pull through mid-on</b> - not many people fielding in front of square and it races away!"
jumps into line and pokes one through extra cover
"over the wicket, short ball, Rashid rocks back and pulls pretty comfortably"
"round the wicket, shortish at 143kph/89mph as Curran hops across and blocks square"
"wristy whip over midwicket, could go all the way... <b>No, he's picked out the fielder!</b> He's right on the rope, has to juggle the ball but Brathwaite does it well - although, the boundary marker had actually been moved, and he <i>did</I> stand on the line where it was resting previously. Dharmasena is happy enough, anyway, and England are nine down"
poked back down the track
"flat offbreak from round the wicket, defended"
flicked away through backward square leg
tossed up and defended in front of the stumps
Jimmy shows it a straight bat once again
tossed up and defended
Curran flicks the ball into a gap
lobbed up and pushed into the off side
floated up and blocked coming forwards
turned to the leg side
angled in and Anderson plunges forward to smother the ball
floated up on the stumps and stabbed through midwicket for a single off the first ball
pushed through and defended resolutely on off stump
"floated up a touch wider and he has a go at this one, a mighty mow across the line, fails to connect"
floated up and defended coming forwards
"gives this a bit more flight, spins away past the outside edge"
tossed up and blocked
floated up on the stumps and Curran again dinks a single through midwicket from the first ball
"tossed up and smacked through square leg, <b>unfurls the slog-sweep</b>, he likes that shot... and away it goes"
pushes this back down the track
"tries to reverse-sweep, this ends up at slip, there's an appeal for lbw, too... and West Indies decide to <b>review!</b> Lots going on, Kumar Dharmasena will have to unpack it all. Not sure he's actually made contact with the ball, although there's a possibility it deflected off the glove as the bat came around. Nothing on UltraEdge but it <i>could</i> be close on lbw - no, it's umpire's call on impact, and he was 2.5m down the pitch, too: all of which means <b>it stays with the on-field decision!</b> Got all that?"
tossed up and blocked coming forwards
"darted on off stump, Anderson taps it away"
angled in and defended by Curran coming down
uses the feet and blocks
"tossed up wide of the stumps, Curran reaches out and smears four through the covers"
"down the leg side, Curran walks past it to be stumped - <b>and West Indies have won by 381 runs!</b> Chase gets his eight-for, and the Windies have blown England away in Barbados! Neat bit of work by Hope, the back-up keeper, too, emphasising how big a gap there has been between the two teams here"
