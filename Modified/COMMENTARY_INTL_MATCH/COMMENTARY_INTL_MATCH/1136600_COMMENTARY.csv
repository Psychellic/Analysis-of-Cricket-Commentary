"full outside off, and he takes a big stride forward. Crunched to cover"
"<b>two-ball duck!</b> Perfect offspin from Gowtham, and that crashes into leg stump. It was outside off, but wild turn into the batsman. Tries a big heave towards the leg side, but the ball sneaks through the big gap between bat and body"

"low full toss outside off, mistimed to cover, and Rahul's halfway down the wicket. The fielder picks up and has a shy at the striker's end, but misses completely. Direct hit and the batsman would've been gone! Rahul choosing to live dangerously"
"<b>bat-pad, or pad-bat?!</b> Full on off, and zipping straight through. The batsman tries to defend, and hits his pad first, perhaps. Sodhi wants to review. Interesting. It's definitely pad first, but is it turning away too much? Yes, just too much. Missing off stump by a whisker!"

Binny throws it to the keeper, who takes the bails off. Is the bat on the line? Or is there some part behind the line? No conclusive evidence. Tight call for the TV umpire. Bardue rules Axar out.

"yorker just outside off, and dug away towards cover for a walking single"
"another yorker on leg stump, of course. Dug away towards midwicket, and no one's there in the deep. Archer has to go racing behind it, and does well to keep it down to only two"

"full outside off, and he shuffles across to the off side before reverse sweeping over short third man! Settles down on one knee, and sent over the infield"
"<b>Rahul ends on 95!</b> An unbeaten, but valiant knock. It was short on off, and Rahul once again reverse paddles this over short third man. Ends the game with a 16-run over, but it was all too late. <b>Rajasthan Royals win by 15 runs!</b>"
