swing. But too much. And not very well directed. Full and swinging well down leg for a leg side wide.
"wow, that was a bad shot. It was full and straight, swinging back in, but Zaman throws his hands at the ball, looking to hit the ball too hard through cover. Inside-edged into the pad."
"on the pads this time, 133 kph, hits Zaman's pad en route to square leg"
"136 kph, good length delivery outside off, defended into the cover region. The bat well away from the pad"
"good length delivery outside off, 131 kph, nicely bowled. A choppy drive into the ground towards cover"
"nice change-up. Goes full and straight this time, fullish length, defended back"
"good end from Lakmal. Full and straight, 134 kph, Shehzad hits the ball back to the bowler with a nice, straight bat face. Variable swing in that over"
"on a length around middle, fantastic line, no width and Zaman is forced to defend from the crease"
"some away shape. Pushed through fuller too, full and wide, bunted away to cover from the crease"
"a low full toss around off, skewed away to midwicket"
"a bit of width, full outside off. Zaman tries to hit that too hard again, as a result the ball is mis-timed back to the bowler"
"squeezed away for runs. Nowhere near control. Fullish around middle and leg, Zaman tries to hit that straight but the hands are clutching the bat too hard, the ball skews off the inside half through square leg. Zaman trying to hit every ball too hard"
"much better. That's a good delivery, on a length around middle and leg, pushed to mid-on and Zaman calls his partner through. Quality single"
"lays into that. The bat comes down at the right angle, and the timing is great. Full delivery outside off, Zaman drives through cover, and finds the gap. Didn't over-hit that"
drifts down leg for another leg-side wide
"change in pace, a slower delivery on leg, defended towards mid-on."
"full, but drifting down leg, off the pad towards fine leg for a leg bye"
"still no run for Shehzad. Full and wide outside off, the ball moving away, driven through to cover."
"there is his first run! Full outside off, moving away, driven to extra cover, where the fielder dives to his right and saves some runs"
"that will run away. 131 kph, a full delivery on off, Zaman offers the full face of the bat and just times his on-drive. Lakmal reaches out, but even though his reach is long, the timing is too good. Beats the bowler, Shehzad and mid-on."
"fullish delivery outside off, swinging away. Badly-timed drive finds short cover"
"whips this through square leg for a run. On a length, but this one seams back in. Read the length and direction of swing and played the right stroke"
"edged and gone! Beauty from Gamage. On a length from Gamage, but the ball moves away, like it has been doing for him through this spell. Zaman opts for the wrong stroke - trying to whip the ball into the leg side, against the angle of swing. What that generally means is the batsman will be squared up if there is substantial movement, and there is. A thick outside edge carries at head height to a wide slip. Fantastic bowling, but could have been played better"
"full delivery outside off, a solid defensive block, watchfully played"
"good length outside off, the ball coming back in, worked into the leg side, towards midwicket"
"fantastic over, probing. 132 kph, full delivery outside off, the ball coming back in, defended"
"fullish delivery on off, 133 kph, played away towards mid-on. Trying to use his wrists to find a gap, proactive but ineffective"
"lovely shot, but straight to the fielder. However good you look playing a stroke, however good your timing is, it's all pretty much useless without the second requisite of boundary-scoring, placement. Shehzad nails his languid cover drive to extra cover"
"adjusts his length right away, on a length around off, defended back"
"a slower ball outside off, 125 kph, whipped to wide mid-on for one. There's a gap there, Shehzad wanted more power into the stroke."
"full delivery outside off, the ball holds its line, defended back"
"full delivery outside off, 127 kph, driven into the mid-off region"
"full delivery outside off, 83 mph, carved to wide third man for a couple. Beat point, opened the bat face late."
"smashed! But straight to third man. Full and wide outside off, a hammered cut to third man"
"good length delivery outside off, driven towards mid-off"
"shortish delivery outside off, 129 kph, may or may not have been short enough to pull, but Babar goes through with the stroke, pulled to mid-on"
"lovely shot. Full and very wide outside off, Babar nails his drive, into the gap at extra cover. Good-enough timing"
"full delivery outside off, 130 kph, blocked"
"shortish delivery on off, Shehzad flicks this to fine leg, a whippy clip. Down to fine leg for a couple"
"full around off, the ball coming back in, worked away to wide mid-on for one"
"133 kph, that's a poor shot. Shehzad's dire form continues. It's full and wide outside off. Wide enough for him to drive, but he needed to be more compact to ensure he was in control. He loosely throws his hands at it, gets it off the outside half of the bat and straight to backward point. Not a great delivery, not a great shot."
"shortish and wide outside off, chopped away towards cover from the crease"
"good length outside off, 130 kph, punched away back towards mid-off. Sri Lanka's bowlers have been great this afternoon"
"terrific end. Full delivery on a fifth-stump line, defended into the cover region"
"full delivery on off, the ball coming back in, driven with the angle of swing, to mid-on"
"good length delivery outside off, punched towards cover"
"on a length outside off, a blocked push to mid-off. The line and length is quite good"
"124 kph, the pace has gone down slightly, but not the accuracy. On a length on off, defended back. Can't score of that, unless you whip your wrists through the line, and get one to square leg, like how Hashim Amla does"
"this is really good stuff from Sri Lanka. Shortish delivery outside off, punched into the ground towards short point, who leaps up to parry the ball away. That was four if the ball beat him"
"just one off the over. Fullish delivery, angling back in, towards off or just outside. Played into the midwicket region"
"full delivery outside off, 136 kph, driven straight to short cover. Another dot, racking up quickly"
"full delivery outside off, 134 kph, the ball moves away late, a thick outside edge down to third man. Not in control again"
"full delivery outside off, 139 kph, Hafeez drives languidly to mid-off"
"a good stop again. Full outside off, 85 mph, Hafeez's drive skews off the outside half towards point, who dives to his right to save a couple"
"132 kph, shortish delivery outside off, Babar is slightly late on his drive, the ball takes the under-edge to the keeper."
"and another dot. 138 kph, short and wide outside off, carved away towards point. Babar is now 6 on 18"
"shortish delivery on leg, worked down to fine leg for one, via the pad"
"that's a fine stroke. On middle and leg, on a length, worked away through midwicket. A whippy flick. Babar loses his bat towards the completion of the second run, but keeps his head and calmly comes back for three"
"fullish and wide outside off, 133 kph, left alone"
"full delivery outside off, 129 kph, played back towards mid-on"
"runs down the pitch, gets there and just goes through with his clean swing. Not over-hit, not caressed, somewhere in between. Hits the ball over the bowler's head and it clears the mid-off boundary"
"128 kph, edged and gone. Gamage is fired up. That's some response. On a length outside off, hafeez has been standing on off, so even though it's a sixth. maybe seventh-stump channel, Hafeez feels he has to play, a nothing prod. And then the magic, late, late away movement creates a thick outside edge which is easily taken by the keeper."
"goes wide of the crease, full outside off, Babar is watchful in defense"
"short and wide, was there to be cut, but Babar's flaying slash finds point"
"full outside off, 132 kph, a solid block into the mid-off region"
"that's a nice stroke but a good fielding position in place to protect the over. Full and wide, driven through to deep point"
"good length outside off, 137 kph, defended back"
"128 kph, digs this one in on middle and leg. Malik gets underneath it"
"124 kph short on middle and leg, Babar this time gets underneath the bouncer"
"good length delivery outside off, pushed out towards mid-off. Another dot. Currently, the intent is not even there to hit a gap"
well down leg for an extra. A great delivery to a left-hander
"that's a great stroke. He hasn't been flustered by the dots, even though maybe he should be. Good length delivery on middle and leg, punched away to the mid-on boundary. Just timing"
"good length outside off, hit away through deep cover for a couple. Good running from Malik to come back"
"slightly short outside off, pulled away to wide mid-on. Probably the wrong choice of shot, but it's not too quick"
"fullish and wide outside off, left alone. Just inside the tramline."
"a low full toss outside off, Malik almost bunted that right back. Lands in front of and to the left of a diving Vandersay for one to long-off"
"short and wide, smashed to the sweeper cover off the back foot"
"nicely tossed up outside off, Malik leans forward and drives to the sweeper cover, nicely played"
"this is quicker and straighter, full, defended into the mid-off region"
"lovely shot. Slightly short and wide, short enough for Babar to pick the length early, goes back and carves a cut through the vacant point region. Perfect placement too"
"slightly leg side-ish, on middle and leg, clipped down to short fine leg"
"129 kph, digs this one in on off, Malik gets on top of the bounce to defend, keeps it down"
"131 kph, another short delivery on off, Malik plays it nicely, down by his feet, wants one but it's too close to the bowler"
"fullish delivery outside off, 134 kph, seam movement back in, defended"
"short and wide, a hit-me delivery. It's smashed, but straight to the sweeper cover"
"fullish delivery around off, worked wide of mid-on for a quick single, good run"
"135 kph, short delivery on middle and leg, nudged away to deep square leg, nice use of the wrists"
"flight outside off, 84 kph, driven to the sweeper cover for one. Hitting the ball with the spin"
"quick outside off, 87 kph, nice line, defended into the off side"
"shortish and wide outside off, cut to the sweeper cover, read the length early and went back"
"oh wow. That's the shot of the day. It's short, it's quick and slightly wide. Malik somehow goes back enough, creates room by bending his knees and carves the cut between point and third man. Shot."
"the googly, on middle and leg, worked to square leg for one"
"83 kph, quick on middle, driven to long-on. And that will be drinks."
"back of a length, slight shape in at off stump. Gets tall to punch this to mid-on"

"121 kph, full outside off stump, mistimes the cover drive again. This time it's straight at extra cover"

"<b>gone! Guides it straight to the keeper.</b> Oh Malik surely knows that's the not the shot on this kind of a surface, but he can only think about as he walks back. This is back of a length in the corridor, he waits a long time for it to come on and opens the face. Wasn't enough room or pace for that shot. It's a feeble dab in the end and a simple one for Dickwella"

Seemed like he was playing for a googly, but this turns back in and smashes into the front pad...<b>there is no bat.</b> The only thing to save him here is line of impact. It was close to being outside off stump. But we'll wait for tracking...<b>impact in line.</b> Wickets hitting. Decision overturned. Imad is gone. A good review from Tharanga. That looked liked it hit him outside off at full speed, but the replays show just how little his front leg had moved. Trapped right in front."

"there it is. <strong>A second consecutive ton for Babar Azam</strong>. Takes off his helmet, catches his breath and raises his bat. A short, slow delivery on off, nudged into the gap at midwicket for two. Fine, fine effort"
"backs well away to try and open up the off side, but Lakmal follows him, on the pads and then off it, one leg bye"
"in the gap and four. 141 kph, full delivery on leg, in the wheelhouse and Shadab swings, finds the gap at midwicket for four. Lands just inside the boundary"
"a terrific yorker on middle, all Shadab can do is push to long-off for one. <strong>His maiden ODI fifty</strong>."
"looking foe the yorker, on the pads, clipped away towards backward square leg. Babar may have come back for two had it been the second over of the innings. It's not. Just one"
"a low full toss outside off, Babar stays in his crease and heaves the ball away, but finds long-on. Long boundaries, not easy to clear these boundaries. End of a fine innings. A tired shot."
"a short delivery on leg, a mis-timed pull lobs towards mid-on. Chandimal runs around from mid-off, just one"
"wheee, where has this guy been? First-ball six. A short delivery on leg, Hasan swings and gets so much power behind it. Way over square leg, massive boundaries these"
"just short of deep midwicket, for two, plus one? A full toss on middle and leg, Hasan doesn't get enough connection behind it, lands short of the fielder, who picks up and throws the stumps down at the batsman's end. There is an overthrow, but it won't matter because the throw has caught Hasan an inch short. Superb fielding. Saves his side one, Dananjaya the fielder."
"taken at deep midwicket, but is it over waist height? A high full toss on leg, Raees swings again, but there is not enough power to clear the fielder at deep midwicket. Dananjaya runs to his right and takes a good, sharp catch. They are never easy to take. The ball is just below waist height"

full and angling down leg. He can't get bat on this as he looks to flick. Big appeal from the bowler as he's looking at the umpire....and a face that indicates it was nowhere near when he faces his skipper

only Tharanga could have played this shot today. Plenty of luck for him to still be there. This one is short and angled into him. He withdraws the bat and drops his wrist to try and let it go. It follows him and hits the edge of the bat for a boundary to fine leg

"short and wide outside off, makes too much room but adjusts to ramp this past slip. Short third man gives a long chase and pulls it back with a slide"

"quick on the pads to start, nudged to midwicket"
"some spin, tosses this one up fuller outside off, carved off the open face to point"
"poor shot. Quick and straight, Tharanga opens his stance and guides a push to point, took the ball off middle stump"
"full, flight on off, a bit of a leading edge back to the bowler. Fantastic accuracy from Hafeez"
"that will do nothing for Sarfraz's tranquility. Flat on middle and leg, inside-edged towards short fine leg, where a single is conceded. Sarfraz sedately disappointed"
"quick and straight, driven to long-on. That one didn't turn, which was why he drove that to long-on, instead of long-off."
"nice loop and drift on middle and off, pushed with soft hands towards point for a quick run. Well played"
"quick and full around off, 92 kph, driven to cover."
"nicely bowled, Malik's pace is slower than Hafeez's, which means the stock ball will be the one that turns slightly, like this one. Patted away"
"this one is quicker and doesn't turn. Quick down leg, off the pad towards short fine leg"
"pushed through. No turn again. Quick on leg, hits bTharanga flush in front of leg but that angle is taking it down leg. A big appeal, a quick no from the umpire"
"the line is bad, short down leg, Tharanga misses his pull, off the pad down to fine leg for some runs"
"why? Another poor shot. Quick and straight, Hafeez doesn't turn many. This one drifts towards middle, and Thirimanne takes it off the stumps, drives to cover"
"nice use of the feet, gets close to the pitch and drives to the sweeper cover"
"80 kph, nicely played again. Gets forward and drives past cover for one to the sweeper cover"
"82 kph, quick on off, cut to point, another iffy stroke. A matter of time before he misses one"
"read the length early, picked the right shot but failed to execute. Short on off, short enough for Thirimanne to go back and try to pull over midwicket, but he can only mis-time the ball to long-on"
"quick outside off, cut into the off side, towards point. Fine bowling from these offspinners"
"a manufactured run. Short and straight, Thirimanne goes back and clatters a cut to deep point. It's a very risky shot"
"oh yeaaah! That's not risky, that's classy. Flight outside off, very wide. Tharanga leans forward and caresses his cover drive over cover. It was what he was attempting when he was dropped"
"quick outside off, driven to cover with the spin. Good options these"
"shortish and wide, some turn, carved to third man. Some spin."
"given by umpire Shozab Raza.<strong> But Tharanga reviews immediately.</strong> There was a noise, which forced Sarfraz's massive appeal. The umpire was influenced by the noise and the appeal. Is there an edge? The bat definitely hits the back pad, but does the ball hit the bat too? I don't think. 'There was nothing on Ultra Edge, the bat hit the pad,' says the third umpire S Ravi. Sarfraz didn't mind giving Tharanga an angry send-off, but has nothing to say now. Wow, how things change. Good review"
"take that, says Tharanga. Short on middle and off, Tharanga picks the length early, goes back and pulls well over midwicket, picked his area, the ball lands in front of the boundary and then into the boundary cushion. Fantastic shot."
"flat outside off, guided away towards point"
"slow and short and wide, slapped in front of cover for a run"
"quick down leg, 92 kph, strays down leg. Well taken by Sarfraz but wide"
"nicely stopped from Shadab. Short and wide, carved to point. Good stop"
"fine. Using the pace. Short outside off, lets the ball come to him before guiding a late cut past short third man for runs"
"nicely bowled, some flight on middle, driven towards cover, where Shehzad dives to his left to save one"
"almost got through. Not sure why Thirimanne thinks this is a high-percentage shot. Short and straight, no turn, drifts on towards off, he cuts off the stumps to point."
"quick on off, 87 kph, pushed to point. A better shot, played that square with as straight a bat as possible"
"that is not a good shot. Quick on off, the ball slides on and just misses the front pad en route to the angled bat, to short third man. If it hits the front pad, that's out"
"flight outside off, chipped over the infield, for one to the sweeper cover"
"94 kph, quick outside off, Thirimanne misses a deft late cut. Almost hit off stump. A lbw or bowled is not too far away"
"well, it's here. Umpire Raza gives Thirimanne, <strong>but he reviews</strong>. Flight on leg, Thirimanne gets low for a slog sweep, but doesn't make any contact. He is struck right in front of leg, the ball drifts on and HawkEye suggests the ball is clipping the outside of leg stump. Not a bad review, Sri Lanka don't lose their review, but lose Thirimanne, whose shot selection through his innings was frankly dire."
"quick on leg from around the wicket, worked to deep square leg. A fumble from the fielder allows the second. Sarfraz is ready to take his bat, ball and stumps and walk home. He's seething."
"85 kph, flight on off, defended. Sri Lanka need to just relax, they have been overly frantic, when they don't need to be"
"quick on the pads, worked towards midwicket, who dives to his left to save a run"

"quick on middle, low bounce, pushed back to the bowler. Playing with the full face, well done"
"84 kph, shortish outside off. Short enough for Tharanga to go back and cut to deep cover"
"tossed up outside off, worked with the spin to midwicket"
"short outside off, spinning in, worked with the spin to square leg. Tidy over"
"nice start from Shadab, quick outside off, spinning back in, worked back"
"the quicker one, may have been the googly, nudged to midwicket"
"that's a fine shot. Against the legspin, that's not a bad shot because the pace is slower. Short on off, Tharanga picks the length early, goes back and slashes a cut through backward point. Superb execution. Sarfraz not pleased again. He is now chatting with Shadab."
"lots of flight outside off, 86 kph, driven to long-off"
"the googly, Chandimal did not pick that. Wow, massive bat-pad gap, and Shadab finds it. Makes a quality batsman look rather foolish. Discernibly released from the back of the hand, but Chandimal can't see that because he is seeing the front of the hand, it's beautifully pitched - flight, loop on off, which invites Chandimal into a drive. Big gap and the ball creeps through to knock into middle stump"
"the legbreak to start to Siriwardana, attacking the stumps. Worked with the spin to midwicket"
"the slider again, quick on middle and leg, off the inside edge to square leg"
"quick on the pads, flicked past short midwicket for a couple. Sarfraz not happy again"
"bunted back to the bowler. slower through the air, Siriwardana quick through the shot, lucky it lands in front"
"quick outside off, cut to the sweeper cover for one"
"pushed through again. Quick outside off, skids on, blocked back"
"another slider. Really quick, driven back to the bowler rather awkwardly"
"taken this time by Babar. Sri Lanka's struggles to wristspin not different from the rest of the world. Siriwardana, this time, doesn't pick the googly, goes back and prods very conscious of the ball going through bat and pad, but it's not the legbreak. And Siriwardana has no clue. He is a good enough batsman to adjust and get close to the ball, but that's very risky in international cricket, the ball takes the outside edge and carries to Babar at waist height, to his left. I can say that he should play the line and allow himself to be beaten on the outside edge, but that's not easy at all. Fantastic delivery"
"flight on off, worked back to the bowler"
"lovely timing. Lots of flight outside off, too full, driven past cover for three. Fantastic timing. Sarfraz has a frown again, shocking."
"the googly on middle, nudged to fine leg. Sarfraz is having a go at his bowler again. Unique leadership, whatever works right?"
"85 kph, sublime timing. Overpitched flight outside off, Thisara leans on his drive and caresses the ball through mid-off and cover. The legbreak is suppressed"
"quick outside off, 88 kph, pushed to cover from the back foot."
"short on leg, worked to Imad at midwicket for a quick single"
"taken again. Sri Lanka are falling away. The umpires want to check if Babar has taken the catch. Babar certainly thinks he has. The soft signal is out. Beautiful bowling that, slow and loopy outside off. Thisara wafts, and the ball takes the outside edge. Travels low to Babar, whose hands are in the wrong position, the ball hits the wrist and the high part of the hand, but the ball ricochets back into his body, and he somehow wrangles his body into a position to take the catch via the thigh and the leg and the arm and whatnot. Pakistan don't care how."
"quick on leg, worked to midwicket, the slider."
"another one that drifts on. Quick on middle and leg, the ball skids on and hits Tharanga in front of leg"
"flight outside off, 80 kph, carved away to point"
"nice end. Quick and straight, pushed to cover. 'Very well bowled Hafeez bhai,' goes Sarfraz. He is not wrong at all"
"another one! Seven down now Sri Lanka. As a tail-ender, against wristspin, you always have to be wary of the delivery that attacks the stumps  - the legbreak to the left-hander and the googly to the right-hander. Dananjaya is a left-hander, but is not aware enough that Shadab will attack the stumps, because there are more modes of dismissals available. He goes back, misses the legbreak and the ball sneaks through to hit the stumps."
"it's full, straight. Smothered. Couldn't see what variation that was, sorry."
"that is the legbreak, short and wide outside off, Vandersay misses a cut"
"lots of flight outside off, 86 kph, driven away towards cover"

"24 off his 10 overs. Fantastic spell from Hafeez. Quick down leg, worked away towards square leg to retain strike"
"the googly outside off, clattered to the sweeper cover from the back foot"
"big appeal. No, says umpire Raza. Quick on middle, Tharanga misses a flick and is struck in front of middle and leg. Probably spinning down. No, <b>three reds says HawkEye</b>"
"fine shot to get to a fine fifty. Flight outside off, the ball spinning in, Tharanga gets under the length and lifts the ball over mid-off. He had to stay slightly inside the line to hit the ball against the spin, expertly done"

"whacked over midwicket. Slightly short on middle, Tharanga reads the length and picks his shot, a heave over midwicket. Mid-on was up, safe shot."

"good length on middle and leg, the ball seaming back in, worked to midwicket"
"just short of deep square leg. Fantastic effort from Shehzad, runs in and looks to take the catch, but the ball juuust about carried, or lands juuust in front. If that landed a foot in front, his teeth were in trouble. A nice short delivery on leg, pulled to square leg"

"good length outside off stump, draws him forward and beats the outside edge"
"googly, pitches on middle and catches him on the pad. Going down leg though"

"slower ball again, this is an offcutter. Spins back in and cuts out the room as he looks to dab it down to third man"
"offcutter, back of a length at leg stump. Pushes it through midwicket with soft hands and allows them to come back for the second"

"slider, back of a length at middle stump. Gets on the back foot to try and cut, but he's cramped and can't get it more than pitch side"
"short and just outside off stump, backs away and nails the cut to find sweeper cover"
"good length at leg stump, dropped into the leg side with soft hands"
"slider, back of a length at middle stump, deep in the crease to whip this to long-on"
"back of a length, nips in from outside off and it's too quick for the No. 9. He fends at it and doesn't know where it is. It's lodged behind the flap on his right pad"
<b>leading edge</b> flies past backward point. He's looking to turn this into the leg side from outside off and closes the face too early
"short ball outside off stump, stylish looking pull shot into the floor, but it's straight to midwicket"
"full and straight, angled in, but the full face of the bat comes out and it's a single down to long-on"
"yorker at off stump, Tharanga looks to work this through midwicket, but he can only hit it onto pad"
Misses his length on the yorker. It's full on the pads and he nurdles it comfortably to long-on
"slower ball, full outside off stump. Driven straight to extra cover"
"slower ball, short and in the corridor. Backs away and ramps this. Can only find third man on the bounce"
"back of a length at the pads, tickled to fine leg"
"short one, slow and rising at the helmet. Can't get power on the pull shot. Finds deep square"
"<b>finds deep square leg!</b> Is that it for Sri Lanka? Bouncer gets too big for Vandersay. He gets well under it as he goes after it with the hook. Can't blame him, the runs hadn't come this over. Finds Shehzad who pedals backwards and holds on well"
"back of a length, angled into the pads. Tucked through midwicket from the crease"
"glorious shot, but it's only one. Nice overpitched ball outside off, creamed along the floor to find sweeper"
"back of a length, angled in at the pads. He swivels to pull this, inside edges on to the front pad and responds to the call for a run"
"<b>oh dear!</b> Tharanga has got his hundred, but Lakmal might well be out attempting a poor second run. Length ball at middle stump, Tharanga tucked it in front of square leg. Lakmal turns after reaching the crease and takes off without waiting for a call. It takes him a long time to turn around and return and his dive is not good enough. He's out. The throw was slightly wide, but there was enough time"
"good length outside off, nice flowing square drive, but he finds point with it"
"back of a length at off stump, drops it into the off side and takes off....once again there's no run. But this earns him an overthrow as he runs back towards the crease"
"short one at off stump, a laboured pull, harmless, straight to long-on"
"back of a length at leg stump, flicked through square leg"
"back of a length at leg stump, defended into the leg side"
"good length, angled in at leg stump. Pushed wide of midwicket"
"back of a length, angled down leg side. He looks to whip it square. Appeal is turned down. But wide not given. Perhaps it was thigh guard. Or it could be bat, but the rule today is Tharanga can't be given out"
"slower ball, short and down leg side. Through the pull too early but the <b>top-edge</b> lands in front of Junaid at short fine. His dive isn't good enough"
"good length at off stump, awkwardly pushed into the off side"
"slower ball, short and wide outside off. No pace on it, he can only chip it over mid-off"
"yorker outside off stump, tapped into the off side"
"overpitched wide outside off, backs away and chops this to third man's left"
"shot. Short and just outside off stump, contorts to make room and slice this over extra cover to find the boundary"
"full at off stump, makes room, drives it straight to mid-off"
"this could be the end. Full toss outside off stump, sliced behind point and he comes back for the second. It appears to be a direct hit...but it also appears like <b>Sarfraz might have broken the stumps with glove</b> before the direct hit. It's a matter of three frames. Sarfraz's left glove touches the bails, but they're not off. In the next frame too the bails are on...also in the third frame! Which means the bails coming off in the fourth frame <b>are because of the ball!</b> That's it. Pakistan have finished this."
