"good length, pushed across the left hander, he waits and pushes it to midwicket"
"PLUMB! Great bowling by Beer! Stays around the wicket to Bell, gives him the arm ball first up, and traps him on the back foot right in front of middle stump.

"tossed up outside off, stretches far forward and pushes with hard hands to cover"
"arm ball on middle, angles in and hits him on the thigh pad"
"100 kph, another arm ball! Dreadful shot from Bancroft. Has premeditated the paddle sweep and goes down early to get in position, but is beaten by pace and trapped in front of the middle stump. He looks disappointed with the decision but he won't be when he sees the replays"

Agar slips again as he tries to complete the second and the bowler has a shy at the striker's end. The throw is much too wide and much too short of Handscomb, who can't gather it. Instead, chucks his left glove off immediately and nurses his fingers. He's in some pain. The crowd is happy with this total and they send their team off vociferously"
