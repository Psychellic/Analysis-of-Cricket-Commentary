"Shahzad aims to clear mid-off. No dice. Instead, he scoops a catch to mid-off running back. Shahzad backs away outside leg, collapses his back leg, and lines up for an inside-out loft. This is on a length on off stump. He checks his shot at the last instant and finds Kevin O'Brien"

and the afterburners have just been switched on. Porterfield picks up a length ball and bullies it over the midwicket boundary
"time for a change of pace, Porterfield adjusts his stroke, and drives along the ground to cover"
"races down the pitch, Sadiq fires it full, and into the pads to cut off any room for the batsman. Hits the boot and wanders into the midwicket region for a leg-bye. Sadiq is too busy straining his lungs for an appeal that is never going to be given in his wildest dreams. Ball pitched way outside leg"
"smashes it to mid-off, off the to of the bat"
"the bowling change works! Stirling swings across the line of a straight ball, looking for midwicket again, and he is essentially beaten for pace. The top of leg stump, however, is not."
"spears it into the pads of the left-hander, who attempts to dink it towards square leg. No connection"
"<b>massive appeal for lbw</b> as Porterfield goes for a sweep and is hit in line with middle stump. But with such an acute angle into the batsman, this ball is always heading down leg"
"flatter and quicker outside off, drills it to long-off"
drives a flat ball on off stump to long-off
"turns this one, fired in by Nabi again, to long-on"
"'catch iiiiiit' is the cry as Porterfield goes for a flick a touch too early. Lobs up towards midwicket, but the fielder is on the edge of the circle. Never had a chance"
nudges it past midwicket's right.
"starts with a slower ball, pitching outside leg, Porterfield misses the flick and is struck on the pad"
swipes a length ball on middle to midwicket
"looks to go down town, but the change of pace from Sadiq does O'Brien. The slog over cow corner becomes an inside edge onto pad"
"ooops, the slower ball slips out of his hands and becomes <b>a beamer</b>. O'Brien ducks"
the <b>free hit</b> ball is lashed over the top of point and straight into the hands of the fielder in the deep. Blistering shot from the allrounder. For one run.
"offcutter, and it proves quite profitable for Afghanistan. The line is ever so straight, pesky for a batsman looking to free the arms. Porterfield moves outside leg to try and drive it over extra cover, but Rashid Khan there, times his jump perfectly to take the catch over his head"
gets down on one knee and launches it to deep midwicket
"good shot, but he can't pick the gap between point and short third man. Picked the quicker, shorter delivery outside off. Would be disappointed his late cut didn't result in more"
"googly does him. Two wickets in eight balls since the resumption. This one is the result of the legspinning slowing it down, tossing it up, and tempting O'Brien into a big hit. Aims for a slog sweep over midwicket. Misses it altogether and is bowled"
"quicker, flatter and fuller outside off, drives to the left of point"
"Is that another wicket? Afghanistan believe they have got Wilson stumped and the third umpire will have to adjudicate on it. Googly again from Rashid, nicely tossed up, to draw the batsman under pressure to hit boundaries forward. Wilson goes for a cover drive, clearly he didn't pick the variation. The ball hurtles through bat and pad, Shahzad tips the bails over ever so quickly and Wilson's foot is on the line. That means he's outta here"
"looks for the reverse sweep - showing every sign of his nerves, he premeditates the stroke, and the fuller, faster delivery outside off is past him before he knows it"
"another Irishman  goes out swinging. It's a length ball on middle, McBrine wants to smack it out of the ground. There is no time to get yourself in. Not even the time to steady this awful wobble. He has to go, and the slog to cow corner only goes as far as the fielder in the deep"
they've been trying so very very hard and finally Tucker picks up a slower ball and slogs it between deep midwicket and long-on. It's all high-risk cricket
"races down the pitch, gets a thick outside edge to a short delivery outside off and with third man up, Sadiq pays the price for bowling his normal pace. This is a field set for the slower ball"
"cramps the batsman up with a fuller delivery on middle and leg. Tucker swings from the hip, only makes contact off the thigh pad"
plants a shortish delivery on leg stump into the captain's hands at extra cover
"slices a full delivery, swinging into him rather late, to long-off, who comes running in off the boundary"
"third wicket in seven balls for the leggie. He's changed the game. Of course, having a target that forces the batsman to look for the big hits help. Here Tucker comes dancing down and pops a catch to the man at long-off"
"looks for the reverse sweep again, but the length ball is a little too wide for him to make proper connection"
goes for the conventional sweep this time and still fails to connect
"now the frustrated batsman loses his head, comes down the track and is done in by the googly. Superb bowling from Rashid. He ladled all the pressure on Thompson and then gave him a way out - the tossed up ball, but it spins in, skittles through bat and pad as he slogs, and Shahzad does the rest"
appeal for lbw and it's given. <b>Rashid has five wickets in 10 balls - on he is a hat-trick as well</b>. Although this one seems to be a bit lucky. The debutant McCarthy goes for a sweep and is struck on the back pad. Appears to be outside the line of off stump
"wanders outside off stump for a sweep, Rashid bowling a loopy legbreak, exactly where the batsman is, still beats him. That's a <b>triple-wicket maiden</b>"
"down the track, but he ends up yorking himself. Nudge to long-on for a couple. There's a direct hit at the non-strikers'. A quick check on if the run has been complete. And it is."
"tosses it up outside off, because the batsman is making room outside leg, and Nabi essentially one-ups him. The ball is too wide for Mulder to make any connection"
comes down and flicks a straight delivery to short fine leg
"bludgeons a half-volley down the ground, and its got enough power to beat the man at long-off, to his right"
"length ball outside off, slugs it to long-on"
"steps down, Nabi throws it wide of his reach, slogs it to the right of long-on, who sends in another direct hit. Mulder's safe, but Ireland are not."
