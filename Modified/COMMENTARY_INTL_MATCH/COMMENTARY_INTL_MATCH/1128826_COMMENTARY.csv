"hint of width and that has been punched away in style behind point. Just a 60-metre boundary that side, no chance for square third man. Lovely placement too"
this one cuts back in to beat the inside edge as Ronchi looks to flay that through cover. This one kept a touch low as well and was dying on Sarfraz as he moved low to his left to stop that
"full length outside off, driven firmly to mid-off"
goes over the the infield but mid-off hares after that and pulls it back in just in the nick of time. Superb from Mahmudullah. Didn't get the kind of elevation he would've liked. Ended up hitting it between cover and mid-off
"drifting into middle and leg, he's down on one knee as he sweeps it fiercely down to deep backward square leg. Tumbling stop by Anwar Ali. Ran nearly 20 yards before dishing in a full-length dive, but the recovery time was mighty impressive too"

"pushed through quicker on middle and leg, tucked towards the leg side"
"straighter one from around the stumps, defended back to the bowler"

"hits the deck hard as this length ball skids onto middle and leg, tucked to square leg"
"driven hard, into the gap between cover and mid-off, quick single taken"

Not much Asif could've done about it."

"another hit-me half-volley outside off, lofted over mid-off effortlessly. Ronchi is now on overdrive. Friendly stuff this from Hastings"
"picked the bones out of this pull. This is a leg-cutter gone wrong. Drops it too short, Rochi swivels back and nails this pull in front of square. Hits the ropes on the full. Stunning batting."

"so what if he didn't get a wicket with some help behind the stumps? Does it on his own this time with a superb arm-ball that would've made Ravindra Jadeja and Rangana Herath, his idols proud. This is nicely tossed up, gets this to drift back in from around the stumps. But the magic happens after the ball pitches. Just gathers pace and skids on to beat the cut and crash into the stumps. So good to watch"
"another one that drifts in from around the stumps, Misbah gets a long way outside off to sweep. The ball smashes into his glove, so the <B> decision will have to be overturned. </B> Straightforward use of the DRS. Not out it is."

"fetches this pull from outside off and boy, he's hit this beautifully. Deep square comes around but he stood no chance. Maybe 10 years ago, Sami would've been a lot harder to pull. He's lost some pace since. This was sitting up in the mid 130s"
