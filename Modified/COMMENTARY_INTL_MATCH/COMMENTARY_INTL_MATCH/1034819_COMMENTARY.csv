"short of a length, outside off, Roy looks to leave it but does so late and the ball hits the tyoe end of the bat. Doesn't carry to second slip"
"swing there from Yadav. Full, middle and off, and shaping away. Nicely punched straight down the ground, and mid-on is quite straight to deny him the runs"
"more swing. <strong>Beaten</strong>. Kohli might have read the pitch right. Some dampness there. Lands just short of a length, just outside off, and moves away to beat him"
"first runs off the series. Short of a length, outside off, steered away past second slip. Pandya runs to his left from third man, gets a touch on it with the dive, but the ball trickles into the boundary skirting"
"this one swings in, beats the inside edge, is headed down leg and goes for a leg-bye"
"and immediately India look to bowl straight to Hales. Down the leg side, though, and called a wide. Watch out for India denying Hales any room"
"full, on off, Hales defends off the back foot"
outswinger first up. Left alone outside off
Roy is lucky here. He is no control of this drive away from the body. Nowhere close to the line or the length of it. The ball goes in the air but between mid-off and cover
"this time Roy has crunched it. A length ball at 135ks, slight shape away, but Roy drives and keeps it along the ground and bisects mid-off and cover"
compensates with a straight delivery down the pads. Worked away for a single
"short of a length, on off, defended back to him"
"on a length, outside off, holds its line. Defended to cover"
"short of a length, tucked away off the hip for one"
on the pads again. You can see India are conscious of that width. Tucked away for another single
"short, wide, and Roy doesn't bother with finding gaps and such niceties. Cuts this brutally over point for a four on two bounces"
overcompensates with a wide down the leg side
"<strong>given out and immediately reviewed</strong>. This is a straight ball, Roy has moved too far across, and is beaten on the inside edge. This is definitely missing because Roy's stance is outside leg and he has been hit in front of leg. And replays show it is missing. Quite an ordinary call on the field there by Umpire Nandan"
"short of a length, outside off, defended to cover"
"full, on off, straightens a touch, goes uppishly off the bat but lands well in short of mid-off"
"that's a beauty. <strong>Beats him all ends up</strong>. Short of driving length, fourth stump line, makes him play, and then beats him with away movement"
"again around that fourth stump. This time the ball angles in, and Hales defends it from the crease"
stays just outside off and just short of that driving length. Defended off the front foot
"on a length, around the sixth stump now, and draws another forward defensive. This has been a good over"
"and Pandya tries the bouncer after having choked runs up first four balls. Hales hooks from outside off, <strong>gets a top edge</strong>, and it falls fine of fine leg. Ashwin is slightly slow there"
"short of a length, outside off, and he drops this at his toes and takes a single"
"short, hip high, pulled down and for a single to long leg"
"short of a length, slight nip back in, mis-hit towards mid-on and they pick on Ashwin and steal a tight single"
"another quick single. Just tip and run here. This is a little straight, and he drops it into the leg side for one"
"on a length, outside off, holds its lone. Defended to cover"
"bouncer, on the stumps, and Hales ducks it"
"that hurries on to Hales. Slightly short, skids through, rib high, and Hales mis-hits this pull for a single towards fine leg"
nice outswinger at 139ks. Pandya seems to have worked on his pace. Hales drives without any feet. <strong>Beaten on the outside edge</strong>
"driven on the up, Yuvraj dives at extra cover, but they steal the single as he knocks it on towards mid-off"
"short of a length, off and middle, worked away with the angle for a single"
"short of a length, wide, Hales finally makes good connection with the cut but can't beat the man at cover-point"
too straight this time. He has been looking to deny Hales room but pitches middle this time and the angle takes it further. Glanced away for four
"back to that fourth-stump line, and draws a respectful defensive shot from Hales"
"lovely shot. Not much wrong with the delivery. Short of a length, off and middle, but he uses the angle and the wrists to punch this through midwicket for four"
"has Bumrah created the magic India need for a wicket? Direct hit from the depp, and yes he has created the magic. Roy has shuffled across to work this towards fine leg with soft hands. Bumrah swoops in from fine leg, surprises Hales with a throw at the non-striker's end, and Hales doesn't even dive. This is slightly dopey from Hales. First he is not expecting the throw at his end, and then he doesn't put in a dive. We do have a bit of a situation here, though. The umpire and Kohli have blocked the cameras from either end, and the third umpire can't see the bails. He makes the decision relying on the illuminating of the LED stumps. Hales is on the line when the stump flashes up"
"short of a length, outside off, pushed to cover-point"
"bouncer, and a wide down the leg side"
"length ball, middle and leg, beautifully punched away with a straight bat with the slight closing of the face at the last moment. Pierces the gap between mid-on and midwicket"
"drives a length ball on the up handsomely, but can't beat short cover"
"slower ball, on a length, around off, defended from the crease"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
another leave outside off
"short, into the body, skids on to him, and he mistimes this for a single towards fine leg"
"slightly in-between length, and Roy is caught cutting a ball not short enough. Beaten"
"driven on the up, and the outfield is quick, taking this ball away from Kohli at mid-off all the time. He puts in a dive, and saves two runs"
"full, driven hard, straight of mid-off, and again this hurries Kohli again. He gets a hand to it, but can't save a single"
"that shows the respect for Kohli's fielding. Slower ball, driven wide of mid-off, and even though Kohli slips they don't take a single. They stole one hitting straight to Ashwin not long ago"
"short of a length, jags back in, cuts him into two as he plays across its line"
"bouncer. Too far down the leg side, and Roy says thank you very much and helps it along fine for four"
"lovely shot. Almost like Tendulkar. Yadav strays slightly on the middle, and he flicks it nicely. Closes the face late, at the last moment, and it flies through square leg"
looks to crash this length ball through cover and gets an inside edge towards mid-on for a single
"lovely drive on the up, but can't beat short cover"
beautiful again. Roy has done a Tendulkar again. Too trademark Tendulkar shots in two overs. On-drives a short of a length delivery from outside off. Bisects the stumps at non-striker's and mid-on. No follow-through. Just the punch with elbow high
"length ball outside off, opens the face, takes a single"
"angling into the pads beats the inside edge, goes for a leg-bye"
"length ball, angling in, defended towards mid-on"
"short, on off, and Roy moves inside the line to pull it over square leg. Brings up an attractive fifty"

"flat length ball, goes back to punch it to deep cover"
"on a length, fourth-stump line. Defended to cover"

"short of a length, wide, and he punches it deliberately in the air, clearing backward point with ease"
"slightly fuller, draws Roy forward who sees this is not full enough to drive. Defends"
<strong>high full toss</strong>. Surprises him. Not considered high enough to be called a no-ball. Jams against his bat really high
"on a length, angling in, defended to leg"
some turn. At 91ks. Defended in front of off
"incredible shot. This is a reverse ramp. On a knee very early, Jadeja bowls on a length, outside off. He waits for it, and then flicks it out of Dhoni's gloves through short third man"
"into the pads, defended to leg"
driven to sweeper-cover for one
"flat length ball, at 94ks. No turn. Hits the inside half of the defensive bat"
punches this back down to Jadeja as he bowls quick again
"full, middle and leg, gets a single to long-on"

"full, on the pads, single into the leg side. Fifty for the stand"
"down the wicket, Jadeja pulls the length back. Defended back to him"
slightly risky. Making room to a straight length ball and playing with an open face. Gets a single to deep cover
"on a length, outside off, pushed to short cover"
gets a bit of an outside edge towards backward point as he looks to drive a wide length ball
slight shimmy down the wicket. Ashwin pulls the length back. Punched to cover

slight turn as he pitches slightly short. Roy gives up the pull and punches him straight down for one
"on a length, on off, pushed back to him"
again on a length and just outside off. Punched to mid-off

"short of a length, not much room, opens the face but can't beat short third man"
"on a length, on off, punched back to him"
"<strong>dropped</strong>. The first false shot from Roy. He tries the reverse sweep to a length ball. The extra bounce takes the top edge but Yadav at short third takes one step in before going back. That means he is beaten, and his dive is not good enough to hold on to this overhead chance"
"punched between mid-off and cover. This outfield is lightning quick. If there is one man who can save this it is the man chasing this, Jadeja, but even he can't catch up"
single to long-on
"slows this down, 85ks, beats Root on the outside edge as he plays for an offbreak"
goes back to punch this through cover for one
"on the pads, worked to short fine and Ashwin does well to prevent the single"
"shimmies down the wicket, this time he has placed this wide of Aswin at short fine, and they take a single"
"and Jadeja provides the breakthrough. The most economical bowler on the day produces an impatient shot, and gets the stumping. That drop from Yadav hasn't cost them much. Roy leaves the crease too early, Jadeja fires one in. Roy plays a defensive shot because he is not to the pitch of the ball, but he plays for the turn. The ball goes straight on past the inside edge, and Dhoni is not one to miss these stumpings"
defends a flighted delivery back to him
"overpitched, and driven down to long-on for one"
"nicely bowled. Slows it down, 89ks, on a length, middle and leg, defended back to him"
"full, on off, driven back to him"

"short of a length, outside off, punched to deep point for one"
"short of a length, middle and leg, beaten on the punch. Pitched outside leg, though"
"Morgan gives him the charge, gets a thick edge onto his pads. You can see Morgan is under pressure here"
"on a length, pitched outside leg, angling towards middle. Defended to leg. That's Morgan 2 off 10 balls"
"slower ball, on a length, looks to steer it, but can't get it wide of slip. So Morgan being stifled here"
"outside leg. Too predictable, and Root goes inside and on a knee early to dab this fine for a couple"
down the wicket to drive this to long-on for one
and Morgan finds some breathing space with a paddle. Gets it fine of fine leg for a couple
"slog sweep. Morgan has broken free. The first six of the match. Takes this from outside off, and sends it flat over midwicket"

"short of a length, moves back in, takes the inside edge onto the pad"
"Root mis-hits three times in a row. This pull is hurried because of the skiddy pace, but he gets it wide enough of midwicket"
"<strong>Nandan has not given it, and India have reviewed it</strong>. Dhoni generally doesn't appeal frivolously and this time he looks dead sure. Short of a length, angling away, and Morgan looks to open his face. He gets an edge through to Dhoni, and Nandadn has to overturn his call for a second time today. Just slight seam after pitching middle and leg, and kisses the edge"

"goes back to a flatter delivery, gets a single to long-on"
stays back to a flat length ball bowled at 98ks. Punched to cover
Jadeja is lucky. Bowls a long hop that is pulled not wide enough of deep square. Concedes just the single

"slower bouncer, Buttler is caught waling down the wicket and is hit on the helmet. Through early with the shot. The ball hits the shoulder and the helmet grille"
"and Pandya sticks to his guns well enough. He has been bowling with mid-on and mid-off up, and has not given them even one drive ball. Buttler looks to manufacture one to a ball just short of a length, and doesn;t get enough of bat to it. Caught overhead at mid-off by Dhawan. India strike again with England looking to run away from them"

"flighted outside off, and he can't beat the man at cover with this drive"
"on a length, straight, regulation pace, bunted into the leg side for one"
"slower short ball, Stokes waits for it, and rolls his wrists on the pull. Hits this square of deep midwicket and along the ground"
"<strong>that's another beamer</strong>. That is two beamers. Should he be taken out off the attack? No because they were not dangerous beamers, and he has not been warned because both these beamers have been wide outside off. The warning, remember, is subjective"
"length ball, Stokes goes deep into his crease and lofts this over long-on for six. he has done really well to go really deep to create this length"

"slows this down, Stokes punches the length ball to deep cover for one"
"slower ball, Stokes looks to ramp over short fine, but is beaten by the lack of pace"
<strong>is that a third beamer?</strong> Yes it is. And Kohli has dropped the catch. This is Pandya's catch running in from long-off as Stokes mis-hits but Kohli runs back from ocver and no one in the team asks Kohli to not go for them. Dropped
"yorker, on the pads, dug out for a single"
"slower length ball outside off, punched to deep cover"

"looks for the reverse pull, is beaten outside off"
"full, middle and leg, clipped to deep midwicket for one"
<strong>Yadav starts off with a beamer</strong>. This is definitely a dangerous high full toss. Stokes makes room and steers this for a six over point but surely there has to be warning for this ball
Stokes steals the second after digging this into the leg side. Pandya goes at Stokers' end and Dhoni fails to gather cleanly. Stokes' dive gets him in anyway
"good yorker outside leg, Stokes gets an outside edge towards point for one"
"poor bowling,. Short ball with point and short third man in. Moeen makes room and bunts this over the man at point"
"yorker down the leg side, dug out for a single"
"yorker outside leg, Stokes makes room and digs it out into the off side for a single"
"lovely shot. Can't blame Yadav for this. This is inches short of being a yorker, but it is way outside leg. Moeen has still made room and driven this through point for four"
Bumrah gets a wicket. Will this slow England down? Bouncer from over the wicket. A good one. At his left shoulder. Stokes mis-hits the pull and finds deep midwicket. That innings has turned the momentum for England
"yorker, on the pads, gets a single to long-on"
"yorker, outside off, steered to third man for one"
"deep midwicket has moved squarer for some reason, and Moeen has pulled this slower bouncer right where deep midwicket would have been. Gets six for it"

"lovely shot. length ball, outside off, and he has chipped this inside-out beautifully over extra cover"
"yorker outside leg, dug out for a single"
Moeen tries to be too cute and he is bowled. He looks for a reverse paddle sweep to a leg-side yorker and plays it on to his middle and off. Played off the back of the bat
"low full toss, driven down to long-on for one"
and a good yorker that goes just for a single. The first good over in a long time. Just eight off

"on a length, on off, defended from the crease by Rahul"
this one swings but too far down the leg side
nice shot. Stays back to a length ball and punches this between point and cover-point. He has got himself in before playing his first forceful shot. Looks in good touch there
starts too straight and swings it down the leg side again
"on a length, middle and leg, slight swing back in, defended to leg"
slight swing back in. Rahul goes back to bunt this length ball into the leg side for one
swings away but starts too far outside off. Dhawan gets a sighter and shoulders arms

"short of a length, on off, punched to cover"
"down the wicket, looking to go over extra cover, but the ball swings and takes a thick edge towards third man"
"short of a length, angling in, he is cramped for room but drops it behind square for a quick single"
"on a length, no room, headed towards top of off. Dhawan has to respect this accuracy and play it defensively"
"Willey gets his man. The swing does it even though this is not a regulation swing dismissal. Dhawan goes hard for a cover drive, but the ball swings and takes a thick edge of the bat to carry all the way to third man. Moeen takes it on the third go as it threatens to slip out of the hands"
"on a length, just outside off, and Kohli leaves it alone. A good first ball. Around the fourth or fifth stump line"
similar delivery. Just outside off. Kohli defends off the back foot

"short of a length, outside off, defended to point"
"on a length, on off, angling in towards top of off. Defended"
"length ball, angling in too far, and called a wide"
"Kohli makes his intentions clear. Jumps out of the crease at the right moment. Not too soon, not too late, and swings this length ball out of the crews. Huge six over wide long-on. Calculated risk. Looking to upset the bowlers' rhythm"
"length ball, angling in, pushed wide of mid-on, Ball dives to his right. The outfield is very quick and it nearly slips under his dive. They get two as Ball gets a hand to it"
"on a length, just outside off, Kohli looks to drop and run but is sent back"
"short of a length, just outside off, steered to the left of point for a single"
"the crowd is stunned. Willey spears this in really full. It swings in late, beats the shot on the inside and flattens the middle stump"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"length ball, set of stumps outside off, defended with an open face"
uppish drive back at him but it reaches Woakes on a half-volley
"a length ball, a set of stumps outside off. Short of driving length and he has to defend"
"Kohli is looking in silken touch here but he is having to take calculated risks here. This is a moral win for England. However, what a shot. He steps out, makes room and chips this over extra cover. Lovely shot"
"another superb shot but another unnatural shot from Kohli. This is a wide length ball, he makes up his mind he wants to go leg side, and uses his wrists to send this over mid-on. What strong wrists there"
"wide length ball, and left alone"
"Yuvraj is no mood for sighters either. India on the counterattack. Willey pitches short of a length, and Yuvraj pulls off the front foot. Beats the man at deep square leg and gets six over midwicket"
"down the wicket, not to the pitch of the ball, and ends up playing it to cover-point"
"short of a length, just outside off, Yuvraj looks to work to leg, gets a leading edge that falls well in front of Willey"
"short of a length, outside off, punched to point"
"on a length, just shaping away from just outside off. Left alone by Yuvraj. Good carry as Buttler collects it chest high"
creamed away. Short ball at 132ks. Outside off. Yuvraj stands tall and pulls this crisply over midwicket. A cleaner shot than the six early on
"on a length, on off, angling in, defended to leg"
"on a length, sixth-stump line again, defended off the front foot"
"bouncer, outside off, Kohli looks for the upper cut and nearly edges it. Should be a wide on height but has been called one for the over. That is a clear wide but Dharmasena doesn't think this is over head"
"on a length, just outside off, defended to cover"

"short of a length, outside off, punched straight to mid-off. England retain some control with just one off the over"
"on a length, outside off, a bit slow off the surface. Hits him high on the bat as Kohli defends"
wide length ball. Just inches inside the wide line. Kohli plays a drive without any feet. Nowhere close the ball and is beaten
"thick outside edge carries for a six. Ball is bowling that perfect ODI line to Kohli. Just inside that wide line. Kohli has to drive away from the body, and gets a thick edge. Third man has to run around and get under the ball but it lobs him. Had Hales not have to run around and if he had the time to judge this he could have leapt for an overhead catch"
"straight now, and worked away for a single into the leg side"
"short of a length, straight, defended"
"very close to getting an lbw. Pitches within the stumps, straightens a touch, hits him in front but Yuvraj has got an inside edge"
length ball down the leg side. Called wide
"length ball, pitched outside leg, and he glances it for a fine boundary. The first freebie in the innings"
"finally Nandan gets one right but this is such a bonus for England. This ball doesn't deserve a wicket. A gentle length ball pitched outside leg. Yuvraj moves a touch too far inside, and gets a tickle through to the keeper. What a big bonus for England here. Yuvraj looked in good touch. Okay, on second thoughts, is it the threat of the short ball that had him moving back and across too far? The more I think about it, I think it is the threat of the short ball in Yuvraj's mind that has resulted in this wicket"
"short of a length, outside off, Dhoni stabs at it, and is beaten on the inside edge"
just hockey hands here. Short of a length and wide. Dhoni is nowhere close to the ball but hsi low hands do all the work in cutting this away for four
"short of a length, slower, Dhoni works this to fine leg for a single"
"short of a length, just outside off, defended"
"Ball bowls short of a length but gives him the width. Dhoni fails to keep the cut down, and it hits the wrist of the diving Roy at point on a half-volley"
"on a length, outside off, driven on the up, straight to cover"
walks down the wicket to cover the line of this wide length ball and plays it with the angle for a single to mid-on
"on a length, outside off, he goes back to punch this to point"
"and Ball gets him with the ball short of a length and that cramps him up. Dhoni premeditates, walks down the wicket, has nowhere to go as Ball pitches short, and the top edge lobs up for a catch at midwicket. There is a morgue-like silence at the ground"
"short of a length, angling in, dropped to leg for one"
"on a length, fifth-stump line, shaping away a little. Defended"
driven on the up as Stokes continues bowling wide outside off and short of a driving length. Morgan dives at short cover and saves four runs
"lovely shot. Just a defensive push towards mid-on and the outfield does the rest. There is a bit of a punch in this push, and it bisects the stumps and mid-on"
"short of a length, into the pads, worked away to fine leg"
"on a length, angling in, defended back to him"
full and wide. Too wide. Called too
Jadhav doesn't time this perfectly but he has pulled this into the vacant midwicket region and will get four. Dragged this from outside off
"uff what a beautiful shot. England continue to hide the ball away from him outside off, but Kohli makes a small movement across and drives this on the up. Bisects short cover and mid-off"

"on a length, outside off, runs this down to third man for one"
"short of a length, just outside off, he gets across to work this to fine leg for one"
"bad bounce for Ball at third man. He runs to his right, puts the dive in, but the extra bounce means it hits the top of his hand, then his face, and then trickles into the fence. This was cut late by Jadhav"
oh the timing and the outfield. This is just a wristy push to a length ball. On another outfield this is a single but it just keeps running away from Rashid at mid-on and beats his eventual desperate dive
steers this to third man for a single
"bouncer, the ball doesn't come on, Kohli is early into the hook and does well to flatbat this down into the ground"
no turn first up. Hits the inside half of the bat. Out of the front of the hand
goes back to punch this to deep cover for one
"oh nearly that old leggie's trick. Short, outside off, pulled to deep midwicke3t. Falls just short of that man"
"wrong'un, and unlike in Tests, Kohli picks this only off the pitch. Punched down to long-on"
"flipper but too straight. The quicker ball from the front of the hand, and Jadhav helps this along to deep square leg"

nice. Dipping legbreak on middle and leg. Defended with an open face
"too straight, clipped away off the toes for one"
"Jadhav takes on mid-on because he is inside the circle. Doesn't matter that he is hitting against the turn, and he sends it sailing over that man. A calculated risk there"

"wide on the crease, angles the ball in, Jadhav runs this down to third man"

Kohli opens the face late and gets a single to short third man
mis-hits the pull as the ball is not short enough but he clears the midwicket and gets a couple
"a touch short and Jadhav reaps dividends for that six over mid-on last over. That mid-on has gone back, and there is nobody at deep square. Jadhav helps himself to a four there"

"on a length, outside off, turning back in, defended"

"flat, straight, worked away for another easy single"
"pitches outside leg, turns away, takes his glove for a couple"
"short of a length, on the pads, worked away for a single"

soft hands as Root pitches this up. Takes a single to short fine leg
"flat, short, punched to long-on"
"down the wicket, uses soft hands to bunt this towards deep midwicket. He knows the ball is not going to travel too far past the 30-yard circle and he takes the second. The call for two is loud and clear and early, and Jadhav responds even though he is now panting"
"on a length, on off, worked to leg to bring up <strong>an excellent fifty</strong> at his home ground. Kohli walks up to shake his hand"
down the wicket to drive this to long-on for one
"down the wicket, beaten by the flight, and the ball lodges in his pad. Between the flap and his thigh. He walks back into the crease, and lets Buttler take it out"
"flatter, into the pads, worked to long leg"
"down the wicket again, gets too close to the ball, gets a single to deep midwicket"
stays back to help this flat delivery past short fine for a single

"down the wicket, Moeen bowls flat, and Kohli bunts it into the leg side for one"
shimmies down to punch one to long-on for one
leaves the crease again but can't beat short straight midwicket
"full, into the pads, worked away for a single"
"beautiful shot. England have strung together two decent overs, and Jadhav takes the calculated risk again. He leaves the crease, knows both long-on and long-off are back so he just chips this straight bat. Perfectly placed"
"Placement doesn't matter here. Kohli leaves the crease, he is not too close to the bat and finds the room to swing freely. Lofts this over cow corner for six"
"looks for the late cut, and the ball doesn't turn. Beats him on the outside edge. Rare event"
"flighted, middle and leg, driven to long-on"
"shimmies down the wicket, defends straight to the man inside the circle on the leg side but Kohli is alert to the sloppy throw on the half-volley, and he steals the single even though the ball has ricocheted only about 10 yards away from Buttler"
"down the wicket, not to its pitch but drives it for a single"
plays the vertical sweep but can't beat short fine leg
"down the wicket, Moeen drags this short, hit straight to cover"

"short, flat, on the stumps. Jadhav opens the face late, gets a single to short third man"
"down the wicket, beaten in the flight, hits this in the air but wide of midwicket"
"flat and quick, Jadhav hits this back to Moeen"
Jadhav is doing this at will. He has ruined a second straight good over from Moeen. He bowls flat and into the pads but he makes room and goes over mid-off. Reaches the boundary on a bounce
"slower ball first up, driven to long-off for one"
"another slower ball, goes off the pad to short fine"
"slower ball again, and because Buttler is up to the stumps he can't steal the single off the bunt"
"square-drive, and India again steal the momentum after a few dots. This time Willey provides him some width and bowls regulation pace. Kohli takes the front foot away and drives it to the right of point"
"slower ball again, pushed straight to cover, and he is frustrated that Jadhav hasn't come through for one. Jadhav's call is correct here. This would have resulted in a run-out"
"slower ball, full and wide, driven to long-off for one"
"short of a length, no room, punched to deep cover for one"
"full, middle and off, worked to leg"
"flat, down the leg side, and he helps it along. using the pace on the ball, placing it fine of short fine leg"
"opens the face, steers it from leg-stump line for a single to short third man"
"the rare mis-hit as he shimmies down the wicket. It doesn't carry to midwicket, though"
"full and straight, worked into the leg side for a single"
"slower ball, Jadhav opens the face, takes a single to short third"
"another slower ball, Kohli dabs on it for another single. That is 200 for India. Still only four down after being 63 for 4"
"slower ball again, opens the face again, takes a single to the right of short third man this time"
"this is the second regulation-paced delivery Willey has bowled in two overs, and both have gone for four. This is short, chest-high and he opens the face to guide it over short third. Gets into the 90s"
"driven wide of deep cover, and is still strong enough and fit enough take a second"
"slower ball, on a length, on off, and he drops and runs. That is some fitness and strength"
"flighted legbnreak, played to cover"
"slower through the air, just outside off, driven to long-off for one"
"sweeps from outside off, but finds short fine leg"
"legbreak, not short but the short Jadhav goes back and manufactures his length. Moeen puts a dive in at point to keep them down to two"
"and England concede another boundary after a string of decent deliveries. Rashid bowls short, Jadhav picks it early, and rocks back to pull. Not the cleanest of hits but he has hit this between long-on and deep midwicket"
"oh this is special. Nothing wrong with this delivery. A legbreak, full, outside off, and Jadhav drives this inside0out, over wide long-off for a flat six. This is exceptional batting"
"short of a length, Kohli walks at him, dabs it, and runs for his 99th run"
"full and straight, clipped away for one"
"on a length, straight, flicked to short midwicket"
"wide on the crease, short of a length, Kohli can't beat short midwicket with his push"
"on a length, drops this at his toes and rushes for the 100th. Jadhav does well to send him back because the run is not on"
"what a way to bring up that hundred. He dances down the wicket, and lofts this length ball over mid-on for a flat six. He is not celebrating too much just yet. What an exhibition this has been"
bouncer to start off with. Jadhav ducks it
"short again, pulled down into the ground, takes a single to deep square leg"
"down the wicket, drives this full ball to short straight cover"
"slower ball. Short of a length, outside off, gets a bottom edge as Kohli looks to cut away from the body"
"slower short ball, pulled to long leg for one"
good bouncer. Head high. Jadhav gets a top edge but it doesn't carry to long leg. Finally England bowl an over without a boundary in it. After eight overs
"short of a length, pulled to deep square leg for one"
"that's unbelievable. Rub your eyes and watch this again. This is against the law of physics. Slower ball, short of a length, no room to free his arms, and Kohli still goes in the air, and clears cow corner. It is just power from arms. I can imagine some West Indies batsmen having the audacity to even try such a shot"
steers one down to third man for one
"yorker, dug out to short straight midwicket"
slower ball gone wrong. Too far down the leg side and he glances it for four to enter the 90s
wide down the leg side. England are rattled
"full and straight, flicked to mid-on"
"low full toss, clipped past short midwicket and he comes back for two"
"driven on the up, wide of mid-off for one"
"short of a length, tucked away off the hip. Jadhav is cramping as he takes this single"
keeps the pull down as Stokes bounces him. Hit straight to short midwicket
"short, wide, cut away to deep cover"
"short of a length, steered away to third man for one"
"full and straight, clipped away for a single off the toes"
he goes full and straight with a strong off-side field. Kohli says thank you very much and drives him over midwicket
"short, wide, uppishly played between those two short covers, and still gets just the single with deep point sweeping behind him"
"bouncer, just outside off, Jadhav lets it be"
"that's the hundred. Lovely shot from Jadhav. Nothing wrong with the ball. Short of a length, not too wide, and he opens the face late to beat third man to his left. Kohli hugs him. Knocks him on the chest. And after the chat with his captain, Jadhav raises the bat to all the stands. This has been a truly exceptional innings. As one feedback said, the Collis King to Kohli's Richards"
steered down to third man for one
"short ball, mis-hit, and it bounces well short of deep square leg for one"
"oh Kohli for once has failed to finish off a chase. It's that man Stokes again, but is it too late? Kohli has played a modern classic here. Slower short ball, he looks to pull from outside off, and gets a top edge. Kohli knows he has made a mistake and his head falls away right away. Willey takes the catch at cover, and the crowd stands up for a great innings. Kohli acknowledges the crowd's response but he is bitterly disappointed he is not there when the winning runs are hit"
"short of a length, outside off, defended with an open face"
"short of a length, just outside off, defended with an open face again"
"short of a length, wide, Pandya beaten on the cut. Looks edgy. He needs to realise India will win if they bat through these overs now"
"bouncer, just outside off. This is really good from Stokes. Pandya throws his bat at it. The top edge clears slip, but this is not smart batting. Just weather the storm for a few minutes. The asking rate is in control here"
"on a length, on off, defended back to him"
"short of a length, punched wide of mid0-off, and Willey throws at Jadhav's end, making his stretch his cramping legs"
"Jadhav is crmaping but he is not running. He is down the wicket, and lofts this length ball over mid-off for a six. This should ease the pressure created by those dots but India need to go back to batting sensibly"
"that's a beauty from Ball. Short of a length, outside off, holds its line, beats the outside edge as Jadhav looks to work this to leg"
<strong>Jadhav is on the ground after playing this pull to deep midwicket.</strong> This could have been two but they don't get even a single. Jadhav is cramping badly here. Jadhav's parents watch on in concern from the stands
"meanwhile, out on the field, cramps in legs don't matter as Jadhav keeps middling his hits. He pulls this flat over deep midwicket for six more"
"and this is the poor delivery that Pandya needed to get into his innings. Short, down the leg side, helped along fine of fine leg. And the asking rate falls under six now, Stokes kicks the ground"
"short of a length, out off, dabbed to third man. Jadhav hobbles through for a single"
"short, into the pads, and Jadhav keeps pulling them for boundaries. Beats short fine leg to his right. beware the wounded batsman"
"slower short ball, cut away straight to point"
"full and straight, and Jadhav has now stolen a single to mid-on. Seems to be getting better with the cramp"
"slower short ball, Pandya keeps the pull down, takes a single to deep backward square leg"
"driven on the up, gets a single to deep cover"
"short of a length, straight, tucked away for a single"
looks to steer this short ball fine but is beaten by the pace. Ball has bowled this at 140ks
"looks for the ramp, then looks to pull out, then plays reluctantly. It is a good thing he has played it reluctantly because the third man is fine just for this shot. This one doesn't carry to him"
you can hear a pin drop in the stands. Jadhav has pulled one straight to deep square leg. England receive the boost but Jadhav is not worried about showing emotion. He calls Pandya through for a chat. And the crowd doesn't react nearly as generously as it did to Kohli when he was walking off. This has been a great innings. Just a shame about the cramps. England stay alive here
"short of a length, hit straight to mid-on, and Jadeja makes a confusing call. He charges down the pitch and shouts out no. Pandya is in danger here but mid-on doesn't field cleanly"
"short of a length, seams back in, takes the inside edge onto the pad. They take a single"
"what timing from Jadeja. On a length, and he flicks this on the up, wide of  mid-on, and it keeps running away for four. Just a defensive shot really"
"low full toss outside off, driven with an open face to deep cover"
"down the wicket, Stokes pulls the length back, Pandya drops this towards cover for one"
"short of a length, angling in, draws a highly ambitious lbw appeal. They have made a wasteful here. This is missing both on line and height. England will rue this if they are denied a wicket b y the umpire later in the innings"
"wide on the crease, angles this in, ramps Pandya up, draws a dot"
"into the pads, no turn, they steal a leg-bye despite Rashid at short midwicket. Stokes is filthy with him. Rightly so"
"length-ball offbreak, punched down to long-on for one"
goes back to a flat delivery. No turn. He punches it to deep cover for one
he stays composed and drives one to long-on for one
"short of a length, goes back to punch it for a single"
and Pandya keeps his head about him and bunts an offbreak into the leg side for another single. Singles from here on do it for india
"short of a length, nipping back in, goes off the thigh pad for a leg-bye"
"bouncer. A god ball. But hey, wait a second. it has been called a wide. Jadeja doesn't go for the hook and the umpire rules it over head high"
"stays short. Only rib high this time, and Jadeja short-arms this through midwicket for four. This should ease the nerves if that last over of six singles didn't do that already"
"short of a length, outside off, punched to point. Jadeja wants an overthrow off Pandya's body but Pandya shows sportsman's spirit and refuses to take the single"
"<strong>what is happening here?</strong> Pandya has nearly run himself out with Jadeja hitting this straight to short midwicket. They get a single off the overhtrow, though"
"full, straight, hit to leg, but can't beat the diving short midwicket"
"<strong>that's harsh</strong>. Poor umpiring at a crucial juncture. Slower ball, well inside the tram line as it beats him on the cut, and yet called wide. Nandan showing nerves here"
"full and straight, clipped away for a single. That poor wide call has cost England two runs"
they take the single to short midwicket and Stokes is hit in the arm and then in the ribs by Moeen's throw. Stokes should have been behind the stumps to try to run him out
"full and straight, hit straight to short midwicket. Calling is clearer now. Jadeja shouts a loud no"
"slower short ball, pulled to deep midwicket for one"
"slower ball, full and straight, the early call is for two but they get just the one to fine leg"
"full and straight, nearly a yorker, Stokes ekes out another dot as Jadeja plays this to short midwicket"
beaten on the cut but Buttler fails to gather this half-volley and India sneak in a bye
Jadeja has thrown it away. He is a better batsman than this. He can score a run a ball. He clears the front leg and pulls from wide outside off. Toe-ends this to mid-on. India leave the door open
short again. Just outside off. Pandya defends
slower short ball. Pandya is defeated on the cut but the bottom edge goes wide of the keeper for a single
"wide length ball. A stiff drive from Ashwin, and the thick edge goes for a single to third man"
"Pandya plays a lovely shot to ease the nerves a little. The crowd finds its voice again. Ball has been pushing him back with short balls, and just pitches one up to see if he is caught on the back foot. Pandya drives this half-volley between mid-off and cover. It races away for four"
"length ball, angling in, driven to long-on for one"
full toss. He gets away with it. Hit straight to short cover
"Pandya showing his mettle here. Lovely shot. Stokes pitches short, there is no width but he arches back to make room and opens the face at the last possible moment to beat third man to his left"
"pitched up, edged away to third man as he drives off the back foot, still expecting a short ball"
steers away a short ball to third man for a single. That should do it for India
"on a length, driven to long-on for a single"
"on a length, straight, Ashwin coolly plays this into the leg side for a couple. This is how you chase when the asking rate is under six"
good ball. Seams back in from short of a length. Cramps him up. Defended to leg
slower bouncer. Pandya lets it sail through over his head for a wide
"short of a length, into the body, uses soft hands for a single to leg"
"full, on off, driven to short cover"
"short of a length, outside off, punched in front of deep cover, and he comes back for a comfortable second"
"tries the yorker, strays down the leg side, concedes a single"
"short of a length, chest high, Pandya looks for a tip and run but Ashwin sends him back"
"nice legbreak, middle and leg, turning towards off, played back to him"
"full, too full, driven past the diving short cover for one"
drives a legbreak hard to long-off for one
uppish drive to long-off for a single. Rashid has bowled four legbreaks. I can bet the next one will be a googly
"yes it is a wrong'un but too full. And Pandya drops this into the off side for one, and they steal a seocnd overthrow. Just about mind you. Pandya's bat is on the line when Buttler collects and he is in in the next frame"
"and there is that Pandya swag. He has some flair, this boy. He has seen India close with some sensible batting, but ends it - his role with the bat - with a lovely inside-out loft over long-off for a six"
Ashwin lets himself go too and lofts a full offbreak from Moeen over long-on for a six more. They have ended it in some style
