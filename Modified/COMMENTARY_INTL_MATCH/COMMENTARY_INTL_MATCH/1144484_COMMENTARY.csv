"shapes away to beat Imam's poke, a very polite appeal but not out"
"goes full and straight from wide of the crease, Imam looks to play an on-drive but ends up getting a thick inside-edge onto the pad. <b> Excellent first over </b>"

gets half-forward and bunts this to mid-off for a quick single
"slants a length ball across, left alone. Good carry to the keeper"
"<strong>shades of Sanath Jayasuriya, wow!</strong> Length ball on the pads and he whips this over square leg. Strong bottom hands, timing and placement - impeccable. Super hit. How early did he pick the length? Terrific balance, sweet!"

tucks this into the midwicket region for an easy single
stands tall and bunts this gently into the off side
gets half-forward and defends to short cover
"gloves this down leg to the keeper. Cottrell salutes but it isn't a delivery you expect to strike with. Slipped it down leg, Imam looking to help it along but could only feather this."

"punched, this time in front of square on the off side. Long chase but pulled back"
"off the mark with an imperious flick, just holds up near the midwicket boundary. As a batsman, you can't ask for a better ball first up."
gift of a delivery and he gleefully accepts! Babar is on top of his game already. A full toss and he caresses it to the extra cover boundary. Apologetically done
"much better length - fuller and just around off, Babar rooted to the crease as he defends"
"full and angled across again, there is an invitation to drive if he likes, but Babar decides to leave"
"full and angled across, there's a hint of away movement this time, left alone once again"

good leave to a length ball slanted across

bunted back to the bowler
steers this down to square third man
"uses the width to arch back and help it along to third man. Timed well, straight to Oshane Thomas"
"<strong>the bouncer gets him!</strong> The raw pace of Russell has done the trick. Fakhar picks the length but is surprised by the zip as he shapes to pull this short ball, but is a tad late on the stroke as the <b> ball hits the grille of the helmet </b> and rolls back onto the stumps."
"surprised him with a short ball again, this one's bowled at 140kph, Sohail ducks"
<strong>hit on the stomach!</strong> It's all happening. Babar shapes to pull but this one just stopped on him a touch and he was through with the shot

"lifter, towards his ribs, he hops across and tucks this towards leg gully"
hops back and turns this incoming short ball to the leg side

another short ball to begin! Haris gets across and ducks under it
"ducks under this short ball on middle. <em>At the moment, Russell's operating just one way: short-short-short-short</em>"
"another short ball, this one doesn't bounce as much as Haris expects, avoided. <em>Cranked this one at 146kph</em>"
"he's got him! Russell, you legend. What a gamechanger he is! After going short-short-short, he zips one across at 145kph, Haris looks to ride the bounce but is very late on the stroke and gets the thinnest of edges to Shai Hope behind the stumps. Pakistan in trouble."
"right into the blockhole, somehow managed to bring his bat down in the nick of time to keep it out"
"length ball, steered straight to point"
"beaten on the flick, nipping into him from a length on the stumps and strikes him high on the thigh pad"
"good length outside off, steered towards gully"
"<b>dropped by Hetmyer on point</b>. Dug this in short and outside off, he had a slash at it, went to Hetmyer's immediate left. Easy enough catch, but pops in, and out."
"length ball on the stumps, worked away with his wrists to square leg"
"goes short again, and the batsman ducks underneath"
"tickled fine and he'll get a boundary for that. Nipping in off the seam but the line is wrong, ends up on the pads and he's able to help it down to fine leg"
"good length on off, tries to drive without moving his feet, inside half of the bat back to the bowler"
"nicely played, short ball but not very quick at 135 kph and he rocks back pull this with good timing to square leg. The fielder runs to his left and dives to save"

"back of a length outside off this time, nicely cut to deep point"
"pacier delivery, length ball outside off, hangs his bat a bit but squirts it down to third man"

"good length outside off, jabbed to third man from the crease"
"good length around the fourth stump, steered to point"

"short ball again, outside off and moving in, he ducks under it"
"length ball on the pads, turned wristily to deep square"
"<b>brilliant catch by Shai Hope</b> He's sprouted wings and flown to his right - and I mean flown because he was airborne and parallel to the ground - to pull off a stunner. That earlier drop isn't going to cost West Indies much after all. Outswinger that was going away from him, Babar had a somewhat lazy waft at it and took a thick edge. Should have ordinarily gone between keeper and slip, or been parried to the ground. Until Hope took off."
"greeted with a yorker first up, and he pats it back to the bowler"
<b>lovely</b>. Pressure? What Pressure? Hafeez gets a short ball outside off so he just goes on his toes and on his back foot to cut it magnificently to the point boundary
"bad ball, and put away in style! Straying on the pads, too full, and Hafeez plays the pick-up flick to perfection to send this to the deep midwicket fence. A despairing dive by the deep square leg running around is in vain"
"length ball on the pads again, but he misses out that time and doesn't connect"
"fuller on the fifth stump line, he comes on the front foot to meet it and drives it to cover"
"length ball outside off, steered to point"
"goes a bit wider of the crease to angle this in on a length around off, punched back to the bowler from the crease"
"digs it in short, but Brathwaite doesn't have the pace of the other West Indies bowlers and the batsman has to wait for the ball and manufacture pace on the pull shot to deep midwicket"
"he's going wide of the crease again, and sticking to the short-pitch strategy. Hafeez lets it go and has a wry smile on his face. That's because this went well over his shoulder and should have perhaps been wide"
"length ball on the stumps, pushed towards mid-on"
"short ball again, he swivels to pull this down to fine leg, who collects on the bounce. Got a thick top edge on that, but no real pace in the shot or the ball, so it doesn't carry."
"good line and length, in the corridor outside off and he lets it go through"
fuller length but tailing on the pads. He wanted to flick it away but slightly late on it and it hits his pad to roll back to the bowler
"fuller length on the fifth stump line, he comes on the front foot to drive, opens the bat face and times it well, but it's straight to point"
"straying in line again, ends up fullish on the pads, but Hafeez's gentle tap can't go past the in field"
"another short ball, but that bounces well above the batsman outside off, and the umpire calls it wide. Fairly flew after pitching"
"fuller on off stump, comes forward to check-drive it, mid-off dives and gets a hand to it, so it stops the boundary"
"full toss on off, punched from the crease but straight to extra cover"
"<b>Review for caught behind</b> Holder strayed on the legstump with a back of a length ball angling into the batsman, and he doesn't get enough on it to tickle it fine. Shai Hope immediately asked for a review though the umpire thought it had come off the thigh pad, saying he heard two noises. <b>And Hope is right</b>. He got a faint tickle on it, and then it went to the keeper off thigh pad. Captain gets captain, and Pakistan are sinking."
"angling across him from back of a length, he stays in his crease and punches towards extra cover"
"back of a length on the stumps, he goes back and tucks it to square leg"
"length ball outside off, pushed to cover"
"length ball moving in, but ends up on the pads and he's able to flick it to fine leg"
"<b>Gayle's caught it!</b> The West Indians have come out with a simple, yet brutally effective plan, and Pakistan are falling to it. Short, short, short - wicket. This was another short one, Imad tried to pull it, got a top edge that swirled to Gayle's right at slip, and he stretched out to pluck it with one hand."
"good length outside off, he comes on the front foot to drive to extra cover"
"fuller on middle and leg, he jabs it down to deep square"
"<b>nailed in front</b>. Good length, slightly on the fuller side, pitches on middle and beats him with pace. He was playing down the wrong line, and he's caught on the crease with the ball thudding into pad. Oshane goes up, and so does the umpire's finger"
"full on off, steered to point"
"ooh that's gotta hurt. Back of a length and Hasan is ducking into it while trying to swat it away with his bat, using the bat more to protect himself than to score runs, with eyes off the ball. It hits him on the glove and rolls to square leg"
worked to deep square
"length ball on the pads, he gets inside the line and tickles it to fine leg"
"Beaten. Back of a length in the corridor and moving in, sneaks past the outside edge"
"<b>soft, soft dismissal</b> and again it's to a ball that's shorter than a good length. This was not a bouncer, but back of a length outside off. Hasan thought he'd have a thrash at it and went for the pull, but the problem is, he's not a top order batsman and was late on it. The ball takes the toe-end to swirl comfortably to Cottrell at mid-off for the simplest of catches"
"good length on off, defended off the front foot"
"back of a length outside off, rising up to chest high, he stays beside the ball and squirts it to third man"
"fuller on the pads, flicked to deep midwicket to keep strike"
"length ball on middle and leg, nudged to mid-on"
back of a length
"if it's a short ball, it's going to be wicket! On target bouncer has Hafeez taking ungainly evasive action while trying to duck/sway out of the way. But his bat is left hanging in the air, and the ball pings off to fly to fine leg, where Cottrell dives forward to take a smart catch"
"length on the pads and tucked to square leg, but he has overstepped. So it's a <b>free hit</b>. And that's a BIG over-step. Almost as big as another bowler involved in this match bowled in this country, some nine years back..."
"backing away to have a swat at it. Another short ball directed in the line of the stumps, and he swings and misses"
"back of a length but straying on leg, and he's flicked off his hips to fine leg"
"another short ball, fended down to square leg off his chest"
"short of length on middle and leg, defended"
"clobbered over deep midwicket. Banged in short, looked like Wahab had already made up his mind. Super hit"
"big swing down the ground, beaten. Backed away to get underneath this yorker-length delivery, swung through early."
"lifter outside off, fended into the off side"
"backs away and swings this one over the infield, trickles to the cover boundary. Useful runs. Just cleared his front leg and gave that a good whack"
"this has gone a long, long way into the stands at deep square. Backed away, Holder followed him but it didn't matter. Wahab muscled that away. Incredible strike and the Pakistani fans in the crowd have something to cheer, finally."
"backs away to carve this behind point, misses this yorker-length delivery"
fended towards point. Excellent short ball from Oshane
"backs away to slap this over cover, beaten. But he'll get a no-ball and a <strong>free-hit</strong> to make amends. Replays confirm this was a <strong>horrendous no-ball call from the umpire.</strong>"
walks across and works this down to a hobbling Russell at long leg
"full, straight and gone! Such poor application. Why would you expose all three stumps and slog wildly when you have a lifetime of overs remaining?"
"good length angling into him and moves a touch away, Gayle jabs it back from his crease"
"length ball on the stumps, nudged gently towards midwicket. The fielder is hanging back so they take a quick single"
"length ball on the stumps, he shuffles across to flick, but can't go past square leg"
"fuller on off, driven to mid-off coming on the front foot"
"going across him, and ends up well wide of off, he has a thrash at it, but doesn't time it well and slaps to mid-off"
straying on leg and picked off the pads to fine leg
"very full angling into him, clipped to wide mid-on"
"misses his line, too far down leg and he'll have to rebowl that. Fortunate perhaps that Hope didn't connect, and tickle it fine for a boundary"
"length ball outside off, steered to a squarish third man"
"low full toss, intended yorker, pacy one at 143 kph, Gayle gets his bat down and jabs it to mid-off"
"<b>top edge goes over the keeper</b>. 140 kph bouncer got big on him, Gayle was looking to use his power to pull it, but gets a top edge. Lands in the safest of places though, right over the wicketkeeper, where no fielder stays"
"<b>slashed hard</b> and that was more intentional. Given width outside off, too full and he has the room to swing his arms, carves it to the third man boundary"
"<b>loud shout but that was probably going down leg</b>. Hasan and the whole team were appealing frantically, but you're not going to get those. Pitched on leg and was moving in, Gayle missed the flick, but the ball would have missed the stumps. Pitched well outside leg actually"
"stand and delivery by Hope. Short and wide outside off, he stands tall and slaps this through cover. Hafeez gives chase and slides to pull the ball back in"
"length outside off, defended to point"
"back of a length, angling across him, he punches to mid-off"
"goes for the pull off a short ball, but doesn't time it. Top edge but it flies well above the in-field and lands in the midwicket area."
"leading edge now, pops up in the air but well to the bowler's right and well short of mid-on. Hope's had a few uncertain moments. This was a length ball that held it's line and Hope was playing inside it, trying to flick"
"swing and a miss. Back of a length, angling across him, he stays in his crease and tries to cut it, but the ball goes over the bat. Half-hearted appeal"
"clears his front leg, gives himself room and plays the pick-up shot to send this over cow corner - but he's not timed it and gets more height than distance. No fielder there though, so it plonks safely onto the grass"
"<b>boom, Chris Gayle is in the house</b>. Too full and Gayle nails the pickup that time, smashes it over long-on. Was the slower ball, off-cutter perhaps. But Gayle read it"
"<b>smashed</b>, but without timing. And it still manages to clear the straight boundary. Another full ball, Gayle clears his leg again and thrashes it with a full swing of his arms, doesn't time it at all, almost slices it. Still gets maximum"
"He's just looking to take the attack to the bowler now, but Hasan bowled that well enough. Followed him as he was walking across and Gayle hoicks it to deep square leg"
"bouncer on target, and Hope ducks under it"
"another short ball, this time he rocks back and pulls it hard, from in front of his face down to deep midwicket"
"<b>take that</b>. On the front foot and slap-drives it through extra cover for a boundary. This was angling across him and on the shorter side, gave him room and width to smash it"
"late on it, stays rooted to the crease and manages to drop this length ball down near his toes at the last moment."
"slices it high in the air and is taken. Hope hasn't looked very fluent in this innings, despite a couple of crisp shots. He wanted to go over the top again, but sends it swirling to mid-off's left. Hafeez sprints and tumbles to complete the catch"
"full on the toes, clipped to square leg"
"short ball, an dhe ducks under it. Too short though and too high above the batsman, so it's a wide"
"back of a length outside off, drops it down towards point from his crease"
""
"full toss,  high full toss on off stump, punched to extra cover"
"too close to cut, but tell that to Gayle! slashed from very close to his body, but gets enough on it to send it to the third man boundary. Third man was in the circle and it flew over the infield"
"slower yorker on leg stump, clipped to mid-on"
"another slightly slower one at 124 kph, Gayle was backing away to smash it through off, but ends up defending it tentatively back to the bowler"
"keeping to the 125kph pace region, back of a length and jagging away from Gayle, squares him up and gets the edge, but soft hands mean it bounces well in front of slip"
"<b>dismissed</b> from his presence. Short ball at normal pace, Gayle rocks back and unleashes a fierce pull. Thwack into the boundary boards"
"back of a length outside off, defended towards point"
"<b>caught at second slip</b>. Off-cutter, pitches back of a length outside off and seemed to hold on the pitch a bit, and bounce more than Bravo expected. He ends up fending it from his crease, takes the shoulder of the bat and second slip holds on to his right at shoulder height."
"fuller on the stumps, twirled to fine leg with his wrists"
"length ball on off, jabbed to point, bringing his bat down a tad late"
"length ball, moving in, but ends up on the pads and rolls to short fine leg"

"swing and a miss. Short outside off, Gayle wanted to send this to downtown Bristol with a fierce pull, but doesn't connect"
"high full toss, Gayle is surprised by it and ends up patting it back to the bowler. Looks to square leg, but the umpire doesn't think that was a no-ball"
"<b>well directed bouncer</b>. Pacy and very on target, would have taken off Gayle's head, but he arched his back to get out of the way"

"back of a length outside off again, Gayle stands tall and punches to mid-off's right"
"slapped over mid-off and into the boundary. Too short and sat up to be hit, Gayle cleared his leg and thwacked it hard"
<b>shot!</b>. Coming into him from back of a length and cramps him for room even as he was moving away but he manages to cut it powerfully over cover-point
<b>boom</b> too short and pulled disdainfully to deep square leg for another boundary
"too full, ends up as a full toss on the pads. He misses his flick and they take a leg-bye. But <strong>Gayle is holding his back as he limps across to the other end</strong>. Trouble? Hopefully nothing serious"
"length ball outside off, Pooran plays inside the line and ends up feeling for it as it whistles past his outside edge"
moving away off a length and it beats his outside edge again. Pooran wanted to prod it away.
"banged in short, Gayle ducks under this"
"<b> there's a 33-ball half-century </b> with a gentle nudge down to fine leg. He's cringing a little with that recurring back issue, but he's played really well."
jeez! What power. He's given it a proper wallop. On the up to the extra cover fence. Tracer bullet stuff
"squared up by the length but he gets some bat to this, runs down to third man where Wahab throws himself to stop it"
"point takes a dolly, Gayle was increasingly looking edgy with that back issue. Takes a swipe at this length ball, gets a top-edge and that's an easy catch. He's done his job though."
"nice and full on the stumps, defended"
"skiddy short ball, pulled to deep midwicket"
"<b> put down at deep square! </b> Full marks for the effort though. The plan was right. Short at good pace, outside off, above his shoulders, getting him to fetch the pull from way outside off. No control for Hetmyer but he survives. Possible that Imam may have just reacted a split-second late. Lucky escape"
fends this lifter to get a thick outside edge that flies over the slip cordon to the third man boundary
"flat-batted disdainfully over mid-on! Did he just look in some sort of discomfort earlier? Woah, no traces of that with this one. Thumped. Special, absolutely special"
"bounces away from Hafeez running around at fine leg, another top-edge to an ill-advised pull. Gets away"

"backs away to slap that, but gets a thick outside edge, one bounce to the third man boundary. Not where he wanted but he'll take the runs and West Indies are one blow away from a convincing win."
beaten as he's way too early into this pull off a slower delivery
"<strong>that's the end of that, and it's a monstrous hit to finish it!</strong> Backed away, the bowler followed him but he still managed to hold his shape and muscle this pull to clear deep midwicket. As convincing as victories get, don't think West Indies would've even dreamt of a victory margin of this sorts. Lot of soul-searching for Pakistan, but the format gives them some leeway"
