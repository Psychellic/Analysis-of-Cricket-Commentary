"full on middle, and driven on the up towards the leg side. Rohit, at mid on, dives to his right to intercept"
"<b>edged!</b> But falls just short of Dhoni. Length ball on off, and he tries to defend off the back foot. The ball shapes away slightly, and takes the edge. Dhoni was just too far behind"
"length ball outside off, but much more confidently played this time. Gets inside the line of the ball and offers the full face of the bat"
"length ball on middle, but angling into Roy's body. Cramped for space, and he can't tuck this away to square leg. Hits his thigh"
"full outside off, and firmly driven off the front foot. Struck hard, but straight to Kohli at cover"
"full and wide outside off, shaping further awya and YJB shoulders his arms. Not too much bounce either, going to the keeper on the bounce"

"full just outside off, and Bairstow tries to drive once again. The ball's too close to his body, so all he can do is inside-edge it onto his pads"

"length ball outside off, and once again cut square off the front foot. Straight to cover point though"
"width offered outside off, and Bairstow cuts it hard once again. But the off-side field is packed, and this time the shot finds Pandya at point"

"length ball outside off, and Roy tries to ride the bounce. Attempts the punch away from his body to cover"
"full on off, and Roy takes a step forward to drive through the ball's line. The bat turns in his hand, and it's been mistimed to md on"

"full outside off, and Bairstow steers this down the ground. Finds mid on once again"
"full outside off again, and Bairstow tries to slog through the ball's line. Comes off the inside half of the bat, and once again it trickles down to mid on. He'll be disappointed missing out twice in a row"

"short and wide, and Bairstow cuts this late. The ball stays low too, and he finds Kuldeep at backward point"

"too full for the cut! Lands outside off, but Bairstow backs away to slap this square. It's a quicker one from Hardik, and the batsman is too late into his shot"
"full on off, and that's been pushed off the front foot past midwicket. Tapped into the gaps, and Kuldeep runs down the slope to cow corner to retrieve it"
"length ball just outside off, and Bairstow places a late cut between point and gully. But Hardik runs to his right, sticks his hand out, and the ball stays in his palm! Saves a certain boundary for sure"
"full, but wide outside off. Roy walks down the wicket and defends it back to the bowler. Was in two minds there"

"<b>lifted!</b> Full outside off, and he gets to the pitch of the ball before lofting it over cover. Not off the bat's sweet spot, but still enough to go just beyond the extra-cover boundary"
"wide outside off, and cut off the front foot. Splits the gap between cover and cover point, but there's a fielder in the deep for that shot"
"length ball outside off, and Bairstow steers a cut over point! Not much movement of the feet, but he kept eyes on the ball and met the delivery very late. Placed to perfection"

"full outside off, and Roy's through his drive too early. Checks his shot at the end, and the ball loops straight over Kohli at cover. Timed well enough though"
"full outside off, but shapes into Roy. He pushes to mid off, and calls early for the single. Gotta hurry, but the throw doesn't find the stumps"
"good length outside off, but too close to Bairstow's body. He tries to cut it anyway, and eventually steers this past point for a single"

"good length on middle, and spinning into Bairstow. He backs away to make some extra room, and then punches it off the back foot to long off"
"full outside off, but using the knuckle ball! Bairstow tries to slog sweep into the leg side, but the ball sneaks under his bat and goes through to Dhoni on the bounce"
"full outside off, and Bairstow drags a slog over to the cow-corner boundary. Another slower ball, and that's why he drags this squarer than he would've wanted. Enough power behind it for the ball to find the fence"
"length ball outside off, and Bairstow works this off the back foot to square leg. Played from outside off though"
"good length kjust outside off, and Roy's punchy shot finds it's way back to Kaul. Aggression from the bowler, as he contemplates having a shy at Roy's stumps"

"full on off stump, and Roy goes for the big slog sweep! Down on one knee, and timed really well over to the midwicket boundary, but Umesh Yadav was placed there for that shot.

"perfect length. Yorker on off again, and Willey taps this to the leg side. The umpire says 'no ball' though. <b>Free hit coming up</b>"
"full outside off, and that's been driven to cover for a single. Kohli gets to the ball, and has a shy at the non-striker's stumps, but misses out on the run out. Chahal is slow to back up in the deep, and that means England get an extra overthrow run"
"low full toss outside off, and that's been slapped to cover for a single"

"power in that! Some width outside off, Dhawan drives on the up through the covers"
"and again...almost! A crunching drive off the front foot is cut off by Bairstow who is now in some pain. And he's leaving the field, holding his right hand down by his side"
"comes round the wicket, not in control this time, goes after a full delivery outside off, aiming for another drive, loses his shape and takes an inside edge past the stumps to fine leg"

"full at off stump, driven along the ground and through the hands of Wood in his follow through but mid-off can tidy up"

It's a back-of-a-length delivery, a touch slower at 81mph, Rohit eyes up the leg side and plays a horrid swipe - head in the air - and his leg stump is hit. Credit to Wood, think the subtle change of pace played a role in that. But Rohit didn't need to have a slog"

"rocks back to a shorter ball, pulls it straight down the ground and has Stokes pulled off a <B>brilliant save</b> running across at long on? Made a lot of ground then slid around the rope...think this may be a boundary, though. Well, no, in fact he had pushed the ball away by the time he touched the rope. Top work"
works out to square leg and after some confusion over whether to take the run they walk through for a single
tucked off the pads into midwicket
"a flatter delivery, at the stumps, nudge into midwicket for a harmless single"
"a googly, full and straight, defended"
"that's more like it, latches onto some width outside off and drives through the covers wide of the sweeper...9999 runs"
"full outside off, opens the face and steers to third man and that's <b>10,000 ODI runs for MSD</b>. Barely a murmur around the ground"
"round the wicket, short of a length and beats the outside edge as it rises through to Buttler"
"beats him again with a short delivery, angles in to middle and off and he plays inside the line"
"full outside off, left alone"
"full at middle and off, clipped wide of mid-on and England won't mind that single in the slightest"
"good length outside off, left alone (playing for the draw?)"
tries to play at this one but gets beaten as he attempts to open the face and steer it away
"back of a length, angled in at off stump, pushed to point"
"just gets a little too straight with this one, short of a length, gets inside the line and tucks to fine leg"
"full outside off, pushed to backward point"
"back of a length at off stump, angled to point again and it's wide enough of Moeen for the single this time"
"length ball outside off, worked to mid-on and not much happens"
"short outside off, a slower ball into the pitch, slapped to cover on the edge of the ring and doesn't even try to run"
short ball is pulled to long leg for a walked single
"round the wicket, pushes away from his body at a full ball and is beaten"
"edged but doesn't carry to slip, palmed away behind him for a single, pushed out away from his body"
pushed into backward point with an open face
chopped into the pitch and it bounces back to Willey
"driven through the off side, out to the sweeper. Doesn't run. A few boos around the ground"
more boos as he pushes a length delivery to cover
"shorter, outside off, guided to backward point"
"down the leg side, a diving take from Buttler...sadly that means another delivery"
taps a good length delivery to the off side
"full outside off, driven back down the pitch"
"well, there we are...and he's found deep midwicket! Charged down the pitch, went for a big blow over the leg side, and it's held just inside the rope by Stokes"
"short on off stump, angled down to third man"
driven into the off side
"that's stone dead...full and straight, playing across the line although Kaul has called for the <b>review</b>. No inside edge, hitting the back pad and hitting"
gets forward and defends to the covers
"angled into the pads, slips down the leg side and beats everything and everyone...given wide, although there was a sound as it went past the pads"
"speared in towards leg stump, takes the pad but comfortably missing the stumps"
defends a good length ball to cover
"full and straight, clipped off the pads down to long leg"
"very full at off stump, dug out to point"
"back of a length at leg stump, defended"
"some aggression and it's a very nice shot, in fact, as he drives a full delivery straight down the ground. Mid-off is up and long-on can't get across"
two chances for a run out here as this is defended into backward point and there's almighty confusion
"a short ball from round the wicket, he ducks underneath"
"full outside off, defended to the covers"
"back of a length outside off, slides past the outside edge"
"full, he gets across and clips to mid-on"
"full outside off, pushed into the covers"
"back of a length at off stump, defended"
"driven through the off side, Bairstow does the mopping up around the boundary"
"full at the stumps, driven to cover"
gets forward and drives to mid-off
"a shorter ball, he goes for the pull and it comes from high on the bat over midwicket"
slips down the leg side
"goes for a booming drive at a length ball angled across him, flies of Buttler through the vacant slip cordon (England could have had three in there!)"
"and they are all out off the final ball, Chahal tries to send this down the ground but can't clear Stokes at long-on"
