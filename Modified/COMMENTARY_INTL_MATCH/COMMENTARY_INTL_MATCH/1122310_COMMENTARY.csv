good length and zipping in from outside off. Does well to take the bottom hand off as he allows this to come onto the bat...The ball seems to have struck him on the back elbow as he was trying to take it off the bat. Getting some spray treatment. He's having difficulty moving that arm now too. Looks like they're considering taking him off. He was hit flush on the elbow and the flexibility of that arm has been affected. Physio's run some tests to see how his grip is...and they've decided he should go. <b>Masakadza walking off.</b>

Clearly caught in two minds. It's a very very faint edge, hardly any disturbance during the replay, but a big enough one as the ball is adjacent to the inside edge of the bat. Good decision. That was faint enough for him not to feel it, so the review can't be critcised either. Superb bowling, that came in, with the shiny side"
