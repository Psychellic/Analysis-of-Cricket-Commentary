"<b>chance!</b> But it's a very tough one. Farhan drove a full one hard back at the bowler, who got half a hand to it, and that was all reflex. Even the umpire took evasive action"
"<b>picks out the man in the deep!</b> Ronchi was looking to get after the bowling, but he hits a length delivery almost straight out to Dawson at deep midwicket. The umpires just ask to have another look for the no-ball, and it's <i>very</i> tight. Eventually they decide he's got something behind the line, so the dismissal stands"

"Delport uses his bottom hand to rifle a swipe out to wide long on, and the fielder has some work to do to cut that one off as well"

"Bell clears his left leg and sets himself to scythe a cut away, but he can't quite beat the field and the only result is a quick single"
"<b>in the air, and safe!</b> The thing that saved Delport here was the complete lack of timing, a short ball rocketing up at him and taking the splice of his pull shot, but landing safely"
"Bell uses the predictable short length now, waiting deep in the crease and ramping another short ball up and over the keeper. Some athletic fielding down at third man saves two runs"
"<b>cut over point!</b> Bell spots width, and doesn't bother keeping this one down"
"<b>almost chipped back to the bowler!</b> Riaz comes around the wicket, and the ball takes the leading edge of Bell's nudge to leg, popping up in the air. But it hits the ground before Riaz can get to it, and the pair share a smile and a friendly word at the end of the over. No, really"

"<b>edged, and four!</b> Lucky strike for Delport, who threw his hands into a drive and edged the ball down to third man"
"Hasan comes back, and his first ball seams in off the track, Bell flicking out through square leg for one"
"<b>Hasan strikes!</b> The bowlers have kept them quiet with a short-pitched attack, but this one was full and straight, with a bit of cut on it, and delivered from around the wicket. Delport made room, but the cut and the length took the ball past the bat and onto the stumps"
"Hasan greets him with a first ball yorker, and there's a quick single taken. Hasan charges around, picks the ball up and throws the stumps down with Asif Ali's foot still in the air ... but his bat grounded! Could have been a very interesting one, had his bat been in the air"
"slower ball from Hasan at 115km/h, it slips out as a low full toss and Bell drives for a single"

"Faheem laces a good-looking cut first ball, and they take a single as the point fielder stops it but then has a shy and misses"
"<b>the timing is good, the placement is even better</b>. Bell backs away a touch and cuts in the air, beating point but not going so square that the cover sweeper can cut it off. And he's into the 40s"
"<b>through the leg side now!</b> The ball was a touch on the short side, and Bell set himself deep in the crease to have a mow into the leg side, getting it out of the middle and beating long on's right"
"chipped in the air into the open space in front of midwicket, just the one"
"short, pulled, and it goes in the air but lands safely in front of midwicket. Bell slips turning for the second, so it's only a single"
"it's short - again - and Faheem pulls hard and high, but only as far as the fielder at deep square leg"
"short again, and this one possibly just held up a little in the pitch. Whatever the case, Bell is much too early into his pull, and misses"
"pushed down the leg side, and he'll have to bowl that one again"

"Riaz comes around the wicket, delivering the ball full and straight at the stumps. Well kept out"

"<b>caught off a no ball!</b> It was on a length but quite wide. Bell held nothing back on the cut, but he sent it straight out to the deep point fielder. He was trudging off, but the umpires held him back, and Riaz has nothing behind the line. Instead of a wicket, it's a no ball and the next one's a <b>Free Hit</b>"

"big swish outside off, but this one is through him in a flash"
"another fiery yorker, Bell gets bat on it to tap the ball to point, and takes on Andre Fletcher's arm from deep point for a risky second run to keep the strike. He's not quick enough, and he's got to go"
"the final ball is another quick yorker that hits the no. 11 on the pad. Riaz appeals, but the umpire says no. They ask for a <b>review</b>. Replays show there's no bat on it, it hits the back leg, but the all is missing the leg stump, according to the ball tracker. That looked closer live, but I guess it's not out"

"<b>a second wicket for the teenager!</b> This is a slightly fortunate one. The ball was quick, but it was on leg stump and Malan could have had runs, had he hit it a yard either side of the fielder. Instead, he tapped it straight to him, Samit holding a simple catch"
"chipped uppishly! This rose off a leg stump line once again, and Amin was a little rushed in his attempted glance, but the ball - if it hit any bat - goes to ground between the short fine fielder and the wicketkeeper"
"is this another wicket off a no ball? No, he's <i>just</i> got something fractionally behind the line. But that was mighty close. Faheem starts just short of a good length and Imam walks out at him, slicing the ball high in the air and out to Sami, who holds a regulation chance"

"low full toss, and it's clapped down to long on for one"

"<b>and again!</b> He put a little more power behind this one, and the ball cut a sine curve through the hazy night air before it smashed into the stands. Big hit"
"<b>another boundary!</b> Pollard clubs this leg side, powerfully so but it lands inside the rope this time"
"<b>beaten outside off!</b> Shadab rushes this one through outside off, beating Sammy's poke"
"Sammy is forward to drive to cover, handing the strike over"
"<b>inside edge!</b> That was <i>so</i> close. Shadab loops down a wrong 'un, Pollard thinks it's a legbreak and has a big drive, the ball takes the inside edge and bounces millimetres past the stumps"
"<b>out of the ground!</b> He's clearly put the last ball out of his mind, and just leans forward to thunder this one way, way back over Shadab's head. New ball please!"
"<b>they're going to need yet another ball!</b> This was flighted outside off and Pollard threw his enormous arms through the line to hammer his drive cleanly over long off, and out of the ground yet again. And that also <b>brings up the team 100</b>"

"pace on the ball again, and Pollard clips a single off his legs"

"<b>squeezed down to third man!</b> The fielder was up at short third man, and Sammy jammed his bat down on a wide yorker to collect a boundary to the fielder's left"
"chipped down to long off, where Shadab stops the ball on the bounce"
"<b>how has this gone for six?</b> We saw this sort of strokeplay from de Villiers earlier, and we almost expected it. You don't expect this from Pollard. He walks across to the off side, looking for the paddle-scoop, but the ball is wide, so he just turns the bat and guides it over third man instead. What a shot! And it <b>takes him to fifty</b>"
"<b>caught on the boundary!</b> Pollard wanted a sixth six. The ball was full and wide, and the shot was on, but he just got too underneath it and the sub fielder - Salt - held his nerve and the catch very close to the boundary marker. Will that decide the game?"
"slammed down the ground, but he doesn't place it well enough to beat the long off fielder"
"<b>clubbed by Riaz!</b> He sizes up his first ball, clears his front leg, and powers it down the ground. They're going down swinging"
"<b>even bigger!</b> And this one goes all the way. Musa misses his length, it's a half volley and Riaz gets underneath it to smash the ball over long on"
"yorker this time, and it's slapped to mid off where Faheem dives to stop it"
"Sammy winds up and slams his drive out to the left of long off, who sprints around and dives to keep them to two"
"<b>Musa strikes with his last ball!</b> It's a full toss and Sammy loses his shape as he tries to power it out of the ground. The ball goes way up into the night sky, and the super-sub Salt is the one who charges round the outfield and holds the catch between deep cover and long off"

"full and wide again, but this time Riaz gets bat on it and finds a single"
"a dipping full toss outside off is pushed into the covers, and they take a single"
"another low full toss outside off, but again he finds the man at cover - it's the captain, Sami, who stops the shot"
"Hasan walks way over to the off side but Faheem follows him, even wider. Hasan looks expectantly at the umpire, but it's not a wide as he had walked so far across"
"Faheem sticks with his full-toss-outside-off approach, and Hasan can only drive to long off"
"yorker this time, and it's dug out to cover - just singles off an excellent death over"
"<b>he's hit it for six!</b> Sami slips in a low full toss, but it's straight and Riaz dispatches it acres over wide long on. Game on!"
"<b>caught at cover!</b> Or is it? It was a low full toss, outside off, and Riaz thumped it to cover, where Farhan was hovering. The ball dipped on him as it got close, but he timed his dive forward perfectly and holds a clean catch. The umpires want to have another look at the replay, but that just serves to confirm Riaz' demise"
"<b>big hit, straight, but not straight enough!</b> Umaid has a go at his first ball, and he actually gets an excellent connection on it, but hits it straight down Faheem's throat at long off. <b>He's on a hat-trick!</b>"
"<b>Sami wins the game with a hat-trick!</b> Hasan had to go for it. The ball was right up to him, a little wide of off, and he swung mightily, but could only get it as far as Farhan at cover. The ball went high, but it didn't go far, and Sami is pumped!"
