"length outside off, goes away with the angle, left alone. Not much bounce or carry on that occasion"
"<strong>a huge appeal for lbw</strong>, but Aleem Dar is unmoved. A bit of discussion if Sri Lanka want to review, yes, signals Dimuth. But looks like he was a bit too late. It was a length ball around leg, Amla comes forward and looks to defend, misses and is rapped dead-front, replays show it would have been out had Sri Lanka acted fast"

Amla hasn't moved, Sri Lanka are celebrating but the umpires converge to discuss if it carried. <b> The soft signal from umpire Kettleborough is not out. </b> Coming back to the delivery, this is short of length that nips away from outside off, got it to lift off the deck, Amla was looking to play initially but then changed his mind and tried to withdraw his bat at the end, but it was too late. It took the edge and it was superbly grabbed at second slip. It was such a clean catch that <b> Michael Holding on air said 'I'm walking back to the Caribbean if that's given not out. </b>. Fortunately, sanity prevails, there's conclusive evidence to overturn the decision and Amla is walking back."

"this is a corker of a delivery! Would've troubled any top order batsman. It's full, gets this to bend back in really late, Markram plays all around it, misses and this beats the inside edge to hit the pad and sneak through the gap to crash into the stumps.

presses half-forward and bunts it into the of side
"Has he tickled this down leg, there was a definite noise as this went past the bat. Umpire Kettleborough says no, and <strong>Sri Lanka have reviewed immediately.</strong>. Length ball slanting down, Faf late on this flick, but as it passes the batsman, the pad isn't anywhere near.

"back of length around off and middle, pushes it towards mid-on"
"<strong>is that a run-out at the bowler's end?</strong> It was fuller on the off stump, de Kock drives it back towards the bowler who gets his foot in line, and the deflection hits the stumps at the bowler's end. Bavuma was out of his crease but dives back promptly but was he quick enough? It's touch and go. Did he manage to get some part of his bat behind the line when the bails were dislodged, doesn't look like and the third umpire thinks that's out. An unfortunate manner to be dismissed"

"Olivier bangs it in in his own half, and Perera ducks under a ball that leaps over him but dies on its way through to the keeper"

"brilliant shot this time, a short of length delivery outside off, bowled at 135 kph, de Silva rises, gets on the top of the bounce and punches it through covers"

"<b>edged past a diving Faf du Plessis!</b> The last one came in through the air, this one nipped away off the track and Dhananjaya went fishing for it outside off, edging the ball past Faf at second slip. A little worryingly, the SA captain is down and clutching his shoulder a little - remember, it's been injured before - while at the other end Rabada tumbles through a somersault as the catch goes down. Yes, you read that right"

"angled in to the right-hander's stumps, and it's tapped to mid on"
"<b>stroked through mid off!</b> Even with a hint of shape through the air, Dhananjaya is nicely into position to drive and threads his shot straight through the gap to the right of mid off. Top shot"
"nurdled square, just the one"
"<b>pulled in the air, but dropping safely!</b> There are two men out on the leg side for the hook, but Perera still took them on. Fortunately for him, the ball lobbed tamely off the splice and so didn't reach them"
"punched firmly off the back foot, and they're back for the second"
"straighter from Steyn, and the response from Perera is defensive"
"short, but it's down the leg side and it's fended further in that direction, for runs"

"Perera is slightly too early into his drive as Rabada pitches one up outside off, but he takes his bottom hand off the bat to check the shot"
"no checking that one, Perera staying deep in the crease to <b>hammer a cut shot</b> in the air but right through the gap to the left of gully. Fiercely struck!"

"there are cries of  'catch it!' as Perera cuts again, but the ball dips and drops well in front of Markram in the gully"

"quicker one to end the over, and it keeps Perera honest"
"Dhananjaya <b>brings up the 200</b> with a rifled pull, stepping back and hammering the ball well in front of square"
"Rabada switches to around the wicket and tests Dhananjaya with another bumper, which is pulled to square leg"
"Rabada aims another one for the batsman's grille, but again he's back and across to aim a controlled pull out to the man at long leg, and that <b>takes Sri Lanka's target to exactly 100</b>"
"a <b>direct hit</b> in the field as Perera pushes to Hamza at cover, but he's safely home. Not a bad throw at all, with only one stump to aim at"
"Dhananjaya walks into a defensive push, sending the ball bouncing to point"
"another short one, but it's met with another controlled pull down to fine leg for one more"
"There is a huge, emotive and extended appeal from Maharaj as he hits a sweeping Dhananjaya on the thigh. Umpire Dar says no, but they ask for a <b>review</b>. It's pitched in line, and it hasn't hit the bat ... but it is hitting the stumps. <b>Three reds on the review, and South Africa have the breakthrough!</b>"
"<b>two in two!</b> Maharaj flights one in from around the stumps and finds grip and spin. The ball kisses the outside edge and flies low to du Plessis at slip. He was left out of the Tests against Pakistan, he only bowled three overs in the first innings, and now <b>Keshav Maharaj is on a hat-trick</b>"
<b>beaten outside off!</b> Embuldeniya stays deep in the crease to defend one that shoots past his outside edge. Close!
"tossed up, and he's on the drive to cover"
"<b>sharp spin</b> in to the left hander! Maharaj has brought South Africa right back into this, and it's all happening now"
"a touch of grip off the surface, but Lasith deals well with it and taps back to the bowler"
"rising outside off, and it's cut out to deep point for one"
"<b>sharp stuff from Markram at short leg!</b> Lasith dug a yorker out but over balanced in doing so, Markram plucked it out of the air from under the helmet and very nearly pulled off a repeat of his first innings dismissal of Rajitha"
"a wristy flick sends the ball rolling out through midwicket, and they're back for the second"
"<b>short, and gloved, but safe!</b> Rabada dug it in and Lasith ducked and turned his head away, wearing one on the gloves"
"<b>oh dear, this doesn't look good.</b> Perera flings his hands out at a short ball and is struck a stinging blow on the hand. He goes down, wincing in pain, immediately. He's clutching his wrist, but when the physio comes out it's the hand that he gets to work on with the magic spray. Replays show that he was struck on the right index finger. He seems to be in severe discomfort, but it doesn't look like he'll have to leave the field"
"pushed down the leg side, de Kock tumbling in the take"
"<b>turn and bounce out of the rough!</b> With no-one in the deep, Lasith sets himself for a mighty sweep, but can't lay bat on it"

Perera is solidly back and across to defend
"reverse sweep this time, Perera getting a good connection and then putting in a sprint to collect two"
"Perera looks to cut, but chops his shot hard into the turf"
"nicely done by Perera, clearing his front leg and making sure to place the ball into a gap at cover to keep the strike"
"almost predictably, his first ball is a bouncer, but it goes harmlessly down the leg side"
"short again, and it's turned to fine leg with a controlled pull"
"flicked fine, but straight to Bavuma at short fine leg"
"straighter this time, but Lasith gets himself right in line to defend"
"<b>short, fended and gone!</b> He must have known what was coming, but he could do nothing about it. Olivier flings down a bouncer, Lasith takes his eyes off it and fends, and the ball pops up off the glove to be easily held by Markram at short leg"
"short of length, angled towards the batsman who stays in the crease and defends it on the off side"
"short of length outside off, goes for the cut but it doesn't bounce as much, a bottom edge goes down, through the keeper's legs"
"fuller around off, sweeps it towards deep backward square leg"
"beauty! How did that didn't fetch a wicket. Length ball on the leg side, opening up the batsman and then beating the outside edge with turn, wasn't far away from the off stump either"

"short again, outside off, dabbed towards gully"
"back of length on middle and leg, pushes it towards square leg and sets off, there was no run there and given that it was the fifth ball of the over, they shouldn't have attempted it. A direct hit and that would have been curtains for Kusal Perera"

"fuller and down the leg side, sweeps it fine to get a boundary"
"length around off, swept again, this time not as fine. Only a single"
"length outside off, spinning away from the batsman as he comes on the front foot to defend, beaten"
"<strong>given lbw</strong>. Flatter and quicker, length ball on the off and middle stump, thuds on to the pad before Rajitha could bring his bat down. <strong>Rajitha goes for a review</strong>. The only doubt is if it was heading down. No bat involved, pitched around off, hits him in front of the leg stump and would have gone on to crash into it. The on-field decision stays as it is. Sri Lanka lose their review as well"
"fuller on middle stump, a bit of spin away, defended from the crease"
"fuller this time, on middle and leg, Fernando brings his bat down to keep it away"
"slower one outside off, drives it towards sweeper cover, doesn't take the single"
