"short and wide to start, knew where his first ball would be and Warner laces a cut to a well-placed deep cover."
"tossed up, lots of air but yadav won't extract much turn with the new ball. Dhawan drives to mid-on and calls for one immediately. Good run by Dhawan"
"another good run. Slightly shorter but straight, tapped away towards square leg and a good response from Dhawan"
"slider. Well bowled. Skids on with the arm. Drifts in and strikes Dhawan in front of leg, would have drifted down"
"some flight outside off, Dhawan premeditated the sweep, got low and hit it decently, to backward square leg"
"another good run, skids on to middle, Dhawan inside-edges to short fine leg. Warner calls his partner through"
good start to his night. Goes wider of the crease and bangs a good short ball in to Dhawan's chest. Dhawan stands tall and fends off to square leg.
"good length this time on off, not much movement. Dhawan pokes from the crease and a thick outside edge goes down to third man"
nice delivery. Warner gets his pads out of the line - a leg stump insiwnger to Warner. A thick inside edge onto his pads
"not much movement this time, and starts the delivery too straight. Clipped off to square leg for a brace"
"142 kph, good length on off, steered to backward point from the crease"
"loose stroke. Full and wide outside off. Since, Warner is standing on leg stump, he has to reach for this. He drives away from his body and the half-prod goes on the bounce to point"
"flat on leg to start, skids on to beat Dhawan's flick. Pings off the pad to point"
"much slower and fuller, easily whipped to deep square leg"
"darted in on leg, tucked from the back foot to square leg. Another run, a very tight start from Daredevils"
"ooh, lucky. Short and wide, should have gone for four. Dhawan cuts but sends it to short third man"
"91 kph, a bit slower and wider outside off. Dhawan runs down and punches to cover"
"great over. Floated up on off, the ball turns away a touch from Dhawan's prod, off the outside half of the bat to point"
"poor start from Shami. Back of a length on leg, Warner pulls down, to fine leg. Rolled his wrists on it. 3000 IPL runs for DW"
"shot! Lovely execution from Dhawan. Full on middle, not much swing. Dhawan flicks it beautifully past a wide mid-on. Superlative timing"
"140 kph, adjusts his line. Goes full and wide outside off - fifth stump line. Steered towards point"
"what a shot! Even better than Dhawan's. Shortish, but not too wide. Warner stands his ground and scythes a checked cut past point. Played that discernibly late to get it past point"
"oh man, how has he found the gap there? Good length again, fourth-stump line. Warner punches the cut this time and somehow finds the gap at point."
"much fuller, much straighter. Warner was waiting on that back foot, but pushes to mid-off for one from there"
"his form is on display. Wow, short on middle. But Yadav would not have expected the ball to go there. Warner backed away and smashed the flat-batted stroke over the bowler's head."
"loose from JY. Flat down leg, Warner backs away and pulls this in the gap at backward square leg. A result of the pressure of Warner's footwork"
"all the way this time? Not a bad delivery at all, tossed up outside off. Maybe too full. Warner bends on one knee and sweeps the ball over Dhawan for six. Sensational batting, even better timing"
"great batting. After three boundaries, he gets the best possible delivery and he plays it away. Good length on middle, cramps Warner for room"
"flat down leg, Warner backed away and then scurried back to off stump. Drifts down leg"
"overpitched on of, pushed to cover"
"90 kph, slow on off, Dhawan pats the ball to point with one aim - to get one and he does, easily."
"close, Warner makes it with a full-length dive. A 140 kph good length delivery on off is steered to backward point. Warner thinks he is short but puts in a  dive. The ball misses anyway"
"back of a length on middle, pulled to fine leg"
poor line. Slower delivery bit down leg. Dhawan misses his flick but the ball clips the pad and races away for four leg byes
"back of a length, better line. On off, Dhawan keeps his glide down, to third man"
"132 kph, good length down leg, off the thigh pad to square leg."
"good delivery. Full and wide after a few deliveries banged in mid-pitch. Dhawan flirts away from his body, with leaden feet. Beaten"
"short again, hammered away to deep square leg with a pull"
"140 kph, hits a good length on off. Dhawan struggles to time his pull. Midwicket is found"
"good bowling this. Full and wide outside off, hustles Dhawan for pace who can't get bat on his drive."
"fullish on middle, at 143 kph. Dhawan chips a drive to long-on. Not found his timing yet"
"sloppy, very loose from pant at point. Full outside off, guided to point. Pant allows it to slip through his hands for one"
"good over from Morris. Back of a length on middle, well-directed bouncer. Dhawan is beaten for pace as he tries to pull"
"flight, lots of flight on middle. Driven to long-off with the spin"
"short and wide outside off, chopped into the surface, to point"
"tossed up, but overpitched. Warner backs away and drills the lofted drive over the bowler. Races away to the long-off fence."
"81 ks, slow again on off, driven powerfully to cover. Pant saves runs this time"
"well bowled, slower and flatter on leg, Warner's leading edge bobbles back. He isn't happy he missed runs"
"too full outside off, easily driven to deep cover for a run"
"nicely bowled, slowed up on middle, extracts a bit of extra bounce and takes it over Warner's flaying bat"
"<s>switch hit</s>. late cut. Flat down leg, Warner shapes for a switch hit but knows he can't execute to executes a lab dab to short fine leg"
swept to deep square leg
"some more loose fielding. Very poor stuff, short and wide outside off. Slapped down to long-off, where Morris runs around and lets it through his legs. Uh oh"
"bowled im. Massive wicket. Warner has to go. Slowish on leg, Warner backs away, in an attempt to dab to point but the ball spins just enough to beat the bat of Warner. May have played inside the line, too. Clatters into leg and middle stump. Impressive spell from jayant, hasn't erred too often"
"tossed up, very wide outside off. Swept to deep square leg"
"flat delivery, down leg. KW misses a flick. Wide"
"81 kph, shortish and wide, scythed to deep point"
"swept away for four. JP errs in line, goes wide down leg and Dhawan hits the sweep nicely, past short fine leg"
"good running, just worked to deep midwicket, Dhawan races back for the second"
"poor line this from Duminy. Flat down leg yet again, Dhawan stands his ground and executes another hard sweep. Races to the backward square leg boundary"
"tossed up outside off, pushed to cover"
"84 kph, nicely bowled. Quite slow on off and defended"
"well bowled again, nice and slow outside off. Williamson reaches out for it to drive to cover"
"may have been the googly, outside off. Worked to deep midwicket"
"nice pace, 84 kph. Not too full, straight. Clipped with the spin to square leg"
"superb shot from Williamson. Poor delivery fro  Mishra, short and wide outside off, rank long hop. He picks the length quickly and pulls in front of midwicket for four"
"googly on off, bunted to long-on"
"flat on leg, no turn. Whipped to deep square leg. Not a bad over for Sunrisers"
"awful delivery, very lucky. Very full down leg, and Dhawan smashes the flick to fine leg, on the bounce"
"149 kph, strays down leg though for an extra"
"good length on off, KW taps the ball to third man. Allowed the ball to come to him before deflecting it away with an angled bat"
"direct hit, but not much celebration. Good length on off, pushed to point. Duminy is quick on it and hits the stumps with not much to aim at. But KW is comfortably in"
good yorker. Well executed. Outside off and Dhawan can't get bat on it
"slower offcutter on off, pushed in front of point for an easy run"
"nice comeback. Short outside off, Williamson arches his back in an attempt for a late dab. But misses"
"lovely use of the feet, tossed up outside off. Dhawan steps down and drills a drive to KW who hurries out of the way. Long-off cleans ip"
"flatter trajectory on leg, clipped to deep midwicket"
"the googly this time outside off, swept hard to deep square leg"
"90 kph, fired in outside off. Slapped to cover. Dot"
"another googly, KW shuffled across for a big heave. Swept to backward square leg"
"taken. 114 kph, seam-up quick delivery from Mishra. Dhawan anticipated that delivery and attempted a wild heave. The ball spliced off the upper half and lobbed to deep midwicket. Samson ran in and took a good running catch"
"134 kph back of a length delivery from Shami on middle, Yuvraj hustles to tuck to fine leg. just wide of a leg gully"
"shortish and wide, KW backed away to make even more room. Slashes a cut to deep point"
"130 kph, another short delivery from Shami to Yuvraj. well-directed. Yuvi pulls to deep square leg, rolled his wrists nicely"
"short again, 137 kph. Williamson is late on the pull, and the ball kisses the glove and lobs over Quinton. Four valuable runs"
"poor line. Full on leg, Williamson is hurried for pace and misses a flick. Pings off the pad to square leg"
Yuvraj shuffled across but Shami delivered an inch-perfect yorker on off. Jammed out
another dart from Mishra on leg. Whipped to deep midwicket
"smashed for six. Googly on leg, Yuvraj runs to the pitch and swipes the ball over long-on. Just had enough to clear the boundary for six. Well played"
"the googly again, but much wider outside off. Deviates past the bat"
"another one of those fast seam-up quick deliveries. On leg, pushed to point"
"another googly outside off, slashed to point. Another dot. Good comeback"
"gone. Yuvraj is gone. The crowd is stunned. Second delivery of this kind of delivery. Seam-up quick delivery but down leg. Yuvraj is early into his flick and the ball takes the leading edge, lobs straight up. Pant did not quite judge the catch well, but took it, diving low in front at short fine leg"
"what a stop from Morris. Short and wide, laced away towards point. Morris puts in an excellent dive to stop the ball. but unnecessarily throws at the bowler's end. Concedes the overthrow"
"superb bowling from Shami. Late swing. Fuller than a good length on middle, the ball swerves back in quite late and slides on off the pitch too.l Henriques' feet are nowhere and ends up being caught on the crease as the ball pings him in front of middle. Plumb, easy decision"
"full again but wider outside off, whipped to deep midwicket. Just the one"
"138 kph, good length on leg. Worked to deep square leg. Just the one again"
"short delivery this time outside off, steered off the open face to third man. On the bounce"
"low full toss down leg. Williamson will not be happy with that, he missed a routine flick. Gets a leg bye though. An optimistic appeal, that was drifting well down leg"
"on the bounce to the sweeper cover. Full and wide outside off, scythed away by a backing away KW"
"lovely. This ball tailing back late. Interesting. An inswinging yorker on middle and leg is nicely worked, but straight to midwicket"
"ooh, both batsmen involved in a nasty collision. Short and wide, slapped to point. Both batsmen ran away from each other and ended up colliding into one another. A fumble from point made sure there was no damage."
"rather full outside off, pushed to mid-off. A sprinted run"
"not timed adequately. Full again on leg, chipped to long-on, on the bounce. Still no boundary, excellent end over bowling this"
"that will be four. 136 kph full delivery on off, Williamson backs away, and swivels into a delectable uppish flick over midwicket. Superb"
"good length on off, hooda backs away and swats a forehand past the bowler who had to hurry out of the way. Mid-off fields"
"lovely change in pace. The slower bouncer on middle, KW backed away, looking to hit over point but had to wait for a while before meeting the ball. One to third man"
"144 kph, full delivery on leg, Hooda backs away and laces a drive through covers. He has also overstepped and allowed a free hit. Poor from NCN"
"decent delivery, good length down leg. Helped away to fine leg. Just one"
"138 kph, overpitched on off, hustles KW for pace. Nudged to deep square leg. Doesn't seem the easiest surface for stroke-making"
"oh no. Hooda is hit wicket. The second time in two games this is happening to a Sunrisers batsman. Slower delivery at 118 kph on leg, Hooda just taps the ball to short fine leg and sets off for one. And his back foot slides onto the stumps. Hooda's treacherous run continues."
"back of a length on middle, glided to third man. Good comeback by NCN. Sunrisers losing their way"
"144 kph, low full toss down leg. Ojha shuffles across and fails to connect with a nudge"
"low full toss outside off, punched to the sweeper cover. Good bowling"
"bowled im. Sensational bowling continues. There is some late movement again responsible for the wicket. Low full toss, but the ball moves back in substantially in the air to sneak past KW's inside edge. Lots of light as the bails go flying"
"another good delivery. Yorker on off, pushed to point. Another dot."
"the late dipping full toss. Well bowled again from Morris. Bhuvi surprised by the variation but gets bat on his glide to point, for one"
"what an over. Morris' night getting better. Wow. An inswinging yorker on leg, dug out by the batsman. Morris runs to the ball, and kicks the ball onto the stumps with his right boot. Bhuvi out by a foot. What a comeback by Daredevils"
"short and wide, a loose offering and crashed behind point. Races away for a much-needed boundary"
"goes back to a full length. Half-volley on middle, wristily driven to cover. Ojha refuses the run, rightly so. Gives himself the best chance"
"low full toss on leg, bunted to deep midwicket for a couple to deep midwicket"
"slow bouncer outside off, Ojha cannot find any bat on an attempted cut."
"gone. NCN is shaking his head, but that's because he has got a wicket to a naughty full toss. On middle. Ojha swats his flick but cannot get enough power behind it. Straight to deep square leg. The umpires check for an above-the-waist no ball, but it is under. So Ojha has to go."
"that is over waist. And a no ball is called. The crowd goes wild. High full toss on middle, spliced back to the bowler who takes the catch. But a free hit"
"slower ball outside off, Nehra swipes to deep midwicket. Just one."
"beauty to start. Good length, shaping away from Qdk who pokes with his feet rooted to the crease. Beaten, convincingly."
"beautiful, lovely movement away from de Kock who defends with more intent this time, to point"
"good length on middle, 132 kph. Worked to square leg for a run"
"lovely lines from Bhuvi, just like usual. Pushes one away from Agarwal who lunges forward with a confident stride to steer to backward point"
this one comes back in sharply! Good bowling. A defensive glide to backward point
"shot! Lovely stroke. Fullish length on off, comes back in again. Agarwal strides forward and lofts the ball straight, with the full face of the bat. To the long-on boundary. Lovely timing"
"Nehra begins with a full delivery on off and middle, some late away shape. Driven to mid-on"
"poor ball. Short and wide, can't offer width to these two. De Kock hammers the cut, did not look to hit it too hard. All timing through point"
even better. Wow. Overpitched this time and de Kock's on-drive is awesome. Amazing timing and four more.
"140 kph, better adjustment. Fullish on middle and leg, turned towards midwicket"
"change in length. Goes shorter this time, back of a length on middle and pulled but finds midwicket"
"good comeback from Nehra. Pulled his length back after those boundaries. Good length on middle, punched to cover"
"good length on middle and leg, 140 kph. Comes back in, the inswinger. Agarwal defends from the crease"
"lovely shot and a good stop too. Good length outside off, Agarwal punches the checked cut to backward point where KW stops the ball acrobatically"
"slower delivery at 119 kph, pushed to mid-off for one. Even Warner can't prevent the run"
"Bhuvi is nice and tight around off and middle, pushed to mid-on for another run"
"short ball and four. 132 kph, sits up for Agarwal who pulls but gets a lucky top edge which flies over the keeper."
"135 kph, back of a length on off, comes back in. Dabbed to backward point for a run"
"not a good stroke at all. And Sunrisers have their first. Fuller than a good length outside off, Agarwal drove at it with hard hands. The ball may have just stopped in the surface. Nonetheless, it carries straight to extra cover. Yuvraj takes an easy catch in front of his stomach."
"nice start. Good length outside off, Nair allows the ball to deflect to third man with an angled bat"
"whew, that is massive. 130 kph on middle, de Kock helps it over square leg with a sweep-flick. Goes way back, crunchy sound of the bat"
"four more. Short and wide outside off, de Kock makes room for himself and slices the ball between third man and point."
"141 kph, adjusts the length. Good length on off, steered to short third man"
"slower ball on off, pushed to mid-on and de Kock sets off for a quick run. Well done"
"shortish delivery outside off, steered to third man with the open face. A bit of with first up from Sran"
"what a shot. Too full, too wide and Nair leans into his drive and finds the gap through cover. Lovely timing, but a poor ball"
"135 kph, good length outside off from Sran. Chopped into the ground, to backward point"
"fullish and wide again, slapped to extra cover. No run"
"another awful delivery. Short and wide, very wide. Nair reaches out for it and slices the ball intentionally over cover, races away for four"
"back of a length outside off, fifth-stump line. Guided to backward point again"
"that is a good run. Back of a length on off, tapped towards the keeper for a run"
shuffles across and bunts the ball to short midwicket for one. Not a very clever shot to Mustafzur's ripping offbreaks
"wide, down leg. Starts the offbreak too straight and an extra"
"short and wide, and smashed. Too much width from Mustafiz. De Kock leans on his cut, and then transfers his weight back. Superb cut stroke through point"
"goes back to a full length outside off, defended"
"nice and tight around off. Chopped to gully, another clever single"
"130 kph, offcutter outside off. Defended to point with soft hands for one."
"Henriques starts with a full length on middle, pushed down to long-on"
"lovely stop from Williamson. Shortish and wideish, de Kock flays another cut and that looks set for four more before KW dives to his left to save some runs. He throws at the bowler's end and concedes an overthrow"
"full on of, Nair closes his bat face to find miwdwicket"
"well bowled, a good length down leg. Nair backs away but the inswinger cuts Nair in half"
"ooh, a lucky boundary. Good length on off, Nair pokes with his feet stuck. A thick inside edge flies away to the fine leg boundary"
"121 kph, full on off, squeezed to deep square leg for one"
"good tight line, honing in around off. Pushed to cover for a quick run. well played"
"136 kph, full on off. Smashed back to the bowler who gets his body behind the ball"
"slower ball, de Kock picks it and smashes it over mid-off for four. Makes it look so easy. The length delivery is short and he purposefully lifts the ball over mid-off with a cross-batted stroke"
"nice change in length. The bouncer on middle, de Kock gets under it. Way over his head but not called"
"poor poor delivery. Strays down leg, all de Kock needs to do is get some bat on it but he chooses to go after the offering. Helps it along over backward square leg with a superb shot."
"back of a length outside off, dabbed to third man with the open face"
"86 kph, short on off to start. Pummeled to long-on with a pull"
shortish again but wide outside off. Enough time for Nair to rock back and clip to deep midwicket
"shortish and wide, clattered to cover. henriques saves one."
"short again, keeps a tad low too. Chopped to deep cover for a run"
"flat down leg, worked to deep square leg for an easy run"
"short yet again, wide yet again. Scythed to deep point"
"good length outside off, de Kock goes for a bit hit over cover but can't time it. Mis-times a stroke to mid-off"
"bowled im. Nair is gone. Henriques strikes. A lovely yorker, just sneaks one in there. May have been pace off the ball too. 117 kph. Nair backed away and looked to guide a ball through the off side, but missed it because of the full-ness of the length. Leg stump is uprooted"
"shot! 126 kph, good length delivery outside off. Samson stands tall and punches a drive off the back foot, past cover"
"another yorker on off, dug out to long-on"
"short and wide outside off, de Kock looks for an upper cut but misses it, I think. Henriques appeals, and appeals and appeals. De Kock has missed that. De kock loses his helmet too, and there may have been a sound because the helmet came off. Umpire Erasmus, first, did not give that. Henriques stood there in disbelief. Looked back at de Kock, who shook his head, indicating there was no bat. But the umpire raises his finger, very very very late. De Kock cannot believe the decision. Unlucky batsman"
"130 kph, good length outside off, steered to point where Williamson fields."
"flat to start on middle, pushed to deep midwicket"
"short, flat and wide. Pulled to deep midwicket"
"nice bowled, 80 kph. Floated up on off, blocked!"

"good length on off, the ball comes back in with the angle. Chopped to point"
"130 kph, fuller than a good length on off, squeezed to midwicket"
"short and dispatched. Not even that short for that stroke, but Samson stood in his crease, picked up the length early and walloped the swat over midwicket. Yikes, right off the middle"
"good length outside off, clipped to midwicket. Pant wants one but is sent back"
"slower cutter on off, tickled fine towards fine leg for a couple."
"another slower ball on off, skewed off the inside half to midwicket"

"132 kph, short bouncer on off. The batsman is forced to duck underneath"

"full on middle to start, turned towards the midwicket region with the closed bat face"
"low full toss on off, pushed to long-off"
"six. What a shot from pant. Another offcutter on off, Pant brings out all his exuberance and clobbers the lofted drive over long-on. Warner sees it soaring over"
"138 kph, fullish on middle, clipped away to deep midwicket. Another easy single"
"well played. the offcutter rips past the off stump but Samson angles his bat, to get it to third man"
"has Pant opened the game up in the space of four balls? Low full toss on middle, whipped with discernible use of the wrists, past midwicket and to the boundary. Superb timing"
"good length on middle, worked to wide midwicket. nice use of the wrists. Long-on cleans up"
"dropped! A clanger. Henriques should have gobbled that up. Short on middle, not short enough to pull but he goes after it anyway. Can't keep it down and it goes at a comfortable height for Henriques, but the ball bursts through his reverse cupped hands"
skewed off the inside half to midwicket
"fullish line outside off, scythed to deep point"
"full on off, moving away slightly. Defended to cover"
"leg side-ish line, Pant whips the ball away, lands just in front of Dhawan at square leg"

"another good yorker outside off, punched to the sweeper cover off the back foot"
"full and wide outside off, Samson leans forward and pushes to the sweeper cover for a run"
"Mustafizur misses his yorker this time. Ends up being a low full toss outside off, drilled to mid-off"
"offcutter outside off, scythed to the deep cover fielder. Pant struggled to time that"
"just three of the over. Offcutter outside off, Samson shimmies down to change the length of the bowler. Guides his steer to point"
"smashed for six. Big heave by Pant. Good length on off and middle, pant swings across the line and connects beautifully. Goes way back over midwicket. Big hit"
"wide, 119 kph. Slower offcutter but very wide outside off. Pant leaves, called"
"low full toss on leg, whipped away with strong wrists, to deep midwicket"
"well bowled. A good change in length, goes shorter on leg. Samson ducks underneath. But a wide is called. May have been for the leg stump line"
"good running, short delivery on middle and leg, Samson stands tall and works the ball past square leg. Realising there is a second on offer, Samson scurries back"
"two more. Back of a length on middle, tucked in the gap at midwicket. Nicely placed"
"slower cutter outside off, steered off the outside half to third man"
"back of a length on middle, Pant swivels into a pull stroke but fails to connect adequately. Inside-edged onto his body"
"yorker on leg, squeezed to deep square leg for a run"
"fullish on off, Pant attempts a big heave but mis-times it to long-on. Warner hits the stumps direct at the bowler's end and the ball ricochets for an extra"
smashed. Low full toss and dispatched. Superb shot. got under it and cleared mid-off with a lovely swing of the bat
slower ball on middle. Heaved to midwicket

"another slower ball on off, another pull is hammered to midwicket on the bounce"
