"wide length ball to start, outside off, left alone and it's called wide"
"wide-ish line once more, but within permissible limits, and right up in the blockhole. Looks to squeeze it away through point but can't put bat to ball"
"full-toss on off stump, about stump high, punched to mid-off"
"length ball on leg stump, clipped to the right of midwicket. Was in the air but well away from the fielder. Deep square leg mops up"
"full and wide now, Buttler throws his arms out to be able to meet that and steer to third man, who's stationed quite wide, with this line probably in mind"
"nicely bowled. 90mph, but the ball seems to nip away like a cutter and it loses a lot of pace off the pitch and doesn't carry to the keeper. Fullish, slanting away from off. Bairstow looks to drive through mid-off and the away movement beats his outside edge"
"full again, a little wider, and Bairstow opens his bat face slightly to drive to the left of extra-cover and bring up the first boundary of the day"
"low full-toss fired in towards off stump, driven firmly to short extra-cover"
"down the track as Agar gives this a bit more air, and Buttler gets to the pitch of it, skips sllghtly leg side to free his arms, and launches it high and straight back over the bowler"
"predictable response, drops slightly short with a flatter one outside off. No real turn, and Buttler rocks back, opens up at the hips, and swats it over the wide mid-on region. Both mid-on and midwicket are in the circle"
"shortish on off stump, slapped to the fielder at cover point"
length ball slanting in towards off stump and sliding on with the angle. Stays leg side of the ball and carves to that man at cover point once more. Stoinis the fielder
"tossed up a little fuller, around off stump or so, and there's no margin for error for the spinner on this surface. Definitely not in the Powerplay. Clears his front leg and hoicks that waaaay over the wide long-on boundary. Lovely full extension of the arms"
"bit of a muted appeal for lbw as Bairstow misses a flick. Pitched slightly outside leg, you'd think"
"back of a length, slanting across to off stump. Opens up at the hip and pulls it towards midwicket. Hits it really hard and the fielder fumbles it to allow the single"
"back of a length on off stump, stays leg side of the ball and opens his bat face to dab to third man"
"back of a length on off stump, and that's a beautiful shot. Doesn't get across at all, and he uses that lack of footwork to make himself room for a vertical-bat push that screams away between cover point and extra-cover"
"follows up with a slightly ugly-looking hoick. May have looked good had he connected. Slightly pace off, I think, just short of a length in the corridor outside off, and Buttler aims to hit over mid-on and fails to connect"
"full on off stump, stays leg-side of the ball again and that's a brilliant shot. Uses his hands to manipulate his bat face so he can place it to the left of the diving Maxwell at backward point, and times it well enough to leave third man no chance of running to his right and cutting it off"
"back of a length on off stump, angling in and cramping Bairstow for room. Was probably shaping to punch through the covers, ends up adjusting and tucking it into the square leg region instead"
"this man is in magic form today. Full, angling into off stump, and again there's no real footwork from Buttler. Just stands there, punches through the line, and sends it flying to the left of mid-off"
"back of a length close to off stump, chopped towards point"
"sees Buttler sashaying away from leg stump to make even more room for himself, and fires in a blockhole ball at his feet. Stabs it towards backward point and they go for the quick single. The throw from the backward point fielder misses the stumps at the keeper's end, but made Bairstow stretch"
"back of a length close to off stump, dabbed down to deep backward point"
"gone! Extra bounce, and the interesting field works! Jumped towards the shoulder of Bairstow's bat as he tried to defend this short-of-a-length ball. Great line, offering no room at all, and the edge pops up to that man at the gully-ish short third man position"
"length ball on middle stump, tucked into the backward square leg region"
"shot. Not a long-hop, and it was close to hip height on off stump, and he uses his wrists to whip it to the right of short fine leg"
"back of a length, at the hip once more, tucked to short fine leg"
"back of a length, angling across to off stump, defended towards midwicket"
"back of a length, slanting across the left-hander, defended into the covers"
"fullish on off stump, driven to mid-off"
"back of a length on middle stump. Knew Buttler was trying to make room, and made sure to deny it. Defended towards point"
"this time Buttler steps away, creates room, and gets a slightly short-of-length ball on off stump. Flat-batted crisply to the left of mid-off"
"this time Buttler went the other way, stepping back and across so his hips are open and his back foot is on off stump. Cummins hits the pitch hard and angles the ball into Buttler's hip, and he's forced to tuck it quietly into the leg side. This is very good defensive bowling"
"fullish, slanting away from off stump. Goes for the cover drive, leaning back a bit, and gets a thick edge down to third man"
"back of a length, straightens a little towards off stump. Uses his wrists on top of the bounce to play that back towards the bowler. A defensive straight flick"
"length ball, goes wider of the crease and angles it in towards off stump. Stays back and pushes into the covers"
"quickish and full, angling into leg stump. Clipped down to long-on"
"quickish on middle and off, gets forward to defend towards midwicket"
wrong'un spinning towards the top of off stump. Stays leg-side of the ball and slaps it away to deep point
sees Buttler stepping out and bowls a flat googly spinning into his legs. Clipped down to long-on
"tossed up on leg stump, and Malan is on his way with a good-looking boundary. Steps leg-side and drives inside-out to beat cover to his right and deep point - who's very square - to his left"
"tossed up outside off, driven to extra-cover"
"flat, off-stumpisn, stays back and chops into the covers"
"a bit wider, similar length, slapped to sweeper cover"
Malan looks to step out and Agar fires a flat one across towards off stump. Punched to long-on
"back of a length, sliding on with the angle and cramping Buttler for room. Jabbed into the covers"
"gone. Agar ends Buttler's fluent knock. Shortish, outside off, telling Buttler he's free to take the single to the fielder or fetch the pull from outside off stump. Takes on the pull, and hits it straight down deep midwicket's throat"
"full outside off, driven to long-off"
"Shot. He's just come to the crease, and he's immediately picking his spots. Flat length ball on off stump, and he quickly moves into position for a fast-hands reverse-sweep over backward point"
"quicker still, looks like the legbreak that doesn't turn. Skids on as Banton looks to cut, beats his inside edge and narrowly misses off stump"
"straighter line now, reads that Banton's looking to go off side. Clipped towards the on side"
"down the track now and he floats it wider, driven to extra-cover"
"flat and fairly full on leg stump. Perhaps too full to sweep safely, drags it to short fine leg off the inside half of the bat"
"length ball on off stump, driven to long-off"
"looks to step out and gets a flat, slightly shortened delivery on off stump. Stretches out and dabs into the covers"
"fired across to off stump, quite full, driven to sweeper cover"
"shortish outside off, Banton may have gotten too close to the line with his back-and-across movement. Cuts, can't beat short third man moving quickly to his right and diving"
"length ball on middle and off, swept in the air but on the bounce to deep backward square leg"
"down the track, and Agar gets another! Loses his shape a little while trying to loft inside-out over the covers. Makes a bit too much room with his front leg, and ends up slicing the ball off the outside half of the bat. Finch takes a good catch running to his right at cover, calling well and avoiding a collision with short extra-cover"
"a bit of air on this, clipped past midwicket"
"shot! Full outside off, and Malan extends his arms fully through the drive, opening his bat face to slice that over cover point"
"full, a bit of inward shape towards middle and leg, maybe? Clipped to deep square leg"
"the field was set for the short ball, but he goes full first up, and outside off. It's a half-volley, and Morgan drives crisply to the right of the diving extra-cover fielder"
"short now, outside off, and Morgan <b>doesn't control his pull</b>! It hurries onto him, getting up towards his left shoulder, and he has no room for his arms. Ends up hitting it up in the air off the top edge, but falls safely between the backtracking midwicket fielder and the man at deep backward square leg"
"fullish outside off, driven to extra-cover"
"back of a length, angling into off stump, worked away to deep midwicket"
"tossed up on leg stump, doesn't want to give him room. Steps down and away from the line to drive inside-out to the left of sweeper cover"
flat length ball straightening slightly towards middle stump. Defended into the covers
"similar delivery, steps out and works it through square leg"
"back of a length, sliding on with the angle past leg stump. Malan makes a lot of room and slaps to deep point"
"down the track, and that's a terrific catch from Smith! Floats it in towards middle and leg, and another batsman has lost his shape in the effort to hit inside-out. First it was Banton, now it's Morgan. May have stopped on the pitch a little, or maybe he just didn't get to the pitch of it. Ends up slicing high, back over the bowler's head more or less, and long-on takes it very well with a full-tilt sprint to his right"
"quickish, a bit of in-drift before it straightens towards a middle-stump line. Driven towards long-off"
shot. Flat length ball slanting across and straightening towards off stump. Gets down quickly and hoicks a sweep to the square leg boundary
"full on middle and leg, clipped to long-on"
"wrong'un, and is that a <b>drop</b>? Nope. Quickish but still loopy, not quite driving length. Looks to push into the covers and it rips past his outside edge. No edge there, keeper doesn't catch cleanly"
"length ball, stays leg side of the ball and punches to the sweeper"
"tossed up slower, another wrong'un. Gets forward and opens his bat face to steer into the point region"
"drops short now, and Malan's footwork is quick and precise, pulls from an off-stump line and beats deep midwicket sliding to his right"
"flat, angling into off stump and spinning away sharply, Moeen seems surprised by it as he jabs into the point region"
"down the track, doesn't quite reach the pitch to drive inside-out. Slides on and he plays it back to the bowler off the inside half of the bat"
"shorter, stops on Moeen slightly and he pulls to deep midwicket"
"flat length ball angling into the stumps, tucked away through midwicket"
"another for Maxwell! Again that little bit of in-drift, plus a misjudgment of length. Goes for the reverse-sweep off one that's probably a little short for it. And the drift ensures it pitches closer to leg-stump than Moeen expected. Ends up top-edging and offering a dolly to short third man"
"back of a length, straightening away from off stump, whipped to long-on"
"flat, wide length ball slanting away from the left-hander. Reaches out for the flat-bat drive, slices to short third man"
"flat, back of a length, sliding on with the angle towards off stump. Makes a bit of room and chops it away between short third man and backward point"
flat length ball slanting away from off stump. Steps across and works it square on the leg side. Hurried onto him a little
"full on middle stump, clipped to the right of straight midwicket"
"full, angling away from off stump, driven to long-off"
"full on off stump, makes a bit of room and hammers a flat-bat drive to deep point"
"flat length ball on middle and leg, driven to long-on"
"flat. fired into the pads, clipped to the right of short fine leg"
"down the track, not quite to the pitch of this leg-stump ball, clips to midwicket"
"length ball straightening towards middle stump, and he makes room and steps deep into his crease for a chop down to long-off. There's an appeal for hit-wicket, and they're checking to see if it was the batsman or the keeper who disturbed the wicket. Clearly the keeper's gloves - Curran wasn't even as deep in his crease as I thought"
"back of a length on off stump, makes room and slaps towards deep point"
"back of a length, straightens towards middle and leg. Opens up at the hip and swats it down to long-on"
"short, angling into off stump and denying Curran the room he's trying to create. Looks to slash it away and ends up inside-edging it <b>past his off stump</b>"
"shortish again, a bit of width this time but it stops on the pitch. Flat-batted hard and Warner makes a good stop diving to his left at mid-off"
"shortish on leg stump, pulled to deep square leg"
"slower ball, just back of a length, on middle and off. Curran sees third man in the circle and goes for the reverse-scoop, but can't connect at a ball that's dying even as it reaches him"
"short, wide, another slower ball, I think, and Curran waits and slaps it hard but can't control it because it gets up higher than he estimates, and he ends up hitting it straight to deep cover point"
"short, slanting across to off stump, pulled to deep square leg to bring up his fifty. He's looked really good after a slowish start"
"shortish on off stump, makes room and slaps to deep point"
"wrong'un, turning in towards leg stump. Stays back and tucks it into the square leg region"
"wrong'un on a length, spinning away from off stump, flat-batted to the left of sweeper cover"
"Malan's been trying to make room to hit through the off side all through this over, and now he goes the other way, stepping across and exposing leg stump. Zampa looks to hit leg stump with a quick legbreak, but he gets his line wrong and beats everyone down the leg side as Malan misses the sweep"
"bang. Not the worst ball, quickish length ball on leg stump, and Malan opens up at the hips as he stretches forward for the slog-sweep, and he hits it hard and square and all the way over the square leg boundary"
"shot! Malan makes a bit of room again, and ends up having all the room in the world to free his arms as Zampa delivers a googly spinning away from off stump. Hits cleanly over the wide long-off boundary"
"fuller now to deny the elevation, on off stump. Driven on the bounce to long-off"
"gone. Slower ball slanting away from off stump, quite short, and Malan goes in the pursuit of more quick runs. Flat-bats it pretty well, but he's looking to miss long-off running to his right, not to hit it into his hands. Excellent innings from the No. 3"
"back of a length outside off, dabbed to third man"
"back of a length on off stump. Stays leg side of the ball and dabs it gently into the off side, square"
"back of a length, not far outside off, gets his bottom hand into this forcing back-foot shot to place it to the right of deep point"
"middle-stump yorker, stays leg-side of it and squeezes it towards backward point"
"slower ball again. Rashid sees fine leg in the circle and looks to step across to swipe or scoop it in that direction. Richardson keeps it wide outside off, outside his body, and slows it down so he has no pace to work wit. Swishes at it and misses"
"wide yorker, sliced down to third man"
"another wide yorker, and Rashid can't put bat to it. Seriously quick delivery, juuust inside the tramline"
"now Rashid looks to step across and target fine leg, and Cummins spots the movement and bowls the shortish slower ball wide of off. Another swish and miss, just like the previous over, but this time they sneak a bye with Jordan starting nice and early"
"short outside off, pulled to the right of deep midwicket, lots of bottom hand, almost a tennis smash"
"low full-toss on leg stump, whipped down the ground to the left of long-on. Another from Jordan's eye-catching bottom-handed array of strokes"
"swatted away, lots of bottom hand once more, and Jordan takes England past 160. Back-of-a-length offcutter nipping in towards leg stump, and Jordan spotted it early and was into his pull quickly, met it well in front of his body and picked out the gap between deep midwicket and deep backward square leg"
"back of a length, nip off the deck as Warner wafts a back-foot drive into the covers and sprints the single"
"tight line, just back of a length, squeezed out to point off the back foot. Archer is zipping up to 92mph already..."
"good wheels outside off, a hint of late away swing from just back of a length. Finch is beaten as he prods at thin air"
<strong>swished high and emphatically away over square leg!</strong> Picking up the short ball well and dumping it one bounce over the rope
"fine leg comes up, and<strong> away goes the flick off the toes</strong>. Archer drifts leg-sided, and Finch is acutely aware of the gaping hole in the field. Excellent batting"
"slower ball, and that's a fine follow-up, rolling the fingers on the cutter, and that leaps into the splice to plug out in the covers. A bit of a mixed bag, but lively from Archer"
"sharp from the outset, Warner <B>under-cuts down into his crease</B>. He nearly chops on, but that's got oodles of bat on it and fine leg has no chance to cut that off"
"<B>pulled, but not convincingly!</B> Wood skids though a rapid back-of-a-length ball, Warner was anchored on the back foot in anticipation but only just scuffed it over mid-on"
"shovelled off the back foot again, into the on-side. Wood is looking properly lively already"
"banged in short, and gloved very fine past fine leg. Warner cashes in on the leg-stump line, and leaves Archer with too much to do"
"fuller length, outside off, thwacked to the leg side, <strong>that was 95mph! </strong> Wood is in the mood, but the ball is travelling at the moment..."
"on the back foot, 'aw c'mon!' grumbles Finch as he mistimes his slap out to point. Well, this is rowdy already"
"yorker, at 94mph. Can't ask for more than that. Well dug out, but a useful dot"
"crashed off a good length, Warner is waiting for the pull, so that was right in his arc, clawed through square leg for another boundary"
"leg-stump line, waiting on the back foot for a clip to midwicket, and that's good running"
"opens the face, dabs to short third man"
"shovelled very fine, just back of a length, but Finch is cute with his angles, and flicks a leg-stump line past Wood on the rope."
"pushed onto the back foot by the fuller length, half an appeal for lbw  but clearly going over"
"outside off, Warner is fishing for the wide, but can't get it. Just inside the guidelines on the pitch as it angles away"
"Warner set himself for the width this time, and <strong>humpties an upper-cut high through backward point!</strong> He's so deep in his crease tonight, buying himself an extra split-second for every shot"
"thumps the pad, fuller length and Warner gets in a tangle. Not out"
"slower ball, wide yorker length, decent delivery, dipping late on the crease line, and tapped out to cover with a horizontal bat"
"back of a length, outside off, Finch sets himself for a cut but that's too tight to the body and he under-edges into the pitch"
"slower ball, sliding down the leg side as Finch swings into a frantic pull. No contact but it matters not"
"back of a length, too wide,<strong> Finch cuts it to ribbons!</strong> This is not the area to be bowling to Aaron Finch ..."
"<strong>yee-har! </strong>Warner sizes up the baseball mow, belatedly picks the slower ball, then sizes up another one. Misses..."
"tucked to the on-side, fuller length"
<strong>nip from a good length! </strong>Finch is momentarily discomforted as the ball leaps into his knuckles
"slower ball, on a good length, Finch advances, but can't time his drive"
"worked to the on side, just behind square."
"back of a length, shaping into the right-hander, who squeezes a back-foot cut out to point. That's a good over, mixing it up well to put a check on Australia's scoring"
<strong>donked through mid-on!</strong> That made the sort of sound that that bloke from Crocodile Dundee made on the baddie by the creek. You know the one. Stand and deliver!
flinched off the legs for another single
"slower ball, swished out to the leg side"
"poked into the covers, off the back foot, keeping the runs ticking"
"very full, right in the slot for a launch, but there was some subtlety in the flight there from Jordan, and Finch couldn't quite time his lofted drive"
"slower ball again, tailing into a compact block. Very measured end to the Powerplay. But Australia will be amply satisfied with that platform"
wrong'un first up. Grips well as Warner pushes tentatively outside off
"another googly, but tighter line and Warner sweeps effectively to deep square"
"thumped to the on-side, another single as Rashid continues to apply a handbrake in this over"
"well bowled, a teasing legbreak, on a good length, just outside off as Finch rocks to cut and misses"
"tossed into the toes, excellent pushing between the wickets as Finch picks his drive to wide long-on"
<B>ripper!</B> Finch is comprehensively beaten by the legbreak and Buttler whips off the bails! Did his back foot wobble? Not enough to get the stumping...
"outside off, flogged hard on the cut, out to deep point. Good timing, but can't beat the sweeper"
"excellent ball, shaping away on a wide line, and kicking off the turf to elude Warner's ambitions"
"whittled off the pads, out to deep square leg. More dogged running to keep Australia cooking"
"far too wide this time, it was a cunning slower ball, but off-line from the outset"
"on the back foot, another slower-ball bouncer, dabbed down into the gap at backward point. Australia are in complete control here"
"flicked off the toes, out to midwicket, another slower ball, not entirely picked but finds enough of a gap"
stabbed off the back foot out to deep point
"reverse-sweep, <B>steepling top-edge!</B> It plops inches inside the rope, but deep square leg would have swallowed that"
"another googly, slower through the air, tucked to the on side"
"<B>panned into the stands at long-on!</B> Just enough width for Finch to plant the front foot, pick the wrong'un and smoke it over the rope!"
"<B>wider line, and battered along the carpet!</B> Finch has called Rashid's bluff there, picking the probability of a wider line and crunching him to the boundary"
"<B>inside-out drive!</B> Finch is cooking now! Onto the front foot, crashing his blade through the line. England are in trouble now..."
"a quicker googly, fizzed through flatter and pressed to point. This is in danger of getting one-sided now..."
"fired down the leg side, that won't help"
"<B>'aw no!' says Warner, and he's not wrong!</B> Swishing into a pull and clattered right into the knackers! Count em, don't rub em..."
flashed out to the leg side to get off the strike
<strong>a whistling bouncer at 92mph! </strong> Can't argue with that. Finch weaves inside the line and lets it go
"on the back foot, poked out to cover"
"wider on the crease, but fizzed past the legs. We'll have that one again ..."
"on the back foot, pressed to cover with a glide of the bat"
"that is proper fast bowling, angled across the left-hander at sharp pace and eluding a tentative chop to third man. England need wickets, but in their absence, tight overs will have to do"
"swished out to the leg side, clawing at a back-of-a-length ball"
"way down the leg side, that won't help England's cause"
"panned off the back foot, out to deep midwicket. Who needs subtlety when your eye is in?"
"on the back foot, poked to deep point with a gliding cut"
"<strong>ducking into a pull, and so nearly the breakthrough!</strong> Short and straight, 93mph, and Finch was hurried as he clawed his shot behind square. Wood did well as he ran in for the catch, keeping himself big to prevent the boundary as the ball fell short"
"on the legs, hustled for pace again but worked into the gap"
"<B>holes out to mid-off!</B> Finally, the breakthrough for Archer! The short balls keep Finch's feet pegged to the crease as his weight is lured into the fuller ball. No timing on the lofted drive and Jordan times his leap well to end a fine innings"
"flipped off the pads, behind square for another single"
"<B>battered into the stands!</B> Exceptional batting first-up! Dancing feet from Smith, as he saunters into the line of a 94mph length ball, and pongoes his pull behind square!"
"pounded in front of square this time, and <B>Banton fumbles on the rope!</B> England are scenting an early night here ..."
"pushed onto the back foot, Wood follows Smith's shimmying to force a block to the off-side"
"back of a length, pulled to the on side"
"short and straight, Warner stands at the crease, deflects a half-cock pull round the corner - with three men on the hook there was oodles of risk in taking it on -  and up comes an excellent fifty"
"outside off, tapped behind point"
legbreak with a slip lurking too. Smith leans forward with uncertain feet to defend
"Smith gallops into a lofted drive, but inside-edges the googly into his thigh. Tidy work from the spinner"
"slower ball, back of a length, Smith waits on the back foot and taps the single to leg"
flipped off the toes out to deep midwicket
"tossed up, another googly, draws an airy push, just short of point. It's a good over, but it's not a great over. England need wickets..."
"hustled by a tight middle-and-leg line, Smith is eyeing up the big wipe but a nudge to leg with suffice"
"round the wicket, Warner picks the line early and reverses to a tumbling Jordan behind square"
"huge levers, <B>smoked over wide long-on!</B> Banton and Jordan have been dispatched to the stands, much like the ball itself. And they can't find the ball for love nor money! It's like watching the Camel on Hackney Marshes!"
"looped onto a fuller length, eased to long-on"
"looking to give himself room, but can't make the stroke"
a brace of dots to finish a rowdy over. England need a few more of those...
"big spin, back of a length, rips past Smith's floundering push"
"<B>another big legbreak, and this time Smith holes out!</B> Extra bounce as Smith kneeled into the slog-sweep, and Bairstow takes a fine running catch at deep midwicket. It's a start for England ... but here's Glenn Maxwell to apply a finish for Australia..."
"back of a length, big rip on the legbreak as Warner adjusts to haul a low pull to deep midwicket"
"pushed onto the defensive, worked to the on side"
cracked into the covers to keep the strike rotating
"<B>flogged to short cover, and Rashid strikes with his last ball!</B> That's a bad shot from Maxwell, no need to take on the dangerman at this stage. Making room and nailing a bottom-handed drive to Morgan. Suddenly Rash's figures look rather tidy, and well, England have the hint of the beginnings of a glimmer of optimism ..."
"on the back foot, worked into the gap at midwicket as Malan brings up a divot with his knee as he fields"
"<B>bowled him!</B> Warner gives himself room for an inside-out drive, Archer follows him from round the wicket, and the ball cannons off the pads into the leg stump! Now then ... it's a big ask for England, but there are two brand-new batsmen at the crease..."
"fired down the leg side, they look to steal an extra run and nearly pay the price"
"91mph outswinger, Stoinis has a woolly waft and can't lay anything on it"
"attempted yorker, tight line, good attempt, but solidly blocked to the on-side"
"round the wicket to the left-hander, Carey closes the face on a nudge to the leg side"
"back of a length, shaping into the left-hander, Carey opens the face on the back foot and nudges the single. Archer's night is done. Tidy, but it'll be up to his team-mates to salvage this one"
"round the wicket, cramped on the back foot, tucked to midwicket"
"hitting the deck hard outside off, 91mph, cracked to the off side and gathered in the covers"
"<B>bowled him!</B> That's the benefit of raw pace. Fast, straight, Carey is caught flat-footed, and the zing bails go spiralling into the night sky! And <I>now </I>England reckon it's on!"
"round the wicket again, offering the left-handed Agar no width as he thumps the thigh pad with good lift from a tight line"
"inswinging yorker, that's a fine delivery,<strong> at 95mph too!</strong> But squirted down to third man, effective enough in the circumstances"
"back of a length, hopping into line to nudge the single to square leg. Wood's night is done. Another man with tidier figures than were threatening 20 minutes ago ..."
"pushed onto the back foot, pressing the inswinger into the gap at mid-off, and they take the single"
"round the wicket, cunning delivery, just back of a length and dabbed to cover. There's an easy single there, when it deserved a dot... Morgan wants to take it deep with no boundaries for now..."
"compact defence on the back foot, squeezed to cover for another single"
"round the wicket, another slower ball, hitting the deck hard and cut to point. Excellent tumbling stop from Moeen as Agar times it well"
"flashed off the back foot, the sweeper is in business as Malan slides round at deep point. Just enough width to free the arms but Curran is mixing up the pace well"
"fuller length, tighter line, pushed to cover for another single. That's a fine over but it's been milked, mid-90s-ODI-style."
"banged in short, very straight line, and Stoinis plays a measured pull to the man at backward square. Hitting the deck from Jordan"
"very full, thrashed to point, and he's timed it too well this time. Well gathered, and suddenly England are tightening the screw..."
"tapped into the covers, on the front foot, Jordan stretches to intercept but can't quite gather. Another single... both sides taking it deep ..."
"round the wicket, hitting his areas well as Agar has a flat-footed hack and under-edges into the crease"
"<strong>beaten outside off!</strong> Fifth-stump line, a swing and a miss as Stoinis can't pick the slower ball"
"<B>a massive wind-up and Stoinis can't connect!</B> It's a sprint for the frantic single, as Jordan aborts his lbw appeal to attempt the run-out! He pings down the stumps, and we've got a <strong>double review!</strong> Full and straight, but sliding down leg ... not out in the first instance... now then, the run-out... Wow, that's close ... neck and neck as the bails and bat are in a race... <strong>but the bat is a millimetre short!</strong> Agar should have dived, but he was caught short... and the collapse continues!"
"length ball, <B>hopeless wipe from Stoinis</B>, and he can't connect!"
"<B>flogged into the stands!</B> Just when it looked like Stoinis was losing this single-handedly, he leans back on the length ball, just a touch of width, and monstered over wide long-off! That's changed things again!"
<B>another swing and a miss!</B> Stoinis almost flings himself off his feet as he honks into an air-pull over midwicket. Crumbs!
"low full toss, and <strong>Stoinis had landed it in the crossroads!</strong> That went so high there was time for four fielders to converge in the covers, and none could get close! Most importantly though, it's not a boundary..."
"yorker, that's exceptional areas from Curran, swinging in as Stoinis bunts his pull to backward square. Back for two... <B>a four takes us to a Super Over!</B>"
"low full toss, bunted to deep midwicket, and <B>Tom Curran has snaffled it!</B> A roar of triumph from the bowler. That is extraordinary from England, and Australia. They were dead and buried, but Australia have utterly blown it!"
