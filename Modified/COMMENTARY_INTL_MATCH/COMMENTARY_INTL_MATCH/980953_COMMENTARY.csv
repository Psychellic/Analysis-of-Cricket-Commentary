"goes across the left-hander, bowls a length ball on off stump, defended onto the off side"
"slides down leg, and is punished. This one was a half-tracker, Warner hops back into the crease and helps it into the fine leg boundary."
"the ball is pinging the middle of the bat beautifully! Angles a length ball across Warner, deflected to backward point, a half-stop by AB de Villiers gives them a run"
"straightens from the back of length area on middle and leg, Dhawan defends solidly"
"punched, but straight to de Villiers at cover point"
"gets some lift off the surface, short alright, but Dhawan bunts that towards gully"
"full and shapes back in middle, Dhawan goes for a full-blooded drive but can only get a thick inside edge wide of midwicket"
"inswinger again, lands this on middle, Warner stays inside the crease and punches it to cover"
"rolls his fingers over the ball, that one was at 118kph, Warner wrists it towards deep backward square leg"
skids off the pitch and hurries onto the bat as Warner goes back into the crease and taps it behind point for a quick single
"just an extension of his arms as he meets a length ball with a straight ball, races away past mid-off. Sweet timing, that should get Dhawan going"
"scoring opportunity missed. It was a half-volley on the pads, but Dhawan played all around that and is hit on the pad."
"floated full on off stump, driven straight to cover"
"sliding down middle and leg, deflected towards short fine leg"
"slider that pitches on off and comes back in, Dhawan is half-forward as he plays it with soft hands"
"steps out and lofts him over mid-on, one bounce into the boundary. It wasn't a half-volley, but there wasn't much spin which allowed Dhawan to hit through the line"
"fetches the sweep from outside off, straight to short fine leg"
"fired down leg side, punched past midwicket. Tidy first over"
short and pulled away. How quickly he manages to transfer weigh onto the backfoot to biff the ball! Strong wrists into play as well as he sends the ball flying into the gap at square leg
"lucky to get away, it was a mis-hit, but  he managed to hit it over mid-on. Short and angling away, Dhawan slapped the pull over Shamsi, who does well to give it chase and slide the ball back in"
"stays inside the crease, gets onto his toes and offers a dead bat to a short of length delivery"
"as easy as they come. The lift off the deck has done the trick. Richardson bowled this at length on middle, Dhawan looked to work it across the line, but only managed to chip it back to the bowler who accepted it gleefully"
"defends the length ball behind the wicket, towards a wide second slip"
"beaten on the drive, nerves? This was a length ball that nipped away from outside off, Williamson looks to drive on the up, feet was nowhere near the pitch of the ball. It wasn't far away from the outside edge"
"back of length delivery on the pads, Warner looks to whip it away, but the ball deflects off a thud onto his thigh pad"
"whipped away behind square, the square leg fielder and Richardson at deep fine leg were running around in circles, enough time for them to get back for the third. Warner initiated it, Williamson responded. Superb"
"hits the deck hard and lands it at length on middle and off, Warner drops it towards short cover and charges down the pitch to complete the single easily"
"too full, Williamson cuts, but can only chop it towards a wide second slip"
"full ball on off stump, Williamson dabs it to point with an opened bat face"
"floats it full on middle from wide of the crease, played back to the bowler"
"oversteps, and then bowls a length ball outside off, Warner looks to slap it over cover, but gets a thick edge towards third man. Shamsi was running around, but got a bad bounce at third man. In the end, his leap wasn't enough to stop the ball. Poor cricket all around from RCB. <B> Free-hit coming up <b>"
"can't change the field, but what does Harshal do? Bowls it full and into Warner's hitting arc, he clears his front leg and hammers it over long-on. Clean strike"
"change of pace, the slow off-cutter on middle this time., defended off the backfoot"
"he will feast on those all day, all night. This one is too short and outside off, Warner opens his wrists, hops into the crease and uses the width to help it over backward point. This is the release SRH were looking for"
"makes room and dabs it to short third man, Williamson turns downs the single"
"horror over continues to get worse. Floats it short and well down leg, Warner looks to help it on its way, but decides against it in the end"
"slow length ball on middle, defended towards mid-off"
"slower bouncer on middle, Warner looks to sway out of the way and ramp it over the wicketkeeper's head, but misses. Rahul collects it on the bounce"
leans forward and drives it wide of cover
"cuts and misses. This one fizzes and skids off after pitching outside off, it was short alright, but Warner failed to account for the sidespin"
deep cover was in business and Harshal Patel does well to slide across and stop that powerful drive
"superb back cut from Warner. It was short, he made room and played it really, really late behind point."
angles it with the spin to Watson at short third man
"this one's a slider on middle and leg, Warner works it wide of midwicket"
"whipped into the gap between deep midwicket and deep square, Kohli was charging towards the ball, but slipped. The misfield allowed the second"
punched to long-off
"gets away with that quicker one on the pads, flicked towards deep midwicket"
"the slider again on middle and leg, Warner goes deep into the crease and punches it to deep midwicket"
"gets half-forward and defends, tidy over so far"
steps out and works it with the spin to long-on
"beauty, this is what the purists have been waiting for. Varun Aaron bangs a length ball on middle, Williamson makes room and lofts it on the up over mid-off, sweet connection"
"this one's short on the body, Williamson whips it off his hip to deep square leg"
"he's simply proving his game isn't about power. This was short on middle, Warner arches back to make a bit of room and uses the pace to glide it past the wicketkeeper, brilliant batting"
nearly chopped it back onto the stumps as he looks to dab it behind the wicket
"work for the umpire, this one's on a fifth stump on the leg side"
whipped to midwicket where Watson dives to his left to save a run for his team
"that's one of the better balls he's bowled, bouncer at 136 clicks outside off, Williamson initially looked to fetch the pull from outside off, but withdrew"
"short, wide and punished. Warner uses the depth of the crease to good effect again as he slaps that one into the gap at extra cover. Tremendous power in his swing. What a way to get to a half-century. Top knock this"
cuts it straight to point this time
"slides one into middle and leg, punched to long-on"
"pushed through quicker, Williamson eases it past midwicket. 101kph. Each delivery in this over has been faster than the previous one"
"a misfield at cover gives them a single, Kedar Jadhav the culprit. He made room and struck that really hard"
makes room and steers it towards deep point
this is a googly which Williamson reads off the hand and dabs it towards short third man for a quick single
"swept, but not entirely off the middle, it was in the air, but short of the man running around at deep square leg"
"sharp turn back into middle and leg, Williamson steps out and tucks it with the spin to short fine leg"
"drilled back to the bowler, who does well to stop it on his followthrough"
"turns away from outside off, driven wide of point"
gets to the pitch of the ball and works it across the line to long-on
"pulled, but just short of Aaron at fine leg. The ball got big on him, he fetched it from outside off and nearly top-edged it straight to the fielder. Kohli applauds the effort of his bowler and fielder"
"slower one on middle, Warner clears his front leg and muscles the pull into the deep midwicket region. Virat Kohli was haring around the ropes from wide long-on, dished in a full-length dive like he would in a swimming pool, but still couldn't get to the ball. Tremendous placement from Warner"
"too full outside off, smacked hard to De Villiers at wide long-off"
delicious from KW! Walks across the stumps to get inside the line of that half-volley and flick it with his powerful wrists over midwicket. One bounce into the boundary. Watson went for a yorker and missed his length
"play and a miss. Looks to play a delicate dab behind short third man, but was beaten for pace"
back away and slaps the short ball straight to sweeper cover
"nothing seems to be going right for RCB. This one was a length ball, but it was angling in, KW backed away to go over cover, but could only find a thick edge past the keeper's desperate dive to his right, into the third man boundary"
pushed wide of cover to bring Warner back on strike
"excellent yorker on middle, perhaps the best ball he's bowled all evening, Warner jams his bat down in time to squeeze that behind point"
"pulls and misses. Once again looks to walk across to play the shot, this time he was cramped for room and swung a little too early"
"Dhoni-esque whip. At the moment., he seems to be favouring the deep midwicket region. Picks the length ball from outside off into the deep square leg region. Powerful, powerful wrists he's got."
"another yorker that tails back in, squeezed past the bowler. Not a bad over, but SRH still got the runs"
wonder if his mind has been pre-programmed to bowl short. Williamson rocks back and pulls it into the gap at deep midwicket.
"full toss on middle, he walks across and whips it to deep midwicket, one bounce to the man there"
"steps out and picks the bones out of that delivery, hit straight as a dye as well, Rasool threw himself towards the ball with his left-hands, could have easily broken a finger. The ball missed them and hit his palm instead"
"looks to pull, is done in by the slowness of the delivery this time, hit on the body"
"doesn't get underneath the flight, mistimes the lofted hit to long-on"
"makes room, and sees Rasool follow him. It was short, giving enough time for Warner to wait, wait and wait before swinging that over long-on."
"starts off with a slow leg-cutter outside off, KW takes it on the full and works it towards deep midwicket"
"this is Warner's own version of the helicopter hit. Absolute carnage here in Hyderabad. Too full and slanting away, Warner stays inside the crease and plays the whiplash that sails over deep midwicket. He becomes the leading run-getter in the competition with that hit."
"this time the slower bouncer on middle. Has it made any difference? No. Warner walks towards the leg side, gives himself ample room to play the pull and muscles the pull into the gap at deep midwicket."
"this is mindblowing! He's toying with the bowling here. Or maybe that would be an understatement. Too short on leg stump, Warner arches back to make room and uses the pace to help it over third man"
"this one's full, Warner makes room and bunts it to long-off"
makes a bit of room and slaps the short ball to sweeper cover
"change or no change, it doesn't matter. KW gets down on one knee and uses his reach to sweep that into the deep backward square leg boundary"
works it with soft hands towards midwicket
"Oh, wait. Have I really seen Warner miss a ball? Looks to play the switch hit, but misses."
"didn't time it well, but he's got a slug. Too much thickness in his blade, but take no credit away from Warner. This wasn't in his hitting arc, but he still managed to clear his front leg and slog that across the line over long-on. Why play reverse dabs and switch hits when you can hit the ball long and hard like that?"
"this time he's holed out to long-off, and Shamsi immediately runs around towards his captain to trigger the Bus Driver's celebration. Warner once again looked to clear the ropes, but didn't quite get the elevation as de Villiers, standing a good 10 yards in from the ropes, took a comfortable catch. A century was there for the taking. Maybe even more."
"low full toss on the pad, flicked towards Kohli at deep midwicket"
"swings one across the line to long-on, slipped as he turned for the second"
"sensational, outstanding, mindblowing....I'm running out of superlatives. Short of length outside off, he walks across the stumps and then brings those steely wrists into play as he whips that one bounce into the deep square leg boundary."
"full and tailing into middle and leg, flicked to deep midwicket. First game in a month and he has a fifty. Super knock"
mistimes a drive down to long-off
"softest of dismissals. Short ball, and no third man,  so Williamson's intention of going over the infield was right, but he only managed to get a faint nick through to KL Rahul. Watson was looking towards third man, but is lucky."
uses the pace of the bowler and steers it down to third man
"short of length delivery on off at 137kph, Ojha looks to ride the bounce and steer it down to third man, but misses"
"miscued, and AB de Villiers takes a dolly at long-on. This was short of length on middle, Ojha was cramped for room as he looked to pull and only managed to skew it straight to the fielder."
"gets stuck in this time! Richardson looks to test the bounce of the surface, and boy, it's a terrible idea. The short ball was sitting up nicely for Henriques who pulled it with disdain into the shortest boundary at deep midwicket"
"slower one outside off, swings early and misses, keeper collects on the bounce"
"he's teed off like a golfer and has picked the bones out of that! This one was a length ball, right in the slot and Henriques hammered over long-on, off the middle of the bat and two short of 100 metres. That would have cleared any international ground"
"slogs, gets a thick inside edge to deep midwicket"
"this one breaks back into the batsman, who looks to make room and dab it towards short third, gets into a tangle"
"swung across the line towards Sachin Baby at deep midwicket, good work to collect it on the bounce"
"this one is a googly, he makes room and cuts it to deep point"
"another wrong-un, gets to the pitch of the ball and flicks it to deep midwicket"
"too predictable, some of the cleanest hitting I've seen tonight from Moises. Steps out, gets underneath the flight and deposits that over long-off"
"shortens his length, only to be clobbered into the deep midwicker boundary. Henriques set himself up to pull and executed the stoke superbly by bisecting the gap there"
"full but well outside off, good judgment by the batsman to let that go"
"excellent yorker outside off, he carves over point, towards third man,where Richardson misfields, but recovers well to fire the flat throw. Rahul collects, but realises he has to who has to back flick the ball, which he does well despite missing the stumps the first time. And just as the LED light flashes to indicate the dislodging of the bail, Hooda's bat is in the air despite the full-length dive. If the face of his bat was down, he would have survived. Good work by Rahul to break the bails despite being off balance. Not sure why he'd look for the second when Henriques was belting the ball long and far."
"swing and a miss, looks to make room and go over the off side"
"full outside off, drilled to long-off"
"short and wide outside off, slapped to deep point. He was lucky to get away with that"
"another perfect yorker outside off, squeezed toward point"
"spears another outstanding yorker on the base of off stump, Henriques was shaping to go straight down the ground, but had to quickly readjust and get his bat down to keep the ball out from hitting the stumps. They take a run"
"shapes back in from middle, Kohli tucks it to square leg to get off the mark immediately"
"short and slanting across to Rahul who glides it wide of third man, good running to come back for the second"
"shows the full face of the bat and crunches it down the ground past mid-off. Too full from Nehra, there was no swing this time and all Rahul had to do was just lend direction to that. Sweet timing"
dabs it with the angle to third man
"leading edge, just past cover. Short of length on middle and leg, Kohli looked to wrist it past midwicket, but closed the bat face early, no damage done"
hops back into the crease and runs the short ball down to third man
"floats a half-volley on the pads, flicked towards deep midwicket where a fumble from Ashish Reddy gives them the second"
"crunching cover drive that. Too full, Rahul got to the pitch of the ball and lofted it over the infield. So clean, so beautiful when he doesn't play those ugly swipes. Pure timing"
dabbed with soft hands towards third man again
"looks to cut, not much room to work with, bunted back to the bowler"
stays inside the crease and angles the full ball on off stump towards third man
"placement superb, timing even better. This was too short, he goes back into the crease and opens his wrists up to get the ball behind point. Third man was too fine. Top shot"
"angles a full delivery on off stump, Kohli gets forward and defends"
"tests him with the short ball, Kohli is up for the challenge as he hooks, gets it down to deep fine leg"
"another dab, once again towards third man. Looks like this is a deliberate ploy. Not much room to work with again, Rahul uses the pace to hit the gap"
sashays down the track and slaps the length ball past cover point. Disdainfully done.
"shortens his length this time as Kohli looks to step out again, he's cramped for room and bunts it to point"
"short on middle and leg, flicked uppishly over square leg"
hit high on the thigh pad and they get a run off the deflection. Kohli looked to work it across the line. Or was there a inside edge? Thin one maybe
"too short and sliding down leg, easy call for the umpire as Rahul lets that go"
"floats it full on middle from wide of the crease, Rahul gets forward and blocks"
"oh yea, he's hit that well. Makes room and plays the pick up shot superbly. He wanted to hit it over cover point, so opened the bat face late and wen through with the stroke, one bounce into the boundary"
chopped down to third man again
opens the bat face and glides it straight to short third man
"slower one on middle, Kohli can't generate much power off that, pats it with soft hands behind square on the off side"
"lands a good length delivery on off stump, tucked towards square leg"
"off cutter on the pads, Rahul drops it with soft hands towards square leg"
stabs that ball towards cover point for a quick single
"flicked wide of mid-on, lazy running for which the third umpire is summoned. Looks like Rahul made his ground at the non-striker's end though"
"hint of width outside off, driven firmly to deep cover"
"play and a miss. Once again, looking to use Nehra's pace to run it down to third man, there wasn't much room this time and it missed the edge by a whisker"
"lift off the deck from the short of length area on middle, dabbed with soft hands to gully"
"strikes with his second delivery, and that is a big blow. Kohli steps out, gives himself room and slaps that on the up. Most things right till then, except he hit it straight to Ashish Reddy at backward point. It wasn't an easy catch by any means, but Reddy made it look easy. What's the fuss about when Fizz is around? Kohli is out for his lowest score this season"
dipping slower delivery across the batsman who toe-ends an attempted drive back down the pitch
"driven well, but straight to Henriques at cover"
"width on offer, crunched to sweeper cover"
"back of length delivery on middle and leg, tucked towards deep square leg"
"short of length outside off, punched towards sweeper cover, he called two almost as soon as he hit the ball"
"comedy of errors, oh Nehra what have you done? AB de Villiers proves he's human after all, by top-edging a bouncer. It was swirling in the air for a long, long time, and Nehra at deep fine leg didn't even get a hand on it. How costly will it prove to be?"
driven straight to mid-off
"full and straight on middle, thumped towards long-on, Rahul hared back for the second, de Villiers applauds him for the call"
"clean strike over the infield, straight to long-off"
"short and sliding across, Rahul lets that go. Not sure why. He could have either cut or dabbed it behind the keeper."
"drives, hits it off the sweet spot to deep cover"
beautiful flow of the bat as Rahul picked the length ball over the cover fielder. One bounce into the boundary. Went through with a straight bat. Sparkling touch
works it with soft hands to midwicket for a quick single
"looks to go over cover, ends up slicing it over point. The fielder gave it chase but had no chance on this fast outfield"
"whipped wide of midwicket, excellent running"
"slower and fuller on middle, Rahul picks it off the hand and eases it past the bowler to long-on"
"short, and dispatched. Swivels and pulls imperiously. Gets enough elevation as the ball sails into the deep square leg boundary"
steered behind point with the pace of the bowler
"superb stop at cover by Hooda, thew himself to his left to stop that fierce hit. Saved three runs for his side"
width and crunched into the point boundary. Once again too predictable. You can't bang the ball short at 123 clicks. The margin for error is minimal. The ball simply slides onto the bat and it flew off Rahul's bat face. Superb touch this
"back-of-the-hand slower ball outside off, dabbed to short third man"
"full toss on middle, struck well but he does well to put his hand out on his followthrough to stop a certain boundary"
"off-cutter on middle and leg, whipped to deep midwicket"
"looks to go over cover, gets a thick inside edge to deep midwicket"
"on the hips, wristed towards the man running in from deep fine leg"
"waits and then eases the short ball with the width to Williamson at backward point, de Villiers was chancing a risky run and was home by the time the throw came in"
"looks to pull, but the ball doesn't rise above his knee, toe-ends it to midwicket"
"big moment in the match. He was looking in sparkling touch, but has to go. Looks to run the ball down to third man, this was a lot slower from Henriques, and Rahul was cramped for room as he angled the bat. Naman Ojha accepts that one gleefully. Important partnership broken."
"<b> dropped by Hooda at extra cover. </b> It was full outside off, de Villiers crunched that to him, stinging blow."
"that's adding insult to injury. Short and angling across, de Villiers waits inside the crease and opens the bat face at the last moment to steer it wide of point, it flew off the bat."
"fails to squeeze that behind the keeper, it was a yorker-lenngth delivery"
"toe-ends a pull to long-off, the bat face was facing skywards as he made contact"
uses the depth of the crease to rise onto his toes and nurdle it to fine leg
steps out to take it on the full and cracks it straight back to Sran who copes a blow on the body as he looks to stop it. Saved a couple of runs again
"length ball sliding into middle and leg, Watson plays all around that one, but he umpire indicates it was sliding down leg. Henriques didn't appeal, but joined in to ask politely seeing Naman Ojha go up"
"Sran magic! Watson tucks it towards deep square and sets off for a second run, Sran swooped in and picked it cleanly before firing a rocket throw on the bounce at the striker's end. Towards the end of the run, Watson was cruising before he realised he had to stretch forward. Have to tell you one centimeter has cost Watson dear here."
dabs it behind point to get off the mark
makes room and thumps it down to long-off
gets forward and drives that one to cover
"once again can't split the gap, hit straight to mid-off."
"low full toss on middle, thumped down the ground, Warner at long-off is quick to slide across the turf and hurl a throw at the non-striker's end"
"slower one on middle and leg, de Villiers knows what's coming, but can't get out of the tangle, defends awkwardly"
"low, dipping yorker on middle, bunted down to long-on"
"he's fetched the slog from outside off and gets maximum distance on that. It was a mis-hit, but had enough to clear the long-on boundary"
flicks a high full toss wide of midwicket
"right into the blockhole on middle, de Villers makes room and crunches it wide of cover"
"boy, oh boy, it was almost as if ABD was waiting to play it. Haven't seen a better swing of the bat than that. Henriques played into his hands by bowling it short, and he picked the bones out of that one, hitting into the top tier at deep midwicket"
"and another! He hasn't learnt. Bangs it in short, and he's imperiously pulled him in front of square, once again the deep midwicket boundary is too small. People there have to duck for cover, surely."
makes room and chips the length ball over mid-off
drilled down the ground to long-off
"width, but he can only hit it straight to the point fielder"
"cuts, but gets a thick edge that races past the keeper and into the third man boundary. Not where he intended, but it doesn't matter. Expensive over"
"right, is this over that changed it around for RCB? Floats it a slower short ball down leg, de Villiers swings leg side and picks the gap at deep fine leg. Forced the pace, and hit it off the middle"
"length ball sliding across, de Villiers walks well outside the line of the stumps and sweep-slogs it towards deep midwicket"
"full and tailing back into middle and leg, flicked over the infield to deep midwicket. Excellent timing"
pressure telling on Sran. Isn't sure what de Villiers plans to do and bowls it full and well outside off. Can't flirt with the wide line like that
"two reprieves, but not the third time. Hits the deck hard on middle, de Villiers swings, but doesn't generate enough power in the swing as he is cramped for room, Williamson at long-on is off the blocks quickly as he runs in and then dives forward to complete  good, low catch. Anticipation of the highest order. He's gone for runs alright, but he's also got the big fish. Is that the game?"
"would have been wide had he let that go, chops one down to short third man"
"width and clobbered towards deep point, it was turning away from Bhuvneshwar, but he anticipated that well to keep it down to two"
"brilliant! The fearlessness of youth, I tell you. Daring stuff. Too short, he walks across a touch, and scoops it over the keeper's head. He wanted to direct that over short fine but changed his shot at the last moment and got full value for his shot"
crunched towards deep point
"stylish flick, but straight to midwicket"
"slaps that on the up to long-off, the bat face turned in his hand as he made contact"
"high full toss outside off, the mishit whizzes past Bhuvneshwar's outstretched hands, perhaps he wasn't expecting it. The ball deflects towards long-off"
"looks to swing across the line over deep midwicket, gets a thick inside edge onto the pad, they scoot through for the run even as Bhuvi sprints across the turf an fires an underarm flick at the stumps"
"through with the slog across the line even before the ball got to him, it cut away sharply to beat the outside edge by a mile"
chipped down the ground to long-on
"into the blockhole, Baby uses his bottom hand to flick that into the gap between deep midwicket and long-on, SRH won't mind the ones and twos at this stage"
"high full toss, around the waist, and he's sliced that over short third man"
"yorker-length delivery angled into middle, squeezed to long-on"
"full toss outside off, driven down the ground to Warner who misfields on the slide to give away an extra run"
"strikes with his first delivery. It was a waist-high full toss again, right into Baby's swinging arc, he swung, but got the ball towards the maker's name, which meant Dhawan had considerable distance to run in from long-on. He did well to take a comfortable catch."
"Henriques has tipped it over the ropes at deep midwicket. Is there life in this game yet? Too full, Jadhav whips it and gets enough to clear the ropes. Didn't look like it was off the middle astonishingly"
"low full toss that tails away from the off stump, Jadhav misses a swing across the line. In trying to make contact with the ball, he was more than a couple of paces outside he crease. The umpires wanted to check if the bottom edge hit the turf before lobbing to the wicketkeeper. It clearly did. The pace of the ball was a giveaway, but umpires are always cautious these days."
"short ball hurries onto Jadhav as he looks to pull, bunts it to midwicket off the top half of the bat"
"yorker-length delivery, he somehow manages to squeeze that behind square on the leg side and comes back for the second"
"wristy flick to midwicket, a direct hit by Hooda at the bowler's end and Rasool would have been walking back to the dugout"
"swings across the line, the ball rolls off the toe-end in the opposite direction, towards point"
"steps out, takes it on the full and slaps it towards Warner at wide long-off"
"once again through with his swipe over midwicket even before the ball got to him, Ojha fumbles while collecting it on the bounce, they get a bye"
steps out and slices a full toss down to third man
"he's connected this time! Mustafizur gets the yorker wrong, and the ball sails into the deep midwicket boundary. He swung through cleanly this time"
"excellent follow-up delivery, floats it full and straight across the batsman, who can't get underneath the wild swing"
"couldn't have asked for a better delivery first up, perfect wide yorker outside off, Rasool misses the squeeze over point"
"walks across to scoop, but Bhuvneshwar bowled it too full and just outside off again, he missed"
pulled to deep square leg
"once again, bowls it full and outside off, Jadhav can't connect the heave, squeezed to long-off"
"banged in short and he's slapped that into the deep midwicket boundary. Doesn't matter, really"
"slower and fuller outside off, he fetches the slog across the line and skews it up towards Henriques who takes that skier at deep square leg with the ropes inches behind him. <b> Fourth loss in six games for RCB </b>"
