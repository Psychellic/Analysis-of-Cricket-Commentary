"keeps it on a length outside off, pushed to point"
"<b>Krunal misfields and allows four.</b> Full length ball, and Hope comes forward to push with good timing, through the covers. Krunal gave chase, slid and stopped it, but knocked it on the ropes while trying to get up and gather the ball. Not a very auspicious first touch of the ball in international cricket for Krunal"

"length ball outside off, pushed towards point and they take a quick single"
"strays on to the pads, and Hope manages to flick it very fine, past a diving Karthik and down to the fine-leg fence. Spoils what was otherwise a good first T20I over from Khaleel after that first-ball wide."
"<b>got 'im!</b> A very tentative poke outside off, with feet rooted to crease, and he gets a thin, but audible, edge through to the keeper. India have drawn first blood"

"length ball on the stumps, pushed to extra cover"
"strays on the pads, and is flicked nicely to deep square leg, but only gets one run, with a fielder there"
"<b>mix up and run out</b> that was flicked to midwicket without timing, and lobbed up. Shai Hope ran, Hetmyer responded. Suddenly Hope decided there wasn't any run there. Hetmyer turned back, and for some reason, Hope also started running towards the non-striker's end. India nearly didn't get the run out, with Rahul lobbing a throw way over Karthik's head, but Manish Pandey at backward point collected, ran to the stumps and broke them. Some confusion about who is the batsman out, and they rule that it's indeed Hope, since Hetmyer made the crease before Hope did."

"<b>top edge and taken by Karthik at short fine leg</b> quick ball at 141 clicks. Dug in short and bounced more than he expected. Went for the pull but the ball went miles in the air, Karthik ran to his right and settled nicely under it. Big wicket, given Hetmyer's hitting ability"
gentle push into the midwicket region as Pollard scampers a single
"<b>peach</b> on a length and moves across him, beats the outside edge. That was quick too"

"<b>Krunal Pandya gets his IPL teammate out</b> another one fired in, Pollard went for it, but his bat turned in his hand. It carries straight to Manish Pandey at long-on. He had moved straighter than he was when Pollard had hit the six off Krunal in his last over"

"superb catch by Dhawan at long-on! Lil Bravo looks to go downtown but is beaten by the turn and dip, goes through with the stroke and toe-ends it. This was not timed but it was a tough catch still because Dhawan had to run around to his right. He did well in getting to the ball and then leapt sideways to take the ball airborne. West Indies sink further."
"quicker length ball on the pads, turned to midwicket. Looks for a quick single but is sent back"
"nice flight, gets this to drift away and spin back in. He gets to the pitch of the ball and defends"
swept from outside off towards deep square where Bumrah comes up with a superb effort. Sprinted hard to his left and was on the move as he stopped the ball. Recovered well to fire a superb throw as well.

"shuffles across a tad too much to whip, ends up tickling his pad to the leg side. Ball pitched outside leg though."
"didn't read the googly at all. Plays a feeble drive, didn't get to the pitch, had a waft at that and managed the thinnest of edges to Dinesh Karthik."

bunts this delivery off a length towards short midwicket
"tight line, once again on a length, just outside off, squirts this towards point."

right behind the line as he defends this length ball into the off side.
"pinned on the pad and he's trapped plumb in front. Went too far back inside the crease to tuck this square on the leg side, beaten by the fizz and once he was struck on the pad, there was only one decision from the umpire. He was so plumb that he didn't even bother reviewing it. <b> Last time he played here, Carlos made everyone remember his name. Tame dismissal this time. </b>"
"struck on the back pad but this googly spun away. Did it pitch outside leg? Only Kuldeep was convinced about the lbw, Rohit wasn't sure but reviews anyway. Let's see. Replays confirms this pitched outside leg. <b> India lose their review. </b>"
"<strong>Dropped by Rahul!</strong> So high in the air, so high that KL Rahul had enough time to run around from long-off, settle himself underneath the delivery to try and catch. As it turns out, he's put down this slog, and what's worse, the ball goes to the boundary. Rahul didn't read it right, he ran in first, then ran back and then seemed to have misjudged it completely. Wonder if Rahul was also thrown off by Pant in his line of sight."
slogs this length ball down to long-on again.
"shapes to play a short-arm jab, mistimes it to short midwicket."

"swung across the line, top-edges this so high but falls short of Pandey coming in from long-on."
"right into the blockole, squeezed down towards Pandey, who puts in a superb dive at long-on to cut that off. Dhawan was inside the ring, but didn't bother running back. So Pandey had to recover quickly and then fire the throw, instead of just relaying it to Dhawan had he run back."

"superb delivery again, honing in towards the base of middle, squeeze back."

"he's picked the bones out of this slower length ball, but on the bounce to Umesh at deep midwicket. A meter on either side and it would've been four."
"swings north, ball goes south. Looked for an ugly hoick to this length ball over mid-on but ended up slicing this off a thick outside edge to beat short third man."
"slants this length ball across, he looks to use the room to slap this over point but is beaten because he played too early."
"muscled away but straight down Umesh's throat at deep midwicket. <b> Khaleel's first T20I wicket. </b> This was another cutter, Allen picked the length early and the intention was right in trying to pull, but it was almost as if he didn't realise there was a fielder right there at the ropes."
toe-ends a low full toss to long-on
"thick outside edge as he looked to steer this behind point, beat DK's full-length dive to his left and races to the third man boundary."

"belted so hard that Umesh's face was on the firing line, somehow managed to get out of the way. Down to long-off."
"this is poor from Umesh. Bangs one in short, this was bowled at a friendly pace too and he fetched it from outside off to pull him imperiously to the square leg boundary."
slips a full toss down leg and he's swung this to the deep backward square leg boundary. Very very poor from Umesh. No excuses to deliver full tosses at this stage even if there may be dew.

"tries the helicopter shot, this goes all along the ground to wide long-on."
"swing and a miss. Another slower ball angling away, played too early."
"sliced over the infield to beat point and short third man running back. Once it lands on the practice pitches, there's no stopping that."

"short ball, but doesn't bounce. 144 kph again. Angling into Rohit, who tries to work it away but it flies off his pad towards the slips"
"keeps it on a length outside off that time, Rohit lets it go. 145kph"
"on the up and away. Goes too full, and there is enough room outside off for Rohit to free his arms and get into a flowing drive that goes over the in-field and into the fence"
gets it to bounce uncomfortably off a length from off. Rohit reacts quickly to keep it down and take his bottom hand off the bat
"too wide outside off, outside the tram lines in fact and is called 'wide'"
"<b>through him, at 147 kph</b> And they've gone for the review, the West Indians reckon Rohit got a touch on that and is caught behind. <b>And replays confirm an inside edge</b> Rohit will have to go here. Superb delivery, on a length, coming back into the batsman at high pace. It took his inside edge and flew, but Ramdin dived to his left and took a smart catch. Rohit has owned Eden Gardens most times, but not to be today"
"length ball on leg stump, defended with an angled bat off the back foot into the midwicket region"
"on the pads again, and this time Dhawan moves slightly across to work it away to fine leg, where Hetmyer runs quickly around to his left and tumbles to save the boundary"

"overpitched, almost a full toss, he goes for the drive but gets an inside edge that rolls to square leg"
"strays on the pads, and at his pace, the ball is going to fly. Only leg-byes, but it takes the pad and goes very fine, quickly into the fine leg fence"
"back of a length, another pacy delivery. Rises up and has Dhawan defending from almost shoulder height"
"<b>castled</b> Another 147kph ripper, pitches on a length, straightens a bit. Dhawan went for the drive, leaving a big gap between bat and pad. The ball homed through it like a heat-seaking missile. Sends the stumps cartwheeling. Oshane Thomas is on fire"
