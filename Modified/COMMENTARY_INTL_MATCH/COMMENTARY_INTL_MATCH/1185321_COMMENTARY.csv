"full and straight, Finch moves across and clips towards midwicket without much in the way of timing"
"131kph/81mph, the nip-backer, so often a problem for Finch, who is caught on the crease and the ball pings towards gully off the thigh... going well over"
"ooh, well bowled, in the corridor and wobbling off a rotating seam, <b>past the outside edge with Finch back</b>... A whisker away"
"fuller, gets him coming forward, punched to mid-off"
"exacting line, 129kph/80mph and straightening a touch just outside off, Finch steers it watchfully square - just one of Sipamla's first over, too"

"fullish, holding its line as Finch chops down and deflects into the covers"

"length, angling in and Finch can only jab down into the turf back towards the bowler"
"short and cut firmly in front of point, seemingly heading to the ropes until Kyle Verreynne threw himself full length to get a hand in the way"

"in the channel, 127kph/79mph and again skipping through to the keeper"
"pinned on the pads, <b>up goes the finger!</b> Phehlukwayo squeals in celebration, but Smith will <b>review</b> - looked like it was probably hitting leg stump to me. What does Hawk-Eye say? <b>Umpire's call,</b> clipping the woodwork, Smith has to go!

fullish and driven through the covers
"shortish, 143kph/89mph and cut off the back foot"
tight lines and Finch can't do much with this
"<b>chipped to short extra cover!</b> Maiden wicket for Dupavillon - although Finch is going to make him wait for it! They are checking whether it carried, but looks like Miller scooped it cleanly.

flicked off the toes to the leg side
"another compact drive, no liberties being taken against a disciplined line and length"
"head over the ball, pressed back down the wicket"

"over the wicket now to the left-hander, clipped off the pads past square leg"
"a fraction too short, Labuschagne climbs into a pull, all along the ground to deep midwicket"
"back and across, eased down to long-on once more. Singles are the currency for now"

"back and across, eased to the on-side, midwicket swoops"

"<B>a raucous appeal!</B> Maharaj wants the lbw but was there bat involved? It's been <B>reviewed</B>... Let's see ... he dropped down into the sweep, it was pretty adjacent, but the ball never reached the pad! Under-edged off the bat past square leg. On we go"

"tossed up, too much width on that delivery, and Labuschagne gratefully cracks a cut into the cover, to bring up a home-town fifty, albeit in the visiting team's colours. Quite a moment"
Short returns the compliment with another strike-rotating single
"another single into the covers, Australia have a healthy platform. Wonder if it's time for a bit of pace to shake things up?"
"<B>who needs pace for a breakthrough?</B> Jon-Jon loops a length ball into Short's arc, a loose flick across the line ensues, and Heinrich Klaasen is on hand at mid-on to scoop up a key wicket!"
"back and across, cracked out to deep cover"

"<b>brilliant fielding in the covers, and Marsh is stranded!</b> Miller was the man once again, throwing himself full length to cut off Labuschagne's drive; Marsh was probably guilty of ball-watching but there was no way he was getting to the other end, Miller underarming to de Kock to finish the job!"
tossed up and jabbed away going back
"over the wicket to the southpaw, pushed through and Carey cuts, gets a bottom edge into the turf"
"<b>bowled 'im!</b> Carey pays the price for going back, there's a bit of grip and the ball hits the top of off stump! Smuts roars, he's got a second wicket, and Australia are stuttering again. Wanted to run it behind square, but played all around it"

"dinked leg side, he wants two here, haring for the striker's end as the throw comes in... <b>Full-length dive and he's home</b>, bringing up his maiden ODI hundred!

"<strong>down the track, into the stands!</strong> Richardson pitches it up again, but de Kock is bored of circumspection, and launches a monstrous strike <B>onto the cameraman at long-off!</B> He appears to wear that one on his bonce... ouch!"
nudged to the on side
"solid strike into the off side, but no way through there"
"driven out to cover, and half-stopped with a dive"
"driven, not quite to the pitch of the ball, back down the track"
"<B>gadzooks, that's contemptuous!</B> An attempted yorker at 136kph, de Kock saunters across his crease, picks it up languidly off his toes, and lifts it calmly over fine leg for six!"
clobbered out to point on the cut
"<B>belted out through point</B>. Too much width, rising on the back foot to pierce the field"
"<B>a stride onto the front foot, and now the runs are flowing!</B> Eased with timing through the covers, and after a run of 17 dots in 18 balls, South Africa's innings is moving up a gear"
"<B>inside-edge, onto the timbers!</B> Stunned silence around Potch, that was the least anticipated mode of dismissal for de Kock. His juices had been flowing but a moment of circumspection outside off costs him dear. Half-forward as Hazlewood probes on that full length again, and that's the end of a potent opening stand!"
"on the back foot, tapped out to cover"
"leaning forward cautiously, gauging the pace of this deck with a nudge to the on side"
"<B>squared up and edged wide of slip!</B> Moral victories aren't much cop for a bowler, but Smuts knew little about that, closing the face on a nudge to leg and skewing a snick through third man"
left alone outside off stump
"back of a length, outside off, poked into the covers"
very full and punched down the ground to mid-off
"tip and run into the off side, good response from Malan, rotating the strike and keeping things moving"

"full and probing, blocked again"
"shaping into the pads, solid connection on the on-drive, but straight to mid-on"
"back of a length, poked out to point"
"back of a length, pushed into the off side"
defensive prod back down the wicket
"<B>edged and gone!</B> Hazlewood has two, and now Australia sense they've got a foothold! Banging out a good length, just outside off stump with a hint of movement off the seam. Malan is lured into a fatal nibble and suddenly South Africa have two new men at the crease"
"lift on a tight line, and deflected out to point"
"banged in short, and Verreyne ducks"
"firmly drilled through the line, gathered swiftly at mid-on as they rush through for the single"

"back of a length, leg-sided, worked past square leg"
rising on the back foot to punch a drive back to the bowler

stabbed down into the crease from back of a length
"back of a length again, tucked off the toes to midwicket"
"leg-sided once more, no need to over-hit those, as Vereynne works another single to deep square leg"
"<B>skewed high over the covers!</B> Ambition on the lofted drive, but the ball isn't quite there for the shot. But it plugs safe behind the ring, and South Africa accept the single"
"a woolly pull, in the air through the gap at midwicket. Another less-than-convincing stroke, a self-preservatory slap really, and gets away with it"
leaning onto a push to cover. A bit too much excitement in that over for South Africa's liking
"looped onto a good length, patted to mid-on"
"well bowled, lovely flight on a full length, watched onto a defensive push back down the pitch"
"flapped across the line from just back of a length, intercepted at mid-on"
stabbed out to cover off the back foot
"<B>short, flat and hammered!</B> Smuts seizes on the drag-on early, powering it emphatically through the covers, and through a despairing outstretched hand on the edge of the rope"
"finds a bit of a leading edge, but safe enough. South Africa keep pressing on serenely after Hazlewood's double strikes"
"flapped out to midwicket, a waft across the line"
"on the back foot again, nudged to mid-on"
"up on the toes, RIchardson bends the back at 140kph/87mph to force Smuts back into his crease to defend"
"flashed off the hip, around the corner to backward square"
"back and across, defending out to cover"
"tight line on off stump, lifting into a defensive block"
clipped off the pads as Marsh strays leg-side. Easy pickings
"on the toes once more, another solid contact but straight at the fielder this time"
"<B>a baseball club through the leg side!</B> A fraction too short, and hauled aggressively in front of square!"
"short again, but with more oomph behind it, another pull is swept up by midwicket this time"
firmly blocked back down the wicket
"back of a length, nurdled off the legs to midwicket. that's a progressive over for South Africa, singles and a boundary to keep things cruising"
"crashed out through the leg side, hauled from well wide of off stump to deep midwicket"
closing the face on a nurdle to mid-on
"short and <strong>flapped out through deep midwicket!</strong> Didn't get on top of the stroke at all, but wellied it wide of the catcher and out through the gap in the outfield"
"<B>now that's a better stroke!</B> Over-pitched from Richardson, and clattered back through the bowler's shins with a crease-bound wipe, feet retreating towards the stumps but eyes firmly on the prize!"
"<B>short this time and launched over backward square!</B> Right underneath the stroke with an absence of circumspection, lifted high, high and mighty into the stands!"
"another pull, more composed, another single. A dent of an over that. A good time for Australia to have a <B>drink</B>"
"immediately draws an lbw appeal, as he drifts one in from round the wicket to hit Verreynne on the back leg. Heading down"
"lobbed up, presses out to defended on off"

uses the feet and punches down the ground

punched down the ground for another single
"dobbed on middle and leg, defended"
"<b>biffed down the ground!</b> Full in the slot and Smut shovels through long-on - almost literally, as Kane Richardson is unable to prevent it from getting past him for four"
tapped away coming across
"flighted delivery, Smuts sweeps and misses, hit on the back leg... bit of a speculative appeal, but Australia <i>do</i> in the end <b>review</b>, how close was this? Not sure if that was the slider or the googly, but Smuts has <i>just</i> managed to get outside the line of off stump. So the on-field decision stands"
floated up and nudged to the on side
"tosses up the legbreak on middle and leg, Smuts leans out to defend with a straight bat"
flat outside off and Smuts cuts to the man at point
"lobs up his left-arm wristies from over the wicket, Verreynne taps it away"
pushed through and punched back down the ground to long-on
dinked into the leg side
"sliding across the right-hander, who drops back and <b>belts a cut through point!</b> Cashed in on the width and dispatched four"
"lobbed up on the stumps, Verreynne nudges to leg"
"lets go a full toss which Verreynnne swings hard at, only manages one through square leg"
"oi-vey, <b>how has that missed leg stump??</b> Googly from Zampa and it runs back at Verreynne as he scissors the bat down in vain on a cut, but it slips through and rebounds off the keeper's gloves!"
"uses the feet, punched down the ground"
"tossed up, goes for the slog-sweep and misses again, this one spinning away through to the keeper"
comes forward and pushes down the ground to long-off
"full length and drifting in, worked to midwicket"

"pace off, 114kph outside off as Smuts walks into line and works it to midwicket"
"another cutter, jabbed into the leg side, square of midwicket this time for a single"
"dug in at 141kph/88mph, Verreynne takes it on, there's a man waiting on the rope... <b>clears him with a flat biff!</b> Short was the man back at deep square leg, but he lived up to his name, unable to reach it as he leapt one-handed!"
"goes again, <b>confidently heaved into the crowd this time!</b> Half-tracker from Richardson, and Verreynne tucks in, slamming six more well in front of square"
"looped up on off stump and swept hard, <b>collared through square leg!</b> Three boundaries in a row for SA"
"loops this up a bit slower, hits the pads as Smuts leans out, probably spinning too much"
"dragged down, short and inviting, <b>Smuts mows it to the rope at deep square!</b> Pressure on the bowler"
"flighted, slow and loopy wide of the stumps, opens the face and dabs towards backward point"
full in the slot and tucked down the ground to long-on

sprays this one down the leg side
"slower ball, whipped towards midwicket"
"full on middle stump, dug out into the covers"
"pitched up and taken off the toes through the leg side, into a gap for two - <b>that's a half-century for Verreynne</b> in only his third ODI. Raises the bat to the crowd, been another fine showing from the new boy"
"lobs up the leggie on off, Smuts closes the face and pats back down to long-on"
pushed back to the bowler
"the Bosie from Zampa, and it does the job - <b>slogged to deep midwicket!</b> Bit of a drag down, but Verreynne managed to pick out the man set back almost perfectly, Short running around a few paces to take a smart catch. Well, if you can't conjure magic, something rank is almost always just as good"
pushed through on the stumps and glanced to short fine leg
"tossed up, Smuts clips this to midwicket"
"tad quicker, Smuts is struck on the pads swinging to leg... Adrian Holdstock shakes his head, don't think that was straightening enough"

shuffles into line on off stump and shows it a straight bat
"good length outside off, tapped down into the covers"
on the stumps and flicked fine for Klaasen's first run
"pitched up, Smuts extends the arms, belts it back over mid-on... <b>Maiden fifty for Smuts, too!</b> Nice way to get there - just a wave of the bat to the changing room, he'll want to go on"
lobbed up on off and pushed into the covers

"dabbed to the on side, squared up by a tighter line"

"back of a length, slapped off the toe of the bat out through deep midwicket"
"on the back foot, hauled to the leg side"

"swept, from a very full length, miss that at your peril! Solid connection but straight to square leg"
"back into the crease, nudged from a leg-stump line to midwicket"
"<B>swept again, with power and panache!</B> Shaping past the leg stump, it's in the air for a while, but bissects the field perfectly behind square!"
"pumped down the ground to long-off, another single to the cause"
"looped onto a full length again, and tapped back to the bowler. Another over of effortless progress from South Africa"

"skids a touch on the back foot, kept out with a high elbow"
"chipped to long-on, singles everywhere, like the leak of Tinder's personal data"

punched off the back foot out into the covers
"full length on off stump, nudged to midwicket to complete the over. It's a breeze"
"<B>honked high into the sky and Smuts turns away in disgust!</B> He knew from the moment he hit it that he'd got it all wrong, crunching through the line of a full-length ball, but failing to pick the change in pace. The slower ball does the trick as Warner steadies himself at wide long-on, and that's the end of a tremendous, and surely, matchwinning innings"

"stretching onto the front foot, tapped into the covers"
"advancing to the pitch, attempted nurdle to the leg side but Hazlewood sees him coming and drags back his length"
"<strong>a nibble outside off!</strong> That's a quality delivery from Hazlewood, exploding off the seam and bouncing past a startled edge. Gets away with it"
"drilled down the ground and <B>dropped at mid-on!</B> It's completely burst through Warner's fingers, with such power that it barely loses any pace in reaching the rope for Klaasen's fifty, yet another telling contribution in this series!"
"slower ball, well directed, draws the block"
"flashed hard into the covers as Richardson overpitches, but better fielding this time limits the damage"
"nudged to mid-off, an instant call from the alert Miller"
"punched back to the bowler, no room to work with this time"
"dipping into the legs, clipped to Warner at mid-on, whose gather and shy is rapid, but so too is the batsman"
"short, and slow. A <strong>languid pull </strong>into the yawning gap at square leg! How crispy do you like your toast?"
<B>belted through the covers with disdainful power!</B> Met right under the eyeline and coshed to the rope
"<B>what a way to win it!</B> A furious pick-up over long-on! South Africa have romped to an emphatic six-wicket win, and a 3-0 whitewash!"
