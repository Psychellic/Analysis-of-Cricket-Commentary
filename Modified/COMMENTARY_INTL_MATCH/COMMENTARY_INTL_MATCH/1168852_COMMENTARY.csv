"great start to the innings, short and wide outside off and slashed to square third man for four off the back foot"
"strays on the pads and he flicks, but straigh tto the short fine leg fielder."
"length ball, strays on the pads again, but gets away with it again. Kamran just tucks it in front of him for the bowler to field"
"good length, moving a touch away from off stump, pushed towards point"
"fuller on the stumps, driven nicely but straight to mid-off"
"length ball on the pads again, and it just flicked his pad on the way to the keeper, which saves it from being called a wide. Good comeback from Sami after being hit for four off the first ball - five dots to follow"
"<b>down the track and over the top</b> fuller ball, he spotted it and came down the track, used his bottom hand to flat-bat it over the head of mid-on"
"good comeback, bouncer outside off, on the fourth stump line, and Imam sways out of the way"
"fuller on the stumps, tucked to mid-on's left for a quick single"
"ooh nice ball, on a length and angling across him, moves past the outside edge. He was trying to poke at it, fortunate perhaps to not get an edge"
"a fraction short and Kamran pulls, but doesn't get the timing quite right. Still gets enough on it to send it to deep midwicket, but there is a fielder there"
"slower ball, fuller length, he waits for it and tucks it to square leg"
"makes room but this was a length ball on leg stump, so he can't free his arms. Ends up cutting it to third man from close to his body"
"he strays on the pads once again and this time Kamran makes him pay, pulling it fine past the short fine leg for a boundary"
"too short once again and on the pads, Kamran dismisses this with authority, pulling it to the square leg boundary"
overcompensates with one outside off - but it's too short and too wide. Kamran gets on his toes to cut it powerfully to the point fence. He's rocketing away and Sami is feeling the heat
"better line, closer to off-stump and fuller. Kamran comes on the front foot and drives fluently, but straight to cover"
"good yorker, and he digs it out in the offside"
"<b>good effort by the man at third man but he can't get there</b> Musa was at third man, ran forward and dived, but the ball bounced just in front. Imam had come down the track for a big old heave, but only got a top edge that flew away"
slashed to third man again
"yorker on middle stump, and dug back out to the bowler"
"slashed hard, too short and wide outside off, but Delport at point sticks his hand out to his right and stops the ball. that was travelling fast"
"<b>ooh nasty bouncer</b> it's been given as a wide, but it was pitched in the line of off stump and moved back sharply at head height, forcing the batsman to duck. Went down leg. It probably hit a crack, which led to the extravagant movement"
clipped to square leg
"fuller length on off, driven firmly and Walton at cover misfields, parries the ball to mid-off and allows a single."
"<b>boom</b> too short and he rocks back to pull this, sends it all the way too, over square leg"
<b>swatted</b> too short again and Kamran pulls this in front of square this time from middle stump. Rumman is not quick enough to be bowling that length and the ball's just sitting up to be smashed.
"slower ball, flicked to short fine leg. They take the quick single, a direct hit might have been trouble"
"<b>what a shot</b> full ball on the stumps, and he takes one step forward and swings cleanly, lifting the ball back over the bowler's head and into the sightscreen."
"better ball, back of a length on the fourth stump line. He wanted to swivel-pull that but it kept a bit low and went under his bat"
"back of a length again, outside off, he gets this to bounce a bit. Jabbed down towards short third man"
""
"fuller ball on the stumps, clipped off his toes towards mid-on"
"nicely bowled, yorker on off-stump and dealt with nicely too, just opened the face of the bat to glide it past point"
"too short again but doesn't bounce much, tucked to deep square leg"
"yorker outside off again, and he wanted to stroke it through cover with a horizontal bat, but ends up getting an under-edge back to the bowler"
"<b>take that</b> Kamran goes straight again. This was another attempted yorker, on the stumps though, and he cleared his leg just a bit and lifted it back over the bowler's head. Held his shape well, and the ball bounces just inside the rope"
"too full on the pads, clipped off his toes to long-on"
"fuller outside off, driven past point and into the gap. Sweeper runs around to his left to clean up"
"too short and punished. Every bowler has been guilty of this and the openers have capitalised. This was the quicker one, but far too short and he rocks back to pull it to the square leg boundary"
"fuller one on the stumps, clipped to square leg"
"full toss, pushed into the offside past cover"
"tossed up, almost a yorker, he waits for it and pushes it into the offside to get a quick single"
"back of a length outside off, he waits for it and glides it to third man"
"back of a length, on off stump, steered to point"
"too short once again, and he's quickly on to it. Swivels to pull this from chest height to the fine leg boundary"
"too short again but a bit quicker, so Kamran is slightly late on the pull. Still gets enough meat on it to send it to deep square leg, but there's a fielder there"
"<b>walloped</b> gives him the charge, down the track and giving  himself some room and smashes it over extra cover. The ball goes flat but all the way. Stunning hit. It hit the advertising hoarding on the full, so it's a six. They needed plenty of replays to decide if it was a six or a four. The ball had just hit the bottom of the hoarding. There'll be endless replays of that if Zalmi win by 1 or 2 runs."
"<b>stunning</b> that's a short-arm jab of a cover drive, effortlessly elegant, and it races across the turf to the extra cover boundary. Imam's having a great day out"
"<b>slog-swept for six</b> Kamran reminds people he's also hitting them sweetly, went down on one knee and just blasted this into the midwicket stands"
"<b>And that's got air miles on it</b> This is even bigger, another slog-swept six and it just sails and sails and sails over midwicket. And that's also his fifty. Off just 29 balls. After being 4 off 6."
oh I wouldn't want to be Shadab Khan right now. This was fuller outside off and he carves it past point for a four. This is carnage
"too short and spinning away from him from middle stump, he gives himself room and slashes it hard. But in a breather of sorts for the bowler, there is a man on the fence so it's only one run"
"good length, spinning back into his pads, and he tucks it to midwicket"
"too short again, and too wide, and Kamran cuts this past short third man to end the over with a boundary. How relieved will Shadab be that it's finally over."
"<b>top edge goes for four</b> nothing going right for the bowlers. This was a well-directed short ball for a change, rose up to head height. He wanted to pull it, got a top edge, went over the keeper for four"
"length ball outside off, dabbed to third man"
"good yorker on middle stump, steered to third man"
"good length on the stumps, he moves across and clips to deep midwicket"
"full ball again on the stumps, punched to point, who mis-fields and allows an easy run"
"<b>peachy</b> brings up his fifty with a textbook cover drive. It seemed like a gentle push, but the timing was so good it fairly flew across the grass. Gets to 50 off just 26 balls."
"starts off with a short one, but there's no pace on the ball. He gets down low to pull it to deep square leg"
"too short outside off, and he cuts it fine, too fine for short third man whose sprint is in vain."
"back of a length again, he goes on the back foot to pull it to deep midwicket. The lack of pace helps the bowler again"
"he's not altering his length, it stays back of length. Kamran goes on the back foot and pulls with force, but a diving stop at deep square leg prevents the boundary"
pushed into the legside
very full and clipped off his toes to long-on
"gets some swing, but the line ends up fairly wide outside off, flat-batted past point"
"slower ball, beats him outside off. He was looking to glide it to third man, but ends up missing it"
"fuller ball, driven back to the bowler"
"loses his line, too far down leg and it's a wide"
"fuller on leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
"slashed over cover for four. Too wide and he had room to free his arms, and it was at the fullish length so right in the slot for that shot"
"full on offstump, driven to long-off"
"short ball again, and he goes to pull, but doesn't time it that well. Sends it in the air, but in the gap between deep midwicket and long-on"
"<b>caught by the keeper despite almost colliding with short third man</b> went for an ugly swipe across the line, but Delport's lack of pace has worked so far and the batsman wanted to hit it too hard. He ends up top-edging it behind him. The keeper runs to his left, and short third man runs forward, they sort of collide, but the keeper holds on. Much needed wicket, but a great knock by Imam"
"full on the stumps, driven to long-on"
"he was giving himself room, but that was too far down leg. Ends up taking his pad to short fine leg"
clipped to deep square leg
"<b>caught on the deep midwicket boundary</b> Delport has got both openers in one over, both batting on quickfire half-centuries. This was slower than his normal deliveries too, pushed wide of off stump. Kamran went for another of his slog-sweeps, but couldn't time it. Got a fair bit of height, but not enough distance, and it went straight into deep midwicket's hands. End of a fine innings"
"gets some drift and Pollard wants to clip it through the leg side, but gets a leading edge towards point"
"length ball outside off, tries to slash and misses"
"beauty. pitched on a length, drew him forward and spun past his bat."
"fuller ball on off, guided to third man"
"tossed up on off, he walked across to work it to the legside, but ends up popping it in the air. No fielder close in so safe"
"fuller ball, gets some drift in, jabbed to short midwicket"
"rapped on the pads and big appeal, but that might have been going down leg. Full ball, off-cutter, and Pollard played all around it"
<b>power from Pollard</b> that is some insane power. Just a short swing off this fuller ball and he sends it over long-on
tries to overcompensate with a quicker one and bowls it way down leg. Wide
"flatter and quicker on off, pushed to long-on"
"swing and a miss. good length outside off and he wanted to send it over long-on, but misses"
"<b>lovely shot</b> this was slow but on the shorter side, and he rocked back to slap it over extra cover off the back foot and send it to the fence"
"full toss, but he misses with the heave across the line"
"<b>that one's out of here</b> full toss low on middle stump, Pollard steps away and smashes it high and handsome over the bowler's head. Way into the stands"
"good length, quicker one, swatted to long-on"
"<b>caught behind</b> that one turned a fair way, pitched on middle on a length and broke away, took his outside edge when he was going for the big slog over cow corner, and a good take by the keeper Ronchi"
"nicely flighted on a length, Sammy just turns it from the stumps to midwicket"
"good length on off, he takes a big stride out to defend"
"<b>there's Pollard's forearms at work again</b> All he seems to do is push the ball, but it sails over the boundary. Incredible. This was a touch too full, and he took a stride forward and drove it aerially, and so well that it went over long-on"
"got that to bounce sharply, coming in off the seam from back of a length outside off. Surprised the batsman a bit, who had to jab it down towards long-on. But they run well to steal a second"
"given some room outside off and he wants to slash it, but this one also bounces more and defeats his attempted shot"
"nails it this time, a little fuller but still lots of room outside off and Sammy clears his front leg and slashes it to the point boundary"
"good length outside off, and coming back in, Sammy swats it to long-on"
"good bouncer, surprises Pollard who ducks. On offstump and rising to his head"
goes down legside but no wide given. Perhaps it flicked Pollard's pad on the way to Ronchi
"<b>dropped on the long-on fence</b> touch chance, Hales wasn't sure where the boundary was and ended up leaping for it. Tried to palm it in, and Walton was nearby waiting for the relay catch, but the ball was too far from him. This was a slower ball and Sammy hit it across the line, but didn't get timing on it. The batsmen ended up taking only one run"
"another slower ball, a slower bouncer that time. Doesn't rise more than chest height but Pollard mis-reads it and swings too early and misses."
"fuller ball, driven off his toes to long-on"
"full toss, whipped to deep midwicket"
"<b>slower bouncer, faster pull shot</b> Pollard waits for it and that power that he generates means even though it's slow and he's not got hold of it very cleanly, it sails over the square leg fence. Pollard has hit only sixes so far - four of them. Not a single four"
"low full toss, whipped between long-on and deep midwicket and they take a couple"
"swiped across the line but no timing, sweeper on the legside boundary runs to his left to clean up"
too short and too high over the batsman - wide
"on the pads and flicked powerfully. It was not that far from short fine leg, but he couldn't get down in time and it's another boundary"
"<b>he's out obstructing the field</b> He gave himself room but the bowler followed him. The ball went through Pollard at yorker length and Ronchi didn't gather cleanly. They ran a single, Pollard for some reason wanted two. Sammy wasn't interested at all and didn't move. Pollard had run down the length of the pitch, when the throw came in, and he stuck out his left leg to block the ball. They appealed immediately"
"length ball on off stump, he picks it up well and hits it straight back over the bowler's head. But long-off runs around to collect"
""
<b>smashed</b> full ball and he lifts this over long-on
"yorker on off, and dug away to the off side. But Rumman runs towards the ball, picks up and turns, and finally throws the stumps down at the bowler's end! Wahab's out, but Sammy's back on strike. <B>Excellent!</b> Poetry in motion."
"full toss, wide outside off, and hammered over point for four! Slapped to the boundary"

"<b>low full toss on leg stump</b> and he lifts this over wide long on! It's on the roof, mate!"

down the track and slapped over extra cover for the first boundary of the innings
back of a length and swiped to deep midwicket. Not timed that well and they'll have to settle for one
"backs away and lifts him over cover for six. Used Mills's pace, good length ball that moved across him slightly, he played with the angle"
"<b>nicely done</b> Mills gets this to hit the hard length and come back into the batsman, but he cuts it from close to his body, sending it very fine. Third man was too far away, had no chance to stop it"
"backs away again, but this time Mills stays outside off, short of a length at 145 kph. Too quick for the batsman to connect with the slash"
"again hits the hard length, and coming back in, he wanted to slap it away but gets it very high on the bat. Mistimed to extra cover"
"drilled down the ground for four. Too full on the stumps, too straight and Delport just smashed it back. And the speed on that ball was 147 kph"
"good length, coming back into him from outside off, tucked into the legside for a single"
"length ball outside off, coming in a bit, tucked to midwicket"
"<b>caught by Sammy at cover</b> He was backing away again and wanted to smash it through the offside, but Hasan had followed him and the ball only took the splice and bobbed up in the air for an easy catch. A steep required rate will do that to you - make you play shots you otherwise might not have"

"back of a length and coming in to him off that hard length, tucks him up. He can only push it back to the bowler"
"fuller on off, pushed to mid-off for a quick single"
"length ball on the stumps, coming in a touch, clipped to square leg"
"length ball outside off, punched to point"
that came back in sharply from a length outside off. 139 kph. Hales wanted to swat across the line but misses. The ball hits him on the right thigh pad. No serious appeal because it was clearly going down leg
"length ball outside off, gave himself some room and drove it crisply, but straight to mid-off"
"<b>leading edge caught by Pollard</b> Jordan gets his fellow Englishman. That's another good length delivery at pace. Hales clears his leg to swipe it over cow corner but gets a leading edge, and Pollard isn't going to drop those dollies inside the circle"
"ooh beauty, shapes away from the left hander, and he's beaten on the outside edge"
"too full and picked up nicely off his pads but there is a man out at deep midwicket, so only one run"
"outside edge goes for four. Good length ball, gets it to rise, he follows it with his hands and it takes a healthy edge. no slip, so it's a four"
"fuller length, pushed into the offside for a quick single"
angling across the right hander and he swishes and misses. But Wahab has over-stepped so it's a no-ball
"length ball on fourth stump, he clears his leg to swat it, but gets it off the toe end to extra cover. No run off the free hit"
"back of a length on the stumps, defended off the back foot towards the bowler"
"too full on off and he brings out a textbook cover drive. Pulled from just inside the rope with Chris Jordan flying across the turf in pursuit. Great effort to get to the ball, stop it with the boot and run back in to relay a flat throw"
"that's a misdirected bouncer down leg. Shockingly, it's not a wide! That was over his head down legside. Should have been a wide. Wahab escapes"
"slower ball from Mills, floated up outside off almost. The batsman had to adjust and ends up bunting it to mid-on"
"back of a length outside  off, flat-batted to mid-on's right"
"good length, anglingin into him at 143 kph, he pushes it to the legside"
"another slower ball, a slower bouncer almost. Walton waited for it and pulled it towards deep midwicket. Didn't try to hit it hard"
"short one, and he pulls to the square leg fence. the ball goes off the top edge, but bounces safely. He wasn't in control of that shot at all"
"length ball on the pads, moves across and tucks it to midwicket"

"<b>walloped</b> too short, sits up to be hit and Walton goes on the back foot to swat across the line and connects very well. Sends it over the midwicket boundary"
"<b>Pollard's getting some of his own medicine</b> round the wicket, on the stumps and he shimmies down and heaves across the line to go over square leg"
"<b>take that!</b> Pollard goes for the retaliatory bouncer, and Walton calmly moves inside the line, transfers weight back, and pulls it to the square leg fence. Super shot"
"slower ball, squirted to cover"
"bouncer, he takes a few steps down the track and tries to play a tennis forehand almost. Only gets it to mid-off - they run for the single. Direct hit and he would have been gone, but the fielder missed"
"<b>smacked</b> Walton's enjoying himself. Too short from Jordan and it just sat up to be hit, and he duly obliged, pulling it into the audience at deep midwicket"

"too full and driven fluently, but there is a man on the cover fence"

"length ball outside off, punched to cover"
"good length, quick ball at 147 kph on the stumps. No room for Walton to free his arms, he just jabs it into the offside"
backed away but Wahab followed him. Couldn't control it though and it ends up as a full toss above the waist. Just above but it'll be a no-ball and free hit. Delport managed to get it away to deep square leg
"beauty. Quick ball back of a length and moving slightly away from Walton. If you're bowling a free hit ball, then you should bowl it at 151 kph!"
"good length again on the stumps and this was 148 kph. Walton unable to have the time to swat these, nor the room. Just pushed into the offside"
"good length outside off, he's happy to stroke it gently to cover"

"back of a length again, gets it to bounce a bit, Walton rides the bounce to cut it to the man on the point fence"
"<b>the pressure has consumed Delport</b> He was struggling to get it away, and looking to swat across the line.

"length ball, jabbed into the offisde"
"tried to bowl it wide of off stump and out of Walton's reach, but ends up being a wide."
"quicker bouncer outside off, Asif Ali tempted to go for the shot but misses"
"<b>he's nicked him behind</b> Pollard was thought of as the 'weak link' in today's attack, but he's made a key strike. Asif Ali can hit them big, but he won't be doing that today. Back of a length on off stump, this was more at Pollard's normal pace and Asif was a touch too early into the shot. Ends up feathering a top edge that has been pouched safely."

"short ball on the stumps, he transfers weight back to pull it to deep square leg for one run"
"short ball, coming into him from outside off. Pulls it to deep square leg off an under-edge. The ball not travelling fast means they can run hard and get two runs"
shimmies down the track but Mills shortens his length a bit and he can only bunt it to deep square leg for another couple
"<b>picks out the man at deep midwicket</b> Walton had to go for it, but he's been outfoxed by the bowler here. Slower ball, slightly back of a length outside off. The length made Walton go for the pull, but the pace meant he was too early into the shot, and ends up hitting it down deep midwicket's throat. That's surely curtains for Islamabad. Good catch too, with Gul running in because it was hit flat and sliding in front to take the catch"
"back of a length on the stumps, he taps it into the legside off the back foot"
tickled fine but Mills dives to his right to field the ball
"back of a length, he goes back to pull it. No pace on the ball so he has to generate the power himself. Doesn't do it nearly well enough, but gets a single to square leg"
"ooh that's unexpected but very welcome for Islamabad. Very wide outside off and he gets the chance to free his arms, times it very well to send it over cover for a six"

"full ball outside off, he was giving himself room and looking to loft it over the bowler, but doesn't connect"
"fullish on the stumps, backs away again and slashes it, and finds the middle of the bat to send it past point for four"
"leading edge, but falls short of fine leg. Mills opts to play safe and stay behind the ball to prevent the boundary rather than go for glory with a dive forward. Full ball, and he wanted to swing it to the legside, but got the leading edge"
"<b>that's massive</b> a bit short, and Faheem latches on to it. Rocks back and pulls it in front of square. Though where he pulled it didn't matter, because he he it so hard it was way over the top and well into the crowd"

"slower ball, back of a length just outside off and ballooning through to the keeper. Just 113kph, from the back of his hand"
"full and fast just outside off, and this has soared into Kamran's gloves. Shadab swings across to the leg side once again, but cannot get the connection"
"<b>remarkable over, man!</b> Back of a length, wide outside off, and he tries to slap a cut. Misses again"
"short outside off, and slapped to Sammy at cover. He doesn't take the single, so that Faheem can be on strike next over"
"<b>taken at deep midwicket</b> full ball on the stumps, and he picked up nicely off his toes, but sent it in the air and straight to the fielder. Faheem's resistance comes to an end, and so do any faint hopes Islamabad may have had"
"full on off, swings hard at it, but gets a thickish inside edge to deep square leg"
"digs it in short and quick, too much for Sami, who backs away and tries to pull but doesn't connect"
"well timed, but straight to Pollard at long-on. Full ball on off, and this was hit straight back over the bowler, pleasing follow through and shape - but not enough power. Pollard didn't move a millimetre, just stayed where he was and cupped the ball around head high"
"full and straight on the pads, rolls away to short fine"
"yorker length on a fifth stump line, he goes for an ambitious hoick, but connects only with air"
"full and well wide of off stump, but within the tramlines. The batsman doesn't connect"
"this is all ending quickly. Shadab's miserable stay comes to an end with a spooned catch to cover. He goes for a duck, having not managed to play a single convincing shot in his stay. This was a full ball, and he wanted to go straighter, but couldn't connect well at all"
"pacy ball outside off, on the seventh stump. Poke and a miss"
"full and wide of off again, Rumman stretches his bat and manages to toe-end the ball past the bowler"
"full, fast, on the fifth stump. No chance the batsman had to connect, especially a proper tailender"
"speared this into the stumps, but a bit too far down leg and it takes the pad to roll away to short fine. Wahab wasn't happy with himself, think he wanted to bowl it at the stumps and sneak through the gate, after having bowled full and wide earlier."
"length ball, he swings across the line and manages to just get it over the straight fence. Chris Jordan at the boundary caught the ball, and tried to parry it back in because he was going over the ropes with the momentum, but couldn't do it in time, and it's a six. Okay scratch that, the umpires have just signalled it's not a six. Perhaps because Jordan was able to throw the ball back into the field of play when airborne? Not sure though"
""
"Hasan Ali misfields at deep midwicket and allows a four. Too casual from Hasan, because he knows his team have won this, but Pollard's looking daggers. It's his bowling figures that are being affected. Hasan throws up a hand in apology"
"Swatted into the offside that time, and Wahab tumbles to his left and dives to save the boundary"
"fullish outside off, swings and misses"
"hah, Pollard's taking the mickey. Bowls a loopy slower ball as the final one, and the batsman just watches it go through. That's that, and Peshawar have won by 48 runs. They will meet Quetta Gladiators in the final, where a new champion will be crowned because Islamabad United haven't been able to defend their title. Good campaign by them, even if the last defeat was insipid"
