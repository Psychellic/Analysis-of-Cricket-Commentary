"outside off, and he drives it away towards extra cover"
"<strong>gone! No honeymoon homecoming for Dhoni!</strong> Full ball, and he looks to swing this down the ground, and inside-edges it on to the stumps. There's stunned silence at the JSCA Stadium, and the crowd just about begins to realise what has happened as he walks back towards the pavillion. This was breezy, but all too brief from MS Dhoni. More importantly, just brings a bit more pressure to bear on Virat Kohli, who is batting beautifully at one end"

"fuller ball, and he tries to sweep. Gets hit on the pads, and Zampa appeals, but it would probably have struck him outside off"
