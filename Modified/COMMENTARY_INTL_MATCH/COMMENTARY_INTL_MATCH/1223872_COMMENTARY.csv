"full, a bit of shape in towards off stump, clipped to the left of midwicket and he's off the mark"
"lovely, length ball, threatens to swing back in briefly but ends up simply continuing its journey across the left-hander. Leaves it alone, playing a shadow defensive shot inside the line"
"fuller now, just outside off, and Harris gets a good stride forward to push into the cover point region"
"on the fullish side of a good length, slanting away from off stump, left alone"
"back of a length close to off stump, stabbed into the short cover region"
"gone, Siraj strikes in the first over, and Warner is gone playing an uncertain shot. Beautiful length and line, slanting across and ending up tight on off stump. I don't know if it's seamed away, or if it's just kept going with the angle with the batsman playing for swing into him. Warner has a feel for it without really getting a stride to the ball, and second slip dives in front of first to take an outstanding low catch. A little bit of away seam, and Rohit has taken a blinder, diving to his right"
"good ball to start, fullish, swinging away in the corridor, left alone"
"looks to go straighter, back of a length, ends up sliding it well down leg side. He's overstepped too."
"length ball straightening towards off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"shortish, a bit of swing, but starts too wide to make Harris play"

"length ball on off stump, gets nicely behind it and blocks it back to the bowler"
"fuller, much wider, swings away quite considerably but it starts too wide to make Harris play"
"outswing in the corridor, left alone. Perhaps a touch shorter than the length that might have made Labuschagne play at it"
"a little fuller, gets that lovely away shape again in the corridor. Left alone"
"looks to get his line slightly straighter after those two leaves, and ends up a little too straight with the ball refusing to swing. I don't know whether he got any bat on that leg-side tuck, but there's certainly thigh pad on its way to the fine leg boundary"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"length ball angling into middle and off, defended to midwicket"
"full, swinging away in the sixth-stump channel, left alone"

"back of a length on off stump, defended towards that wide mid-on/straight midwicket fielder again"
"nice carry through to Pant, who takes it over his shoulder with fingers pointing up, after Harris leaves one outside off. Leaves it on length as much as line, because this was pretty close to off stump"

"length ball angling into off stump, blocked back to the bowler"

"full, angling into middle and leg, clipped to long leg"
"slants the first one away from off stump, and Labuschagne leaves it alone. Decent length, but not full enough to bring the batsman forward"
"nicely bowled, this one does bring Labuschagne forward. Leaves it again, but it's a testing length and angle. Perhaps some late swing just before it reaches the keeper too"
"full, at the stumps, punched back to the bowler who dives to his left to stop it in his follow-through"
"back of a length, slanting away from off stump, left alone"
"ooh, good ball. Similar length to the previous one, but the line is closer to off stump, and it may have seamed away off the deck too. Watched well and left well"
"short, slanting away and offering width too, but there's too much bounce for Harris to connect with the cut. Had to reach for it too"
"length ball, pitching around off stump and continuing with the angle across. Left alone"
"back of a length on off stump, gets on top of the bounce and defends with soft hands, into the off-side V"
"length ball slanting away into a wide line outside off, left alone"
"good ball, testing line close to off stump, and with the inward angle and the length, he's not sure whether to play or leave. Gets on the front foot and makes a late decision to leave, and leaves his bat close enough to the line for the ball to hit the inside edge and <strong>nearly ricochet into his stumps</strong>"
"back of a length, angling into the stumps, gets across and tucks it to long leg"
"length ball slanting into the corridor outside off, left alone"
"nicely bowled. Slanted across again, perhaps a little fuller than the previous ball, and this one nips away off the seam. He's mid-shuffle while he defends, but he plays close to the body and the ball rolls along the floor to gully off the outside half of the bat"
"full, slanting away from off stump, left alone"
"length ball, pitching just within the line of the stumps and continuing with the angle across. Left alone"
"length ball, leg-stumpish. Looks to work it into the leg side but gets tangled up with the angle and is hit on the thigh pad"
"length ball, slanting into the fifth-stump channel, left alone"
"and he strikes first ball! His 11th ball in Test cricket. Unusual dismissal, Harris flicks one off his legs, in the air, and straight to the man at square leg, stationed just in front of square. We'll have to watch that again to see if the ball did anything unusual, or if he just played a loose shot. Just seemed like an airy flick of fa pretty full ball that was swinging marginally into him. May have wanted to play that further in front of square?"
"fullish, swings away in the corridor outside off, left alone"
"full, angling down leg, and Smith shuffles too far across to be able to flick it"
"quite full, angling into the stumps, blocked back to the bowler"

"low full-toss, almost seemed like an attempted yorker on off stump. Punched firmly, but off the toe end of the bat, to the right of mid-off"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"good leave. Left that on length. Length ball, pitching within the stumps and angling away from Smith, and that wasn't too far wide of off stump, but bounced well over"
this one's fuller but the line's slightly wider. Leaves it again
"full, angling across to off stump, and Smith steps across to clip it wide of mid-on"
"back of a length, angling across the stumps. Shuffles across and tucks this wide of mid-on, having met it slightly outside off stump. Nicely played"

"back of a length, fairly wide of off stump, left alone"
"full outside off, a hint of away swing, so Labuschagne doesn't go with the full-blooded drive. Checked punch to short extra-cover"
"ooh, loose drive, <strong>play and miss</strong>. Not full enough for that at all, and a bit of away swing too. Quite wide of off stump, and that's what drew the stroke"
"back of a length, close to off stump, hits the deck hard and gets steep bounce. Left alone"

"back of a length, a little closer to off stump, leaves it again"
"length ball slanting away from off stump, left alone"
"full on off stump, and Smith drives through cover point. The length was full enough for it, but his weight wasn't fully forward and his bat turned in his hands on impact. May have wanted to hit that straighter"
"fullish, slanting across and finishing close to off stump, presses forward and blocks it back to the bowler"
"back of a length, angling across into the fourth-stump channel. Left alone"
"full on middle stump, clipped to the right of Saini, who fumbles at wide mid-on to turn a tight single into a comfortable two. Seemed to run in too quickly and almost overran the ball"

"back of a length, fairly wide of off, left alone"
"too full, on middle and off, and Smith likes it there, whips it away to the right of wide mid-on to pick up a crisp boundary"
"shot. Full again from Thakur, outside off this time, and this isn;t reckoned to be one of Smith's strong areas, but he gets forward and leans into the perfect drive through square cover"
"back of a length on leg stump, steps across and tucks it to the left of long leg"
"a bit of swing, but it starts faaaaar too wide to make Smith play"
"that goes a bit wrong! Short of a length, angled down the leg side, evades everyone including a diving Pant. To be fair, that might have hit a crack"

"full and straight, neatly clipped wide of mid-on"
"full at off stump, 134kph, defended on the front foot"

"a rare short ball, around leg stump, pulled down to fine leg"
"back of a length outside off, 138kph, left alone"

tucked backward of square on the leg side

"he plays back, works a straight delivery to the leg side"

back of a length close to off stump. Hops to ride the bounce and defend into the gully region
"appeal for lbw as Labuschagne misses a flick, playing around his front pad a little. Not the most vociferous shout. Possibly going over the stumps"
"fullish, angling into off stump, maybe some late inswing too. Clipped away through forward square leg. Everything's nice and comfortable until there's a bit of relay fielding on the  boundary, and a slight mix-up between the two batsmen, but the first throw goes to the keeper's end when the other end may have possibly caused some alarms. In the end they pick up an all-run four"

"short on off stump, gets up to just over waist high, and that presents no problems for Labuschagne, who swivels on his back foot to pull it between square leg and the square-leg umpire"

"back of a length just outside off, gets on his toes for a push to the left of extra-cover"
"full, angling in towards off stump, blocked towards mid-on"

Not the most dangerous-looking delivery, full and almost fired into the pads, but Smith flicks uppishly, and straight to the fielder at short midwicket. He's utterly cross with himself as he walks back to his dressing room"

"<b>dropped!</b> By Rahane of all people, at gully. Back of a length close to off stump, and it takes off out of nowhere as Labuschagne goes back and across to defend. Thick edge high on the bat, and it pops straight into Rahane's hands at waist height, and then pops straight out"

"super shot. He's been alert to any chance of Washington dropping marginally short. Skips back, makes plenty of room, and punches to the left of mid-off. No one in the covers, because the field is so leg-side oriented"

"length ball outside off, left alone"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"full, there's plenty of width here, and Labuschagne gets his head on top of the ball to drive to the left of mid-off"
"stays back to a fairly full ball angling across to off stump, defends with soft hands. He's expecting swing into him, but it just goes with the angle, and it hits the outside half of his bat"

"goes a little wider and gets the ball to swing away, but the line allows Labuschagne to leave with ease"
"lovely, lovely shot. Not a half-volley, it's full and angling into off stump with just a hint of shape away, and he just shows it the full face and sends it racing away between the umpire and the non-striker"

"strays onto the pads again, and Wade clips to deep square leg"
"shot. Length ball outside off, and he's seeing it well enough to drive on the up now. As he well should, to go from 97 to 101, placing the ball into the gap between cover and mid-off. It's an all-run four, a super shot to bring up an excellent hundred. He's ridden his luck, but India have looked increasingly short of ideas against him"
"length ball outside off, punched to cover"
"back of a length, angling into the body and tucking up Wade, defended to midwicket"
"back of a length close to off stump, just lets it come on and punches on the up through cover point"
"gone, and Wade gives it away with an aggressive shot yet again. First wicket for Natarajan, and India desperately needed it. Wasn't short enough to pull, maybe, and the ball hurried onto Wade and cramped him for room. Ends up scooping it up rather than hitting it with a flat bat-swing, and the ball goes high, behind the bowler, where both mid-on and mid-off converge towards the ball. Mid-on manages to catch it just as the two fielders' paths cross, with the collision somehow averted. Shaw was the fielder at mid-off, and he just about stepped out of the way as Thakur got under the ball. Natarajan also seemed to be going towards the ball for a moment."

"fuller still, and again he gets a nice stride into the ball to drive to the right of mid-off, left elbow high. This time it goes all the way"

"full, fairly wide of off, driven wristily to short cover"
"shortish, angling into off stump, pulled to the left of deep square leg"
"overpitched outside off, and Labuschagne goes a touch too hard at this drive, and ends up leaning back as he hits it. Sliced to backward point - he was probably aiming to hit through the covers"
"the Natarajan short ball strikes again! He nailed a pull earlier this over off a not particularly short ball, and a similar response to a similar delivery ends up as a top edge on this occasion. Goes high in the air behind the wicket, and Pant jogs a few yards to his left to pouch it. The ball was only around waist-high, and Labuschagne ended up over-adjusting and hitting from down to up"

"length ball angling into middle stump, clipped to midwicket"
"beaten. Length ball outside off, not full enough for the cover drive. Goes at it with an angled bat and it zips past his outside edge"

Rohit steps out and is soon realising he won't get to the pitch of this. Reaches well in front of his body and sticks with the lofted shot on his mind, but all he can do is lob it up for the fielder running in and to his right.

Not full enough to drive, slanting into a wide line outside off, and he goes hard at it, well away from his body, and gets a thick edge once again. This time, though, Starc has a fourth slip in place, and he catches it at just above chest height. Not the wisest of shots from Rahane especially with the slips cordon strengthened"

It didn't go in cleanly, but he held the rebound"

"bouncer, angling in over off stump. Drops down on his knees while swaying his upper body away from the line, keeping his eye on the ball all the way through. Excellent technique"

"a bit fuller, fifth-stump line, gets on the front foot and leaves it alone"
"wow. That's full, almost driving length, and Thakur is a little slow getting on the front foot to drive through mid-off. It hits the seam and straightens exaggeratedly to beat the bat"
"back of a length, angling too straight, easily glanced off the thigh pad to the fine leg boundary"
"wow, he's getting the new ball to do a lot off the surface. Back of a length in the corridor, and this one jags back in like an offbreak. Thakur looks to hurriedly bring his bat down in defence, and <strong>gets an inside edge</strong> on it, and it flies past Paine too quickly even as he throws himself to his left. Juuust out of his reach. Definitely hit a crack"

"length ball angling into off stump, defended to that fielder at wide mid-on. Not much of a stride forward, just gets his head over the ball and plays slightly around his front leg"
"big appeal for lbw as this nips back in and catches Thakur on the crease while defending. Bruce Oxenford isn't interested, and Australia decide not to refer after having a think about it. Gets half-forward and gets a thin inside edge on it"
"swings and misses. Fullish, outside off, a hint of away swing, and Thakur goes for an airy drive on the up and misses"
"length ball slanting across to the top of off stump. Defends without really moving his feet, and the ball rolls towards gully off the outside half of the bat"
"full on off stump, good stride forward to punch towards mid-off"
"ooh, beauty. Length ball, slanting across and finishing close enough to off stump to force Washington to play. Gets half-forward to drive through mid-off, and the ball seams away and beats his outside edge"
"back of a length close to off stump, punched towards point"
"ooh, that's an <strong>awkward short ball</strong>. Doesn't get up as high as Sundar thinks it will, and it also keeps coming back into him against the angle. Somehow drops to his knees and sways far enough away from the line to evade it"
"length ball slanting across to off stump, defended with an open face into the point region"
"length ball angling into off stump, good stride forward to defend towards point"

"short of a length, down the leg side, Sundar moves across and misses his flick"
"back of a length outside off 149kph, defended towards point...that might be Starc's quickest ball of the match"

"good length at the stumps, manages to defend this somewhat unconvincingly"
"a bouncer over off stump, left alone...Cummins is appealing and <strong>Australia have reviewed!</strong> Cummins and Wade are sure they heard a sound. Erm, well, think less said about that the better. There is a whole zip code between the ball, bat and glove"

"goes down early and tries to paddle-sweep this from well outside off, gets a top edge into his helmet"
"<strong>it's a no-look six! </strong>Goes down on his back knee and slog-sweeps this, but with an almost straight bat, over deep midwicket. Extraordinary shot. We've seen those from Andre Fletcher in the BBL"
"lucky runs for Saini, as he ducks into a bouncer from Cummins without really keeping his eye on it. His hands go up as a reflex act of self-protection, and the ball hits the shoulder of his bat and loops up over gully"
"another quick bouncer over off stump, and Saini falls away from the line - literally - to avoid it"
"short, rising ball in the corridor, does well to leave it without leaving his bat or gloves in the way"
"somehow gets out of the way of another sharp bouncer. He was stepping away to the leg side but also trying to jab at the ball, and he's lucky not to have got any glove on it"
"length ball outside off, left alone"

"length ball on middle stump, defended back to the bowler"
"back of a length on off stump, makes a bit of room to try and punch it through cover point, but the fielder at short cover dives to his right and stops it"
"bouncer, slanting across Sundar. He thinks about leaning back and ramping it over the slips, but pulls out of the stroke because it's bounced too high"
"short, angling into the body and bouncing just above waist-high over leg stump. Saini was trying to back away and finds the ball following him. Jams his bat down and manages to squeeze it down to third man"
"back of a length, slanting across to off stump. Looks to punch down the ground without really moving his feet, and it straightens and hits inside edge, then onto thigh pad"
"back of a length on off stump, lets it come to him this time and punches to mid-off"
"<strong>lucky</strong>. Banged in short, and Sundar was trying to sway away from the line, but the ball didn't get up as high as he expected and hit him on the left shoulder. Then it bounces onto the pitch and rolls backwards, and doesn't miss off stump by much, but Washington looks so nonchalant as if nothing happened"
"another bouncer, this time gets up steeply over the stumps and Washington ducks under it"
"shortish at the hip, looks to tuck it away and the ball lobs briefly in the air towards leg gully, but doesn't get to the fielder. Not sure if there was any bat on it, or just thigh pad"
"bouncer, rising high over off stump, ducks under it while mostly keeping his eyes on the ball"
"length ball close to off stump, blocked ceremoniously to short extra-cover, front foot in position long before the ball had arrived"
"shortish on off stump, hops up to ride the bounce and plays it close to his body, if in ungainly fashion, to ensure the ball stays down on its way to gully"
"gone, Hazlewood's got his man. Again that short, rising ball that isn't quite a bouncer. No option of ducking or swaying here, the ball kept following him even as he tried to stay leg-side of the ball, and climbed towards the shoulder of his bat to find the edge to second slip"
"wow. Assumed correctly that he'd get a short one first up, and it was a similar ball to the one that got Saini, ut Siraj has stepped away to the leg side to make himself room, and he cuts it in the air, deliberately, over the point region"
backs away again and Hazlewood follows him with a back-of-a-length ball. Carved away over the cover region without quite middling it
"back of a length outside off, and that's excellent from Sundar, taps it towards deep point, but doesn't hit it too hard, and calls immediately for two because the fielder has to come in a long way off the rope"
"short, angling down leg, can't connect with the flick off the hip"
"short ball gets up to just above chest height on off stump. Rides the bounce with both feet off the ground and defends with soft hands, right by his feet"
"ooh, a bit of late inswing as Starc fires in a middle-stump yorker. Watches it carefully and jabs it back to the bowler"
"gone, another excellent catch from Green at gully. Good ball from Starc, short and angling sharply into Washington. Got caught in two minds, between swaying away and trying to ramp it over gully, ended up doing the latter without a whole lot of conviction, and Green dives to his left to complete the catch. Superb innings on debut, he's brought the deficit down to 41. He's just 21, and there's so much time for him to expand on his sound batting and bowling fundamentals"
"greeted by a short ball first up, at his body. Backs away, almost turns his back on the ball, and offers a single-handed jab at it. Manages to keep it out and keep it down"
"good thinking from Siraj, steps across to the off side this time, looking to hoick the shortish off-stumpish ball towards fine leg. Can't connect, however"
"yorker just outside off, makes a lot of room and stabs it to deep point"
half appeal for caught behind after Natarajan backs to the leg-side and pokes at a rising ball over off stump. Went past his glove
"off the mark! Shortish on off stump, makes room and plays a tennis forehand to the left of mid-off"
"short over off stump, backs away to the leg side and swings mightily across the line, can't connect"
"shot. Not off the middle, but these are important runs. Makes a lot of room again, and Hazlewood goes to a fuller length on off stump. Scooped over mid-off, and they run two. Leaves Natarajan on strike for the next over, though"
"short, rising steeply over off stump. Backs away again, has a swish at it, and misses"
"short again, angling further in towards his elbow, manages to fend at it and keep it down in front of short leg"
"back of a length close to off stump, backs away and tries to stab at it, can't connect"
"short, angling down leg, jumps across and manages to get out of the way"
"full now, at the stumps, and Natarajan keeps his eye on it and jams his bat down to keep it out. Inside edge into pad"
"another yorker, this time it tails in late and hits low down on the front pad. Appeals, but not with a lot of conviction, because it's going down leg"
"shot! Gets leg-side of the bouncer and keeps his eye on it, manages to make contact with the ramp and it goes over the slips, too fine for third man to do anything about it"
"off-stump yorker, makes a lot of room and slaps it to deep point. Decides to keep the strike himself, which makes sense now."
"now he steps to the off side to try and swat the short, off-stump ball towards fine leg. Second time he's tried it in two overs. The idea is right but again he fails to connect"
"bowled him. Hazlewood gets his five-for. Full, at the base of leg stump, and Siraj backs away, has a big slog at it, and misses"
"full, slanting away from off stump, left alone"
"back of a length, angling across to off stump, hops across and defends into the on side"
"back of a length on off stump, defended to short cover"
"fuller now, slanting into a wide-ish line outside off, inviting the drive. Left alone"
"full, down the leg side, can't connect with the flick"
"length ball angling away from off stump, left alone"
"Fullish, finds some swing away from Warner, but starts too wide to make him play. Similar start to the first innings"
"and again, swing away from the left-hander, but the initial line is a little too wide to make him play"
and again. He needs to get closer to off stump to get that swing to bother Warner
"too wide once again. Impressive swing and carry, but he's not found his radar yet"
"full, fifth-stump line, a bit of swing, Warner gets a big stride out and pushes into the covers. Thakur runs to his right from extra-cover/wide mid-off, picks up, spins, and throws at the non-striker's end, and a direct hit could have had the diving Warner in trouble. Nervy-looking single"
"back of a length outside off, left alone. Some swing on this one too"
"length ball, pitching on or around off and slanting away, left alone"
"and again, good line if you're looking to play on the patience of a team that wants to force a win. Pitching just outside off and continuing to slant away, asking the batsman if he wants to drive away from his body. Left alone"
"just a touch short on off stump, and Warner pounces, meeting the ball well in front of his body to pull wide of mid-on"
"shot. Length ball close to off stump, and he gets his weight forward, moving into a firm push to the left of mid-off"
"hat-trick of fours. Short, just outside off, but that's enough width for Warner, deft hands to cut it between gully and point"
"back of a length, angling into off stump, defended to midwicket"
"length ball, curling away in the fifth-stump channel, left alone"
"length ball straightening towards off stump, good stride forward to block into the on side of the pitch"

"yikes, that's smacked him on the helmet. We're beginning to see the first signs of the inconsistent bounce we saw yesterday. Bouncer, and it  doesn't get up quite as high as Pujara expects. It's quick too, and he's got both feet off the ground and is in no position to duck out of the way. Hits the left side of his helmet, towards the back.

"full at off stump, 137kph, defended"
"hint of shape in at the stumps, full length, blocked"
"on the pads, pushed through square leg"
"comes down the pitch as he does so often, played back to Lyon"
"nicely timed off the pads as he flicks through square leg, too straight from Lyon"
"that's a good line, just outside off, hint of turn and defended"
"this one grips, from around off stump, he does well to keep it down in front of short leg"
"<strong>he's done it! Gill goes for 91</strong>. That's lovely bowling from Lyon. A wider line outside off, draws a drive from Gill away from his body, takes the edge and a neat catch at slip by Smith. Superb innings, but is that the moment for Australia?"
"past the edge! A lovely delivery. Short of a length, starts to come back and then holds its line off the seam"
<strong>painful! </strong>That's really hurt Pujara. This bounces from short of a length. He drops the bat and is in trouble here. The ball straight into the bottom hand.

"short, angling down leg, steps across and lets it go past his back"

"tossed up on off stump, clipped to the left of mid-on, who's deep enough to allow the single"
"down the track comes Pujara, whips this from off stump to forward square leg"
"tossed up a little wider, steps out and whips it back to the bowler"
"nice length on off stump, good stride forward to block it back to the bowler"
nice flight wide of off stump and the ball jumps at Pujara as he steps out. Lifts his bat out of the way and lets it hit his thigh pad
"down the track, and Lyon goes up in appeal as Pujara plays a defensive jab and is beaten by turn to get hit on the pad. Was a long way down, and impact was just outside off by my reckoning, but what will the umpire say about the batsman's intent? It's been reviewed. <strong>No shot offered is what he says.</strong> I genuinely can't believe this. Bat does finish behind his pad, but the turn has genuinely beaten him. Ball tracking shows the ball bouncing over the stumps."
"short, angling down leg, gets up above shoulder height but the line allows Rahane to swivel and roll his wrists on top of the bounce to hook it down to the fine leg boundary"
"back of a length, angling into off stump, gets back and across to clip watchfully to short leg"
"full, angling into off stump, blocked to short cover"
"length ball close to off stump, lets it come on and steers behind point with soft hands"
"another blow. Banged in short again, and this one jags in sharply from outside off, leaving Pujara with nowhere to go. This hit the front of his helmet as he tried to sway out of the line, the ball just kept following him. He looks okay, but the physio's back on the field to have a look. The blow knocked the stem guard off his helmet"
"back of a length on off stump, defended to short extra-cover"
"a touch short, spinning in from wide of off, goes back to stab towards point"
"ooh, that's square turn as Rahane makes room to cut. Pitched wide of off stump, and it would have missed leg stump easily. Smacks into his back thigh. Big puff of dust where the ball hit the turf"
"back of a length, spinning in from just outside off, goes back to work it through midwicket"
"down the track to the tossed-up ball outside off, blocked back towards the bowler"
"down the track again, gets to the pitch of this off-stump ball and clips to forward square leg"
"goes well wide of off stump now, and Pujara can stretch out and kick it away without too much bother"
"shot. That's driven on the up. Fullish length ball, fifth-stump line, and he drives it through cover point. Slows down as it approaches the boundary with backward point and cover giving chase, but they run four anyway"
"length ball close to off stump, gets on the front foot to steer this behind point with an open face"
lucky. Looks to sway away from a short ball but leaves the bat pointing up. The ball ricochets off the edge and flies over the slips cordon
"length ball on off stump, defended to short extra-cover"
"short, rising over off stump. Gets on top of the bounce and drops it into the pitch with the softest of hands"

"down the track again, gets to the pitch of this and whips to square leg"
"just a touch short, no more, and Pujara rocks back in a flash and pulls firmly to the right of square leg. Opened up nicely at the hips to make himself room to free his arms"
"length ball on off stump, just a hint of shape in maybe, and Rahane stays on the back foot to defend right under his eyes"
"full, angling into middle stump, clipped wide of mid-on, calling twotwotwo immediately"
"ooh, that's a wafty drive from Rahane. Not quite full enough, wide-ish line, and he goes hard at it away from his body. Nips away off the seam to beat him"
"<strong>beaten again</strong>. This time the length is shorter, and he was looking to jab that away, square or behind square, with an open face"
"fullish outside off, gets on the front foot to push into the cover point region"
"short on off stump, gets up to shoulder height or thereabouts. Gets right behind it to defend with soft hands"
"wham. Rahane is looking to play his shots here, even after getting beaten twice last over. Down the track to a flighted ball on a straightish line, and just carts it with the spin over wide long-on"
"back of a length close to off stump, punched to the left of mid-off"
"appeal for a catch at short midwicket after Pujara steps out and fails to reach the pitch of the ball. Looks to flick, and I think the ball may have spun past his inside edge and lobbed up off the front pad. Yup, thats what happened."
"tossed up slower, not too far outside off, stretches out and defends with the turn towards short leg"
"down the track and Lyon bowls quicker and straighter. Lots of turn and bounce, and Pujara stretches out to meet it with pad. This one's turning down leg"
"flight again, and Pujara jumps out to meet it on an off-stump line and looks to whip to mid-on. Lyon dives to his right to intercept"
"back of a length, angling into off stump, steps across and tucks it through square midwicket"
"back of a length close to off stump, hops to defend it and then wrings his bottom hand after playing the ball. It hit the bottom of his bat and jarred his hand. <strong>Kept a bit low</strong>"
"bouncer over off stump, ducks under it"
"back of a length marginally outside off, and Pujara rocks back to punch through cover point. First time he's attacked Cummins by my reckoning"
"gone, the big man has taken the big wicket. Every time Cummins comes into the attack, you expect something to happen. Short ball, and it follows Rahane as he looks to sway out of the way. Caught in two minds, between leaving and ramping it over the slips, and he ends up caught behind with the ball grazing the face of his bat. He was looking to play his shots, and the risks were always apparent. Similar dismissal to the one at Ranchi against the same bowler back in 2017"
"ooh, dangerous. Length ball slanting away from off stump, and he has an open-faced poke at it. Off the outside half of the bat towards gully"
"a touch short, but lots of turn and bounce so Pujara has to defend despite shaping for the back-foot punch through the covers"
"a touch short again, the line is straighter, worked away through backward square leg"
"good ball, flight and dip outside off, and it's quick so Pujara can't get out of his crease. Presses forward to defend, and the inside edge runs away to the right of the short leg fielder"
"down the track now, clips this one from middle stump to midwicket"
"flat length ball spinning in from outside off, presses forward and clips towards square leg"

"flatter and quicker length ball on off stump, gets his front pad out of the way to block to short midwicket"
"down the track to the tossed-up ball on off stump, whips it to the right of the forward square leg fielder and sets off for a risky run. Sent back, wisely, and a better throw might have had him in trouble. Cummins' throw takes the keeper away from the stumps, though"

"flight and dip outside off, two steps out to block it back towards the bowler"
"banged in short, angling over the stumps, ducks down low to get under it"

"shortish, straightens a touch in the corridor. Jabbed towards gully with an open face"
length ball angling into off stump. Looks to get on the front foot to defend and the ball nips in off the seam and hits him high on the inside thigh. <strong>Ouch</strong>
"back of a length, angling into off stump, gets on top of the bounce and defends with soft hands, back down the pitch"
"back of a length, keeps a touch low as it angles in towards off stump. Keeps a close eye on it and defends with a straight bat. Hits low on the bat and rolls to short leg"

"nice start, good length outside off, holds the bat inside the line"
"<strong>given lbw!</strong> Cummins strikes second ball. Pujara has called for the <strong>review</strong>. A back of a length delivery which nipped back, beat the inside edge and took the back leg. Height the only issue. And it's umpire's call on trimming the bails"

"back of a length outside off, quickish, left alone. This is proper cat and mouse"
"fullish, angling into middle and off, punched to mid-off"
"shortish on off stump, hops to ride the bounce and defend down the pitch"
"a Cummins special produces a massive caught-behind shout, but the umpire isn't interested... Australia have reviewed here. Back of a length, straightening in the corridor with extra bounce, and Agarwal defends on the hop with an open face. There's nothing on Hotspot as the ball passes the edge, and nothing on Snicko either. Only one review remains for Australia."
"gone, caught at short cover, Agarwal is dismissed in the pursuit of quick runs. That wasn't quite up there for the drive, but Agarwal went hard at it, possibly looking to clear the fielder at short cover. Maybe the ball stopped on him, maybe he just didn't time it how he wanted to, but in any case, Matthew Wade times his jump well and takes it over his head"
"back of a length, at the hip, hops up and tucks it square on the leg side"
"back of a length, angling across to off stump, punched firmly back to the bowler"
"big slog. Lyon dangles a tempter outside off, from around the wicket, and he has a big swing at it and misses"
"back of a length, a bit wider, left alone"

"very full, a near yorker on off stump, pushed down the ground to long-off"
"tossed up outside off, and he stretches out to drive to mid-off. The fielder is deep enough to allow the single"
"this was coming. Good idea too, with the line outside off stump and the ball given some air. Brings out the reverse-sweep but can't connect on this occasion"
"shortish at the hip, tucked away through backward square leg"
"ooh, Cummins draws another airy drive. Fullish, slanting across, inviting the drive away from the body. Doesn't get his weight forward and the ball hangs briefly in the air but falls short of mid-off"
"length ball slanting across to off stump, swinging back slightly. Flicks on the bounce to that leg gully fielder"
"bouncer, angling across. Keeps his eye on it and evades it, and it swings late, after it passes the batsman"
"full, angling across to off stump, and that's a super shot. He played this shot so well in the first innings too, and he does it again, pressing forward and leaning into a straight-bat punch to the left of mid-off. Beautiful"
"bouncer, climbing steeply over leg stump, and Sundar keeps his eye on it, drops to his knees, and sways his upper body away from the line"
"back of a length and very wide of off stump, left alone"
"another swing and miss. Tossed up outside off, goes for the big sweep and misses, thanks to some extra turn and bounce. Slip has to dive to hsi right to stop it from running away for byes"
"short outside off, slapped to the man at short cover"
"phew, he sliced that in the air but it's fallen short of deep point. Tossed up wide of off stump, and Pant loses his shape looking to hit it over mid-off. Sliced high, but falls short of Green running in from the boundary"
"short outside off, cut to the left of point, who's come in off the boundary for Sundar"
"shortish, close to off stump, makes some room and cuts firmly to backward point"
"super stop from Lyon at backward point. It's short and angling away from off stump, and Sundar jumps to ride the bounce and cuts fiercely. Lyon throws himself to his right and saves four runs"
"shortish, gets up towards the ribcage, coming at Sundar from his blind spot outside leg stump. Does well to ride the bounce and keep it down into the backward square leg region"
"back of a length on off stump, blocked into the covers"
"full on off stump, driven firmly to mid-off. He wants the single but he's hit it a bit too firmly for that"
"short, at Sundar's ribs again. Hops to ride the bounce, looks to work it away, but can't middle it. Inside-edges into the ground by his feet"
"sharp short ball, rising steeply over Sundar's back shoulder. Thinks of pulling, decides against it and leaves it"
"Pant is getting a little edgy here. Loses his shape again while going for a big hit. Tossed up slow outside off, and there's sharp turn and bounce to beat the attempted loft over long-off"
"sharp turn again. Quicker, just outside off, and Pant is half-forward to defend. Zips past his outside edge"
"tossed up fuller now, and Pant plays a flat-bat drive to deep point"
"full, angling into leg stump, clipped firmly back to the bowler. Wanted to play that towards mid-on"
"shortish, close to off stump, makes room and chops to deep point"
"short, spinning away from off stump, cut past the man at backward point, out to third man"
"bouncer over leg stump, thinks about hooking but decides just in time to duck out of the way"
"full on middle and leg, clipped away quietly to long leg"
"length ball on off stump. Looks to drive on the up and it <strong>hangs in the air again</strong>, briefly, before falling short of mid-off"
"back of a length, slanting across to off stump, lets it come on and stabs to backward point"
"short, and Washington Sundar has just hooked Pat Cummins for six! That's an incredible shot, because it's up near his left shoulder, but he steps across, somehow swivels even though both his feet are off the ground, and hits it right out of the screws. Wow"
"length ball on off stump, and that's either very lucky or very clever, because he's gone hard at the drive, with an open face, and half-deliberately sliced it over the slips cordon"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"haha, that's just sensational. That's a quick length ball on off stump, and Pant has simply fallen across onto his back knee to scoop it over his shoulder and over the keeper. Outstanding. Rohan Kanhai played the falling sweep, this is the falling scoop"
"tossed up wide of off stump, and Pant has absolutely hammered that. A big stretch out, and a powerful sweep along the ground, in front of square"
"full, wide of off stump, reaches out and slaps it to deep cover point"
"wow, that went like a doosra, probably wholly unintentionally. Back of a length, outside off, and it's the offbreak but it's hit the outside edge of a crack and spun back the other way to miss off stump and beat the keeper"
"tossed up fuller, wide of off stump, big stretch out to get his head over the ball and drive to the left of deep cover point"
"fullish, angling across to off stump, presses forward and pushes to the right of short extra-cover. They take the quick single, and get a second when the underarm flick at the keeper's end runs away for overthrows"
"full on middle and leg, clipped away into the gap between long leg and deep backward square leg, and that's an easy two on this large outfield. This is smart cricket, and Australia are struggling to set a field to contain India now"
"length ball angling across to off stump, steps across and nudges it towards deep backward square leg"
"all the luck is going India's way now. Shortish, angling into off stump, and he steps across to pull, but it keeps a little low, goes under his bat, and pops up off the thigh pad, between slip and gully"
"full, angling into off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"and he produces a jaffa in the middle of all this. Length ball, angling in towards off stump and straightening off the pitch. Slices across it slightly in defence, and the ball beats his outside edge"
"tossed up wide of off, Pant steps out and reaches out for a sliced drive over the point region"
"shot. That's full outside off, and Sundar collapses his back knee to create extra room and play a square drive out to deep point"
"short outside off, keeps low and sneaks under the attempted cut"
"what a shot. That's tossed up very wide of off stump, and Pant somehow gets a big stretch out and uses his bottom hand brilliantly to whack a sweep out well in front of square, making deep square leg run a long way to his right to stop it"
"bowled him, you might ask if he needed to play that shot. Not much of a reaction from the Australia players, though, because India only need 10. He's played well, and he misjudges the line, possibly, while trying to reverse-sweep this. A little too close for him, and perhaps there's a bottom edge too, onto the stumps"
"back and across to defend a length ball spinning in from outside off, meets it right under his eyes"
"short, angling down leg, and Pant swivels to pull and find the gap to the right of long leg. He falls onto his backside while doing so as well. He's played the falling scoop, now he's played the falling pull, and he's nailing everything out of the middle"
"six to win, goes for the glory hit. Fullish, angling into off stump, looks to slog it over midwicket, and ends up slicing it high over the backward point region. Ends up landing away from both deep point rushing in and cover running to his right. It's Pant's day"
"back of a length, angles into the pads, clips it away to long leg. The fielder didn't have too much room to cover to his left, but they sprint two anyway. Tired legs all over the field now"
"now Thakur lobs one straight in the air. This one falls into square leg's hands, though. India still need 3, and they have three wickets left. Back of a length, angling into off stump, and Thakur looks to work it across the line, only manages a leading edge"
"full, wide of leg stump, looks for the one-arm sweep and misses. Good use of the negative line from Hazlewood"
"full, angling across to off stump, and he's creamed that to the long-off boundary! To repeat the words of Tony Greig from 20 years ago, India have won the Test match, India have won the series, and this series has been as much of a fairytale as that one. Let me describe briefly.
