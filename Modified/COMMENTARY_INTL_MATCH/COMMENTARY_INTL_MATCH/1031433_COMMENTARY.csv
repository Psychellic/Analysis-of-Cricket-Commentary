"outside off and ... ooh, nearly another first-baller as this one jags in wickedly and just misses the off stump. Good leave in the end"
this one goes straight across and is met with a firm thunk through the covers. That came on very nicely... pleasingly ominous signs for a run-feast!
"extra nibble outside off, and beats a leaping cut"
"lovely sharp fielding from Morgan at point, leaping to his left to intercept a full-blooded cut"
"oops, that's a good old-fashioned nutmegging for Jordan at cover who lets a slap dip straight between his legs! Morgan's impact neutralised within one ball"
tight finish to a feisty over
"outside off, good lift off the deck, stabbed into the covers"
down the leg side. We'll have that one again
"back of a length, a slower ball. Pulled to backward point"
"on the pads, tucked to backward square"
"keeps the variations coming on the small-boundaried ground, back of a length and worked to mid-off"
"whoops, that was a back-of-the-hander, but it slipped out, well wide of off stump"
"punched off the back foot to mid-off. Good shot for none, as they say"
"cripes, another, err, slip. Jordan pulls out another variation, and he might as well have been pulling a pin on a wayward grenade. A loopy, lobbed, wide full toss outside off"
"in the slot, and tonked effortlessly over the bowler's head and into the Ian Botham stand. Not the ideal over ..."
"back of a length, tight to off stump, defended back up the pitch"
punched into the gap
"a stand-and-deliver slap from deep in the crease, no great timing and gathered at mid-on"
"nice shape off the pitch, curls round the edge"
tucked off the hip to square leg
"pushed into the gap, to keep the strike"
"liveliness first ball! Back of a length, an ambitious hoick across the line and had fine leg been back on the rope, that would have been straight down his throat!"
"wicket second ball! Back of a length again, an ambitious pull, a bottom edge into the timbers, and Curran is off and running, literally! Arms outstretched, he believes he can fly, and he jolly well can!"
"on the toes, tucked behind square"
"yikes, so nearly another chop-on! Fuller length, good pace, a loose angled swipe of the bat, and just past the leg stump"
"tight wicket-to-wicket line, nips back off the seam and into the pads. Going down"
"dabbed into the gap, what a lively start!"
"back of a length, hits the deck hard, defended on the back foot"
"leg-sided, tucked off the hip"
"hops across the crease, looking to work through square leg, but the ball gets big on him"
"lifting of the deck, challenging the diminutive Mosehle to rise onto his toes to counter the awkward length"
"pulled, not entirely comfortably, into the gap at midwicket"
tapped to mid-on and they set off for another sharp single
"jeepers! That was slammed back down the track, and umpire Michael Gough's left shin is very grateful for the intervention of the off stump at the non-striker's end! That was utterly travelling. All the way to the rope despite a massive and pin-saving deflection"
slightly less biffable length this time
tucked off the legs
"utterly panned off a good length. Mohsele was sitting back, waiting for the one in his slot, and that disappeared over midwicket with brutal power from his flexed forearms. And he's smashed his bat in the process!"
"goodness me, that's a good-looking stroke. Striding down the pitch, meeting a not-indifferent length with a bottom-handed biff over long-off"
"looking for the wind-up once again, but can't get this one away. Point tidies up"
"on the toes, tucked calmly to midwicket"
tucked to square leg off the back foot
"onto the pavilion roof! He's got hold of that one alright. Saw him coming, and held back the length, but through came those forearms and South Africa are cooking now!"
"better length, pushed back to the bowler"
"on the off stump, chiselled to leg"
"punched on the up from under the eyeline, gathered at midwicket"
"wow, that was a vicious lifter! Mohsele hasn't looked comfortable against the bouncer, and he wore this one flush on the fingers, as he bailed out with his stance opened wide. And he's broken another bat in the impact!"
"bangs it in again, I don't think Mohsele will get many in his half from big Liam. Uncomfortably flinched to backward square"
"slower ball, pulled off a bit of top-edge, out to deep midwicket. Lands safe, but Plunkett is in the hunt"
"slower ball bouncer, a terribly muffed pull from Mohsele who was utterly braced for an exocet, and completely suckered by the powder-puff pace. The ball barely carries through to Buttler, and that's the end of an intermittently violent and timorous innings"
"crunched out to the deep, a calm drive from deep in the crease"
"up on the toes, pushed to the sweeper once more"
"reverse sweep, decent connection"
looking to drive but not quite to the pitch
"on the toes, tucked to square leg"
""
"clears the front leg, looking to haul a pull through midwicket."
"keeps low and tweaks a touch, beats a back-foot slap"
"short, pulled, one hand comes off the ball as the ball sails through midwicket. Lovely timing"
"down the track, and dirty runs from AB, a mistimed wipe as Plunkett saw him coming and speared it wider. No cutting that off, a thick edge through third man"
"slower ball, wristily worked to leg"
"banged in short, sharp pace, but down the leg side"
"on the pads, worked to leg"
"full toss, and slapped through midwicket. Loose and punished"
"outside off, and a helicopter round-house full-blooded mow of a slap over the covers. Sweet connection from a massive wind-up, and it plops into the stands!"
"drawn down the pitch, can't time it away"
"gives himself room, makes it into a long-hop, and slammed through the covers"
"ooh, that sounded good, like a 21-gun-salute of champagne corks, as it fizzes over midwicket and into the stands"
works the single to rotate the strike
"makes room again, Dawson follows him, and a cramped pull ends up at midwicket"
"a lollipop to backward square leg! The full toss surprised Smuts, who seemed to have decided on the destiny of that shot before the ball reached him, and Plunkett backpedals to pounce a simple top-edge"
worked off the pads
drops the wrists and steals the single
a wafty drive to deep cover
"a big waft outside off, but beaten by the extra bounce. Hit the seam nicely there"
"gave himself room, and beaten by a sharp delivery outside off"
"on the pads, worked to square leg"
"biffed down the ground (definitely a biff that time) but not quite timed, bounces short of long-on"
"plants the front foot, swept powerfully over backward square. Shot"
works the single
chopped hard into the covers
"on the pads, picks a good gap at midwicket and turns for the second as two fielders converge"
"on the back foot, pushed to cover"
"back of a length, awkwardly shovelled into the leg side, looking for the pull but cramped by the line"
"slower ball once again from Plunkett, and a thin edge to the keeper! He's used that ball so cannily today, and Miller is livid not to have picked it. A big ambitious wipe of a cut shot and Buttler does the rest"
"outside off, punched to cover"
rolls the wrists on a dabbed cut to third man. Good leaping bounce outside off
crunched through the covers. That was a sweet piece of timing. Only fractionally over-pitched
"good fierce lift from a full length, pushing de Villiers back into the crease"
worked to leg
"into the river! Down on one knee, out comes the trademark de Villiers mow over the shoulder for six, stepped way outside off and timed the pants off it. We saw that shot endlessly in his 31-ball hundred at Jo'burg. Ominous signs when that comes out..."
"oh well ... de Villiers is gutted, he thought he was cutting loose, but this one soared high into the sky, a mistimed slog from a full length ball, and Morgan steadies himself in the covers to pouch a vital catch"
"full and straight, Behardien heaves at it, gets a thick inside edge on to his front pad"
"slightly back of a length, Morris swivels on a pull out to deep midwicket top get off the mark"
"length on the pads, clipped calmly through square leg for a single to finish the over"
"fired in at the body, scooped through backward square leg, in the air but wide of the man on the edge of the ring"
"slower delivery, short and sitting up and thwacked without timing out to deep midwicket"
"short and again taking the pace off, pulled flat towards deep square leg for one more"
"ramps up the pace again, 88mph and right up in the blockhole, squeezed into the leg side and they come racing back as the throw is fired in, hitting Morrs on the pads as he regains his ground"
"short ball, stays back and pulled for one through square leg"
"pitched up, another slower ball, dabbed towards backward point"
"low full toss from Willey, aiming wide of the stumps to stop Morris targeting the leg side, flumped towards mid-off"
"here's Willey's knuckle-ball, floating out of the hand with nothing on it, like a badminton cock, up on the toes and Morris can't do anything with it"
"whipped leg side into the deep, Billings races in and keeps them to a single"
"length on the stumps, flicked behind square for one"
"goes full and wide, Behardien opens his shoulders and clubs in front of deep cover, firm connection and it bounces away"
"<b>dropped!</b> By Chris Jordan, of all people...! This was struck even more sweetly and <i>flew</i> towards mid-off, Jordan barely had time to react - in fact, he took a blow on the jaw, as it slipped through his hands!"
"pitched up and mullered down the ground, back over the bowler, four more for Behardien - pain of a different kind for Jordan"
"well bowled, good pace at 89mph and squeezed out for a single"
"top-edge, swung hard and it clears Buttler... although Willey then swoops in from leftfield and nearly takes a brilliant diving catch, having run from third man! Instead it bounces through him and away to the boundary"
"full and wide, maybe a slower ball, inside the tramlines and Morris misses out"
fired in full and wide... this time deemed too wide by the umpire
"<b>dropped!</b> This is a dolly, Livingstone shells it at deep midwicket, he immediately shows his frustration but Morris will continue... It was a full toss from Jordan that was clumped straight to the man in the deep, but it didn't stick"
"pitched up, driven wide of the bowler in his follow through, Jordan nearly gets a hand on it... and then mid-off has a chance to run out Behardien - but needed a direct hit!"
"low full toss to start with, shovelled down the ground for one"
"taken this time, does him with the slower ball! Curran's undercut is bobbing in the evening breeze again, it was nicely bowled, a back-of-the-hand slower ball and Morris top-edged an agricultural swipe towards mid-on, Roy holding a smart low catch running in"
"drops short and Behardien lands him on the Sky pod at deep midwicket! A Hail Mary blow, well over the ropes, bouncing on the roof of the mobile commentary box on its way"
pitched up and poked into the off side coming forwards
"timber! Bowled him with the yorker... Another for Curran, who's off once more on a celebratory dash. Too hot for Phehlukwayo, who may have been hoping for a sighter first ball but in the event couldn't get his bat down in time as the ball thudded into off stump"
"pitched up and clipped nonchalantly off the pads - although they choose not to run, keeping Behardien on strike"
"full and straight, Behardien swings himself in circles but can't get anything worth running for"
misses the yorker... and Behardien nails it into the crowd at deep backward square leg! This was a filthy full toss from Jordan and the batsman wiped it dismissively beyond the ropes
"pitched up outside off, drilled into the covers"
"Jordan continues to come back well, full and wide, big ole swing and a miss from the batsman"
"gone, that's plumb! Ugly heave across the line from Behardien, the ball arrowing in on middle and leg, Jordan picks up a wicket and South Africa's finish continues to fizzle"
"pitched up and slapped in no-nonsense fashion over cover for four, Paterson rounds the innings off with a boundary and England will need 175 to take the series"
"short of a length, sliding on to the hip and Roy calmly flips it through backward square for one to get going"
"length outside off, 88mph and Billings gets his head over it in diligent defence"
"this rears at Billings as he comes forward, fended away to the leg side off the body for one"
"Roy backs to leg, swings hard at a rising ball, 85mph but it seems to zip through with extra lift and beats the bat on its way through to the keeper"
"chipped down the ground, going deep in the crease, lifted without timing but it clears Shamsi running back towards the rope for a couple"
"pitched up and slapped through the covers, making room to swing the arms again, mid-off runs across to cut it off"
"good pace in the channel from Morris, big yahoo from Roy, fails to connect"
shortish and swatted through midwicket for a couple
"Roy steps across early and Morris maybe spots it, tries to hit an exposed leg stump... but drifts too far and is called"
"full and straight and Roy swings to the on side, he was aiming much straighter but the bat turned in the hands and squeezed it away with plenty of force for a first boundary to deep backward square"
"touch short, Roy stays back and shovels one through midwicket"
"pitched up, 90mph and squeezed wide of fine leg for a couple"
"short outside off, top-edged as Billings tries to whip across the line - and taken! He tried to force that, hitting to the leg side but Morris' pace and line was enough to send the ball billowing up towards mid-off, where Miller took it well running across"
"pitched up and Roy swings for the hills... thick-edges past his stumps for four to fine leg! He wasn't looking back, in case he heard the rattle, but it flew past short fine leg and away"
"short ball, this time he pulls - and again gets a touch on it, beating Mosehle's dive to his left! Not where he was aiming, once again, but the same result"
comes across on off and defends
"that's a snorter from Morkel, dug in short and climbing like King Kong up the Empire State! No chance for Roy to connect"
"four more, this is carved through the leg side! Roy's quicksilver hands sending a fullish ball skittering to deep backward square"
"bit of width and spanked to the boundary at deep backward point! Roy connects his fours, four in the over, he's motoring nicely"
pitched up and Bairstow gets across on off to dink into the covers
"oof, that's well bowled, holding its line outside off, whizzes through as YJB stays back and prods at it tentatively (and unsuccessfully)"
"full length, comes forward to drive, no great timing and Morris fields in his follow through"
"good length, 88mph, YJB comes across on off, defended"
"yipes, that's another ripper, climbing past the outside edge from just back of a length. Bairstow may be in regal form but he's scratching around like a pauper at the moment"
"ah, there's the Midas touch again, just a shimmy forward and then drilled through the covers, off the mark with a pristine drive for four"
slides his first ball down the leg side
"drops short and this is battered through deep backward square, shifting across and helping the ball on its way to the fence"
"fuller, 87mph, comes on to the front foot, driven to cover"
"pitched up a little straighter, hits the pads and runs into the leg side... Roy and YJB nearly run into each other but avoid a mishap in the end"
"back of a length, Bairstow swishes it off his pads - and <i>just</i> clears the leap of Morkel at short fine leg! Frustration for Paterson but it's another boundary for England"
"short and wide, in Bairstow's arc but he clubs it to backward point"
"speared in full, that's a handy yorker and Roy jams his bat down on it"
"short ball, sits up in the pitch, Roy swats it to deep midwicket for one"
"full outside off, comes froward and punches a drive to extra cover"
"back of a length, hits the thigh pad as YJB swings across the line"
"slower ball, bowled into the surface, Roy waits on it and pulls in front of the boundary rider for a couple"
on the stumps and swung away into the leg side for one more
"length ball, 86mph and a touch straight, YJB jabs it behind square and Morkel does well to prevent it slipping past him"
"length in the channel, driven on the up, trickles into the covers without timing"
"banged in, 89mph from Paterson, climbs rapidly past the top edge as Roy skips down and attempts to flay over the covers"
pitched up and worked back past the bowler for one to long-on
"Paterson bends his back, nibbles away outside off as Bairstow goes back and throws his hands, failing to connect"
"skidding on from back of a length, steered down to third man"
"touch short, 87mph, Roy goes back and clouts a drive into the covers without timing and they jog through for one more - decent over from Paterson"
"dug in short and clubbed brutally through midwicket, a roundhouse sock to the chops, four more for Roy"
"length outside off, picked up through the covers for one"
"mind your ankles! That was lashed back down the ground, Bairstow smashing it on the up past Phehlukwayo, who was Lucky he hadn't followed through half a yard to his left"
"clubbed off a length back over Lucky's head this time, again it will run away! YJB thrums menacingly into life"
"sliding on to the pads, Phehlukwayo appeals for lbw... but Rob Bailey isn't interested. Looked like the flick of the pad just took it past leg stump, but may have been heading down anyway"
"slower ball to finish, stabbed into the covers"
"tossed up and he goes for the revers-sweep, gets a tad lucky with a top edge over the keeper for one"
"flighted, outside off, comes forward and pushes down the ground"
"backs away and slugs down the ground, well struck but long-on cuts it off"
"YJB shows him how to do it, hitting cleanly through the line and this time long-on hasn't a prayer"
"floated up on the legs, Bairstow picks his spot and lofts to wide long-on this time, into the gap and skipping gaily away with flowers in its hair"
"fired into the pads, nurdled square for one"
"length ball, carrying through over the stumps as YJB backs to leg and swings and misses"
"woosh, that's taken off! Over the horizontal bat, over the leaping Mosehle and away for four byes"
cracked all the way to the square-leg boundary! Just a touch short from Morkel but Bairstow snapped on it like a bear trap and smeared a flat Dorothy
"pitched up, 86mph and he has to dig it out for one"
"Roy goes deep in the crease and aims a deranged mow down the ground, fails to connect"
"full toss, sliding on to the pads, flicked uppishly through midwicket for a single to end another eventful over and leave England in the driving seat at halfway"
"pushed through flat from over the wicket... and how has that missed the stumps? Roy was backing away and it snuck through, into the keeper's pads"
"tossed up and Roy hits cover, no timing on the shot"
"flighted, gets forward and dinks one down the ground to long-off"
"pushed through flat outside off, YJB goes back and swats one through point"
"launched into the Ian Botham Stand, that's Roy's fifty! And the England 100, too... Given some air and Roy sauntered down to hit bruisingly through the line"
"touch short and he drops back, rifles a pull to deep midwicket, well stopped diving on the rope and they get two"
"fired in full on leg stump, that's one way to keep Jonny quiet"
"banged in short, YJB falls over as he goes to duck... but Morkel had flicked off the non-striker's bails and that will be a no-ball. Finn's Law (courtesy of Graeme Smith)"
"not a bad ball but it is lathered to the extra cover boundary, fearsome power from Bairstow - de Villiers was out there but couldn't cut it off!"

"length ball, rising sharply over the stumps at 87mph as Roy swings and misses"
"bit of width, that's a wristy flick from Roy, gets it fine of the diving short third man and away"

"Shamsi pushes the ball across, maybe the wrong'un, sliced behind point"
"flat on the stumps, Roy swivels on the pull to deep square leg"
tossed up and punched towards cover coming forwards
"flighted, Bairstow hits aerially down the ground, shouts of 'catch!' but it lands well short of long-on"
tossed up and driven firmly along the carpet to long-on this time
"floated up a touch leg side and YJB wheels it away past short fine leg, again Shamsi was interested in the catch but it zipped away to the fence in a flash"
full and straight and dug out into the off side
"back of a length, Roy gives himself room and swings hard, doesn't connect... and YJB thinks about running to the keeper before deciding that represents a needless risk"
"shortish, 86mph and swatted through midwicket on the pull"
"gottim, plinked to mid-on! Full and tailing in from Morris, YJB is a bit cramped and the bat turned in his hands as he attempted to hit down the ground, ends up chipping a simple catch to the edge of the ring"
"back of a length, hits the thigh pad as Livingstone stays back, lobs to the leg side and Roy sends him back early"
"shortish and on the body, this is helped away to the leg side for a couple more"
"pushed through outside off, Roy drops back and swings his arms off, gets one down the ground"
"floated up and Livingstone - Livo, for short - is down early to play a cute little scoop past Mosehle for a couple. We could see a few tricks here"
"pushed through in the channel outside off, swatted through point"
Roy drops back and twonks a single through mid-off
tossed up and worked into the leg side for one
"tossed up, Roy attempts to reverse-sweep, off the gloves to point"
"shortish outside off, dabbed down towards backward point... Livingstone declines the single and Roy is struck on the boot as he races back to his crease. SA immediately appeal for obstructing the wicket and they two standing umpires decide to send it upstairs to their colleague in the TV booth. He did turn and run across the pitch, he was looking at the thrower initially but then had turned his back by the time it hit him... Decision time for Tim Robinson: and he's given him out! Roy's not happy but the third umpire decided he deliberately ran in the path of the ball and is sent on his way for 67"
Livo comes forward and plays the ball on the up through point for a single
"good pace, 88mph, angling in and worked towards midwicket, Buttler has to throw himself back to regain his ground"
"pitched up and sliding on to the pads, deflected square for one"
"comes across, can't get it away, another dot for Morris"
"banged in short, Livingstone hooks and sends it to slip... off the shoulder? That's what Rob Bailey thinks, although Ultra Edge then suggests there may have been a sliver of a top edge involved. All going off!"
"short and sliding down the leg side, called"
"length outside off, Buttler steps into a smooth drive on the up in front of the sweeper for two"
"full, flicked off the pads, the Taunton faithful raucously cheer one of their own as it races away for Buttler's first boundary"
"full and straight and clipped through square leg, excellent running brings them a second"
"Paterson is bellowing out at lbw appeal here, was Buttler outside the line of off? Just about, I think, hit him on the boot and ran fine for one"
"full outside off, swing and miss from Livo... not really found his range yet"
"dug in back of a length, Livingstone swings frantically across the line, top-edged into the leg side for one, landing safely"
"bouncer to start with and Livingstone gets it away on the pull, top-edgey but it sails behind square and runs to the fence"
"pitched up in the channel, rubbery-wristed drive for one through the covers"
"slower ball from Lucky, sits up outside off and Buttler slaps it mercilessly back down the ground, long-on cuts it off"

"length ball, squirted away off the hips for one through midwicket"
"full toss from Phehlukwayo, the batsman had gone across for the scoop... but he misses! Livingstone was hoping to get a no-ball on height there, it was a tight one but the umpires aren't giving it. He had crouched into the shot, so even though it appeared to pass above waist height, that was probably a good call"
shortish on the body and Morgan is happy to just nudge one more to leg
"well bowled, full and very wide, Livingstone is trying to smash every delivery and fails to get any bat on it"
"banged in short, this gets up very high as Livingstone flails at it - this time gets the decision"
"ooh, he's a tad unlucky this time, Livo skips down and then can't reach the ball as Paterson appears to hit the tramline... but again called wide"
"another good yorker, right up on the crease as Livingstone chops down on it... and breaks his bat! Bits of wood go flying as they scuttle through and Paterson unsuccessfully tries to run out Morgan in his follow through. It's all happening!"
misses his mark and Morgan blooters it back past mid-on for four! Full but not quite full enough and Morgan hammered a half-volley past the diving de Villiers for four
"got him, chips a full toss to mid-on this time! De Villiers gestures to say he didn't pick it up until the last moment... but he held the catch and Paterson has his maiden international wicket at a crucial moment in the game!"
"full, 87mph and dug out down to long-on for just a single"
"lands the wide yorker, Dawson can't do much more than bludgeon through the covers"
pitched up again and Livo cloths a shot through cover for one more
"dances down, sliced over backward point, lands short of third man and again it will only be one"
"full toss, Livingstone scoops without making a proper connection... and then runs himself out by charging back to the striker's end looking for a second that his partner wasn't even beginning to consider - Dawson had his back to Livingstone and hadn't moved! A strange ending to a strange innings on debut from Livingstone"
"there's one, slugged over mid-off! Just lands short of the rope, too... Phehlukwayo misses the yorker and Dawson gets under it to keep England in the running!"
"Dawson swings and misses... SA have done it! Huge celebrations from Phehlukwayo, who is engulfed by his team-mates after closing out a fantastic match, <b>South Africe winning by three runs</b> off the final ball!"
