World class from Bumrah. Quick-arm whippy action, Marsh has been dealing with those yorkers solidly so far, but he's early on this because he's rolled his fingers over it and got it to dip. Can't play that, it's just too good. Marsh can't believe it. He was looking good and seemed to have taken them to some sort of safety, only to be outdone by a moment of genius. He's dejected, but there's really no way to adjust when you're hurrying down to deal with a yorker and it ends up drifting in slowly. The perfect deception."
