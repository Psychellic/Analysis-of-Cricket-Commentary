"full, down the leg side, Elgar manages to catch up with it and flicks down to long leg"
"that's a good one! Beats the edge with an outswinger that moves a long way. Pitches just outside off, made him play, and curves past the bat"
"more late movement, 81mph, on off stump and Kuhn gets squared up as this comes off an open face towards gully"
"a touch fuller, outside off, he can watch this swing and leave alone on the front foot"
"straighter, a full delivery, defended towards mid-on with a slightly angled bat and with a closed face. Dicey"

"that's not his best ball, speared well down the leg side...re-calibrate that radar"
"full outside off, left alone"
"short of a length outside off, left alone"
"past the edge again! It's hooping for Jimmy. Good length outside off, beats the bat by a long way in the end. Maybe could be a fraction fuller"
"gets straighter, clipped off the pads to square leg. Kuhn may feel he missed out there"
"just short of a length at off stump, 81mph, defended with a little jump behind the line to cover"
"that's a good bit of a cricket, tabs a short-of-a-length ball to the off side and they see the chance for a quick single which gets him off the mark"
"adjusts to the left hander, 86mph, on off stump and defended"
"short of a length outside off, a comfortable one to leave alone"
that's a tighter leave! Nips back from a full length and zips past the off stump as Kuhn shoulders arms

"tight on off stump, 85mph, played to the on side"
"full and straight, his bottom hand comes into play as he works to the leg side...Anderson won't mind him going across the line"

"drags the length back, cut off the back foot towards Moeen Ali at point"
"an appeal for lbw as Anderson goes straighter, Kuhn playing across the line, they ponder a review but looked a bit high. Hit above the knee roll"

"shorter, again, outside off and he plays to the off side"
"fuller, outside off, nips back but he's able to leave it alone"
gets a big stride forward and defends a full delivery towards mid-off
some pain there for Kuhn as he plays with low hands and takes a blow on the bottom glove
"on off stump, defended to the leg side with that distinctive shuffle and crouch that he has"

"fuller, just outside off, defended down by his feet"
"pushed across outside off, left alone"
"terrific catch! Liam Dawson at backward point. Full, wide outside off, Elgar reaches for it as he comes forward to drive, skews it in the air and Dawson takes a sharp one diving to his right. He'll be angry with that shot in these conditions"

worked through square leg
"angled into the pads, neatly worked off his hip behind square leg"

"short of a length, nips into Kuhn's thigh pad as he jumps in the crease...miles too high for an lbw appeal"
"full at off stump, he closes the face and gets a thick outside edge towards back point...bat coming down at an angle and the face was closed. Asking for trouble"
"fuller, angled in towards the stumps, takes the pad as there's a strangled appeal...was heading leg side"
"that's a sharp short one! Kuhn has taken this on the back of the helmet. He'll need to be checked out here. Done for pace, head was turning away."

left alone outside off
"shorter in length, on off stump, defended to the bowler"
"a bouncer over middle and off, 87mph, which he ducks"

"awkward lift from a good length, flinched out to point with a late jab of the wrists"
"outside off, full length, left well alone"

bouncer. Ducked

"good leave on a good length, angling back into the right-hander but nicely lined up and ignored"
"that's a jaffa, jagging away late from a full length, and curling round the edge. Amla nods in acknowledgement"

"short, and punished. Amla flings his wrists across the line, rolls them at the last split-second, and brings up his 8000 Test runs with a well-placed boundary behind square"

more lateral movement off the deck as the ball jags into the keeper's gloves
closes the face on a full-length delivery and dabs into the leg side
through to the keeper once more
"up on the toes and flogged through point. Wrists, wrists everywhere"
down the leg side
"a big shout! Looks outside the line but Stokes is adamant that England need to <B>review</B>, and Root agrees. Turns out we don't need to go that far as there was an inside-edge (and, yes, outside the line too). That was a tremendously optimistic effort"
"on the pads, fended square"
"ripper! Jags off the seam from a full length, and Kuhn is opened up like a can of beans as the ball bursts through to the keeper"
"blocked with a flourish, back down the line of the ball"
"solidly forward, fending away with every fibre of his being"
"well played, just wide enough to drill the hands through the line off the back foot, and pierce the covers"

defended back down the line of the ball
pushed on the up from deep in the crease
"curling in from outside off, worked into the leg side"

"on the back foot, defended into the off side"
"full outside off, left alone, swings late as it reaches Bairstow"
"this one shapes back outside off, left alone"
"big appeal for lbw! Given not out by Paul Reiffel. Root has called the <B>review</b>. Nips back and takes him above the knee roll as he tries to get forward. Height will be the issue. Yep, it's heading over middle and leg. England are out of views by the 24th over"
"very full, pitches on the popping crease, outside off and left alone"
"short of a length, coming back in at Kuhn who pushes off the back foot to the bowler"
"a strangled appeal this time, Kuhn falls across a full delivery angling into the pads...heading comfortably leg side"
"full outside off, 81mph, some gentle movement away as Amla leaves alone"
this one bounces a little more on its way to Bairstow
"well, that's unplayable! Just short of a length, angles in at off stump then moves away late in the air and off the seam to beat the edge"
"this one is fuller, makes him come forward and play, takes a thick edge along the ground towards third man"
"and again, lovely stuff from Anderson, squares up Amla around off stump but he plays with soft hands to keep the ball down towards gully"
"gets a touch too straight and it's whipped through the leg side, he's been under pressure but stays alert to the scoring chance"
"speared down the leg side and a superb one-handed take diving to his left by Bairstow, similar to his second-innings catch at Lord's"
"full outside off, zips through to the keeper as it's left alone...the sun is making an appearance, which will please the batsmen"
"that's wild down the leg side, trying to push the ball in at Amla, more work for a diving Bairstow down the leg side"
"gets away with this! Went to pull a shorter delivery, takes a top edge and flies in the air behind square but falls short of Dawson running in from long leg"

"short of a length outside off, punched from the back foot to the off-side ring"

"full outside off, gets forward and blocks to the covers"
"that's a lovely stroke, the best of Amla, stands tall and punches it at the top of the bounce between cover and mid-off"
"outside off, left alone"

"gets too straight, deflects off the thigh pad down to fine leg"
"adjusts his line, full outside off, left alone"
short of a length outside and defended to point

"goes fuller, at the stumps, played into the leg side as the bat face closes a little"
"after a lovely shot here's a lovely ball, curves away late past the outside edge with Amla trying to get forward"
"and again! Two in two from Anderson. This one is a little fuller, Amla commits onto the front foot, the ball nibbles past the outside edge. Late movement"
"and the straighter one, super cricket, Amla traps it off the inside edge into the leg side. Two titans of the game going head-to-head"
"full outside off, punched to mid-off"
"he threads the off-side field again, promising signs for Amla, he strides forward into a full ball and eases it between cover and mid-off"
"straighter, worked to the on side"

a solid drive to mid-off as Broad goes full outside off
"gets away with another top edge pull! Dragged the short from outside off, goes squarer than the previous one, there are two men out in the deep. Deep square didn't see it. Would probably have been safe anyway"
that's a ripper! Angles in from round the wicket and straightens off the seam to beat de Kock's outside edge
"did that carry?! Nope, just short of Root at second slip. Ball shaping away outside off, Amla trying to pull his bat way at the last moment, takes the outside edge"
defended to the off side
"short outside off, he gets away with it as Amla cracks his square drive straight to Dawson at point"
"gets this one away, short and too wide, throws his hands through a cut and though it's in the air it's comfortably in the gap behind point"

"round the wicket, full at off stump, defended"
full outside off and a lovely piece of timing as he punches it square through point. Didn't even think of running
"straightens the line but it's equally well played, clipped firmly from around off stump through midwicket"
"and now it's through the off side again, a nice compact cover drive, doesn't quite have the legs to run all the way. Driven on the up"
works a straight ball off the stumps out to deep square leg
"full outside off, pushed firmly straight down the pitch and into the non-striker's stumps"

met on the full and drilled to mid-off
"round the wicket now, met on the back foot with a pat to cover"
"down the ground, and that is seriously handsome! Hands through the line of the ball, a lofted drive, right onto the rope itself, which means Amla has his fifty! Only 108 more to lift his average to the same..."

"inside-edge, and safely over the stumps and away to the rope! Angled in from wide of off, and very streaky!"
"that's a remarkable shot, pulled in front of square with almost a checked drive of a stroke. The ball sat up a touch in the pitch, but de Kock was already there, and a fractional adjustment fizzed it to the rope"
through to the keeper
patted to cover
"tightens up on off stump, and defended"
defended back down the pitch
forward and blocked

"open face, guided to point"
cut to point
"onto the front foot, pushed to mid-off"
driven through the covers. Sumptuous
"fully forward, and defended back to the bowler"
"strikes first ball! As so often, the interval does the trick. A length ball outside off, de Kock goes after it, aiming to play square through the off side, and it flies off the top edge to Cook at first slip"
"full outside off, left alone"
gets onto the front foot and defends with bat and pad together

"first runs since tea, Anderson overpitches outside off, Amla drives it between cover and mid-off...Anderson just spins around in his follow through and chunters to himself"

"angled in at middle and leg, worked off the pads to long leg"
gets a little squared up around off stump as he defends to the covers

left alone outside off
worked off the stumps into midwicket
"full outside off, defended to cover"
driven to mid-off

"short of a length outside off, Bavuma pulls his bat inside the line and the ball then moves late as it reaches Bairstow"
"full at the stumps, defended to cover"

"full and straight, defended"
"driven in the air, full outside off, nice shape away, takes a thick outside edge but flies behind point to third man...more frustration for Wood"
shoved down the leg side
"back of a length, zips back at du Plessis as he leaves it alone"
"shoveled into the leg side, behind square, taking the bottom hand off the bat"
"fantastic catch down the leg side! Wonderful take by Bairstow, but du Plessis has <b>reviewed</b> straightaway. Given very quickly by Reiffel. Looks like it's come off the hip from front on. Well, well...there's a mark on Snicko! It's taken the glove on the way. He's gone. Super decision on-field and an even better catch by Bairstow to flung himself to his left"
"full outside off, left alone...a sighter for him"
"a bouncer, too short, way over his head"
"full outside off, Wood getting the ball to move away, left alone"

"full outside off, left alone"
"full at off stump, defended very correctly to cover"
"pulls again and with good results, whistles to the deep square-leg boundary and there's no one out there at the moment"

tucked to deep square leg
"full outside off, 80mph, although looked a touch quicker than that, left alone"
"off the face of the bat! Bavuma trying to leave the ball alone, on a length outside off, but he's too slow to withdraw the bat and it slides off the face to Bairstow"
"goodness me! No playing that. This has come back miles from outside off, short of a length, and swings back to beat Morris' inside edge as he suddenly tries to bring the bat down"
"fuller, at off stump, caught on the crease as he defends"
"oops, that didn't come out quite right...a big full toss outside off, loops to the keeper as it's left alone"
"full again, late movement in at Morris who drives to the covers"
jabs at this ball outside off towards point
"good length, 82mph, defended to cover"
"more late swing! He just gets his bat down in as this shapes back late into his pads, squeezes it to deep square"
that's a pleasing-looking shot as he comes forward and drives to point
"not quite so full this time, defends from the crease into the covers"
"that's nicely played, solidly into line and punches through a full ball to send it straight of mid-off"
"full, pretty wide, left alone"
"that's a bit of rubbish, big full toss outside off and it's driven to the boundary"
"back on a full length and that's well played, too, as he comes forward and pushes into space at cover"
"back of a length, 82mph, defended"
"threaded through the off side again, this time from Morris, as Stokes offers up a full and wide delivery"
gets across the crease and neatly works a delivery from off stump to deep midwicket
"round the wicket, starts with a short one, Morris rocks back and drives to the cover sweeper"
"full and straight, defended and comes off the inside edge"
stretches forward and blocks
"finds the inside edge again as he comes forward, scoots quickly on the bounce to Ballance at short leg"
"fraction short, he goes onto the back foot and plays to the off-side sweeper"
"better line and length, full on middle, he's well forward and defends"
"beauty! Outside off, climbing off the seam, nipping round the edge"
"angling in, keeping low, dribbles through to the tumbling Bairstow"
"width and walloped! A creamy square drive, utterly dispatched"
sliding into the pads and fenced round the corner
blocked into the off side

"outside off, careful defence from deep in the crease"
"onto the front foot, but a bit of a scuffed drive to mid-off"

"tight line, solid defence"
"flicked on the up to midwicket, a good tumbling stop saves the single"
"squared up in defence, on a full length"
"slashed into the leg side, off an under-edge, like an unintentional 'NatMeg'. Ugly but effective"

left alone on the angle across the right-hander
cracked on the up to mid-off
"pushed back into the crease, defended"
"driven into the gap in the covers, one hand comes off the bat in his followthough. A distant reminder of his hurty hand from Lord's. Seems fine today!"
sliding back into the crease and defended

"wicket to wicket, blocked with caution again"
"ooh, scher-wing! Beats the edge!"
"tight line, get out to this if you dare!"
gets across the stumps to flick a single to midwicket
"yorker, dug out. As filth goes, that was tremendous. Like a pig in the proverbial"
"immediate nibble, from back of a length. Fenced into the off side"
"edged, but with soft hands, down into the cordon. Root at second slip does well to claw the ball back as it threatens to elude him"
"fuller length, more outswing. Blocked to cover"
"back of a length, worked firmly into the leg side"
full but wide of off stump. No stroke there
"ooh ... nearly nearly! Much fuller, swinging late, takes a fat edge but it is just about controlled, in the air for a moment through backward point"
"back of a length, blocked on the back foot"
"angling in, solid defence on the line of off stump"
"well bowled, ghosts in then climbs off the seam. Morris somehow tugs his bat inside the line then follows the ball anyway, like a man armed with a massive electromagnet, faced with a meteorite"
tucked off the hip
short and cracked brilliantly in front of square. He was onto it so quickly
"zoinks, how did that miss?! Skims over the off bail after jagging back wickedly. Just about left alone on length"
"zig-zagging through the air, if he gets that a touch fuller it'll be quite a challenge. As it is, Morris can just about track it off the pitch"
more fierce jag from a fractionally fuller length. Blocked under the eyeline
blocked once again
through to the keeper on a wider line
full and threatening. Defended again

"tight line, full length, urgent defence"
defended
"wow, Philander has hammered that! Stands tall at the crease, crashes through the line as Broad strays too wide, and fillets the cover boundary"
solidly forward and pushed back to the bowler
punched through the covers. More pleasing aggression
"short, drops the hands well to let the ball fizz by"
"back of a length, fenced back to the bowler"

"short, pulled, well placed. Good batting"
"on the pads, tucked to backward square"
defended back down the pitch
tucked into the gap. Great resolve from this pair

"onto the front foot, blocked to cover"
defended down into the gully
"cracked off the front foot to a sliding short cover. The shot of a man seeing it well, as that swung late but was middled all the same"

clipped into the leg side
clipped to leg
left alone outside off
"lovely ball, angles in, nips away, beats the edge"
"blocked on the back foot, back down the pitch"
"beats the edge once more, good aggressive finish to the day from Stokes, who is finding some late nibble off the seam"
"on the pads, worked to the leg side"
tapped into the off side
"edged, and just short! Root at second slip gobbles it up on the bounce, and here endeth the first day"
"swing from back of a length, defended solidly on the back foot"
"tight line on off stump, no swing this time. Blocked to mid-on"
"back of a length once more, calmly patted into the covers"
"this one jags! Hits the deck, nips away, Philander dangles the bat as the ball zips by. Still too short, to be frank. Looked dramatic but easily avoided"
"back of a length does the trick! Philander tries to close the face on a steer through midwicket, gets a leading edge and it's a lollipop catch into the covers! He's gone without adding to his overnight 54, and that's a bodyblow for South Africa's hopes of pushing towards 400"
zing. This one holds its line and fizzes past the edge. Can't play those!
"back of a length, outside off, pushed away off the back foot to cover"
"fuller length, still a wide line, dead-batted to cover"
"short and sharper, angles back into the right hander who drops his hands in time"
"swinging down the leg side, a sharp take from Bairstow, diving to his left. He pulled off a blinder yesterday to a similar line"
"leg-sided again, a bit of a freebie, and clipped fine"
"squelch. Banged in short, Morris ducks, takes his eye off the ball and wears it on the shoulder blade"
"slightly fuller length, nibbles off the seam, pushed to cover"
"outside off, curling away, no stroke offered. Anderson inching fuller with every ball"
"massive inswinger! That's the sucker punch, and Maharaj knew nothing of it! But it went late and violently, and was sliding down leg by the time it rapped the pads"
"that is too good from Anderson. Reverts to the outswinger, lures the frozen-rabbit stab outside off, and Root pulls off a take for the cameras, diving in front of first slip to cling on with both hands! It was the inswinger wot won it, and South Africa have had a disastrous start to their day"
"sliding down the leg side, a bit of an anticlimax after that double whammy"
"tighter line on off stump, fended away. A successful over"
"inducker on off stump, clipped to leg"
"short, and panned in front of square with a short-arm pull. Effective"
"solidly into line to defend the full length, and steals the single"
"round the wicket, probing the left-hander's edge with a bit of nip off the seam"
"a flat-footed wallop, finds thin air as the ball jags past the bat"
"punched down the ground, working with the full length and putting it away through long-off. A good counterattacking over"
"late swing from a fuller length, stabbed out to point"
"well watched, defending the outswinger from deep in the crease"
"back and across, pushed to cover, where Stokes fields well but slips as he does so, and seems to have tweaked his ribs while shying the ball"
swinging down the leg side
"fuller length, watching the outswinger right into the middle of an aggressive straight punch. Well bowled and even better played"
"identical delivery, and this time it is popped straight back to Anderson off the leading edge. A quick juggle and into his mitts it goes!"
tapped out to cover
"on the pads, clipped to leg"
"outside off, flashed to third man"
drilled through mid-off once again! Broad gets punished for over-pitching
"on the legs, attempted clip to midwicket"
"big inswinger, somehow kept out"
curling outswinger to the left-hander. Blocked
"he only needed two! Another outswinger, a loose ambitious slap, a thin nick, a simple catch to Bairstow behind the stumps! Excellent carry, and quite the spell from Jimmy this morning. 4 for 4 in 3.2 overs!"
"leg-sided, fenced to square leg"
"down the leg side, but only by a whisker. Cook wandered a long way across his stumps for the attempted nurdle and might have been bowled round his legs"
"leaping bounce on off stump, Cook shoulders arms with a flourish as the ball flies through to de Kock"
"on the pads, and Cook is away in trademark fashion, a single behind square"
"back of a length, nibbling away, defended to point off the back foot"
"through to the keeper, tighter line and good carry. A promising first over"
wide of off stump to begin with. No stroke offered
firmly forward and blocked on the front foot
"stays in the crease this time, fuller and straighter, and worked to point"
"wider this time, calmly ignored"
"swinging onto the pads and that's a gimme for Cook, just manipulated out towards the rope at deep midwicket"
pushed to cover
"fierce lift from a tight line, good leave"
fenced back to the bowler
"fuller length, solid block"
"that's a good delivery, jags wickedly in the air and hits the splice hard as Jennings defends on the back foot"
"wider line, Jennings shapes to cut but bails out due to the bounce"
"round the wicket, defended on the back foot, out to point"
"full length inswinger to the left-hander, and a big inside-edge onto the knee roll! Bat-pad would have guzzled that, but Philander can't make up the ground in his followthrough"
"outside off, tight line, good leave"
"another inside-edge, but this time it's a good one for Cook, as it prevents what might have been a raucous lbw appeal as he planted his front leg to the inswinger"
cautious block on off stump. Good probing bowling
"full length, nibbling in the air and off the seam, dabbed into the gully"
"another <I>huge</I> appeal! And a <strong>review</strong>... that inswinger is really troubling Cook. A long look from the umpire but declined on the field, probably on the grounds of another inside-edge ... but where has the ball gone after flicking the pad ... into de Kock's gloves, that's where! That is caught behind, and the wickets keep tumbling this morning!"
"and another! As I was saying, the ball dominating. Round the wicket, short of a length, angled in at off stump, straightens off the seam and it's a regulation outside edge"
"full and straight, neatly off the mark with a clip through midwicket...the crowd enjoy being able to applaud some runs"
"round the wicket, full at the stumps, aims to turn it away and takes the pads to the leg side"
"full outside off, 84mph, left alone"
"short of a length, at off stump, defended on the back foot"
"short, wider outside off, he can comfortably let this one go through"
"full outside off, plenty of swing away, left alone"
"gets across to off stump, plays this quite late with an open face towards point"
gets inside the line of a straighter delivery and flicks it off his hip through square leg
"pushed across outside off, Ballance nearly has a nibble at it before pulling the bat away just about in time"
"a little wider outside off, 83mph, left alone"
closer to off stump but he's able to leave alone
"back of a length outside off, he's onto the back foot and punches to cover"
"on the stumps, takes the inside edge as Root brings the bat down and scoots down to long leg"
"fuller, at off stump, 83mph and Root gets himself forward into the ball"
"dragged wider outside off, in other circumstances Root would have had a go at that but he leaves alone"
"angled into the pads, worked into square leg"
"a somewhat streaky drive by Ballance as he goes after a full delivery outside off, takes a thickish outside edge wide of gully"
"that's a super stroke, strides forward, watches the ball swing a touch and drives on the up through the covers"
"less control this time! A slightly shorter delivery outside off, he's playing off the back foot this time and it flies off the outside edge wide of gully"
"good length outside off, swings away, left alone"
"starts slightly straighter, defended to the covers"
"that's another wonderful stroke, fractionally short of a length outside off, into perfect position as he drives it off the back foot through the covers"
nearly a leading edge to the bowler as he looks to work away a short-of-a-length delivery
"short outside off, he sways out of the line"
"full at off stump, pushed to mid-on"
"good length outside off, left alone"
through to the keeper at waist height
"pushed up fuller outside off, the delivery he can sometimes get stuck against, he drives it firmly through the covers"
"over-adjusts his line, angled into the pads, Ballance uses his wrists to flick it down to fine leg"
"back of a length, works a straight delivery off the pads through square leg"
"good length at off stump, touch of nibble, defended to cover"
pushed across outside off and left alone
"full outside off, Ballance shuffles back and across then plays it with soft hands, the ball running through gully to third man"
the bottom hand comes into play as he takes this from around off stump to mid-on
"good length outside off, 81mph, left alone"
"starts short and wide, Root doesn't miss out as he hammers it square through the off side"
"short, too much width again, Root guides it wide of gully with an open face and it beats deep point...not sure you'd ideally want to have a deep point in these conditions"
"well, deep point saves a boundary this time, as Root square cuts a short, wide delivery"
"starts outside leg stump and swings further past Ballance, a diving take for de Kock"
"better delivery, full and straight, nips back late at Ballance who gets a thick inside edge behind square"
gets forward to a full delivery outside off...that over for better from a low base
"starts with a full ball outside leg stump but there's some encouraging swing for him, more diving work for de Kock"
tucks a good-length ball into midwicket
"full outside off, nice shape away at 83mph, left alone"
"in the same spot, full outside off, significant movement as Root leaves"
another one through to the keeper from a full length
"gets on the pads and is sweetly flicked away behind square, that whizzed off his blade and though wasn't too far from long leg there was no chance to cut it off"
"over the wicket, back of a length, worked to the leg side"
"wide outside off, 86mph, left alone"
"fuller, on middle and leg, tucked off the pads behind square"
"round the wicket, full outside off, left alone"
"a touch closer to off stump, he's able to let it go through"
"gets too straight again, on the angle, neatly flicked off his pads wide of a diving de Kock. In fact, no bat involved"
"very full outside off, 83mph, takes the toe end"
"wider outside off, he's certainly getting some significant swing but Root doesn't need to play at this"
"that's better! Starts closer to off stump, Root felt he had to play at this and it shapes late to beat the outside edge"
"and now just gets it wrong, full and on the pads, worked through square leg and this time Maharaj can get round from long leg"
"full at off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"a touch too short and wide outside off, think Root wanted to cut that but decided to leave it alone"
"round the wicket, good length outside off at a lively 87mph, left alone"
"full, very wide, Ballance chases it, reaches out well away from his body, doesn't well to make contact and it flies off the top edge over gully"
"responds with a short ball outside off, 86mph, angles back at Ballance who drops his gloves"
works this from outside off with a closed face behind square on the leg side
"beaten! A bit loose from Root, pushing away from his body at a short-of-a-length delivery which he didn't need to play at"
"and again he takes advantage of a ball that's a touch too straight, flicked through midwicket with a nice piece of timing"
"he walks at the bowler this time, jabs a full delivery into the ground and it bounces back to Olivier...well, they are checking for a return catch! Soft signal is not out. Did it come off Root's boot straight to the bowler? None  of the players that excited. It did take the toe of his boot, but had come off the ground first. As you were"
"a short ball on off stump, pulls it in the air over midwicket and it has the power to reach the rope although it wasn't perfectly timed...no holding back from the captain"
"back on a full length outside off, 85mph, that's where he needs to park all day, defended to mid-off"
"full outside off, left alone"
"goes after another short ball, he has to drag this from wider outside off and it takes a top edge over square leg...not entirely convincing but safe in the end"
"and the runs keep coming, but this isn't the fault of the bowler. A good length ball outside off, Root plays forward and it slides off the outside edge between the slip cordon and gully"
"over the wicket, worked from outside off behind square"
"round the wicket, full at off stump, defended coming forward"
a touch shorter and Root times this beautifully off the back foot as he whips it in front of square to take him a rapid 40-ball fifty. Talk about counterattacking
"fuller, at the stumps, driven to cover"
"flatter and a little quicker, defended as he plays back"
"full and straight, a solid block on the front foot to end an action-packed session"
"outside off, good channel, no stroke"
"very full, tailing in, squeezed into the leg-side with an inside-edged drive"
"over the wicket, full length, prodded to cover"
three slips lurk as Root shoulders arm with a late adjustment as this one cuts back into him
ploughing that furrow... keeps a touch low outside off but no stroke threatened
stabbed to cover
"bowled! Stuck on the crease, as is his wont, and a loose pokey push to a full-length ball. Inside-edged into his back leg and onto his off stump!"
"late outswing and an uncertain half-drive, half-leave squeezes into the cordon"
"zoinks, that's done everything except get the batsman out! Beautiful seam position, nips back into the pads with violent intent, then deflects through a flat-footed cordon! Just as well there wasn't an edge, really!"
"on the toes, clipped firmly, he's up and running"
"outside off, and through to the keeper"
"outside off, more late nibble off the seam and away from a loose poke. This is going to be fun ... strap in!"
"more wicked jag off the seam. If I was being picky, that was six inches too short and six inches too wide to challenge the bat. But plenty of seeds of doubt will have been planted there!"
"fuller length, wider line, no stroke offered"
"wow, big inducker, clips the back pad. Tough going out there, and good carry too"
pushed back into the crease with the fuller length
flicked through the leg side
"more jag back into the right-hander. Inside-edged into the pads. Lovely line, length, and a purring rhythm"
"wicket to wicket, pushed into the gap in the covers and that's an excellent run, making something from nothing to keep the board ticking"
"flat-footed drive, a fat edge, but falls short of second slip! Bairstow went at that very hard, so a miracle it didn't carry ..."
too straight this time and flicked behind square for a cathartic run
"outside off, nips away, beats the edge as Bairstow just about manages not to be drawn into the stroke"
"outside off, and through to the keeper"
"tucked to leg, and keeps the strike"
"nips back into the pads, a strangled appeal, always heading down"
"gadzooks, the pitch is misbehaving and the clouds are closing in. Tough times ahead! This one somehow sneaks past the off stump after keeping low on pitching. Unplayable"
"down the leg side. South Africa are fighting hard, but still not quite as consistent as the conditions demand"
solid block on off stump
"outside off, jabbed through third man. More valuable runs"
"cut in half by a big nipbacker! Over the top of the stumps, and on we go..."
"outside off, swinging away, through to the keeper"
"too straight, it won't swing from there, flicked off the hip to midwicket"
"tight to the stumps, blocked back down the pitch with a high-elbowed push"
tapped into the off side
worked around the front pad
"on the pads, tucked to midwicket"
angled into the off stump
"outside off, a bouncing bomb through to the keeper"
"pushed back into the stumps, played back to the bowler"
"drilled back to the bowler, who gathers well by his ankles"
"crashed to deep point, a good connection with a full-blooded swing through the line, but the sweeper is well positioned"
defended
"onto the front dog, pushed to cover"
"big hooping outswinger, but Root reads it from the hand and drills a square drive to the sweeper"
"on the pads, tucked behind square"
pushed to cover
"oh, that's immense. Picks the length so early, pivots into a riotous pull in front of square. He's utterly flying"
"up on the toes, punched to cover to keep the strike"
"banged in short but stays lower than Root anticipated. An ambitious pull, and ends up wearing it on the knee-roll"
"angled down through the cordon, deliberately steered but a good line nonetheless"
"crashed out to deep square leg, another meaty pull from a man who is seeing it like the Forest Moon of Endor"
"up on the toes, stabbed down into the turf and away to backward point"
"nipped off the seam, through a loose drive and over the stumps to the keeper. Careful now..."
shoulders arms with insouciance this time
"more hooping outswing as Olivier returns, but from a wide line. Eased down to third man"
"outside off, tighter line, a hint of swing, no stroke offered"
"on the toes, stabbed through midwicket"
"late swing, takes a fat outside edge, and away safely through the off side"
"too wide, and utterly clobbered. That'll make Bairstow feel better. He's been rattling along without actually looking in up until now"
"wider line, no stroke"
"short and leg-sided. That's a poor ball, angling down to fine leg, which is exactly where Root helps it with a yawning pull behind square"
"onto the front foot, more sharp running"
left alone outside off
"up on the toes, driven hard to cover"
"on the pads, worked to square leg"
"whoops, that's tough luck on the bowler, jags back in through the gate, dies on the keeper and fizzes down to fine leg. It's all England at the moment!"
more single-pinching with a dead-batted steer into the gap
"on the pads, that's poor bowling, simply can't create the pressure that the conditions demand. A fine sliding stop at backward square saves the four"
"wide of off stump, watched into the keeper's gloves"
"flashed out to point, in the air for a split second, but safe in the end"
"tighter line, dabbed into the cordon"
"short and wide, and signalled as such. Bairstow shaped to cut, but would have needed a trampoline to reach that"
cracked off the back foot to mid-off
"edged and gone! Root's languid aggression gets the better of him, as he goes hard at a ball that gets big in the channel and takes a thin edge to the diving de Kock. That's a massive moment in the Test, as Root is the one man who has transcended the conditions"
"greets Stokes with a short ball from round the wicket, sways out of the line"
"another bouncer, this one angles down the leg side"
"good length outside off, gets forward and defends to cover"
leaves this alone
"full outside off, wide enough to watch it go through"
"gets squared up a little, was starting to work this to leg side and it straighten off the seam"
"this is a smidgen shorter, gets inside the line and flicks behind square"
"over the wicket, a short ball angled across outside off"
"full at middle, punched firmly to mid-on"
defends a length ball into the leg side
"touch of late swing there, a much fuller delivery, Stokes came forward to drive and it squirts to the leg side"
"feeling for this outside off, short of a length, not in control as it flies wide of gully"
and this time it's an inside edge past the stumps! Forcing off the back foot and the ball scoots not too far from leg stump
"full and straight, drilled to mid-on"
"another one that keeps low, was heading for off stump but Bairstow manages to get the bat down"
flicks a full delivery to midwicket
plays a length ball with a straight bat and the ball runs into square leg
"back of a length, punched off the back foot to the bowler as the sun makes an appearance"
"fuller, he comes forward and drives"
"oh dear, mid-off has let one through his legs. It's Big Vern. Was a wider delivery, Bairstow drove it firmly but should have been stopped"
"full at the stumps, played firmly into midwicket where Bavuma can't stop it cleanly but it doesn't cost"
"that's the best drive of the over, comes into the front foot and places it through the covers and it has the placement to beat deep point's despairing dive"
takes the pad into the leg side
"full outside off, left alone"
"back of a length, pushed to the covers"
"big appeal for lbw and they have gone for the <b>review</b>. Given not out by Simon Fry. Thought it looked pretty straight. Swung at the last minute to beat Bairstow's edge as he played to the leg side. Philander was convinced. This is very close. Will the bounce save Bairstow? Oh, well, so much for beating the edge...he's nicked it. Why I'm not an umpire. Excellent eyesight from Fry"
"good length outside off, defended to cover"
"fuller, brings a drive from Bairstow and this inside edge goes into his pads"
"another edge, full at off stump, Bairstow pushing forward and it flies wide of Bavuma of backward point...wasn't in the air for long, but more late swing"
"round the wicket, full, driven back to the bowler"
"wider outside off, drifts in with the arm, he comes forward and defends"
pushed back down the pitch...how long can Bairstow resist?
stretches well forward and defends
"on leg stump, he goes for the sweep and picks out short fine leg"
"touch shorter, he plays back and punches with an open face and there's another fumble by Philander, this time at backward point"
"full at off stump, still getting late shape, driven to mid-off"
that's a beauty! Draws him forward and then beats the edge with late away swing
"in the channel outside off, a late decision to leave it alone"
"on off stump, good length, defended"
"he spoons this in the air, but straight down the ground with better timing that it initially looked. Was a fraction early on the shot, or the ball stopped, but was wide of Philander"
"full at off stump, defended to cover"
"full outside off, he gets well forward and defends"
pushed back towards the bowler
"and he's done it! Another huge moment. What a bonus, wicket for the spinner. This bounces a little outside off, Stokes playing forward gets an inside edge which loops off the pad and through to de Kock. Bobble up out of de Kock's gloves, but he kept calm and alert to gather the rebound. Well, they are checking with the third umpire. The no-ball is fine, but did it hit the keeper's helmet? Well, well. This is actually quite close. Has it grazed the grille? Or just taken the shoulder. Taking a long look at this. Eventually the third umpire confirms it's okay and Stokes goes"
"jeepers, that's one way to get off the mark! Goes down on his back knee and slog sweeps to deep midwicket"
"well bowled! Toss up outside off, he goes for the drive and gets an inside edge...dust from the footmarks"
"drives again, nearly early on the shot, finds mid-off. Interesting times"
"full outside off, left alone"
"full and straight, a bottom-handed whip to mid-on"
"length ball, opens the face and plays towards backward point"
"that's a lovely ball, seam and bounce to beat the outside edge"
defended into the off side
"plays this late, waiting for it to swing, soft hands towards gully"
flicks from outside into the leg side
round the wicket and momentary excitement as he traps it off the inside edge into his front pad
pushed into the off side
"touhc shorter, played off the back foot into the covers"

low full toss which is driven to mid-off
"full outside off, left alone"
"wider outside off, through to the keeper"
"closer to off stump, full, he comes forward and drives to cover"
"angled across outside off, left alone"
"that's a delightful stroke, just back of a length outside off and Moeen drives it wide of mid-off from the back foot"
"straightens the line, clipped to midwicket"
"what a ball! That is a gem. Drifts in, pitches on middle, spins, beats the outside edge and cleans up Bairstow. Maharaj is off on a mini-Tahir run. That's a lovely piece of left-arm spin"
"he's off the mark, pushes forward at a full ball, was in the air a little while to the covers"
"more spin there from outside off, Moeen works it around the corner on the leg side"
"a little shorter, pushed off the back foot down to long-on"
"full at middle and leg, defended to the on side"
defended to silly point
"short of a length at leg stump, tucked off the hip to long leg"
"pushed down the leg side, flicked to deep square leg"
"short outside off, driven square of the wicket through point to the sweeper"
a short ball angled across which Moeen leaves alone
on the pads and flicked to deep square leg
"full at off stump, better ball, defended to cover...not a great over to end the session"
slapped to wide mid-on
"big stride forward, smothering the spin"
"head over the ball, stretching down the pitch"
forward with caution and conviction once more
"shorter, cut firmly into the covers"
forward and blocked
"outside off, a loose flash, and a clear click as ball passes bat! Up goes the finger, but Dawson <B>reviews</b>...! Err, that was a country mile from being an edge! I think he's got a creaky bat handle..."
"angled defence, down through third man. Helpful runs"
"banged in short, and rather wild, down the leg side"
"lovely ball, full length, vertical seam, big swing, beats a loose drive"
"dabbed into the off side, off the back foot"
"on the back foot, flinched into the leg side. That one jaffa aside, another nondescript over"
"on the back foot, blocked in front of middle and off"
big stride forward to block
there's more spin on show as Moeen stretches to defend and wears it on the knee roll
flicked behind square
forward and smothered on the front foot
forward and blocked
"round the wicket, back of a length, punched to mid-off"
"short, but too wide. Moeen doesn't need to play at that one"
"round the wicket, back of a length, Moeen sways"
"short and sharp, through to the keeper as Moeen ducks"
tightens up in defence on the back foot
"bashed hard into the covers, fuller length and a bit of width, just how Moeen likes it. The sweeper intercepts"
"round the wicket, back of a length, chopped urgently to point"
"big stride, full face"
stout defence on the front dog
"down the track, using the feet and worked to midwicket"
"down the leg side, too full, and that's compactly swept behind square. Good opportunistic run-harvesting"
forward and pushed to cover
"full length, and that's a flaccid departure from Moeen! Hanging back, in expectation of another bouncer, his weight wasn't leaning into the shot, and point snaffles a lofted drive!"
"full and straight, and that's got to be close! Morris is off on a celebrappeal, and sure enough, South Africa <B>review</B>. Yep, hitting leg, and Broad has got a first-baller! He was back in his crease, fully expecting the bouncer, and was sold a complete pup by some intelligent bowling"
"full toss, and dead-straight! Might have worked, but Wood gets enough wood on it"
"outside off, back of a length, takes off into the keeper's gloves"
"wide on the crease, wide of the stumps with another short one"
"back of a length, attacking the gloves. A double-wicket maiden. A rare and precious beast"
"onto the front foot, pushed to point"
"a dirty slog across the line, a spiralling top-edge, and that's not the way to reduce the deficit! Amla gathers in his mother's pinny at square leg, and Maharaj has a very impressive three-for in next to no time"
"outside off, turning back into the left-hander. Defended"
"patted to mid-on, off the back foot"
"attempted reverse sweep, and spanks the keeper's shins. Unlucky, he connected well"
"hits the pad, and loops up, but no bat involved"
"on the hip, tucked square"
thwacks the pad on a leg-stump line
through to the keeper again

poked into the off side
"tossed up, into the toes, defended"
forward
"pushed away, tight attacking line"
chiselled down the ground to long-on
"outside off, through to the keeper"
pushed to cover
"short, and slammed through midwicket, that is a confident stroke, and a valuable boundary"
"outside off, a wafty ramp-y upper-cutty ... non-shot"
"short and sharp, just about sways inside the line, albeit with gloves raised dangerously high"
"edged and gone! A fierce delivery, lifting into the splice, deflected to second slip and comfortably gobbled. England have tumbled from 143 for 3 to 205 all out ... and a deficit of 130"
"that's a loose loosener. On the pads, and whipped easily through midwicket"
"pokey defence outside off, that's a better line"
"onto the front foot, blocked"
"squared up on middle and leg, pushed back to the bowler"
"forward, meeting the curve from middle to off with a full face"
worked into the off side as Anderson hones his outswinger
"good areas straight away, angled in and blocked to the off side"
"outside off, Kuhn lines it up and lets it go"
"outside off, and through to the keeper"
"that's a loose shot to a wide ball, fuller length and lured into a rash drive"
"outside off, another one climbs through to the keeper"
"full length, angled in, pushed to mid-on with an uneasy drive"
"outside off, Elgar reaches for the ball, his first of the innings, and prods it back to the bowler"
"well bowled, ghosting past the gloves and through to the keeper"
"Elgar is batting like an accident waiting to happen here. Anderson dangling the ball across his bows and drawing an inelegant prod, away from the body"
poked through point to get off the mark
tapped into the off side
another tight over
onto the front foot and pushed into the off side
pushed into the covers
"round the wicket, sliding down leg"
lifting through to the keeper on a tighter off-stump line
"nudged into the leg side, with a full face of the bat. The very definition of a nudge, in fact"
squared up in defence
solid in defence
"a big appeal as Anderson slips in the inswinger, but his pad looks outside the line... but Root is <B>reviewing</B> nonetheless... it might be tight, actually, it went in late and hard. In line, but sliding over the top of middle. Kuhn got well out of his crease there"
through to the keeper
tucked into the leg side
"well bowled, driving at ghosts as this one pitches and zigs away from a hard-handed drill"
"on the pads, tucked into the leg side"
"round the wicket, worked off the pads to midwicket"
"another one past the outside edge, reaching forward at a full delivery, well away from his body"
defended into the covers
"angled in at off stump on a full length, Elgar gets squared up as he defends and the ball runs towards gully"
"too straight this time and it's clipped behind square, brisk running makes a second"
his back leg comes right around as he defends this from off stump towards mid-on
"full at off stump, driven off the bottom of the bat"
"edged, and taken at second slip! Anderson has worked over Kuhn. This is a good-length ball just outside off, brings him forward and it's snaffled low down by Root"
"good delivery, just back of a length outside off, but Amla plays with soft hands and the edge runs towards wide third slip"
"a short delivery, pulled off his hip towards long leg where Wood makes a bit of a mess of the fielding and parries it to the boundary"
"full and straight, he's across to off stump and defends"
"full outside off, 83mph, a get-past-that forward defensive shot from Amla"
"full and wide outside off, driven square through the covers as he took the bottom hand of the bat"
"full again, closer to off stump, 85mph and driven to mid-off"
"neatly played into the covers, a front front push which Anderson can't stop cleanly"
"drags the length back, on off stump, 86mph, defended"
"and he threads the off side again, comes forward and drives a full delivery between the men in the covers"
"length ball at middle and off, 87mph, defended to the covers"
"good length outside off, plays with the hint of swing as he defends"
"back of a length, defended"

"full at off stump, 88mph, defended to mid-off"
comes forward into a full delivery and plays back towards Wood in his follow through
"another bouncer, 83mph, Elgar ducks underneath"
"good length at off stump, 87mph, defended into backward point"
gets across the crease and plays a straight delivery to the on side...back-to-back maidens
defended towards point
"fuller, outside off, Amla is well across the crease as he defends"
"shorter, he plays back with a little hop to defend"
"not far off a return catch! Playing this off the back foot, short-of-a-length delivery, comes from low down on the bat"
"fuller at middle and off, defended"
"on off stump, 83mph, defended towards point. That's three maidens on the bounce"
"short of a length, defended towards point"
"another one on the short side, 86mph, played to the covers...the ball not doing much for Wood"
takes his bottom hand off the bat as he works a short-of-a-length delivery to the leg side...the run of dots is ended
"a bouncer outside off, he sways out of the line"
"fuller outside off, 87mph, left alone"
punched off the back foot into the covers
"round the wicket, full at pads, clipped to square leg"
"too straight again, square leg has been moved back to the fence so this time the clip provides runs"
"full outside off, takes a thick inside edge to the leg side as he plays forward"
that's a nice piece of timing and placement as Broad is too straight again and it's worked wide of mid-on
"plays forward to a full ball outside off, defends towards gully"
"excellent stop at second slip, Root springing to his left to cut off this outside edge from Elgar"
"full outside off, left alone"
this is a controlled outside edge as he steers a length ball wide of second slip
"back of a length at off stump, 86mph, defended to point"
"puts away a short ball at 87mph with a well-controlled pull in front of square, he saw that early"
"that was brisk, a short ball outside off, zips through to Bairstow"
"full, outside off, left alone"
"on the pads again, too many there from Broad in this spell, and that's a lovely piece of timing as he clips through midwicket"
"comes over the wicket, full at middle and off, defended"
"more runs, brought him forward outside off, pushing at the delivery and edge flies fine of gully"
"full at middle and off, played to mid-on"
"full outside off, left alone"
"good length at off stump, tightly defended to the covers"
plays back and whips to deep square leg
"round the wicket, full at off stump, defended"
"touch of extra bounce, Elgar takes his bottom hand off the bat to keep it down"
a loopy full toss but it doesn't cost as he drives to mid-off
"angled in at middle and leg, defended"
"driven just wide of the man at short cover, tossed up into the footmarks, not a million miles away from Cook but finds the gap"
"full outside off, defended to cover"
"a long away across the crease and misses his flick, takes the pad and Broad appeals for lbw but it's heading leg side"
"back of a length at off stump, defended"
"a strong, punchy drive down the ground, fully in control as he sends it straight of mid-off"
"pulls the length back a touch, a big stride forward as he defends"
"fuller, played to mid-off...not much happening for England"
"pumped straight down the ground, a couple of steps out of his crease and lofts is over Moeen's head"
that's one of those big full tosses that Moeen slips out on occasion and it's clubbed over midwicket
"a flatter delivery outside off, worked to deep square leg"
"too short, played off the back foot to deep cover"
defended on the back foot
"a little wider outside off, Amla gets himself well forward and blocks"
"round the wicket, full outside off, left alone"
comes forward and drives with a skewed face to mid-off
"this nips back, takes the splice of the bat into the leg side"
huge appeal for lbw! Reiffel says not out. Amla was across his crease. England have only one review left and they turn this one down. Angling down the leg side by the looks of it. Replay says umpire's call on clipping leg
"round the wicket, full outside off, left alone"
"banged in short, defended on the back foot"
jabs forward outside off and defends
"kicks this away outside off, there was some extra bounce, just had to make sure he kept his gloves out of the way"
"well forward outside off, defended"
gets well across and pads another one away
left alone outside off
"a little wider and Amla lets another one go through, he didn't fancy playing much in that over"
"that's caused some pain! Nips back at Elgar from round the wicket. Is it glove or arm? He's not happy here. Ouch, it missed the inside edge and took the back elbow"
"full outside off, he's able to leave alone which will please him"
"makes him play this time, angling in at off stump, he stretches his arm again after playing the ball"
"full, wide outside off, a bit wasted"
"a shorter ball but again Elgar doesn't need to play, can drop the bat out of the line...he's not comfortable out there"
"full outside off, through to the keeper"
"round the wicket, full at middle and leg, defended"
"pushed down the leg side, he lets it go"
gets forward and it takes an inside edge along the ground to short leg
"nicely bowled, straighten a little on Amla whose back leg came around as he defended"
dead-bats this into the off side
"a shorter one to finish with, driven off the back foot to cover"
"outside off, in the corridor, grazing past Elgar's edge. Good start"
"on the pads, tucked to backward square to open South Africa's account this morning"
"full length, attacking the base of off, defended"
"good length, threatening to swing towards the slips, takes a thick outside edge to point"
"full again, more subtle shape through the air, defended on the crease-line"
"back of a length, holds its line, jabbed down into the cordon to complete the over"
"tight line, angling into the left-hander from round the wicket. Defended with great diligence and a full face"
"full again, really probing Elgar's defences. He's equal to the challenge and punches the ball back to the bowler"
attacking the edge from just back of a length. Fended to point with a bit of a late adjustment at the crease
"full and straight. You miss, I hit. He didn't, so Broad didn't"
over-pitched and blocked through the gap at long-off. Lovely strike
"a great riposte, but another boundary! Fuller length, kept low on off stump, and squeezed along the ground through the cordon with a desperate late flinch"
tight line on off stump. Blocked again
"back of a length, arrow-straight. Blocked back down the pitch"
"squared up in defence, pressed to mid-on"
pushed into the gap
"good lifter outside off, Elgar presents his shoulder to the ball to keep his gloves out of harm's way"
"beautiful bowling, just skims past the edge ... getting tighter and tighter in that line on off stump"
blocked into the off side
"up on the toes, and pushed back into the crease"
"full length again, pushing Amla back into the crease to block"
"tight line on off stump. There's a man back for the bouncer, but he's kept it in the locker for now"
"outside off once more, keeping Amla guessing on the length"
"another sharp delivery in the corridor outside off, Amla shoulders arms to complete the maiden"
through to the keeper
"probing line once more, swinging towards the cordon"
through to the keeper again
good length once again
cut through the covers
"edged, but safe. Stokes at third slip gets a hand on it to slow its progress, but he can't deny Elgar a  very gritty fifty"
"pushed back into the crease, fenced to backward square"
"edged, but safe again! Elgar manages to draw his bat inside the line and take the sting off another thick edge as Broad honed in on his off stump. Stokes flings himself headlong again but can't intercept"
"wide line outside off, nothing doing"
dead-batted into the off side
short and sharp
"beautiful ball, and that's surely an edge! But did it carry? England are asking the question among themselves ... but no review... nope, it reached Bairstow, but just missed the edge. Amla trapped on the crease, and Broad so nearly had his man... EDIT: <B>There was an edge!</B> Oh dear..."
through to the keeper
stabbed into the off side
through to the keeper again
"tight line from round the wicket, angling into the left-hander who keeps his bat out of harm's way"
"through to the keeper on a probing length, but a touch too wide to tempt a stroke"
"on the pads, worked into the leg side"
tapped to mid-on
"punching forward from a crouched stance, gathered in the covers"
"up on the toes, defended into the covers"
"a flying edge, and <B>dropped</B> by Anderson at gully, but it's mealy-mouthed to call it as such! Leapt with one hand, high to his left, and did well to reach it. So nearly a run-out in all the confusion as well, but Stokes' shy is wide"
through to the keeper
"on the pads, tapped to midwicket"
"a misfield from Stokes at point, and more runs to South Africa's tally"
"smashed harder, that was short and wide from Anderson, but Stokes gathers well this time"
defended into the off side
worked off the pads to short backward square. Anderson looks thoroughly cheesed off with life
angled into the left-hander from round the wicket
in the channel once more
"back of a length, flicked to midwicket"
"full length, late swing, Elgar is lured for a moment but manages not to have a lash at it. Point collects"
"full and straight, attacking off stump"
"full again, punched just past the close catcher at silly mid on"
defended back down the pitch
through to the keeper
through to the keeper
"outside off, 87mph, which is brisk but not lightning by Wood's standards"
beats the edge with late nibble off the seam. Well bowled
good probing line once again
Elgar stays well out of harm's way for this one
"on the pads, that's a poor ball with the off-side stacked. Clipped to the brink of the wide long-on rope"
"round the wicket, back of a length. Left alone"
up on the toes and dabbed to short midwicket. Stokes hustles round to gather in his followthrough
through to the keeper
"on the legs again. Elgar has taken his guard on and even outside off, so anything straight is a freebie for his clip through midwicket"
"tight on off stump, chiselled to leg"
forward and blocked down the pitch
"back of a length, keeps a touch low as Amla slides back and across to defend"
flicked off the pads to backward square
clipped to leg
"outside off, good lift into the gloves as Elgar flinches into the gully"
"bouncer, ducked"
"fenced down through the two gullies, perfectly placed and England's frustrations mount"
"round the wicket, short and sharp"
"onto the front foot, and pushed to cover"
"round the wicket, on the pads, worked square. It's pretty lifeless stuff from England at the moment, and South Africa are sitting pretty"
"raps the pad, but way outside the line of off. The ball deflects off the knee-roll and through to the keeper"
"up on the toes, blocked back down the pitch"
"dabbed down into the crease, and that is <B>drinks</B>"
"full at off stump, 87mph, nips back a touch and takes an inside edge to the leg side"
"a bouncer, very short, travels a long way over Elgar's back"
worked off the pads through the leg side
"full at off stump, pushed to the off side and that's a well-taken quick single to bring up the hundred stand"
left alone
"slashes at a wider delivery, slices it fine of gully, wasn't a catch...more runs to third man"
"full outside off, left alone"
"82mph, outside off, left alone with a shuffle"
"shorter in length, angles in but wide enough to leave alone"
"dragged down short, Elgar goes after it and pull is through midwicket, wasn't perfectly timed but hit with power"
"full at off stump, punched to mid-on"
"back over the wicket, full outside off, leaves it alone"
"full outside off, left alone"
"87mph, full outside off, Amla not interested in having a drive"
"a shorter delivery, gets underneath the pull a little and it goes in the air for a little while but it's very safe out to deep square"
"full outside off, 85mph, left alone"
"finds the outside edge, keeps it down and it runs through the gap between second slip and fine gully"
"a short ball around middle and leg, pulled behind square"
"over the wicket, a touch shorter, worked through midwicket"
plays back and drives to mid-on
tries to force this off the back foot again and it dribbles to the on side
"that's dismissive, uses his feet and then drills this in the air straight down the ground. Simple and very effective"
"over the wicket, full outside leg, defended"
flicked off the pads behind square
"goes for the off-stump yorker, it's on target and dug out"
"full length outside off, Amla gets forward and traps it into his front pad"
"short, pushed down the leg side, gets well inside the line"
"back of a length, angling into the pads, flicked to deep square leg"
"round the wicket, full outside off, left alone"
another one through to the keeper
"he comes down the pitch again, a bit more of a drag this time as he reaches a little for it from outside off and sends it over mid-on"
defended from the crease
"and he does it again! Even better this time, a lovely skip down the pitch and effortless lofted straight drive to take him to his fifty in grand manner"
"back over the wicket, defensive line outside leg, kicked away"
goes deep in the crease and whips this to midwicket where it's well fielded
"that's zinged to the boundary, full outside leg stump and Amla's quick wrists send it skimming through midwicket"
"round the wicket, a bouncer outside off, Elgar sways out of the line"
"short again, but makes him play this time, defended on his toes square of the wicket"
gets across the crease and hops behind the line of a short-of-a-length delivery...Stokes testing the middle of the pitch
"keeps it short, defended down by his feet"
"and that tactic has worked! Good effort from Stokes. Keeps it short, angled in at Elgar from round the wicket, he gets into a horrid tangle as he seems in two minds whether to pull, hook or leave and ends up splicing a catch to backward square leg"
"almost a repeat! That's hostile stuff from Stokes. A very well-directed short ball and de Kock fends it away off the glove, wide of backward square leg down to long leg"
"back of a length outside off, defended to cover"
gets across his crease and tries to work a ball from outside off to the leg side
"done it! Back-to-back wickets for England. A lovely piece of bowling. Angled across the left hander on a good length, de Kock keen to get forward and it's a thin edge to Bairstow"
"good length outside off, left alone, Bairstow takes it in front of his face...the crowd have come to life as well"
tucks a straight ball through square and the time is so good long leg can't get there in time
"well bowled, squares up the captain as he looks to work to leg and the leading edge flies into the covers"
"a short ball outside off, Amla bends his knees"
"another bouncer, angled down the leg side this time...some bodyline from Stokes"
"back of a length, perhaps keeps a fraction low, Amla able to adjust and knocks it to the off side"
"full outside off, 87mph, drives to mid-off"
"short of a length, played off his hip towards leg gully"
"short on off stump, goes for the pull but finds square leg"
works a straight delivery down to long leg
"full outside off, defended"
"a touch shorter, du Plessis tries to force it off the back foot but doesn't get his timing"
"full outside off, 84mph, left alone"
"good length, tight to off stump, defended to mid-on"
"a little wider outside off, he's happy to let it go through so close to the interval"
"short of a length outside off, defended down towards point"
"a bouncer outside off, Amla was duck as soon as that left Stokes' hand, no interest to attack it"
tucks a straighter delivery into the leg side
worked into the on side where there aren't many gaps
"nicely bowled, this is the fuller one, just outside off and it shapes back as Amla shoulders arms. Not that far from off stump"
"back of a length, at off stump, solidly behind the line"
"outside off, an exploratory line and length, no stroke offered"
left alone outside off once more
"wider on the crease, angled back into the right-hander, defended to point"
"good length again, kicks off the splice and in the air for a moment! But wide of gully, down into the ground in the end"
"fuller and straighter, punched back whence it came"
"forward and driven again, compactly played but collected at mid-off"
"short and fiery, Amla presents his chest and sways inside the line"
"fuller length, angled in, dabbed to gully with soft hands"
left alone outside off
"that's a beauty! Curls into the gloves, and past the edge, and Bairstow seemed to take that a touch awkwardly, on the left thumb maybe? He'll live"
full and straight again. Stokes is looking lively as Amla defends
"deep in the crease, goes back and across to present the full face of the bat"
"angling in, left alone on length. Good judgement"
"outside off, holds its line, and du Plessis is lured into a loose waft outside off!"
"defended on the back foot, back to the bowler"
"another inswinger, another beauty, slides over the top of the stumps as du Plessis leaves again"
"plays late, as Anderson gathers off his own bowling"
"defended again as Jennings gathers in the gully. A fine, probing over"
down the leg side
"another leg-sided one, shorter length this time. A bit of a nothing ball"
short and through to the keeper
"tight defence on off stump, blocked to cover"
"pushed back into the crease, defended with a vertical bat"
"angled in, blocked away to cover"
worked off the hip to backward square
"shoulders arms, tight to off stump"
"no great footwork, just a dab into the off side"
"on the pads, that's a gimme. Amla takes it with aplomb, a wristy flick through backward square"
"that is the reply of a class bowler. Nipping off the seam outside off, swinging wickedly late and into the gloves. 85mph that one, with extra bounce. Beauty"
"left alone on the angle, back in towards off stump"
"wide on the crease, good line and length, through to the keeper"
"banged in short, Amla isn't tempted"
"short, flashed through midwicket"
"onto the back foot, meeting the late inswing with a compact block"
"good lift outside off, left alone with gloves raised high"
"line and length, left alone"

"banged in short, pulled backward of square"
blotted into the off side
through to the keeper outside off
"way wide of off stump, very full length. No stroke"
"short, but not very short, and du Plessis has a slightly curious waft from a good length, and bottom-edges into his body"
"up on the toes, punched to point"
worked into the leg-side from an off-stump line. A scampered single
"up on the toes, poked to point. Wood tumbles in his followthrough, and grimaces ... he's up, I think"
"in he comes again, outside off, and through to the keeper"
defended back down the pitch
worked to midwicket with a roll of the wrists
"back of a length, defended again"
deliberately steered into the on-side
"short, boshed to midwicket"
"full length, outside off, a bit floaty, but ignored"
"full again, outside off, dabbed to point"
"through to the keeper on a full length again. Seems like a deliberate ploy, but no drawing the swipe just yet"
"back of a length, worked square"
"back of a length, defended round the corner, right up on the toes"
"banged in short, Amla wears it on the bicep as Wood ends up face-down in his followthrough!"
"short, Amla limbos inside the line"
"on the pads, flicked behind square"
"glided into the covers off the back foot, that's sweetly timed and placed. No stopping that!"
"flinched into the leg side, a sharp lifter into the gloves"
"short, uncomfortably thumped into the leg side, crouching into the pull as if the ball didn't get up as expected"
"forward to the full length, crouching defence"
stands taller and blocked from the crease
"sharp pace, through to the keeper"
forward and driven compactly through mid-off. Another fine strike
"on the back foot this time, punched on the up to Moeen at mid-off"
through to the keeper once more
"strikes Amla on the bicep with a bouncer, then ends up flat on his face on the turf. Wood is all action"

"round the wicket, short again, Amla ducks"
short and flicked past short leg for another single
"full length, zeroing in on the stumps, defended on the back foot"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
blocked back down the pitch

"back and right across in front of his stumps, defends to the leg side"
"he's got him again! Big shout for lbw and Root called for the <b>review</b>. Given not out by Paul Reiffel. Amla a long way down the pitch as he used his feet, missed his whip across the line of the delivery. Height certainly not an issue. And it's straightened enough! Smashing middle stump"

more circumspect push to mid-on
"outside off, no stroke offered"
"thumped in the air, to wide mid-off! That's a careless way to go with the new ball imminent. Bavuma looking to stay positive, but scuffed his lofted drive straight to Root. An opening for England, or just a stay of execution?"

defended back down the line of the ball
"outside off, through to the keeper once more"
"sharp bounce off the seam, takes the bat handle, and short leg would have guzzled that..."
a swish down the leg side.
"huge appeal, but that's done too much, surely? Broad wants it, but Root thinks there's bat involved. Either way, booming inswing"

"very full, hint of inswing. Blocked"
worked into the gap
on the hips and flicked up and over the leg side

"full and straight, defended"
"back of a length outside off, played into the covers"

what happened here? Skids down the leg side and wrong-foots Bairstow...kept low and jagged off the seam. More good signs for South Africa

"not so full, and it's straighter, defended to the leg side"
that's another nice piece of timing as he flicks behind square on the leg side
"well, this is strange...the umpire has called dead ball as this deflects as Morris' thigh pad wide of Bairstow to the fine leg boundary. Think that's harsh, he's tried to flick it away"
"this spins from outside off, takes the bottom edge into the pads"

flicked to midwicket
"plays back, works a straight delivery into the deep"
"comes down the pitch, miscues it over the off side, slices across the shot a little but falls safely over cover"

"plays back, beats the outside edge with one that goes straight one"
leans forward and defends to cover
"super catch at long-on! Broad has made excellent ground to gather that. Maharaj used his feet, tried to clear the straight boundary but it didn't have the legs. Broad ran around from long on, then dived full length to his left. Top effort late in the day"

pushed back down the pitch
touch more air on this one and it's driven firmly into the covers
"back of a length outside off, defended to mid-on"

props forward and pushes into the point area
"that's good connection, swings through the line and sends this high over mid-on"
"and now he's down the pitch, doesn't quite reach the ball so drags it through midwicket"
now it's Vern's turn! Gets down on his knee and fetches this from outside off with a huge slog-sweep which lands in the crowd at deep midwicket
"changes to round the wicket, but it goes in the same direction. Another slog sweep, slightly squarer this time, again into the crowd"
"fired wide across outside off, crunched back along the pitch"
"goes for another slog sweep, takes the toe and Moeen snaffles the return catch. That brings the <B>declaration</b>"
"given first ball! But Cook <B>reviews</b> straightaway. Full, is it going down on the angle? Cook has played right across it. Maybe the new-ball bounce is an issue, too. Yes, going over! Paul Reiffel has to reverse another decision"
"now he beats the edge! Morkel is on it. Angles in from round the wicket, just back of a length, Cook feels he has to play and it nibbles past the bat"
"fuller, outside off, Cook forces himself forward and defends to mid-on"
"full, outside off at 86mph, he's able to leave this one alone"
"nice delivery, it's full outside off and comes back quite sharply as Cook shoulders arms...good judgement to be fair to Cook"
"gets onto the front foot, defends a full delivery to the covers. What a demanding opening over."
"over the wicket, outside off and wide enough to leave"
"finds the outside edge! But falls short of gully. Back of a length at off stump, touch of extra bounce, makes him play"
"plays this very late, a jabbing shot at a length ball outside off and it runs towards point"
"tight leave! Shapes back from outside off, Jennings lifts his bat high out of the line and the ball was threatening off stump"
"fuller, at off stump, again requiring a stroke from Jennings who defends"
"well bowled again, a touch shorter, nips back off the seam and takes an inside edge into his pads. Top bowling"
"round the wicket, full outside off, left alone"
"touch too wide, a comfortable one to leave alone"
"makes him play, full and straight, defended towards point"
"aims full at the stumps again, just angles into the pads and it deflects down to fine leg...an extra that brings a huge cheer from the crowd late on this Sunday afternoon"
"full at off stump, he plays this well with a solid defensive shot on the front foot"
"big appeal for lbw and this time Reiffel says not out! No review from South Africa. Was full, but struck Jennings above the knee roll and was heading leg side on the angle"
"massive appeal for lbw! Not out by Simon Fry this time. Pitches on the stumps and straightens. Above the knee roll, again, and Faf du Plessis signals height is the reason he doesn't review. Hawk Eye says going over"
"good length, straight, defended into midwicket"
"full at off stump, he gets forward with bat and pad together"
"full outside off, draws him forward and finds a thick outside edge but played with soft hands into gully"
"gets himself forward, blocks a good-length ball into the covers"

"angled in towards off stump, left alone"
"full outside off, he comes forward and punches into the covers, a bit of a fumble means the second is comfortable"
"full at middle and off, 78mph, hint of late swing in and defended to mid-off"
"slightly shorter, defended on the back foot"
"edged! But doesn't carry to third slip. A probing line at off stump, Jennings reluctant to get forward and it's a thick edge but well short of Kuhn"
"through him! That's the first one. Wonderful bowling from Philander. On off stump, nips back to scoot past the inside edge and the off peg is uprooted. Jennings stuck on the crease"
"well bowled, full at middle with a hint of nibble, defended back down the pitch"
"full outside off, left alone"
through to the keeper
"keeps it full outside off, Cook doesn't need to play"
"short of a length, touch too wide, left alone"
"makes him play this time, fuller at off stump, forced through midwicket as the face closes and he's off the mark from his 22nd delivery"
"and again, similar ball and a repeat shot, squeezed through midwicket off the front foot"
"back of a length, outside off, left alone"
"makes him play, at off stump, slides off the face towards gully"
"a shorter delivery at off stump, defended on the back foot"
"a demanding line and length, at off stump, takes a think inside edge into the pad, but falls to ground rather than carrying to short leg"
"full outside off, gets part-way forward, the ball takes a thick outside edge into the ground and through gully. There hasn't been much out of the middle this morning"
"and now this keeps a little low, back of a length at middle, he's able to bring the draw bridge down in time"
"full outside off, jabs forward and plays to the on side"
"a bigger stride into the ball this time, driven to the covers"
"full, a little wider outside off at 84mph, left alone"
"across to off stump, a solid defensive block on the front foot"
"gets too straight this time, flicked off the pads down to long leg"
"jeepers, that's hurt him! A rearing short ball at off stump, wasn't a full on bouncer, it climbed at Ballance from short of a length and jams into his bottom hand. He does very well to keep it down"
"short of a length at off stump, defended to cover"
"short of a length outside off, opens the face through backward point"
"full at the stumps, defended to the off side"
"hint of shape back in at Ballance from outside off, left alone"
"full and straight, a solid front-foot block to mid-off"
"that's a good leave - or a tight one - it's back of a length, fractionally outside off, and bends back"
"back of a length from round the wicket, he hops into line"
"flies wide of gully! Another terrific delivery, short of a length angling in at Cook who gets squared up as he brings the bat across at a bit of angle and the outside edge just evades the leaping gully"
"this one climbs through from a full length, de Kock takes it above his head"
"that's a top shot, fully in control this time as he comes into the front foot to a full delivery and drives through the covers"
"fired down the leg side, and it's a superb take from de Kock one-handed high to his right"
"excellent follow-up from Morkel, nips back in at Ballance from a fuller length and takes him high on the pad. Eventually du Plessis calls for the <b>review</b> after Reiffel says not out. Umpire's call on height"
"gets on leg stump, flicked off the pads very fine past the keeper...actually no bat involved, just pad"
defended from off stump to the covers
"full outside off, Cook reaches forward and defends with an open face to backward point"
opens the face and steers this square of the wicket
"two down! another big appeal for lbw. Simon Fry has a long think and then shakes his head. Time is almost up and Faf <B>reviews</b>. Back of a length, did it pitch on leg stump?. Height certainly not an issue, on the shin, as it skidded through. It's gone! Pitches on leg stump, straightens, and is smashing leg stump. Excellent review from the skipper"
"more movement off the seam, back of a length and nips back at Root to cut him in half and take him high on the back leg. Package this spell"
"full outside off, left alone"
worked off the stumps to deep square leg
"full, wide outside off, left alone"
"full outside off, gets onto the front foot and defends to cover"
"edged, but short of second slip! At off stump, he has to play, it's a thick edge but dies in front of the slips"
"short of a length and this one climbs through outside, those two balls illustrate why it's tricky for the slips to know where to stand"
"leading edge, falls short of mid-off! Blimey, this is tough. A short of a length delivery, Cook closes the face as he aims to the leg side"
"full at off stump, defended with a straight bat"
"gets forward on off stump, traps it off the inside edge into the front pad"
"feeling for this outside off, it runs off the face wide of third slip who is so close he's wearing a helmet"
"that's a good piece of timing off the pads, worked through midwicket"
"short of a length outside off, played off the back foot into the covers"
"a bouncer, 83mph, Root ducks"

onto the front foot and pushed back down the pitch
"driven off a thick outside-edge. Streaky, but they all count!"
"that's a stunning delivery! And listen to the silence around Trent Bridge! The air has been sucked out as if Root was Sachin and this was the Wankhede ... a searing outswinging yorker, pitching in the blockhole and bursting past the edge of a desperate lunge to pluck out off stump!"
"welcome to the crease, sharp lift over the top of off"
"on the toes, clipped to leg"

more solid block
big stride and blocked
"round the wicket, firm prod into the covers"

stretches well forward and defends into the big space in the off side

gets inside the line of a shorter delivery and plays to the on side
a bouncer which angles back at Stokes but he's able to pull his bat inside the line
"goodness me, what a ball! This is a spitting, rearing, nasty bouncer which follows Stokes as he tries to sway out of the line and hammers into his top glove. The ball falls to ground, as does Stokes but he's okay"
"full outside off, has his wits about him enough to get forward and drive to mid-off"
"short of a length at off stump, 86mph, defended to the off side"
pads this away outside off
beats the outside edge as he tries to drive out of the rough stuff
defended
"wider outside off, left alone"
plays forward and did this pop off the inside edge? Loops wide of short leg. Might have just been pad
props forward into the off side
this travels over off stump as Stokes shoulders arms
"that's a good shot, a well-controlled pull as he got over the ball but there's a man on the deep midwicket boundary"

"another good bouncer, angled in from round the wicket and sways out of the line"
worked off the pads behind square on the leg side
"full outside off, left alone"
"that's a strong drive, gets well forward and takes this from out of the footmarks straight of mid-off"
"good reply from Maharaj, this one goes straight on outside off, a little quicker, and skims past the edge"
"sweeps this from well outside of, was right across his crease, sends it through short fine leg"
plays back and defends to short leg
"back and across, blocks"
"nicely bowled, fuller and slower, drips and spins to beat Stokes inside edge into his pads"

a bouncer which he ducks
"short of a length outside off, left alone"
angled down the leg side
"fuller at off stump, 85mph, defended to the covers"
"full outside off, this nips away off the seam and Moeen makes a late decision to leave"
played off the back foot with a straight bat down to long-on
"swept from full outside off, nicely controlled and well placed to bisect the two men in the deep"
"and this time he gets forward to drive through the covers, nicely to the pitch"
"now he sweeps again, gets it past short fine leg to make it three boundaries in a row...Moeen's not blocking it"
"wider outside off, left alone"
"there's another sweep from outside off, finds deep square this time"
plays a length ball into midwicket
"full outside off, driven to mid-off"

"that's a good ball from Philander after seeing Stokes come down the pitch, bangs it in short over off stump"
"wide outside off, 77mph, left alone"
"given caught behind but Moeen <B>reviews</b> straightaway. We'll need Ultra Edge for this one. Playing back to a slightly shorter ball. There is a small mark and, remember, was given out in the field. A very thin tickle if there is one. Well, third umpire says there's 'nothing' on Ultra Edge and Moeen survives."
"sweeps from outside off to deep square leg, they actually go back upstairs to check for a run out as Moeen comes back for a second but he's very safe"
"gone this time! No doubt this time. Another attacking shot, goes for the sweep, and picks out the man at square leg. Another good field-placing from du Plessis. Did Moeen know he was there?"
"round the wicket, full and straight, defended"
"steps back and cuts this off the stumps to point, risky shot"
almost drives too early and this one and isn't far from spooning a catch to short cover
moves across outside off and works into midwicket

"outside off, no stroke offered"
"round the wicket, attacking the off stump, blocked to cover"
"speared out to cover, off the back foot"

guided down to long-off for a single
"down on the sweep, lots of noise behind the stumps but that was well enough connected behind square"
swept to backward square
"fully forward, blocked to cover"
"aha, Broad obliges. Another pitiful dismissal, greeted with an empty, exasperated groan from a very dischuffed crowd. A big yawning slog sweep, a simple hole-out to Morkel at deep midwicket, who barely had to flinch to get into position for the take"
fully forward and blocked
"he can you know! Back of a length, angled into the body, Wood rises on his toes, splices a thick edge, low to the gully!"
"outside off, two in two. Game over! A flimsy poke to an off-stump lifter, and de Kock completes an utterly crushing win"
