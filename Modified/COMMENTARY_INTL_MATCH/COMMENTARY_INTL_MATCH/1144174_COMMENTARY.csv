"slower ball, straight at him, and he flicks this, but it goes straight towards the leg gully. Bowled at just <strong>108kph</strong>"

"length ball, a bit of bounce as it straightens into him, and he has to defend this"
"short, and outside off, and he runs this down towards third man. Thisara Perera does well to pick this up quickly and release it fast"

"length ball, angles across, and he launches into a <strong>gorgeous cover drive</strong>. All timing this, as he leans into it, and beats mid off comfortably"
"slower ball, angles across him, and he bunts this one to point. Just 100kph!"
"fuller, slower, and he comes forward looking to drive, but is deceived by the lack of pace. It goes across him and dies on its way through to the keeper"
"slower ball, pitched up, and he drives hard, but gets it back to Udana, who fields it after half-stopping it the first time"
"length ball, straightens and takes the outside edge as he shapes to flick. Stays down as it rolls to point"
"length ball, that he defends to short midwicket"

"length, angles into him, and he drops it towards mid on with soft hands, and calls immediately for a quick single"

"length, and he goes back in his crease and cuts this hard, but cannot beat point"
"uses his feet to get to a length ball, and he swings this around the long leg fence. It travels <em>high</em>, and far enough. All the way into the stands. <strong>First six</strong> of the match"
"slower ball, outside off, he taps this towards covers and sets off. A direct hit at the striker's end could have had Hendricks in trouble, but the shy doesn't get the stumps"
"length ball, outside off, and he plays this with an open face of the bat down to third man"
"length, and he has looked to go towards midwicket, but skewed this straight up. Malinga takes the catch, moving across from mid on. <b>Some extra pace and bounce in this ball does Markram in</b>"

"slower ball, and he cuts it away towards point"
"short ball, and he goes back and swings this towards long leg. Bowled at <strong>125kph</strong>"
"short, and he goes back and punches this towards short cover. The man there cannot gather at one go, and it allows them to sneak through for a quick single"
"short ball, and this time he leans back and smashes it past the man at short midwicket. Wasn't slow by design (123kph) but he dragged the length back, and it sat up and asked to be hit"
"short, comes into him, <strong>133kph</strong>, and he drives this towards short midwicket"
"punches a length ball towards covers, and the man there misfields. The batsman had come halfway down the track and wasn't sure of which way to turn next! There was a runout opportunity missed, as the fielder let it through"

"length ball, turns away from him, and beats his outside edge. Dickwell whips the bails off, but he was in all the time"

"tossed up, and he goes for a big shot again. Takes the outer edge of the bat, and runs towards extra cover"
"length, outside off, ane he drives this towards backward point"
"starts with a slower ball, that cuts back into him. Hits him on the pad, and Malinga has a shout for leg-before. Turned down, and he has <strong>referred this immediately</strong>. Seems to have pitched straight, and then could have just been going down leg side. No inner edge, but the angle takes the ball down. <strong>Sri Lanka lose that review as well</strong>"
"slower ball, and he gets this away towards deep midwicket with a flick"
"slower ball, outside off, and he drives this towards mid off"
"short, and he goes back and cuts this. Gets it past point, and there's no protection behind him. Well timed this, but a bad ball, really"

"length ball, and he picks it up outside off and flicks this down towards midwicket"

"tossed up, outside off, and he looks to drive this but cannot get any timing on it"
"short ball, and he goes back and drags a pull down towards long on"
"fuller, and he goes back to drive this. It turns away and beats his outside edge. May have taken a feather-edge, in fact, but Dickwella cannot hold on"

"shorter, and he goes back and nurdles this away towards deep backward square leg"
"length, and he just extends his arms, uses his reach, and thrashes this down between long on and midwicket. <strong>Terrific timing on that</strong>!"
"fuller, on his pads, and he flicks this away towards midwicket. Wants two, but will have to make do with just one"
"full toss, outside off, and he drags this down towards long off"
"slower ball, and he looks to flick this away, but cannot beat square leg"
"full ball, and Pretorius can only play this back to him. <strong>Excellent bowling</strong>"

"full ball, outside off, and he drives this firmly down towards long off"
"full toss, and he has played this straight towards point. <strong>It goes in...and out!</strong> Dhananjaya de Silva is guilty of this mistake, as he just failed to hold on as he turned"
"short, and he goes back and cuts it towards backward point. They run hard, and make this two. Superb running"

"short, and he goes back and drives this towards deep extra cover"
"goes for the cut,and misses out"
"down the pitch, and smashes this inside out over extra cover. He has pulverized this one!"
"got him this time! Goes for a slog sweep to a fuller ball, which turns into him with the angle and hits three-quarters of the way up leg stump. Missed it completely, but it's been an enterprising effort on what looked like a difficult pitch, especially early on"
"full toss, 131kph, outside off, and he drops this straight back down the ground. <strong>Hit firm, and straight</strong>!"
"fuller, wider, and he looks to go straight, but this has taken the outside edge and run down to third man for four. <strong>Fifty for Pretorius</strong>!"
"straight ball, and he wanted to go straight back with it too, but the outside edge carries it fine towards third man. Goes all the way for four. Lakmal stands, stroking his chin. When it rains..."
"<strong>survives a tough chance</strong>! Fuller ball, that stops on him as he shapes to go leg side. Takes the outer edge and flies towards cover, but the fielder just about cannot reach it, low to his left!"
"angles across, and he looks to go down the ground. Outer edge carries it towards third man"
"full, wide and he runs this down towards third man"
"full toss along leg stump, and he flogs this away on the onside. Kept both deep backward square leg and deep midwicket interested, but neither of them can pull this back"

"fuller ball, and he whips this away towards deep midwicket"

"length, and he goes back and forces this towards long off"
"full toss, and he whips this away towards deep backward square leg"
"slower ball, at the stumps, Duminy picks it up and gently pushes it towards long on. Lakmal has to run into his left and pick it up, and fails to pick up cleanly. They go through for the second"
"yorker, well bowled. Duminy turns down Pretorius, who had run all the way to the other end. <strong>Incredibly, he has enough time to recover his ground</strong>. Malinga needed to get to that ball quicker, and someone needed to get to the stumps too!"
"seeks the yorker, but too full, and Duminy has whipped this away, wide to the right of fine leg"
"short ball, slower through the air, and he smashes this through midwicket. Swivel-pull, and timed perfectly because he picked this <strong>114kph ball </strong>early"
"fuller, and he drives this straight over mid off. Terrific shot, and good awareness of the field around him"
"wide down the leg side, as he looks for the yorker. Length was almost perfect, but the line was poor"

"full ball, down the leg side, and he whips this off his feet towards square leg"
"short, and he looks to hook this. Called a wide, as it went over his head standing up. Udana not convinced. That had good pace, but just a bit too much elevation"
"full, just outside off, and he looks to run this down past short fine leg, but can only inside edge this on to his feet and then towards short third man. Not picked up clean, but he can't go through for the second"
"short, slower ball, and he looks to force this down the wicket, but can't. Well bowled! Not the length that Pretorius expected"
"fuller, angles across him, and he drags an attempted slog down the ground towards midwicket"
"full ball, outside off, and he has hit this flat through midwicket. <strong>FOR SIX!</strong> This was an amazing shot, just for how flat and far he hit a perfectly good ball. Perhaps just a touch shorter than he needed to be"
"length again, and he has hit this deep into the midwicket fence. 12 off the last two overs has rescued a tidy over up to that point. <strong>South Africa are in sight of crossing 200</strong>"
"fuller ball, 133kph, and he fails to get any timing on an attempted slog through midwicket. Played it on to his pads, as it dropped away towards short third man"
"fuller, and he makes room to go past point, but can only play it straight to him"
"full ball, but ends up being a full toss, and he heaves this away towards midwicket. To the right of backward square leg, and hit <strong>firmly enough</strong>"
"slower ball, that he picks up as it angles across him, and just drops it towards midwicket"

"length, and he goes back and punches this to point"
"fuller ball, and he drives this towards mid off, who gets across to cut it off quickly"
"full ball, and he shapes to go for a ramp shot down the leg side. Looks good, but only if you pull it off. Gets an inside edge on to the leg, as he topples over!"
"shorter, and he flicks this away towards one of the deep men, down at deep backward square leg"
"fuller ball, a hint of shape into him at <strong>133kph</strong>, and he defends"
"fuller ball. and he defends this, bowled at <strong>138kph</strong>, just on off stump"
"terrific innovation from Dickwella! He comes down the wicket, and Dala follows him. He just chops it between slip and gully down to third man"
"short, and he can back away and go over the infield towards extra cover. <b>Top shot again!</b>"
"fuller, towards leg stump and he's able to ease this towards midwicket. There's a slight misfield from the man at mid on backing up, but it only costs them one more"
"short, and he whips it as it comes into him, but cannot beat short midwicket"
"short, into him, and he gets up on his toes and whips this away towards square leg"
"length ball, outside off, and he eases this past point. <strong>Terrific square drive</strong>, and placed very well"
"fuller, outside off, and he eases into a cover drive, and Phehlukwayo cuts this off away to his left at cover. Would have gone for four had he missed this, for sure!"
"fuller, but down the leg side, and he will have to rebowl this"
"length, angles into him at 140kph, and he flicks this away towards long leg. They ease through for one, where two <em>could</em> have been available with some hustling"
"fuller, slower and he backs away and then runs it down past the wide slip stationed for him now. Down to third man for four"
"fuller, and he flicks this away towards a wide mid on"
"length, outside off, and he runs this down towards third man"
"short, just outside off, and he gets up on his toes, and beautifully guides this down to the fence between point and gully. <strong>What a shot!</strong>"
"starts with a wide, way outside off. Dhananjaya chases it down but cannot meet it as he looks to thrash it through point"
"short, and just outside off, and he slashes it away towards third man. Shamsi does well to move swiftly to his left and keep it down to just one"
"full, and slower, and he has picked this one. Smashes this over midwicket. Attempted knuckle-ball, but he picked this early"
"fuller, and this time he whips it away towards long leg"
"short, and little quicker, as it comes into him, and he goes back to defend this"
"short, wide...too wide, outside off. Dhananjaya had another almighty bash at that, but missed!"
"full, outside off, and he drives this gracefully. Gets it towards wide long off"
"down the leg side, and he has flicked this away towards fine leg. Given leg-byes, but they all count"
"strikes with his very first ball. Gets a ball to just angle back in, and Dhananjaya is caught inside the crease, as he shapes to flick. <strong>What a day Dwaine Pretorius is having!</strong>"
"length ball, angles into him, and he flicks this away towards long leg"
"slower ball, angles across him, off-cutter, and he plays it gently towards short cover"
"backs away and drop kicks a length ball aimed around off stump, and gets it over and above point. Good innovation to create some room where none existed!"
"<strong>clever!</strong> Short ball, and he just waits for it, and then runs it over the keeper for four"
"punches a length ball through covers, and Duminy does well to keep it down to three. Superb bit of timing again from Dickwella, who has brought up the Sri Lankan fifty in a canter"
"ooh...slower ball outside off, and he looks to go down the ground, but misses. Also didn't miss off stump by much"
"will be called wide down the leg side, as he slides a length ball down his pads"
"<strong>sharp catch taken behind the wicket!</strong> It was angled into Dickwella, who was looking to move away again, but just took the top part of the blade, or perhaps the glove, and moved away to the left of Qeshile, who was already shaping to move to his right. He adjusts quickly, and pouches this. Phehlukwayo pumps his fists, as South Africa remove a man who was taking the game to them in some style"
"length ball, angles across him,and he drops it down towards short cover and steals a quick single"
"short, and he will have to rebowl this"
"length ball, and he drives this on the up towards point, but Markram cuts it off diving away to his right"
"length ball, comes back into him, and he's given leg before. Will they think of reviewing this? Avishka is told that he has taken too much time to make his mind up. <strong>Two in the over for Phehlukwayo. Is he swinging this South Africa's way decisively?</strong> Strikes Avishka in the crease as it cuts back into him. Poor choice of shot, and no footwork really to go with it"
"full ball, outside off, and he has struck this firmly down the ground"
"length ball, and he looks to flick this, but it has taken the leading edge and gone straight up...David Miller takes it at short midwicket"
"short ball, and he backs away and cuts this towards point"
"short, and he looks to go down the ground, but misses out on contact completely. Bowled quicker and got some good bounce too"

"fuller, length, moving away from him at <strong>139kph</strong>, and he looks to go down the ground but misses the ball"
"short, just outside off, and he is caught between wanting to cut and run it down towards third man. Bowled at 142kph. <strong>Good comeback over from Dala</strong>. Just a streaky boundary, to go with a wicket"
"tosses the first ball up, and Perera punches this towards cover. A slight misfield at short cover allows him a single"
"tossed up, and he flicks this with the turn towards backward square leg"
"wrong 'un, comes back into him from outside off, and he goes back and cuts it towards the right of backward point. Enables them to pick up two"
"short, outside off, and he plays this with the turn to punch it away towards backward point. Pretorius dives away to his right and cuts this off. Saves two"
"short, wide, and Perera is disappointed that he can only pick up one with a punch off the backfoot"
"turns back sharply into him, bowled at <strong>88kph</strong>, and he gets a little inside edge on to his pads. Shamsi has a quick appeal and then goes on to collect his cap"
"short ball, angles into him at <strong>138kph</strong>, and he is forced to defend this off the back foot"
"fuller ball, on the pads, and he flicks this away. A slight misfield at deep midwicket, but they settle for just the single"
"short, and he uses his wrists to just flick this around the corner. <strong>Terrific bit of timing</strong>, as he used the pace on that short ball to drag it to the long leg fence!"
"<strong>top catch this time!</strong> It was a short, quick ball from Dala that Perera looked to hammer down the ground. Got the lower part of the bat, but Miller at long on runs around to his left, takes this over his shoulder, and hangs on despite going down to ground, perilliously close to the boundary skirting"
"down the leg side, and will be called wide. Was looking to cramp Perera for room, but overdoes the line"
"short ball, angles into him at <strong>144kph</strong>, and Udana ducks into this. Might have hit him on the inside of the left armpit."
"fast, and short again, and he looks to biff this away on the onside. Top-edges it, but it lands safely beyond the reach of short midwicket. Practices a more elegant pull after completing one for that ball"

""
"length ball, outside off, and he has slogged this over long off for six. <strong>Udana checks in to the house in style!</strong>"
"length ball, and he flogs this down the ground over mid off. Duminy turns it back, and Miller follows up to ensure they can just go back for the second and no more"
"shorter ball, and he goes across the line looking to hoick it over midiwcket. It goes to Hendricks, who has hit the stumps at the non-striker's end. What a bit of fielding! Perera is gone! Hendricks wasn't too sure if he had had beaten Perera's attempt at stretching back, but it has just clipped the base of the stumps on time"
"length ball, and he has hoicked this across through midwicket. .<strong>That's gone about 12 rows back!</strong>"
"length ball, and he zings this over midwicket, a bit more square, but <strong>huge distance on this again</strong>!"
"length again, and he flicks this over midwicket"
"tossed up, and he drives this down towards long off"

"length ball, he moves away, and goes inside out. <strong>One bounce</strong> into the extra cover fence"
"fuller, and follows him as he backs away. He can only get it down to long on"
"short, and he looks to get this away on the on side. Top edge that carries it limply towards short fine leg"
"length, angles into him, and he has a mighty swing, but misses out"
"tossed up, and he looks to play the reverse sweep. Strikes him, but possibly outside the line. Shamsi wanted to appeal this, but no review asked for"

"tossed up, goes from outside off and turns further away. Dananjaya attempts a slog sweep, but misses"
"flighted, around leg stump, turning away, and he plays it softly towards short cover and sets off"
"wrong 'un, pitches on leg and angles across him. He tentatively pokes at it, and it runs off the egde towards short third man"

"full toss, way outside off, and also called a no-ball because of being a full toss above waist height. Fair call, it seems"
"slower ball, starts outside off, and stays outside the tramlines"
"length, and he has gone inside out. <strong>All the way for six</strong>! A few more of these, please..."
"outside off, and he has gone long, but <strong>not long enough</strong>! David Miller picks up a catch at the extra cover fence, and it looked like it was heading for six all the way. A slight change up in pace, bowled from the side of the hand, and Udana gave it the proverbial kitchen-sink. It sailed flat and seemed headed for going over the skirting, but Miller would have none of it. Held it and balanced himself beautifully!"
"full ball, across him outside off, and he misses on contact"
"angles into him, and he misses with a hoick across the line again. Quicker, and beat him for pace"
"fuller ball, and he tries to go down the ground, but only hits it on to the field right in front of him. No timing on this"
"gets another one! <strong>Four for Phehlukwayo</strong> with another change-up, tossed up outside off stump, and Malinga takes the bait to try and go inside out. Goes straight to Morris, who was 15 yards inside the extra cover fence and didn't have to move much to grab on"
"across the line, and goes high up in the air, with Hendricks covering good ground in from long on to take the catch. Was a length ball, but just climbed a bit on him as he looked to hoick this across midwicket. Never got any timing on this, and looped it up in the air"
"length, <strong>close to the stumps</strong>, as Lakmal swings...and misses"
"fuller, outside off, <strong>134kph</strong>, and he swings and misses again"
"<strong>GOT HIM!</strong> South Africa win the series 3-0 with a 45 run win on DLS, as Sipamla hits the top of off stump with a perfect good length ball. Another heave-ho from Lakmal, and he probably only came back into the same city as the bowler, but not any closer than that. Comprehensive win for South Africa again as the two teams shake hands out in the middle"
