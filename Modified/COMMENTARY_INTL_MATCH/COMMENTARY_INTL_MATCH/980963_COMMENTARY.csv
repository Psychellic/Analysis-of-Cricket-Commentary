"lots of inswing to bring the ball towards Uthappa, he leans forward and pushes it into the covers"
"still outside off but no swing this time, Uthappa reaches out and sends a thick edge to third man to get off the mark"
"pretty straight and full, GG drives it back and comes out of the crease. Sandeep stops with his right hand and throws the ball back"
comes down the pitch and steers the ball with the angle to cover point
"nice swing outside off to take the ball away from Gambhir, he waits and steers towards third man but first slip dives and stops it"
"just back of length on the off stump, Gambhir defends it on off and takes off for a quick single. Maxwell runs in from backward point to kick the ball towards the stumps but misses. He thinks it was very close"
"starts with a length delivery angling away from Gambhir, he helps it to point"
"bit too short and Gambhir pounces on that by punching it square of the wicket, off the backfoot, and beats the fielders for four"
"on length and outside off, Gambhir helps it to point this time"
"nips the ball in a tad from back of length, Gambhir closes the face of the bat to leg for one"
back of length to Uthappa this time and he defends it down to mid-on for one
"too full now, Gambhir cashes in on that too. Opens up, leans forward and drives that through the covers for four more!"
"defends the ball to point for a quick one, the fielder has a shy at non-striker's end but misses. Almost led to overthrows"
"bit short on the stumps, Gambhir hops on the back foot to defend"
"beats him outside off! Took it away from Gambhir with the angle, he tried to cut and missed"
"bit too short on the leg side, can't bowl to Gambhir there. He lifted his front leg a bit and pull-swatted that behind square on leg right in the gap"
"drives the ball late on the off side, straight to Maxwell at backward point"
"this one is even shorter on the leg side, fine leg is in, and Gambhir pivots on the back foot to send that flying over fine leg for four more! Poor bowling and put away in style"
"still too short and four more! Just back of length on off, Uthappa leans into it instead of going back and drives it behind square in the gap"
"better delivery - on length on the off stump, Uthappa pushes it down to mid-off for one"
"on the leg stump, Gambhir closes the face of the bat to send it to long leg for one"
another quick single and Miller misses the stumps at bowler's end after Uthappa pushes the ball to mid-on
"slow offcutter on the off stump, Gambhir spots it and pushes into the covers for one"
another single as Uthappa pushes the ball down the ground before Miller cuts it off at mid-on. He hits the stumps at the keeper's end though
"angling in from outside off, Uthappa turns it to deep midwicket for one"
"well outside off, Gambhir cuts the ball but finds backward point"
"slightly closer to off, Gambhir makes room to cut again but finds point this time"
"fuller outside off, Gambhir drives it straight to cover now"
"pitches it shorter on leg, Gambhir goes back and gets an inside edge to square leg"
"just outside off, Uthappa goes back to turn it to leg but it seemed like the ball stopped on him. Missed"
"bit short on the stumps, Gambhir slogs and finds midwicket"
outside off now and Gambhir drives it nicely with the angle to sweeper cover

"tossed up outside off, driven to cover"
"shorter outside off, some turn for Swapnil, and Uthappa helps it towards cover point for one"

drives the length delivery with the turn to cover
makes a bit of room and turns the ball to the leg side with soft hands for two this time
goes in the crease to wait and then steers the ball to point
"fullish on middle and leg now, flicks it easily off the pad and gets two more between long-on and deep midwicket"
"oh this one's gone flying over long-off! It was pitched up a little, Uthappa reached out and drove it inside out on the off side! That goes a long way and over the leaping long-off fielder for the first six of the match"
"drags it down, but there is protection at deep midwicket. Gambhir pulls hard, but on a slow pitch timing is a problem. I wonder if it was Swapnil's variation - the one that jerks the other way."
"quicker and shorter on off stump, steered past point"
rushes down the track - and he had to considering this was on a length at 98 kph - driven to long-off
"tries to open the face to drive the ball through extra cover, but Maxwell cuts across to his right and keeps it to a single"
and that is the variation - pitched short and jerked away from the left-hander. Gambhir was shaping for the pull but he ends up having to reach for the ball and mis-hits to long-off
doesn't matter which way it spins if he can't pitch the ball. Nearly waist high full toss swung away over the square leg boundary

goes short and Uthappa pulls to deep square leg

driven through cover point for a single
"shortish on off stump, picked away through midwicket"
goes back and whips a flatter delivery to long-on
"lovely pull from Gambhir, and equally good work from Vohra on the square leg boundary.  Flat and on the pads, Gambhir gets his hands low and hammers it away"
"fired in outside off, Gambhir had set up for the leg side slog too early and has to go with it. Ends up hitting the ball back to the bowler"
shovels a full delivery from the base of off stump to long-on
"on the pads, Uthappa can't get any bat on it, but his intended flick does secure a leg bye"
"speared on a length outside off, flat batted to long-off"

"slower through the air outside off, worked off the pads to leg for one"

angles it in and Gambhir works it to leg now for one
"in the block hole but well outside off, right on the wide line, and GG chases and misses. Survives the wide call"
walks towards off and flicks it with the angle this time for one
"driven straight to cover and oh, is <b>Gambhir run out at the non-striker's end</b>? He is surely miles outside the crease after he turned back but the confusion is whether Sandeep's hands broke the stumps or the ball? Replays from multiple angle confirm that the ball went through Sandeep's hands and then to the stumps to dislodge the bails, Gambhir is gone! It was driven to cover and Maxwell got a direct hit from a tough angle, what was Gambhir doing so far down the pitch!"
"that's hit the stumps again at the non-striker's end! Uthappa drove it back, Sandeep couldn't get a hand to it but the ball found the stumps, Yusuf was outside the crease and a bit of excitement because of that. Bit of a scare for KKR"
"beautifully driven over the covers and that's his fifty too! Full toss outside off, Uthappa timed it very well and then raised his bat"
"<b>dropped</b>! That would have been a great over for Kings XI but the catch has been out down! Uthappa swung his bat across the line outside off for a high top-edge that went to long-off and David Miller got in the position to catch that, but Mohit came from Miller's left and took the ball away to drop it. Costly one"
"angling into Yusuf, worked to leg for one"
"too short outside off, swings hard to send the ball to leg for one"
""
gets down on a knee to reach the pitch of the ball and hammers that with a slog-sweep for a flat six! Uthappa is rubbing salt in Kings XI's wounds
"only slightly short, not much, but Uthappa got into position early and pulled that to the midwicket boundary for four more! He's hitting these so easily, that's what it looks like"

going towards the leg side and Uthappa helps it to short fine leg for one
Mohit starts on the leg stump and Uthappa swats it to leg for one
"pitched up, Yusuf slogs, and that flies over the long-leg boundary for six! He didn't middle that but such was the swing of the bat that it needed only that to sail over the short boundary"
he slogs again but finds deep midwicket this time
tries the yorker and Uthappa pushes the low full toss to long on
"slower one beats Yusuf and then Mohit's throw beats Uthappa! Mohit's slower ball deceived Yusuf completely as he looked to work it to leg but took it on his body. He took another step for a run but Uthappa had come a long way down the pitch by then, and so had Mohit. The bowler then turned around with the ball and hit the stumps at the non-striker's end"
towards leg and Yusuf flicks it to fine leg to keep strike
too wide outside off but Yusuf chases it to swipe it to sweeper cover
"slower one outside off, it cuts away beyond the wide line as Russell leaves it"
this time Russell chases with a big swing outside off and it's another wide
"make that three in a row! Way outside off, going away further and Russell left it in the end"
"targets the off stump, Russell swings hard and so hard that a thick edge goes flying over short third man for four!"
"almost a yorker, Russell swings and gets an inner edge to long leg for one"
"good delivery again - in the block hole around off, no room at all, and Yusuf drives it to cover for one"
"just a tad short of the bock hole, Russell drills it down towards long-off"
good end to the over for Sandeep - Yusuf can only find long-on for one after it pitched around the leg stump
"full outside off, Yusuf drives it powerfully along the ground to long-off"
similar delivery and Russell gives it similar treatment - single to long-off
"comes down the track, gets a full toss too, but it swung in and cramped Yusuf for room. He could only push it down the ground for one"
"excellent bowling - yorker outside off, Russell chases with a horizontal bat and misses"
small margin for error - attempted yorker become a low full toss and Russell rockets that over long-on with a big swing for a clean six! The crowd comes alive
"in the block hole this time, drilled down to long off. Russell keeps strike"
"he opens his stance and gets a yorker nearly as good as the one he got from Mustafiz, gets enough bat to take one"
makes room and drives the attempted yorker to long on
"excellent yorker again, this time on the middle stump, only a single on the off side"
"and again! not even a single this time. Yusuf drives it down and Sandeep dives to his right to stop the ball, turns around and makes Russell dive to make his ground"
drives the ball on the leg stump to deep midwicket. Only a single
"a run-out to end the innings! That went down the leg side, maybe for a wide, after Russell made room and tried to flick but missed and then took off for a single. But Saha threw the ball to Sandeep who saw how far Russell was and then ran all the way to run Russell out. That looked like a wide, but not sure why the umpire didn't give it"
start by targeting the stumps and Vijay gets an edge to leg for one
"pretty straight and outside off, Stoinis defends with a straight bat"
"nicely bowled just outside off again, Stoinis defends towards cover point now"
"wicket in the first over, Stoinis gives an easy catch to mid-off! It was a back of length ball outside off and it looked like Stoinis wanted to slap it down the ground. But he didn't middle it and Chawla took the easy catch"
short ball angles down the leg side for a wide
"angling in towards the off stump, he defends it to midwicket"
ends the over with a bouncer outside off and Vohra ducks under it
"starts with a length delivery outside off, driven into the covers"
"squares up Vijay just a little bit as the ball came in, maybe not as much as Vijay expected. He defends on the off side"
"errs down the leg side for a wide, past the pads"
"moon-like gravity for that delivery and the bounce! Well outside off and swinging away, Vijay chases and misses because of the bounce. Uthappa also smiles after taking it behind the stumps"
"back to normal bounce on the off stump, Vijay defends this time"
"angles it in again, tucked straight to midwicket"
"top-edge goes fine on the leg side and two fielders chase it but the ball beats both for a four! Uthappa and Chawla, from short fine leg, tried but could not get there. Vijay saw a shortish delivery, made room and pulled but didn't middle it at all"
"pretty straight on the off stump, tucked to midwicket"
"loud lbw appeal as the ball nips in to hit the pad in front of the stumps, but not given, probably because of the height"
"in a way that's another life for Vijay. He made room, slogged and missed the ball completely as it came in, and the ball just missed the stumps too. Four byes as Uthappa didn't go for it"
"pretty full on the stumps, defended to the leg side"
takes a step across and flicks the ball to midwicket for one
"that's the second wicket for Russell in his second over! Vohra falling over a bit towards the off side while executing that pull, he didn't get under or over it properly and pulled the ball high for Shakib at deep backward square"
"two in two for KKR, Vijay goes too! It was a short ball from Morkel outside off, moving away a bit, Vijay didn't move his feet at all while chasing it and handed a straightforward catch to mid-off with a half-hearted slap"
moves across towards off to defend the short ball
"outside off again, Maxwell doesn't move much this time and edges it to third man for one"

length delivery outside off and Maxwell defends it into the covers
stays on the back foot and plays it late to guide it to third man for one
looks to pull the ball in an unusual way and takes it on the pad instead
"shot of the innings! This ball had room outside off, it had pace, and Saha punched it with authority off the back foot to crunch it for four"
"towards the middle stump now, flicked with the wrists behind square for two"
clears the in field easily and gets four more! This is smart batting from Saha. Saw the length outside off and lofted it over mid-off without using much power
"shuffles across to the off side and tucks it fine along with the angle to guide it between the keeper and short fine, for four!"
makes room this time and swats the ball down to mid-off

"short and angling in again, Maxwell tries to beat short fine leg but finds him for a single"
taps the short ball late behind square on the off side for one

the googly beats Saha completely as he looks to sweep and misses
well outside off now and it's driven with the turn to point
"inside edge onto middle and off stumps, Chawla raises his arms and the crowd erupts! It was well outside off and for some reason, not the first time in the innings, Saha looked to sweep it against the turn but only got an inside edge that headed straight to the stumps"
"turns the ball into Maxwell, he tucks it off his pads behind square for one"
"<strong>loud, loud appeal first ball</strong>! Shuffles across to off and it was the wrong'un from Hogg that beat Miller. The appeal was for caught behind, just over the stumps. Oh my, replays show the ball hit the bails but it didn't dislodge. What luck for Miller"
""
"little flighted full toss, Maxwell slogs to leg but only for two"

turns into him this time and he works it to leg for one
flicks the ball with the wrists against the turn to leg and they do well to come back for the second

sweeps the ball against the turn from outside off to deep midwicket
"pitched up, Maxwell picks the length and rockets that with the turn to the long-on boundary for a big six! The fielders had no chance there"

"full toss, slapped straight down the ground, he didn't middle it but placed it such that it nearly bisected long on and long off for another four"
"shorter and quicker on the stumps, worked to deep midwicket and that's the <b>fifty</b> for Maxwell, only off 29 balls"
gets an inside edge onto the pad as he sweeps against the turn and gets one. Hogg was appealing for lbw

"nicely bowled outside off with some turn, Maxwell defends it back"
comes down the track and flicks the ball to leg for one
"on the leg stump, easily worked off the pad for one"

"makes room, Chawla pitches it outside off and Maxwell sends it down the ground to long on"
"pretty flat outside off, Miller guides it to sweeper cover"
"<b>big, big appeal</b> for lbw after Maxwell misses another reverse sweep, umpire Anil Chaudhary takes his time and slooowwwly raises his finger! What a wicket for KKR! It turned in instead of going away, which is what beat Maxwell and it's not confirmed if he was hit in line with the off stump, maybe just in line, maybe just outside"

tries a powerful drive but gets an inside edge onto the pad

"rolls his fingers over that one across Miller who slogs against the line and misses. Uthappa appeals for caught behind, all alone"
this one keeps low as it goes across Miller again and he misses again
"that's it for Miller, he's handed a catch to long-on off a full toss. Umpire Chaudhary has asked Miller to wait, though, to check for no ball. Replays show Russell's foot is well inside and the full toss is not above Miller's waist, it was maybe dipping too. Didn't look like the full toss cramped him for room but he handed a pretty easy catch to long-on several yards inside the boundary. The umpire raises his finger after the replays"
"slow offcutter cuts in, Gurkeerat chops it towards backward point for one"
"first ball six! Slow ball just outside off, maybe a bit too full, and Axar lofted that to the cow corner boundary for a six!"

"another run out in the match, Axar is gone! It was almost in the block hole and Gurkeerat could only send it back to Russell who went low to his right to catch the ball and then turned around for an overarm throw to catch Axar well short. Russell celebrates by thumping his chest, the crowd comes alive!"
"that's another run out, Gurkeerat is gone too. That's suicidal. He drove it down to long-off and it was only a single but the batsmen turned around and Sathish's throw to the keeper's end meant there wasn't much to do for Uthappa"
"slog for the delivery outside off, Mohit gets an edge for one"
"Russell gets one more, this is plumb! The umpire's finger goes up in slow motion, Russell roars, the crowd is going bonkers! He fired in a yorker at the base of middle and leg, Swapnil opened up his stance and was hit right in front"
"a yorker to end the match too, and Russell has done it for KKR again, with the ball this time. Sandeep digs out the yorker and <b>KKR win by seven runs</b>"
