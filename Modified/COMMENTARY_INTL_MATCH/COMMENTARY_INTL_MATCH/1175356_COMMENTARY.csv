"strays on the pads first ball and Kohli flicks to fine leg, where Harbhajan is stationed, so only a single"
"back of a length ball, given some width outside off. Parthiv slashes hard but can't get past point"
"good bowling, keeps it wide of off stump but within the tramlines, Parthiv lets it go, but that's not a wide"
"fuller and straighter, Parthiv wants to drive, but doesn't get the timing right while driving on the up. The ball trickles to mid-off"
"<b>misfield by by mid-off</b> too full and Parthiv cracks an off-drive, but Shardul lets it through his legs while running in to try and attack the ball"
"length ball on fifth stump, driven to extra cover. Good start by Chahar, with only one run and a mis-field"
"length ball on off, Kohli moves across and whips to midwicket"
"wrong line, too full and on the pads, worked away behind square"
"fullish on the stumps, Kohli drives gently to a widish long-on"
too short and gets it to bounce so Parthiv can move on the backfoot and cut it fiercely. Too fierce for the man at point to dive and intercept cleanly
"tossed up but on the pads, rolls away to square leg"
"flatter on off and spinning in a bit, Kohli moves back and across and wrists it to midwicket"
"back of a length keeps it stump to stump, and the ball doesn't bounce above the knee roll, Kohli comes on the front foot and flicks to deep square leg. The man has to run to his left so they get a couple"
"<b>swing and a miss</b> this pitch is not conducive to strokeplay perhaps. It held up a bit, length outside off. Kohli wanted to slap through cover, but couldn't connect"
"good ball, back of a length and on off stump, steered to point, but Jadeja's there and they aren't going to risk a quick single to him."
"terrific bowling, he's found that spot from where the ball is holding up a bit, and Kohli is a mite early into his shot. ends up patting it back"
"back of a length outside off again, and Kohli is again not able to hit freely through the line or on the up. Driven to mid-off"
"<b>slower one goes wrong</b> it's slipped out of his hands and gone over Kohli's head, so it's a no-ball. Free hit coming up."
brilliant bowling. yorker angling in from slightly wider of the crease to finish and all Kohli can do is dig it back out. Terrific from Chahar
good length on off and spinning away. Parthiv wanted to slash it away but under-edges it back to the bowler
"ooh the ball's already turning. pitches on a length outside off and holds up, Parthiv ends up getting it off the top half of the bat down to long of with a horizontal bat"
"<b>he's got him!</b> Harbhajan hadn't got a wicket in the last three T20s he played in. What a time and what a wicket to break that duck. Dragged this a little shorter, but it was still spinning into Kohli, who transferred weight back and pulled fiercely. But the ball's not really coming on to the bat, so even though he connected well, he didn't get the distance, and Ravindra Jadeja at deep midwicket stayed still and caught the ball, calm as you please. Chepauk's gone ballistic"
"beauty to start with. Moeen will appreciate that. On a length outside off, drawing him forward and spinning past"
"fuller, driven towards point with an open bat face"
"<b>boom</b> takes an offspinner to read an offspinner! This was fuller, in the sweeping range and Moeen was quickly down on one knee and hit it out of the screws. Superb connection to send the ball into the midwicket stands. Much needed hit for RCB"
"back of a length on off stump, he mis-times the pull towards deep square leg"
"dragged it down a little short, but Moeen doesn't try to pull very fiercely, almost guides it to the man on the square leg boundary, along the ground"
"he's honed in on that back of length spot again, and the ball's holding up. Parthiv tries to flick it away but a bit early into the shot."
"back of a length on off again, under-edges the pull to deep square leg"
"<b>upper cut</b> surprises him wit hthe bouncer, but Parthiv adjusts well to upper cut it over Dhoni. Harbhajan is at third man and collects on the bounce"
"back of a length on the stumps, Moeen changes tack. He was trying to pull these earlier, but he's content to glide it to third man now. Gliding, nudging and pushing might be the way to go on this pitch, till you get set"
"good length, pitching on off, spinning away, defended into the offside"
"<b>popped back to the bowler</b> tames of dismissals. This one was on the length from where the ball is holding up. It held up even more, pitched on off and spinning away, and Moeen was way too early into his shot, trying to drive. Ends up popping the ball in the air off the end of the bat, and Harbhajan has all the time in the world to pluck the catch over his head. What a start by Harbhajan and Chennai"
"length ball on the stumps spinning onto pad, flicked off the front foot"
"almost an intentional thick outside edge by AB. This was flighted up fuller outside off, the top-spinner and he almost guides it to third man"
"fullish length, driven to mid-on"
"inside edge onto pad and rolls to slip. Harbhajan is up in appeal, but the edge saved him. Length ball on off, he wanted to cut it, but edged onto pad"
"back of a length outside off, he stays beside it and glides it to short third man"
"ooh was that a potential catch for Tahir at deep square leg? drags it a bit short, Parthiv pulls but in the air. Tahir decides against running in to dive, and collects on the bounce"
"<b>through him</b> length ball nipping back in off the seam, and through between AB's bat and body. He was trying to nudge it into the onside"
good length patted into the offside
"down the track and gets to the pitch of the ball to drive powerfully, but straight to Bravo at mid-off, so no run for AB"
"back of a length again outside off, but AB has watched and knows the ball holds up. Waits for it and slaps it down to third man gently. Superb from Chahar at the top, just 17 runs in four overs. And would have been 13, if not for a mis-fielded boundary in the first over"
"<b>Tahir has dropped AB at deep square leg</b> That would have been nail in coffin with Undertaker's music playing, but AB gets a life. Swept from leg-stump, gets a top edge, and Tahir makes a hash of it"
"<b>you cannot deny Harbhajan today</b> AB tries to sweep again, but doesn't get hold of it once again. The pitch is not one where you can rely on the ball coming on even a bit, and AB is too early, the top edge flies to midwicket this time. And Jadeja is the man there, he isn't going to drop any. even when he has to run in and dive forward. RCB in tatters"
backs away and drives this fuller length ball to cover
"strays on the pads and the ball rolls away very close towards backward square leg. RCB's thinking is so muddled they went for that run. Dhoni had run to field the ball and had he hit the stumps, Hetmyer would have been out. But he doesn't hit"
"flatter, into leg stump, he moves back and slaps to mid-on"
"<b>oh what have you done Shimron Hetmyer?</b> This was given some more air, Hetmyer came on the front foot and pushed to Raina at cover. For some unfathomable reason, he thought there was a run there and was halfway down the pitch. Raina reached the ball by then and flicked it to Dhoni. Hetmyer gave up the ghost and just stood there, watching the bails get whipped off."
too short and he rocks back to pull this to long-on
"<b>turn</b> Raina's getting to spin like Murali! Pitched on a length and spun sharply across Dube, who was flummoxed"

"fuller on off, takes a thick inside edge to midwicket"
"starts with a flatter one around off, defended from the back foot towards extra cover"
"Dube departs cheaply, googly does the trick. Was a length ball around off and spinning away, Dube looks to steer it on the off side, gets an outside edge and Watson takes an easy catch around stomach height at first slip"
"another googly, length around off and middle, defended from the back foot"
"tossed up around off and middle, drives it towards covers"
"fuller on middle and leg and de Grandhomme just chips it over the leg side, beats the man at long-on and deep midwicket"

"length around off, flatter and quicker, spins away from the batsman who looks to defend, beaten"
"<strong>caught behind!</strong> A similar delivery, but a touch fuller this time, pitching around off, de Grandhomme comes forward to defend but it spins away sharply to take the outside edge, Dhoni makes no mistake"
"fuller around off, Saini comes forward to drive, a leading edge towards covers"
"fuller around off, comes forward and flicks it behind square"
"fuller around off, comes forward and pushes, a thick outside edge behind point"
"fuller around off, a googly again to beat the forward defence, an appeal for lbw but think it hit him outside the line of the off stump. Not out but Dhoni has decided to review it. Front foot is fine. Looks like there is some bat involved, an inside edge, replays confirm. But wait, Watson have taken the catch as well, so it's not lbw but caught behind"

"flighted around off, comes forward and defends"

"tossed up outside off, comes forward and drives it towards cover"
"length on middle and leg, comes forward, wait for it to spin and dead-bats"
"falls short of diving Jadeja at backward point, Chahal comes forward to this tossed up delivery, doesn't get to the pitch and ends up slicing it towards point"

"length outside off, comes forward to block but gets beaten as it spins big"
"flatter on the leg stump, pushed towards short midwicket from the front foot"
"length ball around off stump, Parthiv waits for it come in with the angle before opening the face at the last moment to guide it past Dhoni"
"length ball on the stumps, looks to flick it on the leg side, misses. An appeal for lbw but denied. Jadeja was excited and Dhoni has decided to review it. Hits him near the knee roll. Pitched outside off, and spinning in to hit the batsman in front of middle but it was going over the stumps. CSK lose their review"

"length outside off, comes forward to defend and gets beaten like so many others before him as the ball spins away"
"and he strikes first ball. Parthiv it is, so he doesn't become the first batsman to carry his bat in the IPL. Coming to the ball, it was short down the leg side, Parthiv goes for the pull but ends up hitting it straight to Jadeja at square leg"

"back of a length, nipping in from outside off, defended into the offside"
"back of a length, punched to deep cover"
"<b>pings him on the helmet</b> that's a snorter of a bouncer, rises up sharply and hits Watson on the front of the helmet, while he was trying ot pull. Too quickly onto him, on a pitch that's slow - that is impressive bowling"
"rapped on the pads and half-hearted appeal. Nipping in from outside off, but too high"
"another one that's hurried him, 143 kph, coming in from middle, and he tucks it off his thigh pad"
"takes the attack to the bowler, down the track to a short ball at 140 kph and he latches on to it, pulls it well. So well in fact that it carries over the long-on fence"
<b>got him</b> that's an ugly heave from Watson to a slider that pitched on off. Went for a slog sweep but misses it entirely and the ball cannons into the stumps.
