"fuller ball, just outside off, Gayle bends forward and bunts it into the off side"
"oh, lovely. On a length and just a hint of shape away from the left-hander's off-stump, it was slower - the knuckle ball - and Gayle tries to open the face of his bat and gets beaten"
"poor follow-up delivery, slower again at 122ks, but on the pads and on leg stump, it's the knuckle ball again and it is clipped away to deep fine leg"
"that one swings away a mile outside off, Gayle does not bother going after it and it is called a wide"
"on the pads again, Gayle clips and times it superbly to dispatch it to the midwicket boundary, comfortably beats deep square leg running to his right"
"good length ball, slight away swing away, Gayle comes forward and makes a late decision to offer no stroke"
"on a length and on middle and leg, Gayle pats it towards mid-off and jogs a single"
"fullish length, pushed across on middle and off, Gayle watchfully defends it to the left of the bowler"
"not off the middle but such is the power. Goes hard at this wide delivery outside off, gets it off the outside part of the bat but it does not matter, sails comfortably over the third man boundary"
"just short of short fine leg. This one comes on full at the pads and Gayle turns it away behind square, ball lands just in front of Cummins who does well to get down to his right and stop it from going to the boundary"
"fuller ball, no pace, Gayle knocks it cautiously to covers"
"short of a length, on leg stump, tucks off the hips to square leg for one"
"just short of a length, outside off, stays in the crease and opens the face of his bat to Iyer at backward point"
"fuller, swinging away, Gayle pushes it out and cannot find the gap at the point region"
"beautifully bowled! Draws him forward with a length ball, look at the seam position on that, it jags away very late to just beat the outside edge"
"fuller ball, does not move as much this time and Gayle times a drive on the front foot to long-off"
"short of good length on off, quietly turns it away to midwicket for a quick single"
"extremely full on leg, beats Gayle's attempted clip and makes an optimistic lbw appeal, but that would have comfortably missed leg"
"nice shape away, not much Gayle could do there, sees the fuller length and shapes up for a loft over the off side in-field, jags away considerably after landing to beat the outside edge"
"yorker on off and middle, dug out back to the bowler"
"full and wide, Vishnu is tempted to go for the big, extravagant drive, not in control as he swings hard, the bottom hand comes off as the ball swings away ever so slightly to beat him"
gets nicely forward to meet the pitch of this length ball and taps it very late to steer it to the right of third man for one
"short, pushed across just enough to give him the width he is looking for outside off, Gayle latches on to a pull, gets in position early and absolutely shovels a pull to dispatch it over deep midwicket. Slower ball but he picked it well, that's a monster six"
"full toss, angled in, driven to long-off for a single"
"back of a length, outside off, holding its line, Vinod opens the face of his bat and picks out point. No run there"
"pushed acorss at pace, 142-kilometre length ball, Gayle comes charging down and swipes across the line, gets an inside edge to backward square leg"
"fullish length on leg, drops it in front of mid-on and calls for a quick single"
"yorker on middle, Gayle jams the bat down and squeezes it out behind square on the leg side"
"back of a length, knocks it to point and thinks of a quick single but is denied it"
"short of a length ball, looks to pull across the line but the ball does not bounce to his liking and he also slightly tucked up for room. Gets a healthy bottom edge that clatters on to the stumps"
"back of a length on off, Kohli shuffles across to get behind the line before defending solidly"
"really full and angled in on leg, low full toss in fact, Gayle stays rooted to the crease and just uses the pace on that one to push it down to long-on for four"
"fuller, drilled off the inside part of the bat to mid-on for a very quick single"
"good length outside off, punched with an open bat face to backward point"
"short ball, swivels around and pulls and deep backward square leg gets around it to keep it to a single"

"high full toss, Gayle turns it away wide of the fielder at mid-on"
"full, outside off, pushed out with an open bat face to point"

"short of good length, angling in around off, Kohli stabs it to deep point with an open face of the bat"
"pushed across on a length, Gayle drops it in front of point and gets across for a quick single, direct hit at the non-striker's end but he has comfortaly made it"
"back of a length and angling in, turned away to midwicket"
"fuller ball, does come on to him too well despite being fired at 142 clicks, Kohli skews it off the inside edge in the direction of mid-on"
"flat and full, driven to extra cover with the turn"
"sliding on a length, on the middle and leg channel, Kohli punches it in the gap between long-on and deep midwicket after backing away"
"what a shot that is! That is characteristic Kohli, combines power and placement. Clears the front leg and whips it muscularly to deep midwicket"
"fuller ball, comes forward and knocks it back to the bowler"
"sliding in on leg at a flatter trajectory, driven in the gap between long-on and deep midwicket and the boundary riders there get around it"
"pushed across outside off, Gayle opens the face of his bat and gets beaten as the keeper collects it. Mishra is very excited about a caught behind but there was daylight between bat and ball. He goes up and down excitedly but Pant isn't as excited"
"what kind of a shot is that! How do you hit that for a six?! Cross-seam ball, on a length and angling in, Kohli strides forward and just presents the full face of the bat, he did not even mean to hit that so hard and loft it. He just checked his forward push and chipped it. The ball just flies over long-off for a surprisingly clean six after making contact with willow. Bang off the middle and great timing but a stunning shot nonetheless"
"short of a length, tucked away off the hips to midwicket. Kohli calls for the second and Gayle slips as he tries to get out the way of Kohli and a direct hit might have had him in trouble"
"short of a length, opens the face of his bat and finds backward point"
"<b>leading edge, finds no one</b>. Short of a length, tries to flick against the line but again the ball does not quite come on. Closes the face of his bat early and pops it in the air, between point and backward point"

"pitched up on the stumps, eased down to long-on for a single"

"slower length ball, outside off, Kohli tries to flat-bat through the off side but chops it back to the bowler"
"no pace again, short of a length, 117ks, Kohli chops the cut"
"full toss, turned away off the pads to deep square leg for an easy single"
"slower full ball outside off, just 116ks, Kohli taps it gently to the covers region for another single"
"very full and sliding on leg, whipped away powerfully to deep midwicket"
what a shot! Didn't hit it too hard but such is the weight behind the shot. Shifts back to the shortish ball - Mishra tried to fire it quicker - and Gayle muscles a pull effortlessly over cow corner
"another front of the hand quicker ball, punched down to long-off for one"
"this is just poor bowling. Sliding in on leg and too short, Kohli swats a pull ove rdeep midwicket"
"and now he goes too full and this pace is just helping the batsmen. This is a slow track and pace off is what's going to trouble batsmen. Full and quick, Kohli clips i forcefully between long-on and deep midwicket. Big over for RCB"
presses forward and pushes this out to cover point for one
"slower length ball, angling in, tucked away to deep midwicket for a quiet single"
"very full, outside off, Gayle swipes hard and drags it down to long-on off the inside part of the bat"

"back of a length, opens the bat face to steer it just wide of point for a single"
"full, outside off, crashes a drive extremely hard to long-off"
"soft dismissal. Nadeem pitches one up at leg stump, this has spun the other way, using the wrist and Gayle does not read it, tries to launch it and finds the toe end of the bat. Finds midwicket where Zaheer latches on to a straightforward chance"
"could have been bowled around the legs, gets down for a sweep against this legbreak and he actually nearly drags it on to the stumps"
fired down the leg side and called a wide
"orthodox left-arm spin, on a length, defended off the front foot"
stays back to this back of a length ball and punches it between long-on and deep midwicket
"pitched up on middle and leg, eased down to long-on with the turn"
"sliding on leg, clipped off the pads to deep square leg"
"slower full ball at 123ks, Kohli clips it away to midwicket and calls for two straight away. Zaheer collects the ball cleanly and takes the bails off at the bowler's end. Travis Head is responding to Kohli's call but he may be gone here. This one looks pretty close. The throw from Shreyas Iyer is slightly wide but Zaheer has done superbly to extend both hands and collect it cleanly and takes off the bails. And Head is gone by a comfortable distance"
"slower length ball, 123 clicks, comes on straight and Kohli flicks it to square leg for one"
flicked uppishly through square leg and there is a slight misunderstanding on the second eun. Jadhav hares back for the second but Kohli bellows out a no and Jadhav scampers back
backs away slightly to this fuller ball and drives with a straight bat to the left of long-off
"full, outside off, drilled out to sweeper cover for one"
"fuller ball, at the stumps so no room but Kohli opens the face of his bat and drives it out to sweeper for another single. <b>Fourth fifty for Kohli</b>"
"yorker, seared in at leg, hits the outside part of Kohli's front pad. Appeal from Cummins but heading down leg as the angle seems to suggest. Given as runs but there was no bat"
"full toss at legal height, hurriedly tucks a single through midwicket"
"swings hard at the sight of width, but he is nowhere near it and misses"
"very full, angling in on the stumps, drilled powerfully to long-on"
great work by Pant behind the stumps. Drifting down the leg side and the batsman backs away looking to launch it over the leg side. The ball goes from between the legs and Pant dives to his left full length to stop it
"fuller ball, turned away for a brace through midwicket"
"<b>return catch, dropped</b>. Extremely hard. Kohli flat-bats a slower length ball straight back at Zaheer. The ball just doesn't stick on, hit very hard, lack of pace messes up Kohli's timing"
there are those powerful wrists of Kohli. Zaheer looks for a yorker and fires a harmless knee-height full toss that is flicked over deep midwicket with supreme timing
"Kohli picks out long-off. It was a fuller ball, pushed across at 129ks, in the slot for Kohli who clears the front leg. But he just quite doesn't get underneath it. Doesn't find the middle of the bat and sails comfortably into the waiting hands of Nadeem. Kohli is furious with himself, he was all set to shift into top gear"
"wide fuller ball, chases it and gets an inside edge on the drive to fine leg"
"rolls his fingers over it, Jadhav picks the off-cutter, waits for it and clears the front leg before hacking it straight over Zaheer's head"
tries to move across and whip this away but gets pinged on the pad outside leg as the ball rolls away to fine leg
"short of a length, tries to tuck it off the hips but the ball misses his bat as it drifts down the leg side"
"very full ball outside off, swinging in late, drilled down to long-on"
"full and on the stumps, clipped through midwicket and slightly loses balance as he does so"
"again, extremely full, all Baby can do is jam the bat down and squeeze it our hard to long-on"
"yorker, just outside off, dug out to short third man and that's a run out at the non-striker's end. Jadhav starts off for the single, Cummins picks up the ball and hurls a throw at the non-striker's end. The bowler is standing on the way but Shami does well to take his hand out of the way and just lets it go. And the ball hits the stumps. Jadhav was initially jogging along and he is well short of the ground"
hitting the blockhole consistently now is Shami. Squeezed out to the left of the bowler
"low full toss, angled in at off, Baby lays into a drive and picks the gap at extra cover, splits the fielder and mid-off for four"
"very full, angling in on off and middle, clipped out wide of mid-on for a brace"
"backs away and Cummins follows him with a 147kph-yorker, squeezed out to long-on"
"fires it full and wide outside off, comes on straight, Baby is stapled to the crease as he swings and misses"
"that's a good shot. He didn't time it too well but that one has gone straight as an arrow. Extremely full and angling in on middle, launches it back over the bowler and you can't have fielders for those"
tries to take it away from the batsman and fires a wide outside off. Baby again reaches out without feet
"slower-ball bouncer at 116ks, gets up too much and the square leg umpire deems it a wide"
"good catch by Corey Anderson in front of the long-on boundary. Good awareness of where the ropes are. Extremely full ball and Baby backs himself to launch it. But the ball is fired on middle, on target, which means he really does not have the room to completely open up his arms. He skies it and Anderson snaffles it right in front of the long-on boundary and stops in his tracks as he moves back and manages to balance himself in front of the ropes"
""
"Watson backs away and Anderson tries to follow him, sprays a wide down the leg side"
"back of a length, angled in at off, Watson backs away and pulls to deep midwicket. Not much pace, so he is not finding the power he is looking for"
"tries to take it away from the batsman and the drift away is too sharp, wide outside off"
"Anderson is claiming a caught and bowled and the umpire isn't too excited. Shamshuddin walks up to the square leg umpire and they refer this upstairs. Soft signal is not out. Tell you what, if he has taken this, this could be one of the catches of the tournament. Ah, no, the ball has clearly bounced before going to the bowler. Hitting the pad and bouncing before going to the bowler. Anderson flings himself to his left of the follow-through to catch it. Negi was swiping hard across the line and didn't find the middle of the bat"
"swings hard after reaching out to this wide delivery and skews it off the outside edge through third man, gets it over the man inside the circle"
"outside edge for four. Stays stapled to the crease and swings hard at this wide delivery outside off, sends it uppishly through third man"
"full, outside off and this time the connection is sweet. Drilled off the middle of the bat. Overpitched outside off, gets the front leg out of the way and sends it crashing through extra cover"
backs away to this fuller one and hammers a drive but straight to cover
"whoa, hello. Goes wide of the crease with a big leap, uses his high-arm action to lift one off quickly from a length and hit Samson on the glove as he fends close to his body"
"lovely. Once more, he's generated some serious pace off this slow wicket. Back of a length outside off, climbs steeply on Samson who is very late on the pull shot. Can only find Kohli at mid-on"
"141 kph, back of a length outside off stump, hangs back and pokes away from the body, runs it to third man"
"141 kph, pitches on a good length at off stump, nips back in sharply and thuds Nair whose feet are off the ground flush in the thigh guard as he looks to flick"
"overpitched outside off stump, late on the square drive, gets it with an open face to third man"
"141 kph, good length outside off stump, follows it with his hands and drives on the up to point"
"short and wide outside off stump, tapped gently to cover point off the back foot"
"good length at middle stump, gets low quickly for the sweep. Doesn't connect too well, but gets enough off the under edge and bisects short fine and square leg"
"oh lovely ball. But it's gone between keeper and slip. How many times have we seen this when Chahal is bowling? Beats the batsman in flight, gets the ball to dip quickly at off stump and spin sharply away from the attempted drive. Vishnu is stuck in his stance and can't even get close to it"
"good length at middle stump, goes for the sweep again, square leg fumbles to his left"
"back of a length at off stump, pushed off the back foot to cover point"
"good length at middle stump, possibly a googly. Nair defends away from his body and gets a thick inside edge to short fine"
"back of a length at off stump, defended off the back foot to point"
"142kph, goes for the bouncer outside off stump, but this is too short and wide for the batsman to reach with the cut"
"back of a length, climbs sharply in the corridor. Nair backs away and looks to cut. There was no room. He's beaten on the outside edge"
"134kph, back of a length at off stump, back foot defence"
"yikes. You don't say this about a batsman facing fast bowlers, but Nair is not picking him. This is good length, angled into the mid-riff. Nair seems to be camping on the back foot for a square cut. In the end, swivels, shows his body, and keeps this from drilling into his body with a very awkward tail-ender style bunt. You'd think he was playing West Indies in the 70s."
"much better. Stands tall, lets this length delivery come to him outside off and drives through the line, and through the gap in the covers"
"good length at off stump, driven straight to cover point"
"tossed up at leg stump, gets leg side of it and drive inside-out to long-off"
"good length at off stump, opts for the reverse sweep but this bounces too much and hits him on the back thigh, via elbow"
"dropped short at middle stump, skids through quickly but he gets the pull away, slightly wide of mid-on"
"shot. Tossed up at middle stump, gives him the charge, gets to the pitch and launches this over the long-on boundary"
"good length at middle stump, punched off the back foot to extra cover"
"good length, outside off stump. Feet rooted to the crease, but this was close enough to him. He throws his hands out at it and uses his wrists to turn it past short third man"
"good length outside off stump, looks to spank this through the off side on the up, beaten on the outside edge"
"offcutter, good length outside off stump. He had a sweeper out, so Nair anticipated the line. Walked across, showed all his stumps and ramped this through the open fine leg area. It's a new shot in his arsenal, one he's used often this season"
"overcompensation. Short and wide outside off stump, this time he transfers his weight back quickly and gracefully places this square cut well wide of the sweeper"
"now anticipates the indipper, shuffles slightly, meets this good length ball at middle stump and pushes it past midwicket"
"attempted slower bouncer, gets decent height on it, but this slides down the leg side and Iyer is happy to duck"
"<b>is that dropped?</b> Not easy to tell on first glance if that carried. It is easy to tell that, once again, there was no footwork from the keeper. This was a good length ball outside off stump. He slashed at it and got a thin outside edge that was dipping at Vishnu, who reacted very very late. In the end, it was less a dive, more a fall to his right as he parried it. It was a close call, but it's harsh to call that a drop"
"offcutter, back of a length at leg stump, nudged to short fine leg"
"back of a length at middle stump, goes for the pull shot, he's late on it. Drags it feebly to midwicket where Jadhav runs in towards the ball, then gains balance, and holds on"
"offcutter, good length at middle stump. Puts in a stride and taps this confidently to mid-on"
"good length at off stump, defends it on the up, back down the pitch"
"offcutter, good length and down the leg side. He waits for this to arrive to try and tickle it fine, gets it off the pad and the keeper gets across"
"good length at middle stump, pushed to mid-on"
"full and drifted into the pads. He looks to climb into this with a flick, cops it on the front leg"
full and drifted in at middle stump. He isn't to the pitch as he swings across the line and just about drags this to deep square leg's right
"good length at off stump, leans in and pushes this off the front foot to sweeper cover"
"full at off stump, driven back at the bowler who gets this on the bounce quickly to his left"
"good length at middle stump, goes deep in the crease and pushes this between deep square and deep midwicket with the perfect amount of timing to pick up two"
"good length at leg stump, pushed on the up midwicket"
"125 kph, short ball at leg stump, awkwardly arches towards the off side and turns this off his hips to fine leg"
"133kph, back of a length. Nips back in sharply and takes the inside edge. It hits his thigh and lands in the off side"
"135 kph, bouncer at leg stump, Pant happy to duck under it"
"132 kph, back of a length at leg stump, flicks this nonchalantly. But without control in the end. It floats out towards deep square leg"
"132 kph, bouncer at middle stump, thinks about the pull but adjusts and ducks instead"
"131 kph, back of a length at off stump. Stands tall and drops it into the off side with soft hands"
"good length, fired flat a middle stump. Gets down the track and toe-ends this uppish drive. It goes wide of long-on who slips after over-running, but does well to hold on to it in the end"
"full control this time. Full at middle stump, gets close to the pitch and hammers this in that same gap between long-on and deep midwicket again, this time the fielders had no chance"
"back of a length, angled across the batsman. He opens the face and bunts it wide of short third man"
"they've had enough of the part-timer. This one is floated full outside off stump. He puts a stride forward, but makes sure he has enough room to lift this inside-out to clear long-off"
"good length outside off stump, pushed off the front foot to long-off"
"good length, flat at middle stump. Goes on the back foot and pushes this neatly between deep square and deep midwicket to pick up two"

"good length, down leg side, flicked to deep backward square"
"googly, good length and wide outside off stump. Pant picks it and lets it go"
"<b>no-ball.</b> Drops it short at middle stump, hangs deep in the crease and slaps this to deep midwicket's left"

"dropped short outside off stump, cut nicely, straight to sweeper cover"
"offcutter, back of a length in the corridor. He gets on top of the bounce and shovels this to midwicket's right, almost one-handed in the end, that didn't come on"
"offcutter, back of a length at leg stump, flicked on the up to deep square leg"
"good ball. A slower bouncer outside off stump. Iyer backs away, premeditatedly, misses on the cut"
"back of a length in the corridor, sits in the pitch and comes on slowly as he looks to punch into the leg side off the back foot. Gets a leading edge wide of the bowler and down to long-off"
"and now Watson repeats Chahal's error from the last over. Brings fine leg into the circle, bowls a short ball at his hips. He swivels, taps the ball on its head and rolls the wrists to get it wide of deep square"
"offcutter, short at middle stump, doesn't get all of the pull shot. Finds deep midwicket"
"back of a length on the pads, swipes at this and drags it down to long leg"
"slower bouncer outside off, and once more Iyer is caught attempting a lavish shot on a slow pitch. Done it a couple of times this season. Miscues the pull shot and loses his bottom hand as he completes the shot, but the top edge lands safely in front of long-on and deep midwicket"
"back of a length at middle stump, slapped across the line, straight to deep square"
"and once more. This time he finds the fielder. Slower ball, dropped short outside off stump. He's looking to slap it in front of square on the off side but is through the shot too early. Toe-ends it straight to extra cover"
"<b>what a ball!</b> Superb stuff from Harshal. Bowls him the slower ball first up and Samuels, visibly, is completely flummoxed. Has no clue what's happened out there and lazily pokes the bat out with feet cemented firmly in the crease. In the mean time, the ball pitches on a length at off stump, cuts back in and takes his stumps"
"well played. Expects the offcutter, gets it. Good length at off stump. Watches it closely and defends close to the body, into the off side"
"full and wide outside off stump, drives through the line and finds sweeper cover"
"slower bouncer at leg stump, gets under it quickly. Vishnu does well to take this on the bounce behind the stumps"

"offcutter, good length at leg stump. Waits for it to come on, pushes it to short fine's left"
"offcutter, good length at middle stump, defended to mid-off with a full face"
"offcutter, back of a length at middle stump. Anderson backs away, drops it towards point with soft hands...runs halfway, then comes back after Pant refuses. Then gives him a glare. That should've been a run."
"nicely done! Offcutter, good length, slightly wide outside off stump. He leans in, realises it's a slower ball and cocks the wrists last moment to poke this past backward point and short third man"
"offcutter, good length at off stump. Walks into the shot and pushes it back to the bowler"
"good adjustment again. This one is dropped short, but is also a slower ball. He arches towards the off side quickly, but then waits before forcing this drag over the short fine leg fielder"
"good length, offcutter outside off, pushed on the up to extra cover's left"
bowls a medium-pace delivery for a change. Short and outside off stump. He gets an inside edge that bounces into the pitch and over the stumps
"slower ball, back of a length at middle stump, pulled to deep square"
"back of a length outside off stump, mistimed chop straight to point"
"offcutter, good length at leg stump. Wants to ramp this past short fine, but it's slow coming onto him and his shot turns into a swipe across the line. Hits it straight to short fine"
"bouncer at middle stump, looks to heave this hook shot over the square leg boundary, miscues it completely. Unfortunately for the bowler, square leg is back on the boundary as this lands safely in the infield"
"good length outside off stump, backs away to try and slap this on the up, beaten"
"slower bouncer at off stump, arches back to try and play the upper cut, can only push it to point's left"
"good length at middle stump, flicked on the up to deep midwicket"
"good length, fired flat at middle stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
"runs past a pedestrian part-timer ball. This is flat, short and outside off stump. At best, would've been cut behind square on another day; at worst, a single to sweeper. Today, Anderson plays a poor shot. Steps out, makes a little too much room and can't get the slash at it quickly enough. Too far down the pitch to recover and that's the last of him this season"
"good length, flat at middle stump, goes on the back foot and taps it to deep midwicket"
"tossed up at leg stump, steps out and drills it to long-on"
"shot. Good length, pushed through fast from around the wicket at leg stump. Cummins unleashes a full swing across the line at this and deposits it over the midwicket boundary"
"full and wide outside off stump, wants to bludgeon this over extra cover, but he gets it off the toe-end. Slices it straight to long-off"
"<b>unbelievable shot.</b> This is angled in at middle stump, good length. Some confidence for him to whip this on the up, given how many slower balls Harshal has bowled previously. But he goes through. Falls into the off side, uses the angle and lifts it cleanly over the square leg boundary"
"good comeback. Short offcutter, off stump line. Once more he's looking to swivel and lift one over the square leg boundary. Beaten this time and through the pull shot early. Gets hit in the bicep"
"slower bouncer, slight hint of going down the leg side, but not enough to be called wide according to the umpire as Pant ducks under this"
"<b>gone!</b> Pant, the last man standing for Daredevils once more, becomes the one who won't finish it once more. Another good innings, but Harshal has won this battle in some style. Skids in an offcutter from around the wicket. It doesn't grip in the pitch. Instead, it slides through like an arm ball from outside off stump. He looks to slog this over the midwicket boundary, but there's enough gap between bat and pad for the ball to smash into the stumps"
"slower boucner at middle stump, gets inside the line, connects in front of his body as he looks to pull, then rolls the wrists nicely to control the hook and get it fine"
"clattered. Awful bowling after getting a big wicket. Bowls a length ball wide outside off stump. Shami is a simple man. Swings hard at this, connects nicely, slaps it to the extra cover boundary"
"good length, flat at middle stump. Goes for the reverse sweep, and just about manages to connect and drag it off the under edge to backward point"
"good length outside off stump, Shami slogs across the line without getting to the pitch. The ball spins past his outside edge and Vishnu takes the bails off. The stumping appeal is sent upstairs, but he never left the crease"
"good length, flat outside off stump. This time Shami takes a step into the off side and slaps across the line to find long-on"
"<b>shot of the day.</b> A beauty from Mishra. This is good length, dipping sharply at middle stump. He goes down the wicket, barely gets to the pitch. Offers the full face, then extends the arms to lift it over the sightscreen"
"ouch. Arm ball, back of a length, skids in sharply and hits him in the box as he looks to pull. He's on the floor in pain, so Shami's call for a single won't get any response"
"goes down the track again, but this time the bowler wins. This is flatter, good length at middle stump. He wants to lift it over extra cover this time, but that straightens just enough to go past his angled bat and into the stumps"
"back of a length at off stump, hurries Shami on the pull, he jams it into the pitch and to long-on"
"126kph, back of a length outside off stump, sliced off the outer half of the bat, gets it to third man's right"
"<b>dropped.</b> Kohli looked like he misjudged this at long-on. This was full at middle stump, Shami stands and swipes, gets it off the toe and to Kohli's left at long-on. He runs gingerly, and gets up late. In the end, it's one-handed and he can only tip it over the boundary. A tough chance, but it's six"
"back of a length at middle stump, too late on the pull shot, gets it high on the bat but it lands safely in front of long-on"
"full outside off stump, Nadeem leans into the off side, one-legged, and looks to ramp it over short fine. Misses, gets it on his back leg and into the off side"
"gets the top edge over the keeper. Avesh goes back of a length at off stump, his action gets the ball up for Shami to pull. He does so and is late on it once again. But he gets four and he keeps Delhi in the game"
"back of a length on the pads, flicked off the pads to deep square leg"
"good length, flat outside off stump. Shami steps out and looks to slog it over the midwicket boundary. Misses and immediately tries to push his back foot behind the crease. The front part of this boot is bent and on top of the crease one frame before the bails come off. And he has only got it slightly on the front part of the line, enough for the umpire to say that's out. Nothing was <b>behind</b> the crease"
"another faster one, good length outside off stump, driven on the up, off the toe-end to deep extra cover"
"flat, good length, middle stump. Steps out and gets an inside edge that bounces up for the keeper who is too excited to try and hold this before trying to take the stumps off. Doesn't gather cleanly and ends up throwing the ball at the stumps in the end"
"back of a length length at off stump, drilled back at the bowler on the bounce"
"and Negi deals the final blow, to his old franchise, on their home ground. Good length at leg stump, gives him the charge and slogs across the line. Finds deep midwicket who didn't have to move at all"
