"has he been run out after a misfield? A bottom-handed flick through the leg side, there's some poor fielding from deep midwicket. They easily make the second, then chance a third. Hendricks is safe as he gets the dive out. The bat did nearly bounce, but the shoulder remains on the ground. The umpire having a lengthy look, but it seems fine. Front of the bat in the air, but the top of the bat is grounded. This is taking ages. He's safe"

"this is a fuller ball, the bottom hand whips through the shot and it goes like 'a well-known bullet phrase' to deep midwicket"

"swing and a miss, that's a win for the bowler. A cutter outside off, de Villiers aims another blow down the ground but doesn't make contact"
"aims to sweep, the ball is outside leg, takes the pad"
"sharp stumping! Nicely bowled, spins across the right hander as he drives and Chandimal has gone for the stumping. He's confident. The foot drags out...Chandimal actually misses the first swipe at the stumps, but still the foot doesn't go back! He's out. That's some slow-motion cricket (and not just on replay)"

"round the wicket, full outside off, a slower ball, lofted in the air bit short of long-off"
"that's into the crowd...will help lift things. A slower ball, dragged down, de Villiers sees it early, plays back, and pulls it mightily over the leg side"
"length ball outside off, 125kph, struck sweetly but straight to deep cover...de Villiers frustrated he didn't find the gap"
"excellent fielding in the deep...tucks a length delivery from off stump into midwicket. Good return from the deep, bounced in so it skidded to Chandimal, and this will be tight. Chandimal gathers and only has to move inches. Behardien is a foot short"
"stays round the wicket, full toss outside off, driven to deep cover"
"a sliced drive, the ball is full outside off, finds the sweeper"
"he's gone now! With a juggle. Sri Lanka fighting back. A low full toss outside off, tries to place it square through the off side but just picks out point who doesn't well to palm it in the air and hold it at the second attempt"
"full at middle and leg, flicked to long-on"
"nice deft touch, deflects this fine of third man with a late dab"

"good comeback from the bowler, 93kph at off stump, can't get any timing"

"bottom edge on a slog-sweep, runs to short fine leg...a very good finish from Gunaratne"
"over the wicket, a slower ball, gets underneath it and with enough bat to clear the straight boundary even though it wasn't off the middle"
"round the wicket, swing and a miss at a length ball...he'll be annoyed he didn't connect"
"into the stands again! Little gem of an innings...take advantage of some width, drives this over square cover. Impressive power"
"and another! He's being fed length outside off, he likes it there, frees his arms and sends this straighter over deep cover this time"
"<b>dropped</b>, it's a shambles! This is miles into the air as he heaves to the leg side. No one seemed to claim the catch and in the end it was Kulasekara who tried, and made a horrid mess of it"
"finally gets his yorker in, can only squeeze it to backward point"

"back of a length over the stumps, dropped down into the turf"

"angled across, 135kph and tapped square"
"full in the channel, Dickwella has opened up his stance and punches through extra cover"
"shovelled over the leg side, four more to Tharanga! Paterson was too straight again and this was swatted to the boundary"
"four more, sliced through gully! Tharanga stepped away to leg, drove away from his body and thick-edged to third man"
"shortish, down the leg side, Tharanga can't connect"
"length ball on the stumps, whipped to leg again, did it carry to midwicket? I don't think so... Hendricks was diving full length but couldn't get his hands under it and the ball bobbled away for one"
"slower ball, Tharanga is duped - and lobs a catch to mid-on! Big yell of delight from Parnell, he's made the breakthrough... The batsman was through his shot early, just flipped it up towards the ring"
"stays over the wicket, fullish outside off, punched into the covers"
"short and pulled, goes swirling into the night sky... and Tahir <b>drops it!</b> Went waaaaaaay up as Chandimal hacked across the line but Tahir, running up from third man, never looked like being in position to take it"
"full and driven, struck well, the bat flowing through, Ngidi does well to cut it off on the dive at cover point - but it looks like he's injured himself in doing so"
"pitched up outside off, pushed wide of mid-off and they scamper through as the throw comes in"
"slashed up and away, four to deep point! Another slower ball from Parnell but it ended up being a long-hop, Dickwella backed away and cut the ball firmly from off stump"
"bowled him, leg stump out of the ground! Chandimal plays around a straight one, Tahir is on the money right away and immediately sets off on a winding, fist-pumping celebratory run. Every time's like the first time"

"another bouncer, gloved on the pull, <b>Mosehle can't grasp this one!</b> The ball flies away through the gloves and away to the boundary this time. The look on Parnell's face..."
"short of a length, Dickwella pulls, gets another top edge -  and this time <b>PARNELL DROPS IT!!!</b> Three in a row, an unwanted hat-trick. Parnell jumped to grab it above his head, mistimed the leap and put down another straightforward chance"

"on the stumps, de Silva works across the line and gets it into a gap for two"

"flat delivery on off stump, Dickwella reverses the hands and swats it away through backward point, nicely played and that's four"

"short outside off, flail and a miss"
"slower ball, Dickwella paddles up and over his shoulder again, just one to fine leg"

"flighted, goes for the leg-side heave... and picks out the catcher on the fence! Dickwella falls after an impressive knock but SL are slipping behind the rate here. Wasn't to the pitch and needed a better connection to clear deep midwicket, in the end a comfortable catch for the captain, Behardian, a few yards in"
"floats up a full toss wide of the stumps, mistimed and dragged down through midwicket for one"
"pushed through quicker on leg stump, clipped square for a single"
"tossed up, nice and slow, entices de Silva out of his crease - and he's stranded, Mosehle completes the stumping! This over could be the decisive one, teasingly flighted legbreak and de Silva was reaching for it, reaching for it, couldn't get to it as he aimed down the ground. Gone"
"flat and fast, beats Mendis's outside edge playing back! So close to a third wicket in the over... Tahir still finishes with a very handy 3 for 18"
"swings hard to leg, sweet connection, is it going all the way...? Yes, but Heino Kuhn, the sub fielder, pulls it back in in mid-air!

"short and wide, big swing and a miss"
"back of a length, Seekkuge heaves to leg, gets a h-u-u-u-u-g-e top edge down towards third man - and Tahir had overrun coming in, it clears his head and bounces away! Oh dear, Immy. Undoes some of his good work with the ball"

"goes for the bouncer, maybe a slower ball - called wide on height"

"strays on to the pads, Seekkuge swings to leg and gets it away, bounces towards the rope at deep backward square!"

"in the channel, another big swing and miss from Seekkuge! Phehlukwayo has strung together two dots"
outrageous! Scooped over the keeper... Phehlukwayo went full outside off and Seekkuge got down on one knee and ramped it for four!
"pitched up on off stump, Gunaratne goes across, gets low... and scoops over short fine leg! Smoothly done and the equation swings even further in SL's direction"
"pitched up, comes forward and <i>hammers</I> a drive, picks out deep cover for one"
"pitched up, good discipline from Paterson, big swing from Seekkuge and he gets an inside edge on to his pads"
"goes for the short ball, swings across the line, the top edge flies away over the keeper! And Gunaratne then grabs a stump, thinking the game was over...! Are SA appealing? Had the ball crossed the boundary? The umpires have told Gunaratne to calm down, puts the stumps back in and we are going to continue"
"pitched up and driven through the covers, that <i>is</i> it! Now the SL players can run out on to the field and celebrate - Gunaratne can take a stump this time, grabbing one at the non-striker's end. <b>Sri Lanka win by five wickets and take the series!</b>"
