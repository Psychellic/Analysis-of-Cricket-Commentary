"starts off with a fullish one that curves into his pads, and Buttler tucks it away through square leg"
"floats it up a little and slides it into the pads again, turned away through backward of square leg"
Short has holed out third ball. That's a poor shot from the batsman. Takes no time to suss out the offspinner and simply swipes. Ashwin flattens his trajectory and slides this into middle and leg. Short expects it to come on with the arm but the ball straightens and as a result finds the outside of the bat as he looks to slog and lobs to midwicket

"walks across for an ill-advised paddle to a back of a length delivery that's around two sets of stumps outside off. Needless to say, gets nowhere near it"
"that's awful bowling. Short and wide, and at Rajpoot's pace, it's a gift for Buttler as he opens up for a late slap through backward point"
"takes out the width but offers up the same length, and angles it into him as well, which allows Buttler to simply rock back and pull through midwicket. A horrific over from Rajpoot"
"short of a length, spins away around off, whipped between long-on and midwicket"
"switches over to a good length outside off, Buttler plays a late cut to backward point and they immediately take off for the single. Rahul takes the bails off, but a dive has saved Rahane"
"short of good length, minimal turn, stays back and whips it to the left of deep midwicket"
backs away to give himself some room on this short of a length delivery and punches it through wide of long-off
moves towards the leg stump and tries to whip it away but the ball follows him and gives him no room as he is pinned on the pad. Comfortably missing leg
turned away to deep midwicket
gets down to sweep a length ball and the ball shoots over the bat past the off-stump
"short of a length on a middle and leg line, mistimes a pull to short fine leg"
"length outside off, meets the line and pats it away to square leg"
"has that been taken? Yes, Chris Gayle with a forward-diving catch. That's as rare a sight you'd see but it's true. Superb take as well. Rahane backed away and was looking to force a cut, but the back of room meant a thick outside edge, which is met by Gayle getting down and stooping low with both hands. They're going upstairs to check but he seems to have done alright. Yup, fingers underneath it. That should be out"

backs away and cuts to cover
"short around off, backs away and cuts through cover"
"gets down for a reverse sweep and misses to get hit on the pad. Given out almost instantly but Buttler reviews. The impact could have been outside off. Spins in a little but this could just be umpire's call on impact. Nope, it's just outside, so overturned"
"flat length ball on middle and leg, punched down to long-on"
"gives him a world of room by floating it up outside off, and it spins in from a length, giving him more leverage on the shot as he swings it over wide long-on for a big six"

"gets up close and personal with another slower ball, this time on middle, and pulls to deep midwicket"
"they are setting up for the slower balls. Samson waits in his power position, feet apart, bat high over his head, and then pulls the slower short ball to long-on"
"that's at top pace, at 132 kph, and it's dug into the middle of the pitch. Buttler thinks about flat-batting it, but it gains too much height. Zips past his nose"
"great connection, as he camps on the back foot, swivels with the pull shot and places it well to the right of the deep square leg fielder"
"misfield from Ashwin at cover, which means a run-out opportunity goes a-begging! He rushes in, alert to the chance of a wicket, but it spins past his right and Samson, who was ball-watching, while his partner Buttler had raced off the blocks, finally ends up able to complete the run and get an extra"

"full on off stump, drives to long-off"
presents the full face and the back of a length ball pings off it to long-off
"shortish and outside off, Buttler wants a single behind point, opens the face looking for the gap, but can't find it"
"shortish on off stump, knocks it down towards short cover and races across to the other end"
"lovely slower ball, mostly because it dips on the batsman, and Buttler is unable to cope with the sudden change in direction. Tries to flick, but it goes off the pad and barely leaves the square"
"draws him outside off with a good length ball and Samson, lunging in search of the ball, is beaten. <b>Knuckle ball</b>, gets a little extra kick"
stands tall against a back of a length delivery and whips it to deep midwicket
"another dipping delivery - this time at top pace - and it messes with Buttler's timing. He has his front leg cleared away. Tye does well to change his line and keep it wide of off stump. As a result, the batsman has to reach out, and ends up mistiming a bunt to long-on"
"bounced out! And so simply done too! Digs it in short. Gets it to rise up towards the batsman's shoulder. Doesn't give him too much room to swing the arms, but Samson chooses to anyway. And sends the ball right down deep square leg's throat"
rises up with the short ball aimed at his body and deflects it to long leg
carrom ball first up to the left-hander. It dips even as Stokes stretches forward to reach it. Misses the flick and hits the pad.
"offbreak, on a good length on off stump, Stokes works it through midwicket"
on the pads and it doesn't spin as Ashwin wants it to. So Buttler can clip the carrom ball out to deep square leg
"good length, on off stump, punches to long-off"
superb hit! It doesn't matter that he's staying back to a ball that's fairly full. All that power he has comes into play the moment he has room to work with and he creams the ball through extra cover
shimmies down the pitch to turn the ball on middle through midwicket
draws him forward on off stump and Stokes flicks to short midwicket
"ooh, that's good stuff. He plays the line - which is wide outside off - and unleashes a reverse sweep. With third man up inside the circle, it's an easy boundary"
backs away to flat bat a quicker delivery on off stump to long-off
rocks back and punches the quick and flat delivery on off stump through cover
"<b>the relay catch</b>! Mayank grabs it at long-off, but he's overbalancing, he knows he will go over the boundary, so he lobs the ball over to Tiwary at long-on and it is seamless. It is poetry. It is very very good. And so Stokes has to go, after smacking a loopy old delivery on leg stump straight down the ground. The percentages were right. But Kings XI outdid him on two counts: Mujeeb followed his moving away to leg stump. And then Mayank stayed supremely calm on the boundary, leapt up to take the catch over his head, and then relayed the ball through at the perfect height to his mate Tiwary"
short and wide and Buttler wallops it to the point boundary to bring up back to back fifties

"no turn again on this length ball, thinks of flicking but is forced to block back"
"another swing and a miss. Oh, jeez, he's been done in non-existent turn here. Expects it to come into him but it simply comes on with the arm outside off"
"after a hundred swings and misses, finally an outside edge has been found. A carrom ball from Mujeeb, Buttler shapes to slap it away but ends up getting severely tucked up due to the lack of room and produces an edge"
"oh, beauty! What a delivery from Mujeeb. Top stuff from the legspinner. A googly that lands right on a length and draws him forward. Archer is unsuspecting and the ball spins right past his inside edge and clatters into the stumps"
"ah, down the leg side. Just back of a length and drifts and spins past his attempted flick"
"pitched up outside off, driven down to long-on"
"length, spinning in outside off, tucks it away through midwicket for a quick brace"
blocks this length ball that spins in extra and takes the inside of the bat into the leg side
"drifts it away outside off this time, and Gowtham blocks off the outside of the bat"
"ah, bad misfield at third man boundary from young Mujeeb. Gowtham slashed at the sight of a hint of width. Still not enough and he gets an edge that eventually gets to the boundary as Mujeeb over-runs to his right"

backs away to one that comes into him and tries to go over the in-field on the off side. Skewed off the outside of the bat and the ball lands in front of point moving to his right
swivels and pulls a short one but deep backward square leg moves to his left and gets around it
"extremely full on leg stump, looks to reverse it and jams it out to point"
"and a wicket seals what has been a top effort from Kings XI on the field. A slower ball again, and Unadkat holds no shape as he tries to pull. They try to steal a bye but a direct hit from Rahul catches Shreyas short of his ground"

"cramps him with a full delivery on middle, from around the wicket, Gayle blocks it"
"opens the face as he guides a good length ball on off stump, with the turn, to point"
fires it through on middle and leg and strikes Gayle on the pads. <b>Big shout for lbw</B> but it would have gone down leg

"tries to slap a back of a length ball that affords him room through point, but the fielder dives to his right and saves a boundary"
forces Rahul back with a shortish delivery on off stump. The batsman blocks it into the off side
"another very good short ball, angling into the body and always rising up on the batsman. Rahul is in discomfort as he fends it away towards square leg."
"<b>beats him</b> with a peach! At 147 kph, this good length ball holds its line from around the wicket and try as Gayle might to block it, he simply cannot touch this"
"147.8 kph, short, a little wide, and it bounces over Gayle's cut shot. The big man is coming off second best"
backs away and carves the 137 kph short ball to the point boundary. A shot that is meant to dictate terms.
"oooh, this is a battle! Archer's angle from around the wicket, and his line of attack, going short and at the body, is not fun for Gayle. He backs away and blocks this with his bottom hand flying off his bat"
"he is ever so good! Even with the offspinner wants to cramp him for room, Rahul backs away and cuts a ball on leg stump to the point boundary"
<b>bounces over the stumps</b>! Rahul tries to cut a ball that's way too full and gets a bottom edge. Buttler is in agony as he watches the ball bounce over leg stump
attempts the sweep with Gowtham firing it down leg. Doesn't connect
"<b>reverse sweep</b>, and it's done effortlessly. He knows Gowtham wil lbowl on leg stump. And that gives him a leg up. He knows a general area of where the ball will be, he knows third man is up, and he takes advantage"
shuffles across on off stump and scoops it over short fine leg!
tosses it up wide outside off and Rahul drives to cover
shapes to cut a quicker delivery outside off and hits it to point

"<b>aaarrrgghh</b>, screams Gayle as he absolutely wallops a short and wide delivery straight to point! Kings XI have ridden on the openers' performance in this IPL. And this early wicket is going to test their middle order. Lucky breakthrough because this looked like it would have made a hole through the boundary boards and gone off to Mumbai"
gets up off his toes to pull the short ball away to long leg
"goes for the short one, but it goes way over Rahul's head, and down leg too."
taps it behind square leg and pinches a couple as well. Good work from Rahul. Plays with soft hands and had a partner who was willing to put in a little extra effort. Karnataka boys going well.
gorgeous on-drive as he fronts a 149 kph delivery and hits it with a lot of class
"144kph, waits for the good length ball on leg stump and turns it to square leg."

"shimmies over to off stump and gets a short ball at his hip. Fine leg is inside the circle, so the pull shot is on. Just doesn't connect well enough"
"looks for the drive through cover, but he is into the shot too early and an inside edge takes it through midwicket"
"<b>straight to long leg</b>! And it's a rip-roaring shot too! Agarwal picks the short ball early, gets inside the line and tears the leather off it with a pull shot. But he forgets all about placement, which is just fine for Stokes, Tripathi and the Royals"
"<b>falls short</b> of Rahane at second slip! Lovely delivery to the new batsman, hitting a good length, probing in the off-stump corridor. Nair pokes at it, gets an outside edge, but he's played with hands just about soft enough"
"<b>fumble by Gopal</b> at third man, and so another beautiful delivery, pitched up, outside off yields a result the Royals don't like. Nair throws his hands at this too, gets a thick edge, and Gopal, running around on the edge of the boundary makes a mess"

"good length on off stump, defends"
"looks for the gap past short fine leg with a pull shot, but can't find it"

nails the half-volley down the ground! In the slot on middle stump and Nair keeps the front leg away and presents the full face
"slower ball outside off and he thwacks it to short cover. Loads of sensational hitting tonight, most yielding no runs or wickets"
"shortish and outside off, Nair chops it down to third man"
"full and outside off, Rahul slices it to deep third man"
hangs back against the short ball on leg stump and pats it down to long-on
"<b>leading edge</b> but it finds its way through to long-off. Karun tries to come down the track, Gopal pulls his length back, the batsman plays against the turn, and what little comes off the pitch, produces a mis-hit"
keeps going short - perhaps he's worried Rahul too would stride down the pitch - but the batsman is happily slinking back to pull to the square leg boundary

"flat, back of a length, shuffles across to meet the pitch before whipping it between long-on and deep midwicket"
"oh, shot! Just steps out of his crease and he hasn't even got right to the pitch. But what he does is make sure to give himself enough room before launching it over extra cover with a free extension of the arms. Hits the boundary cushion on the full. Or has it? The TV umpire has multiple slow-mo replays to look at it. Eventually decides it's a six. Top shot"
"length ball that slides in with the arm around middle and leg, blocked off the backfoot to the left of the bowler"
"fullish length on the fourth-stump channel, whipped away to the right of long-on"
"full outside off, Rahul punchily slams it over the bowler's outstretched hand towards long-off"
"length ball, darted in on the pads, too easy for Karun, who picks it up off his pads and launches it over backward square leg"
"short of a length, lets it come on before tucking it to deep square leg. The fielders in the deep are at midwicket and backward square leg, and the batsmen push back for the second as they converge on the ball"
"ah, bad ball to get out to. Karun tries to fetch a pull from way outside off and gets an under-edge onto the stumps. Timely strike for Royals, ends a burgeoning stand"
"length ball around middle, whips it away to deep square leg"
punched to mid-on for a quick single
"short of a length outside off, opens the face to backward point"

advances down the ground and drills it to cover
"full and flat on leg, driven down to long-on"
"caught at the boundary! D'Arcy Short snaffles a smart catch at deep midwicket. A length ball around middle, Axar tries to loft it over the leg side but is done in by the lack of room. Skews it off the lower part of the bat to Stoinis who jumps back and makes sure to land just inside the boundary as he grabs it reverse-cupped"
shuffles across to a length ball and blocks
"pitches it up outside his off-stump, Rahul reaches out for a drive to extra cover"
"takes it away from his off-stump, and Rahul reaches out to drill it towards point"
"floated up and turning away slightly outside off, Stoinis shuffles and keeps the bat inside the line"
"Stoinis sees the shorter length and tries to cut but with no room available, gets beaten"
that's easy. Flights up a length ball with ample room. Stoinis has his nose under it as he pummels it straight over
"short of a length, straightening from middle, Stoinis whips it to mid-on"
"he wants to keep from giving Stoinis room, but in that effort, he bowls short and down leg and is wided"
"back of a length on off stump, Stoinis blocks with an open face"
"<b>flies past the keeper</b>! These offcutters are getting some purchase tonight, enough to have Stoinis playing a loose shot, the bat reaching in front of his body, the feet going nowhere. A thick edge results, Buttler dives full-length to his right, but he has no chance"
"goes around the wicket for a pitched-up offcutter which Stoinis defends, careful not to be sucked into playing the angle and popping a leading edge"
<b>direct hit would have had Stoinis</b>! Rahane at extra cover has one stump to aim at. And only misses it by a clump of whiskers! Another slower ball from Unadkat throws up great action
"insists he has taken the catch and Samson might just have turned the game with <b>a one-handed stunner</b>! The on-field officials take it to the third umpire, but the <b>soft signal is not out</b>. First replays indicate the ball might just have touched the turf before Samson scoops it up. So Rahul can heave a sigh of relief and think about improving on that cut shot. He did make room to try and get the gap to the left of point. And almost managed it too."
"full and outside off, Rahul drives to deep cover"
"short ball at 114 kph, Rahul pulls it to deep square leg"
"looks for the blockhole at 140 kph, Stoinis clears his front leg and inside edges his slog to square leg"
"sweet drive through point, leaning on his front leg, getting close to the good length ball outside off and treating it exactly as he would in a Test match."
walks out of his crease and whips a full delivery from outside off to the right of long-on
meets the slower ball out of his crease again and pulls it down to deep backward square leg
"another slower ball, looping up and dipping in towards the base of off stump. Stoinis winds up but gets another inside edge to short fine leg"
flicks the back of a length delivery at 110 kph to deep square leg. Good hustle to get a couple
that's a timely strike! The bowler searches for the blockhole and overpitches. The batsman stands perfectly still and laces it through the covers.
"nails the yorker this time at 145 kph, Stoinis jams a straight bat down to find a single at long-off"
"<b>upper cut to the fifty</b>! Indore is screaming his name and he responds with one of the shots of the match. The pressure is mounting, he has chosen to ignore it expressly so he can bat through the innings. Now he sees a bouncer outside off, he senses a chance to get under it and ramp it over the boundary"
"yorker again, at 146 kph, Rahul digs it out to cover and wants a new bat. Some serious heat on these deliveries"
works it right in between midwicket and long-on on the boundary and that placement earns him a second run.
backs away and carves a 118 kph back of a length delivery on off stump to the sweeper cover
"full and outside off, Rahul slams it to deep cover and they pinch a couple again. This is super work from Kings XI, assuming Stoinis has stretched far enough to make his ground at the non-strikers. And he has. This is a small ground, people, and these guys are absolutely stealing doubles."
"shifts over the wicket and is sent over the fence at long leg! Rahul has been starving himself of runs just so that he can feast in the death! All through the middle overs he's been dabbing the ball for singles and twos. And now, at the pointy end, he's swivelling on the back foot and pulling short balls to oblivion"
around the wicket and it doesn't work! It just doesn't work! Rahul is batting on another level. He sees the length earlier than he should. He can only see the gaps. And so his backing away and cutting the ball between point and short third man is academic really
"back of a length on off stump, Rahul comes out of his crease to try and nudge it through midwicket but ends up getting a leading edge through cover. <b>Highest IPL score for Rahul</b>"
"slower ball on middle, Stoinis blocks"
"targets the blockhole again, but Rahul clears his front leg and smears it to long-off. The crowd is going bonkers. They scream 'Ra-hul! Ra-hul! Ra-hul!"
what a strike! He stares down a 147 kph length ball and smacks it straight down the ground. Absolute class!
"another two! Rahul expects the slower ball, he holds his shape, nudges it to the left of deep square leg and catches the fielder dozing"
"<b>that's the win</b>! Low full toss and he smashes it through to the extra cover boundary and celebrates with a fist-pump! The Holkar Stadium is roaring. They've been chanting his name all through the death overs but now it's an incoherent scream of joy. The home team has won, and it's on the back of a sensational innings."
