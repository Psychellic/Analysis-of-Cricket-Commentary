whoops. Loose and leg-sided. Radar awry
"another spear down the leg side, slightly less of a wild delivery this time, to be fair. Shaping the ball into the right-hander, but overdoing it"
"that's better from Holder, climbing off the deck into the thigh pad"
"on the toes, too predictable from Holder, and Bairstow clips it fiercely away through square leg"
"leg-sided once more, a poor over, Bairstow tucks the ball into the gap and his lightning legs pick off an easy three through midwicket"
"outside off for a change, back of a length, patted to cover"
"blocked to point and that's a crazy single! Kyle Hope swoops and shies, and Bairstow would have been gone by half the pitch!"
"blocked into the off side, no way through there"
"nibble off the deck, hitting the pitch hard and Hales wears this one on the inner thigh"
"whittled off the pads, travels with pace to deep square leg"
"tucked into the leg side once again, slightly too straight, but an awkward skiddy length"
"crunched! Too full, no swing, and Hales leans onto the front foot to present a powerful full face through the covers"
"back-foot drive! Same shot, really, but with a fractional recalibration from cover to point. Timed so sweetly"
"tighter line, blocked"
"full length outside off, punched to cover"
"back of a length, and that's a cunning little dab to third man"
