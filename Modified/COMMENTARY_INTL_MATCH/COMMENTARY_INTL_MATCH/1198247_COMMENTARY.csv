"pitched up, firmly driven to mid-off. Lovely feeling of ball hitting the middle of the bat for Stirling"
"first runs, and it comes off a thickish inside edge to deep midwicket. A brace and Ireland are away"
"shortens his length on middle, defended back"
"chipped straight to midwicket! It's full and swinging in, Stirling errs by not going through with the shot and hit it in the air for the dolly to be taken. Was it a trap? It perhaps was. The top hand came off the handle from Stirling as he went through, so it lobbed off a thickish inside edge too."
"nice and full, slanted across, solidly defended"
"squirted again past short midwicket, once again played down the wrong line."
"lifter outside off, left alone"

right behind the line as he defends
good leave to a length ball that nips back in from the sixth stump line
helped along to fine leg
"nicked and gone! Slanted this across on a length, Balbirnie is sucked into a drive that wasn't on. This one held its line and didn't come back in. Regulation catch for Bairstow. Ireland in early trouble"
"and he defends the first ball quite nicely, off the backfoot"
"good ball again, slants on a length, skids through to the keeper as Tector leaves"
jaffa! Waits for this to angle in while it pitches on middle and nips away to beat the edge. Phew

driven straight to extra cover
just wide of the diving Jason Roy at second slip! Lucky runs. Genuine edge as he's squared up
"clobbered! Picked the length early, swiveled and pulled it in front of square"
"make that three in a row and this is the best of the lot! This has been absolutely crunched through cover. Too full, transferred his weight forward and eased that away beautifully"
"nips back in from outside off, pushed to mid-off"
right on top of the bounce as he defends
"pulled but not in control, rolls wide of midwicket"
"full and angling away, Tector wants to go for a drive but bails out in the end"
"slants one across, shorter in length, left alone"
"he's given this a hokey pokey! Left leg out of the way, belted down the ground over the bowler's head. Woah, where did that come from?"
"scorcher! Sweetly timed to bisect cover and point. Not a half-volley but he went through without the fear of being consumed by late movement, sweeeeeeet"
tucks this to the leg side
has he gloved this to the keeper? Very close it was. Looked to walk across and take on the short ball. Aggressive intent
beaten as he goes chasing a wide delivery
"driven straight to point, still not off the mark"
"angles in from wide of the crease, right behind the line in defence is Tector"
"chopped on! Looking to force this into the off side with hard hands, was cramped for room and went cross-bat. Ended up being caught neither here nor there. Was it the desperation to get off the mark that got him? We'll find out this evening."
defended off the backfoot
driven firmly but straight to cover point. Wicket maiden
driven firmly to mid-off
"drilled straight to backward point! The freefall continues. Bowled it full and wide, there for the drive and Delany just skewed it low to the right of Banton."
"fourth for Willey and it has come about through a sensible review. Pitched on middle and leg, came back in a wee bit to hit him in front as he tried to work it across the line. Height was in question, I thought, but no. Replays confirm this would've smashed leg stump."

covers the line as he defends
"goes after the drive, not timed well enough. Straight to cover point"
"this is lovely, played very nicely into the gap at extra cover as he got to the pitch of the delivery. Good work from Tom Curran, sprinting away before throwing in a dive to pull it back"

"eased into the gap at wide long-off, called for two and got it quite easily"

"full toss and belted, good work by Willey, diving to his left after covering some ground at long-off"
"skiddy short of length delivery, rises with the bounce and dabs it to gully"
