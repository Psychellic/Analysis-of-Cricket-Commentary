"back of a length at middle stump, spins away as he slogs across the line. Can't get enough power as a result, long-on cleans up to his right"
"<b>holes out to long-off.</b> Tossed up generously at leg stump. He offers the angled bat to try and hit skywards into the leg side, but he's not to the pitch. The ball spins enough to get the outside half of the bat and it is lobbed straight to Morgan"

"make that 1 off 12 balls. Back of a length, swings back in towards off stump, punched back to the bowler"

"full on off stump, driven firmly on the up and Samson dives to his right to stop it at mid-off. Saved three there"
"back of a length outside off, stabbed to backward point"
"ooh, nearly. Looks to drive one that's too full and too close to off stump to be hitting into the covers, and inside-edges it. He's lucky the ball stops a foot or so after hitting the bat, because that could have rolled onto the stumps"

"back of a length close to off stump, punched to long-off"
"fullish on middle stump, clipped to long-on"
"gone! He sees fine leg inside the circle and looks for the cute paddle past the fielder. Picked the wrong ball for it, though.

Hit him in line, and Hawkeye says it straightened enough to hit a good chunk of leg stump"

"back of a length, too much width. Amla says thank you for the swinging room, and flat-bats over mid-off"

"down the track now, and he gets closer to the pitch than he'd have liked, maybe. Hits it in the air, straight to extra-cover, where Zaheer claims a low catch. They're checking with the third umpire - soft signal is out. Fingers seem to be under the ball, and his hand seems to be an inch or so above the turf. Yup, he's gone."

"back of a length close to off stump, dabbed to backward point"
"shot. That's a full ball on off stump, and the trademark Amla shuffle has manufactured a boundary. Fine leg is in the circle, and he gets across to glance it to the fielder's right"
"full-toss, knee-high, and Amla has picked out deep square leg! I think he was looking to hit that a little finer, but it may have been a slower ball - slower than he thought, at least - and he hit his flick straight to the fielder, off the leading edge or that side of his bat anyway"
"fullish on off stump, pushed into the covers for a quick single. Billings moved to his right from extra-cover and fired a throw at the keeper's end. Morgan was gone if he'd hit"
"a touch short outside off, and he rocks back to slap that to the right of cover, where Billings makes a super diving stop"
"short on off stump and Morgan is in position in a flash to pull that away through midwicket. Didn't really have to move much at all, from his wide stance"
"back of a length on leg stump, clipped to the right of square leg"
"shortish on middle and leg. Miller steps across to pull into the square-leg region. Wasn't as short as the one Morgan pulled for four, and consequently he couldn't get the same kind of power into this shot"
"back of a length close to off stump, chopped down to backward point"
"back of a length outside off, guided down to third man"
"ooh, that was quick, and it may have come back in just a touch. Back of a length, Miller was looking to defend with a straight bat, and it just zipped past his inside edge"

"back of a length on middle and off, shuffles across to tuck that down to fine leg"

"length ball on middle and leg. Looks to push towards mid-off, with the angle, only manages an inside edge down to long leg"

"full on off stump, driven to long-off"
"back of a length, pitching on off and slanting further away. No footwork from Miller, looks to jab at it and the ball beats his outside edge"
"back of a length on leg stump, looks to shuffle across and work it through backward square leg. Misses, the ball hits his thigh pad, and the combined effort of swivelling through his shot and running to the other end makes him slip and stumble a third of the way through his run"
"shortish outside off, looks to slap it through point and misses"
"down the track and Cummins bowls an off-stump ball on a nice length - not full enough to hit down the ground, not short enough to cut. Goes for option 2 and chops it into the pitch off the inside edge. They sneak a quick run"
"pace, lots of it. Not for the first time this over, a batsman looks to flay a shortish ball through point and gets beaten - a little late on his shot"
"back of a length on off stump, punched back to the bowler"
"back of a length on middle stump, goes deep in his crease to pull to long-on"

"full outside off, and Morgan puts it away, flat-bats it to the right of mid-off"
"shortish on off stump, pulled to long-on"
"ooh, lucky. Length ball angling across, maybe a tiny bit of movement back in. Looks to drive on the up through the covers and inside-edges it past his leg stump"
"short, wide, slapped away to the left of the diving backward point fielder. Not even a despairing sprint and dive from the sweeper can cut that off. Mishra dived at point, Corey at sweeper cover"
"another cuttable ball, and this time he cuts in the air and Karun Nair takes the catch at backward point. He was initially moving to his left, and in the end had to adjust and fall to his right"
"starts another over with a googly, slapped away through point"
"full on middle and off, defended into the covers"
"Gone! Maxwell goes for the big slog from an off-stump line, is hitting that against the turn, top-edges it, and can only hit it down deep midwicket's throat"
"back of a length on off stump, legbreak, clipped with the turn to deep midwicket"
"back of a length, googly, pitches outside off, turns further away. Punched into the covers"
"tossed up wide of off, looks like another googly, but he doesn't mind hitting against the turn. Connects sweetly and sends it soaring a long way beyond the midwicket boundary. Nope, I've watched a replay and that was a legbreak."

"full, fairly wide outside off, driven firmly and straight to extra-cover"

"back of a length on middle stump, stays leg-side of the ball and pushes with a straight bat through cover"
"low full-toss outside off, jabbed away to the left of the keeper"
"shortish outside off, punched away through point. They decide to risk a second, Billings throws to the bowler's end, and Zaheer is behind the stumps but doesn't really attempt to collect it, with the batsman a long way short - the throw bounced at an awkward spot, very near the stumps, in mitigation"
