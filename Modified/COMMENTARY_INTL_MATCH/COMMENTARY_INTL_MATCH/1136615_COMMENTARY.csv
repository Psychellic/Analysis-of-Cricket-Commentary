"short and drifting into middle and leg, whipped to backward square leg to get off the mark. Tumbling stop there by Surya, I think. Little wide and that was four."

"angles in a full ball on off from wide of the crease, defended solidly."

right back in the crease as he defends this incoming length ball to midwicket

"wallops this short ball up and over the ring, but there's long-on specifically for that kind of stroke from Shaw"
"slower and fuller outside off, Maxwell takes a step across as he looks to whack this over cover, played too late. On the bounce to Ishan Kishan."
"<strong>punchy drive, beats mid-off.</strong> No chance for Krunal even though he was no more than a couple of yards away from the ball. That just kept gathering speed."
works this off his hip to deep square leg
"pulled behind square. Nice timing, once he beat short fine, he was always assured of a boundary. Too short, Shaw fetched it from outside off."
"<strong>what laziness, Shaw was taking a Sunday stroll and has to walk back.</strong> Defended to point by Maxwell, he called no and turned back immediately. Shaw was no more than four or five yards outside the crease even as Pandya threw the ball direct at the bowler's end. This is very poor, lack of game awareness. He didn't even make an attempt to get back in. Completely taken aback by Hardik Pandya's throw. Virender Sehwag like."
stands tall and punches this to cover point.
"off-cutter at length and angling away, steered to third man"
"grips the surface, bounces extra. Maxwell slices this punch on the bounce to backward point."
"hits the hard length, on middle. Defended to extra cover."

"goes downtown, one bounce to the long-off boundary. Spotted the change in pace, but this was too full and he got to the pitch and have it a whack. Picked the slower delivery immediately."
"looks to pull, but is beaten for pace. Angling down leg, wide called."
bit of an <strong>inside edge onto the pad</strong> as he looked to hoick this over midwicket. Stifled appeal from Bumrah
"<b> right through, 144kph. </b> Maxwell's forgettable IPL is over. Bumrah gives him the silent treatment. Maxwell went for a glory hit, trying to belt this up and over his head. But the ball angled back in to sneak in off a big inside edge and flatten leg stump. This is the fourth time Bumrah has dismissed Maxwell."
gets half a stride in and defends this back towards the bowler.
"short of length delivery slanting away, defended from the crease."
punches this wide of mid-on to get off the mark.
"delightful from Pant. Picks the length, stands tall and punches this between cover and point. What timing, special stroke. Who said his game's just about biffing the ball? Held the pose for the cameras too!"
"full and sliding into the pads, flicked superbly into the gap towards deep backward square leg."
dabbed to short third man for a quick single
"driven but can't pick the gap, straight to cover point."
"through the pull even before the short of length cutter arrived, on the bounce to Ishan Kishan."

"length on middle and leg, knocked to deep midwicket."

slaps this short delivery straight to sweeper cover
"dabs this gently into the off side, towards short third man, as they jog the single"
"back of length angling away, Pant stands tall and punches this to cover."
"pulled from outside off to square leg, no control over the stroke, so no timing. Rohit hits direct at the striker's end, but there's no real danger of Iyer being out there because he was comfortably in."
"slides one away, Pant looks at Dharmasena in anticipation of a wide, but not given and rightly so."
"this is tremendous! There's deep midwicket and deep square, but he bisects the field again. Goes back deep into the crease and whip-pulls this. Strong bottom hands as well. Timed magnificently"
"turns this gently to square leg, sensible"
steps out and works this to short midwicket where Mustafizur misfields to give away a single
reaches out to slap this short delivery to sweeper cover
"oh, dear. He's hit this straight down the throat of deep midwicket. Too short, he picked the correct ball to pull, a googly, pulled but didn't connect as well as he would've liked. Krunal was mindful of the ropes behind him. He was no more than an inch or two in front of the ropes. After a promising start, Iyer has ended the season with a string of ordinary performances."
pulled down to deep midwicket
"uses the pace and then times this to perfection. Short third man had no chance. Short, hint of width and Shankar just laced it away."

"<b> that's a one-handed wallop </b>, dragged it from outside off to a slower ball, but it just sailed over wide long-on. Massive from Pant."
"belts this to hit Fizz flush on the toe as it deflects towards mid-on. They scamper back for the second because of the overthrow. <B> Fizz takes his left shoe off, awkward landing as well because he twisted his left leg </b>"
driven firmly to mid-off. Bowled this full and slanted this across to Pant
"belted back down the ground, Fizz can't stop this on his followthrough, deflects it to long-on. <b> Pant's fifth 50 plus score in seven innings. </b> This one off 34 balls"
"slashes, but gets a thick edge that runs wide of the keeper to the third man boundary"
"<strong>now he shows he can reverse pull as well!</strong> This one sails over third man. Helped of course by the length, too short. Pant had enough time to change his blade, half-stance and of course help that over. Raises the half-century stand"
"hit on the pad to a full delivery he looks to whip over midwicket, but this pitched miles outside leg, and hit him outside leg as well. Thank god for DRS, that was a <strong>horrendous decision from umpire CK Nandan.</strong>"
"slips a length ball down leg, Pant helps this along to beat short fine leg. Off the thigh pad, missed the bat. Races away."
"<strong>one-handed whack, sails over deep midwicket!</strong> At the moment, he can even bat blindfolded and hit them for sixes, by the looks of it. Slower, too full and he got underneath that to muscle that away. Magnificent, unbelievable"
"looks for the reverse lap, gave away his intention too early. missed it"
drills this straight to mid-off.
"whipped over the infield, down to brother Hardik"
slapped to the man at the edge of the ring at extra cover.
"fires one into the blockhole, Pant somehow manages to jam his bat down to keep it out."
"sees him winding up and fires this full and wide, Pant reaches out for a wallop, <strong>loses his shape, balance</strong> but somehow manages to skews it into the gap at sweeper cover."
"holes out to long-on. Didn't get to the pitch of the ball, went through with the lofted it, but no elevation. Straightforward catch to Pollard. End of a magnificent innings."
flicks this low full toss on middle and leg to deep midwicket
"length angling away, steered towards point"
"punches this straight to extra cover, big mix up with the running. Shankar was a long way down when he was sent back, a <strong>direct hit at the striker's end by Hardik and he would've been gone.</strong>"
"walks across to pull, mistimes it towards Rohit coming in from deep midwicket"
"that is sensational from the Under-19 boy! This is too short, he lines himself up properly and muscles this pull into the second tier. He's all of 17 but the shape and his timing is just magnificent. Crisp, clean strike against one of the better death bowlers."
"sliced over cover, on the bounce to Ewin Lewis. Could he have gone for the catch? <strong>Looks like Lewis bailed out</strong>"
squeezes this yorker-length delivery outside off towards mid-on
"too full on the pads, flicked to fine leg"
"sliced over, just eludes Rohit, who runs to his right from short third man. <b> Goes down as a dropped chance nevertheless </b>. Slower and fuller from Bumrah, Shankar had to reach out to play this one"
makes room and lofts this inside-out to long-off.
"misses the yorker, turns out to be a half-volley that is drilled to sweeper cover."
"aims for a yorker at the base of leg stump, gets it wrong, even if not too far away. Wide called by Dharmasena"
"squeezes this yorker-length delivery back past the bowler, to long-on"
"slips this down leg, he looked to tickle this fine but missed."
"high full toss, was it above the waist? He's thumped this to <strong>Rohit, who hurts his left shoulder</strong> in trying to attempt the catch. He's not wincing in pain but is in some discomfort. The physio attends to him immediately. <b> Another drop </b>"
"full and angling wide, Shankar looks to reach out and slice this over but misses."
"juicy full toss on leg stump, swung away into the gap at deep backward square leg."
"lofted, but on the bounce to long-on. No timing again"
"toe-ends a slog, went midwicket, got this to point. They scamper a run"
"launched straight back over, this smashes into the sightscreen. Massive strike, right in his hitting arc. Shankar got the timing right this time. Can't bowl length. Held his shape superbly, held pose for the cameras later."
slaps this slower delivery to long-off
"swings and misses, they scamper a bye. Daredevils have ended well."
"oh that's tripe to start. A short legbreak, a filthy long-hop on middle and the batsman pulls merrily over midwicket"
"4 and now 6. Another poor delivery, short and on the pads. Suryakumar stays low and pulls the ball over backward square leg for six."
"just over cover! He hit that with the spin. A legbreak outside off, Suryakumar gets underneath the length and lofts the ball over the infield."
"12 runs and a wicket in the opening over so far! Lamichhane strikes, a googly down leg, Suryakumar looks to work the ball through midwicket but a leading edge carries all the way to Shankar at long-on. He ran in quite a bit and took a good catch."
"a googly outside off, worked to midwicket"
"googly, on middle and off. Kishan gets forward and defends to cover."
"a short delivery outside off, swinging away, pulled away through midwicket for a run."
"back of a length, and slightly wide outside off, cut to backward point"
"beauty! A full delivery on middle, it straightens after pitching, towards off. Kishan is drawn into a leg-side stroke, which is why he's opened up as he defends"
"too full this time, on middle, blocked to mid-on"
"138 kph, full and straight, more away movement, chipped towards mid-on from the crease."
"terrific over from Boult, short outside off. Kishan tries to lace a cut through backward point but makes no contact"
"flat around off, chopped towards extra cover"
"nicely bowled again, full outside off, defended to cover"
"three dots! Lots of flight on that as well, defended"
"shortish and wide outside off, swatted towards cover, who lazily fields and allows one"
"darted in, quick, worked to long-on"
"flat and straight, Lewis skews a lofted drive away towards midwicket via the inside half."
"poor ball. Overpitched outside off, drilled away through cover with so much ease. No hassle at all."
"<strong>dropped</strong>! Full and wide outside off, smashed through to cover. About knee height for Vijay Shankar. The ball just pops out and goes to Iyer at a straighter cover. Iyer picks the ball and misses the stumps at the bowler's end, <strong>well out had Iyer hit</strong>. Boult does the backing up."
"full outside off, tapped down to third man off the open face"
"poor delivery again. It's full and wide outside off, right in the slot to loft the ball over cover. Iyer can't chase it down either. The length is not very good."
"and smashed over midwicket! 128 kph, a short delivery outside off, sits up for Lewis at that pace and walloped with the cross bat."
"that's an awful over. A 122 kph slower ball, but it's wide outside off. He can bowl that now because there is a sweeper cover in place."
"flat outside off, pushed to cover. Kishan is sent back, makes it back with a full-length dive"
"six more! Lewis on fire. Flat outside off, Lewis steps out and nails a lofted drive right back. Over the bowler's head"
"flat and wide outside off, punched to cover"
"again, this is much flatter through, smashed to cover"
"short and down leg, Leiws works the ball easily over square leg. Got underneath the ball enough"
"six to finish the over! Lots of flight on off, Lewis comes down and hits it straight again. Full face, loads of power over long-off"
"a slower ball drifts down leg, wide."
"good length on off, tapped towards backward point for a run"
"down leg again, another wide."
"strays on the pads, doesn't want to offer room. Clipped to deep square leg"

"138 kph, full on middle and off, punched to mid-off"
"too straight again, worked to deep square leg"
"<b>out again with a direct hit</b>. Short outside off, slapped to mid-off for a single. The bowler picks up neatly but misses at the non-striker's end."
"strikes first ball does Mishy! Kishan picks out long-on. The first ball after the time-out too. He picked that ball to attack well, ran to the pitch of the legbreak and launched a swat to long-on. Shankar runs around the boundary nicely, to his left, and takes a good reverse-cupped catch with his feet inches away from the boundary."
"starts with a googly, down leg. Pollard misses a flick. Struck on the pad."
"goes right through! The googly outside off, Pollard gets forward and prods but the ball finds a massive gap between bat and pad. Does not hit the stumps"
"Prithvi Shaw having a shocker! <strong>An eaaaaasssy catch dropped</strong>. A flighted legbreak outside off, Mishra has done Pollard in all ends up. So he goes after a slog sweep, gets a thick outside edge at head height to slip. The ball just goes through his fingers, and then he looks at the ball, doesn't even go after it. Very sloppy work."
"flat and straight, pushed back to the bowler."
"very quick down leg, swept away powerfully to deep backward square leg"
"full and straight, pushed to cover"
"a shorter delivery down leg, pulled to deep backward square leg."
"<strong>dropped again</strong>! This is a much tougher chance, but dropped nonetheless. Full outside off, a thick outside half travels to backward point's left. Abhishek Sharma leaps to his left, but can't catch as the ball bursts out."
"<b>hit on the side of the helmet!</b> A short slower ball around off and Lewis is through his shot too early. Because he's early through it, the side of the helmet meets the ball, and the ear! Needs some treatment, maybe a new helmet too."
"strays down leg, worked to deep backward square leg for one"
"back of a length on middle, worked to deep square leg where guess who misfields. Shaw again. When your confidence is low, things never go your way, but he has only himself to blame. Extremely sloppy cricket."
"a googly down leg, worked to midwicket"
"the big slog sweep, goes past Lewis. Lots of flight on that googly and Lewis can't make contact"
"a low full toss outside off, drilled to long-off"
"a flatter one down leg, worked to deep midwicket"
"not the best line. It's another googly but well down leg, Lewis top-edges this slog sweep and gets it behind square. Enough timing and power for six, lands on the boundary cushion."
"Mishra strikes again! Follows that up with a terrific googly, but it's wider outside off. Lewis doesn't read the variation, he just runs down and slogs across the line. Mishra's wiles ensure the ball is short enough to allow room for turn and bounce to beat the slog. Pant does the rest."
"sensational stuff from Maxwell and Boult! Boult has taken tougher ones than this, but this was Maxwell's catch. A legbreak around middle and leg, the ball was exceptionally full so Pollard went straight, full face and flat. Maxwell runs around to his left and takes a reverse-cupped catch, but he's falling over so he just throws the ball to Boult nonchalantly, running in from long-off. The best thing about that catch was that Boult ran towards Maxwell when the ball was in the air, realised very early what was at stake."
"a googly down leg, Krunal sweeps that very fine for four. The fielder runs around and misfields. Surprise, surprise. This time the fielder is Harshal"
"googly outside off, the ball beats the bat."
"chipped to cover! And Mumbai are collapsing, like RCB yesterday. A googly again outside off, Krunal just drives loosely and finds short cover. Very loose hands, just throwing his hands at the ball."
"a very full delivery outside off, driven to long-on"
"another googly outside off, driven to deep cover for one."
"flat outside off, tapped in front of point for a run."
"the flat dart on off, Hardik gets forward and blocks"
"shortish and wide outside off, punched away past cover for a couple."
"short and wide, sliced to deep cover for a run"
"shortish outside off, punched away to long-on for a run"
"quick and straight, pushed away to long-on. Six off the over"
"got underneath that sufficiently! Lots of flight on that, around off. Hardik clears his front leg and slogs the ball easily over long-on for a massive six."
"four more! Flat and wide outside off, Hardik drills a drive past cover for four more. Lots of power on that."
"leg side-ish, and flicked away easily to the deep midwicket fielder"
"short and wide outside off, cut away to backward point for a run"
"the googly on off, clipped to midwicket"
"well bowled. Flat around off, pushed to cover for a quick single. Rohit puts in a dive and makes the single despite some quick work from Pant."
"good length, on the pads, worked to deep midwicket"
"a slower, very wide delivery outside off is called"
"the wide yorker outside off, Rohit opens the bat face and guides the ball through backward point for four."
"slower ball down leg, worked to deep midwicket"
"overthrows! Four? Short and wide outside off, hit to Iyer at cover, who takes aim and throws at the non-striker's end. The backing-up from deep midwicket isn't very good, Harshal runs around from square leg and attempts to keep the ball in the field of play, fails to do so. The umpire calls five overthrows, shouldn't it be four overthrows? That's absurd."
"full and wide outside off, driven to deep cover."
"poor delivery. Drifts down leg and Hardik flicks the ball very fine, past backward square leg for four."
"a slower ball outside off, worked in the gap for two, at midwicket"
"full outside off, flicked to long-on for a run"
"131 kph, quick outside off, a good length delivery, creeps under Hardik's bat"
good stop by Pant! Harshal drifts well down leg for a wide. Pant gets across to his left and stops four extras
"full and straight, patted back towards mid-on"
"and again! <strong>Maxwell and Boult combine for another relay catch</strong>! A full delivery around off, Rohit stays in his crease and lofts the ball towards long-on. Maxwell runs to his left again takes a good catch again and throws the ball back to Boult again, who walks in from long-off. Maxwell has a complaint about the ease of Boult's catches with him doing all the hard work."
"a short delivery on leg, Pandya walks across and looks to flick the ball fine, but fails to make contact. Over leg stump that was."
"flat on middle and leg, pushed towards cover."
"looking for the fine paddle sweep, was very slow from Mishra, the ball climbs past the paddle sweep"
"a googly outside off, patted towards cover for one"
"full delivery outside off, driven to cover"
"is that Mumbai done? Mishra and Iyer embrace! Lovely bowling from Mishra, tossed that up well outside off. Hardik Pandya looks to go for the big slog down the ground but it was wider outside off so he isn't quite in control of that. The ball takes the leading edge and lobs to backward point. Mumbai on the brink of elimination."
"short and wide, carved to backward point"
"flat and straight, pushed out towards cover"
"flat outside off, chopped to point for a run"
"drifts down leg, was there some pad or thigh pad on that? The umpire calls it a wide"
"flat on off, defended into the off side."
"very full outside off, driven to cover. Mumbai going nowhere."
"the googly on leg, 88 kph. Markande doesn't read that and pats the ball back to the bowler"
"googly down leg, worked to deep midwicket for a couple. 3 for 36 for Lamichhane"
"full outside off, driven to long-off for a run"
"good length down leg, off the pad down towards leg gully."
"a slower ball outside off, a big swing and miss from Cutting."
"<strong>falls short of Harshal Patel!</strong> A slower ball down leg, flicked away in the air towards deep backward square leg. He runs to his right but can't quite get there"
"picks that and launched over long-on. A slower ball outside off, Cutting waits and waits before heaving that over midwicket"
"a low full toss down leg, worked down to short fine leg. He picks up and fires, but misses at the batsman's end. Out if he hit"
"gets it past short fine leg for four. Some claps in the Mumbai dugout. A slower ball down leg, flicked away past short fine leg. Well played."
"<strong>that's maaaaaassive</strong>! Wheeee. Big hit from Cutting. Now there is time to take it easy too. Full and straight, right in the slot for Cutting, who stays upright and then lofts the ball over long-on. Lovely hit"
"hang on to your hats! This ain't done just yet. Full and straight, an offcutter, he picks it and drills the ball over his partner's head. Fierce power over Markande, through long-on"
"the change in length works. A short offcutter outside off, beats Cutting's pull."
"a nice low full toss outside off, driven to long-on for a run"
"good length outside off, an open-faced dab to third man. <b>Cutting refuses the single</b>."
"excellently bowled. A wide yorker outside off, jammed to long-off."
"not easy for a No. 9. A good length delivery on middle, goes over the stump after Markande misses a dab."
"Shaw misses the stumps at the batsman's end, with Cutting not even in the picture. A full delivery is driven to short cover. Shaw takes aim and throws the ball wide. Boult cannot believe it. Cutting back on strike. Pant made the attempt to come front and gather, but fell over while collecting. He needs some time to gather himself."
a full toss outside off is badly hit to deep cover for a couple. Cutting wanted to hit that over long-off but the ball skewed away.
"well bowled. A wide yorker ends up as a low and wide full toss, sliced to deep backward point for one."
"he misses a full toss. A full toss on off that is very quick, Markande misses it and the ball knocks off stump"
a short delivery down leg and Cutting smashes that for SIX. That's the worst ball you can bowl. Short and slow down leg and Cutting just helps it along over short fine leg for six. WOW. Mumbai still in this.
"and taken! That was a very brave delivery from Harshal and he gets away with it. A short and slow wide delivery outside off. Cutting had walked across, looking to drag the swat over midwicket but because he has to reach out for it so much, he's not in control of the stroke. He picks out deep midwicket. No relay catch this time. A terrific cameo from Cutting though."
"it's all over! <b>Mumbai are eliminated from IPL 2018</b>. A slower ball outside off from Harshal and Bumrah just chips a catch to long-on. Boult takes the catch. Glum, glum faces in the Mumbai dugout as their campaign ends in the final hurdle before the playoffs."
