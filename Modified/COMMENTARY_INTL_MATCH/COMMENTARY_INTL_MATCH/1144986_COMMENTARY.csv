"<strong>edged and caught behind!</strong> This was almost a half-volley, across the left-hander, Head's feet were stuck in cement on the crease as threw the hands at a drive and got a thin edge through to de Kock and he gleefully accepts the simple catch. Great start for the great Dale Steyn."
"142kph, back of a length across the left hander and he leaves awkwardly as it flees to the keeper"
"<strong>edged and what a catch by du Plessis at second slip!</strong> Another full ball across the left hander, he launches into a drive, again not a big forward stride, thick edge, flies high to the skipper's left and he jumps and takes a superb catch flying up with two hands above his left shoulder!

"<b>another one goes!</B> Appeal for caught behind, given not out and South Africa <b>review</b> straightaway. It sounded like a bottom edge. A delivery with some width, Lynn went after it, and there's a clear noise as the ball passes the bat. There's also a spike on Snicko. Lynn is almost off the field...he's basically walked! Umpire says there's conclusive evidence of an edge. Good, low catch by de Kock. He's gone!"

"<B>caught at mid-on!</b> It goes from bad to worse for Australia, although Maxwell is standing his ground to see if it's carried. He came forward into a drive, a bit early on it, couldn't keep the ball down. It's dripping on the way Klaasen. Soft signal was out, and third umpire says he's happy the fingers are under the ball"
slips this down the leg side and it's called wide
"<B>been given caught behind, a wonderful diving catch from de Kock</b> but Stoinis has <B>reviewed</b>. It's been given for the catch, rather than lbw the umpire says. That appears quite a long way from the inside edge as it nips back off the seam, and is outside the line for lbw. So he'll survive. Not a great on-field decision there.
