"line of beauty, but Bancroft doesn't get near enough for an outside edge"
"inswinger from Broad, raps the pads... Dar not interested again, but England do <b>review</b> this one; looked a tad high and leg side, to me. Warner was up on his toes as the ball struck him on the knee roll...

"fires a length ball down the leg side, Warner swipes at it and misses"

"shaping away from the left-hander, and ignored"
shoulders arms once more as Woakes ploughs a fourth-line furrow
cat-and-mouse stuff as Head watches another sail by
"tempted by this one, a wider line on a very full length, and a scuffed toe-ended slap to mid-off to get him off the mark in Ashes cricket"
flicked with aplomb off the pads as Woakes strays too tight this time. Moeen skitters round to cut off the boundary with a slide
"loose from Woakes, hopping onto a leg-stump line, and that's meat and drink for Smith who himself hops inside the line to help it so fine through fine leg"
"through to the keeper, back of a length"

"whipped from a full length on off stump, collected on one knee at short midwicket"
"back of a length,<strong> firmly punched through the covers </strong> and suddenly the runs are starting to flow! England are losing a bit of discipline here. Lots of movement through the air but no consistency in line or length"

good areas outside off
pressed to mid-off
"advancing to the pitch, can't get the stroke away"
"too short, Head rocks back with glee, and slashes hard through point. Just a touch of turn but it was academic on that length"

"tossed into the toes, clipped hard to mid-on as Head uses his feet once more to take the attack back to the bowler"
"fired down the leg side, Stokes' radar remains on the blink"
"better line from Stokes, but Smith's angles are so acute, deflecting from middle and off, using the angle into the stumps to work the ball fine through backward square. Broad intercepts with a tumble"

"still three slips for Stokes, as Head clips this one firmly to midwicket"

"length ball on the pads, clipped behind square for one"
"straightening on the stumps, Head trapped in front - given! But after a chat with his partner, Head <b>reviews</b>. Was it high? That's about the only thing that could save him...

"Smith pads up to a nip-backer, <b>and Dar's finger goes up!</b> Smith looks aghast and <b>reviews</b> and it quickly becomes apparent that this was a bad decision, the ball missing the stumps by an inch or so.

"round the wicket, pitched up at 85mph as Pattinson steps across and leaves"
"booming inswinger, obliterating the front pad! <b>Dar gives it straight away</b>, although it may well have been doing too much again...

"wide of off stump, that would have been a one-day wide, but not in Tests. And quite right too. Smith can't reach it"
"back and across, solidly into line and dabs the requisite single to square leg. Strolls down to the far end, and Lyon will have one ball to see off. Wonder if it'll be the inswinger?"

"zips past the edge, and <B>off come the bails!</B> Bairstow looks animated as the umpires go upstairs... not sure why, as the back foot barely flinched! Perhaps he was chuffed with the glovework... it was very sharp. In fact, he was merely picking up the helmet to take it to the other end"

"back of a length, Lyon does well to stay firmly behind the line in defence"
through to the keeper and no stroke offered. Doughty from Gaz
"right behind the line once again, Lyon is a better quality of No.11 than usual. Almost Jack Leach standards, you might say"

"tapped into the off side, the single was on there, but there's too many balls left in the over to risk it..."

"<strong>there it is!</strong> A stunning, emphatic drive through the covers ... whistling to the rope, off comes the helmet, out comes a chorus of boos, overpowered by a rightful round of applause. It's Test hundred No.24, and you'll have to presume, his sweetest yet. A lot of emotion comes out, as he puffs out his cheeks to compose himself"

"smashed to deep midwicket, another scything followthrough, but no run yet"
"heave ho, out to deep midwicket, he had something more emphatic in mind, but the single will do this time..."
"fired across the left-hander, no stroke offered. A fine leave in the circumstances. He's bought Australia another over, because, let's face it, Smith is not going to be shifted..."
"chopped violently down to third man, on the bounce, as Smith took on the back-of-a-length delivery with a wild swipe"
"<strong>big appeal from Broad!</strong> Swinging down the leg side, and though Wilson says no, England <B>review!</B> My instinct is that this is optimistic, though there is no bat, which helps... but <B>missing by a distance</B>. A waste, and that's England's reviews blown"
"<B>wow, that was a glorious fluke!</B> Smith utterly flummoxed by one that straightened on a good length, a fat inside-edge skims over middle stump and away to the rope"
"<B>pounded with glee, straight back over Broad's head!</B> A beautiful straight blade, presented to the bowler like a silver platter."
tapped into the off side
"<B>hesitation outside off!</B> Smith wants the single to backward point, then doesn't, then does... Root swoops to make his mind up for him. But that does mean Lyon on strike ... as Woakes returns to the attack"
"outside off, good line and length, no stroke this time"
"flicks into the thigh pad, and <strong>Lyon escapes the strike!</strong>"
"back of a length, and a <B>scudding pull skims over Root's head at mid-on!</B>"
"<B>a smashed pull through deep midwicket!</B> Just picking up the length, and pounding it over cow corner!"
"outside off, swinging away, toe-ended drive into the covers"
"on the pads, whipped with intent ... but straight to the man at backward square. He'll accept the single"
"<B>pongoed into the crowd at square leg!</B> Moeen doesn't move as he loses sight of it, a filthy hack off the legs, pure hand-eye coordination, one bounce"
leaning back for a smack to the off side
"opens the face on the back foot, dabbed down to third man"
"outside off, too wide to lay bat on that one"
"tapped to point, tighter line,  but very solid in defence"
"<B>in the air, but Broad can't reach it!</B> Launches himself in the followthrough, but it's just too wide of him, to his left. And rattles through the vacant long off"
"compact punch into the off side, chasing the wide line, but finding the middle of the bat, inevitably. He's seeing it like Jupiter now"
"rolls the fingers, a slower ball outside off, pressed into the covers"
"inswinger, Smith gives himself room with a stride to leg and drives into the off side"
"banged in short, through to the keeper as Smith ducks"
"a curling outswinger on a very full length, guided into the covers with clarity and poise"

"retreating to the leg side once again, can't get this one away"
resolute in defence once more

"slower ball, and <B>Smith is almost castled!</B> A massive wind-up, but the ball hops obediently over the middle stump, like a Shetland Pony at a horse show"
"angled down to third man, that was an easy two, but Smith slipped when turning ... another opening for England"
"tight to off stump, back of a length, solid on the back foot"
<strong>pounded through long-off!</strong> There are the benefits of getting right behind the line. Every now and again you'll be in the perfect position for a Kodak-moment drive!
"back of a length, curling away from the stumps as Lyon curtain-rails inside the line"
"slower ball, very full. Poked to point"
"<strong>swung lustily over cow corner!</strong> That is contemptuous! And I wonder if it might provoke Broad to call for the new nut ... nope, not yet ..."
"fuller length, wide outside off, Broad goes for the one-day wide yorker. Smith can't lay bat on it"
"decent yorker, comes out as a full toss, but swings in late towards the toes as Smith presses down the ground"
"<B>bowled him!</B> Broad has his five-for, richly deserved, but it's all about Smith... he was aiming for quick runs, trusting his eye, but this time, the late tail into the toes was too good for the honk across the line. Smith was sprinting off the pitch as soon as his timbers were rattled. He wants to get England out there pronto!"
"round the wicket, full and straight, a solid, reassuring face of the bat on ball, and a huge cheer from a still-Partisan crowd"
"tucked with gratitude off the legs through midwicket! That's his area, and he places the ball calmly into no-man's land at deep midwicket to open his account"
"cautiously forward, a raucous cheer as Roy also finds the middle of the bat on a full length"
"flicks to the on-side, Cummins erring on the side of full, as England's own seamers did so effectively with the new ball"
"back of a length, and Roy's one-day instincts kick in as he muscles into a short-arm pull, misses, and gets a glare from Cummins for his troubles"
zeroing in on the top of off ... an exaggerated defensive push back down the line of the ball
"outside off, a healthy sighter as Pattinson fires it out wide"
"over the wicket, into the pads, tucked behind square with a late defensive glance, and he jogs the single"
"drawn into the drive, and<strong> effectively so!</strong> If it's in Roy's slot he'll go for it, regardless of circumstance. No risk in the stroke, just confident footwork and an open face"
"short and nips back off the seam, into the mid-riff as Roy doubles up"
"deep in the crease once more, seeing off another off-stump lifter with a defensive prod"
"full length, an inside-edged drive to backward square leg, and <B>England have made it to the close</B>"

"length on off, Roy pushes forward and gets a thickish edge into the leg side"

"rising up onto the toes, waiting for the ball to arrive on the back foot and dead-batting a single into the covers"
"<B>edged and safe!</B> Burns has been getting lucky in that area of late! Another full-length outswinger, luring the drive, which then skews on impact as the ball zips low through third slip ..."
"<B>that's vastly superior!</B> Similar delivery, but this time Burns' front foot is proactive, marching to the pitch of the outswinger and drilling the hands through the line. A long and futile chase as the fielder tumbles into the rope to huge cheers"

"very full, a fraction of movement away from the left-hander, as Burns works to leg with a closed face"

"fuller length, out comes an exploratory drive, like a hungry cat pawing at your head as you walk past the stairs. No great conviction, as cover gathers"
"angled bat, through the cordon, <B>no cutting that off!</B> That's the shot that went missing in the World Cup final, the head over the ball, soft hands, using the pace to snaffle the undefendable runs. He's onto 49..."
"half a cheer around Edgbaston as Root scuttles for the single, but that's thumped the inside of his knee, not the bat. A bit of a hobble to complete the leg bye"
on the back foot and blocking into the off side
"hopping into the hip, a stabbed deflection down through fine leg, and a punch of the gloves signifies a<B> vital captain's fifty!</B> Crucial agenda-setting knock from his new home"

poked out to gully with characteristically soft hands
"pressed into the off side, and <B>Burns was a goner if Khawaja's limp shy had hit!</B> It was so low-key I'm not sure he really noticed the opportunity. Instead, there was no-one backing up, and they take the overthrow!"

"over the wicket now, spearing in the yorker, but with no lateral movement, Root is equal to it with a stab of the bat"
"back of a length, pressed to backward point"
"right up to the toes, flicked around the corner but straight to square leg"
"<B>a wonderful one-handed snaffle!</B> That's outstanding from Siddle, in his followthrough, stretching out his right mitt and scrumping it from the tree. Root was too early on a full-length drive, popping a fast flat chance straight back down the pitch, and that's the opening that Australia so desperately needed!"
"round the wicket, straightening off the deck and into a firm front-foot block"
"back of a length, sliding on, defended on the back foot"
"lots more air, dipping on the crease-line, Burns smothers with a stretch forward"
"<B>beauty!</B> Flight and bite, as Burns is beaten by a sharp turner outside off"
blocked to mid-on with a watchful straight bat
"back of a length, too short, too wide, <B>pounded through the covers!</B> Very Alastair Cook, that. When there's width, it must go"
"loose delivery, a freebie on the pads, but Denly's firm clip is snaffled by a diving square leg"
"propping onto the front foot, high elbow in defence"
"turns off the toes, that was the one he was looking for earlier in the over. Not as well timed this time, but placed to the side of square leg, and they jog back for the second"

"short and wide, and swinging away. Denly leaves alone"
"drawn forward on the front foot, defended back to the bowler"

"on the back foot, inside-edged into the torso and away to the cordon"
"leaning forward, head tucked in behind a full face of the blade"
defended to the off side

"back of a length, prodded away on the back foot"
"fired in over the stumps, Denly shows it a straight bat in defence"

"that's not a wide! Much better length, curling past the off bail from just back of a length"

"thrashed off the back foot, into the covers. Not quite finding his timing today..."
"<B>finds the edge with the quicker ball!</B> That was superb from Lyon, round the wicket, such a tight line to the left-hander, on a full length, and speedy rip off the deck, straightening into Burns' defensive poke, for Paine to do the rest.

"big turn, <strong>wriggles through to slip!</strong> But it's come off the thigh, reckons Joel Wilson, and the Aussies reluctantly agree"
"clipped off the legs but <B>that's brilliant from Bancroft</B>, tracking the shot as Woakes advanced, and gathering it off the face before shying at the stumps. A direct hit would have been out!"

"back of a length, round the wicket, patted to point with a hop onto the toes"
"waiting for the ball on the back foot, a well-timed defensive punch into the gap in the covers. Lots of time there for Broad to get into line, which is a comment on the pace of the pitch and the bowler"

"line and length, outside off, solid in defence"
"<B>huge nipbacker!</B> Batters the knee-roll, but that looked high, and England decline the review. Indeed it was, straight over middle"

It's gone to a <B>review</B> and the crowd like what they've seen already!

"lining up the drive, but pressing the full length into the covers"
"<B>appeal from Stokes!</B> A rare occasion when Smith is struck in line, but was it going over the top, or rather was it dipping? Stokes thinks it might, at a pinch, but England decline the review"

angled bat on a defensive poke to point
"<B>pinged on the lid!</B> A sharp bouncer from Stokes, but Smith just misjudged his pull ... a mid-80mph bell-ringer, right on the side of the head... he gives his head an exaggerated shake, as if to admit he's worn one... out comes the doc for the concussion check, but he seems fine"

"outside off, tempting Head into an indiscretion. Left alone"

tossed up and defended coming into line
"full and driven, out to the cover sweeper for one"
"<b>straight over the head!</b> Is that England's plan now...? Smith was out of his ground, swatting at it tennis-style, but Bairstow fumbled it. No-ball for being over head height, of course"
worked around the corner for one
"flighted, this grips a touch, finds the outside edge but runs low and wide of slip for one more"
"arrowing in straight, 84mph and <b>thumped on the pads</b>, Joel Wilson shakes his head! Looked a touch leg side, England maybe realise that and won't ask for a review. Just clipping leg, umpire's call, according to Hawk-Eye"
"pitched up and swinging in, <b>smack into the front pad again...</b> No! Booming in-ducker, but it was doing too much, another good call from umpire Wilson. Impact was outside leg, in fact"

"quicker outside off, Smith shows it a straight bat"
"floated up, spinning in as Smith hangs back and nudges away behind square"

"very full, too full... and Root is into it quickly with a solid drive through the vacant long-off. Uppish for a while, but never in danger"
"rising outside off, no stroke offered as the ball shapes away to the cordon"
"full-faced block, straight back down the line"
"<B>clonked through the covers!</B> Runs just starting to flow now as Roy holds his shape to a full length on off, and lets his high elbow do the talking."

"pushed onto the back foot, good aggression again, but no way through there"
"ploughing a furrow on off stump, head over the ball and defended back down the track"
"fires in the bouncer, through to the keeper"
"<B>oof, so close to plopping onto his stumps!</B> Scenes reminiscent of Gooch at Old Trafford in 1993 ... the ball bounces straight up in the air from a back-foot block, and unlike Gooch, who waved his glove at the ball, Root flaps his bat as if chasing a wasp, as the ball lands safe behind the timbers!"
"worked into the covers, off the front foot"
"<strong>elegance from Roy!</strong> He's doing much as he did in the Edgbaston semi-final ... seeing off the tricky early overs, and now flowing into his repertoire. Good signs for England, in the long term at least"
"fenced off the hip, inside edge onto the thigh pad... and <B>his elbow deflects the ball with short leg lurking...</B>"
"outside off, shaping back in towards the stumps, no stroke offered"
no stroke offered on a leg-stump line
"dangled outside off, beaten as Root plays the initial line and is lucky not to nick it"
"<B>another massive appeal, up goes the finger again!</B> My word, Root has <B>reviewed</B> with a grin on his face... and there's a <B>thumping great inside edge!</B> Wilson is having an absolute shocker"
"through to the keeper, wide of off stump"
"shaping in on off stump, poked into the covers off the front foot. Crikey, it's never dull out there!"
immediate turn as Root tucks off the back foot to the leg side
"intent from Root, using his feet from the outset, driving with the spin to mid-on"
"up on the toes, punched into the covers as Lyon drops a touch too short"
"extra bounce on a leg-stump line, fenced down in front of short leg"
"<B>big appeal!</B> Aleem reckons Root's playing a shot, but it was a very pad-before-bat shot! Lyon wants to review but it's pointless in the circumstances... big spin though!"
"very full, biting the deck, squirting into the off side as Root falls over in his stance. It is all happening! I need a <B>drink!</B>"
"pitched up and Roy drive, off the lower part of the bat and through Root's legs, mid-on comes across"
"in the channel, gun-barrel straight and Roy lets it go"
"legcutter, finds the edge, <b>but Paine is wrong-footed!</b> He had started to go to the leg side, then had to fling himself back to his right as the ball veered away with Roy squared up, but couldn't lay a glove on it!"
comes forward and shows this the full face of the bat
stifled appeal for lbw as Siddle burrows one through the defences... touch high?
"yeesh, <b>beats the bat again</b>, another tantalising corridor-botherer and Roy can't line it up"
"tossed up outside off, Root goes for the proactive move and sweeps, hit on the pad... definitely outside the line playing a shot this time"
floated up and whipped away with the spin through square leg for one

comes across and lets this one go
"length in the channel, Root pats it down into the covers"
"steered through gully, Root angles it down and away for four... Probing line from Siddle, 86mph but the ball didn't get up much and he played it softly"
gets a touch too straight and Root glances off his pads for one
tossed up and swept down to deep backward square for one
"oh my word... <b>Bowled on the charge!</b> Lyon has his first and Roy is sent packing after making a complete misjudgment of which ball to attack! Maybe the ODI mindset was the problem... Gallumphed down and aimed a mighty heave over the leg side but he was nowhere near the pitch, left a massive gap for the ball to turn through; and then turned on his heel abruptly to leave the field, as if realising his mistake"
"flighted, spinning down the leg side, Paine goes up for caught behind... Did it flick the pad? Aleem Dar not interested"
"oof, defended with bat next to pad, but it <b>nearly rolls back into his stumps!</b> Shouts of anguish around the bat, as the ball squeezes through"
"tossed up and slapped over the leg side, confidently slog-swept for Denly's first runs"
"does it again! <b>Cleanly swiped to the fence...</b> Back-to-back boundaries, though Australia won't mind too much, given everything going on in that over"

shortish and dabbed down towards backward point from the crease
"lobbed up, Denly waits for it and plays with the spin past short leg"

tossed up and he nails a sweep into the shin pads of the close fielder
"<b>stays low as Denly goes back</b>, manages to prod it away at the last moment!"
"round the wicket, pitching outside leg and spinning further as Root pads up, Paine can't get to it either and four more goes on to the total"
"length, slanted in towards the pads, Denly is a little off balance as he jabs to short midwicket"
"pitched up on middle and off, met with a stout block this time"
"85mph length ball, left alone outside off"
pitched up a tad fuller on off as Denly gets across to defend
"ooh, <b>snorting ball</b>, beaten pushing forwards! That jacknifed away at a fair lick with Denly reaching for it in vain"
gets across on off stump and blocks this one
"shouts of 'catch!' as Root sweeps, in the air but safely through backward square for one"
"round the wicket, looped up and worked with the spin for a single"

"flighted, around the line of off as Denly presses out, defended"
"spinning, loops up of the front pad, <b>taken at short leg!</b> Aleem Dar gives it but Denly decides to <b>review</b> after consultation with his partner. He seemed to be saying he didn't feel any contact, <b>but UltraEdge offers a different view!</b> Clear ripple on the snickometer as the ball passed the inside shoulder of the bat. Lyon sinks his teeth into England again!"
"nicely bowled, wide of off stump and spinning back... not enough to make him play as the ball skips through to Paine"

"good length around the line of off, jabbed into the covers"
"slanted in, attacking the timbers, Root defends square"
"full at 87mph/139kph, almost yorker length, but Root makes no mistake in flicking a couple in front of deep midwicket"
"angled across from round the wicket, Buttler sticks out his front pad"
gets across and pats this one down
"tossed up, drifting across outside the line of off and spinning through, left alone"
"props forward with bat next to pad, defended"
"touch shorter, Buttler goes back and plays across the line, a thick leading edge loops safely towards silly point (who's not in)"
lobbed up and tucked away to leg off the back foot
"short of a length, Root rides it and taps behind square on the leg side"
"banged in, 85mph/137kph bouncer over the stumps, Buttler is well down"
"coming back a fraction, line was wide of off and Buttler leaves confidently"
"line and length in the channel, again he shoulders arms"
"thumped on the front pad, Australia scream out an appeal.... Joel Wilson is unmoved this time, but Paine signals for a <b>review</b>. DRS to the rescue again? No, it's umpire's call! You called it, Joel! Looked a touch high to me, Hawk-Eye had it flicking the leg bail. Buttler abides"
"hits a length, coming across and defended"
"jammed off the inside edge, <b>snagged by Bancroft under the helmet!</b> No need to review those! Root punches his bat in anguish, as Australia's players engage in a victory waltz behind him! What a huge wicket that is... Ball turning in as Root pushed in front of his pad, squirted off the bat, right into the waiting paws!"

"back of a length outside off, left alone"
touch short and spinning away as Stokes goes back and swipes at it
"lobbed up close to off stump, blocked on the front foot"

"flighted, spinning hard outside the line of off, Paine grabs it in his fingertips this time"
"floated up fuller, left alone as it straightens through to the keeper"
"yelps of excitement as Stokes prods defensively and deflects it on to his boot... but the ball falls safely, and that will be <b>lunch</b>"
"beauty to launch the session! Perfect line and length, doesn't matter if the pitch is sluggish if you are attacking the outside edge like that"
"shuffling into line deep in the crease, defended with an angled bat to cover"
"probing again from Cummins, 85mph on an off-stump line, fully forward"
"leaning out of the crease, almost falling over in his eagerness to dig out the full ball"
"wider line, through to the keeper"
"<B>bowled him!</B> Oh wow, <I>that's</I> the line, but this time just a fraction shorter, Buttler caught in no-man's land when he should have been on the front foot again, and the off stump has been splattered! A huge, huge blow straight after lunch... who's going to hang around now?"

"straighter line from round the wicket, Stokes is equal to it on the back foot"

"edged down low through the cordon, very soft hands on the back foot as Cummins probes that off stump again"
sliding back and across in defence once more
"outside off, Stokes keeps his bat inside the line as the ball angles in towards the stumps"
"fuller, straighter, coming in on the angle again and defended in front of off"
"lifting through to the keeper outside off stump, a more comfortable leave to finish the over"
"on the back foot, whipped off the legs, through the phalanx of close catchers for the single"
"round the wicket, looped into the pads, resolute block with a full face"
"head over the ball, pressed back down the wicket"
"right back in the crease this time, jabbing the overspin down into the pitch"

"a fraction too full from Cummins, shaping into Bairstow's pads, and he doesn't miss those, no matter what form he's in, clipped firmly through wide long-on"

"<B>edged, gone, England are a rabble!</B> Sizzling spin and bounce, dipping on off stump, biting the pitch, snicking the edge, a gleeful grab from Paine, and one ball after Cummins reached his 100th Test wicket, Lyon trumps him with his 350th!"
"a flashy drive through the covers... well, why not? It was a rare loose one, tossed out wide, and clobbered to the fence"
"two close catchers, either side of the wicket, as Woakes flicks uppishly towards wide mid-on, where Pattinson sprawls to intercept, and keep Moeen, Lyon's bunny, on strike..."
"firm-handed block, an ironic cheer goes up as the crowd misses none of the significance of this match-up"
"left alone outside off, dip into the pitch, and spinning away. That one went straight on in the first innings..."
"keeps low as it turns, and Moeen shoulders arms again"
<B>slashed wildly outside off!</B> Fizzes through the gap in the cordon... Woakes has no cares left to give
flicked off the pads as Cummins gets brisk on a tight leg-stump line. The runs are coming in a torrent!
"probing the stumps, back of a length, skidding low on the fifth-day deck, and Woakes has to be watchful as he plays off the back foot"
"another swishy-wristed drive into the covers, and more cheers for Woakes' intent. What was that required run-rate again?"

"bat in front of pad, squeezing a defensive push back up the pitch"
"twirled onto a middle-and-leg line, solid on the front foot"
"skidding on the back foot, getting close to the pads, but fended away, just about"
"<B>sharp again from Pattinson!</B> The uneven bounce forces Woakes to play at one that might have sailed over his head in the first innings, fencing down from his ribs with some discomfort, at 87mph"
"standing tall on the back foot, more confident in defence"
"<B>short and slammed through the leg side!</B> Woakes isn't going to die wondering, an expertly timed swivel-pull, all the way to the rope"

"firmly punched back down the track, through Siddle's stooping grasp"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
"nips the knee-roll from round the wicket, a long pause from Joel Wilson... and a shake of the head... looks high, but Australia <B>review</B>. No bat involved, and yep, Wilson is vindicated again. He's finishing strongly! Over the top of middle"
"<B>huge appeal again!</B> This looked closer, but might have been an inside-edge involved... not out either way. And missing too"

"tight leave, but it's a good leave... coming back in towards the off pole, Moeen shoulders arms"

"length ball in the channel, left alone"
"spin, bounce, shouts of 'catch!' Ball ends up on the turf... Went over the stumps, I think, with Woakes beaten; actually flicked the pad, but probably high"
pushed away into off side for one
"gottim, <b>Lyon gobbles up mo mo Mo!</b> Ninth time in Tests, so bunny it's not funny. Lyon bags his fifth and Australia are just a quick two-step away. Big spin from middle and leg, thick-edged propping forwards and snaffled at gully"
"gone, <b>first-baller for Broad!</b> Six for Garry! Flighted, turning on the stumps, Broad lunges at it and a fat edge plops into the hands of slip"

"length ball on the stumps, 84mph/136kph and bunted away"
"<b>dropped!</b> Woakes flashes at one, deflected low towards second slip, <b>but Smith can't cling on!</b> No luck for Siddle, but some schadenfreude for the crowd to enjoy"

worked into the leg side for a single
"flighed, draws him forwards, <b>edged between slip and gully!</b> Didn't carry, but it will roll away for four, prompting the Edgbaston crowd to serenade Jimmy Anderson once more"
"short ball, doesn't get up and Woakes pulls down to fine leg, not taking the run"
"dug in again, swatted away to the leg side"
"short but with pace off, <b>and Woakes can only steer it limply to slip!</b> Done by the slower bouncer, contorting into all sorts of positions but in the end popping a simple catch up off the splice... All of which means, <b>Australia win by 251 runs</b>, exorcising their Birmingham hoodoo in style!"
