"<strong>big swing first up</strong>, but the line is wrong. Starts from middle and moves a long way away, left alone. Hardly any carry to Saha"
"full but bowls this too far wide outside off, left alone again"
"length ball that nips away from the fifth stump, well left again"
"much better! Angled in much fuller, just a touch outside off, there's some swing in the air and Shadman lets it go"
"around the fifth-stump again, some swing away and Shadman doesn't have to play it again"
"good leave, but he looked to play that one. So we're yet to see ball hitting bat or the other way around"
"<strong>starts with a corker!</strong> Full, swinging back in from middle to beat the inside edge and buzz over the middle stump. Phew, what a ball"
"short of length delivery on middle, climbs into Imrul, who defends it into the leg side. Was hit high on the bat"
swinging in to hit him high on the pad as he looks to tuck this into the leg side. Good start from Umesh already
"shortish delivery down the leg side, good carry and pace to Saha"
"<strong>just wide of short leg! </strong> Imrul is surprised by the bounce, takes his bottom hand off as he fends at this, off the glove but <strong>Agarwal was a tad deep.</strong>"
beaten as he shapes to play an expansive drive! Went chasing after a full and wide delivery when he could've well left it alone
"edged, but <strong>doesn't carry</strong> to Jadeja at gully"
"driven firmly but straight to cover. This was right in the slot, he played it nicely"
"good delivery! Angles in and gets it to move away from outside off, left alone"
<strong>peach!</strong> Drew him forward and got this to beat the outside edge as he pushed forward
"has he nicked that? Not quite! <strong>Jeez, that was a beauty again!</strong> Squared Shadman up with the length. Got it to leave him late as he was opened up completely"
"play and a miss. Went for an expansive drive, just a split second late on the delivery. This was right in the slot and<em> Sehwag would've said 'that's a boundary missed'</em>"
"struck on the back thigh as Umesh gets this to bend back in off a length on middle, deflects to the slip cordon."
"off a thick inside edge to fine leg. Imrul isn't sure yet how much the ball is swinging, and plays a tad outside the line. <strong>First runs for Bangladesh</strong>"
"was shaping to cut seeing this length on the shorter side, but to his surprise, this one <strong>jags back in a long, long way</strong> to shave past the off stump as Shadman leaves"

"this one's squirted through gully and point for four! This was full and swinging away, Shadman threw his bat at that and gets away with it this time"
"defended into the covers off the backfoot, but they get through for a single. Nicely done by Shadman"
beats him with a superb outswinger. Imrul plays back to a delivery he should've well been forward

beats the edge with one that <strong>holds its line</strong>
gets right on top of the bounce and bunts it wide of short leg

"full, wide and crashed through backward point. All he had to do was lend direction to this, middled properly"
"good leave, full of conviction. Umesh slanted this full and across"
"edged and taken! Jabs at this length ball with hard hands and it flies to third slip where the vice-captain takes a good catch. The polite word from the umpire made Umesh bowl this from wide of the crease, so he was able to create that natural angle across, Imrul pushed at it and has all the time in the world now to sit and analyse where he went wrong."
"nice and full on the stumps from around the wicket, defended solidly"

lifter that is well averted by Shadman as he tries to get on top of the bounce and defend
"again in some discomfort as he hops back to defend, squirted back"
"nice and full outside off from around the stumps, safely defended"
"nicked and gone! Sucked into the drive but there's no feet and so it ends up being a tentative poke, enough to get the edge as the ball swings away and Saha takes this right in front of his face. The bottom hand came off the grip as well as he went for it. Bangladesh in early trouble"
"slants this across, left alone"
defended gently into the leg side as he gets onto the backfoot
"skiddy length delivery angled across, excellent leave from the skipper"
"goes from wide of the crease and angles it across, left alone once again"

"angles one in full outside off, left alone. Buzzes through to the keeper"
"good delivery, this one nips back in from outside off, excellent leave from Mithun"
"too short, far too wide outside off for the batsman to have any trouble with that, left alone"
comes back in a long way but the length is too short and is going over the stumps as Mithun shoulders arms
"there for the drive as he bowls this full outside off, Mithun leaves. The ball moves back in a long way after it passes the batsman"
driven firmly but straight to mid-off this time. The ball was too full and Ishant is lucky to get away with that
"big swing back in, Mithun gets some pad on the way as this deflects to fine leg"
"this one moves away from outside off, left alone"

there for the drive but the skipper is happy to let it go
"excellent stop by Rahane at gully, throwing himself full stretch to pull off a one-handed stop to save four runs"
"goes full and straight on the stumps, defended back"

"full on off, and he presses forward to defend. Edged along the ground to the slip cordon this time"
"full, on off, and he presses forward to defend with firm hands. Played back to the bowler"
"full on off and angling into his pads. Hurries onto the batsman and it hits him before going to square leg. Umesh thinks it hit pad first so he asks his captain to <B>review.</b> Virat obliges. Replays show that the ball hit the back pad's flap before it hit the bat, so we move to ball tracking. The batsman survives because the impact appears to be 'umpire's call', and since the umpire had given it not-out originally, it shall stay that way. Mithun survives despite the ball scheduled to crash into the stumps. Kohli pats the umpire Rod Tucker on his back before walking back to his position"

"nicely tossed up outside off, defended"
