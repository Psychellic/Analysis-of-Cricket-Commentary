"slower ball at 112.6kmh, he drives on the up and it's in the air, but wide of mid-off and right in the gap between cover and mid-off. Wade is taking off here"

"falls short of deep midwicket this time! Short and slow, he pulled it nice and sweet, but it fell short"

"outside off this time, he defends on the off side"
"<strong>thick edge flies away</strong> through the vacant slip region for four more! A bit full outside off, Wade throws his bat at it, gets only a thick outside edge to send it fine, third man puts in a dive to his right but can't get there"
"cramps him for room this time as Wade attempts a pull, settles for a single on leg"
"cramps Short for room as well as he tries to pull as well, and looks like Short has edged the ball right into his box. That's painful"

"short and coming in, pulled a bit late and he gets one"
"tries the yorker but it's a low full toss, mid-off in the circle, and Short merely chips it down the ground with great timing to send it flying over long-off for another clean six! And <strong>that's his fifty as well</strong>"

"much more powerful from Wade, he has really middled that short ball and dispatches it between deep midwicket and long-on. He's racing away to the 100"
"<strong>ramps it to short third man</strong>, that's the end of the opening stand! Slower short ball, took its time to reach Wade, who wanted to pull initially and then changed his mind to ramp it late, and found short third man. And that's <b>Abbott's 100th BBL wicket</b>"
"outside off, steered away from point for one and he's off the mark"

"charges down and scythes the short ball past a diving point fielder, gets two this time"
"pins him on the helmet, but thankfully it was a slower ball at 112.6kmh. Malan looked to pull the short ball initially but the ball kept chasing him as he took his eyes off the ball, and hit the back of his helmet"
angling into him and he pulls it gently to long leg for one
"not that much room but it's enough for Malan to free his arms and send that crashing in the gap, all along the ground through the covers for four"
steers that away wide of cover point for one
short ball and Short has slapped that back with such brute force that Abbott ducked under that and it's crashed into the long-on boundary
"nails the yorker and Abbott gets his second wicket of the night, he's removed both openers today and been the best Sixers bowler by a distance. It was a leg-stump yorker that Short tried putting away after making room but couldn't connect"
"nice and tight on the off stump, Jacks defends it back and Abbott dives to his left to stop it"
leading edge to cover but the fielder is at the edge of the circle and Jacks is off the mark. Looks like Jacks closed the face of the bat bit too early on the leg side and hence got the edge from the shoulder of the bat
tries the wide yorker outside off and it's been called a wide
"<strong>holes out to long-on</strong>! Around the wicket and well wide of the stumps on off, without any pace, and Jacks lofts it down the ground but doesn't get the distance. Christian runs in and slides at the end to get both hands to it comfortably"

nearly a yorker and it's clipped to leg a bit awkwardly for one
"<strong>another one falls</strong>, the collapse continues! Short ball, top edge and taken by the keeper. Ellis went after the short ball, got a leading edge which ballooned behind the stumps and landed in Philippe's gloves"
"<b>the Singapore Slinger has found long-off</b>. Full and straight, David was waiting with an open stance and smacked that flat and straight down the ground where Vince pouched it while tumbling forward"
"that's not a hat-trick ball, on the pads down leg and they settle for a leg bye"
"<strong>run-out appeal</strong> at the keeper's end as Philippe gets a direct hit with his gloves on. Winter didn't get any bat on the last ball outside off, they went for the bye but Philippe did well to collect that cleanly and then hit the stumps with an under-arm throw and Boland was well short"
slightly full outside off and pushed into the covers for one
"<strong>stifled appeal for lbw</strong> from the bowler for lbw, swinging it into Vince a little bit. It was going down leg"

"shorter than his previous deliveries, Vince makes room and cuts to find cover point"
comes down to attack and get a leading edge the flies over cover. Off the mark with two
starts with a wide down the leg side
"<strong>strikes him right in front</strong>, really big lbw appeal and the umpire doesn't move! Oh boy, that was really close. Nipped in sharply after pitching on length outside off, struck Philippe right in front of the stumps and my guess is the height would have bothered the umpire"
"clean as a whistle for a six down the ground! What a shot to follow that lbw appeal. Phillipe takes out the straight-bat loft down the ground with such a clean strike and nice follow through, beautiful to watch"
"errs towards the leg side, Philippe shuffles a bit towards off and tucks that fine on the leg side, fine enough to beat short fine leg for four. Not given leg byes so looks like it was off the bat"
taps the tighter delivery down to mid on for a quick single
"right on the stumps, Vince defends it on off for another quick one"
short ball that moves late towards the leg side and that works well for Philippe because he's hooked that really late to send that racing pretty fine on leg for another four
taps the ball towards point for one
"shuffles to off and adjusts late to defend the ball, nearly handing a return catch to Boland but it doesn't carry"
"shuffles across again and this time <strong>Philippe has been given lbw</strong>! Another close appeal, this time too Philippe has been trapped in front, more towards middle and leg compared to the first appeal, and this one just had the angle, no movement. He wanted to flick to leg but missed it completely and struck in front and given out. Oh gosh, ball-tracking says it would have missed the stumps!"
""

"nice and quick around 141kmh, he runs it down towards point for a quick single"

"on middle and leg, and it's worked towards midwicket for one"
"slightly short outside off, scythes it towards deep backward point for one"

"defends this one back and even this was in the air briefly, to the right of the bowler near the pitch"
goes on the back foot and defends towards cover for a quick single
"<strong>taken at mid-off this</strong> time, and the Sixers are crumbling! Only four off the over and Hughes goes after the last ball, but gets a leading edge that goes high and remains in the circle. David goes to his right a little bit and gets under it comfortably"

"googly turning in towards off, Silk goes back and punches it back"

"a lot more flight outside off, it's full as well and Silk has creamed that through the covers nicely with the spin for a useful boundary"
"back of length outside off, he stays back and defends it back"
"<strong>falls just short of long-on</strong>! Length ball towards stumps and Henriques neither went all the way for a big shot nor looked to chip it over the bowler, and nearly handed a coach to long on"
"another shout of 'caatch' as Silk looks to defend to leg but the ball takes the outer half of the bat and lobs towards short cover, and falls short again"
well outside off this time and he runs it down to short third man

"another sweep and he picks the gap this time. Good, hard swing of the bat and he sent that raving away to the left of deep backward square leg"
opens his stance and pulls it to leg for one
bit too full and lofted down the ground for two to end the over
"bit too full on the pads, Henriques stands tall and lofts that over the wide long-on boundary yet again, what a way to star the second half of the chase"
"<b>dropped</b>, and this one was a sitter but down by Short! Henriques pulled, didn't middle it, and it lobbed to the left of Short at midwicket where he just had to take a couple of steps to his left, and the ball went <b>right through his hands</b>"
