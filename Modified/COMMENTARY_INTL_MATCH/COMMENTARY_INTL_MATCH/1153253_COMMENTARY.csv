"<b>wide.</b> Another slower ball, this one is a bouncer. It's dug in too short and it rises over his head"

"<b>dropped at mid-off</b> and a fifty for Shahzad! Rayudu can't hold onto what he'll consider an easy catch. It was full on off stump, he was looking to go over mid-off but this came off the inside half of the bat. Hung up for Rayudu to his right and he couldn't hold it with the reverse cup"

"full just outside off, and pushed with the spin to cover point for a quick single"
"<b>extra bounce!</b> Back of a length outside off, but spinning into Jadeja. He uncomfortably muscles this to the leg side for a single"
"good length wide outside off, and that's been <b>punished</b> by Chahar! Rocks back and cuts this smartly past the vacant point-region for a boundary. First four in six overs"
"overpitched on leg stump, and fended off the front foot. <B>End of Mujeeb's spell (0 for 43)</b>"
"back of a length outside off, but too slow from Aftab. Jadeja sticks his bat out and taps this to point for a quick single"
"overpitched outside off stump, and he toe-ends a drive towards the keeper. They scamper across for a single before Shahzad can get to the ball"
"full on middle, and angling into his pads. Flicked straight to midwicket"
"full on off, and he pushes this with soft hands to mid off. Nice early call for a single"
"<b>cleans him up!</b> Full and straight, and Chahar misses the leg-side flick. Gap between bat and pad, and the delivery sneaks through his defense! Hits his front leg, and then crashes into the stumps."
"full on off, and defended onto his pads. The ball rolls away to cover as Aftab ends a successful over"
"good length outside off, and spinning further away. He sticks his bat out and taps this to point for a single. Asghar isn't happy that they conceded a run there"
"full on off, and carefully defended off the front foot"
"full on off, and Kuldeep keeps his eyes on the ball and caresses a square drive to the fielder in the deep for a single"
"good length outside off, and spinning away once again. Nudged square to Rahmat at point for another single"
"full on off, and Kuldeep carefully defends off the front foot. Afghanistan will take the dot"
"good length just outside off, and straightens after pitching. Hits the top of Kuldeep's bat and <b>pops into the air</b> but lands safe just beyond the fielder at cover. <B>India need 23 off 24</b>"
"full on middle, and he uses his wrists to whip this behind square to the fielder at fine leg. Early call for the second means that the batsmen are safe, but the throw from the deep hits Shahzad's gloves and <b>then ricochets onto Samiuallah's face!</b> He's going off."
"slower ball outside off. Lands on a length, and Kuldeep taps this with soft hands and races off for a single to the other side"
"full on leg stump, and worked away to midwicket for a single. <B>Hesitation of yes-no-yes-no</b> as Rashid collects and throws down the stumps at the keeper's end. Is Kuldeep in? Yes!"
"attempted yorker on middle, but eventually a low full toss. Caressed down the ground to long on for a single"
"good length on middle, but angling down leg. Easily flicked off his pads to fine leg for one"
"back of a length outside off stump, but the slower ball has been pulled to deep midwicket. <B>India need 17 off 18</b>"
"full on middle, and spinning wildly past the outside of his bat. Jadeja tried to defend but his bat was nowhere near the ball"
"too full on middle, and he closes the bat's face to work this towards deep midwicket for a single"
"<b>big appeal for lbw!</b> But would've missed the stumps. Length ball on middle, but turning into his pads. Impact on leg stump, so an easy decision for the umpire"
"full on leg stump, and swept hard! Beats the fielder at square leg, but there's a fielder manning the boundary"
"full on middle stump, and Jadeja's quick to get down and defend with soft hands"
"flighted on middle, and he drives this low full-toss past the midwicket fielder. Chase for Najibullah near the boundary, but he manages to cut it off. <B>India need 13 off 12</b>"
"full on leg stump, and Kuldeep backs away and drives through the covers. Great impact off the bat and they're coming back for the third. Could be dangerous as the throw is flat from the deep. The bowler collects the ball and <b>throws down the stumps at the bowler's end before Kuldeep can complete the third.</b> Importantly that's two runs, and the strike is with Jadeja, but Kuldeep must walk back"
"back of a length on off, and he paddles a sweep into the gap on the leg side. A couple for Jadeja as Kaul responds well to his partner's call"
"short outside off, and Jadeja goes for the pull! He slices the shot, and it's in the air... but the ball <b>falls short</b> of Rashid at short midwicket. Rashid then picks up the ball and has a shy at the bowler's stumps, but he misses the direct hit. Kaul would definitely have been out"
"yorker on middle stump, and Jadeja pushes this down the ground to wide long-on for a single. <B>Eight off eight</b>"
"full and straight on middle stump, and that's been driven to mid on for a quick single. Hashmatullah picks the ball up and releases it super fast, and his throw <b>gets the direct hit!</b> The umpire goes up to the third umpire.. .and <b>Kaul is short!</b> India are nine down."
"full on leg stump, and he flicks this to fine leg for a single. <B>India need seven runs, Afghanistan need one wicket</b>"
"half-tracker outside off, and spinning further away. Jadeja drags a slog towards the leg side, and the ball goes to deep midwicket. But <b>Jadeja refuses the single</b>"
"full on middle stump, and <b>Jadeja slog-sweeps</b> this into the boundary! Picks the legbreak well and smashes this towards the leg side. The ball hits the skirting right on the full and therefore the umpire needs to check. Will it be a four or a six? That's the million-dollar question. <b>Given as a four</b>"
"full on eg stump, and Jadeja flicks this to square leg for a single. Was that smart? Khaleel on strike. <B>Two to win, one to tie</b>"
"full outside off, and the googly has been inside-edged to short fine leg! Khaleel went for the drive, and he had no clue what Rashid had bowled. Chance of a direct-hit at the bowler's end too, but Khaleel survives. <B>Scores are tied</b>"
"back of a length outside off, and this spins into Jadeja. He mistimes a pull, and the ball goes straight in the air! <b>Taken at midwicket, and the game is tied!</b> The Indians are disappointed as Afghanistan celebrate. There's no Super Over folks. That's only <i>for the final.</i> Rashid takes a wicket off his worst delivery of the match, but Jadeja was cramped, and therefore paid the price. The Afghans celebrate as if they've won. The Indians are shell-shocked in the pavillion."
