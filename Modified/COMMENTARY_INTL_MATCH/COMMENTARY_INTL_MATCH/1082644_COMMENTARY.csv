"length ball that nips away off the seam from outside off, Tiwary looks to slap this through cover but is beaten"
"dabbed to the off side, looks for a single but is sent back. Hit high on the bat. Boult is getting them to skid through. <b> Lazy from Tiwary </b>, could have been run out had Boult, who hares across to stop the ball on the followthrough, flicked the underarm throw back to the stumps at the striker's end."
"full and swinging away from off stump, squeezed towards third man, off the mark finally"
"<b> huge appeal. Beautiful delivery. </b> Banana swing. Curves back in late to beat the inside edge. S Ravi isn't convinced. Very, very close. Replays show the ball would've hit the outside of leg stump."
"gets this to nip away off the seam from length outside off, Simmons is beaten comprehensively. Was expecting this to swing back in again, perhaps"
hops back into the crease to defend the away-going length ball back to the bowler

"steep bounce, fizz and plenty of pace. Rohit is beaten as the length ball whizzes past the outside edge. Robin Uthappa is airborne as the ball thuds into his gloves. 145kph"
"sensible, drops it gently wide of cover and gets off the mark"
crunched over the cover fielder on the bounce. Not a half-volley by any means but Tiwary used his reach to lean forward and hit it on the up
angles a short of length delivery down to third man to keep strike
"full and swinging away from off stump, driven hard to cover"
uses the pace to steer this length ball to third man
"the pace of Umesh has resulted in a boundary to fine leg. Slides this into the pads, Rohit beaten on the flick but the balls deflects off the pad to beat Uthappa's stop. Late to react."
"controls the flick superbly. Once again this is a full ball that veers into middle, Rohit's powerful wrist work to the fore as he beats midwicket. Hit it to the right of the man there"

"pushed through quicker on middle and leg, worked to midwicket"

"punched to mid-off, called for the single immediately, Rohit responded in a jiffy"
"smites this length ball over wide long-on. Almost as if he was waiting for it. Just a short-arm jab, sailed over the boundary. Clean"
"chipped uppsishly, but there's no one at short midwicket. Gambhir is there right at the edge of the circle"
crunching sound as ball met the half-volley but straight to extra cover

uses the depth of the crease to punch the length ball to point
"smeared into the gap at cover, down to the boundary rider"

"wrong'un, Rohit defends from the crease. He dropped it at length this time"
"beaten by the wrong'un, went through with the sweep but the ball spun away to deflect off his back thigh to the third man boundary. Unlucky"
"draws him forward and gets a thick edge as he defends the googly, down to short third man"
"spins back in to cramp him for room, tucked to midwicket"
"length ball at 118kph on middle and leg, Tiwary played early, ball deflects off the thigh pad to square leg"
"he's got the big fish. This is a cutter which Rohit looks to ease past short third man. May have been pad first before the ball deflected off the bat. Yes, excellent decision from S Ravi. The came back in a long way, the impact was on off stump. Would have hit top of middle."
beaten. Looks to slash this over point but the ball skidded through. Bounce as well. Uthappa collected it close to his chest

leading edge but wide of the cover fielder. The ball dipped on him and then spun away

"leg-cutter on the pads, eased to long-on"
"looked to muscle this short, skiddy ball over midwicket, nearly skewed it back to the bowler. Cramped for room. Intelligent bowling from Rajpoot"
makes room to punch a shortish delivery past cover
"backs away and slaps one to cover, a misfield by Gambhir allows the single"
"spun back in sharply to nearly sneak through to hit the stumps. Rayudu played outside the line, may have got a thin inside edge onto the pad. <b> Uthappa has technically dropped it </b>"
"Boult was in business at deep midwicket, but this was hit really hard. Flat, slog. He tried to stop it on the bounce, but the ball spun away from him. Superb from Rayudu"
works the shortish delivery to midwicket
"this one's a leg-cutter, Tiwary chops this to short third man. Played down the wrong line"

opens the bat face to steer this short of length delivery wide of point
"looks to pull over midwicket, no strength on the shot as he's cramped for room. Straight to Lynn"
"not Tiwary's cup of tea. Tries to walk across to scoop it over short fine, but Umesh saw that coming and slowed it down nicely. Beaten."
"looks to swipe one from outside off, but the bounce of the Eden surface prevents him from doing so. Bounced awkwardly from length"
swing away into the gap between deep midwicket and long-on. Muscling stroke. Brought out every bit of his strength
hit on the pad as he looks to play a powerful sweep. This was full and flat delivery coming in from wide of the crease
swept with the spin to deep backward square leg
"top shot. Picked the length early, rocked back and pulled it into the deep midwicket boundary"
"lofted straight over the bowler's head. One bounce into the ropes. <b> Fifty in his first game this season. </b> Painful at times, but credit to Tiwary for grabbing this opportunity. Not easy coming in from the cold after 13 games on the bench."
gets outside the line of the short ball and helps it to fine leg
"slapped, Umesh gets a hand on the followthrough, deflects to mid-off. He instinctively put his right hand out. <b> Could have so easily split his webbing or dislocated a thumb. </b> Hard hit"
"width and he's slashed that into the square third man boundary. Not where he wanted but third man was too fine, had no chance"
"imperious. Swipes Umesh off the frontfoot over deep midwicket. Some confidence and guts. Stunning. He may not be the most aesthetically pleasing batsman, but makes up for all that with his grit."
"looks to swing this over long-on but is beaten. Played too early, had to fetch the length ball from outside off"
"slower bouncer, Rayudu looks to pull but can only toe-end it towards short mid-on. Rayudu was halfway down the pitch when Tiwary took off. Umesh hared across, picked it up cleanly and had the presence of mind to run all the way up to the striker's end and dislodge the bails. Tiwary stood no chance in a dash against Umesh."
"width, Rayudu delicately dabs this past Rajpoot at short third man. Cute"
forced off the backfoot to sweeper cover
cuts back in sharply to thud into Pollard's front pad. Too high. Bowler didn't even bother appealing
steps out and nurdles this to midwicket. Kuldeep caught napping as he ran in from the boundary
works the full ball down to long-on
"close. Nearly dragged that back onto the stumps. Looked to fetch the slog sweep from outside off, the thick inside edge off the pad rolls to short third man"
"flayed into the gap at extra cover. Wide long-off tried to dash across but stood no chance. Super timing, even better placement. Hitting on the up without a trace of worry. Most batsmen would have looked to cut"
"wow. What improvisation. He's showing why Mumbai's investment in him has been so worth it. This is a length ball that angles in, Rayudu walks across and picks this up to hit it cleanly over deep backward square. <b> Raises the half-century in style </b>"
squeezes a full delivery back to the bowler
steps out and forces the slower delivery to long-off
"swivels back and fetches the pull from outside off towards deep midwicket. Stunning blow. Angling away, he could have tried to force it over point."
flicked uppishly but into the gap at deep midwicket
swing and a miss. Beaten by a ripping googly. Kuldeep did well to float this across Pollard
flat bats a delivery from outside off to long-on
"change of bats or no, he can hit them with a toothpick too, by the looks. Steps out, Kuldeep sees that and drops it short. No problem. Flat-batted hit over the bowler's head, straight into the advertising triangle"
sashays down the pitch and swings this from outside off towards wide long-on. This went much further into the stands
"this is what makes Kuldeep special. Hit for two sixes but that didn't deter him from flighting the ball again. Does well to float this wide, Rayudu couldn't use his reach to swing the ball as he stepped out. Uthappa effects a straightforward stumping. Rayudu asks the umpire why it wasn't called wide as he walks off."
"swing and a miss. Played too early, this was nicely floated at length. Drifted away just a wee bit"
"yorker-length outside off from around the stumps, Pollard looks to squeeze this behind point but the ball initially but changed his mind, got into a tangle of sorts as the ball passed the bat."
"sees the batsman walking across, bowls it way outside off, Pollard is beaten as he looks to scoop it over short fine. A few umpires would've raised their eyebrows and called it wide, not A Nanda Kishore. Good call"
"swings a full toss down the ground to wide long-on, tumbling stop by Pandey. The momentum was taking him over but he parried it to the long-off fielder"
"toe-ends a slog to Yusuf, who takes a skier at the edge of the circle at cover. The low dipping full toss from Boult, Pollard looked to swing across the line and ended up getting more elevation than distance. Yusuf called early and made a tough catch look easy."
flirting with the wide line. Started outside off and went further away. Hardik couldn't reach it
<b> Was it a no-ball? </b> No. Hit Pandya on the stomach off a thick outside edge. Turned the bat face too early as he looked to hit this over midwicket. Another good call from the umpire.
"tails in yorker into the pad, played too early, ball deflects to the off side as they take a run"
bowls the perfect inswinging yorker first up. This bends in from outside off at Narine's front toe. He gets the bat down in time to dig it out
"short and wide next ball, Narine makes a tiny leap to try and reach this, but it climbs past his outside edge"
seems like a plan. Narine backs away before Southee is into his stride. Southee bowls one at his chest and Narine cops it on the body as he looks to pull
"superb bowling. It was a clear plan not to let him drive. This was back of a length and it sat in the pitch. Might have just rolled his fingers on it. It climbed up at him on an off stump line as he tried to back away and slap it over mid-off. Could only lift it high to extra cover's left. Hardik there, watches it closely and gets under it quickly to complete the catch"
gets a full ball to swing way from middle stump and opens Lynn up. The batsman adjusts and pokes in front of his body to defend into the off side
"some rhythm here. Goes wide of the crease, gets it to move away from middle stump again from a good length. This time Lynn drives on the up with a closed face, hits it straight to mid-on"
"overpitched ball at leg stump, Gambhir shuffles across to try and flick it. Closes the face too soon and gets a leading edge that lands safely in the off side"
"back of a length, middle stump. Prods at this nervously and the bat turns in his hand. It trickles to short fine leg"
"close call. Full and wide outside off stump. Lynn had his front foot out of the way but this was too wide for him to reach, and wide enough to be called according to the umpire"
"yikes. Follows Lynn down the leg side with an offcutter at length. Lynn wants to turns this backward of square, but he misses entirely and takes one on the box"
"glorious. This is short at off stump. More confidence from Gambhir this time. Stands tall, gets behind it quickly and pulls this through the open midwicket region"
"full and down leg, he gets pad on this as he tries to flick, but Rayudu, the keeper, dives to his right and takes it on the half-volley"
"poor bowling. Drops it short and into his hips. He merely has to swivel and place this wide of short fine, and he does it  easily"
"wide of the crease, full ball at middle stump. This time, it doesn't swing. It's straight into Lynn's hitting zone and, predictably, the front leg is out of the way and the ball is lifted over the long-on boundary"
"ouch, gets another one in the box. Strong man, this fellow. Misses yet another pull shot against a slower ball, gets another leg bye into the leg side"
"short and wide outside off stump, Gambhir looks to cut, but this is well away from his reach. Beaten on the outside edge"
"this didn't look too different from the last ball. It's short and wide. He's beaten again on the cut, but the umpire thinks this one was a tad wider"
"back of a length outside off stump, slashes at it and gets it to sweeper cover on the bounce"
"legcutter, floated up nicely at middle stump. Lynn has made room and slogged this wide of long-on"
"lovely shot. This was regular pace from Southee, and it was climbing up at his mid-riff. It would have, anyway. Lynn got the bat well in front of his body and didn't allow it to climb. Then used his wrists to flick it wide of short fine"
shapes to cut but the ball drifts and fizzes away to beat him
chops an attempted cut this time to short third man. Tried to make room and ease it past point but was cramped for room
misses an attempted slog sweep. Had to fetch it from outside off.
steps out and just manages to clear cover. Not entirely convincing. Pressure on. Karn shouldn't be too disappointed.
cut away but straight to Southee at point
steps out and works it with the spin to deep midwicket
"he's dragged this slower ball from way outside off, didn't look like he hit it anywhere near the middle, still carries all the way over long-on. Looked ungainly as he executed that hoick but doesn't matter"
"cracking delivery. Yorker-length that swerves away late from off stump, Gambhir somehow manages to dig it out"
"the extra pace has done the trick. Gambhir not in position to play the pull, beaten for pace as he looks to take him on with the pull, top-edges it to short fine where Karn Sharma takes an excellent catch. It was a swirler, not easy but did well to see it right into his palms."
"looks to slash this shortish delivery over point, but didn't have the room he would've liked. Bounce as well for Johsnon, got big on him"
biffs this short ball on the body into the square leg boundary. What bat speed. Wow. Square leg umpire's head was in the firing line. He had to be switched on 100 % to get out of the way

"angles a full delivery into the pads, Lynn misses the flick. Hit on the pad"
"big moment in the game. Vinay digs this in short, Lynn pulls off the frontfoot but didn't get any power on that. Suchith, his Karnataka team-mate, moved to steps to his right to pouch that at deep midwicket"
"thick edge that flies over the third man boundary. Johnson was in business for a while, leapt high but just eluded him. Yusuf looked to swing this over midwicket but the ball nipped away late to take a thick outside edge."
"pulled but not off the middle, down to Suchith again at deep midwicket"
gets forward and dabs the length ball to cover
"turned back past Vinay on his followthrough, Pandya ran in a little quickly from mid-off and dived over the ball in trying to prevent the single. Ended up conceding two more. Vinay doesn't think that is funny"
"steps out to smack this across the line over deep midwicket, ended up getting a fat inside edge onto the body"
flipper that drifts back in a long way to hit him high on the pad. Sliding down leg.
"pulled just wide of the boundary rider at deep midwicket. Dropped it short, Pandey picked the length early and walloped that"
"chipped wide of the bowler, down towards the man coming in from long-on"
gets underneath the flight and whacks this over deep midwicket. Hitting it towards the bigger boundary but the timing on it was sublime.
"swung over the bowler's head, clears long-off so easily. Too much flight, Yusuf made room to free his arms and swing through"
muscles the short of length ball across the line to long-on. Flat hit
"excellent bouncer, excellent take by Rayudu. Yusuf looked to fetch the hook from way outside off, but couldn't"
slower ball but got the direction wrong as he slides down leg. Rayudu couldn't gather it cleanly
"cutter on middle, worked across the line to long-on"

flays the short of length delivery to deep point
punched through the line to wide mid-off

"drifting into the pads, worked to deep midwicket"
driven straight to Pollard at cover
"steps out to swing this over deep midwicket, ball dips on him as the thick inside edge rolls to Tiwary at deep midwicket"

"length on middle and leg, punched to deep midwicket. Sensible from Pandey"
steers an off cutter at length to point. A meter to his left and it was four

"drifting into the pads, worked with the angle to deep midwicket"

steers an away-going length ball to deep point
"length on middle and leg, defended back to the bowler"

backs away to squeeze this behind point but the ball takes a thin edge through to Rayudu. Or did it take the edge?
