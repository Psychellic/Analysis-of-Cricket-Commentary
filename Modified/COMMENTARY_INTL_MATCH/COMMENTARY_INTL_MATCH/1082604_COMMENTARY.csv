"full and straight to start, some inswing. Narine inside-halves a drive towards midwicket"
"some swing. The other way. Outswing. Full delivery outside off, Gambhir deflects a dab to third man"
"on a length outside off, Narine thinks of flirting but withdraws his bat late"
"nicely played. Good length delivery outside off, carved towards cover from the crease"
gives himself room. Bhuvi follows him with a yorker. Off the pad towards square leg. Inswinging yorker sliding well down
"what a beauty. Good length delivery outside off, swerves away and beats Gambhir on the outside edge"
"full and very wide outside off, Narine can't reach it but it's inside the tramline. A hint of away swing"
"flat-batted over Nehra. Good length delivery outside off, Narine stays back and slaps the ball past the bowler for four."
"a bit of a wild swing. At least, he isn't wasting deliveries. On a length outside off, Narine misses his lofted drive"
"good length outside off, a tad short. Slapped to mid-off for a run"
"good length outside off, pushed to mid-off. Nice lengths, no room either"
"another hoick. Fullish delivery on middle, worked to wide mid-on for a run"
"too straight, worked to square leg for a run"
"straight through. The best ball to the pinch-hitter - a yorker. An inswing yorker. Narine gives himself room, but the ball is too quick, it hustles underneath the bat and uproots off stump. Perfect from Bhuvneshwar. Again, not a bad call from KKR because he didn't waste too many balls."
"131 kph, <b>huge edge?</b> Off the face of the bat? Good length delivery outside off, the ball moves away. Uthappa follows the ball, and edges behind. The umpire doesn't give him, Anil Dandekar a blunder"
"good length delivery outside off, blocked into the cover"
"worked through midwicket for some runs. On a length and straight, flicked away nicely for three. Nice timing"
"not great timing. Full and straight, driven to mid-off for one. Warner cleans up"
"full and wide outside off. Gambhir gives the ball all he's got. Thwack. Forget timing, that was all power. Drilled past short cover"
"that's timing. Fullish, straight-ish. Driven elegantly to mid-off."
"a slower ball outside off, slapped to cover from the crease."
"that's a wide. 138 kph. Short delivery outside off, loops over Gambhir. Tennis-ball bounce"
"gets away with that. Full down leg, on the pads. Gambhir misses a flick. Off the pad to the keeper"
"nice comeback. Tight line, around off. Some movement back in, tapped towards the keeper"
"cramping Gambhir for room again. On a length on off, worked down to short fine leg for a run"
"terrible start from Cutting. Full on the pads, Gambhir misses his swivel-flick. Off the pad towards fine leg. Should have been four there"
"nicely clipped. Full and straight again, Uthappa tucks this fine and gets it past short fine leg. Easily done. Rubbish bowling though"
and another leg side delivery. That should have been four more. But Uthappa's flick finds deep square leg
"superb placement. Good length delivery outside off, Gambhir slaps a flat-batted drive past Warner at mid-off. That was all placement, and on this outfield, that's all he needed"
"good from Dandekar this time. Easy to try to compensate a bad decision. Short delivery down leg, Gambhir misses a pull. Sunrisers go up in appeal. But wide signalled"
worked down to short fine leg. Terrible lines so far this over
"good finish. On a length around off, guided towards extra cover for a single"
superb start. A legspinner that pitches on off and rips past the edge. Uthappa had no idea
"picked that alright. Again, wasn't quite reading it so chose the flat-batted option. The googly outside off, Uthappa stays low and slaps a six over long-on. Shot"
worked to square leg. Dhawan is quick on it and misses the stumps at the bowler's end<strong>. Would have been out with a direct hit</strong>
"Rashid strikes. Good nagging, accurate bowling. And that's a poor shot from Gambhir. Flat and straight, skids on, the legbreak. Gambhir gives himself room and misses a cut. Clatters into the stumps"
"the googly outside off, defended into the cover region"
"lovely. Flat delivery outside off, the ball rips past the outside edge. Lovely bowling"
"good length delivery, pushed away towards mid-on"
"on a length outside off, dabbed to third man"
"not a good shot. Short delivery on off, Uthappa doesn't look to keep it down, doesn't look to hit that over the fielder. Bounces just short of deep square leg"
worked away to wide mid-on. Stood tall and flicked that nicely
"too straight again, worked down to fine leg for a couple. Very fine. Clever batting"
"well played. Good length outside off, carved down to third man"
"flat and straight, the legbreak, worked down to short fine leg"
"another legbreak on off, pushed to cover"
the googly. Pandey goes right back and works the ball to deep midwicket for a couple. Read it off the pitch
"another googly on leg, worked to square leg. Well played. Play him out"
"did not read that. Flat and straight, another legbreak. Uthappa sweeps to deep square leg. Almost sneaked through"
"short delivery, flat, on off. Pulled to deep square leg"
"full outside off, hit down to long-on"
"overly full outside off, driven to cover"
"picks the length early. And then boom. Shortish on off, sits up for uthappa and then the swat goes way over midwicket. Stunning shot. Great timing too"
"that's five! 123 kph, dug in short. Too short. Loops over Uthappa and Ojha's heads. Terrible bowling"
"bunted back. Good length delivery on off, the ball stops on Uthappa, chipped back towards the bowler."
"offcutter on off, pushed to long-on. Nicely done"
"good length delivery, slapped away to cover for a quick single. Strategic time-out"
"oh lovely pace. Slow on middle, pushed back to the bowler"
"<strong>missed stumping. Another chance wasted</strong>. Lots of flight on middle and leg, Pandey comes down and misses a flick. The ball skids on and beats the bat. Naman Ojha can't collect cleanly. There was an inside edge on that actually. Tough chance. Dropped catch too"
worked to deep midwicket
"short and slow on off, slapped to cover"
"picks the length very early again does Uthappa. Shortish delivery on off, Uthappa may have beaten the bowler in the mind. Feigned a forward movement but stayed back. And then hammered a pull over long-on. Great timing"
"slow on off, some turn. Off the outside edge towards point. Excellent pace in that over"
"131 kph, full on off. Uthappa walks across, surprised slightly by the pace on it. But Uthappa gets his sweep down in time, picks his area and the ball travels over the boundary. Sensational timing"
"133 kph, slower delivery down leg, nudged down to fine leg. Uthappa looking really good today"
"shortish delivery outside off, nicely cut to deep point. Played that late"
"good batting. Got the boundary early in the over so just accumulate. Good length on off, worked to midwicket with soft hands for a couple"
"slower delivery outside off, pushed to point. 11 off the over so far"
"drops short. Hits a hard length on middle and leg, Pandey is hurried for pace as he pulls. Falls short of long-on"
"completely misread the length. Wants to pick Rashid off the pitch so goes right back. It's full, it's straight. Pushed to long-on somehow"
"falls just short of Dhawan at deep midwicket. A googly on middle, Uthappa sweeps, connects quite well but it's flat. Dhawan runs in, the ball lands in front and goes past for four. <strong>Uthappa's fifty too. Quality</strong>"
"flat on off, pushed back"
"sees Uthappa coming and shortens the length on off, the legbreak. Could have maybe pushed that wider. Worked towards point"
"flat on off, stays back and defends. Dangerous from Pandey, whatever works for you"
"a googly on middle, clipped to deep midwicket. Tidy over for both sides actually"
"short delivery down leg, pulled towards short fine leg"
"big appeal. Anil Dandekar wants to check if it's carried. <strong>The soft signal is out.</strong>A full delivery down leg, Uthappa looks to sweep, but the ball hits the pad en route to the keeper. Naman Ojha runs in and gets his fingers underneath. I'm not sure if there was bat or glove on that actually. Yep, no bat or glove. Can he still reverse this decision? Does he have the power to overturn the on-field wrong decision? <strong>Or does he just check the catch?</strong> I'm not sure if the third umpire has the authority to overturn that. Not out says the third umpire. Eventually, common sense and logic prevails, because the right decision is made. But these are the protocols, aren't they?"
"high in the air and four. Back of a length delivery on off, swatted to deep midwicket. In the gap"
"full delivery outside off, Uthappa gives himself room and lofts the ball over cover. Lovely timing. Picked the right area"
"a nice slower ball outside off, carved down to third man"
"finds the gap does Pandey. Full and wide outside off,m Pandey gives himself room and nails a drive through extra cover. Great timing, but placement even better"
"edged and carries for four. Flat delivery outside off, the ball rips away from the bat. Uthappa's sweep results in a top edge which carries to the third man boundary"
"the googly outside off, swatted on the bounce to long-on"
"overpitched delivery outside off, hammered to cover. A misfield allows a run"
"flat and wide outside off, hammered to long-off"
"a loopy legbreak outside off, hit powerfully down to long-on for a run."
"the googly to finish. Straight. Uthappa doesn't quite pick it, but goes back and cuts to point."
a legcutter outside off. Sees Uthappa backing away so fires it outside off. Great bowling
"taken this time. Uthappa's quality innings ends. Another legcutter, shortish outside off. Uthappa looks to pull but mis-times it slightly, the bat handle turning in his hands. Skews off the outside half and hangs in the air for enough time for Rashid to get around and take it. Good catch."
"a thick outside edge and four. Back of a length outside off, Pandey gets a thick edge which flies past Ojha"
"another legcutter on off, pushed to long-on"
"good length on off, shovelled towards square leg"
"short of a length on off, swatted to deep midwicket for a single. Lovely timing"
"flat and wide outside off, slapped to cover"
"gets down, gets to the pitch, and gets six. Flight outside off, Pandey runs down and hammers a nice clean mow over long-on. Enough power"
strays down leg for a wide
"another flat delivery that drifts down leg. Pandey walks across, misses a flick. Why isn't that a wide?"
"full and wide outside off, hammered down to Warner at long-off who scurries to his right and saves three. Exceptional."
"chips down but Bipul drags the length back. Flat on off, blocked"
"flight outside off, swatted away to deep midwicket. Skips off the outfield. Lovely timing. picked his spot"
"that's not a good ball. Full on off, Pandey clears his front leg and then hammers a flat six over long-off. Can't miss your length at Eden Gardens"
"a low full toss outside off, Pandey gets just enough bat on that to guide it past point. Lovely placement."
"finally gets his length right. The legcutter outside off, beats the bat. Spongy bounce, use it"
"another legcutter on off, swatted to deep midwicket for a couple. Good running from Yusuf"
"bangs it in. Short delivery on off, pulled to long-on"
"slow short one on off, flat-batted away to deep midwicket"
"full and wide outside off, would have been called had he not got bat on it. Toe-ended to the keeper"
"good length delivery outside off, carved behind point for the second. Good running again from Yusuf"
"a low full toss on off, pushed to long-off"
"that's a change in pace. The slower delivery outside off, Pandey is through his lofted drive too early. Warner runs in from long-off. Bipul runs back from cover. Warner takes the catch but wasn't happy with Bipul being so close to him. Doesn't say anything though"
"another legcutter, pushed to cover"
"short of a length, cut to deep point. Just four from that. KKR slowing down."
"drifts down leg does Nehra, wide"
drifts down leg again. Wide. Looking for the leg side yorker.
"a low full toss, shovelled to deep midwicket for a couple of runs."
"full and straight, right In Yusuf's wheelhouse. Swatted to deep midwicket, on the bounce"
"good length delivery on leg, inside-edged towards square leg. An unnecessary thjow should have resulted in an overthrow but the batsmen don't take it"
"used those wrists. A low full toss on middle and leg, Suryakumar walks across and picks the flick over square leg. Got it over square leg. Picked his area"
"taken this time. And given by ump Dandekar. Short down leg, Suryakumar gets some glove on his pull. Naman dives to his left and takes the catch. One-handed."
"a yorker to finish, outside off. CdG can't get bat on that"
"there's six of them. Slower ball outside off, in Yusuf' swinging arc and whack. His swing and power takes the ball easily over long-on"
"should have been called wide. A low full toss that looked outside the tramline, to my eyes."
"low full toss on off, pushed to long-on. Just one."
"superb bowling. Unplayable. The inswinging yorker on off, de Grandhomme can't get his bat down in time. The ball sneaks under the bat and clatters into off stump. Momentum for Sunrisers"
"fullish delivery outside off, pushed to the sweeper cover for a single"
"great bowling. A low full toss outside off, sliced to deep point for a run. No thought of the second"
"back of length on middle and leg, good bounce and Warner stays back to defend on the off side"
errs down the leg side for a wide this time
"much better from Umesh - swings it nicely into Warner from good length, Warner gets a thick inside edge to midwicket for two quick runs"
"wider on the off side now, Warner lets it go and Uthappa fumbles to collect it. Concedes a bye"
"towards the leg side again, he's not getting his lines right, and Dhawan gets if off the pad towards short fine leg"
"short now on the off side, Dhawan gets a bit of room and cuts it uppishly to third man"
"pitches it up, Warner drives, and the ball beats him to go through to the keeper"
"hint of swing but he's given too much room on the off side, Dhawan flashes and gets a thick edge flying over the slip region for a four. That hit the laptop in the Sunrisers dugout"
"bit closer to the off stump, Dhawan watches and pushes to point"
"not too much room this time, Dhawan punches it to point again"
"steps out of the crease and swings, Boult pitches it a touch short and an inside edge goes into the covers"
"superb bounce for a pace bowler. It was off good length without much room, Dhawan tried to cut it without footwork but missed"
"<b>dropped</b>! Dhawan stepped out again and connected well this time, he cut it with some power and the ball flew to cover point where the fielder put in a dive but couldn't hold on to it. It was Woakes there and the ball just carried to his right hand"
"nicely bowled on middle and leg, he waits and pushes into the covers"
"bit too short and Dhawan slaps it back over the bowler for a four. There was room too and he got to free his arms, swung his bat hard enough for a four"
tries to steal a single by nudging the ball to mid-on but there's no time
whips with hard hands for another four. Don't think he middled it but the swing was such that he got enough power to get the ball to the boundary in the vacant area
"nicely bowled on the off stump, accurate lines. Dhawan used the angle and ran it down to third man for one"
makes a bit of room as he often does but doesn't get the space to free his arms. Nudges the ball towards point from off stump
angles a short of length ball into Dhawan who waits on the back foot but cannot tuck it away
"bangs it in short on the off side, Dhawan wants to cut it fine on off but is beaten by the bounce and pace"
"short again, but this one comes into him and he gets on top of the ball nicely to pull it away towards square leg for four"
"another short ball, this one is pulled to deep midwicket for one"
"good short ball, he nearly made Warner take his eyes off the ball but his adjustment is so good that he pulls it away behind square for four"
"<em>just</em> short of cover and four more! That ball stopped a little before reaching Warner who was almost through with his off-side push. The ball went in the air, fell short of Gambhir and then went through him"
"turns it away from outside off, Dhawan waits and pushes to cover"
"floats it nicely towards leg, Dhawan works it towards midwicket for one"
"too much on the leg side, it was full too and Warner did well to nudge it late and fine on the leg side to beat short fine leg"
"it turns from leg stump, Warner wants to turn it to leg but gets a leading edge towards point"
takes out a powerful sweep for a single to deep backward square leg
opens up a little for the offspinner and pushes it into the covers
"makes room for the shortish delivery, doesn't turn much as Dhawan pushes it to off for one"
goes the other way with the angle as Warner makes room too but can't clear point
there's the switch hit form Warner and it goes for four. He switched his hands and went down on a knee to sweep that as a right-hander over short third man for a one-bounce four
"makes room to push it to mid-off, a bit of a mix up as both batsmen come forward amid with a lot of yes and nos, eventually both return safely"
""
"bit too full on the pads, Warner drives it away to long-on for one"
"length delivery outside off, pushed into the off side"
"too full on off, there's some room and he drills it straight to cover"
"a bit shorter on middle stump, Warner goes across and works it to midwicket for one"
"holes out to long-off, Yusuf has struck! He stepped out to get to the pitch of the ball but didn't use enough power to go over long-off or didn't place it wide of him. Easy catch for de Grandhomme"
"angling into the batsman, he works it to leg off the back foot again"
"steps out first ball, Yusuf bangs it in short from around the wicket and Moises is hurried into defending it"
"floats it nicely towards off stump, Warner doesn't pick it properly and gets a thick edge to point"
"lovely delivery beats Warner completely! Tossed it up beautifully, Warner came out of the crease to sweep it away, but was beaten as the ball dipped and Uthappa could not hold on to it either. <strong>Missed the stumping</strong>"
"drives it nicely into the covers, well stopped by Surya with a dive"
"fullish again, he drives again and Surya dives to his left to save some runs again"
"tosses it up nicely, Warner lunges forward a bit and manages to defend it back. He's not picking them"

bit too short and Warner swat-pulls it to square leg
"turns it into the batsman from outside off, he goes back and tucks it to deep midwicket"
"pitches outside leg, Warner goes back towards off and tucks it towards short fine leg for one"
turns it sharply into Henriques who is beaten to put it away. Takes it on the body
good running as Henriques tucks this one off the back foot towards long-on with soft hands so that he can come back for two
"enough room for Warner to go back and smash it, but straight to sweeper cover"
"it's the wrong'un, Henriques seemed to have picked it and he went inside the crease to cut it nicely in the gap"
not much room this time as the batsman goes back and is strangled for room to only defend it back
"makes him go on the back foot again, little low bounce and Henriques defends dangerously in front of the stumps with a thick edge to point for one"
"Warner had not been picking him properly and now he's picked out long-off! Has Woakes taken an easier catch? It was nicely flighted outside off with some drift, Warner swung his bat and shook his head the moment the ball took off, he knew he was going to be out"
"on the off stump, Yuvraj leans forward a bit and defends"
"slightly full on the off side, driven down to mid-off for a quick single"
"fullish outside off, Yuvraj swings and gets a thick edge to third man"
"short ball on off, Henriques gets enough time to hang back and he then dabbed it late enough to beat third man for a four"
"he's handed a return catch to Woakes, big blow for Sunrisers! Length delivery on the off side, Henriques shows the straight-bat technique beautifully with a drive but he's played it uppishly and Woakes take a good catch just around waist height"
"offcutter from back of length, Hoods gets off the mark with a nudge to leg"
"too short and not towards the body, so Yuvraj has no trouble dispatching it between long-on and deep midwicket with a powerful pull for a one-bounce four"
that's a brave shot from Hooda - steps out to get to the pitch of the ball and smashes it with the turn over long-on for a clean six
leans forward this time to defend patiently
"bit of flight on middle stump, he sweeps powerfully behind square for one"
takes a step down to chip it down to long-on for one
it's the wrong'un and Hooda goes on the back foot to let it turn away and then pushes it down to long-on
gets his bat close to the pad to defend the turning ball and gets a single to leg
"that's classic Yuvraj, what a sight that is! Pitched up and Yuvraj stays still to show the full face of the bat for a straight lofted six with a beautiful follow through. No number of replays are enough for that"
"short this time, on the leg side, and he changes position quickly to pull it fine and late over short fine leg for four"
full from Umesh and almost another handsome drive but it's rolled straight to mid-off
"back of length on the leg side, he tries to tuck it fine off his toes but the ball takes only the thigh pad before it's caught very well by Uthappa. Appeal for caught behind turned down"
"fullish on the pads now, gets a leg bye towards square leg"
excellent execution for four. It wasn't graceful or elegant but Hooda did well to make room and steer the ball with perfect timing to bisect point and third man
"on the pads, driven on the leg side for one to long-on"
"steps out, misses and he's stumped in quick time by Uthappa. Narine floated the ball with a scrambled seam, Hooda danced down the track for a slog but missed the line completely and Uthappa took the bails out this time"
"turns the ball away from good length, he defends"
turns it into him this time and Cutting tucks it to deep square leg
he waits on the back foot for the ball to turn and defends cautiously
too much on the leg side now and he tucks it behind square for one
"too wide outside off with the angle, left for a wide"
"slightly slower at 120kph, it's a short ball too but it has so much room that Yuvraj opens his arms and swings it away over the covers for another six. No need to move his feet again"
"134kph, on length outside off, he cuts it nicely to sweeper cover now"
"too short and coming in, Cutting hangs back and pulls it away nicely to the cow corner for four"
"bangs it in nicely on off, headed towards the shoulders as Cutting defends it close to the pitch for one"
"another wide on the off side, erring with the lines Woakes"
"the slower cutter does it this time, another batsman caught down the ground as Yuvraj picks long-on. Back of length on the off side, Yuvraj wanted to swat it away to the leg side but got a leading edge for Rishi Dhawan. Checking for the no ball but he's fine"
he's greeted with a short ball and he goes on his toes to tuck it to leg for one
"slightly short outside off, Ojha waits and punches it to sweeper cover"

"fullish on the pads, flicked away in the air and Surya slides to his right from deep midwicket and throws the ball to Boult"
"back of length outside off, cuts it towards point for one"
"too full, too straight and Cutting tonks it straight back and high over the bowler's head for a straight six"
"it's the short and slow offcutter again, he doesn't time it properly and gets a single by pulling the ball to midiwicket"
"a catch has been taken off Boult! Looked like he ran his fingers over it outside off, Cutting lofted it down the ground and found long-off for a straightforward catch"
"length delivery outside off, he tries to swing it away but misses"
"just back of length and coming in, he defends it back because there's no room"
"accurate yorker right on the leg stump, he digs it out to mid-on for one"
"tries another yorker, this one's driven to cover for another single"
"makes room, the length ball is headed for the stumps and he finds cover with a drive"
"full and wide, which is perfect considering Bipul is trying to back away to leg and haul it away. Can't reach it now so doesn't attempt a shot"
"length ball, and this time Bipul swings his arms and crashes it over the straight boundary."
"nails the wide yorker, and Bipul again, trying to make room on the leg side, is stranded. Tries a slash, doesn't connect"
"drums a length ball down the ground, but de Grandhomme races to his left from long-on and stops the boundary"
"they sneak a bye basically after the wicketkeeper hits the stumps. Naman is backing up, then he stops since Bipul has not moved. Sees Uthappa's underarm throw hit the target, and then sneaks the run"
"tough to call it a <b>drop</b>, but... Naman goes for a pull, but the short ball is too quick, and climbs too high. Gets it on the splice, and it goes to short fine leg. The fielder Kuldeep Yadav runs back, reaches up over his head to try and claim the catch, but isn't able to."
"back of a length and outside off, Bipul goes for a huge swing and comes up with a big miss"

"low full toss on leg stump, flicks it through to deep midwicket"
"goes for the yorker on middle, gets an inside edge through midwicket"
