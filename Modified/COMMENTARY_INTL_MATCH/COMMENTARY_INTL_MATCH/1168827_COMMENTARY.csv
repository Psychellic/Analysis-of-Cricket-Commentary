"some nip in through the air straight away to start, and there's a yelp of excitement as Shan wears one on the pad, but its headed down the leg side"
"and he pushes one across Vince, who taps it off the back foot- but straight to cover"
"Tanvir fires another one across Vince's bows, the right hander jabbing down at the ball to collect a single to third man"
"tap-and-run single for Shan Masood, who nudges to mid on and immediately senses the chance for a single"
"<b>clubbed down the ground!</b> Tanvir's fullest ball of the over, and it's smacked straight back past him. Clears the front leg, and mid off doesn't have a chance"
"<b>improvisation now!</b> Vince knows theres not much bounce off this track, so he bends low and fetches a sweep down to fine leg"
"straight away Shan shimmies down the track to meet it on the full, turning the strike over with a drive to long on"
"Vince stays deep despite the low bounce, nudging to extra cover"
"not much turn for Nawaz, and Shan eases another single down the ground"
"Vince backs right away to leg, exposing the stumps but also opening up for a shot to cover, the fielder there taking the sting out of the shot and stopping the one"
"pushed to cover once again, but this time theres space for a quick single"
Shan stays rooted to the crease and works another single into the gap at cover
"he hits a length first up, but his line slips towards Shan's legs and he's easily worked to fine leg for a single"
"pitched up to Vince outside off, and he slugs a drive at mid off"
"<b>backs away and bottoms hands a swipe to leg!</b> Mid on got close, but dived over the top of a well-struck drive. Didn't over hit it, but the timing was sweet"
"Irfan pulls his length back a touch, and Vince forces to gully"
"crunched off the back foot again, even as he is rushed a little by Irfan's pace off the wicket, but once again the shot is stopped in the ring"
"Vince keeps the strike, walking into a drive that finds just enough room to the left of extra cover for a quick single"
"arm ball from Nawaz, but it's <b>muscled through midwicket</b> by Vince. He just missed his length, and paid the price"
"<b>same area, but hit even harder!</b> Vince picked the length early again, getting underneath a pull to wide long on"
"chipped, and <i>just</i> short of mid on! Vince came down the track but got a little close to the ball and couldn't get under his drive. Fortunately for him, the timing was way off too"
"<b>but this is timed!</b> Vince has cleared his front leg to get a couple away previously, but this shimmy-and-drive through cover is all class"
"Vince misses a sweep and the appeal goes up, but the answer is no ... Well, they're asking for a <b>review</b>. The umpire''s given it as runs, but it doesnt look like he got any bat on it. And three reds confirm, Vince is out!"
and hes off the mark straight away with a neat little drive through cover
"on a length, outside off, and its slashed away through point"
"short, on middlle, and its tapped to midwicket with a short arm jab"
"finally Shan gets one away, but it's thanks to a horrid misfield at cover. A good looking drive at a slower ball slips straight through the hands of the cover fielder, and away for four"
"straighter from Tanvir, and he can't get this one away"
"<b>another review!</b> Tanvir is wicket to wicket again, and the ball slips through Shan''s flick to hit him on the pad. Theres an extended appeal, but the umpire says no. It looks high, and possibly headed down leg too. No bat on it, and ball tracking shows its umpires call! Close ..."
"<b>through him!</b> Tanvir just rolled his fingers on this one, and it shoot through low, past Evans hurried jab. Fortunately for him, it was outside off"
"short from Irfan, and Shan is through his pull too early, wearing the ball on the body. They pinch a single as the ball dribbles to leg"
"<b>beaten outside off!<//b> Again the ball just dribbles through, beating Evans' cut on the bottom edge"
"hes down the wicket to hammer a drive to cover, but Evans cant quite beat the field"
"<b>pulled out to long leg!<b> Too short from Irfan, Shan picking the length early and swiveling to pull"
"<b>this one is even better!</b> Shan makes a little room and then lifts a full ball straight back over the bowlers head. Superb timing, and thats the <b>team fifty up!</b>"
"Irfan ends the over with a delivery tight on off stump, and the shot is stopped at point"
"flighted up outside off, and a drive is slashed through cover"
"googly from Fawad, and Shan just about reads it. He wants a single, and after some indecision Evans sends him back"
"swept down to fine leg, just the one"
"Evans jumps down the track and hammers a stinging drive back to Fawad, who manages to stop it. Powerfully hit, and that's a brave stop"
"a touch short outside off, and Evans cuts out to the cover sweeper"
"<b>stumped him!</b> Fawad has been flighting the ball beautifully through the whole over, and this one is no different. He floats one up above the eyeline and Shan is tempted to run down the pitch, but he runs straight pasts a googly and is easily stumped"
"nicely straight to start, and its met with a defensive bat"
"shades of de Villiers in this shot, a cute pick-up over square leg to a length delivery, but he finds the man in the deep"
"Shoaib's off the mark straight away, staying deep in the crease and lacing a backfoot punch through cover point. Only a diving effort in the deep saves the boundary"
"Mudassar comes round the wicket this time, cramping the batsman for room with one that nips in to him a touch"
"just short of a good length again, but the ball keeps it allow and takes the timing out of Malik's press to cover"
"width offered outside off, and a drive is threaded through backward point for a single"
"wonderfully floated up just outside off, and a soft drive is stopped at cover"
"Malik is down the track this time to meet the ball on the full, flicking a single through square leg"
"ramped up and over the keeper, and Evans gets a decent connection but there's no pace at all to work with from Fawad, who is still flighting them up"
"glanced square on the leg side, and they hustle through for a second"
"flighted, full and straight, and on this slow track all Evans can do is tap it back to the bowler"
"Evans is forward on the drive, but he pings the cover field and cant get it away"
"<b>chaos!</b> Who is even out here? Malik is down the track to flick to the leg side, he wants two but Evans says no, but then sets off anyway after Malik as both turn and sprint towards the non-strikers end. And the umpires want to have a look at who is actually out, as both batsmen were racing to get in at the same end ... and its Evans, by a whisker, who is finally ruled out."

"rushed on straight with the arm, and Christian swipes a single into the leg side"
"theres a speculative 'howzat?' from the bowler as Malik comes down the track but is hit on the pad, but hes come acres down the pitch and its outside the line"
"Malik is down the track again, but he cant get this one away either"
"<b>but this one he does get away, and then some!</b> For the third time in a row Malik uses his feet, but this time he's nicely to the pitch and hammers a straight drive up, up and away over the bowler's head"
"placed through the leg side, and he keeps the strike"
"Malik comes down the track, but Mudassar adjusts his length and a shot is stopped at cover point"
"flicked in the air to wide long on, and there is space for them to come back for a second"
"Malik whips off the hip, and again they push for two as the ball is stopped in the outfield"
"<b>fetched down to fine leg!</b> This ball kept really low, but Malik bent even lower to meet it, lapping the ball down to the boundary"
"<b>powerfully lofted down the ground!</b> He checks the drive a little, and it doesnt go the distance but is placed well enough to beat both long on and long off"
"clipped away, one more and it <b>brings up the team 100</b>. They have a platform laid, can they launch?"
chopped down through gully for a single
"<b>excited appeal from Irfan!</b> He fires one in full and straight to beat Christian's leg glance and hit him on the pad. The bowler and the keeper discuss it, and they ask for the <b>review</b>, but it's not a good one as the ball is headed <i>way</i> down the leg side. Not out"
"yorker from Irfan, and it's dug out through mid on"
"<b>through him!</b> Christian set himself for a heave-ho to leg, but the ball keeps low and rushes past the bat, pads and the leg stump on it's way through to Sarfraz"
"pinpoint yorker once more, and he can only tap it back to the bowler. Very tight over so far"
"oh dear, <b>nothing tight about this one</b>. Irfan had been doing so well, but this one slips out as a high full toss and Christian swats it over square leg for six. And it's called a no ball for height! <b>Free hit coming up</b>"
"Christian clears his front leg to heave at the Free Hit, but its too full to get under and his drive is stopped at cover"
"short and rising on middle stump, but the pitch takes the sting out of the ball and Christian is unhurried as he pulls into the leg side"
"sprayed miles down the leg side, and even a diving Sarfraz can't stop it. Extras, and that <b>brings up the fifty stand between these two</b>"
Christian opens up his stance and slugs a drive into the leg side
"Malik walks across and fetches a full ball through square leg, getting an <b>excellent connection</b> on the shot and placing it well too, well enough to have the beating of the fielder"
"Mudassar pulls his length back a touch, and Malik drives to long on"
"<b>poor bowling, this</b>, Mudassar hurling a length delivery down the leg side, and Malik helps it on its way with a lap-pull to continue racing through the 40s"
"<b>poor bowling, this</b>, on a length and headed down the leg side, Malik justs helps it on its way with a lap-pull to continue racing through the 40s. And that's 16 from the over!"
"swiped into the leg side, just the one"
"slower bouncer, and Malik under edges his cut, the ball bouncing through to Sarfraz"
"<b>Malik goes to fifty!</b> This is just what Multan Sultans needed. The ball was on a length and Malik stayed deep in the crease, lifting the ball <i>just</i> over the boundary line beyond square leg"
"sliced through the cover field, but the shot is stopped in the deep and its just the one"
"sprayed down the leg side, too far"
"<b>Malik holes out!</b> The ball was in his arc, and he cleared the front leg to set up the shot, but he just didn't get enough on it to beat Ahsan Ali in the deep. Important strike for Gladiators!"
and he ends the over by <b>beating him outside off</b> with a slower cutter
"hes cramped for room by one that shapes in to him a touch, tapping it back to the bowler"
<b>smoked down the ground!</b> It was pitched up to him and Russell held nothing back. The umpire was even in a little danger as the ball rocketed back past the bowler
"slower ball, and Russell can't quite time his swipe into the leg side"
"<b>another slower ball, and this one brings a wicket!</b>. Christian sliced underneath his loft down the ground a little, and mistimed it it to Nawaz at long off"
"hurled down the leg side, and theres an appeal, but the umpire responds by signalling wide"
pushed down the ground
"what a time to be alive! Afridi walks right across to the off stump to his very first delivery, but he misses his glance and he's hit on the pad. There's a big appeal, and he's given out first ball! But what's this, Afridi is <b>reviewing it</b>. Well, I'm not too sure why he's done that, as it's hit him plumb in front. And in fact Afridi walks off even before the full review is completed"
"tight from Tanvir, and Russell can't get it away"
"slower ball, and it's powered into the leg side, the batsmen rushing back for a second"
"mistimed down the ground, and Russell isn't happy with the bat he's using"
"Tanvir gives Ansar nothing to work with, aiming right at the stumps, and he can only tap it back to the bowler"
"another slower one, and Ansar finds a single off his pad as the ball rolls down the leg side"
"third slower ball in a row, and there's nothing Russell can do with it, great death bowling this"
"full, wide, and Russell <b>throws the proverbial kitchen sink</b> in order to lace the ball up and over point"
"oh dear, an attempted yorker slips out as a very high full toss outside off, and its been called a no-ball for height. <b>Free hit</b> coming up"
"another full toss, and this one is top edged down to third man for four more"
"<b>the full toss has worked!</b> Russell flings his hands at another full toss outside off, but he slices this one in the air and out to deep cover, where Rossouw comes charging across and holds a good catch diving forward as the ball dies on him"
"slashed through cover, and they hurry back for a second"
"<b>and another!</b> Nauman Ali spots a low full toss outside off, but he slugs his shot straight out to deep cover. He couldnt get enough underneath it"
"<b>third wicket in the over!</b> The ball is a good one, right on the toes, and he can't get it away. They chance a single off the last ball, but the shy at the stumps is good and he's well short"
"and Watson is solidly forward to smother the first ball - full, outside off - into the covers"
a bottom-edged hack bounces into the covers as Shafiq offers a little width
"a firm crunch off the bat as Watson stays deep in the crease and punches into the covers, but he pings the field again"
"and now the timing evades him again, Watson tapping to cover off the toe end. Perhaps the pitch is a little two-paced"
"floated up full on the pads, and Watto is off the mark with a firm glance through backward square leg"
"Ahsan Ali is off the mark to the very first ball he faces in the PSL, nudging a length delivery through midwicket"
"flighted on off stump, and Watson presses the ball to cover"
"Watson can't lay bat to ball as he bends low to sweep, the ball rushing on to hit his pad as it heads down the leg side"
"swatted in the air over midwicket as Nauman misses his length a little. It's Shan Masood who dives to stop it close to the boundary, and he may have hurt his shoulder. He looks in a little discomfort"
<b>almost through him!</b> The ball rushes on with the arm and ricochets off the pad into the leg side
"nudged down the ground, just the one"
"<b>finally Watson gets one away!</b> Too short from Nauman, and Watto rocks back to hammer a punch off the back foot and between the diving fielders"
"<b>smeared down the ground!</b> The ball was right up to him, and Ahsan just sent it back past the bowler with a full flow of the bat"
"on a length, just outside off, and its tapped through cover point"
"<b>bottom edged!</b> Watson swipes over the top of a length delivery, bottom edging into the leg side"
"now, what's happened here? Watson swipes the ball into the leg side, and a direct hit is fired into the stumps as he reaches the other end ... they go upstairs, but he's easily home. Ah, and Shafiq has tumbled in his follow through delivering that ball. He's holding his hamstring. And he's leaving the field now, there's clearly an issue as the Physio walks him off. Dan Christian will complete the over"
"his first ball kisses the pad on the way down the leg side, the batsmen stealing a single"
"<b>excellent placement!</b> Watson didn't look to hit this one too hard, just hanging back and caressing the ball through the gap between gully and short third man for a boundary"
pushed down the ground
"Watson sets himself early outside leg stump, and then laces a backfoot punch through the covers. Malik sets after it, but the ball slips out of his hands like a bar of soap. He tumbles, dives, and eventually stops it, but he's in contact with the boundary marker as he does so"
"<b>hammered through point</b> and it's four more! It's too short, Watson spots it early and scythes a cut through point"
"<b>and now through the leg side!</b> He missed a shot just like this one earlier, but this time Watson bends low and hammers a sweep behind square"
"<b>four in a row!</b> Watto sets a solid base at the crease and then just swings his arms through the line, lifting the ball up and over mid off for his fourth consecutive boundary"
"ah, and a dot to finish! Watson looks to attack the cover field again, but hits it straight to the man"
"and he hits a splice-jarring length straight away, the ball being tapped to point"
"<b>Irfan strikes second ball!</b> He rolled his fingers over the ball and found some disconcerting bounce. Ahsan was hurried into a pull, the ball taking a swirling top edge and landing up on the opposite side of the wicket, caught by Nauman Ali at third man!"
"steepling bounce for Irfan as he digs the ball in short, Rossouw managing to keep his pull down as he sends the ball to Afridi, on the bounce"
"short again, and this one rushes through him to hit Rossouw on the thigh, and they steal a single"
"bad line from Irfan, and Watson finds the boundary yet again with a hop and a glance down to the fine leg boundary"
"phew! Snorter from Irfan, leaping up off the track off a short length and past Watson in a flash"
"whoops, his first ball strays well down the leg side"
"headed legside-ish again, but this time it hits the pad and rolls away for a single"
"<b>flayed through cover point!</b> Too short, too wide, and Watson doesn't miss out. And that shot also brings up the team fifty"
"up-and-over mid on this time! After that slow start, Watson has well and truly found his touch now"
<b>three in a row!</b> And it's a deft touch this time. Watson dabs his bat down at the last moment to late cut down to third man
"Russell adjusts his line, it's straighter and Watson can't do anything with this one"
"short, and it's pulled but straight to the fielder"
"on a length and straight, Watson working across his pad"
"fired in at the pads, and still Rossouw isn't off the mark as they take a run off the leg"

Irfan slips one down the leg side to add one to the extras column
<b>finally Rossouw is off the mark!</b> Irfan helps him off the duck with a leg stump half volley that he just helps on its way down to fine leg
"punched off the back foot, mid off is deep and they find a single"
"<b>past the outside edge!</b> Or is it? Multan think there's an edge, and they ask for a <b>review</b>. They took an age to ask for the review, and Watto isn't happy. But replays swiftly show he's got nothing on it"
"and first ball he's <b>clubbed through the covers!</b> He floated one up outside off, and Rossouw flung his arms through a drive to get it away"
"straighter, and it's tapped back to the bowler"
"turned into the leg side, just the single"
Watson waits in his crease and nudges a legbreak through point to turn the strike over
"googly, flighted up outside leg, and Rossouw clips it fine"
"so much for predictions! Watson <b>brings up his fifty</b> with a confident bosh down the ground, lunging forward to get to the pitch and lifting the ball straight back over Afridi's head"
"Rossouw backs away and carves through point, but there's cover in the deep"
Watson is half forward to place the ball through cover
"Rossouw looks to manufacture a stroke through the covers, but he can't get it away"

"speared down on a middle and off line, Watson stepping forward to push back to the bowler"
Watson sets himself and paddle-sweeps down to fine leg for one
punched down the ground
"Watson backs away and lofts extravagantly over extra cover. He doesn't get the timing he wants though, and the ball plugs in the outfield"
"googly from Afridi, and Watson struggles to read it but places the ball to point, where Christian runs across and dives onto the astro turf getting the ball back in to the keeper. Ouch!"
"slapped through cover point and out to the sweeper, bringing up the <b>fifty partnership</b>"

"Rossouw gets low to sweep, and finds a single to deep square"
"firmly slapped down the ground, where long off cleans up to keep them to one"
"Nauman spots Rossouw coming down the track and changes his line of attack, good bowling and he can only turn it to fine leg"
"again Watson stays deep, hammering the ball down to long off"
"<b>and he gets rid of Watson!</b> Afridi floated the ball up full on the leg stump and Watson aimed a big swipe over the leg side. The ball took the top edge and ballooned out to the sub fielder Moores at long off, who tumbles but holds the catch. Boom Boom strikes!"

"flicked into the leg side, with the turn, just the one"
"Umar's off the mark straight away, and Afridi isn't happy as the fielder is slow cutting off the single. Rossouw, meanwhile, asks his partner to call a little louder"
"loud call of ''no!' this time as Rossouw squirts the ball to cover, sets off, and is sent back"
"Umar taps to cover and shouts 'yes!' but Rossouw says 'no, no no!' and there's no single to be had"
"short and Umar swings over the top of the ball on the pull, <b>beaten</b>"
Umar hops to ride the bounce and finds a single through gully
"pressure released, Irfan slinging one down the leg side and Rossouw meeting it with a <b>flowing pull shot</b> to get the ball away"

"Umar watches the ball very closely, defending a legbreak into the leg side"
a cute little dab brings a quick single to third man
"full, straight, and its tapped back to the bowlers"
"<b>dropped at the long on boundary</b> and it goes for six! Rossouw went for a big hit into the leg side, and got more height than distance but the fielder  - is it Moore? - can only parry it over the rope for six"

<b>clubbed to wide long off!</b> Rossouw made room and just carved through the line

"short again, and Umar is unhurried as he works the ball off the armpit into the leg side"
