"ooh, some seam movement right away. Angles this into off stump and gets it to straighten as Rohit plays half-forward in defence. Ball drops well short of the wide second slip."
"back of a length, close to off stump, defended into the point region"
"full now, angling into off stump, defended towards mid-off"
"length ball, fifth-stump line, left alone"
"fuller, a bit of swing away. Starts just a touch too wide to make Rohit play"
"length ball angling into middle and off stumps, defended from the crease, back to the bowler. End of an excellent first over"
"back of a length, slanting across to a fourth-stump line. Doesn't come on as quickly as Dhawan wants as he leans back to chop towards point. Ends up inside-edging into the pitch"
"a touch shorter now, Dhawan pokes at it, away from his body, and is beaten by the angle"
length ball slanting into a fifth-stump line. Goes back and across and stabs to backward point
"back of a length, slanting away from off stump, defended towards backward point"
"lovely. Slanted across into the channel once again, this time much fuller than all the previous balls. Not a driving length, though, and Dhawan plays and misses"
"some swing back into Dhawan, and Mathews appeals for lbw after the batsman plays all around it, looking to work it into the leg side. I thought height may have been an issue, but Mathews thinks he has a chance. <b>Sri Lanka have reviewed</b>. No bat for sure, and that's a great review. Pitches on around middle and leg, hits him in line, and ball-tracking says it would have hit the top of middle stump. Dhawan has to walk back. He was caught on the crease there. This is a great start for Sri Lanka."
"length ball outside off, with a hint of away swing. Left alone"
"beauty. This time Rohit has a nibble at it, and he's beaten by late, late movement. Perfect length, and this time the ball was pitched a few inches closer to off stump than the previous one."
"and again, although this time Rohit may have deliberately pulled his bat away from the line of the ball. Pitched just a bit shorter, and gave him a little more time to adjust to the away movement"
"length ball angling into middle and leg, tucked away to the right of midwicket and India finally get some runs on the board. Rohit stepped out of his crease before the bowler released, and slightly across his stumps too"
"full, close to off stump, blocked into the covers"
"back of a length in the corridor, a tiny bit of away movement. Left alone"
"ooh, that's not the best of shots to begin. Stays back to a length ball that nips into him, and he gets a thick inside edge into pad as he tries to work it into the leg side"
"full, at a gentle pace, on off stump. Nice stride forward to drive it back to the bowler"
"fullish on off stump. Pushed towards cover point and he hurries out of his crease, anxious for that first run, and Rohit sends him back"
"back of a length, straightens on a leg-stump line. Iyer had opened up, looking to work it into the leg side, and he had to adjust in the end to defend with the full face"
"and again, opens up with the angle into middle stump, and ends up playing it back to the bowler off the outside half of the bat"
"length ball on off stump, defended to mid-on"
"ooh, Lakmal is bowling brilliantly here. Again that away seam movement in the corridor, and this time some extra bounce too, from just short of a good length. Rohit pokes at it and is beaten - or so umpire Anil Chaudhary thinks. Sri Lanka think there's an edge. <b>They've reviewed again</b>. And again it's a sensational review. A spike on Snicko, near the shoulder of the bat, and that means India are 2 for 2."
"whoa. Pace, bounce, movement, carry. A bit of everything. It's almost like this pitch has quickened up over the course of these two balls. Doesn't seam away this time - maybe a touch of inward movement from just short of a good length. Beats DK for pace as he hops on the crease, zips through between bat and body and Dickwella catches it over shoulder height"
"this time it jags away off the seam in the corridor, and the batsman plays and misses"
"fuller this time, a bit wider with some outswing. DK leaves it alone"
"length ball, sixth-stump line, left alone"
"nicely played. Length ball angling into off stump, and Karthik gets a good stride forward, weight moving into the ball, to defend punchily into the covers"
"length ball on middle stump, clipped towards mid-on"
"back of a length outside off, punched towards mid-off"
"full, angling into off stump. Gets a good stride forward to drive to mid-on"
"length ball outside off, pushes gently to the left of cover point and sets off, but Karthik sends him back"
"strays a touch too straight, only onto middle stump, and Iyer puts it away to get off the mark, a nice, gentle clip to the right of midwicket and it races away for four"
"length ball outside off, slower one, Iyer ignores it"
"ooh, beats the bat again. On the fuller side of a good length, outside off, and Karthik goes for the on-the-up drive through cover. It nips back in, though, and beats his inside edge"
"length ball on off stump, straightens just a touch. Defended into the covers"
"back of a length, not far from off stump at all. Karthik leaves it"
"length ball on middle and off, clipped to midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, defended to short extra-cover"
"back of a length outside off, seams away slightly but also stops on Karthik slightly. Beats his edge as he tries to open his bat face and dab it behind point"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
angles this into off stump and Iyer clips towards mid-on
"length ball angling into off stump. Iyer drives away from his body, with his front shoulder open, and he gets a thick inside edge that runs down to long leg"
"length ball, fairly wide of off stump, left alone"
"surprises Karthik with one that's pitched right up. A near-yorker that swings in to the batsman. Falls over slightly while trying to flick it, playing around his front pad, and that's another big lbw shout. Not given, and this time there's no review. Probably missing leg stump"
"beaten again. This is excellent stuff from Mathews. Goes much wider of the crease and angles this one in, while still pitching a fair way outside off stump. The angle makes him play, and it straightens just a touch to miss his outside edge"
"A touch short, and plenty of width. Frees his arms to stab that to third man"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"beaten again. This one's shortish outside off, and he jabs at it with no feet. Seam movement and bounce take it past his outside edge"
"shuffles down the pitch this time, and across his stumps. Gets close to the line of this back-of-a-length ball outside off and dabs to the left of backward point. Excellent stop there from Gunathilaka, stops the single"
"big lbw shout, and this time Anil Chaudhary raises his finger. Karthik's head falls over again, and he ends up playing outside the line, aiming a drive towards mid-on, as this length ball nips back into him. Consults for a long time with Iyer before deciding to review, and goes over the 15-second limit. Struck in line with middle stump, and ball-tracking says it's clipping the top of leg stump. Lakmal has worked him over brilliantly"
"oh my. He was nowhere near this one. A fourth-stump length ball that leaves him off the pitch, and his back foot was still on leg stump, possibly even sliding away from leg stump, as he poked at this. He likes to stay leg-side of the ball, Pandey, but that sort of technique might not work against Lakmal in this kind of rhythm"
"full outside off, driven to cover"
"full, angling down leg, looks to flick, but it's too wide for that, and Dickwella dives to his left to get a glove to it and possibly save three more runs"
"length ball, pitching on a fifth-stump line and seaming away. Left alone"
"ooh, that's some extravagant movement. Back of a length, wide of the crease, swings in and just sails over the off bail after beating Pandey's inside-edge as he jabs at it. Dickwella has to dive again"
"back of a length, wide of off, stabbed into the point region"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended into the covers"
"inswinger again, pitching just back of a length and tailing in towards middle stump. Clipped to the right of mid-on"
"back of a length, angling down leg, left alone"
"ooh, he's beaten the bat for the 7986th time this morning. Back of a length, straightens along a fourth-stump line, and Pandey's defensive poke is nowhere near the ball"
"back of a length, angling into middle stump, and Pandey plays across it, hopping and looking to work it into the leg side. Stops on him slightly, and the leading edge loops up towards backward point, where Gunathilaka dives forward and to his right and it lands juuust short of him"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"oh man! Lakmal has spotted that Pandey isn't really covering his stumps while leaving the ball, and sends down an offcutter. Pandey leaves, and it sails over off stump. Left that on length, maybe, trusting the bounce"
"back of a length, a fairly easy leave since that was well wide of off stump"
"back of a length, sixth-stump line, opens his bat face to squeeze it down to backward point"
"length ball outside off, Iyer leaves it alone"
"full, close to off stump. A rare overpitched ball. There's still some swing so he can't really go hard at it, just opens his bat face and eases it into the point region"
"nips in from a good length, but this one's missing leg stump. Stuck on the crease, playing across it, is struck on the pad but Pradeep's appeal isn't too confident. Ball-tracking says it would have clipped the top of leg stump, but that would only have meant umpire's call"
"back of a length on off stump, defended towards mid-off"
"back of a length on off stump, defended towards mid-on. Stayed leg-side of the ball there"
"keeps low, and Iyer is so lucky to get some bat on it. Back of a length, comes in slightly towards middle stump, and he's on the crease, playing across it, and the ball just clips some part of his bat and runs away to backward point. If he had missed, he would have been struck plumb in front. The bottom part of his outside edge as the bat came down like a curtain rail"
"back of a length on the pads, tucked away to long leg"
"length ball on off stump, defended uncertainly towards midwicket. More a bottom-hand chop than anything"
"back of a length, some movement in towards off stump. Looks to stand up and punch into the covers. Gets a thick inside edge that runs away between his legs and through backward square leg"
"fuller, wider outside off, left alone"
"gone! Wicket No. 3 for Lakmal. Again, Pandey's feet remain stuck on the crease, stuck on leg stump, and his bat comes down from gully towards midwicket. It's a good-length ball on off stump, he plays across it, and only manages a thick outside edge into first slip's lap"
takes a forward step to negate the swing. Hit on the thigh pad as he misses a flick.
"overpitched delivery outside off, 137 kph, not much swing, driven back towards the bowler"
"bowled 'im. Chopped on. Did that swing back? The scoreline makes Iyer think of a cut that he normally wouldn't play. Firstly, it was fuller than a good length. Secondly, it wasn't wide, more towards the sixth stump. And so the cut was always going to be the wrong shot. He is hesitant mentally too. And so the ball takes the inside edge and uproots off stump. Simply put, that was a bad choice of shot."
"138 kph, full outside off, takes the withdrawing bat of Pandya. There is just so much tentativeness."
"136 kph, good length around off, defended."
"full and wide outside off, good option. Pandya chooses to leave this one"
"straight to gully, but there is no man there. Full outside off, Pandya drives with bat well away from pad. He gets a thick outside edge which races away"
"drifts on the pads, Dhoni again misses a simple flick. He will get one leg bye down to fine leg"
"full around off, defended back confidently"
"seam movement. Goes back of a length, wide of the crease and gets the ball to jag away to beat the tentative prod"
"slightly overpitched and that's a confident drive. Nothing exuberant. Saw a gap, got a ball that was in the slot and punched the ball through cover"
"drags that length back. Shortish outside off, leaves Pandya again, beaten on the outside edge. Dickwella appeals, but seemed like he missed the bat by quite a bit"
"lovely shot. Lots of width, short and wide, and Pandya nails a square cut towards backward point. Gunathilaka throws himself to his right to stop the boundary, he's a fantastic fielder"
"good length on middle and leg, a thick inside edge towards backward square leg"
"there's that hesitation again. Good length outside off, Pandya shuffles slightly across, but it's that perfect length and the line makes it harder. Fuller than good length, ideal. A couple of stumps outside off, ideal. Pandya tries to withdraw his bat late, the ball kisses the outside edge as he tries to take his bat away, but the ball travels straight to a wide slip. India in disarray"
"outside edge, but falls down. Full delivery outside off, Bhuvneshwar gets a thick edge that goes to second slip"
"a big appeal. No says umpire Fry. <strong>Thisara reviews</strong>. Fullish length on leg, the ball grazes the pad first, then hits the bat, then hits the pad again. Two reds, but umpire's call on height as the ball clips the top of leg. That looked a good review, until orange came up."
"full and wide outside off, left alone"
"wheeee, wow, that's fantastic carry and bounce. Full delivery outside off, some away shape, left alone, but the ball keeps climbing. Dickwella takes it well over his head"
"133 kph, comes down and inside-edges the ball onto his pad. An optimistic appeal"
"seam movement. Back of a length outside off, the ball jags back in to hit Dhoni on the body. He's been hit so often already."
comes down again and shovels a flick to deep square leg. Almost fell over that too
"edged and gone. India are in tatters. Full delivery around off, not much Bhuvneshwar could do about that. Plays the line, covers the stumps, but the ball takes the outside edge and carries to the keeper. Just a bit of away shape"
"back of a length on off stump, defended into the point region"
"length ball slanting away from off stump, left alone"
"back of a length, straightens towards off stump, defended back down the pitch"
"back of a length, a bit of away swing in the corridor, Dhoni leaves it alone"
"down the track to the length ball outside off, squeezed away with a turn of the wrists into the covers"
"shortish, angling into leg stump. Dhoni looks to work it into the leg side but it sneaks past his inside edge and hits his thigh pad"
"back of a length, some nip back in towards off and middle, defended towards mid-on"
"back of a length, close to off stump, defended back towards the bowler"
"back of a length, slanting across the left-hander initially before seaming back in just a touch. Kuldeep leaves, and that is centimeters away from the top of off stump"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"back of a length, angling in to the corridor. Pokes at it, away from his body, and dabs it towards the slips with an open face"
"shortish, angling into off stump, gets on top of the bounce and defends into the on side"
"back of a length, slanting across into the corridor, opens his bat face to steer it to third man. <b>Dhoni refuses the single</b>."
"finishes with a big lbw appeal, but he knows that's angling down leg. Very full, nearly a yorker, and Kuldeep has to play around his front pad to connect with that flick, and misses. Lakmal ends with 10-4-13-4."
"down the track to a back-of-a-length ball from Pradeep, crunches it into the covers"
"back of a length, angling down leg, and India don't take the leg-bye after Dhoni misses the flick. The ball rolls down to long leg but Dhoni sends Kuldeep back"
"down the track again, and ow there's a big lbw appeal. Not given, and <b>Sri Lanka have reviewed</b>. Was Dhoni more than 3m from the stumps at the point of impact? Played across that, as it seamed back into him. Hits him on the knee roll. Pitches outside off, impact just in line of off stump, and it's umpire's call on impact, clipping the top of the bails"
"shortish, close to off stump, punched back to the bowler"
"length ball close to off stump. Stuck on the crease, jabs at it with just his hands to push into the covers. Thick inside edge into back pad"
"down the track again and Pradeep bangs it in, short, outside off. Swings hard at it, possibly looking for the swat wide of mid-on, but can't connect"
"length ball slanting across to middle stump, defended into the on side"
"back of a length close to off stump. Punches away from his body with an angled bat, and <b>inside-edges it past his leg stump</b>"
"shot! Down the track and converts a short ball into a length ball. A good amount of width too, and he flat-bats that powerfully between extra-cover and mid-off"
"short, rising ball in the corridor. Lifts his bat high over his head to leave it"
"back of a length on off stump. Looks for the angled-bat punch into the covers, inside-edges into his pads. The ball rolls into the covers and they sneak a single"
"fullish on middle stump, defended to midwicket"
"shortish outside off, nice use of the wrists on top of the bounce to force that to sweeper cover. Refuses another single"
"back of a length close to off stump, clips it to deep midwicket, looks for two, but the fielder moves in quickly and keeps it down to one. The throw from the fielder, Gunaratne, is horrifically inaccurate, ends up hitting the umpire whi's moved into a square-on position to keep an eye on the crease"
"on the pads, and that's beautifully timed. Just a straight-bat push with a turn of the wrists at the end to clip it to the left of midwicket"
"full, angling across to off stump, defended into the covers"
"ooh, and he edges it wide of second slip! Full, angling into off stump, and Kuldeep plays for the angle, looking towards midwicket, and it straightens slightly to take the outside edge"
"bouncer close to off stump, Kuldeep sways away from it"
"oh my. Down the track again comes Dhoni, looking to make some room and slap through or over the covers. The ball doesn't quite come on, he loses his shape while going too hard at it, too early, and the inside-edge flashes past leg stump"
"short, a bit of width, Dhoni slashes and misses"
"down the track and Thisara reacts with a bouncer. Gets it up to shoulder height, and he manages to control a pull down to long leg"
"back of a length on off stump. Stopped on him slightly. Wanted to punch into the covers, ends up hitting it back towards the bowler"
"back of a length on off stump, opens his bat face and uses the angle to guide it down to third man. Brings up India's 50"
"back of a length, some seam movement in towards off stump. Dhoni looks to punch into the covers, inside-edges it into his back leg, and the ball threatens to roll back towards his stumps momentarily before coming to a stop"
"fullish, angling into off stump. Kuldeep plays for the angle, and the ball seams away slightly. The edge rolls away to the left of gully"
"short, rising towards Dhoni's chest. Pulls it fine, off glove rather than bat, and long leg, sliding to his right, can't quite keep it from rolling past the rope. India have gone past their lowest total"
"down the track to the shortish ball from Pradeep, straightens towards off stump and he defends it back down the pitch"
"back of a length, close to off stump, lets it come on and uses his wrists to work it to deep midwicket"
"back of a length, angling in from round the wicket, defended from the crease"
"overpitched outside off, and Kuldeep meets it with an open bat face to send it racing away to the point boundary. Superb timing again"
"short, wide, Dhoni loves that. Flashes a cut, deliberately in the air, over backward point and a little bit to his left"
back of a length close to off stump. Big back-and-across shuffle to defend into the covers
"back of a length, close to off stump, tucked away through square leg"
"length ball, sticks on the pitch slightly and seams into the left-hander. Wanted to work it through midwicket, the ball missed his inside edge and hit high on his pad"
"back of a length, too straight. Tucked neatly off the thigh pad, and beats fine leg throwing himself desperately to his left"
"length ball outside off, nice stride forward to defend into the point region"
"tossed up on off stump, clipped gently to deep midwicket"
"nicely flighted offbreak on off stump, defended into the covers with soft hands"
"past the outside edge this time, and Dickwella is excited. Has the bails off in a flash and immediately bursts out in appeal. Dangled up a bit wider, and Kuldeep stretches out to defend. Beaten by dip and turn, and is his toe on the line? I think it is! Looks like spin has given Sri Lanka the breakthrough. Beautiful offspinner's dismissal"
dip again as he stretches out to defend. Thick inside edge flies to the right of short leg
"back and across to the legbreak, a touch on the short side, and defends with soft hands"
"another legbreak - attempted legbreak, at any rate, since it didn't really turn. Again a touch short and it gives Bumrah plenty of time to get on the back foot to defend"
"Dhoni attempts another big hit, and Dhoni inside-edges again past his leg stump. A full-toss from Thisara, he clears his front leg and slogs, and that edge wasn't far from leg stump at all"
"short outside off, pulled to deep midwicket, and he doesn't take the single"
back of a length close to off stump. Down the pitch to punch to mid-off
"oh man. Another inside edge. Back of a length outside off, some inward seam, and he goes for the angled-bat punch again. Thick inside edge onto back pad"
"length ball close to off stump. Stays in the crease and pushes to the left of cover, who moves alertly to cut off the single"
"full outside off. Dhoni thrusts his front foot out, and his leg comes in the way of his bat as he looks to push into the covers. Ball his his leg and rolls down to third man. Lbw appeal, but he was struck well outside the line"
"floated up down the leg side, clipped to short fine leg"
"down the track, gets to the pitch of this middle-stump ball, and flicks this to the forward square leg boundary"
"back of a length, turning into the pads, goes back to whip it to deep backward square leg. Doesn't take the single"
"full outside off, and was that the wrong'un? Played for the legbreak, reaching out with his hands to push into the covers, and ended up inside-edging into the leg side"
"full on the pads, clipped to deep backward square leg"
tossed up on leg stump. Bumrah defends after taking a long stride towards the ball
"back of a length on off stump, clipped into the midwicket region and he doesn't bother taking the single"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"fuller now, still outside off, Dhoni leaves again"
"back of a length outside off, punched to sweeper cover. Still no single"
"full outside off, driven crisply and short extra cover dives, gets a hand to it, and deflects it towards cover point, who had come in off the boundary to save the single"
"length ball wide of off. Dhoni is caught halfway between playing and leaving, and ends up getting a thick edge that rolls down to slip"
"legbreak, ends up as a thigh-high full-toss on leg stump. Defended back to the bowler"
"tossed-up offbreak wide of off, opens his bat face to push to backward point"
"dangled up outside off, blocked into the covers"
"googly, goes back and across, looking to defend. I don't know if he picked it out of the hand, but it pitched short enough for him to go back and adjust and work it into the on side"
"flatter, angling across to off stump. Looks like the offbreak that didn't turn. Goes back and across to defend"
"tossed up outside off, ends up too full as he stretches out and blocks"
"flat, angling into middle and leg, stretches out to defend back to the bowler"
"down the track to the leg-stump ball, swiped hard, along the ground, to long-on. Refuses the single"
"short outside off, slapped away past the left hand of short extra-cover, and beats the diving fielder at sweeper cover as well"
"flat and quick, back of a length on off stump. Blocked into the off side"
"quickish length ball outside off, presses forward to stab into the covers"
"fullish on off stump, and he stretches out and jabs down the ground to long-off, beating the diving extra-cover fielder to his right"
"goes back to a length ball on middle and off, defends into the covers. Legbreak, only just straightened"
"tossed up on middle and leg, driven to long-on"
"shortish on off stump, rocks back and makes room to punch. Hits it hard into the ground and short extra does well to stretch overhead and stop the ball"
"down the track, looking for the inside-out drive. Gets too close to the pitch of the ball and squeezes it down to mid-off"
"full on leg stump, driven inside-out to mid-off"
"and Dhoni manages to keep the strike. Tossed up full, and he clears his front leg and drills it hard, down the ground. Mid-off stops it with a dive to his right, but deflects the ball a few feet away from him, and Dhoni pounces on the chance to hurry through to the other end"
"tossed up on middle stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"down the track and Pathirana fires it into his legs, denying him swinging room. Goes for the big hit again, and ends up dragging the ball out to deep backward square leg"
"back of a length, pushed through towards off stump, makes some room and chops to backward point"
"back of a length on off stump, makes room and slaps to extra-cover, who misfields and allows the single"
"full on off stump, big stretch forward to defend into the on side"
"goes back and across to one that slides on with the arm from wide of the crease. Slides past the inside edge and hits his back pad, and the umpire gives it out. <b>India have reviewed this</b>. Did it strike him outside the line? He moved a fair way across to it. Struck him a long way outside off stump. Not the greatest decision in the first place from Anil Chaudhary."
"tossed up on middle stump, driven to mid-off"
"back of a length outside off, chopped into the point region"
"back of a length on middle and off, makes room to punch to sweeper cover"
"nicely flighted legbreak, pitching on leg stump and turning towards middle. Dhoni at full stretch to defend into the off side"
"full on leg stump, clipped to midwicket"
"and that fielder prevents the single. Again it's flighted and very full, and Dhoni clips to mid-on"
"full on middle stump, blocked to short extra-cover"
"length ball angling towards leg stump. Bumrah stretches out, playing for turn, and there isn't any. Inside-edges towards backward square leg"
"bowled him! Pathirana has struck, finally. Tossed up much slower, and Bumrah has a go at this. He's been defending stoutly, but that bit of extra flight drew the mistake from him. Slogged across the line and the ball skidded on to hit middle and leg stump"
"another slider to greet Chahal. Good length too, and he defends with bat and pad close together. Miss that, and he's  lbw for sure"
"length ball outside off, defended into the covers"
"length ball on off stump, defended to cover point"
"what a shot that is! It's a back-of-a-length ball, just outside off stump, and he just stands tall and punches it over mid-off, and it carries all the way over the rope"
"back of a length, angling into off stump, clipped to wide mid-on"
"back of a length outside off, steered to the right of third man. Knew it wasn't far enough from the fielder to get him two runs, so he refused the single"
"shortish, close to off stump. Shuffles across to work it to the left of backward square leg. Doesn't take the single again"
"full-toss on off stump, driven firmly and into the gap to the left of extra-cover. Easily beats the sweeper running to his right as well, and it brings up a superb half-century. His 67th."
Nope. A length ball on the pads. Bad ball to bowl given where his deep fielders were. Tucks it away to long leg and trots to the other end
"shortish, angling into off and middle. Opens up and looks to pull. Ends up hitting it early and hits it flat, on the bounce, to long-on"
"full now, on off stump. Drives towards long-off, but the bowler dives left to intercept"
"down the track, and that's outta here. Moved away from the stumps as he stepped out, to make himself hitting room. He knows Pathirana tends to angle it into the stumps and that he doesn't usually turn the ball much. Guesses right, and it's right in his slot for a huge hit over wide long-on"
"full on leg and middle, and he hammers a fierce, flat hit down the ground, almost hitting Chahal on the helmet at the other end. Bounces down to long-on. One of the most violently-hit dot balls of all time"
"shortish and wide. Looks for the late cut, but it keeps a little low, and he bottom-edges into the pitch"
"fired in flat and full, outside off. Wanted to be even fuller to deny hitting room, but he succeeds in keeping Dhoni off strike for the next over - small comforts. Driven fiercely, with a lot of bottom hand, to the left of mid-on"
"full, angling into off stump, defended solidly, back to the bowler"
"back of a length on off stump, defended towards point"
"bouncer over middle stump, and Chahal leaves that like a top-order batsman, keeping his eye on the ball all the way and swaying his upper body away from the line. Sensational"
"length ball, fifth-stump line, left alone"
"yorker outside off. Looks to open his bat face and squeeze it towards point, the ball sneaks between bat and body"
"full, sixth-stump line, left alone. Disappointing end to a good spell from Pradeep - he should have really made Chahal play more"
"short and wide to start, and Dhoni puts it away clinically, finding the gap between backward point and third man with a back-cut"
"length ball outside off, and it's all over. Goes for the big hit, has to reach out, and ends up slicing it straight to the sweeper on the cover boundary. I think he wanted to hit it over mid-off"
"length ball swinging away from the left-hander, towards off stump. Gets nicely behind it to defend towards mid-off"
"back of a length outside off, opens his bat face to stab to backward point"
"ooh. Again the one that swings away from the left-hander, from a very tight middle-and-off line. He's forced to play at it, but Gunathilaka does well to play with soft hands, and the thick edge rolls along the floor to third man"
"full on off stump, eased to mid-off"
"ooh, draws the mistake. Floats one wider outside off, makes Tharanga reach away from his body to drive. Thick edge, but safely wide of the two slips and down to third man. A gully might have swallowed that up"
"ooh, beauty. Good length, angling across into the corridor, and it leaves Gunathilaka to beat his drive. Bhuvneshwar has the other one too, which swings into the left-hander, but every ball in this over has swung away from them"
"back of a length, angling across the left-hander's body. Tharanga opened up here, bat coming down pointing towards midwicket as he looked to defend from the crease. The angle and extra bounce found the leading edge that popped a soft distance into the off side"
"lbw appeal as Tharanga plays across a slightly fuller one. Pitched well outside leg stump, though"
"back of a length in the corridor. A hesitant poke and the edge drops into the gap between second slip and gully. Gully dives right to possibly save four runs. Karthik the fielder, I think"
"ah, lovely. Fullish length, slanting away from off stump. Not much of a stride forward to drive, and the ball beats his edge comfortably"
"and again. Similar delivery, a similar shot, without too much of a stride forward, and a similar result"
"back pf a length, at the body. Looks to work it into the leg side and misses, hits him on the hip"
"back of a length, close to off stump, and again Tharanga is opened up. Playing from the crease, against the angle, looking to defend into the on side, and a bit of away movement beats his outside edge"
"length ball close to off stump, defended to short extra-cover"
"oh man. Lovely length in the corridor, and this is just the angle away, not necessarily any movement to accentuate it. No feet from Tharanga, just pushes at it with his hands and gets nowhere near it"
"fuller, and this time some width. Frees his arms and flays the drive away to the left of backward point"
"back of a length outside off, pokes and misses. The ball stops slightly on him, and keeps a bit low. Bounces just short of Dhoni's gloves"
"Wow. That's a really good ball. Back of a length, swinging across the stumps, and Tharanga pokes and misses"
length ball angling towards middle stump. Gunathilaka misses the flick and Bumrah lets out a feeble lbw appeal. He knew it pitched outside leg
"beats the bat again. Slants it across the left-hander, pitches it on a good length, and Gunathilaka goes for the big hit over mid-on and misses by a long way"
"back of a length, too close to off stump to punch through the covers. Stops on him slightly too, and he ends up jabbing it to mid-off off the inside half of the bat"
"gone. Why exactly is he slogging in a chase of 113? Again, Bumrah simply slants one across him, pitching on a good length and getting a little hint of away movement. Gunathilaka clears his front leg, exposes his stumps, and goes for a massive heave, and only manages a thin nick through to Dhoni"
"and he immediately demonstrates to Sri Lanka the option they had forgotten for the last few overs. A probing length ball in the corridor, and he trusts the angle away from him and leaves it alone"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended into the covers"
"length ball angling away from off stump, left alone"
"full outside off, and Tharanga will time those away all day. Nice flow of the hands through the ball, a slightly open face, and the ball races away to the right of cover point"
"and he responds by beating his edge again. Swings it away from the left-hander, and he had to play at it since it left him from a middle-and-off line. No feet, and the ball beats his outside edge"
"full, on the stumps, jabbed towards midwicket"
"back of a length, swerving across the left-hander. Started on about leg stump and he looked to open up and play through the leg side initially. Then had to adjust to the swing and push towards mid-off"
"back of a length close to off stump. Pokes at it without getting his back foot across, and a thickish edge rolls down to third man"
"back of a length, well down the leg side. Can't put bat on that leg glance"
"ooh, beaten again. Back of a length, slanting across, Tharanga is opened up by the angle as he pokes at it"
"back of a length again, this time a horizontal-bat poke and miss"
"this one slants a bit wider outside off, and Tharanga leaves it comfortably"
"short now, a bit of width, slapped to backward point"
"back of a length down the leg side. Way down the leg side, and Dhoni has to move quickly to his right to collect it"
"now he lands one on the perfect spot, opens up Tharanga, and finds the edge to gully, where Dinesh Karthik takes a simple knee-high catch. Beautifully bowled. He's done almost everything right, <b>except he's also overstepped</b>. Back of a length, pitching on middle stump and nipping away to accentuate the angle across. Opened up, nicks to gully, and saved by an errant front foot"
"The yorker, and Tharanga hurriedly gets his feet out of the way to try and flick. Manages only to squeeze it between his legs and past leg stump to the fine leg boundary"
"very full once more, squeezed out to backward point"
"bowled him! Back of a length, slanting across, but this one comes back into Thirimanne. Caught on the crease again, shuffling across but not going forward or back. Bat comes down at an angle, and he chops it back onto his stumps. They're checking for no-ball once again, and this is hilarious. From one angle, his front heel is hidden behind the non-striker's bat, and from the other it's hidden behind the midwicket fielder. The stump-cam angle was inconclusive too, with the heel landing extremely close to the back of the line - whether behind it or on top of it was hard to tell - and given the evidence he had, the third umpire had to send the batsman on his way"
"fullish outside off. Blocked back towards the bowler, with hands doing way more of the work than his feet. Didn't really go forward to it at all"
"back of a length outside off, the outswinger. Left alone"
"fuller now, again the outswinger. Starts wide enough for Mathews to leave comfortably"
"wide-ish yorker, swinging away. Mathews jabs at it and misses"
length ball swerving away from a fifth-stump line. Left alone
"ooh. Fullish, slanting across the left-hander. Pitched on around middle and off and left him. Tharanga left it alone, without moving forward to it, and it didn't seem to miss off stump by much"
"back of a length on middle stump, defended into the on side"
"back of a length, on the pads, tucked away to deep square leg"
"shortish, some width too. Mathews slashes and misses"
"ooh. Back of a length in the corridor, and some away seam movement and bounce. Mathews pulls his bat inside the line to leave"
"back of a length on off stump, defended into the point region"
"shortish, lots of width, just stands tall and frees his arms to slap that to the left of backward point"
"length ball on middle stump, and Tharanga is slightly early on this flick. Goes through with it and ends up timing it well, an airborne flick well over midwicket's head"
"on the pads now, tucked away through square leg"
"back of a length on off stump, uses the angle to tuck it away through backward square leg"
"back of a length on off stump, defended into the point region"
"beaten, this time on the inside. Back of a length outside off, and some inward seam movement to go past the inside edge as Mathews, without moving his feet, defends away from his body"
"length ball angling across to middle stump. Opened up, wanted to flick first, and then he adjusted to poke into the covers. Another no-ball, this time because Bumrah's back foot kicked the stumps at his end. The Steven Finn no-ball"
"And again, for the second time, he squeezes a free-hit yorker to the fine-leg boundary. Misses the flick, and the ball hits his back leg and runs away past the keeper diving to his right"
"full on leg stump, clipped to midwicket"
"back of a length on the pads, tucked away to long leg"
"back of a length close to off stump, opens his bat face to steer it down to third man"
"length ball on middle and leg, clipped to midwicket"
"fullish on off stump, and that's typical Tharanga timing again. Just eases it to the right of mid-off and it speeds to the boundary at a speed disproportionate to the effort he seemed to expend while playing the shot"
"back of a length outside off, defended square on the off side"
"full outside off, driven to mid-off"
"back of a length outside off, lets it come on and stabs it to third man"
"oh man, what a beauty of a shot. Width, and you don't give him that. It's a good-length ball, though, and he has to reach out a long way away from his body, so to do that and still control it and send it racing through extra-cover takes a special kind of hand-eye coordination"
"full, angling in towards off stump, and this is a lot more orthodox, with the same result. A straighter bat, a higher elbow, and it again races into the wide-open spaces to the right of mid-off"
"full, down leg, Dhoni is sprawled on the ground after diving in vain to his right in an attempt to stop that wide from turning into five wides"
"length ball close to off stump, driven to mid-off"
"back of a length on off stump, tucked to the right of midwicket"
"back of a length, nipping away from an off-stump line. Opens up Tharanga and beats his hard-hands jab"
"back of a length on middle stump, uses his wrists to tuck it to long leg"
"ooh, keeps low. Back of a length, and Mathews is just shuffling across to defend as this nips back in and squats a little low. Beats his inside edge and bounces short of Dhoni"
"length ball close to off stump, moves across his stumps to tuck it into the square-leg region"
"edged, and it falls short of Dhawan at first slip. Again those hard Tharanga hands and those immobile Tharanga feet. Jabs at this back-of-a-length ball, gets a thick edge, but it doesn't carry"
"another wide. Length ball, a bit of swing, but only swings down the leg side"
"shortish, on off stump, and he opens up quickly and swivels through a pull that runs away wide of mid-on"
"length ball wide of off stump, left alone"
"Edged, and this time it carries to first slip, and Dhawan holds on, just about. Length ball close to off stump, Tharanga looks to drive on the up, and only manages a thick edge that goes to first slip at around thigh height. Spills out of Dhawan's hands first time, and he clutches on on the second attempt"
"full, swings in towards middle stump, clipped to long leg"
"some swing away from the fifth-stump channel, and Mathews leaves it alone"
"back of a length wide of off, left alone"
"back of a length, swings back into Dickwella to cramp the left-hander. Hops in the air to defend into the off side"
"ooh, some extra bounce. Slants it across the left-hander, pitching just back of a length, and beats his outside edge by a big margin as he looks to rise on his toes and defend"
"back of a length on off stump, defended back down the pitch"
"back of a length, pitching outside leg, and it hits the pads as he tries to work it into the leg side"
"shot. Length ball on off stump, and he just clears his front leg and flicks it up and over midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, and he shuffles across almost premeditatedly to tuck it into the square-leg region and immediately call for two. Smart batting"
"full, some width, slapped to backward point"
"full outside off, driven to mid-off"
"fullish, angling into middle and leg, clipped to square leg"
"back of a length close to off stump, lets it come on and dabs to backward point"
"in the blockhole, close to off stump, jabbed to mid-off"
"overpitched on off stump, and Mathews puts it away beautifully, ends up with left elbow high as he punches this between the umpire and the non-striker"
"128 kph, that angle again, good length around middle and leg, the ball seams away to beat the bat"
"on a length around off, 133 kph, a thick outside edge down to third man. That gully area could be a hot-spot in South Africa"
"rolls his wrists on that. A bouncer around off, he saw it early, kept his eyes on it and nailed his pull through square leg"
"hurries Mathews for pace. Short down leg, Mathews is a tad late on his pull. Beaten"
"138 kph, in the gap again. SL are hurrying away with it. Good length outside off, Mathews' weight is on the back foot and still manages to bunt a drive through cover for four. Fabulous timing"
"beats him on the outside edge this time. Good length outside off, Mathews plays for the line"
"just wide of the bowler in his follow-through. Full delivery outside off, mis-timed drive evades Pandya to his right"
"on a length on leg, 137 kph, nudged down to fine leg for a run"
"132 kph, shortish and wide, slashed towards point"
"132 kph, too short, too wide. Dickwella forces a cut to cover, met the ball too early. A bit later and he would have found the gap through point"
"133 kph, nice channel, around off, cut towards point"
"inside-edged past the keeper for four. Good length and wide outside off, Dickwella plays a cut, probably too close to his body. Evades Dhoni to his right"
"134 kph, fullish delivery around off, defended watchfully"
"128 kph, punched towards cover from the back foot"
"fullish length again, Mathews is perched on the back foot as he blocks"
"129 kph, on the pads this time, worked towards Kuldeep at mid-on"
"naughty from Bhuvi. Good length, but very wide outside off. Mathews cuts towards third man, where Bhuvneshwar runs to his right, gets there but the ball goes through his legs"
"fullish delivery outside off, skewed off the outside half"
"on a length around middle and leg, pushed to mid-on"
"a slower delivery outside off, driven elegantly to cover"
"lovely timing. Slightly short on middle and leg, Dickwella picks the length early, goes back and swats a pull through backward square leg"
"a bouncer down leg, Dickwella backs away and under-edges a cut to third man. Ungainly"
"full outside off, 133 kph, left alone"
"on a length outside off, defended into the cover region."
"oh my, what a shot that is. Length ball, but a lot of width, and Dickwella just frees his arms and launches that up and over the cover point region - almost carries all the way"
"fuller, on off stump this time, and now Dickwella goes over the leg side. Opens up slightly at the hips and whips it over wide mid-on"
"length ball on middle and leg, shuffles across and clips to midwicket"
"ah, good ball. He's taken a bit of a beating in this over but produces one very good ball in the corridor, just short of a good length, slanting away, and he beats the outside edge as Dickwella shuffles across and looks to dab it behind point"
"and then a wide. Full, well down the leg side, Dickwella can't connect with the flick"
"back of a length close to off stump, dabbed towards backward point"
"back of a length on off stump, defended into the covers. It's almost like he wants to leave the winning hit for Mathews"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"back of a length outside off, Mathews punches to mid-off"
"down the track, making himself some room. Bhuvneshwar spots it and bowls a wide length ball, making him reach for it. Tries to smack it over cover but can't put bat to ball"
"back of a length down leg, Mathews can't connect with the leg glance"
"full outside off, and Mathews finishes stylishly, driving with a high left elbow and finding the gap to the right of mid-off"
