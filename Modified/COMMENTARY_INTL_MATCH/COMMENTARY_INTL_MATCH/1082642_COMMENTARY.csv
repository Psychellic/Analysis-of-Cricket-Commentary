"much fuller and on off stump, defended to cover"
"good length and swerves in on middle, hangs back and inside-edges it to midwicket. Possibly an offcutter"
"<b>It's that man: Ben Stokes, again</b>. He nails a direct hit and celebrates. Good length and angling away outside off, Nair opens the bat-face, and simply steers the ball towards backward point. Stokes moves swiftly to his left, collects the ball, and throws the stumps down at the striker's end. There wasn't a run there, and Daredevils paid the price, losing Samson. He wasn't in the frame. That was how bad it was"

"hit straight to Ben Stokes at backward point. Iyer and Nair stay put. Back of a length and outside off, punched with an open face to point"
"Iyer has nicked off. Seam-up. Back of a length and angling away outside off from over the wicket. This bounces more than Iyer had anticipated. He has a loose slash at it away from the body, and watches the ball settle into the gloves of Dhoni"
"back of a length and kicks up outside off, Pant looses his grip and fends it off to cover"
"extra bounce, again! Jumps from a length outside off, Pant opens the face and glides it gently to point. Gets off the mark"
"looks like an offcutter, 119ks, opens the face and steers it behind point"
"another slower cutter. Back of a length and just outside off, cramps him for room. Pant aims a cut and ends up chopping the ball to cover"
"seam-up. Short of a length and outside off, Pant rises with it and punches it straight to point. Another fine over from Unadkat"
"pushed through on off, even before Sundar delivered, Nair stepped across off, went low and swept it firmly in the air between square leg and short fine leg. The man in the deep is at midwicket"
"fired fuller on off, Nair goes across off again, he would have been plumb lbw had he missed it. It was too full for the sweep, but Nair managed to get some bat  and guide it to short fine leg"

"tossed-up offbreak, sticks in the surface. Spins in and bounces, chipped in the air to the left of Rahane at midwicket"
"pushed through flatter and quicker, defended on the back foot"
"hit flat and hard for a six. This was a poor ball, though. Hip-high short ball on off stump or just outside off, Pant sits back and smites a pull over square leg. Bang! Hit it squarer as midwicket as sent back. Washington leaks 15 from his first over."
"shortish and outside off, gets up on his tippy toes, uses the pace of Stokes to his advantage and steers it between short third man and backward point"
"short of a length, the batsman shuffles across, aims to scoop it fine of short fine leg. Does not make contact. Grazes the thigh and rolls to leg"

"front-foot pull over midwicket. Crackling strike. Back of a length on middle, hip-high ball, swatted over midwicket"
"Nair stays leg side of the ball and chips it over mid-on. Three fielders converge on the ball, but can't stop it from rolling away to the boundary. <strong>No boundaries in the first three overs. Six boundaries in the next two overs</strong>. Not surprising that it's coming from Daredevils. This might have been the slower ball"
"overpitched and outside off, stretches forward and belts it straight down the ground, between Thakur and Nair"
"leg-side ball, can't bowl on the hips with fine leg inside the circle. Pant simply helps it away fine of the fielder. The boundaries are flowing for Daredevils"

"slower short ball outside off, dragged away between deep square leg and deep midwicket. Time out. Pune need to regroup"

"Dhoni, you beauty. Plucks it out of thin air. Nonchalantly done. Samuels backs away outside leg. Christian bangs a chest-high short ball outside off. Samuels dares to hook. He can only top-edge it. Dhoni times his jump to perfection, stretches his right hand, and takes it like a boss. Credit to Christian too for the change of line and length"

"Dhoni collects the ball and swipes the bails off swiftly. He is very confident. The TV umpire has been called in. The foot is in the air when Dhoni, the cool cat, swipes the bails off. Anderson has to exit. This was tossed up outside off and spinning away further, dragged Anderson forward. He loses his balance, and can't recover in time. Lovely flight and dip from Sundar - he isn't used to it in the Powerplay"

"slower offcutter, short and outside off, the batsman does not pick it and ends up deflecting it to square leg"

"short offcutter outside off, Mishra runs down the track, adjusts and fore-hands it over the long-off boundary. Six"

"wide of the crease, slower offcutter at 113ks, Nair pre-meditated, shuffled across off but missed the scoop. He did not pick the change up this time"
"Short fine leg runs back and across. He tumbles to his right and tracks down this skier. Excellent catch from Unadkat. Back of a length on middle, Nair wants to swing it over midwicket. He can only send a top edge swirling to Unadkat"
"really full on leg stump, off the pad and rolls to square leg. <strong>Just three off the penultimate over</strong>. Gold"
"wide of the crease, angled in on middle, dabbed to point"
"looks like slower offcutter, bounces over middle, as the batsman slogs early and does not make contact"
"another slower ball outside off, Shami is already through with his leg-side mow. Beaten"
"slower offcutter, on a length on off, Shami looks to belt this down the ground. He only sends a top edge in the air. Sundar runs back and across to his right but the ball swirls further away from him"
"You just can't keep Ben Stokes out of the action. He pulls off an incredible hokey-pokey catch. Length and outside off, Shami clubs it across the line. The ball seemed destined to sail over the boundary.... until Stokes took flight at the edge of the deep midwicket boundary. He leaps, plucks the ball, but the momentum carries him over the boundary. He is wary of it and hence tosses the ball back into the field of play. He jumps back into the field of play and claims a catch. Special catch. Take a bow, Stokes. Great strength of the body and great presence of mind"
"slower offcutter, full on off, Mishra attempts a reverse and skies it over Washington at short third man"
"what a beauty. That is sensational. Remember Zaheer swinging deliveries back in through the gate? He's back. Full, straight, moving back in and it goes through the defense of one of India's best Test batsmen. Started early and kept going back. Zaheer has a wide smile, why not? Rahane brought his bat down on that too late. Middle stump is uprooted."
"Smith jumps across and this one <b>swings back prodigiously</b>, drifts down leg"
"good length around off, not as much swing. Steven Smith blocks into the off side"
"there he goes. One of the best batsman in the world currently. His form is on show. Best, according to me. Leans back, lets the ball come to him and then drills a square drive even though his weight was on the back foot"
"yikes, don't bowl there, but he is bowling to his field. There is deep square leg and fine leg so Zaheer is straight. Smith will clip him away day and night. Deep square leg fields"
"134 kph, oh nice timing. Full, straight, moving back in. Tripathi flicks him away through midwicket for another boundary. Found the gap through midwicket and mid-on. Didn't fall over, an indicator <b>of good balance and a steady head</b>"
"slower offcutter on off, defended towards point"
"don't bowl there. Good length on Smith's pads, flicked through backward square leg for a couple more"
"better lines. That's actually a terrific delivery. Back of a length, seaming back in towards off. Played awkwardly down to fine leg"
"fullish delivery outside off, hit away towards cover. Anderson, who is at short cover, cuts off that angle with a dive to his right. A fumble allows them"
"a slower delivery outside off, fifth-stump line. Steven Smith stands still this time, gets the ball in his arc and boom, the ball flies through cover. Delectable"
"140 kph, good length on off, Smith misses a pull. Struck on the thigh via the inside edge. Probably not short enough to pull, but he's hit them before"
"excellent finish. The genuine bouncer, short on off. Smith watches this go by"
"127 kph, a short slower ball on leg. That may just be Zaheer's pace. Pulled awkwardly to square leg"
"short delivery, swinging back in. Flicked to midwicket"
"135 kph, moves his feet inside the line to create just enough room. Good length outside off, pushed to cover. Only two batsmen in the world currently do this to devastating effect - Steven Smith and David Warner"
"back of a length down leg, flicked away to fine leg."
"134 kph, that's a slog. Bends his knees, stays low and tries to thwack this over midwicket. Skewed off the inside half to deep square leg"
"fantastic fielding. He saves five. Shreyas Iyer. <b>That is tremendous work</b>. Back of a length down leg, Smith pulls. Doesn't quite get enough. Shreyas Iyer never gives up, runs to his right, leaps in the air, sticks out his right hand, catches the ball but in the fraction of a second between when he is in the air and he's about to land, he decides to save five and lob it back towards fine leg. The fine leg fielder cleans up, but if he was a tad bit more aware, that may have been a catch. That is essentially a drop catch, but wow, what athleticism."
"flat on off to start, pulled to midwicket"
"lovely. Pitches on off, and rips past the outside edge. <strong>That's a gem of a delivery</strong>. Yummy."
"Smith has had enough. Puts Rangana Herath behind him, runs at the left-arm spinner. it's another dart, but Smith improvises nicely. Cuts away through point. Races away"
"oh my. This is amazing batting. Knows this is going to be flighted because the previous one was flat. Smith runs down, gets to the pitch and lofts the ball over the bowler. Brilliant 1-2 batting"
"short and wide. nadeem beaten in the mind. Smith rocks back and hammers a cut through point. Wow, how has he transferred pressure back on the bowler?"
"flat, straight, quick. He still tries to hit the ball through cover, but can't because it's the arm ball. Inside-edged onto the pad"
"136 kph, given. Zaheer strikes again. It's all action here at the Kotla. A slower offcutter outside off, Tripathi cuts but doesn't make contact. Or does he? Zaheer hardly appeals. Pant went up straightaway. I certainly didn't hear a nick. Too close to cut that but it's T20, you have to try. Just the thinnest of spikes on Snicko, the right decision"
"full and wide, pushed through cover for a run"
"full and straight, pushed back to the bowler"
"good length delivery on leg, flicked away through square leg"
"straightish on leg, worked to deep square leg"

on his pads and clipped away to deep square leg
"fullish delivery on the pads, worked to midwicket"
"oh great batting. Back of a length outside off, Tiwary hangs back and punches a cut through point. Superb stroke, just used all his weight to punch into the ball"
"and another one. Leans on his push, prioritises finding the gap and finds it, through cover. Awesome"

"flat down leg, worked to deep midwicket"
"flat and extremely wide outside off, called"
"a googly outside off, driven to cover."

"flat down leg, worked to midwicket"
"flat down leg, worked away to deep backward square leg"
"oh that's brilliant. Jumps out, gets to the pitch and even if he didn't read it, so what? He was at the pitch and thrashed the legbreak waaay over long-on. Sublime skills"
carved away through the sweeper cover
"flat and wide outside off, played away towards point. The ball goes somewhere from somewhere and the batsmen run one. Dead ball called. Karun, at point, threw it the bowler who let it go because he was blinded. Right decision"
"the flatter quicker delivery outside off, goes underneath the bat"
"a googly on off, swept down to deep square leg for a run"
"kept really low. Flat on off, Smith misses a pull and is given. Smith is not happy at all. Was there bat? Absolutely dead. He likes pulling but completely misread the length of that. Went back and tried to pull a fuller than good length. He missed it and was struck in front of off. Plumb."
"flat and straight, defended. Good pace"
"quicker through the air outside off, pushed through. Played back"
"ooh. Off the pad or bat? Bat says the umpire. A full, flat delivery down leg, Stokes flicks too early and a thick outside edge races down to the third man boundary"
"a bad ball. Don't need to try too much. Tries a legspinning type variation down leg, flicked to midwicket"
"good end. Flat, quick and straight, played back. Excellent over for Daredevils"
"fullish delivery outside off, chopped away towards cover"
"full delivery outside off, some extra bounce. Manoj's wild, uninhibited swing makes contact with nothing but air"
"gets it past mid-on and four. Fullish delivery on middle, with mid-on up. Shovelled into the gap wide of mid-on"
"139 kph, too much width. Cut to deep point. The fielder does very well, running to his left, to keep them to one"

"full outside off, drilled down to long-off"

"overpitched on off, drilled to long-off"
"excellently bowled. A wide googly outside off, Stokes knows there is no consequence if he misses a swing because the delivery isn't straight. A thick outside edge goes over slip for four"
"good length delivery outside off, punched to the sweeper cover"
"good length outside off, 143 kph. Stokes misses a carve down to third man. Harried for pace"
"back of a length on off, Stokes rushes at Cummins and slaps a pull over midwicket for four. Great batting."
"good length outside off, Stokes misses a cut. So miss, hit, miss. Four in three balls"
"good length around off, carved to third man. Another dot ball. These racking up now."
finds a gap through cover. Nadeem saves a couple by scampering to his left and pulling the ball back in time
"<b>dropped</b>. A great effort. Short outside off, pulled away to deep midwicket, Samson ran in, always looking for the catch, got his hands underneath but couldn't quite cling on. Great intent"
"90 kph, short outside off, Stokes chops a cut to the bowler"
"got underneath the length and lofts over long-on. Full delivery on off, too full. Stokes' muscle enough. Add timing and it's huge"
"flat on off, pushed to cover"
"short outside off, flat-batted to long-off"
"flat delivery on off, Tiwary has placed that to perfection. Places the sweep past short fine leg. Deep backward square leg can't get across with a dive either, Cummins. Both fielders dived, the ball's path was undisturbed. Newton's first law"
"a shortish slower ball on off, pushed down to long-on."
"stood like Chanderpaul, even more awkward. Went back to normal stance late and guided the cut to the sweeper cover"
excellent yorker. Terrific call by Tiwary. Stokes can only dig that out. The ball is near the feet of Stokes. But Tiwary calls for the easy run
"<strong>another sitter dropped</strong>. It's just unbelievable. Another slower ball outside off, Tiwary looks to hit that through midwicket but the ball went up off the leading edge. karun went sideways towards cover, called early but didn't get underneath the ball even though he had enough time to. Was not in a good position to take the catch"
"a yorker outside off, jammed away to cover"
"short slower ball outside off, dabbed to backward point. Excellent end from Zaheer, created a chance"
"fullish outside off, pushed towards cover."
"six more. 136 kph, on the pads and Stokes flicks away over square leg for a huge six. Got underneath and went away with his muscle. Excellent hitting"
tries to execute the wide yorker. Outside the tramline
"that's good from Tiwary, good from Stokes, good from Shami. An absolute gun yorker, perfect. Stokes digs it out, it looks like it's going towards the stumps so Stokes has that to worry about. Tiwary wants the run, but Stokes may not have made it at the bowler's end so loud yelp of 'nooooo'"
"looks for the yorker but misses his length by a distance. A low full toss on off, Stokes looks to go straight but can't get underneath the ball enough. That length took him by surprise. So a mis-timed loft goes down the throat of Anderson who makes a relatively complex catch look ridiculously easy."
"134 kph, a slower ball outside off. Dabbed to point"
"a short delivery on middle, nudged to short fine leg"
"nice slower ball from Anderson outside off, carved to point"
"another slower ball on leg, pushed to long-on"
"short delivery on middle, pulled to deep square leg"
"full and wide outside off, Tiwary misses a sweep. Struck on the pad, well outside the line"
amazing execution. The best place to bowl to Dhoni early in his innings? A wide yorker outside off goes underneath the bat
"full and wide outside off, driven with bad timing to wide long-off for a couple. great awareness from Tiwary, knows there is enough time to come back for two, and is always looking for it"
"a short, slow delivery down leg, Tiwary finds short fine leg. ooh, lucky for Cummins"
"wow, what a shot. Short delivery on middle, he plays a swivel flick in which both his feet are at the same length on the pitch. That allowed him to flick his wrists to get it behind square for a couple. Made a run"
"is he gone? That's a direct hit from Shami. A short slower ball down leg, he labours the first half of the run. he wasn't aware that the throw is going to come at his end, he wasn't aware that the fielder was so close to the ball. Shami doesn't care what Dhoni thinks. He picks up and hits the stumps at the bowler's end. Dhoni can't make it even with a dive. What a game changer that. Dhoni a few inches short, not often we see that"
"short delivery on middle, pulled to deep square leg"
"another short slow ball down leg, played down to fine leg. That length is good, that line is asking for trouble"
and again. A short slow ball down leg. Tiwary misses a pull. Not sure that's great bowling but it's worked. What do I know?
"great bowling. Nails the yorker on leg, pushed to long-on. Tiwary hustles back for two. Out with a direct hit at the bowler's end but that's worth the risk."
"and gone. Rising Pune are imploding. Full delivery on off, was that the slower ball? No, full, straight on off. Christian looks for a sweep but misses the scoop. That was plumb. Christian thought he got outside the line, but he didn't. Good decision under pressure umpire Nandan. Good option, flawed execution"
"a full toss on off, pushed to cover"
looks for the mow over midwicket. But can only slap a pull to long-on. great bowling. it's fuller than a good length. Tiwary can't do much
"a full toss on middle, 143 kph. Pushed to long-on. Can't get enough behind that"
good delivery. A slower delivery on a length. Sundar punches a push wide of cover for a couple.
"huge. He's waiting for that. So predictable. A short delivery on leg, sits up and Tiwary pulls over square leg"
"talking about boundary-scoring options. He knows exactly what he's doing. A full delivery outside off, Tiwary lofts the ball over cover for six. the timing is sensational. Sublime thinking cricket"
"146 kph, that was almost five. A wide wide yorker down leg. Looking to follow Tiwary, but Tiwary never moves. pant dives to his left to save four"
"a low full toss on leg, Tiwary can't quite get underneath that. Goes towards long-on, but Tiwary refuses the single. Absolutely the right decision"
"148 kph, five feet either side of the fielder and Pune are favourites. A low full toss on off, swept to short fine leg. Straight to the fielder"
"it's full, it's quick. It's accurate. A yorker down leg, beats Tiwary for pace. It ricochets to Pant's right off the pad. That's four but it ain't enough"
"Cummins holds his nerve. Tiwary's spirited fight ends. A slower, straight delivery, wary of bowling wide either side. The ball goes through Tiwary's wild swing and knocks over middle stump. Daredevils have done what they've always liked to do, defend a target with their bowling."
