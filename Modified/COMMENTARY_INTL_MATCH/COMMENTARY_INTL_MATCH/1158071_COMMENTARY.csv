"length ball, 131kph/81mph and drifting on to the pads, all Hope has to do is tuck it around the corner, past short fine leg and that's four!"
"pitched up, sliding across as Hope steps out and has a dash, beaten past the outside edge"
"<b>dropped!</b> Rashid puts down a stinker at third man! Big, top-edged hack from Hope, high and not-so-handsome towards the man stationed on the rope - but the attempt to catch it was even uglier"
"good length in the channel, holding its line a touch, Gayle <del>hammers it on to the next Caribbean island</del> lets it go"
"nipping away, touch of outswing for Willy, again Gayle lets it go"
"good length, 134kph./83mph and curling away as Gayle again shoulders arms - three dots in a row! The Universe Boss doing it his way"
"back of a length on off stump, Hope dabs it through backward point"
"full on leg stump, tickled through midwicket for Gayle's first run"
"gottim - <b>big leading edge and Root holds this one!</b> Maybe a slower delivery from Curran, it stood up off the deck as Hope went across the line and sent a steepler towards midwicket for a pretty simple catch (though the same could be said for the one Rashid dropped)"
"back of a length, 134kph/83mph and it skids on to hit the thigh pad... Curran appeals, but there wasn't much going for that. Pitched outside leg, for a start"
coming back at him as Hetmyer hangs back and steers towards point
"smoked! <b>Hetmyer ploughs the first six over long-on!</b> Steps out and strikes through the line, clean as whistle beyond the ropes"
"full and swinging late, but that takes it beyond Gayle's flail and into the tramlines"
"drags it back a touch, big swing across the line but he doesn't connect"
"floated up, full outside off and it hits the seam, Gayle again carves out a slice of fresh air"

"full and straight, dug out for one into the leg side"
"pitched up in the channel, Hetmyer leans out and dabs one through the covers"
"slotted for six more! <b>Flicked off the legs and over the pickets</b>... Willey was aiming for the blockhole, but erred. Gayle flexes his guns"
"length ball on the stumps and heaved away into the leg side, just one to the boundary ride"
"dug in short, 140kph/8mph and it's a tasty height, Gayle just nodding it through without thinking of a shot"
"shortish, on the hips and pulled with one leg in the air, scooped out towards deep square leg on the bounce"
"full on off, <b>slower-ball yorker from Jordan</b> and it nearly does for Hetmyer, who chops down on it and gets a thick inside edge to short fine leg"
"hits a length, this rushes Hetmyer as he pulls off the splice towards mid-off, Plunkett misfields... but Gayle is happy to keep the strike"
"pitched up, wide of off stump at 140kph - <b>and Gayle squirts it straight to short third man!</b> Jordan shrugs sheepishly in celebration, not sure that was intended as a wicket-taking delivery, just one that's hard to hit... only for Gayle to steer it tamely to the edge of the ring"
"full outside off, slapped through backward point to the sweeper"
"back of a length, 136kph/84mph and Bravo prods at it warily from the crease"
"short and pulled this time, just a pick up for one through square leg"
"dug in short, Hetmyer doesn't quite get hold of his pull, <b>but manages to clear Bairstow for four!</b> Came off the top edge but sailed high and to the right of the keeper"
"full and wide this time, beats a guileless hack from Hetty"
"full toss, <b>spooned to mid-on!</b> Maybe another slower ball and he's miscued to the edge of the circle... He won't be improving that T20I average today! Bit of a club cricket dismissal, but no dramas with the catch by Plunkett"
"length ball, squares up the new man, Nic Pooran, as he prods and thick-edges through point for one"
"pitched up, this scuttles through, nearly poleaxes Bravo as he drops his bat late and fails to connect"
"length, 132kph/81mph, defended back to the bowler"
"short of a length, taking the pace off and Bravo nudges it to short fine leg, they hustle through"
"length ball, 139kph/87mph around the top of off, steered towards backward point from the crease"
"banged in short, Pooran latches on and connects with a meaty pull, <b>cracked in front of square and that'll be four!</b> Boundary to finish the Powerplay"
"pushes through a googly on leg stump, tapped back down the track"
"tossed up outside off, Bravo pulls but sends it straight back to the bowler"
"nicely bowled, another wrong'un and Bravo is beaten pushing forwards, YJB then whips off the bails for good measure"
"worked off the front pad, against the turn for one"
pushed through flat and nudged off the legs
"tossed up, Bravo happy to knock around like a proper T20 for a bit, clipped to long-on"

"slower ball, worked behind square on the leg side"
"length ball, worked down into the leg side for a single"
"taking the pace off again, outside off and Pooran thick-edges down to third man, sharp fielding again keeps them to one"

flat on off stump and sliced through point for one
"pushes through a flatter, quicker googly and Bravo chops it straight to backward point"
"floats up the legbreak, swept hard from off stump but just one to deep backward square"
"<b>lovely stuff from Rashid!</b> Another Bosie that smuggles its way through to the keeper as Pooran lunges out, but again he's got a boot grounded to prevent being stumped!"
"dug in, Bravo fends it up and over the keeper! <b>First boundary since the Powerplay for West Indies</b>, not that the batsman knew much about it"
short but sliding behind the pads for an extra
defended back to the bowler
"full and wide of off stump, that's in the arc... <b>and out of the park!</b> Lusty heave over long-on, the ball bouncing away off the concrete by the changing rooms"
"better length on off, jabbed down"
"short ball, taking the pace off and Bravo tucks it past short fine leg for a single"
"banged in short, <b>Pooran hammers a pull high towards deep midwicket</b>... Bounces between the two men on the boundary, but Billings does well to jump over the rope and pull it back to prevent four!"
"good length, outside off, chopped into the covers"
tossed up and hauled out to deep midwicket
"planting the front dog, and <B>battered into the stands!</B> Put some sugar and lemon on that, it's cooked to a crisp, over long-off"
flipped off the toes out to deep square leg
"push and go, out to midwicket, looking for a second there but one will suffice"
"tight line and length on leg stump, solid block"
"back of a length, on leg stump, clipped behind square with a closed face"
"down the track, and that's<strong> pancaked over long-on! </strong>Plunkett banged it in, but that was met on the top of the bounce, flat-batted across the line, power and intent!"
"cunning slower ball, on a full length and dabbed back down the track"
"a roundhouse flog into the leg side, lots of intent but Plunkett's awkward length limits the damage"
"short again, and this one really lifts into the gloves with spitting intent! Straight into the body"
"short again, but this time Bravo is primed for that length. He's so far back in his crease, weight anchored on the back foot, and <B>slaughtered into the stands at midwicket!</B>"
"back of a length, turning into the hip and paddled behind square"
"very full, outside leg, slips past an ambitious waft"
"open face, guided to backward point"
"turning into the pads, that's a lovely restrictive line"
"half an appeal as Bravo wafts round a straight one. Looks like an inside edge, as that seems pretty adjacent otherwise"
nurdled to square leg
"solid areas from Denly, dragging Pooran forward on off stump to defend. Tidy work"
"clears the front leg, and a <B>frantic thwack through the line!</B> Doesn't get hold of it entirely, but plenty bat regardless, plopping inches inside the rope at long off"
"short and very sharp, but too high for the umpire's liking"
"fully forward, tapped to cover. Up comes the hundred"
"fired down the leg side, on a very full length"
"<B>wow, that's incredible from Jordan!</B> Not sure what's better, the utter sucker punch of a slower ball, or the spread-eagled dive across the pitch to his right to intercept a looping leading edge! Bravo was utterly deceived, all the pace off the ball, but back of a length and skidding onto the bat. He had to change direction so athletically in his followthrough, but leapt like a jaguar to scoop the offering in his right hand, inches from the turf!"
beaten for pace outside off stump. Welcome to the crease (ex-)skipper
"short again, leaps into the bat as Brathwaite struggles to find his range"
"length delivery outside off, slammed firmly into the covers, but can't find his way through"
"reverse-swept, to backward point"
"fully forward and pushed with the spin into the covers. Hit me into the wind, is the challenge"
"<B>big air!</B> Tossed right up above the eyeline, dips on the crease, and spins past the edge. A booming swipe at nothing"
"quicker through the air, impeccable line outside off, out of the front of the hand and off the edge of a flummoxed bat. That's a very ducky duck, and England are in total command now"
"full and tight, zipping through"
"perfect lines from Rashid, outside off, threatening to spin either way, dabbed uncertainly to point to finish a fine over"
"flashed through the covers, front leg thrust out of harm's way and through comes the blade with massive intent!"
"a quicker delivery, climbing outside off and missing the swish across the line"
"drawn forward on the front foot, worked out to the leg side with a full-faced poke, and <B>that's excellent running </B> to come back for the second"
"rolls the fingers, slower ball, banged into the surface, scuttles through to the keeper"
"slower ball outside off, but good bounce from a good length regardless. That's Plunkett's height coming to play"
"a scuffed pull round the corner to backward square, Plunkett hitting the pitch hard once again and making it hard to line the ball up"
"a rolled-wrist drive out through point, and more good running to complete a handy over"
"outside off, slapped to deep cover off the back foot"
"<B>brilliance!</B> A fully fledged switch hit from Pooran, flips his stance, eye on the ball, down on one knee, flogged with the wind over deep midwicket!"
more conventionally into the covers
"<B>smashed high out to cow corner!</B> A bit too far under the ball this time, but Billings on the rope runs out of room! A stunning leaping effort, gets his fingers to it, but it's gone"
right at the bottom of the bat for a floppy flog to mid-off. Allen's cameo is brief and to the point
tucked down the ground to bring up an excellent and much-needed fifty
"very wide, good idea, but the wrong side of legal"
"yorker, and that's exceptional, just doodlebugging down into the crease, and dug out with an urgent stab"
"back of a length, <B>back of the stands!</B> Pooran picked that like a low-hanging Golden Delicious in a grumpy neighbour's garden! Hanging back in the crease for the slower-ball bouncer, and slammed out of sight!"
"another wild swing over the leg side, but this is faster from Curran and tighter to off stump, beats a lusty blow"
"another <B>slower ball</B> and that's unlucky for Curran! In the blockhole, slapped high and hard out to deep square leg, but it <B>plugs safe with two fielders converging!</B>"
"<strong>beautiful finish!</strong> That was an exceptional duel between two quality players, and Curran gets the final say this time, pinging the top of middle with a well-directed length ball, hint of shape away to beat the urgent swing, and West Indies have lost their main source of impetus with 13 balls to go..."
"bouncer, flies through to the keeper, but too high for the umpire's liking"
"slower ball, low full toss, tucked to the leg side, but Nurse slips to deny them the second run"

"biffed out to the covers, where Curran has it covered, <B>but nutmegs himself as his spikes get stuck in the ground!</B> Whoops"
"a heave to leg, and a big miss"
"back-of-a-length slow legbreak. Very conventional, and defended with respect"
"lots of air, a wipe to the leg side, can't connect properly, and that's the end of an exceptional spell. 13 dot balls in his four overs."
"<strong>inside-edged, and that's unlucky!</strong> A lovely yorker from Curran, but a big squeeze past leg stump, and past the sprawling keeper!"
"walloped out to deep midwicket, but<strong> just short of the fielder!</strong>"
crashed on the up to the leg side. The sweeper intercepts
"<B>well batted Ashley Nurse!</B> Turns his stance inside-out, gets a touch cramped as he does so, but lifts his deflection past leg stump and to the rope!"
"slower ball, big wind-up, misses out, goes for the single as the keeper shies ...  misses ... Curran gathers, shies ...<B>misses too</B> ... it's all happening!"
"low full toss, slapped hard down the ground and <strong>Curran finishes with four!</strong> Right at the bottom of the bat, Billings steadies himself at long-off, and that's a very competitive total on a tricky pitch for free-flowing strokeplay"
"short ball, sits up nicely - <b>hooned over deep backward square for six first ball!</b> Hales tucks in straight away, lashed hard and flat a long way past the rope"
"oof, another leg-side half-tracker, <b>this one helped away to fine leg!</b> Cottrell given a bloody nose"
"fuller but on the pads and it's deflected past Hope, who probably should have stopped it... but it runs for four more!"
"<b>dropped!</b> Cottrell hits a length, 140kph/87mph and Hales chips it down the ground - <b>but Brathwaite spills it as his right hand hits the turf!</b> Brilliant effort, running across from mid-on, he managed to take the catch but it was jarred from his grasp as he landed"
"pitched up, bit of inswing and YJB is off the mark with a bunt to leg"
"fullish, this swings past the pads as Hales shuffles across"
"<b>here comes the salute!</b> Full and through a barn-door swing across the line, smashing into middle and off stumps to give Cottrell some reward at the end of a difficult opening over! You miss, he'll hit"
pushed down the leg side first up
"length ball at 137kph but very wayward and Bairstow just shovels it up and over short fine leg, the man in the deep is square and won't get around!"
"length on the pads, again YJB clips it through the on side, in front of deep square this time and again Hetmyer isn't getting there!"
"fired well down the leg side again, helped away behind deep square! <b>Buffet bowling from Thomas and Bairstow fills his plate</b>... again Hetmyer scurrying about to no avail"
"finds the right line, full on middle and off, tapped back"
"low full toss, 135kph and it swings a touch, YJB twocks it towards point"
slings down a full toss on the pads and this time Bairstow does pick out Hetmyer on the rope for just a single
"pitched up, clipped off leg stump on the full to the man in the deep"
"fullish and swinging a touch before nibbling off the deck, <b>beats Root's expansive drive!</b> Nicely bowled"
"straightening a touch as Root walks across his stumps, deflects off the pad and Cottrell goes up for lbw - given! But Root <b>reviews</b>, perhaps hoping it has pitched outside leg. If it hasn't it's going to be a short return to the T20 side for him... Yep, just in line and <b>going on to clip the leg bail, according to Hawk-Eye!</b> So Cottrell doesn't have to retract his salute"
comes across and lets this one go outside off
"back of a length over the stumps, jumps and jabs down into the off side"
"pitched up and shaping away a touch, Morgan swings but can't get near it"

pushed through on the stumps and worked to short fine leg
"flat offbreak, jumps a touch and hits the splice as YJB goes back attempting to cut"
"floated up full, room to free the arms and <b>batter four through the covers</b>... Right out of the screws and into a gap"
darted in quickly and poked towards point
"quick delivery, bit of drift away as Bairstow goes back to cut, <b>edged wide of the keeper for four!</b> Gayle not the ideal man to give chase there"
tally ho! <b>YJB plonks this over the rope at midwicket!</b> Just an extension of the arms as he skips down and swings across the line
short and wide and creamed through backward point! Too easy for England
"fired very wide, swing and a miss... but inside the tramlines, it saeems"
"fast and straight, 148kph/92mph and Morgan can only bunt to mid-off"
"shortish, 141kph and Morgan is up on his toes trying to cut... <b>rockets through past the top edge and clears Hope!</b> Unlucky to concede four from that ball"
dug in and stabbed down towards point
"back of a length, 145kph/90mph and not quite enough room for Morgan to cut freely, squirted to backward point"
short of a length outside off and Bairstow dabs it for one
"back of a length in the channel, only 127kph/79mph but there's decent bounce as MOrgan cuts at it and misses"
"length on off stump, tapped into a gap in the covers for one"

short of a length and run away through gully with an open face
"back over the wicket, fuller length and taking the pace off, stroked to cover"
"another slower ball, YJB flicks at it down the leg side and it bounces through to Hope... Brathwaite was half-appealing and the umpire is happy it flicked something, as he doesn't signal wide, to Bairstow's chagrin"
"<b>dropped!</b> Thick edge this time but Hope only gets fingertips on it! Brathwaite was going up in celebration, but it quickly turned to disappointment... Sharp chance, and then it skids away to the rope at third man, to add to the injury"
stays back and worked into a gap
"short ball, 133kph/82mph and YJB hoicks it away past short fine leg, that'll race to the rope, too"
"bouncer, again he pulls and gets it wide of the keeper, Hope gives chase"
"pitched up and riven, a tight chance to mid-off<b> but Brathwaite's shy misses!</b> Would have been gone!"
dug in short and YJB ducks it
"back of a length, worked off the hip for one more to fine leg"
"pitched up and <b>smeared over the rope!</b> Cleanly lifted down the ground, wide of long-off for his second six"
flicked away into the leg side
"short ball, pulled in the air - <b>straight to midwicket!</b> Brathwaite strikes, ending a laboured stay from Morgan. Maybe a slower ball and he couldn't manufacture any power on the shot, which just lobbed to Gayle for a head-height catch"
pitched up and stroked through the covers to get off the mark
goes back and across and runs one more through backward square
"back of a length over the stumps, poked back to the bowler"

"Denly steps out and is nearly done by Nurse firing it down the leg side, has to stick out a pad and block the path of the ball through to the keeper"
"wide full toss outside off, and <b>placed with minimum fuss through backward point!</B> Timing"
"full length, wide line, Bairstow reaches but can't get there, half an enquiry for the caught-behind"
"<B>that's a pie!</B> Knee-high full toss, outside off, all Bairstow needs to do is lean on his stroke with a bend of the knee and rifle it past point"
"open face, dabbed to third man, Bairstow's sharp running brings up the 100"

"outside off, nudged to point, another handy over for England's cause"
"back in the crease, slapped down to long-on"
"back of a length, tapped to the off side"
"<B>a big heave through the line from Bairstow, and Brathwaite is waiting!</B> Plops into his hands on the edge of the rope, and a fine innings is chopped off at the knees. Now then ..."
"a bottom-handed bunt to the leg side, fetched from way outside off"
"firmly forward, pushed to the off side"
"round the wicket, that's too short and slammed behind square, but Thomas pounces well on the 45 to cut off a certain four"

"high-elbowed defence on the back foot, pushed to the on side"
"round the wicket, into the toes, clipped to the on side"

"fuller, outside off, open-faced steer to third man"
"good line and length outside off, an urgent flog into the off side, no contact this time"
"too short, and <B>carved with intent past point!</B> Hanging leg-side, and climbing into the hint of width. The sweeper sprints round but can't get close!"
"keeps low outside off, and Denly is beaten on the drive"
"back of a length, very straight line, but Denly is once again batting outside leg, and can open his face to pinch the single to third man"
"squeezed in front of third man, and <B>that's another woeful bit of fielding on the rope!</B> Hustled by the expectation of them coming back for two, he ended up ushering it over the rope for four!"
more tricksy bounce...back of a length and skipping through
flashed into the covers from back in the crease. More good contact
"short and sharp, whistling through as Denly has a wipe"

"angled into the pads, lifting off the deck, good ball, but that's another single. Just 10 to get now"
"full toss, on the pads, tapped to long-on"
"sharp delivery! Raps the gloves on a tight off-stump line, and Billings rides it as if we're back in the Test series! But there's another single into the vacant cordon"
doesn't get up as intended this time
"short, and hoisted up, up and away,<strong> but into the breeze and into deep square leg's hands!</strong>"
"<B>smashed out to deep square leg, and dropped!</B> A brain-fade from Billings, hitting into the breeze and for some reason Thomas only goes for it with one hand. Worried about the proximity of the rope, but that could have been interesting!"
"an effort ball to end it ... he's made the breakthrough, but it's come too late you sense"
"<B>full, straight and bowled!</B> A loopingly slow cutter, Billings is drawn into a wild glory-seeking hack, and off come his bails! Another day when Billings has come to the party, then left it rather drunkenly after necking the tequila when the dancefloor was at his mercy"
"full length, tapped into the off side to get off the mark with a calm single"
"short, sharp, <strong>bursts through the keeper's gloves</strong>, and that's wrecked the suspense! Oh well, it was intriguing while it lasted"
"slower ball again, tucked to the leg side and the scores are level"
slammed through long-on and that's a comprehensive win!
