"walks across, exposes all three stumps and helps this in-drifter to the fine leg boundary. Ashwin fired this in and Wade used the pace to sweep it along"
"Oh, Matt Wade! What have you done? Going for a glory hit so soon? Steps out to take him on, Ashwin gets this to dip and turn, Wade heaves across the line to get a top-edge. Now, Gill runs back from midwicket, Jadeja to his left from mid-on. There's confusion, it seems as if both of them will collide. They do, but Jadeja just manages to hang on as this descends on them. Mighty relief in the Indian camp. I could almost imagine fielding coach R Sridhar flinging his cap in disgust had that gone down. What a big moment. Ashwin into the act straightaway and India have taken the first hour."

"big, big moment. Smith has glanced one to Pujara at leg gully. Ashwin bowls one down the leg side, not sure how much that was part of the plan but Smith couldn't help and looks to get off the mark. Makes the connection alright but ends up hitting it straight to Pujara, who tumbles to complete the catch. Smith fetches a blob, means he has two runs in three innings with one not-out for Smith so far in this series"

"nice loop from Ashwin. Pitching around middle and spinning away, defended from the back foot"
"flatter and quicker, stays back and blocks again"
"fuller and in the channel, left alone"
a big appeal for lbw. The umpire thought about it before saying no. <b>India are reviewing this</b>. Was a length ball that kept coming in with the angle to beat the inside edge. Was it too high though? It hit Labuschagne just above the knee roll. The impact is in line but it would have sailed over the stumps. Good decision by Paul Reiffel

"another short one and even better shot from Lyon. Pulls it over midwicket on this occasion, four more to him"
"<b>two bouncers followed by a fuller one</b>. It was fast and straight and thuds into Lyon's pads before he could get his bat down. Up goes the finger. The only doubt is if it's going down. There's no bat, the impact is on middle and leg and it would have just gone on to clip the leg stump, the on-field umpire's call stays as it is. Bumrah gets his fourth"

"short of length at the body, Gill stays back and blocks"
"<b>dropped by Labuschagne</b>. Was fuller around off and middle, Gill was looking to play on the leg side. Got the outside edge but Labuschagne put it down at third slip. Was a sharp chance, chest-high to the right but should have been taken"

Was a length ball outside off, Pujara wanted to play at it, more like feel bat on the ball and thus sort of pushed at it. Was there a spike? Nothing on the HotSpot but looked like there was tiny murmur as the ball passed the bat. The umpire doesn't think that was bat on the ball though. <b>Australia lose their review</b>"

"how close is that? They'll have a look at that. Very risky business. Direct hit would've been out. Looks like he's gone. It's another run out involving Rahane, this time he's at the receiving end. Jadeja tapped it to short cover, instinctively took off for a run that was really not on, Rahane responded immediately, went full tilt, went full-stretch but he's still just about short of the crease.

"full on off, steered to the point region"
hops back and defends this shortish delivery
"appeal, appeal, massive. Struck flush on the toe. India like what they see, they're referring this. Searing yorker, catches Burns on the boot and is caught by surprise by the pace of the delivery. But the ball tracking comes back as 'umpire's call' even though the ball was clipping the leg stump. India don't lose a review. Burns breathes a huge sigh of relief."

"what a ball! Burns runs out of luck. Umesh with an absolute peach. India celebrate, Burns reviews as the clock strikes the 15-second mark. Given out caught behind. It's strange that he consulted his partner, he surely knew? Hotspot says there is a spot so yeah, he's gone. India strike early. This one was full, pitched on off and left him late as it hit the seam, Burns pushes tentatively and gets a faint edge. <b> Wasted review, very very poor from Burns </b>"

"length ball jags back in to rap Labuschagne on the knee. An appeal for lbw but denied. To me, it looked like the impact was just outside off. India are pondering if to review or not, and they eventually go for it. There is no bat involved. The impact is also in line but it struck him just above the knee roll, and would have gone on to just clip the bails. So that's umpire's call and Labuschagne survives"

"trouble, huge trouble for Cummins as he shoulders arms to a quicker ball. Not given, India review at the end of the 15-second mark. Not sure why it took so long. Pant didn't seem very sure about it. Possibly the only thing that could save Cummins is umpire's call on height. Ball tracking shows this would've missed the stumps. <b> Not out! </b>"

"nice and full outside off, Green confidently pushes it back down the pitch"

"tossed up on middle, he gets well forward and blocks"

squirts it off a thick inside edge past midwicket
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"the resistance is over! It's a snorter from Bumrah that has Cummins fending awkwardly. This was a short ball coming right at his throat, hard hands that froze as the ball ballooned to Agarwal who takes a dolly at second slip. Huge relief for India."
<b>nasty bouncer first up!</b> Right up at the helmet. Starc fends awkwardly and has no clue about this. Thick inside edge runs to fine leg's left and he plucks it back into play with a laboured bend down

good length and angled into the pads. He has a natural shuffle anyway and that means plenty of room and angle to tickle this past the keeper
"good length and just outside off, solidly blocked on the front foot"
spanked past point! Quality execution this. Some very patient batting and then taking the runs when they're offered. Bumrah marginally short outside off. Green is into a half press as he gets this square drive on the up

"tossed up at a length on off stump, defended on the front foot"

full and into the toes. Clips it expertly with soft hands through square leg. The fielder running in from the deep can't get the throw in quickly enough to stop the second
"full and wide outside off, left alone"
<b>run-out sent upstairs. Siraj gets a hand in his follow through and it has hit the stumps at the non-striekr's end.</b> Starc has plopped the back in with his left hand. So he's safe. It was an overpitched ball driven firmly back
<b>yorker dug out.</b> Surprises him with one that's angled into the stumps
"<b>yes and no and a mad dash back for Starc.</b> Green wants the run and is halfway down when he says no. Starc didn't go too far down and was able to dive back. It was a punch to mid-off's left, a la Rahane in the last Test"

"good length and into off stump, defended on the front foot"
"<b>taken at midwicket!</b> Siraj has done the job on debut! Short of a length and hurrying into the corridor. Green looking to capitalise on the field being in again, looking for the boundary shot - the pull. He got out trying the exact thing against Ashwin in the last match. It gets big on him and comes off the high, inside part of the bat. Floats to Jadeja's right and he times his jump well to hang on. An innings of so much promise ends tamely. He's show his wares, this guy. Couldn't stretch on this time"

"good length outside off, blocked on the front foot"
"<b>an appeal is given out.</b> Not sure if it's for lbw or catch at slip, but Starc reviews. He was looking to flick a full one from middle stump. It lobbed up to Rahane's left at slip. Early indications are that his bat hit his front shoe. And Hotspot confirms that. The spot comes before the ball is close to bat. Umpire Wilson says he's sending it back to the on-field call, so it seems the on-field umpire had given it for the catch. He then remembers that he must check for lbw. And on that, the ball is sliding down leg. Oxenford reverses the decision."

"full at middle stump, punched to mid-on"
"full and into the pads, can't get the flick"
"<B>taken down leg side.</b> That was going to be the last over before lunch, possibly, and Australia are nine down. Short and a bit too quick for Lyon's pull at hip height. He's strangled and gets a glove on that. Doesn't review it. Wicket number five for Siraj on debut"
"<b>Hazlewood gets a strike rate of 500 first up.</b> Short at middle stump, gets on his toes and drops it into the leg side with soft hands. Siraj fields, swivels and throws at the non-striker's end. At mid-on, Ashwin's missed it completely"

"yorker at off stump, jammed into the covers"
<b>shoulders arms and that hits off stump!</b> Good length ball at a middle and leg stump line. He leaves expecting that to turn away more than it did. Off stump was completely exposed and Ashwin found the top of it
"nipbacker that hits him high on the thigh pad, ouch that should hurt and Agarwal is in some pain. Walks across to square leg wincing in pain"
right behind the line of this incoming length delivery as he defends
oooooo! How did that miss the edge? Agarwal feels for the delivery not sure if this is going away or coming back in. <strong>Beats him on the inside edge</strong>. There was a huge gap between bat and pad
"tucks this away down to fine leg, <strong>he's off the pair.</strong>"
flicks it nicely as it strikes Wade's bucket hands and pops out at short leg. Can't call it a chance

stands tall and bunts it into the covers for a quick single
hops back into the crease and defends as he rises with the bounce
appeal for lbw as Agarwal tentatively plays half-forward. Saved by an inside edge possibly
beauty! Agarwal is all at sea at the moment. This one leaves him late as Agarwal fiddles at that with a great deal of uncertainty. This is as good an examination as he will get. Superb bowling
"nicely worked off the pads, fine leg had to run around a fair bit and they get back for the second"
shows the full face of the bat as he defends this full delivery to mid-on
ah! What a good shot that is. Stands tall and punches this on the up past mid-off. Glorious

squirted away to the gully region
"plays the short-arm jab to fine leg, slightly uppish but rolls down to the fielder in the end"
"oh, dear. Agarwal's gone and it's come about because of uncertainty again. This one holds its line, Agarwal just feeling for the delivery yet again, gets a healthy edge and Paine does the rest. Muted celebration from Starc."

"full on off, defended back to the bowler"
stabbed away behind point for an easy single
stands tall and punches to cover
"edged and gone! Pujara pushes with hard hands into the gully. Uncharacteristic from him. This was full, not quite there for the drive, a hint of away movement with Pujara literally poking at the delivery half-heartedly. Australia have a second. Pujara kicks the turf, smashes the bat into the advertising triangles as he storms of fuming at the shot he's just played."
"nice and full, angling in from wide of the crease, defended back"
ah. what a shot! Pulled with disdain to the square leg boundary. Picking of length was the key and Rahane did it so very elegantly there.

"looks to pull again, this one keeps a tad low, skids through to hit him high on the body"
defended away to the point region
"slants one full across the batsman, left alone"
"punched beautifully through backward point. Fearless stuff. Sees a bit of width - mind you, not a lot of it - but his hand-eye coordination is top class. Opened the bat face slightly, used the pace and eased that away without much worry"
defends confidently as he rises with the bounce
"edged, races past the vacant fourth slip region to the boundary. The good thing was he played it with soft hands, didn't push hard at the delivery"
"pulled away but there's square leg and they'll take a single, good stop by Labuschagne"
tucks this away gently to square leg to keep strike
steers this back of a length delivery to point as he gets up on his toes
appeal for lbw as Rahane's is a tad late on a forward defence to a nip-backer. Replays confirm a bit of an inside edge

"looking for the width that isn't quite there, pushed into the off side"
driven away from the body to point

"beautiful shot! This is short, enough width and Rahane plays an exquisite cut shot. Uppish but there was no one at point"

nice and full on the stumps to defend this back to the bowler
"has a flay at that but is beaten, not quite short enough fort him to play that through point"
driven to mid-on off a thickish inside edge
"boss! That is the shot of the morning. By no means a half-volley but he stands tall and punches this on the up through cover. Held his pose for the cameras, just tells you how much he enjoyed that."

imperious! Picks the length early and pulls magnificently in front of square.
"full on off, defended back"
gets well forward and defends
"<strong>dropped at long-on by Starc diving to his right.</strong> Rahane steps out but doesn't get to the pitch, looks to hit it squarer but it's no more than a chip. Starc did all the hard work in getting to the ball but couldn't hold on"
lunges forward and defends

"steps out, Lyon shortens his length, Rahane whips this straight to Green at square leg"
works this with the spin to square leg again
"<strong>Rahane, quite fittingly, hits the winning runs, India level the series!</strong> This was short, spinning into middle and leg, Rahane pulls it to backward square leg, where there's a misfield. The ghosts of Adelaide buried emphatically."
