"full on middle and leg, nudged to square leg with the angle. Not much happening in this early going after dinner"
"nailed. Wow, superb shot. 84 mph, short on middle, doesn't climb steeply enough. Instead, it sits up for Karunaratne to cream through backward square leg. One of the better pull shots you'll see, kept it down, watched it, and played the shot late (which is why he found the gap behind square instead of square)"
"full outside off, a miscued drive rolls to mid-on"
"short on middle, pulled behind square again. Abbas just not generating enough pace to be penetrative"
"on the pads, worked to fine leg for a couple more. Amir, who has just bowled an over, has to run to his left, can't prevent the second"

"a maiden, another offcutter to finish, full outside off, left alone"
"good from Yasir. Good length outside off, pushed towards Yasir at point, who is quick on the ball to prevent the run"
"good length outside off, 80 mph, tapped to point"
a delectable punch finds cover. A good length means Karunaratne can stay back and play
"Yasir again. Ensures this is still a good over. Good length outside off, another confident punch towards point, Yasir dives to his left"
"persisting with that good length, closer to off this time, hit away to cover. Five dots, can he finish?"

"127 kph, slightly leg side-ish, allowing Chandimal to flick to wide mid-on for one"
"hammered! Another terrific pull, in front of square leg this time. Short on off, not a bad bouncer but the slow nature of the pitch means Karunaratne has an age to pick the length, go back and place his pull"
"almost a 180 degrees the other way and Karunaratne gets to yet another hundred, <strong>his seventh in Tests</strong>. Off comes the helmet, a big embrace from his captain and stadium-wide applause. Good length outside off, Karunaratne skews this off the outside half past point's right and it races away for four. Near-flawless innings so far"

"flat outside off, 84 kph, worked to midwicket with the spin"
"booooom! Karunaratne runs to the pitch and T20s the flight away over long-on. Ran to the pitch, got there and hit the ball cleanly. Terrific shot selection, hit with the spin"

"pushed through, flat on off, Chandimal brings his full, broad face to meet the ball"
"slow outside off, a bit of drift there, pushed away towards extra cover"
"oh yes, didn't change the trajectory but shortened the length subtly. That meant the ball had enough room to turn and beat the bat, <strong>terrific delivery</strong>"
"no no. The cons of wristspin, drops this short and wide outside off and Chandimal round 2 belongs to him, a sliced cut through point earns him four"
"<strong>wonderful short delivery</strong>, really got Karunaratne in an indecisive position. The bouncer on off, Karunaratne ducks"
"eeks, changes the point of release. A slingy delivery wide outside off, left alone"
"full and wide, 139 kph, guided to point"
"yauza, completely deceives Karunaratne with a terrific slower delivery. Short outside off, Karunaratne looks to cut but the ball is slow and so low that it sneaks underneath the bat"
"phew, he's steaming in. Digs this in on leg, fended to square leg for one. A thankless job this fast bowling"

"fired full and just around off, driven firmly to the edge of the ring at cover. Sensible"

"lands this at length on middle from wide of the crease, defended with soft hands"
crunching sound off the bat as he punched that length ball to point
"stunning delivery. Angled in from wide of the crease, just around off, Karunaratne was searching for the delivery and played outside the line. Swerved away first, pitched and then came back in. <b> Beaten comprehensively. </b>"
uses the depth of the crease to wrist this wide of square leg
"hint of movement away off the seam, Chandimal is squared up as he somehow defends that length ball back down the pitch. Right shoulder was visible to the bowler"
"gets a good stride in and drives this full, away-going delivery to mid-off"
big appeal for lbw. Dimuth is hit on the back leg as this length ball nips away off the seam. He played down the wrong line and got a <b> thin inside edge as well </b>
"width and put away. Being a traditional opener, you're taught to let those go. Dimuth is in prime form, batting past a century, so perhaps has a little bit of luxury. Leant into the drive and put that away behind square on the off side."

full and angling away. He's searching for late inswing but there's none. Left alone
<strong>nearly had him!</strong> Chasing an away-going delivery to drive on the up. Chandimal is mighty lucky
hint of feebleness to that defensive stroke. Once again not sure if this would nip away or hold its line. Squared up in defence
"floated full and way outside off. 'Try and hit it if you want to' kinds. Chandimal says 'no, thanks. Not now.'"
"gets this to bend back in from around the sixth stump. Chandimal does well to get outside the line of the stumps and shoulders arms. In doing so, he's hit flush on the knee and is in pain. The ball would've missed the stumps. He's not out but he's down and is being attended to by the physio."
"full and angling away, driven to extra cover"
"width outside off, shapes to cut but is beaten. Little too close, I reckon. Could've easily nicked that."
"angling away but far too wide outside off, the kind of delivery a batsman will gladly accept and leave at this time of the day, or any time for that matter"
<strong>cracker jack of a delivery.</strong> Karunaratne had to play at that. Pushed forward but luckily for him the ball jagged away sharply to beat the outside edge. Lucky break
"once again not entirely sure of the line of defence, gets a thick inside edge to the leg side"
shows the full face of the bat in defence
lets it go Steven Smith style. Watched it through and then just lifted his right leg in the air for some extra visual effects. Dramatic

"sharp turn from way outside off, left alone"

"invites the drive by pitching it up and just outside off, Chandimal lets it go"
into the pads and he's neatly flicked that away to the deep midwicket boundary. Rolled his wrists superbly to keep it all along the ground.
"have they got him at the fag end of the day? Big lbw shout but my first thoughts: not out. This swing away late to square Chandimal up. He was hit on the back pad but this would've missed off stump. He also got some bat on it. What's worse? That has sneaked through the slip cordon to race to the third man boundary. Leg-byes given by the on-field umpire. Wonder if runs will now be credited to the batsman considering there was some bat. Yes, the change has been made. Runs to Chandi. The significant bit though is <B> Pakistan have wasted another review </B>"
beauty! Chandimal is hopping and jumping at the fag end of the day. Squared up by one that hits length and nips away to whizz past the outside edge

"spins back in from outside off, Dimuth is hit on the pad but the impact is way outside off"

"sharp turn from outside off, Dimuth plays outside the line and gets a thick inside edge that rolls to square leg. <b> Stumps on day one </b>"
"full and very wide outside off to start, no stroke offered"
still full and extremely wide outside off. Could be a marginal call for wide in ODIs. Too wide to draw a stroke
"goes straighter and pays the price for it. Chandimal flicks this very fine down to the fine leg fence. Not overhit, just placed, <strong>gets to fifty too</strong>. Poor ball"
"squirted off the outside half for a couple more. Full outside off and wide, Chandimal plays the line but the ball hits the outside half and evades point. Yasir chases after it"

"on a length outside off, just hanging it out there, played to gully from the crease"

"a slower delivery on middle and leg, Chandimal somehow fails to make any contact, is rapped on the thigh pad. Was maybe undone by the lack of pace"
"better over from Wahab. Full and wide outside off, left alone comfortably enough"
"full delivery on off, 127 kph, nice line still, driven back. Just needs a little bit of movement from there"
"that was too wide outside off, full and wide. Karunaratne goes after it and crashes a drive past cover for three. The fielder may have taken some pace off the ball"

"short down leg, 81 mph bouncer, Karunaratne ducks"
"well bowled, 135 kph, bouncer, dug in on off, Karunaratne wants to get underneath it but the line is more towards off so he stands up and fends awkwardly into the off side. Lots of oomph in that over."

"slow on middle and leg, pitched well outside leg, lots of spin, Chandimal watchfully keeps it out"
"doesn't offer a stroke and he's gone! Yasir strikes. It was the previous delivery that did Chandimal in, the previous one ripped and turned prodigiously, this one didn't, both were legbreaks. But the doubt of how much turn is there in the pitch forced Chandimal to offer no stroke. This one drifted on, hit Chandimal in front of off and up went the finger.

"situations don't matter to him. If he's decided in his mind he's going to go for it, not even the prospect of hitting against the turn will stop him. This is a big spinning leggie pitched way outside off from Yasir, he changes his grip and plays the reverse sweep uppishly over point"

"width outside off, thumped on the up to cover point"
leans forward and caresses this full delivery to extra cover

turned to short fine leg. The length is on the shorter side again

backs away to make room and slaps this short ball into the gap at cover. Used the depth of the crease really well

carefully worked into the gap at midwicket. Nice stride forward as he eased this with the spin
"too full on middle and leg, worked behind square on the leg side"
"'hit me' ball and Dickwella says 'thank you very much.' Sitting up nicely for him to force that away through the back foot. Into the cover boundary in a jiffy. Wahab has a look of disbelief, as if to say 'how dare you do that to me.'"

While Lakmal did well to run to his right and get to the ball, he could have taken a second or two more before firing a throw at the bowler's end. <b> Aslam can thank his stars </b>"

"pitches this up, hoping the batsman drives. He's happy to leave"
elegant drive but straight to cover
struck on the pad but impact outside the line. Bounced through to the keeper who didn't collect it cleanly.
"floats a length ball across Aslam, who leaves"
"full and angling away again, left alone"
"superb bowling this. Got two balls to angle across, this length ball was on the stumps even if bowled at an angle. Aslam is struck on the pad as he plays outside the line of the delivery. Height wasn't in doubt. The line of the delivery was. Third umpire S Ravi looks at the ball tracking, confirms it would've just missed off stump. <b> Sri Lanka have lost a review </b>"

"once again a lovely angle across the left-hander, watched through to the keeper"

"gets one to drift in and straighten from around the stumps, squirted to the off side. Played down the wrong line. <b> Credit to debutant Sadeera for the tumbling stop </b>"

"slides a length ball across, left alone"
on the move across to defend as he gets a thick inside edge onto the pad. Length ball from wide of the crease. Gamage is generating bounce as well

"good delivery, shortens his length just a wee bit. Gets this to wobble away, left alone"
defends an away-going length ball with soft hands
on top of the bounce as he guides this delivery to gully again.

"leading edge, rolls to cover. This was bowled much slower through the air"
gets a good stride forward and defends with soft hands

"slower delivery across Masood this time, watched through to the keeper"
crunching drive but straight to mid-off
"too full on off stump again, driven straight to mid-off"
struck on the pad but the impact is outside the line. Late on the forward defense
swept from the stumps towards the fine leg boundary. He can laugh now but wouldn't have had he missed it. Too much risk again. He would've been plumb in front if he didn't get any bat on it

"squared up by late movement, touch fuller from length on off stump, he pokes at it and gets a thick edge to gully"

intent this time. Gets to the pitch of the ball as he steps out and lofts him cleanly over mid-off
"gets this length ball to come back in from around the stumps, defended back to the bowler"
jags back in off the deck to hit him on the thigh pad. Angle would've taken it down leg. Height in question too. <strong>Masood played all around it</strong>
"<b> first Test wicket for Gamage </b> and it's a beauty. Bowled this full on off stump, got it to nip back in off the seam. Masood goes for a loose drive away from the body, but only manages a thin inside edge as the ball crashes into the stumps. He's been plugging away and deserves the reward."
"floats this full on off stump, driven back towards the bowler"
"lovely seam position again. Lands this touch ahead of length on off, gets it to move away, Azhar leaves. Excellent decision"
that's how you play a cover drive. Just a gentle forward push as he meets the length ball with a nice high elbow to play on the up. Delightful
"opened up slightly by the turn, defended to the off side. Played down the wrong line initially before adjusting"
beaten by one that skids back in. He looks to whip this towards midwicket but the ball pitches on length around off and drifts in to beat the inside edge. As plumb as it can get. <strong>Waste of a review</strong>
lunges forward and defends one that spins back in sharply.
"<b> Azhar was struggling at the non-striker's end. </b> A direct hit would've been interesting. Dabs this cut towards point, doesn't want a single but Azhar is nearly halfway there as he turns back."

solid in defense again. Bat close to the pad as he keeps out that full-length delivery on of stump.

All these previous deliveries, he has been getting the ball to come back in, this one is also shaping back in, but it pitches and swerves away juuuuuuust enough. Shafiq is already on the front foot, trying to defend, the ball takes the outside edge and carries low to Mendis in front of him. The umpires don't check and Shafiq is off"

"short delivery down leg, 132 kph, awkwardly fended away past short leg for one"

"good single. On a length outside off, pushed into the off side, in front of point for a quick run."
"full and wide outside off, the ball comes back in, but too wide outside off to draw a stroke"
"what was that from Azam? That's an awful stroke. I have absolutely no idea why he played that shot. It's an extremely risky shot to attack Herath, but to take him against the spin with a midwicket stationed just for that? Aargh. Flat on off, the ball spins away just a touch. Azam doesn't improvise his stroke, instead goes through with the wrong option of trying to whip the ball through midwicket. Finds midwicket"

"phew, that's mighty close. <strong>And Sri Lanka will definitely review.</strong> It;s the slider from Herath, flat outside off, Azhar gets right forward to the pitch, but as the bat is about to meet the ball, the bat hits the pad and then deviates away from its initial course, allowing the ball a clear path to the front pad. Right in front of off. No bat, and three reds says HawkEye. Impact was the only doubt there could be. Azhar's fine innings ends."
"shortish and wide outside off, Sarfraz goes right back and chops a cut towards point"

"flatter one that bites back in from middle, tucked to midwicket"
"has paid the price for being too cheeky. He's always industrious and adventurous, but this time it has fallen flat on its face.

"the slider has done the trick again. Haris, having done all the hard work, has been consumed by misjudgment in line.

Wahab, initially looking to take evasive action, is caught by surprise by the speed at it which veers into him.

"Karunaratne this time uses his feet, gets down, the ball spins back and hits his pad"
"a massive ripper. Sarfraz and Yasir have a chat and decide against reviewing. Flat outside off, rips back in as Karunaratne tries to cut, strikes him in front of middle. <strong>Probably spinning down leg?</strong>"
"gone this time! An absolute ripper from Abbas. Late swing. Full delivery on off, the ball swerves away late. By this time, Kaushal brings his bat down straight, looking to hit the ball straight but that very late movement takes the outside edge and through to Sarfraz. Unplayable, not much Silva could have done"
"a big appeal but sliding down leg. Full down leg, Sadeera misses a flick. Struck on the pad"
"big big appeal. That looked out. Sarfraz asks for the review. Umpire Llong suggests that was going down leg. But there may have been some late away swing again. Full on the pads, down leg, misses the flick does Samarawickrama. But looks a bit leg side-ish. Missing the stumps, says HawkEye. Excellent call from the umpire."

Umpire's call on impact, two other reds, and the nightwatchman has to go."

"another one! Chandimal goes now. 85 mph, <strong>Chandimal now with the review</strong>. Good length delivery on middle and leg, the ball seams back in but Chandimal is shuffling right across and misses a flick. From around the wicket, that was not going to miss the stumps. Three reds on HawkEye and Sri Lanka in a bit of trouble."
"couldn't have asked for an easier delivery first up in the day. Full toss on leg stump, Dickwella simply lends direction as he tickles it to the fine leg boundary."
leans into the drive and crunches it on the up to mid-off
"uppish but into the gap at gully. Could have so easily popped a catch there. Looks to drive on the up, the ball holds on just a touch to the surface and bounces bit more than Dickwella expected. He went through with the stroke nd managed to squirt this away."

"appeal, albeit a half-hearted one for a catch. Dickwella looks to play a reverse sweep to a full delivery, misses it completely as the ball lobs off the forearm to the short leg fielder. S Ravi, the third umpire, has a long, hard look at it and concludes it was still quite some distance from the glove strap. Quite close.

steers this length ball into the gully region. Cleverly done by Dickwella. Enough width for him to lend direction. Using Wahab's pace to good effect
"this is a sensational catch from Sarfraz! Much needed wicket too. Wahab changes the angle again, floats this full and across from around the stumps, perhaps the absence of slip fielder induces Dickwella into a drive away from the body. Gets a thick edge that flew off the bat. Sarfraz threw himself to his left instinctively and put his left glove out to take that stunner. Relief in the Pakistan camp for things were starting to slip away very quickly despite all the good work they did last night"
"flatter one on middle and leg, worked wide of midwicket"
"the flipper has done the trick. This is stunning. Dilruwan is late on the shot as this one drifts in and skids on. Would've smashed into middle and leg. Clearly late on the shot.

"starts off with a fierce sweep to the deep square leg boundary. Fetched it from way outside off, connected cleanly"
"brings out the reverse paddle this time and gets enough bat on it to beat short third man. Abbas dives in vain. He's clear about his intentions. Play shots, get as many as possible. Not a bad strategy"

"tripe. Punished. Half-tracker outside off, Mendis rocks back and crashes this into the cover boundary"

"back of length delivery angling into middle, defended"

"slips in a short ball on the stumps from around the wicket, bunted to the off side"

"another top-edge and Sri Lanka are nine down now. Lots of flight and loop on middle and leg, which Mendis reads as a scoring opportunity. Gets low, looks to sweep but plays under the ball slightly. A thick top edge lobs up for Sarfraz to take. Sohail has two wickets in four balls."
"quick outside off, 88 kph, played into the off side towards point"
"and it's all done and dusted. Did it pitch on leg or just outside? <strong>Pradeep wants to review</strong>. Looks like it pitched outside leg. It's quick down leg, and spins away. Pradeep is tentative and plays the wrong line. The ball beats the outside edge and strikes Pradeep in front of leg. No bat. Replays show the ball is pitching in line, hitting in line and umpire's call on impact. That's the innings done, wow, wow, wow. Sri Lanka are done for 96, their ninth-lowest score in Tests. Sohail has three wickets in the over."
"fantastic start. Good length outside off, the ball swinging back in at 128 kph, a thick inside edge into the pad."
"full and very wide outside off, 134 kph, Masood leaves. On the bounce to Dickwella"
"good length outside off, 130 kph, more swing back in, left alone"
"full delivery outside off, lovely length with the new ball. Pushed out to mid-off"
"given! Sri Lanka have their first. <b>Masood has fallen over one and opts to review</b>. Well, looked out to my eye. There is some late swing again from Lakmal. Good length delivery on middle and leg, and it keeps swinging back in. Masood misses his flick and is struck right in front of leg. Two reds, but the ball shows to be climbing over leg stump. Ouch, that's going to hurt Sri Lanka."
"on the pads, 137 kph, clipped down to fine leg for the first run of the innings"
"full and wide outside off, 127 kph, left alone"
"angled across again, 124 kph, left alone, no need to play.<strong> Umpire Llong tells Gamage to get off the danger area</strong>"
"far too wide outside off, 125 kph, no reason for Masood to play there. Gamage nowhere near the danger area on this one"
"fullish delivery outside off, 80 mph, driven to mid-off"
full and wide outside off from around the wicket. Left alone. On the bounce to Dickwella again
"brings this one back in, 127 kph, full and swinging back in, driven to mid-on with the angle of swing"
"good single. Full delivery around off, swing back in, pushed towards mid-off for a quick single"
"two good singles on the bounce. Good length outside off, pushed in front of point, and both batsmen respond well"
"full and wide outside off, 130 kph, angled across, left alone"
"good length on a fifth-stump line, some swing back in, not a lot. Another positive leave"

"136 kph, good length around off, defended towards mid-off"
"126 kph, full on off and middle, worked through to wide mid-on for a run"
"<strong>caught off a no-ball! </strong> Tragedy for Sri Lanka. Gamage looks down, Chandimal looks distraught. Wow, that is very very very marginal from the umpire. Full delivery outside off, swinging away late, lulls Aslam into a drive, takes the outside edge straight to second slip, where Mendis takes it by his face. <strong>That is not a no-ball</strong>, to my eyes. His heel was in the air, just behind the crease, at first point of impact. It slid past the line later."
"full delivery outside off, driven to mid-off"
"taken this time. But the umpires want to check if it has carried. <strong>The soft signal is out</strong>. Good length outside off, not much movement, but it is wide enough for Aslam not to play, but he can't seem to help himself. He guides the dab straight into Mendis' hands, who dives low in front of him. It has carried nicely enough. And that's Sri Lanka's first. Great comeback from Gamage, but a terrible shot from Aslam."
"good length delivery outside off, pushed away into the off side from the crease. Another unnecessary shot, no need to play"
"lovely. Gets this to seam back in at 125 kph, towards off, a thick inside edge towards square leg"
strays down leg this time for an ODI wide. 129 kph. Azhar can't make contact
"good length outside off, fourth-stump channel, 130 kph, defended towards mid-off"
"good stop from the fielder. Good length outside off, tapped away towards point, who dives to his right to keep the pressure on Masood"
"full delivery outside off, 131 kph. Masood plays for some inswing, but it holds its line and beats the bat. Masood shadow-practices the leave after the fact"
"131 kph, ooh late swing again. Looks for the yorker and Masood falls over again. The change in line and length surprises Masood, but it's a tad leg side-ish. Goes down leg for an ODI wide"
"terrific over so far, 132 kph, good length around off, defended into the off side"
"129 kph, good finish. On a length around leg, played into the leg side, towards square leg"
"129 kph, full delivery around off, forcing Azhar to play early in his innings, defended back"
"<strong>another big appeal</strong>, no says umpire Llong, also asking the players to settle down. Full delivery outside off, swinging back in. Azhar is beaten on the inside edge and struck well outside the line of off. One side on top here"
"this is much, much closer and Chandimal reviews this. <strong>Did it strike him in line or not?</strong> That is the only point of contention. The on-field call is not-out. It's full on off, swinging back in. Azhar gets forward but the ball beats him on the inside edge. Umpire's call on impact means the on-field call is retained, but the review is not lost. Sensational seam bowling from Sri Lanka"
"gets to the pitch of the ball, a shimmy down, gets a thick inside edge to square leg"
"full and straight, not a bad option, but Azhar gets some bat on that, just enough to get that very fine down to the fine leg fence"
"good end. Full outside off, Azhar gets forward and blocks it out towards point"

confident push forward as he eases this full delivery to mid-off
"back of length ball angles back in a long way from wide of the crease, Masood, who plays all around it, is beaten for pace and is struck on the top of the pad. Leg stump was visible at the point of impact as he shuffled across. But height was always going to be in question. Although the ball would've hit the top of the bails, it's come down as <b> umpire's call. </b> Sri Lanka don't lose a review though"
"too short and angling into middle and leg, whipped into the gap at midwicket where Herath misfields. So what should've been one is now three. Herath tried to put in a slide but his <b> knee got stuck into the turf </b>, allowing the ball to spin away further."

confident push forward as he blunts this length ball into the off side

"<b> just evades Dilruwan at extra cover. </b> Very clever from Herath. Saw Azhar advancing and threw it wide, he went through with the inside-out slap, didn't get to the pitch of the ball and sent it wide of the infielder. Lucky break"
"this time he steps out to go over mid-on but gets it off a thick inside edge towards midwicket. Herath won't really mind this. At the moment, he has a measure of the batsmen."

"slows it down nicely, Azhar lunges forward and smothers the spin"

"hits the deck hard, gets this to jag away off the deck, Masood gets on top of the bounce and fends it"
"touch ahead of length on off, squared up just a hint but Masood manages to bunt that onto the off side"

"once again pushes forward with an angled bat, rolls to backward point"
squeezes this full delivery on off to point again
"tossed up on off stump, turns away slightly but Azhar has the line of the delivery covered as he defends"

"touch short and angling away at length, defended to the off side off the back foot"
beauty! This is stunning. Gets him to try and drive but the ball nibbles away just a wee bit to miss the outside edge. He was drawn in to the stroke by the length. Pradeep has been excellent in the two overs he's bowled so far.
"steps out, the bowler cleverly shortens his length. Stabbed to the off side"
squeezes this full delivery to the off side again
lunges forward and eases this tossed up delivery to short cover
"drifts in a quicker delivery as Azhar steps out. The ball skids back in to hit the pad off an inside edge. Spontaneous appeal, Dickwella was very confident and gestured to his skipper for a review. He doesn't bite the bait though"
"superb delivery, firstly. Drifts in from around the stumps, pitches this on off and gets this to rip away from the surface. Azhar is beaten by a feeble push. The back foot was briefly in the air but he ensured it was plonked back quickly before the bails came off. <B> The amount of turn on that delivery should encourage Sri Lanka </b>"
"bounce this time, in addition to turn. Azhar goes back into the crease to defend. Surprised that the ball climbed on him, hit the top part of the bat."
"floats a length ball across the left-hander, watched through to the keeper."
"probes away around that off stump again. Invites the drive by pitching it full, Masood isn't interested. Left alone again."
"once again teases him into a drive by pitching it up, Masood lets it go. Again"
"forces this into the gully region, the fielder got a hand on it. This wasn't all that short for him to try and steer it, but at least he moves from 11. Relief. <b> Can hear the cheer in Rawalpindi and Islamabad </b>"

much better. Right to the pitch of the ball as he steps out and lofts this over the bowler's head
beaten by a slider. This one pitches on off and straightens. Masood played for the one that comes back in
"looks to try and get outside the line of the stumps to sweep but gets into some sort of a tangle as the ball drifts in. As a result, he misses the sweep completely. Fortunately for him, he's hit outside off. So even though the ball would've crashed into the stumps it can't be out. <b> Sri Lanka have lost one review </b>"

"there's light at the end of the tunnel for Sri Lanka. Azhar has paid the price for an over-defensive approach. This is tremendous from Pradeep. Lands this length ball just around off, gets this to jag back in. Azhar plays outside the line to get a thick inside edge that pops to a short square leg region. Easily taken. Credit to Chandimal for having a man there."

"good length delivery outside off, played away towards point from the crease"
"use of the feet, runs to the pitch, the ball drifts on and takes the inside edge"
"nicely played again, comes down and drives with the spin to long-off. I don't really like long-off to Masood, he'll be pleased with a riskless one. Make him take the risk?"
"quick and straight, on middle and leg, defended back to the bowler"
"steps out again, the ball drifts on, pad-batted away towards cover"
"edged but well short of slip. Nice length outside off, drawing the batsman forward, thick outside edge on the bounce"

"full outside off, defended back to the bowler"
"full delivery outside off, 127 kph, angling back in, defended up to mid-off"
"ooii, 129 kph, full and straight, the yorker. Masood looks to flick that square instead of jamming it out. A leading edge back to the bowler"
"full delivery outside off, pushed awkwardly to mid-on. Masood on 19 off almost 16 overs"
"137 kph, full on off, swinging back in, driven to a short mid-on, who throws the ball back towards the keeper. The loudest the crowd has been today"
"a slower delivery on off to finish, blocked out"
"given! And Pakistan lose another. Their slump continues. It's the absolute perfect length from Dilruwan, full but not full enough for Sohail to smother, short but not short enough for Sohail to go back to. Sohail prods, but because it wasn't too full, the ball had room to turn. It did. It took the outside edge and Dickwella hung on. Fantastic delivery, a turning pitch would have taken that past the outside edge."

"77 mph, full delivery outside off, defended. Another tidy maiden"

"shortish and wide outside off, Masood cuts this down past slip for a couple. Backward point cuts it off"
"another one! Masood follows the ball and edges it behind. It's Dilruwan's length again. Short delivery outside off, Masood is on the front foot, a good sign that he clearly misread the length of the ball - that was definitely short enough to go back to. The ball turns away, takes the outside edge and Dickwella takes another good catch. Let his hands go chasing after the ball."
"drifts down leg, clipped to midwicket"
"a two-ball duck for Azam. Pakistan are falling away rapidly. Mickey Arthur, well, let's just say that I've seen him happier. It's quick and straight from Dilruwan, Azam plays from the crease, not sure whether to go forward or go back, the ball takes the inside edge and carries low to leg gully, who dives in front of him and snaffles it up. Dilruwan's length has been impeccable"
"intent right away. Flat on middle and leg, driven to a deep mid-on. Dilruwan gets to his right and collides with Shafiq, who gets up quickly and makes the crease with a full-length dive. An apology from Shafiq, not sure why, he is entitled to hold his own path"

"hits the deck hard at length on off stump, defended with soft hands"
shows the full face of the bat in defending this back to the bowler
looks to flick but the ball stops on him just a little bit. He was through the shot early as well. Lobs uppishly but there's no one at short mid-on so it's safe
"gets this to snake back in just a little from outside off, Sarfraz gets a thick inside edge towards midwicket"
right behind the line of that length ball as he defends
"shapes to drive, played outside the line, the thick inside edge rolls to the off side off the pad"

"clean strike, inside-out over extra cover. Stepped out, made some room and lofted this into the gap"
"angles across the batsman a short delivery, Sarfraz ducks under it"
"doesn't get hold of the pull, down to deep square leg"
has he gloved this? Adventurous pull to a short ball down leg. Played too early and missed.
"ducks under another short ball, this one doesn't rise as much as he would've liked"
this is predictably poor. Another short ball but way down leg. Shafiq avoids it without a hassle
"another attempted strangle down leg. Shafiq looks to tickle it fine but misses. <strong>Again, not far from his gloves</strong>"
<strong>Pradeep doesn't pick the ball cleanly at point.</strong> It was always going to be a tight single. Hint of hesitation between both batsmen
"slider on middle and leg from around the stumps, defended with soft hands"
"steps out but the ball is much shorter and spins sharply as well, he somehow manages to stab it away"
"launched over midwicket. Drifting in this time, not much turn so he steps out, gets close to the ball and clears the infield. Gutsy given he was beaten while trying to step out off the previous delivery"
"swept from middle stump, towards deep square. Lakmal caught napping, they're back for the second easily"

"may have been the slower ball, around off, 122 kph, played towards midwicket"

"shortish around off, pushed towards cover from the back foot"
"quick on the pads, 85 kph, played into the leg side."
"very very risky, but that shot was made easier by dancing down, and ensuring the ball couldn't spin past one edge. It could still go through his inside edge, but he gets his bat down in time, and flicks through square leg"
"overpitched and straight, pushed back to the bowler"
"a short slower ball outside off, carved to deep point"
"good length around off, 135 kph from around the wicket, defended back"
"another short delivery outside off, but it's wide outside off, 83 mph, Shafiq gets underneath it"
"another bouncer on middle, 133 kph, Shafiq hurries underneath"
"lovely batting. 79 mph, short on the ribs. Doesn't get up and Shafiq picks his battles, this one is an easier one to win because it's more in his range, pulled to the deep backward square leg boundary. Rolled his wrists on that"

"whoa. A good length delivery around off, Shafiq tries to swing this into Abu Dhabi, but under-edges his hoick into the leg side. A percentage stroke though, picked the length and the area. Just failure to execute"

another dead-bat block off the front foot. A clap from Azhar in the pavilion
"tossed up outside off, kept out."
"quick down leg, on the pads, Shafiq misses the ball, no inside edge. Chandimal chooses to review. Does not like like there is bat on that. Yeah, no bat, no glove and that will mean <b>Sri Lanka's reviews are done</b>. Hit the pad en route to short leg"
"uses his feet, gets to the pitch and drives back to the bowler. That will be stumps on day 4."
"on the pads to start, Sarfraz tucks one run through square leg to reduce Pakistan's target to 118. I'm already counting runs down, I'll stop."
"four runs. 134 kph, on the pads again from Pradeep. Shafiq moves into the 90s. Shafiq just clips it off his pad down to the fine leg fence"

"shortish delivery on the pads, 85 mph, clipped off the pad to deep square leg for another run"
"134 kph, good length delivery outside off, a punchy angled cut to point. That fielder is in for now, a boundary or two, and that will be one easy run"

"flight outside off, 85 kph, driven towards mid-off"
"there's four more. 84 kph, short and wide outside off, Sarfraz goes back and carves a cut behind point. Too much width, help yourself"

"a tight run. Was that really needed? A yorker on off, carved towards backward point for a quick single. The throw misses the stumps at the batsman's end"
"fullish delivery outside off, blocked back"
that may push that fielder back. It's short and wide outside off and Shafiq nails his square cut into the gap at extra cover. Got on top of the bounce and properly executed. <strong>Moves to 99</strong>
"Dickwella is excited. Flat and wide outside off, more drift. Sarfraz misses a sweep and Dickwella whips the bails off. Umpire Llong wants to check <b>with the third umpire</b>, but Sarfraz gets his feet back just in time? Or does he? Juuuust in time, enough doubt to keep Sarfraz in, I reckon."
"pushed through, full outside off, played into the off side"
"quick on off., 85 kph, driven with the spin to long-on"
"and that is Shafiq's century. Whips off his helmet, and lets out a cry of joy. Mickey Arthur is smiling again. Gets low and paddles a sweep fine to fine leg. <strong>Sensational counter-attacking ton</strong>"
"short and wide again, too much width. Guided down to third man, where the deep backward point fielder has to get across"
"<b>dropped? Carried?</b> 54 mph, flight outside off, Dilruwan has continually been getting drift this afternoon, this one goes on with the arm, takes the edge, and goes low to Karunaratne at slip. He gets forward, but the ball slips out. Definitely carried, should have been taken."
"on the pads down leg, worked away down to deep backward square leg"
"a change in length, short down leg, Shafiq gets underneath it"
"just short of leg gully. 80 mph, short on the ribs, the ball hits the chest guard. But does it take the glove? <strong>No, only thigh pad</strong>."
"128 kph, short down leg, worked away for a single down to deep square leg"

"flight outside off, 87 kph, smothered"
"shortish delivery around off, played into the leg side awkwardly"
"quick around off, defended into the cover region. No one there, so one"
"and taken by Pradeep at deep backward square leg. Extra bounce? Flat delivery outside off, it's drift again. Sarfraz stays low and looks to sweep, but the ball bounces extra and takes the top edge. Pradeep misjudges the catch, runs in and to his left, and in again, and then to his left again before settling decently under the catch. Anyway will do. Sri Lanka are pumped. This will open an end up. he has been playing that stroke really well, but unlike yesterday, Dilruwan has been getting plenty of drift today."
"86 kph, flight outside off, driven towards cover. Shafiq wants a run, but Chandimal is quick to the ball"
"full delivery outside off, left alone."
"good length around off, defended back up the pitch"
"a flirty waft. The ball moves away to beat the bat. On a length outside off, excellent bowling. Now can he get one to hold its line?"

"flight around off, defended"
"short down leg, 86 kph, worked away past short leg for one"
"quick on the pads, 91 kph, four down to fine leg. Just a tickle down, this is good batting. Accounted for the fact that the ball will not turn because it's new."
"<strong>a wild swing</strong>. Waaaailld. Flat outside off, Amir looks to slog sweep but the ball is wide outside off and keeps low."
"and out the following ball. Amir opts to review after umpire Kettleborough gives him out. It's quick on off, the ball drifts on, it's the new ball after all. Amir gets forward, but the ball misses the inside edge by a distance. There are two reds, and the one point of contention - impact, is umpire's call. Soooo close. Dilruwan gets five. And Pakistan have now lost seven"
"quick through the air, full around off, defended into the leg side"
"126 kph, another one. And is that the game? <b>Pakistan review again</b>. Gamage strikes. It's a nippy inswinger that swings in prodigiously, in the air and then off the pitch too. It has come back from well outside off and struck Shafiq in front of middle, like a ripping offbreak. So much swing that the ball misses the leg stump and Pakistan stay alive."
"good length delivery outside off, dabbed towards deep point, 79 mph. That one did not swing. Shafiq happy to trust Yasir"

"quick around off, smothered away into the leg side"
"chips down to the pitch, 89 kph, Shafiq leading-edges this towards long-off to retain strike"
"another easy single. Good length delivery outside off, pushed towards cover for a run. The sweeper point fielder runs around to keep them down to one"
"124 kph, on a length outside off, defended into the off side"
"shortish and wide outside off, 127 kph. Yasir sways out of the line"
"fuller than a good length outside off, 128 kph, watchfully defended. Showing good discipline"
"another drifty delivery. Full down leg, Shafiq misses a flick and is struck on the pad well down leg. Sliding down"
"124 kph, full delivery outside off, Yasir is lulled into a drive because of that length, but the ball<strong> rips back in</strong> to beat his inside edge. Wow, that one moved back in, offcutter? Seam-up, just jagged back in."
"quick down leg, 83 kph, off the inside edge down to fine leg"

"good length, angles into the pad. And takes the inside edge on the way as he looks to flick"
"tossed up outside off stump, leans into it and drives to long-off"
"back of a length, straight through outside off stump. Doesn't accept the offer to swipe away from the body, leaves it alone"
"good length at off stump, defended down the pitch"
"<b>stumping appeal. It looks very close.</b> A superb delivery from Herath, dipping at middle stump, and beating the outside edge. <b>And he's out.</b> You have very little chance against this man if you're a lower-order bat. Slow, loopy ball at middle and leg draws Yasir into the drive. He goes against the turn and doesn't get to the pitch. Long, long way down. So long down that Dickwella, who doesn't gather it cleanly, has time to untangle himself and let it roll into his gloves, before taking the bails offf"
"good length at off stump, defended into the off side"
"<b>taken at fly slip!</b> A stunning catch by Kusal Mendis! Is that the game? You'd think so. This is back of a length, swinging away from off stump. He reaches out at it on the front foot and it rises on him. Thick outside edge that hangs low to Mendis' right and he gets his hands under it before tumbling to hold on. A superb innings from Shafiq, but he won't take them home this time"
"back of a length, angled down leg side. Looks to flick but tickles it to the keeper off this thigh guard"

"good length at off stump, defended into the off side"
"arm ball, sliding into off stump. Hurriedly tapped to extra cover off the back foot"

"back of a length at middle stump, defended to mid-on from the crease"

"<b>in the air and taken at extra cover.</b> Floated up at off stump, dipping rapidly as he steps out. He gets too far away from it as he looks to slash and sends it straight up in the air. Chandimal steadies himself and holds on"
