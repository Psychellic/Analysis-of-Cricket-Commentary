<strong>Danushka tears to his left from long-off </strong>and intercepts this fierce inside-out drive from Mushfiq. The batsman made room and hit over the top. Excellent stop from the fielder
"<b>Jeevan strikes first ball!</b> Pays the price for the reverse sweep. It's the straighter one on leg stump, impact's outside leg stump as well and Sarkar's caught in all sorts of trouble. Seems to have pulled a muscle somewhere as he misses the swipe and crashes onto the floor. Hops out of the ground with the help of his team-mates. Was in no position to play that shot. Unlucky for Sarkar, though, since impact was clearly outside leg stump."
"full on middle and leg, tries to slog at it by getting down on one knee, straight to midwicket"
"<b>smart work from the keeper!</b> And that's disaster for the debutant. It's a full ball on leg stump, turns across Afif as it hits his thigh, but the ball takes the back of his bat as it comes down.

"gives it a big rip, pitches full outside off, tapped towards the off side past point for a quick single. Gives the strike back to Mahmudullah"

"sticks with the short stuff! On middle stump, and hooked towards the leg side"
"<b>sweeet!</b> Expects the full ball now, and that's what he gets. Backs away as the bowler delivers, it's pitched full on off stump, and he smashes this drive past cover. Long off can't get to it. <b>That's the team 150</b>"
"change of pace, but bad line. Full on leg stump but going down the leg side. Gotta bowl that once again"
"full on middle and leg, tries to flick towards midwicket but deceived by the lack of pace. Hits his back pad, but would've gone down leg side anyway. They scamper across for a run"
"waist-high full toss outside off, slashes hard at it and runs it down to third man. The batsman looks at the square-leg umpire asking for the no ball. He's not happy, and rightfully so, since it was definitely above the waist line. But not given. Touch and go to be honest"
<b>shouts of caught behind!</b> But the umpire signals a wide. Pitches it full outside off and always angling away. Tries to drive but misses. The batsman smiles and tells the bowler that he did not edge it. Nice touch

"yorker on off stump, dug away to point for his <b>fifty!</b> His second in T20Is. The Bangladesh camp applaud as the batsmen hug it out"

"yorker to end the over, off the bat's toe end as it's nudged to wide mid on. Terrific end to the over for Sri Lanka"
"<b>outside edge, but safe!</b> Full outside off, and he chases at it. Takes the top edge, but flies past the keeper's right. Would've been a four if it wasn't for the effort of Shehan at third man. Diving effort stops the boundary"
"<b>tries the scoop, but doesn't come off!</b> Taken by short fine leg. Full outside off, and the captain walks across to the off side to paddle it away. Can't execute it, as the ball comes off the bat's top half. Comfortably taken by Dananjaya. A smart innings comes to an end"

"Mendis steps out, meets a full-toss, and cracks it to long-off"
"Mushfiqur thinks he has his man stumped. Yes, Mushfiq dismisses Danushka. Maiden international wicket for Nazmul. Nice drop in pace. He held this back though he did not find much turn. Danushka stretches out for an ambitious slog-sweep but only collects fresh air. He can't ground his back leg in time. Swift, nifty work from Mushfiq, and Mirpur roars in approval"

"good length on leg stump, flicked off his pads to deep midwicket on this occasion"

"quicker ball on middle and leg. Darted straight in, and Perera mistimes his leg-side flick. Comes off his pads, as the ball trickles away to square leg"
"<b>reverse sweep!</b> But only for a single. Did well to swipe at this full ball on middle stump, but the diving effort at point saves the boundary"
