finds the single at long-off.
keeps the front foot away from interfering with a sumptuous on-drive
<b>slog sweep</b> and it goes miles! He has to reach out to meet the ball off the middle of the bat - but Fakhar doesn't care if he goes off balance. He still has this magical ability to generate power. And Kuldeep watches the ball sails over midwicket
"direct hit at the striker's end from Jadeja, but Babar appears to be home. Yep. Well judged single from Fakhar, dropping the ball with soft hands at cover"
"follows the ball, looking for a leg glance, which can be risky with leg gully in play. The turn is too much"

a gentle little love tap to long-off.
"firm push past the left of cover, and that wakes the crowd up. They've clearly forgotten India have a man in the deep there. Hehehe."
"stays back despite the flight on this ball, but on a slow pitch, he can take that liberty. Neat little flick to long leg and good running gets them a couple."
a whirl of the wrists as Babar sends a leg break on leg stump to think about life at long-on
"gets the freedom to swing and swing he does - another slog sweep, another boundary. Fakhar is reading the line of the bowler very very well."
"<b>he's sprawled all over the pitch and he's also out lbw</b>! Fakhar loses his balance as he strides out, tempted by yet another loopy treat from Kuldeep. The studs on his front foot fail him and he takes a proper tumble, and more or less falls on top of the ball. All in front of middle and leg stump - which gives umpire Tucker the leeway to get that forefinger up. <b>Replays by the way indicate Fakhar managed a glove on the ball</b> before it hit his body and had he reviewed, he might have saved himself."

the million-dollar drive to deep cover. Babar is gorgeous when he is in full flow
"<b>Babar's run-out</b> and it's the price of a little bit of greed from his captain. Sarfraz taps an innocuous delivery away to point and looks for a single. He takes a few steps out, which then signals Babar to get his skates on. Eventually, Sarfraz realises he'll never make it and sends his young gun back. But the fielder Chahal has spotted the opportunity and sends a stinging throw to Jadeja, who does the rest"

full face of the bat - almost an apologetic one as he concentrates on putting the run-out from his mind.
"good length and outside off, he defends it well"
welcomes the ball on his pads with a stinging clip to long leg. Ouch!
he looks a little tentative against Bumrah's pace and his angle from wide of the crease. Has enough composure to push the short ball into the covers though

"a touch short, allowing Sarfraz to go back and punch to long-off"

drills a flighted delivery to long-on
"sneaks in the round-armed delivery - but manages to keep it on middle stump. Sarfraz knows he can't play across the line, lest he open himself up for lbw. Single to long-on."
swings hard at a short ball - but it just doesn't rise up high enough for Malik to get under. Jadhav says his lack of bounce is key to his bowling
"creams it to the cover boundary! Sarfraz gives a withering stare at the ball, after having bullied it away with a straight bat and a lot of power"
leans into it and gets a single at deep cover
"and more runs! Malik is a genius at assessing the middle overs, and spin bowling. Here he picks the short ball, makes a little room and carves it behind point where all the sexy gaps are"
backs away and prepares the ball for takeoff over cover. But mission control bamboozles him with a googly and the inside edge goes to long-on instead
"thrusts his hands at a quicker, flatter delivery on middle and sends it to midwicket"
gets forward to block in front of off stump
"lobs it up wide of off stump, but Malik is content to hug the crease and spear the ball through cover point. Good running as well. Both of em are sweating buckets, but the're not missing run-scoring opportunities"
big stride forward to deflect a legbreak on middle to midwicket
eases it through the covers to retain strike
"searches for a single behind point, but the open face doesn't do him any good, steering the ball straight to the fielder. Might wanna return that at the store"

manages to keep away from the lbw trap by doing the one thing he needs to - especially after falling over a straight ball - putting his bat out and turning the ball away to midwicket
the good length ball doesn't come on to the bat and Sarfraz's drive on the up ends up an inside edge

"he's at the ball before it arrives, outside off, and ends up directing it to midwicket when his intention was to push it to long-off"
"lovely work from Sarfraz, waits on the short ball outside off and guides it to deep third man."
"<b>fifty for Malik</b>, the second one in two games, and he gets there with a no-fuss flick through midwicket. Dubai rises to salute a fine batsman. His work isn't done yet though. Malik isn't just Pakistan's best accumulator, he's their best finisher too"
"good length outside off, punches to cover. <b>That's drinks</b>"
thrusts his hands at the ball outside off and guides it neatly to the left of cover
beautiful shot - it looks like Sarfraz's confidence is flooding back. These are the shots he played against Herath in the dying light in Sharjah in that epic Test. Backing away from the ball and launching it over extra cover
slices it through cover
"quicker delivery on middle, Malik blocks it"
pushes his bat in front of his body for a single ot long-on
"steps out of his crease but Jadeja gets the warning sign and responds to it well, shortening his length and pushing it wider outside off. The Pakistan captain ends up defending a ball he clearly wanted to attack"

"the legbreak now, drifting outside off, drawing Sarfraz to flick around his front pad."
"googly again - pitching outside leg, allowing Sarfraz an easy single with a sweep shot"
eases a loopy delivery outside off to cover
"good length on middle, he keeps it out"
"wanders back into his crease, meets the googly with a roll of the wrists and finds a quick single behind square leg. Excellent batting against spin. He's using the advantage given to him by a slow pitch, and he's doing so by moving his feet and reading the length of the ball early and decisively"
feral roar from the crowd as Malik  sends it out of the park. Once again it's the footwork - and to come down the track against Jadeja is never easy. Having done that though he launches the 99 kph delivery straight over the bowler's head. Magic
taps it towards point
"he's stepping out too - but he goes slogging at the ball, dragging it from outside off to deep midwicket"
steps away from the quicker delivery on leg stump and chops it towards point
"looks for a single after blocking a flatter delivery on middle, but Sarfraz don't want it"
eases it to the sweeper cover
"too short from Kuldeep and Malik hammers it away to deep square leg. Supreme fitness from the two Pakistani batsmen, picking up a couple having batted for hours in the horrid heat."
"the wrong 'un, tossed up on leg stump, Malik does well not to play against the turn, as the line is asking him to do"
"another googly, which Malik calmly puts in front of point for a single"
three on the trot that turn the other way and Sarfraz - having made room well before Kuldeep released the ball - cuts it away through point
"that's tame! He's been slowly amping up his strike-rate, calmly going for the big shots, making India fret, making Pakistan hope. And he throws it all away with a little poke to cover. The wristspinner works his magic and Sarfraz walks away, throwing his head back in disgust. He was looking to clear the infield but just doesn't get enough elevation"
"tosses it up on middle, Malik defends"
a little bit of swing into the right-hander - <b>reverse?</b>. Malik blocks it well
"slower ball outside off, Malik dabs it to deep third man"
exploits the width on offer with a tap to deep third man
"more curl into the right-hander and a <b>direct hit would have had Malik!</b>. For once he's off his bearings, poking the ball to point, where India's best fielder is, and looking for a run that isn't there. Jadeja has one stump to aim at but it proves too difficult even for him"
"taps a short ball to the left of midwicket and manages another quick single. Oooooh, this is tight too. The tension's building again"
"good length on middle, he pushes it down the ground"
"fullish length on leg stump, stays back and blocks"
"length ball that comes on straight, tucked to midwicket for another <b>very tight single</b>. Kuldeep doesn't collect the ball cleanly but probably needed a direct hit. Pakistan living on the edge"

"spins in from a length, tucked away to the left of square leg who moves across and cuts it off"
"back of a length, a wrong'un that spins away outside off, punched back"

"length outside off, reaches out late for a touch down to third man"
"length on off, sitting up nicely for Asif who frees his arms and slaps it straight over long-on. Game on in Dubai"
"tries to take this away from the batsman but overcompensates with the length, it's too full, and Asif simply reaches out and drills it away square of the wicket on the off side"
"now he switches back to a length ball but he's giving Asif too much width outside off. These are ripe for the hitting, well inside his swinging arc, and shovelled over long-on. Big over"
"<b>direct hit needed, India miss again</b>. Just taps a short of a length delivery to point, and takes flight. And it's Jadeja, that most electric of fielders, who has shy. Not quite his day"
shifts back to a length and nudges it to the square leg region
clips a fuller one off the pads to the left of deep square leg and pushes back for the second
waits on the backfoot and taps a wrong'un to midwicket
"floats it up wide outside off, takes it away from him, Asif gets down and has a big swing but can't reach out enough"
worked away to deep square leg from the crease
"gets forward and pushes a fuller one, slanted across his off-stump, into the covers"
uses the angle to turn a length ball away to deep midwicket
"ah, well done! Extremely full from Bumrah, chokes him with lack of room as well, Asif squeezes it out between the legs to deep fine leg"
"very full again, can't do much to get underneath those, drilled away through the covers"
"has he nudged that away to the keeper? Yup, he has. Malik walks off. No review. Huge, huge wicket. At a crucial juncture. Not quite the end Malik would've imagined. A length ball, angled into Malik, who looks for a nice little help-along to fine leg, finds the edge instead, and Dhoni gets down to his left behind the stumps to snaffle it"
tries ti flick and the ball raps the pad instead before skipping away into the leg side. Would've missed leg with that angle
"angles a yorker into him, squeezed away to deep backward square for one"
goes back to a length ball and punches to long-on
gets the front foot across and guides a sweep to deep backward square leg
"gets down for a reverse sweep, has to fetch it from outside his leg stump, miscues it off the top-edge, Kuldeep runs back from backward point and it <b>drops in front of him</b>. They push back for the third, and Shadab puts in the dive that takes him over the line as Dhoni breaks the stumps"
stays back and whips this down to long-on
"swings wildly for a big slog, misses the line completely. Zero room offered by Chahal, dead straight and accurate on middle, it's the googly, so doesn't give him the room he needs to connect with that shot and flattens middle stump. They check for the front foot, <b>he's landed it just inside. 50th ODI wicket for Chahal</b>"
tucks away a length ball to midwicket
"length ball, sharp angle into him, results in an inside edge as he chops it into the ground and past the stumps"
"short, angled across, waits and opens the face to drop it to point for a quick one"
"full, angled in on off, gets forward and crunches it to cover, where Chahal flings himself full-length to his right and makes a <b>brilliant save</b>"
"very full, angled into off, this is very accurate bowling, dug out to point"
"slower length ball, waits for it and slaps it but can't find his gap. Jadeja is impenetrable at point"
brilliant bowlng. Angles a yorker into his middle stump and it's pushed out to the man at cover. Great over from Bumrah. Pakistan's progress has been seriously stalled here
"tries to take it away from the batsman and slants it well across his off-stump, just inside"
"again, gets him to reach out, and Nawaz stabs it out through point"
"this one's closer to off, punched through the gap between cover and point"
"comes forward to a fuller one on leg stump, but it turns and finds the outside of the bat before running away to point"
"lovely bowling. Full, quick, and sharp outside off, reaches out for a cut and misses"
"throws his arms at a wide shorter one, slaps it over the in-field. Had to reach out again, so off the bottom of the bat, but enough to carry over the deep extra cover boundary"
"yorker outside off, backs away and squeezes it out to third man"
gets some width and slaps it away just wide of extra cover. Sharp single
"extremely full on off, sharp angle into the right-hander, dug out off the inside of the bat to midwicket"
"very, very full, so hard to get underneath those, stays stapled to the crease and makes no contact as the ball goes to Dhoni"
"he's like a machine programmed to delivery only yorkers. This one's around leg and tucks him up completely, nothing the batsman can do about it"
"and finishes the over up with another one, Nawaz manages to push this one out to mid-off for a quick one"
Bhuvneshwar takes over from where Bumrah left and fires a yorker on middle that's dug out straight down the ground. India giving nothing away at the death
sees the batsman backing away and follows him with a yorker that's dug out to the right of the bowler
"walks away early, presumable looking to paddle him away but Bhuvi fires a wide full toss and Nawaz is forced to change plans and slap it to long-off"
gets down for a sweep but this fuller one skips down the leg side
"extremely full, angled in towards middle and off, drills it away to backward point where Jadeja moves to his right in a jiffy and stops it"
"full, very full outside off, makes an effort to get behind the line but can only knock it down to long-off"
"rare error from Bhuvi, gets the yorker wrong and offers up a full toss that goes unpunished. Miscued to deep midwicket for just one"
"follows up the good work from the previous over, another yorker that finds the inside of the bat and goes away to square leg"
"fullish, lots of room, shovels with lot of bottom-hand power to mid-off who is slightly back. <b>Direct hit would've been curtains</b>"
top-class bowling at the death. He's so accurate. Shadab stays leg side and desperately swings and swings hard. Gets an inside edge onto the back pad before it deflects onto the stumps. Have India choked Pakistan out of this game here?
"how does he keep doing this? Another yorker, angled in sharply, worked away to deep fine leg off the inside part of the bat"
squeezes another fuller one to point
"very very full, angled in and tucking him up, worked away to square leg off the inside of the bat. Just one"
"cautious against the Amir inswinger, Rohit defends with soft hands, and doesn't want to quite press too far across either"
"enjoys the pace on the ball as he watches it arrive beside him, cutting behind point. He's standing outside of his crease to negate Amir's sideways movement"
"<b>oooh</b>, there's the ball, pitching in line with the stumps and shaping just a touch into the right-hander. Rohit - by keeping his front foot from moving too far across - meets it with the middle of his bat"
opens the face as he ushers a good length ball in line with the stumps to the luxurious surrounds of deep third man
angles into the left-hander and Dhawan has an easy time flicking to deep square leg. Loud roars from the fans as India get a couple of runs
"<b>falls short</B> of Shadab at point! That would have been an epic blow to India's chances, losing their captain in the first over. Might have worried Rohit too if he fell to Amir again, not least because he absolutely cracks this short of a length ball behind square on the off side"
"oooh, he's lucky. Starts with a wide half-volley but it's so far outside off that Dhawan's ends up miscuing the drive to point"
"<b<yorker</b>, with hints of tail into the right-hander. Good on Rohit to keep his backlift low and jam the bat down"
"<B>beauty</B>! Rohit covers the swing into the right-hander, but he's not prepared for the ball pitching and going on with the left-armer's angle. Snarls past his outside edge. Absolutely snarls"
three fielders hunt down a defensive push into the covers. Pakistan are switched on. It happens when watching an 18-year old quick give it his all
"<b>another yorker</b>, this time outside off, Rohit is equal to it again"
covers the line of a length ball on middle.
comes in at a good height outside off for Dhawan to ease to backward point
"takes a risk to get his runs - walking across his stumps, tempting lbw, but Dhawan doesn't expose his front foot, instead making sure he is nice and balanced to play the flick to the left of mid-on"
punches the back of a length ball to cover
"nice and full, hunting Dhawan's off stump, but a straight bat protects it ferociously"
"excellent placement! He's brilliant square of the off side and here he takes a pretty decent ball - back of a length, in line with perhaps fifth stump - and coaxes it through the gap to the left of point."
"now to third man, showing off his cut shot, waiting until the ball practically passes him to find the gap. Skillful batting. Probing bowling. Engrossing cricket."
"forces him back with a short ball on middle and off stump, Dhawan pats it to cover"
"epic timing again! He reads the line so early, the ball angling into his pads, and after that it was all a matter of getting into position, staying balanced and finding the gap to the left of mid-on"
"<b>inside edge</b> as Dhawan gets sucked in the slipstream of his own aggression. A tad slower in pace from Afridi, dangled temptingly wide of off stump. The left-hander flays at it and nearly ends up bowled"
"short of a length and outside off, he ships it off to point with all the necessary stamps"
"imperious cover drive from Dhawan, hitting on the up, proving this is a batting beauty, at least with the new ball under lights. Good on Imam to cover the ball at, well, cover"
"another ambitious shot from Dhawan - he's definitely feeling it. For now though, he has to settle for an inside edge back at the bowler. Not quite full enough for the cover drive"
away-swing for the right-armer. Hasan Ali introduces himself with a 140 kph delivery outside off and for half a second Rohit thought about playing it
"the Indian captain at his very best! He is perhaps their best player of the short ball - the ability to pick the length early and then shift his weight back, it's almost primal, sowed into his very being. And he shows it all off here with soul-crippling pull shot, if you're a fast bowler"
"back of a length and outside off, Rohit stands up tall and knocks it down"
"angled into off stump, Rohit covers the line and nudges it into the leg side"
"shortish and outside off, punches to deep point"
"full and outside off, he drives to cover"
closes the bat face after letting the back of a length ball come to him and finds square leg lurking
"you can't bowl there! It's dreadfully short - rising only up to his hips - and it's also on leg stump. Rohit finishes yawning, reading a book, messaging a friend and then pulls it over long leg to put it out of its misery"
"nice and full now, drawing Rohit forward with a block to the right of cover"
"<b>dropped</b> by Imam at cover! After three drops in the last gave, Pakistan still insist on breaking their young fast bowler's spirit. Rohit is surprised by a good length ball stopping on him and his on the up drive sits up for an easy chest-high catch. And yet.."
"fullish on off stump, blocks"
careful about not letting that bat push too far ahead of his body after that chance earlier in the over. Good defence from Rohit
"beautiful, beautiful shot. Just makes use of Hasan's pace and angle to hang back and open the face to place it square of the fielder at deep fine leg"
"length ball, slanted across on middle from over the wicket, defended back"
"pushes at a full ball with hard hands, Hasan's angles are sharp and he doesn't cover for it enough, gets an <b>outside edge through the empty cordon</b>"

"length ball, angles in from wide of the crease towards off, Dhawan punches off the backfoot to point"
"shortish outside off, stands tall and waits for it to come on before steering it away to deep backward point"
"shovelled over covers. Can't be offering so much room, especially to a batsman who tends to read lengths so early and gets in position. Just frees his arms to smash it over the in-field"
"much better, fuller of a good length and straight on middle and leg, Rohit quietly defends back"
"short of good length around middle, gets a bit of extra bounce, Rohit drops it into the surface as he tries to get on top of it"
comes forward and turns a length ball away to midwicket
"slides it across to Dhawan's off-stump, and he clips it to mid-on off the front foot"
gets down to sweep but manages no contact as the ball skips down the leg side
"stays back to a length ball and wears it on the pad as he tries to whip it away. Pitched outside leg, and hitting outside leg as well"
"teases by getting the backfoot out and then moving back, Nawaz fires it wide and Dhawan cuts to backward point"
"Dhawan's trying to force something here, gets down and sweeps without getting enough room, just makes enough contact to tickle it away to short fine where Shaheen makes a diving stop"
stays back to a length ball and blocks to cover
"good length on off, defended to point"
"just back of a length, slower at 122ks, stays back and punches to point"
"oh, shot! Walks across early towards off and just walks into a forward press and push down the ground, between long-on and long-off. Laser-guided"
"again, walks across towards off, but this time gets an accurate straight length ball that he keeps out on the front foot"
"short of a length on off, stands tall and stabs it to point"
"beautifully played.. he's playing some stunning shots here, and this one's as good as any he's played tonight. Walks across early towards off to get behind the line and just pushes it easily past long-on's left. Another pristine boundary. India take the first Powerplay"
"short of good length, spinning away outside off, whipped off the backfoot to long-on"
"slants across a fuller one, Dhawan presses forward and knocks it between cover and point"

gets the front foot out and drives past Nawaz's left to long-on
"sllder into the pads, pushed out into the off side off the outside of the bat"
"short, extra bounce outside off as Dhawan <b>tries to cut and misses</b>"
"floated up on off, driven to long-on for one"
"length, sliding into leg and Rohit tucks to square leg with the turn"
shifts back to a fuller length and blocks
"back of a length, goes on with the arm outside off, punched past extra cover"
short but doesn't sit up as well for Dhawan who goes too hard on the pull and mistimes it to deep midwicket
"full, pushed across off, Dhawan pushes into the cover and puts pressure on Shadab for a rapid single"
"pitched up and curving in on middle, pushed to cover"

"full, sliding into leg, blocked"
"pitched up on middle, driven to wide long-off"
"slid across on off, pushed into cover for a very quick single"
"full on leg, eased with the angle down to long-on"
threatens to move down and then comes back into position before blocking
"pushes it through on off stump, trying not to turn the ball, Rohit plays it late and well"
attempts a late cut to a googly - a well disguised one at that - and gets an inside edge. Poor Shadab has his hands on his head as it wanders away towards the covers
"drifts into the pads and turns further inward, striking Dhawan on the back foot. Half an appeal from Shadab. No chance he's getting that"
calmly taps it behind square leg
"<b>extra bounce</b> which Rohit deals with well, hanging back, using soft hands to find midwicket"
leans into a lovely drive away to deep cover
beautiful shot! Gets down low to sweep a fairly rapid delivery on middle stump - which tends to be one of the more dangerous ones to play that shot - but Rohit pulls it off with class
drops it to the left of cover for an easy single
"skips out to meet the flatter delivery on leg stump, and realising he doesn't have room for the big shot, defends"
smoothly pushes the half-volley on leg stump to long-on
"looks to swindle a single behind point, opening the face as he defends the ball, but short third man denies Rohit the chance"
"sees a poor ball outside off, gleefully rocks back and carves it away behind point. Sensible batting from the India captain"
lovely flight - and drift away from the left-hander - Dhawan is wary of the threat as he defends with soft hands
"feigns a move to leg stump, which might have made Shadab stray on the pads. Dhawan happily picks up his single at square leg"
"premeditates a lap sweep and sets off for a single, but Amir at short fine leg cuts the angle well"
"teases Rohit outside off, daring him to go for the big booming cover drive. Rohit stares at it suspiciously - not unlike my mum when I used to tell her I'd finished all my homework - and then lets it go"
"length ball outside off, he steers it to sweeper cover"
"shapes to sweep - but then stays upright seeing the ball at quicker pace and flatter trajectory - pulling the ball towards the square leg boundary. Desperate dive from Shaheen at the boundary, but it's not quite enough to deny <b>Dhawan his fifty</b>"
lovely high elbow as Rohit punches the short ball outside off through to sweeper cover
"vicious! This is one of Pakistan's best wicket-takers but he looks tamer than a hologram, bowling a silly short ball and getting hammered straight of midwicket"
slower ball is Hasan's reply and Dhawan calmly turns it behind square leg
"<B>strikes him on the back pad</b> with the back of a length ball skidding through to Rohit. He weathers an appeal for lbw, but it is too high"
"full on middle, Rohit works it through midwicket"
"looks for a cut shot, but gets an outside edge that scurries away to deep third man"
deflects behind square leg to bring up India's hundred. He has to do it the hard way though with his front foot planted across all his stumps
"low full toss, which Rohit is happy to put away to long-on"
fierce again! Dhawan steps out of his crease - daring personified - gets to the pitch of a legbreak drifting across him and thumps it straight down the ground. Good ball turned into a half-volley by good footwork
quicker and flatter - as Dhawan expects it to be - and he flicks behind square leg
"shimmy down the pitch again, and turns the googly, with the turn, through midwicket"
drags his length short and Dhawan is quick on the cut

"shortish and outside off, cuts to point"
"length ball on middle, Rohit defends"
"a wild swing at a slower ball outside off and he's beaten. Scratch that, he's made to look like a rusty old gate"

chops down on a shortish delivery outside off and finds a single to deep third man
allows the ball to come to him and slants it away to deep third man
another eat-your-heart-out pull shot! And that's been Pakistan's problem. Good ball followed by a poor one and India have been alert to nearly all of them
"here's the slower short ball and though Dhawan is set up for the pull shot, he pulls out of it"
"quick single with Babar right on the edge of the circle at mid-on. Splendid batting from Dhawan, playing with soft hands just so he can pinch the run"
"<b>gets back-to-back fifties</b> with a simple flick off the pads, a little way to the left of square leg on the boundary. Fine batting. Pakistan really shouldn't have dropped him in the sixth over..."
"full and outside off, spears it through the covers"
<b>inside edge</b> as he looks to drive on the up but the ball is a little too short for such shenanigans. Does get a single through midwicket though
"bouncer from round the stumps, Dhawan sways away"
<B>offcutter beats Dhawan</b> as it grips the pitch and straightens from the angle round the stumps
"more short-pitched bowling, but with it climbing over his left shoulder, Dhawan does the right thing and leaves"
"<b>another snorter</b> - and it's the offcutter again. Pitching in the in-between length so Dhawan can't come forward or back. It turns as well, squaring him up and beating the edge"
"short and outside off, smears it to cover point"
"a simple defensive shot, and India find a way to profit off it. Good work from Rohit, playing it softly, beating point on his left and then once that happens, he kicks into over drive, taking the second run as well"
"slower short ball, which Rohit adjusts to and pulls to deep square leg"
"low full toss on middle, Dhawan turns it to midwicket"
"short ball on off stump, Dhawan uses the depth of the crease well"
punches to the left of cover
"launches the short ball to the square leg boundary! Effortless hit from Dhawan, making Amir pay for a terrible ball. It's short. It's sliding down leg. All it's missing is a please hit me sticker"
"length ball on off, defended back"
"fuller this time, width available outside off, ad he pushes it out through extra cover"
"length ball, angled in and straightens around off, plays late to point"
"short ball, doesn't manage to get entirely on top of it, pulled a couple of bounces to deep midwicket"
carves a fuller one away through the gap at cover
"too easy. Banged in short, no pace on this surface, Dhawan finds all the time he needs to rock back and pull behind square for another four"
advances and gets a high full toss that's turned gently away to midwicket where <b>Fakhar dives and throws wide and Malik backing up shoddily lets it go</b>
"short ball, Rohit picks it in a moment, shifts back, transfers weight onto the backfoot, and pulls imperiously over deep midwicket"
tries to open the face and run it down to third man and gets <b>beaten</b>
"fetches a sweep from outside off and miscues it off the top-edge. Luckily for him, it lands in the vacant spaces behind square leg"
defends a length ball back to the bowler
"shot! That is just so beautiful, it's the kind you can watch over and over without blinking an eye. Just reaches out slightly to a fuller one outside off and drives with authority through the covers. These are trademark Rohit shots"
advances down the ground and drills this down the ground
"fuller of a length, turns away outside off, blocked"
"length ball, slid into the leg side.. this is shoddy bowling. Feeding them helpful angles. Rohit gets down and crunches a sweep through backward square leg"

moves back and across to a shortish one and jabs it back
shifts back and punches a shortish one to extra cover
advances down the ground and crunches a full toss to long-off
pushes a fuller one down the pitch
"rocks back to a short one, they're giving both batsmen so much time with these shoddy lengths. Slapped over deep midwicket"

front-foot defence to point

"length, pitching outside leg, nudged into the on side"
"leg side length ball, swivels around and swats it down to fine leg"

"full outside off, goes a little too hard at it and mistimes it to mid-off"
"short, wide, jumps and flays an uppercut through backward point. Onto 98 now"

"miiiiles outta here! Full, slow and in the arc outside off, slogged muscularly over the large deep midwicket boundary"

"full, slanted into him from around the wicket, nudged into the leg side"
gets some width and plays it late to point
"oh, dear! A run out! That was probably the only way India were going to lose a wicket tonight. Walks off to a rousing ovation from the crowd. As for the end, Rohit tapped this to point and yelled out a no. Dhawan was always up for the run, sprints all the way up towards the other end. Rohit was never keen. Too late to recover. Disappointing end to a top knock"

turns a length ball on middle to deep square leg. And so we wait.
that's his trademark. Reads that the short ball is outside off and that third man is wide on the boundary. So he presents the angled face and lets the pace of the bowler do his work for him
"tosses it up from round the stumps, Rohit gets forward to block"
"<b>hundred for the India captain</b> and he works that extra bit harder to get to it, tapping the good length ball to deep square leg and immediately sensing he can get the two runs he needs. Great fitness. Class batting.

gets inside the line of a short ball on off stump and pulls it to long leg
"<b>front-foot pull</b> and it soars into the crowd behind square leg! Rohit is insane with this shot. For half a second it seems like he's hurried, that the ball gets big on him, that maybe he's even top-edged it. But it's only as the ball keeps climbing in the air do you realise the timing he's got on the ball."
