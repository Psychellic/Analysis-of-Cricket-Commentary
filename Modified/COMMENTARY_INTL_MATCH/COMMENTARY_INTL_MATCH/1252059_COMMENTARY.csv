"tight start on the stumps, Gurbaz blocks it back"
"similar line on the off stump again, he defends off the back foot this time"
"Gurbaz makes room this time and drives that low full toss past a diving extra cover, and far from mid off for four"
<b>down he ground for another four</b>! Expects the length to be shorter after the full toss so he charges down and lofts it over Raza's head for a boundary
wider and it <b>keeps low</b> as it comes in. Gurbaz waned goes for the cut and misses
he keeps strike by going back and tucking the incoming ball to midwicket for one
"nice and tight with the angle around of stump, Gurbaz defends on the back foot"
"<strong>caught behind, Ngarava has taken the big wicket of Gurbaz</strong>! Shorter ball this time around off, takes it away with the angle, there's goof bounce with the bowler's height and Gurbaz pokes to edge it for a simple catch to the keeper. Zimbabwe will be delighted with this!"
"stifling line around off, Janat defends it on the off side"
"some room, Janet opens his arms and slashes hard at it but finds point"
<b>squares his up a little bit</b> as Ngarava gets good bounce with the accurate line again and Janat gets a thick edge to third man
"nice and accurate on the middle stump, Ghani defends on the back foot"
"length ball around off, pushed into the covers"
"<strong>smoked down the ground for six</strong>! Bit too full, on the off stump and it's in the arc for Janat to loft that over the bowler's head for a handsome six"
touch shorter with similar line and he defends it back
"makes room and it's a <strong>one-bounce four</strong> over the covers! He made room early, Raza pitched it a bit short and Janat slammed it over the covers with some power to get four more"
tucks the tighter ball to the leg side this time for one to deep midwicket
"short of length and towards the pads, worked to leg again for one more"
"<strong>big run-out chance but it's not a direct hit at the keepers end</strong>! Ghani pushed the ball to extra cover and took off even as Janat didn't move at all, halfway down the pitch Ghani has to turn back as the fielder picks the ball up and has a shy at the stumps, the keeper is still back and the batsman is safe after a dive"
outside off and pushed to extra cover again. This time he stays still
"goes across and places it wide of short fine leg smartly for a four! It was a short ball, he went across early and played a clever pull instead of muscling it"
bit of width outside off with extra bounce and he runs it down to third man
"swings and misses well outside off! Lots of room which must have tempted Janat, and he does't get any bat on it"
"slow offcutter, he rolled his fingers over that one, and it's back of length which sends Janat on his toes as he steers it between point and cover point but no runs there"
"back of length on leg and angling towards off, Ghani is cramped up a bit and he defends it to leg"
"bangs it into the pitch, a quick bouncer from Ngarava and Ghani ducks under it easily. It was outside off as well"
"too quick from Ngarava, <b>beaten completely</b>! It's not just the pace, really good bounce as well just outside off from back of length as Ghani swings and misses"
"<b>leading edge to third man</b>, almost went to point! He wanted to turn the ball from off to leg but the ball was quick and took the shoulder of the bat to third man"
swings with hard hands and finds mid off
"opens up this time and swings hard again, gets a single to the leg side this time"
"too full and Janat has hammered that <b.over long on for six</b>! Not the length he wanes to ball, right in Janat's arc around off and he had no trouble in swinging down the ground for a biggie"
"outside off this time and shorter, Janat cuts and gets an inner edge to the keeper after a bounce"
"too much room this time and he's slapped it wide of a diving cover point for a cracking four! Too short and wide, Janat also opened up a little bit and struck it nicely"
"<b>beaten and almost caught behind</b>! Good bounce this time as it's short again, Janat goes after it and is beaten by the bounce just outside off"
"short and wide again, punished for another four! Enough room for Janat to stay back and cut that over the point region in the gap"
"<b>upper cut for six, that's 20 from the over</b>! Why is he bowling there again and again! Short and wide, only third man in place and Janat has upper cut that over the boundary rope for a six"
starts with a wide down leg and it's gone out of the keeper's hand for a bye as well
"nice tossed up outside off, bit too full, and it's driven to mid off for one"
comes back or two as he drives that full legbreak wide of point in the deep
"full and flighted again, driven back and a misfield from the bowler concedes one"
"shorter but still tight on middle, he goes back and works it down to long on"
"some flight outside off, pushed into the covers for one"
"throws his hands at it outside off, gets a single to deep extra cover for one"
"angling in towards off, pushed to cover for one"
"slow offcutter on middle, Ghani waits and covers the stumps before working it to leg with soft hands so they can come back for the second"
"another near mix up as Ghani pushes the ball to cover and wants one, but comes back quickly this time"
"hint of room outside off, he taps the ball towards point for a quick single"
"bangs in the bouncer, it's called a wide"
"another one in Janat's arc, too straight and full, and it's clobbered down again, over the bowler's head for a clean and straight six! That's his fourth six"
"slower delivery again, worked to leg with soft hands again for two and a fumble from deep midwicket coming in makes it an easy two"
outside off and driven to cover
Ghani has broken the shackles. He comes down the track to nearly take the ball on the full and drives it just wide of deep extra cover for four
"tight line around off, Ghani works it to off"
comes down again but drills it straight to cover
"on middle and leg now, worked to long on easily for one"
pushes this one back to Williams
"<b>just clears long-on</b>. He didn't really middle that, danced down the pitch to take it on the full but the ball was still not so close to him, he lofts it awkwardly in the air and just clears the fielder"
tighter line and it's worked to leg for one
heaves with hard hands and sends the length ball to long on
"the googly turns in from outside off, he goes back and cuts to short third man. Thick outside edge and no run"
"beaten! Quicker and flatter outside off, cuts and misses this time"
errs towards the pads and Ghani tucks it away to leg. A wayward throw from the deep otherwise Ghani would have been in trouble for the second
"he makes room, Williams angles it in and he pushes it to cover"
pushes the ball back towards the bowler and a fumble near the non-striker gives away one
moves cross and whips the full delivery from off to long on
"fullish again, strikes it over the bowler's head to long off"
"makes just a hint of room, and he does well to drive that full ball late so that he bisects cover point and point for a four"
"full around the off stump, driven down to long off"
"welcomed back with a six! Ghani has not looked great today but he's opening up now, he picked the slower ball on short of length from Tiripano, and swept that with a knee down on the ground to clear deep midwicket"
"on the leg side now, helped along to fine leg where the fielder has put in a slide to just keep the ball in, but replays confirm his leg touched the rope when the ball was still in his hand"
almost a short ball and pulled to deep midwicket for one
"short of length outside off, he waits and turns it to leg with the wrists for one"
"too wide outside off, left alone to be called a wide"
"just short of length, looked like a slower delivery and it's so slow that Ghani rocks back and scythes that away in the gap for another four, his fifth"
"<strong>caught at short fine leg</strong>! Ghani was going well there after a scratchy start and he's gone just one short of fifty. Short of length towards the hips, he tucked it uppishly and Muzarabani did well to dive to his right with both hands to grab it nicely"
"full and outside off, pushed to deep cover and that's a <b>maiden T20I fifty</b> for Janat. What an aggressive innings he's played today"
loud appeal for lbw but that struck him in front of leg and was turning down leg with the legbreak
"on the pads again, helped off the pads behind square for one"
"flat outside off, not much turn and it's chopped to point"
fuller outside off and it's pushed to cover this time
"slightly shorter towards middle and leg, and Janat works it down to long on to keep strike"
"slightly full outside off, h swings hard and gets a bottom edge towards the keeper but gets one"
"bit too short, Zadran rocks back and cuts that away to deep point for two"
"nice and tight around off, he doesn't move much and defends"
on the pads and easily tickled to leg for one
"<b>loud appeal for lbw</b> as it's quicker, full and hit him in front of the stumps. But not sure if it pitched on leg or just outside."
"<b>dropped in the deep</b>! Janat has skied this to the leg side with a swipe off a length delivery, and it's going between deep midwicket and deep square leg which is was leads to the drop."
"<strong>Burl is pumped</strong> and thumps his chest because he's got the big wicket of Janat, knocks over his leg stump. It was a nice and slow legbreak on leg, Janat wanted a few runs and went for the sweep but a bit too early and missed it completely"
"bit of turn for the straight delivery on middle, takes an edge back to the bowler"
touch shorter and he smartly turns the ball to leg with soft hands because the fielders are right at the boundary. Good running to come back for the second
"not enough time for another second perhaps, they settle for one this time. Short and quick delivery worked away to leg again"
"flighted towards leg, and he reverse-sweeps it straight to point"
just outside off and it's steered down to long off
"short and wide, and slapped towards extra cover and Williams dives to his right from mid off to save a few"
"<b>launched over long on for six</b>! Slow and floated well outside off, Nabi has enough room to swing his arms and he heaves it across and over long on"
"slightly closer to the batsman and he launches it down the ground for another six! Much straighter swing from Nabi, much better looking, and high and handsome over the bowler's head"
"swings again, it's a <b>leading edge</b> behind square but falls wide of short third man. A misfield, or rather a deflection from short third man gives away two more"
"flighted outside off, worked to leg with the turn for an easy one"
"<b>long-on gets fingertips and it's gone for six</b>! Nabi goes wide this time, launches this to the wide long-on region, where long-on and deep midwicket come together and long on stretched his right hand, just gets his fingertips but can't hold on!"
"antes it across Zadran, who swings and misses"
nicely bowled - wide yorker and it's steered wide of cover for one
aims for a yorker but it's gone down leg for a wide
"length ball around off, he steers it to deep point for one"
"a wide yorker, right in the slot and he misses it"
<strong>hammered back and nearly broke the bowler's hands</strong>! That full delivery was absolutely muscled back and was headed for Muzarabani's head but he did well to sway his head and get both hands to it. Couldn't hold on though or would have been an unbelievable catch
"short ball this time, Zadran pulls and it's in the gap in the deep, just beating deep square leg for four"
"<b>finds long-off and he's gone</b>! Full ball, struck straight down long-off's throat as Burl first came in a couple of steps and then realised he had to stay back. Took it comfortably in the end"
"wide yorker from Ngarava, Nabi wants to smash it but can't clear point"
"changes it up with a slower ball on short of length, Nabi swings for a pull and gets a bottom edge behind the stumps where the keeper does well to get his left hand to it"
"another slower ball on short of length, but it's slightly wide and Nabi this time swings his powerful arms to send hat flying over the bowler's head to beat long on. Ngarava is unhappy"
"fullish outside off, Nabi drills this one along the ground to long off for one"
"goes back and across for a heave, can't middle the slower ball and he keeps strike with one on the leg side excellent"
"excellent placement from Nabi as he scythes what Ngarava wanted to be a wide yorker, but it was just a full delivery, and Nabi sends that crashing to the point boundary"
"angles it in from wide of the crease, Afghan finds short fine leg and takes one quickly to get Nabi on strike"
"goes for the yorker, and he's absolutely smoked that over wide long on for such a powerful six!"
"slower ball gets the better of Nabi, he's holed out to deep square leg. Slow and short, Nabi was early into the pull and gets a leading edge which is taken easily by Musakanda"
"right in the block hole, aiming for the base of leg stump, and he opens up and gets just enough bat for a single to fine leg"
"slower ball on short of length, chipped between cover and long off, and they come back for the second"
"angling in from wide of the crease, Rashid works the full ball to leg and keeps strike"
"slower ball, Rashid doesn't get enough on it and gets a single"
"aims for the block hole, Afghan stays deep and opens his stance to swing that between deep midwicket and long on. Bisects the gap perfectly and gets four"
"high and handsome over long-on, that's massive! Length delivery on middle and leg, he stayed back yet again and absolutely middled that to send that crashing over the dugout"
"in the block hole outside off now, Afghan manages to dig it out. Good ball"
"on length well outside off, Afghan swings very hard and gets only one to leg because he can't middle it"
"the offcutter is full outside off, Rashid hangs back and scythes that with quick hands over the point region for a cracking four!"
"Rashid goes across and gets a full toss on middle, which he works down to long on for one"
"loud appeal for lbw, given out, and it's <b>hit the batsman's back leg really hard</b> and injured him! Kamunhukamwe is on the ground and looks in real pain, the physio has the ice bag on the knee. Naveen brought the ball in sharply from just outside off, and Kamunhukamwe opened his stance to swing it to the leg side, exposing his stumps and the back lag, and the ball went on to strike he back knee because the bent leg pulled the pad down"
"some width outside off, hint of away movement as well and Williams has steered the ball nicely between point and cover point for a four"
"on the leg side this time, another four from Williams! Short of length from around the wicket, he waited on the back foot and turned it away to the leg side with his wrists for a four to the wide long on region"
"short and quick towards the waist, he helps it to leg for one"
<strong>nearly chops on</strong>! And really good work from the keeper to leap to his left to stop that. Musakanda got a bottom edge on the short of length ball outside off and it was racing away fine on the leg side after a bounce before the keeper stopped it
"fuller on the stumps now, Musakanda swings and gets another bottom edge. A single to the leg side"
"some room outside off, he goes back and slams it wide of mid off for one"
"swings across the line, misses it completely and <b>he's bowled</b>! Goes down on a knee for a big sweep, nowhere close to it and he loses his off stump. And Nabi has taken a wicket in T20Is after as many as 12 wicketless innings"
"<strong>leading edge</strong> flies over the infield on the off side, he survives first ball! Nabi slid in an arm ball when he saw the batsman coming down and it took a leading edge over extra cover for two"

towards the pads and it's flicked to long leg for two more
slightly full and punched down to long on for one more
fairly straight length ball and it's struck over the bowler's head for a one-bounce four!
"lots of calls for 'two' and from the keeper as Musakanda pulls the shorter ball to deep midwicket, and he wants two but he settles for one"
"chipped in the air uppishly between point and cover point, and that's raced to the boundary on this quick outfield. First four for Madhevere"
slower ball down the leg side for a wide
"and Madhevere has thrown it away by miscuing this short and wide delivery to point for the easiest of catches. Lots of room on offer, he chases it and hardly got the middle as two fielders converged at point with four hands but eventually two took it"
"short of length outside off, Musakanda slices it towards point for one"
taps the back of length ball from off stump to point  for one

"darted in towards middle stumps, worked away to leg for one"
"slightly slower and fuller on leg, he waits and defends it back to the bowler"
"lofted over the covers, and that's a wonderful boundary from Raza! Just short of length on the stumps, and Raza rocked back to chip that over the covers but with power in the gap"
"more towards middle and leg, and this time Raza sweeps it away to the long-leg boundary because he knows fine leg is in. Pressure on Hamza fo a strong finish"
slightly slower outside off and it's pushed down to long off
punches the short of length ball to mid off for a quick single
"on the pads now, and helped along to deep fine leg easily"
"it's the bouncer that works against Raza and Hamza takes a really good catch at the deep square leg boundary. Quick bouncer from Ahmad hurried onto Raza who was late on the hook, bit of a top edge flew towards the deep where Hamza took a couple of steps back quickly and catch it with both arms over his head, just inside the boundary line"

flicked down to long-on for one
"well outside off, no turn, steered to cover point"
pitched up and Burl has smoked that with the turn to the deep midwicket boundary for a big six into the stands!
"<strong>keeps really low</strong> and Burl has lost balance, ends up sitting on the ground facing the keeper! He wanted to pull the short of length ball but the lack of bounce beat him, and he ended up turning completely before landing on the ground"
gets decent bounce this time to slap it to deep midwicket for one
"coming in, and he helps it to short fine leg"
uses the angle and swings it away to deep midwicket
"full ball to Mutumbami, and it's pushed down to long on"

shouts of 'catch' as Mutumbami pulls the short ball straight towards deep midwicket but the fielder doesn't move and takes it on the bounce. His gesture says the sun was in his eyes
"low full toss, nearly in the block hole, and it's flicked to leg for one"
"slower ball coming in, worked away to the leg side and they're thinking of a second but decide against it"
"third man is in, so Mutumbami takes out the reverse-sweep and finds the gap behind square on off for a useful four"
comes down this time and chips the ball towards mid on where the fielder is deep so Nabi chases the ball himself. They take two with some good sprinting
"and a wicket straightaway after the mini-break, Mutumbami's reverse-sweep costs him as he's trapped in front of the off stump! Goes for the reverse, misses the offbreak from outside off and replays show it may have actually hit him just outside the line, looks touch and go"
