"hangs back against the good length offbreak and whisks it through to deep square leg. While all this is happening, Sarfraz belts out, 'Come on, beta. Sabash'. #BigDaddy"
"<B>outside edge</b>, which pleases Sarfraz as he tracks it dipping and turning on the left-hander from behind the stumps"
a lot more revs on the ball and it hits a good length outside off and turn sharply into the keeper's gloves. Good leave from Nicholls in the end
"goes back, waits on the slow turn and then flicks it to square leg"
"goes into the left-hander, a little like the doosra. Nicholls plays it off the pitch as he hurriedly nudges it into the leg side"
draws him forward outside off - such lovely loop on the ball - Nicholls blocks into the covers
"<B>wallops short leg</b>! Man down! It's Imam, who's only just recovered from an injury sustained in the one-day series. Dangerous position to field, especially when a legspinner drops it short and a batsman like Kane Williamson is around. Such a good back foot player, plays a violent sweep shot but the ball thwacks the inside of Imam's left thigh. Gonna bruise up big time, but he's up and about and walking it off now"
"shot! He's picking length so wonderfully well in this innings. And that's really the reason for him looking so assured. Yasir pitches it short, Williamson is already back and lying in wait with the cut shot"
"loops it up on middle, Nicholls covers it well"
"<b>appeal for a catch at short leg</b> but this legbreak - a dangerous one, turning sharply past the inside edge - leaps off the front pad"
"ratchets the pace up, but still manages to keep the length nice and full. Nicholls keeps it out"
"<B>lovely bowling</b>! And the chorous around the batsman confirms it. Yasir gets a big-spinning legbreak to dip just in front of the batsman, already committed to the forward defensive. The inside edge goes to short leg. A little more bounce and it would have been curtains"
steps away from the offbreak on and around off stump and cuts into the covers
slinks deep in his crease to a tossed up ball too and turns it to short leg
stays low to pull the short ball on leg stump to long leg
"<b>squares himself up</b> as he recognises the turn on this delivery, pushed through on leg stump and darting over, looking for the outside edge"
"full on middle, defends"
hammers it away to the square leg boundary - the sweep shot comes to Nicholls' rescue. The ball from round the wicket keeps drifting in and he uses that to his advantage
"neat little late cut, but it looks like he hasn't waited long enough to get runs"
reaches out to the tossed up ball on off stump and calmly steers it to cover
tosses it up outside off and Nicholls does well to get to the pitch and smother the turn
"brings out the sweep, confident that he won't be lbw with the bowler coming round the wicket, pitching the ball outside off"
goes back to protect his stumps against a good length legbreak

<b>big turn</b> as he pitches it on a good length on middle and surprises Williamson.
gets forward to a tossed up delivery on middle and blocks
drives a full delivery on off stump to long-off
sweeps a tossed up delivery straying into middle and leg to long leg
"gives it a bit of air, the ball comes down on middle, Williamson has no trouble"
<B>strikes silly point</b> but not too terribly as Nicholls goes for the back foot punch
"goes back, clearing his front leg to flick the short ball to short midwicket"
"tosses it up on off stump, Nicholls is up to it"
"tentative forward press, but he fares well enough, defending on off stump"
"slipping into middle and leg, Nicholls defends"
"goes on with the arm as he hits a good length, always drawing the batsman forward, but never letting him get to the pitch of it. Nicholls keeps it out though and that's lunch"
"responds well to a flighted delivery outside off, with the front foot going across, allowing him to put his head over the ball and drive through cover"
"takes a tiny step forward, then commits to it properly and smothers the legbreak on off stump"
"loads up the sweep again, and with the line being outside off, he doesn't need to worry about lbw"
"lovely line, dangling the bait outside off, Nicholls keeps his head and defends"
wanders back - so far back - to deal with a shortish legbreak coming into his stumps
"draws him a fair distance outside the off stump to play this slow, flighted delivery"
gets on top of the back of a length ball outside off and taps it into the covers
"probes a fuller length, on off stump, Williamson gets across to work it to midwicket. <b>Signs that the ball is reversing now</b>"
"starts it from outside off, knowing the ball will curl into the right-hander. And it does. Abbas magic. And a bit of Williamson magic greets it. Moves across to cover his stumps and then leaves outside his eyeline"
"good length on off stump, he keeps it out"
works a shortish delivery on off stump to a wide mid-on
homes in on middle stump but Williamson protects it with style
"lovely work from Nicholls, shifting back to the short ball, waiting for it to turn, and come close to his body before playing the flick. Short leg is in the way though"
"<b>appeal for lbw</b> but from round the stumps, the legbreak will struggle to both strike in line and hit the stumps. Also, here, there's an inside edge"
drags the length short and Nicholls will be kicking himself for not putting the pull shot away past square leg
"firm hit down the ground! Super stuff from the batsman. Putting a little extra bottom hand on the shot so he can beat Bilal at mid-on. Rare loose ball from Yasir, the pace slow, the length short, the message 'hit me'"
"beautiful cricket! Brings up the fifty partnership as Nicholls uses his reach, lunging forward, staying low, and using quick hands to sweep a ball that pitches way outside off to the square leg boundary."
"<b>nearly carries to short leg</b>. Yasir shifts his line closer to off stump. Additionally, he pulls his length back just a touch to make sure the left-hander has to play with a straight bat. That ensures he gets help off the pitch - just enough to secure the inside edge"
"full and swerving into the right-hander, Williamson covers it beautifully"
"steps forward to meet the full, inswinging delivery on off stump"
"goes a touch short and Williamson is annoyed with himself for not doing better with his back foot punch. It's his shot. His signature, only this time it comes out illegibly, off the inside edge"
<b>su-weeeeeeeet</b>! And all he does is push his front leg forward and bring down a straight bat. Such ludicrously good timing to send a perfectly good length ball scurrying past the left of Azhar Ali at mid-off. The snappers at the ground better get this picture and the NZ papers tomorrow better be plastered with it
"shortish and outside off, he knocks it down towards cover point"
"pitches it up on off stump, Nicholls forms a barrier between it and the stumps"
It's another short ball from Yasir and it's too easy for Williamson. Gets down - so much that his back knee is on the ground by the time he finishes playing the pull shot behind square leg
<b>there's he fifty</B> and it's a high-class shot marking a high-class effort. Going back to a flatter delivery - and since it's outside off - it's late cut behind backward point. That little bit of room and he latches onto it
"loops it up outside off, Williamson is there, waiting with his big, broad blade"
"a lovely inside out cover drive, that front foot taking him to the pitch of the ball, the back foot going away so his body faces the direction he wants the ball to go in"
<B>outside edge</b> as Williamson going back to block. And that only happens because the turn is tagged with a lot of drift into Williamson. Looks like the leggie needs to bowl a little quicker to be a threat on this pitch
"tosses it up just outside off, Nicholls defends"
"fullish on off stump, defends"
<b>inside edge</b> as Abbas pulls off a perfect delivery. The length is full. The reverse swing is late. The batsman is in two minds. And he's lucky not to play out
"angles it into middle and leg, Williamson turns it to mid-on"
"back of a length and outside off, Williamson lets it go with impunity. He'd decided not to play that ball even as it was just starting down the pitch"
"shortish on off stump, blocks it"
"plays late, letting the short ball come to him, almost pass him before he steers it to the cordon behind him"
too wide to interest Nicholls
spears it behind point and the overpitched delivery nearly goes all the way to the boundary. New Zealand starting to get a little more comfy out there
"back of a length and outside off, Williamson has his eyes on it all the way through to the keeper"
"another ball outside off, another chance for him to practice the leave"
nails the cut! He is so good at waiting for the bad ball. And even better at putting it away. Moving back and across to it and carving it behind point
"back of a length on off stump, pats it down to the bowler"
<b>taken by the keeper</b>! And that's why he's the boss. He won't be putting this wicket up on the mantle - a nonchalant half-volley outside off securing the outside edge as Nicholls goes for a big ole drive - but he'll take it and so will his team. Pakistan can now put pressure on the new man in. They can take control bowling on a batting pitch
"<B>so soooo good</b>! Snip this clip, all you young kids. This is how you introduce yourself to a new man in. Pitch it up, give it a chance to move in the air, and sometimes it will. Both sharply and late. Watling has to dig out one of his best defensive shots to keep his stumps standing"
"back of a length and outside off, blocks"
opens the face a bit to steer the shortish delivery outside off to cover
"<b>looks for lbw</b> with the ball reversing. Watling is just about good enough to escape, pulling his front leg back and bringing down a straight bat"
"<b>curls in from outside off</B> and the top of off stump is in trouble until Watling brings down a straight bat. Just like that, the game's changed."
"soft hands, angled bat - pointing to the ground, and the skill to meet it so late and close to the body. Classy"
"looks for the glide to third man, but Pakistan have done well to plug that release, putting a man at gully"
"good length, outside off, no shot"
controls the shortish delivery on off stump with a straight bat
"beautiful shot! Goes on the up but never goes hard. Never lets the bat stray too far from his body. Somewhere Williamson's childhood coach is gasping with joy, along with the rest of us"
"<b>close to lbw</b> as Hasan uses reverse swing to great advantage. The ball is pitched up. It curls in late. And it demands Watling to be at his best, the flick played late going to long leg"
"hunts for the top of off stump, but Watling won't give it away that easily"
covers the line of this back of a length delivery on off stump
"minds the reverse swing, telling himself not to commit until the ball is right under his eyes. And by the time it gets, it's an inswinging menace. Watling somehow manages to keep it out"
"gets the ball to hold its line now, on and around off stump. Watling is up to its challenge"
"beautiful flick to mid-on, the wrists bailing him out as a reverse swinging delivery looks to trap him lbw. Top work from Watling, not least because his front leg doesn't come across his stumps"
"change of pace now, which Watling picks and dabs to point"
"fullish and outside off, blocks it to cover"
"bouncer, which is pulled down along the ground to deep square leg. And for once, his ability to pick up length so early plays against him, making him go for the shot sooner than the ball arrives"
"somehow steers the ball into the gap between the slips and gully. Fairly risky ploy, and in the end it seems like he is trying to yank the bat away after originally being committed to a glide to point. Soft hands save him"
"back of a length and outside off, blocks"
"shortish and outside off, he doesn't go after it"
skids in off the pitch - at high pace - and Watling is just about able to bring a straight bat down in time
"tosses it up on middle, Williamson defends it, taking just as much care as he would if Haris wasn't a part-timer"
drags it short and Williamson steps away to cut the ball to the sweeper
"loops it up on middle, Watling defends well"
straying down leg which allows Watling to flick through square leg
turns the fuller ball outside leg to deep midwicket
"a touch too short which allows Watling to play the ball off the pitch. However, the match sitch is too tense to indulge in fancy shots so he defends"
"<b>caught behind down leg</b>! Eish! He's played out the unplayables and falls to the unthinkable! A silly short ball, no threat in it, going harmlessly down leg. Williamson is in good form so he goes for the pull shot, trying to roll his wrists to keep the ball down, but Hasan manages to get just enough bounce to tickle the gloves and go through to the keeper. Superb innings. Flat ending."
<b>lbw first ball!</b>! Too good from Hasan. It's a new batsman. He won't know much about the pitch. Can't know anything about the reverse swing on offer. So what does Hasan do? He targets the stumps. Supremely good fast bowling. And at the other end is a flat-footed block. The bat is too slow to come down. Certainly when compared to this fuller delivery that crashes into his front pad below the knee roll. Poor de Grandhomme. He had no chance.
"full, straight, looking for middle stump but Sodhi's straight bat intervenes just in time"
"another fuller delivery looking for the stumps, Sodhi turns it away"
"<B>another bouncer</b>, on middle and off, forcing Sodhi to take evasive action"
"<b>scary inswinging yorker</b> but Sodhi is able to shove a straight bat down to protect both his pads and his stumps. He isn't looking for a boundary, but he'll take it nonetheless"
"slides down leg, Watling nudges it to short midwicket"
stands tall and punches the good length ball to cover
"full on middle, defends"
cuts the short ball outside off to the sweeper
keeps out the tossed up delivery on off stump
"<b>appeal for lbw and it's given</b>. But Sodhi has reviewed the call. This will be tight. It's a very well flighted delivery, always angling into the right-hander, so much that Sodhi is nearly late on it. And is nearly yorked as well. Replays indicate it might have hit bat first before pad, but we need UltraEdge to confirm. And it does indeed break the deadlock, by inches. The ball grazes Sodhi's boot half a second before it goes up to hit his bat.  'I'm happy that that's pad first,' says the third umpire Reiffel. Three reds on ball-tracking and Bruce Oxenford's on-field call stands"
"back of a length and angling into the right-hander, Watling turns it to midwicket"
"bouncer, which he ducks under"
"fuller delivery on middle and off, Watling pushes it down the ground"
full and tailing into the right-hander. Watling protects his off stump well
"short ball straying down leg, Watling ignores it"
"back of a length and outside off, blocks"
"goes back to block a good length ball that turns sharply into the left-hander, enough to beat the middle and take an inside edge"
"lovely dip, refusing to allow Wagner to reach the pitch of the ball as he comes forward to block on off stump"
"shortish and outside off, slaps it through to the sweeper"
blocks the shortish delivery on off stump
spins right past him after it pitches on off stump. Wagner's flick is in the wrong pin code
"<b>lbw appeal</b> but Wagner's inside edged this. Nevertheless, the turn Haris is getting from well outside off stump is pretty substantial. And it's quick as well"
firmly meets the back of a length delivery on off stump
"slower ball, outside off, Watling is into the drive a little early, but having been deceived, he plays with soft hands"
"late swing into the right-hander, but Watling whips it to the right of mid-on as if he's been playing reverse swing all his life"
"back of a length, at pace, striking the top half of the bat as Watling defends. Those two wickets have really geed Hasan up. Plenty of variation in length, pace and scary reverse swing too"
leans into an on-the-up drive as he sends a fuller delivery outside off to the left of mid-off
defends a shortish delivery on off stump to point
"<b>traps him in front</b>. Turn. So much turn. Such wonderful, wild turn and Watling has gone for a review. He's the last batsman standing so he has to. But what hope does he have when the ball is this good. Haris angles it in from wide of the crease. It pitches on leg stump and breaks away in startling fashion, beating the leading edge as Watling tries to flick and hitting him on the back pad. Ball-tracking shows three reds and umpire Oxenford's call stands"
"appeal for lbw, and though there is no bat involved and it strikes low on the front pad, the impact is outside the line of off stump"
"tosses it up outside off, he drives through the covers"
goes back to block a flatter delivery on off stump
"comes down the track, but Haris pulls his length back, forcing Wagner to defend rather than attack. Gets an inside edge to short leg and has to hurry back into his crease"

"full and angling into off, Abbas covers the line defends stoutly to the covers. Yes, decent defensive technique from him - head over the ball, bat-pad close together. Pakistan need him to hang on with Azhar"
"Azhar ventures down the track, yorks himself outside off and jams the ball away to the left of the bowler"
"looped up on off, turns away a touch, carved to the covers"
"shorter and outside off, Azhar goes deep in the crease and punches through point. Pakistan search for two but have to settle with just one in the end. <b>Coach Arthur is off his seat</b> Fans are praying in the stands. Test cricket: you beauty!"
"floated up on off, presses forward and defends it to cover. Nicely done by Abbas"

"short of length, a bit wide outside off, Azhar goes for a cut and misses"
"a touch fuller and closer, pushes it towards extra cover, two more to go in this over, can he take a single?"
"slower one just outside off, pushes it towards cover-point and gets a single. Abbas to face one ball, Pakistan need nine"
"goes for a bouncer that doesn't bounce, angling across Abbas who somehow manages to sway away from it"
"length ball, outside off, comes forward and steers it towards sweeper cover, no run taken"
"fuller on middle and leg, pushes it towards long-on, once again denies the single"
"tossed up a bit this time, drives towards sweeper cover, was in the air for a while"
"<strong>takes the single</strong>. Abbas to face two now, drives it towards deep cover"
"bowls it full and wide, was looking for an arm ball, left alone"
"<strong>a huge appeal</strong>, they are reviewing and celebrating wildly. Was there an edge? It spin sharply off the length, Abbas looks to turn it on leg side. Nothing on the UltraEdge there, <b>New Zealand lose their review</b>. Abbas survives"
"length ball outside off, steers it towards covers"
"a full toss on the leg stump, chips it towards deep midwicket, missed out there Azhar Ali"
"short and wide and cuts it to the right of the fine leg, there was chance for two but Azhar Ali denies any run"
"slower one outside off at 115 kphs, Azhar pushes it softly towards covers"
"<strong>yes, he does</strong>. <strong>Upper-cuts</strong> this one towards third man, well short of Southee there, Abbas to face the last ball"
"goes for the yorker but doesn't get it right, a low full toss on off stump, defended back by Abbas. Well done!"
"fuller on the stumps, defended from the crease"
"short, some room there, goes for the cut. Williamson is there at third man"
use of feet and drives it along the ground towards long-off
"length ball, stays in his crease and blocks"
"goes for the reverse sweep, Williamson is at short third man, makes a good stop"
"down the track, Ajaz shortens his length but Azhar manages to push it down the ground for a single, to long-off"
"short delivery from around the wicket, pulls it down towards deep backward square leg"
"another pull down to fine leg, doesn't take the single"
"short outside off, pulls it towards midwicket this time, more like a drag this one, still no run"
"<strong>looks to scoop it over</strong> the keeper, this is pressure now. Moved across to the length ball but didn't get anything on it"
"pitched short but doesn't bounce at all, was a slower one I think, Azhar adjusts well and dabs it towards third man"
"goes for the bouncer, Abbas does well to duck under it. Survives another one. <strong>Pakistan only five away now</strong>"
"tossed up around off, pushes it uppishly towards cover-point"
"short of length, goes back and punches it towards sweeper cover"
"arm ball, outside off, goes back and late-cuts it towards deep backward point"
"<strong>given</strong> lbw. Pakistan review. Bowled from around the wicket, was slower in the air, Azhar Ali pushes forward but it spins past him, hits him high on the thigh. Did it pitch outside leg, was it too high? All sorts of things to be checked. Pitched in line, spins back to hit in line and stumps? Whoa!!! Umpire's call on the stumps as replay shows it would have hit the off bail. In the end, it's Azhar Ali who loses his wicket. Absolute scenes here. Azhar Ali is distraught, hugs and handshakes in the New Zealand camp. Had it been given not out, it would have remained not out, what luck!"
