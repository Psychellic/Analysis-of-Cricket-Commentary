"length ball angling into him, tries to flick it, it goes off his pad to square leg"
"nice line, too close to off stump and to his body to cut, he tries to do it and misses. And the ball has died on Hope and pinged him on the inside of  his left knee behind the stumps."
"swing into the left-hander, yorker length, defended solidly back down the pitch"
"keeping it on off stump, and getting it to nibble in the air. Zazai checks his push without moving feet and it hits the inside half of the bat to roll back towards the bowler's left"
loses his line and it's too far down leg
"and the off-cutter has sent Zazai back. Bowled on a length but it's not at normal pace, and Zazai clearly didn't read it. Too early into the cut shot and it just loops to cover off the outside edge"
"length on the stumps, nudged into the legside"
"length ball outside off, Gurbaz goes for the cut but too far away from him"
"length ball around off, nice seam position from Holder. Tapped it towards covers"

"length around middle and off this time, Gurbaz frees his arms and swings it towards midwicket, one-bounce four"
"slower, length ball around off, stays on the leg stump and steers it towards cover-point"
"short of length this time and Gurbaz once again goes for the pull. The ball hurries on to him, hits high on the bat. Lewis puts in the jump at short midwicket but doesn't time it well and ball goes just over him"
"fuller and wider outside off, Janat drives it through extra cover, Keemo Paul with the chase"
"fuller and wider outside off, Janat clears his front leg and looks to smash through the off side once again but manages only an outside edge this time. An easy catch for Hope, the second wicket for Cottrell"

"a sharp bouncer this time, whizzed past Gurbaz who pulled out of the pull. Called a wide for height though"
"<b>lands just short of Keemo Paul at mid-off</b>. Length ball around off, looks to go over mid-off but gets the timing wrong. Paul moves forward and to his left but it falls in front of him"
"fuller outside off, aims to smash it over deep midwicket but cannot connect"
"fuller on the stumps, flicked towards midwicket but Pollard himself is stationed there now and keeps it to one"

"short of length outside off, steers it towards third man"
"short of length outside off, moves across and flicks it towards midwicket. The fielder is deep and that allows the batsmen ton come back for the second"

"fuller around off, worked towards long-on for one"
"short and wide outside off, cuts it towards sweeper cover"
"length ball on the pads, flicked away towards midwicket"
"tossed up outside off teasingly. Gurbaz looks to push at it and is overbalanced a bit. The back foot lifts up for a moment but is back grounded when the bails come off. Not out, rules third umpire"
"fuller outside off, nice-looking cover drive but extra cover moves quickly to field"
"fuller on the pads, clipped nicely away through midwicket to raise a fine <b>fifty</b> for Gurbaz. It's been an innings full of bold strokes, and he didn't let early wickets rattle him"
"fuller on leg again, nudged to midwicket"
"full outside off, punched to point"
"low full toss on leg stump, makes room and clips to long-on"
"too short, sits up a bit and he smears a pull from below his waist to deep square leg"
"length ball angling into him, he shuffles across and tucks it fine"

"another slower ball, length outside off, beats Asghar completely, who is left feeling for it, with bat dragged away from body"
"normal pace, back of a length ball coming into him on off stump, defended off his toes towards cover for a quick single"
"moved very far across the stumps, ended up on the fifth stump trying to smack it over fine leg. Williams bowled an inswinger that would have been a wide if the batsman was on off stump, but given how far he had moved across, a bit harsh to get wided for that"
"this time it's clearly down leg with the batsman static, and a clear wide"
"<b>Williams can't believe that has not been given out</b>. Slower off-cutter and the batsman is foxed totally, ends up with bat in front of body pushing at air while the ball nips back to hit pad. But the umpire has a point, it may have missed leg. The ball rolled fine to third man for two leg byes"
"length ball on leg, moves inside the line to tuck it to square leg. Didn't hit it hard which allowed them enough time to come back for two"
"<b>dropped by Brand King at deep square leg</b>. Asghar went deep in his crease to get underneath the ball. No pace from Paul and he lifts it high towards deep square. Straight into King's hands who was taking a few steps back, and straight out. Rolls over the boundary moreover."
"slower ball outside off, no pace on it again and Asghar misses connecting with the cut"
"doesn't matter who the fielder is if he hits them like that. Moved across and stayed still, then absolutely whacked this, lifting it off his pads and over deep backward square leg, into the stands"
"and Paul has his revenge. Digs in a short ball at pace on off, after having slowed it up earlier. Gets big on Asghar who tries to hook it. Gets a top edge trying to hook. And who should it go to but the newly placed King at square leg, who gratefully accepts the catch this time"
"length on the stumps, steered to third man by opening the face"
"too short, sits up and doesn't bounce, to a man in Gurbaz's form that's fodder. He transfers weight back and smacks a pull shot with power, sends it racing to the deep square leg fence"
"going across him, makes him reach for the shot, goes off the toe end towards mid-off"
"closer to the stumps and slightly shorter length than the previous ball, allows him to open the face and steer it to third man"
"well executed pull shot, even though he didn't get it completely in the sweet spot. Short ball outside off, moves slightly across and pulls to long on's right. Well placed and they get two"
<b>he's going 360 degrees</b>. Goes down on one knee and sweeps it over short fine leg from outside off to find the boundary
"slower one on the stumps, pushed towards mid-on"
"slower one, fullish outside off, he was moving across to heave it on the onside, but too early into the shot and the ball goes under the bat to the keeper"
"tried to fool the bowler by making as if to give himself room and then goes well across. Williams can't believe it's been called a wide again, and he has a point. This was just past leg stump, and looked further away from the batsman because of how much across he had gone."
<b>disdainful</b>. Stays still this time and Williams bowls it slightly back of a length on the stumps. He clears his front leg and frees his arms to smack a pull over deep midwicket.
"<b>ooooh that's going to sting</b>. Gurbaz is down, having been hit on the box. Moved across and tried to slog a full toss over backward square. Missed and the ball's hit him painfully. He's down on the ground now and getting treatment."
"yorker on off, dug back out to the bowler. He's not able to stop it cleanly, and they steal a quick single. It went off Williams to the non-striker's boot while he was running. Not intentional, though Williams is not happy they've taken a single"
"good bowling, another yorker on the stumps, squirted back out to the bowler's right and Williams throws himself to his right in his follow through to save the ball"
"slower ball, going across him, steered to short third man"
"slower ball on the stumps, patted into the legside"
"full toss on middle stump, and he flicks it high and mighty over deep square"
"short and wide outside off, Gurbaz makes excellent connection having to reach for it, but it flies off his slashing shot straight to deep point who is positioned exactly where the ball went. End of a fine innings"
"length ball on the stumps, nudged to long-on"
"full on leg, down on one knee and slog-sweeps it very fine for a one-bounce four. Great connection and audacious execution"
"mixes it up by bowling it wide of off stump, going across the left-hander. Within the tram-lines so that won't be wide. The batsmen not happy with that, but that was probably not a wide"
"this one will be a wide, for height though. Dug it in very short and it bounces well over the batsman's head"
"slower ball angling into him, tucked to midwicket"
took the pace off and kept it on a tight channel outside off. The batsman tries to steer it and misses
"short-arm jab pull shot to long-on's left. Not quite short or wide enough to free his arms, but he did well wit the execution of the shot there"
"<b>that's outta here</b>. This was shorter and he was on the backfoot in a flash, unleashes a fierce pull that sends the ball soaring over deep midwicket"
"good follow up by Cottrell, who swings in a yorker at pace. The batsman misses the flick and it flies off the pad for a leg-bye. Cottrell thinks that's close enough to be given out, but perhaps was sliding down"
"<b>Brand King misfields at short fine leg</b>. Not a great ball, back of a length on leg stump, Nabi moves inside the line and connects well with his paddle-sweep. The ball's travelling quickly and King can't collect cleanly"
"length on the stumps, flicked through midwicket. They sprint for their lives and complete the second, even though the fielder swooped in and released the ball quickly. Cottrell though couldn't collect cleanly at the non-striker's end"
"spliced off the leading edge to a very straight long-on. Slower yorker, Najibullah was looking to go deep and create momentum to flick it over midwicket, ends up getting a leading edge that loops comfortably to the fielder"
"<b>smoked</b>. That's what Najib was trying to do, and Nabi does it. Goes deep and gets underneath this yorker length ball, to drive it straight and true, over long-off. Stunning"
punched to long-on
"slower ball, back of a length outside off, he looks to give himself room but slashes it straight to backward point"
"digs in a bouncer first up at normal pace, Naib is a bit late on the pull but gets an under-edge that rolls towards point"
"slower ball, length on the stumps, he shuffles across, waits for it and taps it towards square leg. Takes a single to retain strike"
"didn't get hold of this one. Fuller length outside off, he was moving across and generating momentum with a big bat swing, but gets it off the toe-end of the bat for an easy catch to long-on"
"low full toss outside off, goes for an expansive drive but it takes a thick inside edge to short fine leg"
"tried some innovation. Moved across and tried to scoop it over third man. Gets a light touch on it and it bounces in front of the keeper, who has moved to his right and stops it"
"full outside off, steers it through point"

"fuller on the stumps, almost a yorker, flicked away in front of square leg"
"slower length ball around off, Lewis goes for the pull but ends up top-edging it towards deep midwicket. Rashid was a bit inside the boundary line and had to pedal back a bit.

"fuller outside off, another slower one. Looks to drill down the ground but mistimes it towards long-on"
"length ball around off, goes for the pull but misses and is hit on the pads. <b>An appeal for lbw and given</b>.

"down the track and driven back, but off the toe end and Rashid fields"
"drags it down a bit short, and he's able to rock back and pull this by opening his shoulders, sending it straight back. Good work by Gulbadin, running in and saving the boundary at a very straight long-on"
"flat on off, flat-batted to long-on"
"angling into him from slightly wide of the crease, almost yorker length. He wanted to hit it straight but the inward movement beats him and strikes his pad"
"slower ball and very wide of off stump. That was clever bowling, but incredibly, it's been wided! That was inside the tram lines. Very harsh on Janat"
"this is some smart bowling by Janat. Follows the one wide of off with a yorker on off, moving in, doesn't allow any room for Hope to drive it, and he can only pat it away towards point"
"normal pace this time, angling into him from around the wicket, and he bunts it back past the bowler to mid-off"
"<b>through point's legs</b>. length ball outside off, he steers it away, but the man at point lets it go through. Bad bit of fielding. Asghar Afghan, who was nearby, hares after it and slides to pull it in before it reaches the third man boundary. But his valiant effort is in vain, because his hands touched the boundary rope while pulling the ball back in. Asghar is not happy with that call. He reckons he had pulled it back in safely. And he has a point. The umpiring has been very questionable in this game."
"fuller outside off, a flowing cover drive, but it goes straight to cover"
"angling into him, tucked off his pads while off balance between deep midwicket and long-on"
"googly foxes him completely. Went down on one knee to slog-sweep it into oblivion, but it turns past bat and turns past the keeper too"
"down the track, gets to the pitch, but can't time his heave well, and it rolls to long-on off the inside half of the bat"
"<b>another googly does it</b>. This was a bit flatter, outside off and Hetmyer was giving himself room to carve it over extra cover. Ends up with a leading edge that lobs up to point"
"quicker, flatter and shorter, he jabs it away to midwicket having gone on the back foot"
nice drift but ends up a bit overpitched and Pollard works it to midwicket
"good length outside off, Hope lunges well forward and pushes it with bat still a bit in front of pad to long-on"
"fuller outside off, crunches a cover drive to the man on the sweeper boundary"
"walking down the track, Naib spots it and not only shortens the length but takes off the pace, and all Pollard can do is tickle it to short fine leg"
"yorker, swinging into him, but Hope has dealt with it extremely well. Flicked it fine while off balance and beats short fine leg"
"slower ball, but short of a length, he waits for it and slaps a pull to deep midwicket"
"down the track again, Naib bowls it back of a length and rolls his fingers over it, and Pollard has no pace to work with. Pulls it from chest high, gets an under-edge to short fine leg"
"<b>excellent stop by Rashid at cover</b>. This was a crisp cover drive off a rare loose ball, in the slot and at normal pace, and Hope timed it well but Rashid dived to his right and stopped the ball"
"<b>beaten</b>. Classic leggie, that dips, grips and turns past the bat while drawing him forward. He's kept his back leg rooted to the crease though, so he won't be stumped"
"quicker, length ball on off, turning away, pushed to cover"
"drags it down short but keeps it wide of off, and the batsman can only toe-end a pull to deep midwicket"
"fuller on the stumps, worked to deep midwicket off the front foot. Excellent running by Hope to come to the danger end for a second run"
another beauty that spins past Pollard's outside edge while he's pushing at it
"googly, but too short, allows him to go back and pull to long-on. Not timed well"
goes very wide of the crease and angles it into him on a length. He was looking to go more legside but ends up to long-on off the inside half of the bat
"<b>lovely shot</b>. that's Hope's class. Slower ball, he got in position early but waited for it, and unleashed a free flowing smack down the ground off a horizontal bat"
"good comeback, yorker from wide of the crease that he rams into the ground and back to the bowler"
"superb bowling. Pin point yorker, tailing into middle stump. He can only dig it out back to the bowler"
"goes very wide of the crease again, slower ball on a length, flat batted to long-off"
"down the track, converts this to a leg stump half volley and flicks it to deep backward square leg"
"that's a monster leggie. Pitched on a length outside off, and spat up while turning considerably"
"another dot ball, patted towards cover"
"goes down on one knee and slaps it hard, but not timed or placed well. Goes to long-off. <b>fifty</b> for Hope who barely acknowledges it"
"beauty. He thought it was the googly and was playing inside the line, instead it spins past the bat as he's lunging forward"
"<b>unlucky for Rashid</b>. Beats him all ends up with a googly that Pollard had no clue about. Turned a long, long way, clipped his pad and runs down for four"
"<b>excellent fielding by Nabi at long-on</b>. Pollard pulled out the agricultural slog, taking it from outside off and muscling it wide of long-on. Nabi runs and stretches out a hand to push it back and prevent a boundary"
"back of a length outside off, goes back and mis-times his pull to long-on's left"
"<b>caught at deep midwicket</b>. That is a crucial, crucial wicket. Pollard has the game and the power to take the pitch out of the equation. It looked like he made good connection here too. He had moved across and picked this up from outside off, flicking it with strong wrists. Didn't get enough to clear the man, it was the longer boundary."
"normal pace, full and wide outside off. Holder flashes his bat at it, but can't connect"
"tailing into him from slightly wide of the crease, flicked with the angle to deep midwicket"
"slower ball, yorker length almost and wide of off stump. Makes Hope reach for it, he cannot get any timing on it and plays it along the ground to long-on with a horizontal bat"
"finds the gap. Slower ball dug in short, Holder uses his strength to muscle a pull between deep midwicket and long-on"
"floated up a wide yorker outside off, and Hope had no option but to throw his bat at it. Doesn't meet it on the sweet spot, and ends up hitting straight to Asghar at extra cover. He holds it reverse cup in front of his face"
too far outside off and he'll have to rebowl that
"another slower ball well outside off, he's moved across a bit but still can only get it off the end of his bat, smearing it to long-on"
"full outside off, driven to long-off"
"slower ball, back of a length. The batsman had no clue about it. Had completed his pull shot by the time the ball went past his off stump"
"another slower ball, brilliantly bowled. Wide of off this time, but rolled his hands over it so much it died on the way to the keeper. The flailing bat was nowhere near ball"
"tries to do it again but loses his radar, this time it's too far outside off and it's a wide"
"yorker on the seventh stump, he moves across and can only pat it to long-on"
"yorker tailing into him at normal pace, driven to long-off"
"<b>picks out long-on</b>. Slower ball on the seventh stump, he went for the heave, didn't time it. Got enough on it to travel all the way to long-on, but there was a fielder positioned there and it was an easy catch for him"
"full toss, he moves across and flicks it to deep midwicket"
"another slower ball, on a length and well outside off. Wild slog attempted, connected only with air"
"off cutter, banged into the pitch, he waits for it and pulls it to the man at deep square leg"
"and he'll have to rebowl that, so that's a bit of an anti climax. Went around the wicket and tailed too far into him to go down leg"
and he finishes it with a slower ball that dies on the keeper even as it goes past his attempted agricultural heave. Fitting way to finish. Afghanistan have won the series.
