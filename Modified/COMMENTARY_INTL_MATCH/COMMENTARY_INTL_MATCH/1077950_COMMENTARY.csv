"nice start, on off stump, hint of seam movement, Shehzad defends a little awkwardly to the off side"
"on middle and off, back of a length, he's jumping around the crease a little, defends towards the bowler"
"short of a length, at off stump, he defends off his toes this time"
"angled into the pads, flicked into the leg side and Walton can't stop it cleanly coming across from midwicket so allows a second"
"short of a length outside off, back cut wide of the slips down to third man"
"fuller this time, wide outside off, he drives and it skews behind point towards third man"
"starts with a wide, sprayed outside off stump"
"fiddling a little outside off, not much footwork, away from his body but guides the ball safely to point"
"good length at off stump, 127kph, defended to the covers"
"full and straight, clipped to the leg side just wide of mid-on but without much power or timing"
"outside off, 130kph, left alone"
"touch fuller, outside off, carries nicely through to the keeper at waist height"
"nearly drags on! This nips back from a good length, cramps Shehzad for room as he tries to cut, comes off the bottom edge and he's lucky it bounces away from off stump. Too full for that shot"
"gets away with this one, a full ball which is angled into the pads, Akmal misses his flick, the ball clips the pads and is well take by the keeper"
"again on the pads, again Akmal doesn't make contact, the ball cannons away towards long leg"
"back of a length at off stump, good wheels at 143kph, defended coming forward to the covers"
"pushed down the leg side, no contact with anything this time, and that's a wide...can't quite get his line right this over. Has a kick at the take-off area, like any self-respecting quick bowler after a poor delivery"
"driven on the up square of the wicket, places it wide of point but third man is able to get around"
"back of a length, 145kph, at off stump, Shehzad opens the face and finds point"
hops across to off stump and defends to the leg side
"full outside off, giving it a chance to swing, driven to mid-off"
"shorter, outside off, driven to cover"
"swings across the line of quite a full delivery, takes a bottom edge through square leg and they are able to scamper back for a second"
nudges a straight delivery in front of mid-on who can't stop the single
gets onto the front foot and drives a full delivery to cover
"wide outside off, left alone, it's just inside the tramline although Shehzad doesn't seem to agree"
"short outside off, he drags a pull to mid-on, didn't sound like a great connection off the bat"
"fuller, Akmal is stood on leg stump, pushes hard at the ball and finds midwicket"
"short again, this time he's able to pull it over the leg side but the timing isn't really there and there isn't the legs to reach the midwicket rope"
"full, at off stump, the bat face skews in his hands as he drives and it squirts into the covers"
"that's a terrific catch! Angled into the pads, again, this time Shehzad gets a tickle on it and Hope makes excellent ground to his left to take a super catch"
"full outside off, defended down by his feet"
"lovely ball! In the channel outside off, movement off the seam and it jags away from Akmal's outside edge. Good bounce and carry, too"
punched square off the back foot to point
"<b>dropped</b>! That carried to cover. A full ball, driven in the air towards cover, Walton dives forward but can't hold on"
pushed to the on side
"full and straight, a lovely piece of timing through the leg side as Azam flicks it through square leg. That zinged off the bat"
"full outside off, this one reaches Hope on the second bounce"
"short and a hint of width outside off, dispatches over point as he goes up and over with a strong cut...didn't even try to keep it down"
"gets this fuller, driven to cover"
"full, angled in at the stumps, that's good batting as he knocks it to the covers...rotate the strike against good deliveries"
"a bouncer, he ducks...and it's called a no-ball. Oops, that's a poor no-ball call. He's behind the line"
"caught at cover as he drives a full ball, Gabriel trying for the yorker...so after all that, it's a dot"
"short of a length outside off and that's a lovely back-foot drive which finds the gap, almost reaches the boundary but gets flicked back just in time"
"width again, and too short, allows Akmal to free his arms with a square drive which evades point and third man can't get around, either. Good over for Pakistan"
"gets squared up as he aims to work a delivery which was angling into the pads to the leg side, a leading edge runs to the off"
"very good from Holder, full outside off which nice shape, beats a half-hearted drive from Azam"
"appeal for lbw as this nips back off a good length, probably too high...the ball bobbles to the off side. Struck him above the pad"
"and now Akmal chases a wide one, gets beaten and Holder ponders what he has to do to find the edge"
a lucky moment as he gets a inside edge which scoots past the stumps to long leg...reaching out for a drive
"back of a length outside off, defended into backward point"
"full at off stump, defended"
short of a length and that's a dismissive stroke as he pulls it through straight wicket. Doesn't bother to run
"adjusts his length, full outside off, dropped into the point area and that's a well-judged single. Azam has immediately brought urgency to the crease"
"back of a length at off stump, dropped down by the crease and Azam calls him through for the quick single. Excellent cricket."
"and another...maybe Pakistan are learning. A length ball is defended with soft hands, point can't get in quickly enough to stop the single"
"another one down the leg side! Would you believe it. The delivery from Joseph was full and outside leg stump, Akmal aims to flick it away but can only tickle it to Hope"

"shorter, wide outside off, called wide"

"jammed into the covers, off the back foot"

tapped down to third man
"oof, that's a good ball. Hits the deck hard, ghosting back in past the inside edge, and carrying through heavily to the keeper. Unlucky not to get the nick"
"forward, and firmly drilled into the covers. Lovely high elbow, Ian Bell would have been proud of that page of the text-book"
"outside off, and cut through backward point"
"on the back foot, very full length and tailing into the right-hander. Defended"
"cuts back from a full length, a cramped cut down to third man brings up the fifty stand"

"fetches this from outside off, walking down the pitch, and whips through the leg side. He's busy"

There is a noise as this skims past the inside edge - Imad aiming a flick to the leg side from a full ball - he's been given caught behind and has <b>reviewed</b> because the ball might have clipped the stump but not dislodged the bail. Certainly a noise. Appears to be daylight as ball passes bat. Remember, given out on the field. Did it glance the pad, too? Pretty sure that has clipped the off stump but is the evidence conclusive? No Snicko or Hot Spot available, so the third umpire can only go on the pictures. This is a tough one for the third umpire...and it's overturned!"

"huge appeal for lbw, given not out by Gould...Powell does get well across and the <B>review</b> has been called for, almost straightaway from Sarfraz (on Hasan's insistence).

goes back and works to the leg side
"low full toss, he goes down early and paddle sweeps fine of short fine leg but Junaid is able to catch it"

"plays back, defends to the on side"
takes the pad to the leg side
""
"flicked into midwicket, can't beat the man inside the circle"
"terrific catch by the skipper! Mohammed won't be the hero tonight. Going for the sweep, he's through the shot and the ball balloons off the glove. Sarfraz is very alert, spins around and then dives to complete the catch behind him"
"tight line, full length, a bit of a leading-edge poke into the covers to get off the mark"
"good probing full length, attacking the splice on the back foot"
high-elbowed defence to mid-on
"tapped out to point, lovely tight line"
"pushed into the covers, and that looks like an <B>official warning</B> for Hasan Ali for following-through on the danger area"
"subconciously, Ali drifts a touch wider and that's a lovely languid drive through the covers"
"thumped into the off-side once again, good attacking intent as Holder scampers back for two"
"on the toes, flicked through midwicket"
"slow and loopy, worked to the leg side"
defended to point
an intentful push back to the bowler. Long levers
thumped into the gap at long-on
"onto the front foot, blocked back down the pitch"
"Imad, round the wicket, with a touch of drift. Pushed out to the covers"
"leg-sided, Carter climbs into a guilt-free slog-sweep, knowing he can't be lbw. Deflects fine"
stands tall in defence
"right under the eyeline, punched down to long-off"
"full length, and blocked"
into line to defend once more
"deep in the crease, hoisted French-cricket-style out through midwicket"
"round the wicket, attacking the left-hander's edge"
too short this time and that's a lovely violent flog of a back-foot drill. Clean through the covers
"wicket-to-wicket delivery, Carter picks the wrong ball to sweep, and the wrong ball to miss! Thinks about the review, but I don't think that was missing much!"
"floated onto a full length outside off, dabbed down to long-on"

no way through there
defended into the off side
"well bowled, teasing flight, tight line, demanding respect"
"good length once again, strikes the pad, but with a hint of inside edge to protect against an appeal"
worked into the leg side
"outside off, a fraction too short, but Nurse can't cash in"
"huge appeal, and that's given! It's the wrong'un, completely bamboozled Nurse, who <B>reviews</B>, as well he might ... beats the inside edge, hits the back leg, and it's really a question of height... and it is <B>missing!</B>"
"twirled onto a good length, bat and pad tight in defence"
"swept, and swept fine"
"big spin, the leg break this time, and not a hope of picking that"
"swept again, and gets enough bat on it this time to pierce the field at backward square"
"swept again, kept it down well"
forward in defence
"poked in the air, and Shehzad at short mid-off can't lean forward in timer"
"quicker through the air, and more circumspect in defence"
"leaning onto the front foot, pushed to cover"
"on the back foot, and punched into the covers"
"half an appeal as Shadab slides one into the back pad, via a slither of bat"

thumped into the covers for another single
forward and defended into the off side
"reverse sweep, and nicely connected"
tight line
zipping through
down the leg side
"full length, and that is a revolting but very effective slog to entirely the wrong ball. Hoisted into the gap at midwicket"
tapped into the covers
"another wild hoick, more big spin to leave the batsman grasping at thin air"
"up and over! That one was in the slot, and utterly butchered into the stands! Loads of bottom hand, and spanked mercilessly over cow corner!"

"sharp spin from just back of a length, deflected to gully"
"solidly onto the front foot, open-faced defence"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
"that's a ripper, Shane Warne special, a bit of drift to leg, then spitting to off. No chance of edging that"
threaded into the covers
"tight line and length, defended"
"pounded high and hard through the grasp of point to snaffle a welcome boundary and bring up the fifty stand. In the slot, using the pace, and walloping it square. Effective"
"good riposte, some extra intent and a stare to follow up"
"a fraction too short, and that's another tremendous belligerent strike, off the back foot and hoisted through midwicket"
"width, and cracked through point for two more runs. The extra pace has worked for Windies"
"strikes the back pad, and up goes the finger! It's <B>reviewed</B> but this is surely smashing the stumps... indeed it is... Hasan gave up a few runs but made the incision soon enough!"
"onto the front foot, pushed into the covers"
"big spin once again, beats another wafty slog"
"sharp turn, but arguably six inches too short to be dangerous"
"on the back foot, defended down the track"
"low full toss, clipped hungrily out to deep midwicket ... and was that a run-out chance? Either way, Shadab comes off the worse, as he tries to field a violent shy and wears it on his bowling hand! A direct hit would have been out ..."
"no ill effects, as this one is pushed out to point"
"open face, full length, punched out to deep cover"
"tight line, good pace"
"round the wicket, a touch of swing from a full length, fenced into the covers"
"edged, but doesn't carry. Very full length, and soft hands on the back foot. Good probing though"
"edged again, and perfectly placed in the gap between keeper and first slip! Didn't carry to either, but Hasan is righteously indignant all the same"
"full once again, attacking the top of off, defended off the back foot into the covers"
worked into the gap

into line to defend
flicked attractively through midwicket
"spanked in the air, out of the reach of cover, and up comes the 150"
beats the outside edge with another lovely legspinner
"nearly picks out long-off, lifts a very full delivery down the ground"
big appeal for lbw as this spins back in sharply at the left hander but may have struck outside off
and now does him with the googly as Bishoo lunges forward
this time it's a full toss and gets swept firmly to deep square leg
and that's stone dead! A skiddy delivery traps Bishoo on the back foot and it was heading for middle (and maybe leg) stump. The fellow leggie didn't read his opposite number
"full at leg stump, clipped through midwicket and that's a wonderful piece of timing and placement as he finds the rope"
"swing and a miss, almost gets his off stump hint...then Holder appears to grab the back of his leg"
a dab-sweep through short fine leg
moves away outside leg to give himself room and then fails to make contact
driven to cover
"finds cover again, so he can't get the strike"
"lovely stuff, full at off stump, a sharp leg spinner and the No. 10 is nowhere near it"

"very full, quite wide, driven to the cover sweeper"
"a googly to end the over, gets well forward and drives to long-off"
"round the wicket, full and straight, eased down the ground to long-off"
"back of a length outside off and keeps a little low, although Joseph was also stabbing at it off the back foot"
defended to the off side
"a fuller delivery, he drives, spoons the ball in the air but away from the off-side fielders"
"full at middle and off, a touch slower as rolls his fingers over the ball, defended"
"back of a length, tries to angled it away but finds backward point"
"round the wicket, pushed down the leg side"
"back outside off, blocked to cover"
"back of a length, defended back to the bowler"
short of a length and angled down to third man
"driven into the off side, the fielder sprawls after it"
"slower ball, full outside off, Holder prods forward and the ball goes in the air for a while but falls short of point"
"full and straight, flicked to deep square leg"
"a slower short ball, Holder is through his pull early and there's a small appeal for a caught behind off a glove"
"that's big! Enough of the tapping around, he's taken a stride out of his crease and swung a back-of-a-length ball over deep midwicket with a straight bat"
now he drives through the off side and has the placement to beat the sweeper...super way to reach a half-century
clipped off the pads and almost gets it past short fine leg
"full toss outside off, driven into the covers where Shehzad can't stop it cleanly"
"another boundary! Full outside off, he plays a push-drive, not great force, and the thick edge flies through the vacant slip cordon. Actually, much more credit to Holder. That was very deftly played. Opened the face late"
played to the leg side
"full at off stump, driven to the sweep...sensible from Joseph"
"huge appeal for caught behind! Not given. Was a lovely legspinner, turned sharply. Think the bat grazed the pitch which made a sound"
defended to backward point
played to the bowler
"waits for this to turn, a legspinner, and drives but picks out cover...a cheap over for Pakistan"
"round the wicket, full at off stump, very correctly driven to mid-off"
"smartly flicked into the leg side, out to deep square"
"gets across the crease and attempts to scoop this, gets it towards short fine leg"
"short outside off, pulled over midwicket wide of long-on"
"push and run, smart cricket"
"a slower ball, dragged down, heaved through the leg side and deep square has to scamper around the rope"
"a googly, doesn't pick it, almost spins between bat and pad"
that's a big spinner! Massive turn from outside off and Sarfraz takes it almost off the cut strip
defended
"and now does him with the googly again, spins back between the inside edge. Lovely"
and now beats him on the outside edge as he drives
"touch shorter, plays back, defends a legspinner to the off side...a maiden in the 42nd over (think WI bowled one in the 41st from memory)"
heaves across the line of a full delivery and gets an inside edge past the stumps which runs down to fine leg
driven firmly to cover on the edge of the circle
"crunched! Straight down the ground, but Babar is able to get across from long-on"
"tries to get cute here with a scoop shot, the ball bounces and takes him on the shoulder"
"a straight full toss, swung along the ground to deep midwicket"
"full at the stumps, driven through the covers and wide of mid-off...they are able to spring back for the second as the fielder is a little slow getting up"
"moves away outside leg stump, takes the pads to the off side"
"aims for the leg-stump yorker, it's a low full toss, flicked down to long-on"
digs out a full delivery to the on side...brings up the fifty stand. Out with a direct hit from midwicket
"full at leg stump, driven to long-on"
"beats him outside off with a wider yorker, Joseph drove over the top of the delivery...Amir keeps clutching at his shoulder"
"full and straight, driven to cover"
"it's Hasan again! Tries to go down the ground, was a back of a length delivery, aimed to clear mid-off who was inside the circle but it came off near the bottom of the bat and mid-off was able to track the ball down just outside the circle"
"gets the yorker in, he's been very good today, jabbed to backward point"
"another yorker, right on target, Holder can only play it back to the bowler"
"big full toss, he swings and gets an outside edge which bounces in front of Sarfraz - ends up being a good stop by the captain"
"he finishes with five! A back-of-a-length delivery, he may have taken the pace off the ball, and Holder can't get hold of it, just manages to club it down to long-off where, quite fittingly, Babar Azam takes the catch"
