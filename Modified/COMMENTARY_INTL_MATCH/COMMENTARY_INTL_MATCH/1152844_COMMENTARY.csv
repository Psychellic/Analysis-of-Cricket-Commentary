"full and fast again, <strong>91.6mph</strong>. That is encouraging signs already. Solid defence"
"banged in short, a <B>top-edged pull, and that soars over the rope behind the keeper's head!</B> Moral victory to the bowler, but maximum reward to the batsman"
"back on a full and straight length. This is a hot over, 92.2mph now ..."
"outside off, tucked into the off side, point gathers."

"fast and full, stout defence once more"
"attempted pull, and <B>that's hurt Imam!</B> He flings away his bat and rushes towards square leg before crumbling to the floor. <B>Ow, that's hit him flush on the elbow!</B> 89mph, and straight as a die, he looks in an awful lot of pain... here's hoping it's just the funny bone playing tricks, not a fracture"
"outside off, stabbed into the off side"
"<strong>a floppy pull, lobbed over the head of mid-on!</strong> Loose stroke, and that's the power of quick bowling. Lucky to get away with that one"
"pressing forward, drilled to cover"

"too short, a <B>gossamer-light deflection off a scuffed pull</B> and that's ample to send it way wide of the keeper!"
"<B>a smoke across the line!</B> Full again, Fakhar's right leg goes for a chat with the square leg umpire, and a wild hoick is battered past backward square!"
"tapped to the off side, thinks he's beaten Stokes, but he hasn't! The shy comes in, on the dive, and <strong>that would have been so close!</strong>"

"slower ball, met with a cautious pull to square leg. England, for all the lack of wickets, are getting through their overs with little damage"

"glanced to the onside, quick single. Bit of hesitation there but no harm done"
"cleared over the mid off fielder. Fakhar made some room for himself, and middles this one nicely!"
"attempted sweep, struck on the pad, but well outside leg stump"

"slower ball, Babar gets a thick inside edge on it, goes away to deep square"

"slower ball again, Babar angles this away to sweeper cover"

"two runs, sloppy overthrow. Denly hits the stumps from the outfield, but the ricochet allows the batsmen an extra run"
"on the pads, a legbye"

drifting towards leg and flicked away for a couple
"<b>brilliant work on the rope!</b> Hafeez clubbed a full toss towards long-off but Roy caught and released in one movement... only there was no one nearby to follow up and complete the catch! We've got used to such acrobatic skills, but that was superbly done, preventing six. Not sure how Hafeez and Babar only managed to run a single there, too"
"flighted, outside off stump and driven to the sweeper"
"sliding down the leg side, Rashid is convinced there was an inside edge on this... Alex Wharf doesn't give it but England <b>review!</b> Was it pad or bat? Clearly thigh pad on the replay and Hafeez will continue"

"quicker ball, Hafeez goes back and cuts but picks out backward point"
"<b>missed stumping!</b> Dances down, swing and a miss - <b>but Buttler hasn't grasped it with Hafeez stranded!</b> A mistake by England's stand-in captain, although it was one of those hard ones that you only sight at the last moment, he went for it leg side but the ball deflected off the fingertips to short fine leg, and the chance was gone"

"short ball, 89mph and Hafeez pulls... <b>flubbed to mid-on!</b> Wood chips out a vital wicket after a composed stand. Dug in and the extra pace meant he couldn't control the shot, which lobbed gently to Jordan, on as a sub, going to his right"

"on the legs, worked square ... half-stopped but they scamper the single"
"thumped on the pad, down the leg side, as Imad fires one through faster and flatter"
"eased down the ground, an easy single to long on"
"whipped off the toes, not cashing in on a bit of a freebie on that occasion"
"tight line, solid defence"
"<B>big appeal!</B> That was very full, and slightly leg-sided. Serious thoughts of a review but Sarfaraz reckons that would have been sliding down"
"outside off, a hint of swing, <B>crunched through the covers</B>, not a terrible ball from Hasnain, almost 90mph, but the width gave Roy licence to free his arms"
"up on the toes, cracked to cover with a very pleasing click of willow"
worked to the leg side
worked off the pads to the leg side
"fully forward, worked into the covers"
fired down the leg side
"fired through outside off stump, an attempted cut"
worked off the legs once more
"smeared out to the deep... and <B>dropped</B>! Fakhar scuttles back, sticks out his mitts to cling onto a skewed drive, and it's straight through"
"swept with intent, behind square. So nearly the breakthrough, now six from two balls"
nudges the single to keep the strike... Pakistan's butter finger give Roy an early life once more
eased down to long on
"good delivery, chopped down into the crease, and another scampered single"
"outside off, chopped down to third man"
worked off the pads to the leg side
zips through as Roy has a waft and can't make contact. Any sort of bat on that pull would have flown
"opens the face, and fenced down to third man"
eased down the track to long-off
"full length, pressed with a full face to mid-on"
"slightly back of a length, chopped back down the pitch"
"right up to the toes, biffed through the line to long-off"
"very full, worked to the leg side"
"full length, and pushed through the line"
"banged into the deck, Roy winds up for the big smear down the pitch, and ends up playing a tennis-smash to mid-off"
worked down to third man once more
"a pull off a good length, and <B>VInce is struck on the helmet, via a top-edge</B>. He's fine, but out comes the physio"
"outside off, tight line, fenced into the covers off the back foot"
"short and hauled into the leg side, finds the gap behind square"
"banged in short, a <B>top-edged pull through fine leg</B>! in the air for a while, but ends up dribbling over the rope as the fielder makes an utter horlicks of it"
"outside leg, too full, <B>swept with venom!</B> A one-bounce four, inches inside the rope at backward square"
"<strong>thrashed down to third man</strong>, bobbles towards the rope ... just about hauled back in after a long chase"
pumped into the covers
"very full, into the toes, pressed to the off side"
"thrashed off a good length, freeing the arms but not finding the timing into the covers"
"belted down the ground, Junaid fields this one cleanly after his fumble last over"
thumped into the covers
"short again, pulled with intent behind square, a big ironic cheer as Junaid fields on the bounce at fine leg"
"<strong>bowled him!</strong> Vince slides back into his crease, in anticipation of the short ball, but he ended up hopping late into line as the ball skidded through from a full length, and it's under-edged into his stumps"
"fired into the toes, good pace from Hasnain but slightly off-line, worked to midwicket to get off the mark"
"short, <B>top-edged pull</B>, sails away to the rope for another well-worked fifty"
"very full, slapped to cover, another well-judged single"
"makes room outside leg, eases a single down to long-on"
pushed out to cover
"that's too wide, a non-spinning pie, half-way down the pitch, and spanked through point. An immediate apology"
"back on a tight line and length, pushed to cover"
"onto the front foot, crunched to cover"
"<B>short and wide, battered through point!</B> You can't bowl there. Imad needs a drink. And so do we all..."
"begins slightly short, worked away to the onside"
"short again, a misfield at mid-on allows the batsmen to scuttle through"
"more flight this time, defended back to the bowler"
"Root comes down the wicket, the ball was tossed up. Hafeez dragged it back, though and Root guides to long-on"
"goes on the back foot and tries to biff this past extra cover, only to find the fielder"
"almost squared him up there, I think that kept straight. Roy was looking to heave but readjusts smartly."
"Imad bowls straight at the stumps, Root helps it to deep square"
"slightly more flight, that was uppish. That's poor fielding though from Malik at mid-on. A fumble allows the batsmen to dash through for two"
"quicker and straighter, jabbed to long-on for a single"
"flighted again, Root drives to cover"
"wider line this time, Root can only find the short third man fielder"
"struck straight back. This is a better over from Imad, who had struggled up to now."
"keeps low but Roy adjusts smartly, thwacks it through the covers"
"dragged wider down legside, dabbed to fine leg and a single is scampered"
helped to midwicket
Roy steps outside leg stump and drives to long-off
"more flight this time, and Root content to work it away for one."
"struck down to mid-off, good fielding prevents the single. This is better from Pakistan, but England milking the singles all too easily still."
"slightly short of a length, Root effortlessly jabs it down to the onside boundary"
"short again, and helped down to third man. This is far too comfortable for England right now."
blacked to mid-off
"full, lovely drive by Root. Junaid gets a hand on it and Roy has to be alert, but the batsmen manage to change ends"
helped away to third man again
"lovely pick-up, but goes straight to the midwicket fielder."
blocked straight back to Hafeez
"flighted, Root flicks to the leg side"
bowled on a good length but harmless enough. Root comfortably jabs to the leg side and gets to the other end
"slapped to long-off. Was that a potential Mankad chance? Hafeez stopped in his tracks, but the batsman was in his crease"
worked away to long-on
"Hafeez drags his length back again, and Root has no problems keeping the strike with a drive to long-on"
Roy thought about lofting it over midwicket but opts to caress down to third man instead
flicked cleverly down to the leg side. There haven't been many boundaries but absolutely no sense England are in any pressure
"just as I say it, <strong>scooped for six</strong>! What a lovely shot that was. Premeditated, but Roy lifts this one over fine leg, and it carries all the way over the short boundary. Terrific confidence and timing"
"shorter and slower, beats Roy"
"another absolutely <strong>terrific strike</strong>. That is filthy talent from Roy. Short delivery, Roy picks it up extremely early and swipes away to square leg, where it carries all the way. What quiet period?"
"helped this one to third man, 15 from this over, and England are cruising at the moment"
"Roy makes some room and smacks through the off side, but finds the fielder"
comes down the pitch and pushes to wide long-off. England go to 150 off 21.2 overs
straight to short midwicket
helped down the field for a single
"punched through the offside, the batsman rush through for one"
Root uses his feet and works it away to the boundary fielder
"punched to point, nearly paid the price there! A direct hit would have had Root struggling at the non-striker's end, and he needed the dive"
blocked through the off side
"short, and slapped down to midwicket. No timing, but it was along the ground"
"short again, Root swivels without getting any timing on it"
"swung in ever so slightly, and takes a thick inside edge. Good over from Hasan, this"
"tails in again and smacks Root on the pads. Going down leg comfortably, but got the bowler and keeper excited. for a while. Good stuff from Hasan to kick off his second spell"
"Roy lifts it over the infield on the offside, but doesn't quite middle it and the fielder cuts it off"
"ooh, that was tempting. Roy thought about going over the top, but wisely defends it instead"
"gets the short boundary on this occasion. Scythes it through the infield, and there's no stopping it for long-on there"
"<strong>hundred for Roy, and how!</strong> Nails it, sending the ball sailing over the short boundary over extra cover again. Just 75 balls to get it, and well deserved. This could be one of those daddy hundreds!"
blocked back to Hafeez
blocked agian
"Root getting in on the action here. No aggression whatsoever, just a classy backfoot cut. Sends the ball racing to the point boundary! England on the charge again"
"pushed to the offside boundary, and the fielder can't prevent them taking two"
"slower, and keeps low. Root beaten as he attempts to cut through the offside agian"
"shorter, Root blocks back to the bowler"
called wide and  Sarfaraz has to stretch to avoid conceding any byes
"again, this is ordinary stuff from Hasan. Short again, and sails over Root's head, wasn't even in the same post code. Sarfaraz leaps high, but it's a hopeless cause, and goes to the rope for five wides"
guided through to sweeper cover
"good way to finish. a little bit of extra bounce, and the ball whizzes past Roy's outside edge as he looked to guide away to third man"
too full and driven back past the bowler. Mid-on is at hand to cut it off though
"full again, Hasnain trying to find some swing, with no luck so far. Played nicely to midwicket, but a fielder cuts it off"
"short, Root manages to spoon it away to deep midwicket"
"took some pace off that and thumped it into the surface. Root finds the same fielder on the boundary, but brilliant running from Roy ensures the batsmen get home comfortably"
"short, <strong>slapped away </strong>for a boundary! Roy picks up the length absurdly early, and is waiting for it. A baseball swing clears mid-on and sends it to the boundary."
"on a length, and the batsman helps it through the onside. Eight more runs leaked. This is a complete canter at the moment."
"Imad holds his length after Roy charges him, but whipped away for one"
"fuller, but dragged down to the legside, where Root tickles it away for a teasing chase. Poor Hasnain puts in a dive, but can't stop the ball hitting the rope"
"<strong>dropped!</strong> This is awful stuff from Pakistan. Root charges and sends it straight to mid-off at a comfortable, catchable height, where Junaid Khan puts it down."
worked away through the offside
"Roy guides to short third, no run to be had though"
"slashed past mid-off, and it takes the boundary fielder to cut it off. Good over from Imad, but frustrating with the dropped catch"
"good length from Hasnain. Roy moves away to try and scythe through the covers, but the pace beats him. Good pace, too, slightly over 90mph"
"beautiful delivery. On a good length and both bowler and keeper go up, convinced the batsman got a slight tickle on this. They don't review, though, and replays shows it flicked the pad"
"good pace again, but <strong>this is classy </strong>from Roy. Anticipated the length, and gets a feather touch on it, running it to the third man boundary."
"<strong>gone!</strong> By far the worst delivery of the over, with Hasnain dragging it well wide of leg stump. Roy swivels and looks to loft it over the fine leg boundary, but gets a nick this time."
"hint of swing, but wide down the legside, and Sarfraz dives to collect. Well, fumble, but collect eventually"
"quick once more, <strong>his fastest delivery of the day </strong>at 91.5! Stokes defends through the offside"
"Short, but not quite as accurate this time. It takes only two deliveries for Stokes to feel confident enough to pick this one up early and pull away off the front foot to the legside boundary"
"swept to fine leg, the pair scamper through for two"
pushed through to midwicket
"<strong>juggled but caught!</strong> Root rushes down the wicket and gets an outside edge. It goes to Hafeez at short third, and the chance looked to have gone after it popped out of Hafeez's single propelled hand. But caught on the second attempt!"
flicked away to the legside
"<strong>Buttler gone too! What's happening here?</strong> Full toss from Imad, ball drifting leg side and he was through it early, I think. Two wickets in 3 balls"
"darted down to Moeen, defended straight back"
"Hasnain is slightly wide of off, and Stokes leaves this well alone. Bit of consolidation is in order, methinks"
"another one left unharassed, straight through to Sarfraz"
"good bowling, this was nervy from the England allrounder. Jabs unconvincingly at it, and never quite gets close. Three dot balls in a row, with no bat on ball!"
"<strong>excellent comeback from Stokes</strong>! Waited for the ball to come to him and strokes it away through point. Uses the pace of Hasnain, and helps himself to a pressure-easing boundary"
"shorter, higher, and Stokes blocks this with minimum fuss"
"guided through to third man, and this is lamentable from Junaid! He's had a mare down there. Should have been easily cut off, but the poor bloke misfields, and allows the ball to trickle over the rope."
"wide of off, slow and a bit of spin"
"<strong>top-edged and gone!</strong> Poor cricket from Moeen and the change has worked! A wide ball again, and it spun away from the left-hander. Moeen looked to smear it over the onside, and Fakhar sprints back to complete a brilliant running catch. The lower middle order is in now"
Stokes reaches forward and defends on off
"lobbed up, gripping a touch and Stokes defends"
"flatter, clipped off the back foot towards midwicket"

"short of a length and whipped through midwicket, they scurry back for two"
"length, 80mph and tapped towards the man inside the ring"
"goes round the wicket, angling in and pushed to the on side, midwicket hurtles in and fields on the dive. The men in green are alive now"
"slower delivery, poked tentatively towards mid-off"
"good length, 85mph and slightly wide as Stokes drops back to steers to third man"
"over the wicket, good licks as the ball nips in at 87mph and catches Denly on the thigh"

"shortish and nipping back in at 87mph, struck on the pads"
touch too straight with his line and Denly flicks behind square
"bounces him, up around the eyes, but Stokes goes toe-to-toe (so to speak), <b>whumps a pull away through backward square</b> - that gives fine leg no chance!"
tucked into a gap for one
bit of width and Stokes thunders a cut through point to the sweeper
"short ball, dispatched behind square on the pull and the fielder has to run around"
"cutter from Junaid, I think, as the ball dips and swerves with Denly stuck on the crease and beaten, the ball bouncing over the stumps, too"
"pitched up, 84mph and squired off the pads for one through square"
"length delivery in the channel, Stokes satisfies himself with opening the face and gliding one to third man - <b>brings England's 250 up</b>"
"Denly loses the left-armer again, something about the angle, plays around one in the channel"
"over the wicket, skidding on with the arm as Stokes goes back and misses with a cut"

clipped into the leg side from the crease
"Stokes makes the move and swings hard, only manages to toe-end a cut to extra cover"
"short of a length, 81mph and swatted down to long-on"
"short, cutting the fingers over the ball, Denly is in position to pull but gets nowhere near it because of the lack of pace"
"another slowie, Denly mistimes the pull... <b>superbly taken by Junaid off his own bowling!</b> Foxed him again with the cutter, Denly's shot looping seemingly out of reach into the leg side, only for Junaid to take off to his right like a man ten years younger and pluck it with one hand!"

"round the wicket, pushed through on leg stump and defended"

low full toss and Curran slices it through backward point for four! Just used the pace and it rocketed away
"what's going on here...?? <b>Nearly a run out as Curran is sent back</b>, the direct hit then ricochets into the covers and Stokes wants two! Curran has to motor his way back to the striker's end, <b>and just about makes it in time!</b> Nearly run out twice off the same ball!"
