"Boult angles a back-of-a-length ball into the pads of Zaman. He loses his shape, swings to the leg side, does not make contact with the bat. The ball homes in, grazes the pad, and disturbs the stumps. The plan to Fakhar was clear: cramp him for room. Boult has executed it to perfection"
"Boult and the wicketkeeper think they have their man! Umpires Raza and Wilson converge and refer it to the TV umpire. Boult nails a wide yorker, Azam hangs back, jabs his bat down. Did the ball bounce before carrying it to Taylor at first slip? Replays suggest that it did not bounce and flew to first slip. Outstanding chest-high grab from Taylor to go with his half-century. He ultimately hangs onto the ball on the rebound. Ahoy, two in two for Boult"
"<strong>Boult, you beauty! In his first match of the tour, new-dad Boult bags a hat-trick</strong>. Good length, swings back in just enough at 141ks, catches Hafeez in the crease, hits the front pad on the knee-roll. Pitching in line, impact in line, and hitting leg stump. Hafeez reviews in vain. Boult becomes the third New Zealander after Morrison and Bond to claim a hat-trick in ODIs. After Taylor seemed to publicly question the legality of his bowling action, Hafeez gets trapped for a first-ball duck. Rather subdued celebrations from Boult. He looks skywards and is embraced by his new-ball partner and friend Tim Southee"
