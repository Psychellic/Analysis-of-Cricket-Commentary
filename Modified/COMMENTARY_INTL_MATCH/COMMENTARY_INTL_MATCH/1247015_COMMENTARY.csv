Vince backs away from leg with Saqib following him on a fullish length, he whips this crisply and it whistles to Irfan, who reaches up and plucks this at head height, 7 feet for him.

Definitely not a bump ball, and a clean catch too. Rutherford has to begrudgingly walk off. Dhani knew immediately it was a clean wicket and celebrated wildly when Brathwaite took the catch."
