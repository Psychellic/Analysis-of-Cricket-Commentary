"<b>edged and taken!</b> Just the start Peshawar needed. On a good length just outside off, but angling into Shafiq. Tries to defend off the back foot, but takes a thick outside edge. Comfortably held on by Sammy at first slip"
"with the bowler targeting his pads, Tamim gets down low and sweeps it over short fine leg. Good cricket. He knows if he can get it over the man inside the circle, it's an easy boundary"
"flat and just outside off, Tamim flicks to mid-on"
"premeditates a sweep, Nawaz tries to fire it in, but his anxiety over that 60 m boundary shows as he bowls a long hop that Tamim hammers over short fine leg"
pitches it outside leg stump and Tamim lets it go to collect the wide
nudges a length ball on middle to midwicket
"steps out but Nawaz does well to spear it into Tamim's pads, not allowing him the chance to free his arms. As a result, the batsman can only flick to midwicket"
"<b>inswing</b>, and it's considerable enough to pin Kamran on the pads as he tries to flick. Good pace from the left-armer, pitching the ball on middle and troubling the batsman"
flicks a full delivery on middle and leg to midwicket
"chops on! The centurion from a few nights ago is out for a duck in the Eliminator. Excellent bowling from Rahat. He's been bowling at rapid pace in this PSL, and it shows here, with an in-form batsmen being a bit late on the ball. Kamran attempts to guide it through point, but it gets a bit big on him, secures the inside edge and clatters into the stumps"
"climbs on Fletcher, who has to yank his bottom hand off the bat to try and keep the ball down to long leg"
"<b>beats him</b> with the outswinger. Lovely bowling from Rahat, pitching the ball up to draw the left-hander forward, but not quite allowing him the easy drive"
"<b>goes past the edge again</B>, this time with a shorter delivery angled in at the left-hander and then moving away off the pitch"
"good length on leg stump, Fletcher blocks it"
"sensational running catch from Thisara! He is at mid-on as the ball sails over his head, looking to break through the stratosphere, but he knows it is horribly timed. He runs and runs, flat out, tracking the ball over his shoulder, which is pretty hard work. Then reaches out with both hands and claims his prize. Superb cricket! But he's not done yet. His momentum means he's almost at the wide long-on boundary, and is about to usher the ball over it. So he hits the brakes, changes direction and runs over to celebrate with a band of grateful team-mates"
"keeps it nice and tight on middle stump, Tamim blocks"
"cramps the left-hander again, and he misses the flick"
plants the front leg across outside off and whips the ball away to the square leg boundary. The lesser pace from Hamza allows him to pull that shot off
"back of a length and outside off, slaps it, a bit uppishly, to point"
guides a fuller delivery outside off down to third man
"shifts his weight back, pulls up that front leg and essays that trademark swivel pull to the square leg boundary. Outstanding batting from Tamim"
blocks a back of a length delivery outside off. Better line from Rahat
nails it through the covers! And this isn't a half-volley either. Tamim just sees the width on it and goes after the ball with single-minded purpose
"good length ball outside off, blocks"
works a shortish delivery on middle and off stump to the left of mid-on
"back of a length and outside off, Tamim gets up off his toes and punches the ball to point."
leaps off his feet again to try and get on top of the shortish delivery and pushes it back to mid-on
hits high on the bat as Hafeez looks to guide the ball through the covers
"on the pads with fine leg up... that's asking for trouble. Hafeez whips it away, with little more than a flick of his wrists. Good shot. Poor ball"
"runs at the left-armer, who bangs it in short to escape punishment. A panic-striken Hafeez goes for the slog, gets an inside edge and it scurries past the stumps and the keeper too"
lovely timing as Hafeez steers a short and wide delivery to the point boundary like a kind stranger on the road offering directions
"on the pads, with Nawaz bowling around the wicket to the left-hander. Tamim works it through square leg"
"pushes it through on off stump, Hafeez stays put and blocks to extra cover"
lets the quicker ball come to him and flicks it away effortlessly to long leg
flicks the shortish delivery on leg stump to deep square leg

turns a ball on his pads through square leg
nudges it away behind square leg
"steps out, a little too early, and that allows Hassan Khan to pull his length back and force Tamim to block"
clips it off his pads to deep square leg
backs away as he crunches a flatter delivery on middle and leg to mid-off's left
wades out of his crease to get to the pitch of a tossed up ball and launches it straight down the ground. Magnificent strike.

"goes around the wicket for a tossed up ball outside off, Hafeez pats it back to Mahmudullah"
"the bowler knocks over off stump, and Sarfraz knocks over the rest! Hafeez premeditates a sweep and the offspinner fires in an arm ball, sneaking under the bat swing and nailing the target. Lovely stuff from Mahmudullah"
comes down the pitch for a flick through midwicket
clips a fullish delivery on middle and off through wide mid-on
"shimmies down again, and Mahmudullah does his best not to let the batsman reach the pitch of it. Eventually, Dawson can only work it to long-on"
"brings out the straight bat to punch the flatter, quicker delivery on leg stump to long-on"
"goes back despite the ball being fairly full, but blocks it well enough"
"short ball outside leg stump, Tamim sweeps it hard, but he can't beat short fine leg"
"a juggle at long-on, but Kohler-Cadmore manages to cling on. He does most of the hard work easily enough, moving to his right to get under the ball, but what should have been an easy catch becomes a hair-raising experience as the ball pops out once, twice and finally, just before it hits the turf, he sticks out his left hand and gains control of it. Tamim's dash down the pitch for a heave over the boundary doesn't quite work out"
"full and outside off, he drives through point"
"tosses it up on off stump, Nasim stretches forward to block"
steers it to the sweeper cover
"makes him reach outside off, and all for a little block. Excellent bowling from Mahmudullah, deceiving the new man in with drift"
"and the batsman hits back immediately with a scorching cover drive. Full and wide, all Nasim does is open the face as he drives, and the ball simply skips away"
"goes around the stumps to arrow it into the blockhole outside off. Nasim doesn't make contact. Sarfraz can't collect it cleanly enough for a stumping. But then again, how can a keeper do so when he's faced with a yorker?"
carves it to deep point
massive full toss - called wide for the height - and Dawson clobbers it to the wide long-on boundary
<b>free hit ball</b> is a rank long hop and Dawson rocks back to pull it over deep midwicket with an almighty swing of his blade
"<b>dropped</b> as Nasim comes down the track and hits it back at the bowler. Hassan has to jump up and shove both hands over his head, and having got a good piece of it, he might rue how it pops out and goes off to where mid-on might have been"
clears the front leg and smears the length ball outside off to the cover boundary. Outstanding shot.
comes forward and blocks the full ball on middle
"<b>nearly bowls him</B> with a back of a length ball, ripe for the cut shot, becomes a zooter. Rushes by at ankle height and Dawson only just stops its progress to the stumps"
flicks it through midwicket
backs away and cuts the flatter delivery outside off to deep point

opens the face to guide the good length ball to point

presses forward to block into the covers
pins him on the crease and Nasim can only push the ball on off stump to cover again
"steps away from his stumps, then runs at the bowler, but all of it is for naught as Nasim only blocks a quicker delivery to cover"
"Thisara with a super catch, again! He runs to his left from long-on, leaps to get in line with a ball that is still set to go over his head, but then he sticks out his hands, takes it cleanly, and then comes down well within the boundary line. Special stuff to end an innings that was going nowhere fast. Nasim's gone, Peshawar struggling"
presses forward to block on middle
turns it off his pads through midwicket
hares down the track to hammer a short of a length delivery that gives him room over extra cover. Excellent contact
"<b>direct hit at the non-striker's</b>. But Asif has made it just in time. He thought there was a single the moment Dawson turned a good length ball into the leg side, but Nawaz at midwicket moved to the ball very quickly to create half a chance"
"backs away and guides a short delivery away to the deep third man. Good cricket, batting under pressure. He's the only one trying to set the defending champions up for a decent total"
"slower ball, short of a length, pushes it through to sweeper cover"
"picks the gap between long leg and square leg. Superb hit from Asif, lifting the ball off his hips and straight into a place where no one can get to it"
"he's deceived by a slower ball, reaching out for it before it arrives, but there aren't any close-in fielders at point now to worry about"
whips a full delivery on middle away to deep midwicket
comes down the track and launches a length ball into a red-carpet kind-of setting right behind the sightscreen. Such rapid feet to tackle what was a fast and flat delivery

"back of a length and outside off, dabs it to short third man"
blocks a good length ball to point
"full and outside off, drives to the sweeper"
"chips it straight to short midwicket. The idea is to get a single, return the strike to Dawson, but Asif's plans of shuffling across outside off to get the ball over the leg-side infield are foiled by a Rahat Ali slower ball."
"back of a length on off stump, blocks"
"Sammy <b>might be run-out</b> as he limps across to the other end. He dabs the ball to point and drags himself across for a single. Replays, however, confirm that his desperate dive at the very end has saved him from a Hasan Khan direct hit. Lahore screams its approval for the Peshawar captain"
runs it down to deep third man
goes for the bouncer and Sammy gets under it
makes just enough room so that he can carve the short ball outside off to the point boundary. Superb placement to beat both point and deep third man
full delivery - slower delivery - wanders down leg as Dawson tries to pull it away
hits it straight to backward point
"that looks like a massive top-edge, but it sails over the boundary and brings up <b>Dawson's fifty</b>. He sees the short ball so early, sets up for the shot, ends up being early on it, and yet has the timing to carry over the ropes"
"the wide yorker, which is a decent plan with Dawson trying to make room outside leg. But he's in such good form that he can stick his bat out far enough and have the ball ping off it to the third man boundary"
"flat, hard, and over the long-on boundary again! All the work for this shot is done by his picking the slower ball, clearing the front leg, waiting until it is in his arc and then powering it away with a horizontal bat"
"full and outside off, he swings and misses. <b>That's 21 runs off the over</b>"
mis-hits a sharp bouncer coming up at his nose out to long-on
slashes a short and wide delivery to sweeper cover
"top-edge lands safely in square leg's hands! Rahat's extra pace and bounce traps the Peshawar captain. Quetta have done their homework. There were no full deliveries to Sammy, which he absolutely loves. Targeted his body, forced him to pull or hook, and eventually the mis-hit came"
"offcutter, with the angle going across the right-hander, beats Dawson all ends up"
"he has a fourth! Rahat is single-handedly winning this for Quetta. On a flat batting track, he has been simply irresistible with his pace and bounce. Even the in-form Dawson is unable to deal with the left-arm quick - although on this occasion it's a slower ball that does the trick. Bangs it into the deck, keeps it wide of the batsman. Dawson swings hard, gets a bottom edge through"
"yorker from around the wicket, Hasan Ali gets it down to third man"
"carves a length ball outside off stump over extra cover. Good power from Wahab, having cleared his front leg"
backs away for a slap over the off side but ends up with a thick outside edge to the third man boundary
"slower ball on the stumps. Wahab basically sweeps it to midwicket. Can he hit the stumps direct? Anwar takes aim, flings down the throw, Wahab is nowhere in sight, and Hasan Khan backing up at cover parries it away to the boundary as well. <b>Oh, he's hurt his nose</b>. The ball might have hit his face and gone off to the boundary. Hasan's bleeding and he's being helped off the field"
""
"low full toss, which Hasan flicks to deep square leg"
"goes for the scoop, but the ball, aimed at the blockhole outside off doesn't give him the opportunity to pull it off. The ball ends up trickling away to where short leg might have been"
nails the yorker outside off. Wahab swings all over it
"another one in the blockhole, which Wahab skewers to deep midwicket"
smashes a full delivery outside off to long-off.
"uproots the off stump as Wahab goes for a slog sweep, the bat swinging over the dipping ball on its way to its target."
works this off the base of middle stump to long-on
"taken at long-off. Hasan has to go for the big hit, especially with this being a length ball outside off, but he mistimes it and Kohler-Cadmore is around to complete the catch"
"<b>edged and taken!</b> Strikes first ball. Good length just outside off, but angling into the batsman. Tries to punch off the back foot and takes the outside edge. Comfortably held on by Sammy at first slip"
chopped on! But just misses leg stump. Good length on off stump and going across Nawaz. Tried to defend but takes the inside edge. Races away to the fine-leg boundary
"full on middle stump and Nawaz tries to flick towards the leg side. Can't connect and hits his front pad. <b>Big appeal for lbw</b> but turned down. Would've gone down the leg side, but impact was in front of middle and leg"
"full on middle and off, tapped to cover for a quick single. They scamper across"
"full just outside off. Defended with the bat's open face, and sent to point"

"back of a length on middle stump, cramps Nawaz slightly. Goes onto the back foot and defends it back to Sameen"
"width offered, and sliced over point! Good length on off stump, but the angle away from the left-hander allows Nawaz to free his arms. Slashes hard at it, and sent behind square. Lands full on the boundary"
"<b>he's got his second!</b> Good length outside off, and nips away after pitching. He's driving nonetheless, and induces a small outside edge. Pocketed by Akmal, and the keeper appeals. Hasan follows Akmal's appeal, and umpire Dar raises his finger"
"back of a length on middle stump, going down the leg side and Sarfraz tries to flick this fine. Can't connect though"
good length on the fourth-stump line. Sarfraz sees the ball nipping away and shoulders his arms on this occasion

"full on middle and leg, clipped off his boots to the left of midwicket. Played off the front foot"
"overpitched on leg stump, tries to flick off his boots fine down the leg side, but can't make contact. Appeal for caught behind as the ball goes past the batsman, but turned down. The noise was of the ball flicking the boots"
"good length on middle stump, stays on the back foot, and taps it back to Sameen"
"good length on middle stump, it's close to his body but cuts at it anyway. Straight to the man at third man, but oh dear! The ball goes through Hasan Ali's fingers and into the boundary. Free runs"
"back of a length on middle and leg, Nawaz can only punch this back to the bowler"
"<b>flicked past short fine leg!</b> Good length on leg stump, and turned fine off his pads. Sammy's at short fine-leg, but he's just not quick enough to run across to his left"
"good length on off stump, angling across Sarfraz. Punched off the back foot, but straight to cover point"
"back of a length on leg stump, whips it off his pads fine. Fine leg's running to his left, but the ball's too quick. The delivery wins the battle this time. Sarfraz did well to use Wahab's pace while playing that"

"full outside off, and Anwar takes a big swing at it. Takes the top edge, and falls past Sammy's left. He's hobbling across - at third man - but Dawson's not pleased at all"
"<b>ten off two!</b> Quetta aren't going down just yet. Full outside off, and Anwar shimmies down the wicket. Meets it on the full, and muscled over long on. This game ain't over just yet"
"full and wide outside off. Tries to drive this inside out over cover, but takes the inside edge. Goes to short fine leg, and refuses the single"
"<b>lifted!</b> Over long on. Flat ball outside off, and Anwar once again charges down the wicket to smack it to the leg side. Full follow through of the bat!"
"<b>over long off!</b> This is unbelievable. Good length just outside off, Anwar comes down the wicket again and bunts it over Dawson's head. Tears in the stands among Peshawar fans"
"<b>Peshawar win by one!</b> Full toss on middle stump, and it's been smacked over Dawson! <b>Dropped at long on</b> but he's quick to throw it back in. The batsmen try to take the second, but they can't make it. Dawson takes the bails off at the non-striker's and <b>Quetta Gladiators are eliminated.</b>"
