"very far down leg first ball, but he'll be encouraged by the movement though it's a wide"

"goes back to a stump to stump line, but gets it to move in and end up on the pads, and Lynn pats it towards mid-on for a single"
"good ball, back of a length and rising while going past Narine, right outside off. He keeps his hands down and lets it go through. That's the length to bowl to Narine, and not give him room"
"and a poor one to finish, back of a length again but on leg stump and not quite rising as high. Narine swivels to pull it off his hips to the square leg boundary"
"starts off with a bad ball, too short, sat up to be spanked and Lynn obliged, powering it through cover. All the time in the world to play that"
"fuller, but on the pads and Lynn works it between mid-on and midwicket"
"and it is! too short once again, turning into Narine right into his hitting arc and Narine rocks back to pull this over cow corner"
<b>mis-field by Yusuf at mid-off</b> given air outside off and Narine drives it well but straight to Yusuf. Poor fielding to let it slip through
"better line and length, draws Lynn into the forward defence outisde off"
"<b>just clears Vijay Shankar at long-on</b> fuller, and Lynn goes for the lofted drive aiming for maximum. Didn't time it all that well though, but hit it powerfully enough to just about clear a leaping Vijay"
"greeted with a six! that's a free gift for Narine, short and wide outside off, and he gleefully slashes it over point"
"and Narine's confidence is up now. This is a better ball, shorter  and rising up higher outside off, but Narine has the room to pull it from outside off to the midwicket boundary"
<b>carnage from Narine</b> low full toss outside off now and he carves it over cover for a sweetly timed four
"<b>knocked him over</b> But Narine has done his job. Slower ball has got him. Off-cutter that pitches on off, Narine was anticipating a quick and short one perhaps, had cleared his front leg to go over cow corner. Too early into the shot and connects with air. The ball connects with the middle stump"
"good length on off, patted with soft hands to mid-off and he calls Lynn through for the quick single"

"back of a length, close to off stump, Lynn wants to get on top of it and slap through the offside but doesn't time it quite well."
"<b>straight to point</b> soft dismissal and Gill won't be happy with that. Fuller on off, and he leaned into the drive while opening the face, but steered it to the fielder, who only had to take a couple of steps to pouch it."
"back of a length outside off, dabbed to third man"
"good length, angling across, pushed towards point and they take a quick single. Lynn had to scramble to make his ground after being a little late to respond to Rana's call"

"<b>lovely</b> too full and given a bit of room outside off and he leans into a textbook cover drive. Stroked it beautifully and Nadeem was chasing after it, but the ball just beats him to the fence"
opens the face of the bat to guide it to short third man off the front foot
"slower ball on a length, Rana comes forward and taps it softly to set off for a quick single. There is a shy at the stumps which allows them an extra run on the overthrow"
"flatter and full on leg stump, driven back to the bowler"

"similar line, homing into leg and Lynn goes deep in his crease this time to whip it to the bowler's right"

sticks to the 'fire it on leg stump' line again but Lynn punches more forcefully to get it past the bowler
"fuller and well outside off, Rana moves across and flicks it to long-on"
"<b>he's got him caught behind</b> Just got a feather on it, but this is a beauty from Bhuvi. Back of a length and in the channel. Of all the SRH bowlers, Bhuvi has got the ball to bounce extra, and that is what does Rana in. He's looking for another dab to third man, but the bounce means he just feathers it behind"
"<b>almost run out first ball</b>. good length outside off and Karthik cuts it to point. Hesitates then takes off for a single, Vijay Shankar misses a direct hit. Karthik put in a full length dive, but even that might not have saved him."
"good length in the channel, Lynn pushes it back towards mid-off. Early call of 'NO'"
"digs it in short, Lynn stays in his crease and fetches it from outside off to pull to deep square leg"
outside edge goes very fine to the third man boundary. Not entirely deliberate. Good length in the channel and Karthik opens the face of the bat but gets it a bit higher on the bat than intended. End result works for him though
"good length, outside off, he wants to slash it but it goes under his bat. Kept a bit low"
"down the track and patted back to the bowler. Quick thinking from Nadeem there, who gathered the ball and flicked it towards the stumps with DK having taken a start, but it misses and they get a single"
"<b>Karthik has thrown it away</b> he's had several close shaves with a run-out this innings and he's finally out now. There was never a second run there. The ball was given some air and Karthik had worked it to midwicket. Inexplicably, they go for the second with Vijay Shankar swooping down on the ball. The throw is flat, hard and at the stumps and Bairstow has no problems breaking the stumps. Another full-length dive from Karthik but he's still out comfortably. He didn't even wait for the third umpire's decision, but stomped off the ground, clearly unhappy - whether with himself or his partner, who knows."
