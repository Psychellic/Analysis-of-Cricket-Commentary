"length delivery around a middle stump line, defended by Usman"
"angled into him off a short length, pulled to midwicket"
defended back to the bowler. Tidy start from Sohail
"he's lucky that didn't clatter into the stumps, it trickles down to fine leg, and Rizwan's run about 60 metres to cut that off and keep it to two"
strays down legside and gets punished accordingly. Whipped off the pads to fine leg for the first boundary
driven to third man - some sloppy work there from Dahani allows them to come back for three
"good-looking shape away from the righthander, thick outside edge to put Saim on strike for the first time"
"tries to pull it over midwicket and fails to get close, in all honesty. Swing and a miss"
clears the front leg and looks to slog it over midwicket. Thick inside edge to fine leg gets him off the mark
"straight delivery, targeting the stumps. Driven down to mid-on"
flicked to square leg
"makes room to try and carve it over cover - not working for him so far, this plan. Good over from Imran"
"Bit of width, driven to backward point"
"sliced to short third, where Imran was a little slow getting down to cut it off"
"tried to open up the offside, but fails to execute with the cut. They're showing positive intent but it hasn't really happened for either of them this innings"
"blocked and tried to scamper across for a run, Dahani promptly knocks that idea out of his mind"
"that's a poor delivery, and <strong>Usman capitalises</strong>. You can't bowl that wide with short third up; all he needs to do is help it down to third man and he's picked up four"
"chipped off one leg to fine leg. He uses the pace of the bowler to help it above the rung fielder, and Quetta finish the over strongly"
"shaping away from him, driven to the offside"
"took pace off the ball. Saim was shaping up to swing it through the onside, but drives it to mid-off instead"
defended back to the bowler
"slashed the slower ball through cover, but the Imran Tahir in the deep keeps it down to one"
"<strong>the aerial route finally pays dividends for Ayub! </strong>Cleared the front leg and speared it over extra cover, going all the way for six! It's been a low percentage shot for him, but boy it looked handsome once it came off"
"another elegant drive through the offside showcases the 18-year old's class. Waited for the slower delivery before leaning into that cover drive to finish the over strongly. Not the worst start for Quetta, all of a sudden"
"<strong>greeted to the crease with a whip through midwicket for four</strong>. It was a touch too full with pace on, allowing the ball to come on to the bat and be timed beautifully through the onside"
run down to third man
good yorker to keep him honest. Just about digs it out
"he's feeling ball on bat nicely. This one looked to close to work behind the stumps on the offside, but he opens the face <strong>so </strong>late, and just about beats short third man"
guided into the offside to get off strike. He looks a lovely touch player
"slower ball, Usman works it to the onside from well outside off and keeps the strike"
"pulled in front of square. He dind't quite get all of that but with pace on, there was enough to beat the deep fielder on the onside. This is a positive start for Quetta now, these two are building a decent platform"
defended back to the bowler
a pull to the onside brings up Quetta's <strong>first opening 50-over partnership this season.</strong>
dances down the ground and carves it over the top through the offside for a single
"<strong>slashed through the gap in the covers</strong>. Picked up off a length; the delivery was slightly wide outside off, allowing him to make room and punish the bowler"
"pulled straight to Rossouw, and that concludes a pretty stellar Powerplay for Quetta. Now let's see if they can keep this rate up"
guided straight to short fine leg
""
"muscles it through the onside, and <strong>I think Shan Masood's let that go for four</strong>. Really casual from the fielder, with the fumble meaning he had to rush back and cut it off before it touched the tape. The replays suggest this will be four, but the umpire rules otherwise. Just an errant run"
cut to the fielder at backward point
"pulled to wide long-on, who keeps it down to one"
a single rounds out a decent over from the part-time spinner
"errant start, drifting down the legside"
"chipped back over the bowler's head, drops between the two deep fielders straight down the ground"
"flatter and quicker, Usman gets a juicy edge that first lip might have gobbled up. In the absence of that fielder, it absolutely scarpers away to the boundary. Imran, expressive as ever, is down on his knees"
driven through the offside
authoritative sweep to square leg for a single
"a single to long-on. They thought about two, but thought better"
"<strong>Imran gets Ayub's wicket</strong>. That might not be terrible for Quetta, who need batsmen who can get a move on. He did the right thing, trying to slap it over cow corner, only to find the fielder positioned specifically for that shot"
poked into the offside
squeezed into the onside for a single
"strays down legside, allowing du Plessis to steer it very fine, beating the square leg fielder and picking up a boundary"
tried that same shot but this one was too straight. Scooped back to the bowler
guided to third man
"brilliant timing. Much too full, and Usman brings up a <strong>33-ball half-century with a sumptuous cover drive</strong> He's taken his opportunity, now let's see if he can step it up"
nudged into the onside for a single
"that was a googly, but Usman saw it coming, and he's moving through the gears all right. Connected very cleanly and <strong>smashed over long-on for a colossal six - 88 metres.</strong>"
""
""
tucked into the onside for a run
dot ball to finish off the over
"inside edge to the keeper, no runs on offer there"
"takes the pace off, Usman wasn't near that. Set off somewhat mysteriously for a bye, but Rizwan kept him honest with alert work"
"full, couldn't get underneath it and rives it to long-on for a single"
"high full toss, driven to extra cover. Faf punches the bat in frustration"
"slower ball, poked into the offside for a single"
"heaved into the onside, and that goes all the way for four thanks to some really ordinary work by the man in the deep. Brathwaite's not amused, and why would he be? A decent over has been slightly spoiled"
"guided to long-on for what should have been one, but a fumble allows them to come back"
nudged to long-on for one
"driven straight to extra cover, and that's a dot ball"
clears the front leg and smashes it down the ground
"flicked into the onside, bringing up Quetta's 100. They're falling behind, slightly, and need to pick up the rate"
"nearly knocked his arm out trying to smash that. Misses completely, capping a fine over from Tahir"
"slower ball, du Plessis misses out with the drive once more"
"no timing on that drive down the ground, just a single"
"driven straight to short third, another precious dot ball"
"that was wide outside off stump, but timed crisply enough to clear mid-off. <strong>Quetta get a much-awaited boundary</strong>"
"low full toss, and Usman's not missing out on this. Brathwaite is annoyed with himself. Usman got into position nicely and <strong>flicked it over cow corner all the way for six</strong>"
"<strong>glorious shot to cap off the over</strong>. Waited for the slower ball before smashing it back over the West Indian's head, comfortably clearing long-off. 17 off the 13th over before we have a strategic time-out"
"sliced to backward point, straight to the fielder"
"beat him in the air. Tried to knock it into next week, but Imran gets enough turn to deceive him"
thick inside edge to short fine leg for a run
low full toss to long-on for a single
""
"reverse sweep, leading to a huge appeal from Tahir. <strong>The umpire gives it out - looked to me like there might have been bat on it. He does review after all</strong>. Turns out there is no bat, and it's three reds on Hawkeye. Usman goes for a fantastic 51-ball 80. This guy's done his job, and now it's down to the big hitters"
"well, what sort of shot was that? Walked across to the off-side to try and ramp it over short fine leg. Gets a thick inside edge that clips  the leg stump on its way, and it's two wickets in two for Multan"
driven through the offside to get off the mark
"slashed straight to backward point, no runs. This is exactly what Quetta did not want"
"a little too full, and the half-volley's put away. Finds the gap between extra cover and mid-off, and the timing takes it scuttling away to the offside boundary"
"banged in short, and Azam gets off strike with a pull to long-on"
driven back down the ground for one
"length ball, nudged away for a single"
"wide on the crease, hacked down to long-on from a length"
"<b>Sarfaraz goes!</b> Imran bounds in from wide on the crease, spears in a yorker as Sarfaraz backs away, and it crashes into the base of leg stump via the bottom edge! Hint of reverse, perhaps. Sarfaraz backed away very early, giving himself room to hit through the off side, but Imran backed his plan, nailed the yorker, and cleaned him up. Great bowling"
"banged in short as Cutting shuffles across his stumps, and he pulls behind square for four. Sat up nicely for him"
"length ball, strikes Cutting on the thigh pad as he looks to flick off his legs"
"slower ball, plinked into the covers to keep the strike"
"hung wide outside off stump, pressed out to long-off"
"<b>ufft, this is outrageous</b>. Full and wide outside the off stump, and Azam Khan gets low, Rashid Khan-style, to flick it through square leg from one knee. Beats the man in the ring and it races away. Deft touch"
"wide yorker, left alone, but the umpire decides it landed <i>just</i> inside the tramline. Good call, I think"
"wide yorker again, a fraction wider, and it's given as a wide this time"
"sprayed <i>very</i> wide outside off this time, another wide"
"tries that one-knee lap-sweep again to another full, wide one, but the connection isn't as good this time, and it dribbles into the leg side for a single"
"full and wide, dug out towards long-off. Brathwaite sticking to his plan"
"wide yorker, Azam tries to squeeze it out towards third man with an open-faced steer but can't lay bat on ball"
"banged in on a length, pulled hard through square leg. Brathwaite down to cut it off"
"slower ball, banged in, and pulled to square leg again"
"aaaaaaaand <b>BOOM!</b> Length ball, Azam frees his arms and clubs it disdainfully over Dhani's head for a straight, flat six. Slower ball, which he picked early, and flat-batted it 83 metres over the rope"
"yorker, hit in front, big appeal... given! <b>Azam reviews</b> Was this sliding down? Hint of reverse actually - angling down leg but nipped back. If there's no bat involved Azam is in trouble, and UltraEdge confirms no bat. Pitching in-line, impact in-line, hitting leg stump halfway up. Gone! Azam's fun comes to an end"
"fullish outside off, and slashed out towards cover. 145.1kph!"
"yorker, nailed on the boot, <b>huge</b> appeal but Mr Yaqoob isn't interested. <b>Rizwan calls for the review</b>. Very full, old-fashioned toe-crusher which smacks Cutting on the cap of the boot as he looked to jam his bat down. No bat, says Illingworth. Crashing into the base of leg stump, and Dhani has another!"
length ball which shapes away off the seam and beats Nawaz's outside edge
"length ball, slugged down to Vince at long-on on the bounce"
"wide on the crease, lands a wide yorker, which Qais can only dig out back to the bowler"
"nails a yorker, grunting in his delivery, which Qais jams into the leg side for a scampered single"
"in the slot, Nawaz throws the bat, and it flicks away for four down to fine leg. Thought it might have been off the pad, but in fact Nawaz inside-edged it through his legs"
"banged in, and Nawaz can only plink it into the leg side"
"<b>ooft, how to describe this shot?!</b> Fullish outside off, and Nawaz shuffled across looking to lap him behind square on the leg side. But he realised it wasn't there for him, so opened the face, and squeezed it away through wide third man while down on one knee. Genius!"
"the first was brain, this is brawn. Misses his length slightly, in the slot, and Nawaz powers the drive through wide mid-off for four. <b>Races to the fence!</b>"
"length ball, plinked down to long-on on the bounce. Nawaz wanted the second but Qais sent him back. Should have taken it on, I think - more important to have him on strike at this stage and wouldn't matter much if Qais was run out"
"yorker outside off stump, Qais throws the bat but can't beat the man at extra cover on the edge of the ring. Qais smacks his bat into his pad in frustration but he's got Nawaz back on strike, which is crucial"
"<b>Nawaz you little beauty!</b> Dhani misses his length again, slightly overpitching. Nawaz gets across to the off side, down on one knee, and slog-slaps him over backward square. One bounce and over the rope. How good!"
"rushes him with a back-of-a-length ball at 144.8kph, and Nawaz is late on the pull shot. It loops up, and Rizwan settles underneath it for a simple catch!"
"full, just outside off stump. That's 141.3 kph, you sense that dial's only going to go up"
"tailed back into Vince, who defends back to the bowler"
"little bit of shape away, slightly quicker at 142. Vince blocks"
"a touch of width, but Vince's sweetly timed drive finds the extra cover fielder"
"poor delivery this time, even if it was bowled at 145. Half-volley, slashed over backward point for Multan's first boundary"
Hasnain responds by clattering the Englishman on the helmet. Nice little follow-through as well. Intriguing first over from the young fast bowler
"that's nicely timed, using Steyn's pace against him by caressing the ball past backward point. The speed with which it raced away left no chance for third man"
"runs it down to third man, straight to him this time"
"wicket-to-wicket, just short of a length. Vince defends"
slightly wider and Vince charges down the track and slaps him through extra cover. Absolutely speeds away for four
"pace off, Vince angles it behind to third man"
the cover drive finds the fielder this time
"pulled to midwicket, no real timing on it"
"that's just pure timing, not sure the bowler can do much about that. Off stump line slightly full. Rizwan leans into a drive back down the ground that splits mid-off and mid-on, and he picks up four more"
"short ball, pulled away with authority. It's struck in front of square and the deep fielder didn't have a realistic chance of cutting it off"
"full, closer to yorker length this time. Driven tp mid-off"
"similar. Attempted yorker struck back to the bowler, who gets a finger on it, but Vince was well inside his crease at the non-striker's end"
"strikes him on the pads on the full. It was going well down, in truth, but Sarfaraz decides it's worth a punt. Hawkeye confirms what the naked eye led us to believe, and <strong>Quetta lose a review</strong>"
"slightly short, cut straight to a fielder"
"worked to long-on, clever running gets them back for two. That foot seems to be doing okay for now"

nudged into the onside for a single
"clever bowling, he didn't pick the googly, deflects off his pads to short third man, allowing Multan to run a leg bye"
concludes a great over with a dot ball
"a touch too wide of off stump. Hang on, Quetta have reviewed this, have they? They think this might be a caught behind...Well, there's nothing there, and Quetta have lost both their reviews"
slogged to cow corner for a single
guided to third man for a single
"flick of the wrists was all it took. Slightly slower delivery, he went back into his crease and worked it past fine leg for a boundary"
"reached for it, getting it to mid-off for one"
"tried to open the face and run it down, misses the edge"
"chipped into the onside, and he keeps the strike"
"charges down the ground, gets to the pitch and deposits it over long-off. Very sweetly struck, that aerial drive, and Zahid's been put under pressure straightaway"
"<strong>steps across and sweeps him over short fine leg. </strong>Not much wrong with the delivery, but Rizwan's anticipation, execution and confidence are on all-time highs right now"
"a tad short and carved through point for yet another four! Zahid's under the cosh now, and Multan have brought that asking rate down by plenty"

"driven back to the bowler to end somewhat respectably, but 53 without loss is a good Powerplay for the chasing side"
thick inside edge  fetches Multan a single
"Sarfaraz berates him for bowling a touch to flat and quick. It was 94.3, which is quicker than perhaps he should be. Allows Vince to charge and use the pace to smack him over midwicket for a boundary"
"gives it more air, which pleases his captain. Leading edge to long-off"
poked into the offside
"more flight, Rizwan chips it somewhat uppishly back to him. Good comeback, this, by the bowler"

"nice drift and turn, a misfield allows that quick single"
stepped away and tried to make room to tonk it over the onside. It grips in the surface and the sharp turn takes it out of his hitting arc
drives through the offside
"quick single, almost a daft single, that. <strong>Direct hit would have nailed Rizwan</strong>, I reckon. Qais collected well but failed to effect a direct hit"
"Qais gets his man! Beautiful legspinner, lands on middle and rips away. Vince tried to drive with the spin, only to get a feather through to the keeper"
gripped off the surface. Beats Rizwan with the turn
"banged into the surface, Rizwan tried to dab it to short third. He's beaten, and Sarfaraz appeals for a nick. They've burned their reviews, though, so they'll have to take the umpire's word for it"
sweeps and the top edge gets him off strike
"reverse sweep raps him on the pads. It's not lbw, but that doesn't stop Quetta appealing, of course"
flicked to midwicket. Keeping the pressure on Multan
gets off the mark with an onside clip
"nailed him! Qais is having a blinder! Traps him in front, there's a huge appeal and this time the umpire rules in Quetta's favour. Shan Masood tried to sweep it, and it struck him well outside the crease. But can that alone save him on review? Nope, it's crashing into middle of middle. The reviewing has been woeful tonight"
"googly, but that was wide leg stump. Sarfaraz appeals again? What for? Caught? Bowled, Timed out? Who knows? It's not out, though"

"sweep is miscued, clips him on the chest and he gets rizwan on strike"
"absolutely glorious. Beats Rizwan in the flight, and <strong>Sarfaraz whips off the bails! Is he gone? Sarfaraz seems sure</strong>. Looks like he's juuust got his foot back down on the ground. Just about survives"
"driven over the top, and sweeper cover misfields and allows that to go for four! That really needn't have been more than one, but as ever, the ball spins away from the fielder. <strong>It brings up yet another Rizwan fifty</strong>"

"and another wicket, things are falling apart now! Sohail Khan tried to smash it over long-on, as he needed to, honestly. A really sharp catch from Faf sends him back"
"<strong>Ben Cutting shells a skier, denying Zahid a hat-trick</strong>. Zahid, to his credit, just shrugs it off, but he'll be bitterly disappointed. Imran Tahir scooped it to long-off, and Cutting had all the time to get underneath it. But it pops out of the Aussie's hands"
"<strong>well, wasn't that nicely timed? Tahir carves him over point for six! Gloriously timed, and such nonchalance to a delivery bowled in excess of 148kph</strong>"

"not quite as well timed, but it's sliced over mid-off, giving Azam Khan a nice little chase. He manages to cut it off before it goes for four."

"another short one. Tahir can't seem to connect with them, but in fairness, they are seriously quick"
"four more! Well, Tahir's done his best. It takes a top edge and sails over Sarfaraz's head for four. The captain comes and pats Hasnain on the head. He's in a better mood now he feels victory's in his grasp"
"pace off, he went through his shot early. Beats the batsman"
"slower ball again, doesn't connect, and they run a bye"
lovely sower ball that dipped back in. Tahir could only poke it to third man and scampered back for a second that was never really on. Sarfaraz collects the throw from Zahid cleanly and knocks the stumps down with the South African well short.
