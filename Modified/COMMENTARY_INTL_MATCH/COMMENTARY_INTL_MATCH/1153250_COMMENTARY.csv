"<b>Loud shout</b> They've gone for the review. And it's a <b>no-ball</b>! That will not make Pakistan happy.

"<b>gorgeous.</b> Top quality from Babar. Steps out as Nabi is around the wicket and the line means he's not likely to be beaten wide outside off. Makes the pitch of it and then arches his hips to perfection to make sure that when he hits this, it swerves away from the long-on fielder. And that's what the ball does as it just clears the straight boundary. Too good."

Possible lapse of judgement? Doesn't matter really, with that work in the field, he deserved the run-out. Good innings from Imam, but he'll be cross for not taking it closer."

"<b>this looks out too!</b> A stumping appeal has been sent upstairs. Full and drifted in outside off.

His back leg had dragged out...<b>and Shahzad's quick hands means Babar is gone too.</b> Like a flash, the Afghan keeper. Stunning, stunning work. Rashid Khan has come steaming in and stolen another moment for himself."
<b>googly</b> first up and a nervous moment for Malik! Whew. Length ball skids on and keeps low. He manages to get the full face on this though

<b>bat-pad</b> and another lbw appeal is turned down against Haris. Rashid pushes this through quickly and he's just escaped on the forward block
"<b>another inside edge?</b> That's what will have saved Haris because this looks dead in front otherwise. Yes...there's an inside edge. He didn't pick this. Honestly, how can you? It's a legbreak delivered with a googly-like wrist position. He was looking to defend for the one that turns away"
"full slower ball at off stump, defended down the pitch off the front foot"
"length outside off, waits late and expertly stabs this between third man and point running backwards"
"<b>oh dear.</b> Mujeeb did so well to cover the ground and then...he covered too much of it. Slid straight past the ball after running to his left at third man. A smart shot by Malik, waited late and jabbed another one gently. This one through where the slips would have been. Should have got two, he gets too more. Mujeeb is immediately banished to fine leg"
<b>nicely</b> timed. Overpitched outside off and he gets the body weight into this drive to get it to sweeper's right

"length on off stump, blocked on the front foot. Giving him no room at all."
oh poor start. Drops it short and into the legs of Malik who knows exactly where the fielders are. Swivels and places this to the deep backward square boundary
<b>sweetly</b> driven past point but Rashid slides to his left at sweeper cover and keeps it to two. Overpitched outside off and he gets down on one knee to caress this
short of a length ball skids through low on off stump. Might have taken pace off this one. Malik dances around a bit before punching this to extra cover
<b>massive wide</b> outside off. That's slipped out and hasn't even landed on the pitch
"length on off stump, gets forward and drops it gently into the gully region"
"<b>beats him with the slower ball</b> but is not backed up by anyone after that. Length ball beats him on the front foot, Shahzad can't collect on the half-volley. He parries it to short fine who decides to have a shy at the non-striker's end...where no one is backing up. Two more easy runs."
"length on off stump, driven on the up to long-off"
"<b>taken at long-on.</b> Haris is done by the googly. It's a short ball that he expects to spin into him from off stump, so he's opened his stance and is looking to pull with that angle towards midwicket. But the googly squares him up and he ends up slicing an easy one out to Ishanullan"
"<b>nudges it past short third man</b> and they pick up three! Short of a length skidder, rising up above off stump and he watches closely to get this where he wanted. And Malik with supreme fitness to come back for the third"

"length on middle, pushed back down the pitch"

"<b>was that an edge?</b> Huge deflection after this went past the batsman, but it seems to be because of the upright seam. Short ball that he's looking to chop to third man"

"full toss on middle stump, driven firmly to long-on"
"short of a length at the hips, deflected down to fine leg off the thigh guard"
"attempts a slow bouncer, but he's dug it in too short. It rises above Malik's head and he lets it go gratefully"
"<b>can't get a direct hit!</b> That would've been close. Length ball on leg stump, he drops it to midwicket's right and Shenwari is the fielder there who isn't to it quickly. Malik was really pushing at the non-striker's end. Might have just made it."
"slower ball at a length outside off, sits in the pitch as Sarfraz looks to drive on the up. Can only manage a feeble chip to mid-off"
"<b>outside edge</b> to short third man. Once again he plays for the googly based on wrist, and is caught square on the front foot trying to flick into the leg side"
"short of a length outside off, punched to long-on off the back foot"
"<b>misses out</b> against a short ball. It's a googly coming into him, but he under-edges the pull"
<b>leaves it alone.</b> Oh this is a great contest. Appears Malik still in two minds. Googly at a length wide outside off and he lets it go
"<b>nicely run</b> by Sarfraz. Short of a length ball stays low outside off, he taps it into the open midwicker region and they beat the fielder running in from the boundary"
"googly, short of a length at off stump. Gets deep in the crease and punches to long-on"
<b>falls short of midwicket</b> and he makes it to the other end for a run. A full toss on leg stump and he's clipped it to that fielder there
"<b>run-out chance missed.</b> Gulbadin can't collect the ball as he runs back towards the non-striker's hand. The throw was slightly wide and he's looked to collect it in front of the stumps and whip backwards. But knocked the stumps out with his hands. It was a poor ball to start with, a slower short one. Sarfraz toe-ended the pull to midwicket"
overpitched ball down leg side. Can't get bat on it
"<b>hits the full toss straight to point!</b> Pakista have missed opportunities this over. It's been four bad balls if we're to be honest. This one with width outside off. He wants to caress it between point and short third, but can't bisect them"
this is well bowled. Loopy back-of-the-hand slower ball on off stump. Can only drop this into the off side with soft hands
"<b>loses the radar.</b> Two extra balls, two more to go. Attempts another legbreak, but this falls short and spins away from the wide marker"
"follows him down leg side with a full one, and he can only squirt this down to long-on off the toe-end"
"<b>but he won't succeed!</b> Out of sorts all innings long. Makes room and misses a full toss that's headed for middle stump. It was there for a slog, it was there for a chop, it was...well, he could've really done anything with that. But he chose to back away and nudge it behind square and when the ball dips from waist height, that's a risky shot - to offer so little of the bat to it. He's gone and once more, we sway."

"short of a length outside off, coming in at him. Backs away and cuts to sweeper cover"
"short of a length on middle stump, backs away and punches to deep midwicket"
"full quicker one at leg stump, looks to flick to long-on but midwicket hares across to his left and stops it"
"<b>well bowled.</b> Knew Asif would be looking for the big slog, so he slowed it down. It was a googly too. He was done by the pace on the slog sweep - inside edge onto boot"
<b>nearly plays onto his stumps!</b> Oh that is nerves from the batsman. Stays very deep in the crease as Mujeeb slides this in and defends into the turf...narrowly misses leg stump
"short of a length outside off, gets deep in the crease and whips to deep midwicket"
"<b>see you later!</b> Oh what a hit! Googly pushed through a little flat, on a length at off stump and he has got down on one knee and smoked this <b>96 metres!</b>"
"<b>taken at long-off!</b> The revenge of the spinner! Holds his index finger up and stares into the batsman's eyes as he walks off. Full fizzing legbreak wide outside off, Asif has his front leg well outside leg stump. He won't get leverage for this because his weight is all over the place. Slices it off the toe and a reverse-cup from Aftab Alam out at the boundary"
<b>inside edge</b> onto front pad. Gets back in crease and looks to whip this through midwicket. It's a quicker one
"short of a length on off stump, another skidder. Hurriedly drops it into the off side and they steal a single"
"full outside off, leans in and drags this off the toe-end to deep midwicket's right. The bad connection allowing them the second"

"offcutter at a length, in at off stump. Looks to swipe across the line and gets it down to long-on"
"<b>slices</b> to sweeper's right. Full ball outside off, gets on one knee and can't find the boundary"
<b>yorker</b> gives nothing to Malik as he looks to make room. It's at leg stump and he can only jam it pitch-side
"<b>clears the long-on boundary with a sensational slog!</b> That is pure, unadulterated, old-fashioned swinging through the line and it's big, it's awesome and it's six. Aftab drops the slower ball short and it sits up for a spanking outside off. Nawaz sends it flying. Just hat was needed."
"yorker just outside off, jammed pitch side into the off side"
length and into his body. Drags it with the turn to deep square leg
<b>inside half</b> as he steps out and cuts out the room for himself. Sort of yorks himself at a leg stump line and can only drag it out to deep midwicket
<b>smashes middle and leg!</b> Short of a length and he ends up swinging from over it. It's never easy to play horizontal bat shots against him. But it's what he needed to do. Couldn't get bat on it.
"<b>he has swing it over wide long-on!</b> This is excellent strategy. It has to be the guy at the other end who has to take on Rashid. Malik gives Hasan the license, Hasan uses it to club a googly with the slog sweep"
"<b>beaten.</b> Googly outside off, swings across the line again but this time it sneaks through from under his bat"
"<b>narrowly misses off stump.</b> Rashid is mad at himself. It's another googly, Hasan swipes across the line and misses. But he's done his job"
<b>overpitched ball outside off</b> and he misses out! Extra cover and mid-off in but he mistimes the drive. Sends Hasan back too
"<b>bowl me what you want</b>, says the old hero, I'm going to send you away. It's short of a length, it's a slower ball, it sits up and he whips it over deep square. Bad, bad ball."
"<b>that's it!</b> Malik swipes it to the fine leg boundary and wins it for Pakistan with his 43-ball fifty. Aftab is on his haunces, covering his face and possibly in tears. But this is all Malik, he's engineered this to perfection. Looked for the yorker, it was off slightly, a leg stump overpitched ball and it was an easy put away"
