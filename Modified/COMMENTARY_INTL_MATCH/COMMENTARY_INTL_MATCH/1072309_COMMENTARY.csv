"full and swinging, flicked to leg - <b>and this time he is gone, taken on the dive at square leg!</b> Root's conversion rate drops again, he hangs his head and thumps the turf! Mitchell Marsh threw himself forward to snaffle the chance, it was an excellent catch to leave Root tantalised in his search for a hundred in Australia... Starc gets the breakthrough and is mobbed by his team-mates. A late intervention to prevent England from fully claiming the day"
"angled across full and tempting, Bairstow lets it go"
"full, 86mph a foot or so outside off, again YJB ushers it through"
"searing yorker, thudding into the pads, Australia go up for the lbw... and Smith then asks for the <b>review</b>, though looks like it was heading down leg to me. In fact, Bairstow got a scrape of inside edge on it, too - so Australia will lose that review"

"<b>what a catch!</b> That's a stunner from Smith at second slip, he's dropped a few but that's a beauty.

"stays in the crease, pads this one away as it spins in at him from a straighter line"
"what's happened here? Curran has played back and defended a shorter delivery. Just has to watch it doesn't spin back towards the stumps. Paine walks from behind the stumps, picks up the ball and knocks off a bail and questions whether Curran had walked out of his ground. A moment of confusion, but Curran was very safe"
"short of a length on leg stump, neatly pulled off the deep to deep square"
he hasn't got much idea about this one! Takes his eyes off a short ball and flaps it down to long leg as as he also tries to duck

"woof, that's a beauty, too, rising sharply outside off as SMarsh feels for it and is beaten"

"lovely bowling, drifting away and zipping through past the bat, into the gloves - <b>and the finger goes up!</b> Vince decides to <b>review</b> straight away, however. Was it bat hitting the ground? There's nothing on Hot Spot and Snicko also draws a blank, other than a small spike once the ball was well past the bat... so the decision is overturned and Vince's 'big innings' retains its potential"

"another bumper, chest height but prodded safely down towards gully"
"goes round the wicket, banged in and flicked off the body wide of leg slip for a single"
"bouncer, 89mph aiming for the heart, Anderson leaps and takes the bottom hand off but manages to fend it down short of gully"
hops across to a length ball and punches it square
dug in short but sliding down the leg side as Anderson shimmies across
"full, tailing in on the pads, clipped neatly in front of square and there's not many fielders out there to prevent them getting a couple, to ironic cheers"
"more short stuff, 87mph/139kph and prodded towards the man at leg gully on the bounce"
"pitched up outside off, Curran rocks out the high front elbow and clouts him through mid-off for four! Suspect he won't be getting too many more of those"
"and he steps away early, ready to swing the arms at the short ball and he flays a pull to the midwicket fence...! Gets some chirp from Cummins, for his trouble"
"another bumper, this one over the stumps and Curran almost has to curl up like a hedgehog to avoid it as the ball stays low"
"banged in, pretty much leaving a heat trail as Curran swishes and misses"
"oof, he wears this one! Hammered in short, 88mph and smacking into the shoulder as he takes his eye off and ducks. But he's still there"
"Cummins tears in, <del>serves up a tempting half-volley</del> tries to knock Curran's head off again, 89mph/144kph and fended just out of the reach of short leg"
"round the wicket, short of a length and whistling through as Anderson hangs back and is beaten, nods his head in acknowledgement"
"another bumper, this is slightly leg side and he manages to get out of the way"
"back of a length, 87mph outside off, Anderson blocks the ball towards point"
banged in and defended from back in the crease
"over the wicket, short and sliding across as Anderson jumps and prods and misses"
"finishes with (you've guessed it) a bouncer, seems to come slowly off the pitch and he pats it down in front of the waiting short leg"
tossed up from over the wicket and defended in front of the stumps
Curran gets on to the font foot and blocks
"oh, hello... dances down and skelps a drive past cover, he's batting nicely again and picks up four"
"flighted, spinning in, goes back to defend"
"pushed through outside off, beats the bat and nutmegs Paine - <b>and then it hits the helmet, giving England five penalty runs!</b>"
floated up and blocked getting on to the front foot outside off
"been given caught behind! Short of a length, angled across, feathered through to Paine. Anderson wants to review, but England have none left. Not sure he actually nicked that. And Joe Root won't come out, so that's the end of the match"
