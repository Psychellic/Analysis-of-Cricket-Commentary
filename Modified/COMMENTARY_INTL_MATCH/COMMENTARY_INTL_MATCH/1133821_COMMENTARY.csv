"short and wide, tripe to start. Rohit is a tad tentative. Cut to cover point."

""
excellently bowled. Liton backs away but it's a well-executed yorker. Liton can only jam it out.
"runs down, doesn't quite get to the pitch, but is close enough to the length to lift the ball over mid-off. Nicely played."
"sees him coming again and bowls it wider and much shorter! Lovely piece of spin bowling. Liton somehow chooses the worst possible shot, opting to work the ball from well outside off.

"drifts on the pads, nudged down to short fine leg."
"back of a length outside off, punched away to mid-on from the back foot"

"full on middle stump, backs away and crunches this drive past cover. No chance for Manish Pandey in the deep! What a terrific shot from the Bangladesh keeper"
"slower ball wide outside off, but well inside the tramlines. Mushfiqur thought it was wide, so let it go. Poor judgment on his behalf"
good length wide outside off again. Tries to cut but Mushfiqur can't connect. Through to the keeper on the bounce and <b>India win by 17 runs!</b>
