"Shehzad is run-out! A nice, slower delivery around off, Maqsood hits the ball back up the pitch, Shehzad comes haring down but Maqsood is not interested. He stays in his crease, but Shehzad keeps coming. In the end, if I saw correctly, Shehzad pushed Maqsood's bat out of the crease (surely, involuntarily) as he slipped at that end. But Maqsood is quite strong. Shehzad circles around him and walks off as Asif runs to the stumps to run Shehzad out. That was absurd."
