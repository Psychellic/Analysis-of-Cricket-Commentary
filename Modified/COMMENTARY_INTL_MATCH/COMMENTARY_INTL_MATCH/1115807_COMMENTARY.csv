"a full delivery outside off, angled across. Zaman wafts, thick outside edge to third man"
"139 kph, falls over on a flick does Amin. Full down leg, Amin misses a flick, struck on the pad and he loses his balance"
"136 kph, short delivery around middle and leg, Amin seems hurried for pace, popped up into the off side"
"beauty. Hits the deck, short outside off, keeps climbing and beats Amin on the outside edge. Terrific delivery"
"141 kph, he's nowhere near that. Angled across, full and wide outside off, Amin throws his hands at it and the ball flies over the edge."
"141 kph, good length delivery around off, defended into the off side, towards cover. Struggled right through that over did Amin"
"just over Phillips. A shortish delivery on middle and leg, Zaman pulls <b>but gets a leading edge</b> which plonks over the keeper. Both Taylor and Phillips run back, neither can get very close. There is extra bounce in this surface, how quickly can Pakistan adapt?"
"full delivery on middle and leg, Zaman swats a wild slog to short midwicket"
"dug in, very short and very high, over the head"
"134 kph, that's the way Zaman plays, I Guess. A full delivery on off, Zaman clears his front leg, looking to swat another wild drive over mid-off, but the ball skews off the outside half to cover. Just popped up. Undone by extra bounce, that's the first batsman to fail to adapt to extra bounce despite a chance"
"'it swung,' says Ross Taylor. <b>But it's a chance dropped</b>. Good length on off, moves away, a thick outside edge goes straight but low to Taylor at wide slip. His hands were in a bad position, and the ball hits his wrists. An easy catch for Taylor, should have been taken"
"good length around off, hit on the thigh pad, undone by extra bounce"
"full delivery on middle and leg, swatted away with bad timing to mid-on."
"141 kph, nice length, full delivery on middle and off, driven to mid-off"
"lovely catch from Kitchen again. Well done, much harder than the Taylor catch, but he keeps his eyes on the ball, tracks it through almost every point of its trajectory. Full delivery on off, angling away, a thick leading edge is found because of that extra bounce again. Lobs up over point, but Kitchen runs back, keeps his eyes on the ball, and with his back to the pitch, he takes a watchful catch. Well done. The second Pakistan batsman to fail to adapt to extra bounce."
"nicely played. On middle and leg, worked away off his hips towards deep backward square leg. Bruce gets across to his left, but his knee jars into the surface and the ball goes through. Ouch, a large hole in that part of the outfield."
"142 kph, good length delivery outside off, beaten on the outside edge, another waft from Nawaz"
"and again, 138 kph, just undone by swing and bounce, full and wide, angled away, beaten"
"142 kph, gets it through this time, full delivery outside off, drilled through mid-off for a couple. Southee chases"
"nicely played, 134 kph, full and wide outside off, sliced off the outside half to third man"
"good single. Full delivery outside off, tapped towards gully. Haris calls his partner through. Quality run"
"a tad short and wide outside off, 132 kph, goes over the attempted dab to third man"
"flat-batted through mid-off. Won't get to the boundary because the outfield is slow and the timing wasn't great. Shortish and wide, swatted away to the fielder's left"
"135 kph, too many shots from Pakistan. To be fair, it was in the slot. Full and straight, a hint of inward movement. Nawaz clears his front leg and swings, but that movement takes it to the inside half of the bat, as opposed to the middle. Just chipped to mid-on"
"full and straight, 137 kph, pushed back. An untidy start from Pakistan"
"flies through gully. A discernible change-down in pace, 121 kph, full delivery outside off, a thick outside edge to third man"
"outswing, full and wide outside off, 123 kph, driven to mid-off"
"good single. 123 kph, around off, worked to wide mid-on for one"
"122 kph, full outside off, moves back in, driven to mid-on with the angle of swing"

"123 kph, good length outside off, hit away to cover from the crease"
"a high full toss on middle and leg, worked to deep midwicket. Should have been put away for six. Won't get a better ball all innings"
"pushed through, quick outside off, nudged to midwicket"
"another full toss, 92 kph, quick, clipped to midwicket again"
"87 kph, straight to short cover. Pakistan 22 for 4. Lots of flight, drops late, but ends up being overpitched, and that's the invitation Haris wanted, gets forward and drives the ball straight to the fielder. Wanted to go over the infield, but got too close to the ball eventually."
"another full toss, lower this time, on middle and leg, pushed to mid-on"
"worked away into the gap at midwicket. A disastrous Powerplay for Pakistan, 22 for 4!"
"just wide of Taylor at slip. Short and wide outside off, Azam cuts, extra bounce, takes the outside edge and flies past Rosco at slip. No chance for him at all"
"the googly, Sarfraz does not pick it. The googly on middle and leg, pitched outside off. Sarfraz somehow gets some bat on it, maybe the bat handle?"
"another thick outside edge down to the third man boundary, shortish and wide, gets some bounce and the ball races away to the third man fence. Bounce"
"shortish and wide outside off, cut to point"
"back of the hand, another googly, not picked again, looking for the cut again, but the ball moves the other direction. Gets some glove on it after reading it off the pitch"
"another googly, bowled very wide outside off, drifts back in and inside the tramline"
"pushed through, full delivery outside off, patted to point."
"nicely bowled, much slower through the air, and wider outside off, dabbed in front of point for a run"
"good run. 95 kph, flat around off, pushed to cover. Both batsmen respond positively and that's a good run"
"very quick on middle and leg, worked to square leg"
"79 kph, lots of flight outside off, driven towards short cover, who dives to his right to save one"
"quick on middle and leg, driven to long-on"
"83 kph, flight outside off, tapped towards point for a run."
"the googly around off, worked to midwicket for one. Maybe New Zealand need to tighten up because this is exactly what Pakistan want right now"
"shortish and wide outside off, extra bounce, bounces over the cut"
"the googly, premeditated the sweep, and the ball goes down the leg side so he can get just a bit of bat on his sweep, to short fine leg"
"quick on middle and leg, nudged to midwicket"
"lots of bounce on the legbreak again, full and wide outside off, beats Azam on the drive. Even the keeper can't collect cleanly"
"slips over, over-balances and Sarfraz is stumped! Slow through the air outside off, Sarfraz looks to sweep but there is some extra bounce. As he plays the sweep, his front foot slides and his back foot slides in the opposite direction, leaving him showing off his agility with the splits. The keeper takes off the bails quickly, much to Pakistan's misery."
"edged and taken! A golden duck for Shadab. Lots of flight from Santner, draws Shadab forward with a loopy delivery, Shadab comes forward, drives and gets a thick outside edge. Phillips juggles and juggles and juggles again but the ball is high enough, he doesn't panic much and takes the catch!"
"slow on middle and leg, high back-lift but defended eventually."
"quick on middle and leg, 92 kph, worked to one of those midwickets"
"slow through the air but on the pads, at 80 kph, nudged to square leg."
"full and straight, 82 kph, defended. Pakistan 39 for 6 after 10 overs."

"120 kph, full delivery on off, Faheem unwinds and swings, a thick inside edge into the pad"
"120 kph, <strong>out with a direct hit</strong>, on middle and leg, worked towards midwicket. Babar runs down, is sent back and is almost caught short by de Grandhomme, as he picks up and fires at the bowler's end."

"excellent line, full around off, defended back"
"some extra bounce, shortish delivery outside off, just bunted to cover"
"full on middle and leg, 134 kph, nudged away to midwicket. Bad timing allows them the run"
"132 kph, hurried for pace and Pakistan slump further. Shortish delivery outside off, Faheem is too late through the pull, harried into his shot, and all he can do is spoon a catch to short cover. Spliced away."
"full outside off, 135 kph, beaten on the outside edge"
"some flight outside off, 84 kph, driven to long-off"
"the googly on middle, out comes Hasan's slog sweep, to deep square leg"

"on the bounce to long-off. Full and wide outside off, smashed away to long-off. Couldn't quite get underneath the pitch"
"fantastic stuff from Santner, flat on middle and leg, worked to midwicket. Santner runs after it, picks up and throws to the bowler's end, where Southee takes off the bails, but Hasan has just made it. Reckon Azam was in worse trouble, but that's good quite from Santner"
"inside-edged, just misses the stumps. Full delivery outside off, gets a thick edge which bounces well in front of the keeper"
strays down leg this time for a wide
"full and straight, Hasan shuffles across, gets underneath the length and heaves the ball nicely over deep midwicket. Lovely shot. May have to go short or very full"
six more! Hasan swings into the New Zealand dug-out. In the slot again and Hasan shovels one over long-on
"full delivery outside off, 138 kph, slightly wider this time than the previous two and Hasan swings again, but the ball takes a leading edge and gets so much elevation. Southee runs a few metres from his cover position, gets underneath the catch and takes it. A bright cameo"

"shortish, on middle and off, hit back to the bowler"
"full delivery on off, 138 kph, forced to the sweeper cover. Just nothing happening for Pakistan, other than Hasan's cameo"
"Rance and Southee combine again. Digs this one in, around off, Amir backs away, the ball gets too big on him and all he can do is mis-time a forehand pull over the bowler's head. Southee gets across from mid-off"
"good length outside off, carved behind point. There are two runs available by the time Munro gets around to his right"
"a low full toss on the pads, worked to midwicket to retain strike. Should have put that away for six too"
"slashed for four. Full and wide from Munro, carved away to deep point, no one there. Well played"
"99 kph, chaos. Full on middle and leg, driven to long-on. Just one available. The throw is bad, way over the keeper's head, the keeper runs back and flops his throw to allow another run. Munro is displeased"
"a full delivery on middle and leg, heaved away over long-on for a valuable six. Wild cheers again as Pakistan get 100"

"extra bounce again, shortish outside off, a big whoosh as bat makes contact with nothing but air"
"fullish delivery outside off, 143 kph, defended"
"<strong>just over mid-on</strong>. Back of a length on middle and leg, Guptill is hurried through his pull, the ball lobs off the splice of the bat and just evades mid-on. There is definite extra bounce in this"
"that's caught! Back of a length delivery, angled across. Guptill chooses to pull but the ball moves away and bounces extra, which means the choice to pull isn't the greatest, lobs up off the splice towards mid-on. Taken tentatively, but taken!"
"137 kph, on middle and leg, worked to deep square leg"
"136 kph, back of a length outside off, pushed into the off side"

"143 kph, around off, worked away to midwicket for one"
"shortish delivery outside off, some extra bounce, the ball goes past the cut. Phillips struggling"
"chopped on and Raees strikes again. Shortish delivery again, some extra bounce too but Phillips plays over the line, gets a thick inside edge which hits off stump. That was a stuttering, stumbling innings with no fluency"
"short on middle and leg, played into the leg side"
"a shortish delivery around off, inside-edged towards square leg for a run"
"full delivery around off, shovelled towards wide mid-on for a run."
"full and wide outside off, Bruce fives himself some room and chips a drive over mid-off for four. Just enough timing"
"on the hips and Munro, by allowing the ball to come to him, is able to time it through midwicket. This isn't a pitch where the batsman can go searching for the ball; go at it and hit through the line. Leave those shots in the bin"
<b>doesn't bounce enough</b> as Bruce looks to cut with the angle created by the left-armer. Beaten
"this one soars through to the wicketkeeper, slamming into his gloves so hard Sarfraz can't collect it. This is 146 kph, short and at the batsman's body. Bruce is an age slow on the pull"
"146kph, blocks a shortish delivery to point and pinches a run"
"looks for the blockhole at 146 kph, and it tails in as well. Vicious delivery, but Munro is once again up to it. Plays late, plays straight"
"hoicks it out towards the vacant areas at midwicket. The back of a length delivery sits in this pitch and just does not behave the way the batsman wants it to. Here, it bounces a bit more and goes off nearly the splice of the bat"
"executes it well in the end as he camps deep in his crease, without really moving his feet, then crouches in response to a short ball meant to cramp him for room and jabs it through midwicket"
"116kph, slower ball, which Bruce blocks in front of the base of off stump"
"good bouncer, pitching on leg stump and going right above off. That demands the right-hander to pull across the angle, which gives the best chance for a top edge. Gets a little too high though"
"sweet timing! These are the kind of balls you dream of after being beaten left right and centre. A full toss on middle and leg and Bruce whips it away to the right of deep square leg. Course that might not have beaten the fielder had he not moved forward, as if the ball was coming right at him, and rushed to his right to cover the angle"
""
punches a shortish delivery to mid-on
"uses a straight bat and punches to mid-off. Munro wants the single, he's quite right in his call, but Bruce isn't all that convinced. He hesitates. He's not sure. Eventulaly, he commits to his partner's call. Zaman is the fielder, flings the throw, and it absolutely nails Munro's left wrist (or thereabouts) as he stretches out to make his ground. He's in agony, throwing his head back and wringing his hand desperately to ward off the pain"
"slower ball on off stump, picks it and defends it"
"starts with a leg side delivery, on the pads, swept towards deep backward square leg, the fielder dives to his left to save two"
"quick around off, defended"
"the googly outside off, picks it from the hand and slices a drive to deep point"
"nicely played, gets low for a fine paddle sweep towards fine leg. 'Only one,' yells Sarfraz. He gets his wish"
"short on middle and off, 90 kph, too short. Munro stands back and punches to cover"
"big appeal, Munro switched his stance and misses a switch hit. Flat delivery on middle and leg, <strong>Munro misses. Sarfraz reviews</strong>. it may have pitched in line just to negate the debate of whether it pitched outside leg (for the leftie) or outside off (for the rightie). He is struck in front of middle and off. But the ball is bouncing over middle stump, the googly it was and what happens with that ball is the ball bounces extra. The review is lost."
"good length delivery, seaming back in, 137 kph, pushed back"
"137 kph, good length down leg, Bruce is hurried through a pull, and is struck in the groin area. Bruce pushes the ball back to the bowler, careful not to pick it up."

"digs this one in, short outside off, goes over the bat, 133 kph"

"a top-edged sweep into the helmet. Googly down leg, extra bounce again, thick leading edge into the grille"

"goes flatter this time, on off, Bruce prefers the sweep, stays low and rolls the wrists over the ball to hit the ball through square leg for four. Fine shot"
"quicker and flatter on off, defended"
"139 kph, full on middle and leg, Munro stays low and swivels into a flick, behind square leg for four. Just those wrists and meeting it earlier to get it finer"
