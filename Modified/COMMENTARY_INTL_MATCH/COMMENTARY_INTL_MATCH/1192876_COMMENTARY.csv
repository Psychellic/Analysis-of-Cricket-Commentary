"shortens his length and goes closer to off, Mendis defends off the backfoot"
"<strong>extra bounce, slash and a miss!</strong> It was banged hard into the surface and kept climbing as Mendis threw his hands at it, beaten both by pace and bounce"
"similar hard length, nips back sharply off the seam and crashes into the thigh pad before ballooning to the off side"
"what deception, Mendis was through the slog across the line days earlier as Southee held this one back, changing the pace cleverly and sort of floating it up"
"high full toss on middle and leg, tucked away to deep square leg for one. He was surprised by that, probably why he couldn't take full toll"
"full and swinging away a touch, Mendis goes for the booming cover drive without moving his feet, can't time it"

"full toss, was shaping back in, Perera, who fell to a Southee full toss last match, tucks it away with the swing to deep square leg to retain strike"
"full and angled across, Perera jams his bat down on it, opens the face at the last  moment and bisects the short third man and point for three"
"<strong>looks for the scoop but cannot connect!</strong> It was a regulation length ball on middle, may have been better off picking it up towards square leg, his favoured area"
"full on middle, pushed to mid-on, they consider a single but decide against it"

"attempted yorker outside off, squeezed out towards cover"
"<strong>slower ball and Seth Rance finally has some success!</strong> Beautifully disguised slower ball, it was floated up, but not quite in the slot, Mendis was through his bat swing way too soon and offered a simple enough chance to mid-off"

"fired in on middle and leg again, Dickwella reverse sweeps again, beats short third-man and they come back for the second.

"Santner slows it down, Dickwella comes out of his crease whips it to leg for one"

"Avishka does well to chip the ball in the air and in the gap wide of long-off, and Bruce does well too to run and dive to his left to keep it to two"
"swiped to the leg side for six! Slightly fuller, a bit quicker and Avishka slog-sweeps that high and long to get six over the fielder at deep midwicket. He gets an applause from Dickwella"

"slower delivery well outside off, Dickwella swings and misses"
"<strong>chance at the non-striker's end</strong>, he misses and Dickwella survives. Dickwella tapped the ball to cover and ran hard, it was a dangerous single though, had Astle struck the stumps at the bowler's end"
"slow bouncer, Avishka spots it early and pulls that away over mid-on with a fair bit of power for four"
"that's an <b>excellent running catch from Santner</b>, Southee breaks the stand. Looked like a <b>knuckle ball</b> well outside off, Avishka swung hard after making room and ended up with a leading edge that went high on the off side and Santner sprinted in from the covers to put in a forward full-length dive and get both his hands under it"
"some room on the off side, Dickwella gets that behind point with a cut and they do well to come back for the second despite a good throw"
"slow cutter outside off to end the over, he swings and misses"
"struck <b>right in front of the stumps</b> and he's plumb, the umpire gives him out and Shanaka asks for a <b>review</b> with only a few seconds left. The full delivery pitched on off and struck him bang in front with the off stump visible, he missed the flick while falling over, there was no edge and that was ramming into the base of middle stump. The review was wasted there"
"accurate again, Jayasuriya stays deep in the crease and blocks it back"

"slow offcutter at 121kmh outside the leg stump, Dickwella goes a fair bit across and scoops it while going down on a knee to fine leg"

"the expected slower ball on short of length, it's going across and Jayasuriya chases and misses"
he wants to scoop the ball over short third man but gets an inside edge towards deep backward square leg for two in the gap
""
charges down and finds mid-off with a big swing
excellent yorker and Dickwella does well to tuck it away square on the leg side for two more
"the finger goes up <strong>in slow motion</strong> and it's the big wicket of Dickwella. It was a good and accurate slower delivery from Rance, pitching right on the middle stump and going straight. Dickwella goes well across to flick it on the leg side and misses it completely, probably beaten by pace and that's an easy decision"
"nearly in the block hole, he digs it out and down towards mid-on, Rance goes for the chase as mid-on is deep and the batsmen do well for the second run"
"short and flat around leg, he sweeps it over square leg for one"
"shortish again, now on the off side, and Hasaranga makes room to cut it past point for two in the gap"
really poor delivery - short and wide outside off and turning away further. Hasaranga doesn't use as much power but does enough to swipe at it and beat the fielder in the deep
"better delivery, but the leg break gives the batsman room again and he steers it well away from point for two more"
"better from Sodhi, pitched up outside off and Hasaranga pushes it down to long-off"
"another poor delivery, this one's down the leg side and he swats it to deep fine leg"
angling across around off and the left-hander opens his stance early to scoop by facing the bowler and does well to scoop it fine on the off side through the aerial route
"<strong>hammers the pull</strong> this time, six runs! Short offcutter on leg, Jayasuriya stays back and clobbers that over the deep midwicket fielder"
"in the block hole outside off, he runs it down to third man"
"slightly high full toss on off side, looked like it went above the waist but not given as a no ball. Yup, the replay confirms that and the crowd is booing the umpire"
"gets the top of off stump! Hasaranga made some room to try and run the ball fine on off and beat short third man, but the ball comes in from length and beats the bat to knock top of off stump. Good stuff from Kuggeleijn to stick to the basics after that expensive start"
length delivery outside off is pushed towards sweeper cover for a single and there's <b>an overthrow</b> at the keeper's end for a second
"slow delivery, a cutter, angling across and he chases and misses"
"slow again, slightly short, and Jayasuriya pulls that in the gap on leg before Santner runs hard to his right and rolls to keep it to two"
"quick delivery, top edge, and taken at point. Jayasuriya probably expected a slower delivery but this one came at 130kmh, it was short too, and Jayasuriya pulled it for a top edge"
"slow delivery outside off, it cuts away and he swings and misses"
"wide full toss, steered to deep point for a single"
"only 108kmh, it's short of length around leg, and the batsman makes room to only find cover with a punch"
"it's a low full toss outside off, Udana swings and sends the ball rolling towards third man where Munro does well to slide to his left and keep it in but loses the ball for a second. No big damage done there"
"slow and slightly full around off, he slams it down the ground and Rance nearly gets a hand to it before the batsmen come back for the second"
<strong>lands just wide of backward point </strong>. Udana swung for the slower ball and the top-edge landed wide of the running fielder before an inaccurate throw handed Sri Lanka a second
"some room on the off side, scrambled seam, Udana frees his arms and Southee misfields at cover to concede four. He'll be unhappy with that"
"toe-edges that straight down to long off. Low full toss around off, Udana swung but couldn't quite middle it and Mitchell got a straightforward catch in the deep"
"run out on the last ball before Akila didn't react quickly after missing the ball and Sri Lanka end on 161. Rance angled the ball across Akila, he swung and missed it and Malinga was aware to steal a bye on the last ball but Akila was ball-watching and a throw from the keeper to Rance effected the run out"
"full and swinging back, not quite a yorker but a pretty ominous start. Munro jams his bat down on it. Just"
"full and swinging back in again, Munro nearly overbalances as he tries to squeeze it away, gets a thick inside edge to fine leg"
"attempted yorker, gone wrong as it slides down the leg, Seifert glances it fine and the fielder lets it through his legs to concede four"
"length on the pads, tucked away towards square leg for one"
"full again and angled in, but started outside off, allowing Munro room, he just opens the face and gets it through point for four"

"off break, around off, pushed down to long-on for one"
"tossed up around off, pushed into the covers"
"shortens his length a little but it's still full enough and moreover wider outside off, Munro goes inside out, clears the infield and gets another four"

"short and wide and he pounces on the chance to cut, makes a little room and hammers it past point. Fierce square cut"
"full around off, he dances down the wicket, gets closer to the ball and picks it up with the spin, clearing deep midwicket with ease"
"<strong>Akila has his revenge immediately!</strong> It was a leg break, short in length so he went right back but it kept quite low and hurried on to him, kept gathering pace before finding him plumb in front"
another attempted leg break but down the leg side
"another leg break, again pretty flat and skidding on, tucked away through square leg"
"googly, he plants his front foot  right across his stumps and has to play around it as a result, can't get any bat on it and the umpire raises the dreaded finger. That's two in the over for Akila, who is quickly running through the visitors"

"there's a collision at wide long-on boundary, one fielder has taken the catch, he has crossed over the boundary, it might be a six, and both fielders are down after the collision! The crowd has gone silent. So Mendis ran to his right from deep midwicket, and Jayasuriya to his left from long-on to take a great catch, then came the collision and he tumbled over but his foot touched the boundary rope with the ball still in his hand. Since he still had the ball in his hand, it should actually be a six but the umpire has signalled four. And a few minutes later it's been changed to six"
