"full and wide, <B>spanked through point!</B> You don't want to be bowling there..."
"punched on the up, and <strong>whistles through the covers again!</strong> That was a much better ball, better length, tighter line, but still just too much room for Vince to free his arms"
drilled down the ground to mid-off
"swinging into the toes, a fumble at midwicket... which doesn't augur well for Pakistan's fielding effort, but no single on offer"
"a bit of shape into the pads, very full length, that's a safer line against the expansive Vince"
"back of a length, tight line, tucked to the off side"
"on the hip, back of a length, Bairstow resumes with his leg-dominant play to ease off the mark with a nudge square"
pushed off the toes to the leg side
"<B>crushed through the covers again!</B> He is so dominant through the off side, but that one should have been cut off at short cover. No dive from Imad .... no stopping it"
solid block to the off side
"full length, angled across the right-hander, dabbed to point"
flicked off the pads behind square
bat and pad together. Solid in defence
"very full, right up to the blockhole and thumped energetically back down the track"
"<B>the best of the lot!</B> Width, wassocked through the covers ... barely moves his feet, just sinuously leans into the stroke like a mating snake"
"too short, <B>belted in front of square with a violent pull!</B>"
flicked to the leg side
"tightens up in defence, tapped to the leg side"
"<strong>a slash through the cordon!</strong> A flat-footed drive, Bairstow has been starved of the strike but gets his innings going in streaky style nonetheless"
"big appeal! Did that pitch in line, Pakistan ponder  but decide against the review"
pinged on the pads again but that pitched outside leg
"crunched to short cover, that was utterly battered once again. If Pakistan keep feeding that cover drive, they are in for a l-o-o-o-o-ng day"
"tighter line, defended on the back foot"
"wheeling away on a full length, solidly blocked back down the pitch"
"<B>short-arm jab through backward square!</B> Not desperately short, but picked so early and dumped behind square"
punched into the covers
"good delivery, full and swinging out late, looking to flick through midwicket and ends up fat-edging to third man"
a report of willow echoes round the ground as Vince connects sweetly for the single
tucked off the toes once more
"<strong>pounded through midwicket. </strong>Just a flick off the pads, but such timing. On the pads, a freebie really. But there is no margin for error against these batsmen at the moment"

angled defence into the off side
"easy peasy, on the pads, flipped behind square"
"banged in short, <B>top-edged pull, but lands safe!</B>"

"whoo-wee, <b>that's gone wrong</b>... Swerving down the leg side and Sarfaraz is left in the dirt, five wides"
"short and wide and <b>slapped like dead kipper through backward point!</b> Bairstow dismisses a cut to the rope, using Hasnain's pace"
"shortish on off stump, defended towards his toes, YJB hares up the other end"
"fuller length, stroked towards extra cover in trademark Vince style"
"length ball, 85mph on middle and off, worked down towards midwicket"
"better from Hasnain, 87mph on off stump and Vince blocks it"
"short over the top of off, dabbed on the back foot towards gully for one"
"back of a length, slashed in the air, bouncing a few feet in front of third man"
"down the leg side, possible a slower ball gone wrong and Sarfaraz then adds a further daub of calamity to the picture by fumbling his take"
"pitched up, 88mph but leg side and that's easy pickings, leg glance and there's no one to stop it at fine leg"
"oh Vincey... dug in, top-edged and <b>taken at deep square!</b> Like a butterfly, he flutters off early once again, gone too soon for us to truly enjoy. Shakes his head as Shaheen does the Star Man mid-pitch. Vital breakthrough for Pakistan"
"banged in first ball and Root takes on the hook, <b>another swirling shot into the leg side</b>... but it lands safely behind square for a couple"
shortish on the hip and tucked to midwicket... but Shaheen had overstepped
"round the wicket, pitched up and <i>absolutely leathered</i>, Imad manages to cut it out at extra cover as they shoot through for a single"
clipped off the pads into a gap
"steps out to drive, classical stuff from Rooteh... <b>and he'll get four as Hasan dives over it at mid-off!</b> Extra cover left it for his team-mate, who sprawled to no good effect!"

<b>feeding him runs now...</b> Leg-stump half-volley and Root skelps it off his pads to fine leg!
"better length, tapped down to midwicket moving across"
"full on off, 86mph and Root wristily whips the ball to midwicket"
"round the wicket, darted in on the pads and Bairstow flicks it away fine for another boundary..."
floated up and tucked square
"cute from Root! <b>Goes for the reverse-paddle and gets it away fine</b>, think it came off the edge but zipped past keeper and then outran short third man to the rope!"
"bit of grip, <b>takes the edge playing back</b> ... but that's going to be four more! No luck here for Imad, just deflected past Sarfaraz's gloves"
tossed up and tapped into the covers
whipped off the pads to deep square
"pitched up and drilled down the ground! Beautifully struck, coming forwards and right out of the middle for four more!"
"full on middle, 82mph and flicked fine for one, <b>brings up the England 100 from just 62 balls</b>"

"fullish and driven, bouncing up towards mid-off"
"angling in on the stumps, 85mph and tucked towards midwicket"
"not a bad ball, but Bairstow is coming forward like a middleweight boxer off his stool, <b>belted on the up through cover</b> and the man in the deep fails to cut it off - a dive might have helped"
"floated up outside off, driven through the covers"
"flighted, YJB goes downtown... <b>chips it straight to the man at long-on!</b> Will that slow England down? Bairstow was clearly itching to get in on the fun having faced less than a third of the deliveries, but didn't get enough elevation on that shot"

comfortably nudged down leg
"a confident slap onto the on side, there's a bit of a muddle Hasan backs up Asif in the out field and they've scampered through for three"
driven back to the bowler
punched to long-on
that was a strong sweep to the boundary and that's his 30th fifty in ODIs ... it took him <b>just 37 balls</b> to get there!

"Buttler sways out of the way of that one, which bounced high"
nearly 89mph there ... and it was a full toss!
"a shorter ball, it spits up and he deflects it to the leg side"

"<b>picks out deep backward square!</b> Pakistan fans can thank me for the jinx later... Short and pulled straight to the man. Root smashes his bat into the ground, he is <i>thoroughly</i> miffed with that dismissal, mooching off towards the dressing rooms as the Yorkie crowd applaud his contribution. No ton today, lad, but by ecky thump tha's given 'em a platform"
"filthy, a wide half-tracker, <b>Buttler blaps it through backward point</b> - poor follow up after that wicket ball to Root"

"tucked off the hip, just one to the sweeper at deep square"
"oh, gone - <b>clubbed to backward point!</b> Buttler throws his head back in disgust, served up a wide half-tracker and he's hit it straight to the fielder at perfect catching height! That's a YUGE wicket for Pakistan, given the devastation Buttler could have served up"
"lobbed up wide of the stumps, reaches for the drive"
"spinning in,<b> struck on the pads going back</b>... Given by Reiffel! But Moeen <b>reviews</b> after a chat with his partner! Not sure this is going to save him, though, playing inside the line and struck dead in front of off stump. <b>Hitting the top of middle</b>, according to Hawk-Eye and Moeen is off again.

"banged in, 82mph and Woakes pulls, gets a top edge down to fine leg"
"length ball, <b>scooped down the ground and taken by mid-off!</b> Was Woakes hanging back for the short ball? He certainly didn't get his weight through that, a half-hearted plop back over the bowler's head, Babar running across to pouch it safely! The Star Child strikes again"
"full outside off, Stokes <i>hammers</i> a drive which <b>skips off a dry patch on the square and hurdles the dive of the fielder</b> - nothing he could do to stop that and it races to the rope!"

"spears in a wide yorker, jammed through to the keeper"
"bowled 'im! <b>Off stump zapped by a 90mph yorker!</b> Actually, it was probably a half-volley if Willey was forward, but backing away he had no chance... Shaheen punches the air, that's a decent penultimate delivery and it brings him a fourth wicket"

"full and a touch wide, Rashid flays it through cover point to the sweeper"

"fired in full and straight, dug out behind square but Curran refuses the single"
