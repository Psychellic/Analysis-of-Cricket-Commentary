"full outside off, left alone"
"full at middle and off, onto the front foot and pushes firmly to mid-off"
"good length at off stump, no width, defended to the on side"
"nearly cleans him up! Munro comes down the pitch, aims to go through the leg side, this grips off the surface - was a cutter - and skims past off stump"
"gets solidly forward into a good-length ball, timed nicely into the covers but a diving save keeps it to a single"
"cracking shot, gets forward to a full ball outside off and drives it straight down the ground...just has the legs to reach the rope"

pushes a good length ball to the covers

"swings across the line of a back-of-a-length delivery, doesn't make contact, taken on the pad and it loops to the leg side"
"on leg stump and another strong leg-side shot from Guptill, whips it off the pads behind square...was a knuckle ball"

"a short delivery pushed across outside off, carries over the top edge as Munro tries to go through point"
"Jordan does well here, gets his right hand down to intercept a firm straight drive as Munro latches onto a full delivery"
"short ball around leg stump, he pulls and gets enough bat to clear short fine leg...off the shoulder of the bat"
"a slower ball, dragged down outside leg stump, Munro plays a front-foot pull which nearly carries to deep square"
"gets a bottom end as he swings across the line of a back-of-a-length delivery...ah, no he doesn't, straight off his stomach"
"hammered! Gives himself a touch of room to the leg side and then flays this, a short-of-a-length delivery, over the off side...not far from carrying for six"
"fuller delivery, angled in at Guptill who again moves to the leg side, pushes it straight back past the bowler"

"full and straight, driven to long-off"
flicked off the stumps down to long-on
"the googly, he waits and nudges into midwicket"
"dragged down short, he pulls, in the air for a while but goes one bounce to Hales at deep square"

"a slower ball outside off, driven firmly into the covers where the fielder dives over the ball - the sub, Curran - and it beats the sweeper"

"another slog sweep, and again he clears the ropes, a skimming shot this time right between deep midwicket and long-on...that's an excellent 31-ball fifty"
"and again! That's a monster. A straighter, full, delivery, and strikes wonderfully cleanly through the shot. He knew it was six"

"<b>dropped</b>, but a tough one! Drilled straight down the pitch, Rashid sticks out his right hand and can't cling on"
tucked through the leg side
"oops! That's not the highest quality cricket you'll see, but it's a wicket. Guptill can only smile. A low full toss outside leg stump and it's paddle straight to short fine leg"
"what a catch! He won't last more than one ball. What a belter from Jordan from long-off. De Grandhomme goes for the big shot down the ground first ball, connects sweetly, but it starts to drop as it reaches the boundary. Jordan is right on the end, judges it to perfection, leaps and sticks up his right hand to pull off a blinder. Knew exactly where he was in relation to the rope"
no hat-trick as KW works a short-of-a-length ball into the leg side

"that's better from Wood, hits back of a length at 141kph and beats the outside edge"
"full outside off, clubbed through the leg side...has it found the gap? Long-on, Vince, gets around to flick it back but can the second man keep it inside the boundary...Billings just does it. Good work"
"back of a length outside off, pulled to deep midwicket"
"what a shot! That's a gem from Williamson. A thunderous bottom-handed whip to a very full ball outside off, sends it whistling between deep midwicket and long-on. Quite an innings from the skipper"

"into the stands (the empty bit of them)...moves across his crease, uses the angled into him with a length delivery, swings it mightily off his pads over deep backward square"
"back of a length, aims to the leg side, doesn't make contact...well, it seems England have <b>reviewed</b> this for lbw. Took everyone by surprise. This may have tickled the toe end. Third umpire thinks there's a gap between bat and ball. It's missing leg stump. What a waste of time"

"over deep midwicket! Wood went back of a length, a cutter, Chapman stayed deep in his crease and pulled it powerfully"
"tries to get inventive, right across outside off and attempts to scoop a short delivery over short fine leg"
"very wide down the leg side, Chapman moving to the leg side but that's comfortably a wide"
"<B>dropped</b> at deep midwicket, by Billings...moves to the leg side, flicks this from around leg stump, was a low chance but Billings got there"
"goes across the crease and tries to scoop a very full delivery, bottom edge into his boot but given leg bye"
"short of a length outside off, tapped into the covers"
"full, down the leg side, another extra run and ball"
"this time Billings takes it. Round the wicket, back of a length, Chapman pulls again but this time doesn't get the distance. Simple catch"
"full outside off, not quite the yorker but it's a dot as he swings and misses"
"full toss, straight, takes a thick outside edge towards third man"
all the way! Jordan offers up a length ball and it's sliced high over point...that's the power he's shown in the domestic game
"clears the ropes a second time...Jordan has missed his yorker, it's a full length at off stump, Seifert can get underneath it and creams a lofted drive over long-off. Great hitting"

"length, sits up in the surface and this is blapped through the covers now, back-to-back boundaries for Roy, who powers it to the rope"
"round the wicket and lobbed up on off, defended"
"flighted, slow and dipping around leg stump, Hales gets down and paddles a sweep to deeps square"

dragged down and Hales chops the ball to mid-on off the back foot
"short of a length, forced on the up - <b>and dollied to mid-on!</b> Roy falls in single-figures again, the boom time of the MCG last month very much turned to bust. Boult takes a simple catch for his mate Southee and NZ have the breakthrough"
"short, climbing through in the channel as Malan swings hard and misses"
"pitched up and clubbed in front of cover, sweet connection but Colin De Grandhomme throws himself after it to prevent a run"

"round the wicket to Malan, who stays back and works one past short fine leg"
"angled in flat on middle and leg, Hales defends"

"flighted, Malan goes down to sweep, again they think about the lbw... but I think he got some bottom edge on that"
"short ball, swung into the stands! H-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-g-h and long enough, a shooting star in the Wellington sky as Hales swats the first six of the innings with impunity"
fullish outside off and clubbed to cover
"length ball, Hales hammers a flat pull, bounces <i>just</i> in front of a sprawling mid-on"
"over the wicket, fired in full on the stumps, Hales is waiting for it... and squirts four from right in front of off stump, past backward point and racing away"
"six more, Hales murder-balls a pull over deep midwicket! Used the pace on it, 139kph but Hales stood tall and tucked in, hit it flat in front of the man on the rope and it went all the way"
"round the wicket, full on off - and slashed for another boundary! Again he sat back and picked the full ball, sliced through gully... <b>and that's the England 50 up inside five overs</b>"
full and driven without timing towards mid-on
"dug in halfway down, wobbly seam and Malan pulls off the splice, bounces towards mid-on again"

floated up and worked back down the track to the bowler
"slips the wrong'un in, Malan was backing away, completely off balance as he swung and missed"

"humpty! Slogged into the stands at deep midwicket! Hales heaves it away into the crowd again, hitting against the turn, a six to keep England up with the rate"
"round the wicket, dobbed on off and flicked away to short fine leg"
"over the wicket, Munro sends down a cutter which Hales prods to mid-off"
"length in the channel, driven towards cover"
"on the stumps, continuing to take the pace off, clipped towards deep midwicket for one"
"very slow and loopy, popped off the knuckles by Munro but it's basically a full toss that Malan hits straight to cover on the bounce"
"strays a touch straight and Malan works one through backward square - decent over for NZ, pulling it back a touch"
"slides the googly through but Malan gets it away first ball, reverse-slapped past point and he puts the pressure on the bowler for the rest of the over"
pushes through the legbreak and Malan sweeps it for one
"drops short, Hales brings out the hammer... <b>and sends it straight to deep midwicket!</b> He should have put that into the bleachers again but instead plinked the ball off the toe of the bat, serving up the simplest of boundary catches"
"doesn't seem to pick the googly, hits inside edge on to pad"
"flighted, driven coming forwards and he places it front of the sweeper for a couple"
"tossed up, Vince sweeps square, in between two men but they think better of coming back for two"
"ooh, nearly bowls him! Vince plays all around it, deflects off the keeper's pads into off stump but he was inside his ground"
"woof, that's a shot! Lofted down the ground for six! Another slow floater from Munro but Vince picks it up and deposits it gently over long-off"
"on the stumps, nurdled into a gap"
"round the wicket to the southpaw, Malan tries to slog-sweep but only succeeded in deflecting the ball up into his helmet, knocking off the stem guards in the process"

"backs away and tries to slap through the off side, mistimed for one"
wicket-to-wicket and he can't get it away
"<b>dropped!</b> Although it would have been a blinding catch in the deep... Santner was running across from long-off and threw himself to his right, but the ball squirted through for four"
pushed full outside off and Malan chops a drive for one
"keep on running...! <b>Williamson's direct hit sends Vince back!</b> Could he have dived for the line? It was just a tip-and-run to mid-off, Williamson was on to it quickly and fired in the throw right arm, Vince seemed to think he would make it and only stretched for the line at the last moment - but he knows he was gone"

drops short now and Malan reverse-pulls it over backward point! Bit top-edgey but it bounces away
tossed up and pushed into the covers
"Buttler on the charge, brutal blow... but is it holding up in the wind? Yes, it is, and it's <b>taken safely at long-off!</b> Looked for all the world as if Buttler had drilled another into the crowd but that's the longer part of the ground and the ball swirled and dropped, Southee readjusted and steadied himself under it, pouched with nary a flutter. Huge wicket for Sodhi, who's taken some punishment"

"Billing plants the front foot, heaves a slog-sweep across the line... but fails to connect"
"short ball, backing away and swung off his nose, gets it away past fine leg! First boundary for Billings, handily done"

"gottim, <b>top-edged to short fine leg!</b> Brave bowling from Santner, floated up nice and juicy but wide of the stumps and he had to fetch the sweep, Billings swung impetuously across the line but only managed to lollipop the ball up towards the edge of the ring, where Sodhi flung his lanky frame forward to take the catch"
"dances out and drives, gets the ball straight back down the ground but it wasn't a clean hit and they settle for two"

drops short and Willey again clubs a couple through the covers
"<b>dropped!</b> Dropped for six - Santner again! Blootered down the ground but it went straight to long-on, a nice, catchable chance at head height, and he's instead spiked it over the rope as if he's a volleyball player"
tossed up and pulled away for a couple through square lefg
"Malan shuffles in his crease, Santner sprays it wide on the off side"
BOOM! Malan dances out and <i>hammers</i>  a floaty one waaaaaaaaaay back for six more!
"tossed up, takes the bait - <b>and taken this time!</b> Santner gets Malan, Boult darting to his right at long-on and grabbing this one to make England's task that bit harder. Just didn't get hold of the shot, but another fine knock, his third fifty in four innings"
"flighted, powered through the fielder in the covers for one"
lobbed up and Jordan prods it back
"<b>dropped!</b> Another howler, Southee barely getting a hand on this one! Jordan top-edged a slog into the leg side, Southee came in from deep midwicket and went with the ball, crouching low... but it burst through and hit him on the knee!"
"shaping in from over the wicket, Jordan misses with a big swing... but Seifert also fails to intercept it and they scamper a couple of byes"
"pitched up towards the blockhole, swung away to fine leg off the inside edge"
"fired full and wide towards the tramlines, 133kph and Willey was set to swing, could only jam
e the toe of the bat on it"
"short ball, it sits up for Jordan to <i>smash</i> through midwicket, a wristy pull and he gets it in the gap"
"timbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Full and straight, <b>Boult pings off stump!</b> Jordan has to swing for the hills but the bowler is bang on the money and England are running out of loose change"
"two in two, <b>Plunkett yorked first ball!</b> Take the catchers out of the equation... He stepped down and played all around it, Boult rattles the woodwork again and NZ are closing in relentlessly"
"goes full and wide from over the wicket, Willey stretches to chop down on it"
slides a length ball behind the pads - England need a few of those
"pitched up, 129kph on off, nothing Rashid can do with it"

"pitched up and flubbed through mid-off, that will only be a single..."
"brilliant yorker from Southee, he can only squeeze it out towards the keeper... and then <b>another direct hit runs out Willey!</b> Seifert, the debutant, was alert to the run, scurried up and dove full length to underarm into the poles and catch Willey short trying to steal a single!"
"no, swung to the leg side, they hurry back for two"
"fired full outside off, sliced away through backward point for just a single"
short outside off and Wood top-edges four over the keeper! Didn't know much about it but England remain (just) in the hunt!
"dot ball from Boult, all but seals it... cool as you like, full and wide and he fails to connect"
"pitched full outside off, clouted through cover"
"pitched up and Rashid swishes an inside edge off his pads... it trickles away but that won't bother the men in black, <b>New Zealand win by 12 runs</b> and give themselves an excellent shot of reaching the tri-series final"
