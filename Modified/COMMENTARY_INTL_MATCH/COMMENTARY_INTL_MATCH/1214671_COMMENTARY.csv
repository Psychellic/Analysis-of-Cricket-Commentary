"nice, accurate start, skidding on to him. Kamunhukamwe defends from the crease"
"The Fizz keeps it very tight on an off stump line, and possibly some shape back in to the right hander, who defends"
"<b>boom!</b> Kamunhukamwe's not one to move his feet too much, but his eye is good. This is stand-and-deliver stuff as he sizes up a full ball and hammers it down the ground"
"slower ball, on his legs, and it's tucked just wide of midwicket for one"
"angling across him, with some cut away. Taylor shuffles across to defend"
"shooting across him, on a length, and Taylor jabs defensively at it from the crease"
and he's welcomed with another crunching shot! Kamunhukamwe stands tall to send a cut thundering through backward point. He hits them pretty hard
"<b>play and a miss!</b> Kamunhukamwe throws everything into this one, clearing the left leg and swinging mightily. But he's comprehensively beaten by a full outswinger"
"yorker this time, and it's kept out with a hurried jab. Saifuddin looks very sharp"
"short, and he swivels into a pull, but the ball gets big on him and loops off the splice. It lands safely, but it's just the one"
"another outswinger, in the channel, and Taylor defends another one"
"and now he's off the mark, picking a full one off his pads and down to fine leg for one"
"he starts with a short one outside off, Taylor taking his bottom hand off the bat as he slices it down to third man"
"<b>cuts him in half!</b> Kamunhukamwe stands tall and looks to whip the ball square, but it cuts away to beat the edge"
"<b>one shot too many</b>, Kamunhukamwe falling early after a frenetic start to his knock. He walks across to the off side and bends down, aiming for a scoop shot, but the ball bursts past him, kissing the edge and nestling safely in Mushfiqur's gloves. First blood, Bangladesh"
"shaping in to him at a shade over 128km/h, Ervine glances off the pad"
"slower one, a cutter at 121km/h outside off. Taylor waits on it, dabbing to gully. Ervine has to hustle to make it to the other side"
"Ervine hangs his bat out at a delivery angled across him at 131km/h, a thick edge bouncing down to third man. Just the one"
"<b>cracking first delivery in international cricket!</b> He aims it nice and full, searching for swing, and it nips away from Ervine at the last moment to beat the outside edge of an attempted glance. Close!"
"a touch shorter and straighter, Ervine defends"
"nice and tight, on an off stump line, and Ervine is rushed a little in defence"
"<b>through him!</b> This lands on a leg stump line, and seams across him to beat the outside edge. Get that slip back in!"
"nippy ball, at just over 140km/h, but the line is a little off and Ervine picks it up over square leg. But it's not that well timed, and there's protection in the deep"
"<b>dropped!</b> Taylor walks across into a scoop shot, but he gets more height than distance on it and Al-Amin backpeddles furiously from short fine leg. He gets to it, just about, but can't cling on to the chance"
"he cramps Ervine for room, hitting a length on middle and off. Defended to cover, with a hint of leading edge"
"<b>sliced through the slips!</b> Well, the fielder's been moved out of that position, and he might have been in business here. Ervine slashes outside off, and a thick edge flies down to third man"
"and again, Ervine makes room and slashes a thick outside edge down to third man. Squarer this time, so it's stopped. Still no slip"
"just short of a length, Taylor turns the strike over with a tip and run single to leg"
"Ervine makes room, but Mustafizur follows him with a short one that cramps him for room"
"Ervine glances uppishly into the leg side, but the ball comes to ground just wide of midwicket and there's room for a quick single"
"<b>sharp yorker</b>, snaking in to Ervine through the air. He does well to get his bat down in time, and the ball rolls behind square"
"<b>canny bowling, this</b>, Saifuddin jamming a slower bouncer into the turf. Taylor sets himself for a cut, but he's through the shot by the time the ball arrives"
"quicker one, just above 133km/h, and he jams a drive through the covers"
"offcutter, another slower ball at around 115km/h, Taylor uses the angle to find a single on the leg side"
"spits at him off a length to take the splice of the bat, the ball flies in the air but lands well short of the cover fielder. There's definitely life in the track for these quicks"
"his line drifts towards Ervine's pads at 125km/h, and he's picked up over the leg side. But there's a man in the deep to save the boundary"
"<b>scooped through gully</b>, and it beats third man. Not exactly where Taylor was aiming with this expansive drive, but they all count"
"rasping cut from Taylor as Mahmud offers a little width, but the shot goes straight to point"
"Taylor shimmies down the track and swings hard, but the ball zips past him in a flash. Good wheels from the youngster, 136km/h"
"width offered again as he hits a length at 134km/h, and there's a hint of bottom edge to Taylor's thump through the covers"
"and he's got a slower ball too, this one being sent down at just under 118km/h, but it's well read by Ervine, who guides down to third man"
"<b>cleanly struck!</b> Taylor's found the middle of his bat, and he lets his left elbow lead with this glorious straight six down the ground. It went very high, and perhaps not as far as he was aiming, but with enough on it to land safely beyond the boundary"
"he comes around the stumps to Ervine, who walks out at him and places a drive into the covers"
"flat and fast, speared at his pads. Taylor glances to deep backward square"
"reverse sweep from Ervine, who connects well enough but can't place it past the  man at short third"
a chopped cut rolls into the covers
"a bit more flight on this one, and he drives to long on"
"hurled down full, Taylor flicks off his toes for one"
"attempted scoop from Taylor, but the ball is a slower one and doesn't have the pace he's looking for. Fortunately for him, the ball lands short of short fine leg"
"Ervine gives him the charge, Al-Amin pulls his length back, and a pull rolls out to deep square leg"
"slower ball, outside off, and it fizzes past the outside edge of an attempted dab, dying in front of the keeper"
"a mistimed drive rolls just wide of mid off, only a single"
"<b>fortunate, but they all count!</b> Al-Amin sends down a sharp yorker that dips in towards his toes, Ervine swings at it and a thick inside edge sends the ball through his legs and down to fine leg"
"<b>sharp running</b>, Ervine tapping to cover and setting off. They're both safely home, but a direct hit could have been interesting"
"looped down well wide, Ervine reaches for a drive but misses. Close to the wide line there"
"full and wide again, pushed hard back to the bowler"
"Ervine makes room, and slashes a cut into the deep ... they hustle hard, turning for the second as the throw comes in. Well, a better throw could have had him there, but it's just wide and Ervine is safely home"
"<b>big appeal as ball hits pad!</b> This doesn't look good for Ervine, the ball rushed on with the arm as he turned himself into a reverse sweep. He missed the shot, and the ball pinged off the front pad. Up goes the finger, but <b>Ervine wants a review</b>. No bat on it. Was this headed down the leg side on the angle? Yes it was! Would have missed leg stump, and Ervine survives"
"<b>firm riposte</b>, Ervine skipping out to get to the pitch and driving him up and over extra cover. Clean hit, and he aims it straight through the gap"
"very full, dug out into the leg side and they sprint through to <b>raise the fifty partnership</b>"
"<b>pace and bounce</b>, the ball rushing past Ervine in a flash as he walks down into a pull. It was banged down hard into the turf and whizzed past the pull and the grille"
"his follow-up is a yorker at around 129km/h, the ball hitting the pad well outside leg"
"this lands and seams away outside off, Taylor thrusts his hands out at it to find a single behind square"
"another yorker, shaping in to him through the air. Ervine misses a big swipe, but they pinch a single off the pad. Pitching well outside leg"
"<b>Ervine's in danger!</b> Taylor hammers a full toss very hard back down the pitch, and Ervine can't get out of the way in time. The ball hits him in the chest. He's smiling about it though, no major damage"
"nicely played, Taylor opening up his stance and lifting an inside-out drive wide of long off. It's got the legs to go all the way. Zimbabwe need more of that"
"<b>Ervine holes out!</b> Afif is ecstatic. He looped his first ball up outside off and Ervine tried to go over long off, but sliced under the ball a little too much. Soumya settles under it, having run in a couple of yards from the long off boundary, and holds a simple catch"
"there's some excitement as Taylor misses a reverse sweep outside off, but he's got nothing on it"
"very full, glanced off the toes for one"
"Williams makes some room and gets a thick outside edge on an attempted cut, the ball rolling to short third man"
"floated up outside off, Williams stretches forward to drive to cover"
"more flight outside off, this time Williams aims his drive at long off for a single"
"he bangs it in just short of a length at 135km/h, Williams chopping a backfoot punch into the covers"
"a touch short, outside off at 135km/h and Taylor swivels into a pull, rolling his wrists on the shot to keep it down"
"Mahmud aims for that bat-jarring length again, and this one rushes Williams pull a little at 137km/h, skidding on to him"
"<b>past the outside edge!</b> Williams makes room, but the ball bounces and seams past his attempted cut"
"good looking shot for just a single, Williams leaning over into a leg glance at a quick one, the ball delivered at over 139km/h. But his shot finds midwicket"
"sharp yorker, but Taylor spots it early and digs it out into the leg side, grabbing a single to keep the strike"
"quicker one, slips out as a full toss and it's glanced just wide of short fine leg"
"<b>stumped!</b> Williams charges out, but he can't get to the pitch of it and he's undone by some extra bounce. The ball didn't turn all that much, but zipped over the top of his swipe to leg. And that's Mahedi's very first international wicket!"
"speared down full, on off stump, dug out"
"<b>dropped!</b> This was a regulation chance, how has he missed that? Raza charges the bowler and swings the ball in the air on the leg side. But he wasn't close to timing it, and Soumya barely had to move. He didn't watch the ball into his hands, perhaps just relaxing a little as it seemed such a simple chance"
"punched down the ground, just the one"
dug out back to the bowler
"he starts with a cutter, outside off, and it's chopped just wide of gully for one"
"angling across him, Raza forcing into the covers"
"<b>extra bounce</b>, Mustafizur rolling his fingers over a back-of-a-length cutter and getting some extra lift off the track to beat an attempted cut"
"<b>this time he rides the bounce</b>, Raza hopping in the air to get above it and placing a rasping cut well in front of square to reach the boundary"
soft hands and supple wrists bring a single into the leg side
"<b>extra bounce</b> yet again, Mustafizur is finding conditions very much to his liking. This isn't quick, under 124km/h, but it's that cutter and it comes to life off the grassy track, leaping at Taylor, who fends to leg"
"<b>lapped over short fine!</b> Taylor walks across and lifts a length delivery cleanly over short fine leg. He tried the shot earlier and it didn't come off, but this time it does"
"<b>in the air, but safe</b>, Taylor leaping into an uppercut at a short, wide one. The ball flies off the bat, going high but not very far, and landing in front of third man, who charges in off the rope"
"good running, Raza nudging to leg and immediately calling 'two, BT, two!' They run hard and make it easily"
"<b>clubbed down the ground</b>, Raza opens up his stance and hammers a full one back over Saifuddin's head"
"<b>slapped hard, but straight to the fielder</b>. Canny bowling from Saifuddin, who loops down a back-of-the-hand slower ball. Raza spots it, getting across to flash a scoop behind square. But he can't get the elevation he wants, picking out the man at short fine leg"
"just short of a length, and seaming in a touch. Mutumbami glances uppishly through square leg for one"
"<b>regulation chance, easily held!</b> Hossain hits a length and Mutumbami rocks back into a big heave into the leg side. The shot was on, but the timing was off. Bangladesh have another one"
"another one is skewed off the toe end, an off drive landing well in front of long off"
"slower ball, a leg cutter, and there's a hint of leading edge to Tino's shot, but it rolls into space in the covers"
"just short of a length, and it's slugged into the leg side. Again, timing evades him"
"Hossain finds some bite in the track with another leg cutter at 123km/h, Tino opens the face of the blade to get it through gully"
"<b>very well bowled</b>, a nippy yorker that shapes in to Taylor, dipping under his jab but through his legs and safely past the leg stump"
"just short of a length, seaming in to him. Tino uses the angle to flick a single off the hip"
"Taylor sets himself early for a reverse lap, but the ball dips under the bat"
"<b>slower ball, hammered back over his head</b>, and Taylor finds the middle. There are men out straight, but he spotted the slower one and spanked it straight back over the bowler"
"the comeback is a nippy yorker at 136.4km/h, Taylor digging it out into the leg side"
"short, just outside off, and it whizzes past Mutombodzi's slightly wild pull in a flash"
"another short one, and it likewise has the beating of Mutombodzi, bursting past him. Strong finish to his first international outing for Mahmud"
"big heave from Taylor at a full one, the ball comes off the toe end and rolls to gully"
"<b>another swing and a miss</b>, Mutombodzi struggling a little here. The ball was full and wide, angled across him"
"<b>top edge, and a simple catch!</b> Mustafizur follows the full, wide one up with a short ball that bounces up at Mutombodzi. He pulls at it, aiming for the stands, but he's undone by the extra bounce. The ball takes the splice and loops tamely out to deep midwicket, where the fielder trots in to hold a regulation outfield catch.  Never really got going, did Tino, and Bangladesh have another one"
"<b>what a shot from Taylor</b>, he reverses his stance and lifts a full ball up and over short third man with a reverse lap. It's been a very tough tour from him, but he's finally delivered a half century - his sixth in this format"
"short and wide, outside off, and an angled cut brings a single behind square"
"<b>holes out first ball!</b> Madhevere perishes in the pursuit of quick runs. The ball was short, another cutter, and it got big on him. He opened his stance and set himself at the crease, but couldn't hit it long enough to beat long on"
"slower ball, outside off, and it's swung down to fine leg"
"another slower one, outside off, and Taylor flings a drive over the top of it"
"<b>cheeky, cheeky stuff!</b> Taylor waits and waits on a full one, practically a yorker, and opens up the face of the bat to lift it over short third man"
"short, rising over leg stump as Taylor shuffles across and misses a pull"
"<b>brilliant slower ball</b>, very full and quite wide, but just inside the wide line. It dips under a flailing drive from Taylor"
"full again, a quicker one at over 127km/h. Taylor shuffles across, but he can't get it away, just a quick single to finish"
"length ball on middle and leg, eased towards midwicket to get off the mark"
"length ball around off, punched towards extra cover"
"slower in the air, length around off, pushes it towards long-off"
"length ball around off, flicks it towards wide long-on for one"
"short and way outside off, slow turn. Naim cuts it straight towards cover. A missed opportunity"
