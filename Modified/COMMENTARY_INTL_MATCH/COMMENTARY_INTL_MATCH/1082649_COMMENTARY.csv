"fuller ball, slanted across around a set of stumps outside off, Lynn crashes a drive to covers"
"fuller ball at 146ks, outside off, Lynn pushes it back off the inside part of the bat"
"length ball, he is tucked up for room and fails to make contact as he tries to tuck it away"
"back of a length and angled across, swing and a miss outside off"
"<b>in the air and safe</b>. Short ball, Lynn tries to hook but it gets slightly big on him and Lynn is tucked up for room. Gets a top-edge and short fine leg runs to his left, but the ball lands safely in the backward square leg region. Malinga was the fielder, runs across and slides but ends up misfielding and concedes two runs"
"fuller ball, angled across but swinging back in, takes the inside part of the bat to midwicket"
"length ball on off, gets the front leg out of the way and shovels it with a flat bat down to long-on for one"
"full toss from Bumrah, Narine pushes it to wide mid-off"
"mid-on had just dropped back a few balls earlier and Lynn has now picked him out. Bumrah slants in a fuller ball, Lynn tries to loft it. He is particularly strong through that arc but this time he gets elevation but not the distance. Perhaps didn't get the room he was looking for to swing his arms. Pollard runs in for the deep and takes a reverse-cupped catch"
"length, on middle and off, Gambhir defends back solidly"
"that's a ripper. Short of good length ball, angled across the left-hander. Gambhir is stapled to the crease and also tries to flick across the line, shoots past the outside edge"
similar delivery and now Gambhir tries to open the face of his bat late. But it jags away further and beats the edge again
"short ball, tries to cut and cannot connect"
"shortish ball, Narine is tucked up for room and he tries to pull it away, gets a top edge that goes on the bounce to deep backward square leg"
"shot! Nice, clean drive through covers and he splits the gap between cover and mid-off. Very full and giving him all the room he is looking for outside off"
"back of a length, angling in on off, Gambhir jumps up to deal with the bounce and tucks it behind square on the leg side"
"bangs another one in on the ribs, Narine manages to tuck it away to deep backward square leg fairly comfortably"
"short ball, Gambhir barely has to duck. The bounce is too steep and it's called a wide"
"width on offer outside off, Gambhir tries to cut but it's not short enough and he chops it towards point"
"length ball, on leg stump, Narine tries to whip it away without moving his feet, keeps slightly low and pings him on the pad before rolling away to the off side"
"gets forward and taps this to mid-off. Slight yes-and-no as Gambhir stops in his tracks after starting off, completes it eventually"
"wristy from Narine! Fullish length on middle and leg, Narine whips it uppishly and comfortably gets it over deep midwicket running to his left"
"length, outside off, punched off the backfoot to long-off"
"good length ball, slightly shaping away off the seam, Gambhir tries to open the bat face late and gets beaten"
"good length ball, again he tries to steer it but this time he has opened the face of his bat too early and ends up chopping it off the splice. Misses the stumps and thinks of a single as the ball goes behind the wicket but eventually decides against it"
"tries to whip one away over the square leg region but it's full and on leg stump channel, not giving him any room and he gets hit on the pad"
"and again, fails to make contact as he tries to heave a length ball over the leg side"
"flighted outside off, Gambhir taps it away to midwicket for a single"
"done in by the angle! This is beautifully done by the bowler. It's a googly and Narine has no clue about that. Gives the bowler the early charge and Narine swipes against the line looking for a big one over the leg side. It is also slanted across so he is done in by the angle as well as the turn, which is away from him. Parthiv does the rest"
"flighted on leg, Uthappa pushes it wide of long-on for a single"
"slanted across outside off, Gambhir goes after it with a half-angled bat. A tad full for that and he makes no connection"
"fuller ball, angled in outside off from wide of the crease, defended back"
"goes for a flick across the line and Bumrah finds the pad. Looked plumb from the moment it hit the pad. Bumrah angles it in on middle from wide of the crease and he does it at pace, 144ks. Uthappa tries to turn it away and gets beaten as the ball shoots into him, plays all around the pad and gets hit above the knee roll. Could it have been high? May have been umpire's call"
"back of a length on off, stays in the crease and opens the face of his bat to backward point"
"brilliant effort from Hardik at backward point. Slightly short of good length, Jaggi taps it into the ground and the ball goes behind square, Hardik darts across and flings himself to his left to field it one-handed"
"short of a length, angled in on off and Jaggi tries to open the face of his bat clumsily. No room at all and he gets beaten, ball goes just over off-stump"
"good length ball, punched solidly to mid-off. No run there"
comes down the track and goes beautifully inside-out. And he is helped by the angle. It is nicely slanted across and that gives him the room to launch it with free arms
"pushed across on a fullish length again, pushed down to long-off for one"
"back of a length, waits for it to spin away and wristily whips it from outside off through midwicket"
"tosses it up just slightly and fires it at a tight line on the stumps, Gambhir plants the front foot half forward and the ball spins in to beat the attempted tuck. Hit on the pad but would have missed leg as the turn suggests"
"follows up with a flat ball with one that is flighted on off, Gambhir comes down, gives himself the required room and goes over the top. Just that it is against the turn and it needed some serious power to fetch it from that wide and whack it all the way. Finds a waiting Hardik at deep midwicket"
"pings him on the back leg and Nigel Llong raises his finger almost immediately. Does not pick the googly at all. He is stuck on the backfoot and gets pinged right in front of leg. What's worse, the ball does not turn in like a regular googly. Had it turned, it would have missed leg. But because it came on with the arm, it was plumb in front of leg"
"short of a length and width outside off, backs away and cuts, finds backward point"
"fuller this time, driven out square of the wicket, through point"
"sliding on leg, fullish length, taps it through midwicket"
"back of a length, on off and not much spin away, punched through covers off the backfoot"
"short of a length, not much spin so he whips it against the turn between deep midwicket and long-on"
"length on off, these are tight lines, punched straight back to the bowler"
"spinning away sharply from a length, beats the bat as he tries to half-slap it away"
"fuller ball on the stumps, pushed off the front foot to the right of the bowler"
"just back of a length, not much turn this away, pulled away to midwicket"
"back of a length, turning away, whipped against the spin to midwicket"
"flighted outside off, driven down to long-off"
"full, on off, plants the front foot forward and gently taps it to cover for one"
"length, holding its line outside off, tentatively pokes and gets beaten"
comes down the track and Malinga drops his pace. Full and angling into him so giving him no room at all as he looks to heave it over the leg side
"back of a length, bang on the stumps, so no room. Opens the face of his bat and chops it into the ground partly off the glove. Takes off for a single though it goes straight to point and has to scamper back"
"length ball on leg stump, Jaggi makes a lot of room and exposes his stumps and punches it just wide of mid-off"
"full and drifting on the pads now, clipped uppishly to deep square leg"
"good length on off, whips it between deep midwicket and long-on"
that's a six as flat as any you would see. Gets down and across outside off and nails a sweep. The ball also pitches around leg stump so makes great connection. Over deep backward square
"fuller, pushed back to the bowler"
"fullish length ball, drops it into covers off the front foot and takes off for a quick single as the bowler darts across and picks it up"
whipped against the turn to deep midwicket
"length, on middle, punched down to long-on"
"tries to go against the turn again and shovel sweep it over the leg side, gets the leading edge that goes to short third man"
"crashes this through extra cover. Johnson fires in a full ball, from wide of the crease, outside off, Jaggi comes down the track, backs away as he does so and has to end up slightly reaching out for it but makes superb connection"
"whips it away from middle stump to deep midwicket, Rayudu gets around it from deep square leg and slides to his left in front of the ropes"
"shortish and angled across outside off, tries to cut it uppishly but the bounce gets big on him and he makes no contact"
"short ball, banged in on middle and leg, Suryakumar gets under it and gets a menacing stare from the bowler"
"full, clipped off the pads to midwicket and there is a hesitation on the single. Midwicket runs to his left and fires a throw at the non-striker's end and misses. Would have been out by a mile"
"short ball, hammers a pull but straight to midwicket"
"full ball, gets down and nails a sweep from off that races away into the deep square leg boundary"
now he takes it away from the batsman and Suryakumar makes a lovely adjustment. Comes down the track and lofts it inside-out over extra cover. Top shot
drags the length back and Suryakumar cuts hard square of the wicket
"flat back of a length ball, whipped through square leg for a single"
"fullish on middle and leg, comes forward and pushes it back to the bowler"
"flat length ball, fired in at 94 clicks and misses the attempted tuck to ping him on the pad. Would have missed leg"
"great shot. Off-cutter from Malinga, pitching on off and middle, picks it up early, gets down on one knee and whips it uppishly through square leg"
"short of good length on the stumps, comes down the track and punches it firmly to extra cover"
"fuller ball on off, slow again at 118 kph, clipped uppishly as he does not pick the drop in pace, through midwicket"
"slips out of his hand, bowls a full toss on leg, Jaggi misses the flick as the ball drifts in to take the pad on its way to fine leg"
"length on off, punched to the right of cover for a single"
"oh, what a shot! Tell you what, this one didn't deserve to be put away for four. It's a yorker and Jaggi gets right underneath it to clip it muscularly between deep midwicket and long-on. Beats the former running to his left. Powerful wrists"
"pitches it up on middle and leg, pushed along the ground to wide long-on for one"
"flat, short and pitching outside leg, swivels around and gets in position to middle a powerful pull shot, deep backward square leg runs to his left - Krunal the man - and slides in front of the boundary to stop it"
"length on leg stump, turned away to midwicket, thinks of the second but the fielder at the deep is on to it quickly and they settle for one"
"too wide outside off, called a wide"
"fuller on middle and leg, pushes it out square of the wicket with an open bat face, can't find the gap"
"times it well and strikes it powerfully but he has picked out long-on. Gives it just about enough flight to draw the batsman out of his crease. Lands full on leg and Jaggi is down the track, it's a tad too full so he was perhaps not able to completely get underneath that one. Shovels it with hard hands but it's a fairly straightforward catch for Johnson"
"pushed across full outside off, driven down to long-off"
"length ball, jags away slightly after pitching, knocked to covers for a single"
"short ball, angling in this time, pulled away off the hips to deep backward square leg who does not make a very tidy effort and allows the batsmen to push back for the second"
"short of a length and angling in, backs away and taps it down to third man with an open bat face"
"tries an uppercut to this short ball that is slanted across, makes no contact"
"tries the same thing again, banged in again but closer to leg stump this time, can't make contact"
"back of a length, backs away and taps it but can't find the gap at cover. These are vital dots at the slog"
"tries to bang it in but gets the line horribly wrong, drags it down the leg side by some distance"
"picks out mid-off. Fuller ball, it's the slower one. Chawla does not pick it, tries to loft and finds the top end of the bat, simple catch for Rayudu"
"full and outside off, goes for an extravagant drive and gets beaten as there isn't enough room"
"that's outta here mate! Short ball, sitting up nicely for Coulter-Nile, just outside off, rocks back and swats a pull into the second-tier"
short ball from Johnson - what else was the response going to be? Coulter-Nile gets out of the way
"fuller ball does him in. Tries to loft it from front of the pads but there was no pace, hence doesn't find the distance. Hardik Pandya runs to his right from long-on and takes it"
"full, pushed across outside off, driven down to long-off"
"Malinga takes quite a good catch at deep fine leg. He made it harder for himself, but, to his credit, adjusts well in the end. It was a short ball and angling in to Suryakumar. He tries to hook but gets a top-edge. Malinga runs forward but slightly misjudges it, didn't get as close to it, has to end up diving forward to take it"
"back of a length ball, punched off the backfoot to covers"
backs away trying to heave it over the leg side and the ball goes off the inside edge to fine leg for four
"fullish length, outside off, punched into covers"
"tries to open the face of his bat, tucked up for room as the ball bounces over the bat and goes to the keeper"
"yorker, angled in. Rajpoot had backed away, exposing his stumps. The ball misses leg stump ever-so-closely as well as the bat"
"very slow full ball, barely comes on, tries to drive through the off side and misses"
"another slower ball, this one's on a length and comes on at 112 kph, whipped away to deep midwicket"
"dipping yorker, just outside off, slower too, he backs away and swings hard, misses as he gets nowhere close to it"
"another slower-ball yorker, this one's even closer to off and dipping again, stays leg side of it and has no clue how to play it. Makes no contact and that has missed off-stump by centimetres"
"make that a hat-trick of yorkers and finally he manages to hit the stumps with one. Rolled his fingers over that one and fires it in on leg stump, following the batsman who is backing away. Dips considerably late and crashes into leg stump after beating the bat"
"shortish delivery outside off to start. Some away movement. Simmons picks the length early, but chooses the wrong shot - a cut would have been better than his pull. Skewed to mid-on"
"uh oh. Naughty naughty. Full and wide outside off, carved away towards point. Jaggi runs to his left, misfields and almost trips Suryakumar too. A sloppy two conceded"
"aargh.<strong> Keeps low.</strong> Full, straight and accurate. Simmons plays back, like Steven Smith in the Bangalore Test to Umesh. The ball keeps low, takes Simmons' under-edge onto his pad. Ricochets away to point for a tight single."
"full and wide outside off, not much movement. Beats Parthiv's exuberant drive."
"nope, don't bowl there. On the hips and Parthiv misses out on four, but Mumbai doesn't. Off the thigh pad down to the fine leg boundary"
"yumm. Full and wide outside off, Parthiv transfers his weight onto his back foot, like he has been doing to quick bowlers all his life. And then uses that weight to lean into a drive. Races away through cover. Delectable stroke-making"
"a low full toss on off, driven to shot cover's right, a nice dive to save four"
"91 kph, flat and full outside off. Simmons drives hard to mid-off, who dives to his right this time. Nicely done"
"and out. Goes wide of the crease, and releases a googly that doesn't turn. Simmons gets a long stride in front and is struck in front of middle. Pad then bat. But that drifted on. Didn't read that variation. With that angle, was it going down leg? KKR don't care. <b>Missing the stumps says HawkEye</b>. Not a howler in any sense."
"96 kph, drifts down leg for an extra"
driven away to long-on
"another short, quick dart outside off. 101 kph. Cut to point for a run"
goes too straight this time. Parthiv picks him off to deep square leg. Tidy start from Piyush
"nice! Fullish and wide outside off. Hit on the up, no footwork. Driven into the gap at wide mid-off, the fielder didn't even try chasing after that. I can think of a few who would have cut that off"
that's poor bowling. Moved the fielder into the off side infield and Umesh bowls one on the hip. Mumbai and Parthiv help themselves to four down to fine leg
"shortish and wide outside off, dabbed down to third man"
"good length delivery outside off, dabbed away towards backward point. A good single. There probably shouldn't be one there"
"one more. KKR keeping themselves in this. Another mis-directed delivery. Short and very wide, right in Parthiv's wheelhouse. But maybe there was some extra bounce. Takes the outside edge of his cut and carries comfortably through to the keeper. Not quite the plan, I'm sure, for either party."
"fullish length outside off, nice finish. Defended into the off side"
"lovely start. Back of a length outside off, seaming back in. Pushed towards extra cover for a good single."
on the pads and Rohit whips him away for a couple to deep square leg. Nice timing. Leant on his flick
"141 kph, lovely shot. Back of a length outside off, punched to extra cover with a lovely high elbow"
"lovely timing again. A risky stroke on a surface with variable bounce. Back of a length on middle, pulled to deep square leg for a single. Good work by Piyush running to his left"
"back of a length outside off, chopped to third man with an angled bat"
"another good single. Slower ball outside off, tapped towards cover for one."
"91 kph, flat outside off, spinning back in. Skewed away towards cover"
"95 kph, on the pads, worked to deep square leg for a single. Hanging on the back foot, wanting to play it off the pitch"
"what was that? A dangerous leave. Wasn't even wide outside off. Flat outside off, spinning back in and Rayudu leaves. Just beats the stumps. A brainfade of sorts."
"flat and straight, offers the full face of the bat to defend this time"
"98 kph, quick and straight, nudged to square leg. Racking 'em dot balls together"
this is the carrom ball outside off. Punched to long-on for a single
"on the pads from Chawla, worked away towards midwicket. A direct throw from de Grandhomme to the bowler's end but all good."
"overpitched on middle, pushed to long-on"
"flat and wide outside off, nicely bowled. Pushed to cover from the back foot"
"phew, a gem of a delivery. Using his angle and his pace beautifully. A flattish delivery on off, Rayudu brings his bat down at a 45-degree angle, as opposed to a 60-70 degree angle. And so he doesn't get behind the line. The ball spins just enough to beat that awful angle and hit off stump. A little more spin would have spun past the off stump. But that slightly wider angle means the ball didn't turn square."
"on the pads, flicked through square leg for a couple"
"tossed up outside off, driven away towards cover. Lovely bowling from Piyush. Legspinners ruling the IPL."
"a fine paddle for a couple. Premeditated the sweep, got low and chipped a couple to fine leg. Well played"
"flat on leg, punched to long-on for a single. Again, staying on the back foot to read the ball off the pitch, affording himself a fraction of a second more"
"flat and slow on off, awkwardly blocked"
"the offbreak on middle and leg, played away to midwicket"
another fine paddle sweep for four. Knew there was no fine leg so got low and paddled the ball. Using the pace.
"on the pads, nudged away for a run"
"back of a length on off, pulled down to long-on. Clearly hurried for pace. Well bowled again"
"124 kph, slower ball outside off, cutting back in just enough. Tapped to point."
a tad too wide. Wide of the crease. Tapped to third man for a run
"good length outside off, Krunal runs at the bowler and shunts a drive past cover for a couple to the sweeper cover"
"not a bad delivery. Cramping him for room from around the wicket, nudged to square leg"
"good length outside off, clipped wide of midwicket for a single. Good finish from Coulter-Nile"
"superb timing from Rohit. Flat outside off, punched wide of cover for four. Sensational stroke. Just leaning on it."
"the googly from wide of the crease. Rohit didn't quite read that, just like the Simmons wicket. But Rohit gets a big thick inside edge on that to fine leg"
"another googly on middle, defended. 90 kph"
"flat down leg. Quite a bad ball. Drifts down leg, swept away down to the fine leg boundary. Just a bit of bat."
"short and wide outside off, punched to the sweeper cover from the back foot"
"runs at the bowler, hoping to get to the pitch if he didn't read the ball. The ball is short and on the pads, Rohit nudges to short fine leg"
"too short, too wide. Sits up for Rohit to thrash through deep point"
"full and straight, defended to cover"
good batting. Waits for the offbreak to come to him before deflecting a dab down to third man
"flat on off, spins back in. Rohit just gets bat down on that in time."
"on the pads, nudged away calmly with the spin to deep midwicket"
another offbreak outside off. Krunal is looking for another dab but this is too close to the stumps. He isn't in a very good position either. Chopped into the pad
a tossed up googly outside off. Punched to long-off
"lovely shot. A tossed up googly outside off, drilled down to long-off. Straight past his captain."
"just wide of a diving long-on. Excessively full again, overpitched. Krunal gets low and sweeps wide of Umesh at long-on. So full Krunal wasn't able to get underneath that"
"92 kph, fullish on off, pushed in front of point. Simple batting"
"97 kph, flat on off, defended"
"Rohit lights up the Chinnaswamy, silencing their chants when Mumbai is in town. Gets low and nails his lofted sweep waaaay over long-on. Sublime timing"
"flat and wide outside off, 95 kph. A fine, late cut past short third man for four. Lovely placement. These two putting on a show now"
"flat on off, a bit of spin. Defended"
"goes over cover this time. Tossed up on off, Krunal gets under the length and lifts the ball over cover. Just lovely, thinking batting"
"on the pads this time. Flat down leg, off the inside edge and the pad"
carved towards point from the crease
"well played. He's got enough from the over so can play him out. Flat on middle and leg, blocked to cover"
"back of a length outside off, chopped to point"
"picks out deep square leg. Back of a length on middle, Rohit runs at Coulter-Nile, who drags that length back. A bouncer. Can't get enough timing or power behind that stroke and picks out deep square leg. Unhappy that he didn't keep it down."
"fullish and wide, carved to the sweeper cover"
"full and wide, pacey. 141 kph. Left alone by Pollard"
worked away behind square for a couple more. Nicely waited. All too easy
"back of a length, short and wide. Pollard can't get bat on his attempted cut. An optimistic appeal is correctly shot down"
"on the pads, nudged to square leg for one"
"a naughty error from de Grandhomme. Back of a length on off, pulled down to deep square leg. Almost hits the umpire. But doesn't. And then goes through de Grandhomme's legs too"
drifts way down leg for an extra
worked down to fine leg.
"133 kph, back of a length outside off, carved away towards third man for a run. Great fielding from Umesh, diving away to his right"
an extremely wide slower ball doesn't land on the pitch outside Pollard's reach. Outside off
"136 kph, a full toss on middle and leg, Pollard misses plenty of runs. Off the inside edge towards square leg"
"Krunal grimaces after hammering a drive. Full and wide outside off, drilled past mid-off for four. Immediately holds his groin, hamstring area. Fantastic area to hit the ball"
"138 kph, may have been close to a wide for the left-hander. Well down leg"
"a yorker on off, dabbed to point for a single."
"a low full toss on off, shovelled to midwicket. No feet"
"dropped and goes to the boundary. Short on off, Krunal backs away and carves the ball to third man. The fielder gets across but can only get a hand on his attempted catch. Too tough to call that an opportunity. Rolls away into the boundary and <b>Mumbai go through to the final</b>"
