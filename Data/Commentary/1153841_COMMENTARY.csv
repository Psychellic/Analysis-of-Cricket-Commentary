"length ball on leg stump, easily tapped to midwicket to get off the mark"
"good length, well outside off and he lets it go through"
"good length and gets it closer to the stumps, prompting Munro to go for the cut. Only under-edges it, and the ball rolls back to the bowler's right"
"slower ball, 110 kph, good length and on the stumps. Munro waits for it and taps it into the leg side for a quick single"
"strays on the pads again, and Guptill is able to put it away easily to midwicket"
"fuller outside off, driven firmly to mid-off. He calls for the run and they make it safely"
"<b>lovely shot</b> very full and on the stumps, he straight drives it past the bowler and into the boundary. Didn't have an exaggerated follow through, but didn't need one, the timing was so good"
fullish on the pads and flicked to deep midwicket
"a bit short and those powerful forearms of Munro come into play. A short-arm jab-pull from middle stump, sends it over the in-field and into the midwicket fence"
"<b>crashed</b> Pradeep adjusts his line to outside off, but still stays on the fuller side. No difference though, as Munro crashes it powerfully through cover for another boundary"
"pulls his length back but stays outside off and Munro punches with authority, but cover dives and prevents it from going past the in-field. This outfield is quick, so once the ball is through, there is little chance of stopping it"
"clipped wide of mid-on from the pads, but another diving save means the batsmen are kept to one run"
"good length on off stump, defended towards point"
"good length on the stumps, and Guptill pats it back from the crease to the bowler's left"
"strays on the pads again - he's been doing that a fair bit already, has Malinga - and Guptill is happy to pick him off to deep square leg"
"back of a length on the stumps, defended towards silly point with an open face. No one close in so they take the quick single"
"on the pads again, and Guptill turns this finer. Short fine leg is there however, and he moves to his left to field"
"slower ball again, just 111.2 clicks, full on off stump. He was a little early into the drive and it goes to mid-off from the toe-end"
"too straight and flicked nicely, but Thisara at mid-on puts in a good fielding effort again, tumbling to his right"
"length ball, angling into the left-hander from around the wicket, tucked to square leg"
"good length ball, on the stumps, tucked to deep square leg"
"good length on the stumps, he moves a bit across to clip it towards a wide long-on"
"<b>rapped on the pads and a big appeal</b> But they're not going for the review. Good piece of bowling, length ball jagging back in, defeats Guptill's intended airy flick. But perhaps that was going down leg? And great decision by Malinga to not review, because replays show that was missing leg. It certainly appeared a close shout at first sight"
"fuller outside off, driven past cover"
"first yorker from Malinga. Full and swinging in, defended off his toes"
"length ball on the stumps, another slower one - he's almost bowling 3-4 of those per over - and Munro waits for it and guides it to midwicket"

"back of a length on off stump again, defended towards cover-point"

"<b>got 'im</b> huge wicket, Guptill was looking solid and was coming off a century in the last match. Good length ball that moved away after pitching. Got his line perfect though, in the channel outside off. Guptill was tempted into driving on the up, but the movement and slightly higher bounce meant it caught a healthy edge and was pouched by the keeper"
"too short, angling into the left-hander and he isn't going to be cowed down by the lost wicket. Pulls it powerfully to deep midwicket, over the in-field"
"full ball outside off, Williamson comes on the front foot to defend"
"back of a length outside off, Williamson stands tall and punches. Gunathilaka at point dives but mis-fields, allowing them to pinch a single"
"too full on off and he brings out the straight drive again, but a diving stop at mid-on prevents the ball from racing away to the boundary"
"good length outside off, Williamson punches it to the bowler's left"
"full ball on off stump, driven back, but the bowler fields"
"<b>beauty</b> the speed gun shows that as 138 clicks, but it was almost like a fast spinner. Off-cutter, pitched on the left-hander's leg stump and broke away to snake past the outside edge, with Munro left feeling for it"
"back of a length on off, steered to point"
"slower ball now, full and on middle stump, Munro is too early into the drive. Mis-times it along the ground to mid-off"
"back of a length on leg stump, he stays inside the line and tucks it to fine leg"
"back of a length and on the stumps, again some movement away, but it's too short to trouble Williamson, who defends to point from his crease"

"back of a length outside off, he goes on his toes to steer it past point"
"fuller on off, punched back to mid-off"
"full outside off again, Williamson comes forward and drives, but straight to cover"
"<b>caught at fine leg with some fancy footwork</b> Short ball on the stumps, Williamson goes on the back foot to pull, but gets a top edge that swirls to fine leg. Sandakan is there and moves back to catch it, but the momentum is taking him over the rope. Throws the ball up in the air, steps over the boundary, comes back in and holds the ball. The kind of catch that is easily done nowadays, but still looks special when it comes off. Sri Lanka right on top now"

"good length, angling into him, and tucked to square leg"
"good length on the stumps, another slower ball. He waits for it and defends it back to the bowler"
"<b>smart shot</b> Malinga went for the wide yorker outside off, Munro gets low and cuts it late past the in-field and to the fence"

"short ball angling into him, ends up on leg stump. Munro moves inside the line and pulls it to fine leg"
"floated up full outside off, and Munro threw his bat at it, and sends it to the third man boundary. Too much room outside off and gave Munro the chance to free his arms"
"gets it closer to off stump that time, and Munro takes a step forward to drive to mid-off"
"tossed up on leg stump, but Taylor goes down and paddles it fine. A bit of  fumble by the man giving chase at the fine leg fence, but while the ball doesn't cross the boundary, they get three runs"

"fuller on the stumps, driven to mid-off"
clipped into the leg side
"tossed up on leg stump, back of a length, he moves across and flicks to fine leg. The umpire signalled no-ball initially, thinking there was one fielder less inside the circle. But it's not a no-ball, and he takes the call back"

"length on off stump, blocked on the front foot"
"<b>dropped at long-on!</b> Chandimal completely messes this up! A mis-hit from Munro, as he looks to pump a full ball straight over the bowler. Comes off the inside of the bat. Chandimal runs in, figures out he's overdone it, and as he looks to adjust, the wind brings the ball down quicker than he anticipates. In the end, he's just flailing to his right"

"<b>oh that looks like the end for Munro!</b> A terrible mix-up. Length ball dropped in  front of point with soft hands. Munro has hared towards the other end but Taylor is ball watching and says no after a couple of steps down. Backward point swoops down on it and sends a throw on the bounce to Sandakan. It's wide, but the bowler lunges to his left to collect it and then flicks it onto the stumps. Third umpire replay shows Munro was well short. A terrible, terrible end for him. Looked in for a big score"

stunning. Someone must investigate why this guy averages only 27. Short of a length and rising up at him outside off. He springs up to get beside the bounce and opens the face at the perfect moment to get this racing into the boundary to third man's right. High elbow and all
"short ball at the stumps, left alone"
"length on middle stump, tucked to mid-on off the front foot"

"too short, too wide outside off and crashed through point for four"
"better length outside off, he dabs it in front and wants to take a single. Loud call of 'NO' by Mendis sends him back. Wisely enough because point was swooping in and had a shy at the stumps"
"too wide outside off again, and he throws his bat at it, carves it over point. Southee at third man covers good ground to slide and stop the ball from going into the fence"

"too full and enough width outside off to get the cover drive flowing, but he has protection in the deep with a sweeper"
full outside off and driven to the man at deep point by opening the face of the bat
"<b>oh Mendis will be filthy with himself</b> this was drifting down leg, a bit short, and turned a bit. Mendis moved inside the line to paddle-sweep it, but only managed to pop it to Seifert off his bottom edge. The New Zealanders are gleeful, and why not. They've broken yet another partnership before it could go from promising to threatening"
"tossed up and a touch too full, but Chandimal is new to the crease so he defends carefully"
"given some air again, on middle stumps, blocked to midwicket"
"gets some drift again, and beats his sweep. Was the googly, so turned the other way, flicked pad and went to fine leg. Sodhi appealed for an lbw, but that was probably missing leg"

"back of a length outside off, and nudged to short third man"
"pitches on middle and moving into the batsman, flicked off his pads to midwicket"
"good length outside off, he checks his drive, as the ball bounces to cover"
"<b>high up in the air and taken by the keeper near backward point</b> Down the track came Gunathilaka and had an almighty swipe at it, only got it off the end of the bat and sent it steepling behind him. Seifert called for it early and settled under it nicely. Neesham continues to be an insurmountable obstacle for Sri Lanka - with bat or ball"
"length ball, coming in slightly from middle stump, he goes back and flicks it to deep square leg"
loses his line to go down leg side. Not very far from leg stump but those are all called 'wide' in limited-overs cricket
"back of a length outside off, he comes close to the ball and steers it to backward point"
"loud shout for lbw and that seemed mighty close. Didn't pick the googly at all. and it spins past his forward prod to hit him on the pads. Not given. And we can see why on the replay, the thinnest of edges there"
outside off but swept hard and with good timing to deep square leg
"that is a wide down leg but not a bad ball at all. Tossed up and dipping on the batsman, who is drawn outside his crease and disbalanced. Googly. Seifert collects it down leg"
stays in his crease to punch this to long-on
that one skidded on quicker and he had to bring his bat down hurriedly to jab it away
"another wrong 'un, pushed towards cover"
"he's not been reading the googly and it's done him in. A little short, Chandimal cleared his front leg, probably intending to crash it through the off side, but it spins back in, under flailing bat, and hits the stumps. Sri Lanka's hole gets deeper"
"fullish length outside off, he comes forward and drives to cover"
"<b>top edge goes to fine leg for a boundary</b> digs this in short, and he moved inside the line to pull it. Got a top edge, but had the placement right, with no fielder at fine leg"
"too straight, angling into the stumps from wide of the crease, and turned to fine leg"
"gets the bouncer right that time, in line with the batsman, who ducks under it"
"angled across him, drives it from off stump towards mid-off"
"short ball, angling away and ends up outside off, he rises on his toes to slash it from close to his body over point. No fielder at deep point so it was a safe shot"
"tried to work it away from leg stump, but couldn't connect well enough"
"gets his line slightly off, and bowls this down leg. Wide"
"<b>that's a suicidal run and another one falls</b> Neesham the fielder at short third man, who else can it be? Nice bowling by Sodhi, tossed up on a perfect length and dipping. Breaks after pitching on leg, and Thisara tries to turn it fine. Looks up to see Gunaratne charging down and responds, but Neesham picks up and throws it to Seifert in one swift motion, catching him well short"
"tossed up nicely again, he takes a tentative step forward and a tentative jab to mid-on"
"tossed up again, and defended more solidly outside off"
"another one on a good length on off, and he comes forward to defend to point"
"<b>Sodhi's on fire</b> wild slog from Seekkuge, who didn't read the wrong un. Stood in his crease and tried to lift this over the infield. Gets an inside edge that crashes into the stumps. This is ending quickly"
"short outside off, he cuts it uppishly over point. They run two, but Malinga was very casual in getting back. Direct hit would have had him"
""
"attempted yorker results in a low full toss, and Thisara gets a measure of revenge, flicking it to deep midwicket off Neesham"
"back of a length, moving across thisara, who tucks it into the leg side. There is a run there, but Malinga seems disinterested. Goes through but doesn't even ground his bat, and doesn't seem to want to hurry into the crease either!"
"bouncer, well directed, and Malinga ducks under it"
"slower ball, leg-cutter outside off. Comprehensively beats the batsman. Malinga plays away from the body with legs rooted, misses the intended push altogether"
"lovely flight and dip again, Thisara comes forward to defend, the ball rolls to the bowler off the outside edge"
"given some air on leg stump again, he wants to give himself room but ends up defending close to his body"
drags it a mite short and Thisara does his 'stand and deliver' thingy. Googly spinning away so he frees his arms and crashes it past extra cover
"tossed up on leg stump again, and he comes on the front foot to defend, using pads as second line of defence"
"leg-break pitches on middle on a good length and spinning back into Thisara, who cuts from close to his body but straight to cover"
"tossed up on leg stump but too full, and he's able to turn it away to fine leg"
nicely picked up from his legs to the deep midwicket boundary. A touch too full on leg stump and Thisara latches on
"the bowler corrects his line to go outside off, and Thisara says, 'I can hit you there too'. Comes on the front foot to drive over mid-off and into the long-off fence"
"good length on the stumps, he shuffles and clips to midwicket"
"edged, but falls short of the keeper. wide outside off, Malinga's feet never moved, but he tried to slash it well away from body. Gets the edge"
"bouncer, but going well over so Malinga can duck under it easily"
"another bouncer, better directed them, but Malinga still ducks under it"
"googly again, a touch too full, he stays in his crease and punches it past cover"
good length outside off and spinning away. Malinga comes forward but lets it go through
"tossed up and gets some drift so it ends up on middle stump. Malinga unfurls a picture perfect sweep, connects cleanly and sends it to the square leg boundary"
"big appeal for lbw and they've gone for the review after it was given not out. another googly, that pitches on the perfect length, draws him forward and spins past the defensive prod of the bat to hit pad. No bat involved says Snicko, so this might be very tight for Malinga. Hit him in front of middle I reckon, so it might be going down. And wait - what';s this - there is no ball tracking available! so the decision stays. That's quite incredible. New Zealand won't lose a review, because the system failed."
"too short and too wide outside off, Malinga nails the cut past point. Fielders sprinting after it pull it back in before it hits the ropes"
"ooh that leg break turned. Malinga was stuck on the back foot and his bat hung limply out, takes the edge and goes past slip"
"outside off, pushed to cover."
"<b>smashed</b> too short and he stays still, swivels and connects hard and clean, sending it flat over square leg"
"low full toss, driven powerfully, but straight to cover"
"and that's flat-batted over mid-off for four. Stand and deliver again from Thisara. Too short, too wide, and a misdirected slower ball that's had the cover smashed off it"
"fuller ball on the stumps, driven to deep extra cover"
"back of a length, gets it to bounce from outside off and into the rib cage, Malinga keeps it out"
"Thisara has taken plenty of punishment, he's dishing it out now. Down the track and hits the full ball straight and true back over the bowler's head"
"he was waiting for the over-compensated short ball, rocks on the back foot and pulls powerfully over the midwicket boundary"
"down the track again, but not timed as well, hits it over the bowler for a couple"
"wrong un', and he stays in his crease, and clears his leg to crash it to the extra cover fence from off stump. <b>Fifty</b> for Thisara"
"quicker and flatter on the stumps, jabbed into the off side"
doesn't get hold of this and it swirls high in the air but lands safely over extra cover
"angling into him from around the wicket, and Malinga just stays in his crease and pokes at it. Inside edges it onto pad"
"angled in again, Malinga was backing away but the ball follows him. Defends it back to the bowler"
"backs away again, but this time Boult keeps it outside off. Malinga connects with the slap, and they jog through for a single to get Thisara back on strike"
"full ball, almost in the block hole, driven to long-off"
"<b>dropped by Colin Munro at deep square leg</b> well directed bouncer, Malinga was trying to get out of the way while swatting it. Sends it in the air to square leg. Munro is running in and gets to the ball comfortably, but incredibly enough - spills it. New Zealand have just gone slightly ragged since that DRS failure, with Thisara taking charge post that."

"<b>dropped!</b> Williamson at long-off lets it through and it's six! Highest score for Perera too. That was the match for New Zealand. Full ball at off stump, drills it off the low part of the bat so there isn't elevation on this. Williamson gets under it and times his jump well too at head height. But can't get his fingers behind it"

"<b>another full toss! Another six!</b> How the tables have turned! New Zealand have no clue where to bowl to him. Outside off, in his zone and he slots it over long-on again!"
<b>now way!</b> Southee has lost his length completely. Another full toss. Just outside off. A half-step into into the off side and a launch over square leg this time. Unreal stuff.
"<b>well bowled.</b> Thisara shuffles and Southee sends a bouncer across the channel, straight at his helmet. Ducks under it"
<b>they'll get three!</b> The point fielder tracks back as this trickles towards the boundary and pulls it back in. Pradeep and Sri Lanka will be grateful for that. Munro there. Full and in at off stump. Backs away and slices a gorgeous drive to beat the diving cover fielder to his left
<b>bouncer.</b> Wide! Henry not happy with that. A sharp bouncer. Perera backed away and it was too fast for him. Replays show it was the right call
"<b>Boult leaps forward and ends the pain at long-on!</b> What a catch! Not quite, for Thisara Perera. It was in the slot, length ball on leg stump. Short-arm jab again but this time it's off the toe-end. It dips on Boult who sprints some ten yards and pulls off a stunner. After five dropped catches, it took some compensation"
