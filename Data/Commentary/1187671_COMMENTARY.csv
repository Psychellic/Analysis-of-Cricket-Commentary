"sprayed almost off the cut strip, Dharmasena calls this one"
"slapped hard over point, <b>picks out Santner on the rope!</b> Buttler's handy rearguard ends with an overhit swat, trying to cash in on a short, wide delivery.

"banged in, Broad hangs back and jabs it down"
"oof,<b> that's a feisty bumper</b>, 134kph/83mph but right at the head, Broad takes a blow on the fingers jabbing it away"
"more well-directed short stuff, again Broad puts his dukes up and takes it on the gloves, could have gone anywhere, that"
"back of a length, tapped down into the leg side"
"dragged on, <b>Wagner finishes things!</b> Pinned back by a series of bouncers, Broad is then unable to get far enough forward to a full one, and ends up deflecting a thick inside edge into his stumps"

"fullish, straight, struck on the pad, <strong>big shout... and given!</strong> Root's early bowling change pays off. No massive swing, maybe a bit of nibble, two noises as it strikes the pad but he decides not to review. And oh, is that a mark on HotSpot? Drama! Hmm, tough to work it out even after a couple of replays. I think the bat hit the pad, then the ball hit the pad, then the ball hit the inside edge... maybe. So a good decision... I <i>think</i>"

"short again, and defended just in front of short leg"
"fired down the leg side, <strong>88mph/142kph</strong> and left alone"

"back-of-a-length ball, dropped out into the off side and they pinch a single"
"fullish and straight, Nicholls looks to work it into the leg side, half-hearted appeal and given not out. Sounded like two noises, and might have pitched outside, but England <b>review</b>. I'm surprised by that. Yeah, HotSpot reveals he smashed it into the pad, and that's a waste. Hang on, Dharmasena is on screen and confirms the decision, but now we're back looking at RTS. And again, it's clear he smashed it, so Paul Wilson <i>eventually</i> concludes that it's not out. Bizarre!"

"over the wicket to Watling, who defends a ball angled in on the stumps"
"touch shorter, tucked off the body towards midwicket"
"ooh, pace off and then swerving down the leg side, beats everyone for four byes. Maybe an attempted knuckleball that didn't come out right, left Buttler sprawling in the dirt"

"short of a length, 140kph/87mph and whistling through outside off as Watling drops the hands"

"floated up on off stump, Nicholls continues to be proactive with the sweep, gets it through backward square for a couple more"
"stays low, trapped in front! Dharmasena thought for a moment before raising his finger, but Nicholls <b>reviews</b>... this could be close, looked <i>just about</i> in line, but we'll need Hawk-Eye to be sure. No, DRS to the rescue, <b>outside the line of off stump!</b> So Kumar has to reverse his decision and Nicholls can continue"
"sweeps again, gets it away past leg slip for one... or make that a couple, as Archer misfields running in from the deep, then hurls the ball high above Buttler's head as Nicholls hares back"
"starts with a wide long hop, <b>crunched through point for four!</b> That's a freebie"
"<b>dropped!</b> Stokes shells a dolly, would you believe it? Tossed up, draws the edge on the drive, should be a simple take at slip... <b>but Stokes butchers it</b>, snapping at the chance and it comes off the fingertips"
worked off the pads for one
"sliding on with the arm, past the inside edge - <b>that's lbw!</b> No debate about this one, as Bruce Oxenford raises his finger and Nicholls elects to take his medicine. Looked like it would have cannoned into leg stump, done by the lack of spin, and England have their breakthrough"
