"oh, a run out. Bangladesh really didn't need this. A direct hit catches him well short of the crease. And it's Thisara Perera, Sri Lanka's golden boy this series. A length ball that's knocked to mid-off. He decides to take on the fielder there and as it turns out, it'll be the last thing he does this innings. Perera charges in, swoops down and has one stump to aim at"
