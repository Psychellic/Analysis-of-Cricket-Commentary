"what just happened? Williamson has bunted a catch to deep square leg. A good length delivery on middle and leg, Williamson, it seems, is caught in between a hoick and a flick, in between going after it with everything or just clipping it for one.

"<strong>Munro drops an easy one</strong>. Yikes, an absolute sitter is put down at square leg. Follows up an excellent bouncer with another well-directed short ball, pulled away with bad timing to Munro's right, he gets across but the ball just hits the thumb and ricochets away. His hands were in a terrible position"
"full on middle and leg, defended"
"good run. Full delivery outside off, pushed to mid-off for a single. Nice, early call"

"137 kph, on the pads, nudged down to fine leg"
"another good single. Short on middle and leg, clipped to square leg"
"goes short again does Southee, another bouncer. Zaman lets the ball come to him and then pulls through backward square leg. Rolled his wrists on the ball"

"well bowled, generating good pace, 141 kph, full on middle and leg, swings back in late, a thick inside edge to square leg"
"edged and taken this time. 142 kph, full delivery outside off. Amin drives with his hands well way from the body, and the ball hardly moves. Finds the outside edge and carries low to Taylor at wide slip, straight inside. Quality catch. Henry's extra pace meant Amin's feet weren't where it should have been"
"excellent start to Azam, full and straight, driven away to mid-on"
"good length delivery outside off, beaten on the outside edge"

"136 kph, excellent bowling, goes fuller outside off, not much movement, left alone"

"shortish and a tad wide outside off, punched away to backward point"
"full delivery outside off, coming back in, played towards point"
"Henry strikes again, and Pakistan's struggles continue. It was full outside off, Zaman clears his front leg, his back foot moves nowhere. All he does is chip a catch to mid-off. That's a terrible stroke, not sure what he was trying to do, go over cover or hit it along the ground."
"a wide yorker outside off, jammed down to third man"
"that's lovely from Azam. Let the ball come to him, on the pads, and he clipped it away through midwicket with nonchalant ease. Just seems like a shot practiced over and over. He'll put it away more than 85% of the time"

"a low full toss, follows Haris, worked to midwicket"
"that increasing asking rate has resulted in a wicket. Nicely tossed up from Santner, down leg, 77 kph after a 96 kph first delivery. Haris comes down, but is deceived by that lack of pace as he tries to loft the ball straight.

"is that the game? It's another lovely display of defensive, but attacking spin bowling. He knows Shadab is going to come so he tosses it up, but wide outside off. Shadab runs down, looking to hit the ball over cover. Instead, it skews off the outside half to short third man. Just like how de Grandhomme got out to Chahal in the second ODI in Pune last year. It's a defensive attacking option, oxymoron-ish as it may be"

"Southee takes a good catch and Ashraf goes. Santner atypically tosses this one up. Sees an opportunity, maybe a bit too eager as he swings and all Ashraf can do is get a thick leading edge on his slog sweep.

"132 kph, a low full toss is jammed out to square leg. Just the one this time"

"another straight yorker, kept out somehow."
<b>another thick inside edge</b> to the fine leg boundary. How has he found just that little gap through the stumps and his body? A wild swing off a full delivery results in another boundary

"a short slower ball down leg, Raees misses a hoick, struck on the body and lobs towards the keeper. Gets much tougher now"

A short slower delivery outside off, Raees swats it away towards midwicket, who keeps his eyes on the ball and takes a reverse-cupped catch. <b>New Zealand complete a 5-0 sweep in the ODIs</b>"
