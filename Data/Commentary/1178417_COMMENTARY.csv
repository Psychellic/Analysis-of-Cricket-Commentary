"full and outside off, slices it to cover"
"a hint of width - only a hint - and Parthiv lashes it behind point with some gusto. The front-foot, on-the-up square drive in all its glory"
hammers it down the ground now! Licence to thrill! Or at least licence to swat balls in the slot outside off stump back over mid-off's head
"corrects his line now, targeting middle and leg, Parthiv goes for the flick, misses the shot and so has to settle for a leg bye"
"drills it to the left of point, leaning forward to the good length ball outside off, making sure his balance is going into the shot so he can control it better"
nudges a length ball on off stump to the right of midwicket
"<b>dropped at midwicket!</b> That was the break Kings XI needed, but Hardus has fluffed a simple chance at midwicket inside the circle. Kohli clipped a full one off the pads, but uppishly and almost straight to him. But it was straight in, and straight out"
"and this will sting after that missed chance! Shami adjusts his line, just outside off, but Kohli meets the ball with a scything slap that sends the ball skidding through cover point. That scorched across the outfield"
"<b>and again!</b> There was a hint of venom in the last stroke from Kohli, but this one is all class as he leans into a cover drive, on the up, and threads the gap between cover and mid off"
"swatted out through cover point again, but a man's been moved out into the deep in that position as damage control"
"Shami keeps his line straight to Parthiv, but it's too straight and it's neatly clipped down to fine leg for the <b>third four of the over</b>"
"Shami's trying not to give him any width, but he's sent his line too far the other way and this one scoots down the leg side"
"Parthiv misses a swat into the leg side, but the ball loops up off his hip and there's room enough for a quick single"
"Parthiv sets himself for a mow into the leg side, but he's not got the room he's looking for and the ball is mis-timed to mid on"
"<b>picked up over deep backward square!</b> The line, headed towards leg stump, is helpful, and Parthiv helps it on its way with a little flourish, lifting his right leg in the air"
"massive swooshing drive from the batsman outside off, and he hits only fresh air. But it's a no-ball! <b>Free hit coming up</b>"
"another huge swipe from Parthiv, another play-and-miss, but it's <b>also another no ball</b>. Try again"
"a full, angled delivery ricochets off the inside edge and crashes into the stumps, and they pinch a single as it rolls to fine leg"
"Rajpoot pulls his length back a shade, Kohli hopping into a nurdle to leg"
"and he switches back around the stumps for the left-hander, pitching it right up to him, Parthiv digging it out through gully"
"nice change-up, a slower ball at 112km/h, and it has the beating of a Parthiv drive"
"<b>and gets his man!</b> A full house has been silenced as Kohli slices a drive uppishly into the covers, where this time the fielder - Mandeep - makes no mistake"
"<b>and he's almost done first ball!</b> Shami tests AB on an offstump line with one that nips in to him, the ball coming off the inside half of the bat and bouncing just past the stumps"
"fuller, wider and de Villiers won't be tempted into anything injudicious outside off just yet"
"short, and rising outside off at just over 140km/h. De Villiers is slightly rushed into a pull, but rolls his wrists on the shot to control it and collect a single"
"<b>edged</b>, but it's wide of slip and bounces harmlessly down to third man. Shami's found some wobble, and a testing length"
"Shami continues to probe outside off, de Villiers poking at one that snakes in to him, an inside edge bouncing off his pads and into space for a run"
"on a length, just outside off, and de Villiers pushes on the up to cover"
"<b>pulled by de Villiers</b>, though it's the line rather than the length that invited the shot. It really wasn't all that short, but the ball was drifting towards his legs and de Villiers threads the gap between midwicket and mid on with a firm pull"
"<b>misfield</b>, and it brings runs! Two fielders converged on de Villiers' drive to cover, but neither could stop it. The ball is eventually hunted down near the rope"
"<b>slammed down the ground!</b> Parthiv's eyes light up as he picks a full slower ball out of the hand, clearing his front leg and cracking it 77 metres straight back over his head to <b>bring up the fifty</b>"
"Rajpoot puts a little more vim into this one, pulling his length back to <b>beat Parthiv's edge</b> as he has a little fiddle at a rising delivery outside off"
"and he concludes the over with a yorker, right up at his toes, that's dug out through backward point"
"<b>up and over mid off!</b> Parthiv swings from a solid base at the crease, punting a full ball cleanly over mid off"
"<b>sliced behind point this time!</b> Shami lets slip with a full toss outside off, Parthiv slicing it deliberately fine to get it behind point - albeit aerially - for another boundary. He's inquisitive about a possible no-ball, but it's legitimate"
"smeared across the line, but he loses his shape over-hitting it and the ball goes nowhere"
"<b>width again!</b> And it's a slower one, too. He spots it early, plants his right foot, and doesn't bother keeping it down as he scythes over cover"
"<b>fetched over cow corner!</b> Parthiv is going like a freight train. Shami aimed this one straighter, but the batsman was expecting it and clubbed confidently up and over the legside field. This is a cracker of a pitch"
"shorter, outside off, and it's dabbed down to gully"
"legbreak, and it's slapped out to the cover sweeper to turn the strike over"
"<b>vital breakthrough!</b> Parthiv can barely drag himself from the crease. He plays across the line at a floaty googly, and a leading edge loops very tamely to his captain at cover. Parthiv looks suspiciously at the pitch as he trudges off, but this dismissal was down to good bowling and a loose stroke"
"streaky start from Moeen, flashing outside off and sending an edge bouncing down to the third man boundary"
"googly this time, and it's not picked, zipping past the outside edge"
"legbreak at 94km/h, and it's pressed defensively to cover"
"chopped down to point, where the fielder is in place"
"quick, skidding on outside off, and AB tucks it back to the bowler"
"Ashwin offers up a hint of width, but there's protection at cover sweeper"
"<b>bowled him!</b> Moeen stayed deep in the crease, waiting and playing for orthodox turn, but the ball rushes on to him with the arm, skidding through a little low and slamming into the stumps. And that's that for Moeen and IPL 2019 - he's back to England now"
"looped down with precious little flight, and tight on off stump to draw hurried defence from the new bat"
<b>beaten on the outside edge!</b> Akshdeep plays for turn and the ball scoots <i>just</i> past his outside edge
"worked into the leg side, and into space for a single"
worked off a length and into the leg side
AB waits and waits and chops down at the last moment to collect a single to third man
"Akshdeep steps into a crunchy little drive, picking out the cover sweeper"
"AB lets his bottom hand do the work, digging an attempted yorker out just wide of mid off"
"dug in short and outside off by Viljoen, Akshdeep failing to lay any bat on his attempted pull"
<b>tapped tamely to cover!</b> Akshdeep was much too early into this push to cover as Viljoen rolled his fingers over a 134km/h cutter. The ball ballooned off the bat and presented Mandeep with the very simplest of chances
"pushed out through the gap at cover point, just the one"
"full, straight, and Stoinis presents the full face of the bat to push the ball cautiously back at the bowler"
"flicked off the toes, but straight to short midwicket"
"Ashwin pulls his length back just a shade, Stoinis pressing to cover"
"another push into the covers, but this one is placed well enough for a quick single"
"chopped out to the sweeper once again, and AB keeps the strike"
"looped up on off stump, AB driving down to long off for a single"
"Stoinis follows AB's lead, helping himself to a single to long off"
"tucked straight of midwicket, just the one"
"Stoinis telegraphs his intentions to play a lap-sweep, but Ashwin adjusts to beat the stroke and hit him on the pad"
"legbreak, and it's nudged out to the cover sweeper"
"AB finds a gap on the off side, and keeps the strike"
"AB plucks the ball off an off stump line, glancing into the leg side for a single"
a watchful push finds extra cover
"Ashwin offers some width, Stoinis slashes a single to the sweeper"
"chopped down through gully, and they pinch a single as short third man scoots around"
"Stoinis works a flat dart from Ashwin into the leg side, long on keeping them to one"
"offbreak at 95km/h, AB nudging with the spin and square of midwicket for one more"
"another cutter, the speedo nudging towards 130km/h, and AB pokes at it from the crease"
"fuller, straighter, and it's flicked to Gayle at midwicket, eliciting a cheer from the crowd"
"Stoinis misses a glance at a 142km/h delivery, but they find a single into the leg side off his pad"
"dug in short, but misdirected down the leg side. The punishment isn't too severe though, de Villiers pulling to the fielder at deep backward square"
"Viljoen keeps things tight on off stump, Stoinis coming half forward to defend"
"nicely placed by Stoinis, into the acres of space on the leg side with midwicket on the fence. In fact, there's even time enough for them to rush back for a second"
"<b>was this an edge?</b> Yes! This is a delightful delivery from Ashwin, gripping and spinning across de Villiers, who pokes at it and sends an edge flying past the keeper. Slip would have gobbled it up, and <b>that's the hundred</b>"
"chopped hard into the covers, where a diving stop saves runs"
"nudged into a gap on the off side, and there's space for a quick single"
"very full, just outside off, and it's thumped through cover with plenty of bottom hand"
"<b>this will help!</b> Very full from Ashwin, too full in fact, and Stoinis' eyes light up. He sends the long half volley arcing back over the bowler's head, and into the first tier of the stands"
"flatter, straighter, and Stoinis finds a quick single to short fine leg"
""
"<b>flayed in front of square!</b> This wasn't all that short, but de Villiers is camped on the back foot and waiting for it to collect his second boundary"
"<b>they might need another ball now!</b> Rajpoot persists with the back-of-a-length stuff, and de Villiers rocks back into a fiery pull, sending the ball way into the stands beyond midwicket"
"slower ball at just under 116km/h, and the only damage is a single out to the sweeper"
"another slow cutter, this one at around 109km/h, and there's a big cheer from the crowd as Gayle fields a gentle push off the pads at square leg"
"<b>nicely bowled</b>. He's under pressure, but he's responded well to bring this over back, ending it with a pinpoint yorker that de Villiers can do nothing with"
"legbreak, and Stoinis pokes defensively at it from the crease"
"pushed down to long on, just the one - but importantly he hands the strike over"
"nicely flicked by de Villiers, behind square on the leg side, and Gayle is the fielder at short fine so they're easily back for a second"
<b>into the terraces!</b> De Villiers rocks back to slam a long-hop powerfully over wide midwicket. And that also <b>brings up the fifty partnership</b>
"nice come-back from the bowler, getting the ball right up to him. De Villiers can't get anything under the ball, instead driving to long off"
"punched to cover, and they chance a quick single"
flicked with the spin into the leg side to turn the strike over
"AB sets himself and slashes from the crease, looking to slice the ball to the left of the cover sweeper, but he can't get it past him"
"this looked like another carrom ball, but Stoinis spots it and times his slashed cut out to the cover sweeper"
"well bowled, floated up but dipping into the blockhole to keep Stoinis quiet"
"flapped down to long on, just the one"
"de Villiers turns himself around into a reverse-slog-sweep, but the ball fizzes past him as he misses the shot"
"Stoinis swings across the line, but he can't get under it and it's just the one to long on"
"<b>yorker goes awry</b>, Hardus losing his line and sending the ball down the leg side. AB just needs to get bat on ball, and he does so to <b>bring up his fifty</b>"
"<b>that forecast might keep going up!</b> De Villiers has absolutely monstered this straight back over the bowler's head. It was a long half volley, but he leathered it with awesome power. And they'll need another ball brought out. For real this time"
"flung much too far outside off, and he'll have to bowl it again"
"oh dear, that's slipped out way too wide and he'll have to try again"
"that's much better, Hardus finding his radar with a yorker on middle and off that's dug out to long on"
"Stoinis looks to go big on the leg side, but he hits only fresh air"
"full, wide and Stoinis squeezes it out behind point, hurrying back for a second"
"just short of a length, outside off, and AB misses his slash but they pinch a bye"
"well bowled by Shami, who changes it up with a slower bouncer that Stoinis can't lay bat on. Again they pinch a bye"
"<b>sliced over long off!</b> How has this gone so far? It looked like de Villiers had sliced under this one, but it just kept going and going and going"
"<b>and again!</b> Same ball, same shot, same result. If anything, he hit this one even better. It didn't go as high, but travelled further"
"<b>three in a row!</b> This has flown clean out of the park, but it was nothing more than a wild fend from AB as Shami let slip with a high full toss. AB was actually turning his head away to take evasive action as the ball got to him, but somehow the ball finds the middle of the bat and exits the stadium. AB reckons that might have been above waist height, but the umpire disagrees"
"another massive swipe, but this time the ball beats the bat and pings off his thigh into the off side"
"<b>another one!</b> De Villiers brings up the 100 stand with his seventh six, Hardus feeding him a full straight one and AB hammering it over wide long on"
"flapped into the leg side, just the one"
"<b>paddled to deep backward square</b>, Stoinis getting a healthy piece of bat on a full toss from Hardus that was anyway headed down the leg side"
"<b>Stoinis joins the party!</b> It's a cutter from Viljoen, but it lands in the slot and Stoinis hammers it over long on"
"<b>the runs keep flowing</b>, Hardus gifting Stoinis a full toss on leg stump. He gets a touch on it, and the pace takes it to the boundary"
<b>and a six to finish the innings!</b> The stadium erupts as Stoinis laces a length delivery up and over the leg side to raise the 200
"a gentle little nudge off his pads into the midwicket region. Southee searches for some swing, angling it in and getting the ball to straighten just enough"
"yorker first up to Gayle, who brings the bat down in time and turns it away from middle stump and into midwicket"
plays keep-away with the ball but it slides a little too far outside the off stump for him to win
"crashes it over point! And languidly at that! It's the equivalent of him waking up and yawning at the sun. Seriously. A length ball allowing him to free the arms? Bad move, Southee"
that's better. Hits the deck. Cramps him up with his line. Gayle still tries to launch it down the ground but he comes up with nothing
"he's squared up by the ball angling across him, short of a length, but he adjusts just about well enough to slice the ball past the left of short third man"
"opens the face and carves the full and wide delivery over point. Great start from Gayle. Jeez, don't you usually block the first over out?"
back of a length and sliding down the leg side. Rahul leaves and the extras tick over
that's awesome! He doesn't really have the length or the line to pull the ball - it's actually cramping him and the ball doesn't really rise as much as he'd like - but Rahul holds his shape beautifully and just helps it away to the long leg boundary with a little short-arm pull
"length, angling down the leg side, with a little ribbon tied around it. Rahul accepts the glorious gift with a flick to the long leg boundary again"
"good length, outside off, defends"
nudges the shortish delivery on middle to midwicket
looks for the glamour shot over extra cover - and he does play it well - but Umesh's length ball gets just enough nip away off the deck to beat Rahul's blade
"tries to beat point to his left, but the substitute Klaasen isn't so easily beaten and Umesh gets a way with a short and wide one"
<B>bang!</b> The boss is in! And he shows the young tyke what's what by clearing the front leg and drumming a short ball to the straight boundary. O-u-c-h!
<B>good bowling</b>! Saini doesn't get sucked in by his own ego and goes for the slower ball - he does dig it into the wicket though - and Gayle is comfortably beaten on the pull shot
works it off his hips through square leg. There's a man patrolling that boundary
classical as carnatic music! Leans forward to an innocuous delivery outside the off stump and unceremoniously - but also beautifully - drives it through the covers
"<b>over the top</b>! He gets a delicious half-volley as reward for the last shot and tucks in with a loft over cover. Oh, this man is going to spoil batting fans for years to come."
"fullish on middle, Rahul is content to defend it"
dumps a horrible full toss over long-on. That's about the most merciful treatment anyone can dole out to a ball like that.
"<b>taken at long-on now</B> and de Villiers holds the pose, standing in front of his beloved RCB fans! Seriously, there's only like three inches between his boots and the boundary and he takes it so florgin coolly! Holds the ball and his hands aloft for a second or two for the photographers and then runs into the huddle. Lovely stuff from the RCB's greatest game-changer. And the ex-RCB game-changer leaves having mis-hit a short ball, the pull shot going up instead of long"
works the back of a length ball towards mid-on
"goes full, and a touch too straight, Rahul misses the flick"
"looks to chop and run to point byt Klaasen's there and though he's a keeper, he's pretty quick off the blocks. Wonder who he's subbing for..."
"<b>whips it away</b> over midwicket with disdain practically dripping out of him. He's clearly asking, 'really, a leg-stump half-volley? To me? REALLY?'"
punches the back of a length ball outside off to cover
"Mayank stays leg side of the ball, but Southee follows him and cramps him for room"
"this time Mayank goes the other way, stepping across to the off side to play a neat little pick-up to a scramble-seam delivery from Southee, <b>raising the fifty</b>. That's Kings XI's fastest fifty of the season so far"
""
"straighter from Southee, and Mayank can't do anything with the splice-jarring length"
"he spots a little width outside off and throws himself into a big shot, but <b>ball beats bat</b>"
"good finish to the over, keeping things tight in the channel as Mayank chops to mid off"
"good start, hurrying Rahul's defence with one that rushes on to him"
"<b>nothing rushed about this shot</b>, Rahul stepping out to lift a full ball cleanly over wide long on. He was playing against the turn, but kept his balance and pinged it out of the middle"
"Chahal over-corrects after the last delivery, dropping it short and wide outside off to open up the cover field for Rahul's scything cut"
"<b>under edge on this?</b> Yes, must have been, as he misses a sweep but manages to keep the ball away from his stumps"
"punched a little awkwardly to cover, but there's room for a single"
"dabbed down to short third man, and they scoot through for a single"
"<b>is this the edge?</b> Saini's excited, but the umpire shakes his head. There's no doubt about the quality of the delivery though, bursting off a length outside off at better than 140km/h, and beating Mayank's outside edge"
"<b>but the riposte from the batsman is immediate</b>, stepping into a smoking drive, on the up, through cover point. It was the width that invited the shot"
"Mayank slashes, but he doesn't get all of this and the ball bounces down to third man, just the single"
"<b>edged to third man!</b> Saini finds the channel outside off, and Rahul just hangs his bat out at it. There's no slip in place, so it's relatively safe to go fishing. And he's got four for it"
"chopped down to point, and Rahul wants a single but he's sent back. And rightfully so, as Stoinis swoops and has a shy"
Saini keeps the speedometer nudging 140 clicks as he ends his over with another delivery that zones in on off stump and is pushed to cover
"his first ball seams in off a length, Mayank flicking it into the leg side. He wanted more, but couldn't execute"
"Rahul backs away, but is content with a firm push down to long on to turn the strike over"
"Mayank unfurls a handsome leg glance, but it's directed straight at Chahal, at midwicket inside the circle"
"short from Stoinis, but he just doesn't have the pace to trouble the bat. Mayank swivels to pull a 130km/h bumper out to deep backward square"
"wicket-to-wicket stuff, and it's flicked out to the man in the deep on the leg side"
"poor line from Stoinis, offering up a very friendly length delivery down the leg side. But some nifty tag-team fielding at the boundary's edge saves runs"
Mayank whips across his front pad to collect a single behind square on the leg side
"nurdled straight of midwicket, and there's room for a quick single"
"<b>flat and hard!</b> The ball was full, just outside off, and Mayank decided to take on the fielder at long off. He gets <i>just</i> enough on it to beat the leaping fielder, and <b>raises the fifty stand</b>"
"glanced behind square, and they hurry back for the second"
"<b>too short</b>, Mayank crouching at the crease to get into position for a front-foot pull, and nailing the shot well in front of square"
and a nudged single means he keeps the strike
"<b>Stoinis breaks through!</b> Against the run of play. And it was a fairly innocuous delivery, just short of a length and straight. Mayank was looking to pull it off the front foot, and didn't bother keeping it down, but the ball has just rushed on quicker than he expected, looping off the splice to be caught by a tumbling Chahal at midwicket inside the circle. Stoinis bellows his approval at the wicket. Kohli's pretty chuffed too"
"and he steps into a defensive push to point to start, finding the fielder perfectly"
Miller opens his account with a drive to long on
"<b>direct hit might have had him!</b> Rahul nudged almost straight to Chahal at midwicket and just set off. He's only got one stump to aim at, and misses"
"tapped down in front of point, who can't quite stop the single"
"tip-and-run single for Rahul, chopping it down close in on the off side"
"<b>and he strikes first ball!</b> This will dent Kings XI's chances even further. Rahul was looking to get after Moeen straight away, but his lofted stroke comes off the end of the bat and finds Southee at long off. It's not the biggest boundary, but the shot doesn't have the legs to beat him"
Pooran's off the mark straight away with a drive to long off
"<b>a diving Kohli saves runs</b>, Miller leaning into a drive that can't beat the RCB skipper in the covers"
"Miller drives, but again he can't find a gap at cover"
"down to long off this time, just the one"
"fired in flat on off stump, Pooran backing away and chopping to long off to keep the strike"
"Sundar, finally, is into his work for the evening, sliding one in to Pooran to start"
"another slider from around the stumps, and Pooran can't lay bat on an expansive attempted pull"
"speared in at his pads again, and this time Pooran finds space with a flick into the leg side"
"Sundar gives him nothing, zoning in on Miller's pads"
"worked with the angle into the leg side, turning the strike over"
"<b>almost a caught-and-bowled!</b> Pooran backed away, opening up his stance, but he's too early into his push as the ball grips the surface and <i>nearly</i> punts it back to the bowler, who dives forward but can't get the fingers underneath it"
"Miller looks to be proactive, jumping out at Moeen, but he can't get under it and it's only a single to long on"
Pooran backs away and hacks a drive out to long off
"Miller gives long off more work to do, punching off the back foot"
"Moeen spots Pooran backing away to leg and follows him, the ball coming off the inside half of a wild swat into the leg side and rolling out to deep square leg"
"eased down to long on, just the one"
"slapped uppishly down to long off, the ball falling well in front of the fielder"
"<b>Pooran breaks the shackles!</b> Something had to give, with the required rate ballooning. He makes room and sends the ball arcing deep into the crowd beyond long off"
"<b>and again!</b> Pooran backs himself to blast another one clear of the long off fielder, and though he doesn't quite get all of this one, it goes the distance"
"Pooran makes room, but Sundar pulls his length back and follows him to stop the shot"
"<b>third one in the over!</b> And it's in exactly the same spot. Pooran shimmies and makes room, slamming a 90-metre six into the stands beyond long off"
"<b>beaten on the slog!</b> Brave stuff from Sundar, tossing this one up high. Pooran's head fell back and he lost his shape awkwardly, the ball dipping past his wild heave"
"faster, flatter, and it's just a single out to the sweeper"
"probing start, Saini landing a virtual yorker just outside off and Pooran digging it out to point"
"<b>flat!</b> Pooran clears his left leg and smears a length delivery over extra cover. The ball never got over a few metres in height, but it crashes into the boundary marker on the full ... or <i>just</i> in front of it perhaps, as it's given as a four"
"Saini's response - typical of a fast bowler - is to dig in a bouncer at better than 140km/h. It's a little too hot for Pooran, who mistimes a pull to long on"
"<b>a diving Chahal saves runs!</b> He had some work to do after Miller timed a slash very well behind square, making ground from third man and then diving to save two"
"speared in to the pads, and Miller can't get bat on his attempted glance"
"Saini nudges the speedometer up towards 143km/h, Miller glancing out to deep midwicket"
"looped down on middle and leg, and Miller misses his sweep"
Miller is half forward to drive to long off
"<b>a fourth six over long off!</b> Pooran knows where his strength lies. He backs away to put a straight delivery right in his arc, slamming it way over long off"
"nice comeback from Moeen, holding his one back and pushing his line a little further outside off to keep the batsman quiet"
<b>but not for long!</b> Moeen offers up a full toss and Pooran mooses it mightily over long on
"Moeen sends this one down wider of off stump, and the ball grips in the surface to beat the edge of Pooran's slashing square drive"
"<b>slashed to third man!</b> The fielder is up inside the circle in that position, so Miller just needed to get it past him. He flashes at a back of a length delivery from Southee, and places it just right"
"<b>into the leg side now</b>, Miller stepping back to hammer a length delivery from Southee to deep midwicket. And his strike rate goes above a run a ball for the first time"
"slower ball from Southee, down to 115km/h, and Miller hands the strike back over to Pooran with a nudge to point"
"<b>struck on the grille!</b> Southee digs it in short and beats Pooran's pull, the ball striking him flush on the grille. But he maintains his composure and completes the run"
"slower one, on a length outside off, and Miller is beaten"
"slugged down to long on, and Miller keeps the strike"
"Miller does exactly as he needs to, dropping the ball close in on the leg side for a quick single"
"Pooran has almost swung himself off his feet trying to hit this, but it comes on to him just a bit too quickly and he toe-ends it down to long off"
Miller whips a full one into the leg side with plenty of bottom hand
"<b>dropped by Stoinis!</b> Pooran backed away and top edged a wild pull high into the night sky. Stoinis seemed to keep his eyes on it all the way, getting under the chance, but he kept his hands low trying to catch it and it just popped straight out. No reverse cup either from the Australian. Could that be the game? Could that be the end of RCB's campaign?"
""
quick single! Miller taps to cover and they just set off. A direct hit would have been interesting
"Pooran is going to hurt his back if he keeps swinging this hard at the ball! I'm not sure where he was looking to hit this, but if he had managed to put bat on ball, it would have travelled. As it happens, he's beaten outside off"
"<b>caught at long on!</b> Well, Stoinis has just dropped Pooran, but de Villiers makes no mistake in the deep to get rid of Miller. The ball was full, and the shot was on, but Miller just didn't get the height or the distance he was looking for. AB made ground, running around in front of the sightscreen and then diving forward to hold the chance"
"and he attempts a cheeky paddle-scoop first ball, but Saini rushes a full ball right between his legs for a vital dot ball"
"Mandeep is rushed by a ball that spits off a length at 140km/h, but he gets enough bat on it to turn the strike over with a single to long on"
"Pooran sets himself to smash this short one over square leg, but the ball goes completely in the opposite direction, bouncing out to deep point for a single. Pooran's in no danger of under-hitting one"
""
"<b>another skied slog, but this one is held!</b> If anything, this one went even further up in the air than the last chance as Pooran backed away and heaved at a full one. The ball is in the air for an age, coming down with ice on it, but if there's one fielder you'd trust to hold such a difficult chance, it's de Villiers. He settles under the swirling chance, and has to dive at the last minute to get to it, but clings on"
"<b>but Ashwin still believes!</b> Yadav offers up a length delivery on the stumps, and the skipper just slams it straight down the ground. This ain't over yet"
"but maybe it is now. The ball was a similar one, so the shot was on again, but Ashwin just didn't get the connection he was looking for. He still got enough on it to make the catch a difficult one - Kohli had to time his leap, right next to the boundary at long on, just right, but he does so and holds the catch cleanly"
"<b>gloved down the leg side</b>, and this game is safe now. Umesh greets his fellow quick Hardus with a bumper first up, and he can only get a glove on it. Parthiv makes ground and tumbles to his left to hold the low, dipping chance, and <b>Yadav is on a hat trick</b> as the Chinnaswamy finds its voice once more"
"no hat trick for Yadav, but Ashwin is nonetheless beaten by a full one that zips past his flailing bat outside off"

"spanked out to wide long off, and that's that"
