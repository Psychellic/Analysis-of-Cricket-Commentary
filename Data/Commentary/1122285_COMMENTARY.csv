"good length and a tad wide outside off, inside-edged past the stumps for a run."
"good length delivery on middle and leg, 135 kph, flicked down to fine leg for a single"
"six more. Back of a length, 138 kph, the ball keeps climbing and Rohit pulls, not quite all of it, but enough to clear the backward square leg boundary. Fantastic timing"

"good length again outside off, tapped away towards point quietly. Good comeback"
"short on middle and leg, Rohit backs away, looking to cut the ball over third man. The ball goes through to the keeper, Klaasen goes up in appeal. And he is so confident that they <strong>call for the review</strong>. Big noise as bat passes ball, there is a spike on Snicko, so South Africa have their first. <strong>Junior Dala has his first international wicket!</strong>"

"flat-batted for six. Raina-d for six. He backs away, gets a short ball, it sits up for Raina, who swats it away in trademark style, over midwicket for six"
"dropped and it trickles away for four. Back of a length again, around middle, Raina slaps the ball over mid-off, the fielder races back, Behardien the fielder, and gets there. But just can't hold on, the ball slips out of the fingertips and goes for four."

"that hard length again, on middle and leg, he doesn't quite keep his eyes on the ball, worked away to square leg"

"147 kph, Dala takes his second. Raina's belligerent innings ends. A full delivery, around middle and leg, Raina clears his front leg, looking to hoick away into the leg side, but the ball takes the leading edge and lobs back to the bowler. An easy catch, Dala is pumped."

"another bouncer, quick down leg, Dhawan pulls but the ball grazes the glove and flies past the keeper for another boundary. Well bowled, but pace is a batsman's friend"

"better length, 140 kph, outside off, Dhawan's feet don't move, his hands do, but he finds cover"
"too wide this time. They keep erring and India keep capitalising. Short and wide from Morris, slashed through point for four. Lovely timing from Dhawan"
"<b>Behardien drops a sitter at long-on</b>. Kohli has been given a reprieve, how much will that cost SA? Full on middle, Kohli bottom-hands it away to long-on, who just dropped it. They don't even run."
"the next ball is put away for four. Short and wide, carved away through backward point for four. Too easy"
"shortish on middle and leg, worked away in the gap at square leg for a couple"
"what a shot! All the way for six. Some flight around off, Kohli just strides forward and extends his drive, extends it so high that the ball races away over long-off. Sublime timing. Picture-perfect T20 stroke!"

"full around off, 95 kph, swept away to deep backward square leg for a single"
"and given! Shamsi is absolutely thrilled, <strong>but Kohli reviews!</strong> Kohli is quite confident. Flat outside off, the ball pitches and spins back in, beats Kohli on the inside edge and hits him in front of middle and leg. Hit him on the back pad. Three reds on HawkEye, so the decision stays. And he finds consolation for the drop in the previous over. Some respite for SA."

"overpitched outside off, driven to long-off for a single."

"back of a length outside off, tapped to sweeper cover on the front foot"
"smashes this short ball to bring up his <b>half-century</b> . A woeful ball, dug in short on an off stump line and he bludgeons this in front of deep midwicket, into the boundary on the bounce"
"short and wide outside off, cut to sweeper cover"
<b>review for lbw</b> as Pandey misses one on the back foot too. Spinning back in sharply and hitting him in front of leg. Pandey s struck on the front pad unlike Kohli...and the replay shows it'll remain umpire's call. That's clipping leg stump
<b>cramped again</b> as Pandey goes deep in the crease. Rips back in at off stump from a flat trajectory and he's caught on the hop as he shapes to cut
"good length on off stump, tapped to extra cover on the up"
well manufactured. There's a gap over midwicket and he walks down and across the pitch to open that up for himself. Catches the ball before it can slant away from him and chips it on the up into that empty region
slower ball at a length down leg side. Goes after it with a sweep and apepars to have got a glove on it. It lobs and lands in front of the keeper who can't cut it off. They steal the second. Turns out it's leg-byes
"nicely run. Back of a length at middle stump, tapped into the midwicket area with soft hands. Because of his previous boundary, that man is on the boundary now. So he can come back for a second"
"full on leg stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
"short ball in the corridor, backs away and runs it off the face to third man"
good length and in at off stump. Exposes the stumps and taps into the off side from the crease

short ball on leg stump and he pulls well. Can't beat deep square to his leg though
"short ball outside off, hurried on the pull shot and he's dragged it straight to mid-on. Looks like a bad call as he's halfway down but there's no direct hit and Pandey makes it"
this time it's to deep square's right. Another short ball and he's not in full control this time as he hooks. It's off the high end of the bat but wide enough from the fielder there
"slower ball, back of a length outside off. Runs it wide of point with soft hands"
follows the batsman with a yorker and cramps him down leg side. He drives into his own pad and it rolls back down the pitch
slower ball at a length down leg side. Swishes and misses
Dhawan stood well outside the line of leg stump as the bowler ran in. Gets a short ball at middle stump and there's enough room for a cut past point
<b>scoops it to the keeper.</b> Dhawan shuffles either side of the stumps before getting on his knee to try and scoop one fine. It's a slower ball that greets him though and the shot ends up being a lob towards the keeper who dives in front and gets his gloves underneath this. Superb innings ends softly
"back of a length on off stump, nudged to mid-on from the crease"
"short ball outside off, opens the face and carves this to third man's right"

"back of a length at leg stump, poked into the square leg region"
<b>dropped.</b> Shamsi puts one down to this right at short fine leg. Pandey goes deep in the crease and into the off side. Gets a yorker on middle that he clips with some force. Shamsi has it covered but loses it on the fall
"back of a length at leg stump, a slower ball. Pushed through square leg"
short ball down leg side. Gets inside the line and looks to hook. It's close but he can't get bat on it
"full on leg stump, clears the front leg and drills this to long-on"
slices it past point. Shuffles into the off side and Morris misses his length on the yorker wide outside off. Dhoni gets it on the full and opens the face to send this dribbling to third man's right
"slower ball, back of a length on off stump. Tapped to short third man with an open face"
<b>boom!</b> Steps out and hammers this past the bowler. Full ball outside off met on the pitch and mid-off is in. Not that he would've stopped it at long-off. This is very straight and very fast
"short ball on middle stump, gets inside the line and hooks to fine leg"
"slower ball back of a length outside off. Lines up to try and slap this on the up over extra cover, but it's a slower ball that sits in the pitch and climbs over the bat"
"yorker on middle stump, squeezed into the off side"
"slower ball, back of a length outside off. Hops into the off side and glances this in front of fine leg"

yorker fired down leg side. Can't get bat on the flick
yorker dips in from outside off. Looks to squeeze this square on the off side and is beaten on the inside edge
drops it short and he's punished. Fine leg and square leg are in. Pandya just has to get it wide of them and he slaps this in front of the umpire there
back to the yorker but Pandya bisects square leg and fine leg this time! Superb shot. Reaches out to get to the yorker on the full and forces it to the long leg boundary

"low full toss outside off, dragged wide of deep midwicket who keeps them to one"
"offcutter dropped short on middle stump, middles the pull and finds deep midwicke"

"full at off stump, cramped as he looks to slog. Ends up jamming it into the pitch and back at the bowler who can't hang onto that"
yorker on middle stump and he jams it out to long-on. Pandya is coming back for the second easily. Pandey has more sprinting to do after being forced to recover after playing the shot. It's sent upstairs as Klaasen takes the bails off. He's made it
"full on off stump, makes room and drives straight to mid-off"
another yorker executed to perfection. Pandya can't do more than flick this wide of deep square and they won't be allowed a second this time
"short and wide and SA are away. 129 kph, plenty of width. Smuts stays in his crease and then slashes a cut into the gap at point. A bit of swing, but not the right length"
"this one comes back in at 136 kph, full and coming back in, worked to mid-on for a run. That's good, no dot ball from SA."

"full and wide outside off, the ball pitches and swings back in, beats Smuts' exuberant drive on the up"
"beauty! <strong>Moving the ball both ways</strong>. A full delivery around middle, Smuts sees it as an opportunity to flick through midwicket, the ball pitches, moves away and beats the flick. Sensational bowling"
"131 kph, full delivery around off, pushed back to the bowler."
"stunning shot. A slower delivery outside off, the offcutter. Hendricks just punches the drive through cover. It's not over-hit. It's Hendricks' modus operandi, not over-hitting"
"ouch! <strong>Unadkat falls over in his follow-through</strong>, the ball just about lands on the strip, the ball pitches and cuts past the strip. Wide on the off side. He seems fine"
"132 kph, seam-up, full and wide, angled away, the ball beats Hendricks' leaden-footed drive. Well bowled"
"back of a length around off, worked away into the gap at midwicket. That's not too bad, a boundary and a single"
"a hoick for four. A full delivery around off, it sliced off the outside half but he has so much power that the ball races away to the boundary, right over the bowler's head"
"another slower delivery, the cutter, it's moving away from the batsman so he hits the ball with the direction of that angle. Swatted away through cover. Mid-off has no chance."
"on the pads, flicked away through square leg for a run. 141 kph. It's a defensive ball, cramping the batsman for room. Good execution"
"was that the knuckle ball? Back of a length around middle, worked to midwicket. His knuckle balls swerve in the air, this one did"
"there is Hendricks at his best. Full delivery outside off, the ball moves away. Hendricks sees it early, wants to play a drive, but then decides why not loft it with power? And timing? So he does that, and the ball clears mid-off easily. Just a checked drive"
"six and a single, good stuff. Back of a length around off, worked to midwicket"
"taken by Dhawan. Smuts undone by Bhuvneshwar's slower ball. The knuckle ball. It's full on middle and off, Smuts sees an opportunity to flick the ball over midwicket, but the ball stops on him slightly. It takes the leading edge and lobs towards Dhawan at square leg, a reverse-cupped catch."
"134 kph, good length around off, clipped to deep square leg for one."
"good length delivery around off, a thick inside edge to the pad, one to point"
"133 kph, good length on the pads, Duminy misses a flick, struck on the pad and one leg bye ensues"

"a slower delivery outside off, tapped towards backward point, good improvisation from both parties"
"good length outside off, 134 kph, Duminy chooses to pull instead of cut, he meets the ball too early, toe-ends it away to mid-on"

"138 kph, around off, on a length, nudged to midwicket. Some pressure, no boundary for the last 10-12 balls"
"Raina takes the catch, running back. A really good catch. Another slower ball around middle and leg, Duminy is through his swat too early, the ball gets more elevation than distance. Raina runs back from midwicket, keeps his eyes on the ball and takes a good catch in front of him, running towards the stands. Bhuvneshwar's third over works well for India, was that the best game awareness from their captain?"
"good length delivery around off, 133 kph, clipped to midwicket"

"using that angle, full around leg, the ball hits the body and then back up the pitch"
"a full toss that is drilled back at the stumps. He's looking for timing, but doesn't place it too well. Dot. <strong>41 for 2 for SA compared to 78 for 2 for India</strong>"
"sensational fielding from Bumrah. Amazing from a fast bowler who has just bowled an over. A back of a length delivery, takes the leading edge off Miller and keeps climbing away towards Bumrah, who leaps and pulls the ball back in. But he is stepping on the boundary cushion before his leap, which means his last point of contact before touching the ball was the boundary. According to the rules, that's six. And called. Good effort though"
"a tennis-ball bouncer that lobs over Miller, wide"
"the slower ball does for Miller. Is that the game? Completely deceives Miller, full and wide outside off, Miller is through his shot, the ball lobs up towards mid-on. Dhawan runs back and takes the reverse-cupped catch"
"short length, down leg, hurries Hendricks for pace, off the glove for one down to fine leg."
"good length outside off, tapped down to third man for a run"

"plenty of flight and loop outside off, drilled to deep cover, five in five so far"

"loads of flight outside off, hit away to deep cover, 87 kph"
"lovely hit. Runs to the pitch, gets there and drills a six over the bowler's head. Made that shot with use of his feet. Superb striking"
"still some flight outside off, jammed away towards deep cover with bad timing and soft hands, enabling them to come back for two. A direct hit at the bowler's end would have had Hendricks"

put away easily. Pandya can't finish a good over off. Strays on the pad at a length. Square leg is in and Behardien chips this over him with the angle
shuffles a long way and leaves alone. It spins past the wide marker and the umpire won't give it
goes with the bat this time. Length ball wide outside off and he swivels and whips this reverse-sweep past short third man
full and wide outside off. Left alone
"tossed up on middle stump, driven firmly along the floor to long-on"
oh what a hit. Shuffles and meets this full all outside off. Gets down quickly and swats powerfully to bisect long-on and deep midwicket with the sweep
"oh well placed. High skill from Hendricks. It's dropped short outside off. There are three fielders behind square on the off side so his timing has to be perfect if he needs to get a four. Does it just right to hit it in front of the straightest of those fielders, at cover point, and beats deep extra well to his left"
<b>beats the outside edge.</b> Hendricks squared up as he looks to nudge this back of a length ball through midwicket from off stump
offcuter to start off. Back of a length and slanted across off. He gets down for the ramp and can't adjust quickly enough for the late cut. Beaten

"back of a length outside off, looks to steer it to third man and is beaten"

"slower ball, full at off stump. Taps into the cover region on the front foot"
stunning yorker. Follows him down the leg side and goes for the toes. Hendricks can't get anything on it

slower ball at a length outside off. Gets down to try and go inside-out but he's lost it in the variation. Well beaten
"yorker on off stump, jammed into the turf towards extra cover"
googly not picked. Trapped on the back foot and is forced to tap it into his boot in the end
"short ball down leg, follows it and can't get power on the pull. Ends up dragging it aerially towards deep square"
Pandya over-runs at midwicket but manages to stop it with his left hands. This is hit sweetly against the turn. A slog sweep. It's flat and Pandya's gaffe allows the second
"<b>beaten in flight</b> but he picks up four. Tossed up outside off, not to the pitch as he looks to go over cover. It's a thick outside edge that clears point"
<b>run out chance missed.</b> Chahal fails to pick up a throw from Rohit who is at cover point and Hendricks survives after struggling across the pitch trying to steal a single
"<b>taken at long-on.</b> He's done by the slowness. Seems to have gotten to the pitch of this full ball at middle stump. Looks good as the bat comes on it too, but he's ended up losing his shape at the last moment and got it off the toe-end. Pandey takes neatly to his right"
beaten by a yorker outside off as he looks to squeeze it square
"what a shot. Slower yorker at off stump. Gets low, waits for it to arrive and lifts it elegantly over mid-off"
bouncer too quick. This fizzes past him outside off as he looks to shuffle and hook
"slower yorker outside off, squeezed down to long-off"
"yorker on off stump. Backs away and gets good connection on the chop, but he hits straight to Pandya"
"<b>lovely!</b> Not a lot of people can get Bumrah's variations away. This is full and a slower ball on off stump. He hags back, picks it, and carves it between backward point and short third man"
"short of a length outside off, pushed to extra cover on the up"
"offcutter, back of a length at off stump. Shuffles and gets cramped. Punched to extra cover"
bouncer dug in too short and too far outside off for him to attempt a shot. Left alone
oh he's missed a full toss. This is just outside off and he's ended up making too much room as he steps out. Beaten and Dhoni doesn't gather cleanly
"slower ball full outside off, shuffles and can't get under it. Lifts it towards long-off"
"predicts the slower ball, stands still in the crease and allows this length ball to sit up. Then, he slaps it over the long-on boundary off the back foot. What strength"
<b>sliced over short third man.</b> Seems to have made too much room once again but the offcutter finds itself coming in and catching the thick outside part of his attempted cut
"<b>top edge</b> is gobbled up by Dhoni. Bhuvneshwar goes with the legcutter first up, on a good length wide outside off. He goes across the line and it deviates away from him enough. Top innings from Hendricks that has kept South Africa alive, but is this the match for India?"
"overpitched on leg stump, driven to long-on's left and Phehlukwayo comes back for the second at the other end"
"slower ball at a length outside off. Backs away to try and punch this through extra cover. Done by change in pace, this goes towards long-on off the toe-end"
"shuffles this time and cuts out the room for himself. Bhuvneshwar has bowled an overpitched ball that's there for the big hit, but Klaasen's weight is falling into the off side as he tries to clear long-on. Ends up hitting it straight to Suresh Raina who gets on one knee to take it with a reverse-cup. Career-best figures for the bowler."
"<b>holes out to long-on!</b> Morris gone, it's a five-for for Bhuvneshwar and he's on a hat-trick too. Talk about ending the match in one over. It's a slower ball at a length on off stump. He looks to clear long-on too but miscues the shot. Raina has to run in this time and he catches with his fingertips"
"back of a length outisde off, chopped to point's right...who leaps to his right and gets a hand to cut out the speed on this. Then recovers to pick up and send in a flat throw above the stumps at the striker's end. During the course of all this, the batsmen have somehow though there's a second there. Not even close. Pandya's brilliance gives India a fourth wicket in the over"
"<b>beamer</b>at an off stump line gets the glove of the batsman and Dhoni can't stop with his pads. Whew, that was scary. Short third man won't cut it off"
gets the yorker right this time. Nails it at an off stump line and the batsman can only get this down to long-off
back of a length and in at off stump. Nudges it wide of point for the single
"yorker at off stump, gets the front leg out of the way and squeezes it to extra cover"
