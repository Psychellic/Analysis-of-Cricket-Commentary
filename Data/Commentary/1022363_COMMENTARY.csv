"back of a length at middle, pitches on that big green patch in the middle and goes down leg. Rahim dives to his left. An appeal, which is turned down, and then a plea from Guptill who swears that didn't come off the thigh and wants a wide"
"back of a length at off stump, nicely behind the line to defend this into the off side"
"good length, off stump, waits for it to come on defends later under his eyes"
"good length, off stump, nice big stride and pushed to mid-off"
"<b>edge</b> flies wide of the solitary slip. This well bowled. Angles in at a length on off stump, straightens slightly and has Guptill fending at it. It's a thick outside edge that third man has to cut off in the end"
"good length, in the corridor, slight angle in but Ronchi is confident he has covered the off stump and lets this go"
"some swing into the bat, full and from outside off. Guptill reaches the pitch and opens the face at the last moment to squeeze this past point. In the air but safe"
nice. More control this time. Leans into this outside off and punches it past the cover fielder
"full and on the pads, stands tall and pushes this past midwicket. Timed well, but the heavy outfield grips this ball tight. He comes back for the third"
"back of a length, slanted across the right hander, and he lets it go to the keeper"
"good length, off stump, tapped into point with an open face"
"good length, slight shape in at off stump. Watchfully pushed back to the bowler on the bounce"
"teasing stuff from Mortaza. Good length, just outside off stump, but there's carry on this pitch. Guptill happy to leave"

"nips this back in from outside off stump, Guptill leaves another good leave"
"good length at off stump, well forward this time to punch it to mid-off"

"shot. But it's a maiden. Gets the punch right this time, but he finds mid-off"
"overpitched outside off stump, leans into it and pokes it into the covers. Slight hesitation but he got it sufficiently to the fielder's right"
"angled across off stump again, full and wide, pushed to mid-off's left off the front foot"
"zip. From a length on middle stump. Classic Mustafizur. Ronchi pokes, without feet, and is beaten outside off stump"
"back of a length on off stump, tapped into the covers on the up"
"good looking shot. Hangs back in the crease and picks this length ball against the angle, gets it over midwicket"
"smashed that! Fizz goes wide with this, it's at a nice hitting length, and Ronchi clears the arms to slap this over point"
"oh wow. No respect there, for sure. This is a length ball at off stump, not different from what he's been doing so far. Guptill sees it coming, has his stride leg side of this ball and creams this on the up over the long-off boundary"
"he sticks to his line and length, but Guptill is all over him how. This is back of a length in the corridor, and there's a hint of movement away off the pitch. Doesn't bother the batsman, slaps this between point and cover point"
"offcutter at a length, off stump, stretches forward nicely and defends this"
"offcutter again, good length at off stump. Gets the stride in early and then adjusts to defend this back down the pitch"
"back of a length at middle stump, punched to long-on on the up"
"offcutter picked early. Puts in a good stride outside off and drives this firmly, but the bowler gets a hand and mid-off gets across"
"beaten. This skids through in the channel from back of a length. Guptill looks to punch through the line, but he plays inside it and is beaten"
"overpitched outside off stump, can't get enough timing on this drive, mid-off cleans up"
leaps down the pitch and makes too much room. Taskin throws it wide off stump on a good length and gets this to slide through from under the bat
"stays put this time, watches the overpitched ball nicely, and picks the gap in the covers with a drive"
"back of a length in the corridor, arches slightly and chops this wide of third man"
"bouncer, nicely directed. It flies inwards and forces Ronchi to get out of the way quickly. Barely carries though"
"he's no broom, but he's got rid of the rubbish. Short and wide and Guptill has no issues drilling this through extra cover"
"good length at off stump, behind the line, defended"
"back of a length at off stump, minimal movement away, tapped off the back foot to mid-off"
"skews this over the off side infield, but he's safe. Once again, he's made too much room. This is a good length ball slightly outside off, and he's reached out to it from outside leg stump after stepping out"
"back of a length at off stump, firmly punched off the back foot, straight to extra cover"
"full, off stump, front leg out of the way to punch this back down the pitch. To mid-off via bowler's fingertips"
"<b>breakthrough!</b> Ronchi mistimes again. Taskin's pace is the reason. This is back of a length at off stump, and he wants to swipe this through midwicket with no intention of keeping it down. But that comes on quick, gets him high on the bat, and it's a simple lob to mid-on"
"good length at off stump, gets behind the line and drops this into the point region with soft hands"

"back of a length, takes it a touch away from off stump. Williamson on his toes to flick this, but is a bit squared in the end. Pushes it to mid-on"

"good length at off stump, defended into the off side with a half stride"

"good length at off stump, offcutter, waits for it to come on and taps it past the bowler"
"oh, loose from Williamson. This is short and wide and he's looked to poke at this with minimal feet. It skids past the outside edge"
"good length at off stump, forward stride, defended to mid-off"
"back of a length at off stump, gets on his toes, drops it into the leg side with soft hands. Neatly done"
"back of a length in the corridor, mistimed punch back down the pitch"
sweet. Nice high elbow as he meets this length ball outside off and punches it past mid-off

"full at off stump, pushed to mid-off off the front foot, slightly late on that drive"
"slings this in, back of a length, outside off, and strikes the bat hard as he looks to punch this"
"back of a length outside off stump, no error this time, lets it go"
"<b>edge</b> and another one evades slip! Good, quick stuff from Rubel. Gets it to straighten in the corridor, forces hard hands and the edge, but once more it's third man who is at the end of this"
"back of a length, off stump, defended off the back foot"
"full outside off stump, leans into try and drive this through the covers, but he's playing to far away. Bat turns, ball back at the bowler"

"back of a length outside off and this one moves away, Williamson lets it go"

"back of a length outside off stump, looks to run this down, but it's high on the bat and first slip cuts it off"
"oh, he gives him a release and he won't get away. A generous full ball on the toes with an open leg side field. Williamson picks the V - tucks this wide of mid-on"
"short and wide this time, well outside off. Climbs into this cut and finds sweeper"
"<b>he's gone!</b> Dead straight and probably crashing into middle stump. Good length, aimed for off stump, but comes in with his natural angle. Guptill plays down the wrong line and is well beaten for pace. A short mid-pitch discussion with his captain, and they won't review. Great bowling"
"bouncer, too short and down the leg side, he ducks under it"
"back of a length outside off stump, pushed into the off side on the up"

"awwww yesssss! Good length outside off, and this time he takes it away from the forward defence. Beats the outside edge"
"Tayor gallops down the track, tries to unsettle Shakib. The left-armer holds his own. Pulls his length back and keeps Taylor to a single. Dropped gently towards square leg"

"this one stops on the batsman, chipped down to long-on"
"arm ball, pushed back down to the right of Shakib"
"another huuuuge appeal for lbw from Shakib. At least this one pinged the pad. Taylor steps out, slides in with the arm, but this was heading down leg"
"drifts in full, Taylor walks at the bowler plays all around his front pad, Shakib does not appeal this time. This was heading down leg too with the angle from over the stumps"
worked with the angle to square leg for one

"banged in short and outside off, front-foot pull to the left of deep square leg"
"full and outside off, squirted past point. Bam! <strong>Taylor and Rubel ram into each other</strong>. The fielder  in the deep swoops down on the ball. Taylor almost head-butted Rubel while setting off for the second run. They eventually decided against it. Williamson dives back into the crease"

"arm ball, extra bounce, beats the sweep"
"A mix-up between the wickets! This is messy, and Williamson is caught short at the bowler's end. Reward for Bangladesh after building up pressure. This was full and straight, tickled to short fine leg. Mosaddek swoops down on the ball but the throw is off-radar. Shakib adjusts, swivels around, and takes the bails off to dismiss Williamson. Shakib made that throw look a lot better. It was the captain's call, but there wasn't a run in it. Taylor wasn't interested at all. To simply put it: Williamson ran himself out"

"back of a length at middle stump, whipped to deep square leg"
"awkward. This is a bouncer outside off. Taylor wants to pull, then leave, then pull. In the end, it's body swiveling, bat high. The ball strikes it and it's a single on the off side"

"length outside off stump, half a stride across to drive it on the up to sweeper"
"length ball, angled into the pads. Taylor over-reaches, but he can control this flick to get it to deep square's right"
a loud appeal for caught behind. Ian Gould might as well be a mannequin. No response from him as he deems that this bouncer has fizzed past Taylor's attempted hook without any connection
"<b>good adjustment from Taskin.</b> Taylor goes for a premeditated ramp over fine leg, but he's shuffled across too early. Taskin sees him and digs this back of a length. He makes it a legcutter too. Taylor completely done for timing and is in a pretty poor position. Can only offer this to short fine"

"back of a length at middle, tucked behind square on the leg side"
"oh well fielded. Good length at middle stump, leans in and pushes with soft hands towards long-on. Deep midwicket, long-on are converging but it's the bowler, running back, who puts in a slide and forces the batsmen to head back after taking off for a second"
"<b>ouch.</b> Clear plan to bowl short to Neesham and this is the first one that has been directed properly. Climbs from a leg stump line, stops him from going through with the pull and thumps him on the chest"

"shot. He's waiting for it now. Stays tall, meets the bouncer nicely in his arc, deposits this to the deep midwicket boundary"
shot. Full and wide outside off stump. Was he playing the batsman or has the batsman played him? Drilled past the non-striker
"good length at middle stump, pushed to wide long-on"
"steps out, meets this back of a length ball away from his body, finds sweeper cover"
"<B>gotcha!</b> Good length, flat, straight, nothing out of the ordinary. Broom steps out, makes a bit of room and looks to slog this over the midwicket boundary. A nice, thick leading edge hands behind square on the off side and the fielders hold their cool. Backward point is given the pleasure, and he makes no mistake"
"good length, angled into the pads, pushed to deep midwicket on the up"
"Anderson is trapped on the back leg and he's walking off, but Neesham's called him back. We have a review for lbw. This is pushed through from around the wicket and Anderson is caught on the flick. It hit him in front of leg stump, so the review was warranted given the angle. But Anderson was deep enough for that to be a straightforward decision in the end"
"good length, off stump, plays with a straight bat, pushes to long-off"

"low full toss fired into the pads, whipped regally, but straight to deep midwicket"
"makes room, gets followed with a yorker. Jams it out to long-on"
"good length outside off stump, forward defence into the covers...and a ridiculous loud appeal from behind the stumps"
no need to appeal this time! Neesham is a fair way down the wicket. This is another routine flat ball at a length from Mosaddek. It's slightly outside off stump. The batsman runs down the track and is too late bringing his flat-batted shot down at this. It slides under his shot and the stumping is simple
"back of a length outside off stump, gets in the air to get on top of the bounce. Hits the ball in the air too, but safely through to sweeper cover"
"digs this bouncer too short, Milne has time to swing at it, but not quite the height"

"low full toss, swinging away from the left-hander who has made too much room and missed out on a juicy offering"
"yorker, just outside off stump. Once more, he's way out of shape after making room and gets his batswing nowhere close. Bisects inside edge and off stump"
"<b>saved by the inside edge</b> and then by a missed throw. Santner walks across his stumps this time, but can only get an inside edge onto pad. Would have been plumb without the edge. He's also run aimlessly down the track and is forced to dive back into the crease as Rubel misses the stumps"
perfect yorkers. Great viewing. Swings away while dipping viciously under his attempted slice through the off side
"full at middle stump, clipped off his pads to deep square's right"
"full and wide outside off stump, flays at it and gets it over the point fielder because of the angle. Sweeper gets across on that large boundary"
"offcutter, climbs up from a length, and climbs over his attempted cut outside off"
"delicious. One pacer to another. Milne shuffles across, gets a yorker and his bat can't stop that from crashing into the stumps"
"Now a run-out appeal. Fizz sends down another top-class yorker that Southee pokes to extra cover. Santner is down the pitch at the other end and is diving back as the direct hit comes in. Shakib, the fielder. Santner's dive is good enough"
"oh, hello. A boundary! A cheeky one. Walks across the stumps and has his back leg plonked some four stumps away. Then realises this is a slower ball. It's length at middle. He waits for it and flicks it nonchalantly past square leg who is inside the circle"
"overpitched at leg stump, gets the front leg out of the way and nails this slog...only to find a diving Mortaza at midwicket refusing him a boundary"
"good thought. Expects the off-stump yorker, goes for the ramp, but the timing is his failing. Gets it with no power to short fine"
"full toss, starts at leg, ends up off stump. Santner is not picking this, clearly. Goes leg side, closes the face early, gets a big leading edge to third man...who mucks up a simple pick up and gets an earful from the bowler"
"overpitched on the leg stump, some signs of a loose ball, but Santner can't connect on the flick. Off the pad and to the keeper"
"away-dipping yorker, fired in at middle stump, jammed back at the bowler"
"overpitched at middle stump, goes for the heave over midwicket but can't get under it. Gets it off the toe-end to the fielder in the circle there"

"back of a length and travels in a straight line, no lateral movement, leg-stump ball. Quietly turned to midwicket"
"Southee strikes with his second ball. Tamim has been given out lbw by umpire Gould. The batsman chooses to challenge the on-field out decision. But this looks pretty adjacent. This was full on middle, lateral movement now, this <b>swings in slightly</b>, enough to bother the left-hander. Tamim falls across, plays down the wrong line. The tracker returns three reds - it would have carried onto hit the leg stump. Bangladesh's gun batsman gone for a duck"
"full and slipping down the leg side, tickled fine on the leg side. Help-yourself ball to the new man"

"back of a length and angling away just outside off, another ginger prod, another inside edge to leg"
"Sabbir has nicked off. Another cracker, this time from Southee. Good length, angled in, and seams away slightly, not sharply, outside off. Sabbir hangs his bat out in the channel with his feet stapled to the crease, thin-edges it behind to Ronchi, who pouches it. Some start from NZ's new-ball bowlers"

"another one skirts past the outside edge! Just short of a good length and outside off, holds its line, Sarkar goes searching for it and is beaten."
"<b>Did that carry to Guptill tumbling to his right from second slip</b>? He does not claim the catch, he isn't sure. The two umpires converge and refer it to the TV umpire. The soft signal is not out. Boult's front foot is fine. On a length, angled in, and straightens a bit. Sharp extra bounce to go with it, takes the outside edge near the top of the bat. Just drops short of Guptill falling to his right"

"back of a length on leg stump, cuts off room, fended square on the leg side"
"inducker, Sarkar pinned on the back pad and is given! New Zealand's seamers have made short work of Bangladesh's top order. On a good length and skids back in, Sarkar is too late onto it. Southee raps the back thigh in front of middle and leg. <b>Was it bouncing over? The tracker suggests so</b>"
"full and straight, worked on the front foot through midwicket"

"shortish and angled in, worked through square leg for one"
"<strong>dropped by Taylor at wide slip</strong>. Good length and slanted across off, Mushfiq jabs at it and manages an outside edge that would have gone down first slip's throat. Instead, Taylor is at a second slip position, he dives to his left with one hand, but the ball bobbles out"

"Shakib steps away outside leg again, Boult does not chase him now. Instead puts it short and wide outside off. This is flat-batted fiercely through the covers"
"Shakib swings... and misses. The stumps are rattled but Bangladesh are all but home. Full on off and middle, he backs away outside leg, looks to smack it away but loses his shape and his off stump. The record 224-run stand is over. Crumbs of consolation for NZ"
"full-toss, angling away outside off, carves it to the right of deep third man for two"
"length and angled across off, steered straight to third man. Just one"
"<b>Mahmudullah raises his hundred with a boundary</b>. This almost cleared the long boundary. He celebrates the milestone with the <i>sajdah</i>. Not sure how I can describe this gesture. He points to his bat repeatedly and looks at the dressing room. Back of a length on the leg stump, launched over square leg"
"back of a length and outside off, guided to gully"
"<b>Bangladesh have done it</b>! They have done it again in Cardiff! They have KO'd NZ this time. Full and outside off, reaches out with his hands and flashes it in the gap between slip and gully. Yes, the man who set it up closes it out. How fitting! Mosaddek roars after the famous win. Mahmudullah has his hands aloft in utter delight"
