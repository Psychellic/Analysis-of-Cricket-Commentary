"short of a length and skids through, little bit of nibble into the right-hander, defended back to the bowler"
jags back in to the right-hander from the back of a length area again and it is pushed from the crease to mid-on before they take off for a quick single
"short of a length, no movement on this one and it comes on straight just outside off, blocked into the off side"
"through the defences, or is it? Hasan gets this one to nibble in sharply again and it beats the inside edge and goes to the wicketkeeper. There is a slight noise and a half appeal for a caught behind, but the umpire is not convinced. Seems like it went off the pad"
and straight away he gets a wicket. This is brilliantly bowled. What a delivery to start off things. Draws Shafiq out of the crease and the batsman obliges. Comes a good way down the track but picks the wrong line. The ball drifts away from him and dips on him before spinning away to comprehensively beat him. Kamran Akmal does the rest
goes for the big sweep and gets hit on the pad. Had the front leg a long way across and the impact was outside off
comes down the track to meet the pitch of this ball before turning it away just to the right of mid-on
loopy and pitched up. Angling in on middle and off and it is bunted into the off side
"holes out to extra cover. Shehzad gives the spinner the charge and tries to loft him down the ground. But he does not account for the sharp turn, the ball is going a long way away from him which means he fails to get on top of it and skews it off the splice of the blade. Sohaib Maqsood settles under it"
"floated up on middle and spinning away, Pietersen crunches a drive to extra cover. Top over from Asghar"
comes down the track and works it to mid-on
"oh, dear. Comes down the track but this one drifts in with the arm and hits him on the pad. Narrowly misses the stumps as it rolls away off the pad towards the fine leg region. He was a long way down so it was always going to make it hard for the lbw to come into play"
"<b>chance at first slip, put down</b>. Rossouw brings out the reverse sweep and skews it off the top edge to Sammy who is moving the wrong way to his left, too late to make amends as he puts a hand to it after stretching as he cannot hold on to it"
"pitched up, defended off the front foot"
"fullish in length again, dabs it into the leg side. No run there"
""
turn and bounce but also short and wide. Pietersen slaps it hard off the backfoot past extra cover where the fielder dives but the ball beats him and does into the boundary
"past the diving extra cover fielder again. Short and wide and it is punched firmly off the backfoot, long-off runs across and tidies up"
"good length. Tossed up and drifting in before straightening. Pietersen has his feet firmly planted inside as he defends, chops it hard into the turf as he does so"
"good length and spinning away outside off, left alone"
shifts back and across to protect the off-stump before smothering the spin and defending this one back towards the bowler
"length ball on off, punched through covers. Two fielders giving it a chase and one of them gets down and manages to pull it back before the ropes"
goes on with the arm and Pietersen backs away to cut but not enough room and he cannot find the gap in the off side
comes down the track and the ball goes off the pad back to the bowler. He was moving across outside off to that one
"short and wide, cut off the backfoot past the diving cover fielder"
"too short and too wide again, the pitch is so slow that he has all the time in the world. Shifts back to use the depth of the crease before laying into a cut shot. Picks the gap through covers perfectly"
"shifts back and makes room, does not get hold of all of it as he works it out to long-off"
"comes down the track, keeps a bit low and he does not entirely manage to get on top of that one as he nudges it away through the midwicket region"
"good length ball, rushes him with pace and the ball cuts back in to rap him on the thigh guard. Optimistic appeal for lbw but that was missing leg. Height also a factor as it hit him on the flap"
"short of a length on leg and middle, stays in the crease and whips it away to midwicket"
tries to whip it hard through the leg side but cannot beat the midwicket fielder
goes hard as he tries to flay this length ball through the off side but the ball goes on the bounce and drops in front of point
"short of good length on the pads, tucked off them to the deep fine leg boundary"
"could have nearly holed out there. Full and angling away outside off, gets the front leg out of the way to give himself enough room and launches it over the off side. Does not entirely get hold of it and the ball lands short of the deep point fielder running across to his left. Wahab not entirely pleased with that effort"
"length ball on off, punched to the left of the bowler and the ball goes to mid-on"
"length on off, opens up a bit and slogs it out to cow corner. No one in the deep"
"gets down to scoop and uses the pace on that delivery as he goes down on one knee and lifts it over and behind, gets it well past the short fine leg fielder and into the boundary"
"cutter outside off, tries to flick it away and is deceived completely. Walks into the shot and gets beaten"
"<b>just short of Sammy at mid-off</b>. Short of a length on off, moves away to make room before flaying it with a flat bat. Cannot get hold of it and the ball goes on the bounce to the mid-off fielder"
"short ball, sitting up nicely for Pietersen who swivels around and pulls. The ball seems to be going to the square leg boundary but deft footwork from Shakib as he plants the right foot across to stop the ball just in front of the boundary after running across from deep midwicket"
"fullish and pushed across, gets down to scoop but fails to make proper connection, the ball hardly goes any distance and falls short of the short fine leg fielder running in"
driven off the front foot to covers
"similar ball, similar shot. Fullish and crunches a drive to covers"
and this one is drilled off the front foot to the bowler and Afridi gets down to the right to field it. Afridi nicely building up the pressure as Rossouw is struggling to get going
you could see this coming. He was desperate to get going and comes charging down the trac to go for a big slog. Ends up getting an inside edge that goes to short fine leg
opens the face of his bat as he sees some width being offered up outside off but cannot beat short third man. Terrific over from Afridi. Maiden. Will the dots lead to a dismissal?
that has split the gap beautifully. Generously flighted outside off and he absolutely lays into a drive that goes wide of extra cover. Long-off darts across but that was hammered and no chance for the fielder
"length on off, cut through cover-point"
"fullish length ball outside off, Rossouw shifts back in the crease and turns it away into the on side. Shakib runs across and collects it"
"down the trac kand looking to whip it away to the on side but the drift on this one takes it in to him and he gets rapped on the pads. Was down by a fair distance, so stifled appeal for lbw not given"
"fuller ball, driven back to the bowler"
driven through covers and he will keep the strike
"turn outside off and some bounce as well, steered off the backfoot square of the wicket"
what a blow that is. Punches this length ball and lifts it over extra cover. Just presents the full face of his bat and the timing on that carries the ball all the way. Holds the pose with the straight bat as he finishes the shot
""
gets down to sweep early but it is not full enough. On a length and spinning in and he gets it off the top edge as the ball lands in front of deep backward square leg
comes down the track and looks to clip it away through the leg side but he has got that off the pad. Drifting in with the arm and raps him on the pad and goes to the fine leg boundary. Almost fell off as he played that one
driven but cannot find the gap in the covers region
"short of a length, middle and leg, swivels around and pulls to deep midwicket"
comes down the track and looks to slog over the leg side but ends up dragging it behind square off the inside part of the blade
drifting in with the arm and strikes him on the pad as he misses the big slog. Pitching outside leg and lots of turn and it probably saved him there

goes for a reverse paddle sweep and ends up missing and getting hit on the pads

"short of a length, tries to pull it away but it does not sit up to his liking and Rososuw ends up dragging it down to long-on"
"good length, angling away outside off, it's the cutter and spins away like an orthodox left-arm spinner's delivery as it cuts off the seam after landing and misses the flashing blade of KP who was looking to heave it away"
"back of a length on off, cramps him for room and it is worked to sweeper cover"
"down the leg side, goes for a slog sweep. Misses and wears it on the pad before the ball rolls away to fine leg"

"drifting in on the pads with the arm, misses the attempted flick and kisses the pad of Pietersen as the ball goes down to fine leg"
"steps out of the crease and slogs again but this time he does not get hold of it entirely. It was wide outside off, meaning he had to drag it from wide of his reach. Gives it a good thump but not good enough to clear the man running across from long-on"

"width outside off, slaps it gently out to deep point"
"goes for a reverse sweep but gets an inside edge to the pad and the ball goes to short third man. Appeal from Afridi, turned down"
"<b>chance at deep midwicket, not taken</b>. Oh, dear! Hafeez and Hasan Ali converge on the ball and neither of them takes it. It was a slog sweep and he skied it, did not get the elevation desired and the ball lands in the deep midwicket region. Both fielders end up looking at each other"
""
"reverse sweep. Gets it on the back leg but the impact is outside off. Afridi's screaming is lungs out in appeal but it is not given. They run as the ball goes to short third man and he throws at the striker's end. Direct hit. Batsman is inside, so the appeal for run out is turned down as well"
""
"Hasan Ali takes the catch this time, in front of the long-on boundary. Smart catch as he gets down to his front. Pietersen was trying to loft it as the ball slides in with arm but does not middle it. Looks at the toe end of the bat, suggesting the ball went off there"
"length ball outside off, not much turn, whipped off the pads to the vacant gaps in the midwicket region and they come back for a sharp two"

"short of a length and cutting back in slightly from outside off, stays in the crease and opens the bat face to steer it to third man"
stays in the crease and goes after this wide delivery outside off without any feet and gets comprehensively beaten as the angle takes the ball away from him
"full, wide, drills a drive through extra cover, to the right of Afridi and what a save from the not-so-young man. Runs back with all committment and puts in a full-length dive to forcefully pull it back. A catch was not taken off his bowling earlier on and he is now setting an example"
drilled down to long-on for a single
"short and wide, cuts off the backfoot to deep point. Sweeper cover runs across and collects it and they push for the second. Good throw needed and it comes at the keeper's end. Not the best of throws. Kamran does well to gather the ball and throw on to the stumps and he is short of the crease. Credit to the keeper there for collecting a slightly wayward throw"
stays leg side of the ball to make room and flays this short of a length ball to backward point
comes down the track and there is extra pace and bounce on that delivery. Gets big on him and he is a long way away from the ball as well so he has to fetch the pull. Cannot find the middle of the bat. Chops it on to the stumps off the bottom part of the blade and Mahmudullah's short stint does not yield any runs

The striker collides into him as he is completing the run and Hasan is trying to get in line of the ball. But that does not deter him as he judges it to perfection and pouches a smart catch. Took a similar one yesterday"
"fuller ball, gets the front leg out of the way and crunches a drive but straight to the fielder at extra cover"
down the throat of Wahab at deep square leg. Goes for the slog and skies it again. Cannot clear the long boundary at the square leg region and Wahab takes the catch quite comfortably. Another well-judged catch

"short of a length, drops it in front of point"
"short of a length and tries to pull the ball, Gets a mild top-edge that barely goes up. Wahab runs forward on the follow-through and snaffles it. Seems like Gul isn't feeling too good after copping that blow on the forearm, grimaces as he walks off"

He picks up the ball and throws it to Sarfaraz. And the keeper, for some sane reason, does not try to break the stumps. Had he tried to flick it back and hit the stumps, the batsman would have been well short. Think that is what Pietersen is telling his captain"
worked away through square leg
"what a catch! Samuels has another disappointing night. Amin was the substitute fielder, fielding close-in at forward short leg. Samuels tries to fend this short of a length ball off the hips. It is angled in on the body and he tries to flick it away, it hits the splice and seems to be flying over the forward short leg fielder but Yamin jumps up and back in a jiffy.

Seems to be hitting in front of middle and leg. Kamran does not seem happy for some reason as he trudges off. Wicket off the first ball for Nawaz. He got a glove on that, actually"

knocks it to mid-on with a closed bat face
defended off the backfoot
defended to the bowler
"Maqsood gone and this Peshawar are sliding drastically here. Tries to go inside-out from the crease but fails to get to the pitch of the ball. The ball goes in the air to extra cover where Shafiq jumps up to snaffle a good, sharp catch. That came to him quickly but he did well there"
"and what does he do! Holes out to long-off first ball. Tries to loft the spinner down the ground but he only gets the elevation, not the distance. Probably went off the bottom part of the bat and Nawaz runs to his right from long-off to snaffle it in front of the straight boundary. Irresponsible shot from the captain, and Sammy goes right back from where he came"
"oh my, oh my! Nearly had the hat-trick. What drama! Afridi comes down the track to this full toss and does not get hold of the shot as he lofts it over mid-off. Long-off comes running in and dives forward and the ball falls inches, just inches in front of him. Got to wonder, why would you play that kind of a shot off a hat-trick ball"

gets it to slide in with the arm. Afridi moves away to make room and exposes all three stumps. The bowler follows him and he makes the most of the angle to launch it down the ground as the ball crosses the boundary on the bounce
"it's the same thing again. Afridi makes room for himself and stays leg side. The bowler overadjusts and ends up bowling a half-volley, right under Afridi and he is able to use the angle and launches it over cow corner and this one sails clean over the fence"
"what a shot that is. Afridi moves the other way this time to protect off-stump and he plays a half-sweep, half-scoop as the ball goes off the top-edge to backward square leg. Saad Nasim, the substitute fielder, cannot get to it as he  runs back. Very tough chance"

pushes him back by generating pace. It's short of a length and the batsman jumps back to ride the bounce before bunting it straight back to the bowler
"what a shot! That is a glorious cover drive. Is that the shot of the night or what! Full ball just outside off, right in the slot for Hasan and he lays into a cover drive. Sarfaraz watches it and grimaces. Half-volley outside off and what a time to be playing that shot. Glorious"
"overcompensates after giving him room outside off in the previous ball. Short of a length and tries to cramp him for room by firing it on leg, only that the drift takes it further down and it is down the leg side"
"lucky boundary. Bowls it at good pace and that proves to be the undoing of Mills here. Short and outside off. Hasan slashes hard and swings wildly. The ball takes the top edge and it goes over the third man region, one-bounce and into the boundary. What a spell this was from Mills and it has gone horribly wrong in the last two balls"
"short and wide outside off, poor delivery. Afridi moves towards room to make himself room and crashes it square of the wicket, through backwar dpoint and into the boundary"
and that will be the game. What a heist from Zalmi. And Afridi the man. He never ceases to amaze and he has played a superb innings and pulled a rabbit out of the hat here. Slightly short of good length outside off and Afridi slaps it past the diving cover-point fielder
