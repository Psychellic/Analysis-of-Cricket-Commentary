"back of a length, angling across to off stump, opens up a little to try and work it leg side, but he's working against the angle and decides to defend instead"
"ooh, that's a loose shot. Fuller, but still on a good length, and a lot wider. Throws an angled bat at it and he's lucky not to edge that"
"length ball on off stump, uses his wrists to work it into the backward square leg region"
"back of a length, fifth-stump line, steep bounce. Amla lifts his bat high over his head to ensure the ball's safe passage through to the keeper"
"too straight, stays onto Amla's hip, and he tucks it away easily to the fine leg boundary. The fielder there is pretty fine, but not fine enough"
"length ball, fifth-stump line, left alone"
"full on off stump, clipped to mid-on"
"full again, a bit of late swing <i>in</i> to the left-hander, towards leg stump. Gets his front foot out of the way in time and clips to mid-on"
"too straight. A full one straying onto the pads, and de Kock works it nice and fine, and fine leg once again has no chance"
"back of a length, angling into middle and leg. Clipped to midwicket"
"bowled him, stumps flying all over the place! He's been looking for that full one angling in towards leg stump all through the over, and he bowls another. De Kock leaves a bit of a hole in his attempted on-drive - the result of his front foot not really getting forward at all - and the ball simply bursts through. Judging by how the rest of the over's gone, a definite plan from Boult - something to do with de Kock's lack of feet movement early on, and maybe the angle that his bat comes down at, from around gully or thereabouts"
"gets a full one first up, outside off, and he gets a good stride out to drive with an open face to the left of extra-cover. Big mix-up between the batsmen - not sure when exactly, because the TV pictures are a complete muddle - but Faf dives and makes his ground in time to beat his throw to the keeper"
"fullish outside off, left alone"
"back of a length close to off stump, hops in the air and defends towards backward point"
"in the blockhole close to off stump, jams down without too much fuss and keeps it out"
"length ball, quite wide outside off. No real front-foot stride to drive through the covers, and he sends a thick inside edge running away towards fine leg instead"
"full, angling into middle and leg, keeps his front leg out of the way and shows the full face to block it back to the bowler"
"ooh, that's a tight leave. On the shorter side of a good length, with a bit of nip back in. Doesn't seem to miss the top of off stump by much"
"short, but on a tight line close to off stump. Jumps to ride the bounce and just meets it with a vertical bat to send it rolling away between backward point and cover point"
"length ball, slanting away a touch wider. Left alone"
"shortish, at the body. Whipped off the hip to fine leg"
"wide length ball, left alone. Could have been called wide, but isn't"
"nicely bowled. Not quite as wide as the previous one, and on a length that's juuust short of drive-able. Two slips in place, and Faf ignores the bait"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended into the point region"
another wide-ish length ball - sixth stump or thereabouts - and Amla leaves it alone
"ooh, some swing on this occasion. On the fuller side of a good length, inviting the cover drive away from the body. Amla goes for it, and the ball swerves past his outside edge"
"full, angling into off stump. Amla looks for the cover drive, a hands shot with feet going nowhere. The ball doesn't swing this time - he's playing for swing - and it runs away through midwicket off the inside edge. Big gap between bat and pad - that could easily have gone through"
"length ball outside off, a bit of outswing. Faf leaves it alone"
"a touch shorter, swerves away sharply from a fifth-stump line, left alone"
"and again, no shot offered. Back of a length outside off, a bit of away swing"
"Ooh, that's some sharp inswing. A fullish length, and once again Amla's front foot goes nowhere. Tries to flick it hurriedly, following the swing, but his front pad is in the way. No appeal - the impact was outside leg stump and the ball was missing leg too"
"full on leg stump, clipped to midwicket"
"length ball on middle and off, shuffles across and defends into the on side"
"looks for that full inswinger again, ends up a touch too straight, and Amla clips it off his toes to the left of fine leg"
"length ball, straightens a little along the fourth-stump line. Defended off the front foot, into the covers"
length ball swinging in towards middle and off. Gets behind it and clips to square leg
"fullish on off stump, du Plessis plays a good-looking checked drive to mid-off"
"back of a length close to off stump, did that keep a tiny bit low? Du Plessis jams his bat down quickly and jabs towards midwicket, off the inside half of the bat"
"length ball swinging away lavishly, but the initial line is wide enough for du Plessis not to get drawn into playing at it"
"length ball, fifth-stump line, not as much swing - more a hit-the-deck type of ball. Du Plessis leaves again"
"ooh, that's a good ball. Full, fuller than half-volley length, and it swings away late from just outside off. Du Plessis was looking for a drive through mid-on, and he ended up opened up and edging thickly to the left of third man, where Lockie Ferguson makes a good attempt at a diving save. Looks like he's juuust kept it in with a strong swish of his left hand"
"length ball outside off, and again that shape away. Left alone"
"fullish, slanting into a wide-ish line outside off. Left alone again"
"length ball close to off stump, stays on the crease and pokes into the covers"
"shot! Given that Amla doesn't really get on the front foot to most deliveries, bowlers can occasionally try and go fuller to try and draw him forward. This one's got a bit of width on it, though, and not much swing back in, and Amla waves his wand of a bat at it - it's a diagonal bat, but does it matter when he connects so cleanly? - and sends it racing away through cover point"
"bam. Overpitches, on off stump, and Amla just shows it the full face and finds the gap to the right of mid-off"
"length ball angling across towards off stump, gets across and behind it and defends into the covers"
"ooh, good ball. Good length, slanting across into the corridor, and gets some extra bounce. Takes the shoulder of the bat as Amla props half-forward to defend, but he plays with soft hands and it doesn't carry to the fielder at slip"
"another good-length outswinger, sixth-stump line, left alone"
"good length again, closer to off stump. Judges it well and leaves it again"
"third leave in a row. Slightly fuller than the previous ball, on a tight line outside off. Sees the shape on it and leaves it"
"back of a length on off stump, punched to mid-on"
"back of a length on middle stump, clipped to the left of square leg, where the fielder makes a good diving stop"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"full outside off, and that's a good shot even though it isn't off the middle of the bat. It isn't a half-volley, and it's swinging back in, but du Plessis got a big stride forward, ensuring he reduced the width of the swing at the point of impact, and the ball rolled away to the right of mid-off off the inside half of the bat"
"length ball, straightens a bit outside off, not enough to make Faf play"
"shot! A touch overpitched this time, but again a big stride forward to ensure he's close to the pitch, and he drives between mid-off and short extra-cover"
"length ball, fifth-stump line. Presses forward, lets it come, and dabs to the left of backward point"
"shortish, off-stump line. Jumps to ride the bounce and defends towards midwicket"
"beauty. He's been getting consistent swing back into the right-hander, and this one just keeps going with the angle. Back of a length, pitching within the stumps and slanting away, and it beats the outside edge as Amla aims a back-foot punch at it"
"full and largely holds its line outside off, Faf presses forward and drives only as far as backward point"
"on a good length and wobbles away outside off, du Plessis thought about having a dip at it before belatedly letting it pass"
"fuller than a good length and swings away outside off again, Henry wants the two slips to come into play. Du Plessis doesn't. No shot"
"Henry makes du Plessis play and beats the outside edge. Good length, angling in close to off as du Plessis wafts at it. But the ball straightens away so very late to skip past the outside edge. Excellent bowling from Henry"
"Henry drags his length back, this keeps coming into Faf with the angle and cramps him for room. He awkwardly fends the ball to the off side off the back foot"
"on a length and moving away with the angle, not close enough to off to draw a stroke from Faf. <strong>End of a maiden from Henry</strong>"
"full and wide outside off, 142ks, Amla reaches out for the ball and carves to deep third man"
"pitched up and outside off, 137ks, du Plessis reaches out for a drive, but the ball wanders away to the leg side via a soft inside edge"
"keeps it full, attacks off stump now, du Plessis drives firmly but can't get it past mid-off"
"wide of the crease, full and holds its line outside off, <strong>145ks</strong>, Faf drives away from the body again and carves the ball fine of deep third man"
"shorter and outside off, <strong>Ferguson cranks it up to 145kph</strong> Amla jumps and jabs the ball away to the left of short cover"
"... but this is full and outside off, Amla threads the gap at point and <strong>reaches 8000 ODI runs. He's the second fastest to the landmark behind Kohli</strong>"
"on a length and outside off, driven on the up, just wide of Williamson at mid-off. He can't throw down the stumps either. A single is the outcome"
"on a length and floats away outside off, Amla simply shoulders arms"
"pitched up and on a fourth-stump line, Amla drives and finds mid-off"
"Williamson has deployed men at short midwicket and mid-on, but Amla hops, skips, and fends this short ball that is aimed at his body into that very gap"
"Henry hits a hard length on off, Faf covers up the line and defends back to the bowler"
"pitched up on off, right in Faf's driving radar. He stretches out and <strong>drives serenely</strong> past the non-striker and straight of mid-on to push SA past 50"
"back of a length and outside off, 146ks, Amla throws his hands at the ball and winds up mis-hitting it right back to the bowler"
"shorter and outside off, 147ks, Amla gets on top of the bounce and beautifully punches it away to the left of backward point and right of deep third man for three"
"really full on middle, Faf drills a drive but can't get it past mid-on"
"back of a length and outside off, 148ks, this pings into the boundary off the middle of the bat. The weight is on the back foot as du Plessis punches through the line - to the right of short cover and left of mid-off"
"typical fast bowler's response after being hit for a boundary. Bouncer, 149ks, aimed at the head. Faf keeps his eyes on the ball and rocks his head out of the way"
<strong>Ferguson yorks du Plessis</strong>. How do you even play this? Ferguson follows the 149ks bouncer with a 148ks missile at the blockhole. The short ball and the bouncer pushed Faf back. This one clatters into off stump. Ferguson aces the 1-2. Just too quick for Faf
"floats it up outside off, swings away further, no shot"
"overpitched and outside off, driven through the line to sweeper cover"
"good length and holds its line outside off, <strong>Markram spars at it and... misses</strong>"
"short and wide outside off, slashed away to cover-point"
"full and wobbles away late outside off, Markram covers his off stump and ignores it"
"floated full and swings away outside off, left alone once again, barely carries to Latham who is standing back"
"bouncer, angling in at 143ks, Amla drops his gloves and sways his upper body out of the way"
"short and wide outside off, 143ks again, Amla plays a long way away from the body. Has a mighty slash at it and watches the ball skip past the bat"
"back of a length and angling into Amla's back-foot defensive to the covers. They hare across for the single, taking on Santner's arm"
"full and speared in at off, 149ks, Markram closes the bat-face, and jabs the ball down to mid-on"
"pitched up and outside off, not quite a half-volley, but Markram leans into it and languidly drives it away to the left of short cover. Gorgeous front-foot drive - as gorgeous as his trademark back-foot punch"
"Ferguson runs in hard and hits the pitch harder. Lifter, angling in, and straightening away outside off. Markram has a lazy waft at it and is beaten on the outside edge"
"full and outside off, nibbles away, at least 25kph slower than Ferguson, Amla lets it go"
"off-stump yorker at 125ks, Amla jams his bat down on it and the ball rolls to cover"
"full and on off, barely 125ks now, Amla bunts it away towards mid-on"
"shorter and outside off, Amla camps back and flashes to backward point"
"full and on off, possibly an offcutter, the batsman is early into a drive and ends up <strong>spooning it away to the right of de Grandhomme</strong>"
"on a length and outside off, de Grandhomme finds awayswing, this leaves Markram and beats the outside edge. When he finds movement, de Grandhomme could be quite a handy option"
"drifts in outside off, full, driven to the covers off the front foot"
"tossed up outside off, this non-turner is eased down to long-off off the front foot"
"slower through the air, on a length on off, Markram hangs back and forces the ball down to long-on"
"on the pads, Amla whisks it away to short midwicket"
"on a length, <strong>hint of turn for Santner,</strong> driven with the break to the off-side sweeper"
"looped up on off, Markram is right forward to smother it and close out the over"
"shorter and hoops back into Amla, who is on the back foot, flicking and missing. The ball was doing too much to threaten the stumps. <strong>Latham reckons it was bouncing too much</strong>. The tracker returns umpire's call on leg stump"
"shorter and outside off, slashed away behind point"
"back of a length and outside off, punched up to cover"
"much fuller, another inswinger, it has Markram falling over the flick and playing around his front pad, but this is heading down leg"
"full on the stumps, defended"
"full and holds its line outside off, Markram chases a big cover drive and nicks an inside edge to the leg side"
"skidding into leg stump, back-foot punch down to long-on"
"tossed just a shade outside off, driven to Taylor at short cover"
"sliding in with the arm, clipped to short midwicket's left with that incoming angle"

"flighted on off, Markram presses forward and blocks it back"
"Santner keeps it tight at off stump, Markram responds with an equally tight forward defence"
"full, a bit of inward wobble as it angles in towards off and middle. Looks to punch straight, goes to mid-on off the inside half of the bat"

"length ball close to off stump, stays on the crease and a touch leg-side of the ball to block into the point region"
"back of a length outside off, takes a big back-and-across step, looks to punch towards mid-on, doesn't really middle it. The bowler moves across to his right to stop it"
"back of a length, a bit of width, slapped fiercely but straight to deep point"
"length ball on off stump, stays back and whips it to long-on with a lot of bottom hand"

"nice length, angling in towards off stump, defended down the pitch, towards the non-striker"
"a bit fuller, angling into middle stump. Gets his front pad out of the way and blocks it back where it came from"

"back of a length close to off stump, stays leg-side of the ball and carves to backward point"
"length ball on off stump, defended towards backward point"
"big step down the pitch and across his stumps, whips this full one from outside off to mid-on, and takes off in a hurry"
"fullish, is that sliding down leg? Bit of an appeal, but no review once the umpire gives it not out. Steps out of the crease, looks to whip through the leg side, the ball slides past his inside edge. Was probably missing leg"
"shortish outside off, slapped to deep point"
"length ball on off stump, whipped into the square leg region. The fielder has to come in a long way off the boundary and that gives them time to sprint two"
"full on middle stump, whipped to long-on"
"not quite as full this time, and the attempted whip to long-on is intercepted by Williamson diving left from short midwicket. Gets on his feet super quick and Markram has to hurry to beat the throw home at the non-striker's end"
"length ball close to off stump, jabbed into the point region"
"flat length ball on leg stump. Looks to push to long-on again, can't get it far enough of the bowler, who throws himself to his right to stop it"
"overpitched. Gives it a bit of air and loses his length, bowls a half-volley on off stump, and Markram brings all the power of his bottom hand into this drive to beat the diving bowler and beat long-on to his left"
"tossed up slow on off stump, better length, stretches out to defend towards short extra"
"back of a length close to off stump, whipped to mid-on"
"length ball close to off stump, stops on the pitch a little as Amla looks to drive on the up. Hits the inside half of the bat and rolls slowly towards short extra-cover. Wanted to drive to that fielder's left"
"short now, and again the ball stops on Amla. Wants to slap to deep point, ends up dragging it to short extra"
"shot. Goes full now, and he leans forward to whip this from outside off, over mid-on. There's a deep midwicket in place to mop up"
"full again, and this time he doesn't whip it in the air as much. It's just out of reach of mid-on throwing himself to his right, and it runs away quickly to bring up Amla's fifty"
"short outside off, carved to deep point"
"full on off stump, driven inside-out to the left of extra-cover"
"back of a length close to off stump, lets it come on and eases it towards deep point. That brings up South Africa's 100"

"back of a length close to off stump, punched to the right of the off-side sweeper"

"in the blockhole on off stump, blocked solidly to mid-off, ensuring his feet aren't in the way"
"short outside off, gets off his feet to get on top of the bounce, and rolls his wrists over to keep the cut down. Guptill, diving left from backward point, gets a hand to it, but can't fully stop the ball, which rolls gently through the outfield"
"nicely tossed up on middle stump, not full enough to drive, blocked back to the bowler"
"down the track now and Santner drifts one into his pads, to try and deny him swinging room. Looks to flick, ends up playing towards short fine leg off the inside half of the bat"
"shortish on off stump, rocks back and flat-bats to long-on"
"bowled him, that's slightly loose from Amla. Good ball from Santner, though, hits an excellent length and spins from middle stump to hit top of off. Amla, though, was trying to stay leg-side of the ball and play that with an open face, looking to dab into the point region, which is a risky shot if all you're looking for is a single"
"full on off stump, punched back to the bowler"
"back of a length on off stump, makes room for the push to deep point"
"hits a good length, gets a bit of inward nip to beat the inside edge of the attempted flick. Ricochets off the pad towards backward point, was probably missing leg stump"

"tossed up close to off stump, presses forward and eases it into the point region"
"tossed up slow on off stump, driven firmly to cover"
"shot! Tosses it up again and gives away a bit of width, but Markram still had to pierce the field with his drive - a cover, a short extra-cover, a sweeper square at cover point. He opens his bat face a bit to split cover and deep cover point."
"tossed up full on off stump, clipped away to long-on"
"flat, angling down leg, tickled away past the left glove of the keeper"
"flat and fairly full on off stump, blocked to short extra-cover"
"<b>Boult, of all fielders, drops a catch</b>. Wouldya believe it? He has misjudged this. He runs across to his left from deep square leg, the ball comes at him at a rather awkward height, but Boult makes life difficult for him by leaping. Both his feet are in the air as he goes for the catch with both hands. The ball ultimately pops out of his hands. Boult was never stable and Markram gets away with that airy pull off a hip-high short ball"

"slower short ball outside off, flapped away towards mid-on"
"Markram runs down the track to de Grandhomme and <strong>skews a catch to sweeper cover</strong>. Markram ventures down the pitch, de Grandhomme pulls his length back, and this nips away slightly outside off. Markam looks to swat it away over the leg side, but ends up splicing it to sweeper, where Munro runs in and snaffles it with a reverse-cup"

"short, wide, flayed away to deepish mid-off. Williamson can't throw down the stumps"
"cross-seam bouncer, angling away, <strong>nearly rips out Miller's glove</strong> as he fends at it. The ball dribbles away behind square on the off side"

"shorter and outside off, gets on top of it and punches out to sweeper cover"

"bouncer outside off, thinks of the pull but realises the bounce is too steep for that, and leaves it alone in the end"

"length ball outside off, flat-batted to the right of extra-cover"
"low full-toss at the pads, clipped neatly, excellent timing, to the right of deep square leg"
"misses out. On the shorter side of a length, but plenty of width, and he slaps it straight to extra-cover. There's an appeal for a run-out at the non-striker's end... VDD had raced out of his crease, and was sent back by Miller. Makes it home with a sprawling dive by the time Boult collects and breaks the stumps"
"short, rising ball over off stump, pulled hard into the turf, and the man at midwicket moves to his right to stop it. It's towards Santner's wrong hand, and they take on the quick single. Santner's throw misses anyway, with Miller diving to complete the run"
"on middle stump, gives himself room and pushes into the covers"
"shot. That's very well played. Boult's angling this full ball into leg stump, looking to deny Miller room to free his arms, but Miller clears his front leg, and makes light of the lack of room with a bottom-hand shovel that carries all the way over the straight midwicket boundary"
"short slower one, pulled to deep square leg"
"shortish, angling across to off stump. It isn't that short, actually, but he's picked the length super early and swivelled through a flat pull to the forward square leg boundary"
"too straight, whipped off the pads to the fine leg boundary. Fine leg was up, so not the greatest line to bowl"
"slower ball, angling away from off stump, gets on the front foot to drive to the right of extra-cover"
"slower length ball outside off, opens his bat face and steers to the right of third man"
"makes himself plenty of room and Ferguson bangs in a short ball, slanting away from Miller. The ball is rising steeply, and he's moving away from it's line, so he can't quite control the uppercut, ends up offering a catch to third man moving to his left. Good innings, though. He's given South Africa a bit of momentum"
"slower ball, back of a length on off stump, helped away through backward square leg, looking for the gap rather than for power - he was looking for two from the moment he played it"
"length ball, fifth-stump line, Phehlukwayo flashes a drive without moving his feet and can't make contact. Was looking to hit that through cover point"
"looks for the leg-stump yorker, gets a bit of inward reverse but the line's a little too straight. Tickled down to fine leg, not sure if it was bat or boot"
"extra bounce from a short length. Ends up cramped for room trying to pull a shoulder-high ball, ends up gloving it into his helmet grille. Ouch. Out comes the physio to check on van der Dussen's right thumb. A liberal application of magic spray"
"and he absolutely smashes this. Poor ball from Boult, half-volley on off stump, and he clears his front leg, leans back, and wallops this between the umpire and the non-striker"
"full on middle stump, fuller than the previous ball so he doesn't have the same room to hit it. Driven past the stumps at the other end but this time long-on can move around to stop it"
"in the blockhole, trying to follow the batsman outside leg stump as he looks to make room. Tries to stab it into the off side but it beats his inside edge"
"slower short ball on off stump, helped round to the left of fine leg, brings up his half-century. It's been a good innings so far, keeping his scoring rate up despite not getting a lot of boundaries"
"bouncer, gets up over head height and Phehlukwayo misses the pull"
"excellent slower one, doesn't miss the top of leg stump by much after Phehlukwayo clears his front leg, slogs, and misses"
"gone. Mid-off was in the circle, and he gets a full-toss from Ferguson, but it's at an awkward height, about two-thirds of a stump high, and it's quick - 144kph - so he's denied swinging room. Goes hard at it, the ball comes off the bat with a dull clunk, and Williamson takes an easy chest-high catch at mid-off"
"shortish in the corridor, hits the pitch hard and straightens to beat the outside edge of Morris' attempted dab to third man"
"beaten again. Makes a lot of room to try and slash over point, but this shortish one, over middle stump, is mid-140s again, and he's a touch late on the shot"
"slower length ball on off stump. Looks to make room to chop it into the off side, but ends up inside-edging it and it bounces into the turf by his feet"
"length ball on off stump, and Rassie puts it away. Clears his front leg and hoicks it over the square leg boundary. Dragged it much squarer than intended, off the inner half, but the square boundary on that side is pretty short"
"slower short ball, angling into the body, and that's <b>dropped</b> on the fine leg boundary. Pulled in the air, and Ferguson, coming in off the boundary and sliding forward on his knees, is in a good position to take it above his lap, but he spills it despite getting both hands under it"
"digs it in, back of a length, must have been the slower one, and Morris, looking to make room to free his arms, can only flat-bat it down the ground to long-on"
"slower ball, fullish and fairly wide of off. Looks to go down on his back knee and heave it over midwicket, but he swings too early and only manages to send an inside-edge rolling to the keeper"
"another slower one, shorter and closer to off stump. Grips the turf and keeps a little low, and van der Dussen ends up swinging above it, looking to pull"
"another slower one, fuller this time, but again wide of off stump. Van der Dussen looks to reverse-sweep, but can't connect yet again"
"maybe they can. Short one, gets up to shoulder height outside off. Morris looks to fetch a pull from there, ends up top-edging it to the fine third-man boundary"
"he wants to make room and go over mid-off, but this is quick and banged in short, so it rises above his attempt at a flat-bat hit over mid-off"
"makes room again and Ferguson attempts to follow him with a back-of-a-length slower ball. Too early into his flat-bat hit, and it rolls to mid-off off the toe end"
"now Rassie makes a lot of room, and Ferguson bowls another slowie - the legcutter is his go-to variety - pretty full outside off. Big swing, looking to go over mid-off, and he misses"
"wham, that sounded so good off the bat. Looks to make room again, and Ferguson goes short. But it sits up at chest height, within the batsman's hitting arc, and he absolutely hammers it over long-on"
"great finish from van der Dussen. Looks to make room again, and this time Ferguson tries to go full. Doesn't get it full enough, and he can get underneath it and drive it hard, back over the bowler's head. Mid-off is up, and long-on is too wide, so it runs away for four to edge South Africa past 240"
"full, angling in at off, and swinging away a wee bit, Guptill pokes towards backward point, where the fielder swoops down on the ball"
"on a length and angling into the pads, Guptill flicks it and finds square leg"
"back of a length and slanting into middle at 142ks, Guptill drops the ball behind square leg and gets across to the other end"
"hang up the caution, NZ! Very full and angling across off, Munro spanks it through the line. Latches onto the width and <strong>utterly batters it through the covers</strong>"
"shorter and closer to off stump, Munro was ready for it. He stands up tall and strongly punches it between covers and mid-off"
"Rabada hits a hard length outside off, Munro punches once again, this time he can't pierce the off-side infield"
"<strong>welcome back, Ngidi.</strong> On a length, angling in, bouncing at off, tricks Guptill into playing the incoming angle. But this hits the pitch and wickedly straightens past the outside edge. Cracker first-up from Ngidi"
"pitched up, hint of away movement, squirted away to cover"
"shortish and outside off, glided down to deep third man for one"
"back of a length and on a fifth-stump line, not enough width for Munro to free his arms. Gets an inside edge that rolls away past the leg stump"
"on a length and outside off, driven on the rise to the left of short cover"
"back of a length and angling down the leg side, no shot, leg-side wide"
"full inswinger from wide of the crease, Guptill flicks and manages an inside edge to the leg side"
"Rabada has Munro caught and bowled. Banged in short from round the wicket, tucks up Munro for room, and rushes him for pace. Munro hops and inside-edges the ball onto his pad. The ball balloons in the air. Rabada runs in from his followthrough and gobbles it up to lift SA"
"back of a length and angling into middle from over the wicket, Williamson shuffles across a touch and defends it"
"back of a length and slanting in at off, Williamson deftly drops the ball in front of square leg and calls his partner through for a well-judged single"
"short at the body, tickled down to long leg for one"
"shortish and shoved down the leg side, the angle takes it away further, good grab from de Kock down the leg side. Wide"
"dug in short on off, fended away to the leg side to close out the over"
short and skids back in at 146ks to beat the inside edge and <strong>ping Williamson on the midriff</strong>
"Ngidi spins around for an lbw appeal. Umpire Llong does not budge, Faf decides against a review. Length-ball inswinger, Guptill plays around his front pad. Possibly heading down leg. Yup, misses leg stump by a long way, according to ball-tracking"
"fuller and outside off, Guptill slices a drive between covers and mid-off"
"good length and homing in at off, Guptill responds with a forward defence"
"back of a length and angling in at off, jabbed away to cover"

"shorter and just a shade outside off, Williamson leaps and drops it dead"
"on a length and outside off, Guptill walks down at the bowler, he has a mighty whooooosh at it.. and misses. It wasn't too far away from the off stump"
"half-volley on the pads, picked up and dispatched to the midwicket boundary. Duly flicked away"
"back of a length and Ngidi hits the deck, Guptill defends to cover with the bottom hand flying off the bat"
"<strong>ooooof, this is Guptill at his best.</strong> Fuller on middle, he presses forward, shows the full face of the bat and drives it stylishly to the left of Rabada"
"if you'd missed the previous ball, worry not. Here's the replay. Pitched up further and outside off, Guptill presses forward and creams it straight of mid-off"
"on the pads, glanced away towards long leg"
"short and sliding in at the top of off, blocked off the back foot"
"lifter outside off, Guptill swerves out of the way"

"off-stump yorker, squirted away to cover"
"back of a length and just a shade outside off, Guptill shows off his high elbow and punches to mid-off"
"on a length and outside off, holds up in the pitch, Guptill checks his shot and instead chips it over the covers. Smart stroke from Guptill"

"fiery bouncer outside off, 143ks, Guptill sways his upper body out of the way"
"much fuller on off, driven past the left of the diving bowler to mid-off. Rabada got a hand to it and took some pace off the ball"

"short outside off, stops on the pitch and the attempted cut turns into a flat-bat hit, along the ground, to mid-off"
"back of a length, angling in towards off stump. Williamson shapes for the back-foot punch but he's cramped for room, and he ends up defending into the covers instead"
"ooh, good ball. Back of a length, straightens along an off-stump line. Opens up Williamson a little in defence, and the ball hits the outside edge high on the bat and is in the air briefly on its path towards backward point"
"beautiful. Full, though not a half-volley, angling into off stump. Williamson brings his bat down as straight as humanly possible, showing a bat face as full as possible, and caresses it between the bowler and mid-off"
"back of a length, close to off stump, just lets the ball meet his downward-facing defensive bat and it rolls away to third man. Trademark Williamson"
"length ball on off stump, presses forward to block to cover"

"back of a length outside off, punched to deep point"
"back of a length, a little bit of width, punched firmly but within range of backward point, who falls to his right to stop the ball"
"full, angling in towards off stump. Again it stops on the pitch and Guptill drives a little early, looking to go through mid-off or cover, and the ball hits the inside half and rolls away through midwicket"
"length ball nipping in towards off stump, a bit of extra bounce. He's on the front foot and a little cramped in the end. Drops his bottom hand to defend into the covers"

"full on off stump, nice stride forward for a defensive push to mid-off"

"fullish outside off, opens his bat face for a punch to backward point"
"length ball on off stump, defended towards mid-on"
"a touch too full outside off, and Williamson leans into an effortless drive that bisects mid-off and short extra-cover"
"back of a length, not quite short enough to pull. Gets up to about stump height and he drags it away to the right of fine leg, off the bottom edge. An ungainly boundary to follow a pristine one"
"fullish, on the pads, clipped to the left of fine leg"
"short outside off, rocks back to cut it away to deep point"
"digs it in short on off stump, gets it up to shoulder height, and Guptill has trod onto his stumps! Swivels to hook it, doesn't quite control it, but that's the least of his worries as he loses his footing and slides into the stumps"

"flat, on the stumps, defended towards midwicket"
"full, angling down leg, and Morris strikes in unlikely fashion! Looks to flick it away, but only manages a thin tickle through to de Kock. The luck's been on South Africa's side for the last couple of overs, and suddenly this is anyone's game!"

"similar delivery, angling across, leans forward and steers with an open face towards third man"
"fullish, angling in towards off stump, presses forward and defends into the on side"
"back of a length outside off, punched to the right of deep point"

"ooh, not short enough for the back-foot punch, and the ball spins away sharply and Williamson gets a thick outside edge, flies away to the right of slip"
"floated up slow outside off, Williamson looks to whip to long-on, but hits it straighter than he'd like, and the bowler fields it to his right"

"tossed up wide of off, big legbreak, Williamson plays an uncharacteristic slog-sweep at it, and misses"
"flat legbreak, pitching on an excellent length and spinning from leg to off. Stays on the back foot and defends"
"Morris is on fire! Latham's been very uncertain against his right-arm-over angle, and this one's just back of a length, pitches on leg stump and seams away slightly to kiss the outside edge as Latham looks to defend off the back foot"
"lovely length, pitches within the line of the stumps and slants away, isn't more than half a foot outside off stump after Neesham leaves it"
"ooh, past the edge again. Back of a length, and the line is so good, so close to off stump, forcing Neesham to play, and he has a poke and misses"
"bouncer, angling across and rising neck-high over off stump. Keeps his eyes on it and sways away from the line"
"shot! That's a good-length ball, but this one slants into a pretty wide line and allows him to free his arms. Stands tall and slaps it away between backward point and cover point"
"full on off stump, driven to mid-off"
"tossed up on leg stump, presses forward and defends into the on side"
"tossed up slow on middle and off, nice stretch forward to block to short extra-cover"
"back of a length on off stump, punches past a diving short extra but mid-off moves quickly to his left to stop it. A bit of confusion between the two batsmen when the ball goes past the first fielder, but no harm done"
"full on leg stump, driven to long-on"
"nicely floated up across the left-hander, lands on a good length outside off. Presses forward, defends with soft hands into the cover point region"

"shorter and just a shade outside off, Neesham chops behind point and gets off strike"

"short and outside off from round the stumps, Neesham gets on top of it and secures a single down to deep third man"
"A lot of teams these days have a floating slip for Williamson. SA don't though. So, Williamson rides the bounce of this short ball and steers to deep third man"
"risky from Neesham for just one run. On a length and holds its line outside off, Neesham searches for a dab of his own and tickles it away to the left of Amla at first slip"

"back of a length and on middle and leg, punched off the back foot to the left of deep midwicket"
"pushed through outside off, driven through the line to short cover by <s>TJN</s> Neesham"
"Neesham has missed a full ball that dips late, and SA go up for an lbw appeal. De Kock reckons it pitched outside leg. Indeed, and it was just too full for the sweep. Bad shot selection from Neesham"

"darted down the leg side, Tahir gets away as Williamson sweeps straight to short fine leg"
"back of a length on middle, punched down to long-on"

"flatter and turns in, jabbed back to Tahir"
"darted fuller and around off, stabbed back to Tahir once again"
"tossed outside off, chipped in the air to short cover, where the fielder dives, but NZ still pinch a single"
looks like a googly. Williamson reads it and knocks it to the leg side with ultra-soft hands
"speared full on middle, Williamson punches down to long-on and <strong>reaches another fine half-century</strong>. Just a gentle raise of the bat from Williamson. NZ need him to be there till the end"
"shorter and angling into off, Williamson camps back and a whirl of the wrists fetches him a single to the right of mid-on"
"shorter and on middle, Neesham stays leg-side of the ball and guides it to point"
"shortish and on the hips, Neesham hangs back and forces the ball through midwicket"
"shorter and outside off, Williamson hops and drops it to point"
Williamson gets on top of a short ball outside off and glides it away behind point and to the right of deep third man
short and skids back in to catch Williamson in a tangle. He looks to work the ball away to the leg side. Off the thigh pad and the ball rolls to the off side
drifts a slower ball down the leg side
"short and shoved down leg again, tickled away towards fine leg"
"slower, short ball outside off, Williamson flat-bats it only as far as point. Pressure building on NZ"

"back of a length outside off, punched to deep point"
"bouncer rising steeply over leg stump, ducks low to avoid it"
"bit of an appeal for caught behind. A short one at around chest height, hops up and across to try and glance it fine, and I don't know what it hit, but there was a faint suggestion of something - thigh pad? - on it. Not the most convincing appeal from de Kock, and Rabada wasn't hugely excited either"
"full, ends up slipping a fair way down leg. Too far from Williamson to connect with the flick"
now he overcompensates with a wide one way outside off. Left alone
"shortish outside off, slashes hard and hits it finer than he wants, bottom-edges it to the left of the diving Amla at wide slip/gully"
"bouncer, ducks low and gets under it"
"back of a length outside off, whipped to mid-on with a lot of bottom hand. There are only three fielders on the leg side, so a big gap at midwicket that he really wanted to hit with that shot"
"short outside off, gets up to shoulder height, drags a pull around to deep backward square leg"
"half-volley on off stump, and Neesham puts it away easily. A nice flowing drive between the umpire and non-striker, and mid-on is up"
"length ball angling into off stump, blocked into the covers"
"there's that lovely Williamson drive again, on the up, except the ball is still stopping occasionally off this pitch, and it briefly hangs in the air on its way to mid-off, making Morris put his head in his hands"
"gone! Steered straight to the man at wide slip! Morris' over-the-wicket angle to the left-handers has picked up another wicket. Cross-seam, just short of a length, angling away from off stump, and Neesham leans back and steers it, probably looking for third man, but the ball bounces a little more than he'd like and he ends up hitting it straight into Amla's lap. Takes it well, falling to his left"
"length ball, top of off, leans forward and punches to the right of deep point"
"what a shot. What. A. Shot. It's overpitched, yes, on middle stump, but to time it like that, wow. Flicks it, casual as you'd like, and it almost carries all the way to the square midwicket boundary"
"full outside off, punched into the covers off the front foot"
"length ball on off stump, and that's a nice-looking clip into the backward square leg region, doesn't put too much weight on that shot so the fielder has to come in quite a distance off the boundary"
"tossed up full on off stump, clipped down to long-on"
"lovely flight on off stump, drops onto a length that has CdG half-forward and groping forward with his hands to defend. Thick edge rolls into the backward point region"

"middle-stump line now, gets forward to block it back to the bowler"
"wrong'un, goes back, stays leg-side of it - picked it easily enough - and shows the full face to pick up a single to long-on"
now de Grandhomme picks the googly. Tossed up slower and fuller. Gets on the front foot and defends solidly
"shortish, close to off stump, lot of bottom wrist to whip it into the midwicket region"
"full outside off, and de Grandhomme drives to the right of a diving backward point fielder, out to deep point"
"short on off stump, gets up to about chest high but stops on Williamson. Through his pull very early, and the ball hits him on the right elbow. Ouch!"
"shortish in the corridor, jumps to ride the bounce and punch firmly to Markram diving right from backward point"
"short outside off, only gets up to about waist height, and Williamson is ready and waiting, smacks a pull to the vacant midwicket boundary. Huge gap in that area given this is a 6-3 field with a slip still in"
"full, a bit of late inswing into the fourth-stump channel, driven smoothly to mid-off"
"wrong'un, fairly full and spinning into middle and leg. He probably picks it, but swings across the line, across his front pad, to hit it hard through square leg"
"flatter and quicker, punched down the ground, past the right hand of the diving bowler, to long-on"
"flighted full-toss on off stump, clipped to long-on"
"another low full-toss, nearly a yorker, on leg stump. Jabbed back to the bowler"
"again in that blockhole-ish region, more off-stumpish. Driven down to long-on"
"slower flight, googly, Williamson stretches forward and clips gently to the right of midwicket. A bit of hesitation from Williamson, but CdG, who's going to the danger end, is more certain, and he makes it home with a dive even as Miller swoops down and throws to the keeper"
"overpitched on middle and leg, clipped to deep backward square leg"
"You can put everyone in the world on the boundary, and it won't matter. Short ball, gets up to about chest height, and de Grandhomme is onto it so quickly, swivels and deposits it waaaaaaaay beyond the square leg boundary, up in the back rows"
"fuller, on the pads, clipped through backward square leg"
"slower length ball outside off, and Williamson is looking for that dab to third man, but the ball bounces extra, and he's suddenly unsure whether to play or leave, and it brushes his glove but bounces before it can reach the keeper"
"length ball outside off, lets it come and guides it to third man"
"back of a length outside off, punched to extra-cover"
"<b>ccaaaatchh</b> they cry, as Miller rushes to his left , trying desperately to get under the chip from Williamson. He reaches out a hand, hoping, praying, but it lands short of him! Williamson stands and watches it all, his heard beating a mile a minute, hating himself for mistiming a shot meant to go to long-on"
""
eases it through the covers
"<b>dropped by Miller</b> and it's another really tough chance again! De Grandhomme whips a googly off the back foot, hoping to clear short midwicket. But Miller leaps up and to his right, getting massive airtime, then he sticks out his right hand but it just doesn't stick"
"tosses it up on off stump, Williamson waits for it to spin and then taps it towards the off side"
"follows the legbreak - a mistake he doesn't normally do, but here he needs to put bat to ball and get runs, and because of that pressure, he plays a low percentage glide with half a bat and is beaten. <b>Waaaait, replays show Williamson bottom edged it!</b> De Kock didn't hear it. Tahir is appealing. He's shocked no one joins him and South Africa have missed out on a big big biiiiiiiiig break"
nudges a back of a length delivery to the left of short midwicket
taps a shortish delivery on off stump towards mid-on
"<b>wallooppppppppppp</b>! It's good to target de Grandhomme with the short ball. But when it's waist high, the big man can just swat it away miles over square leg"

"kicks up on Williamson, cramping him on off stump, and the New Zealand captain dabs it to the wicketkeeper's right"
chops the shortish delivery outside off to point
brings his wrists into play to deal with a slower ball looking for the top of off stump. Works it to midwicket
"another slower ball, and it sticks in the pitch, making Williamson's push to mid-on travel in the air for a distance. This is on a knife edge, people. South Africa can still make up for missing that review to get Williamson caught behind"
"full, slow and on off stump. Williamson blocks towards point. Good stuff. They realise the pitch is helping them when pace is taken of it"
taps a full delivery on middle to long-on
"<b>Oh my, a comedy of errors at Edgbaston</b>. Awful mix-up between the wickets. Miller fluffs a run-out chance and reprieves Williamson. This was another well-directed short ball at the body, comes off pretty slow off the surface. Williamson is early into the pull and wears it on his body. De Grandhomme wants a single, Williamson doesn't. Rabada, the bowler himself, swoops down on the ball. The throw is to Miller at the non-striker's end. He is in a rush. He is under pressure. He dislodges the bails without collecting the ball. What a big miss for SA. Is that the game?"
"fuller and outside off, no shot"
"good length, angling in and straightening away, takes the outside edge and runs away past de Kock to the third-man boundary. A slip might have gobbled that up"

"yorker on middle, jabbed away to deep mdiwicket for one"

"back of a length and outside off, de Grandhomme allows the ball to come on, then glides it to point"
"shortish and on off, de Grandhomme leans back and chops it away to point"
"full on the stumps, de Grandhomme is happy to sit back and punch it down to long-on"
"shorter and just a shade outside off, <strong>Williamson brings out the artistic dab down to deep third man</strong>"
"back of a length on off, chopped from the stumps wide of short third man. <strong>200 up for NZ</strong>"
"slower offcutter, full and outside off, barely 115ks, de Grandhomme has a crack at it and edges it between de Kock and short third man for a fortunate four"
"leg-stump full-toss, whipped away to deep midwicket. <strong>de Grandhomme has been middling everything today</strong>"
"slower short ball around off, Williamson hauls a pull to the right of long-on and comes back for the second"
"<strong>Ngidi has dropped it.</strong> SA's fielding has gone to pieces. <strong>Okay, this is a beamer</strong> - well above the waist. Williamson swivels and flaps it in the air to deep backward square moving to his right. It's all happening at Edgbaston"
"full and outside off, this free-hit is swung away to long-on"
"short on the hips, quietly glanced away to square leg"
"nice and full, slanting into the middle of Williamson's forward defence"
"fullish and homing in on off, pressed to the covers"
"cross-seamer, back of a length and outside off, can't bowl there. You will be dabbed down to third man"
"back of a length and kicks up outside off, beating de Grandhomme's lazy attempt to run it down to deep third man"
"<strong>ripping off-stump yorker,</strong> de Grandhomme is up to it, kept out"
"<strong>Mowed away to the wide long-on boundary and that's fifty for de Grandhomme</strong>. Born in Harare, playing for NZ at home away from home in Edgbaston. He turns out for Birmingham Bears in the T20 tournament here. Who writes your scrips, man? What an innings under pressure. Back of a length and outside off, he swats it away like a fly"
"slower short ball, sticks in the surface, Kane yanks his bottom hand off the bat and scoops it away over midwicket"
"slower cutter, nurdled to the leg side"
"overpitched and outside off, Williamson shovel-drives it with his bottom wrist to the off-side sweeper"
"slower ball, dips under his almighty swing. Beaten lavishly, this offcutter was barely 110ks"
"<strong>A catching opportunity ends up as a boundary. What're you doing SA? </strong>Miller runs in, attacks the ball for the catch, but the ball drops in front of him at deep midwicket. Rabada is at the edge of the boundary running round from deep square, he slides, but lets the ball go to the fence. Back of a length and outside off, de Grandhomme smites it away and gets away"
"slower ball, past the tramline, wide"
"another slower cutter, knocked to the leg side for one"

"shortish and outside off, now it's CdG's turn to run it away... but third man is up to stop the single"
"short and outside off, slower one at 117ks, slapped through backward point"
"South Africa finally hang onto a catch. Faf du Plessis gives SA hope. Oh man, what a game this is turning out to be! This is the slower one once again. Pitched up and outside off, right up the alley for de Grandhomme to muscle it into the stands. He only holes out to long-off. Is there another twist in this match?"
"Has that been dropped by Ngidi? Nope, that did not carry to him and he wears a wry smile. Slower cutter, grips in the pitch, chipped back, lands just in front of the bowler"
"pitched up and outside off, Williamson shovels it away with the bottom hand to wide long-on"
"slower offcutter, excellent execution from Ngidi from round the wicket, beats Santner. De Kock somehow grabs it awkwardly. Pressure. Pressure. Pressure. He didn't even get his body behind the ball"
"slower short ball outside off, swatted away to the bowler, smashes the stumps at the non-striker's and rolls down to long-on"
"<strong>That artistic dab from Williamson fetches him a crucial four</strong>. Slower ball, Ngidi rolls his fingers across the ball and pushes it outside off, Williamson waits for the ball to arrive, then glides it - like only he can - fine of short third man for four. First boundary for  Williamson after 38 balls, I'm told. Significant one"
"hip-high short ball on middle, Santner pulls and finds deep midwicket"
"<strong>Grant Elliott: 2015. Kane Williamson: 2019. New Zealand are having the times of their lives once again</strong>. What an incredible century from Kane Williamson. This was full and outside off, slower variation, Williamson picks it, drops down to one knee and smokes it away into the stands beyond midwicket. Williamson eases the helmet off his head and soaks everything in"
"<b>Williamson - you beauty!</b> It had to end this way, right? <i>That</i> dab down to third man. Back of a length and outside off, glides it away behind point and seals it for NZ like boss. He is the boss. Meanwhile, South Africa's World Cup hopes are effectively ended"
