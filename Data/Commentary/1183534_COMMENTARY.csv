"length ball around off, looks to defend on the back foot but it spins past the bat to hit him on the thigh"
"<b>a brilliant catch by Pattinson.</b> Tossed up outside off, Astle goes for the slog sweep, ends up top-edging it to the right of mid-off, Pattinson runs in, puts in the dive to his right and takes it with both hands. Burns too was running backward from cover but he was never going to reach there."
"length ball on middle and leg, tucked away towards short fine leg"

"length ball on middle and leg, tucked away behind square leg"
"<b>middle stump has been knocked out!</b> A reverse-swinging yorker, right on the money. Too good for Somerville who cannot get his bat down on it"

"length ball around off and middle, tucked away towards square leg"
"five in the innings, ten in the game. Nathan Lyon gets the main man. They are congratulating each other, so Henry isn't coming out to bat despite having his arm guard on in the dressing room. Was a length ball outside off, Watling went across and swept it behind square but failed to keep it down and Cummins made no mistake"
