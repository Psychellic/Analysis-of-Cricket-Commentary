"back of a length outside off, swings away from Vijay who shoulders arms"
"Vijay shuffles across, looking for a ball he can work into the less-populated leg side, and Praveen bowls his outswinger a little wider, on a good length, and produces a leading edge that trickles down to third man"
"length ball on off stump, pushed back to the bowler"
"fuller, much wider, Vijay reaches out for a square drive and can't put bat to ball"
"back of a length angling across, Vijay clears his front leg to hit over mid-on, and the ball swerves in just a touch to beat his inside edge and hit high on the back thigh"
"length ball outside off, pushed to cover point"
"down the track comes Vijay, and Sangwan looks to shorten his length a little. Doesn't matter to Vijay, who steps away to make a bit of hitting room and simply swats it over the long-on boundary"
"wide half-volley, and any batsman at this level will put that away to the cover boundary. Vijay just does it a little more elegantly than most, hitting it sweetly between extra cover and mid-off"
"length ball swinging into off stump, clipped to the right of mid-on"
"fullish outside off, Vijay gets his head over the ball for a gentle push towards mid-off"
"back of a length, swings in towards off stump to cramp Vohra for room. He lets it come to him and uses his wrists to play it to mid-on"

"length ball outside off, gives Vijay just enough width to caress it to the cover point boundary, on the up"

"back of a length, swinging down leg, tucked off the hip towards fine leg"
"length ball on middle stump, pushed to short extra cover. Vohra is eager for a single and Vijay - rightly - sends him back, seeing Finch close in quickly"
"length ball swinging into middle stump, and Vijay twirls his wrists to place that beautifully, to the left of short fine leg and to the right of deep square leg"
"length ball on off stump, and what a shot that is, just shows the full face and it races past the stumps at the other end and leaves mid-off sprawled uselessly to his right. Long-on runs around to stop it"
"slower ball on off stump, on a length, and Vijay gets forward, waits the fraction longer that the ball demands, and opens his bat face slightly to place that drive between cover point and extra cover"
"length ball close to off stump, driven straight to cover point this time"
"overpitched on middle and off, and Vohra drives it firmly down the ground, thumps it between non-striker and mid-off"
"<b>dropped!</b> Bravo runs in from deep midwicket as Vohra pulls in the air, the ball wasn't as short as he thought and hurried onto him. He gets both hands to it, on the dive, but the ball pops out as he lands. Vohra goes for the second, the throw goes to the keeper's end, and he has to dive to complete the run. They go upstairs to check, and he's okay."
"back of a length, angling away from off stump. Vohra pokes with leaden feet and misses"
"length ball on middle and leg, clipped to midwicket"
"this one's on leg stump, a little shorter, and Vohra flicks it away easily, up and over the square leg fielder"
"length ball slanting away from off stump and giving Vohra swinging room, and he uses it to flat-bat it in the air, to the left of mid-off"
"skidder slanting down leg, and Vijay looks to flick and misses. The ball hits him on the pad and prompts an excited but futile appeal from the bowler"
"on the pads again, a bit shorter, worked to deep midwicket"
tossed up wide of off stump and Vohra drags a sweep out to deep midwicket
"slowly flighted on leg stump, and that's asking for trouble with mid-on in the ring. Vijay simply gets his front leg out of the way and lofts that over the fielder"
"oh, excellent. If you're going to bowl that slow, that's the length you should bowl. Vijay comes forward to defend, is deceived in the flight, and it turns away to beat his edge and DK has the bails off quickly. They've gone upstairs for this... Vijay did drag his foot out, but he's pulled it back into the crease just in time."
"back of a length, flatter, on middle stump. Vijay goes back and works it away through midwicket"
"full, angling down leg. Vijay can't connect with the flick and it rolls off the pad into the short fine leg region"
flat length ball angling down leg. This time Vohra misses the flick and is hit on the pad
"again, this time a bit shorter. Vohra is playing for turn, looking to flick, and the ball slides on with the angle and hits the outside part of his pad"
"and again, a quickish length ball angling down leg. It's going in that direction because he's getting no turn, and it runs off Vohra's pad towards short fine leg"
"full on leg stump, clipped through square leg"
"flighted ball outside off, chipped in the air to the right of sweeper cover"
"wrong 'un, and Vijay plays down the wrong line, looking to flick on the front foot. Big lbw appeal but that was sliding down leg"
"tossed up outside off, slog-swept along the ground to the right of deep midwicket"
"and again, another firm sweep, but it's closer to deep midwicket and they can only take one run before Jadeja's throw rockets in"
"down the track now and he picks the right ball. It's tossed up high, and he meets it on the full and launches it high over the bowler's head for a 105m six"
"another really slow ball, and this one lands short, giving Vohra ample time to rock back and pull into the gap between deep midwicket and long-on"
"quicker length ball, sliding on towards off stump. Vohra lets it come on and dabs towards short third man"
"once again, Jadeja fires one down the leg side, and this time Vohra's pad isn't in the way"
"a little bit slower through the air, on middle and leg, and Vohra is quickly down on his back knee to slog-sweep it over deep midwicket"
"first an aborted appeal, then a bigger one, and the finger goes up. This one skids on from back of a length, and Vohra, looking to work that through the leg side, gets an inside edge into his pad. Jadeja was appealing for lbw at first, but he realised the batsman had hit that, and then he appealed for caught behind as DK ran to his right and grabbed the ball that had popped up gently off Vohra's pad"
"full on middle stump, jabbed back to the bowler"
"sees Miller coming down the track and bowls it quicker and shorter, and Miller plays an ungainly whip across the line, but he manages to hit it wide of short fine leg"

"slower ball, full outside off. Vijay gets on the front foot and opens his bat face to steer it to third man"

bouncer rising over middle and off. It goes through pretty quick and Vijay simply sways away from the line
"back of a length on middle and leg, tucked away gently into the vacant midwicket area, and they run two and challenge Jadeja's rocket arm as he sprints in from the boundary"
"slower ball outside off. Vijay looks to make room to drive through cover, and the ball grips a little, comes in just a touch, and that combined with the shot being played too early means he hits it straight back to the bowler"
steps away from leg stump to make room and Bravo follows him with a full slower ball. Vijay whips it out to deep square leg
"length ball sliding into leg stump, clipped to deep midwicket"
down the track and Jadeja fires it at his pads. Clipped to deep square leg
"back of a length on off stump, whipped to deep square leg"
"bowled him! Saw Vijay step away to make room for the inside-out chip over the covers, and he dragged his length back a bit and got it to turn just enough to go past the edge and hit middle stump"
"quiet, for now. Length ball on off stump, pushed gently to the left of short extra cover"
"down the track and this time Miller gets his front pad away from the line as Jadeja looks to fire it in and cramp him for hitting room. With the pad out of the way, he gets a clean, free swing of the bat in to launch that high over wide long-on"
"short ball on middle stump, swivels to pull it to deep square leg"
"looks for the yorker, gets his line slightly wrong and slips it down the leg side"
"slower length ball close to off stump, pushed down the ground with a straight bat. Long-on runs across in an enthusiastic diagonal to cut it off before it can reach long-off"
"bouncer, skids through at head height at 131kph and Maxwell sways his head away from the line"
"yorker, pinpoint, and it crashes into the base of middle and leg as Maxwell, looking to make himself room, misses the ball, looking to stab it through point"
"digs it in short outside off, and Saha jumps across to dab it to third man"
"now he's top of the pile all by himself. It's the slower yorker, that's a bewitching, dipping delivery that Miller plays across and all around. Stunning way to get to 300 T20 wickets, absolutely top delivery"
"Is that another wicket? Back of a length ball, sliding onto off stump, and it's dabbed towards point. The non-striker wants the single, and Saha sends him back. The throw is at the bowler's end, it's a direct hit, and Stoinis has to dive to get home. His bat is over the line. He will not be out for a zero-ball duck."
"tossed up on off stump and he shuffles across to clip into the vacant midwicket area, looking for two. Jadeja sprints across in his follow-through to keep it down to one"
"flat, fullish, on the pads, clipped to the left of short fine leg"

"length ball angling away from off stump, poked away to the right of backward point"
"looks for the slower ball and gets his line horribly wrong, way down the leg side"

"another middle-stump yorker, flicked away towards deep square leg"
"another slower bouncer, turns into Stoinis, who pulls it away to the right of deep square leg"
"wide, full slower ball, and Saha misses the flat-bat drive"
slower ball outside off and Saha shuffles across to work it to the right of deep square leg. More inside edge than intention there.

"fuller, angling into off stump, slugged away to deep midwicket"
"back of a length slower ball outside off, gets across and pushes to the right of extra cover. They take two by the time Raina sprints across and stops the ball with a sprawling dive"
back of a length slower ball angling into middle stump. Stoinis shuffles across to work it to the right of deep square leg
down the track and PK yorks him. Stabbed down the ground towards long-off
"looks to make room and he follows him with another blockhole ball. Saha times the straight punch brilliantly, but only manages to hit the stumps at the other end. They steal a single while it ricochets into the off side"
"in the blockhole again, jabbed down to long-off"
"looks for the yorker to follow Saha as he moves away from leg stump. It ends up as a low full-toss, and Saha chips it in the air, but on the bounce to long-off"
"another yorker, stabbed firmly into the ground and it bounces over the bowler. They take two this time while Bravo runs around from long-off"
"shot! PK's yorkers were getting a little predictable, and Stoinis steps across, exposing his stumps, and laps it away, over the keeper, to the fine leg boundary"
"wide, full slower ball, and Saha slices it high in the air. Kishan comes in from the cover boundary, dives, and <b>drops it</b>."
"another slower ball, and Saha slogs and misses"
"very full, wide of off, stabbed away to the right of sweeper cover"
"looks to step across for a scoop over short fine leg, but it's the slower one again, and he's through his shot too early. He misses the ball and it hits him on the pad"
"full outside off, swiped to long-on"
"slower ball wide of off, and this time Stoinis was expecting it. He stands still, sets himself up on a stable base, and drills the flat-bat drive hard, to the right of sweeper cover"
"Looks to make room to hit over the covers, and Bravo bowls a slower length ball, which he hits high - but not very far - over the on side. It drops into no-man's land as long-on runs in to try and catch it"
"yorker on middle and leg, and Stoinis - stepping away to make room - can only stab it to extra cover"
"another slower ball, back of a length, and Saha can't get any power on his shot as he clears his front leg and clubs over the top. Hits it straight to deep midwicket"
"slower length ball on off stump and now it's Stoinis' turn to hole out. Looks to make swinging room and launch it down the ground, and can only hit it down the throat of Finch running in from long-on"
"full, gives him a bit of width, and he drills his drive between extra cover and mid-off. Finch runs back from mid-off to stop it before it reaches the boundary"
"Axar steps out and Bravo slants the slower ball away from him. He slogs at it, and slices it high in the air off the outside half of the bat. Ladda comes in from short third man to catch it, but misjudges the catch, ends up having to reach out for the ball, and it slips through his fingers. The <b>drop</b> denies Bravo a five-for, but he's bowled outstandingly nonetheless"
"back of a length, swinging into off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"fuller now, and Finch is rooted to the crease as he looks to whip across the line. Swings in, beats the bat and hits the pad. Big appeal, not given. May have slid down the leg side"
"back of a length outside off. Makes room and has to reach out to hit the ball, can only flap it towards extra cover"
"fullish outside off, slogged in the air, on the bounce to long-on. Interesting field placement there. Deep backward square leg and long-on were the two fielders back for Finch."
"length inswinger on off stump, defended into the on side"
"stumped, off a fast bowler! That was excellent stuff. We all knew McCullum would jump out of his crease at some point, and Sandeep pulls his length back just a bit and gets the ball to shape away. McCullum pokes at the ball, which swerves past his outside edge, and he's stranded a long way down when Saha whips off the bails"
"length ball slanting away from off stump, left alone"
slower ball close to off stump and Finch doesn't middle the attempted hit over mid-off. Ends up skewing it high off the outside half of the bat - the offcutter gripped and left Finch a little - and it just manages to clear extra cover chasing back

length ball slanting away from off stump. Finch slices his drive to backward point

length ball speared in towards off stump. Finch uses the angle to nudge it through backward square leg
"length ball, looks to angle it into the left-hander, and overdoes the angle, slides down the leg side"

"slower ball and Raina holes out! He had stepped away from leg stump, looking to make room to hit over mid-off or extra cover. He had to reach for the ball, and played too early, and ended up scooping it to Johnson running back from mid-on to complete a very well-judged catch"
"slower ball close to off stump, punched back towards the bowler"
"slower ball again, but it's shorter, and there's some width too, and Finch stands still, waits, and cuts it away to the right of backward point"

"flat length ball close to off stump, stabbed into the covers"
"back of a length on middle stump, tucked away to deep square leg"
"super shot from DK. It's just a touch short, not too wide, but he's quickly deep in his crease to cut it away to the left of the sprawling point fielder"
"tossed up a little more, on middle stump, gets on the front foot to clip towards long-on"
"on the pads, quickish, a bad ball given the field he has, and Finch clips it away to the left of short fine leg and deep square leg has no chance to run around and stop it"
"tossed up on off stump, driven to sweeper cover"
"shortish slower ball wide of off stump, and however slow it is, it's still short and wide, and he bowls it with backward point and third man in the circle. Finch waits, gets on top of the bounce, and pierces the gap with a surgically executed cut"
"another slower ball, this one's a loopy full-toss on off stump, and he clips it down to long-on"
"full outside off, driven to sweeper cover"
"back of a length slower offcutter, and Finch plays it so cleverly. It cuts into him, towards off stump, giving him just enough hitting room to play a tennis-style swat down the ground, didn't hit it too hard, just timed it, and easily beat long-on running to his left"
"back of a length on middle stump, punched to long-on"
"loopy full-toss on off stump, and DK just shows it the full face and punches firmly down the ground, giving long-on and long-off no chance"

"tossed up on off stump, and Karthik loves to sweep, he places this perfectly, hitting it firmly to the square leg boundary"
"much slower, and gets some sharp turn away from off stump. DK looks for the cute lap sweep and top-edges it towards short third man"
"slashed away. It's short and wide again, and Finch slaps it fiercely and just eludes the fingertips of the leaping backward point fielder"
"he's walking. That was an excellent bit of bowling. He's achieved turn by bowling it slower, and he's done it again. It drops on a good length outside off, shorter than Finch expects as he stretches out to it, and all that stretching leaves him far out of the crease when it turns past his defensive bat, and Saha completes the stumping quickly and efficiently. Finch is livid with himself, throwing his gloves down as he crosses the rope on his walk back"

"length ball on off stump, blocked studiously into the covers"

"back of a length close to off stump, makes a bit of room and stabs it towards point"
"reverse-sweep, and that is smart thinking. He had a slip and a backward point and no one in the vast expanse between those two. Karthik saw a bit of flight and a bit of room outside off stump, and was able to execute the shot easily as a result"
"fired in full at the pads, and it hits the pads and dribbles down towards fine leg after Jadeja misses the flick"

"ooh, nearly another run out. Kishan stretches out to this tossed-up ball on middle stump, and it dips and turns in as he looks to flick, rolls off his pad into the leg side. DK quickly calls Kishan through for the single, and Kishan has to dive at the non-striker's end. Direct hit would have made things interesting"
"back of a length outside off, stabbed to backward point"
"slow flight outside off, swept in the air, but bounces well short of the deep square leg fielder"
sees him coming down the track and fires it quicker. Kishan looks for the big hit with the turn and inside-edges into his pads
"down the track again, fired in flat outside leg stump, whipped in the air, on the bounce towards deep square leg"
"googly, but it starts outside leg stump, and Kishan plays this very well, a straight-bat paddle sweep - Sachin Tendulkar used to play this shot in this manner - into the gap to the left of short fine leg"
"down the track comes Karthik, and makes a bit of room to flat-bat the fullish ball powerfully in the air, wide of mid-off"
"shortish outside off, dabbed to the left of backward point. Takes off for the single, not realising that Axar throws left-handed. Axar's throw at the keeper's end misses, with Karthik stranded halfway down the pitch, and they complete the single with a sigh of relief"
"slower bouncer, and Kishan misses the pull"
"fullish on off stump, not full enough to deny him swinging room or elevation, and he simply swipes this away, cleanly over midwicket"
"down the track, stepping away from leg stump to make some room. Johnson fires it full and wide, making Kishan reach for the ball. He goes after it, slices it high in the air, and Mohit Sharma takes a simple catch at backward point, but only after juggling it a couple of times. That ended up stuck in the crook of his elbow."
"back of a length on off stump, and what a shot that is from Karthik! Punches it firmly, full face showing, and his feet go off the ground at the point of impact. The ball races away between non-striker and mid-off"

"slower ball wide of off, and Karthik spots it early, clears his front leg, and flat-bats it hard to long-on"
"slower bouncer outside off, Bravo plays a controlled pull out to deep square leg"
"down the track and he spots the slower short ball quickly, gets into a lovely stable position, and pulls it witheringly to the left of deep square leg to seal a comfortable win, on debut, for Gujarat Lions"
