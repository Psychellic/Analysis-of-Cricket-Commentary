"<b>dropped at deep square.</b> Short ball on middle stump, whips it off the front foot and gets it to Asif Ali's right. He's lost the ball - or some of his vision - in the floodlight and therefore has to force a dive to his right in the end. Too difficult by then"
<b>dropped at third man.</b> Shinwari has over-run. Short of a length ball across the corridor. Has a hack across the line and gets a leading edge to the fielder's right.

low full toss curving away marginally from off stump. Has a swish as this and slices to sweeper's left
"<b>you could sense it coming!</b> The wrong'un. Didn't take too much nous to predict Haris would be running down the pitch. Wanindu lands this wide outside off and turns it away from a length.

This one is floated up full on middle stump. Imad makes a lot of room and drills this over the bowler, flat. Long-on takes it with a reverse-cup with a couple of strides to his right"

He stays put in the crease because that's in the zone, but it appears he's too eager to send this a long way. The loopy delivery ends up coming off the toe-end and it's Wanindu again, clogging it up for Pakistan"
"<b>just evades long-off!</B> Another mis-hit, but there's just enough. Tossed up outside off, his feet are pointing midwicket, his head has whip-lashed into the fine leg direction, and his bat has turned. But he's managed to squeeze it over the boundary"
