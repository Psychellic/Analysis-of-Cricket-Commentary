"tossed up on middle, Doolan works it to midwicket"
"twitchy feet from Doolan, wanting to come down the track, but the 94 kph delivery doesn't let him. Nudge to midwicket"
launches it into the sightscreen! Powerful strike! And this time he is able to shimmy down the track and to enable the hit through the line
"another trip down the wicket, but this time the ball is fired into his pads and is glanced away towards the long leg boundary. The 46-year old Brad Hogg chases after it and manages to pull it back"
"shuffles across and clips a good length ball from outside off through to deep midwicket, and with little protection down there, Cooper has to field the ball himself"
turns a good length ball on middle to short fine leg

"short-arm pull in Ponting country! This really isn't all that short, but Doolan rocks back and nails it through the gap at midwicket"
"full and outside off, Doolan drives it to the left of cover"
another cover drive and the 140 kph near-yorker ends up in the fielder's hands
"<b>beats him</b> for pace and bounce. Richardson pulls his length back, and by hitting the seam, he gets the ball to straighten enough"
"<b>top edge over the keeper</b>! Doolan does not look happy facing that much pace, coming straight at his head. He's trying desperately to pull it, but it's onto him too quickly"
"full and outside off, crunches it to mid-off"
"127 kph, wide, and back of a length - essentially the perfect ball for Short to smash over midwicket. Goes for it, but does not connect"
helps it over the square leg boundary! Super timing from Short - that's the long boundary and he clears it easily. The short ball - well pace really - is not the thing to attack him with
"hammers it through the covers this time! There is nothing wrong with the delivery. Good length ball outside off, from around the wicket, but Short has such great hand-eye coordination"
"shuffles back and flick-pulls the short ball off his hips towards the backward square leg boundary. Neat placement, he knows fine leg is up and he only has to give the ball direction"
"back of a length and on off stump, Short pats it down the ground"
"shortish and outside off, cuts to point and there is enough power on it to make Bravo misfield"
"gets down the track and lifts it over mid-off. Finch is the man tracking it down, running back and to his left. But the ball lands just beyond his reach"
"lashes a slow, tossed up delivery outside off to mid-off. He's not going to be shy about going for his shots."
chips a length ball - a non-turning length ball - to long-on
shot! This is slung down at 106 kph and is sliding down leg. Short gets down on one knee and wallops it to the square leg boundary with both fielders inside the circle
"full and quick but right on middle stump, so Short can only defend"
"pitched-up slower ball, he picks the variation up and deposits it to the 55 m boundary on the leg side."
"shortish and outside off, dabs it to short third man"
"there's the slower ball again - very full in length and swinging into the right-hander. Doolan looks for a big hit, but the ball dips on him and he gets an inside edge to short fine leg"
"full toss, and he misses out again. Inside edge onto pad and only a single to cover"
"nails the full toss, which also has width on it, through the covers. Still base, fast hands"
looks for the yorker and Short drives to long-on
"starts with a slower ball, nice and tight on middle, Short sets up for a big shot, but then defends with soft hands because of the lack of room, and and pinches a single"
<b>doesn't carry</b> as Doolan looks for a big biff down the ground and nicks to the wicketkeeper on the bounce. Lack of pace almost working against Bravo there
"bouncer now, at top speed, and Doolan lets it pass him by outside off"
back over the wicket for a full delivery outside off - slow as well - Doolan drills it to cover
"that's good shot! He is ready for the slower ball, and loves that it is short and wide as well. Only has to wait a touch to find the placement in front of point"
"outside edge straight to short third man. He has bowled about a million of these in his 370 matches and they've always got the man. Full, tempting, outside off. Everything right for that big hit over the bowler's head, which is what Doolan tries to do. But he's into the shot too early and has to walk off"
"short and down leg, Short pulls to long leg"
back of a length and decking back into the right-handed McDermott. Blocks well.
"full and outside off, he presents a lovely cover drive for all to see"
on the pads and McDermott flicks it away to deep square leg.
"absolutely smashes it to the point boundary! This is an attempted bouncer, and but the width on it makes the cut possible. Gets up on his toes and uses the bottom hand to both keep the ball down and power it away. Super shot."
"short, slow, and into the body. Short works it to deep square leg"
"loops it up outside off, McDermott drive to long-off"
"<b>lbw!</b>. That's off the front of the hand, meant not to spin. Short, however, is loading up the sweep, wanting it to turn away so he has the room to pull the shot off. And when he doesn't he is just stone dead."
"full and outside off, drives to long-off"
manages to plant a straightish bat down in front of his pad to save himself from an lbw and also find a single to long-on
"short ball, which Bailey reads early, makes room to cut but can't find the gap at cover"
whips the flatter delivery through to deep midwicket
"full and swinging into the right-hander, McDermott works it away to deep midwicket"
gets up tall with the shortish delivery outside off and forces it to point. A misfield allows him to pinch a single
"back of a length and outside off, he punches to extra cover"
"shortish on off stump, blocks it down the pitch"
"full and slow outside off, Bailey looks to smash it through the covers, but it's too wide"

chips it through the covers to retain strike
down the track for a little flick through midwicket as Nabi gets the tossed up ball to dip just in time
"good shot, shifting his weight back against a shortish delivery outside off and slices it through point"
"down the track, but Nabi bowls it flat and tight on middle. Bailey flicks to deep midwicket and gets two off the long boundary"
"shortish and outside off, but that's probably because Bailey is coming down again. Drive to extra cover"
"shapes for a nudge through midwicket, but this tossed up delivery doesn't turn. Actually, if anything, it straightens and takes a leading edge"
"goes or a reverse sweep, and he finds the boundary, the first in about three overs. Flighted delivery on off stump, which merits a push through cover instead ends up at third man thanks to some timely innovation"
pulls the long hop down leg. Brutal hit to the short boundary
jumps back to a flatter delivery on off stump and whips it to deep midwicket
"slog sweep and it thuds into the advertising hoardings at deep square leg. Good long stride forward, the front leg going outside leg for a free swing of the bat"
"pulls it away! This one is short, it is the wrong 'un that goes totally wrong - allowing McDermott to get under the ball and have the room to swing hard"
"hard sweep - and he makes sure to find the gap too, to the right of long-on! Flat, hard, vicious"
"tosses it up, makes it drift away from the right hander just enough that McDermott is happy clipping it through to deep midwicket"
skips down the pitch and is able to work a 107 kph delivery on off stump to the right of long-on. Places it well for a couple
"shortish and outside off, McDermott taps it to extra cover"
"dropped, but these simply have to stick! Poor Ludeman. He watches a full-blooded reverse sweep come off a top edge, the deflection is sizeable enough to throw him off."
""
"shortish and outside off, goes for a cut and misses making contact"
"another one that is quick, and it's nearly yorker length on middle. Bailey works it to long-on"
smashes the length ball outisde off to long-off
"looks to bring the short leg side boundary into play by shuffling across outside off, but Wildermuth does well, taking the pace off and bowling it wide. Single through the covers"
"slower ball outside off, Bailey slogs it away to square leg off the inside edge"
"full and outside off, McDermott drills it to the sweeper cover"
wide yorker and Bailey can only steer it away to deep point
"gets down the track, but Wildermuth keeps the line wide outside off so that the batsman has to reach and therefore loses his timing. Only a single through the covers"
around the wicket for a back of a length offcutter. McDermott chops it to cover
"that's at top pace, and quite wide outside off too. Bailey, making too much room outside leg, skews a shot meant to go over extra cover out to deep point"
"over the wicket to McDermott, who is also running away to the leg side and is left beaten by a slower ball outside off"
"straight up! Big skier, big big skier, and who's under it? It's the captain! That's a super catch from Finch and another wicket for Bravo off the slower ball. He lobs it up high above the batsman's eyeline, so McDermott looks for the bash straight down the ground. Only the ball starts to dip, and does so sharply. He ends up not being to the pitch of it. He's through the shot too early as well. All of that combines to make sure the ball goes only as far as mid-off"
"full and outside off, Bailey slices it to backward point"
"slower ball outside off, clips to long-on"
"starts with a googly, which Christian reads by playing back. Cuts to deep point"

"tosses it up onto off stump, Christian drives to mid-off"
beats him outside off with a good length ball that skids through without turning
slogs a shortish delivery outside off to deep midwicket
"gets across outside off to nudge a quick, flat delivery into the midwicket region"
"lack of turn does him in! Good bowling from Nabi, spots Bailey racing down the pitch, and so he fires in a quick delivery outside off. It bounces over the top edge and Ludeman, the wicketkeeper, does the rest"
appeal for lbw as a 96 kph delivery from around the wicket skids on past the flick shot and pins the front pad. Umpire probably thinks it might have missed leg. <b>Ball tracking says umpire's call</b>
manages an inside edge to a good length ball outside off. Single through midwicket
"full and outside off, pushes to mid-off"
"short ball, meet short boundary. Christian does not time the pull properly, a little bit of extra bounce means contact is high on the bat, but it doesn't matter. Still pulls it high over midwicket"
"full toss outside off, smashes it to long-on"
beaten by the slower ball outside off while trying a cut
opens the face and slashes a full length ball outside off over point's head
"full toss on off stump, gets on Christian a touch earlier than he expects and so the biff over long-on ends up at deep point's hands"
"yorker on leg stump at top pace, Christian drills it to long-on"
reads the batsman's intent to charge out of his crease and slips the wide one past his reach outside off. Christian slips and falls on his feet. The umpire calls that too wide as well

goes for the sweep shot - considering Bravo is constantly bowling slower balls - and gets a top edge to long leg
"bouncer now, coming up at  Wade's head.He goes for the hook shot and miscues it to short third man"
walks down the pitch and has to get down low to meet a dipping slower ball on leg stump. Single to deep square leg
walks across outside off and deals with a yorker outside off with a flick to wide long-on
"back of a length, and off pace, Christian looks for a pull shot but doesn't connect"
"clears the front leg and goes bang straight down the ground but that's gone so very high. Has it gone long? Noooo. Cooper racing in from long-on takes a splendid catch! Has a lot of ground to cover, has to keep his eyes on the ball as well, these are the catches that make the nerves jangle. There's too much work to do, to much time to think about them. But he makes it seem so easily. Good work from Richardson as well, bowling the slower ball to a batsman desperate for a big heave"
"full toss outside off, pats it to point."
"full toss outside off, blocks. Blocks in the 19th over."
"full and outside off, he swats it to long-on"
"launches it over midwicket... or tries to, at least. But all he does is pick out Richardson. Slower ball from Bravo again, but the batsman guessed it would be so, walking across to hit over the leg side. The problem is the ball holds up in the breeze and becomes an easy catch"
"yorker at 126 kph on off stump, Wade gets a bit of a leading edge to short third man as he tries to flick it away"
slogs at a slower ball outside off and gets a thick outside edge to the third man boundary. The fielder was up inside the circle
"slogs it out to deep midwicket. That's Bravo's fourth wicket, and all of them are off slower balls. Boyce has to drag it from outside off, and he's into the shot too early, miscues it straight to Nabi"
"slogs it over deep midwicket! Full, slow and wide. These are the balls that Bravo has used to beat batsmen tonight But Wade waits on it just long enough and nails it"
"<b>It's Bravo's 400th wicket in T20s, the first bowler ever to the mark</b>! And he really should get a cold one for Ludeman the wicketkeeper for taking this catch and giving him a five-wicket bag too. The batsman has been deceived by another ball - pitched up and well wide of his reach outside off. Goes for the slog and ends up hitting it straight up into the stratosphere. If there are astronauts up there, look out! Ludeman runs after it and takes it with a dive somewhere near short midwicket"
full toss at the stumps has been hammered through the covers. Finch is standing outside leg to have the room to bulldoze past the off side infield
"that's gone hiiiiiiiigghhhhhhh and it's very well taken by Wade! Excellent bowling from Rose, to bowl slower through the air after being smashed. He keeps it wide as well, meaning Finch going for a slog sweep is trying to drag the ball across the line. Top edge results and Wade rushes forward to take the catch and sprawls in the middle of the pitch."
"goes on with the arm, and its fairly rapid as well. White gets an inside edge while defending"
"quicker delivery on middle, defends"
"looks for a push down the ground, but healthy drift, and a tiny bit of turn gets the leading edge to point"
"short and outside off, slaps it to long-off"
"starts with a bouncer, but the direction goes wrong. 139 kph delivery wanders through to the wicketkeeper"
"wallops the short ball outside off to the square leg boundary. Sexy shot. He's on the front foot and absolutely belts the ball, showing pace is nothing big against him"
"the shortish delivery slips down leg again as White flicks and misses. Mills is cranking it up, that's at 141 kph"
around the wicket for a 138 kph delivery that bounces waaaay more than White has bargained for. He tries to run it down to third man and is just about able to do so
"back of a length and outside off, White defends and gets an inside edge that gets locked between his legs and ends up near the stumps"
"spears a drive through the covers, getting calmly behind the 143 kph half-volley outside off"
"<b>148 kph</b> short ball outside off and it rises well above the flashing blade of White. But with it being the second bouncer of the over, the umpires have called it a no-ball"
"<b>free hit ball</b> is a slower ball, and White, set up for the full-length, top pace delivery, hanging back in his crease, the front leg cleared away, outside edges the ball over short third man"
"there's the slower ball - so slow that it is clocked at only 107 kph. That's a 40 kph difference in speed and yet there is no change in his action. Or length. It's pitched short. The batsman is set up for a glide to third man, and then has to wait ages for the ball to catch up with him"
good length ball on off stump at 141 kph. It straightens as well to take the outside edge to point
slogs at a 139 kph length ball on off stump and gets an inside edge to long leg
"140 kph, drives to mid-on, and Christian really should have done better. Runs across to his right, dives to collect the ball and simply mucks it up"
"short ball, outside off, mistimes the pull to mid-on. Too much pace, too much bounce for Harris' liking"
drives to cover
"goes for the front foot pull again, and this time he skews it back to Archer. Pace, serious pace, at 143 kph."
"142 kph, good length ball on off stump. Gets it to straighten and hit high on White's bat"
"the angle from around the wicket takes the 146 kph delivery onto his pads, White clips it to short fine leg"
"full, fast and straight and it's a direct hit from mid-on. This is close. But White made sure he had his skates on and completes the quick single. Nudge to mid-on brings Aaron Summers into play, who can supposedly bowl 150 kph."
"<b>149 kph</b> and it beats North, who is stuck in his crease looking to cut a wide delivery. Whooosh!"
that's a fine shot! Takes a length ball at 147 kph and on his pads and effortlessly lifts it to the wide long-on boundary. Gets behind the ball even at that pace and puts it away handsomely
shortish and outside off and the 147 kph delivery is tapped through extra cover
"full and outside off, gets down the pitch and drives through cover"
hares out of his crease and heaves a length ball outside off past mid-on's right. White doesn't think Rose can spin the ball and is happy to rush him
down the track and a tossed up delivery on leg stump becomes a full toss. White works it through midwicket
"length on middle, clips it to short midwicket"
"gorgeous shot through cover! It's pitched up, it's wide, it's asking to be hit and North plays it away perfectly"

"back of a length and outside off, swings it out to deep square leg..."

"goes for the bouncer, at 147 kph. White goes for a pull shot, off the front foot, and misses it"
"another short ball, but this one strays down leg. The slower ball from Summers."
back of a length on off stump at 150 kph. White blocks it to midwicket and looks for a single. It's not there and Harris has to rush back in his crease

"short and going on with the arm - even the wristspinner, going for a wrong 'un, isn't getting turn off this pitch. Harris cuts and misses"
back of a length and a shade outside off. The lack of room is why White cuts it down towards mid-off
"slower ball, dips under the bat swing of White as he looks to go over long-on. Shout for lbw, but denied. Impact might be a touch outside off"
"dropped by Wade, and this is a seriously tough chance. He leaps to his left, making pretty good ground. But the glide to third man takes just enough bat to elude him"
pulls it away as he gets on top of the bounce and swivels on his back foot to complete the shot
"full and down leg, flicks it through midwicket"
"low full toss, which he slices to the backward point boundary. Lovely shot, opens the face deliberately to pick the gap"
"short and wide outside off, White jumps back, makes room and crashes it through the covers. He's on a roll"
"picks the gap with the cut shot again! This one's even better because he really doesn't have much room to work with. Leaps back, makes enough room to bring his power into play"

"loops it up way wide outside off, Harris might have got a wide if he had left it. Instead, out comes a slice to deep point"
crunches a shortish delivery outside off to cover
quicker delivery on middle keeps White quiet
"starts with a slower ball, the one out the back of the hand and hits on the seam. North looks for a slice and misses altogether"

"looks for the pull against a 142 kph delivery, but the ball thuds into his gut"

"back of a length and outside off at 146 kph, pulls to long-on"
"short and on off stump, Hodge avoids it"
nearly outta the ground! Takes on a length ball on leg stump and slogs it away over square leg like a boss. Dude was coaching an IPL team last year. Here he's showing how its done
"short and outside off, doesn't bother with it"
"looks for the yorker at 143 kph, Hodge tries a clip through midwicket. Only gets an inside edge"
"151kph, top edge lands before long leg can run forward and get to it. Another very pacy short ball that the batsman takes on with the pull shot. Even one as set as White can't quite deal with that much speed coming straight at his head"
sensational timing! He's backing away. He's reaching out away from his body - Christian doing well to plant the ball outside off to try and ruin White's prospects of a boundary. But he somehow hits it so very cleanly that it almost hits the rope on the full at extra cover

"bouncer at 141 kph, homing in on Hodge's head and neck even as he makes room. He tries the hook, but the ball clears the top edge"
"there's the back of the hand slower ball, perfectly in line with middle and off stump. Hodge is again looking for that belt through extra cover. He realises he doesn't have the room, and then has to adjust to the lack of pace too. Lucky he isn't lbw"
"another slower ball, but it's a half-volley outside off and White hammers it to the extra cover boundary"
back of a hand slower ball again - at only 109 kph - and White is badly squared up. He shapes for the swat over mid-on. Then ends up dabbing the ball behind the wicket

"140 kph, beats White's cut shot, and the ball wanders right on top of off stump too. Good line, consistent pace."
