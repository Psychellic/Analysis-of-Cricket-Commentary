"<b>huge lbw appeal as Guptill shoulders arms</b>. India don't go for the review saying it was too high, signalling to a spot on his thigh. Insane batting from the opener. Even if the good length ball hadn't nipped back in, that is way too close to the off stump. Guptill lifts the bat high over his head. Then looks straight at the umpire deciding his fate. Shaun George says no. Ooooh, that was close!"
""
"<b>plays on!</b>. Reward for ridiculously good line and length. And honestly, it almost seems as if Guptill hasn't been picking Shami out the hand. Hasn't been comfortable with the way the ball is coming out. This one hits a length on and around off stump and wobbles back into the right-hander, he's too slow with his forward defensive and it piggy-backs off an inside edge and crashes into the stumps. <b>Hundredth ODI wicket for Shami - the fastest by an Indian in ODIs</b>"
lovely bowling! It's full. It's on target. It forces Williamson to respect it with a straight bat held in soft hands
"back of a length on off stump, taps it to cover point"
"full and outside off, crunches it to mid-off"
"nice and tight, never giving the left-hander any room. Munro has to stay patient and he's showing he can, defending the ball with gusto"
"<B>whips it away to square leg</b>! That's his shot. The one he plays as he wakes up groggy from sleep, barely aware of what he is doing. Gets the ball on his hips, swings it away with class"
"off the bottom of the bat! But again, this is a small ground with a fast outfield and Munro has taken care to loft the ball over mid-off"
"back of a length on middle, Munro knocks it to midwicket"
"<b>shooooooootttt!</b>. That is just pristine, like the first dew drop on a misty morning. Sees the ball pitched up outside off and leans into the cover drive, picking the gap to the left of mid-off"
"gets off his feet to deal with a shorter delivery outside off, and having allowed it to come to him, he's able to flick it to mid-on for a single"
"<b>through him</B>! It's his first ball from round the wicket and it's enough! Delicious bowling. And all this havoc is because of seam movement. And that too only about an inch or two. Shami usually presents the seam so beautifully. It comes down bolt upright as he hits a fuller length, outside off, drawing the left-hander to drive away from his body. That's because Munro's feet aren't quite covering for that deadly bit of movement and when that happens, you have to be circumspect with your shots. Munro isn't, and he pays for it"
"greets him with a short ball, which Taylor is wary of, dropping his hands and letting it through to the keeper"
"fullish and outside off, Taylor covers the line with a stride forward and defends stoutly"
"a hint of room on offer, but Taylor is too early at the crease to go for his patented cut shot. Slices it instead to cover"
"the length is so good that even Williamson is rooted to the crease - much like Munro - but the difference is, New Zealand's captain lets the ball come to him, managing his errors better, and finding a single to third man. India should think about cutting that glide out. Sri Lanka did it to decent effect in the last series"
"his bat comes around his front pad, which is perfectly in line with the stumps. Taylor needs to get bat on this fuller delivery and he does"
presses forward outside off to push the ball to cover
"<b>Too good</b>! He gets the ball to straighten after pitching on a beautiful length - not too full to drive, nowhere near short either and far too close to off stump to leave. Taylor is drawn forward and then beaten like a drum"
"looms over the fuller ball, with his wrists cocked and that comes in handy as he flicks to mid-on"
"probing line again, on fourth or fifth stump, Taylor turns it to midwicket"

"back of a length and outside off, blocks to point"
gets in line with a shortish delivery on off stump and blunts it
<b>just short of point</b>! It's Kohli there - in Jadeja's place had he been in the XI - and he comes into play because of a poor shot from Williamson. He wants to break the shackles put on him by that gully fielder. Sees a ball full and nice and wide outside off. Throws his hands at it and is nearly out

"gets the room he likes, cuts it away, with his trademark power too, but he still can't beat the field. India doing especially well. Their lines this afternoon have been so constricting"

defends a good length ball outside off to the left of point
"leaps off his feet to try and get on top of the bounce of this back of a length delivery outside off. And as well as he's hit it, he finds the cover fielder"
"ties him down in that off-stump corridor, and Williamson can only glide it to point"
"bouncer again, rising up over the back shoulder. Taylor thinks about the hook shot, then knowing that if he plays that he runs the risk of top-edging the shot, pulls out"
"draws him forward with a full delivery outside off, Taylor defends to cover"
brings the bat down across his pads and endures <b>a leading edge</b> as Shami gets a fuller delivery to straighten off the angle
"steps out of his crease, forcing the bowler to go short, and Taylor's ready with a flick shot through square leg"
"width and that's enough for Taylor! He's on the front foot, but he picks the poor length early, shifts his weight back a touch and then pummels it through midwicket. Insanely good pull shot"
"looks for lbw with the fuller ball, Taylor manages to turn it to the left of short midwicket, Rayudu's lurking there and he has a good opportunity to run the batsman out at the non-strikers.... if he'd managed to pick the ball up"
"there's that invaluable gully fielder in play again - Williamson runs the back of a length ball down, looking for third man, but that exit's barred"
"shimmies down the pitch, but Bhuvneshwar doesn't give Taylor any options but a defensive push. No room. Not the length for the drive."
"goes a bit wide of the crease for a shortish delivery on off stump, Taylor knocks it down"
"launches it over mid-on and it nearly carries all the way! Exquisite strike from Taylor, coming down the pitch to Bhuvneshwar, picking up a length ball and putting it on a one-way trip into the stands."
taps a shortish delivery to point
"a hint of movement away from the bat, but Taylor covers it by playing late and opening the face. No runs though, finds point"
"fuller delivery, he pushes to the right of mid-off"
"full on middle, he nudges it to the right of short midwicket, but not with the pace to beat the man. It's Dhawan there now, after Rayudu's misfield last over"
"good length on off stump, defends towards the covers"
"steps out, and then, since the bowler changes his length, going short, he waits on the ball and then taps it to third man"
"fullish on off stump, defends stoutly"
"good length, outside off, he glides it, looking for third man, but the point fielder is alert enough."
punches the fuller delivery straight back at the bowler
"tosses it up, daring Taylor to drive, and drive he does, without timing it. Why? Cause the legbreak dips sharply on him."
"shortish on off stump, he makes room and crashes it through point"
"flatter delivery on middle, Williamson goes back and punches it through to long-on"
"drifts into the pads, Taylor looks a little wary about the turn the wristspinner might extract, playing a circumspect flick to square leg"
room to play the cut again and Taylor rarely needs a second invitation
leans into the flighted delivery outside off and taps it to long-off
<b>run-out at the non-strikers?</b>. It's a ricochet off the straight drive and we're headed up to the third umpires' box. And replays show Taylor's been good enough to rush back into his crease. Perfect straight drive almost results in disaster for NZ
"shortish on off stump, Williamosn works it through midwicket"
lashes the short and wide delivery to point. That's a poor ball. It should have been to be dealt with and I'm so angry I (almost) ended a sentence with a preposition
"fullish on off stump, defends towards mid-off"
"full on off stump, Taylor moves across his crease a bit and nudges it to mid-on"
"gets those wrists going, flicking the short ball outside off to short midwicket"
"goes for the cut shot, but there's enough protection there, Vijay Shankar covers it well enough"
"loopy delivery on off stump, and Taylor is ready to lash it through cover, bringing all of his considerable power to play. But the ball dips again. Too sharply for him to go through with the shot. And so he brings his wrists into it to keep the ball down"
gets the single through sweeper cover
"on the pads, Williamson rocks back, waiting for it till the last second before whipping it through midwicket"
"has the ball stopping on Taylor - and turning just a touch too. Brings about a false shot as Taylor tries to find a single straight down the ground and instead has to settle for one off the leading edge to long-off. Dhoni immediately responds saying 'good bowling, Chahal'"
""
he does that A LOT! Cuts the ball so hard that it bounces - off the other pitches in the square - right over the point fielder. Sensational bottom-hand strength
"full and outside off, he drives into the covers, where Rayudu again misfields and he's banished ot another part of the ground. Mid-on, it looks like"
that's breathtaking! It doesn't look like a boundary. Not at first. Not when he's barely put anything behind the strike. But this is Williamson. And it is his trademark backfoot punch. And the timing is usually out of this world.
taps the back of a length delivery down the pitch
doesn't come onto the bat as much as he'd like and so the backfoot punch wanders away aimlessly to cover
"full and outside off, he drives to mid-on"
"<b>he's getting drift now</b>. The tossed up ball starts on off stump and then curls in through the air, forcing Taylor to defend"
"and again, even with Taylor making room to drive the ball through cover, Chahal gets the legbreak to drift into the right-hander, dip before he can get to the pitch and stymie him beautifully"
"<b>he's claiming a caught and bowled</B>! And replays show he's right. Exceptional bowling. This is the result of the other trick in his bag - change of pace. And it's almost like he's sensed his moment. Taylor's been itching to smash Chahal. But the legspinner's been too good with his drift and dip. Now the batsman has to make a choice. Take a risk. He comes dancing out of his crease. Chahal is ready for it. Pulls his length back. Draws his pace down. Doesn't let Taylor anywhere near the ball and the shot - a tame push down the pitch - results in a low catch, which he takes diving forward. Insaaaaaaanely good."

"full at middle stump, punched firmly on the up to mid-on"
"<b>dropped!</b> Are you kidding me! Both Williamson and Kedar Jadhav with shockers there. Short ball at leg stump, crouches and spanks it firmly - but straight to Jadhav at fine leg.

"<b>he's not timing em</b>! And it's apparent in this shot - a shot he's so good at - the front foot pull. Spots the short ball early enough but it comes onto him, bouncing a little too much for his liking, and he only just clears mid-on, running to his right"

good length outside off and he taps it into the covers for a quick single
"slower ball, but he's into the forward defensive, a shade outside off, too early and as a result he gets an inside edge and worries about whether it's dragged onto his stumps"
"full on off stump, Rohit keeps it out well"
"goes for the slog - it's a length ball outside off, so it's there for the taking - but even the new ball seems to stick in the pitch just a tiny bit. Meaning Rohit is too early on the ball and he mistimes through midwicket"
<b>outstanding shot</b>! More so because he keeps his front leg away - he needs to with the ball pitched up and swinging in late - and then trusts a straight bat to come down through the line
carves the back of a length delivery outside off to point
"cross-seam slower ball from round the wicket, Dhawan picks it early and dabs it towards point"
"hits the gap between the two point fielders! Enough width on the ball for Dhawan to free his hands. It's short of length too, giving him that little extra time to place it properly"
"fuller delivery outside off, drives into the covers"
"works it towards the midwicket boundary, enjoying the ball angling into him from round the wicket"
"<b>149 kph</B> good length ball on off stump, Rohit deflects it to cover"

"round the wicket for a shortish delivery at <b>150 kph</b>, Dhawan glides it to point"
"slower ball - the leg roller it looks like - and Dhawan is beaten as he goes for the swat through point. Meanwhile, Ferguson goes from 150 kph to 129 kph"
"fullish on off stump at 149 kph, Dhawan drills it to cover"
"glorious batting! It comes down at 148 kph. More than enough pace for the glide ot third man. And with Ferguson dropping it short and wide, that's the simple, logical and perfect option"
"length outside off, punched on the up to mid-off"
"<b>taken at slip!</b> Loose waft from Rohit at a delivery curving away from him. It's short of a length, he's not gotten close to it with his feet and Guptill pouches in front of his face"

"bouncer down leg side, ducks under it"

"length at middle stump, uses his wrists to turn this down to fine leg"
"<b>dropped!</b> Latham calls and can't get there! Short ball at middle stump, too late on the pull. Ends up slicing it into the square leg region. Guptill allows Latham to go for it after hearing the call, although he was possibly closer at midwicket. Latham is never under it and is diving awkwardly forward and to his right as he lets this slip"
"length outside off, punched straight to extra cover on the up"
"<b>shot!</b> Length ball wide outside off, reaches out and lashes through the line to bisect cover and extra"

"short of a length at off stump, defended into the off side"
"short of a length at off stump, dropped pitch side on the off sdie with soft hands"
"length at leg stump, flicked to deep square's left"
full and in at leg stump. Looks to flick and closes the face too early. Leading edge to mid-off. That was a legcutter

"short ball slanted across off stump, jumps behind the line and wallops it over midwicket with a pull"

"short of a length just outside off, opens the face and runs it to third man"
"attempted slower, full toss wide outside off. Mistimed slap at it and it trickles to mid-off's right. Taylor's throw from there is too wayward for Latham and they get an extra run at fine leg"

"yorker length just outside off, jammed down to long-off"

"<b>given lbw and Kohli reviews.</b> Seems to be indicating he got bat on this. An attempted flick to a length ball that has struck him in front of middle. <b>There is a disturbance on Snicko.</b> He survives. Very thin edge there, if there was one. Because it didn't show on Hotspot."

"back of a length and outside off, Kohli steers the 148 kph ball behind point"

"presses forward for a push down the ground, but Ferguson dives to his right in his followthrough to deflect the ball to mid-on and keep it to a dot"
"<b>caught behind</b>! The Ferguson short ball works. And that's largely because it climbs up to his badge. Kohli's the kind to take on the short ball. If only to show bowlers they won't have their way. He's got out this way before, especially when his body's the target and sometimes even when the bouncer is straying down leg - as this is. Goes for the hook and gets a thin tickle through to the keeper."
"<b>between keeper and slip!</b> Taylor is wide, at second slip, if he'd been at orthodox first slip, that would have been a dolly. This is Rayudu not fancying Ferguson's pace. His feet aren't moving. Goes searching for a good length ball outside off and offers a thick edge that should really have been gobbled up. Latham tries his best, diving to his right, but he is never getting there"

"back of a length and outside off, and yet he goes for an on the up drive, off the front foot. Looks all sorts of odd as the ball beats his edge"

"127 kph - the Lockie Ferguson slower (short) ball, which Dhawan punches through the covers"

"back of a length and outside off, Dhawan plops it into the covers"
"slower ball, on a full length outside off, Dhawan eases it to point"
whip-pulls the short ball coming for his face nearly all the way to the midwicket boundary. Whip-pulls because the bat doesn't really go horizontal and there's barely any followthrough. It's like he's guiding the ball away with the face pointed straight up

"full and outside off, Dhawan drags it to midwicket"
"another sharp bouncer - at 141 kph - rising up above Dhawan's chest and looking for his badge. The batsman does well though, swaying away from the line, and guiding the ball past the vacant gully region"
