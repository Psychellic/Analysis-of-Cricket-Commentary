<b>cuts through him.</b> Short of a length and jags in from outside off as he shuffles and shapes to cut
<b>that looks dead in front.</b> It's given and they take a reluctant review. Might be playing on the fact it will be umpire's call at worst. He shuffles and is pinned very deep in the crease as this nips back in and beats his attempted glance to catch him right in front of middle stump. <b>And it is a very good review in the end - tracker has the ball rising over the stumps.</b> He indicated to his captain that he'd been caught on the flap of his left pad.

It's a short of a length, gripping and rising ball at middle stump. Philippe looks to pull that over square leg. Gets a leading edge and Southee has to track that going back and to his left. It gets away from him a little after he settles under it but he stretches his arms out behind and holds on"

"<b>chipped straight to extra cover.</b> Boult was back for the wicket and he has got it. Full and just outisde off. Wants to get this over the fielder, or perhaps square of him, but this isn't a pitch for the big drive. He's through it early and it comes off the low part of the bat for an easy catch"

"full and just outside off, reaches out and drives to long-off"
short of a length an turning a mile away from outside off. Miscues his pull shot as a result and there's the possibility of a second run to long-on's right as a result too. <b>Would have run out at the non-striker's end.</b> A rocket throw that was difficult for Williamson to grab at the stumps

hammered over extra over off the back foot. Short and turning away outside off. Waits on it this time and it sits up nicely for him
"<b>Williamson flies to his right to take a screamer!</b> Short of a length and into the pitch again, making them create all the power.

"dipping and full at middle stump, driven to long-on's left"
"<b>taken at short fine.</b> Full, slow, dipping at middle stump. Mitch Marsh in a poor position for a sweep shot, not low enough and is almost reaching out by the end. A top edge lobs nicely for the fielder"
