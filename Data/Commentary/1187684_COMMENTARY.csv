"a bit fuller, but keeps it outside off, punched to extra cover"

banged in on a length outside off and defended off the back foot.
"<b>beaten</b>. Lovely delivery. Hits a length and gets it to move away, snakes past the poking outside edge."
that height of Jamieson is being put to good use. He's banging it in just short of a length but getting considerable lift. This one zooms past on the fifth stump
"lovely shot. Stood up on his toes, and punched off the back foot through point."
"gets the length fuller, movement away from the batsman again, but he lets it go through outside off"
<b>cleaned him up</b>. What a beauty. Hits the seam on a length on off and the ball straightens. Agarwal plays down the wrong line and the ball cannons into off stump.
"Fullish outside off, pushed to cover"
"back of a length outside off, punched to extra cover"
shuffles across to get inside the line and flicks it off his pads to square leg. Didn't really time it well
"<b>beaten</b> first ball. Length on a sixth stump, Kohli's trying to get close to the ball and feel bat on it, but it hisses past the outside edge"
"beaten again! A touch fuller, and gets it to nibble away slightly. Kohli's looking to flick it from a fifth stump line, misses"
"full and wide outside off, Kohli gets bat on it, strokes it to point"
"back of a length but straying down leg, he rocks back and connects well with the pull, but there is a deep backward square leg, who takes it on the bounce"
"back of a length outside off, Kohli thinks about playing it but gets his bat out of the way"
"<b>lovely</b>. What a ball. Comes down from a height at pace, pitches on a length on off and jags away. Just past the outside edge"
"well bowled and well played. Banged in short outside off, and rears up unexpectedly. Kohli gets his hands up in time and dabs it down to third man"
"back of a length outside off, too late on the punch, it hung in the air for a while but dropped well short of the bowler"
"<b>shot</b>. First boundary of the innings. Loose ball, short and wide outside off and he lashes it through the covers"
"<b>imperious</b>. Kohli's had enough of being beaten, just disdainfully steps down the track and executes a perfect short-arm pull that sends the ball flying over long-on"
"back of a length outside off, moves across and pushes to cover point"
"fuller outside off, gets close to it, opens the face to run it to third man"

"great timing on that one, length ball, moving in but ends up on the pads and is flicked through midwicket"

"fuller outside off, driven to point off the toe end"
"back of a length outside off, cuts it to point"

"goes fuller, tried for the yorker, but doesn't quite nail it. Driven off his toes to mid-off"
"Superb from Shaw. Banged in short again outside off, but given more room and Shaw cuts it fiercely, doesn't bother to keep it down and doesn't have to. Clears point easily"

"length ball angling into him, worked to fine leg"
back of a length outside off - that's an area they have preferred bowling to Shaw - and he dabs it back to the bowler
banged in short outside off again but too far outside and it's the first wide of the innings
"length outside off, not quite short enough to pull. Shaw goes on the back foot and pulls anyway, gets it through midwicket off the bottom edge"
"<b>caught at third man</b>. That's an odd shot. Kohli shuffled across because the New Zealand bowlers have been banging it back of a length outside off, and tried to slash this. He wanted to send it over point perhaps but it balloons up to Jamieson at third man instead who has to take a couple of steps forward and go low in front to hold on."
"length ball outside off, defended"
"<b>just short of point</b>. Short and wide outside off, and he flayed it fiercely. Good timing but dropped just short of point. Nicholls the man there, who had to dive forward and to his right."

"length outside off, punched to point"
"<b>lovely</b>. Back of a length outside off, he waits for it and punches to point's right. The ball screams across the turf into the boundary"
"<b>Shaw's taken a fancy to Bennett</b>. Short and wide outside off again, he cracks it over point. Lovely balance, superb execution. And it's gone over the boundary too, for another six."
"Iyer gets into the act now. Full ball outside off, and he goes through with the drive though the bat turned in his hand and gets enough meat on it to go over cover and into the bouncary"
defended towards point. He thinks about a quick single but is turned down - rightly so.
"<b>beaten</b>. Went slightly wider of the crease to create the angle into the batsman and got it to straighten, to whizz past the edge"
"fuller, tapped to midwicket's right"
"back of a length outside off, wanted to whip it but gets it off the inside half of the bat and it trickles to midwicket"
"inside edge onto pad. Jamieson gets the ball to jag in, and Shaw is beaten on the drive, but gets a healthy inside edge"
"fuller on leg stump, flicked to mid-on"

"CdG pulls his length back and gets it to move away, Iyer leaves it well alone"
"length on off, tapped to the bowler's right"
"<b>Shaw might be run out here.</b> The bowler strays down the pads, and is flicked to fine leg. Looked like there was more than enough time to come back for two with the ball hit to de Grandhomme's right, but Shaw was scrambling to make it. Good through, right on top of the stumps, and despite a despairing dive, replays confirm that <b>Shaw is short of his ground</b>. A promising innings has ended, and the batsman's disappointed with himself."
"fuller length on the stumps, gets nicely behind it to defend"
"<b>lovely</b>. Length ball nibbling outside off, you'd have thought not enough room to punch, but he stays still, gives himself the teeniest bit of room and punches through point"

"length on the pads, flicked to fine leg"

"<b>smashed</b>. Another short ball, doesn't rise too high, Rahul's on the back foot early and swivels to pull this powerfully. Bisects the deep midwicket and deep square leg fielders"
"fuller, driven to cover"
"length ball, nipping into him. Southee appeals but the umpire's not interested. New Zealand won't go for the review. That was probably too high and going down leg, but it did beat the batsman's push and struck him on his pad"

"<strong>lucky this time!</strong> Good short ball, and he looks to hook this away. Off the glove, and just goes past Latham, sprawling away to his left, and down to fine leg. <strong>Fifty for Iyer!</strong>"

drives a length ball towards point
"full, and he sweeps this to perfection. Placed to the deep backward square leg region, and hit with a good roll of the wrists too"

"looks to advance down the track. Bowled towards leg and middle, and he defends back towards the bowler"

"length, driven towards deep point, using the depth of the crease"
"<b>and that's all that they'll put together!</b> Dug in a bit short by Neesham, and it appears to stop on Iyer as he looks to flick this away. Pops up towards short mid-wicket, and de Grandhomme takes a smart catch, diving forward. Timely wicket for the hosts, this."
"length, around middle, and he plays this towards short mid-wicket"
"full-blooded drive on the up over covers. There's no fielder in the deep in that region, and that makes it a safe shot. Not off the middle, and it allows them to come back for two"
"length, run down towards third man"
"starts with a short ball, outside off, and he plays this towards third man. Not completely intentional, but well played in the end"

"fuller length, around off, and he looks to drive, but cannot get it past mid-off"
"length, punched gently towards deep point. Immediately calls for two, and that brings up <strong>fifty for Rahul</strong>!"

"length, around off, and he drives this to cover"

"fuller outside off, driven to mid-off and they sprint a quick single"
"fuller on middle and leg, bunted towards mid-on"

"<b>hung in the air</b> but falls short of mid-on. Slower ball that he pushed at too early, and it popped up off his intended punch to mid-on, but falls safe"
"length outside off, stroked through point"
strays on the pads and all Rahul has to do is get some bat on it. He does that and tickles it fine to collect four. Another slower ball but got the radar wrong
given room outside off and slashed hard but not fine enough to get a boundary and third man can run to his left and field it
"length ball outside off, he moves across and flicks it off his pads through midwicket"
"back of a length angling into him, straightens a touch on middle stump, patted into the legside"

"back of a length on the stumps, tries to turn it towards midwicket but gets it higher on the bat and the ball plops up and down into the legside"
"fuller on off, opens the face of the bat to drive through backward point. Splendid running again by the two batsmen to pick up two"
"<b>direct hit and Rahul was a goner</b>. Mitch Santner at cover had plenty of time but he misses the stumps. This was driven firmly and Pandey set off for a single. Rahul responded but seemed to have given up nearing the crease, knowing that a direct hit would send him back."
"<b>wham</b>. That is bottom handed power from Rahul. Full on the stumps, and he punches it through extra cover. Hung in the air for a bit but there was no chance of a catch. It just raced to the boundary"

"given a bit more air, on a length on the stumps, steered into the offside"
"flatter and fuller outside off, stroked to deep point"
"given some air outside off, takes a stride forward and opens the face of the bat to guide it to third man. Played with soft hands and they come back for the second"

"length on off, flicked to long-on"
strays down leg and is tucked to fine leg

"stopped on the pitch a little and he was too early into his drive. The ball hung in the air a bit but fell short of the bowler and away to his right, trickles past to mid-on"

"fuller, gets down low and square drives it to deep point"

"length outside off, patted softly towards midwicket"
"back of a length on the stumps, flat batted to long-on"
"short on the stumps, swivels back to pull this. Fine leg fields"
"flatter on the pads, worked to long-on. The fielder was deep so the batsmen were considering a second but decide against it"
"down the track, wanted to send it in orbit, but gets it off the inside half of the bat and it bounces to long-on"
"that one turned and bounced! Took the batsman and keeper by surprise.Rahul was shaping to cut, but it took the outside edge and went past the keeper. Not really fair to call it a chance, it came so quickly and he was standing up to the stumps"
"length ball, turned to midwicket"
"flatter and quicker, goes back and across to whip to long-on using his wrists"
"<b>beautifully done</b>. Down the track, gets to the pitch and drives it straight over the bowler's head. No fielders there and it pings into the straight boundary"
"<b>dismissed</b>. Length ball that was sliding down leg, he moves inside and almost nonchalantly swats a pull over fine leg. Way over."
"length ball nipping back in, tries to turn it but can't connect cleanly. the ball rolls down the pitch"
"<b>just out of reach of Jamieson</b>. Excellent ball, bouncer that rises up above his shoulder outside off. Rahul wanted to pull, got a toe-end that made the ball pop up and drop. Jamieson was in his follow through and had to run and dive to his right. the ball fell inches from his fingers."

"length on the stumps, swipes across the line to long-on"
"back of a length on the stumps, swivels and pulls it from near his waist to fine leg"
"back of a length outside off, cuts it to backward point"
"length on off, driven to cover"
"fires it in on off, steered into the offside, but straight to point"
"<b>there's a potential run-out here</b>. But Manish Pandey is saved because Santner took both bails off before he had the ball in hand. His right knee brushed the stumps and took off the bails. If he had gathered cleanly, he could have run Pandey out. Pandey had tried to work it away, but the ball didn't travel too far. They go for the quick single, Pandey a bit slow to respond. Latham runs to the ball gathers and throws it, but Santner has already dislodged the bails before collecting the ball."
"fuller on the stumps, flicked through midwicket"
"makes room but he fires it in quick and flat on off, driven to the bowler's left"
"short outside off, swats a pull down to long-on. The fielder's deep so they sprint two"
"length ball outside off, sweeps it with good timing to deep square leg's right and they can push for two which means <b>it's a century for KL Rahul</b>. What a tour he's had. And this has been a fine innings, where he had to consolidate at the start but has kept the run-rate ticking"
"back of a length, pulled to long-on"
"full toss outside off, driven to long-on"
"moved well across, but the bowler bowled a well disguised slower on and it goes between bat and pad"
"tailing into him, tried to flick it off his toes but gets an inside edge that hits pad rolls towards point"
"fired in on leg stump, steered away by opening the face and they take a single"
"down the track, but Santner sees him and bowls it flatter and shorter, he can only push it through cover"
"goes for the reverse sweep, doesn't quite nail it. Top edge loops over the keeper and short third man runs to his left to field"
misfield by Jamieson at short third man allows a second. Rahul stayed still that time and opened the bat face to steer it fine
drifts on the pads and is worked to deep midwicket
"flat and fired into the batsman, who has to make room and punch to long-on"
"length outside off, he was clearing his front leg to try and mow it, but can only flat bat it to long-on"
"slower ball yorker, he had to wait for it having planted his front foot down, ends up driving it to long-on"
"<b>bursts through Jamieson's hands at long-off!</b>. That's poor fielding. It was a brilliant looking shot, driven inside out to wide long-off. Jamieson is right there and the ball is at comfortable catching height just above his head. Goes through his hands and is a six."
"<b>Jamieson takes the catch this time</b> and he flings the ball angrily at his miss last ball. Short of a length, Rahul is a little cramped for room and gets it higher on the bat than ideal while trying to pull. Jamieson runs to his right at long-off and holds on."
"<b>caught at long-on</b> and India are losing their way at the death. Pandey wanted to execute one of his lofted straight drives. Didn't get as underneath the ball as he would have wanted to, and lifts it to long-on, where Santner comes forward and takes a tumbling catch."
"fuller length going across him, steered to point"
too far down leg and he'll have to rebowl that.
length ball on leg stump and he whips a pull into the gap at square leg to get a boundary first up
"length ball on the stumps, he has a big mow across the line, to deep midwicket"
very far across the batsman. Too far across and it'll be another wide.
"<b>direct hit from Williamson at mid-off</b> but Jadeja has made it. Short outside off, no timing on it as he tries to pull. Too late on it and it goes only to mid-off. Good work by Williamson but Jadeja was safely home"
"superb yorker on the fifth stump, Shardul inside edges onto the ground. Jadeja sprints through for a quick single with the ball bouncing into the ground and towards short leg"
"fuller outside off, gives himself room and drives, but straight to cover"
"full and straight, he bashes it straight back too by going well back. Not timed well enough to beat long-on, who runs to his left to field"
full ball on the sixth stump line. Shardul had an almighty swing at it. went too hard and missed it completely
"<b>caught at deep square leg</b> but they are going upstairs to check if it's a no-ball. Perhaps for height? A yorker gone wrong ends up as a full toss and Shardul swipes across the line. Gets it near the end of the bat, more height than distance. Travels very high and de Grandhomme does well to keep his eyes on it and hold on. Not a no-ball, and Shardul has to walk back."
"<b>inside edge goes past the stumps</b>. The bowler has his hands on his head. Saini cleared his front leg and wanted to swat it on the offside, but he swings more in hope than with conviction. Gets an inside edge that eludes the stumps and goes past a diving Latham too."
"short outside off, slower ball. Misses it completely trying to slog across the line"
"same ball, same result. Good bowling this. Banging it in and getting it high enough that the tailender is going to have trouble with connecting"
and he follows the same template. Gets it a bit closer to off this time and the ball goes past at midriff height rather than near shoulders - but the same result. Swing and a miss
full and well across him. Jadeja reaches for it and steers it to third man
"Southee follows the Bennett template, bowls it short and outside off. Saini misses again but Jadeja has sprinted down and called Saini through. Good work from Latham to hit the stumps direct, but Jadeja is so quick he's made it."
"superb bowling. Going across him but shortens his length, while making the batsman expect a fuller ball. Jadeja misses with the cut. He was asking for it to be a wide but had moved across"
"clever from Jadeja. Moved well across and instead of trying to drive it, lifted it over short fine leg"
down the track and Southee goes for the full and wide ball again. This time it's too far outside off so he'll have to rebowl it
"full toss outside off, Jadeja will feel like he's missed out, slashed it straight to point. Jadeja runs for the single, Saini is slow to respond. Makes it safely because there is no direct hit"
"low full toss, Saini gets down on one knee and slams it over mid-off. Nobody back at the boundary so he'll finish off the innings with a four."
"length, around off, and defended towards point"
"length, around off, and he defends this"
"a bit short, and he hangs back. This isn't very quick either, and offers him some width. He slashes this away past point to the cover-point fence"
"length, just around off, and he <strong>plays inside the line of this</strong>! Better line, and the perfect length to go with Bumrah's pace"
"fuller, and he skews this off the inside of the bat, but gets it past short mid-wicket. The man there goes chasing after, as does mid-on, and between the two of them, they are able to save one"
"length, around off, and left alone"
"<strong>lucky!</strong> Presses a touch forward to defend a fuller ball around off, and that takes the inside edge and runs away to fine leg. That could have easily rattled the stumps!"
defends a back-of-a-length ball shaping back in from outside off
"length, and he defends this towards cover"
defends a length ball towards short mid-wicket
"looks to make room to go straight down the ground. Saini follows him with a sharp off-cutter. Off the inside edge, on to pad, and down to ground"
"off the lower part of the bat, but <strong>very much deliberate</strong>! Saini digs it in short, but strays down the leg side. Guptill can just move inside the line of this, and help it over fine leg"

"length, and he plays this away towards point"

"length, driven back towards Saini, who half-stops it himself on his follow through"
"back of a length, straight, driven back towards the bowler with a straight ball"
"length, straight again, and he plays this towards mid-on. There's a direct hit at the non-striker's end, but Guptill stays inside"
"length, just nibbles away from outside off, and he taps this towards cover-point"
"attractive cover drive, to a length ball offering some width, and that goes through the infield. Teases Shardul Thakur, who pursues the ball from mid-off, and he is able to pull it back ahead of the cover boundary"
"back of a length, pitching around leg and tucking him up further. Defends off the back foot"
"<strong>oh, good ball!</strong> Not a lot of lateral movement, but quick and angles across him. Nicholls is opened up a touch, and even gets an outside edge, but that flies through the vacant gully region towards third man"
"length, cuts back in from outside off, and he defends"
"length, down the pads, and off the thigh pad as he looks to whip it away. Goes scurrying along the carpet towards fine leg"
"length, and he defends this as it angles across him from leg stump"

"full, on the pads, and he whips this away towards deep square leg...and <strong>well over it</strong>! This is just strong wristwork, and good hand-eye coordination"
"on the pads again, and he whips this away towards the unprotected mid-wicket region. Bad bowling considering he has a 6-3 field"
"length, and he slashes this hard, looking for the point boundary. Jadeja at backward point is able to stop it"
"back of a length, cutting back in, and he defends on the hop"
"length, around off, and he defends towards point. Enough room to go through for a single"
"fuller, outside off, and he drives this beautifully down the ground. No chance for mid-off, who sets off hoping to cut it off to his left, but then has the sole responsibility of bringing this back from beyond the boundary!"
"length, and he plays it towards short mid-wicket"
"back of a length, and slapped hard towards point. Mayank Agarwal does well to get down and stop that. Would have been four if he'd missed"
"short, and <strong>dispatched beyond mid-wicket</strong>! Guptill picks the length of this very quickly, rocks back a touch and then whiplashes this away on the on side. Superb bat speed!"
"a bit fuller, and then he drills this past the bowler. Nothing more than a straight bat push down the ground, but timed supremely well to the long-off fence!"
"back of a length, moves back in a touch, and he gets an inside edge as he looks to defend. On to pad and down by the batsman"
"length, punched to cover. <strong>Right off the middle again</strong>, making that sweet 'CRRRUNCH' sound!"

"length, and he allows this to turn back from outside off, and defends towards mid-on"
drives a ball closer to him towards long-on
"short, and he pulls this well ahead of square on the on side. There's a deep mid-wicket in place, but this has been placed well to the left of the man, there, more where wide long-on could be said to be"
"length, a bit of movement back in from outside off, and he looks to drive this back. Off the inside edge, on to pad, but safe"
"fuller, and he drives this towards cover with the full face of the blade"
"fuller ball, outside off, and he cracks this towards cover. Stopped by Prithvi Shaw, low to his left"
"short in length, and down the leg side, but a terrific response from Nicholls. Fine leg is inside the circle, so he just helps this along, right foot raised, towards deep backward square leg"
"length, and he taps this to the left of short mid-wicket. Sensible thing to do right now, as always, is to hand strike over to Guptill"
"full, down the leg side. He looks to flick this away, but cannot lay bat on it"

"full, towards off, and he drives this hard to cover"
"back of a length, and he defends this from the crease"
"length, and he presses forward before playing a straight ball with a dead bat"
"length, drives this towards cover-point. Rifled in at the striker's end, and there's no backing up, but New Zealand don't want to risk going for a risky overthrow"
"dug in short, and he plays this away towards square leg"
"fuller, thrown a touch wider, and <strong>Nicholls hangs his bat out</strong>. A nothing shot, to be honest, and lucky that this doesn't catch the outside edge on its way through to the keeper."
"length, but too straight, and he can whip this away towards deep backward square leg"
"<strong>gets to fifty in style!</strong> Dug in short, and outside off, but he is seeing the ball like a rugby ball right now (only bigger, and more spherical!) Whips this away towards deep square leg, and it goes beyond the boundary"

driven to long-off
"length, and he drives this towards deep cover"

"full toss, down the leg side, and he helps it along towards fine leg"
"length, <strong>beats the outside edge</strong>, with a little movement away from him. Good ball! India need more of that, ideally with a few culminating in edges carrying to fielders..."

"length, presses forward to defend. May have gotten an inside edge, before it hits pad"
"<b>beautiful</b>! Tosses this up a touch more, and Guptill stretches to defend as it drifts in towards leg stump. Turns across him and hits the top of off. That's a dream ball for a leg-spinner to bowl, and perhaps the only way that Guptill could have fallen today. He's given his team a massive headstart, though"

"tossed up very full, driven to long off"

"length on off, slapped to cover"
"flatter and a bit shorter, allows him the width to cut through backward point.

gets some drift but it ends up on leg and he works it behind square
"fuller again, comes on the front foot and turns it to midwicket"
"dips and skids onto him, he misses the flick by a long way while staying back and is struck on the pads. Chahal is interested, the umpire isn't."
"some nice drift there by Chahal and loop, drawing him forward down the track. The drift's taking the ball away but he manages to push it into the offside. 'No pace on the ball boys,' says Kohli gleefully."

"drags the length short and outside off, Nicholls rocks back and slaps this hard, but a diving stop by cover ensures no runs"
goes deep in his crease to create the room to punch this to long-off

"length ball on the pads, turned to square leg"
"back of a length outside off, steers it past a diving backward point"

"quicker one, bowled from a bit wider of the crease too, dips on him and is turning away but Williamson blocks it"

"back of a length ball on the stumps, turned to square leg on the back foot. But Saini has over-stepped so <b>free hit</b> coming up"

"bowls it back of a length outside off, sits up and Nicholls rocks back to thrash this through midwicket. Made use of the free hit that time"
"fuller outside off, driven to mid-off. The fielder has a shy - not needed perhaps because the batsmen weren't running - and it hits the stumps direct and goes to fine leg resulting in two overthrows. Kohli was the fielder."
good finish by Saini with a quick bumper on leg stump that the batsman has to duck under
"<b>he's whipped this straight to midwicket</b>. Kane Williamson will be filthy with himself for that. It was a long hop, sat up and he could have smashed it anywhere, but picked out Agarwal at midwicket. India have an important breakthrough"

"googly, same spot as last ball, Taylor goes forward to defend again but gets an inside edge that rolls on the legside"

"<b>dismissed</b>. Not a terrible ball, short and on leg stump to try and cramp him but Nicholls rocked back and was in position early to pull this to deep square leg"
"and now he pulls in front of square! this is not as short, and it's still on leg stump. It should be cramping him but he's moving into position early and so well balanced, he's able to unleash a fierce pull to this also"

"<b>direct hit by KL Rahul at the bowler's end</b>. This was a length outside off, turning away. Taylor played it with the turn into the offside and responded to the call for a single. Quick off the blocks after some hesitation. Rahul ran around picked it up and hit direct, but Taylor had made it"

"back of a length, flicked to midwicket"

"fuller, driven to mid-off"
"<b>caught behind</b>. Short and wide outside off, going across him. The bounce perhaps did him in, he was staying low to cut this through the offside but ends up getting an edge that flies through to the keeper."

"length, tidy line just outside off, and he presses forward to defend"
"shorter, and wider, and he plays it towards Jadeja at point. They set off, and Jadeja has a shy at the non-striker's end. Misses. That would have been <strong>tight</strong>!"
"length, very straight in line, and he plays this towards cover from the crease"
"dug in a bit short. Neesham looks to take full toll of it with a pull, but that slides under his bat. Perhaps kept lower than what the batsman anticipated"

"length, straight again, an defended towards point"
"length, and he hangs back in his crease, and punches this throug the cover-point region, against the spin, <strong>beautifully</strong>!"

"down the leg side, and he looks to sweep. Off the gloves and goes towards fine leg"
"<B>smacks this straight to mid-wicket!</b> Tossed up a touch, and he looks to biff this away on the on side, but cannot get the elevation he wants. Kohli is in the way, and breaks into a wide grin as he accepts this catch. He knows that the game is well within India's reach..."

"tossed up, and he drives with the turn towards wide mid-on"
"length, and he has swung this towards deep square leg. It bounces short of Saini, and <strong>Kohli is livid with him</strong> for not going ahead and attacking the ball! CdG didn't seem to time it well, and in the end, it worked out to his advantage. That might have ended up as an easy catch"
"length, jags back in towards the batsman, who pushes it back down towards mid-on. Kohli comes around from mid-off, and has a shy with an underarm at the non-striker's end"
tip-and-run executed perfectly towards cover by Latham

"length, around off, and he has muscled this away on the on side. A knuckle ball from Thakur, and he just clears the square leg fence!"
"short, around off, another change of pace one suspects, and he goes towards deep mid-wicket this time. Bisects the gap between deep square leg and long-on quite well. Not off the middle, but when you hit the ball as hard as he does, it rarely matters that much!"
"back of a length, but straight, and he punches this towards point"
"full, driven towards long-on, and Thakur dives across from short mid-wicket to keep this down to one"
"length, and he drives this wide of sweeper cover. A fumble in the deep, and that allows them to cut back for two"

"slower ball, off-cutter, and read to perfection. Just works this towards deep mid-wicket"
"full toss, and he has whipped this away towards deep mid-wicket. I think the only challenge there was a bit of disbelief at how bad that ball was from Bumrah. Bad direction, and worse length!"

"short, wide, and cut away past point. <strong>Bad ball, and punished</strong>!"
