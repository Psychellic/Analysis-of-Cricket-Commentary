pitched up and nibbles away outside off - hint of awayswing - Rohit presses forward and solidly pushes to the covers
"good length and attacking off stump from over the wicket, Rohit brings his bat down in line and plays it back down the pitch"
"back of a length and veering in at the top of off, Rohit's back-foot defence intervenes. The ball is coming onto the bat nicely in the early exchanges"
wild full ball down leg - so wild that it would have missed a set of stumps down the leg side. Chameera attempted a cutter and it went wrong. Leg-side wide it is
"Jeevan Mendis tears back from mid-off and tracks down Rohit's sliced hit. <strong>Sensational catch running back</strong> and across to his left from mid-off. He gets into an awkward side-on position, but makes the catch look a lot easier. He lands on his back but still hangs onto the ball. Sri Lanka huddle up while Rohit exits. This was fuller and outside off - in Rohit's swinging arc - he aims to hoist it over the man inside the circle but winds up skewing it off the bottom part. Rohit gone for a duck. What a lift for Sri Lanka"
"back of a length on middle and leg, tipped to midwicket for one"
"on a length and outside off, Raina lets the ball slide off the face to backward point"
"full on middle and leg, front-foot push to wide mid-on"
"full and angling away outside off, Raina drags it against the angle to midwicket off the inside half. The fielder swoops down on the ball but can't connect with the stumps"
"Dhawan slices it, times it well enough to clear mid-off. Full and angling away outside off, he shimmies out and chips it in the air between mid-off and cover"
"Dhawan moves away outside leg, then protects his castle, blocking this length ball to cover"
"half-tracker on middle stump, this should've been belted out of the ground. Instead, Dhawan pulls it to deep square leg"
<strong>bowled'im</strong>. Raina backs away a long way outside leg and exposes all three stumps. He swishes and misses. Pradeep doesn't miss his target: he hits the middle stump with a full-toss. It looks very ugly when these shots don't come off. Low-percentage shot; maybe Raina should have given himself more time before going after the bowler
"back of a length and outside off, scythed away behind point for one"
"good length and on off, defensively tapped to point"
"back of a length and zips through wide outside off, Pandey plays a long way away from the body. He slashes with hard hands and does not make contact"
"lifter on middle stump,<strong> bursts off the pitch and beats Pandey's attempt to hook it</strong> away. He looked away, took his eyes off it, and was too late onto it"
"back of a length and outside off, Chameera hits the bat hard as opposed to bat hitting ball. Stabbed back to Chameera"
"sharp bouncer on middle, forces Pandey to duck under it"
"skids in with the angle from around the stumps, beats the inside edge, and raps the front pad, but the sharp angle was taking it down the leg side. <strong>Sanga-esque appeal from Chandimal</strong> - it amounts to nothing"
"slides on outside off, Dhawan sweeps and only collects fresh air"
"Dhawan rolls out his wrists and succeeds in sweeping to the square leg boundary. He got under the length, rolled his wrists, and controlled it well"
"Dhawan forays down the track, Dananjaya drags his length back, stabbed into the covers"
Dhawan's attacking approach has thrown Dananjaya off his line and length. He spears an off-side wide. Left alone
"darted into the pads, Dhawan picks it away in the gap between deep midwicket and deep square leg for a double"
"dragged down outside off, Dhawan ventures deep in the crease and swats the ball away to deep midwicket. Can't find the gap this time"
"deftly done, Dhawan. On a length and angling across off, Dhawan uses the pace and angle and steers it to the right of deep third man. Dananjaya slides to his right but can't haul the ball in"
"sharp bouncer on leg stump, beats Dhawan for pace, and cramps him for room. He sends <strong>a top edge fluttering over short fine leg</strong>"
"back of a length and straighter in line, tucked away square of short fine leg for one"
"full and veering down the leg side, past Pandey's glance, for a wide. Pandey yet to get off the mark"
"full and outside off, driven through the line to mid-off. Pandey takes on Chameera's arm to open his account"
"full and slanted down leg, another wide, SL letting things slip?"
chopped from off stump to the right of backward point for a scampered single. Good urgency from India
Pandey clears his front leg and shovels it with the bottom hand up and over mid-on. Length ball on middle stump - that's the perfect recipe for Pandey's release
"darted in on middle stump, Dhawan dares to sweep from the stumps. Rolls his wrists and guides the ball to fine leg"
"slower offbreak, defended"
"tossed up on middle, Pandey saunters down the track and forces the ball to long-on"
"darted in short and hits the thigh pad of Dhawan, the pair hare across for a leg bye"
"tossed up liberally outside off, breaks back in, wrong'un? dragged off the inside half to wide long-on. Just a single"
"pushed through outside off, Dhawan drags a sweep past midwicket"
"just short of a good length on off, Dhawan stands tall and forces to long-on"
"Pandey manufactures a boundary <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5e5FyG4BN0&t=37s' target='_blank'>outta nowhere</a>. Back of a length and outside off, he jumped across off even before Thisara had delivered. Shovels it in the gap between deep midwicket and deep square leg"
Pandey backs away outside leg now and hoicks a short ball to midwicket
Pandey walks across off and looks to hook it over short fine leg. But this lifter hits his body. Thisara has been pretty good with the short ball of late. <strong>Replays indicate the ball hit his upper glove</strong>
"back of a length and outside off, Dhawan uses his feet and scythes it away to deep point"
"really full on middle and leg, muscled away but only as far as midwicket"
"non-turner outside off, leans back and chops to the off-side sweeper off the back foot"
"Mendis goes up for a big leg-before appeal. <strong>SL challenge the on-field not-out decision.</strong> Did that pitch in line, though? No snick there. A bit too full for the sweep, Dhawan still goes through with the shot  and does not make contact. He is pinned on the front pad below the knee-roll. It would have hit the stumps but the <strong>ball pitched outside leg</strong>. And SL lose a review"
"dangled up full on middle, Pandey gets underneath the length and smites it into the stands beyond midwicket. He stretched out and slog-swept it with great authority"
"faster and flatter outside off, pushed into the covers"
"off-stump yorker, good response from Mendis, dug back to him"
"<strong>low-arm slider</strong>, punched down to long-on for one"
"Pandey shuffles away outside leg, Pradeep chases him with a short ball. Jabbed away to sweeper cover"
"Dhawan top-edges it over the keeper's head for six. Chest-high short ball, cramps the batsman for room, he hooks and watches the ball sail away into the boundary"
"<strong>Back-to-back sixes off the top-edge for Dhawan</strong>. Another lifter on middle and leg, 142ks, Dhawan is late onto the hook. This flies over long leg"
"back of a length on middle and leg, whipped off the hips for one"
"back of a length and outside off, 140ks, Pandey clears his front leg and flat-bats it ram-rod straight into the stumps at the other end"
"slower short ball outside off, Pandey does not pick the change-up. He throws his bat at the ball and misses"
Dhawan saunters down the track and forces a non-turning full ball on middle to long-on
"speared on middle and leg, jabbed away to long-on"
"Dhawan uses his feet, this arrowed short and wide down the leg side, past Dhawan's reach. But there's enough time for Dhawan to reach the safety of his crease before  the keeper could break the bails"
"low-arm slider, a la Kedar Jadhav, deflected to the leg side"
Dhawan reverse-sweeps from outside leg to deep point
"speared very full on middle and leg, off the pad and sneaks away to short fine leg"
"flat on middle and leg, clears his front leg and swipes to long-on"
"too full, he backs away and belts this into the gap at deep extra cover"
steps out to get to the pitch of the ball as he drills this down to long-off
"backs away and cuts hard towards the cover region, not timed all that well"
"drifts in but the length is on the shorter side, pulled to deep midwicket. This kept a touch low"
"too much width, Dhawan backs away, gets down on one knee and flays this to the deep extra cover boundary. That brings up his half-century as well. Poor delivery that deserved to be put away"
"angles this into the pads from around the stumps, swept to deep backward square leg"
width and he's walloped this to the extra cover boundary. Not all that short but it was sitting up nicely for Dhawan to thrash this
steers this away-going length ball to backward point for a quick single
"waist high full toss on middle and leg, Pandey waits and then swings this to the deep backward square leg boundary. Easy pickings"
walks across to help this over the keeper's head but is beaten. Pandey is furious at missing out on that one. He positioned himself nicely
"looks to slash this short ball over point but this gets big on him, beaten."
"slower and fuller on the stumps, eased to long-on"
"backs away and squeezes this drive to cover for a quick single, the sliding stop took a while for the throw to come in from Shanaka"
"sweeps this from way outside off to deep backward square leg, didn't get hold of this at all"
"steps out to go inside-out over cover, gets a thin bottom-edge that squeezes between the keeper's legs. Jeevan saw Pandey stepping out and shortened his length"
"he's dragged this from way outside off to deep midwicket. No power behind the stroke from Pandey, who looked to go over long-on. The low-arm action meant the ball dipped on him just a touch. Pandey's scratchy innings has come to an end, timed the ball well early on but struggled as the innings progressed."
rocks back and pulls this short ball to deep midwicket
"fired full on the stumps, defended back with the spin"
"slider back in from around the stumps, bunted towards point"
"lunges forward to drive, gets a thick inside edge back towards the bowler. Had to reach out to play this"
steers this towards point to get off the mark
steps out and drives this firmly to long-off
"shapes to cut but this one slides back in to beat the inside edge. This kept a touch low as well, pressure building on Pant"
"plays the short-arm jab down towards deep midwicket, excellent over this"
"steps out to wallop this over cow corner, gets a thick inside edge onto the pad as this rolls into the off side. He scampers a single out of desperation. Nowhere near the pitch of the ball"
"too short and punished. He rocks back and hammers this pull into the scoreboard at deep midwicket. Hits it on the full. Massive hit, picked the length early."
backs away and belts this shortish delivery to the edge of the ring at cover
"width outside off, Pant swings and toe-ends this slog to cover. Looked to go over the infield"
"clobbers this properly, finally. This time a legbreak from Akila, Pant gets to the pitch of the ball and muscles this. Looked to hit it a lot straighter though, went towards wide long-off in the end."
"steps out to slog, gets a thick inside edge to deep backward square leg"
"misses the slog, deflects off the pad to short third man"
reverse paddles this towards the man running in from point. Dhawan wanted to play this a lot finer
dabs this gently into the covers for a quick single
"drifting into the pads, Dhawan is down on one knee as he clobbers this slog sweep to clear the ropes effortlessly. Deep square had no chance, mammoth hit"
shapes to pull but this short ball keeps a touch low and hits him on the pad. Was sliding down leg
driven hard to sweeper cover
"down leg, Dhawan heaves this down to clear deep fine leg effortlessly again. This wasn't a top-edge though, carried the momentum through"
"low full toss, squeezed to mid-off"
slices this away-going full toss to square third man
"thick outside edge, did that carry to Chandimal behind the stumps? Yes. <b> Dropped! </b> Should've been taken with two hands. He went with just his left glove but this was too close to the body. Coming back to the delivery, this was full and just outside off"
"full toss down leg, Pant looks to whip this behind but gets a thin edge through to the keeper, they scamper a run nonetheless. Chandimal's underarm throw left enough time for Dhawan to sneak in"
steps out and wallops this full toss straight over the sightscreen. Picked the bones out of that. Right off the middle
"looks to reverse sweep, but this quicker delivery drifts in to hit the pad. Struggling clearly"
belts this flat to long-off
"slog and a miss. Didn't get anywhere near the pitch of the ball, trying to play across the line"
swing and a miss. Playing too early once again
"swept from way outside off towards deep  backward square leg, once again not much timing. Off a thickish inside edge"
"has he mistimed this, yes. Reaches out to this wide delivery and lofts this straight to long-off. The pressure of trying to manufacture strokes has got to Dhawan. Pant had bottled strike and run-flow, so Dhawan had to go for it and he's fallen in the process. Touch lucky with those top-edges but he's played well"
"too full and angling away, drills this down to long-off"
"short and angling in, DK plays a short-arm jab to deep midwicket"
no timing again as he hits this down to long-off. Looked to clear the ropes
"yorker-length on off stump, drilled towards deep extra cover as they scamper back for the second"
"swept from outside off, on the bounce to deep midwicket"
squeezes out this yorker-length delivery to long-off
"looks to swing this over long-off, toe-ends the slog to the fielder. Once again, no power, no proper connection"
"thick outside edge to the third man fence. This was slower, fuller and Karthik held his shape to go over cover."
"misses his yorker by not much, DK uses the depth of the crease and whip this low full toss over square leg. Excellent awareness"
heaves this full toss from middle and off to deep midwicket
"he's nailed this, finally. Full and angling away, Pant stands still inside the crease, gets underneath the length and spanks this to beat deep extra cover"
helps this short ball straight down the throat of deep fine leg. The innings ends with a mishit and that shot's really the story of his innings today. Too many swings and mishits.
"full and slanting into middle stump, worked quietly to midwicket"
"short and angling into the hips, duly glanced away to fine leg"
"shortish and angling across off, Mendis has a go at it and chops it to point"
"Mendis runs it away past the outstretched right hand of Raina at slip. Good length and angling across off, he rides the bounce, and dabs it in the air and gets a four"
"short, wide, Mendis slashes to third man"
"much fuller and heading towards off, Danushka camps back and defends it back to Unadkat"
"non-turning offbreak, slides on outside off, Mendis presses forward and pumps it over the top. He clears mid-off. This is the new, fearless Mendis"
and he rolls out the slog-sweep. He is holding nothing back. Stretches across off and slugs it in the air over square leg
"Mendis takes on Sundar again, this time he <strong>slices a catch to Dhawan running back from mid-off.</strong> He slaps his thigh in celebration like he often does. Credit to Sundar for daring to toss this up outside off. Mendis loses his shape, the bottom hand flies off the bat, as he skies it to Dhawan"
"slides in on middle, defended back to the bowler"
"speared outside off, 94ks, Kusal Perera stretches across off, lines it up and slog-sweeps it powerfully over the square leg boundary. Muscled away"
"slower through the air, drifts in at middle, grazes the inside edge and wanders away to midwicket"
"just short of a good length on middle, sits up to be hit, Kusal Perera channels his inner Jayasuriya and short-arms it over midwicket"
Kusal welcomes Thakur into the attack with back-to-back fours. He rises on top of this short ball outside off and creams it away in the gap between backward point and cover
"<strong>make that a hat-trick of fours for Kusal Perera</strong>. Overpitched outside off, he stretches out, and drills it through the line. Dumps Thakur to the cover boundary. The Premadasa roars in approval"
"this is even better and bigger. 116ks slower ball outside off, might have been a knuckle ball outside off, Kusal reads the change-up and thumps it over the cover boundary, this time all the way for a six"
"<strong>Thakur has lost his line, length, and his head</strong>. High full-toss above the waist outside off, Kusal jumps off the ground and scythes it to the left of extra cover. No-ball called"
"<strong>six boundaries in a row for Kusal Perera</strong>. Half-volley on middle stump, Kusal plants his front leg and belts it straight past Thakur. Dismissive"
"short ball, cramps 'im up for room, he pulls it only as far as short fine leg"
"floated up on off stump, tapped to cover off the front foot"
"sliding down the leg side, deflected off the pads to short fine leg"
"Good urgency from Sri Lanka. Kusal jumps down the track, works it wide of deep midwicket, calls for two and gets it"
"length ball, slides in with the arm, Kusal chips in front of mid-on.<strong> SL surge to fifty in less than four overs</strong>"
"slower offbreak outside off, guided to backward point"
"pushed through outside off, another non-turner, drops down to one knee and smokes a slog-sweep over the square leg boundary. Danushka joins the Colombo party"
"slower cutter outside off, inside-edged beside the pitch. Danushka calls for a single, and they make it"
"back of a length and angling in on middle, Danushka twirls his wrists and picks the ball up over midwicket"
"just short of a good length and outside off, sits up to be hit. Danushka obliges and swings it over the wide long-on boundary"
"Danushka runs down the track, this ball is angled in and bouncing over the stumps"
"slower cutter floating down leg, past the pull, leg-side wide"
"full and straight, slower cutter, 107ks, he gets inside the line. Picks the change-up and hoists it over backward square leg. Lovely use of the wrists from Danushka. These two are putting on a show in Colombo"
"This looks like another slower cutter from Unadkat. Danushka moves away outside leg stump, he is too early into the loft, ends up chipping a catch to Pant at mid-off. Good contributions from both bat and ball from Danushka. Rohit calls his boys into a huddle"
"in-between length on off, shovelled away wide of midwicket"
"floats an offbreak outside off, Chandimal lets it slide off the face through the gap at cover. He runs back for the third"
back of a length and skidding into a back-foot punch to mid-on
"sliding in from around the wicket, jabbed to mid-on again"
"back of a length on off, he can't get the ball past mid-on"
"worked with the break to short fine leg. This, by the way, is <b>SL's best Powerplay score in T20Is</b>"
"back of a length and turns in, whipped across to deep midwicket off the back foot"
"tossed outside off, Chandimal shimmies out, gets close to the pitch, and drives to long-off"
"Bam! What a sight this is. A helmet-less Kusal Perera surges down the track, Chahal tosses it wide outside off. Kusal still connects and nails it into the sightscreen"
"flatter and shorter outside off, whipped past midwicket. A fumble in deep from Vijay Shankar allows a second. Signs of nerves. Chahal blows off some steam"
punched off the pads to wide long-on
"dropped short and wide outside off, the ball keeps following Vijay Shankar. Chopped away to the left of sweeper cover"
"back of a length and outside off, drilled through the line, short extra cover throws himself to his left and keeps Kusal to a single. He<strong> brings up a 22-ball fifty</strong>. A hug from Chandimal is part of the celebrations"
"good length and ducks in at off, 130ks, inside-edged onto the pad for one"
"wide of the crease, angling in, as Kusal flits around the crease, jabbed back to Vijay"
"dug in short on the leg stump, short-armed away to deep square leg"
"back of a length and just a shade outside off, punched on the up to the off-side sweeper for one"
"Kusal shifts outside leg, Vijay holds his own and digs in a bouncer wide outside off. Left alone in the end. There was no way the batsman could have reached that"
"skidder outside off, bounces over the cut, and bounces out of the keeper's gloves"
"another skidder, inside-edged onto the pad"
"Chandimal steps down the track, Chahal lobs it outside off and gets it to break away. The SL captain reaches out and flat-bats it past the bowler"
"Chandimal uses his feet and nudges it gently into the vacant spaces at midwicket, so gently that he gets back for the second"
"<strong>Chahal bursts through the defences of Chandimal</strong> and provides India with the breakthrough. This was the fast flipper, think it was out of the front of the hand, Chandimal plays across the line, loses his shape, and misses to have his stumps in a mess"
"full and sliding across off, draws Tharanga forward, and <strong>goes past the outside edge</strong>"
"short, wide, Kusal goes back and chops to sweeper cover"
"tossed up on off stump, Tharanga presses forward and pushes the ball to cover"
"flatter and quicker outside off, tapped to the off side"
"dangled up outside off, he sweeps and wears it on the pad outside the line. They sneak in a leg bye, though. <strong>100 up for Sri Lanka</strong>"
"slid through on middle, backs away and punches down to long-off."
"looped up on middle and leg, forward and dabbed to midwicket"
steps out and drills this straight back to Chahal
"fires this wide in anticipation of Kusal giving him the charge, will have to rebowl that"
"shortish on the stumps, punched back to Chahal, who parries this towards short midwicket"
top-edges this sweep but there's no one at short fine to come around. Poor hit-me delivery down leg and put away. That will release the hint of pressure there may have been
steps out and works this full delivery down to long-on
"biffed into the stands at deep midwicket. Once again, too much flight from Chahal. Tharanga down on one knee as he swept that powerfully"
"googly this time, punched to cover where there's a misfield to give away a single. Chahal is so frustrated that he snatches the cap from the umpire"
lunges forward and eases this down to long-off
"he's played the switch-hit to perfection. Monstrous as he clears deep point with ease. This was too short from Raina, Kusal changed his bat grip in a jiffy and belted this away"
"touch short and outside off, flayed to Thakur at deep extra cover"
"nicely tossed up, driven with the spin to long-off"
makes a bit of room and punches this length ball to wide long-off
"chipped over the infield, down into the gap between deep cover and long-off. Sri Lanka cruising"
"tossed up from around the stumps, eased back to the bowler. Good stop off his own bowling"
"drifts in to middle and leg, he looks to nudge this to the leg side but the ball comes back into hit the pad and lon to the leg side"
"too far down leg as he shapes to sweep, good take by DK"
that's the end of that. It's the flight and dip that has done the trick for Kusal. Spun past the outside edge as he stepped out to go over the top and Karthik effects a smart stumping.
"tossed up on off, he lunges forward and blocks"
turns this full delivery back to the bowler with the spin
"excellent stop off his own bowling, this was punched back"
"cramps him for room with a shortish delivery on middle, defended back"
"swing and a miss. Late movement back in again, was through with the stroke way too early."
fetches this pull from outside off to deep square
"full and tailing into middle, eased down to long-on"
"<b> dropped by Rishabh Pant at midwicket. </b> How costly will that prove to be? Tharanga hurried for pace as he pulls that, Pant leapt high but didn't perhaps time his jump properly. That said, it was a tough chance"
"slower ball, Shanaka is through with this pull even before the ball gets to him, thuds into the thigh pad but they scamper a run. <b> Excellent comeback by Shardul after that walloping in his first over </b>"
"drags this short and wide outside off, slashed away towards deep point"
"mistimes this slog, off the thick inside edge towards deep midwicket"
"slow turn from middle, he turns this gently into the leg side for an easy single"
"right through as he misses the sweep. Chahal loops this in nicely, Tharanga looks to fetch this slog sweep from way outside off but is through with the stroke early and hears the ball rattle the stumps."
"fired full on leg stump, turned to midwicket"
"punched back to Chahal, who deflects this towards mid-off. Thisara will face up first in the next over."
"skiddy short ball, mistimes the pull towards midwicket"
"floats this a touch ahead of length on off stump, defended to the man coming in from cover."
"skids a length ball in from wide of the crease, he's hit on the right thigh as he shapes to pull. Beaten for pace. Excellent from Thakur"
"flat-bats this pull but there's no timing at all, down to long-on. Shanaka seems to be limping as well"
"looks to fetch this from outside off towards midwicket, toe-ends it to the man coming in from the circle"
"excellent short delivery outside off, hit the deck hard and got this to lift. Shanaka looked to swing this across the line but beaten. Top over from Thakur"
"slices this over the infield, falls in between the cover fielder and long-off running in."
"toe-ends a slog down the round, umpire had to take evasive action. From the camera angle we've got, it looked like he'd absolutely smashed that, but no."
"sees the batsman backing away and fires this wide, but ends up bowling this outside the wide line. Right thinking from Vijay, just that the execution didn't come out right. Useful run into the kitty for Sri Lanka"
"swung away towards deep backward square leg. Is this a no-ball? No, according to umpire Martinez. <b> Replays confirm this was well above the waist. </b> The crowd has seen it on the big screen and lets out a roar in disagreement. Surely the umpire has seen it too. Vijay lucky to get away"
"steps out to go over cover, ends up slicing this down towards third man. Once again lands short of the fielder"
"carved over point, top work in the deep by Shardul"
"flat-bats this over the infield, on the bounce to Raina at long-off. <b> 24 needed off the last three </b>"
beaten by a slower length ball from around the stumps. Backed away to force this behind point but is beaten by the slowness of the delivery. This one gripped the surface
"belted over cover. This is another slower ball, Shanaka held his shape, made room and gave this a proper whack. A little too predictable this time from Unadkat. This sat up nicely for him to hit that"
"swing and a miss. Goes length, this time he was through with the pull."
"another wild heave, misses. But they scamper a leg-bye as the ball deflects off the thigh into the off side. Looked to go over square leg."
"excellent from Unadkat....Oh, no. Called wide and I think that's a harsh call. This was full, away from the batsman and well inside the wide line. But the umpire didn't think so. Thisara was backing away"
"in his swinging arc and Thisara has belted this over the long-off boundary. This was just too full, right down his alley. That's his favourite length."
looks for a yorker but this ends up being a low full toss which Thisara belts back over Unadkat's head to the long-on boundary this time. That has firmly tilted the scales in Sri Lanka's favour
slides a full-length delivery down leg. Easy call for the umpire this time
drives this length ball to cover as they scamper a run
"short on middle, he's pulled this down to deep square as they hare for the second."
"backs away and pulls this short ball into the deep square leg boundary. <b> Hugs, fist pumps and roar in the Sri Lankan camp. </b> Premadasa goes wild, a strong crowd in excess of 20,000 have had their monies worth. What a game!"
