"back of a length, slight angle into the corridor, sliced with a high elbow for a single to third man"
"some bounce, a mix-up, but Rahane is quickly through for the single and after Dhawan drops this angled bouncer behind point with soft hands"
"good length, no movement, slight width and left alone"
"136kph, length ball angled in at off stump, solidly defended off the back foot"
"good length at off stump, gets behind the line and opens the face to punch this past cover...it bobbles on the spongy outfield, doesn't go too far beyond the circle"
"back of a length at middle stump, spits up at Rahane who takes his bottom hand off and fends in front of his thigh guard. Trickles down to fine leg off the glove"

"angled down leg side at a length, tucked off the hips to fine leg"
"full outside off stump, barely any feet from Dhawan as he looks for a big cover drive. Slow pitch, and he's through early. The bat turns in his hand and it dribbles gently to mid-off"
"big appeal, but big inside edge. This one swings in viciously from a length and strikes Dhawan in front of leg. Probably going down too"
"back of a length at off stump, defended off the back foot with an angled bat"
"shot. Marginally short and wide, and enough time for Rahane to hold his shape and get leg side of this before carving it behind point"
"back of a length at off stump, closes the face too early on the attempted glance, it falls pitch-side"
"good length, angled in at the pads,clipped straight to fine leg"
"<b>Dhawan has a single digit score</b> after nine 50-over innings for India. A tame shot. This is slightly short and climbing in the corridor. He arches back and looks to lift this over to the third man region - not clever, considering third man is in place. He finds him perfectly"
"back of a length at off stump, defended into the off side with the outside half of the bat"
"ooh, yes. More bounce. This is steep from back of a length, and would have had a fending Kohli in trouble if it weren't wide outside off and moving further away"
"good length outside off stump, nice forward stride to leave it alone"
"back of a length outside off stump, shape away, left alone again"
"back of a length, angled in at off stump, straightens slightly and squares him up as he defends into the off side"
"short and wide outside off, skids through quickly from under his attempted cut shot"
"well, he had to get a boundary there eventually. Good length, angled into Rahane's pads once more and this time he has reached out enough, and timed the closing of his wrists properly. Four past the keeper"
"some outswing, but too short and wide outside off stump. Rahane lets it go"
"back of a length at off stump, gets behind the line, pokes it into the off side, steals the single"
"another awkward bouncer, this one headed for Rahane's ribs. Takes his eyes off the ball along with the bottom hand off the bat, survives"
"good length, leg stump, plays this one later than the earlier ones and tucks it past square leg to pick up the double"
"shot. Inconsistent bowling, and he's made to pay. Short and wide now, Rahane quickly in position and it's a regal slap through point"
"good length, just outside off stump, left alone"
"good length at off stump, defended into the off side off the front foot"
"back of a length outside off stump, left alone, nice carry through"
"back of a length again, just outside off stump. Trying to draw that poke from Kohli, but he's happy to leave. For now."

"back to short of a length, just outside off stump, Kohli chases again but it's a mistimed bunt into the off side"
"heave your sighs, West Indian fans. Follows up a nice set up outside off stump with a full toss at leg stump that is duly flicked to the square leg boundary"
"overpitched, middle stump, slight shuffle before looking to flick this. The timing is missing. Midwicket cleans up to his right"
"good length at off stump, defended off the back foot"

"nice. Back of a length, slight shape away from the corridor, left alone"
"full outside off stump, big stride to push this to mid-off. Then holds his shape and wonders whether that should have been driven"
"good length, off stump, dropped into the off side for a quick single"
"oh hurries him. Good line and length. So far. This jumps at Kohli as he looks to defend off the back foot, just outside off and climbs past the bat"
"<b>in the air</b> but Kyle Hope has overrun at backward point! Oh, that's some misjudgement. Holder gets another short one to climb outside off, Kohli fends at it aimlessly and gets it off the shoulder of the bat. Hope is too excited as this lobs up in the air and runs in too quickly; he's diving backwards and to his left in the end. It's a single to third man. Holder was certain he had got his counterpart"
"short and wide outside off stump, left alone"
"brace yourselves. Another bouncer in the corridor and this time Kohli goes for the hook. Comprehensively beaten. He's an annoyed man now, is Kohli"
"back of a length outside off stump, watchfully left alone"
"back of a length at middle stump, shuffles across and tucks this off his mid-riff to square leg. Rahane wants the run, but he's sent back. Gets in between the stumps and the throw on his way back, but it wasn't intentional"
"ah, he's camping on the back foot now and he gets a short ball at leg stump. On his toes quickly, and whips this fine with agile hands"
shot. Straight to mid-off. Leans in nicely on this full ball outside off stump

"good length at off stump, pushed on the up to mid-off"
"back of a length at off stump, open-faced defence into the gully region"
"<b>oh good catch!</b> Kyle Hope has made amends! Back of a length outside off stump, he's on the front foot early and then he sees this lift up off the pitch. It's chest height and he pokes at it. Thick outside edge that hangs to the left of gully for a moment, before the fielder there, Hope, leaps one-handed to his left and gets rid of Kohli. Holder has his man"
"short ball at the ribs, middle stump-ish, he jumps up to tuck this behind square, can't get it past the keeper"
"good length, corridor, defended to point with an open face"
"<b>hello!</b> There's something in this pitch at the moment. This is slanted across off stump, back of a length. Yuvraj wants to defend off the back foot, but the bat is barely offered as this fizzes past the outside edge"
"good length, off stump, solidly defended into the off side"
"back of a length at middle stump, turned off his thigh to deep square"
"short ball, aimed for the throat, but not quite quick enough for this pitch. Yuvraj inside the line as he ducks this"

"full outside off stump, defended into the off side off the front foot"

"back of a length, starts on leg stump, swings further down and past the flick"

"back of a length outside off stump, mistimed back foot punch, straight back to the bowler"

"back of a length, pushed through flat at middle stump, poked to midwicket"

"good length, flat, middle stump, flicked to midwicket"
"good length, angled down leg"
"<b>edge flies past the keeper.</b> Back of a length, climbing in the corridor as he slashes at this. A healthy outside edge, but there's no slip"

"short ball, corridor, drops the bat, lets it go"
"yikes. Sharp bounce. This is dug in short, but I don't think he expected it to get that high when delivered it. Rahane gets everything out of the way outside off, falls to the floor, as he leaves this"

"short now, rising just over waist high, angling into the body. Rahane pulls to deep square leg"
"oh man. <b>No slip in place</b>, and this one goes through that vacant space at chest height. Back of a length, angling into the corridor. Again Yuvraj goes for that open-faced steer, and this one bounces a touch extra and flies off the edge"

"flat, shortish, just outside off, pulled to deep midwicket"

"length ball close to off stump, defended firmly to cover"
"again that dangerous open-faced steer. Back of a length, slanting into the corridor, waits and steers to third man"
"another full slower ball outside off, another leave from Rahane. The ball rolls through to Shai Hope"
"another slower ball outside off, this time Rahane gets a big stride forward and punches to mid-off"
"ooh, good ball. Bangs it in short and angles it in from wide of the crease. Rahane bends down low at the knees, sways his upper body away from the line, and keeps his eye on the ball, looking to ramp it to third man. Can't put bat to ball, though"

"back of a length on off stump, punched to extra-cover"
back of a length on off and middle. This time Rahane swings his front leg out of the way and pulls down to long-on
"tosses it up and gets it to dip onto a good length on leg stump. Beats the inside edge as he comes forward to defend, hits front pad. Probably sliding down leg. <b>Hang on, ball-tracking suggests it was hitting middle stump</b>. Didn't turn as much as I thought. Not much of an appeal at all"
"back of a length now, punched to midwicket"
"tossed up nicely on middle stump, gets a good stride forward to defend"

"on middle and off now, driven to long-on"
"back of a length, skids through quickly and hits Rahane's in front of middle stump as he tries to play across the line. Probably an inside-edge, again not much of an lbw appeal"
"fuller now, driven to long-on"
"top-edge, but that's in the gap. Sweeps from middle and leg, and it was a little too quick for him to get down fully. Ball bounces a touch extra. Into the gap to the right of short fine leg"
"shortish and flat on leg stump, punched to long-on"
"back of a length, tucks him up for room, punched to midwicket"

"shhortish, some width, chopped to short third man"
"quickish length ball just outside off, stays back to stab into the covers"
"flat, just outside off, looks to make room to cut but it isn't short enough. Bends low to chop into the cover point region"
"lbw appeal, much louder this time, as Yuvraj comes forward hesitantly to defend. Given not out, they've reviewed this time... Again Bishoo gets it to dip onto a lovely length - straightens just enough to clip the front pad before it hits Yuvraj's inside edge. He's only half forward. Pitches just inside the line, leg-stumpish, and ball-tracking says it's hitting off stump. Excellent delivery, not the greatest technique against spin, and Yuvraj has to go"
"good ball first up, flighted, just outside off. Dhoni isn't fully forward to drive, compensates with a roll of his bottom wrist to play that towards short extra-cover"
"quicker now, a little closer to off stump, jabbed towards short extra-cover again"
a bit more flight and he's out of his crease to push down to long-on
"back of a length, slides on with the angle towards off stump. Rahane wants to punch through cover point but he's cramped for room, plays it a short distance to the left of the bowler instead"

"short outside off, cut away to that man at deep point/sweeper cover again"
"seems to be his stock ball for the over, short and wide. This time it doesn't quite come on. Rahane slaps it straighter than previously and Lewis dives left from extra-cover to stop it"
"back of a length, closer to off stump, punched to long-off"
"shortish, angling in from wide of the crease and denying Rahane room to cut. Chops it down to backward point"
"shortish outside off, gets on his toes to dab it down to third man and bring up fifty"
"shortish on off stump, played down to midwicket with a turn of the wrists"
"short in the corridor, jumps to ride the bounce and stabs it into the gap between backward point and cover point. Prioritised placement over power there, deft use of the hands"
"shortish, angling into off stump, uses the angle to work it down to long leg"
"ooh, that's awkward from Dhoni. Short, rising ball in the fifth-stump channel, and Dhoni, for some reason, jumped across and closed his bat face to play into the on side. Thick outside edge runs away to the third man boundary. Looks like the ball jammed his right thumb into the handle"
"full, flat, wide of off, left alone"

"back of a length, close to off stump, punched to extra-cover"

"ooh, extra bounce outside off. Short, Rahane wanted to pull, and he half-aborted the shot as the ball rose above his shoulder"
"short again, this one doesn't get up much, only to hip height. Keeps his eye on it and plays a controlled pull down to long leg"
"digs it in again, this time it gets up to neck height. Angled into the body again and he's off his feet, drops his bottom hand, and keeps it down well enough despite fending a little awkwardly at it"
"ooh, Dhoni in a tangle again. Flat and full on off stump. Looks to jab into the covers without much of a front-foot stride. Goes with the angle and hits his inside edge, rolls into the leg side"
"not too much room to cut, stabbed to backward point"
this one's wider but he cuts straight to backward point
"full and flighted wide of off, left alone"
"a touch short outside off, chopped into the cover point region"
"back of a length outside off, punched to extra-cover"
"back of a length on off stump, jumps back and across to defend towards mid-on"
"short, rising to shoulder height, plays a half-pull, half defensive jab down to midwicket"
"straighter now, tucked off the hip to fine leg"
"getting a little predictable with his length here, and Rahane may have premeditated a little. Short, rising over off stump, and he cleared his front leg almost before Holder had delivered, and swivelled to pull, just about clears the forward square leg boundary. Hits the cushions on the full, actually"
looks for that ramp over the keeper this time. He likes that shot whenever it's short and rising outside off. Couldn't put bat on ball this time

"jumps down the track, meets the good length ball at the pitch, drives to long-off"

"slider, full and wide outside off stump, Dhoni shoulders arms, it was just inside the marker"
"short ball, slid through outside off stump, under-edges the cut into the off side"

"full and drifted away from off stump, driven straight to extra cover"

"dropped short outside off stump, clubbed, flat-batted past the bowler. That off side field is impenetrable so he goes straight"
<b>well there is the slog</b> and it's ended up being a top edge that neither midwicket - running back - nor long-on - running in - can get to. An old fashioned slog sweep gone wrong and in the end it's two caps and a ball on the floor
"back of a length at off stump, pushed to extra cover"
"<b>dropped.</b> Dhoni steps out, can't get to the pitch outside off stump. Swipes across the line and gets a leading edge that hangs agonisingly for backward point who dives to his left and can't hold on. Catchable."

"catch it...says no one. Full ball outside off stump, gets under it and creams it over the bowler's head"
"back of a length outside off stump, cut to find sweeper cover"
tossed up wide outside off stump. An ugly heave from Rahane. Gets the sweep off the toe to deep midwicket

"legcutter this time, length outside off stump, punched on the up to sweeper cover"
"legcutter, good length, just outside off stump. Leans in, pokes it to point with an open face"
"good length, angled in at middle stump. Hits him on the thigh and there's a big appeal, but umpire deems bat was also involved as Rahane looked to flick with no feet"
stage fright first up. Sees the batsman advance and fires this wayyyy wide outside off stump
"back of a length with a lot of width. Rahane gets under it, hits it on the up to sweeper cover's right. Bishoo there is very nimble as he cuts it off inches from the boundary, on the bounce to his right. Flicks it back in, recovers and keeps it to two"
"<b>sensational catch</b> from Bishoo. Showed great awareness to his right the previous ball, and this time he jogs to his left from sweeper cover and times a dive perfectly to catch low to his left. Back of a length from Cummins, Rahane looked to find the gap over point, but there was no width, skewed it uppishly"
"back of a length outside off stump, Dhoni skips across to get inside the line and ramp it past short fine. Not enough connection, the fielder gets across to his left"

"yorker at off stump, tapped into the covers for a single"

"legcutter, too full. A full toss, in fact, wide outside off stump. Driven to sweeper cover"
"good length at off stump, pushed into the off side off the front foot"
"nice. Offcutter, good length outside off stump. Jadhav was set to pick the midwicket boundary but was forced to poke at it outside off stump. Beaten on the outside edge in the end"
"hangs deep in the crease this time, anticipates the offcutter, and opens the face to perfection to run it past short third man. The fielder gives chase and pulls it back in with a tumble at the boundary"
"slower ball, full outside off stump, pushed to extra cover"
"steps out and gets awkwardly under a bouncer. Looking to hook it while also avoiding the impact. It hangs in the square leg region, where there's no fielder"
"camps outside the off stump, whips the full ball from out there, finds deep midwicket"
"back of a length outside off stump, flat-batted punch on the up, sweeper keeps it to one"
"camping outside off stump again and he shows why. He's seen a gap at the square leg boundary and this time he has picked it. Holder had no other go - had to follow the batsman. He was set up and he couldn't do much. It's a full toss in the end, and he sweeps it over the square leg fielder"
"this time he shuffles and stays leg side of the ball, picks it from outside and executes a square drive, gets it wide of third man"

slower bouncer. Jadhav runs down the pitch at it and swats hard. Can't make a connection. 3 off 4 this over.
"attempted yorker, misses out. It's a low full toss at middle stump though, and he can't get under it. Single to long-on"
"slower ball, full at leg stump, walks at it and tries to flick. Gets it into the leg side off his pad"
"awwww yesssssss! It's Dhoni time. Stands tall, watches this slower ball fall into his arc outside off stump and brings down the hammer on it to lift it over the bowler's head before swiveling to show signs of life"
"superb. Superb. That square leg boundary is still open for Holder and Dhoni picks it with a powerful shovel. This ball was overpitched outside off, like the last one, but the swivel comes early this time and the bat swing takes it over the ropes"
"full outside off stump, chopped down to third man"
"slower ball, yorker outside off stump. Shuffles and misses out on the room, tries to chop it late to third man. Gets an inside edge into the pitch and through to the keeper"
"slower ball outside off stump, full and close to the batsman, who can only hit this to long-off"
"cruel from Dharmasena. This one swings back in from a length outside off, and looks like it's inside the marker as Dhoni lets it go"
"shuffles across, bludgeons the full ball from outside off to long-off's left, but Rovman puts in a good, timely dive to keep that to two"
"legcutter, back of a length at off stump. Driven back on the up, very hard, but the bowler gets low to stop it"
"slapped! It's a slower ball at a good length, on a slow pitch, outside off stump. Not my problem, says Jadhav as he picks it neatly over the midwicket boundary"
"full at middle stump, nice clip off the toes as he walks across the stumps, but he can't get it past short fine"
"slower short ball outside off stump, stops Dhoni's charge and forces him to respectfully fend it to point for a single"
"Jadhav charges another bouncer, gets cramped and gets another top edge. There is a square leg this time unlike before, but he gets it into the open midwicket area"
"full ball outside off stump, poked into the off side"
"back of a length outside off stump, a big heave from Dhoni ends up a toe-ended pull to long-on. He's disappointed with himself"
oh what a freak this guy is. Batting stances are over-rated. Jadhav is waiting on his back knee like he wants to put a ring on this ball before it is delivered. It's good length outside off stump and it's perfect for him. He's planned this all along. Can't get any more under it as he sweeps this over square leg
"low full toss at middle stump, flicked out to deep midwicket"
"legcutter, short and down leg side. Dhoni exposes all his stumps as he looks to pull this, but he misses out"
"short and wide outside off stump, tries to club this over the off side boundaries, but it's a thick slice that Bishoo can only get to on the bounce from sweeper cover"
"full ball at off stump, goes hard with the drive, gets it off the bottom of the bat to long-on"
whack...but Bishoo is on a mission to keep Dhoni quiet today. This time he's quickly across to his right at sweeper cover as Dhoni gets all of a drive on the up to a length ball
"can't get bat on this bouncer. He was backing away, he got followed, and he awkwardly fell to the floor as he avoided it"
"sweet. Doesn't back away too much this time, just gets the front leg out of the way, makes room and is gifted with a length ball at middle stump. Duly lifts it inside-out past mid-off"
"another bouncer, again he's forced to get out of the way. Good comeback"
"ah, Kesrick. He's done everything right. Another bouncer has Jadhav in trouble with feet pointed in different directions, face pointed skywards and an angled bat. It's four over the keeper"
"slower short ball outside off, Jadhav has to reach out to get bat on it, bunts it towards mid-off"
"shot. Mid-off is in, the length ball arrives. It's a slower one. No worries. He waits, then he reaches out and lofts it wide of the fielder in the infield to push India past 250"
"full, pitching just outside off and slanting further away with a bit of away swing. Left alone"
"back of a length on off stump, goes back and across to push to the right of midwicket. A little risky, given that Jadhav throws right-handed, and Lewis was gone had his throw hit direct at the bowler's end"
"length ball, fifth-stump line, left alone"
"ooh, good ball. Late inswing towards off stump. Hope keeps his head nice and still and clips through backward square leg to pick up his first run"
"back of a length in the corridor, a bit of extra bounce. Jabs away from his body, slightly, and gets a thickish edge down to third man"
"length ball close to off stump, defended to short extra-cover"
"full, some swing, but it swings a long way down the leg side"
"shortens his length slightly, but the line is still too straight. Swings down the leg side and Dhoni, stretching to his right to try and stop it, gets hit on the fingertips"
"back of a length, some swing in towards off stump, defended towards cover point"
"bowled him, that's an absolute beauty. Hits just the right length, swings back in, and hits off stump as Lewis, jumping back and across and still on the move, jabs hurriedly, bat coming down from gully and creating a gap for the ball to sneak through. That was quick, close to 142kph, and Lewis was late on the ball. Kept slightly low too, but he should have been going forward, considering the length"
"length ball swinging away in the corridor, left alone"
"once again, big outswing in the corridor outside off. Hope leaves alone"
"and again, Shai Hope leaves a perfectly pitched outswinger pitching just outside off stump"
"good ball, a little shorter and hurring on towards off stump, no swing this time. Jumps up and tucks it away through backward square leg"
"length ball swinging in towards off stump. Feels for the ball a little, but plays with soft hands, and it rolls away off the outside half of the bat towards third man"
"back of a length outside off, steered down to third man"
"back of a length again, fifth-stump line, jabbed away to third man"
"once again, back of a length. Punches firmly into the covers and takes off. Kyle wants a single, Shai doesn't. Kohli moves quickly to his left from cover, spins around, and throws at the keeper's end. Kyle is a long way out, but the throw misses"
"still back of a length, some inswing towards the thigh pad, tucked into the backward square leg region"
"oh, beauty. Length ball swinging in, pitching just outside off, and straightening ever so slightly. Shai Hope doesn't do too much wrong, plays for the swing, looking to defend towards mid-off, and it zips past his outside edge"
"back of a length, curves away late away from off stump, left alone"
"back of a length, angling into the legs, worked into the square leg region. Looks like he missed, and it rolled off the thigh pad. Given that there are three slips, it went into a big vacant area, with only mid-on and long leg on the leg side"
"a little fuller in the corridor, some away shape. Left alone"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"full outside off, driven to mid-off"
"angles down the leg side now, pitching just back of a length. Umesh may have been looking for a bit of swing to take it towards the stumps"
"back to that tight line just outside off, and Hope leaves it alone"
"back of a length on off stump, defended to mid-off"
"back of a length, some swing in towards off stump, defended into the point region"
"shortish, tucking Hope up for room. Jumps up to try and work it leg side, the ball rolls off the thigh pad towards midwicket"
"shot. Just a bit of width, and a touch short as well. Stands tall and punches between backward point and cover point"
"back of a length outside off, punched to short extra-cover"
"shortish, swinging in towards middle and leg, jabbed down to midwicket"
"short, rising ball in the corridor. Jumps to ride the bounce and defend down towards point. He's looked quite comfortable so far, Kyle Hope, apart from that mix-up"
"shot. Length ball swinging away just a touch in the channel outside off. Waits, shows the full face, and punches down the ground. Mid-off does well to dive to his right and stop it"
"back of a length, close to off stump, jabbed back towards the bowler"
"shortish, not a lot of width, stays next to the line and chops it down to backward point"
"full, no swing this time, angles down the leg side. He's been swinging it from off stump, but not from middle and leg. That's why that magic ball is so difficult to bowl"
"back of a length on middle stump, punched to mid-on"
"back of a length in the corridor, lets it come on and defends to cover point"
"back of a length, a bit of inswing to deny room. Wants to punch through cover but can only punch it back to the bowler"
"all those dot balls has led to a false shot. Falls in no-man's land, thankfully for Hope. Looks to hook from well outside off, gets a thick outside edge that drops down a long way to the left of third man"
"back of a length outside off, blocked into the point region"
"short, a bit of width, and Ashwin's diving effort at third man isn't quite good enough to stop this. Deliberately cuts in the air, over backward point. Ashwin gets a hand to it with a dive to the right, but it bursts out of his fingers and rolls into the rope"
"length ball close to off stump, and that's nicely played. Lets it come on and pushes towards mid-on, putting just enough weight on that shot to give himself time to scurry to the other end"
"shortish, just a bit of width, and that's a super shot from Shai Hope. Rocks back, flat-bats it hard, and finds the gap to the right of cover point"
"back of a length, and Umesh slants one down the leg side, not for the first time today"
"back of a length outside off, punched to the left of mid-off"
"straighter now, on middle and leg, goes back and punches with a straight bat to the right of mid-on"
"back of a length on middle and leg, worked away through backward square leg"
"short, angling into middle stump and tucking up Kyle. Jumps, stays leg-side of the ball, and chops it down into the covers"
"back of a length, close to off stump, defended into the covers"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended to mid-off"
"back of a length, a bit of swing in towards off and middle, punched to mid-on"
"bouncer, well directed, rising over off stump. Shai Hope quickly ducks under it"
"back of a length again, angling into off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"back of a length again, outside off this time, punched to cover point"
"once again, back of a length. The little bit of inward movement he's getting is ensuring Hope doesn't get any width. Shows the full face and punches it back to the bowler"
"same length, a bit of extra bounce this time. Wants to push into the covers or towards mid-off. Gets an inside edge, off the high part of the bat, and it rolls down into the square leg region"
"full now, just outside off with a bit of away swing. Hope takes only a short front-foot stride, ends up driving away from his body. Inside-edges into his pad"
"short, rising ball close to off stump, jumps to ride the bounce and defend with soft hands"
"back of a length, angling into middle and off, defended into the covers"
"and Hope edges this into the gap to that gully fielder's left. Back of a length again, a bit of away movement and bounce. He jabs at it without much footwork and gets a thick edge"
"fuller and straighter now, angling into middle stump, clipped to midwicket"
"length ball on middle and off, defended into the covers"
"starts off with a wide full ball, driven to deep point"
"back of a length, some width again, punched out to deep point"
"oh my, that's an awful shot. Length ball, fifth-stump line, and he looks to slog it over mid-on. Hoick and miss"
"digs it in short now, and that's not the most perfectly controlled pull. Top-edges it, but it still goes quite a distance, bouncing a few yards from the rope between long leg and deep square leg"
"fullish outside off, left alone"
"shortish outside off, and that's a nicely timed back-foot stab, hits firmly into the ground and it bounces up above backward point's head. Does well to reach overhead and stop it, Rahane the fielder"
"full on leg stump, driven inside-out to the left of long-off"
"length ball turning in towards middle and leg, defended to midwicket"
"a bit of drift across towards off stump, hangs in the air and drops on a good length. Defended to short extra-cover"
"drops it short now, turns sharply in to cramp Hope, who was looking to pull. Adjusts and works it to deep backward square leg"
"full on middle stump, defended to midwicket"
"ah, beauty. Lovely, lovely delivery. Floated up across the right-hander, achieves some away-drift too. Comes forward to defend, playing for the stock ball, but this is the wrong'un and it spins past his outside edge"
"short, rising ball in the corridor. Was looking initially to jump up and cut, but it just kept climbing steeply, and he adjusted and dropped his wrists under the ball"
"back of a length close to off, punched to deep point"
"lucky runs. Bouncer outside off, and Kyle shapes to hook initially before deciding to leave. He left the bat pointing up, though, and it hits the edge and flies to the fine leg boundary. Could have gone anywhere"
"this time he does go for the hook, taking it from over his right shoulder, and only manages a top-edge that drops into the hands of deep square leg, who walks a few yards in from the rope and takes it comfortably"
"back of a length outside off, punched to deep point"
"shortish, close to off stump, lets it come on and guides to third man"
"tossed up on off stump, driven to long-off. Chase had to wait to read the drift before he could plant his front foot"
"there's the googly again, and India have appealed for a stumping. Beautifully bowled again, the length was just perfect. Stretches out, reaches in front of his body to defend, and the ball spins past his outside edge. He's stretched out a long way, but his toes are planted just about firmly enough, behind the crease"
"length ball turning in towards leg stump. Looked like Hope picked it off the pitch. Pressed forward, then withdrew his pad away from the line to work it into the square-leg region"
"oh my, that was just brilliant. Not the greatest shot from Chase, though. It's a shot he takes on even against the legspinners, trusting his reach to be able to whip balls against the turn through midwicket, but here it went all wrong - firstly, I don't think he picked the googly, and that meant he was playing down the wrong line and off balance. The ball spun past his shot and hit off stump. Did I mention playing down the wrong line - it's also because it drifted a long way from outside leg and pitched just about on leg stump"
"wrong'un outside off, defended off the back foot"
"too full now, flighted liberally and pitching outside off, driven confidently to the cover boundary"
"back of a length outside off, dabbed to backward point"
"back of a length, a bit of inward seam movement towards off stump, punched away through cover point"
"short, fairly wide outside off, left alone. Wasn't too far from the tramline"

"tossed up outside leg, swept to deep backward square leg"
"tossed up full on off stump, a lovely big stride out, head right over the ball, to drive to long-off"
"nicely bowled, full with some drift away towards middle and off, defended into the covers"
"back of a length at off stump, very late back foot defence crashes into the floor, and goes straight to point"
"good length at middle stump, defended into the leg side on the up"
short and way down the leg side...and Dhoni lets a regulation take through. Umesh sprints to his right at fine leg and puts in a full-blooded dive to keep it to two
"back of a length outside off, cross-seam so it skids through low...under the attempted punch"
"<b>near-perfect bouncer</b> and that's the end of Shai Hope. He's angry with himself. It was an ordinary shot, but a very well-directed short one from Hardik. Shai was late on the hook as he tried to pick it from in front of his right shoulder. Top-edge onto helmet and an easy lobbed catch for Hardik"
"fierce bouncer in the corridor, left well alone"
"good length outside off stump. The kind of sucker delivery that might been pushed aerially by a shorter batsman, but Holder's reach allows him to squeeze the drive past point on the up"
"back of a length at middle stump, whipped to deep midwicket off the back foot"
"good length, middle stump, tucked off the back foot to deep midwicket"
"back of a length at the hips, and the leg glance lands short of leg slip"
"good length, pitches on leg stump, spins past the sweep and Dhoni as well...trickles to the fine leg boundary and is given runs"
"wrong'un, picked off the pitch from a good length and defended. Dhoni was down leg side with that one. This guy is difficult to pick"
"short and wide outside off stump, no need to try and pick the direction of that. Only has to decide where to put it, and he sends it to the deep cover boundary with a cut"
"good length at off stump, pushed on the up to mid-off"
"good length at off stump, defended on the up to point"
"balance. Stands tall, times this push past mid-off. Regulation good length ball outside off"

"back of a length outside off stump, half-prod, half-leave, full edge. Down to third man for a single"
"bouncer outside off stump, big Holder sways away from it easily"
"back of a length, off stump, punched to extra cover"
"good length, middle stump, flicked behind square on the leg side"
"nicely drifted away, good length, off stump, respectfully defended"
"a stumping appeal down the leg side. It's a wide, Holder was down and he looks very out. It's been referred. Yes, the foot wasn't down. It was a poor delivery, short and spinning down leg. Dhoni gathers, whips the bails off, and then appeals for a caught behind too - the straight umpire only signals wide. Hardik Pandya at square leg has a big smile when the leg umpire makes the signal for a replay"
"good length, pushed flat at middle stump, defended back down the pitch"
"good length at leg stump, makes him reach out and beats him down the leg side. Another wide"

"tossed up outside off stump, driven to long-on with the turn"
"good length, middle stump, well-connected sweep, finds long leg"
"good length, pushed flat outside off stump, poked into the off side off the front foot"
"Caught behind and it's been reviewed. Arm ball from Ashwin, drifts away with the seam position. Seems to beat the outside edge, but keeper and slip are confident. Well, they're wrong. Snicko shows no disturbance and this will be overturned. Very good delivery, took off from a length outside off stump, and there was no noticeable change in the hand from Ashwin"
"good length at leg stump, brushes the pad and runs away fine"
"good length at middle stump, pushed into the leg side"
"good length at middle stump, poked into the leg side off the front foot"

"back of a length at middle stump, gets in a poor position for the pull, but mistimes it well enough to fetch two to deep square leg's left"
"140kph, good length outside off stump. All his life coaches might have told him to bowl that delivery. Today he draws an edge too. But it runs away to the third man boundary"
"back of a length at off stump, gets on his toes to defend this into the off side"
"good length, fired in fast at leg stump, punched to deep midwicket's right off the back foot"

"good length at off stump, defended into the off side"
"good length, middle stump, forward defence down the pitch"
"good length, off stump, defended off the back foot"
"nice...from the bowler anyway. Good length at off stump, draws him forward and gets an outside edge. Rahane gets down too slowly at backward point"
"aw, come on. Quick and short at middle stump, he's looking towards the square leg boundary as he swats across the line, and gets a leading edge that goes past the keeper"
"back of a length at off stump, defended into the off side"
again. This time the edge goes higher and swerves towards fine leg after starting at a first slip kind of line. It's four more over the keeper as he looks to pull this from off stump

"short and slightly wide outside off stump. Gets it to bounce as well, but the cut is nicely controlled and placed well to sweeper cover's left"
"bouncer pitches outside off and dips in at the batsman, who sways backwards and leaves it alone"
<b>creamed.</b> That could well be the first controlled pull shot of the day. Short at off stump and he climbs into this off the front foot and slaps it through midwicket
"and he lets the next bouncer go, similar line to the last ball"
"glorious. Hardik bowls the full delivery, Powell is wary of the change up. Plants the front leg down to reach this outside off stump, and maintains the balance as he lifts this over mid-off"
"good length outside off stump, left alone. Why wouldn't he? 8 off the over already"
"back of a length, nips in and thuds into the thigh guard as he looks to defend, possibly via glove"

"carrom ball, full outside off stump. Angled bat offered, leading edge found."
"another carrom ball, full at middle stump, poked nervously off the front foot"

"good length at middle stump, defended off the inside half of the bat"
"<b>holes out.</b> The pressure was built, the time was ripe for a wrong'un, and pop it came. Good length, turning away from off stump, and climbing too steeply for that slog sweep. Hardik calls from long leg and deep midwicket allows him to get under it and pouch it comfortably"
"wrong'un, pitches outside leg stump and climbs from a length, awkwardly fended into the leg side"
"good length, pushed flat at middle stump. He walks across and plays this off middle stump, very late. Yuvraj forced to dive to his right at short fine"

"<b>Umesh dives and holds on to his left.</b> That's a very very good catch. This is tossed up at middle stump and it dips at Nurse, who is only worried about sending this flying over the midwicket boundary. He can't reach the ball and gets it off the inside half of a turning bat. Umesh leaps to his left at square leg to hold on to this"
"back of a length, turns in to cramp Mohammed, punched back to the bowler"
"fuller, on leg stump, blocked to midwicket"
"on off stump now, slower, goes deep in his crease to dab into the cover point region"
"length ball pitching outside leg and turning back into the stumps, Bishoo plays back, looks to flick, and the ball hits him on the pad"

tossed up on off stump and Mohammed pushes to mid-off for the quick single
"flat, angling into the pads, clipped to the right of midwicket"
"oh, that's a beauty. Did it turn enough, though? Sliding down leg, I think. Loads of drift into the left-hander from around the wicket to strike pad. Didn't seem to straighten enough as he looked to drive to mid-off, played outside the line"
"not quite short enough to cut, plays and misses"
"tossed up now, defended back to the bowler"

"shortish on off stump, chopped away to the left of sweeper cover"
"googly, doesn't really turn, goes with the angle towards off stump and he goes on the back foot to defend"
"oh no. Mohammed was looking good, and now he's out to a poor choice of shot. Looks to sweep from the stumps, and goes after one that's too full. It hits his front foot almost on the full. Yorked the boot. He's called for a review, but this just looked plumb on first viewing... No inside-edge. Pitches on middle, straightening to hit low on middle, and it's even plumber after ball-tracking has its say"
"googly, flighted nicely outside off. Comes forward to defend and the inside edge pops up into the vacant short leg region. Kuldeep finishes with 3-41. He took three in the previous game too"
"there's that swinging arm ball again. Plays back to a fairly full ball, blocks to midwicket"
"play and miss, looks to stab at one that's a little shorter outside off, but it wasn't short enough"
"gone, that's Ashwin's 150th in ODIs. An excellent delivery to bring up the milestone. Cummins was playing everything off the back foot, and Ashwin bowled that arm ball again. It was too full to be playing back to, and by the time the bat came down in defence, it had slid through and struck his back pad in front of middle stump"
"oh, good ball. A bit of away-drift late in its flight even though it was fairly flat, on off and middle. Came forward, defended slightly inside the line, and the ball rolled towards backward point off the outside half of the bat"
"back of a length, that arm ball again, swinging towards off stump. Nicely back and across to defend"
"tossed up slower, just outside off, stretches out and defends with soft hands"
"the man has a golden arm, and he strikes first ball to finish off this match. Nicely bowled, a bit of drift away from the right-hander, who plays inside the line while defending. Beats the outside edge but spins back just enough to hit off stump"
