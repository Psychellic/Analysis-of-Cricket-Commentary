"fullish outside off stump, Smuts dabs defensively into the off side"
"length, gets this one to wobble a touch off the seam and it nips past the inside edge, bobbling through to the keeper"
"short of a length, sits up to be pulled, just a paddle around the corner from Smuts but it races away"
"bit of width, frees the arms to carve a drive, not much foot movement and he picks out point"
"length ball, slightly wide and Smuts stands and swings, again chops the ball towards point"
"angled in with the arm, 120kph on middle and off, tucked to midwicket and that completes a tidy first over for the SL captain"
"snakes in and lands the ball slightly back of a length outside off, Kuhn steers his first ball to point"
"outside off, good length and defended watchfully going back and across"
"drops short, Kuhn can swing the arms up through a roundhouse pull, but there's a man at deep square"
"good length on the stumps, tapped into the leg side"
"Kula gets this to swing back in, flicked off the pads... and well taken by a tumbling short fine leg! Slightly unfortunate for Smuts, connected fairly well with the leg glance and on another day it would have skipped away for four. Instead, he sent it low in the direction of Sandakan who got down smartly to his right"
slightly back of a length and driven into the covers
"comes forward, pushed square, there's a mix-up in the middle...but Dickwella's throw misses! Awful running, it probably wasn't on but they started, stopped, started again and eventually Kuhn was able to wander home as Dickwella couldn't hit one-and-a-half stumps from backward point"
"length ball on off stump, tapped back on the on side"
comes across and flicks a length ball for one through square
"tight lines from Mathews, de Bruyn gets across and blocks"
"some width, nibbles back off the seam, de Bruyn throws the hands - and chops past leg stump for four! This time the luck is with the batsman, skitters past short fine leg and away"
"pitched up in the channel, this time de Bruyn slices one down to third man"
"strikes first ball, scooped off the pads straight to deep square leg! A flaccid way to get out, flicking in the air to the man placed on the rope, Udana points to the skies and SL have their second"
tip and run into the off side... and the direct hit at the non-striker's end then ricochets away towards the boundary for a couple more!
"fired across the bows from over the wicket, stabbed into the ground, point cleans up... and Mosehle's strike rate is halved in a blink"
"good length, angled across the right-hander, lets this one go"
"full-length ball, Mosehle goes after it and slashes hard, opening the face to steer up and away over point - that's a boundary and he's back in business"
"length ball around the line of off, tapped down into the off side"
pitched up and pushed into the on side coming forwards
"length ball, stays back and scoops towards short fine leg, this could be trouble for Mosehle... but again the throw misses the stumps"
"in the channel, easy-paced and Mosehle opens the shoulders to slap a cut hard and wide of third man for another four"
"pitched up, comes forward and checks a drive into the covers"
"fullish, chops down on the ball towards point, this is another risky run and Mosehle is stretching, diving for the crease at the non-striker's end as the throw sails high and wide"
"good length outside off, steered calmly towards gully"
"pushed through on the stumps, worked square and they scamper one"
"there she blows! Tossed up and boomed into the stands at long-on! Good use of the feet from Kuhn, gets his shot right out of the middle - and takes him to a CB in international T20, too"
"flat outside off, goes back and carves a couple more through point"
"dragged down, there's some turn but it merely gives Kuhn room to swipe up and over cover, bounces away for four this time"
"floated up on off stump, punched towards mid-off"
"straightening just outside off stump, Mosehle goes back and dabs a single fine of short third man"
"starts very wide, possibly a googly, too, but Mosehle chases after it - and nicks to the keeper! Would have been wide if he had left it, the ball scuttling through over the tramline as Mosehle tried to cut and got a thin top edge. Sandakan strikes with his first ball in T20Is!"
"floated up, another googly that drifts on to the pads, deflected away for a couple"
"this is the regulation break from leg, plenty of revs on it, defended on off stump"
"another wrong'un, sprayed down the leg side, Chandi does well to get to it"
"tosses up the legbreak on middle and off, Miller blocks watchfully again"
"pushed through, Miller drops back and steers one square with the turn"
"round the wicket to Kuhn, who goes down on one knee and flips one more towards short fine leg"
"slow and wobbly on the stumps, Kuhn turns one off his pads"
"floated up, 88kph on leg stump, Miller works one through the leg side"
"another slower ball, Kuhn waits on it and works one more off the pads"
"well-directed cutter, this stops in the pitch and forces a mistimed dolly fine of extra cover. Miller a tad lucky there, as it runs away from Dhananjaya de Silva"
"wicket-to-wicket dibbly-dobbly, worked away for one more"
"length ball, the offcutter darts away from Miller and into the gloves - not the most eye-catching stuff from Gunaratne, but it's effective"
"flighted, on the stumps, punched back to the bowler"
"goes inside out and clears the fence at extra cover! Lovely striking from Kuhn, used the feet and pinged it"
"beats the bat, Chandimal whips off the bails... has Sandakan got him? They are going to check with the third umpire but Kuhn looks shifty, he had overbalanced and was struggling to get his foot back over the line. Yes, that's another, Kuhn clearly out of his ground! He was done by the googly, lunging after it as the ball spun past the outside edge, knew he was in trouble but couldn't shove any boot back over the line in time"
floated up and worked with the turn through midwicket
"tossed up and Miller nails his sweep, down low and hammering the ball flat to the square boundary. SA need him to go big again here"
"flighted, Miller stays in the crease and works this away to midwicket"
"trundles in and dobs the ball outside off, cutting it away as Miller swats a single to deep cover"
"length ball, coming back on from outside off, maybe a knuckle ball or another cutter, Behardien hops back and squirts it away to leg"
"loopy, fast-ish offbreak, Miller goes for the big heave-ho to leg but can only get a toe end back towards the bowler"

"wicket-to-wicket slows from Gunaratne, nudged away to leg for a single"
"pitched up, pace off, Miller taps down the ground to long-off"
"strikes first ball, Miller edging to slip! De Silva is grinning like a Cheshire cat, tosses the ball up and it grips on off stump as Miller goes for a punishing sweep, flicks the toe and loops to Mathews"
"tossed up on off stump, Parnell nudges it back to the bowler"
"pushed through, swing and a miss from Parnell, Chandimal (eventually) whips off the bails - but Parnell was safe"
"floated up and tapped down the ground coming forwards, Parnell off the mark"
"gives it a bit more air, across the right-handed Behardien, who steers one through the covers"
"oh, nearly a brilliant catch! Parnell dabbing off the back foot, Mathews anticipated it but couldn't hold on one-handed to his left"
"ooh, he's lost his line there, sprays the ball well outside off, pretty much straight to slip"
"floated up, another wide loosener, Parnell could have let it go for a wide but chooses to swat one through point"
"gets his line right now, Behardien pokes through the covers"
"floated up, maybe the googly, Parnell can only prod back to the bowler's left"
"got him, another for Sandakan! Parnell trying to reverse-sweep and sending an edge to slip"
""
"another, Phehlukwayo falls reverse-sweeping too! This is the Bosie from Sandakan, spins back in to hit the glove - or maybe the forearm but there are no reviews in T20 - and it loops up to be taken by Chandimal. Sandakan has four-for on debut, SA scrambled!"
"pushed through flat outside off, Behardien chops into the ground"

"flighted on middle and off, Phangiso thrusts bat and pad forward together"
"tossed up nice and high, Behardien comes forward and bunts one down the ground"
"tossed up on the stumps, Phangiso punches to long-on as well"
"flighted, shuffles forward and gets to the pitch to negate turn, taps into a gap"
"pushes the googly across from over the wicket, mistimed swipe from Phangiso"
"tossed up on middle and leg, worked with the spin"
"full and flighted, possibly another wrong'un, Behardien plays it carefully, driving through mid-off for a single to finish the over - which means Sandakan finishes with 4 for 23, wonderful figures on T20 debut for his country"
"length ball outside off, coming back in as he cuts his fingers over the ball, Behardien dabs it off the back foot and steers a much-needed boundary to third man"
"another offcutter, dragged down though and Behardien is able to shovel over square leg, in front of the man in the deep for four more"
"full and dipping on off stump, comes forward to punch through mid-on"
"pushed through, cutting back in front outside off, Phangiso prods at it and the ball misses bat, stumps"

"tossed up on the stumps, worked to midwicket"
"slows his pace down, floated up on off stump, Phangiso tucks one more through midwicket"
"full on middle and leg, Phangiso goes low and paddles fine, gets it away fine and uses what pace Gunaratne had put on the ball to pick up four - raises the SA 100, too"
"wicket-to-wicket, nudged off the pads for one"
"length ball, cutting over the ball, 95kph on middle and off, Behardien works to deep square leg"
"full and wobbling, turns the wrists on off stump but flicks straight to midwicket"
"goes wide of the stumps, no pace for Phangiso as he cuts one into the deep"
"one final dibbly offcutter to finish his allocation, glanced off the pads for one"
"back-of-the-hand slower ball, well directed but Behardien guides it deftly into a gap in the leg side for two"
"goes for the expansive drive, takes the inside edge to the keeper! Full pace from Udana and it nipped back in off the pitch, grazed the edge as Behardien looked to crash through the covers - and there's that fist-pump celebration again"
"over the wicket to the tailender, slower ball that sits up and Tahir completely misses with a pull"
"pitched up, maybe taking the pace off again, mistimed drive to extra cover"
"short ball, flying through wide of the stumps as Tahir stays back and flails at it - called"
"short again, Tahir hacks a top edge down to third man on the bounce"
"another slower ball and this grubs through, just inside the tramlines, Phangiso steps out and swings over the top of it"
"fired in full, not quite the yorker but Tahir can only chop it into the covers and Phangiso sends him back as the throw comes in (and misses)"
"out the back of the hand, Tahir goes back and watches it, watches it, watches it... swings unsuccessfully"
"bowled 'im! Kulasekara puts in on a length, Tahir was showing him all three, big heave across the line and off stump is laid flat on the canvas"
pitched up on off stump and Ngidi shows Tahir how to play that ball with a textbook forward-defensive prod back to the bowler
"angled in, slightly leg side and Ngidi scrapes it away square for his first international run"
"low full toss from Kula, swatted into the leg side for one more - so Phangiso will be on strike for the final over"
"length on the stumps, Phangiso swings across the line and gets a thick inside edge"
"slower ball, outside off and Ngidi drops back and steers it safely behind square for one"
"gottim, Phangiso holes out - and SA have been bowled out! Slogged into the leg side and it's well taken running in by Gunaratne, came high off the bat and never had the legs to get to the rope"
"bounce straight away, round the wicket, is fended off the gloves very unconvincingly"
"short of a length outside off, played with an open face off the back foot and steers it wide of backward point"
"full at off stump, worked into the leg side and can't beat square leg...almost a mix-up"
"that's rapid! A short ball, he goes for the pull and is beaten for pace over the top edge"
"back of a length outside off, 139kph, beats the edge as again as he tries to cut...under the bat this time"
"good delivery, and almost a run out! Full at off stump, pushed towards point and they take off for the run. Kuhn runs in, gathers and flicks under-arm but misses"
"over the wicket, he uses his feet and pushes square to the off side"
"gives himself room to the leg side, drives a back-of-a-length ball to cover"
"gets this over midwicket, a fraction short and he pulls it with a short-arm jabs...gets the elevation to clear the in-field"
"fuller, angling into the pads and strongly flicked away in the air behind square...priceless back-to-back boundaries. Significant dent in a small target"
"gets a bit carried away, loses his shape as he comes down the pitch and swings at a length ball outside off. Parnell took the pace off it"
goes down on his back knee and paddles a full ball from outside off to short fine leg
"finds square leg! Short of a length, he goes for the pull, can't get the elevation or keep it down, was cramped for room, and it's a smart, low catch by Miller just in front of square"
"that's a way to get off the mark, full, angled into the pads and he flicks it high in the air over midwicket...nearly carries for six"
"through him! Two wickets in three balls. The crowd are alive. A very poor shot from Mendis, not needed at all, he gives himself room to the leg side, it's a good length ball, and it spears through to take middle stump"
"good delivery, full outside off, steered off a thickish outside edge wide of slip"
"full, wide outside off, left alone and it's called wide"
"well bowled, angling in at off stump, 139kph, defended off the splice off the bat to the covers"

now he's across the crease and whips a delivery from outside off to deep midwicket
"round the wicket, a slower-ball yorker, it dips late on the batsman who is just able to work to the leg side"
"moves across outside off, gets down on his back knee and sweep/scoops a length ball from outside off fine of short fine leg"
"and again! This is a better stroke, the ball was full, heading towards middle and leg and he scoops it high over fine leg"
"three in a row, a full ball angled outside leg, the batsman also moves to leg and flicks it over midwicket"
"<B>dropped</b>, by Miller in front of square. A uppish flick at a length ball, Miller diving to his left in a position just a bit straighter than where he held his catch. Would expect him to hold those"
"round the wicket, at off stump, gives himself a touch of room and angles down to third man. Exposing the stumps"
"full outside off, 137kph, pushed off the front foot towards mid-off. Good rotation of the strike"
"round the wicket, beaten for pace (and bounce)...a back-of-a-length ball, angling into the left hander, he tries to ramp over the slips"
"and now he swings and misses at a full ball outside off, he splayed his front leg and wasn't really in much of a position for the shot"
"edged, he has three! That's some ordinary batting from Dickwella, but he was rattled by Ngidi's pace. A short-of-a-length ball outside off, he tries to flay it through the off side and gets a top edge to the keeper"
flicked off middle into the leg side
"a googly, significant spin, worked to the leg side and it's a scampered single"
"at off stump, he thrusts his hands forward"
"tossed up a little more, full at off stump, he comes forward and drives towards mid-off"
pushed to backward point
"huge appeal for lbw! Tahir can't believe it's not out. A quicker ball slides through and beats Mathews but think there was an inside edge. Yes, a huge nick"
"round the wicket, full and straight, opens the face and drives through cover"
drives a full delivery to long-off
"this skids on, beats the inside edge as he plays to the leg side, big appeal for lbw but angling down leg side. Might have hit it, too"
flicked off the pads through midwicket
"in the air, and just wide of a diving Phangsio. He went to flick the delivery to the leg side, it goes straighter than he wanted but out of reach of a flying bowler to his right"

plays back and works a straight delivery off his pads behind square
"fuller, again flicked in the air and again wide of the bowler as he flings himself across the pitch"

"a googly, played to the leg side and can't beat midwicket"
"a leg-break to end the over, opens the face and tapped to the covers...tight over"
beats the edge with one that grips outside off
"tries to paddle a full ball fine, think that glanced the bottom edge and stuck the keeper's legs"
back to the bowler
"a shorter delivery, he plays back and whips to midwicket who makes a good save... touch of pressure building"
"uses his bottom hand to work a full, straight delivery into midwicket"
"that's a strong sweep, gets down early and plays from a solid base, good connection and it travels quickly to deep square leg"
"angled down the leg side, he goes for the sweep and it trickles to short fine leg"
taps a full delivery into the off side and that's 1000 T20I runs for Mathews
"full at the stumps, comes forward, drives with an open face but well stopped at cover"
"quicker delivery, driven down to long-off"
"drives at a full delivery, can only get it back to the bowler"
"a touch shorter outside off, but the cut isn't that well timed so it's just a single into the covers"
can't beat midwicket as he flicks a straight delivery
"gives himself room to a shorter ball and square drives through the off side, Tahir manages to dive and prevent the boundary but there was a fair of flailing arms about it (and some face involved)"
pushed to the off side
"shorter, on the pads, tickled fine"
flicks a full ball from off stump through square leg
"brings out the reverse sweep, makes decent connection but picks out backward point"
"back of a length at off stump, defended to the covers"

"down the pitch and swings through the line of a length ball, hits it sweetly and wide of cover...gave himself a touch of room"
"full, on the pads, flicked behind square and there's some superb teamwork in the field to keep that to a single...Kuhn flicking the ball to Tahir"
"full and wide, a slower ball, would have been called wide if Chandimal hadn't flogged it to deep cover"
angled square into the off side...sensible batting and a good over for Sri Lanka
"short outside off, he cuts in front of square to deep cover"
"delivered from a little wider on the crease, a bit short again, played to deep cover"
"that's the best shot of the innings, and maybe the day, as Mathews drives inside-out over wide long-off"
"flatter delivery, angled in at middle and leg, calmly flicked through midwicket"
a bottom-handed flick into the leg side
"hint of turn, takes a leading edge as he closes the face but it runs safely along the ground into the covers"
"round the wicket, that's <i>very</i> short, it turns a a load and beats everyone as Mathews pulls out of the shot"
"short, whipped through the leg side"
"gets this fuller, flicked into midwicket"
shuffles onto the back and works through square leg
finds midwicket this time
gets a bottom edge as he tries to sweep
"follows the batsman as he moves outside the crease and to the leg side, manages to flick it to deep square"
"tries to launch this to Pretoria, but gets far more height than distance yet it falls into space on the leg side. Was there confusion between the fielders? Miller, running in, wanted it"
"edged, that's his fourth! What was Chandimal doing? A length ball outside off and he has a horrid hack at it, just provides a thin edge. Wasteful."
"short of a length outside off, 131kph, he rides the bounce and angles to third man"
"full at off stump, flicked towards mid-on who is deep enough for the single"
"full, angling in at off stump, played off the front foot into the covers...the sensible sort of shot Chandimal should have been playing"
cut to backward point
waits for this to turn outside off and places it to deep point
flicked from outside off to deep midwicket and weighted to allow a second
worked off the pads in front of square
"and he's been given lbw! A googly, beats the inside edge and after a reasonably long wait the finger goes up"
"defends a full, straight delivery to the leg side and that's the end of Tahir's four"
"missed run out! Miller. A full ball was flicked to the leg side, Prasanna raced off for the run but was sent back. Miller wasn't sure whether to flick or dive at the stumps. And missed."
clubbed down the ground to long-on
"round the wicket, a short ball cutter, Prasanna is through his pull too early"
"direct hit! Superb work from Phangiso running in from point. Picks up one handed and finally there's a direct hit today, but he's made it with a stretch!"
"full toss outside off, driven to deep cover"
"length ball, opens the face and taps it behind point...that's all they need to do"
"drags down his first ball, but it's pulled down deep square-leg's throat! Tahir holds on very near the boundary. Good awareness of where his feet were."

"length ball outside off, neatly steered backward of point and place wide enough of third man for a second...required runs into single figures"
"full and straight, flicked to mid-on"
"picks out mid-on! This game isn't over yet. A length ball, outside off, he tried to drag it over the leg side but could only lob it do the man who was up inside the circle. Came right off the toe of the bat"
"it's all happening! Short of a length from round the wicket, he's through his pull and is taken on the body...it rebounds to the off side. They scamper a single, Mathews dives and as he done his hamstring?"
he can barely move...hobbles a single to keep the strikes as this balloons off the thigh guard as he goes to pull a short-of-a-length ball
"<B>dropped</b>! Deep midwicket. And they haven't taken any runs. He go underneath the ball, trying to swing over the leg side. Would have been a fine catch"
"into the stands! Scores are level. Not issues with this one. Stand and deliver, in pain. Swings through the line of a full ball and deposits it into the crowd at long-on"
"moves to the leg side, hammers a short ball to mid-on...there was a single there but Mathews doesn't risk it"
"and he's done it! What a finish. Mathews battles through the pain, takes a skip down the pitch and launches this straight down the ground. Also takes him to a half-century"
