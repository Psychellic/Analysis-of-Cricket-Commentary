muscled across the line to wide long-on

""

backs away and squeezes the yorker on middle to point/
"he's holed out to mid-on, magician Bipul strikes. Rahane is nowhere near the pitch of the ball as he looks to go over the top. Was hitting it against the breeze too, as he ended up dragging it from outside off to Kaul. This one didn't turn either. Poor from an experienced campaigner."
"swept with the angle towards deep fine leg. Didn't get hold of it but there was enough bat to clear the infield and then trickle over. He bowled it faster as well, which made it easier fro Tripathi"
"much better, slower through the air, draws him forward. Tripathi steps out and blocks"

Tough chance. Wonder if Bipul was mindful of the keeper coming in his way"

"mistimes a pull that he fetches from outside off, down to square leg"
"steps out and picks the length delivery through the line over the long-on boundary. Didn't look to hit it too hard, mind you this was no agricultural slog. Just extension of his arms as he hit through to time and get it over the ropes. Presented the full face of the bat"
"he's dealing in fours and sixes at the moment. Shimmies down the pitch and smacks the length ball between cover and mid-off. Head firm, timing immaculate"
"backs away too early, Sid Kaul fires it full and wide. Tripathi can't reach the delivery"
"the change of pace nearly had him. This was a slower length ball outside off, he looked to go over cover but ended up slicing it over point.

"goes for the slog sweep, but the flighted delivery on middle does not give him the room for a free swing. Mistimed to long-on"

"good start. The slower ball on off stump, which is gently tapped towards short third man"
"steps down, but does so a little too quickly. Henriques is able to adjust, pitch a lot shorter than he might have, and cramp Dhoni into playing a block to cover"

"offcutter on middle, Dhoni hangs back and turns it behind square leg. Looks for two, but the boundary riders are alert to his tactics"

"he could have gotten a wicket off his first ball today, comes back for a second spell, starts with a short and wide delivery and Dhoni smashes it to the point boundary"
"back of a length, looking to keep it very wide of Dhoni's reach on off stump. He somehow makes the connection and gets a single to point's left"
"oooh, lucky. He is going for the wide-line yorker, but it becomes an overpitched delivery asking to be belted over cover. Tripathi hasn't heard it's call though. Beaten"
"that's the slower ball, pitching on a good length on off stump. Tripathi is excited at the opportunity to get under a ball, but he misreads the pace. Gets struck on the ribs as he goes down on his knees to slog sweep"
"yorker, outside off, zips past Dhoni's defences. Good variations. Good range and a good head on his shoulders as well."
"smacked to long-off as Siraj finishes the over with a quick, short and wide delivery."
"what a ripper! Tripathi is be run out. This chase just got way harder and Rashid can take a lot of the credit. First he ties Dhoni, who was advancing down to a nurdle off the pads, then he races to the ball, which barely even makes it off the pitch. Gets to it quickly and gets rid of it even quicker. Hits the batsman's end stumps direct. Such quickness"
pushes the ball back to the bowler
"flat and quick on the stumps, pulls to deep square leg"
""
steps down and works a full delivery off the leg stump to deep square leg
"works a flatter delivery off middle and leg to deep square leg. A wicket and only three runs off the over, when Pune needed, on average 11"
"back of a length on off stump, pats and runs to mid-off"
"full on off stump, Dhoni looks to unleash, but he can't get under the ball enough. Inside edge to deep midwicket"
"gets down the track, making room outside leg, but Kaul does well to follow Stokes. Dabs it to mid-off"
"flat hit. He finally gets the ball he wants, in the slot on off stump, and all that power he has comes out to show off. Just a few yards to the right of long-on"
"another full and wide delivery, Dhoni belts it to long-off"
misses his length and gives length for Stokes to get under. It is so wide as well allowing the left-hander to hammer it over the fielder at cover
"back of a length and outside off, steers it to deep point"
"full on middle, Stokes works it to deep midwicket"
"full and wide outside off, Dhoni slices it past point to pick up a couple. He did well to hold his shape after reading the slower ball"
"143 kph, beaten for pace! This is a cross-seamer, pitching just back of a length and outside off, Dhoni is looking to dab it to third man but can't make contact"
"width, and Dhoni tries to capitalise with a slice. Williamson, at point, moves to his right and keeps it to a single"
"almost a yorker on off stump, Stokes whacks it to long-on"
"tries to heave it away, but he doesn't make strong enough connection. Brilliant bowling from Bhuvi, going for the blockhole, going leg stump as well to ensure Stokes' power is nullified. And as well as he hit, it only travels to deep midwicket"
"full and on leg stump, Dhoni flicks it over square leg, but there is a man protecting the deep"
"back of a length on off stump, Tiwary taps it to cover"
"he's getting a littler reverse swing into the base of middle. Dhoni's big bat went high up in the air, looking for the big hit, but Bhuvi's length, and the late movement, leaves the batsman cramped. The ball goes along the ground to deep midwicket, where Hooda gives chase, moving to his right. Has he saved the boundary?  He has the ball in his hand, but one of his legs, as he is standing up from the slide, is very close to the boundary rope. Gut feel is that there is no contact. Third umpire decides as much. Tight chase gets tighter"
"full, swinging in, Dhoni camps deep in his crease and heaves it to long-on"
"midwicket is up inside the circle for Tiwary and he exploits it. A full delivery - almost a yorker outside off - is dragged into the leg side, beats the man inside the 30 yard circle and hurries away."
"low full toss, but with it being wide outside off, and Dhoni reluctant to get in line with deliveries this late in the innings, it is mistimed to cover. Almost a catch, as Bipul does all he can, diving forward, but it drops short"
"lovely batting! The only thing wrong with his delivery is the length. It is length, and Tiwary maximises it by moving across and flicking it over backward square leg, where there is no one on the boundary. Fantastic awareness of the field"
"slow, short and wide outside off, Tiwary is momentarily fooled by the variation. Then adjusts and taps it to point"
"picks the slower ball. It's at a terrible length too. Rank and short with plenty of room. Dhoni hangs back and flat bats it over long-on. The crowd goes 'Dhooni, Dhoooni, Dhooooni'"
"another one! Siraj is going short and slow, and Dhoni is reading him like a book. Stands deep in his crease, leaps  to catch up with the ball and helps it over point and short third man"
"yorker outside off, Dhoni pats it to long-off"
"yorker, skimming over the wide line on off side. Dhoni leaves it, expecting a wide, and he gets it. By the finest margins, that is outside the tram line"
the length is perfect - yorker - but the line allows Dhoni just the little bit he needs to get a four. Both fine leg and square leg were up. So all he has to do is flick it into the gap. Flicked it between his own legs
"one-bounce over the third man boundary. This is wild. Dhoni starts to make room outside leg, the ball ends up a wide yorker again. He stops the initial movement, reaches out with his hands and slashes it away"
"in the slot. <B>Dhoni has fifty</b>. Loads of bottom hand power, he picks up a full delivery on off stump, almost a yorker but just not quite good enough, and it travels over long-on hard and flat"
"back of a length and just outside off, Dhoni goes for a pull, inside edges onto his pad and finds a single to point"
"full on off stump, Tiwary yanks it away to deep midwicket"
"low full toss on off stump, Dhoni drills it to long-on for a couple"
"<b>dropped</b> length ball, it's heaved over to midwicket. This looks like six. But wait, Rashid's there, he is running to his right, he dives, gets both hands to it and shells it."
"back of a length and outside off, pushes it to extra cover"
"round the wicket for a low full toss on leg stump, flicks it to long leg"
"low full toss on middle, he swings it away to deep square leg"
"full on middle and leg, from around the wicket, whips it to long-on for a couple"
"length ball on middle, not the thing his field wanted him to do, and it's smashed through extra cover. Dhoni does another epic finish. Stands still, gets his front leg forward and out of the way, and with a perfectly textbook drive, secures victory"
