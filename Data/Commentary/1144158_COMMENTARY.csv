"<b>dropped by Amla at slip!</b> That could have been dismissal number 16. Should have been! Steyn had been drawing Hafeez forward and now he fired in another cross-seamed delivery, rising on off stump. Hafeez had a little dab at it, sending an edge flying to Amla's left. Amla went at it with that hand - and one-handed - but couldn't hold on!"

"short of a length outside off, opens the face to point"
"has there been a run out here? Direct hit, it's always close. Oh, yeah, he's gone. Length ball, spinning away, opens the face to point and there's a yes and no on the single. De Kock's almost halfway down before he makes his way back and even a dive can't save him"
"fuller, slid into middle and leg, defended back"
"slider, tries to turn it away into the leg side and inside-edges to the pad"

"dabbed into the covers, no run to be had"
"flighted up on middle and leg, Hendricks is forward to smother the spin"
"a touch short, outside off and sliding on. Hendricks cuts into the deep"
"tip-and-run cricket from Faf, tapping to cover and setting off"
"sharp turn from Shadab, and Hendricks isn't quite to it but does enough to keep it out"
"sliding down the leg side, the ball balloons off the inside edge/pad but falls safely"
"too full from Shadab, and Reeza whips firmly off his toes to find the midwicket boundary. And what's more, the ball also skidded across the damp outfield"
"Faf stays deep to play for the drift, pushing to cover and calling early for the single"
"<b>beautifully timed</b> by Hendricks, who is so electric through the off side. This was off the back foot, laced in front of point"
"straighter from Imad, and it's tapped back to him"
"Hendricks comes forward, on the drive, to <b>bring up the 100</b> with a single to cover"
"<b>play and a miss</b> outside off, this one was held back by Imad and just gripped in the surface a little"
"floated up again, but it's too full and du Plessis flicks a single off his toes"
"flighted up outside off, Faf lunges forward to get to it and drives through cover point"
"flight from Shadab, and a bit of turn too. Watchfully played by Reeza"

punched firmly to cover
"Hendricks is forward to drive, but once again pings the cover field"
"this could have been close! Hendricks stepped back to slap to cover, where the fielder gathered and turned to shy at the non-striker's stumps as the batsmen completed a very tight single. The throw goes wide ..."
"short and rising on middle stump, Reeza stepping back to pull, on the bounce, to long leg"
"Faf is up on his toes to punch to point, where the fielder gathers cleanly"
"on a length and straight, and this one looked like it might just have stopped a little off the track as du Plessis defends"
"<b>beaten on the under edge</b>. It was a short one from Hasan, and Faf spotted it nice and early and set himself for the shot, but perhaps tried to hit it a little too hard"
"<b>could have been a run out!</b> Faf tapped the ball to mid on and just set off even as Fakhar Zaman swooped. He stopped it cleanly and shied at the stumps with du Plessis well short, but misses!"
"and now there's an appeal for lbw! This has been a dramatic re-start. Hendricks stays deep and whips across the ball to be struck on the pad. Looked like it was going down though, and there's no review"
"Faf makes room and thunders a drive into the covers, but straight at the fielder"
"tucked into the leg side, a quick single the result"
"Hendricks sends a crunchy drive down to long off, one more"

"Hendricks walks into a defensive push, sending the ball straight to point"
"Reeza spots a leg-stump half volley and clips it firmly in the air to midwicket, the ball skidding across the outfield and beating the sweeper in that position. And <b>that's his fifty too</b>, from 53 deliveries"
"a bit of seam movement off the pitch and back into the right-hander, who prods solidly forward in defence"
"<b>swatted with great authority in front of square</b>, Hasan missing his length and dropping short and Hendricks stepping back to flay a pull well in front of midwicket"
"that's better from Hasan, full and attacking the stumps. Hendricks leans over it to flick to the midwicket fielder"
"speared in on off stump, pushed to cover"
"floated up higher this time, and Faf slams a drive to long off"
"<b>too short, clubbed onto the grass banks!</b> Shadab is really struggling to find his lengths here, and Reeza has punished him"
"he follows the big shot up with a push to cover for one, smart cricket"
"and now Faf taps into the covers, calling immediately for one"
"Shadab rushes one on straight with the arm but Reeza reads it, turning the ball safely to midwicket"
a rising delivery on a middle stump line is worked off the hip
"a bit of shape for Afridi, back into the right hander, but it starts wide and goes wider down the leg side"
"Afridi bends his back on this one, and Reeza plays over the top of the ball to be struck a stinging blow on the thigh"
"angled across the right hander, who meets it with his weight forward and drops the ball towards gully"
"in the channel once again from Afridi, in the channel and angled across Reeza, who defends"
"short again, and Reeza sends the ball bouncing through square leg with a short arm jab"
"firmly driven, but straight to cover and Afridi ends a tidy first comeback over"

"definite shape in through the air as Afridi aims for a yorker, but the ball snakes slightly down the leg side and Faf collects a single with a glance to fine leg"
"on a length, and seaming across Reeza, who pushes it back defensively"
"Afridi lands this one a little too straight, and Reeza flicks easily through square leg"
"dug in halfway down by Afridi, the ball looping down the leg side too"
"<b>misfield by Hafeez!</b> He was on the deep cover boundary, and ran across to stop a ball that Faf had spanked firmly off the back foot, sliding but parrying it to the boundary. I doubt that impressed his captain"
"good looking drive from du Plessis, but he aims it straight at mid off"
"Afridi hits a length at good pace, 141km/h, and Faf stays deep in his crease to defend"
"full and straight, Reeza defends"
Reeza comes half forward to push to cover
"<b>crunched through cover!</b> Faf's feet are moving now, and he's in an excellent position to lace this drive through cover. Powerfully hit, but all along the turf"
"and again! Amir offers up a long half volley and <b>Faf cracks it through cover</b> once again. Fast hands, through the line, and away it went"
"Amir switches to round the wicket, and also pulls his length back to draw a defensive stroke from du Plessis"

"Reeza is in quite some form tonight, coming forward to place his square drive behind point, deliberately played and well timed"
"another slower cutter, and this one bounces and finds the <b>outside edge</b>, the ball falling well short of Sarfraz, as Reeza tries to run it down to third man"

"Amir finds a probing line and length, hurrying Reeza's defence"
"rising off a full length, Reeza leans over it and opens the face of the bat to collect one to third man"
"<b>top edged</b>, but it drops safely! Hasan dug the ball in short with some real vim and Reeza was taken by surprise, late on his pull. Fortunately for him, the ball fells short of the fine leg fielder"
Faf's feet go nowhere as he searches for a tip-and-run single on the off side. None to be had
"glanced off the pads, and that <b>raises the 100 stand between these two</b>"
"short again, but this time it's middle out to the fielder in the deep"
"in the channel on or around offf stump, and Reeza's got no room to work with"

"handsomely driven on the up, but straight to point"

"Faf steps to leg and exposes all three stumps, flashing a drive through point as Imad fires the ball in full and straight"
"tapped to mid on, and the fielder slides to stop it"
