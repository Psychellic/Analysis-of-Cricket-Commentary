"full on off stump from wide of the crease, pushed firmly to mid-off for a quick single"
"full and swinging away from outside off, left alone"
"length ball on off stump, Gambhir chops it towards backward point, tight line from Binny"
"slower delivery on leg stump, Gambhir shuffles across to tuck it towards deep backward square leg, where Abdulla misfields to allow an extra run"
"width, and punished. Overpitched too and Gambhir hammers that between cover and point"
"too full again outside off, this one's just squeezed past extra cover, the mid-off fielder runs to his right to keep it down to a single"
"tight line, delivers it at length on off stump, defended with soft hands"
hops across and whips it to deep square leg
"flicked well, but can't beat ABD at mid-on, they get through for the single though"
"appeal for lbw as the ball deflects off the thigh pad to Rahul down the leg side. No real conviction though from Arvind, the ball pitched on middle and was sliding down"
he gets half forward and pats it to the off side
"it was nothing more than a gentle flick! This outfield is like a billiards table. Jordan at mid-on wasn't more than couple of metres away from the ball when he started sprinting behind it, and still couldn't get it as the ball kept gathering speed. Top shot"
"looks to play a reverse sweep and misses. Is struck on the pad, but was hit outside off. Abdullah went up in an appeal, but umpire Chris Gaffeney is convinced the impact was outside the line of the stumps"
"the bowling change has worked. The flight has done the trick. Abdulla tosses it up generously from around the stumps, the ball drifts into middle as Uthappa looks to work it to the leg side, but ends up getting a leading edge back to the bowler who dives to his left to complete a one-handed catch. He's pumped! Big wicket that"
"swipes it one bounce into the deep midwicket boundary. Did someone say you respect the first ball you face? Gets underneath the flight, head down on the ball, and plays the fierce sweep. Dismissed with disdain!"
"gets forward and taps it to cover, this one was pushed through quicker"
driven to Kohli at cover
"there's some grip and turn, Pandey is slightly squared up as the ball turns from middle, but somehow manages to get some bat on it"
"floats it full on off stump, Gambhir opens the face of the bat and dabs it with soft hands for a quick single"
"gives him the charge, but is cramped for room. Bunts it wide of the bowler in the end and scoots across for the run. Arvind did well to run to his right to stop that, but didn't pick the ball up cleanly"
"can't bowl there in the mid 120s. Half-tracker on middle, Gambhir has all the time in the world to hop back and pull that one past square leg!"
plays the half-pull wide of mid-on for another quick single
"he's come out looking to play his shots. Another short ball angling across, Pandey muscles the pull over midwicket. It was like getting throwdowns in the nets, says Hayden"
"looked to go over mid-on, but ended up dragging it past midwicket. Still managed to get enough bat on it to clear the infield. The crowd comes alive, the pressure is back on RCB."
"flatter one on off stump from around the stumps, whipped wide of midwicket"
gets back and wrists that wide of mid-on
"spins back into middle and leg, worked wide of square leg"
"tossed up on middle, Pandey gets to the pitch of the ball and works it across the line towards wide mid-on, slightly uppish but no damage done"
"drifting down leg, Gambhir uses the pace to paddle it past short fine leg. Easy picking those. Poor ball, and duly punished"
makes a bit of room and punches the short ball to Jordan at point for a quick single
"starts off with a full delivery on off stump, pushed to Kohli at cover"
"too full and just outside off, Gambhir looks to make room and squeeze that behind point but misses"
"why would you want to test the bounce of this pitch at 127 kph, beyond me! Gambhir is waiting to play the pull and hammers it into the deep square leg boundary. Good effort by Chahal there"
"floats it full outside off, Gambhir squeezes that in front of square towards sweeper cover"
"flicked to ABD at midwicket, Gayle backs up at cover to stop the rocket throw"
"top shot! Length ball on middle, Pandey gives himself some room to open up the off side field and simply lends direction to the ball by opening the face of the bat. It raced away between cover and point"
"tossed up on middle, flicked to Kohli who misfields at midwicket to give away a single"
"catch was the call, but I guess Rahul was asking someone in the stands at deep midwicket to take that. The slog sweep played against the spin, but picked superbly from outside off. The ball is pinging the centre of his bat today"
"sharp turn away from outside off, he watches Rahul collect the ball"
gets back and cracks it off the backfoot to sweeper cover
"beautiful timing from Gambhir. He picks the googly off the hand, gets to the pitch of the ball and lofts it with the spin over cover, one bounce into the boundary."
"makes a bit of room and slices the cut behind point to find the gap. There was a fielder in the deep, but he had no chance. It was fiercely struck even though Gambhir didn't mean to hit it hard. The power of timing!"
"starts off with a short ball outside off, slapped to sweeper cover"
"lovely flick of the wrists to place the ball into the gap at deep square leg, Binny does the mopping up"
"drops it with soft hands towards Gayle at point, Pandey was off the blocks immediately to complete the run easily"
"slower one on middle, Pandey clears his front leg and whips it wide of midwicket"
"another slower delivery, gets some lift off this one from middle, dabbed behind square on the off side"
"what happened there? Total breakdown in communication. Pandey slapped that to mid-off and took off for a run even as Gambhir was ball watching, but reluctantly sets off for the run, Pandey who was running to the danger end had to stretch full length to get back in even as Jordan collected the ball and broke the bails. A direct hit would have had him there. Having broken the bails at the bowler's end, Jordan then turns back to fire a throw towards the keeper, but Gambhir had completed the run by then"
"looks to slog sweep, but is beaten by the sharp turn"
"turns away from outside off, just outside Pandey's reach, right call from the umpire"
flat-bats that one to long-off
hops across the stumps and nurdles it with the spin towards fine leg
"chopped to point, but gets through for the run. Looked to cut but didn't have room"
"directs another one well outside off, it grips and turns, well outside Pandey's reach again"
VVS Laxman would have been proud of that. Gets to the pitch of the ball and opens his wrists at the last moment before unfurling the off drive towards deep point
play and a miss as the ball spins away from outside off
eased towards sweeper cover
flat-bats the pull off the frontfoot to Binny at long-on
"lofted cleanly, but can't find the gap as Sachin Baby swoops in from sweeper cover to keep that down to two"
"angles the slower ball on off stump towards Gayle at point, another fifty for the skipper. The dug out applauds, the crowd roars. This has been a superb knock, nothing brutal about it but very crafty. <b> 31st fifty for him </b>, the joint-highest along with Warner"
"looks to pull but is cramped for room, bunted back to the bowler"
"makes some room to go over cover, but Jordan sees that early and drifts it into middle and leg, Pandey is beaten on the flick as the ball deflects off his pad to Rahul behind the stumps"
"spins back into middle, Gambhir shapes to cut but ends up dabbing it instead towards point"
"fires this one but gets the direction wrong, it was well outside off"
pushed into the vacant cover region for an easy single
"too much width and is lucky to get away with that, but the mix-up results in a bonus wicket for RCB. Pandey was more than halfway down the crease, when Gambhir looked towards his partner, in the end both of them were stranded at the same end as Abdulla collects Watson's throw to break the stumps at the non-striker's end. Pandey doesn't even bother looking at his captain who walks off shaking his head. They were lucky to get away couple of overs ago, not this time."
driven with the spin to deep cover
gets forward and covers the line of that in-drifter before defending
gets half-forward and blocks again
walks across the stumps and nonchalantly flicks it to deep midwicket
"length ball on off stump, it stops on Yusuf as he jabs at it, uppishly played towards point as he gets off strike"
"he's clobbered that, as flat as it can get. This one was banged in short again, but Pandey was waiting for it  as he flat-bats it over deep midwicket."
"yorker length delivery on middle and leg, squeezed to long-on"
beaten by late away movement as he feebly pushes at a that length ball that cuts away from outside off
"he's furious it wasn't called wide. Watson sees Yusuf moving inside the crease and floats it on middle and leg, Yusuf misses the tickle"
"backs away to cut, then has to reach out to play that one towards short third man, clever from Abdulla to drag that short once he saw the batsman making room"
"steps out and offers his pad to that delivery as it deflects to cover, they complete the leg-bye. Shouldn't have been a run, <b> Yusuf clearly didn't offer a shot there </b>"
"attempts a slog sweep but misses, ball deflects off the flap of the pad to square leg"
"throws it full and wide outside off, Yusuf smears that to wide long-off, looked like he got it off the bottom of the bat"
"fetches the sweep from outside off, played to deep square"
"waits inside the crease and then turns it across the line towards midwicket, Abdulla sprints across and then slides to stop the ball and fire a throw to Rahul. Yusuf was comfortably in"
"makes a bit of room and glides that on the up behind point. Looked like he casually eased it, but the punch in that stroke gave it the legs. Super stuff"
"yorker-length on off stump, squeezed towards deep midwicket, quality knock"
"attempted yorker, turns into a half-volley that is flicked towards deep midwicket"
the Pandey party is over as Arvind takes out his Karnataka teammate. Pandey makes room to go over the off side but Arvind does well to follow him and cramp him for room by bowling full on middle and leg. Pandey now looks to whip it over wide long-on but ends up hitting it a lot straighter than he wanted as AB de Villiers takes a simple catch
"sprays it full and down leg, Yusuf looks to tickle it fine but can only get some pad on it as it races away past KL Rahul into the fine leg boundary"
"another yorker-length delivery on middle and leg, worked to deep square"
"turn, bounce and an appeal for stumping. Is it out? Yusuf has started walking. Coming back to the delivery, this one was generously tossed up outside off, Yusuf looks to slog that across the line over long-on and was through with the swing before the ball got to him, Rahul collects the ball and breaks the bails off even as Yusuf tries to stretch back. His backfoot was on the line when the LEDs started glowing. There was a bit of doubt in the third umpire's mind. He wanted to check if Rahul collected the ball in front of the stumps, but he was fine there"
"pushed through quicker, lands this on off, defended back down the pitch"
"angles it superbly past short third man. Short and spinning away from outside off, it had considerable pace on it as well, and Surya is a master of those delicate strokes. Head on top of the ball when he made contact"
"<b> has Rahul fluffed a chance? </b> Surya looks to play the late cut again, there was a big deflection. Tough"
driven with the spin to long off
stays inside the crease and cuts the short ball to point to get off the mark
"floats it full on middle and leg, pushed past the bowler to long-on"
"lofted cleanly inside-out but he only ended up hitting it a little too well as Abdulla runs 20 yards or so to his left to take an excellent catch at long-off. Wonder if Surya looked to play a chip shot there. Doesn't matter, they're losing wickets in clumps and the squeeze is well and truly on"
"there was a man at deep midwicket, but he was a spectator. Too short, Russell was waiting on the backfoot to swing across the line and cleared the boundary easily. Looks like it doesn't matter to him if they've lost wickets or no. If it's in his zone, he's going to go for it"
drills the full delivery to long-off
"delightful square drive. Too full outside off, he leans forward, angles his bat to pick the gap between short third man and point. Lovely touch"
fetches the flick from outside off towards deep midwicket
gets to the pitch of the ball and drives it to long-off
"drive and a miss. This one fizzes off the deck, almost 45 degrees, Rahul collects it well"
"the fielders at deep cover and wide long-off were no more than 10 metres apart, but Russell still managed to drill that and generate enough power to find the gap. Amazing!"
slapped off the backfoot to cover
"flat hit towards Kohli who runs in from deep cover and takes it on the bounce. He could have so easily played it safe and kept it to a single, but he came running in looking for the catch. Looks like there's a cut on his finger."
cuts if wide of a gingerly looking Gayle at short third man
"yorker on middle and leg, Russell squeezes it to deep square leg"
he's clobbered that into Dhaka! Gets down on one knee and swings across the line to that off-cutter and gets enough elevation and distance to take it miles over the ropes.
"looks to repeat the stroke, this time ends up skewing it towards ABD at long-off, luckily for him, it fell short as he toe-ended the slog"
"shades of Carlos Brathwaite from the World T20 in that flick. Too full and on leg stump, DreRuss gets inside the line of the ball and flicks it over the deep backward square leg boundary"
"full toss on off stump, swung across the line to de Villiers at long-on, good stop to a flat hit . What an athlete"
"Arvind has made a right royal mess of that at third man. This one was floated fuller, he backed away to go over cover, but ended up slicing it towards third man, where Arvind got down low when he could have comfortably taken it. Lost a split second because of the indecision and that was enough for the ball to bobble out."
"that is a toe-crusher Malinga style, on leg stump, Shakib is off balance as he jams his bat down to prevent that from hitting the base of leg stump"
"another yorker, this one's swung across the line towards deep square"
"floats it full and wide outside off as he sees the batsman making room, flirts with the wide line"
"he's crunched that, but straight to sweeper cover"
"sees Shakib backing away early and floats it full and wide, he has to reach out to squeeze that to point, clever adjustment of line there from Jordan"
"fantastic, fantastic delivery. He was unflustered by Russell's early movement of trying to paddle it fine. The yorker was bowled with pin-point precision on middle, Russell lost his balance, but somehow managed to keep that out"
"the extra ball has resulted in a six. Misses his length by a whisker. This one turns into a half-volley, and Russell connects the swing to see the ball sail over long-off"
"full toss outside off, swung across the line to deep midwicket"
"excellent yorker on leg stump from around the stumps, Russell squeezes it to the leg side and scampers through for a single"
"full and tailing away from off stump, Shakib squeezes the yorker-length delivery to point"
"sees the batsman looking to walk across and floats a high full toss outside off, Russell stays put and then slaps that flat hit to deep cover, nearly had a six. It landed a couple of inches before the advertising triangle"
"he's swung across the line and has hurt himself in the process as the thick inside edge hammers into his thigh. He hobbles across for a single. Watson has a wry smile, is lucky to get away with that"
"looks to walk across to slog, and misses. Umpire signals wide, Watson and Kohli are unhappy. <b> Poor call. That was well inside the wide line. </b>"
"low full toss on middle, smeared across the line to Jordan, who nearly overbalanced at deep square as he took the ball on the bounce."
"shapes back in from the length area outside off, Gayle shoulders arms"
"banana swing back into middle, it was a superb yorker which Gayle somehow manages to get under"
dabs it with an open face of the bat to point to get off the mark
"short, and punished. This man is something else. Sighters, anybody? Swivels back and slaps that into the deep backward square leg boundary"
played with soft hands to the off side
"beaten for pace as he shapes to pull, the ball brushes his elbow and deflects behind the stumps as they complete a leg-bye"
"starts off with a full delivery on off stump, pushed to point"
"he had a mighty swipe at that length ball slanting away, but could only connect with the humid air"
"back of length delivery on middle, Gayle doesn't get the width he's looking for, defended to point"
"not off the middle, but Gayle will be relieved to be up and running. This one was a touch fuller, he simply swung through the line, ended up dragging it a little as the ball bounces into the long-on boundary"
"pulled, and pulled well. Not all that short but it was almost as if Gayle has already decided he will play the shot. Went through and made sweet connection as the ball flew in front of square."
"swing and a miss. Looks like he rolled the fingers over the ball, too early into the pull"
"makes room to go over cover, but can only get a thick inside edge onto his pad"
"can't err in line or length. He will eat those for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Half volley on middle, Kohli uses his magical wrists to find the gap wide of midwicket"
"turned to midwicket again, this time with soft hands"
"thumped, but straight to double G at extra cover"
"he's clobbered that over the bowler's head, and into the sightscreen. Stand and deliver. The ball had landed outside the ropes even before Russell could turn on his followthrough. Is he back?"
"long boundary, but it doesn't matter. Russell drops it short, Gayle was waiting deep inside the crease and then muscled that pull that sailed over the ropes at deep square leg. Russell is on the floor, perhaps slipped on his followthrough"
"bat face turned as he made contact, played back down the pitch"
"nearly dragged the short ball back onto the stumps, it was the slower one, Kohli was early into the pull, missed leg stump"
stays inside the crease and then opens the bat face to guide that behind point
"arches back, gets inside the line of the ball and plays the upper cut behind point, one bounce into the boundary."
"thumped to Narine at wide mid-off, struck really hard, he was thrown off balance by the impact"
"delightful, sublime, out of the world! This one is a length ball outside off, which Kohli converts into a half-volley by sashaying down the pitch and lofting it inside-out over cover. Wow"
"tossed up on leg stump, Gayle gets forward and smothers the spin"
defended back to the bowler with soft hands
"bullet hit into the deep backward square leg boundary. This had a lot of air on it, Gayle down on one knee as he sweeps that over the infield"
"gets to the pitch, opens the face of the bat to ease that wide of cover. For a while, it looked like he was looking to go over cover, but made the adjustment at the last second. Top shot"
squeezed back to the bowler
worked wide of midwicket for a quick single
"closes the bat face early, gets a leading edge that rolls wide of cover"
"reaches out and then slaps that one towards cover, where Suryakumar Yadav took the pace of the ball to prevent the boundary. It was struck really, really hard"
"wrong-un on middle and leg, whipped to square leg. Kohli is furious that he didn't find the gap there"
driven with the spin to long-off
"this one slides past the outside edge, Gayle was playing for the turn but it was pushed through quicker"
"bit of air, and Gayle gives it a good old almight thwack, gets more elevation than distance this time and it just manages to clear the long-on boundary"
driven to long-off
hit high on the pad as he looks to work it past midwicket. Rajpoot appeals but the ball was going over
"clears his front leg and shapes to pull but the length ball on middle skids onto him faster than he expected, awkwardly hit back down the pitch as he swung at that one"
"slower delivery on leg stump, Gayle is once again early into the his flick, squeezed back to the bowler"
"mistimes another pull, this one to deep midwicket"
"looks to dab it behind the keeper, nearly ends up chopping it back onto the stump. Top over"
"skips down, only to see Narine drop it shot. Then he makes room and then flat-bats it over cover, wow. What timing, what power"
"grip and turn from middle, Gayle lets it go"
he's foxed him with the one that spins back in this time. Gayle played for the turn away but it skidded back into him as he looked to play across the line. The umpire took a while before raising the finger. Gayle falls one short of a half-century
gets back into the crease and taps it back to the bowler
gets across and whips it to deep midwicket to get off the mark
"plays a half-pull which was in the air for a while, Narine gets his hand across to stop the powerful hit"
"angles a length ball on middle from wide of the crease, ABD gets a thick inside edge that squeezes past square leg"
makes room to go over the off side but ends up bunting it towards the man running in from deep midwicket
"that is a scorcher. Just a hint of width, but it was enough for him to convert an inch into an acre as he frees his arms to slap that behind point"
hit hard into the ground as Gambhir leaps to stop that at point
"don't even try to catch that or even put your hand out. Right in the slot, a half-volley on middle, which de Villiers drills over the bowler's head, bisects long-off and long-on"
"chopped to cover, he looked to go behind point again"
"flighted delivery on middle, this was spinning away but Kohli ensured he got to the pitch of the ball before flicking into the gap between deep midwicket and long-on"
gets forward and drives it with the spin to cover
"ooohs and aaahs. This one breaks back in sharply to take Kohli's gloves, nearly rolled back onto the stumps"
"wrists it with soft hands towards the fielder running in from deep midwicket, it was hit no more than 30 yards from the pitch. Just eye-contact before they decided the second was on, incredible"
"errs in length by not much, but Kohli still has enough ammunition to pick the gap behind point. Hint of width as well as he frees his arms to power that into the point boundary"
dabbed to short third man for a quick single
"this one drifts back in from around the stumps and skids back into middle, Kohli blocks it with soft hands"
driven with the spin to sweeper cover
"short on middle, ABD makes room and slaps it to sweeper cover"
"has Gambhir just dropped the cup? Or even the match? This was short and cut hard, it got to Gambhir a lot later than he thought at point, bobbled out"
played across the line towards deep midwicket
"rocks back and pulls it across the line towards deep midwicket, Kohli looked to clear the fence there and is clearly angry at missing out on five extra runs there"
"slow turn from off stump, Kohli drives but gets the inner half of the bat to it, rolls back to the bowler"
"worked with the angle towards deep midwicket, once again Yusuf had to run in 20 yards, enough time for Kohli to complete the second"
"makes a bit of room and cuts it to deep cover, Chawla is getting away with the short stuff at the moment"
"grip and turn on that from outside off, de Villiers checked his drive at the last moment"
"steps out and lofts it over the infield to long-on, wanted to go a lot straighter though"
worked wide of the midwicket fielder
"gets back into the crease and pulls the not-so-short delivery drifting into middle and leg, towards wide long-on"
"shouts of caaaaaaatch, but outside the ropes. For a moment, sweeper cover would have been interested, but he could only watch that sail over. It was hit towards the long boundary too. De Villiers just made room and lofted the tossed up delivery inside-out. Amazing"
gets to the pitch and drives with the spin into the gap at sweeper cover
"hit hard, but straight to cover"
"fires it full and on the seventh stump outside off, easy call for the umpire"
"tossed up outside off, ABD looks to play a fierce reverse sweep but misses. Is slightly off balance as Uthappa effects a stumping. Third umpire called in, but the backfoot was well back into the crease when the LEDs started glowing"
worked across the line to long-on
"on another night, he would have bottom-edged it onto the stumps. Nicely tossed up outside off, he looks to slog across the line, the inside edge rolls past leg stump towards fine leg"
driven past the bowler to long-on. That was bowled at <b>122kph </b>.
"drilled down the ground towards Pandey, who runs to his left and then tumbles across the turf to keep it down to two"
"he can hit sixes on demand! This was a wrong-un, but Kohli did well to get to the pitch of the ball and then smoke it over long-on. Got more elevation, but the straight boundaries aren't that long here"
"a cry of anguish as he pulls, straight to deep midwicket. He lets out a few cuss words which I can't mention on comms"
driven with the spin to Shakib at sweeper cover
"pulled well, but straight to Suryakumar Yadav who slides and stops that at long-on"
"beaten in flight as he looks to flat-bat that over cover, he's furious with himself"
squeezed to Gambhir at point for a quick single
makes a bit of room and crunches it to deep cover
"he has crunched that off the frontfoot, but straight to Yusuf at sweeper cover. Oh well, another fifty. But it's not a landmark anymore for Mr Consistent. Losing count now"
"that is a demoralising blow. Not all that bad a delivery. Shakib thought he can get away by darting it full and on off to cramp De Villiers for room, but no. He slightly moves across and then gets low to take the sweep on the half-volley and hit it into the stands at deep square leg. Whadddaplaaya"
"cramped for room as he cuts, can only hit it straight to point"
worked across the line to deep midwicket
whipped over the infield to Surya at deep midwicket
"looks like he's tiring here. Looks to slog sweep, but misses as the ball deflects off the pad towards Uthappa. Kohli was outside the crease for  split second but managed to get back into the crease in time. Match awareness"
"slapped to sweeper cover, Kohli slaps his pad with the bat in disgust"
"why worry when there's AB, Virat should be telling himself instead of being cross at himself. Shots like these should calm him down. AB gets across and under the flight before slog sweeping that into the deep backward square leg boundary. Picked the bones out of that one"
"tossed up outside off, Kohli reverse sweeps that fiercely past short third man. Get it back, please"
driven with the spin to long-off
"sees AB walk across and floats it wide outside off, thumped to sweeper cover"
"rocket hit to the man at the edge of the circle at cover, Kohli's nerves, I'm afraid, will pop out any time soon"
"fires it full and wide, AB looks to cut but gets a thick outside edge that beats short third man"
"walks across the stumps and slog sweeps it towards deep midwicket. Run-a-ball? Doesn't matter, they wull still take two"
he's whiplashed that length ball from around the stumps into the boundary at wide long-on. Walks across to make room and then uses his wrists to go onside when he could have so easily gone over cover.
"full toss on middle, mistimes the swing towards midwicket, the man in the deep had to run in a long way to stop that"
"takes it on the full, driven to long-off"
"oversteps, and not, it wasn't the height in question. AB swipes the full toss to long-off. <b> Free-hit time </b>"
"another full toss, but Kohli didn't have the room to swing through the line this time, gets it down to long-on"
lofted over the infield to Surya at deep midwicket. RCB dugout must be tired of applauding these strokes now. Exhilarating
"the French cut this time. Goes for a yorker, nothing wrong with the intention, but it was angling down leg. AB swings, gets a bottom edge that sneaks through his legs and into the fine leg boundary"
"bowling change or no bowling change, it doesn't matter! DreRuss floats it full outside off from wide of the crease, Kohli rotates his wrists to pick it over the midwicket boundary. He had to fetch it from well outside off, effortlessly done"
"yorker on middle and leg, squeezed to cover. Oh dear, they sneak another one on the overthrow. Poor awareness, the bowler was caught napping"
"drilled down the ground to long-on, Russell seems to have done some damage to his knee. Or is it the ankle? He slipped on his followthrough again. He's walking off the field. Doesn't look good."
"paddled past short fine, and those are the winning runs. Make no mistake, this has been a shellacking for the Knight Riders"
