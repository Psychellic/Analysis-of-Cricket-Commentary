"<b>glorious!</b> Full, just outside off, and he simply lifts this over long off! So what if it's nearly 148kph? Kohli picked that length up perfectly"
"<b>sliced, but over third man!</b> The men in the RCB dugout can't hold on to it either. Smarter ball, length outside off and angling in, but Kohli throws his hands at this. Looks to go inside-out over cover again, but outside-edge takes the ball over the fielder inside the circle"
"slower, and a well-directed yorker on middle. Swings into Kohli's pads, and worked away to midwicket"
"length ball, wide outside off, and he tries to punch through the covers. Ball takes the outside edge because of some extra bounce, and flies away to the third-man fence"
"full, on off but swinging inwards. He mistimes a leg-side slog to deep midwicket"
"full on off, and the inswinger is picked up and deposited to the wide long-on fence. Clears his front leg to swing across the line, and gets enough muscle to beat the fielder in the deep"
"full, on off, and Kohli clears his front leg before <b>whipping</b> a six over long on! Big stride forward, and clean striking thereafter"
"<b>bang, bang!</b> Full, just outside off, and the googly is drilled past the fielder at mid-on! Runs away to the straight boundary"
"full on middle, and Kohli goes straight over Gopal's head this time. Smacked over the bowler, but Livingstone at long-on dives across the ground to intercept the ball. His knee takes a blow due to the wet ground, but looks alright. Terrific effort, saving two runs"
"<B>holes out!</b> Silence at the Chinnaswamy. Full on off, and the Kohli goes for the big shot again. Tries to lift it over long on again, and the ball <i>was</i> wide enough for him use his arms, but it comes off the toe-end of his bat and Livingstone makes no mistake"
"<B>First Kohli, and now AB!</b> This was the legbreak, full outside off, and he tries to slap this over cover. slices the shot, though, and it's too easy for the fielder running in from cover. Gopal does the double over Kohli <i>and</i> de Villiers in IPL 2019"
"<B>that's a hat-trick for Shreyas Gopal!</b> Full, just outside off, and the legbreak is driven straight. But it's hit in the air, and mid-off gets behind it. Smith holds on to Stoinis, and Gopal is doing a Tahir!"
"full on middle, and clipped off his toes to deep backward square for a single"
"full on middle, and the googly is mistimed down the ground to long on"
"fast ball, half-tracker on middle, and guided off his hips to deep midwicket. Gently played, so Mann manages to run back for the second"
"length ball on leg, and he tries to sweep behind square. <B>Top-edge</b> takes it over the keeper's head, and the ball bounces across the boundary-line"
"another medium-pace delivery, and he tries to clear wide long on. Slogged to the leg side, but not timed well, and the fielder at cow corner comfortably pouches this. <B>Parag dances</b> after taking the wicket. Ah, the innocence of youth!"
"full on off, and drilled down the ground to long on"
"full, on off, and tapped off the back foot to mid-on for a quick run"
"length ball, just outside off, and Parthiv tries to check-pull along the ground. But the delivery takes some extra bounce, and Parthiv has managed to top-edge this over short fine leg"
"<b>Klaasen takes cover!</b> Full on middle, and he drills this straight. The non-striker does well to duck, and long-on does even better to stop the ball"
"length ball, wide outside off, and he carves this off the back foot to deep point. <B>Terrific commitment</b> from Rahane at the deep, sliding across the ground to stop the boundary"
"<b>slower ball!</b> Parthiv swings but misses. Length ball, just outside off, and Parthiv shapes up to slog leg-side. He's through the shot too early though"
"<B>cheeky, but doesn't pay off!</b> Length ball outside off, and Parthiv shuffles across his stumps to try and ramp it past short fine leg. Slices the shot, and Oshane is in the ball's path"
"<b>front-foot no ball!</b> Full and fast outside off stump, but Klaasen misses the slog"
"full on middle, and he clears his front leg to smash a shot past the non-striker. Long on intercepts"
"length ball, outside off, and angling further away. Negi tries to cut, but misses, and they scamper across for bye-runs. Negi is surprised that the umpire didn't call it a wide. Brave from Negi to run though"
"<b>leading edge to deep cover!</b> Full, on middle, and Klaasen looks to deposit this over midwicket. But the ball held it's line, and therefore took the bat's splice. In the air for a long time before Livingstone dives forward to complete the catch"
"<b>top-edged over the keeper!</b> Short on middle, and he goes for a wild pull. Catches the bat's edge and RCB collect four more runs"
"<b>sharp catch by the keeper!</b> A 145.1kph fireball on off, and Negi swivels to slog over midwicket. The ball, however, takes some extra bounce and collects a feather-edge off the bat"
"back of a length, wide outside off, and Saini can't connect with the cut. They scamper across for byes as Samson misses the direct hit"
"length ball outside off, swinging away as Samson looks to hit it on the up but misses. An appeal by the bowler for caught-behind but nothing on the UltraEdge"
"length ball on the body, Samson plays a short-arm pull, off the front foot and smashes it over deep midwicket, utter disdain"
"length but straying on the pads, swiped away by Samson this time, over backward square leg for four"
"Umesh corrects his line this time, almost a replica of the first ball of the over, short of length outside off and swinging away, Samson looks to hit it through the off side, misses"
"length ball at 146.5 kph, on the stumps and hurries on to Samson who looks to pull it away, mistimed towards mid-on"
"fuller and wider outside off, steered but straight towards backward point"
"length ball around off, Livingstone clears his front leg and clubs it over midwicket, gets four"
"toe-end of the bat but it sails over long-off, all the way for a six. Was short of length outside off, Livingstone went for a tennis-like forehand, got enough on it"
"a high full toss and Klaasen almost pulls of a stunner, at cover. Flung himself to his right, got his hand to it when the ball had already passed him but he fails to latch on to"
"length ball around off, goes for the pull but mistimes it towards deep square leg, only a single. More like a drag than a pull"
"a slower one, length outside off, Livingstone was early into the shot, looked to heave it on the leg side, the ball hits the toe end and on the bounce to the keeper"
"fuller and wider outside off, Livingstone looks to reach for it but cannot put bat on to the ball, a precious dot ball"

"length outside off, backs away and looks to flat-bat it this time, mistimes it towards long-off"
"moves across towards the off side and looks to scoop it away but Khejroliya follows the batsman and bowls it full and wide, Livingstone ends up scooping it on to his pads. They run a single nonetheless"
"length outside off and angling across the batsman, Samson looks to hit it through the off side and misses, too wide but the umpire doesn't think so"
"length ball around middle and off, Samson stands in his crease and just lofts it over long-on, holds his shape and it goes all the way for a six"
"fuller and wider outside off this time, Samson throws his hands at it, gets a thick outside edge between the keeper and the short third man"
"fuller outside off and spinning away, Livingstone throws everything at it but it spins away from him, Parthiv cannot collect it neatly and the batsmen take a bye. This should have been a wide though"
"length around off, Samson looks to go over extra cover but ends up skying it over point, a bit of confusion as the two fielders are unsure who is going for it but Negi in the ends pouches it"
