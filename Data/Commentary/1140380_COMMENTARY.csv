"full outside off, pressed on the front foot to cover"
"shorter outside off, onto the back foot and cracked to cover"
"<b>gone for a duck!</b> Roy has popped this into the leg side and it's a simple catch to midwicket. The delivery was angling into the pads, Roy shaped to work it through the on side but the delivery stopped and it was far too early on it. Ideal start for Sri Lanka"

"good pace outside off stump, Bairstow shoulders arms"
"a good attacking length, just outside off stump, Bairstow chooses to let this one go by too"
steered into the covers with an exploratory drive

"patted out to cover, no way through there"
"pushed down the ground, and Root is off the mark"
clipped off the toes to short midwicket
sliding past the pads once more. England are a little over-reliant on extras at the moment ...

tucked to the leg side
"sweetly timed, a clip off the toes through the leg side for the first boundary of the day"
can't get the timing right this time
"<strong>ooh, dicey</strong> ... pushing hard off the back foot, but this one jags in sharply and is under-edged into the crease"
"a lively appeal, but probably too high, and sliding down the leg side too. Attacking line once again though"
stabbed to point
"crunched through the covers, and that's a sweet piece of timing. Akila Dananjaya on the rope dives supremely to intercept the boundary"
"a hard-handed poke, out through the leg side, looking for two as he bissects the field well"
"strikes the pad and slides to the leg side, a scampered single ensues"
"back of a length, on off stump, squeezed through to the keeper with an angled bat"
"tapped on the up, into the leg side, and through they go. Good alert running"
"leaning back to bash a cut through third man, that's a remarkable piece of contortion to create a cuttable line from an off-stump delivery"
"whittled off the toes, races through backward square, and there's a good old-fashioned piece of Size-12-boot fielding that doesn't pay off. Reminiscent of Curtly Ambrose, that one..."

"solidly onto the front foot, suitably alert to the threat now"
nurdled to leg once more

"attempted drive, inside-edged"
a hint of shape back into Baistow's forward-defensive. Another sharp single to cover
still not entirely comfortable with Pradeep's shape back into the pads. Defended awkwardly

shuffles onto the back foot to push into the covers
"nudged off the hips, reading the wrong-'un effectively"
"right under the eye-line, nudged to the leg side"
"<strong>a dirty long-hop, and Bairstow latches on immediately!</strong> A cross-batted slam through midwicket, and that's given Bairstow a kick-start!"

"slightly back of a length, and urgently slapped past point"
"attempted work to the leg side, but can't get the angle on the stroke"

a big wind-up but no connection this time
"outside off, full length, Root slides deep into his crease to steer a drive to cover"
"this one sticks in the surface as Bairstow drives hard back down the ground, didn't look entirely comfortable in the stroke, but got it away well enough"

"bashed up and over the leg side, out comes the slog sweep as Sandakan loops one into the blockhole"

"cracked into the covers, a firm drive"
defended again
"<B>bowled him!</b> And to be frank, it's a bit of a mercy killing for Bairstow, who's not been feeling it today. Feet stuck in the crease, stumps splattered, reward for Perera's persistence"
"twirled onto a good length, a sharp single to the leg side"
forward and defended
"<B>huge appeal as Morgan misreads the wrong-un!</B> No stroke offered as the ball spat out of the off-side rough, but would have missed off stump"

"gets over the top of this one, on the back foot, plays to mid-off"

tucked away
"another reverse sweep from Morgan, runs backward of point"
"is this a chance? Root goes for the slog-sweep, gets a bottom edge into his boot which balloons back towards to the keeper who can't get into position to gather it. Hard to say whether it hit the ground as well"

flat-batted drive along the ground to long-off
"a shorter, flatter, delivery which is defended on the back foot"

"fuller, at the stumps, takes a leading edge to the off side and the bowler dives across to save runs"

"hoisted leg-side once more, another single"

"a roundhouse pull, down to fine leg"
defended to gully with soft hands
"slower ball, <strong>Morgan chips a simple catch back to Malinga!</strong> Suckered by his own aggression, looking to be positive, but the ball just wasn't there for his stroke. A fine innings, albeit a disappointing end. He's set his side up for a very solid total"
"<B>slower-ball yorker, and Malinga is on a hat-trick!</b> This is what experience offers you. Moeen was utterly bamboozled as the ball dipped late, underneath the toe of the bat, before biting off the pitch to wreck the stumps! The Slinger brings up his 500th international wicket in style!"

"very wide on the crease, fired down the leg side, thought I heard a flick of pad there but it's given as wide"

"leg-sided, an attempted deflection but the keeper does well to gather"
"<B>slower-ball yorker!</b> Rapped on the pads as Woakes misses a sweep and that is very adjacent! Given not out, but Sri Lanka are reviewing ...it is leg-sided, but is it hitting leg...? <strong>It certainly is!</strong> Malinga is rolling out all the old hits!"

"well played from Rashid, an open-faced steer on a very full length, and clean through backward point"
dabbed to third man once again
"<strong>another yorker, and it's five for Malinga!</strong> He points to the name on his shirt, and little wonder! This has been a masterclass. Absolute perfection, as he dipped into Dawson's off stump, dropping so late in trajectory that there was no hope of laying bat on ball. You can't compete with those angles ..."

tucked into the gap to get off the mark with his first ball in international cricket
"slower ball outside off, through to the keeper"

"back of a length at off stump, defended to the bowler"
"<B>short, sharp and gone!</b> Stone making an immediate impression. Terrific bouncer, excellent line on middle and leg, Dickwella has his gloves in front of his face and the balloons off them, giving Buttler a simple catch. Seven balls into Stone's career and it's officially 'exciting'"
