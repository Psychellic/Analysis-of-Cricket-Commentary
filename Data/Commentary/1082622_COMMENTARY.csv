"oh beauty. Good length, angles in at off stump, swings away late and goes past the outside edge as he prods without any feet"
"good length, in the corridor, not as much movement as the last ball but enough to beat the outside edge. This climbs too, Uthappa takes it above his head"
"short ball outside off stump, looks to ramp it over the slip cordon, beaten"
"back of a length at off stump, defended to point off the back foot"
"back of a length, cramped around the hips but he contorts enough, takes the bottom hand off for control and pushes this past short fine leg's left to find the boundary"
"back of a length at middle stump, defended off the back foot"
"shot. This is at a length, angling into him. He leans in and taps it aerially through wide mid-on, on the up"

"back of a length, nips back in and strikes him on the inside thigh before rolling into the off side"

"length at the pads, watches it come on closely and flicks it well to fine leg's left"
"superb shot. This isn't driving length outside off, but he has half a stride in and his head is steady as he unleashes a square drive on the up and bisects point and cover"
"back of a length at middle stump, shovels it off his hips to fine leg"
"and he dabs this past where second slip was. Rolled his fingers on this back of a length ball in the corridor, he was into it early but adjusted for the pace and opened the face to pick the gap"
"good length, in the corridor, leans into it and whips on the up to mid-on"
"short ball outside off stump, misses out on the upper cut, carries nicely to Uthappa"
"that's Samson Zone. Good length in the corridor, slides on nicely to the bat. Gambhir has extra protection square on the off side - there are three fielders relatively square - but he squeezes it through them with a square drive"
"back of a length at just outside off, this time he slaps it to backward point's left off the back foot"
"back of a length at the pads, glances it to deep square leg off the back foot"
"back of a length outside off stump, sits in the pitch as he looks to punch off the back foot, under edge into the pitch"

"misses the sweep, hit on the back leg, and it's given. This was a knuckle ball full at off stump and struck him in front of off stump. On first look, it appears this might have hit him slightly outside off...yes it was close, but it would've been umpire's call. Fair decision in the end"

"off cutter, length at off stump, runs it down to third man"
"back of a length outside off stump, once again third man sees an open face and follows the ball off of it"
"appeal for caught behind, turned down. Bouncer at middle stump. Samson goes the old fashioned non-helmet way and gets inside the line to negotiate it. Loses room in the bargain and is hurried on the hook shot. Ball flies past his left shoulder. There was a sound, but it wasn't bat"
"good length, offcutter outside off stump. Puts a stride across and whips it KP style on the up, wide of long-on"

"back of a length at leg stump, looks to tuck it into the leg side, but pushed back to the bowler off the back foot"

"full at middle stump, flicked to deep midwicket"
"<b>nearly runs past a wrong'un.</b> This is similar to how he outfoxed Dhoni. Good length outside off, knows the batsman is coming at it and gets it to loop. He has to scramble to get bat on this"

"wrong'un, short and wide, finds backward point with the cut"
"wrong'un, short and wide, cuts it past backward point, finds the sweeper"

"good length at middle stump, drops it wide of the bowler into the leg side with soft hands. He runs across, dives and acrobatically has a shy at the non-strikers but its all good for the batsmen in the end"
"<b>dismal from Yusuf.</b> This is good length, angled in at off stump. Iyer looks to whip it over the midwicket boundary, gets a leading edge that flies to Yusuf's right at third man. Lands in front of him and he has covered it nicely but ruins the end with laziness. Too slow in getting his hands up after it bounces. Tips it over the boundary"
"good length, angled into the pads, tickled past short fine leg with no trouble"
"full at leg stump, flicks it aerially, finds deep midwicket on the bounce"
"plays away from the body and nearly chops on. This nips back in off a length outside off. He looks to push on the up with and angled bat, gets an inside edge that goes past leg stump"
"<b>huge!</b> Wow. Back of a length at off stump, sits up nicely at waist height for him. He has made a bit of room and struck this cleanly on the up over the deep midwicket boundary. Class."
"and then follows it up with an awkward, ugly shot. This is full at off stump, one he might have driven straight down the ground. Instead he wants to whip across the line. Seems like he's late on that decision and he's mid-movement as this thuds into his pads right in front of middle stump. No doubts there"

"back of a length just outside off stump, gets deep into the crease and cuts, straight to point"
"gets him. And he might be unlucky, this might have been going down. This is full and angled in at Pant. His head is falling over into the off side as he looks to flick. He's caught on the pad in front of leg stump and Nigel Llong raises the finger on the appeal"
"short ball outside off stump, opens the face, dabs it past the keeper, easy peasy"
"good length at middle stump, flicked to deep square leg"
"crunched. This is overpitched outside off stump, he winds up and springs all his power at this to thump his drive wide of mid-off"

"good length outside off stump, climbs past his anxious poke and beats the outside edge"
"tossed full at middle stump, swept hard, straight to deep square"

"tossed up at off stump, driven to long-off"
"back of a length wrong'un at middle stump, goes deep in the crease and whips off the back foot to deep midwicket's left"
"wrong'un, short and wide. Shapes to pull, adjusts for the massive turn and bunts it away from the body to long-off"
"<b>dropped!</b> Kuldeep off his own bowling again. But this was drilled hard. He tossed it up full at off again, Anderson cleared the front leg and slammed this back to Kuldeep's right. He got two hands on it but couldn't hold on"
"a mix-up and Anderson's nervous stay is over. Back of a length ball, spins away from off stump. He prods at it away from the body, gets a thick outside edge that rolls towards point. He's almost halfway down the pitch and is sent back, but the under-am throw has come in already and Jackson finishes the job"

"full at middle stump, flicks uppishly to deep midwicket's left"
"full outside off stump, it's an offcutter that pitches and just about flies over the wide marker. He lets it go, it's not a wide"

"low full toss at middle stump, lots of flourish as he flicks, but it is one bounce to deep square leg"
"good ball. Morris is camping in his crease to swat anything in his arc. He gets a slower bouncer and is beaten, through the shot early"
"full, swinging in at off stump. Jams it straight to mid-off, runs insinctively, then sends his partner back. The throw didn't come, Bawne was halfway down"
<b>what a catch.</b> Full and wide outside off stump. Morris is low as he reaches out for this. Slices it nicely off the middle of the bat but Woakes has run in from third man and dived forward to snap it up low

"good length around off stump, angling away from the left-hander, Gambhir stays back and angles his bat to let the ball run off the face towards point, they take a hurried single"
"there's how you deal with a pinch-hitter, the stumps in disarray. Serious speed, pitching around leg stump and seaming across the left-hander. Narine stays back - he's not going to rush at Rabada's pace - and gets squared up, the ball screams past the outside edge and uproots off stump"
"shot! Leans forward and across to a fuller ball and flicks with superb timing, Iyer makes a mess of the sliding save on the boundary. Concedes two extra runs."

"shocking fielding, just shocking. Uthappa skies the pull off a short ball, rushed for time by the pace, and it began to descend in the region between short fine leg and square leg. Samson and Mishra converge under the ball and in the end no one goes for the catch. They were about six feet apart as the ball hit the ground between then. Ridiculous."

"strays down leg side, Uthappa misses the flick but the ball brushes his pads and flies wide of the keeper to the fine leg boundary"
"just a chip really but Radaba's pace makes the ball carry over the fielder at mid-on, who ran back and dived full length in vain, and then the ball raced to the boundary. Rabada is not amused."

"bowled flatter and wider outside off stump, Gambhir doesn't move towards it and so isn't well placed to connect with the cut"

"short ball at no real pace, it sits up for Gambhir who waits on the back foot and pulls hard into the gap on the deep midwicket boundary"
"a direct hit from backward point but has Uthappa made it? No enthusiasm from the Daredevils fielders, but perhaps that's because this match has got away from them? Because Uthappa is short of his crease. Gambhir played a short of a length ball straight to point and Uthappa responded to the single.

"short ball down leg side, that's a wide and KKR win with 3.4 overs to spare"
