Beaten playing around his pad and struck on off stump at first view.

Smith shuffles across once more to flick this high over backward square, Cottrell made an absolute mess of a chance on 26 in an identical slot, this time sprints along the rope 20 yards moving left at full speed and stabs at it with his left hand, knifing it out of the air, then flicks it up before stepping over the rope before reclaiming it after reestablishing himself inside the field of play. 10 out of 10 for sure!"
"wide yorker, too wide to play at."

"fullish length angled into off stump, chopped off the back foot to third man."
"<strong>dropped!</strong> Very harsh but it did ricochet off Brathwaite's hand at deep square leg and then hit the rope on the full for six. Shortish length on off stump, Coulter-Nile laces a scorching pull toward Brathwaite at deep square leg, just evades his grasp running to his left and sliding at the last moment. After the take that Cottrell just had in the previous over, the fans and teammate's must be wondering why Brathwaite couldn't match him! But it was 10/10 on the degree of difficulty scale."
"<b>highest score now by a No. 8 in a World Cup!</b> In the slot outside off, drives through the line 15 yards into the stands over long-on."
"short outside off, slapped to long-off."
"fullish length outside off, pushed to extra cover, good stop by Nurse moving left to keep it to one."
"slower bouncer, Cummins struggles keeping his hands back going to pull, skies it to deep square leg, Cottrell settles under it 10 yards in from the rope. This was 3/10 on the difficulty scale compared to the absurd one-hander he took to dismiss Smith."
"full and very wide, dips the back knee to get under this and carve it over extra cover. Exquisite."

"wide yorker, inside edge dragged to Gayle at short fine leg."
"full and wide, <b>thick edge driving but it doesn't carry to Hope.</b>"

"short on the body, goes to pull, off the glove before bouncing short of Hope. Does well to save four."
"very full on the legs, clipped behind square, relay comes in from long leg running right."
"full and wide, driven in the air toward Hetmyer at mid-off, he dives right to knock it down but not cleanly enough to prevent a second run. It means Coulter-Nile will be on strike for the next over."
"full and wide, Coulter-Nile misses a drive, but Hope fumbles the take. Universe Boss makes a galaxy sprint from short third man to relay back in. He's holding his left hammy now. Given as runs by the umpire instead of byes."
"<b>Coulter-Nile falls four short of breaking the record for a No. 8 in ODIs!</b> It was in the slot outside off, he went for glory trying to clear Holder at wide long-off but got under it just a bit too much. The bat turned on connection too so wasn't timed as well as he wanted. In the air for awhile before coming down to the West Indies captain three yards inside the rope."
"slower bouncer, Starc is early trying to pull at 78 mph."
"another short ball, this time Starc crunches it sweet through midwicket."
"bouncer on the body, late hooking. No wide called on the line down leg. Ball passed over leg stump."
"Brathwaite rewarded for pitching it up again, in the slot on off, Starc tried to heave it over Holder at wide long-on but didn't get under it enough and the tallest man on the field has no issues claiming this one roving left a few yards inside the rope at chest height."

"fullish length on fourth stump again, this time sucked into a flat-footed drive, beats the edge."
"overpitched on off, touch of swing in, driven to mid-on."
"<strong>lovely lines from the start by Cummins rewarded!</strong> He was probing away consistently on that fourth stump line. This one holds its line on fourth stump going across instead of swinging in, angles across Lewis on a good to fullish length at 86 mph, Lewis prods with a diagonal bat angle and the ball clips the edge flying to Smith's right at second slip, taken at thigh height crouching into a mini-slide to cushion the take."
"full on the legs, whipped straight to Coulter-Nile at midwicket. Gimme ball and couldn't put it away."
"<b>stays low and nearly bowled!</b> Good length ball pitching on about fifth stump and angled in, Hope goes back and it doesn't bounce as much as he thought it would at 86 mph, the ball coos into the ear of off stump. No kissing though..."
"good length on off, defended to cover."
"<b>nearly a catch!</b> Short and wide, Gayle rocks back to cut, it was in the air for awhile, but Stoinis is a bit too square at cover for the chance, he dives right to knock it down at the very least on the short hop."
"short outside off on fourth stump, Gayle goes to pull and plays over the top of it."
"<b>another one clips the edge but goes safe over Carey! Rip-snorter from Starc!</b> Short ball angled into the body from off stump, Gayle tries to get the hands behind it on the back foot and it climbs sharply , clips the shoulder of the bat and takes off over Carey's leaping effort to the rope."
"<b>given out but Gayle reviews immediately!</b> Fullish length on fourth stump angled in, Gayle is late driving as there was a definite noise when it passed the stumps... because the ball has in fact shaved off stump. A little peck! The baby smooch! Not a full pucker to dislodge the bails though. Incredible!"
"short and wide outside off, too wide to play."
"<b>yorker nails Gayle on the toes and he's given out but Gayle challenges umpire Chris Gaffaney's judgment once more with a review!</b> It was tailing in and hits him on the front pad ricocheting to the back foot, initial impact was showing it was tailing down leg. Sure enough ball-tracking shows <b>the impact was outside leg stump</b> and continuing to go down. Gayle survives again."

"<strong>stone dead this time around!</strong> Starc couldn't pierce Gayle with the yorker on the previous ball but this time around Gayle is late getting the bat down on an 86 mph delivery pitching very full and hitting him low on the shin in front of middle. After waiting 12 seconds while chatting with Hope, <strong>Gayle finally calls for the review....</strong> Ball-tracking confirms it was clipping leg-stump on umpire's call. Three strikes (on DRS) and you're out! West Indies retain their review though."

"<strong>floated into the legs, goes to sweep and after a very very long appeal, given out!</strong> If Holder had the Maxwell lbw overturned <strong>you can bet he was gonna go to DRS on this and after a chat with Russell he does. </strong> He's hit fairly low on the back leg bending forward missing the sweep. Impact was barely in line with leg stump and <strong>once again this is overturned. </strong>It didn't look promising live and umpire Palliyaguruge has this overturned, missing leg stump comfortably.

"flighted again full on leg stump, Russell takes a half step back to clear the front leg and slams this flat into the rope flush in front of the sightscreen.

"Russell steps away from leg again and Starc follows him with a short ball on the body, cramped for room he misses a pull ducking his head. Whatever Holder said didn't seem to have much impact on Russell's approach."
"Russell backs away from leg and Starc follows him too far down leg, misses a pull off his hips, clips the thigh down to long leg, sliding stop by Coulter-Nile at the rope saves it from being four leg byes."

"<strong>Russell's fiery cameo ended by Starc!</strong> And a brilliant take by Maxwell too! Russell continues backing away from leg stump for a mow over midwicket, Starc targets leg stump and Russell gets a leading edge skier over point. Maxwell runs out from the circle taking this over the shoulder a third of the way to the rope. Sensational grab, 8/10 on degree of difficulty but it was bog standard for Maxwell. Whatever Holder said to Russell at the start of the over to have him rein in his aggression failed to produce the desired effect from the captain. Totally unnecessary from Russell at this stage."

"fullish length on fifth stump, Brathwaite hops across the stumps to defend, struck on the pads but well outside the line of off stump."
"<strong>nearly another drag on!</strong> Good length ball angled into off stump, little footwork and a poke produces an inside edge lodged in between his feet."

"another bouncer, this time full speed at 83 mph, fought off behind point."

"short ball at full pace this time sits up on the off stump line, <strong>laces a ferocious pull on one bounce to cow corner, 50 up for Holder at a run a ball. Can he finish off the chase?</strong>"
"<strong>Brathwaite has officially joined the party!</strong> Another bouncer, wide outside off, Brathwaite has to drag this a long way to get it over midwicket, but that's pure muscle on the pull and it sails away."
"good length ball on fourth stump, opens the face to run it to third man."
"short on off, Brathwaite goes to pull again, flat bats this over mid-off. Not timed well at all but straight enough to be safe from picking out Finch on the ring."
"short again, clear plan here, once again doesn't middle it but clears Warner by about 5 yards on the ring at mid-on. Australia sniffing closer here..."
"<strong>nearly a runout! At both ends!</strong> Fullish length ball driven to mid-on. Warner fields and fires at the non-striker's end, would've been out by 3 yards if it hit but was wide by 2 yards. Cummins fields the miss mid-pitch and throws to Carey, nearly nabs Holder but he's just in by 4 inches. Replay shows Carey knocked the bails off without the ball in his hands."

"<strong>slower ball brings a wicket!</strong> It was an attempted yorker with plenty of pace off it, met by Brathwaite at shin height as a low full toss, but completely miscues it off the toe of the bat high over mid-on. Finch backpedals 10 yards back and to the left before taking it with ease. The tension rises a few notches. Can Holder shepherd the tail across the line?"
"yorker on off stump, dug out off the toe to Starc."
"full toss at knee height wide outside off on sixth stump, Holder fans over the top of it nervously. Fingernails being chewed intensely in the crowd."
"<b>Starc is winning this for Australia!</b> The pressure looked like it was getting to Holder after missing out on a meaty full toss the previous ball. Starc follows it up with a bouncer on the leg stump line, he goes to pull but is late and it thuds off the gloves. The ball balloons to Zampa at short fine leg, he only needs to take three steps forward from the ring to claim this at chest height."
"yorker on fourth stump, Nurse plays over the top, ball just misses the off stump."
"bouncer on the body, Nurse turtles his head out of the way."
now a charge from Nurse. Stoinis saw it coming and pitched it full as Nurse ran down the pitch backing away from leg stump and he swings over the top with his head flying up.
"<strong>low full toss into the pads, huge lbw shout given not out. Double-noise for sure. Australia decides not to review. </strong> And with good reason, inside edge off the pads with the ball taking a carom to point."

"yorker speared into the legs, dug out to long-on."

"yorker speared into the legs, misses a flick and the ball ricochets to point."
<strong>yorker makes it five for Starc!</strong> Man of the Match just about locked up for him turning this chase haywire for West Indies. Cottrell backed away trying to make room over the off side but it was full and straight and shatters the stumps.
