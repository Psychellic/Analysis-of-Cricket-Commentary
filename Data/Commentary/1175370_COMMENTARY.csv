"back of a length, fourth-stump line, jabbed to point"
"shortish, minimal width, chopped down to point"

"length ball angling in towards off stump, gets on the front foot to clip it watchfully through midwicket"
"full on off stump, clipped to midwicket"
"ooh, swing for Thakur too. Beautiful traditional good length, angling into the fourth-stump line and swinging away in a pronounced manner. Rohit doesn't really get forward, just pushes at the drive, aiming towards mid-off, and the ball curves past his outside edge"
"length ball, a little wider, presses forward to push towards cover point"
"nicely bowled. Shifts his line wider, but this one isn't quite as full. Goes for the flat-bat drive and is defeated by outswing and bounce"
"full, late swing to straighten the ball towards off stump. Shows the full face to punch to mid-off"
"length ball on off stump, gets on the front foot to push into the gap between extra-cover and cover point"
"back of a length, a bit of nip in towards leg stump. Tucked away towards square leg, where Shardul, sprinting to his right and diving, misfields to allow a single"
"first boundary of the day, not too convincing. Back of a length, nips back in from outside off, and de Kock goes for a half-front-foot jab, aiming to hit through cover point. Ends up inside-edging it past his off stump instead"
"got him, Chahar gets the early breakthrough. Takes a premeditated step out of his crease, which turns this short ball into one that isn't quite short enough to pull. He gets cramped a little, and ends up swiping it at catchable height, just over Jadhav's left shoulder, to square leg"
"back of a length close to off stump, punched to cover"
"back of a length on off stump, defended towards mid-off"
"shortish, gets some extra bounce along the fifth-stump channel. Don't know what Suryakumar was trying to do there, trapped between playing and leaving I guess. Jabs at it and gets a thick outside edge that runs down to third man"
"fullish outside off, and this is not just a bouncy pitch but a bouncy square too. Suryakumar plays a checked drive, into the turf, and it bounces up over the leaping cover fielder"
"shot! Even better than the previous one. Fullish, angling in towards middle stump, and he keeps his front leg out of the way and is perfectly balanced as he shows the full face and drives to the left of mid-on"
"short, angling into the batsman's hip. Swivels to pull to fine leg"
"too much width, way too much width, and Rohit plays a front-foot slap that flies away between point and backward point"

"slower length ball outside off, punched to the right of Jadhav at cover"
"back of a length on middle stump, worked away to the left of fine leg"
"shortish outside off, stops on the pitch a little. Jumps up to slap it, without too much power, into the cover point region"
"back of a length outside off, and there's a huge gap between cover, who's on the edge of the circle, and mid-off, who's stationed very straight. Suryakumar stands tall and punches it away through that gap"
"back of a length, angling into the stumps, punched to the right of mid-on, where Rayudu throws himself at the ball but can only get his fingertips to it. Slows it down a little, but not enough to prevent four even with a lung-busting chase to the boundary"
"back of a length, too straight, and that's clipped away crisply off the pads to the left of midwicket. Met it with a straight bat and didn't really need to close the face at all. Classy shot"
"back of a length, slower offcutter nipping in towards the thigh pad. Tucked away to fine leg"
"back of a length on off stump, lets it come on and drops it into the cover point region with soft hands"

"back of a length, goes on straight towards off stump, lets it come on and works it to deep midwicket"
"tossed up outside off, driven to long-off"
"length ball, wide-ish line, not much turn. Opens his bat face to steer to deep point"
"nice flight and dip outside off. A legbreak with more overspin than sidespin, and Suryakumar plays a checked drive back to the bowler"
"is that an edge? Dhoni thinks so, and Rohit trudges off. Typical Jadeja wicket, a flat length ball just outside off stump, and it rips away sharply off the pitch as Rohit looks to drive through the covers with an angled bat. They're checking for Jadeja's front foot. He always seems to be on the verge of overstepping while delivering, but usually pulls his leg back so that his heel's behind the crease when the foot lands, even if it's in the air. Looks to be the case here too"
"flat length ball outside off, presses forward to defend, squeezes it into the gap to the right of short extra-cover"
"full now, on off stump, driven to short extra-cover"
"back of a length, comes in with the angle towards middle and leg. Punched to long-on"
"flat length ball close to off stump, Yuvraj stretches out and blocks watchfully"
"back of a length, a bit of width, chopped down towards backward point, where Thakur misfields and allows the single, and then nearly concedes overthrows at the striker's end. Thankfully for him, the fielder at deep square leg is alert to the possibility and has backed up well"
"lovely. Quickish length ball, angled across, pitching on about off stump, and Yuvraj isn't sure which way it's turning as he stretches out to defend. It's the googly, and it slides past his outside edge"
"shortish on leg stump, pulled to the left of deep square leg"
"gone! That looked like a clean strike from Yuvraj, and it was, the lofted drive against the full ball on off stump. Frees his arms and it looks like vintage Yuvraj, but long-off is back on the boundary, and Rayudu takes it with both hands, over his head, and even though he's stepping backwards as he takes it he doesn't get too close to the rope. They check a few times anyway, from multiple angles"
"tossed up, angling away from off stump, gets on the front foot to defend into the covers"
"flighted ball on off stump, driven back to the bowler"

"full, angling into middle and leg, driven inside-out to long-off"
"length ball outside off, defended to short extra"
"flat, pushed through on off stump, clipped with the turn to midwicket"
"fired in flat at middle stump, a little fuller. Stays back because of the trajectory and clips to midwicket"
"the pace on the ball has been his friend so far. Now Krunal turns it into his foe. Quickish length ball pitching just outside off, and that's fast hands to reverse-paddle it between keeper and short third man"
"back of a length close to off stump, opens his bat face to steer it to the right of backward point"
"full on the stumps, pushed back down the pitch"
"too short and he spotted it early, went down and swept it fine. Tahir went for the quicker one but lost his length"
"tossed up, ends as a full toss and driven to cover"
"fuller length outside off, driven to long-off"
"keeps it very full on the stumps again, Krunal drives from the crease to long-off"
"drags it a little short again, whipped off his pads to deep midwicket"
nice looking straight drive to a slower ball on leg stump. He didn't try to hit it too hard though and long-on comes around to collect
"gets it wider that time outside off, and Krunal throws his bat at it, trying to drive, but inside edges to short midwicket"
"length ball outside off, driven to cover, but not timed well enough"
"went over the top, didn't time it all that well but meaty enough to clear the in-field, which is all he needed because there's no long-off. Full outside off, the bat turned a bit in his hands"
"that's a pull shot hit hard enough for Rayudu to concede a four despite being behind the ball at deep square leg. Dragged it down a bit and Krunal latched on to it, Rayudu wanted to stop the ball on the bounce, but was on the edge of the boundary and over-stepped while in contact with the ball"
"length ball, punched back past the bowler"
"length ball on the stumps, punched to deep midwicket off the back foot"
"slower ball, length on the fourth stump line, he checks his punch back to the bowler"
"rolled his fingers over that one again, 115 kph. On a length outside off, pushed towards cover-point"
"<b>dropped by Mohit at mid-off</b> that was as easy a catch as you can get, he drove it off the toe end straight to the fielder. He tried to grab at it too early perhaps, in and out of his hands. Bravo is not happy"
"slashed off a thick outside edge, once bounce to third man, who almost fumbles it but recovers in time"
"full on the stumps, clipped off his toes to midwicket"
drilled back straight but Shardul has time to get down and parry it with his right hand and keep the batsmen down to just a single
"<b>trapped him in front</b> and the finger's gone up but the batsman has chosen to review. And the replays show why! <b>inside edge onto pad</b>. Length ball that was moving in a touch from outside off, Krunal pushed at it and got a thin edge onto pad, which is the only thing that's saved him, because otherwise that was crashing into the stumps"
"goes around the wicket and strays on the pads, is picked off to deep square leg"
driven between cover and point with an open bat face
"angled into the batsman, almost yorker length, he goes deep in his crease and flicks it to short midwicket"
goes across and works this to deep square leg from middle stump. And we'll have a strategic time-out
strays on leg stump and is swept to fine leg for a couple
"<b>breaks the shackles</b> Krunal was getting tied down, this time he just decided to free his arms. A little slower on the stumps but a touch too full and he clears his front leg and has a big swing to send it well over long-on"
driven to long-off
"full toss, drifts on the pads, whipped to long-on"
"quicker ball, drags it too short, and Krunal rocks back to pull powerfully but Raina at midwicket fields it by getting body behind ball"
"<b>direct hit run out missed?</b> swiped to Raina again, and they take the quick single. He had time to line up the stumps and let loose, but misses and I think Krunal would have been out despite a dive. Oh and replays show he would have just made it."
too full and flicked off his toes between long-on and deep midwicket
"oh that's nicely done. was backing away to give himself room, the bowler followed him, but he opened the face from close to his body and steered it wide of short third man. The length was too short, allowed him to adjust"
"slower ball on fifth stump, he has a swipe at it, sends it along the ground to deep midwicket"
"very full, low full toss, drilled back straight past the bowler. Jadeja runs quickly from long-off and cuts it off, but almost mis-fields. Recovers quickly and picks up the ball to fire the throw back in"
"ugly swipe across the line to this slower ball, on a length on middle and leg. The ball loops up off the top edge but lands safe, well in front of deep midwicket"
"full again, squirted past point"
"back of a length outside off, he pulls it from there, but without timing, bounces to deep midwicket"
"<b>just over Jadhav at short third man</b> full outside off, it flies off the outside edge with his attempted drive going nowhere, and Jadhav is running back to try and latch on but the ball not only evades him, it beats him to the fence"
just over Watson's head at cover. <B>Krunal should buy a lottery ticket today</b> punch-driven powerfully and Watson jumped up. Was mighty close to his fingertips but goes over and into the fence
"<b>he's holed out to long off</b> Krunal's luck has finally run out. Went for another big heave over the off side but got a leading edge that flew high in the air. Jadeja was settling under it and even though the ball was swirling and he had to lunge at the end, he was never letting it go"
<b>bang</b> pick up sweep from outside off and he absolutely nails it. Sweet sound off the bat and the ball screams through the air and deep into the square leg stands
"too full and driven back straight, but there's a long-on so he'll only get a single"
"very full again, at normal pace this one, driven off his toes to long-on"
"<b>well bowled</b> he's got a reputation for bowling slower balls, so what does he do? He bowls a sharp bouncer, and Hardik is very late to spot that, bails out of the shot"
"very full and normal pace again, he's keeping the batsmen guessing. Full on yorker length, Hardik flicks it fine from between his legs"
"ther's the slower one, and it's just 92 kph on the fifth stump line. Surya was giving himself room and trying to go over extra cover, misses it completely."
"flat bats it straight past the bowler and into the fence. Just misses the yorker, and Surya has drilled it back so straight and so well that it beats even Jadeja's drive"
"and he's holed out to Jadeja at long-on this time. A slight shimmy down the track and this was another normal pace delivery, Suryakumar wanted to go over cow corner, ends up with a leading edge that Jadeja settles under"
"<b>get that ball a visa because it's travelling out of here</b> too short and Hardik just stands in his crease, transfers weight back and wallops it waaaaay into the square leg stands"
"yorker length on the fourth stump line, slashed to point. They were thinking of a second because Dhoni fumbled the ball, but Dhoni ran back down the length of the pitch and forced Hardik to turn back and scramble for his crease. Dhoni under-arms to the stumps but misses, but Hardik would have made his ground. Smiles all around"
"goes for the wide yorker, but just beyond the tram lines and he'll have to bowl it again"
"follows it with a bouncer that Pollard ducks under. Well directed, just over his shoulder and not a wide"
"gets the line right that time, just inside the tram line. Pollard stays rooted to his crease and tries to slam it through the offside, but is forced to reach for it and doesn't connect."
"that's a wide again, too far down legside"
"<b>walloped</b> too short again and not far enough outside off, Pollard's powerful forearms to the fore as he short-arm jabs it well over long-on"
"full toss on the stumps, flicked to deep midwicket"
"yorker at 139 kph, helicoptered off his toes to long-on"
"strays very far down leg, perhaps he was expecting the batsman to give himself room. Ends up as a wide"
"yorker on fifth stump, squirted to third man"
"<b>no-ball for height that's gone the distance</b> slipped out of Bravo's hands and above waist full toss. Pollard slaughters it, sends it soaring over the fence over square leg"
"bouncer for the free hit, pulled from outside off. Gets more height than distance and Deepak Chahar at midwicket drops it. Wouldn't have been out, but concedes an extra run with that drop"
"<b>helicoptered into the top tier</b> this is some finish by Mumbai. Yorker on the stumps and Hardik goes deep in his crease and pulls out the helicopter, giving Dhoni a great view behind the stumps, and smashes it over cow corner"
"full outside off and Hardik punch-drives it by opening the face, such great connection that it flies to the extra cover fence"
<b>incredible finish by Hardik</b> full outside off and he goes low and slashes it - the timing is so good on it again that it flies all the way over third man. <b>29 runs off the final over</b>
"back of a length, slanting away with steep bounce outside off, left alone"
"back of a length, closer to off stump this time, punched crisply to backward point"
"fuller now, angling away from off stump. Looks for the lofted hit over mid-off, ends up slicing it in the air, and on the bounce, to third man"
"got him, there's the bounce I spoke about! Takes off from a length as it slants away into the fifth-stump corridor, and Rayudu, getting on the front foot to defend, ends up nicking to the keeper off the shoulder of his bat. First-ball duck for him"
"and he's bowling like he has a red ball in his hand. Back of a length, angling in and straightening away in the fourth-stump channel. Raina is on the hop and looking to defend and the ball beats his outside edge"
"squared up, huge appeal for caught behind, not given, not reviewed. Unplayable delivery again, angling in, hitting that short-of-good length, and straightening from even closer to off stump, and Raina is spun around in midair as he looks to defend"
"now it's Malinga's turn to get a bit of swing in the air and a lot of bounce off the wicket. Short outside off, and the bounce beats Watson's slash. And he's overstepped too"
"just short of a good length, fifth-stump line. Watson looks to hit it over mid-off, and the late outswing causes him to edge thickly and over slip's head"
"short, wide, slapped, and straight to Pollard! It was there to be slapped away, alright, but he picked out the fielder at point. Anyone else, and it would have comfortably cleared the fielder, but Pollard times his jump well and doesn't even have to reach too far overhead to catch it"
"length ball curving away outside off, left alone"
"massive bounce from a pretty full length outside off, and that late outswing too. Wise decision from Jadhav to leave it"
"shortish, curving away into the fourth-stump channel. Defended towards point"
"short again, close to off stump, hops up to ride the bounce and defend towards mid-on"
"back of a length, rising up steeply over middle and leg, hops up to tuck it towards square leg"
"short, angling down leg, Raina hops across to try and tuck it fine off his hip, but can't make contact"
"typical Raina. Back of a length outside off, and Raina creates some extra room and carves it away, high over cover"
"length ball angling into middle stump, stays back and clips to midwicket"
"back of a length on off stump, shuffles across and clips to the left of square leg"
"back of a length, pitching within the stumps and angling away from left-arm over. Left alone"
"back of a length, closer to off stump, defended towards point"
"length ball, angling away from off stump. presses forward to defend, plays a bit early, off the inside edge towards midwicket"
"back of a length, slanting away into the fifth-stump channel. Jumps across to dab to backward point"
"yorker, close to leg stump, flicked to the left of deep backward square leg. There was a chance of a second but both batsmen hesitated while turning and the chance went away"
"full, too straight, and Jadhav has timed that beautifully. Flicks it off his legs, up and over backward square leg"
"length ball, a bit of late swing away from off stump. Wanted to clip this through the leg side initially, held his shape and adjusted to play it to mid-off"
"this is poor bowling with fine leg inside the circle. Again it's full and on the pads, and Jadhav flicks it over the leaping fielder at short fine"
"shortish, fifth-stump line, and Raina is all over the place with his feet, on the move and in midair while trying to stab it away to third man. Doesn't get any bat on it in the end, beaten by pace and bounce"
"another rising delivery, angling into middle stump now. Jumps to ride the bounce and keeps it down into the leg side"
"was that deliberate? Looked awkward, but there was a little opening of the bat face when he played it. Shortish, rising ball in the corridor, and he jumps up and steers it past the keeper diving to his left. Why no slip?"
"length ball angling into off stump and Raina makes himself room while coming down the track, and carves it away over extra-cover once more"
"full, almost in the blockhole, angling into off stump, clipped to mid-on"
"Kieron Pollard, what a catch that is! He seems to pull off one or two of these every season, doesn't he? He's stationed a few yards in on the point boundary, and Raina makes a bit of room and slaps this off-stump length ball ferociously in his direction. It's travelling at high pace, and it's over his head, and by the time he jumps up and catches it, right arm fully stretched over his head, the ball is almost behind him. Still manages to hold on while he tumbles backwards"
"short, rising ball that nips in off the track to cramp Jadhav as he shapes to cut. Ends up inside-edging into his body"
"length ball, straightens from a fourth-stump line. Again he was looking to use the initial angle and clip through mid-on or midwicket, ends up adjusting to flick to extra-cover"
"back of a length, angling into off stump. Extra bounce and a bit of inward movement to beat the flick and hit the thigh pad"
"back of a length, angling into off stump, steps across to tuck it away through backward square leg"
"extra bounce from back of a length, angling into off stump. Dhoni plays close to his body and defends into the on side"
"again, that extra bounce from short of a good length. Bottom hand comes off the handle as Dhoni defends into the leg side"
"shortish, extra bounce in the corridor and it straightens a touch off the seam too. Jadhav is opened up slightly while defending into the off side"
"he was setting himself up for this, waiting for it. It's short, a little bit outside off, and he's in position early to pull it away to the right of midwicket"
"fuller now, angling into off stump, clipped to the left of deep square leg, and it looks like Bumrah's overstepped here"
"oh my word, that's a super shot! In the blockhole, angling into off stump, and Jadhav goes deep in his crease with his back foot to create a tiny bit of swinging room, and brings out a bottom-hand shovel over mid-on"
"Jadhav's having fun here. Goes short now, in the fourth-stump corridor, and Jadhav leans back and uses the pace and bounce to ramp it nice and fine, over the man at wide-ish slip. Third man's too square to even dream of stopping this"
"length ball outside off, shuffles across to jab to backward point"
"back of a length close to off stump, opens his bat face to dab to backward point"
"shortish, close to off stump, makes room and cuts but can't beat backward point"

"nice loop close to off stump, gets on the front foot to block to short extra-cover"
"another legbreak, on a good length outside off, presses forward and defends into the gap to the left of short extra"
"short, the turn gives Dhoni lots of width, slapped to the man at deep point"
"flight and dip outside off, turn too. Didn't pitch full enough for Jadhav to drive inside-out over the covers as intended, but he gets four anyway, thick outside edge to the third man boundary"
"length ball angling across to off stump, gets forward to ease a checked drive to the right of deep point"
"back of a length on leg stump, nudged away to deep square leg"
"full, angling away from off stump. Jadhav shuffles out of his crease before the bowler releases, and across his stumps too, and gets into position to clip it quietly down to long-on"
"ooh, beauty. Length ball, pitching on about middle and off and nipping away to accentuate the angle away. No feet from Dhoni, just pushes at it and ends up playing inside the line"

"back of a length, spinning from middle to off, worked away through square leg"

"back of a length, closer to off stump, opens his bat face and stabs to Malinga at short third man"
"back of a length on leg stump, tucked away through forward square leg"
wrong'un pitching fairly short outside off. Dhoni leaves it alone. Don't know if he picked it

"full ball angling into him, picked off his toes to long-on"
"a bit wider outside off, Dhoni wanted to swat it hard, but gets an under-edge that bounces to the bowler's right. His bat needs some maintenance after that, uses Jadhav's bat to hammer out a few stray pieces"

"length ball outside off, slashed along the ground to third man"
"<b>brilliant catch by de Kock</b> Jadeja knew he had to go for it, was giving himself room and looking to carve it through the off side, only manages a thick outside edge to this length ball and de Kock dives to his left and plucks out the ball"

"back of a length, mistimed pull to midwicket"
"moving across the stumps, Bumrah bowls a quick one that nips in a touch flicks his pad and goes past the keeper. But they've been keeping the third man and fine leg very fine for Jadhav, so third man is able to run across and field it"

"starts with a yorker on the stumps, that Chahar gets behind and carefully turns to square leg"
"another slower ball, Bravo gave himself room and wanted to lift this over cover, but doesn't connect again"

"<b>caught at fine leg</b> Chahar was backing away again, this was another back of length ball that followed him. He made contact this time though and got a top edge. Ironically it's Bumrah who's the catcher. The last over, Chahar had tried the same shot against Bumrah twice but failed to connect"
"gets it off the toe-end of the bat but manages to hit it just beyond the straight boundary. Full ball on off, free swing of the bat. Doesn't get the timing at all, but just got enough on it for it to carry"
"he's ending with a flourish at least, ensuring the damage to the net run-rate is minimal. length ball on off and clobbered through extra cover for a well struck boundary"
"length ball, and he was targetting cow corner, but gets a top edge that loops up high in the air and falls safe - behind the bowler but well in front of long-on"
"swing and a miss. short ball, backing away and he misses it"
"back of a length outside off again, it's a hard length and a tailender will miss it more often than not, as Mohit does. That ends that. <b>Mumbai Indians win by 37 runs.</b>"
