"good length just outside off. Rayudu opens his bat's face and carves towards point. Not hit well enough, but still allows them to take the run"

"good length, just outside off. Worked towards the off side, and played off the back foot"

"full on leg stump, gets down on one knee to slog sweep, but misses out. Hits his leg, but impact's outside leg stump"

"on leg stump, goes to pull this hard, but deceived by the pace. The ball goes down the leg side to the keeper"

"good length outside off, and once again played delicately! Stays on the back foot and opens his bat's face to play the cut between backward point and short third man. Deft from Dhoni."
"a googly, dropped short and coming in at leg stump. Gets low and drags it out to long leg with a pull"
he's taken at long-on! K Gowtham assists Gopal again. Just about. Dhoni steps out against the googly and is too close to it despite getting to the pitch of it at a good length in front of off. No room to swing and his attempted slog comes off the inside half and goes straight to Gowtham. He looks to take with a reverse-cup but eventually completes the catch after stretching to his right on the second attempt

"googly, back of a length and in at leg stump. Goes deep in the crease and flicks towards deep square"

"length ball wide outside off, lifts it on the up to extra cover on the bounce"

slower ball on a length on off stump. Backs away and has to adjust to tap this straight to mid-off. Wanted to drive that
"<b>picks out deep midwicket.</b> CSK are having something of a slide on the end opposite to Watson's. It's a half-tracker from Gopal. Which is smart of him, because that's how you get wickets in the IPL if you're a spinner now. Sits up nicely on middle stump and he slaps it, flat, to Stokes in the deep"
"good length ball outside off, blocked solidly on the front foot"
"slider, back of a length outside off. Gets on the back foot and taps to long-on"
"short ball on middle, backs away and punches to deep midwicket off the back foot"

<b>past backward point!</b> Laughlin with the trademark floater outside off. It's dropped short though. Watson is pristine tonight. Perfect weight transfer and timing on the back foot
"length on middle stump, driven on the up to long-on"
"<B>tickled past short fine.</b> Superb stuff. He's expecting a short ball. It's also a slower ball though, so he's forced to adjust after leaping to get behind it. Still has the skill to get his hands in front of the body and run it fine"
"bouncer at an off stump line. Normal pace this time, he's forced to get his head out of the way"

length and angled in at leg stump. Flicked uppishly towards deep square
"<b>century!</b> Stays deep in the crease, allows the offcutter to come on and gently nudges it through cover to get his fourth T20 century. Fully in control tonight, the allrounder"
"<B>beaten.</b> Well bowled by Unadkat. Offcutter, back of a length on off stump. He shapes to slog but this skids through from under his shot"
lifts it over backward point. Offcutter dug in short of a length. He waits for it to come close and goes late at it and uses his wrists to lift this over
<b>dropped</b> by Sanju Samson at backward point. Jumping up with two hands but he can't hold on. This one flies off the face of the bat and it's a difficult one after Bravo's energetic swing for the cut
<b>lands in front of third man</b> where Gopal goes brilliantly to get his palm behind it as it lands to his right. An offcutter outside off that Watson tries to lift on the up over extra cover. Ends up slicing it high and Gopal puts in the dive but can't get his hand under that
"<B>drags it one-handed</b> to deep square's right. He's done by the slower short ball, but the typical elongated hands as he looks to pull means he has a chance yet. Uses that left hand to place this"
"length on middle stump, walks down the pitch and chips it towards long-on"
<b>beaten.</b> A full pace bouncer and he's too late on the hook
length ball angled in at middle stump. Slogs at it and gets it between deep square and deep midwicket off the inside half of the bat
<b>falls short</b> of long-on. Watson not as fluent this over. It's a length ball on middle and it gets too big on him as he looks to slog. A feeble chip towards Gowtham who doesn't run in quickly enough
<b>shot!</b> Steps out and scythes it on the up over extra cover. Length ball fired in at off stump and he does stunningly to make so much room on this
full slower ball outside off. Gets into the off side and tries to paddle it after meeting it on the full. Can only tap it straight to short fine
<b>outside edge</b> falls short of the keeper. Bravo going across the line after stepping out as Laughlin floats this one away from off
bouncer dug in too short. He half-jabs at it. It's too high

slower ball pushed too far wide. It bends away and past the wide marker
"yorker outside off, jams it into the covers from deep in the crease"
<b>taken.</b> Watson gets the front leg into the leg side to set up for the slog. Never a good strategy against Laughlin's away drifters. It's going too far away and he gets a thin edge that carries to Buttler. A sensational innings from Watson ends
"yorker outside off, can't get under this for the slog. It dribbles wide of long-on who puts in a good throw on the bounce, but Laughlin can't collect this one-handed to effect the run out. Bravo would have been short"
"short and wide outside off. Rahane goes chasing after it, but can't cut it away. Through to the keeper, but the umpire reckons its too wide"
"back of a length on middle stump, which forces Rahane to tap it with soft hands towards the off side. Calls nice and early for the single"

good length on off and angling into him. Turned off his pads to deep midwicket on this occasion
"<b>almost chopped on!</b> Good length just outside off, and Rahane tries to punch towards cover. The ball comes just into him, and takes the inside of his bat. Lucky he didn't play that on"

"<b>check punched over long on!</b> Full on off, and Rahane comes dancing down the wicket before smacking it over Chahar's head. Terrific shot"

"full on middle, and angling into his toes. Too easy for Klaasen to simply flick it off his legs and past midwicket. Sloppy effort from Karn"
"good length just outside off, and gets big on Klaasen. Defended off the backfoot to the bowler"
"full on leg stump again, and Klaasen almost punishes this once more. Clipped off his toes, but straight to square leg"
"follows the batsman on the leg side. Full outside leg after seeing Klaasen walk across to the leg side. Cramped for space, but manages to squeeze it towards midwicket"
"<b>Thakur outclasses Klaasen!</b> Good length on middle, and that's dead centre. He tries to defend this straight back to Shardul, but played down the wrong line. Crashes straight into middle stump"
"full on middle and leg, and Samson misses the straight drive. Hits his front leg, and that's a big appeal for lbw! Turned down by the umpire, and CSK choose not to review. May have gone down the leg side...."
a bit of wobble in the corridor. He gets nicely behind the line and taps on the up to mid-off
<b>there is a review this time from CSK.</b> Knuckle ball cuts in and hits Rahane on the back flap after appearing to beat the inside edge as he looks to flick. It's pitched outside off and come in...not too bad on line. But it won't matter - <b>it has got a bit of the inside edge</b>. The review is lost.
"length on middle stump, shuffles and nudges it between the big space between long-on and deep square"
"length on leg stump, early on the flick and he ends up chipping it past the square leg umpire"
<b>chips it wide of midwicket</b> and deep square leg cleans up to his left. It's a bouncer at chest height and he gets under it on the hook
"<b>picks out deep square!</b> Once again, Samson struggles to get on top of a short ball. He's shadow-practicing rolling the bat over it as he walks off, but was nowhere near in position to do that as this short one skidded in towards his underarm. Got it off the high part of the bat and Karn Sharma snaps up a simple one"

"good length just outside off, walks into it as it slants across the corridor and clips it through midwicket off the inside half of the bat. Rahane calls confidently for the third"
"<b>short of deep square.</b> Well directed bouncer. Rahane picks it up in front of his helmet, with his weight going forward. Ends up slicing it, one bounce"

"slower on a length outside off, taps it on the up to extra cover who is right back on the circle"
length ball slanted across off stump. Looks to bludgeon it through cover on the up but he's gone too hard at it. Splices along the floor into the infield
short and in the corridor. Not enough room on the cut. Rayudu fumbles at backward point and they sneak in a run
"<b>knuckle ball to the top of middle!</b> Rahane stepping out, getting outside the line of the stumps on the leg side, and swiping aimlessly while swivelling as he's beaten by pace by this short of a length ball. An ugly hoick would be describing it accurately, but it's been induced by a superbly disguised ball"

"knuckle ball. Fired down leg side. Buttler was exposing the stumps in readiness for the ramp, but this was far too wide to make a connection"

"short of a length outside off, spanked on the up to sweeper cover"

"good length just outside off, and Unadkat's cut comes off the bat's bottom. Trickles away towards short third man"
"on off stump, and that's been comfortably flicked off the front foot to the gap on the leg side"
"full on off, and angling into the right-hander. He backs away and carves it towards cover for a run"
"full on middle, and Gopal tries to whip this over cow corner. The bat turns in his hand, so the shot goes towards deep backward square instead"
"overpitched on off stump, and all the batsman can do is squeeze it away towards cover point"
"<b>swatted away to the mid-wicket boundary!</b> Half-tracker on middle, and that's been pulled to the leg-side boundary"
"<b>crashes into middle stump!</b> Tossed up on middle, and this is the topspin from Karn. Unadkat misses the slog, and the ball sneaks under his bat. Nine down now"
"<b>it's all over!</b> Karn finishes with two wickets to his name. Good length outside off, and once again zipping straight through. The No. 11 tries to cut, but all he can get is a feather edge. Comfortably done by <i>thala</i> Dhoni as <b>Chennai Super Kings win by 64 runs!</b>"
