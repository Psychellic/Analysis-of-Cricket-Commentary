"better length this time, on the fifth stump, cuts to point"
"fuller this time, and he goes down to sweep. There is a man at deep square"
"good length, turning into him from outside off, moves across and clips it wide of mid-on"
"movement away from the right-hander on a length, defended back. Got it quite high on the bat, with the bounce more than he expected perhaps"
"<b>lovely bit of swing bowling</b>. Deepak Chahar's wicket-taking ways continue. Beautiful line, length and movement. Simmons' feet are rooted in cement and he drives away from the body, gets a nice thick edge that goes comfortably to slip."
"swings into him this time, but too far down leg. It's a wide but it shows Chahar is swinging it both ways again. Danger signs for batsmen."

"yorker length, bunted down to mid-off for a quick single"

"length on the stumps, clipped through the legside"
"good length on leg stump, tries to flick it away but misses. The ball rolls off the pad to short fine leg. Bhuvneshwar is interested but that was probably pitching outside leg. Replays confirm it did."
"length outside off, glided to third man."
"keeps it on a tight length and line, bunted to mid-on and they take a quick single. A direct hit might have had him in some trouble, but he was quick off the blocks."

"length outside off, slowed it up a bit. Slaps it to cover, not timed."
"<b>stunning</b>. Not that short, on leg though, and he stays still, swivels and pulls it with a strong bottom hand. Gets plenty of meat on it, sends it over fine leg"
"superb from Lewis. Got a hint of room outside off, stayed on the back foot and cuts it fiercely through point. Shorter than Chahar would like to bowl"

"slower ball, pushed to mid-off, too early into the shot and it hung in the air, but bounced in front of the fielder. Kohli there, who unleashes a throw and scores a direct hit at the striker's end - but the batsman is well home"

"rolls his fingers over it again, and bowls it very full. Too early into the shot again. Pushed to mid-off"

"length outside off, spins into him, he goes back and flat bats a pull to long-on"

"too short outside off, cuts it well but straight to point"
"<b>got him, beaten on the sweep.</b> Washington tossed it up nicely on off - bravely even, given what had happened earlier - and Lewis was moving across to sweep. Misses and is struck - but that looked like the <b>impact was outside off!</b>. He hasn't reviewed it though. Will that prove costly for West Indies? To be fair, it looked very much in front in real-time."

"<b>valiant attempt by Rahul at long-on</b> but he can't hold on. Too short, and he goes back to leather a pull to long-on. Rahul runs in and dives forward and to his right, but can't quite reach the ball. He went for the catch, so couldn't stop the boundary"

"<B>Rohit slips, then recovers, then takes a one-handed catch, and then releases it as he goes beyond the boundary!</b> Short ball on off, and slapped over the leg side.
