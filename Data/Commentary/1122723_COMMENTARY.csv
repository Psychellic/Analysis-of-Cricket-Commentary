"gone first ball! What a ripper! Pitches on off stump. Seams away late. Squares up the batsman. Gets extra bounce for good measure. Rahul, caught in the crease, forced to deal with a brutish delivery is caught behind. Sri Lanka have made their presence felt"
"beautiful bowling. In conditions like these, you have to pitch the ball in line with the stumps. And Lakmal does that, pitching it up to bring the batsman forward. Pujara, watching it carefully, and leaves it outside off"
"<b>cuts Pujara in half</b>! The indipper, and since it's fullish, and it moves only after pitching Pujara has no clue which way it will move. But the time it darts back in, he is nowhere"
"extra bounce, and Pujara, defending off the back foot, with soft hands, <b>nearly plays on</b>"
"back of a length and outside off, Pujara lets it go"
"teaser outside off, asking for Pujara to cover drive, but he's a little too smart for that"
"angled into the body from around the wicket, Dhawan waits for it so he can nudge it off his hips towards square leg"
"short ball, outside off, easy sighter for Pujara to avoid. Immediately Herath at mid-on goes over to talk to the bowler"
wide outside off this time and Pujara enjoys leaving one more freebie
"back of a length and outside off, Pujara is more than happy to not be tested like this"
"corrects his line, and the shortish delivery on middle at only 77 mph, is blunted well enough"
"full and wide, Pujara's work is done simply watching the ball wander through to the wickekeeper"
"tries to flick a full delivery on the pads, doesn't make contact with the bat, but will be happy to pinch the leg bye"
"good batting, meeting the ball late, getting on top of the bounce and guiding it to the gully fielder. A tough short this time from Lakmal, although the line is perfectly on off stump"
back of a length and outside off - and it's that length that gives Pujara the early warning that he can leave
"a little fuller, but Pujara is still able to cover it off the back foot. The line is a shade outside off"
"pitches it up outside off and makes it seam away, Pujara lets it go again"
"good work, targeting the stumps and making Pujara play. He does so waiting until the ball is right under his eyes. Good block"
"right then, he finds his line to the left-hander. Going around the wicket, he pitches it full and Dhawan very nearly falls for the angle. Goes for a flick, and only at the last moment does he square himself up and present a straighter face"
clips a shortish delivery off his hips to deep square leg
good leave. Dhawan moves across on off stump and then leaves the back of a length delivery that is outside his eyeline
"half an appeal for lbw, with Dhawan unsure if he wants to move forward or back. The inbetween length that Gamage accessed was with a delivery that is sliding down leg"
"cuts back in from outside off at 130 kph, Dhawan, in his effort to play late, is a touch too slow to make proper contact. Inside edge onto pad"
"laces it to the point boundary. That's Dhawan's shot. Anything short and wide outside off, he flays it away, and with this field, with five men behind him, poor bowling becomes easy pickings"
<b>beaten</b>! Pujara is finally drawn into poking at one he shouldn't. But it's not his fault. Lakmal suckers him into the mistake with a pitched up delivery on off stump that both swings and seams away
the length is right - full and asking for the drive - but the line goes a touch awry. Too wide for Pujara to show interest
"back of a length and outside off, Pujara picks up the line early and ignores it like a tweet older than 10 minutes"
another chance to show off his leave as Lakmal plies outside off with a short delivery
"shoves his bat skyward so that the away seamer, pitching on fourth stump looks harmless. Excellent judgment from Pujara"
"beautiful batting. Keeps on the back foot, waits for the ball to do its bit and then with the softest hands bunts it to the right of his feet. Lakmal needs to be fuller, he can be so dangerous when he's fuller"
now he goes over the wicket but the line is still on leg stump. Dhawan gets another easy single off the first ball of the over to square leg
"pushes at a delivery that is just short of a good length, and Pujara, looking not perfectly in control, finds the third man boundary. His feet are on leg stump. His bat is searching for the ball, which nips in off the deck rather late"
"<b>extra bounce</b>! Hits the deck outside off, and gets it to dart in off the seam. Pujara leaves well"
"fuller delivery outside off, Pujara gives it the respect he needs to so he can bully the bad balls later"
"covers the shortish delivery, coming in off the pitch, in front of off stump"
"fuller delivery on fourth stump, Pujara comes forward to block"
"<b>swing</b>, but it starts on leg stump and moves further down. Dhawan attempts the flick and can't reach the ball"
"<b>inside edge, fatal</b>! That's a rash shot from Dhawan, going for the on-the-up drive on a pitch doing a heck of a lot. Short front foot stride, but it doesn't go across towards the ball, instead it comes down the line so he has room for the shot and inadvertently creates the gap for Lakmal to burst through"
<b>sooooooo close</b>! Kohli is brought forward by a delivery that pitches on off stump and sashays past the outside edge. You sexy thing you.
leaves a fuller delivery outside off - those are the ones he cover drives in limited-overs pitches
good batting as he picks up the line of a shortish delivery to be outside off and then forgets about its very existence
"short delivery on middle, defends as close to his body as he could. <b>Four successive maidens from Lakmal, and he's got two wickets as well</b>"
"fuller delivery on off stump, actually, it curls in to get there. Pujara defends"
"<b>beaten</b> outside the off stump. And Pujara goes down to inspect the pitch that seems so set against him. Gamage is finally getting into some rhythm, getting the ball to move both ways. Here, he makes it hold its line and the batsman, playing the angle, is done"
that's how you drive a ball on this pitch. wait for the half-volley and don't hit it too hard that that a bat-pad gap is created. Mid-off can't get there
"<b>unplayable</b>! Fullish delivery, showing no sign that it would hit the pitch and move in at the batsman. Pujara is brought forward, plays inside the line and misses. Seems like the plan Australia adopted in Pune against India's spinners: don't mind being beaten by the awayswinger, but I want to be ready for the one that comes in at the stumps"
"shortish and outside off, no need to spend any energy on those"
"too short and Pujara is only too happy to keep playing these kinds of deliveries. He's camping on the back foot, desperate to have that little extra time to deal with the movement on offer."
"good length ball outside off, lets it go"
"<b>falls short of midwicket</b>. This pitch is not yet hard, and as a result, there is no pace on it. Kohli gets a ball on leg stump, his bread and butter, but he doesn't time the flick"
"good length, slight shape away from off stump. Defended solidly with soft hands"
"back of a length, shaping away and climbing in the corridor. Left alone"
"<b>beats the outside edge</b>. This zips away like a leg-break from back of a length, a watchful poke from Kohli. He's nowhere near"
"oh so good. Late swing away from off stump, good length. Very anxiously defended on the front foot. Loose hands"
"overpitched, marginally swinging in from outside off. There for the drive, but he won't take it"
"short and wide outside off this time, for the cut. Once again, bait not taken. Watches it float by"
"back of a length just outside off, thinks of punching off the back foot and withdraws at the last moment. It's not the quickest of pitches, he had time to adjust"
"another one that deviates a long way off the pitch. India won't mind this. It pitches in the corridor, forces him on the back foot and beats him by a long way"
"angles this in at off stump. Back of a length, spitting up a touch as he looks to defend on the front leg. Hits the bat hard and deflects onto his toe"
"full and swinging in from outside off, big stride to cover the off stump as he lets this go"
"<b>he looks plumb in front!</b> Nigel Llong has given it. Kohli reviews. Superb bowling from Lakmal. It's the same nagging off stump line, but this one comes into Kohli who's playing for an off stump line...review shows it is <b>umpire's call.</b> He's gone! Lakmal has been sensational today. Kohli, even if that had swung away like he expected it to, would have been playing a very meek,anxious shot. A poke, really. He might have reviewed that for line, but it's clipping leg. India won't lose the review, but they've lost their captain"
"good length, bends away late. Defended with a half-stride and hard hands"
"good length at middle stump, solidly behind this as he defends down the pitch"
"niiiiiiiice. Good length, in the corridor and lifting up dangerously. Rahane does his part well, left alone"
"<b>big, big appeal!</b> But it's turned down. Oh this looks so close. Another one that comes back in off the pitch. Not too different from the Kohli one, but this has done a little too much and is probably going down"
"<b>sixth maiden</b> in a row for Lakmal. He's been that good. Back of a length ball, cutting in from outside off. Nicely covered off stump as this is allowed to fly through to Dickwella"
short and wide outside off stump. He would have gone for a lot more runs than this on another day. Left alone for now
"short of a length, wide outside off stump. Left alone"
"back of a length, slight shape in. Left alone"
"bouncer, dug in too short. He ducks it comfortably"
"<b>oh dear!</b> Like a glitch in a video game, this tickles past off stump. Outrageous. Swings back in a looong way, full and at off stump. An inch fuller and it would be a yorker. Pujara is playing for that. Rapidly bringing the bat down. And then...and then, it cuts away. And misses off stump. He couldn't do that again"
"good length, wiggling about before it lands and then straight through to the keeper outside off. Left alone"
"good length, nice swerve away after starting at off. Rahane wants to press on the front foot and feel for this, but he resists. Let's it go"
"back of a length, swinging away from outside off. Left alone"
"the perfect line. Starts just outside off, shapes away from the corridor. Left alone on the back foot"
"back of a length outside off, a bit of climb this time, not a lot of movement. Left alone"
"back of a length outside off, left alone as it shapes away"
"<b>nearly.</b> Nearly gives it away, Rahane. This one is bowled a tad wide of the crease and slants in at the corridor on a good length. He's stuck in his stride and fishing away from the body for the angle. Realises late that it was wide enough to leave. It's a whole lot of nothing in the end. Narrowly misses the outside edge"
"good length outside off stump, left alone. No movement"
"fuller outside off, hangs and moves away slowly. Dead-batted down the pitch on the front foot"
"124kph, good length, aimed for the top of off. Gets some lift off the pitch. Watchfully defended off the high part of the bat"
"shot. Goes really full this time, and floated at off stump. No need for a big stride - puts in a small step and drives hard enough to beat mid-off who got a hand on it"
"122 kph, back of a length outside off. Left alone"
"full outside off stump again, nice and easy. No movement. Thumped past the bowler with no fuss. Well away from the fielder at mid-off too this time"
"good length, swinging away from outside off. Covers the off stump and lets it go"
"very anxious as he presses forward against this length ball in the corridor. It nips in and takes the inside edge, before getting lodged behind the flap of his right pad"
"good length, just outside off. Straightens after angling in. Let's it pass"
more assured in his leaving. This one bends away from a length outside off
"<b>runs.</b> Actual runs off the bat against Lakmal. Still no control from the batsman. He goes wide of the crease, angles it in at off stump and swings it away. No feet from Rahane as he jabs well in front of his body. It's a thick edge that runs past the second gully"
"back of a length at off stump, defended off the back foot"
"overpitched outside off stump, no movement. Tapped to short cover"
"length outside off stump, zips off the surface. But too wide for him to play at it"

"back of a length at off stump, defended into the floor off the back foot. Right under his eyes"
"back of a length, nips in to the corridor. Bunts it into the leg side off the back foot"
"well bowled. This is the Rahul Lite. Starts middle-and-off, back of a length. Swings away towards first slip and draws the edge - but it's a thick one, with the weight moving backwards and soft hands from Pujara. Into the gully region"
"length ball, slanted down leg side. Can't get bat on the flick"
"back of a length at off stump, defended off the back foot, down the pitch"
"good length, loops in at leg stump. Tapped to wide mid-on"
"<b>he's got him!</b> It was coming. Rahane has been trying hard to get some bat on it. And what better way to feed that temptation than a 125kph floater outside off? Length, no movement in the air and a slight natural variation off the pitch that's enough to beat his attempted cover drive on the up, wide outside off. Nowhere near the pitch and a thin edge behind"
"good length outside off, nips in from outside off. Stretches forward and plays inside the line. Beaten on the outside edge. It dies on the keeper and knocks him on the forearm"
"back of a length, wide outside off. No shot offered"

"full toss, floated outside off. Half-stride. Punch. Four through cover point"

"124kph, good length and slanted in at off stump. Defended on the front foot"

"good length at off stump, defended into the covers on the front foot"

"skids back in and it's a bat-pad situation. Right in front of middle stump as he looks to defend. Given not out by Wilson. <b>Sri Lanka review.</b> Early indication is that it is pad first...yep. <b>Pad first.</b> Ball tracking will decide this...it's taking a while to come. The ball pitched outside off and came in with the arm. Remember, he's bowling around the wicket to Jadeja. It didn't deviate a long way. Pitching outside off, <b>hitting in line</b>, <b>and it is hitting the wickets.</b> Halfway up leg stump. The decision will be overturned. The review works for Sri Lanka and Jadeja is gone. Mentioned earlier how Perera skids it off the surface and that's what has happened. Caught Jadeja halfway into his stride across. He was threatening the inside edge last over and he's beaten it this time."

"good length outside off, big stride forward to defend into the off side"
"<b>taken at first slip</b> as he attempts to play the paddle sweep. Given out and he's reviewed straightaway. He says it's forearm. Looked and sounded like a top edge. But early looks at the replay show it's forearm...but that is before Ultra Edge comes into the picture. <b>There's a spike.</b> It's bat, says the third umpire. He's looking to see if the catch was taken cleanly. No doubt there, it's a reverse cup  from Mathews at chest height. The decision will stand. India will lose that review. It wasn't a great shot to be honest. Not long after surviving that stumping"
"length ball outside off, skids past the outside edge as he looks to defend. Dickwella doesn't collect again. Looks like he has a nagging right thumb"

"<b>lands in between midwicket and deep midwicket</b> as he miscues an attempted slog. Length ball at middle stump, hit well enough to clear the fielder inside, poorly enough to tempt the fielder outside"
nurdles a full delivery angled into him to deep square leg. Either he spots the line early or was merrily walking across off stump just for fun
"can't stop him getting wickets. A rip-snorter of a delivery, pitching on a good length, holding its line, forcing Bhuvi to play, catching the edge and going through to the keeper. Well-deserved fourth for Lakmal, and he has a chance of adding one more to the bag"
"blocks a shortish delivery outside off, and with no one at cover, he gets off the mark"
clears the front leg and goes for a monster hit over midwicket. The ball laughs all the way through to the keeper's gloves. Still some seam movement off the pitch for Lakmal
"looks for his fifth with a yorker, but Shami is able to dig it out"
"hoicks a length ball outside off to a deepish mid-on. Herath nails the stumps, which offers an overthrow"
"fullish and outside off, Umesh squirts it through point to raise the 150."
"pulls a short ball outside off to deep midwicket. Good on Shami that, picks up the length so very early"
"<b>outside edge sails over first slip</b>. Kolkata roar for the local boy! Shami's taken a couple of five-fors for Bengal in the Ranji Trophy, and he's giving himself some cushion to take another, for India, at Eden"
"<b>top edge to the boundary right behind him</b>. Attempted bouncer from Gamage, and Shami, clearing the front leg, slogs it much to the delight of the Indians"
"full and outside off, drives to a deepish mid-off. Shami's come out to bat with his fast-bowler's brain on. Knows it will be the near-yorker after a few bouncers"
<b>stops on the pitch and bounces a fair bit more than Umesh expects</b>. Manages to blunt the good length ball down before it reaches the bowler on the full. Good instincts to use soft hands upon misbehaviour from the pitch
"slices a very full, rather slow, delivery outside off to deep extra cover"
"with no one at mid-on, Umesh pummels a length ball with a fairly straight bat. Must have got lessons from Pujara before coming in"
"taken down leg? But umpire Nigel Llong says it must be off the thigh pad. <b>Sri Lanka review</b>. This is a shortish delivery, cramping the right-hander for room. Umesh is shuffling across, trying to protect his body, and fends at the ball. Replays suggest Llong's call is right, it has flicked the thigh pad. <b>UltraEdge has no spike as ball passes bat</b>. No five-for, Lakmal. Yet"
"another short ball, digging it into the middle of the pitch, and it responds to all that effort. The ball climbs on Umesh, who does very well to shift his weight back and pat it down by his feet"
looks for the hook shot as Lakmal keeps banging it in. Umesh doesn't connect
"full and outside off, drives to cover"
"smashes it to the long-off boundary - with a long-off in! Chandimal has only a couple of yards to move to his right, but he can't reach there. Shami is roaaaaaring."
"it's the top-edge again, this time not entirely as well timed as the others in the previous Gamage over."
"taken at deep midwicket and India are all out for 172. Gamage's plan of bouncing Shami works, but it's also yielded several bonus runs from the lower order. Big pull shot. Big top edge. Safely taken by Shanaka running in"
"<b>big swing</b> into the right-hander. But Samarawickrama, by virtue of his still head, and last-minute pulling back of his front leg, has the room to bring down a reasonably full face to hit it through midwicket"
"leans into a cover drive - Mahela, are you there? - and it very nearly travels to the boundary. Umesh, one of the best athletes in this team puts in a dive to drag a ball in front of him back within play"
"<b>that's a great leave</b>, trusting the bounce to take the good length delivery over off stump even if it had been threatening it. As it is, the ball is allowed to travel just past it"
cuts back in off the seam and pins him on the back pad. Karunaratne is a touch tentative because this ball is pitched up. Comes down in a straight line - so gives the batsman no indication that it will cause mischief
"full, inviting, drivable, but Karunaratne knows not to do so against the new ball with three slips in"
"on the pads, hits the pads, Karunaratne finds a single to the right of the wicketkeeper"
"around the wicket and into the thigh pad, Karunaratne clips it sweetly to the square leg boundary. A strength for the left-hander. A mighty strength"
shuffles onto middle and off stump and turns a back of a length delivery towards vacant midwicket. Karunaratne seems to like the ball angled into him
gets forward and blocks a good length ball a shade outside off
"<b>flashes at a wide one</b> and is lucky he doesn't nick off. Beautiful delivery, full, swinging away, then seamer further away off the pitch."
"full and in line with the stumps, Samarawickrama drives stylishly to mid-on"
"<b>ripper</b>. He does bowl these on a regular basis because of an impeccable wrist position. The ball, invariably hits the deck with an upright seam, and on a grassy pitch, there is every opportunity for the ball to bite and dart wildly. This one pitches on middle and off and breaks away sharply, squaring Samarawickrama up"
"fuller delivery from around the wicket, Karunaratne defends into the covers"
too straight and it's whipped away to the square leg boundary like an errant mosquito disturbing him whilst he was reading a really good book
"punches a back of a length delivery to point - and even as he does so, he tries to check his shot because he feels the bat moving away from the body"
<b>outside edge</b> as he lunges forward to block a good length ball holding its line outside off
giant front foot stride to defend a good length ball outside off
"drives on the up - and the fact that he does so very easily suggests this pitch has eased out considerably. Rahane fell to such a ball, but here Samarawickrama plays the ball serenely to mid-off"
"fullish and on off stump, Karunaratne nudges it towards midwicket. Plays late, uses soft hands."
"'yeah yeah' he yells and pinches a single - gets overthrows to his name for being proactive. Ashwin at midwicket collects the ball well enough but sends a wayward throw, which even hits Samarawickrama"
"<b>pins him in front</b> but Karunaratne has asked for <b>a review</b>. Peach of a ball from Shami, pitching on a good length and darting back in off the seam. Ultra-Edge confirms there is no bat but HawkEye shows the ball is bouncing over middle stump. Did hit the batsman near or even above the knee-roll and umpire Wilson has to change his decision."
"good length ball on middle and off, turns it through mid-on for a single"
"good length ball outside off, blocks"
"gorgeous shot, and it demands that the fielder not stop it. Ashwin basically dives over the ball, and does so late as well. Good length, outside off, on the up drive, risky business, but it does look so good"
"shortish and outside off, Karunaratne taps it to point"
waits and waits until the good length ball is right under his eyes and then he presents the straight bat. Excellent concentration
"moves across as he tries to clip a shortish delivery off his pads, gets struck on the thigh"
"back of a length and outside off, Karunaratne ignores it"
"<b>plays no shot and he's sent packing lbw</b>. Karunaratne walks up to his partner and then goes for another <b>review</b>. Good length delivery, pitching outside off, so far that the batsman thinks he can safely leave it. The only problem is Bhuvi has bewitched it. The ball surges into the left-hander. strikes him on the knee-roll of his front foot and HawkEye says it will be hitting off stump"
"back of a length and outside off, defends through cover"
"goes for the bouncer, which Thirimanne ducks under and Saha does very well, moving to his right and timing his jump perfectly"
"<b>cuts in</b> shaaaarply off the seam again, and Thirimanne gets an inside edge to midwicket"
"another bouncer, no interest from the batsman. Kolkata roars as the hometown boy races in and then goes 'oooooh'"
"<b>that's risky</b>, playing the cover drive on the up against a fast bowler known to seam the ball both ways. Finds cover."
"back of a length and outside off, blocks into the covers"
"waits and waits for the shortish delivery to come within his reach and then gives it a proper punch, all aimed at beating point to his left, but he won't let it through"
"goes for the bouncer, but with the line being outside off, Samarawickrama has an early warning to leave it"
fishes at a good length ball outside off and it hurtles <b>past the outside edge</b> like they are mortal enemies
"goes wide of the crease for a short ball, desperate to have it climb on the batsman. But Samarawickrama gets up on his toes and crunches it in front of point. He's got plenty of shots, drives that look like Jayawardene possesses his body"
nicks off! That's the problem with his style of play on this type of wicket. The back foot punch to a shortish delivery that seams just enough to pass the middle and take the edge. Saha won't be fluffing those
"teaser outside off, Mathews thinks about a defensive shot, and then realises, 'wait, that isn't threatening my stumps.' Good leave in the end"
seems to start a touch wider of the crease and that slight change in angle makes Mathews - lead-footed as he is - push at a ball nipping away off the seam. Beats the batsman and ends a beautiful over beautifully
defends a good length ball outside off to cover
"<b>kicks up off a good length</b> and Thirimanne is lucky not to have his face rearranged! Hits the deck, nips away off the seam, takes the glove and crashes into his left bicep"
shuffles across to a back of a length delivery outside off and blocks
"seeing Thirimanne always moving across at his crease, Shami goes for the pitched-up delivery and tries to make it seam into the left-hander. Lbw in play, and so would a bat-pad catcher if he had been in place. In the end, the inside edge goes to midwicket"
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go"
"shortish and outside off, from wide of the crease, Thirimanne lets it go"
"bouncer outside off, Mathews, who normally doesn't move his feet early in his innings, is made to camp back as he ducks. Look out for that teaser outside off again"
"there it is. The fuller delivery, swinging away, searching furiously for the outside edge, as furiously as a mother does when her kids have homework to do and are nowhere to be found. Mathews, lead-footed, is beaten"
"this one swings in, then seams in, then cramps Mathews, who is originally looking to leave the ball. Late decision to play. Good decision to use softer hands"
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go"
"<b>huge appeal for lbw</b> but umpire Llong says not out. Kohli goes for the <B>review</b> this time. What a ball from Bhuvi though. It angles into the right-hander, hits the deck and has plenty of second thoughts. Dangerous second thoughts. Mathews is squared up as this one holds its line, beats the closed face of his bat as he looks to hit midwicket. Impact on the back leg, reasonably high, higher than the knee roll of a bent back knee. Umpire Llong right again."
"<B>beats the outside edge</b>. Bhuvi is making the ball do unreal things. From around the wicket, he pitches it on a good length in the corridor and then makes it nip away past the outside edge"
goes back in his crease to ride the bounce of a short ball. Single past gully
"back of a length and outside off, Thirimanne leaves so the ball targets Saha's face with a vengeance. Good job he has those big gloves"
blocks a good length ball cutting into the left-hander to mid-on
"lovely shot, through cover, all timing. This is the Pujara shot, waiting for the overpitched delivery and punching it so that he keeps perfect shape"
lets go a shortish delivery outside off
"plays late, pulls off the bottom hand and defuses all the threat in this back of a length delivery on off stump"
"walks out to Bhuvi, which is a decent tactic considering he's swinging it massively. Mathews defends"
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go"
"wide of the crease for a fullish delivery outside off, Mathews is nowhere near interested in that."
"stays still in front of his stumps, for as long as possible, so is in perfect position to flick a big inswinger to deep square leg"
"some swing into the right-hander, Mathews is very tentative, but credit to him, plays close to the body, soft hands, and it runs off the inside edge nearly to the boundary. Rohit Sharma, the sub, puts in a big dive and saves two runs"
"fuller delivery just outside off, blocks it, though he doesn't care to move his feet much"
starts with a short ball pitching outside leg and giving only Saha a proper workout.
"on the pads again, Thirimanne clips it, in the air for a distance, to long leg"
too wide to the right-hander too. Mathews is happy to leave those
"there it is. Pitches it right up on off stump, gets it to shape away in the air, and Mathews, hanging back, playing late and with soft hands, blocks"
reaches for the short ball outside off and blunts it down to backward point
"fuller delivery outside off, Mathews doesn't care for it. Spurned like it's committed a fashion faux pas"
"fuller delivery outside off, defends nice and close to his body"
"head over the ball, soft hands meeting it, and that's why the fuller delivery skews out towards point"
"full and looking for the top of off stump, Mathews defends"
"<b>pokes and misses outside off</b>. This is what India are trying to do against Mathews. The ball that holds its line, a bit wide of off stump. A batsman who doesn't move his feet too much will often end up reaching for the ball well away from his body"
"walks at the bowler, who then changes his length, pitches it shorter, makes it seam away and Mathews is beaten yet again. <b>Outstanding bowling</b>"
this time he keeps to his crease and blocks a good length ball on off stump
"shortish on leg stump, Thirimanne gets right behind it"
"slides a short delivery down leg, Thirimanne flicks and misses"
"shortish on off stump, defends stolidly"
"<b>past Saha's dive</b> and away to the fine leg boundary. Targets the left-hander with a short ball, and Thirimanne doesn't look too comfortable. Shuffling across, he fends at it, gets a glove and just enough to beat a very good keeper. <b>Fifty up for Sri Lanka</b>"
"shortish and outside off, from around the wicket, Thirimanne nudges it to square leg"
skiddy bowler gets the ball to keep a touch low on middle. Mathews hanging back works for him as he gets his bat down in time
"shortish and on off stump, tucks it towards midwicket, which is vacant"
gets forward and defends a fullish delivery a shade outside off
"half-volley, or almost, from Bhuvi and Thirimanne laces it through cover. That gap has been set for the good length ball that decks away past the middle to the edge. This is too full though"
"back over the wicket and he delivers an absolute corker! Perfect seam, angled to the slips, pitches outside leg, and bounces away past the shoulder of the bat to Saha. As good as anything Warnie's pulled"
"another full delivery pitching on leg stump and moving away. Bhuvi is trying to square the batsman up, get the leading edge. He foils those plans with a full face"
"shortish and on leg stump, nudges to midwicket"
"good length outside off, slight bend in, but nothing menacing. Left alone"
"good length at off stump, solidly behind to defend into the leg side"
"back of a length, angled wide outside off. Goes after it with a slash with no intent to keep it down. Gets a thick outside edge that flies to the backward point boundary"

"back of a length in the corridor, defended off the back foot"
"good length, swinging in at off stump. Looks to force this through the off side, but it ends up at mid-on as the swing catches the inside half of the bat"
length and in at middle stump. Flicked to square leg
"<b>dropped.</b> Dhawan puts down an easy one at first slip. Waist-height, to his right. The ball comes in at off stump and holds it's line slightly. Thirimanne playing inside the line offers a healthy edge and Dhawan covers the line, only to grass it"

<b>thick outside edge</b> as he drives on the up to a ball moving away. No feet once more and playing well in front of his body. It's short of point

"full and into the pads, no swing on this occasion. Clipped easily to the square leg boundary"
"good length outside off, hangs his bat out and gets the edge through the cordon, between second slip and gully"
"back of a length, angled in at off stump, and then cutting away sharply as he shapes to defend on the back foot. Shami is an unlucky man today. Bowled much better than the stats reflect"
"overpitched outside off, leans in to tap this to mid-off's left and steal a single"
"good length, shaping in at middle stump. He's in position to dab that through leg side but has to adjust as this straightens and squares him. Thick outside edge into the off side"
"good length, swinging away from outside off. Left alone"
"back of a length outside off, lots of width and not too much movement. The shot was on. Still not fully in control - slashed it aerially. But he gets it wide of point"
"back of a length, swinging away from off stump. Left alone"
overpitched on leg stump. Closes the face too early as he tries to flick this through midwicket. Rolls back at the bowler
"back of a length at leg stump, flicked to fine leg's right"
"back of a length in the corridor. Confused feet, but the body is behind line. Still manages only an inside edge as he tries to defend. Squeezes it into the leg side"

"back of a length in the corridor, defended to cover off the back foot"

"bouncer, dug in too short at off stump. Ducks under it"
"back of a length at leg stump, climbing up at the thigh guard. Once more he shuffles early to set up and then whips it to the fine leg boundary"
"back of a length and climbing in the corridor, left alone"
<b>in the air</b> but it falls short of midwicket. This comes in late off a length after starting at off stump. Thirmanne's front leg goes across more than forward and the head's falling into the off side. But he manages to survive after flicking

"back of a length, flat and in at off stump. Defended into the covers"
"good length, sliding in at off stump. Defended on the front foot"

"back of a length at leg stump, flicked to fine leg"
"full and in at off stump, defended on the front foot"
"<b>loose shot</b> with not too much time to go for Tea. Nearly edges this. Back of a length from around the wicket, climbing up sharply as he looks to jab this through cover off the back foot. Beaten"
"and again. Good bowling this. Goes wide of the crease, angles it towards the batsman and gets it to straighten. Induces that jab away from the body again but can't find the edge"
"starts with a yorker, a shade outside off, Mathews jams the straight bat down on it. The batsman's reaction suggests he didn't really sight the ball properly"
"pitched up on off stump, defends with the bottom hand off"
stays back to a shortish delivery and taps it to cover
"<b>beats him with a beauty</B>. Perfect seam, hits the deck, darts away, has Mathews squared up and then waves bye-bye at the outside edge on the way through to the keeper"
"shortish on off stump, and that length makes it easier for Mathews to cover the line"
"reads the line of the ball to be wide outside off and so, after shuffling across in case it seams in, he ignores it"
doesn't make the batsman play with his line being rather wide outside off
stands up tall against a back of a length delivery and punches it to cover
opens the face to glide a shortish delivery outside off behind point. That's <b>his first run in 16 balls</b> either side of the tea break
"no feet, but his hand-eye coordination is spot on. The four through cover looks just as good though. Sweet timing, against a bit of a half-volley that is asking to be hit."
defends a slightly shortish delivery on middle with soft hands
firmly behind a back of a length ball outside off
shuffles across to protect his off stump and then makes a rather late decision to leave. A good decision too. He has no choice but to take that call as late as possible against a bowler from around the wicket
"<b>his first Test fifty since August 2015</b>. It comes off a favourite shot - the cut over point. Standing ovation from the current captain in the dressing room, and a hug from his former captain out in the middle"
"brilliant pull, and he has read the length so early and the shot goes well in front of midwicket even. Lollipop short ball from Shami"
"shortish and outside off, pushes it to the left of mid-off"
"<b>what happened there?</b>. Everything looks hunky dory for as long as the ball takes to pass the batsman - a leave considering the line is outside off. But then as it goes through to the wicketkeeper, barely a foot in front, it wobbles away from Saha's gloves."
"back of a length and just outside off, defends"
"back of a length and outside off, a squared up Mathews pats it to the right of cover. Even after two unofficial warnings, Mathews runs right down the pitch. And he's been given <b>an official warning</b> from Llong. One more of those and India get five free runs"
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go"
"fuller and outside off, Thirimanne, for once, reaches away from his body, looking to square drive on the up. Outside edge to third man"
"sweet timing on the flick, and if not for Shami's boot that would have been a four through square leg. A touch straight - which isn't bad, makes the batsman play on a tough pitch - but it's short though and that allows Mathews an easy put-away"
"shortish and sliding down leg. Thirimanne looks for the leg glance, but doesn't find it"
bangs it in short - way short - and way outside off. Thirimanne is about as likely to play that as he is to break into song.
"back of a length and outside off, no shot"
"<b>absolute corker</b>! He draws Mathews into a drive, the length a little fuller, the line close enough to off stump. The batsman throws his hands at it and a bit of seam movement away beats him"
hangs back - is allowed to considering the length is short again - and Mathews blocks easily
"allows the full delivery to come to him, and then, with soft hands, he flicks to mid-on, the wrists working overtime to keep the ball down"
"<b>no third slip</b>! The partnership has gone past 100 and Kohli as a result has gone defensive. Only two slips and a gully. Shami delivers a peach again. Back of a length. Off stump. Holds its line. Squares up Mathews. A genuine edge, which would have gone about chest high to third slip races away to the third man boundary"
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
"bouncer, loads of effort from Umesh, but it is all in vain as Thirimanne spots it early and ducks"
"<b>taken low to the left of second slip</B> and Kohli, after taking the catch, vents by chucking the ball at the turf. Beautiful bowling from Umesh, running in hard, digging the ball in short and getting it to straighten. The angle from around the wicket is to make sure the left-hander feels like he needs to play at these. Works a trick"
"back of a length on off stump, Chandimal defends"
digs it in - but makes sure it is on middle - Chandimal is up on his toes to get on top of the ball and defuse it on the leg side
"brutal pull, past the left of midwicket. <b>Fifty for Mathews on his comeback</b>. The set batsman can see Umesh is set on bowling short. And his game revolves around staying as deep in his crease as possible. He's not going to miss out on a back-foot swat"
"shortish on off stump, defends"
"pitches it right up on off stump, Chandimal needs to play and he does well. Soft hands, straight bat."
in line with fourth or fifth stump and Chandimal is forced to block again.
"<b>leaves alone a nip-backer</b>, which thuds into Chandimal's thigh. Too high to think about an lbw appeal"
"goes wide of the crease to put the batsman in trouble against a ball that holds its line outside off. Chandimal, badly squared up, is still able to defend it"
"fuller delivery outside off, steps forward to drive sweetly to cover"
"<s>great leave</s>? a great ball actually! Eden roars as Shami pitches a good length ball in the off stump corridor. It kicks up like the pitch is suddenly a trampoline and Chandimal shapes to play it, is playing it and the pull back comes after the ball passes the edge"
"good length and outside off, Mathews enjoys the sighter"
"shortish and outside off, Mathews blunts it"
"full and outside off, drives to mid-off"
"teaser, very wide outside off, Mathews does go after it, with his feet firmly back, and on leg stump. Goes off the inside edge back down to the bowler"
"very very tame! Mathews walks off after giving catching practice to short cover. He throws his head back and yells 'Noooo'. He knows as the team's most experienced batsman he can't be making such silly mistakes. A drive on the up to a good length ball with Rahul, the close(ish)-in fielder, staring him in the face. That's a rookie mistake"
shortish and outside off from around the wicket. Dickwella sticks his bat up in the air
"very full and outside off, blocks"
<b>beaten</b>. This is a 40-over ball. And Shami is making it hoop around like its been black magicked. Full. A shade outside off. Luring the batsman into an airy drive. Too good
"now the in-dipper, looking for middle and off stump. Chandimal has to play close to his body, has to give it respect"
"probes away in the off stump corridor, Chandimal, shuffling across, lets it go"
"and the bouncer, just to show Chandimal he can do that too. The batsman does well to leave it"
"<b>cuts him in half</b>! Shami is on faaaiiiiaaah. Pitches it only a shade outside off, but its an in-between length. Chandimal doesn't know what he should do. He eventually comes forward, but by then it is too late. The ball has zipped between his inside edge and gone through to the wicketkeeper"
happy hooker has to go! But he doesn't want to. <b>He's reviewing</b> and Dickwella will get to stay. That's only because he's been beaten for pace and the ball pings off his right shoulder and settles in Saha's gloves.
"shortish and outside off, punches it through point"
"that's a poor shot. India are bowling beauties every over. As an opposition captain, you can't be giving them such chances. Big booming cover drive on the up - the kind you can get away with on a flat pitch. But here, you cannot indulge."
"back of a length and outside off, leaves it alone, as he should"
"goes wide of the crease for a back of a length ball on off stump. Chandimal nudges it towards square leg. Pujara does well to move to his right but he can't hit the target, which is basically only one stump"
"shortish delivery on middle and leg. Dickwella shuffles across, attempts a flick, but wears it on the thigh pad"
"back of a length and outside off, Dickwella squirts an inside edge behind square leg"
"walks at the bowler - this seems to be a plan against Bhuvneshwar, who upsets it by pulling his length back and getting the ball to dart past the outside edge. Seam movement still on offer"
"drawn into playing away from his body again - and it's only a defensive shot. The best he will get off that is a single. The worst, which is far more likely - a nick to the cordon"
"back of a length and outside off, Chandimal, having moved across, leaves"
"<b>maaaaaassive inswing</b>. Starts way outside off but then as if its been attracted by a ball-magnet placed at the base of off stump, it surges into the right-hander. Chandimal pulls his front leg back so he can present a straight bat to it. #(Bhu)vicious"
"fuller delivery outside off, pushes through cover"
"full and outside off, defends. Umesh into his seventh over"
"on the pads and Chandimal isn't able to get it away - finds Pujara in front of square leg. That's a good man to have, helping India bowl straight"
works it off his pads to long leg
"shortish and outside off, pats it to cover"
gets outside the line of a short ball on middle and the leg glance fetches a boundary. Sri Lanka nearing 150.
"<b>are India getting the ball to reverse</b>? There is massive swing into the left-hander, so much that a ball ripe to be cover driven skews off the inside edge to deep square leg. Dickwella does all he needs to as well, wait for the ball and only punch it so that he isn't playing a shot away from his body. Yet..."
"too short, which allows Chandimal the opportunity to ride the bounce and glide the ball to point"
he manages to time a ball he isn't really keen on playing. Single past the right of point
"he comes down the track again, thinking that's the only way to negate Bhuvi's swing. Instead, he's beaten again. That's because Bhuvi spots that early movement, shortens his length, and the pitch does the rest"
"goes wide of the crease for a full delivery on off stump, Chandimal blocks"
"good length, outside off, no shot"
"<b>nip off the deck</b>, and it happens so late, and the ball zips by so quickly, that Chandimal is made to look like a tailender. Back of a length, a shade outside off, and because of that he isn't clear whether he needs to play it or not. At the very last second, when it hurtles in at him, he is forced into a shot and is beaten on the inside edge"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"good length, angled in at the corridor. Leans in and punches to extra cover"
"back of a length outside off, gets behind the line and chops it to deep point's left"
<b>beauty.</b> Full inswinger outside off. Leans into this nicely and gets the weight through his hands as he creams the drive wide of mid-off
nearly chips one to midwicket. Back of a length delivery sits in the pitch a tad as he looks to whip this. On the bounce to midwicket
"full toss, drifts away from outside off. Taps it into the covers wathcfully"
"back of a length, angled in at off stump. Chandimal stays put this time and watches it onto the pad as he swivels to flick past square leg"
"full outside off. Stays put once more and leans in beautifully...then overcompensates by setting off for a single when the ball is rolling straight to Jadeja at mid-off. Has to dive in the end. And he's safe because Jadeja misses...and it goes through midwicket for four overthrows. Holding his hip as he gets back up. Risky run and, honestly, indicative of Chandimal's innings so far. Very anxious"
"beauty. Good length, swinging away from the corridor. No feet, only hands. No connection either"
"length at off stump, defended into the covers"
"back of a length, shaping away from the corridor. Leaves it alone without covering off stump"
brings it back in from outside off now. Dickwella reacts quickly to punch it into the covers
"swings it away, but it starts way outside off. Chandimal stays in his crease and lets it pass"
"nicely bowled. 138 kph, good length and hooping away from the corridor. No stride from Chandimal. Defends slightly away from the body"
"back of a length outside off, swinging away, but once again too wide to play. Left alone"
<b>brings it back in</b> from a length at off stump. Chandimal shovels it wide of mid-on from under his eyes
short ball from around the wicket. No room for the hook. But he goes for it anyway and drags it off the top edge to fine leg's right
"back of a length on the pads, nudged to fine leg"
"back of a length, swinging away from outside off. Shuffles to cover his stumps and lets it go"
"good length, swinging away outside off. Chandimal's front leg is still moving as he chases this with his hands. Beaten on the outside edge"
"there he goes again. Chandimal walked at the ball a lot last evening. First instance now. Wants to cover for the swing, but he's not to the pitch. It swings away from the corridor and beats the outside edge"
"length outside off, swinging away from outside off. Left alone"
"back of a length outside off, an emphatic leave"
full and swinging away a touch from off stump. Pushed to mid-off with soft hands
"back of a length outside off, 139kph, zips through as he lets it go. Saha surprised. collects it in front of his face"
the trademark pick up <b>and the scores are level.</b> Length ball fired into his pads. He stands tall with the front leg into the off side and chips it to the square leg boundary
"length and wide outside off. Looks for a big square drive away from his body and is beaten. There was a sound, which made Kohli appeal. Not out said the umpire. No one else was interested. Shami shakes his head"
"length outside off, defended into the off side"
"back of a length, lifting across the off stump. A half-hearted attempt to ramp it over slip. Nowhere near that, the batsman"
"short ball, angled away from off stump. This time time he gets on top of the bounce and bunts it to deep square"
"full at off stump, pushed past the bowler to mid-off, from the crease"
"back of a length outside off, and hardly any movement. Allows Dickwella to follow the ball with his hands and stab this to deep point's left"
back of a length outside off. Once more he leans into it with minimal feet and punches it past cover
"good length, shaping away from the corridor. Looks like reverse swing. Dickwella pushes in front of his body and gets a thick outside edge that runs past gully and to deep point's right this time. Umesh Yadav there, sprints and gets down just in time"
"length and moving across off stump, defended into the off side"
length at off stump. It's coming off a touch slow after pitching. Dickwella stays in the crease and pokes it back at the bowler
"good length in the corridor, solidly behind it to defend on the front foot"
"back of a length, coming in at off stump. Nips away and sits in the pitch a bit as he closes the face early on this. Lobs back at the bowler, but no danger"
"sweeeeeet. Full ball, swinging away from off stump. He stands his ground and uses soft hands to flick it past mid-on. All balance"
"back of a length outside off, watchfully let go"
"short and wide outside off, left alone"
"back of a length, swinging away from off stump. Left alone"
"<b>what a shot!</b> This is full and swinging away from off stump. Once more, there's no zip off the pitch. Is it starting to slow? Doesn't matter to this guy. Gets his hands under this and defies everything to scoop it over mid-on"
"back of a length at middle stump, closes the face to push this towards mid-on with soft hands"
oh glorious. Some classy shots in the last six balls. This is full and swinging away outside off. He leans into it and caresses it past mid-off
"back of a length, nipping back in from the corridor this time. Chandimal doesn't pick that. Feeble push away from the body but, to his credit, with soft hands. Thick edge rolls past gully"
good length in the corridor. Angles in and holds it's shape. Chandimal squared up. Forces it into the covers
"good length outside off, big stride to defend into the covers"
"full outside off, no feet. Tapped back down the pitch"
good length outside off. Pushes at it outside off. Beaten on the outside edge. That straightened after coming in
"shot. Short and wide from Shami, with no movement. He shuffles to reach at this and spanks it off the middle to the point boundary"
"well bowled. Back of a length in the corridor, nips back in and climbs sharply as he feels for it. He plays inside the line and is beaten"
"<b>straight to second slip.</b> The bounce again, from Shami. The ball swings inside, lands on the seam in the corridor and lifts off to take the outside edge as he pokes inside the line of this. Flies through quick at Kohli who is nicely balanced and snags this with the reverse cup"
full and wobbling in the corridor. No feet as he looks to drive. Trickles to point off the outer half of the bat
"back of a length, moving away outside off. Poked through the covers, to deep point's right"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"<b>doesn't pick the inswinger</b> and shoulders arms to one that hits him on the back flap in front of middle stump. Given out by the umpire. He reviews straight away...<b>it won't work.</b> He's out. He's leaping up as he's about to leave this, but it's clipping the middle stump according to the tracker. Umpire's call. Sri Lanka won't lose the review, but they lose the wicket. Bhuvneshwar took the last ball away from the same spot. Masterful"
"it is an inswinger. Length and hooping in from outside off. But Perera puts in a big stride to defend outside off. He's struck on the pad and maybe that's hitting off, but he's outside the line"
"length outside off, left alone"
another inswinger. This starts full at middle and slams into the pad as he looks to flick
"<b>climbs</b> past the outside edge. Shami is getting some serious jump from a length. This one is outside off and draws Chamdinal forward, only to send him back as it climbs"
"<b>has he edged it?</b> Yes he has! There were four, maybe five, overs of superb batting from Sri Lanka. Now, it's the bowlers' turn. Stunning period of bowling. Caused all sorts of trouble to Chandimal, Shami, and then he floats up an outswinger in the corridor. Not a confident shot this time from the visting captain. Half stride and then a jab away from the body. A thin edge, taken easily behind the stumps"
"<b>zips over off stump.</b> Herath's feet are stuck. Back of a length ball, angling away, then cutting back in to beat him"
the bouncer now. No feet from Herath again as he looks to hook this. Nowhere near getting bat on it
"oh wow, Shami is on fire right now. All the speculation of the pitch possibly slowing down is looking silly now. This one darts back from a length and is headed for off stump. Herath is puzzled and brings the bat down. The ball hits it too, but I don't think he knew much about that"
"full at middle stump. Looks to flick, gets a leading edge that rolls past mid-off"
"good length, angles in at off stump, then it swings away. Past the outside edge"
"oh good shot. Bhuvneshwar swings it in from a similar spot. Length and at off stump. Herath picks the angle and shovels aerially through midwicket, on the up"
"good length, swinging away from off stump and shooting upwards off the pitch again. Beats the outside edge"
"ah. All sorts of contorted, is Rangaiyya. This is an outswinger, in the corridor at a length. He swivels - in the stiff manner only he can - and flicks his wrists fast with the bat almost turning in fine leg's direction. The ball, about three yards in the other direction as this happens"
"length at the pads, clipped to deep square leg"
"back of a length, swinging in from wide outside off. He crouches to try and slash through point but this shoots through from under the bat"

back of a length just outside off. Pokes away from the body for the outswinger and gets beaten on the inside edge
"good length, in the corridor. Covers the off stump and lets it go"
<b>nips it back in and catches him in front of off stump.</b> This looks plumb. It's given. He won't even review at first. Starts to walk before turning around and reviewing. It's an indipper that strikes him in front of off stump on the back pad...<B>and the change of mind saves him!</b> This has hit him just outside off stump. He survives. Nigel Llong the umpire.

bouncer from around the wicket. Too short. Climbs well above the batsman
"well played and sensational work at the boundary from Ravindra Jadeja! What a fielder this guy. This is a short ball that Herath swivels and pulls stylishly towards the midwicket boundary, but little does he know that he's going to have to struggle for the second run. It's bouncing away from Jadeja who's running to his right from deep square. Leaps to to his right and stops it.

Except the freakish one, like the ball holding its line and soaring off the shoulder of the bat to gully. The third umpire is brought in to check whether Dilruwan has taken it cleanly. And replays suggest he has. Great work, running forwards, diving headlong at the ball, as if he was diving off a springboard into a swimming pool"

"another rising delivery, which pitches on off stump and holds its line. Rahane has to get up on his toes to blunt it"
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go"
"<b>gives it lbw</b> but Rahane has reviewed. Brilliant bowling from Lakmal. Pitches it up, gets it to snake in off the pitch and the new batsman, stuck on the crease, is playing all around it. <b>No bat</b> confirms Ultra-Edge. And ball-tracking suggests this would clip the leg bail. Umpire Wilson's call is upheld, even with Rahane up on his toes and the impact above his knee roll"

"<b>extra bounce</b>! Jadeja is furious to go that way, done in by the pitch. He responds to the length of the ball, shortish, by going back, and the line, on off stump, to play a defensive push towards cover. The only problem is it rears up shaaaaarply.

"through the gate! A hint of movement, off a sizeable crack, to dance past the inside edge and clatter into the stumps. Ashwin's habit of driving balls on the up topples him again and its excellent bowling from the allrounder - pitching it up and outside off - to bring that weakness into play"

"watches this length ball slide through to the keeper, kept a touch low as well"
"got him! Saha has driven this on the up to cover. This when the need of the hour was to bat for time. Good, low catch by Sadeera. The ball bobbled from his right hand onto the left as he bent forward to take it. As for the shot selection, well, you've to question the timing. This was by no means a half-volley, and driving on the up on a surface where there's some nibble away caused his downfall. <b> India are by no means safe just yet </b>"

"pokes and misses, This full delivery nipped away off he seam as Bhuvi prodded forward half-heartedly"
"much fuller and just outside off, driven straight to cover"
thick edge to the third man boundary. Lakmal shouldn't complain. Just short of length but this one swerves away just a wee bit to square Kohli up as he pushes away from the body. The good thing from Kohli's point of view is he didn't jab at it
"and again, but this time there's third man. Kohli is well forward as he opens the bat face to steer this down. Once again, played it with soft hands"
"back of length on off stump, defended solidly to cover"
"beauty. Angles in a length ball that pitches outside off and holds its line, Bhuvi plays inside the line of the ball as it whizzes through"

this time he's right behind the line of this full-length delivery as he keeps it out
"gorgeous! By no means a half-volley this but that stride forward does the trick for Kohli as he transfers his weight forward to lean into the drive and essay a classic. Terrific balance, head right on top of the ball"

"full and shaping away from outside off, Kohli watches this through to the keeper"

gentle little push into the gap at short cover for a quick single
"nips back in from length outside off, Kohli lets it go"
juicy half-volley and Kohli plays a stunning square drive. The intent was the key there. There was width and he opened the bat face at the last moment to hit it to the left of cover. So good to watch
"after bowling full and wide, Lakmal cleverly floats this back in full from wide of the crease. This time Kohli looks to flick and has been saved by <b> the thinnest of inside edges. </b> Umpire Joel Wilson reverses his decision. Relief in the Indian camp, Eden Gardens roars. Kohli spontaneously went up for the review. Nothing else would've saved him there, but he looked confident."
"once again, nice and full outside off, driven to sweeper cover. Gamage fires a poor throw to the keeper on the half-volley and they take an extra run off the overthrow as the midwicket fielder runs around to cover that"
"how much would you pay to watch shots like those? Wow, that is a scorcher. Full and just outside off, there's a hint of movement away as well but Kohli shows the full face of the bat and brings his wrists into play to gently ease this wide of the stumps rather than hitting it straight. Flew off the face of the bat. Joel Wilson may have nearly tripped over as he tried to avoid that"

looks to belt this through cover but gets a thick inside edge onto the pad as the ball rolls to the leg side
"wow, this is magnificent. The bottom-handed whip that VVS Laxman would be proud of. Most batsmen would look to drive this through cover but Kohli gets forward and across just a bit as he flicks this with an air of nonchalance through midwicket"
"races to the fine leg boundary. Plenty of deviation as this short ball angled in, Kohli looked to pull but missed it altogether. Dickwella can't stop it despite a full-length dive. Runs bleeding and India are motoring along here suddenly, with Kohli racing towards his century"
"nearly chopped it back onto the stumps. Bhuvi looks to get on top of the bounce and defend but the ball just bounced over. He was looking to take a single, perhaps because he wasn't sure where the ball went"
caught on the hop as he defends this attempted bouncer towards his ribcage
"wow, a backfoot punch right out of the top drawer. Nice, high elbow as he played that. Picked the length early, transferred the weight back and laced it away."

"looks to mow this over cow corner, blind swing at that incoming length ball. Beaten"
"clever bowling this. Bangs a short ball but this is well directed, towards Bhuvi's ribcage. The ball skids on so he's completely into a tangle and eventually fends to Dilruwan at gully. He was looking to flat-bat this over the bowler's head, perhaps gave away his intention too early"

"skids back in to deflect off a thin inside edge off the thigh pad towards backward point. The fielder in the deep had a lot of running in to catch up, by which time he was back for the second"

"chops this into the off side, wide of the keeper, as they scamper a single"

Flat hit, but wow, that just flew off the blade. The emotions were in check for a split-second or two, but then came the roar. How he's accelerated since Saha's dismissal."
"short of length outside off, Samarawickrama gets on top of the bounce and defends"

"solidly defends this length ball outside off, not much deviation off the pitch this time"
nicely forward as he defends this length ball into the off side.
"big appeal for lbw, or was it for caught behind? Nothing on it. Cut Sadeera into half as this one nipped in to take the flap of the pad on the way through to Saha"

gets off his toes to block a shortish delivery on and around off stump
"<b>taken at gully</B>! Rahane's the man. And Sri Lanka lose another batsman to ball he needn't have played. Credit though to the bowler who goes around the wicket, creating an angle into the left-hander and making him feel as if he needs to present bat to the good length ball. All it needs to do then is hold its line a little bit - and considering it is new and it has been sent down by the masterful Bhuvi, that's a given"

"a straight bat face, a sound decision to play late and close to the body. Mathews absorbing all the pressure. But Umesh needs to pitch it up more"
"that's good. If he wants to go short, he should bang it in like that. The line is on off stump and it forces Mathews to drop his wrist and fold his torso back away from the line"
"short, wide, cracked in front of point. He does have a habit of giving boundary balls. The count is at two now"
"<b>huge appeal for lbw</b> as Umesh skids off the pitch and pins Mathews on the knee roll. Umpire Llong says no and so Kohli <b>reviews</b>. This is Umesh's specialty when he hits a fuller length.

another bouncer - climbing past the left shoulder and Dickwella just about gets out of the way.
"short and down leg, Dickwella doesn't need to spend too much energy with that"
"goes back to block a short delivery on off stump. And then practices a pull shot, as Kohli did earlier in the day"
"lovely work. He drops the ball in front of cover, and even with Jadeja being so swift, he can't get to it in time to stop the quick single"
"fuller delivery outside off takes the edge through to the third man boundary. Soft hands, angled bat and just enough seam movement away combine to spirit the ball past a packed cordon"
"over long leg! Goes after the short ball, climbing up on his throat, but the good thing Dickwella does is keep his eyes on it, swivels on his back foot and sends it soaring"
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
"what the weird shots! He's basically skipped across outside off, and ends up behind the stumps when he scoops the ball away over the backward square leg boundary. And it appears Dickwella plays it only after he noted there were three fielders behind square on the leg side. He knows that will mean a no-ball - which began on a good length outside off and ended up in exactly the strangest place possible"
"full and outside off, defends"
"good length ball on middle and leg, defends"
"short ball on middle, nudges it through midwicket"
"bouncer on middle and leg, Chandimal gets under it"

"full and curling into middle and leg. Chandimal, by virtue of staying still and playing late, flicks the ball handsomely through midwicket"
"beautiful work from Chandimal, shuffling across to clip a short ball on middle and leg to the long leg boundary. Shami, the fielder, tries to put a boot on the ball but isn't able to."
defends a shortish delivery to the right of gully.
"fullish on middle and leg, works it to long leg"
turns a fullish delivery to the right of midwicket.
"offcutter, he picks it early and blocks it calmly. Dickwella's fun even when he plays the most orthodox of shots"
he has three slips and a gully to watch out for but he still guides the short ball to the third man boundary like a boss. Extra bounce and lack of room be damned
"fuller delivery outside off, lets it go"
whips a short ball from around the wicket through to deep midwicket
"juicy full toss outside off, blocks it. If ever there was an indication that Sri Lanka aren't looking for runs..."
"back of a length on off stump, chops down on it with an angled face"
"fullish and outside off from around the wicket, Dickwella drives to cover"
drags a short ball from outside off to deep square leg with a well-controlled pull
"<B>peach of a ball</b>! The seam comes down, pointing into the batsman, but it's wobbling as well. So when it hits the deck, it ends up holding its line and beaten Chandimal's block off the front foot"
"he's forced into a shot by the late movement into the right-hander. Back of a length, snarling into him, and Chandimal slices it to the cordon"
"makes the ball deck away off the pitch this time and Chandimal's prod sends it past the three-man cordon. <b>Right, that's one hour done after tea.</b>"
"bouncer from around the wicket, Dickwella doesn't need to play at those"
<b>outside edge</b> which bounces short of first slip. But who cares about that. Shami walks right up to the batsman in his followthrough and gives the batsman a piece of his mind
"shortish on off stump, defends"
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go"
"lets go a short of a good length delivery outside off. Good judgment. The gamesmanship has not affected him. If anything, he's more focused"

"whippy drive through cover! He stands very still at the crease, allowing the tossed up delivery to come into his yard and then smashes it through the gap"
drives a tossed up delivery outside off to cover
"fuller delivery outside off, lets it go"
"The noise of bat hitting pad gets Shami excited and they go for the review. Regardless of the third umpire's decision, this is just fast bowling nirvana. A short ball angled into the right-hander hits the pitch and hustles through. Chandimal is originally doesn't want to play but is pressed to do so.<b>No bat</b> says Anil Chaudhary as it goes through to the wicketkeeper."
"good length outside off, turns it through midwicket"
"<b>through him</b>! Chandimal hangs back to a full delivery and is thrown off balance as he tries to negotiate it. A 144 kph corker that shapes in at the worst possible moment, and a panicking Chandimal indulges in a flick, desperate to make contact. He can't. The ball zips through bat and pad and crashes into the stumps, very much like how Rahul was cleaned up earlier in the day."
"great delivery first up. Full and attacking the stumps from wide of the crease, Shanaka is half forward as he keeps that out"
"gets this to veer in from wide of the crease again, solidly defended"
"floats this full outside off, left alone"
"plays with an angled bat, squirted to gully where Rahane pounces on the ball and stops it. Kohli slaps him a high five"
"late inward movement this time from off stump, bunted gently to the off side"
"from one angle it looks like the ball carried, but from another, you aren't quite sure. Thid umpire Anil Chaudhary deliberates long and hard before deciding there was no conclusive evidence to suggest that carried into Saha's gloves. <b> Umpire Nigel Llong's decision has been overturned. </b> Dickwella played outside the line as this full delivery veered in, got a thin inside edge through to Saha, who came up with an excellent effort."
this one swings back in to hit the pad but the impact was outside off.
sways out of the way of this short ball quite comfortably
"floats this full outside off, blocked"
hits him on the chest as he looks to sway out of the way of this short ball. Shami walks across to enquire if he's okay. Courageous from Shanaka. He'll have a bruise for sure. <b> Physio runs in. That is sure to annoy Kohli. </b> Three other substitutes come in.
"late inward movement from outside off, Shanaka blocks. That was darted in at 140kph"
"keeps out this length ball outside off, this one kept a touch low as well"
works this full delivery from middle and leg to short midwicket
"floats this full, late reverse back in, pushed to the off side"
"as far as decisions go, it can't get easier than this. The length ball came back in a long way to hit Dickwella in front of the stumps as he looked to shuffle across and work it to the leg side. Hawkeye says 'umpire's call' so he will have to make the long walk back."
"this ball jags back in a long way from outside off to hit Dilruwan on the back leg. He was also well forward. The question is if it did enough to miss the stumps, because even if it was just clipping, the decision will stay with the onfield umpire. Hawkeye shows that would've gone over. <b> Decision reversed  </b>"
"excellent bouncer, right into his body from wide of the crease, Dilruwan somehow manages to get out of the way"

this is a juicy half-volley and he's flicked this off the pads to the midwicket boundary.
"full and just outside off, he lets it go"
jaffa! Just held its line to beat the outside edge. This was floated full outside off from wide of the crease
firmly driven but Bhuvneshwar does well at extra cover to cut off what could've been four. <strong>Talk about saving 40 seconds</strong>
plays inside the line of this zippy length ball though to the keeper
"this is a ripper of a delivery. The leg stump talks a royal walk. Sri Lanka lose their seventh. The look of disbelief on their faces tell you a story. This is angled in full from wide of the crease, pitches and jags away just a wee bit to beat Dilruwan's tentative push to cannon into the top of off. As a captain, you can't ask for a better delivery than that from your fast bowler. Sensational"
bunts this full delivery into the off side.
"swung away late, quite a long way too, as Herath watches this angle though to the keeper"
right behind the line of this short of length ball as he defends
"just about manages to jam his bat down in time to keep out that fast and furious yorker that was headed to the base of middle stump. Woah, woah, woah. Why, sun? Why? Why couldn't you stay out for longer?"
"back of length on off stump, defended"
gets half forward and keeps out this incoming length ball without much hassle
late inswing but he somehow manages to defend it back down despite being overbalanced
