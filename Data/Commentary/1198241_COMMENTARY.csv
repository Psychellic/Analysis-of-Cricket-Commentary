"full and punched into the off side, Woakes wants one and then turns back....<b>has to dive for his crease as Yasir fires in a throw! </b>Would have been gone with a direct hit. Archer was halfway down as well, no idea what was going on with the calling"
87mph/139kph outside off and Woakes steers this through point in controlled fashion
"zipping through outside off stump, no stroke"
"...then follows up with the yorker, wide of off stump and Archer jams down on it, squirts a thick edge into the ground and through the slips for two!"
"pitched up, 87mph/139kph and Archer opens the face slightly as he reaches for it, steered towards gully"
"Naseem appeals for lbw as he brings this back in, think Archer got his bat down in time"
"floated up outside off, Woakes strokes it to mid-off"
"tighter line, defended propping forwards"
"big-turning legbreak, through to the keeper as Woakes stays back"
"<b>straight through 'im!</b> Quicker and skidding on as Woakes tries to swing to leg, instead gets his stumps rearranged! Don't think it was specifically a slider, but he pushed it through and bagged another. Four for Yasir and England are sinking into another post-prandial funk"
"round the wicket, posisbly a googly first up and Broad reaches out to defend... called for overstepping"
"flighted, dipping around off stump, Broad smothers it"
"tossed up into the rough outside off stump and Broad is forward, watches it well and blocks into the covers"
"over the wicket and slanted across, slightly short and Archer cuts, picks out backward point"
"speared down the leg side as Broad walks across, Rizwan earns his corn again, diving full length for the take"
"pitched up, 84mph/135kph and clipped towards mid-on, Broad wants one but is sent back"
"length on the pads and Broad weeches it fine, <b>picks up four</b>... Abbas can't get around to cut it off"
"<b>inside-edged past leg stump!</b> So close for Shaheen, who flings down a yorker that would have totalled middle and leg had Broad not got a streak of bat on it!"
"back of a length outside off, <b>Broad smears this clean over mid-off!</b> Ladies and gents, the time of the day for some no-nonsense tail-end biffing has arrived"
"flighted, defended coming across on off"
"shouts of 'catch!' as Archer goes inside edge, something of a hack but he clears the infield"
"Broad laps one behind square on the leg side, <b>Archer runs rather lackadaisically through the crease</b>... but he was just about home as Rizwan brokes the stumps"
"clears the front leg, Archer has a massive yahoo... <b>just beyond the reach of Babar at point!</b> Made a decent diving effort, going one-handed over his right shoulder, but couldn't get there!"
tossed up and tapped back on the stumps
"flighted from round the wicket, Broad sweeps hard, comes off short leg... 'catch!' is the cry once again, but the ball loops in front of midwicket"
"tossed up from over the wicket, Archer is into line"
"floated full around off stump, again he's forward and defends diligently"

"tossed up around off stump, smothered"
"gets a little straighter with his line, turns a smidge as Archer goes to close the face and gets a leading edge back towards the bowler"
"full toss, Archer belts it back into the stumps at the other end... <b>did Shadab gets a finger on it?</b> He did, but Broad had one and a half feet still grounded inside the crease"
floated full outside off and Archer prods it awa
"lots of side spin on this one, drifting and then ragging away into the gloves"
"flatter, spinning past the bat, big appeal from Pakistan... Illingworth not interested by Azhar <b>reviews</b>, looks to be a clear gap between bat and ball. Rizwan and Yasir barely appealed, but someone thought he had hit it. Technology quickly proves otherwise"
pushed through on the stumps and Archer nudges this away off his hip playing back
"lobbed up nice and slow, tickled down the ground to long-off"
"round the wicket, hurls hims through the crease and spins the ball in, Broad props forward to block"
"nicely bowled, dipping and straightening on off stump, Archer blocks"
"tossed up full on off, clipped down the ground to long-off"
"legbreak, turning back as Broad lunges out, bat next to pad and Shadab goes up... think he was probably outside the line"
"what's he done here?? <b>Caught off the glove trying to leave!</b> Shadab gets amongst 'em, drew Archer forward and although he had kept his bat safely tucked in, the extra Old Trafford bounce meant it just brushed the top hand on its way through! Archer looks quizzical, but then heads for the dressing room"
"drawn forward, and beaten on a loose drive as Jimmy chases the googly"
"scampers the single into the off-side, this will be tight if it hits... but the gather wasn't clean"
"big turn from outside off, thumps the knee-roll as Anderson leans forward"
<B> big spin again!</B> Anderson just about closes the gate in time as he leans forward to a ripper
"<B>reverse sweep!</B> Nicely nailed, Jimmy! Flicking the hands, panning it behind square through backward point. Lovely boshing"
spinning sharply down the leg side
"stabbing forward, the ball bobbles off the knee-roll and maybe some inside edge. Catch it is the cry, but it loops safe"
"poked to the leg side, another over endured"
"punched into the off side, the call is two, and a <strong>direct hit would have been out by a yard! </strong>Impressive pick-up and shy on the slide from Shadab. Sharp!"
straightens onto the front pad as Broad strides forward to block
"dipping into the toes, poked from deep in the crease into the covers"
"<B>an appeal for everything!</B> Huge turn and bite, the ball loops to slip, as Broad is turned into an S by the googly, but falls short. But they want the lbw! Thsi one is going to a <B>review</B>. There's a flat line on UltraEdge, so is this hitting? <B>Umpire's call!</B> A bail-trimmer. Broad survives!"
nudged to the on-side
"shuffling in the crease, nurdled to the leg side, there's a single on offer as Broad keeps the strike"
"<B>flogged over cow corner!</B> That's how Broad rolls these days! In his arc, and up it goes, high over the sweeper on the leg side"
"<B>another murderous mow, but this time it's a top-edge...</B> Shadab is underneath it... <B>and drops it!</B> Oh my, a sitter by his standards, and it bobbles to the rope too! Oops"
two more precious runs as Broad smears another square of the wicket
"a big wind-up, more turn from outside off, doesn't connect this time"
"propping onto the front foot, tucked to the on-side"
<strong>spins and keeps low!</strong> Yasir will store that one for the second innings. Broad fends it away on the back foot
"another reverse sweep, he does play it well, but can't beat the field this time"
"looped towards the blockhole, met on the full with a calm push to mid-off"
"another reverse sweep,<strong> and this time he doesn't play it so well!</strong> Misses as it bites on the line of middle and leg, and this is plumb! Up goes the finger, Anderson <strong>reviews </strong>as well he might... but that's smashing leg. England are all out!"
"good length outside off, a hint of shape across the left-hander, no stroke needed"
"<B>jaffa!</B> That's the area for Anderson! Curling wickedly from a tight leg-stump line, and exploding off the deck on off stump. Can't lay a bat on that"
"inswinger, but on the pads and nudged behind square"
"back and across, nudged down into the covers, back leg in front of off on impact"
"wider line, very wide in fact. Buttler scuttles across to gather"
"full and straight, hint of shape across the leftie, blocked firmly to complete the maiden"
"outside off, very full length, Abid pulls his bat inside the line and lets it go"

"probing fourth-stump line, full length, no stroke"
"wide of off stump once more, scuttles after pitching and <B>scoots through Buttler as well!</B> Yorked him on the second bounce... oops. And no-ball too. So much village for one delivery"
"tighter line, fuller length, jabbed to midwicket"
"prodded to the off-side, angling onto the front foot in solid defence"
"<B>fired down the leg side, and strangled!</B> That was a pretty rank ball, but it's done enough to dislodge the obdurate Masood for a duck! Just the slenderest feather as he closed the face on his hip, Buttler lobs the ball up in celebration, and now then, England have the wicket they needed!"
"outside off, shaping off the pitch, Abid keeps his bat inside the line and lets it go"
flicked off the space into space at midwicket
"zippy delivery from just back of a length, Abid plays inside the line"
"wrist behind the ball once more, and shaping off the pitch through to the keeper again"
"compact drive, onto the front foot, gathered at mid-off"
"back of a length again, Anderson is probably a yard short of snagging the edge in this spell so far. Abid plays inside the line again"
"aggressive full length from Broad, shaping into the pads. Broad has found the length that will threaten on this pitch scuffed to the leg side this time"
whisks the bat out of the way outside off stump
"<B>edged, but short of first slip!</B> Kisses the edge as Azhar leans forward to the angled full length, Root parries it on the half volley, and <B>he's leaving the field!</B> That's a worry for England... Stokes steps in as on-field captain. Looks like it thwacked his thumb"
"pressing onto the front foot once more, into the covers as Broad harasses the stumps"
"full again, floated right up to off stump, tucked to the on-side"
left alone with a stride down the pitch as Broad aims wider. Another maiden

"that's a better length, but a wide line as Abid keeps the bat inside the line"

"fuller and straighter, a hint of shape off the pitch, head over the ball in defence"
"outswinger, but on a wide line again, Easily left alone. Anderson's figures are pretty without being threatening"
"right up to the bat once more, Stabbed to gully, looking for the single but no way through there"
"<B>lovely delivery</B> Just back of a length, zipping this way and that, and beating the outside edge!"
"<B>fuller length, and even more threatening!</B> Broad's angle keeps that ball coming inexorably in towards the stumps, and he just about avoids nicking it"
"onto the front foot with more confidence this time, and stroked into the covers"
"outside off, and through to the keeper, fifth-stump line,lifting off the pitch"
"another lifter from back of a length, wide of off stump and left alone. Another maiden to keep the screw nice and tight"
"<B>flashed outside off, and through the cordon!</B> Very loose stroke, feet hanging outside leg, and that was in the air through gully!"
"outswing from Anderson, on a fuller length, that's a better area, and a better leave"
squeezed off the back foot to cover once more
"<B>edged and dropped!</B> Stokes, diving from second slip across first! Root, back on the pitch, was right behind that, but it's gone to ground! Anderson found that in-between length, a bit of kick on the outswinger, but the trap couldn't be closed!"
"good follow-up, he's half a yard fuller now, and causing indecision outside off"
"back of a length, a hooping outswinger, and<strong> that's a loose ball, emphatically put away!</strong> If Anderson wasn't already grumpy, he'll be positively livid now"
"outside off, through to the keeper without a stroke"
"<B>loose drive!</B> So full, outside off, luring the stroke, eluding the edge"
"full again, a squirted outside edge as Azhar swings the bat down late"
"closing the face as Broad attacks the pads. Worked to midwicket, and he's still not off his pair..."
"stump to stump, probing the top of off and drawing a neutral defensive prod"
"zipping through outside off, Broad keeps asking the question in the channel. Azhar turns his back as he leaves alone"

"another outswinger, intermediary length, poked with an open face to cover"
"<strong>nibble on a full length!</strong> That's better from Anderson, drawing a loose stab outside off, and just getting away with it"
"right up to the toes this time, giving the ball a chance to swing, and drawing a determined block to mid-on"
"full again, better at the back end of this over, pushed hard back to the bowler on the front foot"
"attacking the splice, but well enough repelled into the covers. That will be <B>tea</B>"
"good length around the line of off, Azhar is forward and drops it into the off side, won't chance one there"
"full and driven, <b>scooched past the dive of mid-off for four!</b> He was off and running regardless, but will feel all the better for picking up a boundary with a nicely timed punch, removing the spectre of the pair"
"pitched up, slightly wide and <b>Azhar skelps four more through cover point!</b> Gets forward and sends it rasping in front of square"

length ball steered down into the off side
"Broad plugs away around fourth stump, Azhar is into line once again"

shortish and jabbed down into the on side playing back
"length on off, Abid defends with a straight bat... and then decides he wants one after initially calling 'no!' Nearly a mix-up, Archer running across from mid-on with Azhar scurrying back to the non-striker's"
"fourth stump, tapped into the off side"
"punched on the up, to the right of Anderson at mid-off and he doesn't take it cleanly, allowing a couple"

"tight line, drifting in and defended from the crease"
"flighted, met with a front-foot block"
"spin and bounce, <b>did that brush the glove??</b> Flew up and to the right of Pope at short leg, too quickly to get a hand to"
"tries to sweep his way out of a hole... <b>but ends up digging himself into trouble!</b> Top-edged and pouched at deep square leg! Didn't take much to fluster Abid there, one ball spitting at him and he went for the aggressive option, only to miscue limply to the man set back. Buttery biscuit Bess does it for England"
"short ball, Azhar ducks... <b>gets a tickle on the bonce!</b> Half an appeal from behind the stumps, nowhere near the bat or gloves, though"
"<b>edged low through the cordon!</b> Stokes couldn't get there going to his left... Don't think it quite carried this time. Archer is then called for overstepping, so all a bit academic"

"tapped down into the covers, Azhar was all for coming... but Babar screamed 'No!'"
"edged to slip, <b>Stokes snaffles this one!</b> Woakes does it in his opening over, getting the big fish Babar. Shazam! Testing line, drew a loose push outside off, and Stokes went low to his left to scoop up the chance"
"pitched up around off stump, Shafiq is fully forward to bow his head over a defensive shot"
starts with a leg-side long hop that Azhar almost gets tangled up against trying to shovel away fine

"nibbling back at him, Azhar still a little crease-bound, gets a thick inside edge into his pads"
"<b>full, straight and blown away!</b> Ankle-bothering length, maybe a hint of reverse, Azhar was stepping across and closed off trying to work to leg, he won't bother to challenge the decision! Another big moment, as Woakes goes bam-bam"

"length, tricky nip-backer from Woakes, off the seam and rapping Shafiq a painful blow on the thigh as he comes forward"

"confidently forward, meeting the wide line outside off with bat and pad together"
"a touch fuller, a touch straighter, a similar result, a firm front-footed block"

"a swishing pull as Anderson pulls his length back, kept it down to deep midwicket"
worked off the back foot for another single
"<B>direct hit on the quick single!</B> Oh my, England fancy this, and little wonder! A superb pick-up-and-shy in the covers, a swoop from point by Sibley, who had to throw off balance, and nailed it! That is a huge moment for this match, as England were starting to drift beyond salvation! Shafiq is not in the frame"
"pushed right back onto the stumps, and blocked. Now then ..."

"fuller length, attacking the off peg. Pushed to midwicket. Another no-ball for Anderson! They are pouring in for him now..."
poked through gully! <strong>All the way to the rope!</strong> Not a bad ball from Anderson but it was well enough played with an angled bat and soft hands. And Pakistan's lead continues to stretch

"up on the toes, hauling a pull to the leg side, as Stokes bangs it in short"
"<B>whooshing into another pull!</B> Decent pace from Stokes in the mid-80s, hitting the deck and luring Shadab into an airy launch. Buttler gathers"

"on the legs, too short this time and safely nurdled around the corner"

"curling away on a fifth-stump line, a good tumbling take from Buttler diving across his slips"
"back of a length, and pushed down the track"
"back and across, and blocked back to the bowler"
"<B>vast appeal!</B> If there's no inside-edge, that's surely stone-dead! Full length, tail back into the pads, thumped on the knee-roll, umpire Illingworth says no ... <B>England review and that's smashing leg!</B> Wow, that's a mighty double-whammy for England, this game is shifting, ever so slightly, back into the balance!"
"wider line, biffed hard to extra cover, Yasir might have to throw the bat a bit now. Pakistan's tail gives Mullally, Tufnell and Giddins a run for their money"
"hopping back into the crease, and that's excellently picked off, through backward square. Stokes keeps mixing it up but this time Yasir is equal to it"
"banged in short, and a cramped pull through backward square. An over-step ruins the overall effect"
shoulders arms outside off stump
"good delivery, tighter line, threatening the edge, through to the keeper as Afridi just about keeps his bat inside the line"
"full again, attacking the pads but confidently blocked from deep in the crease"
"firm in defence, blocking an off-stump delivery from round the wicket to mid-on. Afridi has done his bit for now"
"bouncer, and Yasir gets inside the line to plop it very fine for four! He didn't know much about it, but he got enough bat on it!"
"attacking the toes, flicked airily behind square"
bending past the off stump from back of a length
"round the wicket, solid in defence on the back foot"
"wide enough to leave, so Afridi does just that. He's getting well into line when he needs to. Solid effort so far"

"round the wicket, on the back foot, dabbed to the on-side"
"pushed across the right-hander's bows, blocked down into the crease"
"squared up in defence, and <strong>nearly pops up a leading edge!</strong> Short leg was briefly excited"
"advancing to the pitch, doesn't get there, blocks"
"big swipe, not totally connected, mid-on gathers"
"back on the stumps, worked behind square. A maiden for Bess, if not the most probing of maidens"
"right back on the stumps in defence, shabash Afridi. Body behind the line as Stokes hits the deck"
"feet going nowhere, but again, the head is over the ball on impact as Afridi defends from the crease"
"<B>banged in short, and caught in a tangle!</B> Afridi tried to get out of harm's way, but he succeeded only in splicing a looping chance to gully!  Ben Stokes, what a monster!"
"over the wicket, fired down the leg side. Stokes is a bit miffed at the wasted effort"
"outside off, full length, but well left alone as Abbas stretches across his crease"
"very full, right up to the toes ... is that it as Abbas defends? It is indeed."
"pitched up on middle, which he calmly dinks through midwicket. Excellent. Effortless."
"there's the bouncer, but Yasir's been waiting for it. He'd been waiting for it alllllll night long. Whacks it <i>in front of square</i>, which says he picked it up very early, and there is so much power in the pull shot that it screams away to the boundary"
"<b>ingenious cricket</b>! Pakistan's spinners are a really clever lot. They usually know what a batsman is trying to do to them. Here, Yasir proves he knows everything the bowler is trying to do too, which is why he isn't flustered when a bouncer comes for him again. He watches the ball all the way, gets leg side of it and then caaaaaaaalmly upper cuts it for four."
"cramps him on the back foot in front of middle and leg, Yasir works it through midwicket"
"near yorker on middle, but Abbas is able to work it to square leg"
excellent defence to protect his off stump. Brave batting from Mo Abbas
"dismissive from Yasir. Fractionally short on off stump, Yasir sizes it up the angle has a <strong>mighty heave-ho</strong> and hits it away past the right of mid-on. Pakistan move past 150"
"on a length and slanting in at off, Yasir clears his front leg once again and aims to cart it over mid-off. Instead, he splices it in front of the fielder"
"clubbed away over midwicket. Back of a length and angling in, Yasir uses the angle, opens up his hips and <strong>utterly batters it over the leg side</strong>"
"back of a length and angling in at off stump, Yasir trades the slog for the defence now"
"edged and grabbed by Buttler. On a length and outside off, Yasir stays leg-side of the ball and simply throws his bat at it. Thickly edged to the keeper behind the stumps. Yasir's fun is over"
"belted over the bowler's head. Overpitched on middle, Naseem's turn to clear his front leg and tonk it straight down the ground like a boss"
"smote over mid-off. On a length and outside off, Abbas aims a leg-side slog and ends up slicing it over the off-side infield"
"on a length and angling in at off, tip and run to the right of mid-on"
"bumper from Archer, the tail-ender aims a hook,then ducks, the ball balloons off he handle over the keeper's head. Given as leg byes"
"<strong>Archer knocks 'em over</strong>. Full, straight, simple. Naseem swings for the fences, and only connects with a whole lot of thin air. Archer nails the middle stump"

"back of a length and slanting in at off, Burns gets right behind the line in defence"

"pitched up and outside off, scooped through the gap at the covers"

"<strong>good ball from Abbas</strong>. On a length, kicks up and seams away, Sibley closes the bat-face at the last moment and pokes it out to the off side"
"much fuller, angling in, then straightening away late, teasing Sibley's outside edge. The batsman, too, did well not to throw his hands at the ball, instead he played with soft hands inside the line"
"wide of the crease, angling in, defensively nudged to the leg side"
"short and banged down the leg side, Burns ducks under it and avoids it"
"on a length and angling in, swinging in, at off, Burns shuffles across a bit and blocks this one solidly"
"wide of the crease, full and holds its line outside off, Burns is dragged forward as he drives with a slicing motion. Masood runs around from point, dives, and fumbles the ball eventually"
"very full and very wide outside off, Burns reaches out for the ball away from the body and jams it into the ground before the ball pops up to gully's right"
Burns stretches out and drives a full ball on off to mid-off
"shorter and slanting in at off stump, defensively bunted out to mid-on"

"wide of the crease, on a length and sharply nipping in just a shade outside off, Sibley plays inside the line and gets beaten"

tight lines and Sibley prods it back towards mid-on
"finds the edge, <b>squeezed out through gully for four!</b> Minor victory for the bowler there, but Sibley angled it down, Shadab threw himself horizontal but couldn't cut the ball off"

"length ball, 85pmh/137kph and it dies on Rizwan on its way through, bounces into the pads"
"that's gone like a rocket! Only 86mph/138kph as Naseem jumped wide and it kicked up from a length, Sibley wasn't going near it with a barge pole but the cordon liked it. Don't think Rizwan caught it cleanly, either"
"nips back into the pads, Kettleborough gives it! Burns doesn't take long to <b>review</b> though... Looked high to me, but the on-field call is in Abbas' favour here. Only needs to be clipping, <b>and that's what it is!</b> Umpire's call on the top of middle stump and Burns is clawed out! Struck him above the flap on the back leg, curving back in off the seam, Abbas makes the breakthrough for Pakistan"

"<B>monstrous appeal, and Sibley's been given!</B> He's <B>reviewed </B>it, that was an utter snorter, ripping off the deck, and I think the finger went up due to the vociferousness of the appeal. That was pure turn, missed the bat by inches as Rizwan grabbed high and wide outside off!"
"rocking back for a loose chop into the covers, a bit of a rattled response there from Sibley. No need to waft at that"

"<B>snorter!</B> Woah, where did that come from? Huge bite and lift, off a crack presumably. Eluded the gloves just about!"
plugging away on the leg-stump line
pressed to the off side
"down on one knee for an aggressive sweep, finds the gap at square leg"
"<strong>over the wicket, a wild drive, and straight to slip!</strong> Sibley was happy to kick it out of the rough, but as soon as the angle changed, and the stumps were threatened, he lashed his hard hands through the line, and paid the price with a fat snick to Shafiq! Pakistan's dry spell reaps its rewards, and changes the tone of this chase!"

"<B>gun-barrel straight, right in the channel, and snags the edge to first slip!</B> That's excellent probing fast bowling from Naseem... fractionally shorter this time, rising into the splice, but it was all about the line. Had to play it, didn't play it well enough!"
pitched up and driven smoothly but picks out mid-off
"full on the pads, <b>Pope clouts four through square leg!</b> Scream of frustration from Young Nas, as the ball races away. But he's already got himself a gold star for that over"
"spin and bounce from round the wicket, Stokes stays back and cattle-prods it defiantly to earth"

"length ball, angling in on off, Stokes props forward"
"fired into the pads, Naseem is bellowing for lbw, Illingworth shakes his head... Azhar <b>reviews</b>, maybe on the strength of the appeal, maybe on the identity of the batsman. Looked leg side on first glance, and Hawk-Eye backs up that assumption - missing leg, <b>so Pakistan lose that review</b>. Full marks for enthusiasm from Naseem, but zero for DRS smarts"
"follows up with a feisty bumper, Stokes pulls at it, another appeal as Rizwan takes down the leg side... and Naseem follows through right down the pitch to give Stokes a proper birdy stare, too. This kid's got moxy, fo' sho'"

Brilliantly taken at the second attempt by Rizwan, whether there was anything on it or not... <b>and UltraEdge shows a spike!</b> This kicked up at Stokes, up around the armpit, and <i>tickled</i> the glove on its way through!
