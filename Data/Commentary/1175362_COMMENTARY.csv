pitches it up to see if there's swing. And the ball does curl a degree or two into the left-hander but not so much that he isn't able to drive it firmly to mid-off
"lovely drive to the left of mid-off, where Siraj puts in the dive and stops a boundary. Umesh will keep pitching the ball up there. That's his strength in the Powerplay. (But good batsmen can turn it into a weakness too)"
just like that! He goes full but also way too straight and Rohit just helps it along to the long leg boundary. Easy put-away
"good length on off stump, defends"
<b>gorgeous shot</b>! Early signs that this pitch is a beauty. The ball comes onto Rohit's bat and he takes full toll with a flick shot through square leg that is every bit as jaw-dropping as the Mona Lisa (or maybe The Scream)
"good length on off stump, and at high pace too, Rohit defends now that he doesn't have too much room to work with"
"clips the half-volley on leg stump straight to midwicket, where Chahal fumbles but recovers quickly enough to prevent the single"
whips it off his pads to long leg.
"<b>inside edge</b>! And it's the result of Rohit being unprepared for the pace and movement. Saini hits the deck at 144 kph and gets the ball to dart into the right-hander, who tentatively brings his bat down and is lucky not to chop on"
"fullish, 147kph,  and outside off, Rohit steps forward and lets it go"
"<b>149 kph</b>, back of a length and angled into off stump, Rohit keeps to his crease and blocks to point."
<b>picks the gap at cover</b>! Rohit is bank when he gets the chance to drive and here Saini floats the ball up well outside the off stump. The Mumbai Indians captain says thank you and also I'm not afraid of you with a giant stride forward and a simple push to the left of AB
slices the shortish delivery on off stump to third man
"<b>extra bounce</b> and so much that Rohit, set up for the back foot punch, has to take his bottom hand off the bat. This pitch has pace!"
waits nicely for the full delivery on off stump but the plan to get a single behind point doesn't quite work
works the short ball on his hips behind square leg
"heaves it between midwicket and mid-on! That's a de Kock special, right from his disdainful walk down the pitch against the fast bowler and the fast hands that help him put so much power on the shot"
"shortish on leg stump, he flicks it to midwicket"
"142kph, full on middle, he turns it to mid-on"
"142kph, blocks a good length ball outside off."
"<b>into orbit</b>! The Rohit Sharma front foot pull. And it is breathtaking. Sees the ball just back of a length, so he holds in position after that trigger movement forward and then just lets his lovely, clean bat swing do everything necessary to deposit the ball beyond midwicket"
"full, 149 kph, and outside off, he eases it to cover"
"full and angled into off stump, he pushes to mid-off"
opens the face and slices the back of a length delivery to point
pulls the back of a length delivery to midwicket
<b>beats him</b> as de Kock tries to make room to cut a short ball pitching on leg stump and angling away
"<b>toooo goooooood</b>! He steps out of his crease again, making just a tiny bit of room so that he can take the length ball and shows it the sights behind long-on."
"good work - at least at the start - as Siraj pulls his length back and cramps the left-hander running at him. But then after the defensive push comes straight at him, he misfields and isn't alert enough to stop the quick single (course if he had hit the stumps direct at the non-strikers, de Kock would have been out)"
glides the shortish delivery outside off to point
"crashes it down the ground. This is brute force. And it's not really a Rohit thing. He relies on timing and the genius of his bat swing. But here, seeing a length ball outside off, he just pulverises it to the long-off boundary"
steps out and drills the length ball outside off to mid-on
"<b>good response</b>. He sees de Kock advancing and bangs it in short, aiming for his right shoulder. The batsman has no option but to duck"
"<B>dropped</b> at midwicket. It's hit so very hard. But it's coming straight to de Grandhomme. He has to get up off his feet, stick his hands above his head, and then hope it sticks. (Hint, it doesn't)"
"stumps the advancing batsman again, going for his toes this time, and following him as he moves outside leg. This is good stuff from Saini. He's under <b>extreme</b> pressure but he's holding his own"
short and quick on leg stump and it results in a mistimed pull behind square leg
"launches it over cover. Again it's not perfectly timed but Rohit knows with everyone up inside the circle in front of square on the off side, he doesn't really need to hit them all 100%. That's the timeout."
"reverse sweep straight up, but he doesn't connect with the good length ball outside off, skidding on without turning"
"shortish and outside off, he cuts through point. Bad bounce makes the fielder look silly"
"<b>round the legs</b>! This is genius! This is superb game awareness! He's seen the batsman going for funky shots. He's expecting the same again. And he's ready with the counter. A perfectly pitched googly. And de Kock is caught unawares. He tries the reverse sweep again but Chahal bowls it a few yards quicker and a tiny bit flatter. It pitches outside leg, hurries onto the batsman, piggybacks off the inside edge and crashes into his stumps"

"length outside off, makes room and tries to blast it through the off side, can't time it as it trickles away to cover"
"<strong>that's against the run of play and the crowd erupts!</strong> Clever bowling as Rohit shuffled across off stump, Umesh banged it hard into the surface and further away from Rohit's reach, which meant that he had to drag it across the line, got it high on the bat and spooned a high catch to long-on, who clung on comfortably"

<B>another leading edge</b> as Moeen is done in by a hint of movement off the pitch. McClenaghan hits the deck hard and that helps him generate a little bit of magic. Not enough to get a wicket though as the ball wanders in the air behind point
flicks the length ball on leg stump through midwicket. Serene and simple cricket. It's the game's equivalent to the 2+2 question.Everybody (except Dexter) knows the answer to that
"back of a length on off stump, defends but he's into the shot too early and gets a leading edge"
nudges it down towards mid-on
"offcutter, on a length on leg stump, to start and Parthiv defends it to point"
"<B>falls short of mid-off</b>. Moeen looks for the flowing drive through extra cover, but again his timing is all messed up, cause, this time, Malinga gets it to swing into the left-hander"
"<b>deceives him so royally</b> that Moeen has to do a double-take to see where the ball goes. The mother of all slower balls, hitting on a good length, holding on the pitch and skewing off the bottom of the bat towards square leg as Moeen looks to flick"
<b>inswinging yorker</b>! This is genius level bowling from Malinga. And Parthiv just can't do jack. Inside edge onto his boot
"<b>beats him with the offcutter</b> and Parthiv, having judged the length and line - short and outside off - fails to spot the change in pace. As a result, he doesn't adjust his bat swing and is too early on the shot"
flicks behind square leg
walks across his crease and flicks a length ball on off stump to deep square leg
nails the yorker and goes one better by following Moeen's movement outside leg. The batsman is just about able to dig it out to mid-on
short and outside off - the buffet ball in all forms of cricket - and Parthiv wallops it over midwicket
"<b>lovely bowling</b>. McClenaghan is alert to Parthiv's mischief moving across his crease. And to counter it, he takes all the pace off and drags the line wide outside off. In the end, the left-hander can only flick for a single through square leg"
"<b>top edge over the keeper</b>. It's a ghastly return for a good ball - bouncer, climbing up to his right shoulder, and forcing him to drag it from outside off if he wants to pull. Moeen does and though he miscues it, he still benefits big time"
"<b>that is amazing</b>! McClenaghan misses the yorker by a few inches and as a result it ends up as a bit of a half-volley on middle stump. Moeen waits in his crease, that bat high in the air, ready to swoop down on the offering, and he flicks it with such ridiculous power that is sails over square leg. All in the wrists! Plenty in the wrists!"
"short and angled across the left-hander, Parthiv works it to midwicket"
"<b>direct hit and Moeen's gone</b>! There's a dive. It's desperate. But it's also very very late. There is no single here. Not when Rohit is lurking at midwicket. But Parthiv turns the slower ball, on a length on middle stump, there and demands the run. It starts with a bit of hesitation and it ends with Moeen miles short of safety"
"back of a length and outside off, defends"
"whips it to the long-on boundary. Shifts his weight back to the short ball outside off, gets up tall so he can get on top of the ball, and lets his wrists do the rest"
<b>outside edge</b> as Kohli reaches out to a length ball wide outside off with a cover drive. Ends up at the third man boundary
laces it to the point boundary. Kohli has dominated Bumrah in the IPL. There might be more than 100 runs in this head to head now and this goes right in the top draw. Lunging forward - pace be damned - and opening the face of the bat at the last second to find the gap to the left of Pollard
on a length on leg stump and Parthiv redirects it to deep square leg
"lbw appeal, but this will be sliding down leg. Kohli rarely gets lbw even though he does shuffle across his stumps - like he does here. Length ball, pitching outside off, seaming into the right-hander. It's rare that Kohli misses the flick but he survives"
"<b>beats him</b> all ends up! This is the off-pace legcutter, pitching on the in-between length, not full enough to drive or short enough to pull. Kohli looks to flick, playing according to the angle of the ball, but it grips the pitch and darts away to the keeper. Also: <b>it makes Kohli lose his balance. When was the last time that happened?</b>"
slices it to point
"gets nice and tall to lash the short and wide delivery to the point boundary. Spectacular batting from the RCB captain. 'Yassss', he screams as the ball races past the infield"
"more deliciousness! It's like the ice-cream truck's come early and everyone gets chocolate! Kohli dances down the track, turns a back of a length ball to one that's perfectly in the slot and drives like the boss that he is through the covers"
waits for the tossed up ball from round the wicket to come to him on the base of off stump and then whips it to the left of deep square leg. Lovely stuff. Mumbai don't want runs leaking from both ends and Parthv is giving them monster headaches
"launches it over deep midwicket! He's got such fast hands against spin, especially through the leg side, and Krunal, by going round the wicket, is feeding that strength."
flicks the low full toss on leg stump to deep midwicket
gets forward and nudges the good length ball on leg stump towards midwicket
on the pads and Parthiv turns it to short fine leg and looks for a single. Nothing doing
"<b>appeal for lbw</b> as Krunal gets a good length ball to pitch on off stump from round the wicket and turn into the left-hander quite sharply. Parthiv plays all around it, but it would probably have missed leg stump. <b>Time out</b>"
waits on the back foot to deal with the flatter delivery outside off and cuts it past point diving to his right
"misfield from Hardik! He's at the long-off boundary, running to his right, he's made it to the ball, but doesn't drag it back as he slides across the turf. Parthiv gets another four, this one with a cover drive to a loopy delivery outside off"
"short and outside off, he backs away and cuts behind point"
picks the googly and flicks it off middle stump to deep midwicket
<b>chops on</b>! Parthiv loves pace on the ball and here there is none. And he discovers that as he backs away and shapes to cut. He's into the shot too early. The googly then deflects off the inside edge and clatters into his sticks.
"<B>dropped</b> at first slip! Yuvraj is the fielder. And it's onto him so very quickly. The only hope he is is for it to stick and it just doesn't. A hard-handed, backfoot push from AB - that should tell how fast the edge went to the fielder, that to to his left side, which is usually harder for most fielders at first slip."

"looks like a flipper and though it seems to gather pace off the pitch after hitting a fullish length on middle stump, AB is happy to play it off the back foot and flick it through midwicket"
shifts back in his crease to punch a short ball on off stump to long-on
"googly outside off, AB reaches out to it and flicks to midwicket"
Rohit is at slip now and he appeals for a catch off the inside edge onto thigh and over to him. But there's no suck luck. AB lives to slog sweep the leggie again. Although he might want to avoid that shot to a ball so full
"<b>huge appeal for lbw now</b> as AB premeditates a sweep, giving Markande the time he needs to adjust and sneak in the quicker delivery. He hopes its in line with off stump. But at the point where it hits the batsman's pads, it might be just outside"
