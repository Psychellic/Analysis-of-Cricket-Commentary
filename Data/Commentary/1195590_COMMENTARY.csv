"full again, and there's some shape into the batsman, but ends up on the pads and is flicked through square"
"back of a length, well outside off. The batsman was walking down the track, ends up shouldering arms and letting it through"
"length outside off, shuffling down the track again, opens the face to run it to third man"
"brings the line much closer to off, on the fifth stump, on a hard length. Too close to cut, and he doesn't connect with the shot"
"back of a length outside off, shorter than the last ball, which allows him to slash it from close to his body. Intentional shot, targetting the shortest boundary at third man. Bounces millimetres before the boundary, very fine"

"fullish, straight, defended back with a straight bat"
"length ball going across, ends up outside off, pushed gently towards cover for a quick single"
"length ball on the pads, flicked to deep square leg"
"<b>spliced up high but safe</b>. Full ball, shaping away a touch, he was looking to flick it over cow corner, but ends up getting a thick leading edge that flies over mid-on. Cutting running back does excellently to pull it back before the long-off boundary"
"slower ball, ends up as a full toss outside off, and he swats it to the long-off boundary with a flat bat. Over mid-off"
"bullet straight back down the ground. Full on the stumps, and he corks a powerful drive"
"the bowler corrects his length, goes back and outside off. Gets extra bounce which defeats the attempted cut"

"swing and a miss. Short outside off, he goes for a big pull shot, but connects with air as the ball sneaks under the bat"

makes room and punches inside out through cover
"makes room early, the bowler floats one up on the stumps, chops it to cover"
smashed through midwicket by rocking back to a short ball that sits up. Bad ball and he's taken full toll
"<b>rapped in front</b>. What a response by the bowler. This was flighted beautifully, dipped on the batsman and left him uncertain whether to press forward or rock back. He opts for a tentative working away, but the ball beats bat and turns into him, strikes him on the pad. Would have struck leg stump"
"tossed up on off, he takes a stride forward and steers it to short third point"
"quicker one, he jabs his bat down late, pushes it back to the bowler"

steered to short third man
"<b>stumping chance missed</b>. Down the track, doesn't get bat on it, it rolls off the pad. Good work by the keeper to dive to his left and scramble to get the ball, but he can't release it quickly enough with the batsman well down the wicket"
"<b>got 'im!</b>. They're not reading Zahir Khan at all. The go-to method seems to be to rush down the track, but that can prove dangerous when the bowler can beat you in flight and with turn. That's what happens, and Inglis's swipe connects only with air. Zahir doesn't miss the stumps"
"fuller on leg, jams his bat down at an angle to send it to square leg"
"goes very deep in his crease and gets right behind the ball, defending with a straight bat. Don't think he read it off the hand, more like played it off the pitch"

"fuller angling into him, loses balance a bit while splaying it to wide long-on"
"slower ball, seemed to stick in the pitch a bit. He was giving himself room but the angle coming into him meant he didn't have much room. ends up patting it backward of square"
"gives himself room again, this one is on the stumps on a length, and is cut hard through point. There's protection in the deep though"

"gets bat on that one, full on the fifth stump, drives on the front foot through cover to pick up two"
"<b>just short of mid-on</b>. Slightly short and he swings hard at it. Doesn't get underneath it enough.

He can't get there, but manages to recover and chase after the ball, dive and pull it back in before the long-on boundary"
