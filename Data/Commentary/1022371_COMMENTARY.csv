"good delivery first up! A yorker, speared in from that left-arm line, and dug out!"
"huge appeal! Pakistan <B>review</B> for lbw! That was surely heading for the top of off stump, but did it pitch in line? Bairstow was neither forward nor back, and yep, it pitched in line and would have pinged the timber! But it is umpire's call. Yowzers"
"another probing delivery, on a tight middle-and-leg line and angling across. Bairstow nudges uneasily to the leg side"
"outside off this time, a chance for Hales to unfurl his arms this time and get some proper bat on ball into the covers"
"hustled for pace from a skiddy length, inside-edged with flat feet into the cordon. If Pakistan keep this up, we're in for a lively time!"
"punched down the ground, Hales instantly judging the fractional over-pitch, and unleashing his levers. A powerful drive past mid-off to end a fine over with a statement of intent"
"decent wheels, another left-armer off Pakistan's production line. Pushed into the covers with a circumspect drive"
"back of a length, glided to point with a high-elbowed push"
"driven hard, off the back foot, into the covers"
"charged and clobbered! Hales came early, freed his arms, and that's a fine diving stop at short cover to save at least one run"
"hanging back in the crease, patted back to the bowler. Respectful shot to a tight line and length"
"outside off, that's a dangerous dangly length, and Bairstow is tempted into a nibble outside off"
punched into the off side once more
"on the leg side, shovelled off the hip, out to square leg. And that's some lightning running from Bairstow, completing a comfortable two by pressing the first run hard"
"flipped in the air, off the pads, and sweetly timed through square leg. Perfectly safe - only the umpire in the vicinity - as the ball bobbles down to the rope"
"a short-arm jab through midwicket! Bairstow is starting to settle in now. That wasn't especially short, but it was timed to perfection, in the air again, but he's got the measure of the field"
"driven, off an inside-edge, but again, picks the gap inadvertently this time. A long chase to gather, and back they come for two"
stout defence on an off-stump line. A good finish to an expensive over
"defended, off a slight inside-edge"
glided down to third man to rotate the strike once more
"pitches outside leg and slaps the pads, as Bairstow attempts a leg-glance"
worked to leg
"on the pads, chiselled through the gap to midwicket"
"hits the pads and up goes the finger! That looked tight, though not as nailed-on as Bairstow's... leg-sided maybe? We're in for another <B>review</B>...  there's no inside-edge, so it's over to ball-tracker ... it pitched <B>outside leg!</B>"
poked into the off side
"tight line on off stump, Junaid tries to gather and shy in one movement in his followthrough, but the gather goes awry..."
stands tall on the front foot to clip a drive to midwicket
"pushed into the off side, a bit splice-y as he goes at the ball with hard hands, but falls short of short cover"
tip and run to mid-off
"over-pitched, a filthy floaty half-volley, and Hales latches onto a booming drive through the covers. Looked like a slower ball, but ended up as a pie"
"back of a length, Bairstow leans into a cut but can't connect"
"punched back to the bowler, off the back foot"
"bunted down the ground, met on the top of the bounce with a full face and slammed past the bowler"
rolls the wrists on a flick to leg
"down the track and driven straight to cover, and Rumman has his maiden ODI wicket! Hales was aiming something expansive over the infield, but didn't get enough bat into his stroke, the blade turned on impact. A comfortable catch to Babar's midriff, and Pakistan have their breakthrough!"
"outside off, a good probing line to greet the new batsman, who allows himself a sighter as the ball fizzes by"
worked to the leg-side off the front foot
"skiddy line on off stump, Root looking to flick across the line but it's onto him quickly. Careful now!"
"a fuller face of the bat this time, into the covers"
dicey! Another one that skids off as Root attempts to get cute with his angles. Has to adjust late to save his stumps from a splattering ...
"down the track, clipped to leg, a good sprawling stop"
"finally, a touch of genuine width - as in, not zeroed in on the stumps. Root leans back to cut a pair of runs to deep point. Threatening over ..."
good tight line
"high elbow, into the covers"
"chopped down to third man, Bairstow is seriously rapid once again, pulling two runs off his bat like a conjuror pulling a rabbit from his hat"
flicked to midwicket
"good attacking length, pitching outside leg and going on with the left-arm angle as Root squares up to defend"
"that is formidable timing. On the pads, just nudged through square leg, and that races over the outfield"
"outside off, on the back foot, pushed into the covers"
"advancing down the track, attempted flick through midwicket"
"hangs back in the crease this time, waits for the ball to arrive under his nose, and bunts to through the leg side"
"pushed right back into the crease, fine restrictive line"
"skids on once again, into the pads, but clearly down the leg side"
"Root's not enjoying this wicket-to-wicket water torture. Another attempted nurdle off the back foot, but the ball is never quite where he wants it to be"
"on the pads, flicked out to midwicket"
"outside off, a well-timed chop down to third man"
"on the back foot, worked into the leg side. Pakistan doing a good job of keeping it tight, making England wait for opportunities"
"<B>dropped!</B> To be fair, Azhar did supremely to cut off the boundary, a salmon leap at short midwicket, got one hand to it but couldn't cling on. Might have caught it on the rebound if he'd managed to keep his eyes on it... nah, it was way behind him"
guided down to third man
"slower ball, looped onto the toes, tucked to midwicket"
on the pads
nudged to leg
"skiddy delivery, back of a length, and onto Root quickly as he punches off the back foot to cover"
"forward with more confidence, and accepts the single into the covers"
onto the front foot to work the gap
clipped into the leg side. Singles will suffice for England right now
"cripes, he could have struck first ball! A tentative, loopy drive from Root, misreads the length, and toe-ends <I>just</I> out of Babar's reach in the covers ... golly"
"a bit of a dirty long-hop, Bairstow cuts fiercely but without very subtle placement, out to deep cover"
"another drag-down, and Root is unabashed by his let-off, as he rocks back and throws everything into a fierce pull through midwicket"
"well bowled, outside off, and beats a loose slap. Pakistan's first dot in 16 deliveries..."
"slapped to cover, off the front foot"
a more compact push into the off side. A mixed bag in that over!
"driven with a full face down to long-on, they jog the single"
tight line once more
"squeezed into the off side, bat and pad tight together"
"short, and more width than usual. Bairstow leans into a hungry cut, but point tidies up. He missed out there"
back on that restrictive wicket-to-wicket line. Blocked
pushed with lots of bottom hand out to wide mid-on
"thumped down the ground, lots of bottom hand"
"battered hard and straight, but reaches the man on the rope at long-on in a flash. Damage limited"
worked into the covers to rotate the strike
"well bowled, beats a flashy, wristy drive. Big spin"
"angled into the off side, working with the spin this time"
"open-faced glide into the cordon, looking for the single but nothing doing"
calmly pushed down to long-on
"width, chopped, backward point is well placed to cut off that stroke"
"forward, clipped to leg, easy single"
eased back to the bowler
"dabbed into the off side, another calm single"
one more single into the covers. England biding their time against a fine restrictive spell
"smeared to leg, baseball-style. Effective enough"
"high elbow, punched off the back foot to point"
swung into the leg side. One bounce to the sweeper
onto the front foot
forward to defend into the covers
"width, slapped, <B>dropped</B> at slip! Oh dear, that came hard and at an improbable angle, but it needed to be taken high above Babar's head. And then, in hurtles Hasan at gully, who can't cling onto the rebound! Scenes!"
good line and length to launch the spell
"bunted into the leg side, standing still at the crease and relying on hand-eye"
"hoisted high into the leg side, this must surely be taken, and it is! Deep square leg jogs in to pouch a lollipopped top-edge, Bairstow was pulling ambitiously off the front foot, but didn't judge the pace and bounce"
"length ball, whirring back in towards middle and leg, prodded to the on side from the crease"
"good length outside off, Root leans forward and drops short of cover and they hurry through"
"tight stuff from Hasan, 140kph/87mph on middle and off, Morgan blocks - what a superb introduction, <i>jazba</i> and economy"
"over the wicket, pushed through outside off, Root dabs it through backward point"
"round the wicket, lobbed up and it stays a touch low, almost wrong-footing Morgan as he drops back to pull through mid-on"
"on the stumps, worked with the turn through backward square leg"
"back round the wicket to the lefty, sliding on to hit the inside edge as Morgan defends from the crease"
"flighted on off, presses forward to block this time"
"tossed up and met on the front foot, pushed back down the track and Hafeez fields. Another good over for Pakistan"
"full outside off, 137kph/85mph and driven to the cover sweeper"
"touch short, 141kph/87mph outside off and zipping through to the keeper as Morgan shoulders arms"
"shortish length but not quite wide enough to cut, chopped towards backward point"
"angled across, Morgan this time swats one to third man off the back foot"
"dug in, loopy bouncer and Root doesn't make an effort to play as the ball clears him by a distance"
"short ball, outside off, Root rides the bounce and steers to point"
"length delivery, slightly wide in the channel, Root steps out and guides it to the right of third man for a couple"
"pushed through flat on off stump, tapped into the covers"
"flighted, gives this one a bit more air, Morgan waits for it and clips down to long-on"
nudged back down the ground once again
"big appeal from Hafeez as Morgan is hit on the pad attempting to reveres-sweep... Tucker shakes his head, Hafeez immediately wants to discuss reviewing, even though Pakistan have already used theirs up. Bottom edge on it, anyway"
"pushed through and Morgan goes back, tries unsuccessfully to force through the off side"
tossed up and steered into a gap in front of point for a couple
"on the stumps, turned short into the midwicket area, could be tight... but the throw misses"
"round the wicket now, Morgan comes forward to block"
"tight lines, 141kph/87mph, angled in and hitting the seam, Morgan gets into line"
fuller length in the channel and this is flayed through the covers to the sweeper
"slower ball, wide of the stumps and dabbed in front of the diving backward point for one"
dug in wide of the off stump and Morgan gets a bottom edge trying to heave it away
Root scuttles down and pushes a single to long-on
"tossed up and straightening, Morgan uses the feet and bunts it through mid-on again"
"flighted, Root closes the face and drives down the ground"
"flat trajectory on the stumps, this skids on and nearly sneaks through as Morgan goes back, manages to jab it away off the inside edge for one through square leg - that's the England 100 up"
"flat on off stump, whipped across the line to deep midwicket"
worked away for another single
"shortish outside off, Root goes back and pushes into a gap in the covers"
"gloved down the leg side, out of Sarfraz's reach! Hasan so nearly strikes again, testing Morgan with the bouncer, similar to a chance dropped by Matt Wade in the Australia game... That's England's first boundary in nine overs, too"
"length ball, comes across and blocks"
"Hasan probing away on a length, Morgan shows it a straight bat"
comes forward and flicks a single through mid-on
"full length, tailing in on the stumps, Root closes the bat face and clips through square leg"
"tossed up on off, tapped into the covers"
"floats up the googly, outside the line of off and Root punches through the covers"
"stays over the wicket, tossed up on middle and off, Morgan works to mid-on"
"pushed through on the stumps, turned off the pads through backward square leg"
"flighted, gets forward to the pitch, drills another single to long-off"
flatter on the stumps and Morgan can't work it past midwicket
"darted on the stumps, Root clips through the leg side to the boundary rider"
"tossed up outside off and driven into the covers, fielded at the second attempt"
"drops a touch short and Morgan swivels to thrash a pull in front of deep midwicket for a second, more authoritative boundary"
flighted on off and defended coming forwards
tucked into the leg side with soft hands and they scamper through for a quick single
"floated up and worked to the leg side, midwicket misreads it and they trot through this time"
punched back down the ground and Shadab fields leaping to his left
tossed up and can't get this one away either
"flighted, turned into a gap for one"
"goes for the reverse sweep, loops over Sarfraz and slip takes the catch... up goes the finger! But Morgan <b>reviews</b> immediately, surely thinking it came off his forearm. Yes, replays confirm that pretty quickly, and the lbw shout is deemed to be bouncing over, so Tucker's decision is overturned"
straightening on the stumps and worked to the leg side
"googly, flayed through point, Morgan rubs in salt with a drive four through the covers"
on the stumps and nurdled away to leg
"round the wicket, tossed up and defended on off"
"pushed through, Morgan comes froward to drive but can't beat the man at cover"
angled in and flipped in the air through mid-on for one
"length ball on middle and leg, worked with the turn to square leg"
"now Root decides to improvise, down on one knee and paddled over the shoulder, fine leg runs around to clean up"
floated up and dobbed into the leg side
"pushed through, Morgan nudges off his legs and they hustle for the single"
"got him, nicked to the keeper trying to cut! Shadab-a-dab-a-doo, Pakistan break through! Root drags himself away in a huff but there was a clear top edge on that, some extra bounce as he went back, smartly held by Sarfraz at the wicket"
Stokes watches his first ball carefully and blunts it into the leg side
"lobs up the googler, outside leg stump, Stokes seems to pick it and defends"
"another wrong'un, this time drifting towards off stump, punched through the covers for one to get Stokes going"

"flatter, on the stumps and tapped to leg"
"Morgan punches down the ground, Shadab throws himself to his left to grab it, to applause from the crowd"
"floated up on middle and leg, worked squarer and midwicket has to give chase"
"how has that missed leg stump?! Morgan went back to pull and missed, the ball seeming to sidestep the woodwork at the last minute before deflecting off the keeper's gloves to short fine leg"
"worked back on the leg side. 'Shabash, shabash, shabash!' chirps Sarfraz"
tossed up and worked down the ground
"tight stuff from Hafeez, pushed back to the bowler"
comes forward and tickles a single to the on side
"touch leg side, Morgan stays back and flicks the ball behind square for one more"
"round the wicket, pitched up and prodded into the covers"
touch shorter outside off and Morgan runs it down to third man
"ooh, that;s the stuff from Hasan, shaping away from Stokes and kicking, hitting the outside edge and flying in the air through gully"
"gone, another one falls, Hasan strikes again! The ball was very wide and Morgan was advancing to trying and belt it down the ground, only succeeded in getting a thin edge to the keeper. The temperature is rising in Cardiff, boyos!"
"over the wicket, pitched up outside off, Buttler gets straight to work with a meaty clump through cover"
"back round, 138kph and Stokes comes forward to defended on off"
"over the wicket, shortish and worked off the body behind square"
"length ball, comes forward on off and drives through cover point"
"banged in short, only 129kph/80mph but it climbs aggressively as Buttler advances and pulls his neck in at the last"
punched through the covers
angled in on the stumps and Stokes works another single off his legs
"back of a length, Buttler goes to pull, beaten as the ball zips past his horizontal bat"
comes across and works back to the bowler
"round the wicket, angled in at 85mph and Stokes can't flick it past midwicket"
Hasan is shaping the ball away from the lefties - such movement did for Morgan in the end - and this time Stokes elects to leave
"on the stumps, flicked wide of midwicket and they get one despite some good fielding"
"pitched up and driven back through mid-off, these two rotating the strike calmly for now"
Stokes comes across on off and defends
"edged, and gone! Oh my! Nibbled away from back of a length, Buttler was tentative outside off, and Sarfraz gathers low behind the stumps! England are officially in a pickle. And Pakistan are brawling!"
inswinging full-bunger. Moeen pushes cautiously into the leg side
watchful
"on the front foot, covering the lateral movement with a broad face of the bat"
"solid defence to a full-length inducker. Nods his head to Moeen, as if to communicate the movement that Junaid is getting"
"banged in short, Stokes thinks about having a swing, but discretion is the better part of valour on this occasion"
"well bowled, full length, nipping away, a loose poke from a flat-footed Moeen"
"utter ripper! Unplayably good nut, perfect line, perfect length, nips away half a bat's width and beats everything. This is a proper contest!"
"Moeen strides forward, defending into the off side. England have no choice but to ride the storm right now"
"flat-footed defence, sliding into line, just getting back to ball, whatever it takes"
"pounded through the covers! That was streaky but effective from Moeen, risking the thick edge into the gully, but middling a back-foot drive on this occasion, past a sprawling deep point"
"outside off, tempting the drive, but leaving alone"
"inswing to the left-hander, from a very full length, Stokes chops a drive into the covers"
"dabbed to point, back of a length this time. Thoughts of a single, but wisely they decline"
"shorter, Stokes leans into a pull, but doesn't connect properly. Midwicket tidies up"
"banged in short, no stroke offered"
"outside off, slapped on the up to cover, a slight misfield and England jog the single"
"short and a pleasing click of willow as Moeen connects with a pull, but only as far as deep midwicket"
forward and pushed to cover
flogged into the off side. Have Pakistan taken the foot off the seam gas too soon? We shall see
back-foot block
"a chance to free the arms, pounded down to long-on"
"spanked with oodles of bottom hand, over the infield and away through the vacant cow corner. Effective tonking"
down the track with massive intent. Loses his shape on connection and midwicket limits the damage
cracked into the covers
"tight line, rising into a defensive push"
"brilliant catch! Fakhar's the man as Moeen top-edges a pull out to deep backward square, he keeps his eye on the ball, gallops to his left, and plucks it with both hands as he stretches at full length!"
"outside off, a well-timed push off the back foot, out to deep cover"
"on the back foot, another punch into the off side"
leaning into a defensive push from deep in the crease

tucked to midwicket
a well-timed punch into the covers
"short once again, Stokes refuses to be tempted on the pull"
"tailing in from outside off, Stokes works with the angle and punches an on-drive through the infield"
"thumped down the ground with lots of bottom hand, as if sizing up the lofted drive"
worked down the ground again.
fenced into the off side
"on the pads, fizzed in a bit flatter, can't beat short square with a flick"
"tucked in front of square, an easy single, but a gifted two as two fielders converge and distract each other"
"tossed up on the pads, the sort of ball that Stokes might have butchered in ordinary circumstances. But instead he settles for a calm flick to midwicket"
a sharp start! Beating the outside edge
"good ball again, back of a length, nipping off the seam, beating a loose poke outside off"
"nuttage! This one drifts in on the round-the-wicket angle, holds its line, and passes over the top of the bails!"
"slower ball, drops the pace, upps the revs and leaps a cutter into Rashid's gloves. Bowling!"
"short, but too short on this occasion. The Pakistani contingent in the crowd grumble their disapproval"
"a well-intended bottom-handed batter into the leg-side. But Stokes doesn't dare go airborne yet, and midwicket gathers"
"slower ball, wide of off stump. Stokes has time to pick it, but not to time it, as he settles for a single to cover"
"bouncer, Stokes pulls, but he's onto it too soon. Toe-ended into the covers"
"short again, hauled with intent out to square leg"
"huge late inswing, a big appeal, but drifting down leg, but hang on, there's a direct hit at the non-striker's end, and Rashid is gone! Too slow to react to Stokes' call. And England continue to sink!"
"round the wicket, defended with a full face back to the bowler"
"on the toes, tucked to leg"
"inswing from a full length, well bowled, and calmly played, with a full face"
"short ball, Stokes swings, but hits down on the stroke, straight to midwicket"

solidly into line
hauled into the leg side
"massive inswing to the left-hander, met on the full and clipped to leg"
"back of a length, pounded down the ground to long-on"
"gives himself room, but mets a fine yorker with a calm steer to cover"
"back of a length, angled down the leg side, Stokes hauls a pull into the leg side, looks for two, but slips at the non-striker's end. Fortunately his feet are over the line as the shy comes in"
tailing in appreciably. Plunkett defends on the back foot
"full toss, but the surprise gets the better of Plunkett's aggressive wipe back through the line. Hasan grabs in his followthrough"
a bit of width and Plunkett slashes gratefully down to third man to pick off the single
"on the back foot, poked into the leg side"
"decent yorker, excellent connection, timed beautifully into the gap at wide long-on, but Pakistan's fielders are on it like a bonnet"
"flogged into the leg side, Stokes is starting to wind it up but still hasn't hit a boundary. Bounces five yards short of the fielder"
"low full toss, poked into the covers"
"beautiful yorker, right into the toes, no getting that away"
"well bowled again, an inswinging yorker. Stokes nails it with a full-blooded drive, but straight to cover"
"slower bouncer, a fraction too high. Raees is miffed"
worked down to long on
"that's a superb end result, inswinging yorker, clipped to leg, but a grievous error in delivery. A <B>free hit</B> coming up for Plunkett's long levers"
"it was in the slot, but tailed in at the last second. An inside-edge through fine leg to bring up the 200... but golly, a direct hit and Plunkett would have been curtains!"
"full once again, punched down to long-on"
"slower ball, follows Stokes down the leg side as he gives himself room. This is such a tremendous tussle"
"awesome bowling from Hasan! Another slower ball, Stokes doesn't pick it as it grips in the surface from a yorker length. The ball steeples into the off side, and plops gently into the hands of mid-off! England are in severe danger of being bowled out now"
"inswinging full length, driven to cover"
dead-batted into the off side. And that is the end of a stunning spell from Hasan. He's put his side as close to a place in the final as they could have dared to hope
a ludricrously slow slower ball. Wood was utterly befuddled as the ball dribbled past him like a leaky tap
"full once again, dabbed back down the track"
opens the face to glide a single to third man
"<B>A BOUNDARY!</B> A whole four runs, outside-edged through third man"
"pounded out to deep midwicket, emboldened by the sudden splurge of runs, but he's only gone and picked out deep square leg! England's last hope of serious rope-clearing is gone with seven balls remaining!"
"a leaping slower ball, grips the surface and tweaks into the gloves. Another remarkable over goes by"
"slower-ball bouncer, and well watched onto the middle of a pull to square leg ... ooh, hello, a <B>free hit</B> coming up. Every little helps ..."
"gives himself room was a stonking tailend wipe-up-and-wallop over, well, anywhere really. But ... err... misses"
"slower ball yorker, all the variations, and no contact"
"a touch of width outside off, carved to point"
"bang! A fulll-blooded swipe down the ground! Lots of air, less distance, and a bit of a Keystone Cops chase from two fielders, almost colliding but just about doing enough to claw back the boundary. Well done in the end"
"backing away to have a swipe, Sarfraz gathers, under-arms, and strikes! Wood a long way short"
"short and down the leg side, good pace and bounce but that's wide to start off with"
"hits the pitch hard, shortish length and seaming away outside off, Azhar leaves well alone"
"dug in short and Azhar latches on to the pull, firmly swatted past the dive of square leg but Rashid runs up from fine leg to cut it off"
"back of a length, angled across from over the wicket and left alone"
"goes for the bouncer, Zaman takes it on, b-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-g top edge and it clears the keeper - goes all the way! Pakistan are already 5% of the way there"
"length ball, 144kph/89mph on the stumps, defended back towards the bowler"
"snorting off a shortish length, close to flicking the glove as Zaman lets this one go"
"good length outside off, nipping away and there's no stroke"
"strays on to the pads, Azhar helps it on the way... In fact, he didn't touch it but the delivery was wide of the diving Buttler and races to the rope beating fine leg"
"on the stumps, 138kph/86mph and shovelled for one to the leg side"
"goes round the wicket to Zaman, who calmly leans forward and plays no stroke to a length ball in the channel"
"shorter, 140kph and defended on the back foot into the off side, he thought about one but is sent back"
"on the stumps, worked down into the leg side"
angled in with the arm and defended towards midwicket
"short of a length, tapped down to the leg side on the back foot"

"pitched up in the slot, driven off the front foot, wide of mid-off, who puts in a dive to keep them to one"
"hits the middle of the pitch and Zaman heaves to leg, comes off the splice and sails towards fine leg... but it won't carry all the way, he has to run a long way to his right and they get one"
"lovely delivery to finish the over, back of a length and holding its line outside off as Azhar adjusts to play inside it at the last momemnt"
"Zaman comes out banging again, skips down and whips a pull, on top of it and well in front of fine leg, it runs away for another boundary"
shortish on the stumps and tucked into the leg side this time
"over the top of off, 138kph/86mph and Azhar gets into line to block"
"touch short, in the channel, Azhar isn't tempted to go after those"
"edged but short of the slips! Didn't get up all that much as Azhar went to drive, playing away from his body, Stokes did well to scoop it up one-handed down to his left"
pitched up and blocked towards point coming on to the front foot
goes back and steers one down to third man
short of a length over off stump and Azhar blocks from deep in the crease
"oof, this nips back, 141kph//88mph and nearly catches Azhar in two minds, he ends up hastily jabbing it down towards the slips"
"slightly wide, Azhar attempts to cut but doesn't get hold of it"
"good length, angled in on the stumps, 143kph/89mph and nudged wide of mid-on for one"
"Zaman steps down but elects not to buckle his swash this time, defends a short ball towards his feet and then they pinch another single"
"Ball continues, tight lines and tapped away"
"round the wicket, over middle and off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"banged in short, 132kph and pulled through backward square leg"
comes across outside off and dabs behind point... and then a misfield gives them a second. Sloppy start from England
"pitched up, presses forward and pushes into the covers"
"that's a good nut, not full enough to drive and it decks away off the surface as Azhar follows it, beats the outside edge"
"banged in short and Zaman pulls, in the air down to fine leg... actually, that has come flush off the helmet badge! No bat involved, leg byes signaled"
"another ripper from Wood, back of a length and whistling past the edge"
"beaten again, fuller this time and gets him forward to drive... Wood throws his head back in frustration, though Azhar wasn't even in the right postcode to hit that"
"short of a length outside off, stabbed down towards point"
"does him again, Wood jumping wide on the crease and firing it in full, Azhar again flashes the drive and fails to connect - luckily for him"

finds the single with a compact drive. Another over of limited alarms is ticked off for a very composed partnership
