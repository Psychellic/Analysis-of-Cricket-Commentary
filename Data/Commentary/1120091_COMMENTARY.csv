"140kph, gets the good length ball to nip into Rohit, who makes sure not to let his front leg dart too far across and blocks"
"works the angle this time, putting a length ball on off stump searching for the outside edge. Rohit doesn't oblige"
"and the yorker completes this set of three decidedly different deliveries. Rohit gets his bat down in front of his pad and times the ball sweetly through midwicket. Rohit realises there is a third on offer midway through, Dhawan though is only aware of his partner's intentions at the very last moment and could well have been run out had the throw from the boundary had a little more power"
blocks a fuller delivery on middle and off
"picks it up so easily and smashes the short ball to the square leg boundary. There's a short front foot press, then a shift of the weight back and a swivel so he gets his body into the shot."
lets the back of a length ball come to him and then slices it to point
"full and outside off, Rohit won't be chasing those"
"lovely line - pitching a shade outside off, to draw the batsman to block to cover, with a bat that is angled. Rohit, however, doesn't even bring his bat down"
"shifts wide of the crease to dupe Rohit into thinking the ball is closer to off stump than it actually is. Rohit, however, isn't easily fooled"
another good length ball in the off-stump corridor. No shot from Rohit again
"tailing into the pads and Dhawan makes it fly to the square leg boundary. Minimum effort on the flick, but the timing is top class"
""
"back of a length and outside off, Dhawan dabs it to deep third man"
"he's lost his discipline - and is lucky not to nick off. It's the length, combined with the angle, that forces Rohit to abandon his resolve to leave outside off. So full and juicy for the cover drive."
"back of a length on off stump, blocks"
"full on off stump, keeps it out"
"oh, he looks in form! Standing up tall against a shortish delivery and with nothing more than an extension of defence, finds the gap between point and cover and the timing to get it to the boundary"
"full on off stump, pushes it to mid-off and sprints through"
"that's soft, as if someone went up and dared him to give catching practice to short midwicket and he couldn't help himself. Full delivery, tailing in at the last second, cramping Rohit, forcing his head to fall over, his balance to go for a toss, and his bat to feebly hit to the ball to Munro"
"starts with a bouncer at 132 kph, right over middle and leg. Kohli evades it"
"takes a length ball on off stump and tucks it between midwicket and mid-on. He's an expert in that shot. Shuffles across, gets his head in line with the ball and always ensures he doesn't have to play around the front pad."
"for a second, it looks like Southee's inswing has Kohli in the wrong position. But then comes the recovery, the front foot being dragged back so a perfectly straight bat can come down and cream the ball to long-on"
"<b>ripper</B>! He has one of the best wrist positions in the world, to shape the ball both ways. This time, he takes it away from the left-hander, a good length ball moving so late that Dhawan is lured into the shot and subsequently left behind"
"full on off stump, defends close to his body"
"kisses off his thigh pad and wanders past Latham, diving to his right"
"another good length ball slides down leg, this time Dhawan can't connect anything playing the flick"
"both feet up in the air as he upper cuts the ball to the third man boundary. And while doing all of that, he also ensures he places the bouncer fine enough to avoid the fielder"
"back of a length on middle and off, nudges to mid-on"
"back of a length and outside off, slices to backward point"
"good length ball on off stump, Kohli gets right behind it"
"the short ball, but this one doesn't get up high at all. And it offers room to Kohli too. With his preference to move back and across, he is then in good position to pull the ball down, and power it away to the square leg boundary"
"good length and outside off, Kohli lets it go"
clips a good length ball a shade outside off to square leg - a result of his back and across trigger movement
"picks up the short ball and smashes it over deep square leg. Picks the length so very early, which allows him to pull, basically, off the front foot. He actually transfers the weight back after the shot"
"<b>huge appeal for caught behind</b>, and upon Southee's insistence - Latham the catcher says he doesn't know - Williamson reviews. It all happens, as it often does, with a bouncer. Right over middle and leg. Climbing up to Dhawan's nose. He loads up the hook shot, but is so very early into it. UltraEdge confirms there is no contact between ball and bat."
"probes away outside off stump, Kohli knows it is too wide for him to bother with"
blunts a shortish delivery on off stump
presents a straight bat to a full delivery on off stump. Touch of inward movement
"back of a length, hurrying into Kohli's thigh pad, proof of which is the fact he doesn't connect with a flick, which really is his shot (as are many others)"
"he's mis-hit the pull, but it still carries over the boundary at this small ground. Boult does well, moving around the wicket and getting in a quick short ball, a shade over the left shoulder, so Kohli dragging the ball with a cross-bat shot takes a risk and it comes off"
"back of length and outside off, slices to backward point"
lets the 136 kph short delivery come to him and then dabs it backward of point
"good length ball outside off, ignores it"
"he's getting good bounce off the pitch, with Kohli jumping up to steer a back of a length delivery to cover"
"he's not middled this either, but he's managed to beat mid-on to his right and that's enough on this outfield. Kohli looks for the cover drive, the ball thuds into the inside half of his bat and screams away"
"back of a length and outside off, lets it go"
"short of a length and outside off, ignores it again"
"flighted delivery on off stump, defends"
clips a full one down to long-on

punches a short delivery to cover
"firm push to cover point, with Milne probing a fuller length outside off"
"spears in a yorker at 136 kph at Dhawan's toes. The batsman loses his balance as he tries to flick, gets a little inside edge onto pad, would be sliding down as well"
"back of a length on off stump, uses the angle from around the wicket to flick it to short midwicket"
"full on off stump, Kohli gently turns it away to square leg"
"waits on the back foot to see if he can cut the ball behind point. There isn't quite that much room, so he finds the fielder instead"
"plays with a straighter bat this time, having more control to place the ball dead square at point"
"<b>appeal for lbw</b> with the ball skidding on and striking Kohli on the thigh. The batsman is not ready for the ball to keep coming on with the arm, having set up for a late cut. Umpire Tucker reckons that will be sliding down"

glides a 135 kph short delivery down to deep third man
"back of a length and on off stump, Dhawan steers it behind point"

rolls his wrists over the short ball outside off and gets it down to deep midwicket. Brings up the fifty partnership
"141kph, full on off stump, drives it back to the bowler and when Milne shapes to throw, both Dhawan and Kohli hurry back into their crease"
"good length, coming into the left-hander with the angle from around the wicket, looking for lbw. Dhawan just about gets bat on it first"
picks it away off his hips to deep square leg
no room for Dhawan to work with and so he can only pat a shortish delivery on off stump back where it comes from
"plenty of width, and Dhawan misses out as he shapes to flay it through point."
"another invitation to pierce that gap behind point and Dhawan takes it gleefully, waiting that little millisecond longer to be sure to place the ball well to the right of the sweeper"
"moves around the wicket to cramp Dhawan, who in turn uses the angle to flick the ball through midwicket"
"caught behind, excellent work from Latham! It's the cross-seamer, which tends to bounce a touch more if the seam hits the pitch. Kohli, going for a drive, away from his body feathers a nick to the wicketkeeper, who has done really well, standing up. Rising with the ball, taking it ever so smoothly"
"places the ball to the right of the short third man and gets off the mark with a well-constructed shot to the boundary. Granted, he was given the chance to exploit the field with de Grandhomme bowling outside off"
clips a shortish delivery on middle and off to square leg
"<b>ripper</b>. That's the way to welcome a new batsman, go for his toes. Karthik is so late in bringing his bat down, beaten for pace, and is lucky that ball isn't straight"

"Munro has come on, bowled around the wicket, and slid one way down leg side. Dhawan has looked to tap it on its head and paddle it fine. Latham has taken and appealed. It's been given. <b>Dhawan reviews straight away.</b> Fantastic take down leg side. But replays show it's nowhere near. Nothing on snicko either."

"good length at off stump, opens the face and nurdles this through cover"
"full at leg stump, punched to long-on off the front foot"

offcutter straight up. Dipping in towards off stump on a length. Flicked to midwicket who has stealthily snuck in now

"good length, fired down leg side. Watches it on and tickles it fine"
"length outside off, mistimed punch to mid-off"
<b>chips it straight to extra cover.</b> Loose dismissal. He steps down the track to try and go inside out. It's back of a length and it looks like he's late on it.
