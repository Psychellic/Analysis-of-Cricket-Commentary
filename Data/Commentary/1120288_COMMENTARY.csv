"goes fuller this time, a set of stumps wide outside off. Tharanga lets this one go"
"fine shot, but he finds extra cover. Shortish and wide outside off, punched off the back foot"
"good over to start. Full outside off, Tharanga lets it go"
"some swing. Full and wide, swings away after pitching. But the umpire deems it to be inside the tramline. Left alone"
"full and wide outside off, guided towards point. A fumble allows one"
"fantastic timing. Full and wide, swinging away. Tharanga leans into his drive and creams it through point. Long boundaries these"
"good adjustment of line, pushes this straighter - towards off. Defended"

"134 kph, full delivery outside off, swinging away. A crisp drive finds cover"
"this will race away. All form, and subsequent timing, and placement. Good length outside off, Tharanga stays back and carves a cut past point. Extra cover dives to his right, but doesn't have much chance"
"slightly straighter on a similar length. Good length outside off, pushed into the off side, towards extra cover"
"full again outside off, Tharanga half-presses forward and caresses a drive to Imam at short cover, who fumbles and allows a run"

"135 kph, full delivery on a fourth-stump channel, driven back into the off side"
"I think that's the first delivery that has gone into the leg side. Full and straight, meant to be the one that catches Tharanga by surprise. But he's in great form, sees it coming a mile away and flicks through midwicket for four"
"and again, full and straight. Just a nudge into the midwicket region again for one"
"full and wide outside off, left alone, nice change in line"
"wow, he got so much behind that? Didn't seem like it. It's full and straight again, Dickwella brings his bottom hand through the line and hits the ball over mid-on. Wanted to go over midwicket"
"131 kph, swinging away. Full outside off, Dickwella runs down, looking to get underneath it and go over cover, but doesn't make contact. Beaten on account of that swing"
"good length outside off, not quite wide enough to cut, but Tharanga gets enough behind the stroke, finds point though"
"full and straight, the first one on the stumps from Junaid, worked to square leg"
"119 kph, slower ball, and straight, skewed off the inside half into the leg side"
"yeaaah. An exhibition of fine hitting, not just in Paarl. Short and wide outside off, Tharanga watches the ball onto his bat and guides it past backward point. Played that intentionally late to hit the gap"
"135 kph, full outside off, pushed back to the bowler"
"oh my. Tharanga in some form. Full delivery outside off, he leans forward and caresses the gentlest of awesomely-timed drives between mid-off and cover. Deee-lec-table"
"that's not a very good option. A slower ball outside off, Dickwella tries to AB de Villiers a scoop over short fine leg, but misses and gets struck outside the line. Stand up and play if it's the sixth over"
"stand up and play like Tharanga. 26 off 19, nothing forced. Full and wide, swinging away, driven through mid-off and cover again. Three, such good timing"
"strays down leg for a wide. Sri Lanka going very well here, how long can these two make it last?"

"full and wide outside off, 132 kph, left alone"
"full delivery outside off, 135 kph, it's closer and fuller and Tharanga tries to drive, but the ball jags away late to take the outside edge, down to third man for one"
"nice change in length. A bouncer outside off, actually a wicket-taking delivery to an impulsive batsman who can't bail out of an upper cut. Dickwella sways away though"
"a slower ball on off, driven back to the bowler, who picks up in his follow-through and chucks a bouncer to Sarfraz, right in the middle of the pitch, softening the ball up"
"short again, a shoulder-height bouncer outside off. Dickwella's pull goes right through the line, sends it over midwicket for a couple"
"134 kph, full and wide outside off, driven into the off side. 40 runs off seven overs, fine start"
"Sarfraz again with his negative body language. A decent bouncer, but it goes over the batsman's head for a wide. Dejection all around for Pakistan."
"slower ball around off, pushed away towards mid-on"
"good length on off, 129 kph, Tharanga brings his wrists into a whip to midwicket"
"on a length around off again, good comeback this. Nudged to midwicket"
"slightly short and Tharanga picks the length early, races back and pulls past midwicket for three more. Not great timing but good enough"
"good length outside off, moving away, nudged down to third man. Good choice of shot"
"129 kph, outside off, driving length. Driven sweetly to extra cover. Nice timing"
"shimmies down to the pitch, gets there before it pitches and drives to long-on. Riskless shot. Quality"
"84 kph, flight outside off, driven with the little bit of spin to cover"
"strays down leg, off the pad, towards the keeper."
"93 kph, strays on the pads again, worked towards backward square leg"
"quick and straight, on middle and leg, off the inside edge towards square leg"
"fine end from Tharanga. Flight outside off, he opens up his stance and then his bat face, all this to find the gap to the right of cover, and not hit the ball to him. Finds the gap, finds four"
"superb. 132 kph, that won't help Sarfraz's mood. Good length outside off, tapped towards cover for a quick single."
"hit the seam? That jagged away prodigiously. Good length outside off, pitches and seams away to leave Tharanga's bat hanging"
"and again, this is actually good bowling. Full delivery outside off, shapes away, leaves the bat where it is."
"<strong>a bit naughty from all parties.</strong> Good length outside off, slashed towards point. Tharanga wants one, Dickwella doesn't. The fielder at extra cover picks up and consumes time he doesn't have, by the time he throws the ball back in, Tharanga has made it comfortably, but the throw misses by a distance anyway at the batsman's end"
"good length outside off, hit into the off side"
"whippy flick finds mid-on. Full delivery outside off, crisply nudged. No gap, no run"
"full outside off, 133 kph, tidy start, off the outside half of the bat down to third man. A half-push"
"full and wide outside off, crisply hit to the sweeper cover for a run."
"nicely played. I said before it was a wicket-taking delivery, but Dickwella's execution this time is great. Short outside off, an upper cut goes right over slip. That could so easily go straight to third man, running in"
"full and straight, worked to mid-on"
"138 kph, goes right through and Sri Lanka lose their first! He is a skiddy bowler, a full delivery outside off - fourth-stump channel. Dickwella seems late on his shot. Firstly, he is standing back to a delivery he should have been forward to. Secondly, because he is late on the ball, the bat comes down at an awkward angle, from gully, not slip. The ball takes the inside edge and clatters into the stumps."
"full delivery outside off, left alone. 139 kph, zip in his delivery stride"
"short and wide, too much width, slashed behind point for a run. Good fielding from Hasan Ali to keep them down to one"
"superb shot from Chandimal. On a length, but drifts on the pads. Chandimal nicely flicks this through square leg, didn't overhit or fall over"
"134 kph, good length around off, skewed towards fine leg, off the inside half of the bat. Sarfraz wants Raees to keep it there"
"slightly loose. 128 kph, full and wide, Tharanga leans into the stroke and uppishly drives to deep point"
"full delivery outside off, 129 kph, defended into the off side"

"on the pads, nudges it away to deep square leg"
"good, quick single with Chandimal blocking a good length ball into the covers with soft hands"
"<b>oooh</b>, he's been beaten for pace by the allrounder. Might perhaps have stayed low too. Tharanga sees a short ball and prepares to pull it, but without much room, and with it skidding through, he's done in"

reads the offcutter out the hand and tickles it around the corner to deep square leg

"<b>spears in a yorker</b>, and it's a doozy too, tailing in rapidly. Good on Chandimal to whisk his toe away from the line of fire and plant a straight bat down on it"
"bouncer to end the over, Chandimal avoids it"
"the line isn't quite perfect, and Tharanga exploits it with a clip off his pads behind square leg"
"now a full toss, which Chandimal drives to long-off."

"gently turns a straight, good length ball away to deep midwicket"

"back of a length on off stump, Chandimal blunts it"

enjoys a low full toss and moves to his fifty with a drive to long-off. A gentle wave of the bat to the dressing room and a hug from his partner. Good innings so far
well bowled. The line is perfect - around off stump - and he drags Chandimal forward as well. Flick behind square leg for a single
"some turn, which Tharanga eventually uses to his advantage. He'd planted his front leg in line with middle and manages to bring his bat around it for a single to midwicket"
""
"goes wide of the crease for a flat, but full length delivery on off stump. Chandimal defends it warily"
"nice drift, getting the tossed up ball to angle into middle and leg. Chandimal, realising he is being made to hit against the turn, does so cautiously for a single to long-on. Much better over from Shadab."
covers the line of a 132 kph delivery on off stump and pats it to point
"exhibits a drive again, but the excellent line Ashraf is bowling, coupled with the slowness of this pitch and Sarfraz's captaincy, means those orthodox shots end up finding fielders"
"uses soft hands to try and pinch a single behind point, but the fielder is a bit too alert for that."

"finds the gap past the right of the midwicket, helped, of course, by a half-volley on leg stump"
"<b>he's not read the googly again</b>! In the last game, it was a loopy delivery, drawing the cover drive. Here it is rapid. Drawing out the cut shot. And the moment the ball pitches and breaks in at the stumps, Chandimal would have been fearing the worst. Luckily for him, the ball just about evades its target. <b>Sensational bowling</B>"

works a good length ball on off stump to short midwicket
"back of a length and outside off, chops it to point"
"Sri Lanka are forced to take these risks, and this time it pays off, with Tharanga putting mid-off under pressure and the fielder, in his rush to get rid of the ball, fumbles it altogether. Zaman the culprit"

"rises with the bounce of the ball, while backing away so he can dab it down to deep third man"

"whips a full toss to the left of midwicket, who could probably have done a littler better to stop the ball from beating him"
"<b>huge appeal for lbw</b> as Chandimal sweeps. It's not given, but Sarfraz is confident enough to go for <b>a review</b>. It is the wrong 'un from Shadab, he lines it up outside off, tosses it up to bring the batsman forward. Chandimal indulges in a little lap sweep and replays seem to suggest contact between ball and glove. Umpire Kettleborough is asking for a zoomer to ascertain that and then says, 'Thank you, UltraEdge shows the ball has just brushed the glove, and stay with your original decision'."
"sweeps the first ball - tossed up outside off - to long leg. Sri Lanka bring up their 100. The first fifty came off 54 balls. The second, off 91."
"<b>some turn</b> as he goes around the wicket, and fires in a quicker ball on middle. Tharanga just about prevents himself from playing against the turn."
works a good length delivery - much slower this time - to midwicket
"steps out, but Hafeez is wise to that, pulling his length back and making sure the line is outside off. Chandimal is forced to adjust and block"
"pushes it through on off stump, and Chandimal, staying back because of the trajectory, has to hurry into his flick"
"neat little shot, through the gap at midwicket's left"
"that's the <b>googly again</b>! And for the second match in a row, Chandimal has played all around it. Given out lbw, but he's reviewed it. Beautiful bowling from Shadab again. Tossing it up, and luring the batsman forward. Chandimal plays for the legbreak, the bat beside the pad, which is perfectly in line with off stump. Umpire Kettleborough in action again, he sees clear daylight between ball and bat and ball-tracking shows it is hitting in line and will be crashing into middle stump"
"pushes it through, just outside off, Kapu blocks"

"slog sweeps and sends it soaring away to the long leg boundary. A little bit of air from Hafeez, coupled with some room to free the arms. Kapu picks both up very early and punishes the bowler for his crime"
"on middle, Kapu expects that, after the bowler gave away a boundary giving room outside off, and turns it to deep square leg"
clips a tossed up delivery outside off to midwicket
reaches out to the flighted delivery outside off and drives through extra cover
taps a full delivery on his pads to midwicket
good length ball wanders down the leg side and is penalised for that
"he's holed out at deep square leg! He's played such a good innings, subduing his instincts, preparing himself for as long a haul as his team would need. But then on comes this tripe - a short ball, and it's sliding down leg too. How could he let such an offering go? So he pulls, and pulls hard, only for the top edge to result and sail right down the throat of Fakhar Zaman."
"the googly again, but its length is terribly short, the consequence of his wanting to bowl it very very quick. Thirimanne gets off the mark with a push to long-on"

"129kph, slices a length ball outside off to point"
"gets this shortish delivery to cut back off the seam and cramp Kapu, who just about blocks the ball"
"that's a lollipop return catch. He keeps striking in the middle-overs, and by doing so, he's become the top wicket-taker in 2017. Too much bounce. Far too much bounce for him to pull off a flick shot. He did <b>hit the ball twice</b>, the leading edge lobbled up towards the bottom half of the leading edge, which carried it to the bowler. And to get that with an old ball, on a slow pitch, is really really special. Not sure he cares about any of that as he settles under the leading edge, takes the catch and then pulls off that celebration he so loves, throwing something to the ground, and mimicking an explosion"

"Sri Lanka imploding, their house has caught fire and is collapsing. No one seems to have the equipment or the wits to prevent the blaze from spreading, leave alone put it out. Siriwardana has taken a bucket of fuel and thrown it in. It's short outside off, Junaid cleverly goes wide of the crease. Siriwardana, instead of soaking the pressure, chooses to release it with an ill-advises swat. It wasn't short enough, or straight enough. The ball hits the outside half of the bat and lobs to mid-on. Help yourself to a wicket. Wrong shot selection"

"82 mph, good length on off, a thick inside edge into the pad, towards square leg for one"
"heaved away into the gap at midwicket. Short on off, sits up for Thisara to swat through midwicket. The deep midwicket fielder runs to his right but has no chance"
"chipped into the gap at midwicket for two more. Another good short ball, slower delivery, takes the top edge of Thisara and plonks"
"in the gap again, for more. Great cameo this from Thisara. Short down leg, following Perera, who sits back and swats it away into the gap at midwicket for four"
"oh my. That's lazy from deep midwicket. Another short, slow ball, Thisara will eat those up all day. Sits back and swivels into a pull. Deep midwicket runs to his left, gets there but falls over the ball. Aich."

"full and wide outside off, jammed out. Well done from Gamage, end of a fine spell from Hasan Ali"
"fine effort from Imam. A short, slow delivery on middle, Thisara looks to bludgeon this through long-on, but the ball skews off the outside half of the bat. Imam runs back at cover, dives but can't get there"
"great fielding from Raees. And the Sri Lankan innings is done. It's a fine yorker on leg, all Thisara can do is skew that away towards midwicket. Raees runs after it, aware that Thisara wants two, chases it down, slides, gets up quickly and returns a quick throw to the keeper on the bounce, who takes off the bails to find Thisara a foot short."
"good length ball on middle and leg, defends"
<b>beats the outside edge</b> as the new ball kisses the deck and darts away under lights. Imam chases it and is left wondering why he bothered
"<b>past the edge again</b>. Another peach, pitching on off stump and moving away off the seam, past the left-hander trying desperately to block"
"good plan, teasing him with a couple outside off and then darting the next full and straight. Imam falls over while trying to flick - his mind already worrying about the ball that will angle across him. Half a shout for lbw, but that would be going down leg"
"width on offer and Zaman flays at it. No connection. This is a really good first over from Gamage. He also had the good sense to ask his slip cordon to come up a couple of paces on this slow, low pitch"
"back of a length on middle, Zaman tries a flick, but is hit on the thigh"
"sweetly struck, but straight to midwicket. He should feel good having taken care of an inswinger, aiming to pin him lbw without the slightest fuss"
"gets behind the line of a shortish delivery on middle, taps it to the right of midwicket and gets off the mark"
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
stays beside the short of a good length delivery and pats it to cover
keeps out a good length ball straightening against the angle on middle stump
whips a short ball off his hips behind square leg. Sweet timing
"full on the pads, 137 kph, should have been put away but Imam misses out. Struck on the pad. No appeal as it pitched well outside leg stump"
"full and wide outside off, Imam flashes at that, but fails to connect. Just a bit tentative, understandable of course"
"doesn't miss out on this one. This one starts straighter, and drifts on the pads. Imam flicks him through deep backward square leg. Fine leg tries to get across but can't haul it in"
"full and wide outside off, 128 kph, Imam flashes and the ball goes right down the throat of a Test-match type gully, but it's not a Test. Flies through that vacant region, four"
"full delivery outside off, 129 kph, the ball takes the inside edge en route to square leg"
"full delivery outside off, driven to mid-off for a quick single. 84 mph. That's good running"
"full delivery on off, not much swing. Defended back. At this time the other night, Pakistan's seamers were getting substantial lateral movement"
"good length around off, 137 kph, Imam watches the ball onto his bat, guided towards point"
"short down leg, 141 kph, off the pad. Imam hurried for pace there"

"shortish length, straight, fantastic lines, off the inside edge towards square leg"
"131 kph, dances down, but that one swerves away. Imam can't prevent himself from having a naughty flirt. No kiss of the outside edge"

"full delivery outside off, 136 kph, driven away into the cover region"
"good length outside off, swerving away again, the ball beats another thrashy drive"
"full delivery around off, 136 kph, inside-halved towards midwicket"
"spoils the maiden with another charge. That's Imam's first ODI six. Races down, meets the away-going delivery early enough and the ball flies off the outside half, over backward point. Wide enough from third man too."
"shifts around the stumps to aim at top of off, but Zaman redirects it to cover"
"141kph, back of a length on off stump, Zaman blocks"
lobs off the thigh pad as Chameera works hard to deny any room to the free-flowing left-hander. Single towards square leg
gets squared up a bit as he defends a good length ball outside off. Chameera bowling over the wicket to Imam
crisply hit towards the midwicket boundary and the timing on that flick is good enough to get three.
"races down the track and swings wildly - points to Chameera for creating such pressure that Zaman has to take such undue risks but he doesn't get any reward. The good length ball, aimed at the stumps, sails over it and even eludes the wicketkeeper"
tries to cover the line against a good length ball angled into off stump from around the wicket. Gets a leading edge towards point with Gamage deriving just enough seam movement off the pitch under lights
"short, wide, and he smashes it to smithereens. Presses forward, then shifts his body weight back and lashes the poor delivery where its meant to go"
"width again, but this time the cut shot comes off the bottom of the bat and goes straight to cover"
punches a shortish delivery on middle and leg to mid-on
"full and outside off, he squeezes it out to mid-off"
taps a short of a length delivery on off stump down the pitch
"offbreak to start, from around the wicket. Zaman shuffles across and flicks through midwicket"
"shortish and outside off, carves it superbly towards the third man boundary. Waits ever so long to make sure the placement is absolutely perfect"
"<b>appeal for a stumping</b> as an offbreak darts past Imam's forward defence. He does well to keep from overbalancing. But in doing so, there are split-seconds where his heel is off the ground - the smallest of split seconds as well. That's why umpire Kettleborough is watching so many replays. Imam has made sure he is behind the crease, and he's done enough to convince the third umpire to give him the benefit of the doubt"
"good length ball on off stump, defends"
skips across outside off to flick a short delivery to deep midwicket
"nearly swings himself off his feet, and yet the connection is pristine. Zaman races down the pitch and smashes a tossed up delivery over long-on"
"short and wide, Imam will feel he's missed out there. Well timed cut, but it's close enough to point for him to dive to his right and stop a boundary"
shifts outside off to get on top of a short ball and pull it down to deep square leg
"<b>inside edge</B>, but it slithers past the stumps and it takes a brilliant effort from Dickwella, diving to his right, to stop it leading to runs"
"full and outside off, lashes it away to third man. Not quite intentionally though"
gets in line with a good length ball outside off and blocks
"full on off stump, mistimes to cover"
"short and wide, Zaman's cut finds cover point"
"slower through the air, and straighter in line. But Zaman continues putting pressure on Sri Lanka's trump card, lunging forward and sweeping the ball fiercely to the square leg boundary. Great shot."
hacks a flatter delivery on off stump to long-on to bring up the fifty partnership. Good start for a new combination
full toss on the pads - the legbreak gone wrong - Imam whips it away to deep midwicket and they pinch a second
"another legbreak, which Imam clips to square leg"
"loopy legbreak on off stump, Imam reaches it on the full and finds a single wide of long-on"
back of a length and way outside leg. Imam doesn't need to bother with those
lets a short delivery come to him just outside off and rides it down to third man
"good bouncer, right over middle and off stump. He forces Zaman to take evasive action, which is also well done. Keeps his eyes on the ball all the way and sways out of the line"
"and that's the real danger ball - the one after the bouncer, which is usually full and teasing. Zaman chases after it -
 with absolutely no feet - and is lucky not to nick off."
tucks a shortish delivery on off stump to the left of mid-on
"back of a length on off stump, turns it through midwicket"
"attempts to pull a ball that is both slower in pace and not quite short enough to get under. As a result, he gets hit on the body"
presses forward to defend a tossed up delivery on off stump
<b>big turn</b> as he spears in a good length ball on off stump and makes it dart miles past the outside edge
"<b>dropped</B> by the wicketkeeper, I think, and Ultra-Edge confirms it. Poor Dananjaya. He delivers the perfect offbreak - tossed up, teasing the left-hander into coming forward and then making him reach away from his body. Lovely, sharp turn. The rest is up to Dickwella, and though he has several grabs at it, he isn't able to cling on"
"well done this time, collecting the fuller delivery that makes a mockery of Imam's decision to step forward and block"
steps out of his crease to push a full length delivery on middle and leg to mid-on
"steps out, making room in the process, but Dananjaya follows the left-hander, cramping him and making sure he can't get under the ball. Zaman can only steer it to point"
"fuller delivery on off stump, defends"
"bouncer, on middle and leg, Imam ducks under it"
"nice shot, taking a length ball on off stump and flicking it down to long leg"
"change of pace, but its on the pads, so Imam can glance it down to long leg, if only off his thigh"
"digs it in, but in doing so, misdirects it down leg."
"takes on the short ball with a pull, doesn't quite time it though and has to settle for a single to square leg"
"back of a length on off stump, runs it down to deep third man"
"steps out, getting to the pitch of the offbreak, and driving it hard to short cover. A misfield allows him to get a couple"
lunges forward to block a good length ball outside off
"<b>ripper</b>! He knows there is spin in this pitch, and gives it a proper rip. And a good length ball, angled sharply into middle stump then rags away past the outside edge"
"presses forward, eager to get close to the pitch of the ball, and blocks"
"tentative, shaping to perhaps sweep, but with the pace being quicker, he realises he wouldn't be able to get down and so blocks with soft hands behind point"
"good length ball on middle, Zaman defends"
"neat little glide to deep third man and all that effort from Chameera bowling a sharp, short ball outside off works against him"
chops a shortish delivery to point
"full and outside off, skewers it through the covers"
works a slower ball on off stump out to deep midwicket
"short ball, pulls it fiercely to deep midwicket."
"excellent bouncer. It is off pace at 125 kph, but it rises towards the batsman's badge, and it is right over middle and leg stump. Imam does well to keep his eye son the ball and only at the last moment sway away. Good technique"
"short and wide outside off, turn, but that's too short. Zaman can go back and cut to the sweeper cover"
"78 kph, flight on leg, Imam runs down and drives to wide mid-on. Two quality singles in this over already, both through great footwork"
"slower on middle and leg, Zaman comes down and inside-halves this to midwicket"
"79 kph, more flight on leg, driven to long-on. Fantastic batting, just what they need"
"ooh, almost planted that front foot too far, quick on off, a thick inside edge to square leg comes to Imam's rescue"
"that's a weird shot. Races to the pitch, gets there and looks to hit the ball over long-off. On the bounce to the fielder, lucky he did not time that"
"hammered. Flight outside off, 52 mph, creamed to the sweeper cover. Better shot, playing it along the ground, eliminating risk"
"86 kph, quick outside off, spinning in, played into the leg side"
"dances down, the exuberance of confidence, drives to wide mid-off for one"
"89 kph, tries to paddle sweep, but showed his hand too early, Vandersay fired it wide outside off, making the shot tough. Paddled to square leg"
"the googly does it. Sri Lanka strike. Not sure why that shot was required, he was doing it nicely. Vandersay tosses up that googly outside off. Zaman sees flight, runs down and doesn't bother about improvising once he sees the ball wide outside off. When you are in that awkward position - out of your crease, the ball in line with the keeper, intentionally bowled, the least you should do is attempt to improvise - close the bat-pad gap, anything. Zaman doesn't try, he lets his instinct take over, which is to bludgeon the ball, all in or back home. The googly spins past the edge, and Dickwella does the rest."
"90 kph, Vandersay has a stride of confidence now. For a legspinner, that's imperative. Quick outside off, the ball spinning away and beats the bat. Babar is beaten, Dickwella takes off the bails, but all good. The third umpire confirms."
"shot! Flight outside off, Imam runs down, gets to the pitch and shovels a drive over mid-on. Fine stroke, the risk reduced because he got so close to the pitch"
"quick down leg, pitched outside and hit the pad. Not out says ump Ravi"
"would it have been close? <strong>Out by a distance had Siriwardana hit</strong>. Worked to short midwicket, Azam is strolling outside his crease, not sure why. The throw misses the stumps and the fielder backing up, one overthrow"
"flight outside off, played into the leg side"
"expertly played. Gets to the pitch, once he's there, he can manipulate the field as he likes. He opens the bat face late to hit the ball past cover"
"47 mph, on the pads, worked away to square leg"
"overpitched on middle, driven to long-on. Too full. Imam on 49"
"looks to work this flighted delivery into the leg side, off the leading edge towards point"
"<strong>big appeal from Dickwella, nothing from the bowler</strong>. Quick outside off, Imam misses a flick, struck on the pad well outside the line"
"<strong>fifty on debut</strong>. Imam is pleased. Flight outside off, he stays low and drives to the sweeper cover to get to the landmark. That will free him up slightly"
"quick on the pads, nudged into the leg side"
"good single. More flight on leg, driven away to mid-on for a quick single. Makes it easily"
"flight outside off, worked to midwicket"
"quick on the pads, and a tad short, worked to square leg"
"shortish outside off, 80 kph, watches the ball onto his cut, finds point"
"flight on middle, driven to cover, who dives to his left"
"lovely length, draws Imam forward, who wanted one but the length meant the ball had a chance to spin past the edge so he closed up, and defended, something Zaman did not do"
"shortish and wide, slashed past cover for a couple. Picked the length early, let his hands do the rest"
"slow outside off, draws Babar forward, but the legbreak rips past the outside edge"
"it seemed like Babar read that one yesterday. Short on middle, Babar hurries back and pulls past midwicket"
"short and wide outside off, carved into the ground, towards point"
"another fine shot from Babar. Flight outside off, driven past cover for a couple. Chandimal at sweeper cover cuts it off. Babar wanted three"
"more flight on leg, driven to mid-on. Imam gets sent back"
"short on off, Babar goes back and clips the ball to a square short fine leg"
"another nice shot, shimmies to the pitch, gets there, opens the bat face and drives past cover for a couple. Very Imran Farhat-technique, no?"
"full on leg, driven to mid-on"
"don't miss that. Quick and straight, Imam flicks through square leg for one"
"overpitched on leg, driven up to long-on for one"
quick but drifts down leg for a wide
comes down again. Now he is just showing off. Gets there and drives to long-off
"the googly or the legbreak? Not sure because it did not turn. Went on, so slow that Babar had plenty of time to go back and push to long-on"
"quick and straight, full, Babar prods it back"
"eeks, that looked ugly. Runs down to the pitch and heaves a drive to midwicket, who parries to mid-on. Babar and Imam are running on ice, somehow they both run into a crease"
"the slider, the flipper? Quick outside off, defended into the cover region"
"that was the googly outside off, Babar gets forward and defends. Not sure he read that"
"short on off, Babar goes back and punches past point for a couple. Easy brace there"
"flight outside off, 85 kph, driven back to the bowler"
"76 kph, flight down leg, nudged down to short fine leg"
"tossed up on middle, skewed away to deep midwicket. Looking to hit the ball too hard currently"
"fine stop. Flight outside off, driven towards mid-off, but cover dives to his right to save a run"
"flight outside off, in Babar's arc and boom, smashed through cover for four. All along the ground, great timing. Placement exquisite too. That's just form"
"short and wide outside off, slashed to the sweeper cover"
"quick down leg, 57 mph, worked away to deep midwicket"
"he seems to be reading everything. Comes down again, the googly, Vandersay knows Imam is coming down. Driven uppishly, but just short of the sweeper cover."
"short on the pads, worked to deep square leg"
"the googly, he's reading them beautifully. Must be those glasses. Goes back and works the ball to midwicket, so much time"
"quick outside off, driven back to the bowler"
"superb! Read that again. Short on off, the ball spinning back in. He goes back and cuts the ball, from middle stump, past backward point for four."
"chips down like he owns Abu Dhabi, gets there and works the ball past midwicket for two. All control. Sri Lanka nowhere near"
"flight outside off, driven towards long-off, who fumbles the ball somehow and allows the second"

"shortish on off, Imam goes back and works the ball through square leg for a couple. Making facing wristspin look easy"
"short and wide, sits up for Babar to chop to mid-off. Played it too early."
"short outside off, Babar uses as straight a bat as possible to drive to the sweeper cover"
"not great timing. But it was good shot selection. Full around middle, Imam comes down and lifts the ball right back over the bowler's head. Trickles into the boundary, but very safe, especially because he wanted to go straight"
"short on off, worked down to fine leg"
"126 kph, short and wide, hammered to the sweeper cover for one."

"picked his area. But horribly timed. Flight outside off, runs down, and shovels it over mid-on for two."
"ooh the slider. It is one of Zampa's strengths, making the batsman think that a short ball is a loose one, then it just keeps going on quickly, pulled to square leg."
"flight on middle and leg, defended"
"another one, may have been from the front of the hand or the flipper. Nudged to midwicket. Nothing getting past Imam"
"chopped on! Babar's amazing run in the UAE is finally broken before hundred. Full and wide from Gamage, Babar drives, bat well away from the pad. It may be the slow pitch or Babar's good form taking him to the ball earlier than he should have. Either way, the ball hits the inside edge and hits the stumps."
"fine stroke first up. Full and wide outside off, hit to the cover point fielder"
"good length outside off, left alone nicely"

Pitches just outside off, cuts back into him sharply, takes a little bit of the inside edge and goes through to Dickwella. Sri Lanka start celebrating, <b>but wait, there's more drama.
