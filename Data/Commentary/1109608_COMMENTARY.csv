"wrong'un first up. Stretches out and defends, manages to overcome some extra bounce"
"bam. Down the track to another wrong'un, flighted outside off, and gets to the pitch to flat-bat it hard to the bowler's left"
"down the track again, and that's given! Doesn't get anywhere near the pitch this time, Dananjaya saw him coming and bowled a flatter, shorter googly. Jabbed at it with hard hands, and the appeal was for a bat-pad catch at short leg. Pandya reviews. Looks like it might have turned past the inside edge and just lobbed up off the front pad. Pandya survives. They check for lbw as well - it says umpire's call on height, and it also says he was more than 3m down the pitch. If it's umpire's call, how is it not out? Unless the umpire made some sort of communication that he was giving it out caught and not lbw. It was also umpire's call for impact, whether or not it was in line with off stump. I'm really not sure about this one."

punches this length ball back to the bowler
"this time, he's picked out the man at deep midwicket. Walked across the stumps to fetch the pull, this was a slower delivery so he had to force the pace. Hit it well but found the fielder. Pandya has a look of disbelief, as if to say 'how did I find the fielder.' His father is a picture of disappointment in the stands. <b> The Dananjaya drop doesn't prove costly, after all </b>"
has he feathered this? Yes he has. Two in two. Looks to arch back and glide this short ball over the keeper's head but the lack of pace has done him in. Just ends up being a straightforward catch to the keeper. Rohit started walking  immediately. Double-strike for Sri Lanka courtesy a man with wonky knees.

"squeezes this full and wide delivery to the man coming in from deep extra cover, excellent running"
slices this full and wide delivery to point
"right into the blockhole, Dhoni squeezes this straight hit to long-on. Dhoni wanted the second but Pandey sent him back, perhaps realising he wouldn't make it in time. Good work by Thirimanne. <b> 100 partnership up </b>"
"whips this full delivery to midwicket, <b> there's a half-century for Pandey. </b>"
"gets this to nip back in quickly. Skidded back at 138kph, Dickwella chops this down to third man. Good start"
"excellent short ball, at 139 clicks this one. Munaweera goes back onto his toes and fends that one away"
"Play and a miss. Looks to back away and slap this over cover. Thakur shortened his length, this one nipped away off the seam as well."
beauty of a delivery. Jags away off the deck to beat Munaweera as he looks to push at one away from the body
"back of length delivery outside off, punched to Axar at short cover"
off the mark with a lovely backfoot punch. Stood tall and got into good position as he pierced the gap in the off side
whips this length ball on the pads to the deep backward square leg boundary. <strong>Had the Jayasuriya stamp all over it</strong>
"excellent comeback. Angles a full delivery across Dickwella, who is beaten. Drove outside the line of that delivery"
tremendous! Nothing wrong with the delivery. Length on middle and Dickwella brings his bottom hand into play to whip this over midwicket. Superb timing
"full and swinging down leg, even Dhoni can't get across in time to stop that. Five wides. Bumrah was looking for a yorker-length delivery perhaps"
"slower length ball that stops on him just a touch, defended without  hassle though"
"looks to ramp this away-going short ball over the cordon, but the ball moved away late to beat the bat"
"slower delivery floated across the right-hander, eased down to square third man"
"short-arm jab, that has rocketed to the square leg boundary. Walked across the stumps and rolled his wrists over the delivery. Sped away"
"floats this full and across the left-hander, too wide. Bowled at 144kph"
that is a brute of a delivery. Hit the length area on off and just reared up on Dickwella. Whizzed past the edge. <b> 148 kph on that one! </b>
"sees the batsman looking to back away and fires this wide outside off, left alone"
"<b> first ODI wicket for Shardul. </b> Not the kind of delivery he would've liked to get it, but he's off the mark nonetheless. Skiddy length ball on leg stump and going further down, Dickwella looks to tickle this fine but the ball brushes his gloves on the way through to Dhoni. He's good with his reviews. Raveendra Wimalasiri was the umpire in question."
"excellent follow-up delivery. Gets this to curve away just a wee bit from off stump, Kusal is solid in defence"
beaten again. Played with minimal feet movement
"snakes in a length ball that nips away off the seam from off stump, defended"

"off a thick inside edge to square leg, Rahul fires a throw at the striker's end but missed"
"slower delivery in that off stump channel, left alone"
"edged, down to third man. Flew off the blade as he played inside the line"
goes for an expansive cut but can't get any bat to it. Didn't have as much room
"late on the stroke again. Looks to stand tall and force this off the backfoot, chopped to Dhoni off the inside edge"
beaten! Gets this to zip away off the deck from length around off. Looked to smack that on the up
"driven on the up, down to Rahane, the substitute fielder, at square third man"
hops back into the crease and whips this length ball to deep square leg
beaten! Looks to drive on the up but the ball deviated late.
"<b> KL Rahul with a direct hit at the bowler's end from point. </b> Kusal Mendis had given up. Terrible, terrible mix-up. This was bunted to point, Kusal was halfway down the pitch when he turned back. In all fairness, Munaweera was never really thinking of the run and said no immediately. Kusal has paid the price for his error in judgment."
superb timing. This flies off the bat. Rahul gives it chase from point and pulls it back. Delightful backfoot punch
"angles a length ball on middle from wide of the crease, defended"
appeal for lbw but this was going down leg. He was overbalanced as he looked to work this with the angle
"angles in a fuller delivery on the stumps, eased to mid-on"
"back of length delivery on middle and leg, worked off his hip to square leg"
"angles a length ball across the left-hander, defended confidently by Thirimanne"

hops back and across as he defends the short of length delivery back down the pitch

"lofted through the line, clears mid-off. Not off the middle but he'll take the runs anyway"
"back of length on middle and off, Munaweera is right behind the line as he blocks"
looks to pull but the ball slides back in to hit him on the right thigh. Kept a touch low as well
mistimes this hit through the line to mid-off
"angles in a short of length delivery on middle and leg, Munaweera is on the hop as he looks to tickle this fine and gets a faint glove on it through to Dhoni. So another review that has gone in India's favour. Munaweera's inglorious debut is over. Looked to play a shot at every delivery, didn't connect half of those."
"full and just on middle, shapes back in a touch, Thirimanne gets a thick inside-edge to mid-on"
works this length ball off his hip to midwicket
"beaten by a beauty! Left him late. Thirimanne played away from the body, poked at that. This one nipped away off the seam"

"short of length outside off, this keeps a touch low, steered to point"
"skiddy short ball on middle, Mathews avoids that in the nick of time. Was looking away, not the best technique but it works for him"
edged but just short of Rohit at second slip. They take a run as it wasn't stopped cleanly
"bouncer on middle, Mathews avoids it again"

"width on offer, punched to sweeper cover"
sways out of the way of that short delivery outside off

"slower and fuller on off, drives the low full toss to long-off"
"drifts in a full ball on middle from wide of the crease, eased to deep midwicket"
"driven back to Kohli. He's bowled all deliveries full and straight. The pace is down, maybe he's trying to trade that for accuracy"

"gives him the charge but Pandya bangs it in short and across Thirimanne, who can't get any bat on the pull"
"floats this full delivery on middle and leg, worked behind square on the leg side"
"whipped into the gap at deep backward square leg. Short and into middle and leg, lovely flick of the wrists. Bisected square leg and short fine"
"again beats the man at short fine leg. Tripe delivery. Short and sliding down leg, helped along nicely"

"length ball on middle and leg, clipped into the square leg region"
"back of a length on off stump, defended into the covers"
"short, some width too, but an uncertain shot from Mathews. Could have gone after it with the square cut. Elects to poke at it instead, no footwork, and the ball beats his outside edge"
"length ball on middle and leg, tucked to the right of midwicket for one"
"shortish, angling into the body as he shuffles across. Tucks it off his hip through backward square leg"
"bouncer, and Thirimanne hooks it all the way. Climbed up quite steeply, towards his front shoulder, but he swivelled quickly and middled it. Went in the air but safely to the left of fine leg"
"and he's gone next ball! Not a wicket-taking ball by any means, short and wide, but he slashes in the air, and only a few yards to the right of Dhawan at deep point"

"back of a length, the googly turning in towards off stump, goes back and blocks into the covers"
"flighted ball on leg stump, gets his front leg out of the way and drives back to the bowler"
"nicely bowled. Slows it up and tosses it up outside off. Goes for the drive but doesn't get close enough to the pitch, and doesn't pick the googly. Rolls into the on side off the inside half of his bat"
"short, a bit of width, and that's nicely punched away, gets onto his toes to place it to the right of backward point and a long way to the left of deep point"
"again some width, this time he goes at it with more of a flat-bat stroke, hits it in front of square to the man at deep point"
"lovely. A slower ball outside off, quite full, and it also swings away from Mathews, who drives away from his body and misses by a long way"
"digs it in short, outside off, and Mathews does well to drag his pull from there, get on top of the bounce, and beat the man at deep square leg to his left"

"tossed up wider, stretches out to play a sliced drive towards backward point"
"speared in flat, angling down leg. Misses the flick and the ball rolls off the outside of his pad towards short fine leg"
"again, onto the pads, clipped to square leg"

"straighter now, whipped away to deep midwicket"
"length ball sliding in towards middle stump, clipped through square leg"
"tossed up full on off stump, almost a yorker, jabbed into the covers"

"fuller now, clipped to deep midwicket"
"length ball on middle and off, defended into the off side"
"dangled up wide of off stump, driven to point with an open bat face"
"a bit of inward drift, dip and then turn towards off stump. Defended towards backward point, and then he thinks of taking a single. The fielder comes in, picks up and flicks underarm to Dhoni, who coolly deflects the ball onto the stumps with his glove, but he was safely home"
"back of a length outside off, chopped towards backward point"
"flat, slanting into middle stump, shuffles across to work it through square leg"
"flat again, close to off stump, goes on the back foot to punch into the covers"
"goes slightly fuller with his length, presses forward to dab into the point region"
"flat and full, angling into middle and off from wide of the crease. Gets forward to block into the off side"
"not full enough to drive through the covers, and the inward angle forces him to flat-bat it back towards the bowler, who stops it with a dive to his left"
"a shot in anger after a bit of a lull. The length is similar to the previous ball, but the line is a little closer to off stump, and he slog-sweeps over wide mid-on. Didn't quite middle it, but cleared mid-on quite easily and then beat his attempt to chase back and stop the boundary"
"lovely flight and dip, pitches on middle and spins away sharply. Nowhere near the pitch to drive inside-out, and he checks his shot and sends it slightly uppishly into the covers"
"ripper. This one pitches on that beautiful length again, on off stump, and is quicker this time. Spins away sharply to beat his defensive push"
"a touch shorter now, can go back and punch to sweeper cover"
"shortish, turning in towards the pads as Mathews goes back and across, clips towards short fine leg, who stops it with a dive to his right"
"looped up slow outside off, swept to deep square leg"
"googly, pitching on middle and turning away from Mathews, who stretches out, reads it well, and defends back to the bowler"
"flat, angling down leg, Siriwardana can't connect with the paddle-sweep"
not short enough for that forcing shot off the back foot. Makes room and the ball beats his outside edge
"this one is short, on off stump, and he rocks back and pulls to the square leg boundary to bring up the fifty partnership"
"flat on the pads, clipped to deep midwicket"
"length ball wide of off, driven on the up and the man at point dives right to stop it"
"length ball on off stump, driven back to the bowler"
"and again. I think he was playing for turn, looking for the drive to long-off, but it didn't turn, and he ended up hitting it back to the bowler off the inside half of the bat"

"flat length ball angling into off stump, defended to short extra-cover"
"length ball wide of off, and again, the angle and length ensure Mathews plays it back to the bowler rather than drive through the covers. May have stopped on him too"
"fuller, on the stumps, clipped to long-on"
"full on middle stump, clipped to midwicket"
"flat, angling down leg, tucked away to long leg"
"flicked for six! Didn't middle it, but got enough on it to clear the midwicket boundary and hit it far enough to the right of deep square leg. The angle, from round the wicket, and the full length, enabled that shot"
"he's been expensive today, but he's picked up a second wicket. Or has he? They're checking for no-ball, and it looks like he has juuuust enough heel behind the line. A good ball, on a good length, wide enough outside off to invite the drive away from the body, and then straightens just a wee bit to kiss the outside edge"
"greets him, predictably, with a bouncer, but the line is well down the leg side"
"another bouncer, again down the leg side, and Hasaranga just watches it and lets it go through to the keeper"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended into the point region"
"another bouncer, this one doesn't quite slide down leg, but it bounced pretty high. The square-leg umpire gives it the benefit of doubt. Definitely welt over shoulder height, and maybe over head height too, as Hasaranga semi-ducked under it"
"back of a length outside off, dabbed to backward point"
"back of a length outside off, straightens slightly. Watches it well and guides it down to third man"
"flat, back of a length, slides on towards off stump, makes himself room and stabs to the right of backward point. Looks like a bit of a mix-up, and Hasaranga is slow getting to the keeper's end, but he's home by the time Dhoni gets the bails off"

"tossed up outside off, driven to extra-cover"

"length ball, slightly wider, plays nice and late in defence, bounces to the fielder at wide slip"

"length ball close to off stump, gets on the front foot to push to the left of mid-off"

"slider on off stump, chopped to short third man"
"too much flight and he's played the slog sweep to perfection. One bounce into the midwicket boundary. Fetched it from outside off but there was no turn, so it wasn't all that risky"
"steps out and swipes this back over Axar's head, smashes into the sightscreen. Saw the ball fired wide, got closer to the ball and smashed this away"
driven through the line to deep cover
"into the gap at wide long-on. Too predictable from Axar. Fired full and wide, right in the slot for the slog sweep. Hit right off the middle"
"<b> he's out by a distance. </b> This was hit towards mid-on, Hasaranga was far too down looking for a non-existent single, turned just as Bumrah ran in quickly and fired the throw. Even then, the run-out wasn't a guarantee. But Axar did well to stop the rocket throw and deflect the ball onto the stumps. <b> It wasn't even his call. </b>"

"can't put this full toss away. Angling away again, looked to steer this wide of point but was late on the shot"
"beaten on the drive. Not much feet movement, just throwing his bat that that half-volley. <strong>A slightly better batsman would rue missing out on a boundary ball</strong>"
"swept fiercely into the square leg boundary. Fired in again, fired away by Mathews. Did well to get outside the line of the stumps and put that away"
"reward finally, but not before he's been carted to all corners of the park. Axar does well too, tosses this up nicely, bows it much wider too, which meant Mathews had to reach out to slog this across the line, he tried to but ended up getting a toe-end of the bat as short third man gobbled up the top edge. Axar's reaction tells you he's had a bad day and not even the wicket of a quality batsman is some balm."
