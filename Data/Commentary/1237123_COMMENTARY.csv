"tight line, good length on off stump, just a hint of shape back into the right-hander as Bavuma lays a solid bat on the line of the ball and pushes the single to mid-off"
"<B>jaffa!</B> Such a good line, no pace to speak of, but hits the seam on a perfect length and darts back inside the edge, missing off stump by a whisker"
"thumped on the up, through the line again, and in the air through the covers. de Kock keen to free his hands as the sweeper gathers"
"jabbed past point, riding the back-of-a-length ball on off stump, another good run as Rashid gathers at third man, and they pinch an extra run on the overthrow"
"tip and run into the covers, full length again, and good awareness from both batsmen. No risks but plenty runs"
"opens the face as Curran pushes this one past the off stump, and another well-judged single to third man. No fireworks, but both batsman feeling bat on ball in that over"
"back of a length, Bavuma rises to his full and not entirely substantial height to ride the bounce and pick the single to cover"
"very full length, wide of off stump, de Kock leans into a full-faced drive, gathered with a tumble at mid-on"
"squared up a touch on the back foot, 146kph, as de Kock hops into line for the straighter one, and has more time than he thinks as the ball comes off the deck slowly"
"hoicked around the corner, not especially short, but de Kock hangs back, and roundhouses a miscued pull to square leg. When he connects, those ones go..."
"slower ball, right up in the blockhole, and Bavuma waits and waits, and jabs down into the crease"
"<b>wheels!</B> Short and straight, Bavuma sways as this one fizzes through to Buttler. 140kph on that occasion, not his quickest, but more than sharp enough on that line"
"swivel-pull as Curran bangs in his surprise bouncer. He gets good lift from his skiddy line, forcing the batsman to reach for it"
"well played, de Kock waltzes inside the line, and heaves a cross-batted lift over backward square, picking the slower ball and nailing it!"
"<B>outstanding batting!</B> Quicker from Curran, quicker from de Kock too, who shuffles across his crease once more, waiting for the ball to pass his torso, and hoists it even higher over backward square!"
"back of a length, dabbed out to point for another single"
"<B>Bavuma's turn to contort his stance!</B> He got out to this stroke on Friday, but got it spot on this time, dancing across to the off-side, flapping his bat over his bails as the ball gets up, and flinching it high over the keeper's head!"
"a flashy pull, but safe enough, doesn't get full hold of it as the ball dribbles safely to the leg side. Expensive over from Curran, and South Africa are up and running"
"patted firmly out to deep point, two men give chase"
"down on one knee, and<strong> flogged firmly through the covers! </strong> Good-looking shot, but wasn't actually nailed, came right off the toe but found the gap anyway"
"tighter line and fuller, Bavuma squares up to defend on the back foot"
"<B>ping, next batsman please!</B> Full, straight, a nothing delivery in so many ways, but sharp pace, on a stump-threatening line, generally does the trick if the batsman gets it wrong! Bavuma was aiming towards the floodlights at wide long-on, but missed it entirely, and England have their opening!"
"tight line once more, rising on an off-stump line, solid block"
"banged in short, and that's a fierce head-hunting end to a successful over. Archer is in the mood and it's been a fascinating four overs already"
"full length outside off, rolling his fingers first-up as de Kock scuffs a drive to cover"
"TC gets similar roundhouse treatment! Waltzing inside the line once more, and though it's spliced rather than nailed, the shot loops over Archer at short backward square and dribbles to the rope, eluding the sweeper"
"crashed with intent once more, on the up through the leg side, picking Curran off his length but gathered by the sweeper"
"flipped off the legs, and that's a fine way to get off the mark. Too straight from Curran, and all he needed to do was lay bat on ball, with no-one back on the rope at fine leg"
"up on the toes again, patted to deep cover"
"hitting down on the ball as Curran bangs it in a touch shorter, and picked up at backward square"
"round the wicket, thumps a length outside off, and de Kock needs no second invitation to wipe his bat across the line, hoisting a pull over midwicket!"
"<B>walloped through the line, doesn't get hold of it, and TC takes a tricky chance!</B> That came right off the toe as de Kock lined up the meaty lofted drive, but was confounded by Jordan's subtle change of pace. There was a lot of work for mid-on to do, however, as he back-pedalled in the breeze and clung on high above his head, reaching back!"
"tight line, solid block, into the off side"
"rolls the wrists, back of a length on an off-stump line, flinched to the on side"
"pressed firmly off the back foot, right under the eyeline, and dabbed into the covers"
"line and length on off stump, worked to midwicket with another roll of the wrists. That's a fine introduction from Jordan"
"shaping past the legs, half an appeal, mostly to negate the wide"
"tapped to the on-side, out to midwicket"
"an ambitious wiped pull, and somehow that ends up nearer slip than deep midwicket. Off the back of the bat maybe? A bit of turn confounding Hendricks' ambitions"
"works the single to the leg side, just milking Rashid for now"
"down on one knee, looking for the mighty mown six, but he clothed that one, out to wide long-on, mostly along the ground"
"a compact drive, into the covers, to complete a typically frugal over from England's leading spinner"
"back of a length, tapped out to cover, off the back foot, a hint of shape on a tight off-stump line"
"back of a length, off-stump line again, a wiped pull to deep square leg, timed too well to get anything more than a single"
"more solid contact, a firm back-foot punch to deep cover. All very conventional so far in this over"
"slower ball, wicket-to-wicket line, du Plessis hops across his stumps and taps to backward square"
"drilled into the covers once more, Stokes hitting a solid line and length with a bit of kick off the deck"
"attempted pull to the back-of-a-length delivery, but Hendricks can't connect properly as he swivels in the crease"
"leaning back, flogged to wide long-on as Rashid serves up a regulation legbreak"
"leaning forward this time, head over the ball and driven into the gap into the covers"
"more intent in this stroke, but Hendricks doesn't pick the googly as he winds into a down-on-one-knee pull and under-edges to the leg side"
tucked out to midwicket off the back foot
"reverses the hands, as Rashid fires in a flatter, quicker ball, and waits well on the stroke, patting it like a pinball paddle through backward point"
"<B>done like a kipper!</B> That's an exceptional comeback from Rashid. His 50th T20I wicket in his 51st game. Hendricks lined up the slog-sweep, but this ball was too good for him, dipping late on an off-stump line, and biting the top of the timber with good over-spin. England keep chipping away, and another decent SA start comes to an abrupt end"
"<B>flicked with insouciance over midwicket!</B> Now that's some timing, du Plessis was back on his stumps, pre-meditating the stroke, and plinking it off a good length"
"open face, guided to backward point"
opens the face to guide his first ball past third man
"banged in short, rising over the shoulder, down the leg side. Stokes is miffed, but that's fair enough"
"angled bat, into the covers, as Stokes reverts to line and length"
"slower ball, good length once more, and drawing a delayed pull to midwicket"
inside-edged drive as Stokes finishes with a fuller length. A decent recovery in that over after the early boundary
"<B>easy peasy pickings!</B> That was exquisite from Rashid, drift into the right-hander, late dip, grips the pitch, beats the edge, into Buttler's gloves, and off come the bails with du Plessis's back foot dragged fatefully out of the crease!"
".. and not a bad one either! Tight line, full length, urgent block, and just about kept out"
"punched on the up, into the covers, probing line from Rashid"
"driven with a bit of bottom hand, Klaasen was clearly working across the line of that one, which could have been fateful. Instead he gets off the mark as short cover fumbles"
"patted out to point, leaning onto the front foot"
shuffles across the stumps to nurdle the single to the leg side
"width to free the arms, but cracked fiercely straight at short cover"
"similar intent on the drive, meeting the ball right at the top of the bounce, but Morgan at short cover is in business again. Two frustrating dots for VDD"
"hoicked to the leg side, slightly straighter line"
"wafted to the off side, opening the face but can't get it past point"
"sliding into the legs, as vDD walks across his stumps to clip the single behind square"
"back of a length, hitting the deck hard and gathered at deep midwicket. An excellent over from Jordan, a whole load of nothing hittable"
"back of a length, sharp legbreak to keep the batsman honest. A shimmy at the crease and punched uncertainly past mid-on"
"clobbered through the wider line, short cover was in business for a second, but the sweeper at long-off tidies up"
"faster and flatter, a bit of bite off the surface too, and jabbed uneasily past the vacant slip"
"freeing the arms once more, a firm drive into the covers, but straight at the fielder"
"drift down the leg side, and a rare blemish from Rashid. Klaasen lined up the sweep, but his presence confounded Buttler, who couldn't gather"
a languid drive into the covers. SA might need a bit more than languid soon to give themselves a defendable total
patted into the off side to complete another probing over
"line and length, rolling the fingers as vDD defends his stumps"
"flicked to square leg, pace off once more from Curran"
"hitting the deck hard, a good bouncer in terms of the line at which it reached the batsman, who had to wait to pull off his eyebrows to the leg side"
"<B>flipped to midwicket and TC has his man!</B> 116kph this time, a bona-fide back-of-the-hander ... the spirit of Jade Dernbach lives on! Stokes is on hand as Klaasen is confounded, wafting a nothing shot across the line to leave South Africa in ever deeper doo-doo"
"round the wicket, flipped over backward square to get Linde off the mark"
"dangled on a good length, angling into the left-hander and never quite reaching him. A good over at a good time for England"
"full length, flicked to long-on, as Stokes at slip loses his hat at the moment of delivery! Archer didn't notice and the batsman obviously wasn't watching, so on we go..."
"<B>thumped on the pads, and this looks tight!</B> Round the wicket from Archer, but that's sliding down ... Morgan and Archer aren't tempted by the review, and rightly so"
"nudged into the gap to keep the runs flowing... well, dripping"
"a pleasing crack of willow as vdD belts the wider ball on the up, but the cover sweeper limits the damage"
"into the ribs, and nurdled to midwicket"
"hits the deck hard, rising into the torso, a swishing pull to deep midwicket, and the end of another fine over"
"right up to the pads, worked to the on-side with a flick of the wrists"
"back of a length, tight line, flogged out to point from under the eyeline. Singles aren't going to cut it forever"
"round the wicket, blockhole ball, Linde attempts to flick to the leg side, but finds a fat outside edge to backward point"
"a flowing drive, head over the ball, but all very conventional as deep cover gathers again"
"fired rather wildly past the stumps, the body, everything"
"over the wicket to the right-hander, hitting a good length as vdD drives back at the bowler"
"flashed hard to deep cover, this is just fine for England. South Africa are trapped in first gear for the moment"
finds the single once more ... England will settle for that
"whittled off the pads for another single... other than misdirected wides, boundaries have been notably scarce"
"angled bat, jabbed down to third man"
"yorker. Perfectly served up from round the wicket, and very well dug out to be fair, dragging his toe out of the firing line. But nothing doing there runs-wise"
"back of a length, sharp pace, Linde hops into line to defend"
"bouncer, too short and wild for the umpire's liking"
"a flashy splat of bat outside off, but once more, there's a lack of finesse to unpick Archer's quality offerings. South Africa are sinking fast"
"right up to the pads, scuffed to the leg side. Yep, it's another single"
"very wide line from round the wicket, a touch unlucky as the ball skims past the guideline. Think Archer's first ball of the World Cup super over!"
"bottom-handed aggression but can't beat the man at mid-off, hitting through a very full length from TC"
"back of a length, open face, pushed to point"
"<B>finally, some true intent!</B> Curran aims wide again, and this time Linde is ready for it as he misses his length, a swingeing slap through the line, and past the cover sweeper! SA's first boundary since the 10th over"
"<B>suddenly, Linde is on it like a bonnet!</B> TC hits the deck outside off, and Linde is waiting for it, back in the crease, moshing a pull onto the grass at wide long-on!"
"fuller length, under the eyeline, an open-faced drive to backward point and that's the over SA needed"
"<B>a precious boundary first-up!</B> Not a lot wrong with the ball, a blockhole ball from round the wicket, but Linde opened the face well and squeezed the edge through two men behind square"
"flipped to the on-side, a low full-toss, excellent running, pushing for the second from the outset and making it well with a dive"
"chipped off the pads once more, finds the gap on the leg side"
"right into the blockhole, good areas from Jordan, poked out to the off side for another single"
"driven, reaching for a ball that never quite arrives, another single into the covers"
"knee-high full-toss, drilled hard to mid-off, where a fumble from Stokes persuades them to push for a second and a third as Stokes loses his footing in his haste to make amends... and that's a fatal decision! The chase, the shy, the gather ... the decision! Jordan whips off the bails with Linde well short, after a battling knock"
"low full toss, and <B>Archer hesitates fatefully at wide long-on!</B> The wind held the shot up, and in the end he had to bail out and gather it on the bounce"
"<B>a full toss into the body, and he gets away with it!</B> Looks good as a dot ball, but that was cue-ended as vdD swung through his shot too soon"
"flapped to the on-side, hitting through the fuller length. A decent start to this death over for TC"
"round the wicket, and that's perfection from Curran. Nailing the wide yorker, from round the wicket, inches inside the guide-line. Can't hit those"
"another wide yorker, but this one comes out as a full toss, and it's battered hard on the up through the covers! Looks as though it'll be cut off on the edge of the rope, but Jordan's stretch can't claw it in. Not the best effort by his high standards"
"a wipe through the line, misses everything, including the leg stump. Buttler shies off-balance as they scamper the single, and that's the end of that"
"<b>nearly nicks off in identical fashion to Friday!</b> Flat and skidding on outside off and Roy wafts at it unconvincingly first up, so close to feathering another edge!"
"fired the wicket with the arm in from round, that's a leg-side wide"
"pushed on to the legs and Roy nurdles this fine, via his pads"
"darted on leg stump and Roy makes room, gets an inside edge off an ungainly hoick"
<b>carted through backward square leg!</b> Too full from Linde and he's swept forcefully past the man on the edge of the ring
tossed up and nudged towards midwicket
"uses the feet, Linde is on the pads again and Roy forces one more out to the leg-side sweeper"
"length ball, pushed leg side, there's a noise on the way through... just flicked the thigh pad, I think"
"fullish, 141kph/88mph and Roy feels for it, thick-edges to short fine leg and they scamper through"
"angled in on the stumps, Buttler calmly tickles his first ball into the midwicket region"
"on the stumps, little legcutter from Rabada and <b>Roy gets a looping leading edge into the covers!</b> Still scratching around, is Roy"
"length ball, dabbed down towards backward point - <b>Buttler would have gone with a direct hit!</b> Bavuma was the fielder, he swooped and threw in one motion but the ball bounced over the poles with Buttler barely in the frame!"
"<b>hoicked over backward square leg!</b> In the air but he clears the leaping fielder, first boundary of the day for Buttler"
"full toss, smacked on the back leg - and given! Roy is hopping around in some pain, but asks for a <b>review</b> just as the clock times out. This looked to be missing leg stump, to me, struck him right on the back ankle; no bat involved but yes, ball-tracking says it is going well down. So the <b>decision is overturned</b> and Roy gets a life"
"length ball, <b>151kph/94mph from Norte</b>, calmly defended on the front foot"
"pitched up, fullish on off and this is punched into the covers coming forwards"
comes forward and taps into the off side
"<b>dropped!</b> Dug in and Buttler splices a pull, only for Rabada to shell it diving to his right at mid-on! Did the hard work and got there, only to make a mess of the catch"
"banged in short and Roy miscues a pull into the pitch, back to the bowler"
on the stumps and flipped into the midwicket region for a single
"fullish length, 139kph//86mph and Roy clubs it down the ground in disdainful fashion, luckily for Ngidi there's long-on back"
"<b>creamed through cover!</b> Murderously fast hands from Roy, making room to carve the ball from off stump and through the infield for a boundary"
"short of a length, swung leg side but he picks out midwicket"
dug in and Roy fails to get hold of his pull once again
"slower ball, pushed down the leg side"
"<b>skier and gone!</b> Luck has finally done one for Roy, who throws back his head immediately after connecting with a hasty cross-batted hack! May have been pace off again, but it foxed the batsman one way or another, looking to belt this over the off side but sends a dolly to Klaasen on the cover circle"
"length on the pads, <b>147kph/91mph</b>, Malan squirts this into a gap at midwicket"
"seaming in a fraction, Buttler whips it through midwicket from an off-stump line"
"touch back of a length, 144kph/89mph and Malan clips this to square leg"
"full-blooded yorker, right on the toes and Malan digs it out with a straight bat"
"<b>151kph/94mph, struck on the body!</b> Malan tries to duck and takes the blow! Thought better of pulling and instead he's going to have a purple patch on his left shoulder in the morning. Woof!"
"short and nasty again, <b>150kph/93mph</b> and this cops him a blow on the box! Right in the meat and potatoes, Malan looks even more discomfited by that one! Fiery over from Nortje, keeping England right on their toes"
"back of a length, Malan takes on the pull off Ngidi, manages to swivel it for one"
"slower ball on a length in the channel, Buttler advances and crashes a cut to point"
"short outside off, Buttler swings hard across the line and misses"
"<b>edged past short third man for four!</b> Opens the face on it, the ball racing away as Ngidi squeals in frustration"
"<b>smoked through point!</b> Easy pickings, 130kph on a length outside off, and Buttler mows the lawn"
<b>slashes another four off the outside edge!</b> Width on offer and Buttler rides his luck with a thick edge wide of the keeper!
"tossed up from round the wicket, <b>reverse-swept for four straight up!</b> Reaches out and guides it past the man at short third man"
lobbed up on the stumps and nudged into the gap at midwicket
floated up full on off stump and Buttler pushes out for one
"fligted, wide of the stumps and it grips, Malan gets an inside edge attempting to drive"
"pushed through, straightening on the stumps and worked through the leg side playing back"
tossed up and Buttler attempts to reverse the hands but only manages a swipe to backward point
looped up and worked into a gap
"dragged down and Buttler whirls on a pull,<i> smashed</i> but can't beat Hendricks on the rope at deep midwicket"
"flighted, worked off the pads to leg"
"<b>bowled 'im!</b> Shamsi's done for Buttler with a beauty! Tossed up and then spinning sharply, Buttler tried to come down but was nowhere near as he aimed a mighty hoy down the ground... Huge roar of delight from the bowler and SA have a big wicket there!"
"flighted from over the wicket, Bairstow sits on a forward defensive"
"tossed up straight and this is nudged off the pads, Shamsi gives chase in his follow through"
"pushed through flat outside off, not timed on the cut"
"flat, quickish, YJB bottom-edges a swipe going back on off stump"
darted down and this one is pinged past point for a single to the sweeper
"floated up wide of off, Malan attempts to reverse-sweep again, misses out this time"
goes back and across and chops one through the off side
pushed through outside off and Bairstow guides one more to the deep cover boundary
"<b>goes for the big hit but holes out to deep midwicket!</b> Shamsi strikes again, England's MoM from the other night gone! Bairstow clearly looking to dominate once again with the ball spinning in, but he doesn't nail the shot and presents Hendricks with a simple catch. This. Is. On"
"flattish stock ball on off stump, drilled down the ground to long-off"
"gives this a bit more air, Malan pokes to the on side and Shamis runs down after it"
"tossed up, stays low outside off as he swipes through mid-on for one"
"length ball spinning away on off, Stokes chops it down to long-on once again"
"flighted, wide of off and Malan cuts, just a single to the sweeper"
"tossed up full outside off and Malan slashes at it, <b>close to being bowled off the inside edge!</b> Just spins back past off stump!"
"steps out, <b>pings this over extra cover and away!</b> Nicely done, Malan picks up only his second boundary, running away wide of the fielder at long-off"
pushed through and this is cut into the turf towards point
"over the wicket, fired in and Stokes tucks it leg side, Linde gives chase towards vacant midwicket"
"round the wicket, on the pads and clipped out to deep midwicket"
"<b>reverse-slapped over backward point!</b> Think Stokes against Lyon at Headingley 2019, though not as clean a connection... still bounces away to the rope for another four, 11 off the over for England"
"flighted, straightening on leg stump, tucked for one"
tossed up on the stumps and tapped to leg
"length ball on middle and off, shows this a straight bat"
"trapped on the crease, did it straighten enough? Not for umpire George, but SA <b>review</b>, they'll need it to be turning quite sharply having pitched on or around leg stump. This could be close, but it's <b>umpire's call</b> on impact and hitting the stumps! So Stokes will survive"
tossed up and punched through mid-on
floats this full on the stumps and Malan breaks the wrists on a nudge through square leg - tidy over from Shamsi
"shortish outside off, Malan runs one down to third man off the back foot"
"banged into the deck, Stokes rides it towards backward point"
"shuffles across early, slower ball from Rabada and Stokes shovels it through backward square leg"
"short ball, angling across and Malan gets his pull off the toe end, ricocheting down into his boot"
dug in and this is swatted confidently through square leg for one
"fuller, 139kph/86mph and whipped leg side without timing, midwicket cuts it off"
"<b>blootered over deep square leg!</b> High into the blue and landing on the grass banks, Stokes unleashes, starts the over with a six"
"tossed up slow, Stokes slog-sweeps again.... <b>but this time a top edge loops gently to the left of de Kock for a simple catch!</b> Goes big, then goes home, Shamsi with his third, cleverly moving his line slightly further across towards off stump. SA tightening their grip on a grippy pitch"
pushed through outside off and Morgan swipes at it unsuccessfully
spins sharply as Morgan cuts and finds the man at cover
"on the stumps, pulled through midwicket for Morgan's first run"
tossed up on the stumps and nudged off the pads for a scampered single
"short ball, sits up outside off, Malan pings a pull to mid-on"
short ball and this time he eases it away through midwicket
"<b>monstered over deep midwicket!</b> Just a half-tracker from Ngidi really, rather than a proper bumper, and Morgan blasts it flat for six!"
"dug in, pace off and wide of off stump, Morgan waits for it and ramps down to third man"
slower-ball bouncer and this one spins away fiendishly as Malan sits back and misses with a late dab
short and wide and <b>carved for four through backward point!</b> Pace on and he likes that
"back of a length, 140kph/87mph outside off and Morgan dabs at it and misses"
"fullish and whacked down the ground, bouncing in front of long-on"
<b>belted through the covers!</b> Misses the yorker and Malan rifles it between two men in the covers for four more!
"cutter from Nortje, Malan is back in the crease, <b>clumped over midwicket!</b> Picks it, slams his pull into gap, back-to-back boundaries"
"short of a length outside off, guided down off the back foot"
"pitched up and Morgan crunches a drive to cover, 'Nooooooo!!' the call"
"short, 144kph/89mph and angling across, Malan cuts past the infield but it's just one to the sweeper"
"back of a length, cross seam and pace on as Morgan attempts a delicate late cut, fails to connect"
"dug in shorter, 143kph/88mph and skidding past the attempted ramp this time! Two dots in a row for Rabada"
"back of a length, worked down into the leg side for a couple, helped by a misfield from du Plessis"
"full in the slot, <b>kippered through extra cover!</b> Missed the yorker and Morgan makes room, <i>smashes</i> it between mid-off and cover"
"<b>gets the ramp away this time!</b> De Kock leaps but can only get fingertips on it! Morgan hits back with consecutive boundaries, and England get their 10"
"round the wicket, pitched up and chipped over the covers, wide of long-off for two"
"<b>lummoxed to the rope at deep square leg!</b> Steps across early, picks his spot and shovels a short ball away!"
"<b>and the luck is with England now</b>, sliced wide of the keeper for four more! Big ole heave at a wide-ish ball and he gets away with a thick edge"
"<b>DOWNTOWN!</b> Malan smokes this sweet and straight for six! May have been a slower ball but he stepped out and climbed into it - <b>brings up his fifty</b>, from 39 balls, and England are favourites now!"
"<b>goes big but this won't clear the man at long-off...</b> Hendricks jumps to take it above his head, stumbles back but tosses the ball up calmly to then recross the rope and complete the dismissal! Superb stuff from the fielder, and Malan is done. But the RRR is down to a run a ball"
"fired wide of the tramlines, the batsman watches it go and takes the extra"
"pitched up and dinked down the ground, Morgan will keep the strike"
full and wide and Morgan slashes an outside edge down to third man
"back of a length and Curran jumps across, drops it for one into the off side... SA a bit slow to react there"
"round the wicket, pitched up and Morgan steers it through point for another single"
"digs in the bouncer, Curran goes for a full-blooded pull and fails to connect"
"pitched up on the pads and deflected behind square, Morgan wants two... but thinks better of it"
"edged but it goes England's way again... <b>flashes past de Kock for four!</b> Keeper was going leg side as Morgan opened the face on a jab that flew to his left, beyond the fingertips and away for a boundary that quite possibly seals the game!"
"round the wicket, good length and Curran swipes at it unsuccessfully"
"<b>dragged on to his stumps!</b> Curran fails playing conservatively, looking to run one behind square but only finding the inside edge, the bails dislodged. Can they stuff it up from here...?"
"back of a length, flipped off the pads and Jordan hares up and down for two! Fine leg had to race up and the batsman was too quick"
"banged in, he ducks the bumper"
"<b>short and shovelled over square leg, England clinch it!</b> Jordan puts recent experience with Kings XI Punjab out of his mind and swats the winnings runs!"
