"oh, what a catch by Karun Nair at first slip. That is a stunner. They are checking if the catch is clean. Soft signal is out. That's pretty close. Nair gets down to his left with his hand outstretched. He takes it fine as he gets his hands to it but he just appears to have let the ball drop to the turf as he gets down. Does he have his fingers underneath? This may take some hard looking at before the third umpire decides. Not out is the call.Coming to the delivery, it was full, and angling across.
