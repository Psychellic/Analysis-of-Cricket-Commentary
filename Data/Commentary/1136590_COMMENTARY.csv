"all action first-up. <b>Inswinger from Trent Boult. Not given. Iyer reviews</b>. Good length and snakes back in, Watson plays around his front pad - like he has done for the most of his career - and is pinned below the knee-roll. Pitching in line: check. Hitting the stumps: check. The tracker returns three reds. There was an inside edge but bat first or pad first? There is no conclusive evidence to overturn the on-field not-out call. This was really tight but Watson survives in the end"

hustled for pace. This cut back in from length to beat the inside edge and hit him high on the thigh pad. There was a stifled appeal but this was going over.

"full and angling away wide outside off, Faf reaches out for the ball with his hands and carves it away fine of deep third man. Beats Avesh to his left in the deep"

"good length and zipping into the pads from around the stumps, the ball is skipping off the pitch, deflected away to fine leg"
"deft touch from Watson. 142.7ks, back of a length and outside off, Watson uses the pace of Boult to his advantage and glides it to the left of backward point for four"
"pretty full and zipping through outside off at nearly 143ks, Watson has a big drive at it and only collects fresh air"

"short and skidding into the leg stump, turned to square leg for one"

"hip-high short ball outside off, you've got to get it up higher, Mr. Plunkett. Watson lines it up and pulls it disdainfully over the midwicket boundary. Bam!"
"very full and veering into the pads, Watson picks it up, twirls his wrists and lifts it over midwicket. He exploits the short leg-side boundary, again"
"good length on off, tip and run to mid-off"
"on a length and outside off, but Faf had jumped across off even before Plunkett had delivered. Merrily scooped away fine of short fine leg. <b<Twenty off the over</b>"
"on a length and outside off, sticks in the pitch, dabbed to point"
"Watson has top-edged it and fetches a six. Chest-high short ball outside off, Watson can't get on top of the bounce. He swings his hands at a pull anyway and skies it to Mars. It drops down beyond the wide long-on boundary"

"good length and angling into the pads, twirled away through square leg"
"overpitched and outside off, Faf backs away and belts it straight to the covers"
"140.5ks, short and angled into the body, Faf is tucked up for room. He miscues a pull but does it fine of short fine leg to close out the Powerplay with four. <strong>Just like that CSK have taken 31 off the last two overs</strong>"
"full and wide outside off, Watson stretches out and slices a single down to third man"
"Faf ventures outside leg, slogs to leg, ends up toe-ending a single to mid-off"

"back of a length on off, leans back and punches down to wide long-on"
throws his hands at a fuller one outside off and drives uppishly to sweeper cover
that's going to be a no-ball. Du Plessis pulls this high full toss into the hands of deep midwicket who doesn't have to move an inch. But that's well over waist height
another full toss but he can't maximise the free-hit. Shovels at it but without a lot of timing it only goes on the bounce to long-off
"full, a little too wide of him, and he slashes and misses"
"another fuller ball, du Plessis heaves it over the extra cover region and it lands between that fielder running back and long-off running to his left"
"du Plessis holes out to long-off. Not his most fluent inning, a run-a-ball 33 when the team's going nearly at 10 an over. Lofts this fuller one but the bat turns in his hands as long-off grabs it reverse-cupped"

"an ugly swipe across the line sees the back of Raina. Nicely floated up around his off-stump, and Raina is expecting it to turn away. But it simply slides in with the arm and beats the inside edge before clattering into off-stump"

Rayudu tries to slog from outside off and ends up dragging it down to long-on off the inside of the bat

Dhoni gets on top of a short ball outside off and punches through the line to the man on the sweeper boundary
"wide yorker, squeezed through the covers for one"
"dug in short and skidding into the body, Dhoni aims a pull and is caught in a tangle. He misses the ball but hares across for the leg bye even as Avesh runs in and swoops down on the ball. The throw from Avesh is so very wide of the stumps at the non-striker's end"
"low full-toss outside off, forced away to the left of long-off"

more brawn from Dhoni. Another bottom-handed jab as the bowler overcompensates and bowls it fuller outside his off-stump. Smashed over long-on
shuffles across early to a short ball and gets tucked up for room as a result as he gets a top-edge. Pulled through deep square leg
"again walks across even before Boult takes his jump. It's a length ball around middle and leg, and Dhoni flicks it away to the fine leg region"
"Rayudu takes a leaf out of Dhoni's book and walks across too. It's an attempted yorker gone wrong as it ends up being a low full toss. Rayudu doesn't quite muster up the same power as Dhoni but it's enough, nevertheless, to carry the ball to long-on"
gets down to a reverse sweep but to the wrong length. It's a length ball outside off and the ball sneaks past
"shortish outside off, gets on top of it and dabs it away towards short third man"
"another early shuffle, and Daredevils honestly aren't doing enough to make late adjustments. It's a short of a length delivery that's just too straight, and Rayudu pulls to deep fine leg"
"slower length ball at 123.1ks, Rayudu makes a little room and slaps it through cover"
"short on off, whips it away with a flat bat to backward square leg. Straight to the fielder but there aren't too many that can get one over on Dhoni when he decides to take off for a run"
"huge strike. Too full, too straight, Rayudu advances and gets right underneath it before shovelling it straight over"
now he swings blindly at a delivery outside off that's just short of a good length and gets an outside edge that flies between the keeper and a short third man that's more fine than usual
"<b>dropped</b>. Colin Munro puts down a straightforward catch. He had to move a little to his left alright, but he did well to get behind it and then just lets it pop out. A mistimed pull from Dhoni that led to all of that drama"

"low full toss outside off, walks across and mistimes an attempt at a heave to send it along the ground to wide long-on"
"full outside off, bottom-handed shovel to long-off"
"full outside off, carved away over the in-field to sweeper cover"
left alone outside off but that's perfectly legal. Well inside the line
"that's perhaps the biggest of the night. A full toss outside off, Dhoni whips it with powerful wrists and sends it soaring over backward square leg. Way, way back into the stands. Also ruins what had been a good over for Daredevils"
"walks across outside off and tries to sweep but the ball sneaks past, just past the leg stump"
"low full toss outside off, drilled to long-off"
full toss again. These are all attempts at yorkers that are going horribly wrong. Daredevils having a tough time against the best death-overs batting unit this season. Dhoni swipes and pummels it over deep midwicket
"slapped right past the bowler. Boult, predictably, shortens his length, and Dhoni steps down the track and hammers it past the bowler's left"
"<b>has that been dropped? Ok, wait, is that a runout? Yes, it is.</b> Lots of things happened there. Dhoni got a glove as he tried to pull this short ball and Pant drops it after diving to his left. Rayudu, in the meantime, has crossed over to the other end enthusiastically looking for a single only to find that Dhoni hasn't so much as moved a toe. All he can do then is sprint back to his end but then Boult nails a direct hit"

"back of a length and outside off, Munro throws his bat at the ball... and misses"
"Munro shimmies out again, this time he clears mid-on. He manufactures a half-volley by venturing out of the crease. Dragged from outside off over mid-on. Munro did not middle it but he will not complain"

"half-volley outside off, Munro clears his front leg and simply blasts it past the bowler with immense bottom-hand power"
"banged in short and angling away outside off, Munro was waiting for this length. He upper-cuts it over Watson at slip for a flat six. The ball hits the ad boards on the flush"
"The back-of-a-length ball works for Asif and CSK again. That's the right length to bowl here in Pune. Munro shimmies out again, Asif pulls his length back and attacks the body of Munro. He aims to slog it away but only toe-ends it to Karn at deep midwicket"

sprays it on a leg-stump line and Shankar whips it off the inner part of the bat past Dhoni to fine leg
