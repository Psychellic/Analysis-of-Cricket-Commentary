"on the money, on a length and nipping in, Stirling goes to punch on the offside but is a bit surprised by the extra bounce. Takes a thickish inside edge off the shoulder of the bat and rolls into the offside."
"good length on the stumps, gets behind it and defends"
"length ball on middle and leg, Hales has no foot movement and tries to hack across the line. Gets an inside edge on to pad that rolls towards gully"
"<b>castled him</b>. Wahab has been keeping it on a tight line, and Stirling cleared his front leg to try and slug it into the legside. The extra bounce from a length does him in though and he can only chop it onto to the stumps."
<b>swing and a miss</b>. Wahab's curling the all away from him outside off from over the wicket and Salt tries to biff through the line with feet static.
"length on the stumps, hoicks it to mid-on. Was looking to go more square but mistimed"
"length on off to start with, carefully patted into the offside"
"good work by Wahab at gully, who dives to his right to stop the ball. Hales was giving himself room to carve it inside out, gets a thickish edge on it that would have run away for four if Wahab hadn't stopped it"
looking to work into the legside but gets an inside edge onto pad
"quicker one on a length, patted to long-on"
"<b>up and over</b>. Down the track he comes, gets to the pitch of the ball, Mujeeb's not turning it much so he is safe in that choice of shot. Nice clean swing of the bat to lift this over long-off"
"and this time he gives himself room to slap this through cover. Made Mujeeb bowl shorter, having stepped out last ball, and sat back and waited for it, belting the cover off the ball."
"thick outside edge flies on the bounce to third man. Wider outside off and fuller, he throws his bat at it. Went finer than he intended but safe"
"that was smashed, but Umaid Asif was at the deep square leg boundary and manages to just about stop it, despite not having to take more than a couple of steps. Too short, Hales rocks back and leathers it. A foot either way and it would have been a boundary"
"length on the stumps, turned to deep square leg"
"<b>beautifully done</b>. He's in some touch is Hales. Full ball outside off, he gets low, makes his bat horizontal and angles it through third man. Despairing dive by the short third man. It wasn't a bad ball, full outside off, but Hales turned it into a boundary"
"<b>swing and a miss</b>. Slightly short of a length outside off, and he swings across the line after having moved across. Doesn't connect."
"this time he goes on the offside. This is disdainful batting. Stays still in his crease and it's a fullish length on off, he carves it over cover, opening the bat face and completing a full swing of the bat"
"fuller on leg stump, tucked off his pads, midwicket gets a hand to it diving to his left to keep them to one. Parried the ball towards mid-on. Mujeeb the fielder."
"made as if to go across and then backed away, Imran bowled a yorker on leg stump at 146 kph and Hales nonchalantly steers it to point. Great timing but straight to the fielder. No run but the adjustment made so late to a good ball, and playing it with comfort, speaks of his touch."
"length on the pads, tucked to short fine leg"
"slower ball, low full toss, has to wait on it and mis-times his whip to mid-on"
"<b>steered for four</b> and he's carving the ball to all parts now. Full ball outside off, looking for the yorker. Overpitches marginally and that's enough for Hales to let it glide off his bat to the vacant third man area"
he's expecting the yorker length so goes deep in his crease and uses wrists to flick this off his toes to deep midwicket
"length ball on leg stump, he was moving across to try and scoop this over fine leg but doesn't connect"
"<b>gets it in the gap</b>. Not the best timing but had enough meat on his pull shot. This was too short and on the stump, he tried to hit it really hard. Got the timing a tad awry but it didn't matter."
"<b>through him</b>. Slower ball, off-cutter, he was looking to go legside again with a heave, left a gap between bat and pad and was too early into the shot, and Saqib goes through that gap."
"length ball on the stumps, cramps him for room, pushed towards cover"
"length on off, softly tapped towards backward point"
"back of a length on leg stump, wanted to pull it but can only get glove on it as it rolls through square leg"
"<b>swing and a miss</b>. Length ball going across him, outside off, he wants to swat it away. Doesn't connect"
"<b>plopped straight to midwicket</b>. Faheem hadn't timed anything during his brief stay, goes back to pull this back of a length ball. It wasn't short enough though and he doesn't get it cleanly. The ball pops off the bat and towards midwicket, who lunges forward and grabs it"
Stands tall and punches this back of a length ball through cover
"Length outside off, goes to drive, gets an inside edge that rolls towards short fine leg"
"<b>Sherfane can't reach the ball at deep midwicket</b>. Banged in short again, and Shadab goes to pull, doesn't get hold of it cleanly. The top edge hangs in the air a while and Sherfane's running to his left from deep square leg. Even a dive won't get him to the ball though."
"back of a length outside off, tapped to point"
"gives himself room, goes down on one knee and slaps it through point. A bit too short outside off"
"wanted to go across and turn it fine, quicker one, raps him on the pads and rolls to square leg. Leg bye"
"length outside off, goes back and across and taps to the bowler's right"
stays still this time with the ball being a bit shorter and whips it to deep midwicket. A fumble while picking up because the fielder was put under pressure with the batsmen pushing for two. They get the second easily in the end
tossed up more outside off and Hales <b>cracks this beautifully through cover</b>. Gave himself room and unleashed a flowing drive.
"<b>mix up results in a run out at the striker's end</b>. Shadab has to go. This was quicker on a length outside off and Hales tapped it to point. Went quickly off the bat. Hales took a few steps down the pitch and Shadab responded. Hales hesitated and then Shadab hesitated. Where's the calling? Anyway, they decide to go through with the run but the throw is quick and clean and Shadab is well short."
"full on the stumps, driven from the crease. Mid-off is deep, he runs to his right and collects"
"back of a length outside off, and that's <b>stunning timing</b>. He just pushed it by opening the face a bit and the ball flew off the bat through backward point. Third man had no chance"
"banged in short on off, and he's a bit late on the pull, can only get it off the bottom half of the bat to midwicket"
"<b>direct hit results in overthrows</b>. Tapped towards point, and Imam rushes in, and flicks it to the stumps. Talat was back in his crease though and no one backing up as the ball goes through square leg"
"slower ball, back of a length, he has to wait for it and slap it to long-on"
"<b>inside edge just misses off stump</b>. He was looking to run it down to third man, gets a thin edge, it bounces down and <i>just</i> goes past off through to the keeper"
"fuller, straying on the pads, flicked to deep square leg"
"fuller outside off, comes on the front foot to drive to long-off, and they're pushing hard for two. <b>Flat throw rifled in but Talat has done really well to sprint back and make it to safety</b>. Close call but he makes it"
"<b>Imam dives at the fine leg boundary to save four</b>. Talat brings out the sweep and nails it nicely past short fine leg. Imam runs to his left, and flicks the ball back in just in time"
"fuller outside off, stroked through cover"
"length outside off, chopped to point"
free-flowing drive to long-off's left and they collect two
"length on the stumps, tapped through mid-on. Played it softly. No one in the circle so they push for two. <b>And Hales cops the throw from the deep on his left rib</b>. Painful blow. He's down on the ground."
"fuller, going across him ends up outside off, he steers it to third man"
"slower ball, straying down leg, he is too early into the glance and it takes the pad. Kamran should have stopped that behind the stumps but doesn't, so they get a leg bye"
"<b>top edge goes over the keeper's head</b>. Got to feel for Ironman Umaid, he dug it in short and got it on target, the batsman was late on it, tried to hook it, no control at all but he'll get four"
"has a thrash at that one and gets a thick outside edge to third man's left. Full and wide of off, he was looking to drive"
down the track he comes but Umaid is equal to it and manages to york him as he's giving himself some room too. Dug out to mid-off
"full on off, opens the face to drive through cover point. There's protection in the deep"
"<b>full toss whipped straight to deep midwicket</b>. Hales can't believe it. He had timed that well, but he picked out the man in the deep. Full toss on the thighs, he uses his wrists and power to whip it. Doesn't keep it down, possibly wanted it to go more aerial. It hasn't got the height or the gap and is an easy catch."
"length on middle and leg, tucked to midwicket and they sprint a quick single"
"<b>run out chance missed at the striker's end</b>. Slower ball on middle and leg, tapped softly down the pitch to the bowler's left. They set off for a really risky single. Saqib runs down and picks up. He has all the time in the world to aim at the stumps but misses. Iftikhar wasn't even in the frame"
"length ball, pushed to cover"
"length on off, punched through midwicket"
"huge appeal as he is struck on the pad going for a reverse sweep, not given. <b>and they will review it</b>. Looked close in real-time. Mujeeb from round the wicket, floated this up and it dipped on him as he went down on on knee to reverse. <b>and it's three reds so Talat has to go</b>. Fine bowling by Mujeeb, outfoxed the batsman, who misread the length. Struck in front and going on to smash into leg stump."
"given some air, spins into him, he can't connect with the attempted tuck into the legside and the ball rolls off his pad"
down the track and uses his wrists to hoick this over cover. Bounces to the man in the deeep
"quicker one, squared him up and rolls to backward point off a thick edge"
"length ball outside off, punched to extra cover"
"fuller on off, whipped to extra cover"
"length ball but too far down leg, he'll have to rebowl that."
"<b>wham</b>. Slower ball from the back of the hand, he read it, got down and slog swept it brutally over long-on"
"yorker at normal pace, driven to long-on"
"fuller on middle and leg, flicked off his pads to deep square leg"
"goes deep in his crease, lining up for a big swat across the line. The ball's not quite there for it and he ends up not timing it fully well, gets a single to deep midwicket"
"slower ball results in a full toss outside off, and he's a bit taken by surprise I think, punches it to deep point"
"full toss, crisp cover drive but straight to Sherfane at extra cover. He has a shy at the stumps and hits direct, but the batsman was in and they get an extra run from the overthrow too."
"<b>bang</b> goes Asif, the Hulk to Umaid's Ironman. Fuller length on off, and he doesn't get it off the middle but hits it hard enough with his hoick to get it over deep square leg"
"length on off, swats across the line to long-on"
"<b>beaten</b>. Good ball, back of a length and moving away off the seam to square him up and have him feeling for it. Hisses past the outside edge"
"<b>top edge lands safely</b> at square leg. Short ball, he goes to pull, can't get hold of it at all. But luckily for him, no fielder there."
"quicker one, nipping back in, he's swivelling to pull but is late on it. The ball pings him on the thigh pad off an inside edge and rolls to fine leg"
"fuller, pushed between cover and point"
"<b>and he's hit it down the throat of deep midwicket</b>. Baseball style swat across the line but he gets it off the end of the bat. Ball loops in the air and doesn't travel far enough. Easy catch, taking a few steps forward"
"back of a length going across him, he was looking to steer it fine, beaten."
"another shot not in control, tries to short-arm pull it, gets a top edge that plops down well ahead of deep square leg"
"length outside off, pushed to cover"
"flies off the outside edge to third man. Back of a length moving away, squares him up, takes the shoulder of the bat and goes"
"<b>caught at long-on</b>. Islamabad are unravelling quickly. Asif cleared his front leg and was looking to golf-swing it over long-on, gets a toe-end and the ball swirls up rather than forward. Shoaib Malik doesn't drop too many catches and he settles nicely under this."
"length ball nipping into him, punched through cover."
"length ball, carries nicely to the keeper. He was coming forward to it and is left feeling for it as it hisses past the outside edge"
"bouncer outside off, he steps away and tries to pull it, but is nowhere near the ball"
"down the track, and Umaid spots him and keeps the ball clear of off. The batsman gets a toe-end to it while looking to pull, and it rolls to short fine leg"
"back of a length outside off, took the pace off, and he had to wait for it, ends up playing it reasonably well by steering it to third man"
"full outside off, gets his bat down to chop it to point. They take a quick single, a direct hit might have been tight"
"He was looking to pull this through midwicket, it ends up looping over extra cover. Very late on the pull, and it's ball hitting bat rather than bat hitting ball"
"slower yorker on the stumps, dug out to cover"
"loud appeal for lbw is given. <b>The batsman reviews</b>. Length ball on leg stump, the question is did it pitch in line. The batsman was moving a tad, but ends up with bat away from pad as he's looking to flick while on the back foot. <b>the ball has pitched in line and it's three reds</b>. Wahab has another wicket, his fourth."
"yorker on off stump, just about misses the stumps. Fawad put his bat down more in hope than with conviction, beaten on the outside edge"
"length on leg stump, tries to clip it, and it pops up in the air. To Wahab's right though and well clear of his reach"
"length ball on leg stump, he has little clue about that, tries to swat it away, but is struck on the thigh pad."
"<b>edged behind</b> and it's all over. Fuller outside off, and he was looking to swing it over long-on after giving himself room, gets a thin but clear nick behind."
"full, enough width to drive, but Imam can't pierce the infield"
"fires in a yorker, and Imam has to jam the bat down on it. Tailed away late"
"<b>Hasan makes the breakthrough and he's fired up!</b> Banged in halfway down, Imam fluffs the pull shot, and plinks it straight to Faheem Ashraf at midwicket, running back on the edge of the ring. Hasan pulls out that trademark celebration, and Zalmi are 0 for 1..."
"length ball, aimed at the top of off stump at <b>145.7kph</b> and TKC leaves it alone. Few words from Hasan, which draws a wry smile from TKC"
"a fraction fuller, TKC digs it out towards mid-off. Hasan spits a few more words towards TKC at the end of his follow-through. <b>Feisty!</b>"
"length ball, worked to mid-on to get things up and running. Brilliant first over from Hasan"
"length ball, a fraction too straight, and TKC tickles him for one down to fine leg"
"banged in, back of a length at 142.9kph, and Akmal can't beat point with the cut"
"banged in halfway down at 139.7kph, and Akmal mistimes the pull. Loops up over the inner ring, and Ashraf gets back to pull it back"
"hits the pitch hard, 141.9kph, and Akmal works a single to leg"
"slightly fuller, skiddy length at 142.9kph, and TKC presses a single out to long-on"
"struck on the pad, <b>big shout, and given!</b> Akmal asks TKC if he should send it upstairs, and he makes the signal, but the timer has run out so he'll have to trudge off. Superb from Wasim and United. Roars of celebration. Beautiful seam position, finding a bit of movement in off the pitch, and Akmal was late on the shot. No bat, struck in front, and he's got to go"
"wide outside off stump, and just the wrong side of the tramline"
"banged into the pitch, and squeezed out towards point"
"hard length, cramping the batsman for room, and he can't get it away through the off side"
"short ball at the right shoulder, 137.3kph, and TKC dramatically dips inside the line of it at the last moment. Glare from Hasan, wry smile from TKC"
"full and straight, scamper through for a single to mid-on. 143.8kph"
"hard length, Malik defends watchfully"
"steams in, and hits a length in the off-stump channel. Malik prods awkwardly at it, and is <b>beaten</b>"
"back of a length outside off, tapped softly into the offside for a quick single"
"length, a little too straight, clipped off his pads to mid-on"
"seams back into the batsman and raps him on the pads. Wasim likes it, the umpire doesn't. <b>review taken</b>. I thought there was an inside edge on that, which is what could save the batsman. If no inside edge, that's stone dead. <b>Ultra edge confirms an inside edge</b>. Visible deviation too when the ball passes the bat. No wicket for Wasim this time."
"nipping into him again, on a length on off, jabbed to point"
"another inside edge onto pad. He's bowling quick and hostile is young Wasim. This one is coming in again, he drives away from the body and is late on it, inside edges onto pad"
"back of a length outside off, and he's left it alone"
"length outside off, squirted towards backward point"
"nice tight line around off, getting the batsman to drive, which he doesn't do convincingly, having been softened up by Wasim earlier."
"a more confident looking shot now, to another ball curling into him, but on a fuller length. Punched to mid-off with bat close to body and pad"
banged in short and good response by the batsman. Rocks back and pulls to deep midwicket. Didn't try to hit it too hard and found the boundary. That'll ease his nerves considerably
"and a quicker bouncer to follow that one, has Kohler shaping to pull but ducking quickly. 143 kph short ball which is very, very quick"
"<b>not timed but he'll get four for it</b>. Slower ball, full on off, he's a mite early into the on-drive and sends the ball more aerial than he intended. But the direction is right and it goes over the bowler's head and bounces into the fence"
"length on the stumps, turned to square leg"
and Kohler takes toll of the more friendly pace of Ashraf. Too full outside off and he leans into a peachy cover drive that purrs to the boundary
"nipping in a bit on a length but Kohler's feet are moving more confidently now, and he is well forward to meet it, punching it to extra cover"
"this one nips away from a length outside off, and he gets a thick outside edge to third man, coming forward to drive"
"length outside off, he's moving across, clips it to mid-on"
"fullish on off, gently tapped into the offside for a well-judged quick single"
"tossed up on a length on the stumps, comes on the front foot to punch to long-on"
"googly, didn't read it, went right back to defend and gets an inside edge through square leg"
"nice loop and dip on the batsman, who plays from the crease with weight on front foot. Gets a leading edge towards point as he tries to play it to midwicket"
"a little shorter, allows him to go back and flick through midwicket"
"tossed up fuller on the stumps, comes on the front foot to tap it to long-on"
"<b>lovely shot</b>. Length on the stumps, he goes back, stays beside the ball and late cuts it past short third man"
"a bit short to start with for Shadab, and he rocks back to pull to deep square leg. Came off the bottom half of his bat"
"length outside off, cuts it to point"
"quicker on the stumps, he was coming forward to defend, gets an inside edge that goes through backward square leg"
steered to short third man
"tossed up outside off, and he stabbed at it late, gets an outside edge. Salt is standing up to the stumps, so it's a tough take for him with a thick edge, goes off the keeper's thigh. Technically <b>dropped chance</b>."
pushed to cover
was looking to whip across the line but gets a leading edge to one that turns from leg and goes towards point
"tossed up outside off, steered to point on the front foot"
"googly almost goes through him, he didn't read it but manages to get bat close enough to ball in time to get an inside edge onto pad"
"<b>bang</b>. That is superbly done. He spotted an overpitched ball and went down to slog sweep. Connected with extreme power, cracking sound as the ball goes low and flat but all the way over square leg"
"better length, tossed up, brings him on the front foot to drive gently past the bowler"
"fuller on off, comes on the front foot and offers the full face of the bat, patting it to long-off. A bad throw allows an extra run"
"tossed up too full on the stumps, driven inside out through cover"
"nice loop on that one, tossed up and drawing him forward but dips on him. Malik's equal to it though and has a big front foot stride, drives through cover"
"good length, driven to short mid-off on the front foot"
"flatter and quicker on off, jabbed into the offside"
"googly, but line is too straight, pitches on middle and hits him on the pad, going down leg"
"tossed up a bit too full, clipped to long-on"
"too short, he rocks back to pull, but there is protection in the deep"
"tossed up and dipping on him, comes on the front foot but can't reach the pitch, tickled to midwicket for a quick single"
"googly strikes him on the pads. Fawad asks the question but the umpire says no. That was probably going down, but Kohler had no idea about the wrong un"
"legspinner now, pitches on the same spot on a length on middle, he stays back and plays it off the pitch, punches through cover"
"length ball outside off, nicely tapped to point's right by staying beside the ball. Quick single taken"
"tossed up fuller on off, comes on the front foot to drive to long-off"
"<b>shot</b>. He's taken toll whenever the spinners have missed their lengths. Too short this time, he goes down on his knee and slog sweeps powerfully through backward square leg"
"fuller, pushed to long-off"
"tossed up and Malik spots it and dances down the track. Gives it a good biff, but straight back to the bowler, who manages to stop it"
"tossed up, steered towards gully. He is looking for the single and is sent back, makes it back in time"
"tossed up outside off, comes on the front foot to defend towards cover"
"too short, goes back and paddl-epulls it to deep square leg. A fumble by the fielder allows a second run. Wasim there."
"fuller, nicely on the front foot to defend it back to the bowler"
"<b>boom</b>. Kohler's had enough of being tied down. Skips down the track when he spots a nicely tossed up one that is too full, gets to the pitch and drives fluidly well over long-off. Super shot"
"<b>lovely bowling</b>. That previous shot hasn't fazed him. Lovely loop on this, draws him on the front foot, dips on him and spins past his bat."
"<b>he's got his man</b>. Fawad has the last laugh. Slider on a length outside off, and he goes for another hard sweep, can only get a thin edge that the keeper grabs."
<b>wham</b>. Haider Ali skips down the track first ball and nonchalantly deposits Fawad back over his head and over the sightscreen. The audacity of youth on full display. Exhilarating shot.
"<b>nails the sweep now</b>. Stunning start to his innings by Ali. This is too full alright but he's just one ball old in his innings. Thinks nothing of it and just essays a hard sweep that he's in full control of. The man at backward square leg is not too far, but he can't get to it."
"and now Shoaib Malik joins the party. Why leave it all to the young ones? Down the track, gets to the pitch, and effortlessly lifts this over long-on"
"goes inside out this time but doesn't get hold of it. Stepping down the track again, splices it and the ball loops up but falls safely over extra cover"
"googly, half forward and he pushes to mid-on"
"length ball, dips on him, he goes back to cut it, gets an under-edge that bounces into the legside"
"length ball straying on the pads and he tickles it fine. Long chase results in the ball being pulled in, but they get three"
"quicker one on the stumps, gets his bat down in time to defend"
"bouncer over leg stump, he ducks under. Ali thinks that should have been a wide but it was marginal I think"
"fuller on off, driven to long-on"
"length ball nipping in, ends up on the pads, flicked to backward square leg"
"length outside off in the channel, pushed to the bowler's left"
"fuller but straying down leg and Ali has a full flourish of the bat while flicking it fine. Too fine for any fielder to cut, and too well hit anyway"
"length on the stumps, tucked off his pads to deep midwicket"
<b>clobbered</b>. Full in the slot on off and Haider Ali clears his front leg and absolutely slams it. Golf swing over long-on
"too short and wide outside off, cuts fiercely, but there is a deep cover in place"
"too full on the pads, flicked off his toes to deep midwicket"
"bouncer on middle stump now, and Ali ducks under comfortably"
"too wide outside off, and he'll have to rebowl that."
"<b>stunning</b>. Almost yorker length on off stump, tailing in, he clears his front leg, and gives himself the room to loft a lovely looking off-drive that goes all the way over long-off"
<b>dismissive</b>. And now he takes two steps down the track and disdainfully swats a back of length ball to the wide long-off boundary. Like he's batting in the nets and wanted to just whack the ball.
"full on the stumps, full face of the bat shown while punching to mid-off"
"back of a length outside off, moves across and gently nudges it through square leg"
"bouncer over middle stump, he saw it coming and ducked under."
"full, straying down the pads, took the pace off that one. Ali didn't read it, and was too early into his glance. The ball rolls off the pad to the keeper"
"<b>he's got him caught behind</b>. Hasan Ali gives Haider Ali a bit of a send-off. Good ball and great catch by Salt behind the stumps. Back of a length, jags away, Haider looking to run it down fine, but the extra bounce means it flies off the shoulder of the bat. Salt flings himself to his right to pluck out the ball."
"length on off, wrists it to fine leg"
"fuller outside off, and he's tapped it to cover for what should have been a quick single. <b>overthrows with a shy at the stumps at the bowler's end and no one backing up</b> bring the match to a bit of a shambolic end."
