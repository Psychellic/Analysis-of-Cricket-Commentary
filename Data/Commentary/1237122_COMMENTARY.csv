"short and wide in the channel outside off, de Kock leans back and happy-slaps it to man at the deep point"
"oh dear, that's an unforced error... attempting to scoop and <b>Bavuma gloves it through to the keeper!</b> Tried to get funky early doors and he's instead heading for an early bath (and why not? He won't have to field for an hour or so). Just a length ball in the channel but that looked premeditated from Bavuma, let down by poor execution"
"back of a length, kisses the surface and <b>flies off the outside edge!</b> Goes wide of Stokes, needed a second slip in, but de Kock's furtive glance back only confirms one to third man"

"short ball, du Plessis swats leg side... <b>but holes out to deep square leg!</b> That's a handy wicket for England, with du Plessis well set and driving the SA innings.

"punched back and Jordan grabs the ball in his follow through, lobs it at the stumps in one motion with van der Dussen scrambling... and gives up a run in the process"
"glides in and hits the pitch, 142kph/88mph and whipped into the leg side"
"full on off, Rassie heaves to leg and picks up one more to the deep midwicket sweeper running in"
"attempted yorker on off stump and van Biljon can't get under it, chopped to extra cover"
"Archer strikes, <b>the full bunger does it!</b> In the arc but Rassie can't get it out of the park, instead he miscues a swing to leg and sends it looping to deep backward square! Archer knows that wasn't his best ball, by a stretch, heads back to his mark"

"full toss once again, <b>Linde gives it some pongo over deep square!</b> Poor ball but he really dispatched it with aplomb"
"short of a length in the channel, pace off and he swings and misses this time"
"<b>bowled 'im!</b> Full and quick, 132kph/82mph and hits the base of off stump! Linde's feet didn't move and Curran brings it back <i>just a touch</I> with the final ball of the innings. Tough night for him, and that looks a competitive score"
"round the wicket, tweaked onto a middle-and-leg line and grips a touch. Roy flinches with stiff wrists, back to the bowler, on the bounce ... oooh..."
"shorter, wider, Roy flaps into a wild cut, and <B>snicks through to the keeper!</B> Another first-over dismissal for England's Mr All or Nothing ... and Linde has made his mark in no uncertain terms! Glee unbounded! And that's opened this chase up alright! He's never been at his most comfortable against spin first-up, and those hard hands paid the price!"
"tapped into the off side, leaning to the pitch"
"head over the ball, eased out to point"
"tweaking down the leg side, not the best ball, <strong>but an even worse shot!</strong> The ball dies as Malan turns his wrists, and almost scoops straight to square leg!"
"on the back foot, a compact poke to cover, and that's the end of an outstanding debut over, if not a maiden over! Now then ...this game is afoot!"
"don't think he pulled out of that one, but the shot was much the same! Beaten for pace before he'd really decided on the stroke!"
"fast and full, thudding the pads as Rabada snakes an inducker back into the left-hander. Feisty"
"anchored on the back foot, a firm thud of bat into the off side, but straight at point"
"cracked with intent into the covers, on the back foot again, half-stopped as mid-off tidies up"
"back and across, sharp pace from Rabada on a full length, and pressed out to point"
"width for Malan to rattle into a scything drive, but he picks out point again. Good shot for none as they say. But nothing wrong with the timing there"
"width outside off, Buttler slaps an upper-cut of a drive out to deep cover"
"advancing to the back-of-a-length ball outside off, thumped at the top of the bounce, but gathered at backward point"
"<strong>oops, that was a bit wild!</strong> Hendricks lost his footing, and his line, as he dragged the ball way down, banged in nearer his toes than Malan's!"
"shaping into the pads, and this time <strong>Malan's timing finds some placement </strong>to go with it! Clipped sweetly, on the up through midwicket!"
"gives himself room, but that's a fine line, rising on off stump, and eluding a flashing cut"
"flipped off the pads, and worked to the leg side"
"pumped into the covers, and another single"
"makes room, and <strong>slaps the cutter emphatically through the covers!</strong> This is an ominous start from Malan, he's easing into his night's work"
"<B>tremendous placement!</B> Compact stance, meeting the ball cleanly with a sweet chiselled drive, bissecting two fielders at cover and mid-off"
"timed once again, but straight to backward point"
drilled out to the off side for another single
"too straight, Buttler shuffles in his stance, and clips very fine through backward square. He's up and running now, as England settle into their chase"
"poked to mid-on, tight line to complete an otherwise leaky over"
"... hmmm .... we'll have that one again. A filthy leg-side wide, hardly hits the cut strip"
"<B>flogged off a full length and Buttler's holed out!</B> Ngidi gets it right alright second-up, a poor shot by his high standards, the ball was in his arc, but his mega-wrists let him down on this occasion, as the cross-seam delivery spliced high into the covers, to dent England's chase once more!"
"outside off, just back of a length but a very tight line. Beaten outside off"
guided behind point to rotate the strike
"back of a length, slower ball, opens the face and nudged through backward point. No fielder there!"
"angled bat, on the front foot, and a loud bellow of 'no!'"
"slower bouncer, Bairstow rocks back, and rolls his wrists on a very delayed pull. Settles for the single"
"round the wicket, hitting a good length with a bit of tweak, chopped to the off side"
"straighter lines, Bairstow waits on the back foot and nudges to leg with a closed face. So slow off the deck"
"<B>stunning catch at square leg!</B> Malan climbed into a pre-meditated sweep, clawing the ball from outside off, but Rabada watched it all the way, dived forward, inviting a ball in the teeth, and scooped up the offering to give Linde figures of 2 for 2 in nine balls!"
"up on the toes, pressed back to the bowler"
"outside off, fired across the left-hander, and no stroke offered"
"standing tall, on the back foot, vertical blade, none shall pass. Stokes likes to take his time to get started. He's doing just that. But what figures for the new boy!"
"on the hips, flinched to the man on the 45"
"leg-sided once more, tucked off the legs and finds the gap this time"
"bottom-handed push through long-on, Stokes is off the mark with a jogged single"
"down on one knee, lifting a ramp over the shoulder, and that's placed well through fine leg, where Ngidi gallumphs after the ball and claws it back well"
"another single for Stokes, England content to take their time for now"
"tight leg-sided line, Bairstow wears it on the front pad as he attempts a flick to leg"
high elbowed prod into the covers. Linde's mega-arm is keeping a lid on the scoring
"wider line to the leftie, but the ball is coming so slowly off the deck that timing is a lottery. Stokes flaps into the off side"
"<B>this time, some intent!</B> Footwork, to the pitch, hands through the line, biffed over the covers!"
"a huge wind-up, on the charge again, but he can't time it as the ball bobbles off the splice to mid-on"
rotating the strike with a more measured clip off the pads to deep midwicket
"worked to the leg side, and they come back for the second. But the damage to Linde's figures is minimal"
"fired outside off, too wide that time"
"<B>levers from Bairstow!</B> Full length on a wide line, but Jonny is loitering on the back foot, and launches his bat through the line, over long-on!"
"<B>that's gone too!</B> Listen to the report of willow! No doubt where that was heading! Outside off, room to swing into the slog-sweep, and dumped on the grass at midwicket!"
"tighter line, as Shamsi drags his length back, and nudged to the on-side"
"sharp turn from a middle-and-leg line to the leftie, clipped to mid-on"
"<B>scuffed through the leg side again, and so nearly a blinder from Faf!</B> Hard and flat from Bairstow, and du Plessis at wide long-on, sticks out his left hand, nearly clings on, but in the end does well to save six as he topples over the rope with the ball still in play"
tucked to the on-side to keep the strike. A lively over in so many ways...
"back of a length, Stokes pounds in a pull but is disgusted with his timing as he nearly flings his bat away in his followthrough. Deep midwicket tidies"
tapped to backward point for the single
"<B><I>That's </I>the timing Stokes was looking for!</B> Rifled into the stands at deep midwicket, hitting with the wind, picking the ball up outside off, on the slog sweep, and that's flown!"
"tossed up outside off, Stokes charges, and has to check back to the bowler, after accepting he was beaten in flight. Well bowled"
"lines up the reverse sweep but can't nail the placement, or the timing"
"back of a length, clipped to the on-side, Linde's spell is done, 2 for 20 in four overs is not to be sniffed at!"
"back of a length, tucked to the on-side for the single"
"width, from back of a length, Stokes flashes a cut to the cover sweeper"
"<B>Twanged into the stands!</B> Ngidi hits the deck, and Bairstow hits Ngidi! Anchored in the crease, anticipating the skiddy back-of-a-lengther, and smoking it over midwicket!"
"wide outside off, Bairstow leathers a cut-drive, but slightly off the toe as it plugs short of the cover sweeper"
"back of a length, slower ball, well served-up, as Stokes advanced to meet him, so he dragged the length back and nearly forced a mix-up with the batsman so far down the pitch"
"sitting back in the crease this time, thwacked with a cross-blade to deep midwicket. England keep the pot boiling"
"outside off, cracked with intent but not a lot of timing to deep backward point"
"swings into a pull, misses it entirely and wears the ball on his bicep, but they all count as Stokes hustles him through for the single. Misread the cutter on that occasion"
"honked on the up, leaning back for extra power, and outside-edged to third man"
"<B>battered with murderous power through the leg side!</B> Klaasen does brilliantly to get a hand on it as he dives at deep midwicket (not a catch), but the ball still rattles through to the rope"
"<B>gosh, that is cheeky from Jonny!</B> Open face, pure timing, as Hendricks fires it out wide, and he just uses the pace to launch it over third man!"
"a swing and a miss, no contact on that frantic mow. This is getting tasty, as England's run-rate just begins to draw level with South Africa's, who were 96 for 2 at this stage... but who don't bat to 11!"
"Stokes still lacking a touch in timing as he attempts to find a gap on the off side, and fails"
"<B>who needs timing when you've got power!</B> Stokes pulls out the sod-it mow, and launches a <I>massive </I> slog-sweep high over long-on!"
"swept off his feet this time! Stokes made room, and Klaasen followed him, speared into the retreating pads to cramp his intentions"
flicked to the leg side
"on a full length, middle-stump line, Bairstow drives with poise for the single to cover"
"<B>into the pads, and smoked over backward square!</B> Now that <I>was</I> timing from Stokes, who barely followed through, but nailed the flick, hard and flat into the advertising hoardings"
"slower ball, another cutter, dragged into the middle of the pitch and eluding another wipe to leg"
"bottom-handed thump to long-off. Meeting the full, wide line with purpose"
"very wide line, on a full length, decent ball to a man in a mood, Stokes settles for the tapped cut to deep point and a single"
"banged in short, good option but over head-height"
"<B>mowed to the leg side, steepling top-edge, but safe!</B> De Kock back-pedals but the ball plugs way beyond him at fine leg"
"<B>whoosh!</B> Jonny was peering towards the Antarctic by the end of that one, wider line, outside the eyeline, and through to the keeper"
"<B>clobbered through wide mid-on to bring up Bairstow's fifty!</B> Probably the wrong option from Hendricks, tried to finish the over with a length ball, but he was made to regret it with a blistering swipe!"
"<B>holed out to long-on!</B> Linde is the man just inside the rope, who barely has to move as Stokes winds into the long-hop, could have sent it anywhere, but it ended up in the new boy's breadbasket! And is that a glimmer for South Africa?"
nudged to the on side to open his account
"closing the face on a full length, a loud shout of 'no!'"
"sharp spin as Morgan leans onto the off-stump line, poked into the covers"
"flashed out to the cover sweeper, another single to get the skipper's juices flowing"
"hauled to the on-side, big turn from off to leg as Bairstow dances into a low-handed pull"
"sharp pace, back of a length, Bairstow pulls but straight to midwicket"
"<B>full and inswinging, so close!</B> It looked for a moment as though it had cannoned off Jonny's pads into the stumps, but that shape into the right-hander is why the lbw is turned down. Sharp delivery though!"
"outside off, can't connect with this one"
"swished into the leg side, full length into the legs, and flicked behind square"
"banged in short, slower ball, cunning work. Bairstow hops to meet it, but can't lay bat on ball. 'That's your one for the over,' says the ump"
"<strong>... Bairstow knew this would be fuller! </strong> Winding into a powerful slog-drive, high over the leg-side, and plugging inches inside the rope! Bairstow is carrying this fight, but that was a fine over from SA's gun. And he has one more of the four to come..."
"flicked to the on-side, just the single as Morgan gets YJB back on strike. The rate has ticked past two a ball..."
"<strong>bottom-handed magnificence!</strong> Full length, swinging away, and somehow that's been nailed through the covers, with one hand coming off the bat as he has to stretch to reach it!"
shouts of 'catch!' but that's short of deep midwicket as Bairstow leathers a flat clip off the legs
"Crumbs, that's gone wrong! So wide it didn't hit the cut strip, on latitude or longitude! A direct delivery to fine leg, and that helps the cause!"
"<B>pummelled over midwicket, and now Morgan joins the fray!</B> And fray is the mot juste for this over, it's rather going wrong ..."
"short and wide, too wide ... Hendricks is losing his grip here ..."
"fires in the fuller length, but the width is so inviting for the in-form Bairstow! He simply opens his face again, and <strong>plinks it through third man!</strong>"
"sliding past the legs, a better ball by the standards of what's preceded it, but another wide..."
"back of a length, shaping into the pads, Bairstow nurdles to backward square, to end a 28-run game-wrecking over..."
"back of a length, slower ball, Morgan waits on the back foot and thumps a cut to point"
"back of a length, open face, guided through third man"
"<B>flogged to deep midwicket, and Morgan is gone!</B> Bowled into the deck, no pace as it rose into the skipper's swinging blade, and just a glimmer for South Africa, although England don't exactly have a dearth of batting to come..."
"tight line, full length, Bairstow leans forward with a respectful block but still steals the single into the covers"
"<B>wears it on the lid!</B> Banged in short, and Curran's attempts to wind into a pull ends up hitting him in the grille. Bairstow has no mercy and orders him through for the single, which he makes with a dive. We'll have an interlude for the mandatory concussion test, but he seems fine"
"wafted to the leg side, another single to finish off the over"
"<B>nutmegged!</B> Very full, and beats Bairstow's dancing feet for pace as he attempts a leg glance"
cracked hard across the line as Rabada fires into the legs again. Deep square leg tidies up
"slower bouncer, dug into the pitch once more, and out comes a tennis-smash of a pull as Bairstow reaches high to flog it to the leg side. A good finish to this over will keep it very interesting..."
"<B>width outside off, and Curran nails his launch down the ground!</B> My God, he's got some ticker... had to wait and wait as the pace was off, but he cleared du Plessis by a distance at long-on!"
"up on the toes to cut to the covers, and it's nearly a run a ball now"
"crunched with a straight bat, clean to long-on, 'one, one,' is Jonny's call. No need to make things happen. Seven to win in the final over iit is..."
"a roundhouse slog, picking up the width outside off, and hauled through midwicket! This is nearly done now ..."
"<B>that's the way to finish it!</B> In the slot, monstered over wide long-on to seal it with four balls to spare! Jonny Bairstow has quite possibly solved one of the key puzzles for England ... who can fill the void in the middle-order in their opener-heavy line-up? That's quite the audition."
