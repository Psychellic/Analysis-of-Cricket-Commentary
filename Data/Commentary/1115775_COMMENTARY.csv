"chops the back of a length ball back down the pitch. Ooh, it's too early to tell, but he's already hitting the pitch instead of looking for swing"
"<b>there it is</b>, he gets the ball right up there on off stump and it jags awayfrom the angle, enough for even Roy to decide not to knock the leather off it"
sweet strike to point as Roy gets behind a shortish delivery outside off and thumps it with the angled bat
<b>wide of the crease</b> having seen the ball straighten earlier in the over. Roy manages the good length ball on off stump well enough.
goes hands-first at a full delivery outside off and the bat face turns as he meets the ball sooner than necessary. Dot ball to mid-on
"goes right to the edge of the crease again, and this time the ball sits up to be flicked away to the midwicket boundary. Roy, however, feels generous and hits straight to midwicket. <b>Maiden</b>"
starts with a <b>scorching yorker</b>. And it tails in sharply enough too. Bairstow's good enough to protect his stumps
"swishes outside his off stump, with his feet yet to get used to the fact that he's on the clock, and is beaten"
<B>jaffa</b>! Boult exploits nothing save his angle across the right-hander as he pitches the ball up and is helped by Bairstow being rooted to the crease again
"finally, the front foot jerks away and comes to meet a fuller delivery outside off. Much better push to mid-off"
"that's short, and he's ready for it. Stands tall against it and pulls effortlessly to the backward square leg boundary. The ball doesn't rise high enough to trouble the batsman"
on the pads and he finds square leg
waits on the good length ball on off stump and ticks it over to midwicket
<b>appeal for lbw</B> but that should be heading down leg. Might have been an inside edge too as Roy moves across his stumps to open up the leg side.
"punches down the ground, but the slower nature of the pitch doesn't afford him the timing he usually gets. De Grandhomme does well, diving to his left at mid-on"
misses out as a short and wide delivery jaywalks through to the wicketkeeper
<b>so close to off stump</B>! Bairstow is happy to leave a good length ball angled in from wide of the crease. And his judgment is spot on
hits him high on the pads as Southee ties the batsman down with his line on middle and off stump. One run in 12 ball so far for the fast bowler
"splendid strike! Especially considering this is a very good ball, swinging into the right-hander, looking for lbw. But Roy does really well not to plonk his front foot across, which then allows him to bring the bat down straight(ish). Four through midwicket"
"wide half-volley, which Roy throws his hands at and gets a thick outside edge to deep third man"
"<b>third time he's missed</b> a back of a length ball moving across him. Seems like he has the ghost of the inswinger in the back of his mind, spooking him from playing the ball in front of him"
drives a fuller delivery outside off to mid-off
"another one that he chases and misses. Four in a row. A smidge fuller than ideal for the cut shot, and it seems to zip through after pitching"
"<b>taken at slip</b> and Bairstow's problems outside the off stump consume him or was he just fretting over the inswinger that would have threatened his stumps?. In any case, he thrusts his hands out at a good length ball angling across him and offers a healthy edge through to Ross Taylor."
<b>whispers death threats to the off stump as it goes past</b>. Wow! That's a mighty brave leave from Roy. The ball pitches in line with fourth or fifth stump and shapes away after pitching.
"walks at the bowler, who went wide of the crease, and he taps a fuller delivery outside off to mid-on"
"thwacks a back of a length delivery between mid-on and midwicket, strong bottom hand guiding the ball from outside off"
"back of a length and outside off, Roy shows off his leave again. Very sexy, clamour the red-ball rebels."
"good length, outside off, no shot."
gets forward and smacks the ball on the up to cover point
"back of a length on off stump, he gets right behind the line and presents the no-nonsense straight face."
flicks it off his hip to deep square leg. Off the mark second ball. Typical Root
"on the pads, swinging in, he works it to square leg"
good leave as he spots the back of a length ball pitching on leg stump and trusts it to keep going across him
<b>hits high on the bat</b> as he hits the deck and gets a bit of tennis-ball bounce. Good job Roy uses that straight face again
<b>outside edge</b> flies down to third man. Splendid line bowling from New Zealand so far.
"<b>inside edge</b> zips past the left of the diving Tom Latham. Mistake from the hard-hitter, the one New Zealand have been working for all morning. But they aren't quite lucky enough for the awkward cut shot to send the ball back onto the stumps"
"full on off stump, he drills it to mid-on"
"shortish on off stump, he taps it to midwicket, with soft hands (no kidding!) and pinches a single. Good work, Roy"
"leans into the drive to mid-off, the front foot in prime working condition. Root looks damn good. And he's only faced three balls."
"spirits it to the midwicket boundary, his wrists seducing the ball and it just has no chance. Looks like the break's worked well. Or he's just been champing at the bit to be back"
back of a length and outside off. He shuffles in line and blocks it with the authority high school teachers wish they had
"goes for the big, booming drive, and it very nearly carries to mid-off. Roy's definitely getting antsy on this slow pitch"
"back of a length and outside off, Roy doesn't care for it"
"<b>mis-hit</b> but it doesn't carry to third man. Sneaky little delivery, well wide of the right-hander, drawing him into a big shot. But it's terribly, terribly slow and that messes with his timing"
"fullish on off stump, Root drives very very straight. #Ominous"
"<b>past second slip</b>! Boult's angle draws a false shot. These left-armers! Even their bad balls turn almost wicket-taking. The batsman goes after it because it's wide, and he's not making a mistake doing that. And yet somehow the outside edge results"
stands tall against the back of a length delivery and flays it to the cover point boundary. Smooth. So very smooth. Smoother even than Bond asking for his martini.
wide of the crease for a fuller delivery outside off. Roy belts it to the left of mid-off. Misfield from Williamson allows a single
"slower ball, but the deception is not lost on Root as he shuffles across and flicks to short midwicket. Then he practices the good old fashioned mow over cow corner."
lets the good length ball come on and turns it to midwicket
"beautiful cricket. He doesn't let the dots pile up, this dude. Hangs back against a perfectly good ball just outside off and dabs it to third man to jog across to the other end"
"lobs up a 119 kph slower ball, which Roy shovels towards mid-off"
"good length on off stump, Roy is in control of his instincts well enough to defend again. When was the last time you saw him 16 off 30 balls?"
gets inside the line to drive a tossed up delivery on leg stump to long-off. Lovely footwork
"pushes to long-off again, although I suspect he was itching to tonk that over wide long-on"
dials up long-off again and gets crystal clear connection.
pushes it through a touch quicker on middle. Roy's ready for the change of pace
"mid-on's inside the circle and Roy wins the gamble! A hint of room for him to free the arms, and though he is beaten by the flight - he's reaching for the ball, and his timing is shot because of that - he manages to avoid trouble"
"full on middle, blocks it"
starts with an offcutter outside off which Root persuades to deep third man
"fullish on off stump, plonks it back at to the bowler"
looks to beat the ball senseless as he sees it short of a length. But it offers him very little room to do so and ends up back in de Grandhomme's hands
"good length on off stump, Roy taps it into the covers and finds a willing partner for a quick single"
gets right back to turn a good length ball through to the left of square leg
"steps out of his crease to generate some pace, but the wristy slice to point doesn't get past Guptill"
loops it up on middle. Root shifts beside the line and drives serenely to long-off

shifts back on off stump to flick the quicker delivery away to deep square leg.
presses forward to forcefully push a good length ball on off stump to long-off

slides down leg and Root sends it away to long leg for some R&R to bring up England's fifty
bit of an inside edge as he tries to punch a back of a length delivery through midwicket. Ends up with a run at square leg

brilliant work with the wrists as he waits on the back of a length and whips it to long leg
goes after the fuller delivery outside off - a big ole slog - which he inside edges towards long-on
swats a short and wide delivery away to sweeper cover
"goes back because the trajectory is flat. But Sodhi wants that. That's why he is pitching the ball up. He'd like it to hurry along off the pitch and though it does, Root is up for it"
"tosses it up nice and slow outside off, Root lunges forward and drives to the sweeper"
"thunders down the pitch without realising this is the googly. Luckily, it's short in length and he can adjust off the pitch and tickle it to square leg"
drives to long-off. Twenty-seven off 45 at a strike-rate of 60.
"fires it in down the leg side, and though Root is in prime position to pull it away, a voice inside his head tells him he can get a wide and so he holds the shot"
punches a short and wide delivery through to the sweeper again
leans into the drive and finds long-off. Roy's doing very well to stay composed despite playing a game that isn't his normal one
"flat-backs it to mid-off. On a quicker pitch, he would have sent that soaring over point."
heaves the good length ball outside off to the sweeper cover. <b>Brings up the 50 partnership</b>
goes off the thigh pad and has enough on it to hurry along to the long leg boundary
gets nicely forward to a full delivery outside off and drives to the right of the sweeper cover
"back of a length and outside off, Roy is ready with another swat, and the New Zealand's offside in-field is ready to pick up another mis-hit"

<b>top-edges the sweep</B> as the wristspinner gets a touch more bounce than Roy is prepped for
hangs back on a good length ball on off stump and dabs it to short third man
"full and outside off, slices it to deep point"
"top shot! He's earned the right to play this, having spent time in the crease, not caring if he looks ugly. Now he gets a juicy half-volley outside off and he drums it over the bowler's head"
"looks for another big hit, but the legbreak dips on him and so he adjusts the batswing and finds a single to long-on"
"<b>quicker delivery</b> hoping to catch Root in front of the stumps. And it almost does. The ball zips through, looking to hit the pad in line with off stump, but the bat comes down just in time"
makes room to try and punch the ball through extra cover. Doesn't hit the gap because of the lack of pace on offer
tickles a good length ball off his pads to square leg
"sliding it on with the arm into the right-hander, Joy works it to short midwicket"
gets beside the good length ball on leg stump and forces it to long-off
leaps back in his crease to whip the shortish delivery on middle behind square leg.
good shot! His feet are finally starting to move in concert with his mind. It tells him this is a short ball and they rock back for a rasping cut.
"tosses it up outside off, Roy smears it to the right of short cover, where Guptill does well to stop some runs. Big dive. Good parry"
"slows it down, makes it drift into the right-hander, Roy softens the grip on his bat, opens the face and finds a single at cover"
taps the flatter delivery on off stump to the right of point and takes the single. Excellent running.
"<B>dropped</b> by the bowler as it comes back at him with such speed! These have to stick. Roy goes after a tossed up delivery a shade outside off and because he doesn't have all that much room, he can only hammer it back down the ground"
"shifts back again for the cut shot and finds his timing back on his side. New Zealand's fielders, though, aren't"
"<b>outta the park</b>! There's the old Jason Roy! He sees the ball tossed up above his eyeline, plants the front foot down the pitch and swings that big bat so very violently."
length on off stump and Root can't beat extra cover to his right after driving on the up
tossed up on middle stump and draws him forward. Root early on it as he looks to go inside-out. Rolls back down the pitch and the bowler parries it with his right hand. Root wants to steal the single but his partner has unwittingly stopped that deflection
"back of a length on middle, punched to long-on off the back foot"
"<b>beats the outside edge.</b> Subtle turn, almost like a cutter. Goes away after drawing him forward in a channel outside off"
swatted away. Roy isn't to the pitch of this length ball outside off but there's some pace on this that allows it to skid through. He whips his arms through the line and uses the room to bisect extra cover and long-off
"<b>through him!</b> Santner sneaks an arm ball through. Roy hasn't moved the front foot again but this time he won't get away. It's an arm ball, and it's cramped him. The lack of feet has created a gap as he looks to push this to long-on to pick up his fifty. Leg stump is tonked"
"length on off stump, dead-batted into the off side on the front foot"
tossed up at middle stump. Leans in and drives against the turn to long-on
"good length on middle stump, flicked to midwicket off the front foot"

"back of a length on middle stump, tickled through square leg from deep in the crease"
"full on off stump, flicked back to the bowler off the front foot"
allows this to come on and nudges it past third man. Santner is bowling around the wicket so his line is going to be wide every time he looks to spin it in. Morgan camps on the back foot and allows it to come on
"length on off stump, punched into the covers"
"paddled away. Santner pitches leg stump, and it's full. Root merely has to plonk the front leg forward and place this. He gets it fine"
"good length on off stump, defended on the front foot"
"<b>lands the googly and beats the outside edge.</b> Morgan, pressing forward, hasn't picked this at all"
"length on off stump, defended off the back foot"
"drops it short and Morgan hits it long. No pace on this half-tracker. Morgan has the time to pick the turn, watch the seam and make a decision. He goes midwicket with the pull and just clears the boundary"
<b>done by the googly again!</b> This time he'll pay with the wicket. Sodhi nails the length on this. It's tossed up and dipping on a middle stump line. The square leg region is vacant and alluring - Morgan goes for the flick in anticipation of the legbreak. He gets a leading edge that goes straight to mid-off
"good length on middle stump, leans in and pushes it back past the bowler"
"back of a length on middle stump, whipped to deep midwicket off the back foot"
"good length on off stump, drives on the up and uppishly. Straight to mid-off"

short and rising outside off. Gets on top of it and cuts to sweeper cover
"back of a length just outside off, defended off the back foot"
"<b>dropped</b> in the follow through! Boult lunges forward and takes a tumble. Didn't quite have the reaction time to hold on to this. It's a full ball on off stump and Stokes is pushing with hard hands, well in front of his body"
"short on middle stump, pulled to deep square"
"googly on off stump, defended on the front foot"
googly again. Watchful forward press before tapping this to extra cover
back of a length slider outside off. Pushed back to the bowler off the back foot
"<b>drags this with the reverse sweep</b>, possibly premeditating a googly there. It nearly costs him. It's a very full ball on the stumps and he's gone if he misses. He doesn't though. Hits it quite well, in fact. Gets it wide of backward point"
"length on off, steps out and pokes it through mid-off"
back of a length ball on leg stump. Cramped for room and cops this on the thigh guard as he shapes to pull
"back of a length outside off, mistimed punch straight to cover"

"short ball on off stump, pulled to deep square"
"offcutter, back of a length outside off. Punched to sweeper cover off the back foot"
back of a length outside off. Whips across the line to midwicket's right. Ross Taylor's jarred his knee into the ground as he's put in a slide to stop this. Some discomfort but he's back on his feet

good length and in at middle stump. Tapped to midwicket from the crease

"offcutter, good length outside off. Sliced to point on the up"
good length and in at leg stump. Punched to long-on on the up
"short and wide outside off, chopped past point but he won't breach Sodhi's slide at third man. Two runs"
good length and in at middle stump. Tapped back down the pitch
stunning from Williamson to keep this to a single. Short ball outside off is hammered by Stokes but Williamson has first pedalled backwards and then struck his right arm out to grab this
"back of a length on middle, shovelled to midwicket"
"too short, too slow. Root knows where the fielders are. He always does. No half-measures as he pulls aerially on the front foot and hits the boundary padding on the pull"

"length on leg stump, flicked to deep square's right"
"tossed up on leg stump, driven to long-on"
"<b>teases Stokes and induces the top edge.</b> Crafty from Santner. Gets this to dip after tossing it up from around the wicket. It falls just short of good length. Stokes has already got in position to biff the one that turns in with a slog sweep. The ball sits in the pitch, rises a touch and <strike>goes straight through</strike> spins marginally. Taylor has a wee jog to his right and takes comfortably"

full ball wide outside off. Swipes across the line and gets this to deep square's left off the inside half of the bat
"see ya. The trademark golf swing for six. Buttler meets this right at the pitch on middle stump, managing to make some room for himself in the process. Then he swings cleanly from under it and hits it dead-straight, 89 metres"
"<b>and now he goes over long-on!</b> Once again, meets it at the pitch and he doesn't even bother tracking that after connecting. Clean, clean hit"

"good length on leg stump, flicked to midwicket on the up"
"mistimed a pick-up shot, but it falls well short of deep square. Offcutter is dropped short and down leg side. Root got a top edge on that. Bat face closed too early"
<b>close run out call</b> at the non-striker's as Buttler decides to run on a misfield. Guptill fumbles but recovers at cover after stopping the drive. Can't hit the stumps
"<b>breaches his defences!</b> Munro has induced a whip across the line from Root. It looks like it's a knuckle ball too. Whether he meant it or not is unclear, but Munro is screaming in celebration. It's full and angled in at off stump. Root goes across the line and leaves a big gap as he tries to drill it through midwicket. Munro hits off stump"

"back of a length and outside off, taps it to backward point's left"

full toss wanders away down leg. Wonder if that was a knuckle ball (ya just gotta nowadays)

"flays a good length ball to cover. He's playing some eye-catching shots, but finding all the fielders."
glides the wide yorker off the open face to third man

"back of a length and outside off, cuts it point"
spears it to the left of point to pick up a quick single
makes room outside leg to crunch a back of a length delivery through to the sweeper. <b>Two-hundred up</b>
"<b>only just vaults over the off bail</B> as Moeen indulges in a pull shot. Bye taken with Latham, standing up behind the wicket, fumbling"
looks for the big hit over extra cover - having done the hard work to get inside the line to hit inside out - but doesn't quite time it well enough to get the boundary
"scoops it from way outside off and gets it down to the midwicket boundary. Very short ball, but the room it offers allows Moeen the leeway to pull it away"
"drills a full delivery to short cover, where the fielder does well to stop runs"
slower ball drifts down leg again.
"bullies it away to the long-on boundary! That time he doesn't hold back. Sees a short ball, loves that it has room, and flat-bats it away"

"full and outside off, nudges to short midwicket"
"beautiful work. The ball is coming from over the wicket, Santner hoping to cramp the left-hander. But Mooen waits and waits and waits for it to drift across him and then chops it to third man"
"around the wicket to the right-hander, who taps it to long-on"
"skips down the track, but this line from over the wicket, helps Santner refuse Moeen the leverage he wants"
pulls it away! This seems like the carrom ball. The length goes wrong and it sits up for Moeen to prepare for launch
"oh, he's just playing with the field now! The square leg fielder was moved to his right after the last shot. So now, this short ball is pulled where he had originally been standing"
dinks it behind square leg again. England want mo. Mo's givin em mo. Geddit?
"starts with a googly, which Moeen picks as he cuts to cover"
"straight up... and it comes down to snuggle with Martin Guptill! New Zealand gamble with their wristspinner and he loots the house! Moeen, having looked phenomenal, is gone, ruing his charge down the pitch. That allows Sodhi to sneak in a googly, line it up very wide, force him to mistime the shot off the very bottom of his bat and have him caught at cover"

"good length, outside off, Buttler leaves it looking for a wide. Nope."

"makes him drive away from his body, but Buttler does well to take his front foot across so his head is right over the ball. Single to deep extra cover"

opens the face to spear the tossed up delivery to the sweeper cover
"they're hiding the ball outside off, but Buttler's managing to reach them, and time them too. Flays it to cover, where Guptill gets a hand and deflects it to long-off"
"<b>dropped</b>! Nicholls is the man lying flat on his face after doing so very well to get under the ball. Runs in from deep midwicket, eyes on the ball, tracking it as well as he could. But just as it comes down, swirling in the wind, he gets nervous. The ball lands in the ends of the fingers, and since he's gripping it so loosely, it pops out when he hits the turf. Buttler survives a bad slog sweep"
"looks for the late cut, but is beaten bu a touch more bounce than he is ready for"
"pushes it through on off stump, blocks it"
"flat in trajectory, but full in length, so the batsman is trapped in his crease as he blocks"

nudges it to midwicket and Santner runs after it himself
"pushes to cover. And that ends Santner's spell. Only 54 runs off his 10 overs, but he walks off kicking the turf for leaking that one boundary to Buttler"
"goes for the slower ball, the legcutter, which he places wide of the right-hander charging out at him."
"no pace again, on the wide line, Buttler smears it to cover"
inside edges the slower ball on off stump to square leg. A trio of legcutters from Southee
works a very full delivery - at top pace - out to deep midwicket
"wide of the crease yorker, with no shortage of speed, and Buttler, set up for the slower ball, is beaten"
"full and tailing into off stump, Buttler skewers it out to the sweeper"
"looks for the yorker again and Woakes sends it to deep midwicket. Brilliant over from Southee, who has a genial little chat with the umpire, perhaps about the wide early in the over."
"length and outside off, Woakes smashes it to sweeper cover"
"there's the scoop, but Boult one-ups that with an offcutter, and the lack of pace, coupled with the ball dipping on him foils Buttler's plans"
"finds the yorker a shade outside off, Buttler jams it out to one of three points"
"slower ball bouncer, which he launches out to the right of deep midwicket. Waits that extra bit so that he could hammer it away"
great placement. He is new to the crease but he is still able to spot the bouncer with virtually no pace. He waits in his power position until the ball is right there for him to clobber to the square leg boundary
"does him with the slowy! Woakes is looking for the drive over extra cover, because there is width on the ball. Problem is there is no pace, and those shots need pace to time properly. Boult secures the inside edge, and then the catch reaching to his right"
heaves a full delivery outside off to long-on
"full and wide, well outside Willey's reach, but within legal limits"
"low full toss outside off, slices it to deep point"
"slower ball again, with very little room, Buttler forces it away to deep cover and then looks up to see the scoreboard ticking up by only one after all that effort"
"looks for the leg-stump yorker, but it wanders a touch too far"
"full and wide, Willey mis-hits to mid-off"
"low full toss on middle, Buttler swipes it to long-on"
"walks across and goes for the sweep, but the offcutter bobbles off the pad into the off side"
"low full toss on off stump, Willey hits to long-on"
lets go a slower ball bouncer which sails over his head.
"nails the yorker, outside off, and with Buttler throwing his front leg aside, his balance is all wrong to make proper connection. Can't quite reach out and get under it. Ends up dragging it back to the bowler"
"back of a length and outside off, pulls it to long-on"
"full and outside off, slaps it to the right of long-off. De Grandhomme does well, putting in a big dive, but as he tries to slap the ball back to his team-mate Southee, he gets too much power on it"
"launches it over the ropes! Ah, those tiny boundaries are cruel! Boult might have thought he's done well with a slower ball. He has the batsman reaching as he plays the slog. That means he doesn't get all of it., but in Hamilton, it's enough"
<b>unlucky</b>! The wide yorker lands perfectly. Willey gets an inside edge. It basically dribbles dead straight to the boundary behind him. Poor Latham. He's moving to his left based on the angle and ends up having to change direction with no time to do so
slogs it out to long-on
sits up and Buttler launches it over midwicket! The slower ball lands on a length and has ample room for Buttler to bring all his power to bear down on it
"another heave, but he mistimes the shot, and a length, ripe for a tonk, goes out to deep midwicket."
"yorker on off stump, Willey plonks it back down the pitch, Buttler is racing down to re-take strike. Southee reaches to his right, grabs the ball with one hand, and runs it to the stumps. Super innings from the finisher. Even with New Zealand bossing the last 10 overs, he's taken England to a strong total"
"gets him lbw with Willey swinging across the line. <b>He does want a referral though</b>. It all starts with a full delivery, pitching on leg stump and hitting the back pad in line with off stump. The angle seems like it would be taking it past the stumps. <b>Massive inside edge too</b>. That means Willey and England get a run"
"lovely ball to start the innings! Angled across the right-hander, shaping back in, and nibbling past the edge of the bat to the keeper"
"outside off stump this time, cautiously jabbed into the gully with high hands"
"much fuller, a hint of swing back into the bat, worked with the angle down to mid-on"
"good length from Willey, threatening to swing, and poked into the covers. A slip and a short midwicket are the close catchers at this stage"
"big inswing, cramping Guptill for room on the leg stump. Gathered by the bowler in his followthrough"
"on the pads once more, a swish of intent but no contact as Willey closes out the maiden. A strong start"
"tight line and length, eased into the covers off the front foot"
"wallop! That is immense! Nothing desperately wrong with the ball, a good length outside off, but Munro drops to one knee, scythes across the line with spring-loaded wrists, and out comes a new ball as that one has been embedded in the concrete!"
stretching forward and pushed back down the ground
"wider line, Munro has a charge, can't reach the pitch and <strong>snicks a thin edge to the keeper!</strong> That's a huge comeback from Woakes, and a disappointing shot from Munro. He'd already creamed one in the over, but was barely in the same postcode as that delivery"
into line to defend down the ground
"good line, nibbling off the seam and through to the keeper as Williamson leaves alone"
"swing, and threat. Fenced to point with a watchful prod"
"squirted off the pads, out through midwicket, and they hustle back for the second"
"angled to the leg side, gathered back backward square"
"leaning forward, pushed into the leg side off a slight inside edge"
"good fourth-stump line, left alone as Guptill shoulders arms"
"good contact this time, a bit of a rank half-volley, in the big man's slot, and duly slotted straight back past the bowler"
"attempted leave, deflected down into the gully"
"angled bat, into the cordon. Williamson just biding his time"
"crashed through the covers, that was a sweetly struck drive, but an excellent one-handed half-stop from Stokes cuts off the runs"
"a bit of nip and bounce on off stump, Williamson rides the bounce and nudges a single to third man"
"pushed onto the back foot this time, defended to midwicket"
"up on the toes, attempted back-foot punch but can't quite find the timing. New Zealand being made to wait for their scoring opportunities at the moment"
"full, aiming at the blockhole, stabbed to the off side"
blocked into the covers as Guptill strides onto the front foot to defend
"good line and length, inswing on off stump, defended"
"drawn onto the front foot once more, squeezed to the off side"
"<B>edged but there's no slip!</B> A classic snick to a hard-handed drive, would have been gobbled in the midriff but instead it's through third man for the boundary!"
"a woolly drive, no foot movement, and through to the keeper"
"outside off, up on the toes, stabbed to cover"
blocked back down the wicket
"punched into the covers off the back foot, a loud yell of 'no!'"
"more probing pace from back of a length, Williamson punches off the back foot once more but can't pierce the covers"
clipped off the back foot through midwicket for a scampered single
"wider on the crease, angled into the stumps, poked to point"
"crunched hard off the back foot, but only as far as extra cover. They accept the single"
"very full, angled into the toes, squirted to the off side"
"up on the toes, stabbed into the off side, out through backward point"
"squared up on the back foot, Willey's subtle swing is doing just enough to check New Zealand's most expansive strokeplay"
"no space to free the hands, punched hard to point off the back foot"
"flicked off the toes, just the three runs off the over"
"that's a classy shot. Just a touch too short, and enough width to climb into the back-foot drive. High hands, standing tall, and caressing the boundary through the covers"
"forward and defended to the off side, fuller length this time"
"punched into the covers, in the air for a while, but always safe"
"solidly onto the front foot, and defended"
angled defence into the off side
"well bowled, saw Williamson coming and shifted his line a touch wider to beat the batsman's intent"
angled to point
"fuller length, Guptill wanted a piece of that, but the late swing just did for his attacking intent, as the lofted drive skewed along the ground to midwicket"
"forward again, but can't time the drive"
"on the legs, whittled round the corner where a tumbling dive at backward square cuts off the boundary"
"<B>edged and gone! </B>Williamson was looking to glide a late cut, but the ball was too tight to his bat, and Buttler scoops a low catch behind the stumps! A massive breakthrough for England, and the off-colour Kane troops back to the pavilion"
"outside off, through to the keeper"
"very full length, a bottom-handed push to cover"
"punched off the back foot and <B>just short of mid-off!</B> That was in the air for ages, and had it been a little squarer, it would have been gobbled by short cover"
"this one is gone all right! Width, smashed, but straight to Stokes on the edge of the circle, who plucks a fiercely hit stroke in front of his eyes!"
"banging out a good length, angling across the left-hander"
squeezed through backward square off a thick inside edge
"inswinger, into the pads, squeezed to the leg side"
"stretching forward, angled into the off side"
"that's a better strike! Width on offer from Willey, and a good stride from Latham, leaning into a firm pushed drive through the covers"
"the same again! Latham's weight transfer is spot on as he leans into another drive, and pierces the covers once more"
"three in a row from Latham, really picking the line and late movement, but Stokes is sweeping on the boundary now and cuts off the boundary"
stabbed down to third man this time
"very full, attacking the pad, and squeezed to the leg side"
"width, slashed in the air, down to third man"
"on the pads, tucked to the leg side"
"punched on the up to mid-off, there's a very awkward shadow falling across the pitch as the sun dips in the sky, and Taylor has an expression that suggests he didn't pick that one up very well"
dead-batted into the covers
"into line, and pushed to mid-off"
"tight line on off stump, no way through there"
"full and straight, worked to midwicket"
"outside off, an extravagant leave"
"angling into the off stump, solidly blocked back down the pitch"
"an ambitious wipe across the line as Taylor sizes up the length, but that was through him before he could fully react, at 142kph. Not too shabby"
"onto the front foot, pushes the single into the covers"
"looping slower ball, dabbed into the off side. Stokes is back, and slotting into the attack nicely so far"
"too much width, and clobbered through point with fast hands and superb timing"
"closes the face, and worked to the leg side"
dabbed to fine leg to bring up the fifty
"a loopy leaping slower ball, right out of the back of the hand and pops up with the over-spin too"
"another slower ball, straight and true, can't do much with that"
"eased into the covers, a teasing over"
"tight line, no way through there"
"very full and straight, a hard-handed drive back to the bowler, who half-fields in his followthrough"
"slower ball, scuffed into the covers with a bottom-handed whip"
rolled the wrists and nailed a fine pull through backward square
"onto the front foot, punched to cover"
"outside off, drawing the batsman onto the front foot"
"another slower ball from Curran, tapped off the hip to midwicket"
"short and wide, a slower ball as well, Latham picked it early and lashed a firm cut out to the point sweeper"
rolls the wrists out to deep midwicket
"another slower ball, but this time it drifts down the leg side"
poked down to third man with a closed face of the bat
drilled to cover
"slower ball, back of a length, pulled round the corner."
"slower ball, which Taylor picks and ushers carefully to third man"
allows the ball to come to him and then plants the bat out like a ramp outside off to find a single at third man
"another slower ball, there seems to be just enough of a change in Stokes' action for Taylor to read it early and nudge it through square leg"
opens the face for a single behind point
"Stokes, and the captain Morgan at cover, charge in at the ball. And a collision is imminent... until the boys calm down and change direction. All in all, a good block from Taylor, with soft hands, to find a single"
"full on off stump, at top pace, Latham keeps it out"
"the sweep is the right-hander's first port of call, yanking a good length ball outside off away to long leg"
shifts back and across to the shortish delivery and so is in prime position to flick it from off stump to deep square leg
"another sweep, with a little more power behind it this time. Still only a single at deep square leg"
a whirl of the wrists sends the good length ball on off stump to midwicket
waits a touch more on this delivery to find a single behind square leg. It was straight enough that his job became easier
"tossed up, wider outside off, which forces Taylor to play with a vertical bat. A push to mid-on"
leans into the drive and finds mid-off
punches the back of a length delivery away to deep third man
slower ball off the back of the hand and Taylor in his attempts to cut it away is beaten
now goes wide of the crease for a short on Taylor's hips. Flick to long leg
"waits the requisite time to glide the bouncer, a shade outside off, down to third man"
low full toss outside off and Taylor graciously dinks it straight to midwicket
"gets down on one knee and paddles this good length ball, coming into him from around the wicket, towards the long leg boundary. Clever batting. Brings up the 50-partnership as well"
clips a flatter delivery outside off to midwicket
"<b>huge lbw appeal</b>, with Latham looking for a paddle sweep again. Might have been struck outside the line and Joe Root at slip informs the captain not to go for the review"
"full and outside off, defends into the covers"
gentle nurdle behind square leg
taps the ball on top of the bounce away to deep point. New Zealand concentrating on taking the chase deep.
starts around the wicket and trusts in his slower ball. Even if it does end up short and wide. Latham cuts to deep point
<b>outside edge</b> but Taylor keeps it down and makes it serve him as he finds a single to third man. Plays with a closed face and just enough movement off the pitch puts him in <i>slight</i> trouble
clips the ball coming in with the from around the wicket to deep square leg
the slower ball goes wrong - it's too short and it sits in this slow pitch for far too long for a batsman like Taylor not to take advantage. Pulls it to oblivion
"takes all the pace off again, Taylor waits on it, and even though it kicks up sharply to hit the splice of the bat, he finds a single at square leg"
plays close to the body as the leg glance scuttles away to the left of deep square leg
the front leg goes across and the closed bat face comes down to secure a single to square leg
eases back and flicks the good length ball on off stump well enough through square leg to pinch a couple
"looks for runs on the leg side again, but Moeen adjusts his line, pushing it a touch wider outside off"
"so Latham shifts to the leg side now, waits for the offbreak to turn and pats to point"
"leg glance! And a sweet one at that. Taylor doesn't need to do much more than get a tickle on it with Moeen straying way down leg, and offering tons of pace to work with too"
lunges forward to the pitch of the ball and works it behind square leg
cuts - right off the stumps -  and finds a single to backward point
"pitches on middle and turns just enough to beat the bat and hit the pad. That prompts Rashid to appeal, but it would have slid down leg"
"<b>excellent stuff</b>! Having seen the last ball turn, Rashid pushes this into the right-hander. Taylor plays the angle, he's beaten by a bit of dip, and then struck on the pad as the ball breaks past the leading edge"
gets down the pitch and flicks through straight midwicket
sees a flighted ball on off stump and sweeps it calmly to long leg
"<b>hits the back pad</b> as a quicker delivery zips past Taylor's defences. Actually, there may have been a small nick. He holds up his bat to the umpire to indicate as much. Promising first over from Rashid. His control looked very good, pitching the ball up, but never full enough for the batsman to get under it. And getting more than enough turn"
"fires it in from around the wicket, Latham turns it to midwicket"
too close to leg stump and Latham has a simple job clipping it to short fine leg
"gets down to sweep the ball, and there's enough on it to beat even Ben Stokes. Pretty odd to find him at fine leg instead of slip. But he's not played cricket for five months and England perhaps want to hide him. <b>Meanwhile, Ross Taylor has 7000 ODI runs</b>, the third New Zealander to the mark"
"good length and outside off, he nudges it to short fine leg"
"quicker delivery on off stump, blocks it"
"a much more forceful whip off the stumps, with Taylor screaming 'two, two, two'. He won't get it"
premeditates a lap sweep so he has no choice but to go through with the shot even when the ball becomes a wide full toss
gets down low and sweeps the full delivery on middle and leg
"the right-hander sweeps this time, taking a length ball from outside off and giving it a safe home at deep square leg"
jumps away from the line of the quicker ball so he has the room to punch it to a deepish mid-off
<b>googly</B> pins him in front - only Taylor has charged out of his crease and therefore will not be out lbw
"big turn and he is <b>nearly stumped</b>. Rashid intends for it, giving the ball a proper rip as he sees Taylor rushing down the pitch. Very nearly succeeds!"
"full and on leg stump, works it to mid-on"
deflects a good length ball outside off to square leg
"slower through the air, the ball drifting into leg stump, attempting to cramp Latham. But the crafty left hander pushes his front leg away so that the bat can come down with some power and he flicks the ball very nearly to the midwicket boundary"
tucks it to midwicket
shimmies down and taps it to the left of mid-on
whisks the length ball for a good time through square leg
<b>leading edge</b> as Rashid makes Taylor play against the turn by making the ball drift into leg stump. Then the dip and turn does the dirty work
"appears to be the googly, and Latham squeezes it out to point, mis-hitting the ball with a closed face"
"on the pads, Rashid works it to midwicket"
"goes for the sweep, with the googly tossed up outside leg. But it's far slower than Latham expects and he is hit on the glove"
defends a good length ball that affords the batsman no pace
<b>dropped</b>! A faint nick from Latham as he looks for a single behind square leg and Buttler is unable to skip to his right in time to grab a fairly difficult chance
defends a good length ball outside off to midwicket
pitches on middle and leg and spins further down. Joe Root is getting turn off this track. Ha!
"short and outside off, Taylor plays the cut and finds point"
"full and on off stump, he taps it back to the bowler, forcing Latham to dive back into the crease to avoid being run out for backing up"
turns a full delivery from outside off to deep square leg
"defends the round-arm slider on middle, looking for a single through cover. Instead, he finds one through square leg to tick over to 2000 ODI runs"
"<b>misfield</b> at backward point! And <b>Taylor has fifty</b>! Comes off his favourite cut shot, backing away to have the room to play the shot off the stumps"
<b>top edges</b> as the wristspinner gets more bounce than Latham is ready for as he goes down to sweep the ball
"feints moving across to make Rashid bowl there, and then leaps away outside leg to late cut to the ball to third man"
"<b>and that's Latham's fifty</B>, getting it off a simple straight drive to long-on. Only three fours in the innings, but like Root earlier in the day, he's hardly looked troubled"
"sets up for the sweep early, and pulls the shot off despite Rashid going quicker and wider outside off"
tucks it to midwicket
"<b>lovely bowling</b>, getting the ball above the eyeline, making it drift in the air, and then finally dip enough that Taylor cannot go for a big shot"
rocks back to cut the short and wide delivery to the sweeper cover
slips down leg
whips a full delivery outside off to long-on
brings out the reverse sweep - a shot he confessed he had never played until 2017 - but finds short third man
""
"deflects it off his pads to short fine leg, and Latham makes the call for a quick single and completes it well"
"reverse sweep again, and this time he gets a lot more bat on it, forcing the ball to the left of Stokes. Is it me or is he not looking as athletic as he usually is?"
"tosses it up on middle and leg, Taylor defends carefully"
shifts back to cut the flatter delivery to point
<b>beats him</b> as Rashid fires it in outside off and the pitches offers him loads and loads of turn
"hangs back, despite the ball being quite full, but is still able to flay the ball through to the sweeper cover"
"he moves so very late. That's the key to playing spin. Start late, but be quick with your feet. Latham does it ever so well as he punches a ball from off stump through point with a vertical bat"
"presses forward to block and pinches a single, with Buttler having to abandon his post behind the stumps to hunt the ball down at cover"
"<b>appeal for lbw</b> with Taylor moving well across his stumps. The on-field call is not-out <b>but England to review</b>. 'It's clealry missed the bat,' says the third umpire, and he's right. This back of a length delivery hits the deck, climbs up on Taylor as he goes for the flick. Gets hit on the thigh, basically, and ball tracking says it will be missing the stumps"
"full on off stump, Taylor blocks it by his feet and while looking for a single kicks the ball into the covers."
"looks to flick the ball into the leg side again, a ball that is in line with off stump and therefore his decision to play across the line doesn't quite work out. Strikes him high on the pad"
"fierce, absolutely FIERCE! It's short. It's meant to test his reflexes on the back foot. But Taylor swivels gracefully and sends it crashing into the square leg boundary"
nudges it through square leg and brings up New Zealand's 150.
"what is the point of banging it into a slow pitch at top speed? It only makes the ball come onto the bat quicker, and this is a set batsman. Latham punishes these flawed plans with a vicious pull"
"nicely flighted outside off, Taylor blocks into the covers and hustles a quick single"
"full toss on leg stump, Latham sweeps it to long leg"
chops the legbreak a shade outside off to backward point
"flays it to the left of backward point! He is gorgeous square of the wicket on both sides and with Rashid pushing the ball through, Taylor only needs to place the ball."
"another short ball, and that mistake is made worse by a misfield from Moeen Ali at point. The ball seems set for the boundary, but Bairstow at least puts in a good effort, stopping it inches from the rope"
works it through midwicket
"back of a length and outside off, dinks it down to deep third man"
"what a shot! <b>He's cutting balls that are full now</b>! No kidding. This is pitching in the 4m mark, but perhaps it being an offcutter helps him pull the shot off"
"soft hands, bat face pointing down as he meets it, the ball wanders behind the stumps and those legs sprint away to the other end"
"full and outside off, spears it to point"
full face of the bat to smack a cover drive to Ben Stokes at cover
"on the pads, Taylor works it away to long leg"
looped up on leg stump and tucked behind square for the single
"well flighted legbreak on middle and off to the left-hander, Latham works with the spin to steal another single behind square"
"swept, and well connected, out to backward square"
<B>misreads the wrong'un and a steepling leading edge!</B> Who wants it... it <B>lands safe</B> in no-man's land at mid-off! Lucky lucky
tucked to backward square
"picks the googly well enough this time, a firm clobber to deep extra cover"
right behind the line to defend back down the pitch
"threatening to swing from a full length, firmly drilled into the covers but straight to the fielder"
swept to deep cover
"round the wicket, pushed onto the back foot to defend into the covers. Sharp pace from back of a length"
"very well bowled again, Latham tempted into something more expansive as he advanced down the pitch, but he's beaten by the cutter, which <i>just </I> hops over his stumps"
"a touch of width and steered gratefully through third man. Unlucky for Woakes but relief for New Zealand, that keeps them on track"
head over the ball  clipped urgently out through midwicket for another single
"tossed up, above the eyeline and dipping late, a firmly pushed drive into the covers, but an excellent diving stop"
punched on the up into the leg side
"a big stride down the line of the ball, stabbed into the gap in the covers and they gallop through for a single"
"reverse sweep, not perfectly timed but good contact, gathered at backward point"
"a big appeal for lbw as Latham unfurls another sweep, but it's outside the line of leg stump. England have no reviews anyway"
"wide on the crease, stabbed into the on side, and a bit of a tight call as the shy comes in"
"banged in short, and <B>hoisted over backward square</B>. Easy as you like, picked the length early, worked with the angle, and deposited over backward square"
"short and leg-sided once more, and a more scuffed pull this time, but effective all the same, rushing very fine beyond Buttler's reach behind the stumps!"
"better line from Stokes, angled into the base of the stumps, but chiselled into the leg side to pinch another single"
"a pounding drive into the covers! What a sublime stroke, straight to the sweeper so its impact was negated, but he timed the pants off that"
"nudged off the pads to mid-on, and that's a leaky over from England's point of view. They need a wicket to disrupt what has become a very serene chase"
worked off the pads to backward square
beaten outside off by a slower cutter that slides under the bat. Cunning
"round the wicket, probing line and length, angling back into the left-hander. Cautiously blocked on the back foot"
"a bottom-handed whip from outside off, gathered at mid-on as the 200 comes up"
"over the wicket to the right-hander, who slides inside the line to deflect a leg-glance to fine leg. The runs keep coming"
"biffed high into the leg side, that one's got snow on it... square leg charges in and the ball is ... <B>dropped!</B> Jonny Bairstow, sprawling forwards, but can't cling on.. well now..."
"outside off, slower ball, Latham waits and waits, and glides a cut through third man"
"tight line from over the wicket, angled into the stumps, and blocked firmly to mid-on"
"outside off and beaten, an attempted glide to third man but the ball hops past the edge"
"attempted slower ball, but rather dribbles out of the back of the hand and away down the leg side"
"opens the face, guides a steer through third man"
"<B>there's the golden arm!</B> A urgent slog-pull from Latham, trying to make something out of a good length ball outside off, but he scuffs his shot, high on the bat and straight to mid-on! England break the stand, and Stokes has his first wicket since September!"
"round the wicket, that's a fine line to the new batsman, tight to the stumps and demanding a compact defensive block"
"on the pads, tucked behind square for another single"
"<B>slashed straight to backward point!</B> Here come England, given a sniff by that breakthrough and now making it count. The shot was on for Nicholls, short and wide outside off, but the execution was lacking, leaning back in over-excitement, as he picked out Roy's midriff!"
inside-edged drive to midwicket
"dancing at the crease, trying to make room for a nurdle through third man"
"sliding into the pads, half an appeal from Buttler behind the stumps, but he might have been better off rushing in to field, as New Zealand scurry back to steal a second run from nowhere!"
"very full and straight, an inside-edged drive, rolls into the gap at cover and they gallop the single"
"rolls the fingers on a cutter outside off, dead-batted down into the crease and it's a race for the stumps between Stokes and the non-striker. De Grandhomme wins  by a nose"
"speared down the leg side, de Grandhomme unleashes a bullish swish across the line, but it's gathered on the bounce at deep backward square"
"an excellent slower ball, perfect length, tailing in all the time to cramp Taylor for room outside off, all he can do is dab to point"
"another roundhouse swish, into the leg side, they hustle back for the second... <B>but Buttler fails to gather the shy!</B> A gather of any quality and that was gone!"
"<strong>no mistake from Buttler this time!</strong> Another slower ball from Stokes, another murderous mow from de Grandhomme. But he almost had time to meet the ball on the second windmill as he snicked the thinnest of edges through to the keeper, and now New Zealand are plummetting fast"
"round the wicket, outside off, no stroke offered. Stokes has two in as many overs. England are scenting the bouquet of victory... what can Taylor yet say about that?"
"slower ball, down the leg side, but golly, t<strong>hat was scarily close to the leg bail</strong> as Taylor opted against playing a shot"
props onto the front foot to defend
"outside off stump, another slower ball, jabbed down to third man"
back of a length and dabbed into the gap
"cracked into the covers, and<B> there it is! </B> A stunning hundred from Taylor ... can he make it a matchwinning one now?"
"outside off, guided to third man with a late deflection"
"cunning bowling, another slower ball on a perfect looping length, Santner props forward to defend and has to be mindful of the ball rolling back towards his stumps"
"too wide from Stokes, Taylor stretches for the cut and slaps a very welcome boundary through third man"
"misdirected this time, an attempted short ball, but it just hops disobediently down the leg side"
"<strong>a filthy full-bunger!</strong> That was beamer height, but too wide to be a threat. Taylor slashes eagerly through third man, but the umpire doesn't call no-ball... surprising..."
worked to the leg side from a fuller length. Stokes gets his areas back under control
"round the wicket, very full, punched to the off side"
"slower ball from round the wicket, excellently bowled, Santner can do nothing with it"
"another constrictive cutter on a good length to the left-hander. A mixed bag in that over, but England still pretty much in command"
"round the wicket to the left-hander again, Santner slides back and across to punch a defensive push into the covers"
"up on the toes, aiming a firm drive into the covers, but it comes off the edge and glides down to third man"
"tip and run into the covers, good judgement of the single to keep the scoreboard ticking"
an expansive pull but the ball wasn't quite there for the shot. Short midwicket intercepts with a tumble
"<strong>this time the pull is most definitely on!</strong> Panned over wide long-on, right in the slot for the slog, up, up and away!"
"on a better length outside off, stabbed to point, but the shy goes awry and New Zealand snaffle the overthrows! It's getting scrappy at the death!"
"a big spinning googly to open his account, Santner reads it from the pitch and pings an uppercut into the covers"
"well bowled, a full-length legbreak, tight line, and poked back to the bowler"
"a flowing drive into the covers, another legbreak, easily negotiated, but the cover ring is well placed"
"another googly to the left-hander, thumped uppishly into no-man's land behind the bowler's head"
"<B>dragged down the track and stumped by a mile!</B> Beautiful flight and bite from Rashid, that's the impact the leggie can have at the death. Taylor wanted to keep the hammer down, but that was a wicket-taking delivery that demanded more respect, Buttler gathered way outside off to whip off the bails, and it's an ignominious end to a very very fine innings!"
"beaten outside off and <strong>Buttler whips off the bails again!</strong> The umpires are taking a look. Is his back toe anchored? It wasn't, but Buttler couldn't gather cleanly at first, and Southee looks to have made his ground by the time the stumps are finally broken"
"wide outside off, an attempted cut, but toe-ended into the off side"
"quicker ball, outside off, a mistimed drive to cover"
"<strong>beautifully bowled!</strong> A doodlebug of a slow yorker, tailing into the toes and somehow squeezed out to cover. That was exceptional death bowling"
cracked to cover with plenty intent but no great direction
flipped with urgency off the toes to deep backward square
"outside off, <strong>that's in the slot for the powerful Southee! </strong>A brutal drive, on the up and over the covers, one bounce and into the fence!"
"<B>a massive slog into the night sky!</B> Drops to one knee, gets right underneath the shot, and dispatches a towering six onto the grass bank at cow corner!"
"another slam into the stands! Rashid made the difference in the last over, but he's maybe gone one too many now... Santner leans back for another fierce slog over the leg side"
"too wide from Rashid, trying to stay clear of Santner's hitting zone, and pays the price in extras"
"flatter and faster, probably the way to go against a man in a mood. Santner sizes up another belligerent pull but can't time it this time"
right behind the line of the ball to defend back down the pitch. Southee content to make no mistake with the leggie all but bowled out
"wider line, thumped into the covers"
"heaved hard down to long-on, gathered on the bounce. An expensive final over, but a fine spell from Rashid, and a key wicket"
"a cunning slower ball, dipping late into the blockhole, and dug out into the covers"
"very full once again, and that's thumped with vigour to long-on. Southee looks like a man with sixes in his locker"
"another very full length, brave from Curran and so far effective. Santner gives himself room but can't free his arms"
another big wind-up from Southee but a <B>grunt of frustration</B> as he fails to pick the slower ball and scuffs a pull along the ground to long-on
"slower ball, and this time Santner gets enough bat on his mow to find the gap! A desperate heave across the line, who cares where it goes, so long as it goes! Through square leg"
"full length, dug out to long on. <strong>England have nine runs to defend in the final over</strong>"
"on the toes, and <B>flicked through the legs for a vital boundary!</B> So unlucky for Woakes, he got the blockhole targetted, but the inside edge did enough for New Zealand"
"slower ball, but it's <strong>too far outside off stump!</strong>"
"<strong>that's the way to win it!</strong> In the slot, slammed off the toes like a left-handed Carlos Brathwaite, high over deep midwicket to give New Zealand first blood in a thrilling finale!"
