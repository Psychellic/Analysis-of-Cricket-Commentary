"wide outswinger on a fullish length, and Guptill gets down on his back knee and has a proper old slash at that. He's nowhere near connecting, and the umpire signals wide"
"back of a length, close to off stump, a bit of shape away. Gets back and across and defends towards cover point"
"fuller this time, curves away from the fourth-stump line, left alone"
"back of a length, straightens towards middle stump. Gets on his toes to ride the bounce and defend back down the pitch"
"back of a length outside off, doesn't quite come onto the bat for the horizontal-bat slap. Hits it hard into the ground and it rolls slowly into the point region"
"first runs off the bat, and it's a boundary. Back of a length again, not too much width, and a bit of extra bounce. Looks to punch off the back foot and it hits high on the bat, near the outside edge, and runs away quickly to the left of Ben Stokes at backward point"
"back of a length, a little closer to off stump, left alone"
"length ball, straightens a little towards top of off, defended to midwicket"
"similar length, a touch too straight, worked off the hip to fine leg"

"length ball, nips back a little towards middle stump, worked away to the left of long leg"
"got him, what a beaut! Or did he edge that at all? Squared him up in defence with late movement from the shorter side of a good length, on a tight off-stump line. Replays show the ball has sneaked past the outside edge and <b>hit the pocket of Guptill's trousers</b> on the way to the keeper. England trust in Marais Erasmus' not-out decision and decide not to review, wisely so."
"length ball on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"back of a length on leg stump, tucked off the hip to square leg"
"slants this one across, pitching just outside off on a fullish length. No swing back in, and Nicholls ignores it"
"ooh, this one does come back in, and Kumar Dharmasena doesn't wait too long to raise his finger to Woakes' lbw appeal. <b>Nicholls reviews</b>. Lovely length, fullish but not full enough to bring out a proper front-foot stride, and Nicholls is stuck on the crease, playing down the wrong line, looking for the straight-bat defensive push to mid-on. Beats the inside edge, and hits back thigh pad. The ball pitched on a middle-and-leg line, and straightened, but the bounce would have <b>taken it over the stumps</b>, according to ball-tracking. Wow!"
"length ball, straightening towards middle and off. Gets in half a stride this time and defends, with ball hitting the inside half of the bat"
"a touch shorter on off stump, worked away with the swing through square leg"

"back of a length, a bit of nip back towards off stump, defended into the on side off the back foot"
"digs this in short, rising shoulder high outside off, and Guptill stays leg-side of the ball, lets the ball come to him, and deliberately slices underneath the ball to uppercut over the boundary fine of third man"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"wham. A shimmy out of his crease this time, and he converts Archer's length ball into a half-volley, and extends his arms through the line to drive it back past the startled bowler, at shoulder height"

"shortish outside off, jumps up to ride the bounce and chops it down to third man"
"fullish, angling into middle stump. Guptill comes forward and plays a little uncertainly, looking to clip through the leg side while playing for a bit of outswing. Doesn't swing, and a thick inside edge runs away towards long leg"

"length ball slanting away from off stump, gets a stride forward and punches towards backward point"

"length ball on middle and leg, clipped away through backward square leg"

"similar ball, back of a length and straightening towards middle and leg. Tucked away to the left of midwicket this time"
"length ball, swings back in late, towards middle and leg, as Nicholls looks to push forward and defend. Inside-edge onto pad, and runs away wide of second slip"
"Given! And Guptill consults with his partner for an age before reviewing with a couple of seconds left on the clock. Length ball, nips back in off the seam, and Guptill, looking to drive on the up through mid-off, is beaten on the inside edge. Hits the bent back leg, just above the flap of the pads. Impact is in line with middle and off, and the ball is hitting middle stump two-thirds of the way up. Why did he review that if there was no edge? Chris Woakes gets the first wicket of the World Cup final, with a lovely delivery that went off the seam in the opposite direction to how he usually swings it"
"greets him with a fifth-stump outswinger, and Williamson gets on the front foot and leaves it alone"
"again the line is fifth stump. A good-length ball with a bit of late outswing, and Williamson won't be tempted into playing at it"
"length ball angling into off stump, defended off the front foot into the point region"
"ooh, lovely. This one's not as full as the previous ball, and it's pitched in the fourth-stump channel. Williamson is unsure whether to play or leave, and he kind of ends up halfway between the two as the ball straightens past his outside edge"
"shortish, and there's some extra bounce at 145kph. Straightens into Nicholls from a middle-and-leg line, and the ball beats the inside edge of his defensive bat and hits him on the stomach"
"back of a length, close to off stump. Jumps back and across to defend, and the ball straightens and hits the inside half of the bat and rolls gently between his legs. He has no idea where the ball is, but Williamson calls for a quick single and he immediately responds"
"short ball, rising to shoulder height in the corridor outside off, Williamson leaves it, swaying his upper body out of the way"
"ooh, that's massive outswing, most of it after passing the edge. Lovely length, fourth-stump line, and Williamson is half-forward to defend, and the ball swings past the edge and then swings some more before reaching the keeper"
"bouncer, rising steeply and without apparent effort over middle and off. Ducks his head and shoulders hurriedly out of the way"
"length ball close to off stump, defended with soft hands into the cover point region. Thinks of the quick single, but the fielder rushing in makes him decide against it"
"length ball slanting across to off stump, defended to mid-off. Not much footwork there, just played that from the crease while staying nice and compact"
"this one isn't compact at all. Back of a length, widish line outside off, and he has a big slash at it away from his body and misses"
"back of a length, straightens into the fourth-stump channel, gets back and across for the straight-bat punch down the pitch"
"overpitched, but Nicholls can't find the gap with his drive. Hits it to the right of mid-off, not far enough to beat him, and sets off for a quick single. Has to stretch at the end to beat Roy's throw at the non-striker's end. Doesn't hit the stumps and he'd probably have been just in anyway"

"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"length ball close to off stump, gets behind it and defends back to the bowler"

"length ball angling into off stump, leans forward and meets the ball right under his eye to tuck it gently to the right of midwicket"
"appeal for lbw, and Nicholls shows the umpire his bat. Bounce may have taken it over the stumps too. Pitches just short of a length on middle or thereabouts, and straightens in past the back-foot defensive. May have kissed inside edge through to thigh pad"
"length ball on middle and off, defended back to the bowler"
"back of a length, nips in a little but down the leg side. Williamson thinks of a flick, but decides to lift his bat over his head in the end"

"fullish on off stump, met with a checked drive to mid-off"

"short and wide, and he gets across to cut, but straight to backward point"

"shortish outside off, chopped to third man"
"another offcutter, back of a length outside off. Stops on Williamson and he chops it away to deep point"
they've taken a bunch of singles and Plunkett's had to keep changing his angle as a result. Sends down a full one on the pads and Nicholls puts it away with a flick to the backward square leg boundary
"full, wide outswinger, and Williamson chases it with a big drive and misses. Harsh call of wide, maybe"
"wide-ish line again, more outswing, but this one's shorter. Williamson has an uncharacteristic jab at it away from his body, and misses"

"shortish, a bit of width, punched to deep point"
"fullish, swinging down leg, misses the flick and the ball rolls off the pad to fine leg. 153kph!"
"shortish, angling down leg. Looks to flick initially, and then decides against it"
"short, angling down leg but not as far. A little shorter than the previous ball too, and Williamson swivels to hook it fine, to the left of the keeper. I suspect it came off glove, but Williamson won't mind that"
"short and slanting into the hips from round the stumps, Nicholls sizes up this one on the back foot. Swivel-pulled away to the left of deep square leg. Has the sliding Stokes done his half at the boundary?"

"back of a length and much straighter, Nicholls sits back and tickles a single through the square-leg region"
"wide of the crease, back of a length and holds its line outside off. There's a wide slip in place, but Williamson dabs it away past him and finds deep third man"

"pitched up and holds its line outside off, Williamson opens the face and creams it away, but Morgan swoops down on the ball at short cover"
"Plunkett thinks he has Williamson. Umpire Dharmasena does not budge. <strong>Morgan wants a  review</strong>. Good length, angling in towards off from over the wicket, kicking up and nipping away outside off. Williamson is undone by the cross-seamer as he drives at it fairly away from his body. Replays indicate that the ball moves away just enough, scratches the outside edge and Buttler gobbles that up. Plunkett returns to the attack and claims the prize scalp of Williamson. That's why England pick him ahead of Moeen"

"and he strikes first ball, and Taylor can't review because his old pal Martin Guptill used up New Zealand's only one. Length ball angling in from wide of the crease, and Taylor, shuffling across his crease, misses one as he plays around his front leg looking to work the ball square on the leg side. To me it seemed to bounce a fair amount, and it struck him above the knee-roll. Would that have hit the stumps?

"length ball outside off, with a bit of extra bounce. Slapped away to deep point"
"full-toss, about stump high, angling into leg stump. England are looking to deny Neesham any room here, they know he's looking to stay leg side of the ball, so they're angling it into his body. Is a little surprised by that ball and looks to jab it away, but can't put bat to ball and is hit on the thigh pad"
"back of a length outside off, chopped into the point region"

"shortish, not too much width outside off to free the arms, jabbed to backward point"

"slower length ball on off stump, lets it come on and dabs towards backward point"
"wow. That's back of a length, gets up to waist height on middle stump, and this is more of a flick than a pull from Latham, picks it up and dumps it one-bounce, over the backward square leg boundary"
"full now, on middle stump, clipped gently into the leg side, asking Archer to run in a fair distance  from mid-on"
back of a length on middle stump. Stays leg-side of the ball and jabs into the backward point region
"shot of the innings. Length ball angling into  a fourth-stump line, and he takes a small step forward, and transfers his weight perfectly into a checked push to the right of extra-cover that leaves deep point attempting a futile sprint to his left"
"excellent response. Similar length, but a touch shorter, and it straightens off the seam to beat the outside edge as Latham looks for another front-foot push"
"back of a length outside off, dabbed down to third man"
"back of a length, again it nips away slightly off the seam in the corridor. Neesham watches it well and plays late, dabs to backward point"

"length ball on off stump, stays leg-side of the ball and jabs it away to deep point"

"length ball angling away from off stump, opens his bat face and glides it fine of third man"

"boundary, wicket. There's that Plunkett cross-seamer that doesn't quite come onto the bat as expected. Fullish on off stump, but it sits up a little off the pitch, and Neesham just doesn't time that attempted loft over mid-on. Comes off the bat with a weird clunk, and Root takes a straightforward catch at mid-on. Three wickets now for Plunkett. What a final he's having."
"back of a length outside off, steered down to third man"
"back of a length outside off, de Grandhomme is off the mark with a chop to the right of third man"

"full now, on middle and leg, clipped away with terrific timing to the right of deep square leg, where Bairstow makes a super diving save"

"slower ball on off stump, clipped towards deep midwicket"
"short ball angling away from off stump, pulled to deep midwicket. That's the extra fielder on the boundary - and two successive balls have been hit there, once by the right-hander and once by the left-hander"
"lovely slower ball, back of a length close to off stump. Again there's no feet from de Grandhomme, pushes at it and misses"
"ooh, well bowled. Fuller now, another legcutter, pitching on off stump. CdG looks to whip through midwicket, and at the last moment checks himself, and the ball squirts along the ground to short cover off the leading edge. End of a fantastic, and possibly match-defining 10 overs from Plunkett"
"length ball on leg stump, clipped to the left of mid-on"
"another legcutter beats the leaden-footed de Grandhomme's outside edge. Back of a length, in the corridor, and he simply pushes at it with his hands"
"ouch! Follows up with a slippery short ball on off stump. Gets up above the right shoulder, and de Grandhomme <b>top-edges his hook into the top of his helmet, just above the badge</b>, and the ball pops up in the air but safely to the left of backward point. Out comes the physio to check on de Grandhomme"
"full, angling away from off stump, driven to the right of mid-off"
"full on off stump, driven firmly and straight to mid-off, and they chase the quick single anyway. Makes it safely to the danger end in the end"
"slower ball, full, ends up outside leg stump, and Latham swings too early through the attempted flick"
"bouncer over middle and off, Latham ducks low to evade it"
"full on the pads, clipped to long leg"
"slower length ball on off stump, lets it come and dabs behind point with an open face"
"ooh, that's a difficult bouncer to deal with. Wide of the crease, angling into the stumps, and in the end it only probably gets up to shoulder height, and de Grandhomme ducks awkwardly. Hits his left shoulder and ricochets beyond the reach of the keeper trying to leap up to his left with one glove extended. Evasive action, so it counts as leg byes"
"drifts onto the pads and he clips it away towards long leg. They see it's Rashid fielding it and immediately decide on running two. The throw isn't the strongest, and Buttler has to leave his post by the stumps to collect it on the bounce"
"slower ball, back of a length outside off, chopped down to third man"
"shuffles across to off stump and Wood slants his short ball wider. Has to fetch the pull from outside off, from shoulder height, and he hits it uppishly, but fortunately for him without too much power, so it doesn't carry anywhere near deep midwicket coming in off the boundary"
"slower ball, fullish and on middle stump, clipped to the left of mid-on"
"slower ball, shortish, just outside off. Swings too early into the pull, and the ball hits him on the back and ricochets towards third man. Third blow to his body today?"
head-high bouncer over off stump. Stays leg-side of it and tennis-smashes it into the midwicket region
"slower bouncer outside off, and de Grandhomme sways out of the way. Not sure he picked the change of pace. Signalled wide, though, and that brings up New Zealand's 200"
"digs it in short outside off, extra bounce imperils the flat-bat slap, and he top-edges it, but the ball doesn't balloon far enough for Stokes, running in from point, to be able to catch it"
"he's hit on the back for the second time this over. Another slower short ball outside off, and again he swings too early on the pull. Runs away to third man for a leg bye"
"attempts the yorker this time, ends up bowling it down the leg side, past the attempted flick"
"third wide of the over. Bouncer, Latham ducks, but it's the line that's the issue - outside leg - rather than the height"
"back of a length on off stump, gets back and across and tucks it into the square leg region"
"slower length ball, angling away from off stump. Looks to step across and swipe it away through midwicket, but the angle only allows him to play it to mid-on"
"hits that hard length and slants it away from off stump. Can't drive, can't pull, so he ends up playing an in-between diagonal bat swat, and can't put bat to ball"
"what a shot. A touch too full this time, on leg stump, and he clears his front leg slightly and whips it up and over wide long-on"
"another blow to the body. Slower short ball, swivels through the pull too early and is hit on the stomach"
"bouncer, gets over shoulder height and he hooks a little uppishly, but into the gap to the right of fine leg. de Grandhomme wants the second, he's sent back, and a more accurate throw to the keeper might have ended his innings. As it happened, Buttler had to run towards the silly point area to collect, and then he spun around and threw the stumps down, and the batsman was juuuust in"
"bouncer, CdG ducks under it"
"back of a length on off stump, opens up and whips it away to deep midwicket"
"low full-toss on the stumps, and de Grandhomme gets his feet out of the way to whip to the left of deep midwicket"
"slower ball, full, on off stump, clipped towards deep midwicket"
"shortish, angling into the body. Looks to step across outside off and whip towards fine leg, but all he manages is glove onto thigh pad, and the ball lobs up gently and drops a few feet short of the keeper"
"looks to make room this time, can't get any power on this full slower ball on the stumps, jabs it along the ground to mid-on"
"slower bouncer over off stump, swivels too early through the pull and misses"
"full, slanting away from off stump, slower ball, driven to the right of mid-off"
"slower ball, back of a length on off stump, gets across to clip to the left of fine leg"
"back of a length on off stump, looks to work it wide of mid-on, initially, but adjusts once the ball straightens off the seam. Off the leading edge towards backward point"
shuffles across early and Woakes slants a slower length ball wider outside off. Swiped away to deep square leg
"another slower ball, on the fuller side of a good length on off stump, and de Grandhomme's struggle ends. Looks to whip it over mid-on, plays too early, and balloons a leading edge to mid-off instead"
"slower length ball on off stump, clipped to deep midwicket"
"slower length ball on off stump, clipped away into the backward square leg region. They think of two, but the fielder is off the boundary in a flash to close down the ball"
"shortish ball on off stump, gets on his toes to dab towards backward point"
bouncer rising fast and steep over leg stump. Latham has no option but to duck
"slower ball, ends up as a full-toss wide of off stump. Slapped to extra-cover on the 30-yard circle"
"low full-toss outside off, jabbed towards mid-off"
"slower short ball over off stump. Looks to pull, and ends up dragging it to fine leg off the toe end"
"appeal for lbw as Latham looks to shuffle across and whip it leg side. Probably pitched outside leg, I reckon, but England have reviewed. The batsmen sneaked a risky leg bye, and Latham would have been out at the non-striker's end, by a number of feet, had Woakes hit direct, but he missed. <b>Yup, it's pitched well outside leg stump</b>."
"slower length ball close to off stump, slanting away, swatted away to deep midwicket"
"slower bouncer wide of leg stump, and it's run away for five wides. Latham had no option but to leave it, and the ball bounced a second time before reaching Buttler, who'd sidestepped to his right to get behind the ball, only for it to beat him with turn"
"gone, a third wicket for Woakes. England haven't allowed the lofted hits over mid-on/mid-off/extra-cover, and this slower ball, which ends up as a low full-toss outside off stump, is also a hard one to put away. Hits low on the bat as Latham looks to go over mid-off, but he only succeeds in spooning it to the fielder. He goes for 47 - a scrappy innings, which could prove valuable for New Zealand if this pitch remains two-paced"
"whoops, high full-toss, and Woakes will get a warning for this. Slanting across the left-hander, ends up hitting Santner's left shoulder as he aims to swat it away into the leg side"
"another slower ball, full and angling away from off stump. Santner swings early, looking to slog over midwicket, and misses"
"full, close to off stump, driven along the ground to mid-off and they chance the quick single. A direct hit from Wood could have had Santner in trouble at the non-striker's end"
"boom! A rare ball in the slot, angling into off stump, and he clears his front leg and wallops it over midwicket, one bounce and over the rope. Most of England's other 'full' balls have been off-pace, and/or too full to get underneath"
"slower bouncer over leg stump. Shuffles across and looks to hoick it towards fine leg, misses"
"in the blockhole on off stump, makes room and stabs to extra-cover. Another risky single - they have to take all of them - and another failure to hit the stumps. Santner has to slide home, and he may have hurt himself in the process. Seemed a little worse for the wear initially, but he looks okay"
"slower bouncer, and Henry misses the attempted tennis-swat over square leg. Wided for height"
"top of off. Well, usually fast bowlers look to hit top of off on the bounce, and Archer's simply hit it on the full. Looks to clear his front leg and slog it away, but can't put bat to ball"
"slower yorker, angling into middle and leg. Looks to make room, can't find any, stabs it back to the bowler"
looks to make room again and Archer follows him with a blockhole ball. Jabbed to mid-off
"ha. Kind of sums up the latter half of New Zealand's innings, this ball. Santner ducks under a slower bouncer over leg stump. Then he thinks of stealing a bye and decides against it. Archer is just so deceptive, you can't blame Santner for it"
"gone first ball? No? Marais Erasmus doesn't think it's out, but that looked pretty close, and New Zealand <b>have reviewed</b>... It's the trademark Boult inswinger from left-arm over, past Roy's attempt at a straight-bat drive to mid-on. No inside edge... Pitching on around middle stump, and it's <b>umpire's call on leg stump</b>! Roy survives. Just. What saved him, I think, was that he was playing with a straight bat. If he'd gone further across with his front leg and played across it, the umpire might have been more inclined to give it out"
"full again, more off-stumpish this time. Pushes at it with firm hands and it runs down to third man off the outside half of the bat"
"fullish, fourth-stump channel, straightens slightly. Left alone"
"back of a length, holds its line outside off, defended off the back foot"
"looks to flick, ball swings past his inside edge and hits his pad, but this one's clearly missing leg stump"
"ooh, this one swings in from about middle and off and was probably headed for leg stump. Bairstow plays a hurried flick and the ball squirts off the inside half of his bat to that short square leg fielder"
"nice and full, slanting in on middle, flapped in the air...but does not carry to short midwicket"
"<strong>Henry chops Roy into half</strong>! Good length, angling in, swinging back in up the slope, <strong>beats the inside edge and the off stump</strong>"
"whoa, another cracker! On a length, comes in with the angle from over the wicket. Henry tricks Roy into playing for the angle, but it snakes away like a fast legcutter. <strong>Opens up Roy and beats the outside edge this time</strong>"
"Roy dashes down the track, Henry pulls his length back. Quietly bunted to mid-on"
"shorter and just a shade outside off, forced to mid-off"
"a bit too full on middle, Roy leans into this overpitched ball and drives with the full face of the bat, nutmegging YJB. <strong>Caressed straight of mid-on</strong>. Well, that was an eventful over"
"fuller than a good length, angling away outside off, moving past the tramline, off-side wide from Boult"
"<strong>Boult lets rip a full inswinger</strong>, YJB plays around his front pad and flicks to short midwicket"
"shorter and swings back in, Boult catches YJB in a tangle. Pings the back thigh and wanders away to cover"
"pitched up and angling across off, Boult encourages YJB to drive. He doesn't move his feet and <strong>drags an inside edge past leg stump</strong>"
"Whoa, pitches around leg stump and <strong>hoops back in sharply</strong>. Near-yorker length, Roy is in a tangle, nutmegs him and fizzes through to the keeper. Was there a woody sound there? No that didn't hit the furniture"
"Roy gives himself some swinging room, Boult goes shorter and outside off. Roy stays leg-side of the ball and clatters it away between covers and point. That's some riposte"
"back of a length and on the stumps, Roy stands tall and punches the ball straight of mid-off"
"good length and angling in from over the wicket, but does not threaten off stump. Left alone in the channel"
"fuller, angling in towards off, then straightens away late. That's how he got Rohit in the semi-final. That's how he has got a lot of wickets this World Cup. This <strong>does too much to scratch the outside edge</strong>"
"full on the pads, picked away through square leg"
"good length, angling in, straightens around off, Bairstow pokes off the outside edge behind point"
shorter and angling into a leg-side clip to short midwicket
"length ball on middle, Roy races down the track, aims to biff it over mid-on. He just about skies it over the fielder running back"
"pitched up and swinging into middle, clipped away to midwicket"
"back of a length, <strong>hoops back in on middle</strong>, thumps the back thigh and rolls to the slip cordon"
"on a length and outside off, Bairstow senses a scoring opportunity. He drags himself forward and drives on the up between point and the covers. Pinged off the middle of the bat"
"Boult responds with a well-directed bouncer on leg stump, forces the batsman to duck under it"
"swinging full-toss outside off, Bairstow latches onto this loose ball and creams it between covers and mid-off this time"
"shortish and around off stump, Bairstow carefully defends back to Boult to close out the over"
"on a length and angling in on a fourth-stump line, punched on the up to mid-off"
"regally punched on the up once again, this time Roy pierces the gap between covers and mid-off. He rocks forward and cracks it away"
"much fuller from Henry, angling in towards off and then nibbling away late to beat the outside edge. Roy gets away with the drive"
"<b>this is trademark Henry</b>! New Zealand finally have their man. Nice and full, angling in towards off stump, this is what Henry does with the new ball. He makes you play. And this ball straightens away late. Roy feels for the moving ball and nicks it off. Not too dissimilar to how Rohit was dismissed in the semi-final. Nice catch from Latham - bending forward to grab a low chance"
"good length and slanting in at off, Root pats it to point"
"much fuller and sliding in at off stump, Root covers up in defence and keeps it out"
"pitched up and angling across off, driven fluently off the front foot to mid-off"
"shorter and swinging back into the hips, deflected away to short square leg"
another inswinger but Boult sends it down the leg side

"back of a length and angling across off, Bairstow stretches out and glides it away towards point"

"good length and angling in at off stump, Root gets right behind the line and blocks back to the bowler"
"full and homing in at off stump again, Root is right forward to deal with it"
Root walks down the pitch and forces a a single between mid-off and the covers. He finds some breathing space at the other end

"good length and nibbles away just outside off, Bairstow does not bite this time"
"pitched up and angling away outside off, driven to the right of short cover and left of mid-off"
"shorter and zipping away into Latham's gloves, left alone in the channel"

"good length and angling in at middle, Root taps it defensively to mid-on"
Root gets on top of a short ball outside off and punches crisply to cover
"good length, nibbling in at off and then swings away outside off.  Root does well not to chase the moving ball. He plays inside the line and allows himself to get beaten"

"short and darts back in at top of off, stabbed back off the back foot to Henry"
"full, swings in at middle to mess with Root's leg-side flick. Chipped in the air to square leg"

"on a length and on a fifth-stump line outside off, run away towards point"
back of a length and angling into a defensive little push to mid-on
"What have you done, de Grandhomme? He has <strong>shelled a fairly straightforward return catch</strong>. Neesham has his hands on his head. Pitched up at off stump, Bairstow is early into it and chips a drive. The bowler can't close his hands around it. Pops in, hits the mid-riff, and pops out. What a moment in the game"
"shorter and outside off, run away to point"
"back of a length and outside off, punched through the line to mid-off"
"on a length and angling in at off, Root hangs back and defends"

"back of a length and curves in from over the wicket, Root chops at it but the ball sneaks under his bat"
"yorker, tails in at leg stump from over the wicket, Root is opened up as he scoops a leading edge to cover. <strong>That's three maidens in a row</strong>."
YJB breaks the sequence of dots by tucking this length ball on middle into the midwicket region
"looks like an offcutter outside off, really full, jammed to mid-off"
"full and wobbles in at off, driven back to the bowler. De Grandhomme throws himself to his right to stop the ball"
Root walks down the track and works this with the angle through midwicket. Latham needs to be whisked in to stop the batsmen from leaving the crease

"just short of a good length and outside off, YJB throws his bat at the ball and inside-edges it past leg stump and into the fine-leg boundary. Fifty up for England"

back of a length and angling into a smooth push down to Boult at long-on

"Root loses his patience. He runs down the track, has a wild leg-side mow, and just collects thin air"
"Root searches for the release and instead edges de Grandhomme behind. Routine catch behind the stumps for Latham. Good length and swings away wide outside off, Root chases a drive, plays a long way away from the body and tickles it to the keeper. Credit to Henry too - he gave up just one run off 18 balls to Root"
length ball slanting across to off stump. Waits on it and dabs to third man to get off the mark

"back of a length, angling across to off stump, stabbed towards backward point with an open face"
"length ball on middle stump, stays leg-side of the ball and steers it past the diving backward point fielder. Third man has a long way to run to his left, and they hurry through for two"
"full now, and Morgan plays around it while attempting to flick. No lbw appeal, because it pitched outside leg. Morgan's back foot is staying resolutely on leg stump, and possibly moving away as well. Moving from middle stump to leg stump, in fact, as replays show"
"bouncer now, over leg stump. Morgan ducks under"
"bouncer, homing in on Morgan's front shoulder. An ungainly whipped hook, manages to keep it down in front of fine leg"
"full, angling into middle stump, punched to mid-on"
"down the track and CdG floats a slower ball wide of off stump. Reaches out to try and launch it over mid-off, doesn't middle it, and it lands juust beyond Williamson's reach as he turns around and gives chase"

"shortish, tucked off the hips to fine leg"
"length ball outside off, and that's a beautiful shot from Bairstow, bat meeting ball on top of the bounce and whippy wrists forcing it past the cover fielder to his right"
"bowled 'im! Back of a length, close to off stump, too close to be trying to force away square on the off side. Jumps up to ride the bounce, jabs at it with an angled bat, and inside-edges onto his stumps. Ferguson now has more middle-overs wickets than any other bowler at this World Cup. He's gone past Mitchell Starc"
"shortish, too straight, whipped off the hip to fine leg"

"fullish, angling across to off stump, driven to sweeper cover"
"length ball, fifth-stump line, left alone"

"looks to step out again, and de Grandhomme slides down the leg side in an attempt to cramp him for room with a full one"
"shortish, fairly wide of off, and Stokes plays and misses, looking to punch it square. Sticks in the pitch a little and nips away off the pitch"
"back of a length on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"

"in the blockhole on middle stump, jabbed back to the bowler"
"back of a length on leg stump, stays leg-side of it, hops, and defends back to the bowler"
"that's a brute of a bouncer at 145kph, and it nearly decapitates Morgan as he falls over backwards, onto his backside, to evade it. The umpires are checking for something... Having a word with Morgan, checking if he's okay, basically. It <b>grazed his helmet</b> as it went through, and Morgan took his eye off the ball"
"full, too straight, misses the flick but picks up leg byes to the left of fine leg"
"back of a length on leg stump, stays leg-side of the ball and blocks it back to Ferguson"
"another bouncer, slanting across over middle stump this time, and Morgan can keep his eye on it and sway away. The bouncer is too hot to handle for Tom Latham, however, and it eludes his gloves as he jumps up, arms outstretched"
"back of a length on off stump, chopped to cover point"
"fullish, angling into middle stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"back of a length on off stump, stands tall and chops it away on top of the bounce, but this is a slow pitch and he can't really hit it square. Drags it to extra-cover"
"down the track again, and though he doesn't get close to the pitch of the ball, this time it's short enough for him to whip it away through square leg, with a strong swivel at the hips"
"back of a length on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"length ball, a bit of inward movement towards middle stump. Defended solidly towards midwicket with the straightest of bats"
"back of a length on middle stump, defended to mid-on"
"and he strikes first ball! Or he will have, if this catch is deemed to be clean. What a bit of work on the point boundary from Lockie Ferguson! Wide length ball, carved away in the air, and Lockie sprints in from the boundary, throws himself forward, and grabs it two-handed, perfectly clean, a couple of inches off the ground. The soft signal was out, but the soft signal doesn't matter at all, because the replays were so conclusive. We've seen some outstanding catches at this World Cup. This is among the top three. Or four. Or five. Or one."
"back of a length, angling into the legs, tucked away through square leg"
"length ball outside off, nice stride forward for a push into the point region"
"fullish, slanting away into a sixth-stump line. Go ahead, drive me, says Neesham. Stokes leaves it alone"
"again he angles across into that wide line, dangling it up pretty full. Again Stokes ignores the bait"
"ooh, what a delivery! Neesham was so delighted that it seemed initially like he was celebrating a wicket. Back of a length, slanting away before nipping back wickedly off the seam. Stokes doubles over as he jabs down on the ball, which beats his inside edge and soars over off stump"

"length ball outside off, opens his bat face to guide it to third man"
"length ball close to off stump, Buttler uses those wrists to work it to deep square leg"

"back of a length on off stump, lets it come and defends"
"a bit fuller on middle stump, clipped to deep square leg"
"full, angling away into that wide line again. This time he gets a big stride forward and across to drive to the left of deep point. They run a second, and there's a brief recourse to the third umpire to see if Stokes beat the throw home to the keeper. He had, comfortably"
"full on off, driven to mid-off"

"length ball angling into middle and leg, clipped towards midwicket"
"back of a length outside off, punched to extra-cover"
"extra bounce, and was there an edge? No idea, but Latham puts it down, standing up to the stumps. Length ball outside off, and the bounce sneaks it past - or grazes - Stokes' outside edge as he looks to push into the covers with an angled bat. We'll need to see replays"
"back of a length, angling into middle stump, worked away through square leg"
"back of a length outside off, this ball on this pitch comes on to the bat too slow for Stokes to slap it through point, ends up hitting it to cover instead"
"down the track and that's serious power. Gets fairly close to the pitch of one angling away from him, and the angle allows him to free his arms. Flat-bats it hard past the bowler's right hand, making umpire Dharmasena take cover"
"shortish, down the leg side, can't connect with the flick off the hip"
"down the track again and Neesham shortens his length, bowls it at Stokes' body. Pulled off the hip to deep square leg"
"slower length ball outside off, Buttler gets a nice stride forward to drive, and short extra-cover dives left to stop it"

back of a length close to off stump. Looks for the push into the covers and it holds up on the surface and rolls through square leg off the inside edge

"back of a length outside off, dabbed down to third man"
"length ball on off stump, punched to short extra-cover"
"ooh, what a delivery. Length ball, pitching outside off and nipping in like an offbreak. Comes forward to drive through the covers, leaves a gap between bat and pad, and it sneaks through and doesn't miss off stump by much. Ricochets off Latham's glove into the fine leg region"

"back of a length outside off, a bit of width to free his arms and drive to the right of mid-off"

"back of a length, angling away from off stump, punched to deep point"
"back of a length on off stump, punched to the right of mid-off"
"ooh, in the air, but in the gap too. Short, not a whole lot of width, but Buttler gets off his feet, rides the bounce, and carves it away to the right of backward point. Guptill's the fielder there, though, and his athletic dive and one-handed stretch make it look like a chance when it probably wasn't"

"slower variation from Henry. Back of a length, 121ks, cuts in, beats the inside edge as well as the off stump"
"Buttler plays around his front pad, trying it work it over the leg side, and falls over. Umpire Dharmasena shakes his head. Not given out lbw. Williamson challenges the on-field not-out decision. This seems to be heading down leg, though. Nicely pitched up, veers back in to ping the front pad below the knee-roll in line with middle and leg. Yup, that's missing leg stump and Dharmasena (finally) gets it right"
"short and angling into middle, punched past the right of Neesham at short midwicket. Ferguson swoops down on the ball in the outfield. Stokes is wary of it and sends Buttler back"

chipped in the air over the non-striker's head as this length ball on middle stops on Buttler and messes with his timing

"short at the hips, nudged through square leg for one more"
"back of a length and angling in on a fourth-stump line, no movement in the air or off the seam, forced down to long-on"
"<strong>There goes Jos the Boss</strong>. Third man is in the deep, but it does not matter as long as you can scoop the ball fine of him. Fullish and outside off, Buttler, premeditated, jumped a long way across off and Buttler-ed it away to the boundary. Buh-bye, Henry"

"dug in shorter and fizzing away outside off, Stokes rises on top of the bounce and punches the ball to short cover"

"short on the hips, Stokes picks it away to deep midwicket off the back foot"
"rapid bouncer outside off, 147ks, Buttler thinks about a hook, but bails out belatedly and rocks out of the way. Prancing delivery from Ferguson"

"another top yorker on off, this time from Ferguson, jabbed down to mid-off"

"lifter outside off, gets big on Buttler, who aims to force it through the off side. No dice. Beaten"
"It's <em>that</em> man Lockie Ferguson who breaks the stand and the game open for New Zealand. Buttler holes out to Southee, the sub, at sweeper cover. Slower variation once again from Ferguson, 123ks, full and outside off. He asks Buttler to manufacture the pace for himself. Buttler just skews it in the air. Southee initially misjudged the flight of the ball. He moved to his left, then to his right, then sprinted in to grab a pressure catch sliding on his knees"

"slower ball outside off, Woakes stays leg-side of the ball and slices it down to deep third man"
"pretty full and slanting in at off stump, Stokes brings his bottom hand into play and shovels it away to the right of deep midwicket. Almost looked like the left-hander's version of Dhoni's helicopter. Muscled away"
"<strong>Two in two for Ferguson!</strong> Is this the game? Banged in short on off stump, rushes Woakes for pace, and draws a top-edge as the batsman sets up for a hook. The ball drops from the London skies, a nervous Latham makes a fairly simple catch looks difficult. He keeps his eyes on the ball and clings onto it in the end"
"short and angling across off, spliced to Williamson at the edge of the circle at mid-off"
"delightful offcutter from Ferguson, 122ks, grips and sneaks in, beating the inside edge"
"another slower ball on middle, picked away straight to midwicket"
"back of a length and angling into middle, Plunkett sizes it up and slugs it over midwicket. He absolutely middled that, Plunkett"
"Ferguson finishes his spell with another magical slower ball outside off, Plunkett does not spot it. He swings waaaaay too early, loses his shape, and watches the ball float to Latham"
"muscled away between deep midwicket and deep square leg. Boult searches for a yorker, but misses his length marginally. Stokes gets under it and launches it over the boundary like a boss"
"near-yorker on leg stump, squeezed away behind square. Henry hunts down the ball at long leg"
"length ball on middle, clubbed away to the right of long-on. Santner swoops to his right and collects the ball. He made a similar superb stop at the edge of the boundary against India. NZ are switched on under pressure. Stokes stands between them and WC glory"
"short and angling across off stump, Plunkett aims to bosh it over the leg side. He can't touch it and that's a dot"
"full-toss on leg stump, Plunkett pumps it in the air, but it does not carry to Santner at long-on. He tears across to his left and collects the ball"
"middle-stump yorker from Boult, squeezed down to long-on. Santner in the thick of the action once again. He hunts down the ball and keeps it to one"
"slower legcutter, finishes on leg stump, hauled away to the left of deep midwicket. Nicholls moves swiftly to his left and gathers the ball in the outfield"
"<strong>inch-perfect leg-stump yorker,</strong> floors Stokes, clipped to deep square leg. Neesham gets Stokes off the strike"
"Legcutter from Neesham, 114ks, Plunkett aims to launch it over long-off. Nope, he can't clear Boult at the boundary. This was full and outside off, Plunkett got underneath it and swung it in the air... but was done in by the lack of pace"
"Is that six? Yes it is! Crazy scenes at Lord's. Boult nearly pulls off a hokey-pokey catch at the edge of the midwicket boundary. He catches the ball near the boundary, but well the momentum takes his over the ad boards. His foot is on the ad board as he relays the ball to Guptill. Fine margins. It could have been a match-winning catch. Instead, it's a six. Stokes manufactures some swinging room, full on the stumps, Stokes belts it in the air..."
"back of a length on middle stump, punched down to long-on. Just a single for Stokes"
"Archer bags a first-ball duck in the final. Pressure can make you do strange things. Another legcutter variation, full on middle, Archer does not spot it. He swings for the hills, deflects this slower ball off the pad onto the stumps"

"mighty full and outside off, not quite a perfect yorker, jabbed more or less straight to Williamson at extra-cover"
"Whacked over midwicket. Lord's raises itself to a massive roar. Boult ditches the yorker. Slower ball, full and outside off, in the slot. Stokes drops down to one knee and smokes a slog-sweep over midwicket"
"It's all happening at Lord's. Full-toss on middle, smeared away to deep midwicket. Guptill attacks the ball and sets himself up for a direct hit. It might have well been a direct hit had Stokes not inadvertently deflected it away with his outstretched bat, diving forward to save himself from being run-out. The deflection ensures the ball tickles away to the boundary. It's six runs in the end. Wouldya believe it? It's ridiculous"
"middle-stump yorker, Stokes backs away outside leg and stabs it down to long-off. Santner hunts down the ball at long-off and throws it to Boult, who takes the bails off in ice-cool fashion. Stokes had to go for the second, he had to be on strike, but Rashid is caught short by a long way. Gone for a duck without facing a ball"
"<strong>Holy Moly! It's a freaking tie</strong>. We're not done yet. We will have a Super Over to decide the winner of the 2019 World Cup. This is a full-toss on middle, Boult searches for the yorker, but can't get it right, hacked down to long-on. The fielder hares in, gathers the ball. Stokes tears back for the second, Wood dishes out a desperate full-length dive, but the throw is to the bowler's end and Wood is caught metres short"
