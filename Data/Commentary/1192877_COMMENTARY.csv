he's off the mark straightaway by using the inswinger from off and middle towards mid off for a quick single
takes a step across and wants to whip the ball to leg but gets a thick inside edge onto his pads as the ball swung in
"loud appeal from Southee alone for lbw, it was an inswinger again but it struck him just outside leg and was going down the leg side. Nearly in the block hole, but the line wasn't accurate"
"knuckle ball already at 107kmh outside off, Kusal waits and punches it down to mid on"
"throws his bat at this inswinger, gets an inside edge and the ball goes to short fine leg. Not playing too much with a straight bat here"
"inswinging yorker on leg stump, Kusal does well to flick it away for one"
"swings and angles it away from Kusal, unlike Southee. Kusal hardly moves his feet and chases the ball to get beaten"
"tries the outswinging yorker around off, Kusal watches and defends it back"
"errs towards the leg side now with that offcutter at 115kmh, Kusal tries to whip and gets a run to short fine leg"
"shapes it away nicely outside off on length, Gunathilaka lets it swing and steers it to point"
"<strong>beaten</strong> outside off! Excellent seam position outside off, the length makes the batsman drive away from the body, with feet stuck to the crease, and the ball swings away beautifully"
swings it away to end the over too. Gunathilaka is a little more watchful and helps it wide of short third man in the gap for two
"108kmh, an offcutter in the block hole on off, Kusal bunts it down to mid off for one and then signals to his partner with his hand that it was a cutter"
"swinging in nicely from around off, Gunathilaka pushes it into the covers and says no straightaway"
"tries to pull with hard hands, it was slightly short of length. He doesn't quite connect but gets two by just clearing midwicket"
"slower one on the pads, worked away for one wide of mid on"
slightly wide that full toss and Kusal connects but finds cover
"connects yet again and this time he finds mid on. This was swinging in and almost in the block hole, but Kusal wanted to whack it away. He swung his bat down with a lot of force and it went quickly down the ground but mid-on wasn't too far"
"first boundary, finally, for Sri Lanka, and it's off a slower ball. Gunathilaka made room early, Rance followed him with the full delivery and Gunathilaka drilled it down the ground to beat mid-off"
"he makes room again and gets four more. Short delivery this time, it hardly bounces and that's easy for Gunathilaka to smash through the gap in the covers"
"he errs with the line, probably expecting him to back away again but Gunathilaka has tickled that fine for four more. Gunathilaka moved just a bit towards off, the ball had a hint of shape towards leg stump and the batsman did enough to help that along the way"
"<strong>nearly a run out</strong> with a return throw from Rance, there's some adrenaline there! Gunathilaka defended the straighter delivery back and came out of the crease before Rance got to it with his right hand and threw it right back. Gunathilaka turned around and made it just in time, even though Rance missed"
"a bit short, a bit of shape into Gunathilaka and he whips that for four more! The fourth four of the over as Gunathilaka stays back in the crease to let the ball come in and then use his wrists to beat short fine leg"
"outside off, there's some room and he steers it wide of third man for two"
<strong>he strikes first ball</strong>! There wasn't much room because of the angle and Kusal chipped that a bit late behind square on the leg side and it flew quickly and flat to short fine leg. Strange reaction from Santner - as if a chance was missed
"pretty accurate around off on length, he blocks it back"
Gunathilaka wanted a run there but he was sent back quickly after Avishka flicked the ball to midwicket
"back to off and middle stump, he blocks it back again"
"opens up a little to free his arms and Santner slows this ball down nicely, Avishka gets an edge as a result onto his pads"
"angling in from outside off, he defends this on the leg side"
brings his bat down with some force to swat that leg-stump delivery to deep square leg
"short, pulled, and <strong>just over mid on</strong>. Avishka saw the slightly short ball angling in from outside off and he stayed back to pull that down the ground, just over the leaping fielder at mid on"
"not much room this time, he punches the ball off the back foot on off"
"<strong>falls just short of midwicket</strong>! Short of length outside off, Avishka tries to slap it on the leg side, doesn't middle it and thankfully for him it lands just in front of Santner"
"bit short and wide this time, he cuts with some power and finds cover point"
"swing and a miss! Around length and well outside off, big swing to finish the Powerplay with a boundary but he doesn't come close"
"reverse sweep straightaway and that wasn't far from the off stump. Turning in just a bit from outside off, Gunathilaka goes for the reverse sweep and doesn't connect"
"that's been referred to the third umpire, a bit close at the bowler's end. Gunathilak almost fell over while driving and was beaten outside off, before being called for a bye by Avishak. Slightly casual running there from Gunathilaka"
"turning away from outside off, punched nicely towards sweeper cover and de Grandhomme fumbles in the deep to concede an easy second"
"<strong>bowled'm with a wrong'un</strong>! Avishka didn't pick that up at all. It pitched around length outside off, turned in a fair bit and Avishka was on the back foot to steer it away after it turned away but it went the other way to knock over off stump"
great effort from Santner at deep cover to run and slide to his right and keep the ball in. It was pitched up and Dickwella drove that nicely through the covers
beats him with a googly after pitching it outside off and the turn misses the outside edge as Dickwella tries to drive
on the leg side and it's worked off the pads for two quick runs. Good running there
"takes some pace away from that, at 124kmh. He tries to poke at that away-going delivery and misses it"
"nice and quick now, hurries on to him around the waist and he defends it just in time"
"bit slower at 121kmh on the leg side, he waits and tucks it a bit wide of short fine leg for one"
"just short of length around the pads, worked away off the hips for one"
"a slightly slower ball at 122kmh to end the over on middle stump, he opens the face of the bat to get one on the off side"
"<strong>loud lbw appeal </strong> from Bruce after that struck him maybe in front of leg stump, and the wrong'un took the bat and pad before going fine on off for a single as he attempted a reverse sweep"
goes for the big heave on the leg side with the turn and gets one
he also goes for the reverse paddle and gets one fine on the off side
and another reverse sweep! This time for the overmatched delivery and straight to short fine leg
"<strong>another wrong'un</strong> and another one beaten! This time it's the well-set Gunathilaka. He pitched it nicely and slow with some flight on leg stump, Gunathilaka went back to defend it but the ball turned away and knocked over the stumps"
"slightly flat and well outside off, he taps the ball to short third man"
"quick and flat angling across, he tries to whips and misses"
"much slower this time through the air, Dickwella wants to work that with the turn to leg but only manages a single"
"pretty tight outside off, dabbed to cover for one"
comes down and slaps that with the turn to long on
"slow and flighted around off, pushed into the covers for another quick single"
reverse sweeps that one against the turn and he does well to clear two fielders in the circle. Short third man goes for the chase and keeps it in
"flatter one outside off, tries to cut but it skids on and beats the bat"
"full outside off, driven to long-off for one"
"full and thrown wide outside off, he skips out and lofts him inside out, over extra cover for a much needed boundary"
"flatter one but overcompensates and pushes it onto his pads, Dickwella accepts it gleefully, taps it on its head for another four"
"another short one on the pads, Dickwella scoops it towards short fine, the fielder gets a hand on it but also a slightly awkward bounce that allows a couple"
"length on middle and leg, pushed into the leg side and they scamper through for another two"
"short one, hurries onto the batsman as he attempts to pull, splices it to midwicket on a couple of bounces"
"length around off, nips back slightly as he tries to tuck it away to the on side, can't connect but the deflection off thigh pad towards third man allows two bonus runs
'"
"Southee tests him with another bouncer, shorter and quicker, he is late in the pull and misses"
"length ball angled in, doesn't rise as much and he goes low with his hands to help it along to deep backward square leg"
"off cutter, angled across, Dickwella can't reach it with his flashing blade"
"another slower one angled across, and this time Dickwella picks it early, adjusts his bat speed and carves it over backward point for four"
"full around off, pushed into the off side for one"
"tossed up on middle and Dickwella's favourite sweep proves to be his undoing on this occasion. He had given his intention of sweeping quite early, Santner held it back, slowed it up, it had a bit of extra bounce and that induced a top edge, taken comfortably at short fine leg"
"full and angled in, pushed to long-on"
"full and angled in again, pushed into the on side with soft hands and they come through for two"
"quicker one, the ball hurries onto the batsman and keeps gathering pace, nearly chopped on"
"lovely change up, tossed this one up nicely and really slowed it down, the batsman picked it late but managed to tap it on the off side for one"
"slower ball, full and angled in, nudges towards square leg for one"
another slower one but slides down the leg side
"another slower one, fuller and straighter, pushed back to the bowler on the walk"
"length outside off, normal seam up delivery, he takes a few steps down the wicket and pushes it to long-off"
"full and swinging away a touch but it's the full pace delivery with a hint of width, he uses it hands beautifully and steers it past point for four"
"full on the pads this time, tucked away to deep backward square for a couple"
""
"full on the pads, pushed to long-on for one"
"length outside off, flatter delivery and he goes down on one knee and hammers a slog sweep, flat and hard and into the boundary in a flash"
"short outside off this time, pulled to long-on, only one this time"
"full toss on middle and off, picks it up towards long-on for one"
"googly outside off, he goes for the sweep again but this was slower and had a bit of extra bounce that induces a top edge that carries all the way to deep backward square leg"
"another googly, has to play around his front pad having planted his foot forward, but manages to push it into the on side for a couple"
"slow and on a length around off, goes back and pushes it into the off side for one"
"quicker and flatter outside off, attempts the dab but is beaten"
"fuller and slower, squares him up and beats the bat"
"<strong>and Santner returns to the party again!</strong> Fired this one in fuller and straighter, the batsman was trying to work it to the on side after walking down the wicket, had to play around his front pad and missed to be adjudged lbw"
turns from around off and whizzes past the forward prod
"fired in on around middle, defended"
"length outside off, pushed uppishly past point and down to third-man's right for a couple"
"full and swinging away a touch, pushed into the covers for one"
"full outside off, pushed to deep cover-point for one"
"full around off, pushed wide off long-off and they came back for two"
"length outside off, steered to third man"
"full toss outside off, pushed to deep cover point, Udana takes off for the second blind and is stranded mid pitch by the time he sees his partner hasn't left his crease, Santner hurls a quick return from the deep to the keeper, who lobs it back to the bower to effect the run-out at the non striker's end"
"length around middle, he tries to open the face and steer it down but the deflection isn't good enough to beat the keeper"
"<strong>fast and straight and he hits timber!</strong> He was attempting the dab shot again, it skidded through at pace, and crashed into the stumps"
"length around off, defends to the off side"
"banged in on a length outside off, he slashes and misses"
"yorker angled in, he squeezes it away off a thick inside edge past short fine leg for two"
"length and angled in, backs away and defends back to the bowler"
"slower ball, full outside off, he throws his bat at it and it carries to a running CDG, who came in from deep cover but spilled it"
"length around off, pushed to point"
"another slower ball, he swings and doesn't get all of it as it trickled away towards long-on but the lack of timing allows two"
"another slower one, he swings again but only manages to push it back to the bowler without any power"
"quicker and fuller outside off, Malinga can't reach it but a harsh call of wide by the look of it"
"slower one banged into the surface, doesn't come and on and Malinga can't get it past the bowler at the moment"
"Malinga backs away to swing again, Southee bangs it in and pushes it wide but this one's too wide"
"off cutter outside off, Malinga swings wildly and is through the shot way before the ball arrives. Keeper collects it on a couple of bounces"
"short and fast, banged hard into the surface, he swing across the line but only gets a bit of a bottom edge to the on side for one"
"length and angled in, Malinga backs away and finally connects, but straight to the fielder at deep square leg"
"length outside off, slashed away to deep point and they take on the throw and come through for two"
"short slower one, but down the leg side even after the batsman had backed away"
"length outside off, slashes away to deep point for one"
"length on middle, swung away to deep midwicket for one"
"another one banged in and swung away towards deep midwicket without much power, the lack of pace on the shot allows them to come back for the second, he had to stretch to make his ground as the throw came in and the keeper whipped off the bails but he just about made it with a dive"
"130kmh, hint of inswing around off stump and Munro middles a drive straight to cover with a nice forward lean"
"pulls the length shorter this time and swings it in towards middle stump, Munro called for a quick single straightaway and a fumble at mid-on makes it easier for him"
"nice shape towards off stump from middle, Seifert is squared up a bit and defends it back"
bit more towards middle and leg and Seifert tucks it to leg and is off the mark
"a bouncer at 141kmh, nicely bowled around off stump line and Munro ducks to keep away from it"
"fuller delivery swinging in this time from length, a bit too much towards leg and Munro gets a leg bye towards square leg"
"not too flighted around off, he defends on the off side"
"that's gone really high and it's gone all the way! He saw a lot of flight on the off stump, there was enough time for him to make bit of room and swing hard at that one, it went a bit square of the wicket and just over the boundary line"
the flatter one goes down the leg side
"<b>falls just short of mid-off</b>. Munro wanted to hit that one hard and he did, but it was in the air dangerously and not too far from Malinga"
"bit too short and angling in, he pivots on the back foot and swats it away through the square leg region for four more! Munro doesn't want to leave things late for the lower order"
chips this one in the air and down to long on for one
leans forward carefully and defends into the covers
"slower delivery at 110kmh around off stump, Munro carefully defends into the covers"
another bouncer to Munro and he ducks under it easily
"<b>there comes Malinga's 100th T20I wicket</b> and he has bowled Munro again! Little similar to how he got Munro in the first T20I but this wasn't a yorker. It was swinging in, in pitched on middle stump and it found the gap between Munro's bat and pad to rattle the leg stump. What a sight that is for a fast bowler"
"<strong>loud, loud appeal first ball</strong>, it's turned down and Malinga, the captain, has <b>reviewed</b> immediately. This one also to a left-hander, also swinging in, also missed by the batsman, and he's hit right in front of leg stump after the ball pitched on middle. Ball-tracking says it's <b>hitting</b>, the crowd erupts! It might have looked not out initially but seems like Rutherford took a tiny step towards middle stump which went in Malinga's favour"
"he has done it, three in three, <b>Malinga has taken a hat-trick</b> when his team needs it the most! Dear o dear, they're checking for the no ball and this is so close! The foot is pitching on the line and it seems like, on impact, a fraction of a tiny part of the heel was behind in the crease. It couldn't have been closer than that without being a no ball. And how's this for a hat-trick delivery: a searing yorker with late swing to an in-form Colin de Grandhomme who was squared up and the ball took the base of off and middle stumps. What a sight, what a bowler. He points to the number on his jersey in celebration. It says 99!"
"<strong>FOUR IN FOUR</strong>! Is this the 2007 World Cup all over again?! Ross Taylor this time, and he gets the same treament -  an unplayable yorker. He looked more still than de Grandhomme at the crease but it didn't matter. This one is headed right for the foot, it swings late from around leg to middle stump and it sneaks under Taylor's bat to get him plumb"
"slow offbreak outside off stump, Seifert defends it back"
"a legbreak this time towards off, swept against the turn to short fine leg"
comes down the track and drives that before it pitches to long on
almost hands a catch back to the bowler by going back and chipping the ball in the air
sees an over pitched delivery outside off and he reverse sweeps that fine on the off side to beat shot third man
"bit of confusion but no damage, last thing New Zealand need is a run out. It looked like a legbreak but that went straight and Seifert punched it to deep point. He wanted a second but as sent back just in time"
"a yorker, what else, but it's wide of off stump. He steers it to point off the back foot"
<strong>bang in the block hole</strong>! Seifert stays deep in the crease and watches the ball come right under his nose to block it back. Malinga smiles
he tries the slower yowler and that one probably slips out to go well down leg for a wide
"almost a yorker just outside the off stump, Seifert punches that down to mid off now"
"edged to first slip and it's <strong>five for Malinga</strong>! This crowd is going crazy, the decibel levels are going to break records tonight. This time a length delivery, lovely shape for outswing, it tempts Seifert to drive and he falls for it, edging it to wide slip for a simple catch and Gunathilaka gets both hands to it"
"full and swinging in, it's <b>flicked just over square leg</b>. Santner must have had his heart in his mouth for a split-second there. He flicked it away nicely off the pads and the fielder was there just for that. Santner did well to chip it over though"
nice and solid defence to end the over this time to block the inswinging delivery in front of middle stump
"slow outside off, he defends it back to the right of the bowler for one"
"he gets some room, the ball is straightening and he rocks back on the back foot to punch that nicely through the covers for four"
goes back again to punch it through the covers but this one turns in and he defends it back
beaten outside off this time as he cuts and misses
tossed up a little bit and he drives that down to long off
"appeal for lbw as it hits Mitchell on the front pad. The appeal is turned down and Malinga comes in to <b>review</b>. This pitches on middle stump, it's turning in a long way and it misses the stumps by a long, long way. Sri Lanka lose their review"
a bit of turn but it's a bit short and it's worked down to long-on
goes a long way across to off to paddle that towards fine leg for one
"nicely flighted on off, hint of turn and Santner punches it down to long off"
"hardly any turn outside off, there's room and Mitchell makes use of it with a single through the covers"
really flat and that's gone down leg for a wide. Even the keeper barely got to it
"pretty flat, maybe a flipper, on the off stump and he goes back to get his bat down just in time"
he gets some room this time and cuts that away through the point region to get two in the gap
"outside off, and he pushes that into the covers for one"
"outside off on length, he defends towards cover and Gunathilaka sprints across to get to it quickly"
"hint of room and he punches that through the covers in the gap, two more"
"really good running there and Santner takes two despite slipping! He came forward and got an inside edge towards square, they wanted two right from the word go and Santner even slipped just after turning and he still made it. Excellent effort"
""
"pretty flat on middle and leg, worked down to long on for one"
"<b>is that a run out</b>, looks very close and the batsman might be short. Oh wait, looks like the ball popped out of the keeper's hand when he wanted to whip the bails off. Wait again, the ball has indeed popped out but onto the stumps and Mitchell is short of his ground! Mitchell nudged this length delivery to the leg side with soft hands, and as these two have been doing, they wanted two quick runs and but the throw from the deep was accurate enough to find him short"
"what's happening here, one more for Sri Lanka! The wrong'un makes an appearance again and it's hit the stumps off Kuggeleijn's elbow. IT was slow through the air, outside off, and Kuggeleijn leaned forward to defend it patiently but there was some gap between bat and ball, and the ball took the inside edge to bounce and then deflect off the right elbow before hitting the stumps"
driven down to long on with hard hands for one
"<strong>third wicket in four balls</strong>, third umpire is signalled for this stumping but Santner is walking. Lovely delivery from Akila outside off to draw Santner out of the crease, he stretches his arms to get to the ball but the wrong'un beats the bat, goes past the outside edge and Kusal takes the bails off in a flash. Santner's left leg is well outside the crease"
"comes down the track to take it on the full, and drives it to long on for one"
futile loud appeal for lbw as Southee is struck on the back foot but well outside leg. He didn't pick the googly and went back in the crease and it turned too much
"defends this ball before it can turn much from outside off, back to the bowler"
"slaps this one in the air down to long-on, reaches him after a bounce"
"<b>loud appeal once again</b> for lbw, turned down. This one might have actually hit bat and pad at the same time, but Sri Lanka don't have a review"
he goes back to cut but the ball goes off the inside edge to fine leg for two. There were some appeals there too
""
"<b>loud appeal</b> once again for the nth time this over, and he's been given! It was tossed up, he swept after going across a fair bit to paddle it, he was struck right in front and even though he reviewed it, he is plumb. New Zealand lose their review too"
"short ball, he goes back and pulls it to deep midwicket for two"
turns in sharply and he works it with the spin to leg for one more
"almost gets him! Flat and going across, Rance hardly moves and pokes and misses"
"pitched up this time, drilled back and it goes through the bowler for one"
goes for the slog sweep and he misses it completely
"that looks like a wrong'un, it turned away and he slapped it to sweeper cover for one"
slog-sweeps that into the leg side
turns this one in sharply to cramp him up for room as he backs away
"this one turns in sharply too, bunts it down to long on"
"<strong>loud appeal for lbw</strong>, it was close but turned down. He was on the back foot he was hit on front of leg stump, was it turning too much? Yes, because it turned in from outside off"
"pushes at it outside off, the ball turns in and takes an inside edge to fine leg for three"
flicks this one to leg in the air for a quick single
"full toss and he goes down town, gets plenty on it and clears the ropes"
"googly, misdirected and down the leg side"
"another googly, thrown wider, he swings and misses but called wide"
another one thrown wide but Southee reaches for it and lofts it over long-on again
"googly again, length around middle, goes back and defends"
"<strong>another one, Southee's not giving up!</strong> Flatter length ball on middle and hammered flat and hard over deep square leg on the sweep"
"quicker one on middle, defended"
"full on middle, Southee can't get it away for one, pushes it back to the bowler"
"yorker around leg stump, squeezes it out"
"how did that miss leg stump? Another yorker, he snuck under the bat but somehow, inexplicably went past the leg stump"
"another full one and Seth Rance keeps it out, opens the face and pushes it to point"
"full and straight, pushed to mid-off"
"full toss, angled in, pushed past the diving midwicket and they take a single"
"yorker length around off, Southee pushes it back looking for the single past Malinga but it's not there, and that ends a truly remarkable performance which started with the 100th followed by a hat-trick, which soon became four in four and he then added another"

"googly, skids on as he plays back, keeps it out"
"another googly and another inside edge, this one goes past the leg stump and trickles down to fine leg for two"

"full toss, lofts it down the ground but on the bounce to long-on"
"full around off, defended"
"length around off, Southee shapes to slog him out of the park, changes his mind and defends off the backfoot, the ball nearly rolls back onto the stumps, but Southee kicks it away comically"
"full outside off, misses the reverse sweep, there's an appeal for a stumping, the third umpire is consulted. Southee's backfoot certainly lifted, and it was very very close but it appeared grounded just in the nick of time as the bails came off"
"flat around middle, skidding on, Southee pushes it to deep midwicket"
"full outside off, slider, beats the defensive prod"
"full on middle, whipped to midwicket"
"full from around the wicket, he attempts the sweep, trying to take a straight one from the stumps and that's the end, since New Zealand have no reviews left."
