"some shape right away. A length ball, angled in and straightening on off, defended"
"now that swing works to Rahul's favour as it gives him the room he needs to open up his arms, an imperious punch over the extra cover region"
"fullish, angled in at middle and leg and straightening, Rahul drills off the inside of the bat to backward square leg"
"full and shaping away late outside off, Rahul swings and the ball sneaks past the inside edge"
"ah, jeez, Rahul's been hit on the box attempting a pull. Gets really cramped up for room and the ball bounces off after hitting him there to graze the midriff. Painful"
"ah, shot! The aesthetic value of that is just unbelievable. Rahul simply leans into a punch through the covers, in the process covering for the late movement and using the pace to his advantage as he throws his weight behind it"
"a nice flighted delivery outside off, and Gayle responds with a languid drive through the covers. Good stride forward and neatly splits the field"
"fullish length, looped up around off, defended back"
comes down the track and pats it away against the turn towards mid-on
"length ball outside off, lets it turn before gently tapping it to point"
"back of a length, turns away from middle and off, Gayle waits on the backfoot before turning it away to midwicket"
steps down the track but it's a shorter length and that forces Rahul to resort to a mild push back to the bowler
"ah, has he got away with that? Seemed to drift a long way from the left-hander, nowhere near Gayle's reach, but for some reason, the umpire thought that was fine"
"extremely full outside off, shapes away and sneaks underneath as Gayle jams the bat down"
"full, angled across, a wide yorker, but this time it curves in slightly and pretty late too to have Gayle hitting the ground as he brings the bat down"
"short of a length on off, and a rare quick single from Gayle as he drops it to the left of point and takes off"
"short and banged into his leg stump, and all that leaves Rahul to do is to help it along to deep backward square leg"
"switches over to an off-stump line for this back of a length delivery, Rahul chops a punch towards extra cover"
"shortish, slower through the air and zero turn outside off, Gayle rocks back and flays a cut to the left of point"
now he overcompensates with the line and floats up a fuller one that spins away to give Gayle all the room he wants to shovel it over long-off
"leg-side line again, he needs to settle into something here, Gayle waits and tucks it behind square for one"
"this is some tripe! No control from Harbhajan, he's spraying it all around. This one's a full toss around off and Rahul punches it through the covers with ease"
steps out to one that drifts into him and goes slightly inside-out to extra cover
now he finds the gap past that fielder. This is terrific batting. Steps down the track and gets right to the pitch before lacing a drive through the left of the extra cover fielder. Top shot
"<b>edged and through the gap between keeper and wide slip</b>. That's an unusually wide slip, probably even wider of where second slip would have been. That means Gayle can take liberties at throwing his hands at deliveries that are well outside his reach"
"full and wide, big swing and a miss as he is stapled to the crease"
sprays one into the pads of Gayle who flicks to midwicket
"CSK are putting on an exhibition of everything you shouldn't bowl in a T20 game. After a full one on the pads, he drops short to Rahul, at a gentle pace, as he shifts back and swivels into a powerful pull through midwicket"
"short of a length, punched through the covers"
"that's some more tripe. Another shortish delivery, they aren't learning anything from their mistakes, Gayle doesn't entirely time it but the big swing is enough to carry it just past the mid-on fielder running back and sliding in front of the boundary"
"full on middle and leg, flicked to midwicket"
"a length ball that nicely sits up for him outside off, around the fifth or sixth-stump line, and Gayle mows it over long-on with a clean swing of the arms"
"slower short ball, Gayle swivels and helps it along to square leg. He jogs the first as two fielders converge, and that's fine because neither man can get to it"
"another shortish one, and ample of room. Jeez, when will they start bowling closer at the stumps. Gayle barely has to get the front foot away to slap it through long-off"
"some more short stuff, this one's too high for the batsman to be able to punish it, and that means he gets to face another delivery"
"length ball, as harmless as they come, well outside off, carted over long-off"
"there, much better! More of that. A yorker to end the over, and Gayle digs it out to cover"
"Tahir continues the trend of horrible deliveries, a full toss on leg stump, and Rahul flicks it to deep midwicket"
"short, wide, rocks back and cuts through point. Pulled back in front of the boundary"
"pitched up on middle and leg, driven down to long-on"
"brute force! <b>And a fifty for Gayle, off 22 balls</b>. That's as emphatic a franchise debut as there can be. A flighted fuller one on the stumps, and Gayle hammers it straight over"
"stays in the crease and opens the face, gets beaten"
"straight down the ground again. Tahir slides this into Gayle's leg stump, and he gets the front leg out and pummels it for six more"
"length, spinning into middle, punched down to long-on"
"non-turning length ball, pretty wide outside off, Gayle punches it through point"
"flattens the trajectory and fires a length ball around off, pushed back"
"slides it into the pads, and Rahul uses the angle and spin to tuck behind square"
"full on the stumps, quietly pushed down to long-on"
"after all the bad balls they have punished, Kings XI end up losing a wicket to a full toss. Wicket or boundary, it's almost as if CSK can't manage a delivery that doesn't make you flinch. Rahul punches it uppishly as he throws his weight behind the shot and finds DJ Bravo who leaps at cover to hold on to a sharp catch"
"length, angled across, Gayle opens the face to point"
"length ball, gets away from him late as he chips it in the air. Lands safely around the sweeper cover region"
"short, too close to Agarwal as he miscues a pull off the lower part of the bat"
off the middle this time as he pulls it out to deep midwicket. <b>100 up in the ninth over</b>. Shades of the Mumbai-DD game yesterday
quietly pushes out a fullish one to cover
"back of a length on off, opens the face for a single behind point"
"floated up on middle and leg, chipped down to long-on"
"leg-stump length ball, tucked to square leg"
Agarwal invites himself to the party with a straight six. Just how many have travelled that way tonight? A skip down the track and a neatly-timed punch over long-on
brilliant from Agarwal. Uses the width to open the face really late and squeezes it out through backward point
"leg-side fuller one, swept on the bounce to deep backward square leg"
"length ball that spins away, Gayle watchfully blocks in the direction of point"
"full, wide, reaches out and stabs it to sweeper cover"
"low full toss, slanted across, pushed down to long-off"
misfield at mid-off as Agarwal watchfully blocks towards the fielder and sends back Gayle looking for one. The fielder lets it slip through the legs and they take the one anyway
"full, outside off, carved out to backward point"
""
walks forward to a slower length ball and taps it through midwicket
"Watson offers up a dolly, a really full one at 129.2 clicks on middle and off, Agarwal clears the front leg and sends it soaring straight over"
"shortish, some width, slapped to the sweeper at the cover boundary"
"a rather underwhelming end to a superb innings. He was kept quiet for the last couple of overs or so, and now he's offered a simple catch to short fine leg. Watson tucks him up for room and bangs it in, Gayle gets an edge as he tries to pull it away"
"short of a length, angled across, jumps up and flicks to midwicket"

"floats up a length ball around off, solidly blocked off the front foot"
"fullish on middle, driven straight back"
"that's an easy one, just the kind of delivery you want as a batsman when you're out of form. A clean swing of the arms to dispatch a full, flighted one over long-on"

slants across a length ball outside off and Yuvraj punches down the pitch
"full toss that slips out of the hand, whipped away between deep midwicket and long-on"

"full, wide, flayed over point by Agarwal as Vijay runs to his left from sweeper cover to field it"
"slower full toss, teasing the line with the height here, Yuvraj flicks it to deep midwicket"
"short, sitting up outside off, and Yuvraj gets on his toes inside the crease and pulls to the right of deep midwicket"
"yorker from Bravo, and it goes away for four. Didn't really deserve a boundary. Bravo belts out an appeal for the lbw, but it's withheld. The ball, in the meanwhile, trickles away past a diving Harbhajan at short third man"
"Agarwal miscues one to long-on. Tahir floats up a length ball and Agarwal's bat turned in his hands as he tried to loft it. Doesn't get the distance desired as a result, and Jadeja completes a simple catch"
"Tahir strikes again, and it's another golden duck for Finch! Or is it? Finch reviews. But this was a poor shot from Finch. Pays the price for playing against the turn. A length ball and Finch clumsily steps forward and looks to close the face. The ball spins past it to hit the pad. A waste of a review, really, as the screen shows three reds"
"googly, spins in from a back of a length, and Nair punches to cover"

"short of a length, jumps and opens the face to third man"
"short, wide, slapped past point diving to his left"
"is that an edge? Oh, yeah! Tucked up for room and some extra bounce too that does him in. Yuvraj is trying to slap this over but gets a feather to the keeper. Gone for 20 but he Kings XI will be pleased he didn't scratch around"

"slower length ball, drops to point with an open face"
"<b>has that been dropped?</b>. Jadeja has hurt his hand quite badly, seems like. And it's his bowling hand. Karun whacked this full toss over deep midwicket and Jadeja leaps and the ball flicks his thumb before continuing on its path over the boundary"

"short of a length, sitting up nicely, pulled one-bounce to deep midwicket"
"length ball on the pads, Ashwin carts it off the pads over deep fine leg as the ball sails over Vijay leaping up. Could he have caught it if he was further back at the boundary?"
no room on the pull as Ashwin shifts right back and gets a top-edge that Dhoni runs to his left to catch
"length ball outside off, flayed through the gap at extra cover. Long-off runs to his left and slides across. Gets a hand and seems to have done alright as they go upstairs to check"
"full ball from around the wicket, knocked to deep midwicket"
advances looking for a slog and ends up swinging early due to the lack of pace
"wide yorker, pushed across from around the stumps, squeezed out to cover"
goes for a big heave over the leg side and he's picked out Jadeja at deep midwicket who takes it reverse-cupped. Slower ball from Bravo does the trick as he messes up the timing by rolling his fingers over this delivery
shifts down the leg side and it's another slower one as Tye swings without a clue about what he's doing. Beaten
"low full toss, punched to the left of deep midwicket, and they push back for the second"
"a sloppy start. Full and swinging down leg, a wide. Rahul dives to his left, but can only half-stop it. So three free runs for CSK."
"back of a length outside off, chopped to backward point. A good call from Vijay"
"starts the inswinger too straight again. Strays down leg, wide!"
"a good length delivery outside off, some inward shape. Carved away to extra cover."
"a full delivery, on middle and leg, off the pad to square leg. An optimistic appeal."

"fullish on off, punched to cover"

opens the face very late to punch a length ball to backward point
"back of a length on off, punched with an open face to Agarwal at backward point"
there's the early wicket that Kings XI were looking for as Watson's caught at short fine leg. A back-of-the-hand slower ball from Mohit and Watson tries to whip it through the leg side. Gets the timing all wrong and skews it in the air off the leading edge
tries to flick a leg-side fuller one and wears it on the pad
"slower length ball at leg-stump, <b>100.6ks</b> - could it get any slower? - as Vijay knocks it to point"

"full, angled in, flicked to midwicket"

"length ball on off, punched to mid-off for a quick one"

"slower back of a length delivery, opens the face to point"
flicked to square leg

"fullish length outside off, driven into cover"
"shortish, gets a little big on him as he shifts back to pull and gets hit high on the front pad. Easily missing leg"
turned away with the spin to backward square leg
"back of a length, minimal turn, punched to long-off"
comes down the track and works this length ball with the turn to midwicket
there's the legbreak. Sussed out by Billings who cuts to cover
"will Ashwin review that? Appeals for the leg before but the signal is four off the bat. Yes, he goes for it. Another legbreak from Ashwin. Floats it up just enough to entice Billings to get down and sweep. There is absolutely no bat involved, which seemed pretty obvious to start off. UltraEdge confirms it, and three reds on Hawkeye as ball crashes into off-stump. Good review. Ashwin was super-confident of that and you could see why. That seemed pretty plumb from the outset"
"another legbreak, make that three in a row, Dhoni reaches out and drives to long-off"
"back of a length, Rayudu gets behind the line and flicks to midwicket"
"floated up outside off, driven to sweeper cover"
"boy did he slam that! A savage Dhoni strike, all timing, but the placement's not so great as long-on gets around it comfortably despite how quickly that left the bat"

drifts it in down the leg side again

"oh, that's a stunning shot! Came out of nowhere. You didn't actually realise it was a four until you saw how well he had placed that. A length ball that turns away and he simply waits and waits before punching it through backward point"

shifts back and hurriedly punches it into the off side as it bounces extra

Rayudu skips down the track but Sran shortens the length and Rayudu slightly chips it in the air. Well short of the bowler
a timely six from Rayudu breaks the shackles. Shuffles across to a shortish delivery and heaves a pull over backward square leg
"back-of-the-hand slower delivery, Rayudu backs away and leaves it hoping for a wide. But well inside"
<b>Ashwin with a direct hit</b>. And look at him take off. And look at the Kings XI dugout. A lightning quick piece of fielding from Ashwin. Rayudu drills it to extra cover and Ashwin just swoops down in a flash and nails a direct hit at the striker's end after Dhoni sends Rayudu back
"short of a length, opens the face to point"
another yes and no. Dhoni sends Jadeja back but he manages to get back in comfortably after tapping a slower one to midwicket
a length ball that slides in and hits Dhoni in front of leg as he misses the flick
"shortish, some width, Dhoni chops a cut to cover"
there's the biggie. Much-needed six from Dhoni. He's struggling with a sore back and it's slowed him down. But the power's still there as he slogs this over deep square leg
"short and some width, Dhoni slaps it through the covers off the backfoot"
"flat back of a length delivery, almost a seam-up as he fires it in at pace, turned away to backward square leg"

"slower ball, dips late and sneaks down the leg side"
"short, cuts into Jadeja and gives him no pace, pulled away backward of square leg and this time they charge back for the second. Rahul takes the bails off after gathering the throw but Jadeja's well inside"
was that a wide? Touch and go. Very full and out of Jadeja's reach. Seemed like it was probably just within the line but the umpire thinks otherwise
"short ball, Jadeja doesn't get hold of it again as he mistimes a pull to backward square leg"
this is brilliant death bowling. A wide yorker and all Jadeja can do is dig it out to point
"full toss, booming drive through the covers by Jadeja. Sweeper moves across to his left and they take him on for the second. Sran slips on the follow through and get behind the stumps to gather the throw as Dhoni comes rushing back"
"full and wide, Dhoni brings the bat down to drive and makes no contact. Not much feet"
lots of bottom hand power as he flays a full one outside off past Jadeja who is forced to arch his back. <b>Dhoni limps the single</b>
"shortish, and Jadeja gently pulls it through square leg"
"full, drifts away too far outside off. Not bothered with by Dhoni"
shoveled! Tremendous back-hand power as Dhoni slams this slower back of a length delivery through long-off. Wouldn't have mattered if you had all your fielders there
"full outside off, driven to long-off"
Jadeja still can't get hold of his shots but he'll get four for this. A slow short of a length delivery that he backs away to and manages to chip over the in-field at the cover and point region
<b>in the air and missed chance</b>. Mayank Dagar dives forward but the ball dips horribly on him and ends up sneaking from underneath to the boundary. A full toss that Dhoni shovelled to the deep midwicket region
steps down the track to meet a low full toss and hammers it to long-off. Just one. Back giving lots of trouble
Jadeja drills a fuller one very hard back at the bowler and Mohit bumps into Dhoni as he moves to his right to try and stop it
"humongous hit from Dhoni! A juicy half-volley, right in the slot for Dhoni to get underneath it and bludgeon it miles in the air and over cow corner"
"short, wide, makes Dhoni reach out and he can't because of the injury, chops it into the surface. And that's <b>fifty for Dhoni</b>"
six! Another huge hit. Jadeja gets into the act. And it was about time he did so! A length ball that Jadeja gets on top of from the crease and hammers over long-on
"full around off, drilled very hard down to long-on"
"and there ends Jadeja's underwhelming stay. Full and angled across, and that drift does him in as he skews it in the air off the outside of the bat with Ashwin is waiting under it at extra cover"
that's a bad ball. You don't bowl a wide length ball like that to a batsman on fifty-odd in the penultimate over. A free swing of the arms as he smokes it way over long-on
"overcompensates with a short ball and with the line too which is well outside off, and Dhoni ramps it over short third man! Oh the drama!"
"in the air, and a moment of excitement as the ball lobs in the air. Not very well-timed and it lands short of long-off"
six more! MS Dhoni is doing the unthinkable here! And he's down on one knee after that shot. A full toss that angles into him and that angle makes up for the lack of power because of the injury. Swung away over square leg
"good yorker, angled into Bravo's pads as he clips to deep midwicket"
"great delivery. A wide yorker, making Dhoni reach. With that sore back, it's asking him to do the impossible. Beaten"
"tries an encore and it's drifted away too much. Tension building. Mohit needs to hold his own here. Dhoni has loads of experience in these situations. Injured back or not, you don't want to be bowling to him in these situations"
"beautiful shot! They needed four fours in four balls, and that's the first of 'em. Superb placement as he squeezes out a wide fuller one between point and backward point"
"excellent! Wide yorker, bang on the line. An inch here or there and it was a wide. But it's right inside. Top stuff from Mohit. Dhoni brings the bat down and just hits the ground"
"is that four, is that four? No. Deep point cuts it off. Dhoni steps down the track and squeezes this out through the covers. Deep point gets around to his right. <b>Dhoni does not take the single</b>"
"oh, he's finished it off with a six! A six! If only this had come a ball earlier. Things could have been so different. Ah, the hurt of it all if you're Dhoni. An extremely full delivery on middle, Dhoni sends it soaring into the sky and straight over for a monstrous six"
