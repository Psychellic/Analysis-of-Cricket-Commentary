"what a start! Did Rana get some hand on it? A back of a length delivery on middle and leg, it bounced and took off. Took the shoulder of the bat, towards Rana's right at wide slip. Somehow, the ball bursts out. <b>That will go down as a drop.</b>"
"a full, wide delivery outside off, Buttler looks to drive through the line but jabs it back"
"back of a length outside off, Buttler stays back and carves the ball to point. No feet movement, not much at least."
"good single. Back of a length around off, the ball seams back in. An inside edge into the pad, trickles back towards the keeper. Tripathi calls Buttler through."
"hitting the hard length. Back of a length down leg, hustles Tripathi for pace. Hits him on the body as he misses a flick."
"back of a length, the ball pitches and seams back in after pitching. Tripathi wants to play the ball into the off side but didn't account for that movement. The ball snakes in to hit Tripathi on the body, near the neck."
"full, on middle. Defended towards mid-on. Nice start."
"good length outside off, 138 kph. He's generating decent speed. Pushed away towards cover for a quick, and well-judged single."
"that's what T20s are all about. Anticipation. The first ball of the over was tidy and straight. So Tripathi backs away and hopes it's there again. It is. He slices a carve off a full, straight delivery over point. Fantastic batting"
"and now he gets a poor delivery. Short and wide, plenty of width. Carved away past backward point. Earned that error with a calculated risk off the previous ball"
"how has that gone for four? 143 kph, full on off, a bit of seam too. Tripathi now wants to work that ball through midwicket, but that away movement takes the outside edge and flies through gully!"
"that's splendid. Full and straight again, don't think that's the length you want to bowl here. Tripathi says thanks with a delightful, delectable on-drive through mid-on."
"short and wide, 139 kph. Buttler backed away too far and so had to stretch out too far to get bat on it. He gets that: a top edge and it flies over short third man."
"that's a shot he's really good at. For Lancashire, for Somerset, for England, for Royals. Walks right across and just scoops a fast bowler over fine leg for six. How easy does batting look?"
"a poor ball. Royals are flying. Short and wide outside off, Buttler slices an upper cut over point. Bad bowling."
"yikes, that's an ugly flat-batted mow through midwicket. A slow, shortish delivery outside off is slapped wide of midwicket."
"<strong>nine in nine</strong>! 45 runs in 2.5 overs. Buttler backs away, then shuffles right back in line and scoops a straight delivery over fine leg for six. Too easy for Jos."
"10 boundaries in 10 balls! Wow, what a start for Royals. Probably his best delivery, close to a wide yorker but why would you want to bowl that with third man up? Buttler sees the ball early and scythes the ball through backward point."
"<strong>DOT BALL!</strong> Full and wide, an offbreak, pushed to cover from the crease"
"11 in 12! A full delivery outside off, an offbreak. Tripathi stays low and swats the delivery over midwicket for four. Almost went for six."
"a full delivery on middle, punched to cover from the crease."
"flat and wide outside off, tapped to third man for a run."
"drifts well down leg for a wide. Good take from Karthik, to his left."
"that's the better line. Some sarcastic cheers ring around the Eden Gardens. Flat and straight, blocked"
"too full this time outside off. Buttler stays low and bottom-hands that drive away through wide mid-off. How he gets so much power on that is down to that bottom hand. In the slog overs, he would just loft that shot for six. He doesn't need to against Narine."
"slingy action. Full and wide outside off, Tripathi wants to play then bails out."
"a slower ball, on the pads. worked away with soft hands into the gap in front of square leg for two."
"a low full toss, down the leg side. Tripathi misses a flick somehow, off the pad to third man"
"back of a length on off, tapped away towards backward point for a quick single. Hit his glove almost. Seems that's the length to bowl here, hit the deck!"
"gloved and gone! Eden Gardens goes wild. A short delivery down leg, Russell was quick and hustling. Tripathi is hurried on the pull and eventually, he can only get a glove on his pull, through to DK. That's a massive wicket, primarily because it's some relief."
"back of a length outside off. Russell sticking with that length. Guides to gully, on the bounce."
"shortish and wide outside off, some spin back in. Pushed away towards cover for a quick single"
"slow around off, worked to midwicket. Two dots for Rahane."
"make that three. It's the carrom ball, short outside off, bunted away to mid-off"
"looks to slog sweep, but makes no contact. Slow and wide outside off, the ball turns back in. Rahane misses, so does Karthik"
"more dots! A carrom ball outside off, worked to midwicket. Karthik sends him back for the last ball."
"breaks that pressure with a neat flick through backward square leg. Was an exceptional over till that point, but the line was errant and Rahane's off"
"full outside off, punched away to the sweeper cover."
"back of a length on off, nudged away towards midwicket, Rahane calls for two and makes it. Well placed, well run"
"backs away, exposes his stumps and drills a drive to cover. A very good stop from Uthappa."
"a slower ball around off, worked wide of midwicket for a couple. Long-on had a lot of ground to cover"
"back of a length around off, some extra bounce. Punched to long-on."
"a full toss to finish. A quick one. Pushed back to the bowler, taken aback by the lack of accuracy"
"doesn't bother with the straight bat. A stock delivery on off, Rahane stays low and sweeps to deep square leg for a couple."
"80 kph, that's a weird shot. Is that a shot he plays well? I don't think so, which makes that reverse sweep a weird attempt. Looks to reverse sweep that ball - a lofted googly - through point. It's on leg stump too, indicating that was a premeditated shot. He misses, but the ball hits leg and middle stump. Kuldeep has confidence now, that's dangerous."
"the conventional paddle sweep, Sanju tries first up. It's the googly, hits Samson on the body"
"the stock delivery, around off. Worked away to square leg for one"
"on leg stump, worked to deep midwicket. Buttler may just look to bat for a bit now."
"that's too short, easy enough to read off the pitch. A stock delivery on middle and leg, worked to square leg"
"back of a length outside off, Samson opens the bat face and guides that down to third man for a run"
"back of a length outside off, 137 kph, some width. Krishna may want to avoid that line. Cut away towards backward point"
"a very full delivery on off, pushed to long-on"
"back of a length outside off, 138 kph. A thick outside edge flies down to the third man boundary. He did attempt to open the face, but was that intentional? Don't think so."
"back of a length on middle and off, that's a better line. And therefore, earns a dot ball too. Pushed to cover."
"a straight, very full delivery is jammed back to the bowler."
nice drift away from the right-hander and that is what makes Buttler a tad bit tentative. Reaches out to it and blocks as carefully as he could
"reverse sweeps.... straight to short third man! He was 11 runs away from becoming the first batsman in the IPL to score six fifties in a row. But with the run-rate slipping, with wickets falling, he knows it is up to him to shake Royals out of their funk. Goes for the unorthodox shot - a shot he's very confident playing - but the ball out the front of the hand bounces a little more than he expects"
nice and full to the new batsman and Stokes jams it down the ground
full toss outside off which Samson slaps down to long-off
"full and on and around off stump, Stokes hits to long-on"
"steps leg side, then back in normal position at the crease and sweeps a length ball in line with the stumps to the square leg boundary"
"on the pads, spinning away from the left-hander. Stokes works it through midwicket"
"length ball on leg stump, Stokes flicks it away to deep midwicket"
"<b>appeal for lbw</b> as Samson sets up a pull shot. He is hitting with the turn, but the ball skids through and strikes him on the pads. <b>DK wants to review</b>. The impact is on the back leg, which is right in line with off stump, and HawkEye says it's hitting the stumps as well. Umpire Anil Chaudhary will have to change his on-field not-out decision"
"good length and outside off, Binny lets it go"
"lunges forward to block a tossed up offbreak and is surprised by the dip on it. Binny thinks he can get to the pitch, but suddenly has to use his wrists to keep the ball down"
stays back now and works the length ball from off stump through midwicket
"<b>sensational googly</B>! Binny does not pick it. He's lunging out of his crease, searching for ball so he could flick it through midwicket. But it just does not behaves the way he thinks it would. Drifts past the edge. Pitches and spins further. DK is ready and waiting behind the stumps and well..."
"full and on off stump, works it down to long-on"
looks to nudge it through wide mid-on as Kuldeep goes around the wicket. Gets a leading edge down to long-off
"<b>another googly</B>! Gowtham presses forward to defend, thinking it will spin into him, but the ball darts past the outside edge and into the keeper's gloves"
goes back to flick a good length ball behind square leg
goes back to flick a flatter delivery outside off through midwicket
"back of a length and outside off, Stokes chops it to point"
"slower ball, and Stokes, who is stuck in the crease, mistimes it to mid-off"
strays on the pads and Stokes whips it away to deep square leg
opens the face and glides the short of a length ball outside off to deep third man
"short on middle, Stokes dabs it through point"
<b>bounces him out</b>! Hostile stuff! Gowtham has shown he is outrageously good at dispatching anything in his half out of the park. So makes perfect sense to test him with the short ball. And Mavi's really quick too. Gets it to come up towards his throat. Gowtham shuffles inside the line and tries to fend it away to fine leg. Only gloves it through to the keeper
"loops it up on leg stump, from around the wicket, Stokes makes room and drives to long-on"
sweeps a length ball on off stump out to long leg.
"defends on middle stump, but since he isn't to the pitch of the ball, which is also a googly, he ends up playing outside the line and gets an inside edege through square leg"
works it away to deep square leg
"pops it back to the bowler! <b>Fourth wicket for Kuldeep</B>! This angle from around the wicket to Stokes has really been messing with him. The left-hander keeps playing the original line, with each ball pitching on leg stump, but since he isn't reading the ball out the hand, and with his team in tatters, he cannot attack. He can only nudge. Goes for a little flick, but there is just enough gap between the ball and bat for it to turn, claim a bit of the leading edge and return to where it came from."
"tosses it up on off stump, Sodhi comes forward to block. That's the end of a supremely good spell of spin bowling."
"back of a length on middle, he clips to short midwicket"
"spears it through the covers, Unadkat showing how its done. Stands still on leg stump, opens the face to place it to the right of the fielder"
"steps away on the leg side and pulls a bouncer that is following him, coming up towards his head, away to the deep square leg boundary. DK rushes up to his young bowler to have an urgent chat"
"full on middle and off stump, Unadkat smokes it to cover"
"slower ball on off stump, Unadkat picks it and blocks down the pitch"
gets right behind a back of a length delivery on middle and finds a single at mid-off
spins away from the right-hander and he slices it to the left of backward point
"width on offer and Unadkat lashes it to the point boundary. Lovely placement, picks the gap to the right of the man inside the circle and to the left of the sweeper"
backs away as he cuts the shortish delivery turning into the stumps. Single to the sweeper
waits until the very last second so he can read the turn off the pitch and then dabs the shortish delivery outside off to short third man
tucks this off middle to deep square leg
over the fielder at point! Unadkat is 22 from 12! And he's played some sparkling shots. Like rasping cut to a short and wide delivery.
looks for the pull as he sees a short ball with some room outside off. No connection
swings looking for the midwicket boundary but is utterly deceived by a slower ball. Goes through between the leg stump and the batsman's back thigh
"<b>appeal for the weirdest caught behind ever</b> with KKR thinking the ball has come off the bottom edge, onto boot and then to the keeper. Soft signal is not out. The fun starts with a yorker, that Sodhi inside edges onto his back boot, bounces off his back pad and settles in DK's hands. Third umpire rules it out, rightly. Boy, if ever there was a sign that this game is KKR's..."
short-arm pulls it away to the square leg boundary. For half a second he seems cramped for room as the short ball comes up to his hips. But the bottom hand makes up for all that
"full on off stump, defends"
whips it straight down the ground for a couple
steers a back of a length delivery on and around off stump to deep point
"legcutter, which Archer picks, but the lack of room means he can only find cover"
"goes for the slog, but he is deceived by the change of pace, and so goes up instead of long. Gill is coming in from long leg and takes it ever so cleanly"
"<b>dropped</b> by Krishna running in from cover. This is the quicker ball, and it that should have got a wicket. Unadkat is beaten for pace. He's swinging hard because it's short and outside off. But it goes straight up. There's an age for Krishna to get under it, but it pops out"
pushes it down the ground
"full toss on middle, Anureet slices it to sweeper cover"
"slower ball off the back of the hand, dipping on the right-hander. Anureet defends in front of middle and gets a single"
"full toss on off stump, he carves it to sweeper cover"
strikes him on the pad as Unadkat is late on the flick shot.
"full toss on off stump, Unadkat whacks it to long-on"
"low full toss on off stump, carves it to the sweeper cover"
"that's it. A slower ball crashes into middle stump as Unadkat looks for a slog sweep. Misses it completely, but the umps are going to check on the no-ball. He's fine. Innings over."
"first ball six! Block the first ball? Watch the spin? Play with a straight bat? No, says Narine. It's full, straight and T20d away over midwicket for six. Too full and heaved away"
"flat and straight, around leg. Pulled over square leg for four. Lands just inside the boundary."
"toe-ended away over long-on. Narine is looking at the bottom of the bat. He runs down, gets close enough to the pitch and lofted pretty cleanly over long-on for six! Job done? 16 off 3."
"flat on middle and leg, Narine backs away and slaps the ball over cover. Flat-batted glory for Narine. Bludgeoning both lengths."
"too close to that! BOOO! Full and straight, Narine comes down and hits to long-on. All along the ground."
"flat and quick outside off, Lynn blocks."
that's how Narine plays the short deliveries. Gets outside the line and tries to hit short deliveries over point. Misses.
"Gowtham takes the catch and sends Narine off. 21 off 7, that's three runs a ball. Job done from Narine. But that's the length to bowl to Narine. Another short delivery outside off, Narine backs away and mis-times a pull. He was clearly rushed for pace there, and all he could do was splice the pull to cover."
a full delivery outside off is driven to extra cover.
"lovely shot, lovely stop. Shortish and wide outside off, carved away towards backward point."
"a full delivery on middle and leg, chipped away to mid-on. Not found his fluency at all."
"a slower ball down leg, nudged down to short fine leg. 0 off 5. Wicket maiden from Stokes."
"full and straight, on-driven away to mid-on. Not the greatest timing"
"<strong>just short of Buttler!</strong> Back of a length outside off, Uthappa looks to guide this down to third man, an under edge is collected on the bounce."
"shortish and wide outside off, slashed down to third man for a run"
"the look-away pull six from Lynn. Archer attacks the badge, it's a very good bouncer. But that's the risk on grounds like these. Lynn is hurried, he takes his eyes off the ball and then top-edges the pull over backward square leg."
"147 kph. 'That's not the plan with third man up,' says Warne with the host broadcaster. That indeed is a terrible plan. A short delivery outside off, Lynn just stays underneath the length and lofts the ball over short third man. Lands just inside"
"147 kph, short around off, patted back"
"good single. Full and straight, pushed away to mid-on for a single."
"keeps low? Back of a length down leg, Lynn looks to pull, but the ball keeps a tad low. He is hit on the thigh or midriff"
"doesn't carry to mid-on! Another good delivery, back of a length on the body. He is so rushed on that that he splices the ball towards midwicket. Mid-on can't get around in time to catch"
nice timing. On the pads and flicked away nonchalantly into the gap at midwicket for two.
"taken at deep square leg! 144 kph, it's another short delivery. Another well-directed bouncer. Uthappa struggles to time the ball or keep it down. He does neither and picks out the fielder. Stokes is using that length exceptionally well. Harried for pace."
"too full and Lynn says why bother bowling there? An overpitched, hit-me, half-volley outside off. Lynn gently drills the drive through cover for four."
"Rana too has struggled against the bouncer already this IPL. A bouncer outside off, Rana avoids that watchfully."
<strong>the beautiful Test 1-2</strong>! A nice full delivery that pitches and moves away. Rana's feet are rooted and his drive is beaten
"and again! 146 kph, back of a length outside off, the ball pitches and moves away again. Beaten quite convincingly"
"good stop by Tripathi. Full and wide outside off, caressed away towards cover. Tripathi dives to his left"
"149.6 kph. Back of a length on middle, Rana backs away, clears his front leg and carves a cut wide of backward point, to his left. That's his strength and he played to that."
does it again! Backs away and chops a cut into the ground towards point for a couple.
"a good slower ball, 109 kph, some loop and dip on that. Ends up floating like a butterfly, and jamming down on Lynn as he blocks."
"back of a length outside off, punched away towards cover. The fielder dives to his left but falls over the ball."
"full on middle and off, 140 kph, nudged away towards midwicket."
"another slower ball, shortish and wide, cut to the sweeper cover fielder."
"a slower ball that drifts down leg, wide."
"back of a length around off, 135 kph, defended into the off side. Rana happy to play this out."
"on middle and leg, worked into the gap at wide mid-on for a single."
"the googly, read by Rana. He goes back and carves a cut to point"
"80.5 kph. Very hard hands from Lynn, which is why that ball almost popped back. A legbreak on middle, Lynn blocks and almost carries back to Ish."
"shortish delivery outside off, short enough for Lynn to go back and read the ball off the pitch. Worked to wide long-on"
"that's four. Always four when it beats the fielder. It's short and wide, reads it very carefully and correctly. Goes back and slashes his cut through point."
"the googly around off, 82 kph. Rana looks for the big slog sweep but all he can do is chop it back into his body"
"on middle and leg, defended back."
yanks a full delivery from outside off through midwicket
"shimmies down, reaching the pitch of the ball on off stump, and since he's right on top of it, he can work it against the turn through midwicket"
stands back to punch a flatter delivery on off stump to long-on
"lifts it over extra cover! It's the footwork again, bravely jumping down the pitch and this time hitting with the turn, perhaps because he isn't right to the pitch of this ball on off stump"
"fires it in from around the wicket, Rana reads the trick early and chops it behind point"
"full on off stump, flicks to long-on"
flicks a quicker delivery on top of off stump through midwicket
"<b>huge appeal for lbw</b>. Umpire Dharmasena says no but Royals want a second look. Regardless of what happens, this is a lovely delivery. Sodhi slows it up, and as a result, gets it to drift away. That drift has Rana nervous. He has no stride, he is playing outside the line as if he thinks this is a googly, but the ball turns sharply to pin him on the front pad and HawkEye shows it is hitting leg stump. Decision overturned. Royals rising."
rocks back to cut a shortish delivery to the sweeper cover
"full on off stump, he pushes it off the front foot through to the sweeper cover"
"lovely drift into the right-hander, but Karthik stretches forward to cover it and blocks with soft hands"
"goes for a sweep, dragging a well flighted delivery from outside off over to deep midwicket. And he even pinches an extra run"
"full and outside off, knocks it down the pitch towards where mid-off would have been"
"back of a length on leg stump, Karthik deflects it to fine leg"
"slower bouncer, moving across the right-hander, Lynn ignores it"
"offcutter again, which Lynn glides to the sweeper cover"
gets his hands up high to deal with the bounce on this back of a length delivery and somehow drives it through the covers. Superb timing
looks to smack the wide length ball on the up through the covers. But there is no contact
"<b>beats him</b> with a gorgeous legbreak, pretending to come into the right-hander a little way and then it pitches and changes direction. Gloriously fickle."
shifts over to off stump to deal with Sodhi's big-turning legbreaks and whips this through midwicket
"<b>almost to the slip fielder</b>! DK sets up for a pull because this is slow and short, but then the ball breaks sharply, and as a result, he has to dab it down into the off side. Does so well enough to beat Stokes"
"tosses it up on middle and off, DK stretches forward to block"
"full and outside off, drives to deep point"
"bounces short of long-on, where K Gowtham races in seeing Lynn loft a short and wide ball in his direction."
blocks a back of a length delivery from round the wicket to cover
"pushes, with an open face, and this good length ball on off stump goes to point"
"picks the slower ball, sees fine leg up in the circle, and exploits it all beautifully with a pull shot. Lovely roll of the wrists, perfect placement, because deep square leg is also lurking."
glides a full delivery on off stump to deep third man
"makes sure to play close to the body, which is important against someone with good slower balls, and finds a single at midwicket"
blocks a shortish delivery on middle to point
rolls his wrists to adjust to the slower ball on off stump and sends it skipping away through midwicket
reaches out to the short ball outside off and pummels it to deep square leg.
"full on off stump, DK squeezes it out to the sweeper cover"
nudges a shortish delivery outside off to long-on
"full on off stump, bunts it down to long-on"
"full, wide, smash and the ball disappears to the cover boundary. Karthik's skills in finishing a chase are fairly incredible"
carves it to the point boundary! A little room to work with. A lot more pace to take advantage of. And the old Chris Lynn. The man nearly everyone comes to watch at the Gabba in the BBL pops out to prove it really is him
"another cut shot, but this time he finds point"
"takes the pace off, but Lynn picks it and pulls to long-on"
leaps off his feet to control a short ball outside off and run it down to point
"good length outside off, slides it down to deep third man"
"<b>top edge</b> flies away past Buttler on the right. Lynn sees another short ball that he likes, this time he goes for a pull, and still gets the runs he wants. Perhaps more considering that part of the ground is well protected"
"goes inside out, but he is too close to the ball on leg stump to drive it properly through the covers"
"pulls out the reverse sweep, and he finds the boundary with third man up in the circle. The line of this ball merits the shot - outside off. No threat to the stumps"
"tosses it up on middle, Karthik blocks into the covers and sprints through"
"sees the ball lob up over his eyeline, loves the width on this, looks to smash through the covers. But the dip and turn do him in."
"an awkward looking sweep shot, right off middle stump. Top-edge for a couple."
"beats him with a good length ball that drifts in on middle, grips the pitch and then zips away past the outside edge like they're mortal enemies"
turns a good length ball to long-on
"taken at deep point! It's short. It's wide. It needs to be whacked, which Lynn tries to do. But the connection is weak. It comes off the outside half of the bottom of the bat and goes only as far as Anureet."
"half an appeal for lbw, with DK shuffling across his crease. They pinch a legbye and soon after that's done, <b>Royals review</b>. It's a good length ball angling into the right-hander, beating the inside edge, and would go down with the angle past the stumps. HawkEye says it might clip, and that means umpire's call"
"full on middle, Russell knocks it away to deep midwicket"
"full on off stump, knocks it down towards mid-on"
defends a good length ball on middle. That's Stokes' spell - and his season - done.
"wallops it to the point boundary, backing away against a short ball intending to cramp him. Sensational hitting, bounces only inches short of the rope"
clears the front leg to smash a back of a length ball over long-on. But it's off-pace and it induces an inside edge ontp pad
"that's ridiculously good! Unadkat is bowling around the wicket, often taking all the pace off it. This one comes down at top pace, Karthik spots it and gently deflects it away to the third man boundary. Imagine your friend putting an arm around you, only to slap a sign that says 'kick me!'"
"looks for third man again, angling the face of the bat against a shortish delivery coming into him. No connection"
"tries to glide it fine to third man again, beaten for the second time"
finds a single behind point
swivels on the back foot and pulls it down to long leg
"clears the front leg and smears a half-volley outside off to the cover boundary. 145 kph coming down, several more going away"
"low full toss, which Russell swings away to long-on"
"full on middle, whips it to midwicket"
"outside edge flies away to the third man boundary. Gowtham does his best to stop it with a full length dive, it'll be a top effort if he has saved it. But it's unlikely... Yep, replays confirm he makes contact with the boundary while flicking the ball back"
"hoists a short ball over long-on and take his team across the line. KKR move up to third place now in front of 61,000 of their supporters"
