"<strong>edge off the first ball!</strong> Length, around off, and Latham plays inside the line of this. Goes off the edge, and goes to the right of gully, who is a little wider than normal. Runs away to third man"
"length, jags away from outside off, and he leaves"
"<strong>out this time!</strong> Length, and around off, and Latham lets his bat hang out at this one. There's a spot of extra bounce, and it goes off the shoulder of the bat to third slip, where Azhar Ali hangs on. Afridi takes off in celebration and punches the air. Just the start Pakistan wanted after winning the toss"
"length, swings back in from outside off, and strikes Williamson on the pad as he presses forward. There's a loud appeal, but they decide not to review. Perhaps a hint of an inside edge"
"length, around off, and he defends with a dead bat"
"fuller, angles across him, and Rizwan collects around his chest. Williamson lets this pass"
"length, just outside off, and he leaves"
"closer to the stumps, a bit of nip back off the seam, and Blundell defends pressing forward"
"a bit of seam movement back in, shorter in length, and he defends this with soft hands"
"closer to the bat this time, good length, defended off the back foot"
"length, and he presses forward. Loud appeal for leg before, but he seems to have gotten outside the line of this, as also taken an inside edge. No chance of pinching a single, as it rolls towards cover-point"
"closer to him, outside off, and he leaves. It passes close to the pads"
"back of a length, a bit of swing, but it's down the leg side. Williamson has a flick at it, but it's too far from him to make contact"
"lovely length. Much fuller, a hint of shape in towards off stump. Blocked back to the bowler, getting right behind it before getting his weight forward"
"good leave. Length ball in the corridor, with a hint of shape back in. A leave on length as much as line"
"length ball, shifts his line wider, left alone"
"a little fuller and closer to off stump. Gets on the front foot, lets the ball come on, and defends with soft hands into the cover point region"
"full, slanting away from off stump. Gets forward and just leans into a push into the cover point region. Didn't go too hard at it, ensured that he kept his shape and moved his weight into the shot"
"length ball, tight line close to off stump, Blundell is on the front foot to block into the off side"
"length ball, not far outside off, and a bit of seam movement in. Blundell is on an off-stump guard, though, and batting out of his crease, so he can judge both the line and the bounce well to leave it"
"fuller, angling into off and middle, defended into the on side"
"well bowled, well played. Fullish, close to off stump. Gets forward, almost lets the ball hit his defensive bat and roll away into the gully region"
"ooh, that's well bowled. Slightly wider line, and Blundell plays forward to defend. He's seen a couple of balls nip in, and that makes him play, but this one swings away late to <strong>beat his edge</strong>"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"length ball slanting across to off stump and straightening in, fairly steep bounce but Williamson is right behind it and on top of it to tuck it to the right of short leg"
"ooh, <strong>nearly a bat-pad catch</strong>. Blundell was batting outside his crease to Abbas but he's back in it against Shaheen, and he immediately targets him with the full, inswinging lbw ball. Gets forward to flick, gets an inside edge into pad, and the ball pops in the air but to the left of short leg"
"full, slanting away from off stump, gets forward and blocks to extra-cover. No orthodox mid-off"
"goes even wider outside off, gets a big stride forward to block to that man at extra-cover"
"here's the bouncer, climbing not particularly steeply over leg stump, but Williamson gets into a low, feline crouch and evades it easily"
"length ball close to off stump, gets across and defends with soft hands. The ball rolls into the on side, to the right of short leg, and they think of taking a single but the fielder moves quickly to prevent it"
"length ball angling into middle stump, straightens a touch. Defended back down the pitch"
"Blundell's batting outside his crease to Abbas, and he presses forward to this length ball but doesn't get close enough to cover the inward seam. A bit of bounce too, and it's past his inside edge to hit thigh pad"
"length ball, on that tight off-and-middle line. Gets forward to block it back towards the bowler"
"now he shifts to a fifth-stump line, quite full. Left alone, and wisely so, because it's swinging away late"
"length ball, not too far outside off, but he can trust the bounce and leave it alone"
length ball angling in towards off stump. Gets on the front foot and defends it back to Abbas
"length ball slanting away from off stump. Thinks of playing, then decides to leave. Good choice, because it nips away off the seam rather than swinging back in"
"this one does swing in a touch, but the line is just outside off, and Williamson can trust the bounce and leave it on this pitch"
"length ball, this one starts a little wider and keeps going with the angle. Another good leave"
"length ball close to off stump, gets back and across and defends so close to his body that it just hits the bat face and rolls away gently behind the wicket. Typical Williamson moment"
"beauty. He's swung a few back, so it's hard to leave him. This one's on a length, and it pitches on off stump or thereabouts. Williamson looks to defend, and it seams away <strong>past the outside edge</strong>"
"a little straighter in line, gets behind it and blocks to short leg"
"fullish, angling down leg, can't connect with the flick"
"fullish outside off, left alone"
"length ball, a bit of outswing in the fourth-stump channel. Good leave"
"another good leave. This one doesn't swing, but the line is just outside off and the length is just about short enough to trust the bounce"
"a little fuller, a little wider. Gets a stride forward to defend into the point region"
"length ball on middle and off, and Blundell gets forward to work it to the left of fine leg. Abbas won't mind this - he was playing around his front pad a little"
"big appeal for a caught-behind down the leg side, but it isn't given. Pakistan think of reviewing, <strong>and they do so</strong>. Just back of a length, a bit of swing, and Williamson plays slightly in front of his body while trying to tuck it away fine. No bat, though, it's just brushed the thigh pad on the way through, and Pakistan have lost a review"
"ooh, back of a length again. This one starts on a better line, and continues with the angle across Williamson. He has an uncharacteristic poke at it, and the ball <strong>zips past his edge</strong>"
"full now, slanting across to off stump. Nice stride forward to block into the point region"
"fullish, close to off stump. Not quite driving length, and Williamson plays a checked push to the left of extra-cover"
"length ball, a hint of shape back in towards off stump. Gets forward and defends from a slightly closed-off position"
"that closed-off position nearly gets him in trouble now as Shaheen gets this one to swing in a little more from a similar line and length. Defends with bat and pad close together, and gets a tiny bit of inside edge into his pad"
"edged, but it <strong>doesn't carry</strong>. Length ball in the corridor, and williamson plays from the crease, slightly further away from his body than usual. Falls well short of second slip, though, because of those soft hands of his"
"this one comes in off the seam, but the initial line is too straight, and it slides down the leg side"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"length ball on off stump, stays on the back foot and defends into the off side"
"fullish, a bit of inward movement, and that's definitely a leave on length. Not far outside off stump at all"
"fullish, angling into middle stump. He's careful not to close his bat face early, and defends towards short leg"
"back of a length, straightens towards middle stump. Gets back and across to defend towards short leg"
"gone, Shaheen's removed both openers! Full, pitching on off stump and continuing with the angle away. Asks Blundell to drive, and he does so without really getting a stride in. Thick edge carries low to Yasir Shah, who takes a sharp catch at third slip"
"full on leg stump, and Taylor is off the mark with a boundary. Not a bad ball, necessarily, maybe just marginally off line, and Taylor flicks it away, making the square leg umpire jump away from the ball"
"fullish, close to off stump, not the biggest of strides forward to push into the covers. A bit of yes-no between the batsmen, but they decide not to run"
"full, a bit of inswing. Lots of bowlers try to get Taylor lbw early, because he does play around his front pad, but the line is a little too straight and he clips it off his feet towards fine leg"
"length ball, angling across to off stump with just a hint of movement back in. Gets swiftly across to clip it to the right of short leg"
"beauty. Length ball, slanting in towards off stump, forcing Williamson to play, and then swerving away late to beat his outside edge and <strong>square him up</strong>. You need to bowl a very good ball to do that to this man"
"squares up again, but he's well in control to defend with soft hands into the off side. Once again, a length ball tight on off stump with a hint of shape away"
"back of a length on off stump, defended towards midwicket"
"length ball straightening towards off stump, defended towards point"
"length ball in the corridor, a bit of shape away. Gets forward to defend, makes sure his hands don't go following the movement, so the ball hits the edge but falls well short of the cordon"
"length ball angling into middle stump, a bit of extra bounce. Gets up on his toes to ride the bounce and clip watchfully into the leg side, just past short leg. Again some yes-no action between these two, and they decide not to chance the single"
"length ball shaping back towards off stump, defended towards midwicket, with Taylor's bat coming down at an angle, slicing across the line a little"
"length ball on off stump, blocked back to the bowler with that slicing motion again. A bit of extra bounce, so he's momentarily off his feet"
"well bowled, a little fuller and wider, asking if Taylor fancies a drive. Left alone. It's a good line to bowl early on with Taylor adopting an open stance against the left-armer"
"excellent leave, on length. This one shapes back in from the corridor, and bounces over the top of the stumps"
"wider line now, continuing with the angle away. Left alone"
"full, slanting away from off stump, and this time Taylor does drive, with a twirl of his wrists to keep the ball down, but straight to extra-cover"
"length ball close to off stump, a bit of extra bounce. Hops to ride the bounce and defend right by his feet"
"big inward movement, and it isn't far from the top of off stump after Williamson elects to leave. Again, trusting the bounce"
"length ball outside off, straightens a touch. Gets across to defend towards point"
"back of a length close to off stump, gets on top of the bounce and blocks it back to the bowler"
"wide length ball, left alone. 129.8kph"
"back of a length outside off, lets it come and punches into the cover point region"
"short and wide to start, but Pakistan have a man at deep point to ensure Williamson gets just one for that square cut. He's overstepped too."
"length ball outside off, and Taylor <strong>is beaten</strong> as he has a poke at it without moving his feet"
"short and wide, and you don't bowl there to Taylor even if you have a deep point. Cut away fiercely, to the left of the man on the boundary"
"length ball, a bit of swing in towards off stump, defended watchfully into the covers. 136kph"
"wide length ball, lots of outswing, but it's far too wide to make Taylor play"
"ooh, <strong>beats him</strong> for the second time in the over. Back of a length, fifth-stump line, straightens off the seam as Taylor jabs at it with hard hands"
"back of a length, closer to off stump, rides the bounce and pushes into the cover point region"

"length, around off, defended to cover"
"length, outside off, going at 139kph, and he leaves"
"length, swings away from outside off, and he leaves again"
"a bit wider, and Williamson drives this through covers. Wasn't completely forward, though, and doesn't get full purchase on the shot. Won't get a boundary, as a result"
"this is better! Fuller again, and a fair amount of width from Naseem, and Williamson drives this time towards extra cover. It still pulls up ahead of the boundary, as Afridi chases it down"
"length, around off, and Taylor shoulders arms"
"fuller, straighter, and he whips this one off his toes to deep backward square leg. Fine leg gets around to his left to pull this up ahead of the boundary. This was bowled at 139kph as well"

"length, around off, and he defends"
"length, zips back in from outside off, and he defends with bat close to body"
"little shorter, and he hops to defend this 133.2 kph ball, bowled just around the off stump line"

"length, around off, and he defends with soft hands"

"length, outside off, and he leaves this"
"fuller, around off, driven back to the bowler"
"full, a bit wide, and he has a swing at it. This is bowled at 140 kph, and it moves away a bit off the seam, and <strong>beats his bat</strong>. Much better from Shah"
"shorter length, nips away after pitching outside off, and he leaves"
"straighter, and he flicks this towards deep square leg. Easy two on offer for Taylor"
"fuller, wide outside off, and he leaves after moving towards the line of the ball"
"full, and he plays this just to the right of mid-on, and sets off. <strong>That would have been close if the direct hit had taken place</strong>! Williamson is understandably annoyed with himself"
"jags back from outside off, and he is unable to whip this away towards square leg"

"full, defended back towards the bowler"

"length, a bit of nip away from outside off, and he leaves. This was delivered at 135.2 kph"

"length ball slanting away from off stump, left alone"
"full on off stump, defended to extra-cover"

"what a delivery! Huge appeal from the bowler and everyone behind the stumps, but it isn't given. They're thinking of reviewing, and just as they were about to, the umpire indicates Naseem has overstepped. It doesn't matter, it's missed the edge by a fair distance.

"<strong>ooh, a lucky escape for Taylor</strong>! Length ball, that bounced a little lower than Taylor anticpated, as he defended. Took the inside edge, and spun back towards the leg stump, but just stayed wide enough. Taylor didn't know a lot about that"
"full, down the leg side, and ignored by Taylor"
"length, and he stretches forward to smother this around off"
"fuller, and he defends this around off"
"fuller, and he whips this to the left of short mid-wicket. They scoot across for a quick single, and in the end make it quite comfortably"

"fuller, driven towards short mid-wicket"

"length, outside off, driven hard, but straight to cover"

"length, yet again fetches this from outside off and slog sweeps this. Flatter, and through to the mid-wicket fence anyway"
"short, offering width as it turns away, and he can play this towards deep backward point. Before the sweeper on the off side can get to this and rifle in his return, they take two"

"fuller, around off, and he defends with a forward press"

"length, angles across, and he cuts this towards gully"
"dug in short, angling across, and he can duck underneath this"
"<strong>there's the breakthrough!</strong> Afridi strikes again, and with some smart bowling too. Pitches this one on a good length, having pushed Taylor back with a short ball before this, and it angles across Taylor, who cannot resist having a little old poke at this. Through to the keeper behind the wicket, and Afridi wheels away in celebration. Massive wicket this, and who else but Shaheen Shah Afridi, who now has three out of three"

"fuller now, a little wider, left alone"
"length ball, fifth-stump line, some movement in from wide of the crease. Left alone"

"leaves again. Slightly shorter length, but he still gets on the front foot before leaving"
"length ball angling in, gets closer to off stump now. Gets forward to defend, hits the inside half of the bat and drops down into the pitch"
"digs it in short, slanting across Williamson. Gets down low to evade it"
"another bouncer, seams in and down the leg side this time. Williamson gets into a low crouch and watches it sail over his head"
"good ball. Stays back to a length ball after those two bouncers, and this one's asking all the right questions.Slanted across the stumps, forcing Williamson to play, and seaming away a touch to run away into the off side after hitting the outside edge. <strong>Squared up</strong>, but plays close to his body and survives"

"what is up with Henry Nicholls? He was dropped a million times while making a century against West Indies in his last Test in Wellington. A couple of those were off the hook. Now Naseem tests him with a short one rising over his front shoulder. He takes on a hook, and hits it straight to long leg, where Abbas gets both hands to the low chance but <strong>puts it down</strong>"

"full, fairly close to off stump, punched firmly back to the bowler"
"bouncer, angling too far down the leg side to discomfit Nicholls in any way"

"full now, on leg stump, clipped down to long-on"
"nicely bowled. Wrong'un, but the ball doesn't turn too much. The angle across is exaggerated by some drift away from the left-hander, and he presses forward and leaves it"

"skips out to a flighted ball on off stump, drives to short extra-cover"

"short, only gets up to hip height on off stump, and Williamson is instantly in position to pull it away in front of square, to the left of midwicket. The slow outfield keeps it down to three runs, but Naseem has overstepped so New Zealand get four anyway"

"length ball outside off, left alone"
"short, wide, and was that another dropped chance? Cuts it away, to the right of Fawad Alam at point, and no, it bounces just short of him. Great effort to fall to his right and stop it"

"length ball close to off stump, jumps back and across to block it back to the bowler"
"fullish outside off, presses forward and blocks to short extra-cover"
"a touch too full on middle stump, clipped to long-on"

"floated across again, goes back to open his bat face and steer to backward point"

"defends this off the back foot, and able to take a single to long-on"
"short of a length, and he drives to cover"
"short, and he rocks back and dismisses this from his presence. Perhaps a sign that Ashraf is tiring now, because it's a rare error in length, and again he doesn't have the pace to bother these batsmen"
"fuller, on the pads, and he whips this towards mid-wicket. Easy two"
"fuller, a slightly miscued drive as he looks to go back down the wicket. Goes towards short mid-wicket, and Williamson admonishes himself for the lapse in judgement"
"too full, and he drives this right back past the bowler to the long-on boundary. Nothing more than just a supremely timed defensive push"
"extra bounce, just outside off, and goes over the bat as Williamson shapes to punch one through covers"

"length, angles across him, and he leaves"
"<strong>dropped again!</strong> This is terrible from Pakistan in the slips. Afridi gets one to angle across, and take the edge, and Haris Sohail at first slip sees this come into his hands low to his right, and right out! Is it a concentration issue? Is it lack of match practice? Or just not enough expertise in those positions? Perhaps just dropped a touch short of him, but a slight movement forward could still have created a better chance"

"swings back in to Williamson, and takes the bat, but <strong>has it also hit the pad before that?</strong> There's a stifled appeal, but Rizwan opts not to review. Good decision in the end, because that just went off the inside edge, on to pad, and through towards square leg"
"sharp movement back in to Nicholls, who was pressing forward to defend. Good on him to get some bat on this, albeit off the inside of the bat"
"fuller, and he defends from the crease"

"length, around off, and he presses forward to defend. Off the inside edge on to bat, thus stifling an appeal from the bowler"
"what a shot to bring up his century! Just leans into a cover drive, to one that offers marginal width. Has wide cover diving to his right, and mid-off scrambling away to fetch this. A nonchalant wave of the bat after taking off his helmet. Slowest Test ton among his 23 now"

"length, defended with a hop towards cover"
"fuller, angles across him, and he leaves it"
"full, a bit of width, and Williamson leans forward and drives to the point boundary, beats the man at backward point to his right. Poor ball, you don't want to bowl there to someone already in three figures"
"full again, not as wide, and not a half-volley, but I think Williamson now has the measure of the conditions, and has realised it's no longer seaming around that much. Gets forward, drives with a high left elbow through the big gap in the covers"

"back of a length close to off stump, opens his bat face and dabs to gully"

"full, angling across towards off stump, clipped watchfully back to the bowler"
"length ball, slanting away from off stump. Good leave from Williamson. Shaheen's still getting some bounce, which will be one source of encouragement for Pakistan"

"short on leg stump, gets up to around chest height. Steps across and rolls his wrists over a pull down to the right of long leg"

"length ball slanting into a wide-ish line outside off, left alone"
"length ball close to off stump, gets right behind it and blocks it back to the bowler"
"<strong>Naseem strikes!</strong> Nicholls considers a review, but then is talked out of it by Williamson. A short ball from Naseem Shah, from around the wicket, and he looks to pull this. Takes part of the glove as he is in a poor position, and pops up towards the slips cordon. Easy take for Shan Masood, and Shah looks up to the skies. Remember that he almost had Kane Williamson yesterday"

"dug in short yet again, and he weaves out of the way of this"

"length, angles across him, and he leaves"
"fuller, straighter, and defended towards mid-on. Cries of anguish from the bowler, as he was hoping to straighten this enough to bring a leg before decision into play"

"short of a length, punched wide of point for a single"

"length, draws him forward to smother it"
"length, stretches forward to defend this to the on side"
"<strong>Yasir gets the big wicket!</strong> It's a smart bit of work at slip too, and the umpires are looking to refer this to the TV umpire. They are giving it not out as the soft signal! It's a terrific ball from Yasir, as he draws Williamson forward to defend, and just turns enough to kiss the outside of the bat. And at slip, Haris Sohail just does enough to get his fingers underneath that"
"fuller ball, and he is forced to defend this"
"fuller, and he drives this through the cover region. There's a good chase on, but the fielder at cover cannot reel it back in"

"back of a length close to off stump, punched into the covers"

"full, on middle and off, clipped away wide of mid-on"
"nicely flighted outside off, trying to invite the drive. Left alone"
"ooh, plays back to one that hurries through with the angle. Not sure if it was the wrong'un or the topspinner. Jams his bat down and just keeps it out. Was homing in on off stump"

"full, slanting across to off stump, defended into the covers. the ball seamed away slightly, or maybe it was a cutter. Hit the outside half of the bat"

"bouncer to start, Santner ducks under it"
"gone, Faheem gets the breakthrough! Santner has been playing that back-foot punch away from his body, and perhaps this is a plan. Back of a length, a bit of width. He goes after it with an angled bat, no real footwork, and gets a thick edge through to Rizwan"
"digs it in short to greet the new man, who has to get his 6'8' frame down into a crouch in a hurry"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"length ball, probably sliding down leg. Looks to flick and misses, and that brings forth a mixed set of appeals from Pakistan's fielders. No interest from Faheem"

"nicely bowled. Dangled up loopily wide of off stump, and Jamieson looks to free his arms and slog it away. Dips and turns past his outside edge"
"shouts of catch it as Jamieson flicks in the air, past the fielder diving left at short leg. Quickish length ball on the stumps, inside-edged into pad I think"
goes back and makes a bit of room to punch this length ball with the turn through cover point. Nimble footwork there
"full, angling into off stump, driven firmly to mid-off"
"nicely bowled. Quite full, but not as full, along a similar line. Looks to drive again to mid-off, but the angle and length cause him to inside-edge into the leg side. Played quite a bit away from his body there"
"length ball close to off stump. Looks to shuffle across and work it leg side, can't quite manage it. Inside-edge into the turf"

"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"a touch short on off stump, goes back and punches firmly to cover point"
"tossed up now, not quite half-volley length on off stump. He's asking Jamieson to go ahead and try hitting him over the top, and he takes the invitation, going straight back over his head with a straight bat. Well played"
"shot! This one's tossed up wider outside off, and he frees his arms and launches it sweetly over the long-on boundary, getting down on his back knee in the process"
"more flight, but this one drops quickly onto a yorkerish length. Jams down to keep it down into the off side"

"another wrong'un, quicker, spinning into off stump. Stays leg-side of it to defend into the covers"
"tossed up slower on off stump, gets a big stride forward to smother the turn"
"ooh, this is lovely bowling. Jamieson plays back, playing the flatter trajectory rather than the length, which is pretty full. Has to jam his bat down very quickly to keep out this skidder - either a wrong'un or a flipper - and gets a thick inside edge that runs away between his legs and past leg stump. If that didn't hit bat, lbw was definitely on"
"length ball on off stump, blocked to mid-on"
"length ball angling into off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"short, a bit of width, and Watling likes that, even if he has to get both feet off the ground to ride the bounce. Chops it away on top of the bounce, and beats backward point to his right. Naseem has his head in his hands at the other end, he's bowled well so far in this spell until that ball"
"length ball, fifth-stump line, left alone"
"back of a length on off stump, defended into the on side"
"shot! Watling is in super form, and you don't feed him width when that's the case. Just short enough for him to camp back and cut it away crisply through point"

presses forward to defend one around off
"straighter ball, on a length, and he works it away towards deep backward square"
"full, down the leg side, and Watling looks for the sweep. Rizwan gets across and collects, and thinks about an appeal. They consider a review, but decide against it. More likely that there was a noise of the bat hitting the ground"

goes back to defend one around middle and leg
"fuller, driven to mid-wicket"
"down the pads, and he can work this towards deep midwicket"

"short, and he ducks underneath this"
"short, and he has a waft at this, but misses"
"short, and closer to the body, and Jamieson is happy to hook. Rolls his wrists to keep it down, and picks up two between deep square leg and deep fine leg"
"short again, and just not rapid enough to force the ball backward of square. He can hook it off in front of square, and picks up two more"
"short, around the ribs, and he defends with a hop. Had to put a lot into this ball, to get it up high to the towering figure of Jamieson"

worked towards square leg
"this has <strong>crept a bit low</strong>, and Southee is bowled. It's a googly, and slow, looping one. Southee looks to go back to drive but is beaten by the line and the lowness of the bounce. The New Zealand bowlers won't mind seeing the two-faced nature of the bounce today"
"tossed up around off, and he defends"
"length, and he goes back to defend this"
"tossed up around off, turning away, and he leaves"
"fuller, defended towards square leg"

"tossed up on off stump, good stride out to block to mid-off"
"full on off stump, clipped to mid-on, who's stationed fairly deep. Don't know whether it's because Pakistan want him off strike"
"bowled him, this is why they gave away that single. Perfect yorker, and Wagner plays a hurried flick, plays all around it, and his stumps are in disarray, but, wait, what has happened here? They've checked Shaheen's front foot, <strong>and he's overstepped!</strong>"
"short, angling down leg, and Wagner pulls it off his hip. Doesn't make a whole lot of contact, but enough to sent it flying wide of the keeper, to his right"
"goes for the yorker again, not quite full enough, Wagner punches to mid-off with a lovely straight bat"
"is that a bit of reverse? Length ball, a bit of late shape into the pads. He's stuck on the crease, but he brings his bat down straight and defends to midwicket"
"bouncer, Wagner misses the hook and the ball zips over the top of his head"
"big appeal for lbw as Wagner falls over a flick against another wicked yorker. Not given, but <b>Pakistan have reviewed</b>... Big inswing, probably reverse, and it smacks Wagner on the front boot as he falls over, but it's going down the leg side by a fair distance"
"tossed up on off stump, clipped back to the bowler"
"wrong'un, pitching outside leg. Looks to flick from the crease but misses, and is hit on the pad"

"tossed up wide of off, swept along the ground to deep square leg"

"full again, on middle and off, clipped to midwicket"
"low full-toss on off stump, and Wagner flicks in the air, but it bounces short of diving fielder at mid-on and beats him to his right"

"back of a length on middle and off, lets it come on and defends towards gully"

"tossed up outside off, driven to mid-off"
"looks to sweep again, from wide of off. Misses, and this time the impact is outside off so there's no appeal"
"full on middle stump, and that's a super shot. Clipped away through midwicket, and there's no one there to stop it, with a huge gap between long-on and deep square leg. Pakistan may need to reconsider these defensive fields"
"or not. Goes short now, and Watling leans back and looks to ramp over the slips. The ball straightens into him a little, cramping him for room, and all he manages is to dink it to the left of gully, where Yasir Shah takes a good diving catch"
"full and straight is the plan, follows him a little as he backs away from leg stump. Jabbed back to the bowler"
"slower ball, back of a length. Looks to slog it over the leg side, and only manages an inside-edge into his body"
"full-toss on leg stump, strives too hard while going for the yorker. Makes room and punches straight of mid-off"

"tossed up on off stump, half-forward to defend, edges it wide of slip"
"full on leg stump, clipped to the left of deep backward square leg"

"tossed up wide of off, inviting the big slog. Left alone, and it spins away sharply"
"wrong'un, starts too wide outside off to make Boult play"
"quicker full ball close to off stump. Jabs hard in defence, and the inside edge runs away through square leg"
"tossed up outside off, driven to long-off"
"tossed up outside off, driven to long-off. Why do Pakistan have a long-off for Trent Boult!?!?"
"big slog, and finally Yasir has broken this stand. Tossed up slow outside off, Wagner miscues the slog, and midwicket and the keeper converge towards the ball, almost colliding, but Rizwan moves out of the way in the end and lets Masood take the catch"

"beautiful delivery, and has the substitute fielder dropped a catch? <strong>Tough low chance</strong> to Mitchell at third slip, after Masood is drawn into a drive well in front of his body.

"Back of a length, angling down leg, can't connect with the glance off the hip"
"length ball angling into off stump, defended into the on side"
"length ball, angling into middle stump and shaping away ever so slightly. Again, Masood is crease-bound, and his bat comes down at an angle from gully. Looks to defend into the on side, squirts it into the covers instead"

"length ball outside off, left alone"
"wide outside off, left alone"
"fuller, outside off, and left alone yet again"

"length, around off, and he defends from the crease"
"wide of the crease, fuller, straighter, and he presses forward to defend this"
"swings this down the leg side, and Shan tries to have a waft at it, but fails to make contact"

"back of a length, defended towards point"
"length, angles into him from just outside off, and he defends with bat close to body"
"short, and he is able to play a rasping cut. Uppish, but well over the gully region"

"length, around off, and he gets behind the line to defend this with a dead bat"

"length, around off, and hooping further away, and he shoulders arms"
"length, and he is able to play this wth the angle towards square leg. Inner part of the bat, though, and leads to several hands on heads from the fielding side"
"width on offer, and he flays this through the cover region. Good attempt from Santner, running through from cover, but he cannot reel it back in despite putting in a dive"
"fuller, straighter, and met with a straight bat. And a loud, resounding 'NO' to the non-striker"

"short, and angling back into him. He gets up on his toes and cuts this towards deep point. Well controlled in the end"
"length, around off, and he drives this to point"

"short, and he can fetch this from around his hips towards deep square leg"
"short, down the leg side, and he lets this pass"

"length, around off, and he defends from the crease"
"fuller, around off, and he stretches forward to defend this"
"down the leg side, and he looks to glance this, and gets a fine tickle through to Watling. Doesn't review, so he knows he has got some bat only on this. Jamieson strikes, but it won't be the best ball he would have bowled in his short Test career thus far. Disappointing end to what had been a disciplined innings from Shan Masood"

"bouncer, gets Abid to duck hurriedly because it isn't bouncing particularly high"
"back of a length, angling into off stump, punched firmly back to the bowler"
"goes wide of the crease and angles this in sharply. Keeps low while also beating Abbas for pace as he decides late to play at it. I guess he wanted to leave but jabbed his bat down when he saw it keep low. Misses off stump by a reasonable distance, though"
"length ball, goes wider outside off, Abbas leaves it alone"
"length ball on off and middle, defended back to the bowler"
"ooh, nicely bowled. There isn't much happening in the air or off the deck, but Southee goes cross-seam, and hits the perfect length very close to off stump. Forces him to play at it from the crease, and the ball <b>straightens past his edge</b>"
"straightens past the edge again, but this time Abid didn't really play at it, just offered a shadow defensive shot inside the line of the ball and allowed it to go past. Well played"
"full, a bit of swing away from off stump. Blocked into the covers, playing a little away from the body without getting a stride forward"
"fullish, a little wider, left alone"
"well left. Wide of the crease again, angling into the corridor, not far outside off, but he knows where his off stump is, and gets a good stride forward before shouldering arms"

"full, angling into off stump, blocked back down the wicket"
"bouncer over off stump, again the bounce isn't steep but Abbas evades it well, ducking down low"

"first run for Abbas, so Azhar Ali will keep his record. Length ball, nipping in off the seam towards the stumps. Wanted to clip that to mid-on, probably, and it hits the inside half of the bat and runs into the backward square leg region"
"full, close to off stump, presses forward to block into the off side"
"full outside off, left alone"

"length ball on off stump, nicely behind it to block it back where it came from"

"bouncer close to off stump, steep bounce on this occasion after Abid Ali leaves it alone"
"fullish, angling into off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"ooh, this one kicks up from nowhere. Back of a length, angling into off stump, and Abid looks to defend off the back foot only for the ball to jump at him and hit his glove. Luckily for him, the ball goes along the ground towards point, but it's also left his right hand in a lot of pain"
"length ball, slides on towards off stump. Bat and pad close together as he blocks it back to the bowler"
"tossed up slow outside off, pushed into the covers"
"flatter, slides on towards middle and leg, goes back to block to short leg"
well bowled. Draws him forward with flight outside off. Goes with the angle to hit the inside half of the bat and roll into the leg side as he defends
"flighted and full on off stump, blocked into the point region"
"<b>turn, for the first time in the over</b>. Gives it some air just outside off, and it dips and turns to take the shoulder of Abbas's bat as he comes forward to defend. Squirts wide of slip, and he did well to take his bottom hand off and keep it down"
"full, angling into off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"bowled him, that's superb from Jamieson! There will be no Hanif heroics from Abid today. Perfect length, on the fuller side of a good length, angling in from a little wider on the crease, and perhaps because of that ball that kicked up to hit his hand in Jamieson's last over, and because of Jamieson's height and bounce in general, Abid is a little late getting forward to play it. That creates a gap between bat and pad, and it rushes through to knock back off stump. 137kph, one of the quicker balls he's delivered today too. Bat came down at an angle too, slicing across the ball"
"good ball to welcome him, straightening towards the top of off. Azhar doesn't get forward to block this, and his bat also slices across it a little, squirting the ball into the off side"
"back of a length in the corridor, and Azhar plays it down towards gully, taking his bottom hand off to cushion it. Hit the bat high up, on the outer half of the sticker"
"a little fuller, and Azhar presses forward to defend into the point region. Quite steep bounce here too"
"length ball angling into off stump, gets behind it to block towards mid-on"
"full, slanting across to off stump, and Abbas doesn't get his feet moving at all. Pushes at it with hard hands, aiming towards mid-on, and gets a thick edge that streaks away past gully"
"back of a length, slanting away from off stump, left alone"
"length ball, angling in from wide of the crease. Not too far from off stump but he judges the line well and leaves it alone"
"full, angling into off stump. Looks to clip it leg side, with the angle, but plays with an angled bat and the ball hits the outside half of it and runs away into the point region"
"bouncer over off stump, Abbas ducks"
"got him, just what New Zealand wanted when they brought Boult back so quickly. Length ball, angling into the corridor, and Abbas is late getting forward to defend, and that's enough to catch the outside edge, which carries at a comfortable waist height to Ross Taylor at first slip. 150th catch in Tests for him."
"dug in short, and he ducks under this to avoid the ball"
"length, outside off, and left alone"
"length, bowled a bit wide of the crease, and almost squares up Azhar, who jams his bat down in time to defend towards cover"

"length, outside off, and he leaves. Keeps a touch low on its way through to Watling"
"length, straighter, blocked back down the pitch"
"back of a length, and he goes back to defend. Keeps a bit low, but he does well to adjust and defend towards square leg"
"this has taken off from back of a length, and he was looking to get out of the way of this after moving outside the line. Goes and hits him around his stomach"
"short, angles in again, and he hops and defends this"
"length, bounce away from him, as also some swing after passing the batsman, who leaves"
"a touch fuller, and Azhar allows this to go through, after initally looking to get behind the line. The ball was just outside, so he could see it through, and withdraw his bat"

"length, around off, driven to mid-off"
"back of a length, and he defends after getting behind the line"
"great ball, just jagging away from him, and they have gone up for a caught behind appeal. It's not been given, but <strong>Williamson has reviewed this immediately</strong>. Azhar followed the line of this a bit, and he has indeed got a little tickle on this through to Watling. Terrific bowling from Southee, and this is another body blow for Pakistan!"
"fuller, and he defends after straightening out his really unique front-on stance"
"full, on the pads, and he can work this away towards deep backward square"
"fuller length, around off, and he defends with a slight forward press"
"<strong>another in this over!</strong> This has been just looped up a bit more, perhaps a touch slower, going across Sohail and on a fuller length. He has a drive at it, but his feet go nowhere, and as a result the shot is skewed in the air. Nicholls takes the catch at gully, and New Zealand are cock-a-hoop!"

"fuller, driven back towards the bowler"
"fuller, angles across him, and he defends towards point"
"full, wide, and he cracks this through covers. A positive shot after a long time in this innings"
"short, and he swings this around the bend towards deep square leg. Hurries through for two, and needs to put in a dive to complete the second. Perhaps saved by a slightly wayward throw from Jamieson. <strong>Wow! Pakistan!</strong>"

"length, a bit of nip back in off the seam, and Fawad does well to whip this away towards square leg"

"short, cramps him for room. There are two catching square legs, but it lands short of them"
"length ball angling into off stump, presses forward and clips to mid-on"
"there's that steep bounce from a length. Gets back and across to defend in front of off stump, and the ball jumps at him and hits the handle of the bat. Good job he released his bottom hand, because that was where it was heading"

"length ball, slanting in from wide of the crease but finishing wide enough for Rizwan to leave"
"length ball angling into off stump, blocked into the covers"

"continues from round the wicket, full, angling into off stump, checked drive to mid-off. May have been another off-pace ball"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"and he starts with a slightly overpitched ball angling into off stump. Driven firmly, and there's no one at mid-off to stop that. The only fielder remotely in the ball's vicinity was extra-cover"
"chest-high short ball on a stump-to-stump line, pulled to deep square leg"
"shortish, a lot of width, and Santner throws himself to his right at point to stop this firm square-cut from Fawad"
"full, angling into off stump, clipped watchfully to mid-on"
"full, not quite a half-volley, outside off. Looks to drive through the covers, ends up hitting it to mid-off with his bottom hand coming into the shot"
"full, angling into off stump, definitely not driving length. Shows the full face to punch to mid-off"

"back over the wicket to the right-hander, slants a full ball across him and into the channel outside off. Invites the drive, goes for it without really getting a stride in, and the ball is briefly in the air but falls short of short extra-cover. Excellent follow-up to all those short balls"
"fullish length ball slanting across into the corridor, left alone"
"length ball angling into off stump. Shuffles across to defend, plays with a closed face and the ball rolls into the off side off the leading edge, but he played close to his body, with soft hands"

"length ball on off stump, hops to ride the bounce and defends with soft hands, right by his feet"
"good leave. Fullish length in the corridor, trying to induce the drive, but Rizwan picks the length and realises it isn't full enough for that. A bit of nibble in off the seam too"
"back of a length on off stump, rides the bounce and clips it in front of square on the on side"
well played. Rising ball in the corridor. Jumps to ride the bounce and cut it down with a roll of the wrists. Yells nonono when he realises the ball is too close to the backward point fielder to chance a single

"short again, and he ducks under this"
"short, and he stabs it away towards short mid-wicket"

"hint of shape back in, from outside off, and it reaches a forward defensive touch from Rizwan"
"the short ball works for Wagner! He comes round the wicket and digs it in to the centre of the pitch, and Fawad takes the bait, looking for the hook. Just a little tickle through to Watling, and Wagner celebrates. Not bad for a man bowling with a fractured toe!"
"dug in short, and he ducks under this"
"short again, and he looks to hook. Gets a top edge, but it goes towards fine leg on the bounce"
"back of a length, across Rizwan, who leaves"
"short, down the leg side, and he <strong>looks to take him on</strong> again. Too quick for him, though"

"short, down the leg side, and he can ignore this"

"short, angles across him, and he hops and gets behind the line to defend it"
"short, angling down the leg side, and he can play this towards deep fine leg"

"length, goes back into him from outside off, and he defends towards point"

"length, around off, and he defends"
"full, on the pads, and he works it away towards deep fine leg"
"short, into the body from around the wicket, and pulled away towards deep square leg"
"ducks under a short one. Didn't climb a lot, which is again indicative of some variable bounce"
"short, and he ducks under this again. Yet another one that didn't climb very high"

"length ball on off stump, gets on the front foot to block it back to the bowler"
"full, a little wider of off. Reaches out slightly to push watchfully into the covers"
"shot, unfortunate that there's a set of stumps at the other end. Goes wide on the crease and angles a full ball in towards off stump, and Rizwan punches it back with the full face showing"
"ooh, a bit of inward movement from a fullish length. Not full enough to be driving away from the body, and that shot morphs into a flick, and the inside edge runs away through square leg"

"full, wide outswinger outside off, left alone"

"full outside off, driven crisply to mid-off"
"short, wide, and Rizwan cuts beautifully, meeting it right on top of the bounce and finding the gap to the left of point"

"length ball on the stumps, punched firmly back to the bowler, who has an angry shy at the stumps after fielding it. In fact he threw in the direction of the backtracking batsman - intentionally or not, we don't know - rather than the stumps"

"back of a length outside off, makes room to stab through backward point"
"tossed up on off stump, driven inside-out to deep cover. Santner cries 'bowlerbowlerbowler' to alert the fielder to throw to his end after the batsmen think of a second. They decide against it"
"tossed up outside off, presses forward for a push to the right of cover. Sets off for the single but Rizwan wisely sends him back"

"back of a length, and some <strong>extra bounce</strong>, as Rizwan looks to cut this away and sees this go over his bat"

"length, around off, and he defends towards cover"
"length, a bit of swing back in, and he's nicely forward to defend"

"length, around off, driven to cover"
"length, angled across him, and he leaves"
"fuller, around off, and he leaves this"
"<strong>that's well bowled!</strong> It's a regular length ball, not unlike the previous one, but just jags away a touch, and also keeps a bit low. Faheem has a little nibble, but no touch thankfully"

"fuller, straighter, and he works this to the right of Wagner at mid-on"
"length, around middle, and he whips it away to mid-wicket. They set off for the second, and there's a direct hit at the non-striker's end! <strong>What a way for Rizwan to go!</strong> Mitchell Santner comes charing in from deep square leg, stops, picks up and hits the stumps at the non-striker's end. Rizwan's valiant innings comes to a rather anti-cilmactic end"
"length, around off, and Yasir drives this with a forward press"
"ooh, edged and through the vacant fourth slip for four! Swing away from him outside off, and he has a little dab at it. Cannot keep it down, but gets enough bat to get it past third slip and away from gully"

"back of a length, defended towards mid-wicket"
"length, nibbles away from outside off, and beats the outside edge as Yasir shapes to defend"

"fuller, around off, defends it to cover"
"length, around off and middle, and he plays this with soft hands towards mid-wicket. Wants one, but Yasir sends him back as Wagner moves swiftly to his left from mid-on to stop this"
"down the leg side, and he whips it away. One bounce through to deep fine leg in place for that"
"<strong>got 'im!</strong> This is fast, full, and swings back in a touch from around off. Yasir looks to drive down the ground, but leaves a substantial gap between his pads and the bat coming down, and the ball goes through to rattle the top of off. Executed to perfection"

"length, around off, and he defends towards point"
"wide of off, and he flays this in the air, and over cover"

"full, down the pads, and he looks to whip this away. Off the pads towards fine leg, but will allow them to come back for the second"
"<strong>very lucky!</strong> Dug in short, and he looks to pull to begin with, and then wants to pull out. It takes the lower part of the bat, as it swings back down, and that takes it on the bounce towards long-on. He's happy to take the single on offer"
"back of a length, outside off, and he leaves"
"length, swings away from him and he leaves"
"full, down the leg side, and he fails to make contact"

"beats him with one that stays low, and moves a touch away from outside off, from a good length"
"length, straighter, and he plays this towards short mid-wicket"
"<strong>that's the follow-on avoided!</strong> Out of the blue, Wagner provides a juicy full toss around off and middle, and he puts this away towards mid-wicket. Also brings up his highest Test score"
"length, around middle, and he whips this away through the mid-wicket region. Won't get four for it, but he will be happy with two"

"length, angles in from around off, and he defends from the crease"
"shortish length, angles into his body, and he looks to move out of the way. Goes off his hip towards square leg"
"length, around off, and he defends by getting behind the line"
"looks for a yorker, but ends up bowling a wayward full toss. Defended by Afridi close to his waist. I think it may have even been above waist height, but the umpires let it pass. Jamieson had his hand up in apology immediately"
"short, and he gets one leg up to swing this away towards deep square leg. He's happy to allow Shaheen to face Wagner this late in the day"
"short, but he does well to get behind the line, into his body, and drop it down with a dead bat"
"ooh, Wagner does what he does best! Sharp, short, and into the body. Gets Shaheen into a bit of a tangle, who tries to withdraw his glove at the last moment, but before that the ball seems to have kissed the glove on its way through to short leg. Should Afridi have reviewed this anyway? There's a slim chance that this ball hit glove as it come off the handle, in which case the decision would have been overturned"
"yorker to Naseem Shah, but just a bit of swing down leg side"
"close to another bat-pad catch! Length, and he looks to defend with bat away from his body. Runs close to short leg, off the bat, but just lands short"
"length, swings across him, and he has a little poke at it, but misses"
"back of a length, and he slaps this in the air. Placed well, gets it towards cow corner"
"<strong>edged and taken behind the wicket!</strong> Jamieson offers one on a length, just wide of off, and he looks to attack this. Perhaps wants the run down to third man, but there's no foot movement on this, and it runs off the edge through to Watling"
"length, around off, defended towards cover"
"full, swinging back in and strikes him on the pads, but going down leg"
"down the leg side, and left alone"
"fullish, just around off and Blundell stretches forward to defend. Has this hit pad first? <strong>Pakistan go up in review after the umpire says not out</strong>. Good chance impact might stay with umpire's call there. There is some sharp movement back, and bat is awfully close to pad when the ball comes in. Blundell might get the benefit of doubt here. The TV umpire says there's nothing conclusive for him to overturn this"
"full, around leg stump, and he is able to work this off his pads towards long leg. Fine leg gets around to his left and allows him two runs"
"length, angles across him, and he shoulders arms"

"short, fetched from outside off, and hooked away in front of square"
"fuller, wider, and left alone"

"back of a length around off stump, defended into the point region"
"full now, draws him forward to defend in front of off stump. A bit of nibble back, and the ball hits the inside half of the bat"
"length ball slanting across, tight on off stump again. Defended off the front foot into the off side"
"length ball on middle stump, and Latham defends, off the inner half of the bat into the square leg region. He sets off for a risky single, and maybe there was a chance of a run out as he turned back, but Abid Ali, moving to his left from midwicket, sends down a dreadful throw well wide of the stumps"
"full on off stump, punched to mid-off"
"fullish, angling away from off stump, left alone"

"full, angling across, gets a good stride forward to block into the covers"
"length ball close to off stump, defended towards backward point off the front foot"
"nicely driven. Was just full enough, angling away from off stump, to allow Blundell to press forward and extend his arms through a checked drive to the left of cover"
"once again, quite full. Even wider this time, and Blundell drives with a high left elbow to the fielder at short cover"
"Abbas finds Latham's edge again. Not quite full enough to be driving so far out in front of his body, and the ball may have seamed away a touch, or maybe it just went with the angle when he expected inswing. Thick edge, goes low to the left of second slip this time, but it doesn't carry into Shan Masood's left hand as he dives"
"length ball on off stump, defended back to the bowler"
"shifts his line a little wider, left alone"
"length ball, not far from off stump but Latham trusts the angle and leaves again"
"<strong>again the edge</strong>, and again it doesn't carry! Length ball, pitching on middle and off and seaming away just a touch. Latham is stuck on the crease, has a nervy little push at it, and the ball falls between first and second slip diving desperately across each other"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"length ball angling away from off stump, left alone"
"full and wide, full enough to drive away from the body with a relative degree of safety. Slices it away through the point region"
"length ball angling across to off stump, gets back and across to block it back to Shaheen"
"length ball in the corridor, shuffles across and presses forward to defend to short extra-cover"
"a little fuller, quite close to off stump. Presses forward and looks for the pushed single into the covers, but Latham sends him back"

"fuller, outside off, watchful leave from Azhar"
"length ball, and he leaves this. Line was just outside off, and they go up in appeal. Not given, but they review anyway. I think it might be missing the top of off, or stay with umpire's call. Just going over, in fact"

"full, a hint of swing in towards off stump. Positive stride forward to push to mid-off"
"fullish, close to off stump, no swing. Gets a good stride forward to push with soft hands between mid-off and extra-cover to pick up what should have been a quick single. There's a missed throw at the keeper's end, however, leading to two overthrows, and a wild throw from the fine leg fielder over Watling's head for one more overthrow"
"length ball angling down leg, tucked away to long leg"
"Steep bounce in the corridor, effort ball from Southee. Gets on his toes to ride the bounce and keep it down into the gully region"
"full outside off, and Southee <strong>picks up his 300th Test wicket</strong> with another bit of subtle artistry. He's just pushed Haris back with a short, rising ball, and now Haris's front foot goes nowhere while driving what looks like a four ball. It's a four ball in absolute terms, but it's a wicket ball now with that error in footwork, as he spoons a low catch to short extra-cover. What a magnificent bowler he is. Huge ovation for him from the Bay Oval crowd, and handshakes and back-pats from his teammates"
"Length ball on off stump, back and across to defend into the covers"
"length ball angling into off stump, defended into the covers from the crease"
"ooh, that's a sharp bouncer. Speedometer says 128kph, but it looked much nastier. Unexpectedly steep bounce, and Azhar, who thinks of hooking, has to swivel himself out of the way in a hurry"
"length ball outside off, left alone"
"back of a length, angling into off stump, and there's that extra bounce again. Jumps across to defend, his bat comes down at an angle, and it's off the shoulder of his bat to the right of gully"

"fuller, towards the pads, and he defends towards short mid-wicket"
"<strong>this takes off from a length!</strong> Length is good, around off, and Azhar looks to get behind the line. It jumps up, and he has to take his bottom hand off to play it. Well done!"
"and now one that keeps low from the same spot. Azhar is firmly behind it, and does well to play it with the bottom part of the bat"
"fullish, down the leg side, and Fawad looks to flick this. Off the thigh pad, as Watling dives away to his right to catch this"

"length, around off, a bit of movement back in off the seam, and he defends"

"length, around off, defended and it wobbles away towards short cover"

"length, a bit outside off, and he defends"
"wide of the crease, dug in short, and Azhar is happy to duck and let this pass through"

"length, straighter line, defended"

"length, presses forward to smother it under his eyes"
"fuller length, and he presses forward to defend"
"better line, outside off, turning in, Forces Fawad to lunge forward, and perhaps also bring the two short legs in play. This time, he has done well to cover the line and defend"
"fullish, around off, and Azhar shapes to flick. Seems to miss bat, and go through to Watling. A little noise, as bat actually jams against his pad"

"back of a length, a touch too straight, and Azhar tucks it away very fine, no chance for fine leg to catch up with it"
"the breakthrough arrives off the ninth ball of the day. A rare loose push from Azhar. Full, slanting into the corridor, and I don't know if he's playing for swing, but that was probably wide enough to leave. He goes for a checked cover drive instead, not quite getting his weight fully forward, and nicks off to the keeper, with the ball simply continuing with the angle. Replays show it seamed away slightly"

"fullish, angling into off stump, and Fawad doesn't quite get a stride forward after that crab-like shuffle. Clips it in the air, but <strong>wide of Nicholls at short leg</strong>"
"big lbw appeal after getting this to nip into Rizwan. Not given, not reviewed. Height's the issue, I think. Oh, inside edge too. Length ball, he's standing out of his crease and then he presses forward to defend. Inside edge into front pad"

"back of a length close to off stump, hops to ride the bounce and blocks into the off side"
"once again, an unconvincing drive to a full ball outside off stump. Not fully forward, and he closes his bat face in an attempt to keep it down on top of the bounce, and he could have been aiming to hit that anywhere from cover to mid-on.

"shortish, not far enough outside off to cut. Stops on him a little and he chops it to the wider of the two short covers"

"back of a length, angling into the stumps from around the wicket. Hops and defends towards midwicket"

"length, angles in from around off, and Rizwan defends towards point, stretching forward"

"length, around leg stump and he defends"

"short, down the leg side, and he leaves"
"back of a length, around leg stump, and met with an absolutely dead bat"
"length, around middle and leg, and he nurdles this towards square leg. There's a short square leg, who has to move to his left and <strong>Santner there has a shy at the stumps</strong> as they pinch a single. Rizwan makes it, and Santner doesn't hit, luckily!"

"flatter, straighter, and he looks to play this towards square leg. On the bounce to forward short leg"
"length, and he defends with a forward press. Driven to cover in the process"

"short, around off, and he defends"
"back of a length, spinning in towards off stump, makes some room and steers through point"
"sharp turn. Slows it down outside off stump, and the length freezes Rizwan's feet. Pushes away from the body to defend, and the ball <strong>rips past his edge</strong>"
"ooh, this one goes on with the angle towards off stump. Or maybe just straightens a touch. Defended from the crease, hardly any footwork again"
"length ball on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"full, angling into middle and leg, gets forward to nurdle it around the corner into the backward square leg region"
"fifty for Fawad as Santner flights one full on leg stump. Gets forward to clip through square leg. He raises what seems like a cautionary hand towards the dressing room as they stand up to applaud him. A lot more to do, he seems to be telling them"
"starts with a bouncer, and Fawad ducks under it fairly comfortably"
that's Jamieson's big threat. Extra bounce in the corridor. Hops and defends into the gully region with an angled bat. Could be dangerous
"and again, jumps up from just short of a length. The line is closer to off stump now, and Fawad is thinking of ducking before realising it's shooting straight for his head. <strong>Fends it away in a hurry</strong>, into the leg side"

"length ball in the corridor, left alone"

"full on leg stump, from over the wicket, clipped to the left of midwicket"
"looped up outside off from around the wicket, driven towards point, who's in a deepish position - possibly for the uppish cut - so there's a single available"
"big appeal for lbw as Santner gets one to turn and bounce out of the footmarks outside the left-hander's off stump. Big stride forward and across to pad it away, and it's hard to say if it spun enough. New Zealand think of reviewing the not-out decision, and decide against it. Just missing off stump, according to Hawkeye"
"a touch short, pitching outside off, and Fawad rocks back to force it away through cover point"
"short again, a little straighter in line, and he gets back and across to pull to the square leg boundary. Santner gave away a few long-hops to Fawad last night as well"
"short, wide, definitely cuttable except it's sneaking well below Rizwan's bat at shin height. The danger for Pakistan is if these balls keep low on a stump-to-stump line. Jamieson's overstepped too"
"full, angling down leg, misses the flick"
"back of a length in the corridor, nicely behind it, lets it come on to block into the point region"
"fullish, angling down leg. Half an appeal for lbw after Rizwan misses the flick. Seems to have taken a blow in the process. Straight onto the flap of the pad, I had thought it eluded the pad to hit an unprotected part of the leg"
"back of a length, angling into off stump from wide of the crease. Keeps slightly low. Watches it well and clips it away through square leg. The slowness of the pitch has allowed the batsmen to adjust to the low bounce on most occasions"
"back of a length close to off stump, lets it come on and defends with soft hands. This kept low as well, hit the bottom part of the bat"
"back of a length, a bit more bounce this time on an off-stump line. Hops and clips watchfully into the on side"
"shortish close to off stump, makes some room and chops it into the covers"

"flat again, angling down leg, looks to pull it behind square and misses"
"tossed up outside off, driven to cover point"
"low full-toss on middle and leg, clipped to square leg. Looks like the attempted slower cutter"
"back of a length angling into off stump, defended to short leg off the inside half of the bat. Cross-seam, and it came back in off the pitch"
"back of a length outside off, lets it come on and steers between backward point and gully"
"full, fairly close to off stump, and Fawad goes for an uncharacteristic drive away from his body, with an angled bat. I think it was full enough to drive but he didn't get his weight forward in time. Just missed the outside edge, and the bat hit ground to cause some excitement among the New Zealand players"
"full again, in the blockhole around off stump, jabbed away into the off side"
well played. Length ball keeps a little low as it angles into middle and off. Ensures his bat is nice and straight while defending from the crease
"back of a length close to off stump, defended into the point region"
"full and flat on leg stump, defended into the on side"
"tossed up high outside off, driven with a lot of bottom hand to mid-off. Didn't come on for the drive through cover"
"short, spinning away from off stump, makes room to cut but can only chop it to short cover"
flat slider angling down leg. Looks to go back and flick and the ball hurries through to hit the front pad
"good ball. Dipping onto a good length on off stump, sliding on with the arm. Defended back to the bowler"

"back of a length on off stump, defended to the squarer of two short covers"
"short, angling across into the corridor, slapped towards backward point"
"back of a length close to off stump, and Fawad pokes at it with a slightly angled bat and <strong>inside-edges it past his leg stump</strong>. Santner runs to the ball from backward square leg, and has an inaccurate shy at the bowler's end to concede an overthrow"
"full on middle and leg from over the wicket, clipped to short leg"
"a touch short close to off stump, makes room to cut to deep backward point. While Santner's tended to drop a little short, Fawad has created these scoring opportunities with his quick footwork"
"sharp turn and bounce, but it pitches well outside off and Rizwan leaves it alone"
"closer to off stump now, waits on it and chops it down to slip"
"nice length, keeps going with the angle into the stumps. Keeps his front pad out of the way to block it back"
"short now, spinning away from off stump with a bit of extra bounce, cuts it down to backward point"
"left alone. Again there's sharp turn and bounce available from a good length outside off stump. If he can get a couple to turn like that from a stump-to-stump line, he'll cause a lot of uncertainty"
"length ball close to off stump, defended to short midwicket"
"length ball on middle and off, stays a little leg-side of the ball and punches to mid-on"

"full on middle stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"short, wide, cut away and he finds the gap to the right of deepish cover point"
"nicely bowled. Slows it down, hits a good length on leg stump and gets it to straighten with extra bounce. Isn't fully forward to defend, and the ball jumps to hit his glove. Keeps it down in front of him, but it could have easily popped to short leg"
"back of a length on off stump, angling in from over the wicket, punched to mid-on"
"risky. Not particularly short, and close to off stump, but he makes room to chop it into the backward point region"
"a jaffa out of nowhere. There's a long crack running down the pitch just outside off stump, and Wagner angles it in and hits that crack on a good length. Half-forward to defend, and the ball jags away to beat him by a distance"

"full, on the stumps, keeps his front pad out of the way and clips to midwicket"
"tossed up nicely outside off, driven to short extra-cover"
"ooh, sharp turn as Rizwan makes room to cut. Spinning from quite a way outside off stump towards leg stump. Adjusts late to block into the covers"

"fuller, around off, and he pokes at this after getting really low down. Played to point"
"length, angles across Rizwan, who has a slight jab at it, before withdrawing his blade. Perhaps helped by the lack of bounce"

"length, closer to the body, and defended towards cover"
"length, angles across with the seam. Rizwan has judged this better, and leaves"
"length, better line, and <strong>he beats him</strong>! Starts around off, and then seams away a touch. Rizwan is squared up as he commits to play, and is lucky that it passes outside his bat"
"length, around off, and he defends to cover"
"length, around off, angles in, and he works it off his pads towards long leg"
"length, rises away from just outside off, and Rizwan leaves. Even he is a little rattled by the sudden bounce on this, taken really high up to his right by Watling"
"fuller, outside off, and again climbs away after passing Rizwan, who wants nothing to do with this"
"<strong>smart bowling!</strong> Wide of the crease, and gets this to slant into him, on a line just outside off. It keeps low, but doesn't attack the stumps. Rizwan is beaten by an attempted block, but crucially he survives"
"gets forward to a length ball around off, to defend"
"length, healthy carry through to Watling again, as Rizwan leaves out outside off"
"fuller length, but straying down leg, as Fawad fails to make contact with an attempted flick"
"length, around off, and defended from the crease"
"fuller, straighter, but he does well to defend this towards short midwicket"
"Boult gets a little edge, but it's kept down by Fawad! The lack of bounce perhaps helping, as he's able to play one that straightens after pitching, and putting it through the gully region"

"length, and he comes forward to defend"

"fuller, and he launches into a beautiful cover drive. Width on offer, and he is happy to take it on"
"fuller length, around off, and he edges this. Has this carried to the slips cordon? They are checking with the TV umpire, and the soft signal is <strong>not out</strong>. It's wide outside off, and Rizwan has a little swish at it, wide outside off. Looks like a bump ball, to be honest. Good take at first slip, though. Will stay not out"
"length, and jumps off from just outside off. Rizwan fends at it, and is able to place it towards point, and they can take a single"
"fuller, straighter, and he places this to the right of mid-on and goes through for a single"
"short, and he goes back to punch this along the ground towards point"
"<strong>what a ball, and how do you play that?</strong> In short, you don't. That was on a length, around off, and probably takes off from a crack. Fawad is looking to press forward to defend, and ends up needing to swiftly move out of the way"
"Southee gets this all wrong. Looks to pitch it up, but almost hits the wide popping crease outside off. Some embarrassed smiles all around"
"length, outside off, ignored"

"length, whipped away to the right of short mid-wicket, and they call each other through for a quick one"

"back of a length, in towards his body, and he defends along the ground towards forward short leg"

"length, angles across him, and he blocks close to his body"
"banged in short, and Fawad has a waft at it, but it goes through and beats Watling. Runs away to the third man boundary for four byes. That's hit a crack, one would imagine"
"length, presses forward to defend this"
"fired in quick, and strikes him on the pad as he looks to defend. Loud appeal, but definitely sliding down leg"
"short, and he cuts this hard, but cannot beat cover point"
"tossed up, outside off, turning away, and ignored"

"The pitch is still doing something every now and then. This one pitches just short of a length, angling towards off stump, and keeps a little low as Fawad defends off the back foot. Seems to jar his bat upon impact, because he shook his hand vigorously after playing it"

"fullish now, angling into middle and leg, defended to mid-on from the crease"

"slower ball, angling away into a wide line outside off. Too wide to make Rizwan play"

"back of a length, wide outside off again, left alone. Not the most aggressive tactic, this. Are New Zealand fearing a possible Pakistan win?"
"length ball close to off stump, angling in from around off stump. Gets across his stumps to defend with an open face, square on the off side"
"full, angling into off stump, defended towards mid-on. Just placed a vertical bat in the ball's path, pretty much"
"short outside off, rolls his wrists over on top of the bounce to cut. Doesn't really come on, so he hits it with less power than he wants, and more in front of square than he wants, to cover point"
"full, angling into leg stump, clipped down to long leg"
"huge appeal for lbw, and it isn't given. Williamson <strong>calls for a review</strong> straightaway. First instinct - that was going down leg. Well bowled by Jamieson, slanting it in from wide of the crease and leaving his feet frozen with his length. And wow, how wrong I was, and how wrong umpire Wayne Knights was. Rizwan is batting slightly outside his crease, but the ball keeps a little low and hits him just below the knee roll, as he gets up on his toes to defend. It's struck him just inside the line of off stump, and Hawkeye predicts the ball will strike a good chunk of middle and leg stumps. Wow. What a moment"

"bouncer over off stump, not much bounce at all. Has to crouch really low to evade it"
"shortish, keeps low, and Faheem looks to pull. Dangerous to go with a horizontal bat when the line is that close to off stump. Sneaks under the bat and hits his thigh pad. A little high to give out lbw, and it struck him outside the line too"
"back of a length close to off stump, right behind it to defend with soft hands"
"shortish, a bit of width, gets on his toes to ride the bounce and stab behind point"
"length ball angling into the stumps, presses forward and defends with a vertical bat"
"high full-toss, about thigh high, on off stump. Jabs at it in surprise, and the ball hits the sticker of his bat and drops to the floor, with Fawad dropping his bottom hand off the handle. May have been a misdelivered slower ball"
"length ball angling across to off stump, gets right behind it to defend back to the bowler"
"back of a length on off stump, defended back down the pitch"
bouncer bouncing tennis-ball style over leg stump. Ducks low to get under it
"and the short ball has ended Fawad's mighty defiance. Neil Wagner, what a bowler. Around the wicket to the left-hander, banged in short, coming to him from his blind spot outside leg stump. It isn't the best short ball Wagner's ever bowled, still down the leg side when it reaches the batsman, but the presence of those two short legs, and the sheer mental effort he's gone through, causes a failure of execution on the pull. Gloves it down the leg side to BJ Watling, and Wagner lets out a massive roar"
"bouncer over off stump, ducks under"
"back of a length close to off stump, gets on his toes, rides the bounce, and keeps it down into the off side"

"length ball angling in from wide of the crease. Past the inside edge of his defensive push to hit the pad, but he's shuffled across to get outside the line of the stump"
"back of a length outside off, shuffles across to defend square on the off side"
"digs it in short, similar ball to the one that got Fawad, outside leg stump, and he gets into a better position to swivel and pull it to the left of long leg"
"short again, the line is over the stumps now and he pulls to deep square leg. Doesn't take the single"
"bouncer, well down the leg side, left alone"
"full, down the leg side, looks to flick and misses"
"length ball angling into off stump, presses forward and blocks it back to Wagner"

"digs it in short just outside off, ducks and evades it"
"looks for the off-stump yorker, jabs the low full-toss back to the bowler"
"gone, Pakistan are seven down. Short of a length, fairly wide outside off, but Yasir can't resist having a poke at it with an angled bat. Thick outside edge, maybe the outside half of the bat face, and it goes straight to the finer of two gullies, at chest height"
"fullish, angling into off stump, defended from a half-forward press"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"back of a length, angling into off stump, defended into the on side"
"digs it in short from left-arm around, and Faheem keeps his bat and gloves away from the line and lets it hit his back. Ouch!"
"another bouncer, this one climbs much higher, ducks under it"
"wow. Wagner had two fielders back on the boundary behind square for the hook. This bouncer gets up over the shoulder, and Faheem takes it on. The man at deep backward square leg is some ten yards inside the rope, and <strong>the ball clears him</strong>. Wow."
"another bouncer, Faheem gets out of the way"
"back of a length close to off stump, steps back and across to defend towards gully"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended square on the off side."
"now Jamieson sends down the bouncer, and Abbas ducks with his bat in periscope orientation. The ball doesn't miss it by much"
"ooh, this is a difficult one. Short, and it follows Abbas with the angle, getting up over his right shoulder. Half-ducks, half-fends, closes his eyes too, and somehow the ball misses him"
"back of a length on off stump, stands tall and defends with soft hands into the off side"
"ooh, another sharply rising short ball, angling in from wide of the crease and climbing just outside off stump. Shapes to poke at it with both feet off the ground, then <strong>pulls his bat away in the nick of time</strong>"
"back of a length on off stump, blocked back down the pitch"
"bouncer just outside off, keeps his bat and gloves down and sways out of the way"
"wow. Bouncer, angling across him, and keeping low. Only a couple of feet over the crouched form of Faheem, and the stumps"
"short, gets up to stomach height outside off, pulled to deep square leg. Says no to the single"
this one climbs up to around neck height and Faheem jumps to get on top of the bounce and play it down by his feet. Impressive technique there
"Over the wicket. Short, angling into leg stump, only gets up to chest height. Lovely shot from Faheem, steps across to get outside the line and swivels to bisect square leg and deep backward square leg. That was some timing."
"edged and gone. Wagner doesn't just deal in short balls! All those earlier short balls, however, cause Faheem to defend with barely any front-foot stride. Length ball close to off stump, straightens ever so slightly off the pitch, and he feathers an edge through to Watling"
"very full outside off, and is there some late reverse on that? Who knows. Left alone"
"bouncer, climbing steeply over middle and leg. Ducks under it"
"ooh, short again, rising over leg stump, and Abbas leaves it by stepping across to the off side. Almost shaves his back"
"short ball slanting across, around chest high. Keeps his bat and gloves out of the way and leaves it alone"
"shortish, at the hip. Lifts his bat above his head and lets it hit his body"
"wide of the crease, bangs it in short, angling in over off stump. Watches it well and steps away from the line to leave it"
"bouncer, angling down leg, ducks low and gets under it"
"fullish, around off, and he <strong>jams his bat down</strong> just in time. Little inside edge, but on to the on side along the floor"
"yorker, with a hint of reverse swing, and dug out with a stride forward by Afridi"
"that's <strong>hit his helmet</strong>! Short of a length, but doesn't rise as much as expected. Afridi looks to duck inside this, but ends up feeling this right on the outside part of his helmet. Perhaps part of the grille. Mandatory concussion test being conducted now. In fact, he had turned around, and got struck around the back of the helmet"
"follows this up with the yorker, and Afridi looks to defend. Bounces on to the ground, and then short gully dives to pick it up"
"length, around off, and he defends with a better part of the bat now. Played to short point again"
"length, outside off, and Afridi plays inside the line of this"
"back of a length, around off, and Abbas backs away a touch, and then offers a dead bat to it"

"length, around off, turning away, and Abbas goes back to defend with a dead bat"
"tossed up, straighter to the bat, and he stretches out to defend"
"this one grips, and turns across the face of the bat. Well flighted, drifts in a touch, and he misses out as he looks to defend"
"flatter, outside off, and he goes back to defend"
"traps him in the crease with a slider! <strong>Given out leg before</strong>, and reviewed immediately. More in hope than anything else. Abbas made the mistake of playing back to this again, and it was just going on with the angle across the line, and he played outside the line. It is umpire's call, as it looked at first glance. Pakistan have just one wicket now to protect a 0-0 scoreline going into Christchurch"
"tossed up, outside off, and Naseem leaves this"
"length, straighter into him, and he is able to defend this well"
"length, outside off, and he carts this through covers, after backing away a bit to make room"
"length, seams away from Shaheen as he shapes to defend"
"length, just outside off, and it keeps low. Shaheen does well to keep his bat low as he sees it through"
"back of a length, and he runs it towards gully. A diving stop by Tim Southee to his left prevents any thoughts of getting a single"
"fuller, and he drives this past point. Not a lot of movement of the feet, but he has done well to get enough bat on it. Perhaps wanted to play it straighter"
"fuller, straighter, and he drives it back to the bowler"
"tossed up around off, and he stretches forward to defend"
"flighted closer to leg, and he defends well"
"straighter, and he gets behind this to defend"
"<strong>ooh, that's close!</strong> Tossed up, slower, loops in and then spits away from the surface. Agonisingly close to the outside edge, as Watling collects"
"outside off, a touch quicker, and he shoulders arms"
"length, and he stretches forward to defend"
"short, outside off, and Shaheen does well to take his gloves away from this"
"short, and he can duck his way out of this"
"back of a length, comes back in and he defends from the crease"
"length, around middle, and he defends well"
"length, and he presses forward to defend this"
"yorker, was fired into middle and leg, and he does well to block this away"
"length, but way down the leg side"
"short ball, and he ducks under this. Keeps the periscope up, but it shapes down the leg side anyway"
"wide of the crease, cross-seamer going in from outside off. Naseem jams his bat down a tad late, and gets it to run towards first slip. Watling stops it low to his right"
"fuller, and straighter, and he gets right behind the line of this to defend it"
"short, angles across his body, and he ducks under this"
"length, down the leg side, and he has a little swish, but misses"
"length, outside off, and he leaves this"
"touch fuller, wide of off, and almost tempts Afridi into having a go, but he resists and lets this pass"
"length, around off, and he gets behind the line to defend"
"dug in a bit short, and he can weave out of the way comfortably"
"length, around off, and he defends comfortably"
"yorker, and he jams his bat down in time to keep this out"
"short, and he ducks under this"
"length, gets nicely behind the line of this to defend"
"wide outside off, and he drops his wrists to let this pass"
"length, straighter line, but he can get behind the line of this to defend"
"yorker, and he does well to get a bit of bat on to this. Not a perfect technique, but who cares at this point? Just falls away on the off side, and gets it to squirt wide of forward short leg. They pinch a single to square leg"
"length, outside off from around the wicket, and he can leave this"
"length, outside off, angling further away, and he leaves"
"straighter, on the pads, and he is able to nudge this off his thigh pad towards fine leg"
"short, outside off, and he leaves. Does hang his bat out initially, but then takes it away from the rising ball"
"short, and he hangs back to drop it with a dead bat"
"slower, around off, and because Shaheen is rooted to the crease, he can watch it through and defend this one"
"length, outside off, a bit of late swing back in, but he can leave"
"tossed up, wide outside off, turning away, and he can leave"
"fired in quick, and Naseem looks to defend. Strikes his pad, and they have gone for a leg before appeal. Not given, but <strong>New Zealand review</strong>, as they might as well. There's no bat involved in this, which would have been greater trouble, but the forward stretch was a giveaway. It's umpire's call, which keeps it not out"
"<strong>ooh, what a finish!</strong> He has tossed this one up around off, and Naseem seems to have been caught in two minds about whether to attack this or defend, and ends up playing a drive back towards the bowler. Almost clears Santner, but the bowler times his jump to perfection and plucks this out. Inspired captaincy by Kane Williamson to bring back the spinner when he saw his pace spearheads negotiated comfortably"
