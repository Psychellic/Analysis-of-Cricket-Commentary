"turn straight away. Smith is surprised by the amount that is on offer as a ball pitches on a good length outside off and rips away like the wicketkeeper has a magnet, well past the middle of his bat. The outside edge wanders past first slip as well"
"cross-bat shots work on a turning pitch, and they work even better for a man of Smith's power. Sees the good length ball on middle and sweeps it away over short fine leg"
"slider onto middle and leg, Smith flicks it through to deep midwicket"
"lovely bowling. He senses McCullum wanting to go, then sees him making room outside leg, and so slows it right down. The batsman swings hard, and early, and inside edges onto his pad. Brave bowling"
nudges it through midwicket
plonks his front leg forward and defends a fuller delivery on middle
"super ball, super catch. This is Test match cricket barging into T20s, not taking no for an answer. A good length ball seams away off the pitch and catches the batsman in no-man's land. McCullum pokes his bat at it, without moving his feet, following the direction of the seam movement. And for that trouble, he gets a thick outside edge, which Pant tracks down with a big dive to his right."
"right up there on off stump, Raina nudges a 139 kph delivery to short midwicket and thinks about a single. He comes out looking for it and so his partner responds. But eventually everyone realises Shahbaz Nadeem has swooped in on the ball and he nails a direct throw as well. Now has Smith made his ground after being sent back? This is so close. Ridiculously close. The zing bails light up about 1 mm before Smith's bat crosses the line. And that is a pretty thick crease line. Should he have dived? This is going to be a big call from third umpire Nandan. And he says to Smith, 'yeeerrrrr outta heeeere'"
"full on off stump, pushes to mid-on"
"taking so many risks so early in the innings, just to exploit the fielding restrictions. Raina is trapped by the dire state of his team, and he tries to take it out on a good length ball on off stump, Looks to loft it over extra cover, but the pace on bounce of Rabada means it goes off the splice of the bat. Samuels backtracks, dives, sticks out a hand, and puts in a grand effort. But it still eludes him"
bunts a full and wide delivery to mid-off
"<b>dropped by the slip fielder</b>. Shreyas Iyer juggles, once, twice, and the third time it plops out. Should really have taken it. All of that chaos is caused by a short ball from Rabada, rising up to Raina's right shoulder. He looks to hook, gloves it over the keeper, and it is the easiest catches anyone can hope for. Lobbing up, looping down. And Iyer fluffs it up"
"good length ball on off stump, Raina tries to smoke it over midwicket, inside edges onto pad"
finally he tries a proper cricket shot and see what happens? Takes a shortish delivery on leg stump and flicks it over square leg
and now the ball lobs up in the region of square leg - from where the fielder was pulled out - and Raina secures a single despite hopping about against Cummins' pace
"back of a length on off stump, defends"
"beautiful bowling. And at 144 kph, there is precious little time for Karthik to react. He sees a good length ball, he knows it is still the Powerplay and he has to hit out. Goes for the drive and is comfortably beaten"
targets the stumps - and the inswing is no help to the batsman - Karthik tries to punch down the ground and instead gets an inside edge past short fine leg's left
"oooh what a welcome. Shami slides a length ball in at leg stump. Raina clears the front leg, swings at it and picks this up cleanly over the midwicket boundary with an old-fashioned slog"
"gets a bouncer next up, but the strategy is the same. He backs away this time after a slight shimmy down the track and lifts this cut shot over cover point"
"offcutter, dropped short outside off stump. Forces him to check the cut. He ends up pushing it to point, away from the body"
"sweet. Not often that Shami is picked on as the weak link, but Raina has made it clear. Makes room again and lifts this full ball wide of mid-off from a middle stump line"
"bouncer at middle stump climbs up nicely, and the only movement he can make this time is to sway away from it"
"backs away again, and tries to clobber this on the up through the off side. But it's an offcutter and he's through it early. Trickles past his partner at the other end after the bat turns in his hands"
"this is a low full toss at leg stump that Raina might have sent into the stands on another day. Today, Rabada is too fast for him as he clears the front leg and slogs at this. Gets it quite high on the bat and it only just clears midwicket. Mid-on cleans up"
"bowls this full at off stump and Raina can't connect once more. Looks to lift this through the line over mid-off and gets it off the bottom of the bat. Just clears mid-off this time, who gives chase and pulls back with a slide"
"back of a length at middle stump, finally gets bat on this one as he goes through the line and lifts this on the up over the long-on boundary"
"full at off stump, watches it closely and turns it across the line to deep square leg"
"back of a length at off stump, defended with an open face to point"
"good length ball in the corridor, Karthik looks to drive on the up and is beaten on the outside edge"
"a slower ball outside off, pushed to mid-off for a single"
"superb shot. Overpitched from Cummins at 148 kph, Karthik shimmies down and nails a straoight drive past mid-off's right. Full face of the bat, lovely"
another one in Karthik's half. Crisply driven towards cover for a single. All timing
"a slower ball outside off, Raina opens the bat face and guides down to third man for a single. Nicely played."
"really well played again. Good length delivery outside off, Karthik opens the bat face to guide down to third man. Deft"
"full, straight and Raina picks him off. Cummins' 145 kph is too straight and Raina picks him off through backward square leg. Great stroke. Intentionally played it late to hit that behind square"
"charges out of his crease, and gets a ball that is ripe for the off drive. This time, though, Karthik mistimes the shot and has to settle for a single"
clears his front leg to try and hoist a back of a length ball over midwicket. A good old agricultural heave. The ball thuds into the back leg of Raina
"<b>dropped</b> by midwicket. A seriously well hit ball comes right at him, over his head, and Samuels can't hold on. The force is such that it just thuds into his hands before he is ready and even propels him back on his backside"
"reads the slower ball better, and having made room on the leg side, guides it through cover for the fifty partnership."
swivels on his back foot as he pulls a short ball on middle to long leg
drums a full delivery on off stump past the bowler's left to long-on
"flatter delivery outside off, Raina understands the trajectory, going back and cutting it through cover"
"goes for the sweep against a length ball on leg stump, but he picks out short fine leg"
punches a flatter delivery on off stump to long-on
"slider out of the front of the hand, and Raina drives it through to long-on"
"slashes it away, and he has placed this to perfection. The width affords him the chance to thread a needle. Makes room and smears the ball in front of backward point and behind deep cover point"
"the is leggie spooked. Karthik's ability to rapidly come down the track makes Mishra bowl a rank long hop, and it is nailed over midwicket with considerable disdain. The kind you reserve for someone speaking ill of you behind your back"
"induces a false shot straight away. A good length ball, spinning away from the left-hander, sticks in the pitch and comes on a lot later than Raina expects. He lofts the ball, and is lucky long-off is on the boundary. If he had been inside the circle, this was out"
""
"sweetly lifts a flighted delivery outside off, while also making sure it is wide of Anderson at long-off"
"good length ball on middle, Raina protects his stumps"
"lovely batting, as Raina waits on the quicker delivery - which ends up being a long hop - and cuts it to point. Samson is the man there, and he is hurrying to stop it. He didn't need the ball hitting the turf and changing direction. Leaps to his right, with one hand stuck out and stops the ball well"
secures a half-century in a very important game for the team he leads. Raina in the IPL is money in the bank. Flicks through midwicket
"quicker delivery off the front of the hand - but since it is short and wide - Karthik has everything he needs to cut the ball. Then he gets a bonus - the fielder, Samson, misfields on the boundary"
"flatter delivery outside off, Karthik pulls to long-on"
"loops it up on off stump, he drives to long-on"
lovely placement as he leans over the tossed up delivery on middle and nudges it through midwicket. Two men in the deep race up towards the ball and make Raina think twice
"turns it through to deep midwicket, from where Samson races in, picks up the ball and sends it through very quickly, not even worrying about maintaining his balance while he releases because he wants to stop them taking a second. Unable to do so, but good effort"
stands up tall and drills a shortish delivery outside of to long-off
launches it into the stands! This is Raina's stroke. The old down-one-one-knee slog sweep over cow corner. Few players connect as well as he can
leaps back against the short ball - coming at him from around the wicket - and pulls strongly to deep midwicket
"sooo close. Samuels hoodwinks the batsman by not turning the ball as much as expected. Karthik defends inside the line of an offbreak and is lucky not to nick to the keeper. Pant doesn't collect it cleanly though, so maybe that wouldn't have been so bad"
drives it to long-on
picks a short ball outside off and cuts it to deep point
"backs himself to beat long-on and he does. Loves getting length balls because he can get under them. From there on it is all about timing and Raina does have that gift. Hits it straight, forcing Rabada to move to his right, and just marvel at the arc of the ball"
"almost leaks a run, after doing so much good work, tying Karthik down to the crease with a good length ball on middle. The ball is coming back to him, but he seems to kick it away towards mid-on. Has to hare after it and somehow prevents the single"
"just enough distance. He sees a short ball, rocks back and across on off stump and pulls it over midwicket. Muscles it over. <b>Brings up Lions' first century stand in this IPL</b>"
"from the top draw! He steps down the track and launches a length ball over wide long-off. Sublime shot, both in his footwork and the execution"
"tossed up delivery on off stump, he drives inside out through cover"
"sweeps, sweeps hard, sweeps well. Picks the gap at midwicket, keeping the ball to the left of the boundary rider. Class batting. Bad bowling"
stands tall and punches the left-armer's legspinner down to long-off
scythes a back of a length ball to deep point
"length ball, sliding down leg, Karthik steps down to flick it to the fine leg boundary but doesn't make connection. First extra of the innings"
"picks the slow short ball and smashes it to deep point. As he gets to the non-strikers end, Karthk relays to the umpire a concern he has with something behind the sight screen"
"walks at the bowler, who then takes all the pace off the ball, and hits the deck as well outside off. Raina lashes it over cover"
pulls into the crowd at long leg. Poor line with his fine leg up. Poor length with his fine leg up. Poor everything when you put the ball down to words - short and outside leg.
"good length ball on leg stump, nudges it to midwicket. He sets off for a run, and might well have been run out had Samson not misfielded"
"back of a length and down leg, Karthik looks for the pull over short fine leg and misses out"
a gentle nudge to the left of square leg brings up a well made fifty for Karthik. Came in with his team wobbling and has played a little gem alongside his captain
"the offcutters won't work if you plop them as a half-volley with plenty of width. Even so, the way Karthik comes forward and spears it over cover is all class"
"looks for the blockhole this time, just on off stump, Karthik guides it to backward point and sets off for a single. Considering Daredevils' fielding, his thought process probably can't be faulted. But Rabada chooses a fine time to step above the amateurish display by his team so far as he hunts down the ball with purpose and speed. Karthik realises all that and says no to his captain. But it's too late. It's a direct hit at the bowler's end. Raina's gone"
"length ball on middle, he turns it through midwicket, and into a place where there is no one around to stop the ball"
"he's carved it over point. So flat. So good. Width on offer, slow pace on offer, both of which he reads early. Sets up a strong base and throws his hands at the ball. Places it well behind where the fielder is"
"full on leg stump, whips it to deep square leg"
"mid-on is up and all he has to do is lift a full delivery, aiming to cramp him on leg stump, right back past the bowler. Clever batting. Gun batting, at exactly the time Lions need it, right after their captain has fallen"
"this is a stunning catch. It's just bleeping unbelievable. Simply in the way he has tracked the ball perfectly and times the jump even better. Takes the catch with his strong hand - the left hand. He comes into play because Cummins bowls a slower, full delivery on off stump and Karthik mistimes his loft. He is looking to clear mid-off, but Anderson moves back and to his right, eyes on the ball all the way, and then he propels off his feet and back behind him, stretching a hand out and coming up with a superbly judged grab"
"fuller delivery on off stump, finds a single off a block to mid-off"
leaps off his feet to nudge a shortish delivery towards midwicket and finds a second run too because he hit the ball rather gently and the men in that region were in the deep
"isn't ready for the shortish offcutter, tying him down for room. Finch tries to flick, but gets hit on the body"
"it's Anderson agaaaaain - but the ball lobs him, comfortably. Finch likes driving through the off side, and Cummins knows it. That's why the length is short and the line is on leg stump. The batsman tries to one-up the plan by making room and carving it over mid-off. Mis-hit for a couple"
"into the body again, fast and with no room to exploit, Finch tries a flick and has to settle for a legbye to short third man"
"full and wide outside off, Finch reaches out, but he needs to reach out so much that he toe-ends the cover drive"
"legcutter, pitching short and outside off, Kishan swings hard, but he can only get a single to long-on"
"long-off tries, running to his left, having to dive forward, this is not going to be easy, and Iyer, after putting in a good effort, <b>drops</b> his second catch. It's a harsh call because the ball is dying on him. Finch survives to hit another lofted drive, if he so pleases"
wanders across on off stump to try and heave a length ball angling across him. Misses altogether
"short ball outside off, he pulls to deep midwicket"
"looks to sweep a full ball sliding down leg. No contact, and the umpire doles out the penalty. Harsh on Anderson, but it's the right call"
"back of a length and outside off, cuts to deep point"
too quick for Kishan - 146 kph would be too quick for a lot of people. And so a good length ball angled across the left-hander goes unpunished
heaves at another 146 kph delivery - full and on middle this time - to long leg off an inside edge
"whips a full delivery on middle to long leg and he gets across for the second run too. Good desperation from Finch, putting in the dive"
"shortish and outside off, bunts it to cover."
"does him for lack of pace this time as Finch is stepping away to a short delivery on middle, dialls up the pull shot too early, tries to adjust the bat-swing. Fails"
"rapid, very rapid, and Finch, half trying to duck for cover, gets a top edge over the short fine leg. The batsmen are all a very unbiased lot. They take everything they can get"
"has gone straight up, long-on is in focus and Iyer takes it cleanly. His first catch in three tries. So the offcutter does Kishan, who sees the ball hitting the deck and moving across him and immediately goes for the slog. The lack of pace though makes sure the ball goes higher instead of longer and Iyer running in completes a good high grab"
"shortish and outside off, swings it away to deep midwicket"
"short, slow and outside off, Jadeja reads it well and dabs it to deep third man"
"149 kph, beats him for pace - and the length isn't all that bad either. Yorker outside off. Finch looks to steer it behind point and is unable to do so"
"takes a slower bouncer from outside off and hammers it to deep square leg. Beautiful strike, all of it possible because he is able to get on top of the bounce"
"super bowling from Cummins! Wraps up his spell with a wide yorker, which is about the perfect delivery you can bowl to a batsman making room outside leg. For kicks, he gets to watch Finch crawl around in the crease, trying desperately to reach the ball"
"full toss at 146 kph, just outside off, guided straight to cover"
"mid-off is up and he gets the perfect ball to exploit that field placing. It's full, it's wide, it's launched over the fielder. And he does it all with an iffy left hand. Takes it off the bat to avoid feeling the jarring"
"<b>a screamer from Pant</b>. But we'll need the third umpire's confirmation. So let's talk about the problems the wicketkeeper faced. He has to run almost three-fourth the distance to the fine leg boundary. He has to deal with a swirling delivery, always moving away from him, and towards Shahbaz Nadeem, who is only feet away from him. He shouts he wants the catch, he dives forward as the ball comes down, and it sticks in both hands. Makes sure to keep it away from the turf as well and the third umpire agrees. Oh, did I mention all of this happened because Finch is hurried on a hook and top edged it?"
"full and outside off, pushes it to the bowler. All well there, but Rabada tries to flick it to the stumps, and gives away an overthrow. Why Delhi? Why?"
"back of a length slower ball, and Faulkner, trying to cut it, misses out"
"back of a length on off stump, blocks it towards cover for a quick single"
"full and outside off, Faulkner tries to reach it but is unable to. The umpire assumes that to be reason to call a wide. But the ball passes inside the wide line when it passes the bat"
"heaves a length ball, from outside off, all the way into the hands of Brathwaite, the substitute fielder, at deep square leg. Slower ball doesn't allow the timing Faulkner was looking for"
"lovely batting. He knows the slower ball is coming, he knows fine leg is up, so he lies in wait. Nails a pull past the man inside the circle, but Samson at the square leg boundary puts in a fine effort"
"full and outside off, belts it to long-on"
"full and outside off, he spears it to deep cover"
gets the ball he wants and then pummels it. It's length. It's at top pace. It's on off stump and it's been given all the necessary travel documents to take flight
"this is the slower ball, but Jadeja picks it and picks the bones off it. Came off the back of the hand, stuck in the pitch, did everything to fool panic-stricken finishers. But Jadeja is not that kind. He just calmly waits for the ball to arrive and pulls it over deep midwicket"
"<b>loads of zip off the surface</B>. Hits the deck at 140 kph, angling across the right-hander. Samson goes for the on-the-up drive and is left behind by a peach of a delivery. Too good for the wicketkeeper as well"
"back of a length on off stump, defends towards cover. Again, massive bounce for Sangwan. Rises up past the bat and hits the bottom glove of Nair"
makes his own width because he has all the pace he would ever need and carves a shortish delivery past backward point
backs away again but a length ball travelling towards the slip beats him
overdoes the angle across the right-hander and the full delivery outside off sails over the flashing bat and into the keeper's gloves
"picks it up and deposits it to the square leg boundary. Sublime shot, made by the fact he moves across onto off stump, and then doesn't overhit the ball. Just concentrates on lifting it over square leg"
"full and wide outside off, chops it into the covers for a quick single"
"full outside off, Karun gets across, looking to ramp the ball over short fine leg. But misses. Struck on the pad but outside the line of off. That isn't his strength"
"140 kph, good length delivery outside off, holds its line. Samson is beaten on the outside edge. Thampi the only man asking for a wicket"
"139 kph, good length delivery, slightly closer to off. Samson walks into the shot, works to wide mid-on for a single. Samson sticking to his repertoire of strokes, the right way to go"
"132kph, pacey bouncer. Karun backs away, Thampi follows him. Karun misses his pull, harried by pace"
"low full toss down leg, flicked through backward square leg for a couple. Ishan Kishan saves two with a dive. A splendid fielder he is"
"140 kph, <strong>another big appeal</strong>. No, says umpire Erasmus. There was a noise. What was it off though? A quick delivery down leg. Karun misses a slog. Did it flick the leg stump? Nowhere close to leg stump. <b>It clipped the inside edge</b>. Another wrong decision, not a howler though. if you don't hear it, you can't give it"
"picks the length so early does Samson and weeeeee, the ball goes over square leg. All timing. A length delivery on leg, he sees the length early and a swat gives him six. Lovely"
"changes the line. Pushes it fuller and a lot wider outside off, a thick outside edge to third man"
"good length delivery outside off, carved to deep backward point. Interesting position"
"full and straight, flicked wide of mid-on for a run. This is good batting. Singles off all other balls means it will be a good over"
"gone this time. A short delivery on leg, Karun looks to bail out of the stroke but bails out late. He then thinks he has enough time to ramp the ball over short third man. All he does it get an edge through to Karthik. Not a bad stroke with 209 to chase, but execution not too great"
"strays down leg, off the pad towards square leg. A leg bye"
"superb strike. A short, slow ball outside off. Pant gets underneath the length and slaps the ball over cover for six. Another terrific stroke. Didn't bother keeping it down. Impeccable timing"
full and very wide outside off. Pant sees width and throws his hands at that. Too wide though. Called
"141 kph, on a length outside off, Pant flicks into his own pad. It bobbles up towards the keeper"
"good single. Good length outside off, pushed to mid-off. With all the fielders on the circle, an easy single"
"a yorker outside off, jammed away towards third man. Another good stroke, can't play dot balls"
"a slower ball on off, pushed to mid-off for a single"
six more. Splendid batting this from Samson. Thampi strays straight and Samson picks him off. Behind square and clears the boundary. Just relying on timing
"six more. Daredevils' daredevilry. Back of a length down leg. Pant picks him off, flicks his wrists to get it behind square. No care in the world to keep it down"
"six more. No, not the right length. Full outside off, slogged away over long-on for another six. Clean striking this."
"good length delivery outside off, comes back in. But Pant knows what he wants to do all along, he laces a late cut past short third man. Sensational batting"
"bludgeoned, but along the ground. Full outside off, drilled to mid-off"
"tailing back in. Full outside off, hit down to long-on for a run"
"full and straight, skewed to midwicket. Loud call of 'noo'"
"full and straight, worked away through backward square leg for a couple. Played that late"
"completely deceived Pant. A back of the hand slower ball outside off, the ball moves away so it beats the bat."
"another slower ball outside off, hammered to extra cover for a dot."
"another slower ball outside off, played down to short third man for a single. Nicely done"
"113 kph, four back of the hand slower balls on the bouncer. Comes back in, an inside edge into the pad for a run"
"another slower ball outside off, guided down to third man for a single. A pretty good Powerplay for Daredevils."
"short and wide from Raina, sliced to the sweeper cover"
"the offspinner bowling to the right-hander. Flat on off, Samson gets underneath the length and swats a heave over midwicket. if it was in his half, we was always going to go"
"flat outside off, dabbed to short third man for a single"
"short and wide, carved to deep point for another single."
"flat and wide, hit away to deep cover"
"a good finish. Yorker outside off, goes underneath Pant's bat"
"flat and wide outside off, played back towards the bowler. Doesn't want to get too straight"
"a low full toss, hit to long-off."
"a googly on leg, clipped towards midwicket. A quick single"
"flat and wide outside off, tapped down to short third man for a single."
"yep, it will be Pant attacking the leggie. A googly outside off, Pant picks the variation, gets low and boom. Straight over the bowler's head for six"
"a googly down leg, pulled to deep square leg. Picking length so quickly"
"flat on off, scythed towards cover"
"shortish and slow on off, pushed to cover. Another dot."
"a naughty misfield from Smith on the sweeper cover boundary. Flat and wide outside off, pant nails a powerful punch from the back foot. Smith gets across to his left but lets the ball through"
"and then McCullum pulls it back. Flat and wide, hammered wide of long-on where McCullum puts in a dive to his left to save two"
"cut behind point for a couple. Short and wide from Raina, sliced behind point"
"Raina drops short and Pant says thanks. Sits back, waits and waits and waits and then pulls merrily away over midwicket for a huge six to get to his fifty. A blitzy knock."
"tripe. That's plain filth. Short down leg, Samson gets underneath the length and whacks a pull over square leg for another six."
"McCullum saves two more. Full on middle and leg, hit away towards long-on. Superman Baz gets across to his left to save two with a sensational effort"
"goes again. Six more. Tossed up outside off, Samson eases underneath the length and hits a straight six. On short boundaries, it's six easy runs"
"flat and wide, pushed to cover"
"pushed through outside off, carved away towards short third man for a single"
"overpitched outside off, played back awkwardly"
"picks it up early. Full down leg, flicked towards backward square leg. Kishan runs in, looking for the catch, the ball bounces in front and spins away. Four."
"six more. Slower on middle and leg, slogged away over midwicket. High in the air. So much elevation. Out on most grounds. Not this."
"full down leg, off the pad towards point."
"short slow delivery on off, worked to deep midwicket. Knows what he wants all along"
"a slower delivery down leg, Pant picks the slower ball, picks the length early and then gives it a good thwack and it goes waaaaay back over square leg. Exceptional ball-striking"
"six more. Is this game done already? Faulkner pitches this on a length, full on off and middle. It's right in the slot and Pant lays into it. Goes over long-on. He's hitting 'em, not just timing"
"six more. This is the top tier. What is happening to batting in cricket. Full outside off, Samson's loft goes 99 metres long, over long-on."
"six more. Four on the bounce. Flat and wide outside off, Samson gets underneath the length and lofts the ball over cover for another six. Great hitting, he's picking his slots"
"flat outside off, tapped towards point"
"an adrenaline rush. Flat outside off, flat-batted to long-off. Not quite timed. A cruise of a chase this"
"short down off and middle, pulled to long-on"
"flat and wide, carved towards point. Jakati watches on as the ball passes him, resulting in a couple of expletives being hurled at him by Jadeja. Two more nonetheless"
"Dwayne Smith's introduction doesn't matter. Full down leg, flicked through square leg for four. Put that in front of square"
"a slower ball down leg, pulled to deep square leg for a single."
"good decision. Sliding down leg, it looked. A yorker on leg, Samson misses a flick and is struck in front of leg. The ball was tailing back in."
"a low full toss, swatted to long-off"
"slower ball outside off, guided towards backward point for a single"
"four more. Looking for the yorker but misses his length by a long way, swatted away behind square for another boundary. Yikes, they keep coming. Pant and Samson on fire"
"flat and wide, slapped to wide long-off for a couple more."
"and taken. Flat outside off, Samson can't hold himself back. It wasn't the worst shot considering the net run-rate factor. Samson looks to go over cover but the ball spins a touch, it skews off the outside half and lands in Faulkner's hands, running in from long-off. Phew, what an effort"
"Pant doesn't care. It's six more. Weeeeeeee. Into the 90s. Flat outside off, Pant gets underneath it again and slugs it away over long-on."
"onto 97. Take a bow. This isn't slogging. Jadeja is the world's best Test bowler. Flat outside off, Pant hammers a slap over cover"
"flat and wide, patted towards point. Boooo"
"fired in outside off, mis-timed back to the bowler. Wrong shot selection finally. Looked to pull instead of hit over cover"
strays down leg for a wide
"on a length on off, worked to midwicket. Two mistakes in a row from Pant. A long run there, was unsighted because of the angle."
nicely clipped away to long-on for a single.
"oh no. Pant edges behind. Gone on 97. A big nick. He is distraught, Raina gives him a couple of pats of appreciation. Full outside off, Pant wants to go straight but his big slog results in a thick outside edge. A collective moan as the umpire's finger went up. There was power, there was class, there was touch. Sensational. Maybe fatigue?"
"good length outside off, left alone."
"full delivery outside off, chipped over cover for a couple. Their intent quite clear, to get that net run-rate up"
"full and wide from Thampi, driven to the sweeper cover"
"good length on middle and leg, prodded away towards cover"
"definitely reversing now. Full delivery outside off, the ball seams back in and almost clips off stump"
"a slower ball outside off, 116 kph. Goes underneath Corey's swing"
"full delivery outside off, mis-timed drive to long-on."
"angled away outside off, more movement. Beats the bat."
"that clears mid-off. Slower ball outside off, lofts the ball over long-off. Simple basics, the fielder is in. The length is full. So Iyer goes over him"
"full and wide outside off, swatted to long-off"
"shortish delivery outside off, Iyer can't connect with his attempted ramp over third man"
"full, straight, tailing back in. Worked past square leg"
"another six. Full and straight, Anderson gets underneath the length and lifts the ball easily over backward square leg for six. All power. Hardly got enough on that"
drifts down leg for a wide
"short and wide, slapped down to long-off for a run"
"another six. Full and straight, looking for the stumps - lbw or bowled - but Iyer gets across and flicks the ball merrily over deep square leg for six"
"full down leg, off the pad to square leg for a leg bye"
"full on the pads, off it to short fine leg for a single"
"slow down leg, wide called"
"and sealed with a six. A full delivery and straight, Anderson gets underneath that and sends it soaring over long-on"
