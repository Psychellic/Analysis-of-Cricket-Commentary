"short of a length and wide outside off, slight shape in. But not enough to make him play"
"length ball wide outside off, left alone"
"<b>there's a sound</b> but no appeals. Full and just outside off. Looks like this goes straight on off the pitch after coming in. Gayle wants to drive for that trajectory and is beaten. Slammed the bat into the turf, it appears"
"<b>appeal</b> for lbw, turned down. Length ball swinging in from middle stump as he looks to defend. Slams him in front of leg"
"inswinger from a length, jabbed to mid-on with the angle"
short of a length and climbing away from off stump. Hangs the bat out and is beaten on the outside edge
"length ball wide outside off, zips past the outside edge as he swishes at this"
"short of a length in the corridor, 148kph, left alone for the angle"
<b>off the inside edge</B> but sprints to the square leg boundary. Length ball and he backs away and has a swing at this. Thick inside edge
"short and in the corridor, defended to point's right"
"length ball wide outside off, left alone"
"<b>middles this one.</b> Short of a length on middle stump, half a stride forward before swinging his arms across the line of this and getting it past midwicket"
"<b>clears the long-on boundary.</b> That looked like it was off the low part of the bat. Yes, it was. Length ball wide outside off and he dragged it across, but it went high and certainly had enough power"
"short of a length just outside off, opens the face and runs it to third man's left"
short and in at off stump. Allows it to come on and opens the face to get it to third man
"length ball just outside off, solidly behind the line to punch to extra cover"

"length on off stump, punched on the rise to mid-off"
"length and in at off stump, sliced on the rise to point"
"length outside off, too early on the drive. Wants to go through cover on the rise, but this ends up at midwicket off the inside half"
"<b>did that carry?</b> No, falls short of Moeen at mid-off. Length outside off, tries to punch this over the infield on the up, but it's come off the toe-end and dipped as the fielder slides to his right to get his body behind it"
"bouncer across the corridor, 146kph. Backs away and shapes to pull. But decides to let it go"
"<b>lifts it over mid-on</b> to take four. This was short and at the body. Didn't have room, but the hands were sufficiently under this as he lifted it on the rise"
"full and down leg side, shifts his weight into the off side to make room and clips this behind square on the leg side. Fine leg is in, so no one stopping this"
"<b>checks his shot</B> but he's safe and this is past mid-on's dive. Overpitched on leg stump and he wanted to drive. Once again, he's through it early and withdraws the bottom hand so it doesn't chip up to that fielder. He succeeds"

short of a length and into the pads. Poked into the leg side with soft hands
"length on leg stump, tapped to midwicket off the back foot"
"<b>dropped</b> at extra cover by a diving AB de Villiers. Tough chance. Once again Rahul doesn't connect on the drive. Happened a few times that his attempts have come off the toe-end. Is this pitch slower than it looks? This is at a length outside off, he wants to drive wide of mid-off. It lobs gently in that direction and AB's dive to the right is in vain"
"short of a length just outside off, backs away and hammers it, flat-batted, over mid-off"
"<b>gets it over long-on.</b> There's a plan there, but Gayle has beaten it. Just. Short and into his body. He slices it with an attempted pull. Stoinis is back there, but he watches it clear the fence"
"<b>through the covers.</b> Oh boy, looks like another long night for Siraj. Looks nervous already - third type of ball already. This is a slower one. It's short of a length and gives him time to back away and slap it"
"<b>beats the edge.</B> Length ball across the corridor. Pokes at it, beaten"
<b>buh bye!</b> The plan is not working. Siraj is not getting the short balls to rise enough. Gayle picks this one from waist height and deposits it 94 metres into the leg side with a pull
"<b>past short fine.</b> Length on leg stump, step into the leg side and whipped between keeper and that fielder"
"<b>shot!</b> Sends the ball sailing straight to welcome RCB's best bowler. Full on off, gets the front leg out, holds his shape, launches it straight with the full face offered"
"<b>gets him!</b> Chahal, calm, calculated. Doesn't even celebrate the wicket beyond just pumping his fist. Length ball, dipping at an off stump line. Rahul steps out, is beaten in flight, and loses his shape this time. Spins past his edge and he's stumped"

"slider, short of a length at off stump. Defended off the back foot"

"<b>and Chahal brings his own class in response!</b> Superb, superb ball. The batsman doesn't know what he's just been dealt. Length ball, dipping into a short of a length on a middle stump line, squares him up completely and takes the top of off stump. Mayank is on the back foot looking to close the face on this and he is dumbfounded. Superb, just superb from Chahal. Two wickets immediately after being hit for sixes. There's a reason he's the best legspinner in limited-overs cricket right now"

"<strong>GONE THIS TIME!</strong> Sharp, short ball in response, and Khan looks to swing this away, but nicks it on the way through to Patel. Catches a bit of glove, and Patel takes a good catch away to his left"

"short ball, lifting into Gayle as he moves away and tries to create some room for himself. That was <em>brisk</em>, as it seems to brush a bit of his shirt and go through to Patel"

"slower ball, full and angles across Gayle again. He leaves this one, just like the previous one, but this time there's no wide called"
"short, and he goes back and slaps this one down the pitch. Takes a deflection off non-striker Mandeep and goes towards cover"
"full ball, and he looks to drop-kick this towards midwicket. An inside edge on to his pads, and there's a stifled appeal from Saini. More importantly, a dot ball!"

"<strong>he finishes at 99 not out!</strong> Near-perfect execution of the wide yorker from Siraj, but Gayle gets some bat on it and sends it flying towards backward point. It bounces on the way, though, and Gayle walks off with a wry grin. <b>Well batted, boss!</b>"

length and just outside off. Dropped to point's left off the inside half

It was fast from Shami, faster off Kohli's bat as he looked for the deep midwicket fence, but M Ashwin was about 10-15 yards inside.
