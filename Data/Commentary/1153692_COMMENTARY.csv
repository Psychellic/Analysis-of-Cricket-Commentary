"<b>oh that is plumb.</b> Certainly on first look. There's no doubt, however, about the quality of this shot. Poor from Munro. Has dipped into a <strike>reverse-swat</strike> switch-hit very early. It's short and spinning in at middle stump. He's swishing awkwardly in the end, legs stretched either side. Looks like that hit him on the stomach. He's in front of middle and Taylor says no the review"

"beats him with one that drifts away. Umpire wants to check if the back foot was in the air when Dhoni whipped the bails off. By Dhoni's standards, it was no more than a polite appeal. It was definitely in the air, but the point to note is if it was grounded when the LEDs flashed when Dhoni whipped the bails off. Well, well, well. It comes back as out. Taylor has been done in by absolute fractions here. New Zealand in further trouble."

"sharp turn that beats his prod. Full ball, was unsure whether to play forward or back"
fetches the sweep from outside off to fine leg
"gets into a tangle and gone! This is bowled much faster from Kuldeep, Latham looks to play a premeditated sweep but realises this is fast and nearly yorks him, so tries to change his sweep to a block, but by then it's too late. He's hit on the back leg and Nigel Llong raised the finger even before Kuldeep could belt out a full appeal."
"chipped back, just eludes Kuldeep as he dived to his left. De Grandhomme didn't get to the pitch but looked to belt this through. <strong>Got a hand on it</strong>"

The end is near for New Zealand."
