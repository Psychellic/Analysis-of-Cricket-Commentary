"<b>width, and it's punished!</b> Imad had done such a good job of cramping Finch for room, but this is short and wide and Finch puts it away through point - importantly, he also placed it into the gap"
"this one is straighter, but he's worked through square leg to turn the strike over"
"Khawaja lets his wrists do the work, and finds a single to long on"
"tapped softly towards midwicket, and they steal a quick single before the fielder can get to it"
"<b>powered through cover</b>, the two fielders in that region just looking at the ball and then at each other as the ball flies between them and away to the rope. No-one moved"
"Faheem keeps it just short of a good length, Finch pressing to cover"
"there's a stifled appeal as the ball comes off the pad, but it's headed well down the leg side"
"chopped down to gully. Finch charges out at the non-striker's end, but Khawaja sends him back with a loud 'no!'"
"flicked softly into the leg side, where some sleepy fielding allows a run. Slight misfield from Haris Sohail"
"<b>just short of Imad!</b> Finch has struggled to penetrate the cover region, so he tries to go over it, but mis-hits his drive. It flies in the air, but dips and drops short of Imad at mid off"
"pushed into the off side, and again he can't beat the field"

"just short of a full length, outside off, and the ball comes off the inside half of the bat and rolls to midwicket"
Khawaja hops and whips off his hip to find a single through square leg
"<b>testing bouncer!</b> It seemed too quick for Finch at 146.9km/h, the ball skidding on to him and hitting him on the helmet before he was halfway into his pull. The ball hits him flush on the peak. He's fine, but he might need a new helmet out there. And there's a short delay as one is brought out to him"
"for the umpteenth time, Khawaja angles his bat and works it to third man"
"plenty of pace once again, but not enough direction as this one is fired down the leg side. Has Finch got bat on it? Looks like it's given as runs"
"<b>again Finch is late on the pull</b> as a bouncer arrives at over 146km/h, splicing the shot tamely in the air but into space on the leg side. That's definitely hurried him"

"rising off a length at 141.6km/h, but there's a little width for Finch to work with and a he finds a single to the sweeper"
"nippy bouncer at 141km/h, Khawaja ducking quickly under it. Hasnain wanders down after following through to eye-ball the batsman. It wasn't actually all that short, and not called a bouncer by the umpire"
"on a length and straight at 142.4km/h, Khawaja pushing to cover"
"<b>biffed over long on!</b> There's a fielder in place down there, but Finch takes him on with a thump down the ground. He hits it hard, and not too high but far enough to beat a leaping fielder at the boundary's edge"
"ripping off a good, full length, Finch defending to cover"
