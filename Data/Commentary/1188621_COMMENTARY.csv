"short and wide outside off, cut straight to point"
"<b>slapped straight to deep midwicket!</b> My word did the connect on that, but it was flat and it was straight to Krunal. A length ball wide outside off, trying to get him to hit into the off side. But he's used his reach to pummel this slog sweep on the up. But it's joy for India"
<B>beaten.</b> Short and skidding straight on in the corridor. Looks to cut for the one that turns but is done by the bounce
"tossed up at off stump, soft-handed drop into the covers to steal a single"
"length and flat at middle stump, hardly a stride as he defends off the outside half of the bat"

"length on off stump, leans in and steers on the rise to mid-off's right"
"length on off stump, watchfully pushed down the pitch off the back foot"
"<b>onto the stumps!</b> Knuckle ball! Bat, pad, off stump. Once again, gets the line and length spot on outside off, in the corridor. And with that variation, he gets the batsman swinging through it too early as well. Again, trying to go leg side. But it's an inside edge and it's all very ugly by the end of it. Not for India though"
"nicely behind this. No irreverent slogging this time. Short of a length at middle stump, onto the back foot and a controlled pull to beat deep midwicket to his left"
"<b>oh beautiful.</b> One of cricket's most attractive batsmen at the moment. Length ball tossed up outside off, reaches out and just uses quick wrists to whip-drive this way over the straight boundary"
"length on leg stump, deflected into the leg side off the back foot"
"<b>falls short.</b> Tossed up wide outside off, slow and loopy. Looks to drive but he's not to the pitch. Thick outside edge falls between backward point and short third man"

"length on middle stump, leans in and flicks to midwicket"
"<b>clears the straight boundary.</b> Just squeezes it out from the mid-riff area and pulls straight over the bowler. Goes 83 metres. Short of a length ball at off stump, not much room, but the extra pace helps"
"short of a length on middle stump, defended to point"
"<B>top edge and taken!</b> And a send off that will get much better as he gets more experience from a very awkward Saini. Short of a length at off stump, wants to cart this through midwicket but it only gets as far as about ten yards behind the stumps. Pant gets under it and holds on at shin height"
<b>bowled him!</b> Saini is on a hat-trick on debut! Short ball just outside off stump. He leaps off the floor and wants to stab this past wide slip for the single. But he's through it early and the ball is off the face of the bat and straight into off stump
<b>left alone.</b> Length and delicious outside off for the cover drive but Rovman is focused
left alone. Starts off with an offcutter. Short and wide outside off. Pollard walks in at it but it gets awkward fast. Lets it go

<b>beaten.</b> Nice lift off a length there. Angled across. Rovman pokes at it and is beaten
<b>shot!</b> Shorter and wider outside off this time and he gets a half stride in and slaps this past backward point
short and in the corridor. Drops the hands and lets it go. That dips on Pant a touch as it reaches him
"<b>nicely taken by Pant diving forward!</b> The previous ball, a bouncer, dipped on him. This, a slower ball, practically needed him to lunge as soon as Powell looked to hammer this. Length and wide and climbing to kiss the outside edge. Pant goes low and forward towards his right and pouches this"

"punched back, good stop off his own bowling"
"steps out and goes through with the stroke to clear the ropes! Straight hit. The bottom hand came off the bat as he made contact, didn't get to the pitch because Jadeja pulled it back but such is Pollard's reach and power. They need more of this"
punched to long-on
"fired full, defended back"
<strong>beauty!</strong> Drift from around the stumps followed by sharp turn to beat Pollard's feeble push. Stumping appeal that forces the square leg umpire to check upstairs. All good. The back foot was in the air for a split-second before it came down in the nick of time.

"too short, easy pickings, punched to long-on"
"appeal for lbw as he plays all around this indrifter, <strong>may have been slipping down</strong>"

"gets a thick outside edge as he looks to flick over mdiwicket, beat Dhawan at short third man instead"
"excellent catch! Brathwaite plays a flat-batted pull, was travelling but Krunal held on as he moved swiftly to his left. Spongy bounce, I thought, held onto the surface which made manufacturing the shot a bit difficult, in the end he didn't get the power he would've liked."

"width outside off, reaches out to drill this to sweeper cover"
"slaps this down to long-off where Pandey fumbles, but no damage done"

beaten as he looks to reach out and squeeze behind point
"goes wide yorker again, Pollard beaten as he tries to guide this past short third man"
"beaten as he looks to hoick this across the line. No one appealed, except for Rishabh Pant and Kohli goes upstairs. This hit him on the full, flush on the right thigh and replays confirm this would've crashed into the top of off stump. <b> Decision overturned, given out. </b>"
"beaten for pace, excellent bouncer. Cramped for room as he took him on with the pull"
"high full toss, mistimed to cover"

"right into the blockhole, squeezes this wide of mid-on for a single"
"he's top-edged the pull straight to midwicket. Is this an opening for the West Indies? Absolute lack of pace does Kohli in as he looks to pull from way outside off. Perhaps not the best shot but well, the surface can play tricks. The bowler rolled his fingers across the seam, gave Kohli absolutely no pace to work with. He's bitterly disappointed with himself.
