overpitched just outside off. Faf skips down the ground to convert it into a low full toss. <B>Places the square drive</b> between the two infielders and ends the over with a boundary
"slower ball, short just outside off. Tries to ramp/cut it fine, but misses"

"full, just outside off. Tries to drive, and it hits his pad. <B>Appeal for lbw</b> and given out by the umpire! <B>Ayub reviews</b>. Was there an inside edge? Definitely sounded like one. The batsman is smiling. Well, it hit him in front of off stump, so only the inside edge can save him. From UltraEdge it looks like the ball has taken a small touch off the bat's inside edge. Ayub survives!"
"<B>ouch! Hits the helmet</b> as he is late to this short ball. Tries to pull, hits him on the badge, and the keeper and umpire checks up on the batsman. <B>Concussion check and a new helmet</b>"
"full outside off stump, Faf shuffles across, down on one knee, and ramps a six over the keeper to fine leg for six! <B>Innovation at it's best</b>"

"<B>in the air</b> and he ends the Powerplay with a boundary! Irfan is not happy with how this over has ended. Good length ball outside off, Faf tries to drive but ends up hitting it from the bat's sticker area. Goes between mid off and cover for four more. Quetta 42 for 1 after the Powerplay, making up for a few slow overs between 2 and 5"

Is Ayub out? If he isn't then it's four overthrows because the ball went to the boundary. But <B>replays show he's just short!</b> The dive doesn't save Ayub, and Rutherford's excellent fielding effort has earned Peshawar Zalmi a breakthrough"

"aims for the yorker, nearly gets it too. Mistimed to midwicket trying to dig it out"

full just outside off. Drilled to deep cover
"good length, on middle. Tapped towards gully, and hey take the single. Umpire Illingworth calls it a no ball without the TV umpire's help. And that looked close! Some umpires may not have given that a no-ball, but we can give the benefit to the umpire. It was close. <B>Free hit incoming</b>"

"<b>slugged down the ground, taken at long-on!</b> Wahab ends with a wicket, but it is his opposite number running off his with bat raised to the crowd! Didn't get the elevation, but a fine knock from Sarfaraz... enough to make Quetta the first team to win batting first this season??"
"<b>slogged straight up, and brilliantly taken on the dive by Tom Kohler-Cadmore!</b> He had to do plenty to get into position from mid-on, it was coming down with snow on it, but he clutched the catch and that's two in two for Zalmi"

"full, on off stump. Thumps a drive to mid off. This one is just under 146kph"

"good length, on middle. Flicked off his pads, tucking it away behind square to deep backward for a couple"
"good length, just outside off. Tapped with soft hands towards cover for a quick single"
"<B>change of angle works!</b> Goes around the stumps, offers a ball wide outside off. And he slices a cut straight to deep point. What's even better is that the fielder moved to that position just this ball. Finally a bad performance from a wicketkeeper tonight after the entertainment from Rizwan, Sarfaraz and Azam"
"fullish, just outside off. Square drive to point"
"full, just outside off. Swipes at this, with no footwork, but hacks it to the deep midwicket boundary. A good over from the bowler ruined by that last-ball four"
"good length ball from Steyn, from the other end this time. Lands on middle, and goes across past his bat to the keeper"
<B>bizarre</b> because this is a no-ball for a very weird reason. Knocked the stumps off with his bowling hand on his delivery stride
"<B>on the helmet grille!</b> And the <B>free hit</b> goes for none. Short ball, a bit of extra pace. Nice rise, and that clatters Imam on the face. The physio is having a look"

"full, just outside off stump. Caresses a drive, and the ball goes through the hands of cover! Fielder then runs behind to stop the ball from going for four. <B>Sarfaraz isn't angry though</b>"

"fullish, just outside off. Mistimes the cover drive to cover"
"back of a length, just outside leg stump, and flying over the head to Sarfaraz. Wide given for the line perhaps, but definitely for the height"

"good length, just outside off. Cut in the gap at deep point. They want two, but eventually settle for one"
<B>leading edge</b> and chance of a run out! Tries to nudge it to the leg side but the ball goes towards the non-striker instead. Batsman is taking the single but the non-striker is slow to get off the blocks. Good throw to the keeper and he whips the bails off. But he's safe!

"flighted legbreak, Malik skips out and plays behind his pad - appeal for lbw, but he was a long way down. Quetta <b>review</b> but I suspect it'll be ump's call because of the distance from the stumps. Yep, more than 3m, so even though it's shown to be hitting middle, Malik will survive"

"slashed off the back foot, Azam cuts it off with a full-length dive at backward point! Good stuff by the big fellow"
"skids through as Malik attempts to cut, was it pad first? Quetta again use their <b>review</b>, though looks to be well outside the line, even if it did flick the flap above the knee roll. Impact outside off, and I don't think it was hitting anyway.

"tossed up, 88kph on off, driven down to long-off"
"<b>short and wide and hammered through gully!</b> Brings up the Zalmi 100, and a vital boundary to finish what was otherwise a good over. Saifi in deep conversation with his bowler. 'Animated', shall we say?"

"fired in and clipped leg side, they amble one"
"<b>uproots leg stump!</b> The Gladiators hit back at the death, Wahab dispatched by a searing yorker! Hasnain punches the air, though it's a tad forlorn. Wahab's job is done"
"thumped into the covers and Rutherford is running regardless... <b>Mahmood run out at the non-striker's end!</b> He started, he stopped, having picked out the man, and then wasn't even in the frame. But they have got Rutherford at the right end"
"<b>wide full toss, flies away to the rope, and that's pretty much the game!</b> Rutherford is celebrating already, the ball slipped out and went yards wide of Sarfaraz, five wides to Zalmi and the scores are level!"
"pitched up and drilled through the covers, <b>Zalmi win by three wickets!</b>"
