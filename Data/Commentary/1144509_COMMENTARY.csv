"<b>cut him in half first ball!</b>. On a length, nipping back in and hits his thigh pad on the way to the keeper."
"fuller outside off, mis-times his drive to the bowler's left"
"some shape in the air, Woakes is looking for it to swing bowling a fuller length. Ends up on the stumps, and is bunted towards cover"
"length ball that time, stump to stump, Dimuth tucks it to midwicket to get off the mark"
"getting some nibble in the air is Woakes, lands on a length and moves slightly across the batsman, who gets a thick inside edge towards square leg"
"nice line, in the corridor and he's happy to let it go through"
"lovely line first up, kissing the fourth stump. Confident leave by the batsman, but ends up being a good one because the ball is moving gently away"
"and there's the Archer zip, takes off appreciably from back of a length and the batsman hurriedly pats it down"
"<b>direct hit</b>. good length on the stumps, tucked to midwicket, they take off for a single, but there's a wee bit of hesitation. However, he's comfortably in."
"length ball on middle and leg, patted back in defence"
"bouncer over leg stump, but dug in short enough to give the batsman enough time to duck safely under it"
"<b>got him!</b> It's that lovely, lovely line that does it. Archer has taken out the Sri Lankan captain with one that is moving away but bowled in the channel. Karunaratne follows it with his hands, it's bowled at the perfect line that <i>just</i> draws the bat slightly away from the body, kisses it's edge and goes to the keeper."
"Length ball, he comes forward and gets rapped on the pads again"
"slashed straight down to third man! Two in two and Sri Lanka are tottering already. <em>Reminded of Jayasuriya's dismissal against Srinath that sent an entire nation into tizzy - albeit temporarily - during the 1996 World Cup semi-final in Kolkata.</em> This was short, had enough width, he threw his bat at it to get a thick outside edge, this was in the air for a while, Moeen picked it early, took a few steps in, settled underneath and pouched it quite nicely."
"length ball outside off, pushed to point"
"yorker on off stump, comes on the front foot to drive to cover off the toe-end"
"back of a length outside off, steered to third man. That's the first time in a while that the bat has made confident contact with the ball"
"nice tight line, on a length and kissing top of off, defended off the back foot"
"length ball outside off, steered to point"
"back of a length outside off, moving away from the right-hander who has a poke at it, but misses"
ooh that line again. In the channel on a length and nipping in. Lets it go through safely because it was bouncing over the stumps
"no movement from the batsman, stays with his bat raised and sees this one outside off go to the keeper"
"gets his line straighter to force him to play, back of a length on middle and leg, he gets behind it and defends"
"back of a length on off stump, defended to cover. The non-striker wanted a single, was loudly sent back by the batsman. <b>Maiden</b>"
"too full on leg stump, and he's turned it with his wrists to fine leg"
"good length on off, defended"
"nice looking punch off the back foot and a mis-field gives them two. Risky second though. Punched to mid-on, who fumbles. They make the second run but he has to dive to get in at the end"
"another good looking punch. Back of a length ball outside off, stands tall and gets on top of the bounce to punch past the bowler"
"fuller length on off, jabbed to midwicket"
"back of a length works against Mendis better, and he defends it outside off towards cover"
"<b>beaten</b>. Good line again by Archer, kissing the fourth stump and he pushes it from inside the line"
"<b>beauty</b> Given room outside off, and is on the shorter side, he comes on the front foot and lashes this through cover"
"<b>great response by Archer</b>, pacy delivery on the fourth stump, moving away, squares him up, but the ball eludes the edge"
"and follows it with a bumper that has the batsman getting out of the way late and in a hurry. Got big on him, he was looking to punch this"
"<b>shot!</b>. Archer's overdone the short ball, gets his radar quite wrong that time, chest high on leg stump, and he swivels and uncorks a beauty of a pull shot that sends the ball rocketing over fine leg"
"<b>beautiful</b>. Archer overcompensates by bowling it very full outside off, and he leans into a creamy drive that sends the ball purring to the cover fence"
"good length in the channel, and he lets it go through"
"too full on the pads, twirled to midwicket, where Archer does well to slide and stop it"
"outside edge flies to third man. Third slip had come out, but it would have possibly eluded him too. Squared him up slightly with the movement and took a thick edge"
"strays on the pads again, and he's able to work it to fine leg, using his wrists nicely"
"<b>drilled</b> straight back past the bowler. Full ball on the stumps, and he stands tall to drive it back past the bowler. Looks a peach when that shot comes off, it does"
"good length on off, defended solidly back"
"fuller length on off, defended towards mid-off"
"ooh, he was trying to move his bat away but was a bit late in doing it, but it bounces towards slips off his blade"
"driven crisply, but straight to extra cover"
"good line, in the channel and on a length, the batsman shoulders arms"
"good length on off stump, jabbed to cover"
"angling into him on middle stump and straightens a touch, gets a thickish leading edge that trickles to cover. Soft enough hands so there was no danger of that looping up and carrying to the fielder"
"nicely flicked to deep midwicket, though not with perfect timing, so it's pulled in by Archer after a chase"
"and now he biffs that disdainfully to the square leg boundary! On the shorter side, he picked up the length very early and rocked back to swat it away"
leading edge rolls to point. Woakes went a bit wider of the crease and the angle defeated the batsman's attempted flick
good length on off and he gets nicely behind it to defend
"good length, nipping in from a bit outside off, defended into the offside"
"strays on the pads, but Fernando is late on the flick and it trickles to midwicket off his pad"
"full ball outside off, driven to mid-off"
"length ball outside off, patted back to the bowler"
"back of a length well outside off, chops it down to third man"
"<b>stunning shot</b>. That wasn't very short, but he picked up the length so quickly, got on the front foot and pulled it to deep midwicket."
"<b>clobbered</b>. He was expecting the bouncer in response, and Archer did just that. Fernando was waiting, rocked back, swivelled and pulled it from in front of his face and into the fine leg crowd. In fact that's been pulled so far into the crowd they need a new ball! Bounced on a railing and went out of the ground I think"
"that's a good delivery, yorker on the fourth stump at 144kph, and the batsman is late in getting his bat down on it, sneaks through to the keeper"
"fuller on the stumps, patted back to the bowler"
"fuller on the pads, flicked to deep square with his wrists"
"length ball, angling in from slightly wide of the stumps, squirted towards point"
"good length on off, driven to point's right"
"loses his radar, too far down leg"
"back of a length outside off, dabbed down to third man"
"healthy outside edge and that will run away to the third man fence! Back of a length outside off and moving away, he follows it with his bat, half-deliberate edge with no slips in place, guided fine enough to leave the fielder at third man no chance"
"back of a length outside off, dabbed to short third man"
"back of a length outside off again, and he plays it almost facing the bowler, guiding it to third man. Was clearing his front leg, perhaps expecting a short one that he could pull into oblivion, but adjusted"

"back of a length on the stumps, pulled to deep midwicket, keeping the ball along the ground"
"good length angling into off stump, defended solidly towards cover"

"fuller on off, 145kph, driven to mid-off"
"back of a length outside off, jabbed to point"
"back of a length outside off, waits for it and runs it down to third man with a horizontal bat, riding the bounce"
"lovely cover drive off a fuller one, bowled slightly slower at 128kph. Beats the in-field but there is protection in the deep"
"<b>he's upper cut it straight down third man's throat!</b> What have you done Avishka, you were looking so in control... Short ball outside off, and for some reason he thought it would be a good idea to just gently upper-cut it, help it along its way as it were - except Adil Rashid was stationed at third man, so it was always a shot with high risk. And he's duly gobbled up, taking a few steps forward"
"yorker on off stump first up, dug out to mid-on"
"back of a length outside off, plays that horizontal bat dab to third man"
"length ball outside off, defended back"
"dug it in short and the batsman ducks under, but that didn't rise very high"
"oooh jaffa. Gets great carry off a length outside off, and it goes past the bat's shoulder"
"wider outside off, he's happy to shoulder arms"
"good length, outside off again, gets it to nip back in but that is too far outside off to be threatening the stumps and the batsman can safely leave it"
"good length outside off, from a bit wide of the crease, and he jabs at it, gets a thick edge to square third man. Wood tumbles over in his follow through, but no damage"
"short ball on the stumps, controls his pull shot well to keep it along the ground to deep square"
"on target short ball, going at his head and he ducks safely below it"
"fuller on off, gets behind it and defends it back with a straight bat"
"oooh that's whistled past the outside edge. Cross-seam ball that pitched on off and jagged away, leaving Mathews feeling for it, and squaring him up"
"fuller on off, he takes a stride out to drive, but mis-times it back to the bowler. Mathews yet to open his account"
"<b>lovely shot</b>. In the slot to drive, and he gets down on one knee to cream this half-volley through extra cover"
"<b>mix up, but no direct hit</b> Fuller ball, clipped to mid-on and the batsmen seem strangely lethargic about deciding whether to run or not, almost ambling. Mathews yells no and Mendis scrambles back. Wayward throw saves him"
pulled to deep square
"still on zero is Mathews. good length on off, moving away a touch again, and squirted to point"

"back of a length outside off, solidly behind the ball"
"stabbed out to point, looking for the single as Wood hits the deck hard once more. Nothing there..."
"Stokes rolls his fingers on a full length, tucked firmly to short midwicket"

half a stump's recalibration to the off side... uneasily blocked down into the crease from back of a length
"wide on the crease, tucked to the leg side, Stokes sprints like a madman to field in his followthrough, picks up and shies ... and <strong>Mendis's despairing dive wouldn't have saved him if it had hit!</strong>"

"outside off, chopped to point"
"flicked with more urgency to the leg side, but straight at the man"
"<B>big turn!</B> Quicker and flatter from Moeen, and that scuttled as it turned... Mendis was playing back and nearly paid the price. Inside edge,<strong> onto Buttler's boot,</strong> but he couldn't flick it into his gloves!"

"tossed up, outside off, Mendis leathers it into the covers, just short of the man"
"<B>slog-swept and brilliantly caught by Morgan!</B> That's a blinder, a goalkeeper save with reverse-cupped hands, low to his left at short midwicket as Mendis pummelled the loose delivery outside off, but didn't quite pick his spot. The drip-drip of spin has forced the error, and now Sri Lanka are in strife"
"<B>caught and bowled!</B> Wow, right up to the bat, a hard-handed push through the line, and Rashid stoops in his followthrough to conquer. Sri Lanka are in freefall now!"

"loopy full one, driven to long-off"
"oooh big big turn. Pitched on leg and spun sharply across, de Silva manages to adjust and reach out to push to point"
"tossed up, pushed back to the bowler"
and that one didn't turn much. Pitched on a length on middle and the batsman went back and across to slap it into the extra cover region
"<b>pops up in the air</b> but short cover can't get there in time. down the track, but Moeen got it to bounce higher and he pushed at it, popped up to short mid-off"
defended off the back foot
"length on the pads, turned to short fine leg"
"tossed it up a bit, angling across him, worked to long-on"
"flattish and full, comes forward to punch-drive to long-on"
"flatter and drags it down shorter, having seen the batsman come down, and he can only block it back to the bowler"
stride out to defend outside off
"tossed up on middle, Mathews goes inside out to drive to mid-off. Stokes doesnt collect cleanly and is angry with himself. He had dived full length to his right, so a fumble is okay - but Stokes is the super man on the field"
swept to fine leg
"short ball, slapped past cover off the back foot - except it's not past cover because Stokes is across in a flash to intercept with his left hand"
"tossed up outside off, , driven past Stokes that time, too far to his left to intercept"
"<b>bottom-edge bounces off Buttler's pads</b>. went back to one that kept a bit lower and got an under edge to it. Tough to call that a 'chance' though technically it might be one, but Buttler had barely any time to react. It misses the stumps, and rolls off his pads"
"tossed up a bit full, de Silva gets to the pitch and flicks it over midwicket"
that was the weird version of the carrom ball Root bowls with split fingers. Mathews works it towards mid-on
""
"tossed up on the pads, flicked to deep square"
"drags it down too short but he gets away with it, with the batsman too early into a slap-pull that goes to long-on"
full toss on the pads but he can only sweep it to deep square.
"oooh that's beaten him completely. Nicely tossed up, dips on him, pitches on leg and spins viciously past. He was going for a big slog-sweep, connects with air. Buttler whips the bails off, and they're going upstairs, but think Mathews didn't get his foot over the line. And replays confirm. He did overbalance, but kept his foot grounded behind the line"
"nicely tossed up again, and Mathews tries to heave it over cow corner but mis-times the big on-drive, the ball trickles to long-on"
"they're trying to attack Rashid but can't seem to time the ball. Another slog sweep to a flighted delivery, mistimed to long-on"
went for hte reverse sweep but with all the conviction of a butterfly facing a bulldozer. Or some better analogy. Anyway it was half-hearted and this was a length ball outside off that he couldn't lay bat on
"googly, didn't pick it, rolls off the pad"
"and Rashid ends his spell with one that the batsman can't get on top of - apt for how Sri Lanka have handled him. Flighted on the stumps, tried to cut it, no timing at all as it rolls to point"
"<b>De Silva dives at the non-striker's end but he could be in trouble here</b>. good length on off, spinning into him, tucked to deep square. Mathews is not the quickest, but the dives has <b>saved him</b>. Had set off for two immediately, the early decision helped him, and was committed to diving in"
""
"variation now, this was a leg-break. Pitched on off and turned away, bounced too! Dealt with reasonably, square driven through point"
"flighted on the stumps, driven back, Root leaps and catches it. The crowd roars, but it's a bump ball, driven into the ground first"

"good length on off, clipped towards mid-off"

"good length in the corridor, patted down in defence"
"bumper, but way too short and goes well over the batsman's head. Wide"
"yorker on off, dug back out to the bowler"
short ball but doesn't rise above the waist. Swivels to pull this to deep square leg

"giving himself room to try and swipe this across the line, but it's a clever ball by Wood, cutter dug into the pitch. He mistimes the swipe to mid-on"
"<b>inside edge goes to fine leg</b> but he got so little bat on it, Liam Dawson is able to run around and cut off the boundary. Another off-cutter by Wood and another attempted swipe gone wrong"
"dug this in short and quicker this time, but he had to fetch the pull from outside off, so ends up toe-ending to mid-on, where Archer dives and stops the ball"
"backing away to give himself room, but another off-cutter that grips in the pitch lands on a length on off, and the bat swing connects with air"
"you have to give it to Sri Lanka that they're trying to hit out. They're just doing a horrible job of it. But it's not easy when Wood sends one down like this at 147 kph, following a succession of mid-120s balls. Swatted to mid-on off the toe-end"
"yorker on the stumps, dug out to midwicket, giving himself room"
"short ball, climbing into him on leg stump, but doesn't rise enough and he's able to pull it to deep midwicket"
"<b>Root leaps to his left at mid-on and pulls off a super catch</b>. Slower ball, leg-cutter at just 111 kph, pitched on off and moving away. Another mis-timed pull, it was only a matter of time before one of those went to a fielder. This one almost didn't, came off the toe-end and travelled to mid-on, where Root ran to his left and leapt up to pluck the ball."
"bouncer first up, outside off, and Thisara ducks under it"
"too full on the pads, flicked easily to fine leg"
"backing away, but Archer follows him with a back of a length delivery and Mathews can only steer it to short third man"
"short ball on the stumps, pulled to deep midwicket. Placed well enough to run two."
"backing away again, but Wood bowls the wide yorker outside off. Mathews is forced to try and reach for it, but he can't get there"
"backing away again, Wood follows him but does so with a slower ball. Angelo completely fooled, ends up popping a leading edge towards point that falls safe"
"quicker one to Thisara, 144kph and well wide of off stump, another wide yorker. Thisara does his stand and deliver routine but he'll need to move his feet to get near that - and he doesn't"
"back of a length ball targeted at the batsman, swiped across the line, mistimes it to deep square leg"
"pacy short one that time, Mathews pulls it while giving himself room but not well enough to carry over the boundary. Collected by deep midwicket"
he's still trying to give himself room but Archer follows him with a length ball and he can only steer it away to point
"Thisara was already standing outside leg and Archer goes there, the batsman wants to flick it powerfully but misses and it rolls into the onside off the pad"
"yorker outside off, Mathews still giving himself room, manages to drive it to deep cover"
"<b>caught by Rashid diving forward at third man</b>. The short ball works for Jofra, gets it to rise above shoulder height outside off, and Thisara has a slash at it, but without control. The ball flies off a top edge to third man, where Rashid takes a good catch."
"full ball outside off, steps away and drives again. But it's like Mathews and timing have had a temporary divorce in this innings. The ball goes to mid-off"
"pacy short ball, but well over the batsman and he'll have to rebowl that"
"attempted yorker gone wrong, high full toss but below the waist, driven through cover with an angled bat face"
"yorker on the stumps, but he's backing away so is able to square drive it to deep point"
"backing away again, but Wood follows with one of his cutters. The batsman doesn't get room or pace and can only tap the ball towards mid-on"
"much-needed boundary, though not where he was aiming at. Short ball outside off, Udana has a big swing at it, it flies off the bat face over point - he was targetting over midwicket"
"backing away again, Wood does his shtick where he follows the batsman. Bowls it back of a length, no room for Udana to pull, but he goes for it anyway. Gets it high on the bat, and it loops up. Root at mid-on takes a few steps back and settles under it."
"high full toss, think that was very close to a no-ball. 148kph too! But a good shot by Mathews at long last, stays legside of the ball, opens the face and sends this to the point fence"

"another attempted yorker, ends up as a full toss, batsman's backing away and drives to extra cover"
"<b>good shot</b>. Adjusted well did Mathews. Archer banged in a short and quick one on target, but Mathews kept his eye on the ball, arched back and upper cut it over the keeper for a boundary"
"short ball over the stumps. Malinga backs away and has a hoick at it, but the ball sails over his bat"
"another short ball, following Malinga who was backing away. Half-appeal from Wood, but the ball seemed to have gone off the batsman's shoulder and to the keeper. Yep replays confirm its off the shoulder"
<b>the old two-card trick works</b>. Quick bouncer followed by inch-perfect yorker. Hits the base of leg stump - Malinga's exposing all his stumps backing away - quicker than Malinga can bring his bat down for his attempted slash through the off side.
"backing away and Wood follows him with an attempted yorker. Turns into a low full toss, that he manages to swat to mid-on to get off strike. It's what Malinga, with all his experience, should have attempted to do last ball instead of going for a glory shot."
"slower yorker follows Mathews who was backing away and he can only dig it out to mid-on. <b>But they are alive to the possibility of two runs</b> and they get it, with no England fielders nearby."
"length ball on the stumps, backs away and slaps it to long-off"
"<b>nails the big swing over cow corner</b>. That's a well-timed one - a rarity in this innings by Mathews. Full on the pads, and swung lustily"

low full toss and Mathews swats it across the line to long-on. Declines the single to stay on strike
"another low full toss, Mathews gets down on his knee and twirls it from outside off to long-on's right and they push hard to get two"

He's<B> reviewing</B>, but I strongly doubt this will change anything. Clipping surely ... <B>indeed it is!</B> Yorkshire's JB has fallen in front of his home crowd!"
"two slips as Root plays so late, on the back foot, out to point"
"<strong>swing and seam!</strong> Back of a length, so it looked a bit more dramatic than it was. But Root goes fishing and doesn't catch anything, luckily for him"
"on the back foot, opens the face, glides off the toe, through the cordon to third man"
"back of a length, off-stump line, dabbed cautiously into the covers"
"back of a length, hits the bat hard as it nips off the deck on an off-stump line"
"pushed firmly off the back foot, cover makes a meal of the interception and they jog an easy single"

pressing back to the bowler with a full face of the bat. Determined and resolute in defence
"outside off, on a full length, can't quite time his back-foot glide into the covers"
beats the outside edge of a mildly ambitious drive
"full and straight, leg-stump line. Blocked"
lines up the pull but bails out of the stroke as it turns out to be a slower-ball bouncer
"<strong>beaten!</strong> This is lovely, throwback work from Malinga, skidding onto a solid off-stump line and zipping past the edge"
"wider line, curls from the hand this time, no stroke offered"
"nudged to midwicket, playing round the front pad, which is mildly fraught with danger, as YJB showed..."
"out comes the drive, but this is slightly back of a length, so short cover is able to intercept with ease. A fine over"
"up on the toes, poked into the off side"
"opens the face, and pushes to cover"
"<strong>that's Root at his best!</strong> Balance, and timing, up on the toes, opening the face, transferring his weight to meet the back-of-a-length ball with an inch-perfect punch behind point"
"similar shot, jumping this time to ensure the timing, out to the point sweeper"
compactly into line and pushed down the pitch to the bowler
"<B>driven, on the up, and inches short of cover!</B> A rare misjudgment in length, pushing with hard hands and so nearly paid the price! Sri Lanka are brawling"
"slower ball, looping into the pads on a full length, clipped behind square"
"wafted through backward point, just too much width on that occasion, and third man slides round to limit the damage"
"outside off, pushed to backward point"
"very full, into the toes, dabbed back down the pitch"
"another open-faced push to backward point, and an inspection of his bat afterwards, as if it was chipped. But no, on we go"

"a flat-footed drive into the covers, just placing bat on ball for the fun of it"
"tighter line, tucked to mid-on with a closed face on impact"
"<B>a dirty hack over backward point!</B> Gets away with it, a big late inswinger to Vince, which cramped his expansive swing at the wide one. Lucky"
tucked to the leg side
"<B>beaten past the inside-edge!</B> That one nipped back sharply, and beat the off stump by a whisker too!"
"fenced across the line, out to the leg side. England still sitting tight for now, this has been as feisty a start as Sri Lanka could have hoped for"
"short and hoisted round the corner to backward square, where Pradeep slips as he gathers the ball, to ironic cheers"
"<B>that's the Vince we know and <strike>despair of</strike> love!</B> Striding forward to the half-volley, and pummelling a glorious drive through long-off!"
"<strong>on the toes! </strong> A leg-stump half-volley, whistling off the middle of the bat, and that's got England up and running!"
"half-forward, soft hands, dabbed to cover from a neutral stance"
"<B>edged and gone!</B> Oh lordy, it's like watching the highlights of a Vince Test innings! In the slot, allegedly, but just not quite as there as the previous drive. A thick nick, a tumbling take at slip, and England are ... in some bother"
"outside off, wide line, no stroke"
"solid defence on the back foot, Root content to keep his timbers intact at all costs for the moment"
"tailing into the right-hander, that's a lovely probing line, and it draws another solid block"

"there for the drive once more, not quite timed"
squaring up on the back foot once more
"driving into the toes, solid in defence. A maiden over. That's a rare beast against this team"

"banged in short, sways inside the line"
eased out to backward point
"steered off the back foot, to the right-hander's backward point this time"
"a touch of width, Root is drawn into an expansive swipe, but can't time it through third man"
"<B>tremendous timing!</B> That's the one Root has been waiting for, fractionally over-pitched on off stump, and cherry-picked through long-off with swish of the wrists"
"beaten on the back foot, shaping past the off stump. Back of a length, so Morgan draws his bat inside at the last minute"
"shaping across the left-hander, no stroke offered as Morgan lines it up and lets it go"
"short and sharp, Morgan bails out of the pull as the ball slips over his head"
"<B>edged low through second slip!</B> The man had just been brought into position, it was a slower ball, wobbling seam, and Morgan was deceived throwing his hands hard through the ball. Unlucky!"
"dabbed to backward point with an open face, fantastic diving stop to intercept"
"shaping into the pads, tucked to the leg side"
"outside off, shaping away once more, this is a fine spell from Sri Lanka's new-ball pair"
punched back to the bowler

pressed with a full face to mid-on
"round the wicket, outside off, no stroke this time"
nudged solidly to mid-on
"defended with intent, back down the pitch"
shaping in nicely towards the off stump as Pradeep continues his constrictive spell. Blocked

"full and straight, dug out with a vertical blade on off stump"
"left alone outside off, this is turning into an extraordinarily economical spell"
"firmly pressed to the sweeper in the covers, stretching onto the front foot once more. Two an over after six in this era is remarkable"
"turning into the legs, nudged to backward square"
"flicked off the pads, and picks the gap well at midwicket"
"hustled in defence from round the wicket, an inside-edged poke on an off-stump line. Well bowled"
"more solid contact this time, a fuller face of the bat, into the off-side"
"hurried on the cut outside off, extra bounce as Root looks to take on third man, and gully is briefly interested"
"nurdled to the on side, another tight and probing over"
"on the legs, tucked square"
"left alone outside off, solid areas"
"more Test-match bowling, ploughing a line and length outside off, and tempting the batsman to have a go. He decides not to"
"fuller, tighter to the stumps. Morgan defends firmly on the back foot"
"back of a length, pushed hard into the covers, a half-stop allows them to hustle for the single"
"a hint of width, but Root settles for a cramped chop to third man. The fifty is up to a ripple of applause"

fenced into the off side
"tight to the pads, and eased back down the pitch"
"another single to long-on, calm accumulation"
"driven, but well intercepted by a diving cover"
"punched into the covers, no way through there"
worked off the legs for another single
"<strong>here comes Morgan!</strong> Battered down the ground with a gallop and a swing, but that plugs five yards in from the rope... not quite found his Old Trafford range yet!"
poked out to point
"clipped off the legs, and <B>in the air for an eternity!</B> Short midwicket would have inhaled that, but he was too deep for Sri Lanka's liking..."

"outside off, too wide to drive, no stroke"
"firmly forward, head over the ball"
"very full, swinging into the toes, flicked with intent to deep midwicket"
"<strong>that's a beautiful clip to the rope!</strong> The solidity of Sri Lanka's start is just beginning to be picked apart now... over-pitched on the toes, and you don't get away with that line to Joe Root... he's stealthed his way into the 30s once more, and it's time for a <B>drink</B>"
"length ball around off, Morgan looks to cut it away but doesn't time it, ends up chopping into the ground towards point"
"length ball, in the corridor, Morgan watches it closely before letting it go through to the keeper"
"<b>an appeal for caught-behind</b> but the umpire is unmoved. Was a length ball again, going away with the angle, Morgan looks to drive on the up and is beaten. Well away from the ball"
"short of length and some width outside off, cuts it towards sweeper cover for one"
"a touch fuller around off this time, Root comes on the front foot and drives it towards mid-off for a quick single"
"fuller around off, looks to drive through covers but doesn't get the timing right, mid-off cuts it off"
"length ball outside off, steered to third man"
"in-dipper that raps him on the pads, loud appeal by Isuru but the umpire's not interested. Sri Lanka not interested in reviewing either. And you can see why - thick inside edge"
"angling across on a length, opens the face to chop it to third man"
"<b>stunning return catch</b>! Sri Lanka are still alive! Low full toss on the stumps, Morgan drills it back - didn't time it that well but it was to Udana's right and he just stuck both hands out in his follow through and the ball sticks. No repeat of the Afghanistan heroics for Morgan and he's gone."
nippy full-length ball outside off that Stokes is happy to let through
"good length, homing in on that off stump line, Stokes jabs it to the bowler's right"
"good length nipping in from off, clipped off his pads to deep midwicket"

"good length, stump to stump, gets behind it and defends into the off side"
"walks into the cut, down the track and nicely hit, but can't go past point"

"digs this into the pitch and gets it to rise up, Root defends off his chest, gets up on his toes"
"on the tramline, back of a length, Root stretches out and glides this to third man"
back of a length and around the fourth stump - they've bowled a lot to Stokes there - and he's been punching to the in-field on the offside
"floated up full on the stumps, driven to long-on off the front foot"
"angled into him full on the stumps, patted back to the bowler's left"

"back of a length, nipping into him, tucked towards mid-on"
"yorker on the stumps, clipped off his toes to midwicket"

"back to length balls outside off nipping in and Stokes is back to punch in the V, this time back to the bowler"
"slower ball, just 100 kph out of the back of the hand. Floats outside off, and Stokes decides to let it go through"

"fuller on the pads, turned to short fine leg"

tossed up a bit more and draws Stokes into the off-drive - as he intends to given he's got a slip - but Stokes plays it well to stroke it to long-off
clipped to long-on
"fuller on the stumps, solid forward defensive by Stokes"
"nice touch by Root, waits in his crease and dabs this length ball very fine. Third man runs to his left to collect"
"length ball nipping in, defeats his flick and hits him on the pads. Loud appeal, but I think that was going down leg surely. So does the umpire, apparently."
"slower ball yorker, clipped towards midwicket"
"length ball outside off, Root cuts to third man, getting low with the ball not bouncing much"
"fuller length angling into him, another slower ball, 101 kph. Waits for it and steers to short third man"

"fuller outside off, off-driven to long-off"
"flatter and a bit shorter, Stokes goes on the back foot to swat this through midwicket"
tossed up on the stumps and Root drives to long-off to raise a calm <b>fifty</b>. He's having a World Cup and a half

"length ball outside off, steered to third man"
"gives him the charge and flashes this into the offside, but can't go past point"
"pacy bouncer, Stokes turns his head away and doesn't need to do much else because it's gone over his head. Wide called"
"nicely clipped off his pads into the gap at midwicket. Length ball on the pads, shot was on and Stokes did well to get on the front foot and get his placement spot on"
"down the track again, but the bowler shortens his length a bit and Stokes can only stroke it into the offside. They get a quick single, with cover fumbling"
"back of a length on off, Root jabs this into the legside, had to get down a bit more than he wanted to, because the ball didn't really bounce much"
"<b>down the track and over the top</b>. Gets to the pitch of the ball and hits a flat six, straight back. And just like that, the pressure is on the bowler"
"manoeuvres this to deep midwicket's left, flicking off the back foot"
on the pads and flicked to deep midwicket
"<b>clobbered</b>. That's a free gift that Stokes is going to not look in the mouth. Too short, sat up and begged to be hit, Stokes obliged. Rocked back and leathered this straight back"
"more air and on a good length, patted back to the bowler"
"gets some drift into Stokes, and his jab takes a thick leading edge to roll to cover"
"length ball outside off, guided to third man"
"down the track, but he slows it up and bowls it short. Stokes taps it to long-on"

"length ball outside off, defended to point"
"tossed up on the pads, flicked to deep square leg"
"flatter, skiddier, hurries on to him and he tries to slap it into the onside but gets it too straight to mid-on. Loses his grip on the bat too after hitting"
"starts with a slower one outside off, 104kph. Stokes lets it through"
"length ball outside off, given some room and he slashes it to deep cover"
"<b>appeal for a catch down legside</b> but the umpire is unmoved. They go for the review. Sri Lanka think they've had Root strangled down leg. Length ball drifting down, Root went to flick it but appeared to not connect. The keeper tumbled to his left and caught it, and went up immediately. <b>And there is a spike!</b> Root will be out. Malinga was brought back for this and he's delivered. Huge wicket."
"another one down leg side, but this is flicked off the pads to fine leg"
"short ball and well down leg side for a wide. Three consecutive balls down leg by Malinga, but the first one brought a wicket."

"back of a length outside off, pushed through cover"
"good length, stump to stump, opens the bat face to steer to third man"

"full, into the toes, Buttler chips it straight back down the pitch and <B>inches from the close-set catcher on the non-strikers' toes!</B> Golly!"
"banged in short and <B>slammed behind square with disdain!</B> Mixing it up, but didn't get it up ... a chest-high freebie, into the gap"
"<B>Buttler is lbw!</B> But he has <B>reviewed!</B> That seemed plumb in front, so he must believe there's inside-edge ... maybe off the toe? It was a Malinga special, fast and flat into the pads, slightly leg-sided, like the Bairstow lbw earlier ... <B>no, no edge ... and smashing leg stump!</B>"
"wider outside off and swinging away, Moeen chases with an exploratory drive to point"
"banged in short, Moeen rises with the bounce, in behind the line, and drops the ball at his feet"
"very full, very straight, angled defence"
"solid on the back foot, and patted back down the pitch"
"nurdled off the hip, and <B>that is timed like a metronome!</B> Just keeps racing along at a steady tempo, forever eluding the sweeper sprinting round from square leg. Top shot"

"on the pads, tucked square"

"round the wicket, seeking extra probe into the toes, but serves up a low full-toss that is pushed calmly into the covers"
"<B>beauty!</B> Nips off the seam outside off, and squeaks past the outside edge! Going with the angle across the left-hander's bows"
firm defence into the covers
"on the back foot, dabbed to the off side. Caution is Stokes' watchword"
defended back down the pitch to mid-on. Solid in defence
"poked from the back foot to short cover, not a lot of footwork, but a good eye keeping the good ball out"
a touch of room to free the arms and Moeen does just that with a firm crack to deep cover
"round the wicket, darted into the left-hander, cautious in defence"
"outside off, and a very fat outside edge through the vacant slip. Without that bat, there would have been a raucous appeal on the back leg!"
tucked to the leg side
nurdled off the hip
half-stopped in the covers as they rush through for the single. Stokes drops his bat and asks for permission to retrieve it as the ball goes dead

flogged into the leg side off a bit of a bottom edge
"advancing out of the crease, a show of intent now from Stokes, who rifles a drive into the covers"
"<B>sliced drive over extra cover!</B> Heart briefly in mouth, but lands safe in no-man's land"

a touch of width and Moeen climbs into another languid drive. Comfortably finds the gap in the covers this time
"retreats to leg, making room for a drive into the covers"
"down on one knee, and <B>pelted over square leg!</B> There is a man back on the rope but to be fair he nailed that, flat and fast into the gap, very square, and striking the boundary sponge on the full"
"<strong>Moeen holes out to long-off!</strong> Wow ... he took it on, blood pumping after finding the middle of the bat at last ... he nailed this one too, galloping down the track to meet the pitch, but Udana was waiting, right back on the rope, and plucked a fast-travelling missile with the utmost calm!"
solid in defence
whipped with lots of bottom hand to long-on
pressed with intent back to the bowler
"on the back foot, punched to cover"
"<B>genuine edge, and valuable runs!</B> No slip ... that's an error when wickets are the be-all-and-end-all, and third man isn't fine enough to intercept"
"right behind the line this time, walking down the track for extra emphasis"
"<B>lovely yorker!</B> Stokes watches the outswing all the way, and stabs it down on off stump"
"back of a length, on the pads, tucked to midwicket as Stokes hops in annoyance at missing out there"
"low full toss, targetting the yorker again, clipped firmly to midwicket. Five off the over to keep very much up with the requirement"
"<B>short and wide outside off and that's a massive breakthrough!</B> Woakes was over-eager, looking to crash a four through point, but he topped a thin edge to the keeper, and one of England's most bankable finishers has failed ... scenes squared!"
"clipped to the leg side, and off the mark straightaway"
firmly over the ball ...
"outside off, and punched into the covers"
"<B>two in the over for de Silva!</B> Incredible meltdown from England, Rashid was driving inside the line, expecting spin but merely feathering another edge to the keeper! This is remarkable!"

"too wide outside off, just the wrong side of the tramlines"
"tighter line but outside off again, poked into the off side and Stokes accepts the single"

"another slower ball, chopped into the off side off the back foot ... another single"
"round the wicket, low full toss, struck firmly into the covers but straight to the man"
"firmly pressed into the covers, another single to keep the strike..."
"<B>chipped in the air!</B> But safe, short of midwicket, as Archer closes the face to squeeze the leg-stump yorker away"
"<B>yorker again!</B> Archer plays it well, fully over the ball and watching with his front foot out of harm's way"
"clipped with aplomb through the leg side, Archer wants two, Stokes refuses point blank... job done for now..."
"yorker length again, but lacking the toe-menacing venom that he gets to the right handers, flicked to leg"
<B>banged in short!</B> Archer swings into a pull but wears it in his midriff ... another one survived though ...
"back of a length, flicked firmly but straight to square leg. Archer is frustrated that he's missed the gap, but he's done the important in that over"
"perfect from Udana! Outside off, but inside the tramline. Stokes doesn't play a stroke, hoping for the wide and not getting it from umpire Erasmus"
"into the toes this time, clumped with a full face to the sweeper at long-on"
"round the wicket, slapped straight to cover. Another dot ..."
"<strong>smashed to long-on and gone!</strong> Archer is livid with himself, he latched onto the length but failed to pick the slower ball, bat-face closing on impact as he spooned his shot down Perera's throat! England ere nine-down, and everything now rests on Stokes finding some urgent boundaries!"
"round the wicket, very full, stabbed to cover, there could have been a run but they decide against it"
"outside off, left alone"
"full length, tailing away, an ambitious wipe through the line, but not connected... interesting opening exchange"
"well bowled, wide line, swinging away, within the tramlines, no chance to score off that"
"that one, on the other hand, is the wrong side of the tramlines. Ironic cheers from an England crowd rather desperate for runs all of a sudden!"
"thumped into the off side, could have been a run, but not against the dangerman"
whipped from a full length outside off to deep midwicket. Dhoni-esque in followthrough if not placement. Turns down another single
"<B>smashed out to deep midwicket ... and dropped!</B> Such a tough chance, fast and flat, and he had his fingertips under the ball, but couldn't complete the deal!"
tucked off the toes to backward square leg.<strong> Malinga is done for the day after a stunning spell!</strong>
"length ball, angled into Stokes' arc and <strong>utterly lambasted over long-on!</strong> Tremendous muscular batting, but that is not smart bowling"
"<B>Stokes on the rampage!</B> A gallop down the track, a mighty heave over wide long-off! Pace on the ball, and it vanishes!"
"Stokes leaves his crease again, but picks the slower ball this time, and checks his stroke with a punch to cover"
"tapped into the leg side, and <B>Stokes wants two immediately!</B> Wood slips momentarily, but finds his feet to scamper home!"
a nudge into the off side and a strolled single into the vacant ring. Wood has one ball to face
<B>the biggest cheer of the day</b> as Wood plonks his bat on the line of the ball!
"full length, Stokes goes deep, looking to manipulate a stroke to deep midwicket. Not this time..."
"<B>hauled across the line, brilliantly!</B> A bottom-handed shovel from so deep in the crease.... Malinga gallops but can't intercept at long-on!"
"<B>completely loses his shape on the pull but gets it away!</B> A miscued pull through backward square, and there's no-one to cut that off!"
"full toss, outside off, looking for two as the sweeper swoops, but they decide none is a better bet"
"on the toes, clipped to the leg side, this time they run, and Wood once again has a solitary ball to survive..."
"<strong>edged and it's all over!</strong> That was the perfect ball to the No. 11... full, fast, in the corridor of uncertainty... and feathered to the keeper!"
