"good short ball, and he will <strong>get four for this</strong>! Angles into Najib, who takes his eyes off the ball, and reflexively raises his gloves to guard his face. Goes off the glove/handle and runs away to the third man boundary. Wasn't a long way away from Shai Hope either. Najib has to get some medical attention given to his fingers, as he wrings his hands after that blow to the hand"
"length, and he defends from the crease"

"<strong>ooh, beauty!</strong> From around the wicket, and with a slip in place, gets one to turn and bounce from a length just outside off, and beats the outside edge"
"fuller, and he sweeps this. Gets it to the left of deep square leg, and will pick up two"
"<strong>just reward for Roston, who cuts to the Chase!</strong> Tosses this up, a bit of drift back in, and then the ball grips as Najib stretches to defend. Just runs off the outside edge, and is gleefully accepted by first slip, diving forward. Najib is stunned for a bit, and then drags himself off the crease. It's another attractive cameo from an Afghanistan batsman, which just doesn't seem to be enough during this series"
"tossed up, and he drives this towards long off. Just a bit wide of Chase in his follow-through, and a bit uppish too"
"flighted around off and middle, and he flicks this, but cannot beat mid-wicket"
