"flighted, closer to the stumps, defended coming forwards"
"pushed through wide of the stumps, Cook has to stretch as he drops back and swats a single through point"
"over the wicket, flat on the stumps, dabbed down to the leg side"
"short of a length, no pressure on the batsman as Bairstow slaps a couple behind square on the off side"
"full on off, prodded back towards mid-off"
full length and Bairstow opens the face to stab the ball square from the crease
"length, this nips back <b>and YJB chops on!</b> Silence around the ground, barely a celebration from the Windies, but they've got rid of another... Just a cameo from Bairstow, he was maybe trying to run the ball to third man and it came in at him, clipped the inside edge and then deflected off his pads on to the stumps, <i>just</i> dislodging the off bail"
"stays over the wicket, Moeen turns a length ball to the leg side"
"in the channel, shuffles across and leaves"
tossed up and defended on off stump
"slightly straighter line, worked towards midwicket"
"flat trajectory outside off, Cook opens the face and runs a single behind square"
floated up and presented with a straight bat as Moeen defends
"<b>gone, chipped into the covers!</b> Cook does lose another partner, Moeen trying to swing Chase down the ground but instead gifting his wicket away. Chase has a third and England have lost 4 for 57"
"plopped full on off, Cook defends stoically"
"a bouncer, angled down the leg side as TRJ ducks"
"full outside off, left alone"
"edged, between keeper and the slip! Length ball outside off, Roland-Jones nibbling at it, the ball dies off the edge and evades Dowrich's outstretched glove"
"short outside off, driven square of the wicket to deep point"
"full outside off, left alone"
comes forward and defends to the covers
flicked into midwicket
pushes forward to ball outside off and plays to point
across outside off and defends
fuller and pushed back to the bowler
"and again, a bottom-handed flick to Chase"
"a little shorter, tapped off the back foot"
"wide outside off, left alone"
"short outside off, cut hard into the ground and it bounces towards point"
"fuller, speared wide outside off, Cook ignores it as he has done so often"
"and again, very wide, this time Cook chases it and doesn't make contact"
"makes contact this time, late cuts but picks out the finer of two men in the backward point area"
"full, wide, slices his drive in the air but fine of backward point down to third man"
a nice piece of touch as he late-dabs this wide of slip but can't quite beat short third man
worked away from off stump to the leg side
"flicked from outside off, dribbles gently past midwicket down to long-on"
"full at the stumps, defended to cover"
"<b>he's finally out!</b> Appeal for lbw as Cook misses his flick at a pretty straight ball, given not out by Erasmus, and the <B>review</b> is called for. Looks pretty close. Has it straightened enough? No edge. It's hitting leg stump and Cook's epic is over"
"on a good length outside off, left alone"
"back of a length outside off, quite a late decision to leave it"
"fuller, hint of late swing, he's able to watch it go through"

"fuller, at middle and off, makes him play for the first time in the over and it's defended to mid-on"

"full, very wide outside off, left alone"
"touch too wide again, on a good length and carries at waist height to Bairstow"

"short of a length, slightly closer to off stump, Powell is able to drop his hands and let it through"
"very full outside off, takes the toe end into the covers"
"<b>lovely ball, and he's nicked behind!</b> It didn't take long. Anderson gets it full, just outside off, late movement away from Brathwaite who nibbles without any footwork and it's a thin edge to Bairstow"
"full, wide outside off, left alone"
huge appeal for lbw! That's the inswinger. Hope falls across the shot. They discuss the review but decide against it. Perhaps on height
"just gets this a little too full and straight, Hope gets his first Test runs with a flick off the pads through midwicket"
"full outside off, the outswinger again, a solid push through the covers"
"stays round the wicket, full outside off, left alone"
"straightens the line, a little too much, worked off the pads to long leg"
"doesn't adjust his line to the right hander, pushed down the leg side"
"a bouncer over off stump which Hope ducks...just has to be careful to get his gloves out of the way, too"
"that's a decent delivery, sharp movement back off the seam from back of a length. Left alone and it finishes almost going over off stump"
"full, wide outside off, left alone"
"angled across the left hander outside off, he may have held his bat inside the line"
"he's certainly beaten this time, fiddling away from his body at a length delivery"
worked off his hip to long leg
"it's another inducker to Hope, just back of a length, takes him high above the pad...ouch, in the delicate spot"
another big appeal for lbw! Again Erasmus says out out. Again no review. Just angling down the leg side. Hope again falling across the delivery
"length ball at off stump, defended"
"round the wicket, full outside off, left alone"
"shorter, too wide, left alone...Broad not quite getting it right so far"
"<B>dropped!</b> By Stokes, of all people. Broad gets his length right, full at off stump, Powell drives and the edge goes at chest height to Stokes in the gully and it bursts through"
across the crease and shovels a straight delivery into midwicket
"back of a length, defended to the covers"
"tight to off stump but Powell is able to leave it alone...better over from Broad, should have had a wicket"
"full outside off, nice curve away from Hope but it's just a little too wide"
"that's a good one, a touch closer to off stump and swings away to beat the outside edge"
wider and a more comfortable one to leave alone
"that went a bit wrong, very wide outside off, Bairstow gathers in front of second slip and it's called wide"
"back on the full length just outside off, Hope is able to leave it alone"
"back of a length at off stump, this one holds its line, defended towards the bowler"
"that's a beauty! Jeepers. Turns Hope around. It's full, angles in at off stump, that swings and seams away away late to beat the slightly flat-footed poke."
"full outside off, defended on the front foot into the covers and that's good awareness for the single"
"back of a length outside off, left alone"
"again he's in a bit of a tangle against the ball coming, short of a length and it nips back off the seam to take him high above the pads"
"full outside off, defended to mid-off"

"full outside off, this time he watches it go through with a little stride forward"
"full at middle and off, hint of shape into Powell, defended to mid-on"
across his crease to a length delivery and works to midwicket
"back outside off stump, shaping away on a full length, left alone"
"well played again, gets forward to a full ball and pushes just to the right of mid-off"
"round the wicket, length ball on off stump, Powell shows it a solid straight bat"
"tapped down into the covers, they take on the arm... and it would have been ever-so-tight with a direct hit! Good pick up but the throw just missed"
"ooh, past the edge from Broad, climbing from back of a length, Hope managing to play inside the line"
"fuller, maybe straightening a fraction, steered square of the wicket coming across"
"full, brings him forward, Hope punches a drive and Broad sticks a hand out to take the pace off"
"good length in the channel, doesn't need to play at it"
short of a length and worked off the hip for one more to Powell
"pitched up on off, Hope comes forwards and pushes into the covers"
"angled in a touch straighter, this doesn't swing as much and Hope works it to the on side"
"pitched up, shaping late as Hope prods down on it, squeezed into the covers for a single"
Anderson zings the ball through wide of the stumps and Powell leaves it alone
"struck on the pads, this seamed aggressively back at Powell, hit him above the knee roll though... and Erasmus shakes his head. Too high, and Hawk-Eye backs him up"
fired in straight by Broad and tucked into the leg side
on the stumps and Hope brings his bat down at an angle to clip a couple more through midwicket
"dug in, Hope clouts the pull away in front of square! He played that well... and he's forced short leg out, too"
"oh, <b>takes the edge</b> but bursts through third slip and runs for four...! Moeen didn't seem to get down quickly enough, although it might not have carried anyway. Not an easy chance but he might have done better, there"
comes across and steers the ball square
touch back of a length and Hope lines it up once again
"full outside off, Powell has a woolly woof... and is beaten! Not far from the timbers either, that, swinging in and then nipping away"
"holding its line on the stumps, defended"
"good length, Powell steps across and shoulders arms, it's perilously close once again - but I guess you have to say well-judged!"
on a length but down the leg side as the batsman flicks at it
"fuller, on middle and leg, pushed towards mid-on"
"oof, does him again, jagging away as Powell tries to take the fight, aiming a drive down the ground but beaten like a drum"
"shortish on the stumps, worked away behind square on the leg side"
"round the wicket, back of a length, 86mph and tapped down into the covers"
"Broad is just a fraction short here, gets the ball to straighten but Powell has time to play inside it"
good length in the corridor and left alone
"Broad probing away outside off, again Powell can leave it be"
"goes over the wicket now and pitches the ball up, it's on the pads though and Powell can crisply clip four through midwicket to go into double-figures"
"touch short, Hope doesn't miss out and slaps four in front of square. He's been positive, when possible, which is a good sign for WI"
pitched up and Hope gets a couple more with a prod through the covers
"shaping in and then straightening around off, defended watchfully this time"
fuller and swinging but this started wide and Hope can watch it go through

angled in straighter and flicked behind square for a couple more

"back of a length, wobbling on its way through as Hope draws his bat away at the last moment"
"over the wicket, Anderson hits a length on off, the ball doesn't budge and Powell defends"
"sidles in and hits slightly short length outside off, touch of nibble away into the gloves of Bairstow as Powell feels for it"
"back of a length on leg stump, flicked off the pads behind square"
"shortish, 80mph and drifting leg side, Hope works it to the man at midwicket"
"length, slightly wide in the channel, prodded towards point"
"feisty, rearing off a length, <b>clips the shoulder of the bat and flies to gully!</b> Hope has been blasted out by an absolute ripsnorter from Anderson! Stokes this time holds on without drama, it was a straightforward catch after the ball had kicked like Buckaroo and taken Hope completely by surprise. He battled through admirably last night but couldn't do too much with that"
"pitched up and slamming into the pads, <b>Broad is charging off on a celebrappeal...</b> but not given! Umpire Ravi thinks it was sliding down the leg side, Joe Root confers with his bowler and decides to <b>review</b>. That moved a fair way in the air, completely did for Powell, but I think it's going to be clipping at best - yep, close but no cigar, Ravi's decision stands, Broad shakes his head in frustration and England lose a review"
"round the wicket, hits a length and blocked securely"
a touch straighter and worked to the leg side
drifting on to the pads and worked away through square leg for a couple
"angled in and tapped down towards mid-on, Powell calls for the single - but it's a risk, direct hit! Gone, run out by a yard! Calamitous stuff from West Indies and they've lost two in two overs... It was a good throw from Anderson but Powell really misjudged that"
"over the wicket, touch short on off and worked down into the leg side"
pitched up wide of the stumps and Chase watches it through
"full, closer to off, Anderson still getting some swing, Chase reaches out and pokes towards point"

"angled in on the stumps, tucked to the leg side"
"pitched up and holding its line outside off, lets this one go"
"nip-backer from Anderson, <b>thudding into the pads</b>... but there's an inside edge involved! The appeal died on the lips as Erasmus shook his head"
"good length outside off, Hope covers the line and pushes square"
"fullish, a foot or so outside off, Hope gets forward and shoulders arms"
"ooh, close to the edge, rising from a length and just murmuring away as Hope stayed back and prodded at it"
"fired in fuller and straighter, blocked"
"length ball, 83mph and curling away, no stroke and Bairstow can't take it cleanly as the ball dips away from him late"
"pitched up and fading in this time, Hope blocks resolutely towards gully"
"Anderson goes full in the channel, Chase isn't taking any chances and props forward to defend"
"that's asking questions, banged in short and whizzing through past the ears as Chase jerks out of the way"
"slung down on off stump, hits the bat hard as Chase defends from the crease"
"full length, holding its line outside off, left alone this time"
"<b>bowled 'im!</b> Precision stuff from Anderson, decking back in off a perfect length, Chase can't get his bat down quite in time and edges on to his stumps... The pink ball pops the bails and England are right amongst 'em, here"
"fullish length in the corridor, Blackwood shuffles across and leaves well alone"
"beats the edge again, scrambled seam from Broad, zipping through as Hope plays hopefully from the crease"
"pitched up on off stump, covers the line and blocks solidly enough"
"oof, that's thudded into the splice, a really demanding length from Broad, kept out bravely"
"full and drawing the stroke, bit of a woolly woof from Hope and he fails to connect"
"good length, angled in and defended to the off side"
"length on off stump, Hope watchfully blocks into the covers - and that's another maiden for Broad"
"fullish length around off stump, presses forward to block"
"rising off a length, edged into the off side... but it lands safely! Not dissimilar to the ball that did for Hope but he managed to fend it squarer and into a gap"
runs for West Indies! Blackwood likes to play his shots and gets this away through cover point for a couple
"straighter line, tapped down to the leg side"
"full length around off, stoutly defended coming forwards"
"touch short and Blackwood stabs a drive in front of square off the back foot, neatly done and it races all the way to the rope, a rare boundary to bring up the West Indies 50"
"climbing through outside off, Bairstow has to take this in front of his face as Hope shoulders arms"
"good length in the channel, decent carry for Broad but again Hope doesn't have to play"

gets across his stumps to block
"full length and shading in towards the timbers, firmly pushed back along the carpet to mid-off"
"fired in on a length, 85mph and this is an awkward line, Hope hit on the gloves, I think, as he jabs it down"
"blam! Blackwood spanks a straight drive back down the ground from TRJ's first ball...! No respect for the loosener, it was overpitched and there to be hit, so Blackwood did"
"length ball, holding its line outside off, lets this one go"
"full and wide, 83mph and Blackwood chase a drive, inside-edges <i>just</i> past his stumps! They hare back for a tight second, too, but in the end he comfortably beats the throw"
"ooh, that's a teaser, whispering past the outside edge! Short enough to leave but Blackwood was drawn into following it"
"drops short and this wangs away towards the slips, called wide"
"touch full, Blackwood plays a check drive... and it rattles away through vacant mid-off for four more! Lovely timing on that, just a push but the ball just picked up pace over the slick outfield"
"good length, 133kph/81mph in the channel, holding its line and left alone"
"good length, curving back in late but not close enough to make him play"

"short of a length over the stumps, tucked towards midwicket"
"back of a length and there's width for the batsman, Blackwood steers a couple more through backward point"

banged in at the body and worked into the leg side to keep the strike
"full on middle and leg, punched to mid-on"
pitched up and Blackwood's arms are a blur of kinetic activity but his drive is mistimed and bobbles to mid-on again
"angled in and this swings a touch and then nips to clip the inside edge, running away through backward square leg for a single"
"good length on off from TRJ, 80mph and blocked back to the bowler"
"<b>timber! Hope plays on</b>, Roland-Jones breaks the (brief) resistance and West Indies are five down... An ill-advised shot, given the circumstances his team were in, trying to drive on the up and there was enough seam movement to mean the ball ended up cannoning into the stumps off the inside edge"
"good length at off stump, he's squared up a little as he defends to point"
works this neatly off the stumps through midwicket
"smashes into the helmet! A bouncer angles back at Blackwood as he turns his head away, takes his eye off the ball, and it clatters into the side of the helmet. He says he's okay, the England players immediately ask, and the physio comes out"
"short outside off stump, poor delivery and a poor follow-up, flayed through the covers"
"straightens the line onto off stump, it's a fuller, takes the splice as he defends"
"fuller again, closes the face and works it into the square-leg area"
"another short ball, on off stump, Dowrich tries to ride the bounce and it glances off his arm towards the slips as he drops his hands"

"<B>that's stone dead lbw!</b> Gets it full and straight, that actually straightens off the seam and beats the outside edge as Dowrich shapes to play towards mid-on and that's clattering off stump."
"short of a length, Blackwood turns it into the leg side"
"that's another nice shot, but it's again too short, he flicks this off his body and gets it fine of long leg"

"full outside off, he stretches forward and defends"
drives a full delivery to deep point
"<B>caught behind after a review!</b> Another one past the outside edge, and Bairstow is convinced he's nicked it! The <b>review</b> is called for. Moeen certainly wasn't sure. There are spikes on Ultra Edge - although did they quite match up? - and this is overturned! Holder isn't impressed. Bat was nowhere near the ground or the pad. Noise can't have been anything else"
"a flamboyant start by Roach as he square drives a full, wide delivery through backward point"
this spins back nicely from outside off as Roach leaves it alone

"fuller, in the channel, Joseph belts a back-foot drive straight to cover"
"fired in at the stumps, hits the pads and <b>up goes the finger!</b> Joseph misses playing across the line, pinned like a gigantic butterfly on the crease... That looked plumb and S Ravi agreed with Broad, who was off and running in familiar fashion before glancing round to have it confirmed. West Indies still have two reviews left but Joseph doesn't even bother to burn one"

"pitched up on off stump, Brathwaite covers the line and defends square"

pitched up and blocked softly into the off side
too full and straight and flicked off the pads wideo fine leg for a couple
"dug in short and Hope smokes a pull over midwicket for four! Touch of the old West Indian disdain for English bowling in that blow, hopping into line and landing a real haymaker"
"full again, better line and it's punched back to the bowler"

"fuller, he nearly has a fiddle at it but think he just withdrew his bat at the last moment"
"<b>full, straight and given lbw!</b> After a long talk, Hope calls for the <b>review</b> out of, well, hope. It has angled back in a little, Hope plays around it, but it's umpire's call on clipping leg stump. Not plumb, but out enough with it being given on the field by S Ravi"
"short of a length at off stump, he hops back in the crease and defends to midwicket"

another one is dabbed into the backward point area
gets his front foot across outside off stump and defends
"<B>edged, sharp catch at second slip!</b> Stokes has found some good rhythm in this spell, but it's a loose poke outside off, really. Was just short of a good length, but quite wide, Hope hangs his bat out and the edge is grabbed by the captain"

"shorter, still, played off the back foot into the covers"
"short, angled down the leg side, not a million miles from touching the bat or gloves"
"<B>dropped, technically!</b> Or maybe fairer to call it a chance. Off the face of the bat towards short leg, Stoneman can't stay low and grab it. Chase gets off the pair. He came up a little quickly, and the catch was very low to the ground"

full and driven back to the bowler
"<b>playing back and he's lbw on the stroke of tea!</b> A huge appeal was given not out by S Ravi and England call the <b>review</b>, Moeen was very confident. Brathwaite was a long way across his crease, similar to how Moeen removed Amla a few weeks ago. There's no bat involved. It's three reds! Hitting leg stump full on"

"darted in on off stump, blocked from the crease"
fullish and defended coming forwards

"Blackwood dances down early, Moeen fires it flat and wide and through to the keeper, <b>who completes a smart stumping!</b> They've got Blackwood this time, feeding on his attacking instincts and then cannily bowled, leaving the batsman stranded by a good few inches as he threw himself back for the crease"
"yeow, that's close to the edge! Back of a length and then holding its line with Chase playing back, eliciting half an appeal from behind the stumps but Broad indicates he didn't hear anything"

"length, holding its line outside off, Chase shoulders arms"
"pushed in towards the top of off, 87mph as Broad bends his back, pushed towards mid-on"
"<b>shoots on low, into the pads - Chase has been done!</b> Easy decision for Marais Erasmus, Broad gets his wicket and moves within one of levelling up Ian Botham... Chase might have come forward but couldn't then get his bat down as it seamed in at him"
"<b>gone first ball!</b> Broad is off and running again, no need to check with the umpire this time... A beauty holding its line on off and Holder can only steer it low to first slip! He's level with Botham and on a hat-trick!"
"good length on off - and Roach blocks it! Kemar holds his nerve, defends from the crease, and the crowd is denied a pink-trick to cap off their evening"

Roach gets across and blocks stoutly
"spinning down the leg side this time, really smart grab by Bairstow and he then motions for the stumping... but Roach hadn't moved"
pitched up and blocked into the covers
"<b>bowled him, neck and crop!</b> That went through Dowrich like a battering ram, seaming in to smash the top of off stump - and it <b>moves Broad clear of Botham as England's second-leading Test wicket-taker!</b> Anderson and Broad are together at the top of the pile"

flighted and spinning to leg as Roach flicks it away behind square
"tossed up on the stumps, blocked"
"flat delivery outside off, pushed towards point with an open face"
"trundles in, bangs the ball short over the stumps, tucked to the leg side"
"Roach pushes at one in the channel, there's a muted appeal from behind the stumps... and Root then decides to <b>review</b>. Roland-Jones didn't think there was an edge, but we know from experience that's not much of an indicator; this time, however, his instincts are proved right by Ultra Edge, and on we go"
"good length, defended from the crease"

"full outside off, driven to mid-off"
"back of a length at off stump, compactly defended towards mid-on"
"a touch wider, he's across the crease plays to cover"
tucked off his pads to square leg
"<b>that does the job, full and straight.</b> Very similar to the first-innings dismissal, Roach misses his drive and the stumps are clattered"
"full and straight, he gets behind the line and plays to the bowler"
"length ball outside off, defended to cover"
"edged, but doesn't quite reach Anderson at fourth slip...was a full ball which he drove at, slicing across the ball"
"a waft outside off stump, a couple of the slips though there was an edge"
"<B>edged to slip, and that's the win to England</b>. In the channel outside off, excellent line, the outside edge carries low to Stokes who grabs it down to his right"
