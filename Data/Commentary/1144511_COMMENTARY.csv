"bouncer at middle stump, ducks and to let it go"
"short at the ribs, gets on top of it and whips this to the long leg boundary. Closed his eyes on it, but perfect connection"
<b>pumped over wide long-on!</b> Full and just outside off. Hangs on the back foot and merely lifts the bat from underneath it. Goes a long way for what looks a chip at best
"<b>stunning take</b> from Latham. Length ball pushed across off stump, swings and misses. This keeps moving away, towards first slip. Latham dives one-handed to hold it"
"short and just outside off, mistimed pull to mid-on"
slower short ball climbing up at middle stump. Looks to pull and cops this on his body. Was through that before it arrived
short of a length at off stump. Looks to cut. Under-edges into the off side
"length on leg stump, flicked straight to midwicket"
<b>taken by Latham!</b> Superb bouncer from Boult catches Pooran completely out of position for the pull. It's short and rising steeply in the corridor. He leaps and looks to hook. The top-edge is right above the keeper
"length at middle stump, tapped to midwicket"
"<b>sweet!</b> Full on middle stump and he leans in at this without letting his head fall over. And then, wonderful wrists to flick this past midwicket. Sprints to the boundary"
"length on leg stump, flicked to fine leg's right"
"short of a length in the corridor, defended off the back foot"
"<b>dropped by Boult, who generally holds onto impossible catches!</b> What an effort. Short ball cramps him on the full. He ends up slicing it. Boult runs backward from short fine and dives backwards as well. But can only parry it into the boundary"
<b>no catching this.</b> Short again but more room this time. Outside off. Spanked over long-on
"<b>top edge</b> over the long leg boundary! Short again, cramped again, no control again on the pull. But it's runs yet again. Henry has paid twice now for bowling short without fine leg back"

"bouncer, very short and wide outside off. Left alone"
"short of a length at off stump, opens the face and drops it in front of short third"
"length on off stump, blocked on the front foot"
<b>a work of genius.</b> A near-Natmeg inadvertently from Gayle. Boult nails the yorker at leg stump and Gayle jams down at it with his back leg raise. Inside edge runs fine

"short at off stump, nicely behind the line and swiped with vigour to the midwicket boundary"
"<b>miscued pull</b> but safely over mid-on. Short at off, stuck on the front foot as he looks to pull and it hits the high part of the bat and clears the fielder"

"length on off stump, defended on the front foot"
"short of a length on off, defended off the back foot"
"<b>beats the fielder again!</b> Short of a length and he climbs into it. This time a touch under the ball and on the front foot, but a clean swing nonetheless to find the midwicket boundary"
<b>superb.</b> What a talent this guy. Length outside off and he gets his weight on the front foot to slap through the line and beat deep cover's dive to the left
<b>beats the edge.</b> Short and slanted across off stump. Looks to poke at it. Ball fizzes by before he knows it
"length on middle stump, dropped in front of extra cover with soft hands"

"yorker down leg side, can't get bat on the flick"

"length on off stump, pushed through cover off the back foot"
"length outside off, pokes to extra cover's left on the up"

"length on leg stump, flicked to square leg off the inside half"
"short at middle stump, dropped into the covers with soft hands"

"short of a outside off, left alone"
"short and just outside off, pulled uppishly out to deep midwicket"
"short in the corridor, left alone"
short of a length and nipping back in towards off stump. Beats the inside edge as he shapes to cut

"back of a length and very straight, defended from the crease, almost casually"
"<b>smack</b>. This guy is seriously talented. Too short, and he stays still, transfers weight back and pulls it mightily to deep midwicket"
"and another! Too short again and he pulls this from in front of his face to deep square leg. Just to show he can hit boundaries in front of, and behind, square"
"corrects the length to go fuller, and is pushed with soft hands to mid-off for a quick single"
"length ball angling across, Gayle is like a statue, watching it go past"
"back of a length angling across again, Gayle lazily cuts it to the man on the sweeper cover boundary"
"quicker on on the stumps, patted back with a horizontal bat"
"in his arc, and out of the park! Well not quite out of the park, but clears the boundary at deep midwicket. Fuller on the stumps and he swings it high and mighty"
"<b>oh what you have done Matt Henry!</b> dropped a sitter at deep square leg. Filthy ball, full toss on leg stump, Gayle swung it without a care in the world. Henry was right there. Ball pops in and out"
"length ball, pushed to mid-off"
"fuller outside off, defended"
"<b>two dropped chances in the same over!</b> what is happening? Gayle is unconcerned about the previous drop, swings for the fences again off a fuller ball on the stumps. Goes midwicket direction, and Munro is running in, gets both hands to it at chest height, but somehow can't hold on and the ball trickles over the fence. Tough chance, but he had got there"
"length ball outside off, pushed into the offside"
"another length ball, punched back firmly"

worked to square leg
"fuller on the stumps, driven gently along the ground to long-on"
<b>top edge lands in no-man's land</b>. Santner has his hands on his knees and head down. He's got to buy the opposite of a lottery ticket today. Hetmyer went to slog sweep this and got the top edge. It lands perfectly between the circle and the men on the deep
"great ball to start, yorker on leg stump, Hetmyer somehow keeps it out, almost falling over"
"<b>oh this is just superb hitting</b>. Short ball, he rocks back and just swings - not pulls, swings - across the line to smite this over square leg. Raises <b>fifty</b>"
"another leg stump yorker, but he was giving himself room so is able to hoick it along the ground to fine leg. Not quite a Natmeg, but something in between"
"slower ball fools him. Pitched it back of a length and Gayle thought it was going down leg, so was letting it go, but by the time he was bringing his bat down is when the ball reached him and hits his bat to drop down on the ground"
"fuller on the stumps, pushed towards mid-off, and they take a quick single"
"was clearing his front leg, but Lockie bowled a yorker on the fifth stump. Hetmyer's so well balanced though that he has little trouble adjusting and steering to short third man"
"length ball angling into him from around the wicket to deny room, punched back"
"good length outside off, strokes it to cover's right"
"another length ball outside off, this time Gayle stays on the back foot and opens the face to steer it to point's right"
"fuller that time outside off, a mite slower, Gayle goes to drive, but gets a bottom edge into the offside. That also seems to have broken off a chunk of wood at the bottom of Gayle's bat, so he'll be changing it"
"<b>new bat, same result</b>. A bit too short by CdG, and sticks to the outside off line which gives Gayle room to cut powerfully through point"
"better length, not as short and closer to offstump, steered to third man"
"<b>he's castled him</b>. Back of a length but it kept low. Hetmyer was going to smash this into oblivion, but the ball sneaks in under his bat and knocks off the bails. Lockie is pumped. He had bowled this at 128k too, so that might have had something to do with it"
"<b>got him first ball</b> and Lockie is breathing fire into New Zealand's defence. This was a full-length one outside off, and Holder, whose feet aren't really moving well yet, had a waft at it. Got a feather through to the keeper."
"bowls a quick bouncer for his hat-trick ball, but Brathwaite gets behind it and defends from in front of his grille"
"<b>outside edge goes for four despite deflection</b>. It was 146kph, squared up Brathwaite totally, angling into him and he played inside the line. Got an edge that bounced to slip, who dived and parried it. Despite that, the ball travelled to the boundary behind the keeper"
"shortish, goes deep in his crease and defends to midwicket"
"short outside off, but dealt with better by Brathwaite, who stays beside the ball and steers it to point. 146kph"
"given room to cut and he does so, but point dives and fields."
"fuller on the fourth stump, driven to cover"
"Gayle reminds us all he's still there. Very full, and he just takes a front foot stride and smacks a lofted drive into the extra cover fence"
"has a waft at this one too and gets an edge! but it doesn't carry to short third man. This was not as full, CdG has pulled the length back, but Gayle went for the drive anyway"
"length ball on the pads and paddled to fine leg. ,b>Gayle runs two!</b>"
"<b>ho ho ho, this is Collapso Time</b>. Gayle probably thought he needed to hit West Indies out of pressure, so went for another six down the ground. Didn't middle it, got it off the toe-end. He's hit mis-timed sixes before, but this is not one of those times. The ball goes high and settles into long-on's hands. West Indies have imploded."
"<b>shot!</b> a full toss outside off, but it needed to be put away and Carlos cover drives it handsomely"
"length ball on the stumps, tucked towards square leg"
"length ball, bounces a tad higher than expected, takes the shoulder of the bat from his half-cock push to roll to point"
"<b>lovely</b>. That's a sparkling cover drive. Round the wicket and full outside off, opens the face of the bat while driving"
"quick one, jabs at it and keeps it down close to him. They're alive to the possibility of a quick single"
"length ball on the pads, flicked to midwicket"
"fired in to him, moves back to cut, gets an under-edge that goes to short fine"
"slightly more tossed up, draws him forward to defend"
"flatter on off, goes down to sweep. Doesn't get hold of it, the ball rolls to short fine"
"nice length, pitches and turns away, he comes on the front foot to defend"
"quicker one, 96kph, and he has to go back and get his bat down in a hurry to chop at it and keep it away from the stumps"
"good length again, tossed up slower, but he comes on the front foot and defends well. <b>Maiden</b>"
"length ball on off, tucks it to the legside"
"<b>caught behind off the short ball</b> another great take by Latham, who's been impressive today behind the stumps. Boult put his back into this, short ball on the leg stump, cramping him for room. Nurse couldn't resist having a go at trying to pull, but gets a glove that flies to Latham's left, who tumbles and holds."
strays well down legside and he'll have to rebowl that
"short of a length outside off, goes to cut, gets an under-edge that bounces past the stumps"
"yorker on the stumps, Lewis digs it out. And then hobbles. Bad signs for him and West Indies"
"short ball, and Lewis pulls it straight to the man at deep square leg. Can't really fault him. Given his injured hamstring, all he could do was look for boundaries. Tried, and failed"
"full toss outside off, think that's a yorker gone wrong. Gets behind it and steers to point"
"flatter outside off, whipped to mid-on"
"beaten him! perfect ball, loops and draws him forward, dips and lands in front and spins sharply away"
"tossed up again, but defended"
"more loop but a bit fuller, so he can come on the front foot and drive to the man on sweeper cover"
"flatter, but he stays back and jabs it out"
"shortens his length because he sees Roach is intent on pressing forward, spins across him but he manages to keep it down"
that's pinged him on the grille. On target short ball that lifts nastily and he's not quick enough to get his head out of the way or get his bat in the way
"follows it with a length ball, Brathwaite is hanging slightly back, defends from the crease"
"fullish length slower ball, Brathwaite holds his shape nicely enough though he doesn't time the drive well. Mid-on collects"

"short ball rising up to his chest, awkwardly jabbed to deep cover"
"length ball outside off, he follows it with his hands and pushes to point"

"fuller on the pads, clipped to long-on"
"tossed up, fuller on the stumps, takes a stride out to drive it back to the bowler"
"that spat out of the footmarks. Gives it some revs and lands it on the spot, it takes off and spins past a suprised Brathwaite's shoulder almost"
"fuller driven to the bowler's left, he slides and stops"
"length ball outside off, steps away and has a big slash at it. Travels in the air but lands safe, and CdG runs around from third man to slide and stop the ball"
"back of a length on the stumps, he goes up on his toes to defend it"
"a bit fuller but not there for the drive. He chose to try and drive it anyway, gets a thick inside edge that rolls to midwicket"
"sharp bouncer, on target. Forced the batsman to sway out of the way, since it was homing in on his head"
"fuller on off, driven fluently but straight to mid-off"
"back of a length on the stumps, stays back and glides it to third man"
"<b>that's got air miles on it</b> tossed up very full, he takes a big stride out and swings through the line to send this waaaaay over long-on. 96m six"
"fuller outside off, driven to extra cover"
"good length on middle and leg spinning away, gets forward to block"
he can't resist having a swipe at that and nails it! Goes down on one knee and lifts this from outside off over long-off

"length outside off, stylish drive on the up to find extra cover"
"length on leg stump, defended into the leg side on the front foot"
<b>missed run-out chance</b> at the non-strikers. Brathwaite looks to drive past mid-off and is admiring his shot as Williamson picks it up to his left. Roach has run down the pitch in the meantime and is stranded. Needed a direct hit. Didn't get one
"length at leg stump, glanced off the hips through square leg"
"length at off stump, dropped into the covers off the back foot"
"<b>144 kph bouncer</b> is too much for everyone. Climbs steeply over the very tall batsman, and the keeper has no chance either"

"short of a length and ripping away from off, thick outside edge to short third"
"quicker one at a length, cramping him on off stump. Forces him to push back down the pitch"
"<b>edged!</b> And the bowling change brings the wicket at last for New Zealand. Kemar Roach, so impressive until no, but he chases this one outside off. No feet. It's a thin edge and his resistance ends. This is short of a length and climbing outside off. Too fast for his waft away from the body"
"length at middle stump, hops and defends to midwicket"
"length on middle stump, defended to mid-on"
full and just outside off. Driven to mid-off
"short of a length just outside off, stabbed down to third man"
<b>past the keeper</b> and four. A hint of conviction in this four off the outside edge - the face was opened late. Ball straightened in the corridor from a good length

<b>outside edge</b> safely past slip. This turns big from middle stump as he pushes forward with hard hands

"length on off stump, defended into the covers"
"length at off stump, defended to point"
"<b>collision avoided</b> as Neesham and Santner run for the ball in the covers. Cottrell had just dropped it pitch side and the run out chance was on. In the end, neither got the ball. But more importantly, they've avoided some pain"
<b>overthrow</b> as Santner picks up the ball this time and throws at the striker's end. No one backing up for that particular angle so <b>Brathwaite can get the run that brings him his fifty.</b> This is a seriously good knock from him
"length outside off, opens the face and gets it down to third man"
"short and wide outside off, slaps it past short third man with a big swing"
"length on off stump, gently poked to extra cover's left with soft hands"
"short of a length on off stump, defended off the back foot"
<b>falls short</b> of short third man. Length ball turning away outside off. Cottrell throws his hands at it and gets a leading edge to clear slip
"length on leg stump, whipped to long-on and <B>Cottrell sprints back for the second!</b> Lovely running and game awareness"
<b>Cottrell sends him back</b> and it is the right call. Brathwaite was ready to run after defending this into the off side. But it was a quicker one and it pinged quickly towards point. It was trouble if they'd gone
"full and just outside off, poked to extra cover off the toe-end"
"bouncer in the corridor, awkwardly ducks, but sufficiently out of the way"
"short of a length on leg stump, gets inside the line and has a whip at it. And connects! This races to the fine leg boundary"

short and in at the body. Inside edge onto body
"slower ball at a length outside off, carved out to sweeper on the up"
"<b>off the pad</b> but won't get past Latham who dives to his left. Length ball on leg stump, shuffles and has a swing at it. Can't get bat"
"<b>through him!</b> Is that it? Lockie using that pace of his to fire one in full, angling in off the pitch, beating the inside edge and smashing the stumps"
"<b>pumps it past the stumps!</b> Right, there won't be any more hanging about. Length ball just outside off, clears the front leg and hammers it on the rise. Mid-off is in. No one stopping this"
<b>pulled to deep square's left</b> and Oshane has actually though about staying in the crease at the other end! All good in the end as the fielder has to recover and there's time to complete the second
<b>lovely stop from Williamson!</b> Gets big and flaps out his left hand as he slides to stop this on the half-volley mid-off. Brathwaite cleared the front leg and sliced this to his left. The stop means Oshane is on strike.
"length on off stump, solidly defended on the front foot"
"<b>well played.</b> Dipping in at his leg stump is this mean yorker, but he manages to get the bat down on it"
"<b>that's the end of Boult.</b> Oshane has done it. He's played three balls from the best bowler on the day. What a spell from Boult, but he couldn't get this last inswinger past Oshane's push to mid-on"
"<b>follows him down leg side</b> with the full ball. Powerfully driven to long-on, no run taken"
"<b>just misses off stump.</b> Legcutter at a length, dug in, spins past Brathwaite's swing"
"<b>smokes it over the long-off boundary!</b> Fast and overpitched just outside off. Makes room and creams it from underneath. Mid-off was in, there was hardly any risk. Lovely batting"
"length outside off, pushed to point with an open face"
"short ball at middle stump, backs away and pulls to midwicket's right. <b>Takes the run</b>"
<b>147kph</b> but it's a full toss. And Oshane offers the full face and gratefully plays this out
<b>miscued pull</b> but he has managed to drag it to deep square's right. Too early through this shot as he tries to drag the short ball from wide outside off
"<b>clears long-on!</b> Flat-bats it and hardly gets height on this, but he's got plenty of distance. Literally swipes from above waist height"
<b>and another!</b> It is no longer a clear New Zealand advantage! Low full toss wide outside off. Reaches out and gets bat - just enough bat - to get it to land on the padding at deep backward point!
"<b>it is too full! It is too far outside off!</b> Knee high full toss with lots of width and he smokes it over wide long-off! Unreal. How does he keep finding himself in these situations, and doing this? Three in a row."
"<b>top edge clears the wicketkeeper!</b> Hear in the mouth, but he fortune is all his, it seems! Bouncer cramps him at the chest. He has no control over this shot. But it's trickled through to the third man boundary. <b>24 off the over!</b>"
<b>lofted to third man's right</b> and he will keep strike! Short outside off and he holds his composure
"short of a length outside off, watchfully tapped to extra cover"
<b>beaten!</b> Whew. Short and wide outside off. Backs away and has a swipe but it some distance away from connection
<b>beaten again.</b> Short and wide outside off. Once again he's gone for the pull. Misses again
"<b>pulls out to deep midwicket</b> and comes back for the second! What. An. Innings. He doesn't get to do a lot very often, down at No. 8. But every time he finds himself in this situation, he shines through. <b>A maiden ODI hundred.</b> An unlikely win in sight. Takes his helmet off, blows a kiss. Back to it."
"legcutter, short and spinning past off stump as he shapes to pull and is deceived again. Beaten. <b>This is a great over from Neesham</b>"
"<b>has he done it? No!</b> Boult plucks it at long-on! Two drops for Boult since the last game, but he's held on when it's mattered! They're checking for no-ball...<b>it's well behind the line.</b> This is heartbreak for Brathwaite. So close. Short ball at middle, he pulled it, but slightly from under again. Ended up slicing it, with no room. It was to Boult's right. He leaped, he held on, he balanced on his right foot. That is solid work under pressure. Both batsmen on their knees, and then Brathwaite gets up with a smile. He did his all, and then some. But it was always unlikely. And you feel like he knows that. Smiles from his opponents as they offer their commiserations. It's all shakes. It could have so easily been the other way round..."
