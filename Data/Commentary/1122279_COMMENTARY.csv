"hangs back against a good length ball and chops it to cover. He risks the single, but gets through, beating one of India's better fielders - Pandya"
"<b>doesn't pick the googly</b> and that makes it all the more special for Kuldeep. He pitches the ball a shade short, on and around off stump - step one of the plan. Step two depends on the batsman. If he spots the variation, he would play with a straight bat. Duminy doesn't. He thinks he can cut it away for runs. And the moment, he gets in position for that, he's in danger. Making things worse for him is that the ball skids through fairly low and knocks middle back middle stump"

"<b>Kohli claims the catch</b> and now it's over to the umpires. Ian Gould's soft signal is out. Lets see. Replays show conclusively that he's right. Good effort from the Indian captain, diving forward and scooping the ball up just as it dies on him. But the better one was from Kuldeep, in the way he drew Miller forward, forcing him to play away from the body. Beautiful work from the wristspinner, bowling slow and backing himself to beat his opponents in the air"
"full and outside off, he drives to mid-off"
pitches it up a shade outside off and there is just enough seam off the pitch that a nervous du Plessis gets an inside edge onto pad

shot. Morris has hit so many sweet-sounding punches today for hardly any runs. The one that finally fetches him a four is not so well connected. But it gets him four. Picks the length early and plays a short arm pull over midwicket
expertly done by Faf. Allows the ball to come in with the angle and tickles it wide of short fine off middle stump. Bumrah gives chase and leaves the dive too late. Would have done damage to himself if he went in when he thought about it. Let it go in the end
"good length on middle stump, dabbed to short fine and now the steal a single from Bumrah"

"full and in at middle stump, driven to long-on on the up"

misses his length on the yorker and Faf makes easy work of it with his stride. It becomes a full toss that he duly taps wide of sweeper cover

"back of a length at off stump, flicked to midwicket off the back foot"
"Faf stretches his hamstrings, Kohli saves his face, and then Bumrah nearly lobs one into Pandya's nose. This is a very short and very wide ball outside off.

"short ball outside off, drags it against the turn to deep square's left with a pull"

"full outside off, leans in and places this drive wonderfully to long-off's left"
<b>shot of the tour.</b> This is glorious. Kuldeep floats another one up outside off. Morris reaches out and doesn't reach the pitch of it with a big stride. Stays leg side of it and creams it wide of long-off
"good length on leg stump, pushed to square leg off the back foot"
"oh he should be fined half his IPL contract for that shot. Morris has looked completely assured, but he's completely missed this. It's a full toss on off stump, prime for a flogging anywhere in front of the stumps. But he's made a decision early to sweep. He's also through the shot much before the ball arrives. It all looks very ugly in the end, as the ball lands on the crease, spins in and tonks off stump. That looked a bit like someone was learning video game controls"

yorker again. Taken on the full and driven out to long-off with the toe end of the bat. Kohli fumbles but recovers quickly enough

"good length on off stump, defended into the covers"
<b>taken by de Kock.</b> An ugly hoick from Rohit. Length ball at off stump is always going to to rise when it's Morkel bowling. Rohit goes across the line and it sits in the pitch slightly.

"back of a length just outside off, guided to third man"
"<b>inside edge saves Dhawan from the lbw but Markram has lit the stumps up at the other end to run him out!</b> Dhawan is unhappy with his partner. He's six yards short. He was looking to flick this behind square with the angle and narrowly escaped being caught right in front of middle stump because of an inside edge. In the mean time, Kohli tried to steal a single as the ball rolled pitch side into the off side. Two people in the game are still alive to the possibilities at this point - Kohli at the non-strikers end and Markram at point. Dhawan isn't ready for this run but Kohli is already halfway down. In the frenzy of the noise and the visuals, he decides to run because he doesn't seem to have a choice. Markram picks up with one hand and finishes the throw perfectly"

"good length just outside off, tapped to point on the up"
"good length outside off, defended to point on the front foot"

"full outside off, driven to sweeper's right. Rahane respons to the call for the second. Morris' right thumb collides with the stumps and he's in some discomfort. On his feet now...oh in fact it's the ball that flicks the top of his thumb. Yikes."

"full on middle stump, clipped to deep square leg"
"attacks the top of off stump, but finds Rahane in the way"
"<b>risky</b>, with gully in place, and the ball only barely beats the man diving to his left. The short ball cramps Rahane, but he sways out of its way and attempts to carve it to third man. Such risk for a single run. Perhaps he thought the ball would bounce more..."
"strides forward to a back of a length delivery and as a result, he has to yank his bottom hand off to drive through cover"
presses forward and drills a good length perfectly straight down the pitch. Almost connected the two sets of stumps
"<b>whoa!</b>! That's a spectacular passage of play. Starts with a sensational straight drive, the full face of the bat meeting a perfectly good ball on off stump.

bangs it in short and Rahane stays away from it
has to leap up off his feet to ride the bounce of this short delivery outside off.
"walks into the drive, and he realises he might be a little early on the shot and so does his best to check the push to cover. It's all in the wrist"
"steers it, having waited what seems like an age for the ball to come to him, away to third man."

<b>keeps low</b> and Kohli is able to jab the (straight) bat down in time to save his off stump
defends a good length ball outside off to point
"the intention is to pick up a single, but hey, if you time it that well, the game gives you a bit more. He keeps coming at the bowler, walks at him, and so Morris indulges in a slower ball. It ends up overpitched and Kohli drills it to the right of mid-off"
nudges the back of a length delivery towards short midwicket
"all hands as he sends a ball just back of a length and outside off away to long-on. Pulling off a shot like that is in the balance, and hand-eye coordination"

walks into the shot as he drives to long-on
lunges forward to the pitch of the ball on off stump and directs it with a closed face to long-on
"ventures out of his crease again but it's premeditated movement and as such the bowler can adjust. Duminy bowls quicker, pulls his length back, cramps Rahane and forces him to inside edge through midwicket"

"fullish on middle at 139 kph, Kohli defends"
"<b>nearly rolls onto the stumps</b>! And there's the possibility of a run-out as well! Kohli finds himself in the firing line of a short delivery on leg stump. He chops it down, looking for a quick single, but has to stop to make sure the ball rolls past his sticks. In that time, the single becomes a no-go and Rahane communicates that appropriately"
"superb pull shot, getting on top of the bounce and rolling his wrists to keep it down. And this isn't a dibbly dobbly bouncer. It's coming up at his throat"
"another fast, fierce bouncer at 143 kph. Rahane looks a little awkward as he pulls to deep square leg"
nudges a good length ball through midwicket
"141kph, walks at the fast bowler, who digs it in short again. Kohli swivels on the pull and finds a single to long leg"
