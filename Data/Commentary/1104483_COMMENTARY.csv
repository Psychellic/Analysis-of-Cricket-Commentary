"a touch fuller than the previous one, Masakadza leaves again"
"straightens his line and gets it to nip past Masakadza's defensive shot to hit pad. Probably going down leg. Nice length, trapped him on the crease"
"another appeal. This one's a touch fuller, pitches outside off, and nips in. Sri Lanka have reviewed Llong's not-out decision. Masakadza pressed forward, but not a big stride in defence. He's still on the move, and his bat is slightly behind pad while he plays this. Looks like pad first... Is he struck in line? Is it maybe slightly high? Umpire's call on impact, and umpire's call on projected path - ball-tracking says it'll clip the top of the off bail"

"ooh, beauty. Turn and bounce, after dipping onto a beautiful length on middle stump. Presses forward to defend and he's beaten comprehensively"
"bowled him, and that's an absolute beaut. The arm ball - it drifts in and continues on along that trajectory after pitching. Not the greatest shot from Chakabva - it was dipping onto a good length, nowhere near full enough to be driving away from his body like that. Big gate, and Rangaiah bursts through it. Hang on - just watched the replay, and he was actually looking to whip that from off stump, against non-existent turn, through midwicket."

"flat, angled into the pads, goes on the back foot to whip through midwicket"
"tossed up full, drifting in towards off stump. Defended into the covers. He's making sure that front pad is out of the way"
"he still manages to hit that pad. This one's angled in from wider of the crease, and it drifts and goes on with that angle. Beats the inside edge of the defensive prod by a long way, but it's going down leg"
"angling down leg again, this one's paddled away fine"
"oh man, he's asking so many questions. Off the mark in Test cricket, Musakanda, with an inside-edge squeezed down to fine leg. Beautiful length, close to off stump, and he attempts to drive with the turn but there's no turn"

"good, sharp bouncer. Rises steeply over leg stump, and Masakadza leaves it nonchalantly. Just steps across to the off side and dips his left shoulder"
"fullish, a bit of outswing in the corridor. Nice stride forward to push gently into the cover point region"
"bouncer outside off, and that's fortunate for Musakanda. His first Test run was off the inside-edge, and his first boundary off the outside edge. Looks to hook and only manages a top edge that flies away to the fine leg boundary. Long leg a little too wide to get to that"
"length ball outside off, defended into the covers"
"dangerous. Looks to sweep from the stumps, or close to it. Too full for it, and he's lucky this goes with the angle - was headed down leg"
"another big appeal. Another one that slides on with the angle as he presses forward to defend, and he just about gets a little squeeze of inside-edge onto it. Going down leg too."
"more flight, fuller, outside off, driven to short extra-cover"
"lovely flight and drift, and Masakadza has to go. Presses forward to defend, ends up playing outside the line because of that delicious inward drift, and inside-edges into his pad. Short leg takes a good catch tumbling forward"

"length ball outside off and <strong>Kumara is appealing!</strong>, a faster ball that hurries the batsman and the ball goes past his outside edge. Sri Lanka <strong>review.</strong> There was a slight sound while the straight drive was played, not sure if that's a slight edge or just the whooshing noise of the bat's stroke. The third umpire is using that rock-and-roll feature to determine that. <strong>Yes, slight edge.</strong>. Umpire Gould changes his decision, and the debutant has to go."

Reached out, well away from his body, to drive, and the ball slid past his outside edge. Dickwella has the bails off in a flash - did he drag his foot out of the crease at any point? They check with the third umpire. Tricky call with the bowler's front foot. Looks like a millimeter of heel has landed behind the line... He's only bowled one no-ball in Test cricket before this... Well, the third umpire rules that this is a no-ball too! Wow. I thought a tiny sliver of his heel had landed behind the crease"

"<strong>in the air, again!</strong> and the new bowler strikes. It was in the slot to be hit, full and on middle. Moor makes a little bit of room and hits that straight down the ground.

Kumara almost made a mess of the catch but positioned himself under it eventually"

"well bowled. Flat, but still a good-length ball, and it turns in sharply enough to straighten from middle stump. Goes back when he should be forward, and it beats the inside edge of his defensive jab. Big lbw appeal, not given, not reviewed. Height may have been an issue? Ball-tracking says it's bouncing over middle and leg"

"tossed up on middle stump, blocked back to the bowler"
bouncer angling across the left-hander. Drops his gloves low and lets it pass through to the keeper

"ooh. Now Ervine plays for turn. Dips onto a good length outside off, reaches slightly away from his body to defend. No turn, and the inside-edge rolls into the leg side"
"full on off stump, blocked to midwicket"
"bowled him, that's poor technique from Waller. Really poor. Goes back to a flat length ball pitching on off and middle, playing for trajectory rather than length. And he doesn't get across with his back foot either. Ends up leg-side of the ball instead, and it rips past his outside edge and hits off stump.

"flat, back of a length outside off, left alone"
"slightly round-arm, on the fuller side of a good length, angling in to off stump. Defended into the covers"

"fuller, defended into the covers"
"full, speared in towards Cremer's feet. Shows the full face and defends towards mid-on"

"flat length ball on off stump, stays back to block back to the bowler"
"tossed up slow outside off, reverse-swept to the right of deep point"

"length ball swinging in slightly towards off stump, defended from the crease, back towards the bowler"
"ooh. Full inswinger, homing in on off and middle. Gets his pad out of the way in a hurry and jams down a straight bat to jab towards midwicket"
"ooh, good ball. He's been swinging a few, and he's planted some doubt in Tharanga's mind. Back of a length in the corridor, and this one doesn't swing back. Pokes at it, away from his body, but didn't go too hard at it. Ball rolls away off the outside edge, falling to the right of second slip"
"don't bowl full and wide to him. He drove one through cover point in the previous over. This one's closer to the man at short extra-cover, but he can't stop it despite a desperate dive to his right"
"length ball on off and middle, stays back, lets it come on, and drops it gently to midwicket's left"
"length ball swinging in towards off stump, blocked to mid-off"
"fullish outside off, driven firmly and mid-off does well to stop it with a dive to his left. Cremer the fielder"
"short outside off, and Tharanga puts it away easily. Good step back and across, in a great position to punch it away to the left of backward point"
"full on off stump, overpitched, driven back down the pitch, between the stumps and the non-striker. No way mid-off can get anywhere near it"

"back of a length on middle stump, defended towards short extra-cover"
"back of a length, down leg, tucked away to the right of long leg"
"nice length outside off, and he gets it to bounce a touch more than expected. Stops on the pitch too. Drives too early, and the ball pops up in the air, but falls well short of mid-off"
"length ball outside off, and Tharanga leans into the shot of the morning. Just shows it the full face, transfers his weight forward, and finds the gap to the right of mid-off"

"good length again, defended to short extra-cover"
"fullish, angling into off stump from wide of the crease. Defended to midwicket"

"nice flight close to off stump, defended to short extra-cover"
"a bit fuller, on off stump, driven to mid-off. Good to see that the fielder's been brought in"

"length ball on middle and off, defended back down the pitch"
"back of a length close to off stump, defended into the covers"

"back of a length close to off stump, defended to extra-cover"

"length ball outside off, defended to extra-cover"
"bowled on a line just outside off without much turn from around the wicket, the batsman stays back and cuts to point"
"Tharanga goes back again and opens the face a bit more this time, trying to get the ball behind point, but the fielder moves quickly to his right and cuts it off"
defended on the front foot
goes back and waits for the ball to come into him with the angle before nudging it off his pads on the leg side
Karunaratne presses forward and blocks with a straight bat
"a fuller ball on middle stump, driven firmly and straight, the bowler falls to his left and cuts off the shot"
"a length ball wide outside off, the batsman opens the face and steers the ball through point"
"more width outside off at a gentle pace, Karunaratne stays back and moves towards the ball before driving through point"
"a slower ball angling into the right hander, defended on the off side"
Tharanga uses the width on offer to lean into a graceful cover drive
defended from the crease back to the bowler
"pitches on a length outside off and angles into the left-hander, he stays back and pushes the ball into the covers"
punched off the front foot into the covers where the fielder intercepts with a little juggling act
steps out and plays the ball back to the bowler
"an attempted paddle sweep but he does not make contact, the Zimbabweans appeal for lbw but it looks like the impact on the pad was outside off stump. The umpire says not out but Zimbabwe review! I'm pretty sure that hit the pad outside off stump. Replays confirm, and the visitors lose a review. That ball was missing off stump as well."
"Tharanga responds to the review with a charge and drive to mid-on, he didn't time it as well as he wanted because he couldn't get to the pitch of the ball"
pushed off the front foot on the off side
goes back and taps the ball from outside off into the leg side
"first ball is a long hop, bowled flat and straight, the batsman pulls to the fielder at deep square leg"
steps out to a fuller ball and clips it off his pads towards deep midwicket
"drifts across the left-hander and spins back, defended on the front foot"
Tharanga jabs forward in defence and gets an inside edge that sends the ball in the air but out of the reach of the man at short leg
steps out and drives the ball along the ground to long on
"another paddle sweep and another appeal for lbw, but that was outside the line of off stump as well. In line, but ball-tracking shows it's going over the stumps. Ball rolls away off the thigh into the short fine leg region"
"short outside off. Rocks back, opens up at the hips, and pulls to the right of deep midwicket."
"fuller now, clipped into the leg side"
"short outside off, slapped to backward point"
"short again, gets really deep in his crease to pull, this time he beats long-on running to his left"
"flat length ball outside off, left alone"
"tossed up on off stump, driven to long-off"
"tossed up on off stump, looks to whip to mid-on but the bowler gets in the way, tumbling to his left"
"back of a length, turning into the pads, and he tucks it away to deep square leg to bring up a breezy half-century. He's looking in superb touch, there's very little in the pitch or the bowling to trouble him - he must be setting his sights really high now"
"down the track, flattens his trajectory and he blocks back to the bowler"
"down the track again, slows it down and bowls it a little wider, pulling his length back. Stretches out to defend back to the bowler"

"down the track to the flighted ball on off stump, clipped to long-on"
"goes back to a length ball on off stump, clips to short leg"

"short, wide, slapped away to deep point"
"not as short this time, makes a bit of room to dab to backward point"
"nice length on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"oh, beauty. This one's slightly wider outside off, tossed up slightly slower than the previous one and dropping slightly shorter. Presses forward and reaches out with his hands to adjust, but it rips away and beats his outside edge"
"flat and short on off and middle, pulled to the right of deep backward square leg"
"nice flight, dips onto a good length outside off and turns back sharply. Presses forward to defend, gets his front pad in the way, but impact is outside off"
"and again, his pad goes across and comes in the way of his defensive shot. This one's a little flatter and quicker, strikes outside the line of off stump"
"dips it onto that spot again. Comes forward to defend, rolls back to the bowler off inside edge"
"floated up slower and wider, driven through cover point"
"down the track to the flighted, dipping ball on off and middle. Lets it dip and flicks it through forward square leg"
"back of a length, punched to cover"
"short, a bit wider. Doesn't come on and he slaps it to cover, off the inside half of the bat"
"flat, back of a length outside off, leans back and punches to cover"
"length ball outside off, defended into the covers"
"a bit closer to off, blocked to short extra"
"short, a bit of width, jabbed to cover point"
"back of a length on off stump, makes a bit of room and punches to deep point"
"down the track to the flighted ball outside off, doesn't reach the pitch, stretches out to block to short extra-cover"
down the track again. The line is straighter this time and Karunaratne clips to mid-on
"oh my. That's a 107kph bouncer. Sudden change of pace, and he ducks hurriedly. Well done by Chakabva to get his glove up over his head to parry it"
down the track again and he doesn't reach the pitch. Spins past his flick and hits pad
"shortish, slanting across towards off stump, opens his bat face to steer it to the right of deep point"
"flat and full on off stump, driven to short extra"
"fullish on off stump, blocked to short extra-cover"
"fired in full on middle and off. Mid-off is too deep to save the single, and Tharanga pushes straight to him and runs"

"a bit of flight, full on off stump, clipped to the left of mid-on"
"flat length ball close to off stump, blocked into the off side"
"back of a length, turning into leg stump, goes deep in his crease to work it to deep backward square leg"
"back of a length on off stump, defended into the covers"
"long-hop, and that's easily put away, transfers his weight quickly through his hips to pull that through straight midwicket"
"ooh, that's a risky leave. Good response from Cremer, dangles this one up outside off, gets it to dip and rip back in. Doesn't miss off stump by too much"
"tossed up outside off, clipped to long-on"
"short on middle stump, pulled to deep backward square leg"
"back of a length, sixth-stump line, left alone"
"and that's a sensational catch at slip! Shortish, perhaps not enough width to cut. Slashes hard, gets a thick edge, and Masakadza barely has time to react, grabs it two-handed over his head while falling backwards"
"length ball on middle and off, clipped through square leg"
"oh, nearly! If the gully was a little finer... Short outside off, and he slashes without any feet. Slices it away to the right of the diving gully fielder"
"length ball wide of off, left alone"
"length ball outside off, driven to deepish cover, who's stationed in between, and behind, the fielders at short cover point and short extra-cover"
"quickish length ball on middle stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"nice flight, a bit of drift in towards middle stump. Defended to mid-off"
"lovely. Some drift again, a bit of turn as well. Defended to short extra-cover. This one dipped onto a better length than that previous ball"
"fuller, driven to the left of mid-off"
"tossed up, floated across the left-hander. Stretches across and eases it to deep point with an open face"
"short, and that's nearly another cheap dismissal for Kusal against Zimbabwe! Rocks back to pull, and Raza, diving forward and to his right at midwicket, can't quite reach the ball on the full. Bounced just short of him, he indicates. Just a bit of extra bounce"
"back of a length, sixth-stump line, left alone"
"length ball wide of off, slices a drive out to deep point"
"full, angling into off stump. Wants to drive to mid-on, hits the inner half of the bat and rolls to the fielder's right"
"length ball wide of off, left alone"
"length ball, fifth-stump line, steered with an open face down to deep backward point"
length ball on off stump and that's nicely flicked. Would probably have gone for four had Raza not dived to his left from midwicket and got a hand to it
"length ball just outside off, defended to short extra-cover"
"big appeal for lbw, doesn't get down low enough quickly enough to sweep. Pitches shorter than he'd like and spins to hit his pad. Pitched outside leg though"
"short, and this time Kusal puts away the pull. Gets back in a flash, feet wide apart and hips open, and pulls through square leg"
"tossed up on off stump, achieves some dip. Goes hard at the drive, ends up slicing it to the right of backward point. Wanted to hit that through cover. Hard hands from Mendis"
"full outside off, jabbed to short extra-cover"
"length ball turning sharply down leg, beats Tharanga's flick, and easily beats Chakabva as well"
"bouncer, rising steeply over off stump. Looks to hook from over his right shoulder. Ball stops slightly, and he meets it well in front of his body. Manages to get on top of the bounce and drag it around to long leg"
"length ball, slower ball, angling into the corridor outside off, defended to short extra-cover"
"wide length ball, slapped to short cover point"
"length ball wide of off, seams away slightly, and is that a drop? Nah. Fielder at gully, Ervine, dives  to his left, and it bounces just short of him and then hits him in the groin region. Looks to be in some pain here"
"length ball wide of off, and this time Tharanga leaves it"
"fuller, just as wide, Tharanga leaves again"
"full-toss on middle stump, punched to deep midwicket"
"once again, Tharanga stretches forward and across to defend a dipping legbreak, and his front pad gets in the way as it dips and turns. Impact well outside off, though"
"fuller, eases a checked drive into the covers"
"Zimbabwe are roaring back to life here, that's a super delivery. Flight, dip, and sharp turn outside off. Reaches out, away from his body, in defence, and the ball clips the shoulder of the bat and Chakabva takes an excellent catch, over his right shoulder"
"Greets him with a googly. Not sure he picked it, but it was short enough for him to adjust and read it off the pitch, and started straight enough for him to clip it off his pads to the fine leg boundary"
"ooh, Cremer's really ripping them now. Again he gets it to dip and turn quickly, and he beats a drive away from the body"
"wide length ball, left alone"
"back of a length, a little closer to off stump, and that's a lovely shot. Presses onto the front foot, waits for the ball to come on, and opens his bat face to steer it wide of gully"
"back to that sixth-stump line, Tharanga leaves it"
"shortish, just a bit of width, slapped away to deep point"
"length ball outside off, left alone"

"full outside off, driven to short extra-cover"
"quickish length ball turning into middle and off, defended down in front of short leg"
"back of a length on off stump, goes deep in his crease and defends with soft hands to short leg"
"again, he gets it to dip on Tharanga. Floats it across the left-hander, gets a bit of drift away too, but it drops shorter than he expects as he stretches across to defend, and beats his inside edge to hit front pad. Once again, he gets that pad outside the line of off stump"
"in the blockhole on off stump, and is that a run-out at the non-strikers' end? Driven back firmly, Tiripano bends low in his follow-through and indicates he got a fingertip to the ball on its way to the stumps. They're checking with the third umpire... A definite deflection, and that's horrible backing up. Tharanga has his bat in his right hand while standing on the right of the stumps, and as a result he's trying to get back with his foot rather than stretching out his bat. Doesn't get there in time, and he'll have to go. A breezy, entertaining innings ended by a casual moment at the non-strikers' end"
"back of a length on leg stump, clipped through backward square leg"
"wow. That's a beaut. <b>What a first ball to get</b>. A dipping, yorker-length slower ball. Has no idea where that's going, and he just about jams his bat down in front of his pad. If he'd missed, that would have struck him in line with middle and leg, maybe middle, and he was back in his crease. Rolls away off the inside edge to long leg"
"full on off stump, driven towards mid-on"
"drifts onto the pads, clips to long leg"
"back of a length on off stump, goes deep in his crease to defend to midwicket"
"nicely flighted outside off, stretches out and steers with an open face to backward point"
"ooh, flight and dip, defended into the point region. Hit the high part of the outer half of the bat. Really didn't pitch as full as Chandimal expected"
"again, beats Chandimal in the air slightly with some flight outside off, jabbed out to cover point, away from the body"
"now a full-toss on off stump and he nearly gets himself out to it. Plays an airy sweep, and he's fortunate that bounces short of the man at deep backward square leg"
"short outside off, punched away to deep point"
"flat, angled down leg and then it turns back towards Chandimal's pads. Worked to the right of short leg"
"short outside off, slapped to deep point"
"flighted ball on middle stump, defended to short leg"
"back of a length on off stump, defended to mid-off"

"nice length outside off, lots of turn and bounce. Left alone"
"a bit more flight, full on middle and leg, clipped through backward square leg"

"back of a length, close to off stump. Punched nicely and short cover moves quickly to his left to intecept"
"nice line, pitching just outside leg on a good length. Makes sure he doesn't close his bat face, defends to mid-off with the full face showing"
"this one's flighted on the same line, but it's overpitched, and Chandimal whips it away easily, wide of mid-on. Full-toss, in fact."
"tossed up outside off, blocked to mid-off"
"full on off stump, driven back to the bowler"
"full outside off, driven to short extra"
"a bit slower, just as full, gives Mathews a little more time to assess his options. Presses forward and opens his bat face slightly to push to the left of short extra-cover"
"fired in round-arm, full on middle stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"tossed up on off stump, driven inside-out to the right of sweeper cover"
"length ball on off and middle, defended to mid-on"
"fullish, and is that a bit of reverse in towards middle and leg? Maybe a little bit, but nothing to perturb Mathews, who leans forward and flicks stylishly to beat midwicket diving left and mid-on, sprinting and diving right. Super shot"
"back of a length on off stump, blocked back towards the bowler"
"full, a bit of reverse again but starts too straight. Clipped off the toes through square leg"
"full on off stump, shows the full face to punch to mid-on"

"flat, round-arm ball on middle stump, defended back to the right of the bowler"
"once again, flat on middle stump. Gets his front pad out of the way to block it back to the bowler"

"flatter, angling into middle and leg, defended to short leg"

"full, drifts onto the pads, clipped to long leg"
"fires one down the leg side. Can't connect with the flick, rolls off the pad to the left of the keeper"
"flighted and full on off stump, driven firmly to short extra-cover"

"flat, fullish, a little wide of off. Jabbed to cover point and there's a brief misunderstanding here. Matthews took a couple of steps out, stopped, and sent back Chandimal, who had responded at the other end. Throw, however, came to the keeper's end, so no real trouble. May have been interesting had he thrown to Chandimal's end, because he had really sprinted out"
"short and wide, slapped past the diving man at short cover, and sweeper cover, running right, tries to stop it with his boot instead of diving, ends up kicking it into the rope"

"flat and fullish outside off, nice use of the hands to reach out and lap-sweep to deep backward square leg"

"nice flight and drift in towards off stump. Doesn't quite get to the pitch in defence and it spins away and rolls off the outside edge, wide of slip"
"down the leg side this time, and that's not the best bit of fielding at the long leg boundary. Tiripano ran right from deep backward square leg to stop the sweep, tumbles to his right, but lets the ball slip through his fingers"

"shortish outside off, punched to sweeper cover"
"ooh, well bowled. Tossed it up high and got some dip. Wanted to clip towards long-on, I think, and he ended up playing it back to the bowler, since he didn't quite meet it at the pitch of the ball"
"tossed up outside off, driven to long-off"
"googly, pitching outside off, short enough for the batsman to adjust and block it back to the bowler"
sharp turn from middle stump. Stays on the back foot to defend towards point
"ooh, lovely. Similar ball to the one that nicked off Kusal Mendis. Chandimal, however, plays close to his body, doesn't follow it, and is happy to have his outside edge beaten. To be fair, he did push at it, but was looking to play down the ground so his hands didn't follow it wide of off stump"

"full on middle stump, clipped to midwicket"
"short outside off, slapped to the right of backward point"
"oh my. Casual shot from Mathews, leaned forward and across for that lap-sweep he's been playing from outside off. Doesn't turn, and the ball misses his bat, clips his pad outside off, and beats the keeper, who's moving to his left to try and intercept a top-edged sweep"

down the track and he floats this slower and wider. Stretches out to push to mid-off

"full now, on off stump. Wants to drive to long-off but short extra moves right to intercept"

"flatter now, length ball on off stump, defended into the covers"
"lovely length, dipping onto off stump and turning away. Chandimal gets a big stride forward and head over the ball to defend to short extra-cover"

"length ball on off stump. Takes a big step back and across to try and shorten the length slightly to work it square of midwicket. Can't manage it, hits it straight to the fielder"
"whoops, not the greatest execution. Donald Tiripano got out somewhat like this today. Tries the reverse-sweep, ends up gloving it over the man at slip. Not quite the length for the shot, dipped on him a little"
"fullish on middle stump, blocked back to the bowler"
"on the pads now, clipped to square leg"

"oh, that's some serious turn. Quick turn too. Drifts in towards middle stump, comes forward to defend, and it rips right across his bat face"
"oh man. looks to sweep from middle stump, dips slightly on him and he top-edges it high. Mpofu, running left from deep backward square leg, dives forward, but misjudges it slightly and it falls an inch short of his hands"

Ripping turn and bounce, hit the shoulder of the bat, and Chakabva rides the bounce and makes it look so easy"
"nicely pitched legbreak on off stump, defended into the on side."
"ooh, hung this out a little wider and slower. Looks to drive away from his body, against the turn, and inside-edges into his front pad"
"nice flight again, a little closer to off stump. Stretches out and blocks it back to the bowler"
"full outside off, clipped to the left of midwicket"
"yikes. Another streaky reverse-sweep from Mathews. The shot was on, it was pitched nice and wide of off, but he didn't get his head over the ball, allowed it to turn back in, and he gloves it in the air, but to the left of backward point"
"full-toss outside off, swiped down to long-on"
"down the track and Raza fires it quicker, on off stump. Blocked back to the bowler"

"makes a bit of room again. This one's a back-of-a-length ball on off stump, dabs it away neatly to the left of slip"

"tossed up full on middle stump, defended to short extra-cover"
"flighted ball pitching just outside leg. Full enough to clip against the turn, to the right of midwicket"
"bowled him! Not the greatest shot from Dickwella. He's been a little loose right through this innings. Not short enough to cut, and it doesn't even pitch that far outside off. Just stays leg-side of the ball and stabs at it with an angled bat. Turns back in and cannons into the stumps off the inside edge and back pad"
"googly first up. Spins past the inside edge as he jabs uncertainly at it, and pops up to short leg off pad. Spinning down leg, so not much of an appeal. Decent bounce too, it hit thigh pad"
"full on leg stump, defended to mid-on"
"tossed up on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"

flat legbreak pitching on leg and turning towards off. Goes deep in his crease to punch to the right of mid-on
excellent. Drifts in towards middle and off and rips away square. Mathews leaves it well
googly. Dipping and turning past the inside edge of his defensive shot. Lobs off the pad into the fine leg region

down the track and he shortns his length. Punches with a straight bat to square midwicket
bam. Floats it up wide of off stump and he uses that room to slog-sweep hard over midwicket

"taken, that's brilliant from Masakadza! Looks for the lap-sweep from outside off, premeditates. The ball is a touch on the short side for that shot, and it loops up off the top half of the bat, behind the keeper, to his left. Masakadza turns around at slip, sprints some 15 yards, and then dives forward to take it two-handed"
"fired in flat at the pads. Not much of a forward stride to defend and it pops up in the air, wide of short leg"
"again, not much of a front-foot stride, Perera this time. Length ball pitching on middle stump and straightening. Looks to work it against the turn and pops a leading edge into the covers"
"another glorious legbreak from Cremer. Drifts in towards leg stump, dips, and rips past the outside edge. Big appeal for caught behind. Zimbabwe have referred this upstairs... I think he's missed it. Side-by-side side-on and front-on replays confirm that."
"this one pitches outside leg and doesn't turn. Goes on the back foot, maybe looking for turn, and then hurriedly adjusts to flick, then decides to let it pass down the leg side. Ends up pulling his bat away a touch too late, and inside-edges it. Flies away to the left of the keeper"
"back of a length on off stump, blocked back to the bowler"

"floated up a bit fuller, blocked back to the bowler"

"flat length ball turning towards off stump. Plays from the crease in defence, lets it come on and dabs wide of slip"
"length ball on leg stump, defended towards midwicket"
"down the track to the flighted ball just outside off. Dilruwan is picking these moments of aggression well. Gets nice and close to the pitch and extends his arms through a flowing drive, high and sweet over the bowler's head"

"fired in on middle and leg, jabbed back to the bowler"

"down the track, meets this off-stump ball on the full and whips to long-on"
"tossed up on off stump, defended into the point region"

"back of a length, sliding in towards leg stump, punched through midwicket"

"short outside off, slapped away to sweeper cover"

"back of a length outside off, and he's gone! Superb fielding at backward point by the debutant Musakanda, sprinting quickly to his right, throwing himself across full-length to stop Gunaratne's back-foot punch. He picks it up and flicks it to the man at cover in one motion. The cover fielder, Waller, throws on the bounce to the keeper, and he has the bails off before Dilruwan can make it. Ironically, the hamstrung Gunaratne always wanted the single. Dilruwan hesitated, fatally. Amazing, amazing bit of work from Musakanda. One of the plays of the year. Or decade. Or ever."

"Williams wins an lbw verdict. Herath then challenges the on-field out decision. The left-arm spinner serves up a low full-toss. Herath had jumped across off and missed the sweep wearing it on his front pad, well below the knee-roll. Impact: this looks in line with off. No signs of a snick. This should crash into off stump. The tracker returns umpire's call on impact, but suggests the <b>ball would head past the off stump</b>. Oh my! <b>How did that miss?</b> Beats me. The drift in the air wasn't sharp either. Eventually, umpire Gould's call is reversed. Williams is bewildered, so am I. Herath can afford a wry smile"
"Chakabva fumbles once. Twice. But still has enough time to swipe the bails off hurriedly. Herath has to exit now. He dashes down the track, Williams pushes it flatter and wider outside off. The ball dips, which means the batsman can't squeeze it out. Herath misses the ball by a long distance. Chakabva makes a mess but cleans it up on the third attempt to break the stand"

"googly outside off, Kumara stays back to defend"
"runs down the pitch and looks to whack this over long-on, the legbreak rips in and takes the inside edge towards fine leg. Two, asks Kumara? Excuse me, exclaims Gunaratne"
"and that's Cremer's five-for! A lead of 10 for Zimbabwe. Pushes this one through, flatter and quicker outside off. Gunaratne stays back. The ball skids on, kisses the inside edge and clatters into the stumps. A crucial hand from Gunaratne."

"that's a nice stroke. Slightly short outside off, a hint of width, but Chakabva laces a cut through point. Important to play some strokes"
"out comes the 'phew' during delivery stride. Full outside off, no turn. Inside-edged into the pad"
"slow again on off, Chakabva gets nicely forward to defend"
"that's risky. I'm going to say poor stroke. Flat on off, straight. Chakabva goes back and pushes to the sweeper cover. Too much risk"
a nice forward press to smother that loopy delivery
"back of a length outside off, on a fourth-stump line. Chakabva is slightly hurried for pace, but defends"
"did he try to play that? Yes, says umpire Llong. Good length down leg, Chakabva looks to flick that, takes the thigh pad and to the fine leg boundary. Lifted his bat up as to say 'I'm not playing a stroke;, but he was, and so four leg byes."
"good length outside off, no stroke"
"that's good. Good length, or just fuller than that, outside off. Not enough width to cut. Left"
"beautiful line. Just around off on a length. Forces Chakabva to play, defended"
"129 kph, leg side-ish, nudged down to fine leg"
"that's terrific bowling. No chance for Chakabva. Herath slows this way down, but drags the length back too. Pitches on middle. Chakabva plays the line - it's the new ball after all. There is just enough turn and the ball spins to hit the off stump. The top of off. Chakabva didn't miss that by much, but by enough. Beauty. Unplayable."
"flight on off, driven back to the bowler"
"fuller and straight, easily blocked"
"quicker and leg side-ish, inside-edged into short leg's hands"
"slow on off, blocked"
"ooh, nicely bowled. Flat on off, shortish. Musakanda gets forward and inside-edges into the pad. 'Not out,' says the umpire to everyone's surprise. No one appealed."
"on a length around off, moves away slightly. But easily defended"
"131 kph, good length around middle, pushed away to mid-off. Elegant stroke"
"lovely hit. Fullish and wide outside off, driven languidly in front of deep point. The sub Gunathilaka dives but can't stop two"
"on a length on middle, pushed to mid-on"
a good change in length. Digs this one in short. Masakadza gets underneath that
"slightly spongy. Good length outside off, bunted to mid-on"
"on the pads, down leg, worked to midwicket"
"beautiful bowling. Drags this length back, this one skids on. Beaten on the inside edge, struck on the pad, but sliding down"
"quicker on leg, defended"
"another wicket. Herath on fire before lunch. Plenty of flight on off, loopy in fact. Musakanda hasn't had anything to be aggressive to so he eyes up this one. Looks to, inexplicably I might add, drag a flick through midwicket. The ball gets enough turn to take the outside edge. Lobs straight to slip. Not a good option at all, at least go straight"
"flight outside off, Ervine strides forward but the ball spins in, hits Ervine outside the line"
"nice use of the feet, it's a proper defensive shot, but plenty of intent. Defended"
"flat and quick on leg, flicked to square leg"
"quick on off, no turn. Outside-halved towards point"
"quicker outside off, flat trajectory, no turn. Chopped towards point"
"fuller, closer to the stumps. Ervine gets forward and defends"
a nice gentle press forward to block
"85 kph, on the pads on leg, worked away towards midwicket. Dilruwan gets across to prevent one"
"bludgeoned back. Waaaatcchh out. Flight on off, Masakadza comes down, gets to the pitch and muscles a powerful drive at the stumps at the bowler's end. The off stump for the right-hander was uprooted, and almost hit the umpire."
"given out lbw. <strong>Masakadza reviews</strong>. Doesn't look like bat or glove. This could come down to just impact. It's full outside off, Masakadza chooses to sweep but doesn't make contact, I think. Multiple replays to see if there is some glove. It's mighty close. Does it just flick it? Can't really tell, one way or another. So that can't be overturned on that aspect. UltraEdge or Snick or some kind would have done the job perfectly. But that debate is for another time. Three reds on HawkEye. And they're three down already."
"gets across the stumps, and pushes a drive towards cover for a run"
"top-edged, but lands short of the 45-degree fielder at fine leg. Flat on off, Ervine tries to sweep"
"more flight outside off, a thick outside edge towards third man for one"
"flatter and quicker outside off, no stroke"
"flight on off, smothered back"
"quicker and shorter on middle. Ervine picks the length early, goes back and pummels a mis-timed pull through midwicket. That's important to do"
"another one. Zimbabwe go to lunch at 23 for 4. Not a good stroke at all. Flat and wide outside off, Dilruwan gets some turn. Ervine has a poke at that, and just dabs it straight to slip. Tried to pull out of the stroke late, but at this level, your decision-making ability has to be quicker and just better. Ervine's is not in this instance. A half-leave, half-dab results in sooo much pressure after lunch."
"floated up on middle, no real turn, Raza goes low, and sweeps it with intent. Secures a single to fine leg"
"much fuller and outside off, Williams lunges out and drives the ball handsomely through cover point"
"skids into the pads, blocked off the back foot to short leg"
"fizzes through outside off, holds its line, no shot"
Williams stretches forward to meet the pitch of a full ball outside off. Driven to mid-off
"nice and full on off, non-turner, smothered back"
"full and skidding in towards the pads, worked defensively to forward short leg"
"another slider outside off, too wide to draw a shot from Williams"

"straight ball on middle, pushed to cover from the crease"
"full and spins away outside off from around the wicket, punched to sweeper"
"Raza shows intent again, advances down the track and pushes this straight ball to cover"
"slides into the pads, full, picked off to the right of short leg to square leg"
"dropped short and wide outside off, Williams jumps back and smears it to sweeper cover"
"short on middle and leg, cramps Raza for room. He hurtles back and forces the ball to mid-on"
"flat and width outside off, Williams camps back and punches it sweetly square through the off side. Laced it"
"full and just a shade outside off, dabbed wide of silly point"
backs away outside leg and drills a full one down to long-off
"tossed up liberally on off, dead-batted"

"short offbreak outside off, cut firmly to the off-side sweeper on the back foot"
"short and outside off, punched out to sweeper"
"full and angled in from over the wicket, defended to short leg"

"full, holds its line on off, Williams prefers to block off the back foot"
"shorter on off, whipped away off the back foot to deep midwicket"
"Raza gallops down the track, takes a really full ball from off, and belts it down to long-off"
"flighted just a shade outside off, kept out"
Raza pre-meditates a paddle-sweep. Drops down to one knee and top-edges it towards fine leg
"drifts in from wide of the crease, hits the pad, but this was clearly going down leg. Dickwella pulls off the Sangappeal"
"flatter on middle and leg, hastily defended"
"slower and loopier on leg stump, push-driven to mid-on"
"straight length ball on off, driven on the front foot, but the man at short extra cover throws himself to his right to stop the ball"
"this drifts into the right-hander, fuss-free defence back to the bowler"
"tossed outside off, pushed on the front foot through vacant extra cover. Lovely stride to counter the spin"
"fired on off from over the wicket, Raza ventures a reverse-sweep. He pre-meditated, as did Karunaratne at slip, nimbly moving across to his right from first slip but only<strong> finger-tipped it away</strong>"
"flighted and outside off, Williams stretches forward and eases it through the gap at cover"
"speared on off, confidently whipped to midwicket"
"marginally short and outside off, whipped out to deep midwicket for one"
"tossed on middle, defended back to the bowler"
"lovely batting. Short, but not very wide, primarily because of that skidding angle from around the wicket. Williams stays low and cuts behind point for a couple."
"on the pads, flicked to wide mid-on for a run. This is excellent batting post lunch. Proactive, despite the risk"
"slower and shorter, Raza stays back and defends in front of off stump"
"nicely done. Against the spin, or whatever little is there. Raza bottom-hands that drive through cover. Races away."
"and now the paddle sweep, low enough, premeditated. A run to fine leg. Got to get behind the stroke, and not drag a paddle sweep."
"slower and fuller outside off, outside-halved to third man"
"tossed up on leg, Raza clears his front foot and drives to long-off"
"plenty of drift. Flat outside off, skids on with the arm. A thick outside edge to third man"
"surprise, surprise. Just kidding. That was on the cards. That's sensational bowling. Tossed up outside off, lulls Williams into a drive. He has been scoring there all session long. So why not this time? He drives and Herath's wiles take that ball ripping through bat and pad. Knocks into the stumps. This is Test cricket, setting him up with several drifty deliveries and then gets one to spin. How does he do it?"
"tossed up on off, driven towards cover."
Raza runs to the pitch and drives to long-off. Good batting.
"overpitched flight on leg, blocked back. Terrific over."
"full and holds its line on off, Raza presses forward and pushes the ball to cover"
"pushed through on off from around the wicket, blocked solidly on the front foot"
"skids through on off, defended on the back foot now"
"straighter one, forward and smothered"

"Kumara hits 140ks now but this is shorter and attached with width outside off, crunched to sweeper"
"hip-high short ball on off, Raza jumps off his feet and flicks the ball away square of fine leg"
"chest-high short ball on middle, half-flapped and half-fended over square leg. Kumara has the pace to harry batsmen"
"wild, wild bouncer. 140ks, flies off the deck and past the ducking batsman and the leaping keeper. Five wides. Pace is your friend, pace is your enemy"
"Oh, the ball keeps sliding away from Rangana. But he gamely chases it down running across to his right and tumbling at sweeper cover. It always looks very awkward when the old chap dives, right? But excellent commitment. Shortish and just a shade outside off, punched away. Rangana just pulls it in and earns the applause of Kumara"
"drifting across off from around the stumps, pushed down to long-off off the front foot"
"loopier and outside off from over the wicket to Raza, defended back"
"slides into the pads, milked away to the right of forward short leg"
"drifts and turns into the pad, but this was breaking down leg"
Moor goes back to defend this length ball wide of short leg
Moor winds up for a maasssive slog-sweep but only connects with a whole lot of thin air as the ball drifts across the right-hander

"short on middle, stays leg side of the ball and punches to mid-off"
"shoulder-high lifter on the leg stump, Moor manages to evade it"

"a flat start on leg, to which Moor goes back and blocks"
"flight on off, Moor strides forward to defend"
"slow again, short enough though, allowing Moor to go back and defend comofrtably"
"it's a good option, but it's not good execution. Some would disagree. The best place to hit it. Between the keeper's legs. Flat outside off, Moor looks for a big slog sweep and under-edges the ball between Dickwella's legs. Umpire Gould asks the batsman if he hit it. Four runs"
defended into the leg side
"quicker outside off, a crisp drive to cover."
"nice length. Ribcage attacking length, from around the length. Worked towards short fine leg"
"good length on leg, clipped to midwicket"
"good length, around off. He stays in the crease and defends, head over the ball, eyes on it"
"good length on leg. Raza is forced off his feet, but easily and capably defended"
"not a bad line occasionally. Well down leg, an ODI wide. Raza leaves. Often gloved to the keeper, like Faf du Plessis at Trent Bridge"
"looking for the yorker, goes astray slightly. A low full toss bunted to mid-on ends a maiden"
"short and straight, defended back"
"slightly fuller, still straight. Moor can defend off the back foot"
"brings Moor forward with a loopy legbreak, driven back"
"nice length, on the pads. Brings Moor forward. Played away easily"
""
"83 kph, loopy offbreak outside off, driven to cover. Nice over. More control from Sri Lanka after drinks"
"on the pads, flicked away through midwicket"
"good length, and straight. A solid block off the back foot. Kumara has definitely pushed both batsmen back. There is no slip for the 1-2"
"back of a length on leg, kept out"
"digs this in, a non-threatening bouncer loops over the ducking Moor. Comfortable"
"leg side-ish, nudged away towards short leg's right. Mendis stops one. Well done."
my word. A 135 kph <strong>beamer to Moor</strong> who gets whacked on the hand. Right on the glove. He seems fine. An immediate apology. Looking for the yorker. One warning for Kumara.
"stays on his half of the pitch this time. On a length around off, blocked"
"immediately comes charging at Herath, works one down to long-on for a run. Well done"
"<b>Zimbabwe's lead is now 100</b>. Off the pad towards fine leg. Slightly leg side-ish, the slider"
"slow on middle and leg, asking to hit through midwicket. Raza says maybe later. Dead-batted"
"accepts the invitation this time. A better choice. This is shorter on leg, so Raza goes back and flicks through midwicket. More control"
runs down and bunts one to long-on
"shorter on leg, punched to long-on from the back foot. Six riskless runs of the over. What the what?"
"oh legspinning tripe. Love it. Short and wide from Mendis, hammered through cover for a couple. Herath forced to foot-stop it on the boundary"
"more filth. A long-hop on middle and leg, short and slow. Moor pulls merrily over midwicket. Good batting. Using the bad balls"

"full on middle and leg, defensive block"
"Dickwella sees Raza shaping for a paddle and moves early. Raza, though, converts a full delivery into a full toss and paddles that down to fine leg for a brace"

pushed back to the bowler

"flat and wide outside off, swivel-driven to the sweeper cover"
nicely driven to cover off that overpitched delivery
"occasionally, the ball sticks in the hand for far too long, making legspin a very difficult art. Like this. Short and wide, slapped to the sweeper cover"
"an ODI wide to the left-hander. Yikes, that was very wide down the leg side. Raza, shaped to paddle, is forced to stretch to get bat on that. He does, a run to fine leg. Better over from Mendis"
"the reverse sweep goes straight to slip. But the fielder anticipates the shot and moves to his right to stop that stroke, or even catch it. This takes the top edge and goes for four through what is, unfortunately for Sri Lanka, the vacant slip region"
defended back
"this cross-batted unorthodoxy is troubling Sri Lanka. A flighted delivery down leg, Raza nails his fine sweep. Got enough power behind that"
"and now steps out to meet the ball as it pitches. Once he's there, he gets underneath the length and lifts the ball over midwicket. Herath who?"
"flat down leg, solidly kept out"
"78 kph, flight down leg, inside-edged towards square leg. 12 runs off that."
"flight on off, Moor stretched out to defend"

"nicely bowled. 129 kph, in the channel outside off. Raza defends off the back foot"
"a short delivery. Bouncer on middle, Raza ducks underneath"

"nice and full around off, Moor presses forward to defend"
"88 kph, Moor stays back this time and gets his bat behind the line"

"full and on off, shuffles across off and turns the ball to short midwicket"

"slides on outside off, swished to cover with a flat bat"
"good length and turns into the batsman, pushed solidly to cover now. No violence"
"<strong>Raza raises his fifty </strong>with a sweet drive. He reaches the landmark in only 62 balls. Another crucial hand from him. This was slightly overpitched and outside off, Raza presses forward and eases it in the gap between cover and mid-off. He hares back for three"

Dilruwan finds some drift in the air but this is negotiated off the front foot
Moor opens the face and directs the ball to the left of cover for one

"some hesitation between the wickets, and they settle with a dot. This offbreak is worked past the right of midwicket"
"length ball on middle, defended back"
"Kumara returns and provides SL with the breakthrough! He roars and is flanked by his captain. This was dug in short on off stump, 137.1ks, Moor does not need a second invitation to pull. But square leg isn't on the boundary. He is about 20 metres in, Moor hits it straight into the lap of Danushka, who is subbing for Asela. Moor sinks to his knees and drags himself off the field. Was the leg-side trap a plan from Chandimal and Kumara?"
"very full and tailing down leg, reverse for Kumara, Cremer is left overbalanced, and the ball rolls away past the keeper. Five byes. Was there a snick onto it? No, says the umpire."

"tossed up outside off, Raza shimmies down, meets the ball as it pitches and drives to cover. Excellent shot"
driven with the spin to long-on
"flat, full, straight. Waller shuffles across, opens the bat face late."
awesome stroke-making against one of the best in the world. Raza runs down and flicks over midwicket. Knew what he wanted all along. No chance for long-on running around
"over long-on. I'm going to say that's not a good shot. But well, he gets six, so he won't care. He runs down again, looks to hit that over midwicket again, but this is wider outside off. So to drag that is fraught with risk. Skews over the pulled-in boundary at long-on"
a solid block this time
"slower and straight, driven back awkwardly. Herath pulled the length back on that"

"pushed through, quick on off. Some spin in. A solid block"

"flight on off, easily kept out"
"loopy, overpitched on leg. Picked away to long-on for one"

"short outside off, Waller gets underneath that"
"138 kph, inside-edge or not? Yes, says umpire Llong. Full on leg, the ball hits the pad. Looked like an inside edge"
right in front. Somehow Raza gets bat on that. Inside-edged towards square leg
comes right down and defends. Excellent defensive stroke

gets right forward to defend
worked towards midwicket

"more flight outside off, kept out"
"getting this ball to tail back in late. Full and straight, driven up to mid-on. Excellent bowling"
"full and wide outside off, square driven to the sweeper cover"

wow. Moves to 96. Runs down and drives over cover. That is belligerence. Not even to the pitch of the ball. Went through with the stroke
gets low and paddles away to fine leg to move to 97. His job is done for the day. Fantastic effort
"tossed up on off, solidly and efficiently kept out."
"good length, pushed through flat outside off stump. Driven on the up to sweeper's right...they come back for the second. Herath puts in a nice throw and the bowler takes the bails off at the non-strikers. Sent upstairs but Waller had grounded his bat nicely"

Swinging, angling ball hit him on leg stump. There seemed to be bat and it also seemed to be going down...yep. It is going down. Long way with that swing."

"oh, dear! That's another wicket gone to the wrong shot selection. Raza played so well and he has given it away with a poor shot. Gets down for a reverse sweep but this is a slider, loops up on middle and leg and refuses to turn. Just comes on with the arm to beat the bat and crash into the stumps.

"turn and bounce! Perfectly-pitched offbreak, creates an opportunity.  The square leg umpire has referred a stumping chance. Dickwella is in trouble. Side-on replays show that the <strong>back foot is bang on the line.</strong> Not even an itty bitty part of the foot behind the crease. Shamshuddin, the TV umpire, examines various angles, but there is nothing behind the line. Surprising/shocking (delete by preference) decision from the TV umpire. <b>Not out is the verdict</b>. Zimbabwe's players are stunned, as is their coach Heath Streak in the change room. Lovely piece of bowling from Raza nonetheless.

Ekes out a very mild edge and the keeper drops, the ball hits the grille of the keeper's helmet. Tries to take it on the rebound and can't take it. Oh,dear!

Heartbreak for Cremer and Zimbabwe"
"Mpofy ventures another bouncer, Perera evades it"
"Oh my! What has happened here? Asela has smashed a pull into a ducking short leg. The keeper takes it on the rebound. The soft signal from umpire Gould is out. They refer it to the TV umpire.

"<b>was there an inside edge</b>? No, says Gould. Zimbabwe have reviewed. Back of a length googly, Perera stays back and brings the bat down hurriedly. Does not pick the variation and the ball cuts into him to hit him on the back thigh and lob towards the keeper. Could there have been a glove? They will stay with the on-field call unless there's substantial evidence to suggest otherwise. They cut to ball-tracking also to check the lbw. No issues there as it has missed the stumps by a mile. Right then, not out it is"
"length ball, looped up around leg and straightening, defended"
"<b>huge appeal for lbw</b>. Not out again, says the umpire. Zimbabwe have reviewed again. Seems like it pitched outside leg. It was a looped up flighted legbreak that spun back in to beat the inside edge as the batsman stayed back in the crease. Ball-tracking confirms it has not pitched in line"
