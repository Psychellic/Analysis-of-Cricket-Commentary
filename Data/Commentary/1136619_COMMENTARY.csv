"back of a length and swinging down the leg side, misses the bat, misses the thigh pad, and swerves down leg. DK throws himself to his left to stop the ball"
"back of a length, starts outside off, and nips away further. Saha simply watches it through to the keeper. Encouraging carry"
"short and skids back in off the pitch, cramps the batsman for room. He hops, skips, and gloves it in front of point for one"
"pitched further up and slanting away outside off, now Dhawan shoulders arms"
"Mavi drags his length back and gets it to angle away in the corridor, Dhawan does not bite"
"Dhawan ventures outside leg, Mavi bowls it on a back of a length outside off at <strong>141ks</strong>, Dhawan jumps back in line with the stumps and jabs it away with an open face through the gap at point"
"<strong>prancing delivery, 142.7ks</strong>, jumps from a back of a length, jars the splice, and rolls away to the off side"
"he ventures wide of the crease, good length and holds its line outside off, no shot"
"really full and outside off, Saha squeezes to short cover and threatens to run himself out but Dhawan sends him back. There simply wasn't a run there"
"wide of the crease, full and holds its line outside off, Saha is rooted to the crease as he drives and jams an inside edge past the leg stump"

"slightly overpitched and outside off, Saha stretches out, gets close to the pitch and drives but Uthappa makes a tumbling save to his left at short extra cover"
"140.4ks, but Prasidth sprays a full ball on the pads of Dhawan, feeds the opener's strengths. Dhawan simply picks it up and flicks it over the square leg boundary - the first of the night"
"Saha rides the bounce of this back of a length ball outside off, taps to Gill at backward point, and sets off for a risky single. Dhawan makes it in the end"
"pretty full on middle stump, <strong>144.1ks, pace like fire</strong>, jabbed behind square on the off side"
"good length, starts outside off, cuts back in, Saha has a big yahoo at it but only collects fresh air"
"<strong>DK calls for the skier but misjudges it and drops it</strong>. Mavi hits a hard length outside off, Saha pulls and sends a top-edge in the air. It soars to Mars. Then drops down. DK looks to settle under it and the ball swirls away from his reach. He can only finger-tip it away"
"Dhawan forays down the track, Mavi attacks his ribs with a short ball, flapped to the leg side"
"back of a length on off stump, Saha brings his bat down in line in defence"
"back of a length and skids off the pitch, hits the thigh and lobs to slip, where Rana dives forward but can't catch the ball"
"shorter and outside off, Dhawan lines it up and flat-bats it straight past the bowler and Saha for four. Width and that's Dhawan's release. Slip has been pulled out"
"more width. Overpitched and wide outside off, drilled to the covers off the front foot. He can't pierce the tightly packed off-side infield. Five men there"
"more and more width. Slower ball outside off, 123ks, sits up to be hit, Dhawan reads the change-up and threads the gap. Punched between backward point and the covers"
"dug in short and outside off, pulled on the bounce to deep square leg"
"lifter on middle, 141.4ks, Saha ducks under it. <strong>Saha: 6 off 12 balls</strong>"
Dhawan rides the bounce of this 143ks short ball outside off and guides it to deep third man

"back of a length on middle, Dhawan sits back and whips a single to midwicket"
"short on off stump, not much spin, Saha hangs back and forces a pull straight to deep midwicket. Should've smashed it to the fence"

"dragged down outside off, Dhawan skips back and flat-bats it fiercely to the left of long-off"
"Chawla pushes this one wide of off, Dhawan drags a slog-sweep to deep midwicket"
"<b>Kuldeep traps Dhawan lbw</b>. He then collapses in his followthrough while appealing. Kuldeep loops it up on middle stump, straight ball, Dhawan misses it, looking to drag it away to the leg side with a sweep. He is pinned on the back thigh in line with middle. That's pretty adjacent and KKR find their first breakthrough"
"lovely dip and turn for Kuldeep, Williamson does not meet the pitch and squirts a leading edge to the leg side"
"tossed on middle and turns away, googly? Saha now squirts a leading edge to point"
"full and wide outside off, Williamson collapses his back knee and drives it through the covers"
"<strong>Kuldeep has dismissed Dhawan and Williamson in the same over</strong>. He leaps for joy and celebrates. Williamson knows he has nicked off and walks off.

"good length and spins away outside off, blocked off the back foot"
"back of a length and outside off, tucked around the corner"

"back of a length on a fourth-stump line, punched through the line to short cover"
short and skids back in to hit Shakib on the mid-riff. He sneaks in a leg bye and another off a ricochet
another big appeal for lbw. Did that pitch outside the line of leg stump? Umpire Nitin Menon shoots down the appeal. DK calls for a review. Saha aims a sweep and <b>smothers it with the bat</b>
"floated up on middle, Saha stretches out and paddles it fine of Narine at short fine leg. Narine simply escorts it to the boundary"

"tossed up slower and higher outside off, Saha stretches out for a sweep and nails it to the left of deep square leg for four"
"right int he slot, drilled to deep extra cover. Juicy from PC to his old KKR mate"
"<strong>leading edge but safe</strong>, just eludes point. Shakib wanted to muscle this googly over deep midwicket"
"this is sensational from DK, not so much for the effort but for the alertness. This fizzing googly drifts in from length to hit Saha on the pad as he looks to defend, rolls to Karthik off the pad. By now, Saha is overbalanced and Karthik picks up the ball and breaks the bails even as Saha turns and looks to plonk the bat back in. The only reason why the third umpire was summoned perhaps was to check if the bails were broken by the gloves without the ball lodged in."
"struck on the pad, but impact outside off. This was another googly, beat his prod and deflected towards shirt third man. Impact outside off as well."
"chops this into the off side as he shaped to cut, <strong>cramped for room</strong>"
"spins away from length on off, punched to deep cover"

"backs away and gets underneath the flight to drill this, beats wide long-off. Gave all his might. Just a little bit of width that time from Chawla, punished."
"backs away to cut again, beaten. Wasn't far from the off stump."
"turns this googly towards midwicket, Chawla runs quickly to his left to prevent a single"
"hammered back on the bounce, good stop off his own bowling"

backs away and then slaps this short delivery on middle and leg to sweeper cover.
"floated outside off as Hooda advances, he reaches out and slices this over the infield, Uthappa was circling below the ball and <strong>allowed it to bounce</strong> before he took it at deep cover."
dabs this gently to short third man for a quick single.
"<B> Backing up too far and Shakib's gone! </b> Full on middle, this has been drilled back straight. This flicks Kuldeep's fingers along the way and smashes into the stumps even as Shakib is nowhere near the crease at the non-striker's end. This is a big, big moment in the game."
"clean strike down the ground! Tossed up, he gets right to the pitch and belts this over the sightscreen."
"full and flat outside off, hit hard to long off"
hits this full toss down to long on to get off the mark
"quicker one at length and angling away, punched to long off"
"prods forward tentatively but had no clue about that googly, whizzes past the outside edge."
punched to sweeper cover
full ball that drifts in to hit the pad as he looks to work this gently into the leg side
leading edge but safe. Rolls between cover and point for a quick single.
"goes for a mow, played too early and missed. Hit high on the right thigh."
"the reverse sweep, but there's no timing because of the length. Straight to point. The bounced more than Hooda would've liked. First wicket for Narine on the night."
"skids one at length outside off, Yusuf lunges forward and <strong>leaves alone</strong>"
"full and wide outside off, laced to sweeper cover"
<strong>No power on the pull.</strong> Slower length ball which Yusuf drags from outside off to deep square on the bounce.
"right into the blockhole, base of middle stump, Carlos manages to dig this out"
"misses a yorker, turns this into juicy full toss on middle and he muscles this over wide long-on. Too easy"
flirts with the wide line. Saw the batsman backing away and bowled this wide. Easy call for Nitin Menon
"stunning effort in the deep by Nitish Rana! This is yorker-length outside off, Carlos carves this with an opened bat face towards square third man, where he covers at least 20 yards around the ropes before diving. Recovers quickly and then throws right on the bounce to DK who whips the bails off to beat a diving Carlos."
thick outside edge that beats a leaping DK. Looked to hoick this across the line
"gets more elevation than distance, Piyush Chawla running in from sweeper cover takes an excellent catch! Yusuf looked to go over long-off, sliced it. That said the ball was swirling, curved away late even as Chawla misjudged it as it descended. Somehow managed to stay low and complete it despite this being away from his body."
"<strong>beaten for pace! 142.4kph</strong>. Short of length outside off, Rashid looks to punch on the up but is beaten"
"<b> bursts through Chawla's hands at deep point for six! </b> Steps out and slaps this length ball, would've been straight down his throat had he stayed right at the ropes. May have come in a little too much"
drills this straight to the man at the edge of the ring at cover.
"backs away and looks to eases this slower length ball over point, beaten."
"carved deep into the stands at deep cover. Chawla can only watch this sail over! Mavi went full and wide, Rashid was down on one knee as he reached out and then hammered that away"
"backs away and uses the width to slice this over backward point, clever from Bhuvi"
"full and angling into middle and leg, whipped to deep midwicket"
"slower and fuller on middle, he holds his shape and then lofts this cleanly over the bowler's head. Long-off was in so all he needed to do was loft this over the infield"
"<strong>remember that stroke!</strong> So reminiscent of that flick Carlos hit to win the World T20! Full and sliding in, Rashid takes a step outside off and brings his powerful wrists to flick this over deep backward square leg. Sensational. Used the depth of the crease superbly"
"full but far too wide outside off, pressure getting to Prasidh"
has he clobbered this or what? Not much timing but plonks between the man running in from square leg and the boundary rider. They're back for the second.
"slower delivery, he fetches this from way outside off and muscles this over long-on. Is this a game-changing knock? Stunning hitting. Once again Prasidh lost his length, bowled too full. Rashid was expecting it as he waited, waited, waited and then clobbered it away."

"back of a length and swings back in from outside off, Lynn throws his bat at ball and only collects fresh air"

"short at Narine's arm pit, 144.6ks, cramps the batsman for room, flapped away to square leg"
"Smashed flat and hard for six. Length ball, angling away from Lynn, he backs away outside leg, fetches it from outside off and smears it over the covers"
"full-toss angling away outside off, Narine now clears his front leg and crunches it to the left of covers for four"
"Bhuvneshwar errs too full and outside off, Narine gets under the length of this slower ball and carts it over mid-off inside the circle"
"back of a length on the hips, 142.1ks, Narine clears his front leg again, this time he drags it away square of short fine leg for a <strong>hat-trick of boundaries</strong>"
"<b>Make that four boundaries in a row</b>. Knuckle ball, but the length is shortish. Narine reads the change-up. Clears his front leg and hoists it over the bowler's head"

"dipping full-toss, swings away late, Narine toe-ends it in the air to the left of Shakib at cover"

"full-toss on middle, 140ks, backs away and splices it to the left of a diving Brathwaite at mid-off"
"Rashid belts out an appeal for leg before. Umpire Nitin Menon calls it not out. Rashid chats with Saha and asks for a review. Pushed through on middle, skids off the pitch, and looks like <strong>Lynn has tickled the ball with the glove</strong> as he shapes to sweep. Ultra Edge detects a spike"
"full on off, Lynn rolls out another sweep, this is hit along the ground to long leg"
"<strong>googly</strong>, zips away outside off, keeps low and beats Rana"

"pushed through on middle, Rana rolls out the reverse-sweep and hits it between backward point and short third man for four"
"worked off the pads through midwicket. Rashid runs in from the deep, gathers the ball cleanly, and throws it to keeper. Saha does the rest. Rana chances a second. He slips after completing the first, still goes for the second, dishes out a desperate dive, but is caught short. The second wasn't on after the tumble. Fine throw from Rashid"

"<b> there's the key wicket</b>  and he can't remain unbeaten tonight, though. This is superb from Shakib. Gets the ball to drift back in a long way from around the stumps, skid through to cramp Karthik for room as he shaped to cut. This didn't turn and took the underedge onto the stumps."
"<B> fifth successive sweep </b> he's played off Rashid. Not controlled, on the bounce to square leg"

"punched to midwicket where there's a misfield by a diving Dhawan, some hesitation as well but they complete the run"
"did that take the edge? Yes! Russell played down the wrong line, the ball drifted in, he played outside the line. Lobbed off the pad as Saha fluffed it as he went for the catch. <b> Tough chance, big inside edge onto pad </b>"
crunching cover drive to the sweeper
"dabs this gently into the off side, towards short third man"
"fizzing legbreak that he lands at length, defended from the crease."
"they've prised him out with the googly! Big, big wicket. He's off on a victory lap. Dhawan at a wide slip takes a smart catch. This is a googly that comes back in from length outside off, he goes for a hard cut shot but gets a thick outside edge. Dhawan's reflexes simply superb."
"sharp turn, comes back in to beat the inside edge and hit him on the pad"
defends this length ball on middle with soft hands

"slower length ball on middle, punched to Dhawan at deep cover"
"slips this full delivery way down leg, good take by Saha. Wide called and rightly so"
"he's hit this into his hometown Moradabad! Remember the shot! Full and angling in full, Chawla had decided he'll heave this come hell or high water, got enough bat on it. Wild hit, way over deep midwicket."

"angles this full delivery into the base of leg stump to cramp Gill, who works this to deep midwicket"
paddled but can't beat the fine leg fielder.
"<b> belted back, Bhuvi gets a hand, but it will be cruel to call that a chance! </b> Deflects this to the boundary. So hard was that hit by Gill. Much-needed for KKR."
"the off stump has been flattened! Chawla went to wallop this over long-off, swung through early, missed it and heard the death rattle. Cross-seam delivery this from Kaul, landed just a touch ahead of length. Chawla didn't get anywhere close to that. KKR right on the edge."
"another ripper of a yorker, squeezed to cover but they chance a run. <strong>Williamson misses</strong> a direct hit at the striker's end. Gill would've been walking back had that hit. Had three stumps to aim at"

"carved to sweeper cover, SRH won't mind the singles."
"lofted over the infield, but Williamson, running back from cover, can't get there. They scamper back for the second"
he's cleared the ropes! Uses the depth of the crease to get under the length and belt this over wide long-off. This is magnificent. The match is alive.
"sliced over backward point, one bounce into the ropes. Poor from Carlos, bowls too full and straight. Enough pace for Mavi to work with"
"he's whipped this straight to Rashid at deep midwicket. Wasn't far from clearing the ropes, right intent. Just the execution was a little off. Mavi backed away, got under the delivery and hit it well. Rashid was on the move to his left, kept his composure and took this. The crucial thing from KKR's point of view is Shubman Gill will be on strike."
"<strong>he's picked out Rashid at deep midwicket!</strong> Oh, dear. Surely that's the end of KKR's hopes? This was hit well, but he got more elevation than distance. Swirling in the air, Rashid came in from the ropes and then took it well with his palms facing upwards. Brathwaite's decision of going around the stumps to cramp the batsmen for room has worked so far. Is that the final nail in KKR's coffin?"
"right into the blockhole outside off, dug back. He goes for the catch but he took it on the bounce."
"walks across to paddle fine, but misses. It's all but over now."
"drilled down to long-off, but it doesn't matter. <b> SRH have arrested a four-match losing streak </b> and will play Chennai Super Kings in Sunday's final. <b> KKR's campaign has come to a shuddering halt </b>"
