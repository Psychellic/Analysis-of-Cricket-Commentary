"<b>given lbw!</b> Suryakumar's reviewing. Full just outside off, and he tries to paddle it towards the leg side. But he got his front leg across the stumps, and that's plumb if you miss the shot. The ball stayed slightly low, and replays say 'umpire's call'"
"back of a length on off and that's nipped in sharply! Cuts the batsman in half, and the ball goes between bat and elbow. QDK dives to his left and takes a one hander and appeals for caught behind. The umpire says not out. <b>QDK wants to review</b> and yes! That's come off the inside shoulder of the bat. Big deflection"
"<b>hits him just under his throat!</b> Pollard doesn't react. Short on off, and Pollard takes a step forward before choosing not to duck. The ball's well directed and I can't believe Pollard shows no emotion"

"good length on off, and angling sharply into his body. Tries to flick it towards short fine leg, but can't get bat on ball. Hits his thigh pad instead"

"overpitched outside off, and that's been drilled to McCullum at mid off. Could be a run out, but it's not a direct hit! Oh dear, no one's backing up either. Chahal and Siraj try hard to stop the ball near the boundary, but it's a futile attempt by both men. Free runs for Mumbai to end the Powerplay"

"good length on off, and once again spinning wildly after hitting the surface. Hardik's in no place to punch it towards cover"

"<B>big appeal!</b> But not given. Full on off, but Hardik misses the sweep. Would've missed off stump, reckons umpire Erasmus"

"misses the cut! Was wide outside off, and Hardik will be disappointed on missing out. Could've placed that anywhere behind square on the off side"
"good length outside off, but it's the offcutter. Cramped for room, and manages to only muscle it towards cover. The mistimed shot actually allows them to take the single with ease"
"full outside off, and that's been lifted over cover! In the air for a while, and drops between the three people in the deep. The ball changes direction after pitching, so Vohra's on all fours trying to stop the ball. Comedy of errors. Kohli won't find it funny though"

"slower ball, on off stump. It's angling across his body, but Krunal's leg-side heave is mistimed. Goes to long off instead"

"yorker just outside off, and Hardik does well to squeeze it past Krunal. But where's his bat?! It flew off his gloves and landed near the keeper. Sweaty evening"
"<b>that defied the laws of Physics!</b> Full on leg stump, and Krunal got down on one knee to ramp it over fine leg. Takes the leading edge, and goes to...wait for it...point."
"full and wide outside off, and Hardik can't connect with the drive. Through to QDK on the full. Excellent ball given the game situation"
"full outside off, and all Hardik can do is muscle a drive to wide long off. <b>His 2nd IPL fifty</b>"
"knee-high full toss outside off, and Cutting muscles a pull to cow corner. De Grandhomme saves some more runs in the deep with a sliding effort"
"<b>Is that the game?!</b> Full on off, and Hardik drills it straight to long on. Dives forward and takes an excellent tumbling catch. What a change in attitude though. Kohli took a similar catch two nights ago, but didn't show any emotion that evening. Today he's ecstatic"
"full outside off, and Cutting drags the slog towards the leg side. Deceived by the slower ball, but enough power behind that shot to beat deep midwicket"
"full outside off, and the expansive drive takes the inside edge. Goes to square leg"
"back of a length outside off, but Southee takes the pace off it. Pulled to cow corner, but these are consolation runs"
excellent yorker! Ricochets it onto his toes while trying to squeeze this out
"<b>ends with a sixer!</b> But it doesn't matter for RCB. Full outside off, and Cutting slogs this over long off to finish the game on a semi-high. <B>Royal Challengers Bangalore win by 14 runs!</b>"
