"decent nip to start from Steyn, angling a length delivery across Dickwella, who pushes to cover"
"<b>a drive, an edge, and Miller holds a simple catch!</b> This must be some sort of record - two balls into his wicketkeeping career, he's got a catch. It was a nice, easy one too, flying through at head height and straight to him. The feet didn't even need to move. And didn't"
"nice shape from Steyn, curving the ball away outside off stump as Kusal leaves it alone"
"another outswinger, and this one is punched neatly to cover point - straight at the field"
"lift and movement outside off! Steyn bustles in and bursts one past Kusal, who pulls his bat well inside the line"
"and again! Kusal just dropped the hands as this one fizzed away from him outside off. Cracking start from Steyn, who is still a handful in any format, and marks his comeback to T20Is with a wicket maiden"
"and he hits a length on off stump to start, Avishka defending the 141km/h delivery"
"fuller this time, and a touch of seam into him at 143km/h as Avishka flicks to midwicket"
"<b>biffed over long on!</b> Huge hit from Avishka, who kept his shape in the shot. And it's his first scoring shot in this format for Sri Lanka"
"Avishka stays deep in the crease, nudging into the leg side"
"big swish outside off, Kusal throwing his hands through a drive but hitting only fresh air. Perhaps he was beaten for pace - KG's up at 148km/h"
"<b>chipped to mid on!</b> Kusal drives uppishly, and the ball carries straight to Sipamla in the position for an easy catch - his first in international cricket"
"full, and nipping away from him at 143km/h as Avishka pokes to cover"
"change-up from Steyn, sending this one down at just 128km/h. Avishka has a look, and lets it go"
"even slower from Steyn, lobbing this one down at 120km/h, but it's read and nudged to mid on"
"short, and it's pulled out to the man at deep square"
"he's off the mark straight away, pushing a drive to Phehlukwayo at cover and pinching a quick single"
"<b>pulled in front of square!</b> Avishka rocks back into an imperious pull, hitting it 68 metres onto the grass banks and well in front of square. Caught in the crowd, too. And the catcher is subsequently engulfed by his mates and doused in beer. The ball might come back a little tipsy ..."
"sharp yorker! Rabada endangers the toes with a full one, but Kamindu does well to keep it out"
"<b>in the air, but safe!</b> Kamindu looks to clear square leg, but he doesn't get a great strike. It is enough to evade the infield though"
pushed softly to mid on
"tip-and-run single to end the over, the call coming nice and early as the ball rolls to cover"
"<b>top edged, and over third man!</b> Rabada slings down a back of a length delivery that spits up at Kamindu, who swings wildly at it, looking to attack the leg side. The ball goes in the other direction, clearing third man"
"<b>same direction, but with authority this time</b>. Kamindu leans back and plays a fluent ramped uppercut, the ball <i>just</i> clearing the boundary"
"fired in full and at the pads, Avishka flicking to midwicket for a single"
"again Steyn attacks the stumps, Kamindu pinging the leg side field with a glance"
"flicked in the air towards short fine leg, and the ball dips awkwardly and bounces in front of Duminy, who dives but can't get his hands to it. Steyn's not happy"
"thumped down the ground! Kamindu is in a rush, and though his bottom hand takes over this drive and the bat turns in his hands, he hits it straight enough and hard enough to beat the field"
"pushed to cover, and they pinch a quick single"
"Avishka taps to cover and wants a single, but he's sent back"
"and he shoots a length delivery across Kamindu's bows first up, the ball chopped to cover"
"slung down very full but towards the leg side, and Avishka gets a bit of boot on it to collect a leg bye"
"Kamindu flings his hands through a drive outside off, the ball shooting off the inside half of the bat and into the leg side"
"<b>excellent work on the boundary by Hendricks!</b> Avishka heaved mightily at a length delivery, a slower cutter, and got some serious air on the shot, but Reeza made ground at the boundary and demonstrated superb spatial awareness, holding the catch inches from the rope, lobbing the ball back into play as his momentum carried him over, and then popping back in to hold the catch. Good stuff"
"<b>uppish!</b> He's forward to drive, but without much control. Fortunately the ball dips in front of cover ..."
"Sipamla aims full and straight to finish, at 133km/h, and then fields in his follow through as the ball is pushed back at him"
"Tahir spears in a legbreak on off stump, and they take on point for a quick single. The shy is accurate, and it's a direct hit, but he's safely home and they steal another run off the ricochet"
"a solid drive bursts through the hands of a diving cover, Reeza sprinting in from the ropes to keep them to one"
worked into the leg side for one
"googly from Tahir, but it's read by Angelo and kept out with a forward defensive"
"pushed back down the ground, but Tahir dives across to save the run"
"this one is held back at 76km/h, and there's some turn and bounce as a result, but it's pushed behind point for a single"
"very full outside off at 139km/h, and it's driven out to the sweeper"
"<b>cracked back at the bowler</b>, who can't get his hands to it in his follow through and misses the chance - albeit a difficult one. And that also <b>brings up the fifty</b>"
"flicked off the pads and out to Andile at deep square, turning the strike over"
"full, and it's dug out to mid on. Faf has a shy, but Angelo calls early and is safely home at the danger end"
"Sipamla pulls his length back, Kamindu rolling his wrists over a pull into the deep"
"offcutter to end the over, at 125km/h, and it's dead-batted towards cover"
"and he hits a length, just outside off, Angelo threading a drive just past cover"

"full, on off stump, and it's pushed to cover for a single"
Kamindu whips his wrists over a full one and finds a single near midwicket

"floated up just outside off and breaking back into the left hander, who pushes back to the bowler"
Kamindu is forward to drive to long off
"<b>big turn for Tahir!</b> It's flighted, dips on the batsman, and rips past a slog into the leg side"
pushed to mid on for a quick single
"Kamindu turns into a reverse sweep at a low full toss, the fielder in the deep cleaning up"
"slashed up and over extra cover! Plenty of bottom hand in the shot, and he places it very nicely, well wide of long off"
"<b>chipped in the air, but safe!</b> De Kock is the man at cover, and he sprints and dives across the practice pitch but he can't quite get to it. That would have been a first!"
"<b>bowled him!</b> Phehlukwayo aims full with a cross-seamed delivery, the ball zipping through Angelo's slog and smashing into the stumps"
"dug in short by Phehlukwayo, and though it's only 125km/h Thisara ducks well under it"
"whipped powerfully off the pads, but there's protection in the deep"
"it's short again, but too short and too wide outside off"
"tapped into the gap between mid off and cover, and they sprint through for a quick single"
<b>beaten outside off!</b> Phehlukwayo hits the channel and Thisara punches inside the line
"<b>stumped!</b> Wonderfully bowled by Tahir, fizzing a googly past the advancing Kamindu, the ball gripping and spinning past him. Behind the stumps, Miller reads it, takes it cleanly, and whips the bails off in a flash. A catch, and now a stumping! Tahir sets off to celebrate with the crowd near midwicket as his team-mates mob Miller"
"pushed down to long on, and he's off the mark straight away"
"punted back in the air, but well wide of Tahir, and down to long off for a single"

"Dhananjaya angles his bat on a full one, but he can't get past Rassie in the gully"
"Dhananjaya's slightly squared up by a length delivery that holds its line, pushing to cover"
"short at 134km/h, and Dhananjaya hammers a pull but finds Reeza at deep square leg"

Thisara keeps his bat straight to drive to de Kock at long off
"very full, and it's dug out back to the bowler, 8th dot ball for Tahir"
"googly to finish, and it's floated up nice and high, but read and manoeuvred past midwicket"
"pushed down the leg side, and he'll have to bowl that one again"
"hurled down the leg side again, and KG's not quite found his radar yet"
"that's better, honing in on off stump and it's pushed towards cover, where they take on the fielder for a quick single"
"another one! Speared way too far outside off. And Umpire Jele also warns Rabada about his front foot as well, which apparently is too close to the line"
"chipped up and over cover, and they're back for a second to <b>raise the hundred</b>"
"short and rising outside off stump, and Thisara is peeved with himself as he misses an uppercut"
"slapped out through cover, Reeza making ground in the deep to save the boundary"
"Thisara has a heave at a full one, the ball flying past his outside edge and Miller doing a functional job of stopping it behind the stumps"
"Thisara is cramped for room as he cuts, and in any case finds the point fielder"
"<b>edged</b>, well wide of Miller and bouncing down to third man, where Rabada puts in a committed dive and saves two runs. He had just been moved finer by Steyn at the start of the over"
"Dhananjaya backs away and hacks, the ball leaping over his head and carrying at head height through to Miller"
"slower ball from Steyn, down to 118km/h, and the ball comes off the inside half of a heave, rolling through square leg"
"slugged down the ground, and de Kock runs across to stop it at long off. He flings in a throw, which Steyn lets past him as he walks back to his mark, but the ball hits a footmark as it reaches Miller, bouncing right through his legs for more runs. Quinny can see the funny side down at the boundary, but I'm not sure Steyn is smiling"
"dug in short and fast, the ball bursting past Dhananjaya's pull"
"chopped out through cover, just the single"
"big heave from Dhananjaya, but he can only find a single to long on"
"Sipamla comes around the stumps, angling the ball in and then seaming it away to <b>beat Thisara outside off</b>"
"canny slower ball from Sipamla, the change-up arriving at just 120km/h as Thisara is too early into a swipe outside off"
"<b>short, and it's hit him!</b> Thisara aimed to pull, but the bouncer hit him on the peak of the helmet instead, and they run through for a single. The umpire's check with Thisara, and the physio is out too, but Thisara insists he's good to go"
"short of a length, outside off at 136km/h, and it's mistimed down the ground through mid on"
"another lovely slower cutter from Sipamla at 120km/h, and Thisara takes his bottom hand off the bat as he flaps it in the air out to long on, the ball bouncing safely in the outfield"
"<b>caught by du Plessis at long off!</b> Phehlukwayo starts with a slower ball at just 110km/h, and Thisara slices under his heave down the ground. Faf takes a few steps in, then stops and tumbles backwards as the ball reaches him, holding the catch cleanly, and Phehlukwayo has his second"
"<b>bowled him!</b> Dhananjaya walks across a seam-up delivery, bowled at 126km/h, looking to lap it up and over short fine leg. But he goes too far across it with Andile targeting the stumps, and he's bowled. <b>Phehlukwayo is on a hat-trick!</b>"
"and it's kept out! Phehlukwayo aims a very full one at middle and leg, but Akila's bat is down in time to jam it out"
"yet another dot for Andile, the fourth of the over, as Akila digs another full one out to cover"
"<b>slashed over extra cover</b>, Akila making room and making sure to slap a full one over the infield, placing it wide of long off"
"<b>edged to the boundary!</b> Andile aims full outside off with a quicker ball and Akila swings wildly at it, a thick edge going wide of Miller and bouncing down to third man"
"dot to start! Rabada aims full outside off, and Udana swings a drive airily past the ball"
"<b>dropping short of third man!</b> Udana slices under a back-of-a-length outside off, and Tahir comes in from the boundary, but decides at the last moment not to go for it as the ball bounces awkwardly in front of him"
"short, Udana heaves and a top edge flies over the keeper and down to the boundary"
"Rabada aims full at 148km/h, Udana letting his bottom hand do the work to collect two runs out to deep midwicket"
"another short one, and it's nippy at 146km/h but too short and it's called wide. Rabada walks muttering back to his mark. It's not quite been his day today"
"slapped airily out into the deep, the ball landing in no-man's land to the left of Faf at long off"
"<b>edged, and dropped by Tahir at third man!</b> It wasn't an easy chance as once again the ball was dipping on Tahir even as he ran forward towards it. He got the hands to it, but it popped out like a bar of soap and slipped out of his grasp"
"full toss, very wide outside off, and de Kock stretches towards the ball to tap it away"
"full on off, and de Kock pushes forward to drive. <B>Huge outside edge</b> and this flies past the keeper's left"
"length ball on leg, and worked off his pads to square leg. No chance of a single"
"full on off, and he tries to muscle a shot to the leg side. Muscled to mid-on"
"slower ball, full outside off and jagging away from de Kock. He's through his attempted drive too early and the outside edge falls just short of Vandersay at short third man! <b>Vandersay's left hand is bleeding</b>"
"another jaffa to end the over. Slower ball on off, and angling away from de Kock. Mistimes his drive as the ball whizzes past his outside edge"
"offspin, outside off and turning inwards. Worked off his pads to the leg side"
"faster one, length outside off, and the attempted off-side punch takes the <B>outside edge!</b> Races away to the third-man boundary"

"length ball on off, and de Kock makes room to cut. Mistimed to point"
"low full toss on leg, and de Kock makes room before slogging over mid-on. One-bounce four"
"<b>top-edged</b> over square leg! Lands safely beyond the two infielders, but de Kock wants the third run and this could be trouble. Is Reeza short? Looks like it! South Africa get two runs, but Dickwella has run Hendricks out at the batsman's end"
"length ball on off, and turning inwards sharply. Faf goes onto the back foot, and surprisingly plays this towards the leg side"
"nearly a yorker on leg, and he thumps this straight to the bowler. Dhananjaya gets a hand to it, but can't stop the run"

"full on off, and the wrong'un is driven with the turn to long on"
"full on off, and he tries to play the reverse sweep again. Misses the shot altogether, and it hits Dickwella's gloves"
"full outside leg, and skidding into him. He makes room to tap this down to mid-on, but the ball hits his thigh guard and rolls down to third man"
"full on leg, and tapped back to the bowler. He fields swiftly and throws it back to the keeper"
"full on middle, and it skids through to Faf. Tries to muscle a shot towards the leg side, and he's very nearly stumped! Dickwella can't hold on though"

"full on off, and driven to Dhananjaya off the front foot"
"<b>soft dismissal!</b> Length ball on leg, and de Kock goes for a reverse paddle. He gloves the ball, and it's lobbed in the air. Dickwella stays at his spot and takes the easiest of catches behind the stumps"

"length ball, turning away from him and punched to cover"
"full on leg, and going further down. Faf goes for an expansive sweep, but the extra turn does him in"

"full on middle, and turning away from Miller. He drills a straight drive to long off"

"full toss on his hips, and whipped away to deep midwicket. Goes to the fielder on the bounce"
"<b>is that run out?</b> Udana isn't sure so he wants the umpire to check. This was muscled to deep midwicket, and Miller was coming back for the second run. Throw from the deep hits Udana's hands before it dislodges the bails. Miller, though, is certain he's in"

"slower ball, full and wide outside off, and he drags a shot to deep midwicket. Duminy wants the second run, but there's no way he'll be able to make it back. Throw from the deep is flat and straight, and Dickwella affects another run out! Duminy gone"
"<B>It's a Super Over!</b> Dickwella has missed the easiest run-out of his life. Length ball on off, and Dickwella tries to cut, but the ball's been under-edged to Dickwella. Steyn runs from the other end, and Dickwella takes aim at all three stumps, but he misses! This is a tie (for now)"
