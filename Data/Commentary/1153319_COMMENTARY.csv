length ball curves away from off stump and forces Lewis to check this drive. Hurriedly taps it into the covers
length ball slanted in at leg stump. Allows that to come on and clips it to fine leg's right off the back foot
"length ball pushed down leg side, and too far away for connection"
"<b>lifts it to the fine leg boundary.</b> This is short, not very fast, and climbing up at Lewis' hips. He rocks back and uses the angle to ramp it over short fine. Just falls inside the rope"
length ball swings away late outside off. Looks to drive that initially but changes his mind and lets it go
"<b>outside edge</b> over short third man. Full outswinger wide outside off, chucks his bat at it and since the fielder is up, it's not fatal. Clears that man and picks up four more"
"length on leg stump, tapped to long-on on the up"
"full indipper starts on leg stump and fizzes past leg stump and his pads as he looks to flick. He was late on that, but the line wasn't great"
"short of a length on leg stump, nudged to short fine's left off the back foot"
"length and just outside off, defended into the covers off the back foot"
"short and wide outside off, some shape away. Gets the cut off the toe-end to extra cover"

"short of a length at leg stump, gets the front leg up in the air and whips this behind deep square"
"length ball in the corridor outside off, looks to pump this over midwicket on the up, beaten on the inside edge"
"<b>massive!</b> Sweet hit from Lewis. Full ball floated up just outside off. No movement on it and he swings ever so cleanly and looks to go straight throughout. Over the bowler's head. Clean, and long - <b>104 metres</b>"
"<b>and again.<b/> Straight over the bowler. It's a slower ball this time, but it's still overpitched outside off. Waits on it a little and this time it's 92 metres"
attempted bouncer is too short and slides down leg side. Lewis lets it go
"<b>clears the long-off boundary now!</b> Oh he's in panic right now. He's gone seam-up, offcutter, bouncer and now he goes cross-seam. It's length outside off, and Lewis gets the front leg out to slice this over the wide long-off region"
"bouncer at the chest. Looks to hook from under it, ends up slicing it into the vacant backward square leg area"
"nicely bowled. A slower bouncer, climbs over off stump after it beats his pull on the under-edge"
"<b>one more time.</b> Lewis is unrelenting. A fourth six over the bowler! Overpitched just outside off, mid-off is still in so Lewis has no reason to try and keep this down. Clears the boundary with ease"
"heaves it wide of long-on. Full ball just outside off, plants the front leg out and miscues the slog sweep, but there are only so many fielders outside in the Powerplay"
"full on leg stump, jammed down to long-on off the toe-end"
"yorker length just outside off, no room to swing. Jams it into the covers"
"<b>whack!</b> Such a clean hitter. It's unreal sometimes. Mehidy lobs up his first ball this spell and he's punished immediately. It's a length ball just outside off, Lewis gets down on one knee and uses the angle into him to slog sweep with some power"
"short of a length outside off, sitting up for the cut and he watches it turn before slapping it past extra cover"
"<b>dropped!</b> Abu Hider! Not a great evening for him so far. Length ball at middle stump, he looks to slog sweep again but drags it off the inside half. Still has some force on that. Hider can't hold on with the reverse cup at midwicket"
<b>fifty</b> in the fifth over. Tossed up at off stump from around the wicket and he drives neatly to mid-off's left
"floated up outside off, uses the angle to slug this off the front foot. It's off the inside half and trickles past mid-on. Deep midwicket cleans up the left"
<b>clears the wide long-on boundary this time.</b> He's made a slog look classy. Length ball at off stump and he gets right under it to swing cleanly
"length at middle stump, gets on the back foot to try and flick but he closes the face too early on it. Leading edge falls safely in front of extra cover"
that's poor bowling. Short ball at middle stump. All he has to do is get deep in the crease and lift this pull over square leg
"<b>does him with the loopy ball.</b> Nicely done from Shakib. Lobs it right up, excruciatingly slow at a middle stump line. Hope wants to sweep but he's through it too quickly. Beaten and bowled"
short of a length just outside off. Tapped down the pitch on the up
short ball at a leg stump line. Pulls of the toe-end to long-on's left
"yorker outside off, met on the full but thumped straight off the toe-end. Was looking to clear the front leg and get this wide of mid-off"
"bouncer in the corridor. Makes room and looks to wallop this, but it flies over the blade"
<b>clears mid-off.</b> Not there. Not today. Full outside off and Lewis is not letting anything go from that area. Gets the front leg out of the way and drills it flat
"<b>see ya!</b> I don't know if we can measure hits this big. Short ball at the hips, swivels and gets his weight moving away from the ball so he can get leverage on this. And then swipes to get it right off the middle and far far over square leg. A good over flips upside down in two balls. <b>107 metres!</b>"
short ball at the front shoulder. Late on the hook but he's safe as this lobs over the keeper. Short fine cleans up
short ball cuts away from middle stump and squares him up. Watches it closely as he looks to defend and is wrapped on the knuckles
"<b>taken at deep square!</b> Clears the front leg and looks to get inside the line to break the shackles on this short bowling. Looks to pull it far, but it was rising on him all the time. Slices it up and it is taken"
"<b>clears long-off!</b> Wow. If you don't bowl outside off, he'll just walk into the leg side and hit it there anyway. Full and in at leg stump. Exposes all the stumps and slaps it flat to clear the fielder in the deep"
"short ball in the corridor, gets on top of it and tucks it to deep square"
short of a length and angling away from off stump. Jabs at it and gets a thick outside edge down to third man

"length at leg stump, flicked to short fine's left"

"short of a length outside off, backs away and slaps to long-off"
"length ball pushed wide outside off from around the wicket, left alone"
"<b>shot!</b> Crafty. Mustafiz going around the wicket is giving Lewis the angle he usually gives a right hander. Except he always has a third man for the right hander. For Lewis, that man is in. He gets behind the line and chops it deftly"
"aaaaand once more. This is not a great ploy from Mustafiz. Short and angled across him again, and he cuts it wider of short third man now"
"short ball in the corridor, arches back and lets it go. That got big on him"
"full on leg stump, gets the front leg out of the way and drives along the floor to long-on's left"
"offcutter at a length, wide outside off. Swipes at it and is beaten"
"full toss at leg stump, taps it down to long-on"
"dropped short outside off, hammered to long-off's right off the back foot and Powell is very alert to the fielder's languid approach. Pinches the second to get Lewis back in strike"
"<b>hits off stump!</b> That's good, experienced bowling. Like Shakib had done earlier, Mahmudullah slows it down and Lewis is through the shot early. An attempted slog sweep goes past the inside edge and the bullying ends for the home team. What an innings from Lewis."
"<b>Hetmyer reviews the lbw straight away.</b> Mahmudullah back around the wicket, tosses it up and hits the pad as Hetmyer looks to flick. Looked very adjacent that, but has he got bat on it? <b>Ultra Edge says no edge.</b> And it's clipping leg stump. Umpire's call. West Indies retain the review, but they have a collapse to contend with now. And Mahmudullah is on a hat-trick."
"short of a length just outside off, gets deep in the crease and slices it to point"
"full on off stump, tapped back to the bowler"
"length ball at off stump, driven on the rise to long-off"
"<b>so easy.</b> Wow. With a line-up like theirs, there's no way West Indies are going to rebuild. That is for lesser mortals, says Pooran, as he gets the front leg out of the way and launches Shakib flat over the wide long-on boundary"
"full on leg stump, pushed back to the bowler"
"length at off stump, tapped to extra cover"

<b>beaten in flight.</b> Length ball at off stump. Steps out but is forced to get behind and defend
"full outside off, creams it along the floor to long-on"
"<b>over the square leg boundary.</b> Dropped short at a leg stump line, from around the wicket. Pooran's not letting that go. Gets back in the crease and pulls imperiously"
"<b>drilled.</b> Long-off has no chance, ten yards to his right. This is full and outside off and he stays leg side of it before chucking the bat at it"
"length ball fired down leg side from around the wicket, past the attempted flick"
"oh wow. Well adjusted. Dropped short outside off and he wants to hammer this with a flat bat. It sticks in the pitch a little through so he places it - wide of long-off, on the rise"
"length at middle stump, tapped into the midwicket region"
"floated up slow outside off. Looks to whip it inside-out, gets an inside edge through square leg"
"length ball pushed past and wide outside off, left alone"
<b>finds deep midwicket!</b> It looks like an attempted quicker ball that has gone wrong. Dropped short at a middle stump line and so he looks to pull it. But it skids through quickly enough to disrupt his swing and he is taken on the line
"full on leg stump, clipped into the midwicket region and Mahmudullah is across quickly to his right to whip a throw back to the keeper. Pooran is diving...it's been sent upstairs. <b>And he has made it.</b> That was unnecessary from West Indies. But they survive."
"another mix-up, but Brathwaite survives this time at the other end. Short of a length ball at leg stump, pokes into the leg side with soft hands and sends his captain back"
"offcutter, short of a length and in the corridor. Watches closely and guides it to third man"
"quick bouncer, nicely directed. Climbs past his attempted hook"
"short of a length in the corridor, punched to point off the back foot"
"short ball at the hips, pulled <b>straight at the leg umpire.</b> And he hits him too. Deflected to deep square's right off his thigh guard. He's alright."
"oh poor line. But nice field awareness from Pooran. Short one rising at his hip, gets the front leg across and in the air as he shovels this past short fine. Deep square runs across and puts in a slide, but the momentum takes it into the boundary"
"short of a length outside off, uppish slice to third man"
"full ball just outside off. Looks to clobber it through cover, but that skids low and past the inside edge"
slower ball at a length outside off. Gets down for the ramp but he has to adjust for the change in pace. Gently taps into the leg side

"yorker at off stump, jabbed past the bowler to mid-off. Off the toe-end"
"full and wide outside off, slices on the up to third man"

"well bowled. Yorker just outside off, looks to carve to third man but is beaten"
"nicely taken at third man! Abu Hider has something to celebrate. Short ball outside off, Pooran loses his shape as he slashes at it with his feet moving into the leg side. Thick outside edge loops up and dips to Hider's left but he lunges to hold on"
"slower ball, short of a length and just outside off. Tickles it to third man"
inside edge over the stumps and to the keeper's right. Short of a length ball in the corridor and he stabs at it away from the body
offcutter jumps up from a length just outside off. Shapes to punch through the off side but this ends up at midwicket off the glove
"<b>and taken at gully!</b> Sharp captaincy from Shakib. Bratwaite's only been looking to poke Mustafiz down to third man, so they cut out that option. It's a length ball, offcutter outside off, and he has a slash at it. Thick edge goes straight to the fielder"
slower ball at a length on leg stump. Pushed into the leg side off the front foot

"full toss on leg stump, clipped to deep square's right"
"full and just outside off. Looks to slog it, beaten on the inside edge. Rahim can't hold on"

length ball flat and skidded away outside off. Looks to drive on the up and is beaten on the outside edge

"length outside off, defended into the off side off the back foot"
"length on leg stump, tapped into the leg side of the back foot"
"<b>mix-up</b> and he won't even get halfway down as the bowler clips the bails off. The umpire probably wants to check if he collected cleanly and took it off with the ball in hand. Because he has sent this upstairs. <b>And that will be out</b> because he has the ball in his hand as his elbow dislodges the bails. For good measure, he also pulls the stumps out. That's good. Length ball hit him on the thigh as he looked to flick and dribbled into the leg side. He switched off to the possibility of the run and was caught napping"

"short of length, exposing his stumps and aims to hit on the up, through the covers, misses"

another short of length delivery but down the leg side this time
"length on middle and leg, tucked away past square leg, who chases and pulls it just inside.

He was getting ready to take strike"

"back of length, aimed at the batsman, defended towards cover"

"length outside off, steered towards wide short third man, who shies at the striker's end to break the stumps, Liton was comfortably in"
"length outside off, picked up non-chalantly, without any fuss, bounces just inside the deep midwicket fence. Given a no ball but replays shows the was a wrong call"

"this has been that kind of an innings, down the leg side this time, another wide"
"fuller around off, Liton looks to go over long-off, ends up slicing it to mid-off who takes it comfortably, but that's been given a no ball, WAIT! Replays show Thomas had some part of his foot behind the line.

"fuller on the stumps, swept and swept fine, short fine leg chases it to keep it to three"
