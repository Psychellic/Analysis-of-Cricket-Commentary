"on the pads to start from the bowler, worked away to square leg"
"short and wide from Dwarshius, an offering and Heazlett spanks a cut through cover point"
"and again, a tad wide outside off, carved away to backward point"
"143 kph, full and wide outside off, swings away. A little bit of shape. A wild swing goes past the bat"
"140 kph, picks up the length so quickly and pulls it away easily over square leg for four. Lovely hit"
"a bit short, and wide again, creeps under the bat"
"flat and quick on middle and leg, nudged to midwicket"

"flatter around off, slashed away to point"
"well bowled, quick down leg, Botha follows the batsman, nudged to square leg"
"98 kph, flat again on middle, no flight, nudged to midwicket"
"and taken by Brathwaite! Massive wicket for the Sixers. McCullum goes early. Full outside off, quick. It's the length that entices McCullum into an expansive stroke. He tries to knock the ball over mid-off, but there is no turn. It skews off the outside half, and looks like it will lob over Carlos at mid-off, but he backtracks and takes a quality catch running back"
"good length and a tad wide outside off, goes past the cut"
"a nice slower delivery outside off, driven away towards cover, the fielder dives to his right to save runs"
"beats the batsman for pace. Good length on leg, the batsman is through the flick too late and the ball hits him in the groin area. Takes off his gloves, smiles at his misfortune and soldiers on"
"good length delivery around off, nudged away to square leg. Four dot balls"
"144 kph, chipped to square leg. That's generally what happens when you play many dots in T20s. He walks across, tries to create a shot but can only toe-end his attempted flick to square leg. A stuttering innings."
"one off the over. Good length around off, inside-edged towards square leg for a single"
"still playing his shots is Heazlett. Short and wide outside off, looks to cut, the ball lobs towards point, falls in front"
"wow, that's interesting batting. Flight on middle and leg, Heazlett clears his front leg and swats his heave to mid-on. Didn't try to consolidate a bad position, instead it gets worse. Wanted to go over mid-on, but didn't get enough elevation"
"flat around off, gets forward and defends"
"86 kph, outside off, driven to cover"
""
"88 kph, shortish and wide, slashed to third man. 3 for 12 after four overs."
"pulled on the bounce to deep square leg. Good length on middle and leg, pulled away to the fielder, on the bounce"
"a thick outside edge down to third man, 137 kph. These two may have to take this deep"
"good length on middle and leg, nudged to deep square leg"
"whew that swung. Full delivery outside off, nips back in, and somehow misses the off stump. Nevill can't collect cleanly either. Maddinson pulls it in just in time"
"and again, 138 kph, goes full and wide outside off, the ball moves back in and beats Ross on the inside edge. May have to tighten up that defense"
"chopped away past point for a couple to third man. Shortish and wide, Ross let that come to him"
"runs down, gets close enough to the pitch and T20s the ball away over midwicket, a flat-batted swat. He played that intentionally straighter to beat the man at deep midwicket"
nudged to midwicket from the crease
"the reverse sweep, flat around off, a thick leading edge towards short third man, on the bounce"

"132 kph, a full delivery outside off, Ross throws his hands at it but the ball goes past the outside edge"
"short and wide from Brathwaite, slashed away in front of point for a couple. Good running, makes the second rather easily"
"over the stumps for two more. Full and straight, hit with the full face of the bat, right back into the surface. That causes it to bounce over the stumps. Long-on cleans up"
"flat around off, nudged with soft hands into the gap at midwicket for two. Nicely played"
clipped away into the gap at square leg
"shortish but straight, Ross backs away and slaps a cut to cover"
"lovely shot. Gives himself some room, backs away and nails a lofted drive over cover with great timing. Just inside the boundary"
"flat on middle and off, reverse-swept away to short third man"
backs away and carves a cut to cover for one
"good length delivery outside off, punched away to cover from the crease"
"edged and Peirson is caught behind. Bigger trouble. Short on the fourth-stump channel. Not wide enough to cut, and Peirson knows that, but he tries to dab the ball to third man for one, but the ball takes the outside edge and carries to Nevill."
"good length on middle and off, worked away towards square leg for one"
"full delivery outside off, dabbed back towards the bowler"
"134 kph, extra bounce. Short on middle and leg, the ball keeps climbing steeply on Ross. Takes the shoulder of the bat and pops towards cover. Lands well short"
"and again. Takes the outside edge this time. And Heat are in massive trouble. It's a good length delivery, on a fourth-stump channel. The ball bounces and seams and moves and jags juust enough to take the outside edge. A thin edge but enough to carry easily again. 5 for 43"
"just wide of deep midwicket, running around. Flight on leg, Cutting backs away and sweeps towards midwicket, who runs to his right but can't get across. The deep square leg fielder does well to prevent the boundary"
pushed away back to the bowler
"flat around middle and off, Cutting flicks past midwicket for a couple more"
"the Heat will keep going. It's the McCullum way of playing cricket, and I don't necessarily disagree with it, but you have to pick your deliveries as well. Flat down leg, follows the batsman. It's the longer boundary that side and Cutting slog-sweeps the ball straight to deep square leg. What is the McCullum way? When you're 5 for 40, you can choose to get to 120 or you can keep going and try to get 150. McCullum almost always prefers the latter. His team will play the same way. Not a bad tactic, but flawed execution in this case"
nudged to midwicket

"short and wide, was there to cut but the ball creeps underneath the bat"
"full delivery outside off, 139 kph, driven to cover from the crease."
"7 for 53! It's a clever change in length, knows there is extra bounce in this surface so he digs this one in around off, Floros is far too late on his pull, the ball hits the splice of the bat and lobs to midwicket for a simple catch. Very shrewd bowling"
"buh-you-tea. Pitches on middle and off, good length delivery. Keeps climbing and moving and jags to beat the outside edge. A top-order batsman may have edged it, like Ross did"

"another dot. Quick on leg, clipped to midwicket"
"flat around off, Steketee backs away and punches to long-off"
"massive appeal but no says the umpire. Looked a good decision. Botha hasn't spun any today. Flat on off, the batsman walks right across and misses his big slog sweep. Struck in front of off, but may have been missing off"
"a yorker on middle and leg, drilled to long-on"
"short around middle and leg, nudged to midwicket"
"the legcutter that doesn't cut, slow outside off, swatted to long-on"
"there's four. Full delivery outside off, slogged away in the gap at midwicket. Nicely hit"

"a yorker down leg, Lalor misses a flick, the ball goes through his flick, and misses leg stump"

"another short delivery on middle and leg, swatted away down to long-on, on the bounce"
"a slower delivery around off, Lalor is through his flick too early, a leading edge to cover"
"138 kph, shortish delivery on middle and leg, shovelled away down to fine leg"
"well taken by Brathwaite at fine leg. A short delivery down leg, Steketee backs away, looks to pull, but the ball climbs again on him. So much so that he can't control his pull, takes the leading edge and lobs to fine leg. Brathwaite runs in and takes a good, low catch"
"and bowled first ball. Full delivery on leg stump, Yasir Shah clears his front leg and swings. Misses. Leg stump is knocked back. The Heat are 9 for 67, and Brathwaite celebrates that scoreline with a jig"
"full and straight, a thick inside edge into the pad, one to point"
"that's a valuable hit. A low full toss on middle and leg, swatted away over midwicket for four."
"dug in, too short around off, the ball lobs over the batsman for a free run"
"and chips a catch to long-on. The Heat are 73 all out, <strong>third-lowest BBL score</strong>. And the Heat's lowest. A full delivery down leg, Lalor runs down and heaves the ball straight to the fielder."

"full delivery outside off, 90 ks, pushed into the cover region"
"quick outside off, 93 kph, punched to mid-on"
"nicely driven to long-off, very full around middle and leg, a full face of the bat"

"quicker through the air outside off, 90 kph, defended into the off side"
"another poor delivery, drifts down leg, flicked away to the deep backward square leg boundary. Too easy"

"on the pads, nudged to square leg"
"132 kph, good length outside off, punched towards cover from the crease"
"wide of short cover. McCullum messes up the collection at mid-off, running to his left. And throws himself at the ball but the ball trickles into the boundary. Symbolic of their day. A chipped drive from Denly"
"a thick outside edge towards third man for a couple more. Full on middle and leg, Hughes makes room for himself"

"138 kph, full delivery outside off, driven with his feet rooted to the crease, to mid-on's left"

"a full delivery on middle and leg, a thick inside edge into the pad as Hughes tries to flick"
"137 kph, good length on middle and leg, the ball rushes onto Hughes, who gets another inside edge, this time higher than the pad"
nicely worked away off the legs for a couple to deep backward square leg. Just a pick-up shot
"backs away does Hughes, and Lalor follows him, hits him on the body, another bruise"
"the first six of the day! Lalor goes short, down leg. Hughes picks the length early, goes from bottom to top and top-edges his pull over fine leg for six."
"a length delivery around off, dabbed away to point"
"on the bounce to deep midwicket, a flat start from Swepson, slightly short. Pulled away with nice timing"
"the googly, Denly doesn't pick the variation, full on middle and off, pushed back to the bowler"

"very slow through the air, nudged into the leg side. A good start from Swepson, nice control"
"Sixers' first wicket. Yasir strikes. Very full on middle and off, Hughes somehow falls over his stroke and misses a flick, struck right in front of middle and that isn't the hardest decision in the world. Some joy for the Heat"
"comes down right away, it's on the pads, worked to deep midwicket"
"shorter delivery outside off, punched away to cover from the crease"
"87 kph, plenty of flight on that, driven neatly past cover for a run"
"beautiful shot from Maddinson. Gets close to the pitch, and then gets underneath the length. From there, he has options, go straight, go over long-on, but he picks over mid-off, who is inside the circle. Great timing"
"the slog sweep, flat down leg, swept away on the bounce to deep backward square leg"
"flat on middle, a thick under-edge towards short fine leg"
"big hit. Floros offers a bit of flight, Maddinson accepts, shimmies down and heaves the ball way over long-on. Sensational timing again"
"wow, goes so high in the air that all 11 Heat players could have got underneath in time. McCullum at cover and the bowler are the contenders, but there is some miscommunication. Eventually, neither of them get a hand on it. McCullum watches on as Floros is sprawling 5 feet in front of him, misjudged that did Floros. A thick leading edge as Maddinson slog-swept that, went very high"
"shortish and wide, slapped to cover from the crease"
"and again, pushed through, hit to cover"
"pushed to midwicket, the line on this one is much straighter"
"full on off and middle, worked to deep square leg for a single"
"great hit, shuffles across, Yasir sees that and fires it in, flat, quick and short. Denly just picks it away, way over square leg. The timing has been rather good this evening from the Sixers batsmen"
"88 kph, flight outside off, driven to one of two short covers"
"a wide yorker outside off, plenty of flight, bunted back"
"93 kph, quick on middle and lag, jammed away to long-on. <strong>The scores are now level</strong>"
"that's the game. Just half of the maximum overs required for the Sixers to knock off the Heat's paltry target. Maddinson backs away and chips the ball over mid-off for a boundary, but they'll trot through before that"
