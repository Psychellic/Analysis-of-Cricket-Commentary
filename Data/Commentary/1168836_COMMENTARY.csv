"quicker one! Ahsan spots it and drives, but he can't beat the ring on the off side"
"<b>too short, and cut away!</b> Another quicker ball from Yasir, but this one sits up outside off and Ahsan cracks it away with quick hands"
"<b>edged, and past the diving wicketkeeper!</b> Where is the slip? Afridi finds the edge and Gauhar dives across at the chance, but it's too far away from him and there's no slip in place"
"Watson cuts, and hard, but Anderson tumbles to his left to get his body behind the ball and saves runs"
"on a length, and it's pushed to cover, but he can't thread the gap"

"<b>wrong 'un from Sandeep!</b> He's not quite read it, and is struck on the pad as his bat gets jammed behind it. The appeal wasn't too confident, but they ask for a <b>review</b>. Is it pad first? Looks like it. And the decision is reversed, Watto falls early! He's not too happy with it, possibly because they took a while to decide whether to take the review, but he's got to go."
"angling and spinning across him, and Rossouw cuts to point"
"<b>direct hit would have had him!</b> Rossouw drives to mid off and sets off, and fortunately for him the shy goes wide"

"flighted once more, and a backfoot punch brings a single to long off"
