"full-faced and confident, eased into the covers to get off the mark in a familiar fashion ... albeit he's brand-new to Tests. It's a curious juxtaposition!"

"head over the ball, stretching onto the front foot to defend"
"<strong>edged, and gone!</strong> Murtagh makes it happen! Nipping half-a-bat's width down the slope, snicking the edge, and scooped up by Stirling at first slip, more in his wrists than his palms, so low to the ground, but Roy isn't disputing it! First blood to Ireland!"

"speared into the blockhole, squelched to cover"
"sweet timing from Denly, who is making it count when the ball is in his slot. On the toes, flipped down the hill and through wide long-on"

"inswinger, well watched this time, turned off the face of the bat to deep midwicket"
"<B>full, straight, gone!</B> Denly departs as well, and Engand's top-order woes are officially still woeful! Adair finds a fractionally fuller length, lovely shape back into the pads on a tight line, and he doesn't bother with the review. Well, well! This is working out nicely for the new boys!"

a run! Worked off the pads...! Curran to the rescue again
"nicked off, <b>FIVE for Murtagh!</b> Perfect line and that's too good for Moeen, who feathers through to Wilson, and green tide surges again! That's Murtagh's 14th first-class five-for at Lord's - but the first to get him on the honours board!

"length ball, whipped cleanly off the pads up the hill towards the Grand Stand"

Looked pretty good on first sight and it was clipping a good chunk of leg stump. That's the way to do it, for Broad, take the fielders out of the equation"
"skidding on, targeting the stumps again, KOB jabs down on it in time"
"shaping away in the corridor outside off, left alone"
"length ball, holding its line around fourth stump, Balbirnie watches it closely and leaves"
"dug in short, climbing above the crouching O'Brien"
"dug in, 87mph over the top of, KOB jumps back and works it down to the leg side"
"another bumper, 89mph and climbing through swiftly as O'Brien drops to his knees"
"short and rising outside off as KOB rides the bounce and dabs in front of point, they scamper the one"
back of a length and seaming away as Balbirnie stays put and shoulders arms
"holding its line in the channel outside off, left alone"
"probing line outside off, full and then nibbbling away from the right-hander, O'Brien happy to watch those through for now"
"length, stays a tad low as he hops into position, blocked"
"length ball outside off, 82mph and defended softly on the back foot"
"fuller, KOB is forward this time, triangulates accurately and shows it a meaty front-foot defensive"
"lovely timing, touch full and wide from Broad, <b>rifled through the covers by big KOB!</b> Delicately played, but it races for four"
pitched up and blocked into the off side
"howsaboutthat! <b>Middle stump out of the ground!</b> Peach of a nut from Stone, and he has his first Test wicket... Balbirnie knows he couldn't do much about that, but he's loathe to drag himself away. Full and then swinging late past the whip to leg, smack into middle pole!"
"dug in, <b>some snorty short stuff to greet the new batsman!</b> Wilson leaps and throws up his hands, manages to keep it down"
"full, finds the edge, <b>zips to second slip on the bounce!</b> Wilson already getting worked over here"
fired down the leg side
"gottim, <b>fended to slip!</b> Stone roars again, gets his second of the over with an 89mph delivery back of a length, Wilson drawn into feeling for it when he could probably leave, and a fast edge is this time held by Root at first slip! Done by the angle as Stone went wide on the crease"
"full and fast, thuds the front pad and the cordon go up in unison... but Stone's reaction told you that had pitched outside leg. Quite the over, though, double-wicket maiden!"
"full length, met crisply on the front foot with a punch to cover"
"fullish outside off, KOB pushes this towards extra cover"
"slides a little straight, worked for a single to fine leg"
"round the wicket to the left-hander, hits a length and gets it to straighten a touch, Thompson leaves"
fullish around off and blocked on the front foot
"ooh, that's nipped through, past the inside edge with Thompson crease-bound"
"hurled full on the stumps, 90mph but KOB plays it well going back and flicking through midwicket for a couple"
"pitched up, gets O'Brien a little squared up and a leading edge runs back down the pitch"
"banged in, 87mph and a touch leg side, ducks out of the way"
"woof, another beauty, <b>draws him out and then whistles through past the edge</b>, O'Brien <i>this</i> close to being kippered"
"fired in straight at 88mph, blocked to the leg side"
"fuller, around off stump, KOB shows it a straight bat"
"oh dear, that's a bad leave... <b>Broad hits off stump and points to the skies!</b> Angled in from round the wicket and he's misjudged it. Thompson, the man who kept Pakistan at bay alongside KOB at Malahide last year, departs for a duck, and suddenly England have hopes of running through Ireland tonight"
"full around off, Adair is forward and pushes into the covers"
"length ball, this goes a l-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-n-g way as Adair pushes at it from the crease"
"pitched up, tighter to off stump and he chops down on this in defence"

"banged in short, 86mph, steepling bouncer over the crouching O'Brien"
"short of a length, KOB rides it and steers in front of point"
"good length outside off, O'Brien plays forward and gets an inside edge to the leg side"
angled across and defended around off stump
"whippy arm, 79mph and shaping away as KOB steps out and holds his bat inside the line"
"oh no, Adair is sent back having come a long way down... <b>but the throw at the non-striker's end misses!</b> Defended on to his body and KOB said 'No!' fairly quickly"
"short of a length, again he hangs back and gets an inside edge towards his pads... this has got trapped in the knee roll, I think. He quickly genuflects, so no one gets the cheeky idea of running over and trying to take it out and claim a catch"
"length on off, opens the face a touch and steers behind square for one"
"full and swinging, attempted yorker but not quite the genuine Waqar, blocked back towards mid-off"
"length ball, 82mph and sliding towards middle and leg, worked behind square"
"fired in straight, rising to hit the thigh pad as KOB works across the line"
touch short and O'Brien again plays it down between his legs from the crease
"short of a length, 82mph and steered towards gully, they will take on the arm... and Adair is home safely"
"slips in a full, straight delivery, Adair blocks to the on side"
back of a length on the stumps and clipped down to fine leg
"<b>Chops on!</b> Back-of-a-length ball shaping away from the right-hander, looks to send it out towards midwicket and only manages a bottom edge which sends the stumps clattering. Will we see England batting again before close?"
plays inside the line of a ball outside off stump
"shaping away from the left-hander, dangles the bat but doesn't connect"
crab-like defence into the leg side - not a particularly convincing start from McBrine
"length ball, and runs it out towards point with an open face"
"82.9mph, strays down the leg side this time and a decent take by Bairstow"
"strays down leg, <strong>big appeal</strong> from Bairstow, and from Root at first slip, but Woakes isn't so keen on it. Trying to work to leg, looks like it brushed the pad on the way through"
"down leg again, nothing on it this time"
"open stance from KOB, but ducks underneath a short ball"
"outswinger, big bounce off the pitch, and plays and misses"
"tucks into the leg side, McBrine wants two but it's never there. <strong>150 up!</strong>"
"yorker, clipped off the pads down to long leg"
"full on off stump, blocked back down the pitch... wild throw from Curran towards the striker's end that Bairstow doesn't gather and spills away for one! Sloppy from England"
worked out to long leg off the hip
moves in off the surface and defended out towards mid-on
driven sheepishly out to the cover fielder
"aims a bunt through the covers, but doesn't get any bat on it"
defends the length ball out to mid-off on the front foot
"strays too straight, looks to flick down to long leg"
"82.6mph, beauty shaping across the left-hander, who is <strong>beaten</strong>"
"angled across the left-hander again, looks for a booming drive but no connection"
"angled in this time, and blocked back with a full face"
"looks to run a length ball through point, finds the outside edge and flies down to third man"
"strays down leg, shoulders arms but hits him on the thigh pad on the way through"
"full outside off, skews out towards backward point"

"hooping delivery, wide outside the off stump. Left alone"
"open stance again, whips this out to square leg on the half-volley"
"length ball, defended on the front foot"
"short ball, tries to swat it away over square leg, comes off the glove - or even the back of the bat! - and Bairstow, wrong-footed, can't get near it"
"strays way down the leg side this time, poor ball, speed down at 78.2mph"
blocked into his pads
"very wide on the crease from around the wicket, blocked out to cover"
"dropped down to point, and they steal a quick single"
"pushed out into the covers, McBrine looking ever so slightly more assured after a tentative start"
"length ball, runs his fingers over it, looks to swat it through the leg side, but hits him on the thigh pad and swirls away into the off side"
"80.3mph bumper from Curran. Not particularly threatening, McBrine ducks way underneath it, and given wide"
"inswinger, strangled appeal from Curran, but too short and would have been going over"
"seams away off a length, almost gets a faint edge on it but a Bairstow clanger behind the stumps removes any vague danger"
"thick edge on the drive, and <strong>flies away down to wide third man</strong>. In the air, but nobody in the vicinity"
"bumper, <strong>pulled away unconvincingly</strong> down towards Curran at long leg but a way short of him and to his right. Collects on the bounce"
"widish, and left alone outside off"
"back of a length, angling in, and pushed out towards square leg for a quick single"
"bumper, strays to the leg side though, and KOB happily ducks underneath it"
"half-volley length, driven gently out to cover"
"tossed up on leg stump, bunted out to midwicket"
"pushed into the leg side, away from the grasp of short leg"
"fired in outside off, on with the arm, tries to force the issue through the covers but only a bottom edge"
"minimal turn, McBrine looks to whack through the off side but doesn't time it"
"full and straight, smothers it before it has a chance to spin"
"oooh, bumper and it <b>hits KOB</b> in the side. Short, sharp, tried to fend it away, flicks off the glove <em>into his ribs</em>. Physio on for O'Brien, but I think he'll be alright with a couple of painkillers and a swig of water."
"banged in again, some follow-up chin music but it's leg side and O'Brien dances across out of the way"
short of a length and glanced behind square
"snuck through, <b>Broad disturbs the leg bail!</b> Just enough of a gap between bat and pad as he seamed one back, clipped the edge and then shivered leg stump - KOB running out of partners now"
"ooh err, backs away and has a hack, comes off the toe and nearly squirts away through the slips!"
"over the stumps this time! Again Murtagh shuffling outside leg and wafting aimlessly, gets away with it"
"short and leg side, clips him on the derriere and runs fine for a couple"
comes across and lets this one go
overpitched and stroked through the covers for a couple more
"dug in short, KOB jumps across and defends down towards his toes"
"full, 85mph and wobbling in the channel as O'Brien swings at it and misses"
"banged in, climbing through as O'Brien ducks - that'll keep Murtagh on strike for Broad"
"short ball, Murtagh limbos under it... <b>and then hoicks four through midwicket</b>, playing the shot while practically horizontal! Broad's <i>delighted</i> with that"
"back of a length, swiped into the ground, off balance like a deckhand in a storm"
"oh, nearly bowls him! Fuller, 87mph and shaping away as Murtagh swings and misses with his stumps exposed"
"length ball on the stumps, Murtagh connects with a heave through midwicket - <b>that'll take the Ireland lead up above 100!</b> Plenty of cheers around the ground from the supporters in green"
"smashed for four more! <b>Another agricultural hack to cow corner</b>, Murtagh doing just as he pleases in St John's Wood today"
"Broad does attempt to hit the stumps now, but Murtagh swats it away on the the back foot"
"pitched up and steered through backward point, they take the single"
"<b>Murtagh's day out continues!</b> Heaved over mid-off, a clean smoke down the ground for four more!"
"bounces him out, Murtagh falling over again and <b>lummoxed to deep midwicket!</b> Stone scratches the itch for England, though not before Murtagh has caused further irritation... A jaunty 16 from 10, which is more runs with the bat than he conceded with the ball"
"dug in short, 84mph and looping over O'Brien as he rolls a shoulder out of the way"
"length ball delivered from wide of the crease, curling past the bat as KOB aims a leaden swipe"
"short ball, at the body and O'Brien pulls... this has looped back down the pitch for Stone to take a diving catch, but Dar isn't convinced. England <b>review</b> but that clearly came off the bicep, no bat involved so KOB carries on"
"full and wide of the stumps, left alone"
"full length, Rankin reaches out tentatively and pings a couple through cover"
"digs this one in short, veering leg side as Rankin ducks"
"length ball, clipped off the stumps down to fine leg"
"length ball whipped away through midwicket, just one to deep midwicket"
"bit of width, Rankin dabbles in the channel and thick-edges four through gully, <b>bringing up the Ireland 200!</b> Plenty of well-lubricated cheers around Lord's for that landmark"
"length on middle and off, half an appeal from the bowler, continued by the slips... but Stone had spotted the inside edge"
"fuller outside off, O'Brien is well back and taps it away"
"banged in short once more, KOB gets into line and prods it down to the on side"
"speared in from wide on the crease, heading leg side and Bairstow has to dive across to his left"
"bumper, 87mph and he does well to jab it down, bouncing in front of short leg"
"slung down short and this misses everything! A swipe from O'Brien, a leap from Bairstow and four byes the result"
"round the wicket, tossed up and tapped away"
"Boyd swings, Boyd misses, Moeen hits! <b>Rattles into leg stump</b>, and that will be that for the Ireland innings! And it means England will have to face one over this evening, too"
"ghosts one past the outside edge straight away! He's got this on a reel, draws Leach out and then beats his ginger prod"
"full length, 74mph and a touch wide, Leach can play inside this comfortably"
"touch short and leg side, hits him on the thigh guard as he works to leg"
"tempting line, Leach takes a step across and then continues to follow the ball, just nibbling away into the keeper's gloves"
"fullish around off stump, met with a solid Gandalf-facing-down-the-Balrog block into the covers"
"pitched up on middle and leg, Leach gets in behind it and taps back down the pitch - and that will be <b>stumps</b> after a 20-wicket day at Lord's"
"round the wicket, and nip and bounce from the outset. Back of a length, climbs off the seam at chest-height to the keeper"
"fired down the leg side, a touch offline, but good pace and carry once more"
tapped to the leg side
"standing tall in defence, pressed to the leg side as Adair hits the deck hard once more"
"a touch of nip off the seam once more, from back of a length as Burns doesn't quite play outside off stump"
"tucked off the hips to backward square, England are off the mark for the innings"
solidly into line as Murtagh finds his habitual length outside off
leaning forward to defend into the off side
"<B>beaten!</B> Pitching outside leg, shaping across the left-hander, and keeping low past the outside edge"
"played late and low, under the nose as Murtagh attacks the top of off"
"slow and steady, dobbed onto that perfect off-stump line and length, and defended again"
"a fraction of width, and Leach flops into a toe-ended cut-cum-drive, low through the cordon, using the pace of the ball to do the rest"
"back-foot biff into the covers, Adair just testing the middle of the pitch a touch more than the fuller length"
"that was fuller, but also way wide of leg stump. Wilson does well to intercept with a deflected dive"
"sliding past the pads again, Adair is focussing on restricting the left-hander's width, and bringing the slips into play, but he's over-egging it"
<i>that's </I>a better ball! Outside off this time and really climbing off the seam to beat the outside edge
"good again, angling in from a fourth-stump line and through to the keeper past the outside edge"
"cautiously stabbed to the right of point, pressing forward with intent to meet the fuller length"
"angled defence, on the front foot, back down the pitch"
flicked firmly off the hip and well fielded with a sprawling stop at midwicket. Cuts off the second run at least
"<B>beauty</B>. A laser-guided bouncing bomb of a delivery, just zeroing in on a perfect line and length, and doing nothing more tricksy than bouncing straight through to the keeper"
"<B>buzzers!</B> tucked to square leg, the shy comes in, hits the stumps, and skims to the boundary! The batsmen definitely crossed this time though ..."
defended back down the wicket
"probing on and around off stump, met with a solid full face of the bat"
"round the wicket, very full length, through to the keeper past a tentative prod"
left alone on a wider line
"attacking the stumps on a full length, firm block back down the line of the ball"
"banged in short, through to the keeper"
"beaten, as Adair strings together a good succession of off-stump probers. Leach flirts as this one as it goes by"
"rising into the thigh pad, flicked to the leg side"
keeps low as it hits the seam and zips away from Burns' upraised bat
"full face of the bat in defence, back down the line of the ball"
"on the back foot, fenced to midwicket, looking for the single but can't find the gap"
leaning out of the crease to nurdle to the leg side
"pressing onto the front foot, not quite middled as an inside-edge cannons off the front pad and away to the off side"
dabbed to the off side
"stretching forward, firm contact on a checked drive, into the covers"
"well bowled, hooping inswing on a very full length from round the wicket, pushed to cover and Leach bolts off for the single but is wisely sent back"
hooping outswinger now! Suddenly the ball is talking ... a wild flash at nothing as Wilson gathers
"this one holds its line outside off, as Leach keeps his bat inside the line"
"fired into the pads, clipped to square leg as Leach misses out"
"over the wicket at last from Adair, and curls this one in towards the front pad, worked with a swish across the line to the leg side"
"<B>well bowled!</B> A peach of an inswinging yorker, and Leach does pretty well to jam his bat down late and dig it past his leg stump! Adair is making things happen intermittently this morning"
"on the pads, clipped sweetly through the gap at square leg, easy pickings"
"banged in short, a bit of a surprise for Leach, but at 73mph, he's not the type of bowler to demand a short leg. Still, that lobbed defensive flail would have been swallowed!"
"<strong>lovely bowling again! </strong>Curling past the outside edge on a perfect length, and the cordon briefly thinks there must be a nick ... not this time..."
"back of a length, cut with intent but no timing (or footwork) to point"
defended into the off side
"solid areas once more from Murtagh, full and probing"
"hits the seam again, jags away from the left-hander"
line and length once more
"firm in defence, presenting a full face to the ball angling in"
"blocked under the eyeline, feet rooted in the crease"
"just a hint of outswing on a good length, but Burns is watchful once more"
suckered by the outswinger! Burns has been disciplined but this one lures his hard hands into a drive as Adair switches to over the wicket. Well bowled
"banged in short, funnily enough, Leach ducks, funnily enough"
"short again, but Leach rides the bounce and chops a cramped cut through backward point. Impressive"
"outside off, cut firmly to point, but no timing in this one"
"fuller length, and <strong>Burns nicks off to the keeper!</strong> That's a big wicket, you sense that Leach was the man in Rankin's sights, but having teed up his partner with the short balls, Burns' own weight seems to be on the back foot as he leaned uneasily out of the crease, hands well away from the body... Ireland have their opening!"
"shortish and down the leg side, Roy wafts at it as he moves across his stumps"
"<b>half a shout for lbw</b>, but that looked high! Trapped on the crease by one nipping back in, spun around but - crucially - not shown the door"
"<b>pinged down the ground</b>, textbook off-drive! Too full, right up under his nose, rammed down the ground"
prods this into the covers coming across
"does him again, overpitched and Leach just waits for it and times a drive past mid-off for three more!"
"gets it away, though not quite where he was aiming...! <b>Full-blooded cover drive</b>, but he ends up dragging it to long-off. Shrug of the shoulders from Roy, he'll take 'em"
"full, 81mph and swinging a touch, Roy throws the hands again but mistimes this back to the bowler"
"vintage Roy,<b> lasered through the covers! </b>Too full, right in the slot and when it doesn't swing, you <i>know</i> he's going to do that to you"
"more runs, another Leach dinky-drive down the ground, times it well enough to beat the chasing fielder"
"hold the pose! <b>Drilled through the covers</b>, he takes a couple of steps down but no need to run - Leach playing a peach of an innings here (Test best for him, too)"
"short of a length, gets him back in the crease defending"
"back of a length, glanced off the hip, <b>he's whipped this away for four more!</b> All wrists to the square leg boundary, Rankin leaking runs now"
dug in but wide of the stumps and left alone
"length ball, coming in on off stump, Leach dabs it down into the covers and punches the strike. He's bouncing out there!"
"on the stumps, worked towards square leg"
"pitched up, floaty ball on the pads and he flicks it uppishly away, past midwicket for a couple more"
"full, slightly wide and he watches it through"
"length ball swerving across the bows at 72mph, Leach starts to follow it but manages to contain himself"
"slightly short and Leach chucks the hands through a cut, finds backward point"
"classic tempter in the channel, draws him across and nearly into a fatal flirt. But Leach survives again"
Roy comes across and taps this down
"<b>edged through the slips!</b> Roy walking down and trying to rasp through midwicket, flies off the bat through third - recently vacated, of course - though would have been a fast, low chance, I think"
short and at the body and he plays across the line again
"angling in from round the wicket, struck on the thigh pad playing back"
"cuts him in half, <b>did too much</b> - went over the stumps, in fact! Leach hanging back and beaten trying to get the bat down in time"
"speared down the leg side, flick and a miss"
"sidles in and hits a length, Roy pats it down"
"wobbles past the bat, Roy propelling himself down the pitch... <b>and Gary Wilson then underarms into the stumps from distance!</b> Roy had got his bat in, but that would have been a hugely Roy way to go, stumped by a keeper standing back"
gets forward and blocks this into the covers
good length and nibbling through to the keeper as Roy looks to get bat on ball again
"length on the stumps, straighter line and flicked to square leg"
"driven on the up, gets it between two men in the covers, <b>pumped to the boundary for four more!</b> Roy isn't going to die wondering today"
"slightly overpitched and Leach drives, comes off the toe of the bat for a couple through the covers"
"length, rising to hit the middle of the bat as Leach draws himself up in defence"
"short and veering down the leg side at 78mph, giving Wilson a bit to do behind the timbers"
"better line, beats Leach's forward prod - but still missing that vital tickle"
"shorter, 79mph and climbing through outside off, Leach drags his bat inside the line"
fired down the leg side again as Leach mooches across
"touch short, Roy is moving down early again, punched through midwicket for one"
"length in the channel, 74mph and chopped to backward point"
"floats up a tempter outside off, Leach sniffs at it and demurs"
"fullish around off, blocked coming forwards"
slides on to the pads and Leach whips this away behind square for one more
"good length around off stump, Roy shows it a diligent straight bat in defence"
"thuds into the pads, but that pitched outside leg"
"bowling over the wicket to the lefty now, angled across and tapped down from the crease"
short and prancing through to the keeper as Leach draws his bat inside the line
dug in and this time Leach is up on his tippy-toes to block
"length in the channel, 80mph and leaving the batsman, no need to play at it"
"back of a length around off stump, pushed into the covers"
comes across on off stump and taps it down
"full on off, Roy seizes on the chance to crash the cymbals again... but his timing is not quite there again, and Murtagh sticks out a boot to stop it in his follow through"
"good length, keeping him honest around off stump, defended"
"72mph wobbler, clipped through the leg side for a couple"
pitched up and met with a stout front-foot punch to cover

"outside off, through to the keeper with no stroke offered"
"thumped back down the track, half stopped in the followthrough. Thompson aiming full and fuller"
"banged in short, defended under the nose"
"<B>solid clonking down the ground!</B> In the slot, punched firmly through long-off with an arrow-straight bat"
"short, wide, thumped fiercely through point where KOB does well to intercept one hand, and the grace of a wardrobe falling down the stairs"
"<B>Roy's gone boshty!</B> Three quick steps to the pitch, and a lashing larrup of an uppercut slog, high over wide long-on!"
"better length, very full, and solidly blocked"
"back of a length, Roy unfurls another cultured back-cut through point, for KOB to gather again"
"head over the ball, 50mph and dipping on the crease to be blocked"
"back of a length, turning to the leg side, McBrine not being given a chance to settle, and therein lies the benefit of Roy's one-day background. He's played these middle overs for fun in recent weeks..."
"oops, genuinely beaten there as Thompson finds extra nip outside off"
"cautiously forward, meeting the off-stump line with a determined stab of the bat"
"<B>edged, wide of second slip!</B> Leach is utterly pumped as he brings up his<strong> maiden Test half-century</strong>, and exceeds England's first-innings total in the process!"
"banged in short, very wide, Leach has a slash but can't connect"

"shuffling to the pitch once more, clipping a measured shot to midwicket for the single"
"tossed up from round the wicket, stretching onto the front foot, and pushed back down the ground"

"head over the ball, and blocked"
thumps the pad but sliding down
"B>crashes into the pad!</B> Wow, that was so close ... it was leg-sided, but hit so flush on the knee-roll... and the umpire clearly thought long and hard... and Ireland run out of time for the review. Just as well, as it was <B>missing</B>"
inside-edged drive to the leg side
"driven, not quite to the pitch once more, out to square leg"
swinging into the legs
"smashed hard over the covers, and <B>skimming over the fielder's fingertips!</B> That was one-day Roy in full flow, utterly smoked, and hang the consequences. Would have been a blinder to reach that!"
"fired into the pads, whipped behind square"
"<B>top-edged sweep, and high over backward square's head!</B> Not quite as Roy intended, but very much as he intended in outcome..."
pressed to cover off the front foot

"prodding onto the front foot, full face of the bat"
opens the face on impact to steer another front-foot prod to point

"solid in defence, blocked back down the pitch"
"swinging away on a full length, left alone"
"big hooping outswing but from back of a length, Leach can watch it go harmlessly by"
"big outswing, through to the keeper. Setting him up for the inswinging yorker?"
"nope, he's come round the wicket now, back of a length, changing the angle into the left-hander"
"wide line from round the wicket, passes the edge as Leach half-leaves"
"curling in from outside off, there is that inswinger, but Leach was alert to it. The nightwatchman becomes the lunchwatchman!"

"length ball, defends with the full face to ensure his bat sponsor gets plenty of air time"
"fuller, on middle-and-off, and Roy whips this through midwicket for four! A bit of a flourish in the shot, à la MS Dhoni. <b>Hundred partnership!</b>"

blocked away into the off side
flicked away off the hip for a single

"just back of a length, looks to work to leg but an outside edge drops into nomansland"
"full and straight, <b>big inswinger</b> and a loud appeal... but looks like it was sliding down. Roy was trying to whip this out to wide mid-on, and didn't pick the inswinger, but that was comfortably missing leg stump"
"length ball, presents the full face and fielded by Adair in his follow through"
"round the wicket, strays down leg and tickled round the corner... off the pad in fact, given leg byes"

"wayward again, strays down leg from around the wicket"

flicked off the pads down to long leg
defended out to gully off the back foot
"punched out to cover, no timing"
"<b>dropped!</b> That looked like the end of Leach's fun, as he prodded at a short-pitched ball. Edged off the shoulder to Wilson - who hasn't had a bad Test behind the stumps - and he spills a sitter. A life!"

"back of a length outside off, opens the face and <strong>runs it down to the vacant third man boundary</strong>. A touch of Kane Williamson about this, classy shot"

length ball sliding leg side and Roy rolls out the bus-driver wheelhouse whip to fine leg for a couple
"good ball in response, nipping off a length as Roy tries to adjust late and is beaten outside off"
"bowled 'im, <b>cleaned up through the gate!</b> Roy won't be getting a debut hundred, but he's changed the tone of this match... Seemed to get a little tight over the last few overs, Thompson pitched it up and got some nip back in, beating an expansive drive. You live by the sword, etc and so on"

short of a length and tucked off the hip behind square - keeps him on strike
"<b>dropped!</b> Adair can't hold on at second slip! There's going to be no chiselling out Leach here, is there...? Drawn forward by Murtagh, who finds the edge but it went quickly to Adair's left and they are standing so close, it was down before you could blink"

"on the stumps, turned towards midwicket"
"[Darth Vader voice] Noooooooooooo!!! <b>Nicked to slip and Adair holds this one!</b> Leach won't be getting on the honours board after all, but what a knock he has contributed. Murtagh the man to get him, as many would have predicted this morning - just with far fewer to his name!

back and across to defend on the back foot
"flicked to square leg, and <B>that's an appalling mix-up!</B> Oh my word, Root was two-thirds down the pitch when he sent Denly back. There was no hope whatsoever of him even being in the frame as McBrine whipped the bails off, and suddenly England are keenly aware that a 122-run deficit is no small thing!"

<B>pops into the gloves but short of short leg!</B> Moeen surprised by the extra bounce from just back of a length Gloved into the ribs and down into the pitch
"<B>fenced off the hip and just wide of short leg again!</B> Two scares in as many balls... but Moeen has survived through to tea! Good aggression from Rankin, he will doubtless be called upon again to target Moeen on the short ball."

"got him, <b>feathers a bumper through to Wilson!</b> Moeen walks, a clear deflection off the edge via a flaccid back-foot prod - and Ireland win another big moment in this Test! They'd just taken a slip out, Moeen seemingly knew a short ball was coming, but was powerless to do anything about it"
"another short ball, over the crouching Woakes"
"back of a length on the stumps, defended to the on side"
"<b>is that a drop?</b> Is that the game (steady on)...? Root steers a fat edge towards first slip but <b>Stirling didn't get his hands down</b>, it dipped on him and he was much further back than Balbirnie... Perhaps partially unsighted by the keeper? He was late on it and the chance slipped away"

pitched up and tapped into the off side
"Root comes down, drives on the up - <b>BRILLIANT TAKE FROM WILSON!</b> Big outside edge and it was heading for slip but Wilson threw himself across and took charge of it himself! That's a massive wicket, Root ripped out, Adair nipping the ball up the slope to find the edge; Ireland grab history by the lapels and shove it up against the lockers once again!"

"stays round the wicket, back of a length and jabbed away to leg"
"shortish, 79mph rising outside off as Broad jumps into line and pokes square"

"slogged down the ground, <b>nine iron rather than driver</b> - but it'll bounce away to long-off regardless!"
"over the wicket, 79mph short ball, blocked on the back foot"
"slapped up into the air, can mid-off get back...? <b>No, despite another magnificent effort from Porterfield!</b> Scrambling, straining, stretching for the catch as it just dropped out of reach of Ireland's captain. Criminy!"

"banged in short, Curran hangs back and lets it fly through"
"another bumper, Curran splices a pull - <b>and this is taken in the deep!</b> Coolly taken by McCollum, a few yards in from the rope at deep square leg. Thompson stands with his arms aloft, Ireland are almost there... Curran lived fast and perishes accordingly, but that turbo-charged 37 might just make things interesting"
floated up and paddled on the full for a couple past short fine leg
"darted in on the stumps, Broad sweeps and misses... Palliyaguruge turns down the appeal but Ireland chance a <b>review</b>, knowing they might as well use one up. But there was a scrap of glove on it, detected by UltraEdge, so no dice, much to the delight of the crowd"

"length delivery wide of the stumps, Stone watches it through"
"<B>full and straight, and out goes the leg peg!</B> Wow! That's the way to set the agenda for Ireland! Perfect length, big inswing, through the gate, and well, It Is On!

"<B>driven with intent!</B> Too full from Woakes, wide enough to have a real go, and battered fiercely through the covers. A despairing dive from Denly to no avail... but <B>actually he's done brilliantly</B>. Fingertipped it back with an inch to spare!"
"whoops, a wild hack across the line as Woakes slids one through low"
"right up to the pads, thwacked behind square. A decent over for Ireland, they are up and running"
"<B>lovely from Broad</B>. Just back of a length, jagging and bouncing as Porterfield just about avoids playing at it. Half a yard fuller and that take the edge"
"<B>that's taken something!</B> The ball nips back into the hip, beats the edge, <B>flies to second slip!</B> The crowd cheer, but the players knew straightaway"
"wayward from Broad, way down the leg side, Bairstow fumbles as he tumbles"

"outside off, keeping low as Porterfield leaves alone"
"back of a length, tight to off stump, pushed into the covers"
"<B>edged and that's outstanding from Bairstow!</B> His best moment of the match by a distance, a perfect delivery in the channel, drawing the snick and YJB committed to the dive in front of first slip, scooping it up in his left hand then tumbling to the turf! England are up and running!"
"full and straight, Broad looks happier bowling to the right-hander, just plugging away on a nagging length with good nip off the seam"
"<B>big jag back into the pads!</B> Extra nip would have taken it over the stumps, but that's uncomfortably squeezed down into the crease"
"back of a length, thumping the deck, pressed into the off side with caution"
through to the keeper on a wider line
"probing from Broad, rising on a fourth-stump line and no stroke offered"
"<B>huge appeal from Broad!</B> Fuller length this time, squeezes the back pad on a very tight line. Missed the inside edge, but was probably slipping over. England decline the review"
"<B>super shot!</B> Not especially over-pitched from Woakes, but Balbirnie's exploratory push back down the pitch is timed to perfection! Coasts to the rope with the certainty of Usain Bolt in the final ten metres of the Olympics"
"left alone, climbing off the deck"

"pushed back into the crease from back of a length, squared up as the ball keeps low. 87mph, which is brisk for Broad"

"aggressive length again, inside-edged drive to square leg"
"short, ducked"
"<B>edged, and plops into Root's hands at first slip!</B> You just knew that Broad was coming... tightened his line, snagged the edge, a looping chance was dying as it reached the cordon, but the skipper watched it well into both hands... Now then!"
"tightens the line, flinched to the leg side to move McCollum into double figures"
"<B>that's taken off!</B> Fractionally back of a length, so looked more dramatic than it was. But big jag and lift off the seam, with late swing as well."
"<B>clean through him!</B> And it was the last ball that won that one! The huge movement drew Stirling into covering the wrong line, as Woakes this time aimed fuller and straighter, nipped it back through the gate, and Ireland are suddenly in deep trouble..."
"full and straight, watchfully blocked..."
"leaning forward once more, concentration etched on his features"
"<strong>edged, but inches short of first slip!</strong> There's the Murtagh ball again, hitting the top of off if you don't put bat on ball, but hitting the seam to scramble your alignment. A low edge, just too low!"
"<B>snorter outside off!</B> Holding its line and nipping late, to beat the edge as McCollum hopped across his crease"
"back of a length, fenced to the leg side, a sharp single to relieve the pressure"
"edged, low through third man, good areas ... but finds the vital gap"
"banged in short, and <B>KOB ducks into it!</B> We'll have a break for a concussion test, even though O'Brien's skull is clearly made of concrete. Hit him on the back of the helmet as he turned his head, and pinged away to the leg side"
"follows up with another short ball, seaming away outside off stump as KOB gets well down in his bunker"
"pushed through leg side, O'Brien flicks at it and Broad goes up for caught behind... don't think anyone else was convinced"
"lovely outswinger and<b> McCollum nicks to slip!</b> Woakes has three and Ireland are sinking fast here... another challenging delivery in the channel, immaculate seam position and McCollum is drawn into a fateful jab. Woakes finding his 2016 groove on this ground"
"probing line, straightens through past the outside edge with Wilson groping on the back foot"
"another seaming ball, strikes the back pad as Wilson plays the wrong line - not given by umpire Palliyaguruge but England <b>review</b>, and this could be close; looked to right on the line of off stump, but was it <i>in</i> line? Yes, says Hawk-Eye! <b>The finger goes up second time around and Wilson walks off for a pair!</b> Woakes has this on a string, in helpful conditions - the puppet-master making Ireland dance!"
"shaping in around off stump, lines it up in defence"
"good length, swerving away late and heading off towards first slip as Thompson lets it go"
"pitched up, looking for the yorker around off stump, blocked"
"another gone, <b>pinned on the crease!</b> Broad barely even looks around, but Aleem Dar wasn't going to take long to think about this one... Jagging back fiendishly down the slope, KOB nowhere near keeping it out! Lord's is actually stunned into silence right now. Ireland's dream is being diminished (© Ian Bishop) by the minute"
short of a length and tucked off the hip leg side
good length around off stump and blocked
"length ball, shaping in as Adair comes across and shows it a straight bat"
"short, at the body and hoicked away through backward square leg, there's a man back and they take one"
"round the wicket, shortish and seaming, climbing through at 82mph as Thompson prods at it uncertainly"
"length ball around the line of off, Adair covers it"
"curling away in the channel, <b>that's unplayable</b>... Adair misses it by almost a bat's width as he feels for it on off stump"
"nipping away again, slightly wide and he can let it go"
"another beauty, pitched up and swerving through to the keeper as Adair plants the front foot and tries to hit down the ground"
"straighter line, length ball on the stumps and tapped down"
"touch shorter, 82mph and jabbed off the body for one through midwicket"
comes across on off and taps down defensively
"short and Adair attempts to pull from outside off stump, doesn't get hold of it"
"dug in, Adair swings blindly - <b>struck on the helmet grille!</b> That didn't look comfortable, a short-arm jab but the ball hit him around the collar bone. Tough out there for batting. He'll get a visit from the physio, too"
"bouncer to follow up, <b>and Adair humps it all the way over midwicket!</b> That takes Ireland past the lowest score in Tests, at least"
"rewenge for Broad! <b>Off stump splattered!</b> Pitched up and arrowing through the gap as Adair attempts to hit his way out of trouble. Broad purses his lips, that's his third and England are now three away"
"round the wicket, pitched up and left well alone"
"full on off, Thompson brings the bat down like a blacksmith striking his anvil and pings four to long-off"
"full and a touch wider, the bat turns in the hands as he drives and Woakes fields to his right"
"pitched up, thrashed towards extra cover where Broad dives to cut it off"
"digs this in short, 'Get back in your box...' Thompson ducks  it"
"and now the sucker ball to follow up - <b>steered tamely to first slip!</b> Woakes has five, he's on the honours board (again) and Ireland are beginning to pack their bags. Thompson's brief sally ends flashing at a wide one, having been pushed back by the bouncer"
"backs away to one full and wide, almighty swing but he wasn't in the same postcode"
"too easy! <b>Root bags another at first slip!</b> Broad has a fourth, McBrine hoodwinked by another curling outswinger from round the wicket"
"goes for the stumps as Rankin hops away and swings, <b>zips through past leg!</b> Beats everything, Broad left smiling ruefully and shaking his head"
"fourth stump, touch short as Rankin heaves at it and misses"
"back of a length over the top of off, again Rankin tries to belt it into next week and misses"
"swerving down the leg side, lost his radar on that one"
"pitched up, the crowd hoping for a glorious climax... but Rankin digs it out. No five-for for Broad (yet)"
"hoicked over cover point, in the air... <b>but it lands safely!</b>"
"angled across in the channel, Murtagh has a filthy hack and misses"
"short ball, head height on leg stump and Murtagh ducks it"
"<b>plucks out leg stump to finish it!</b> Tonks the timber one last time, six-for for Woakes and Ireland have been <i>demolished</i> in barely 90 minutes of cricket. Murtagh was of course looking to Happy Gilmore it into the Mound Stand, but it was Woakes who connected"
