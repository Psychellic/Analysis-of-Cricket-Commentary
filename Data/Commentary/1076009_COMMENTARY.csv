Good length and holds its line outside off, from around the stumps, Malan attempts a back-foot force and this time he isn't lucky. Drags a thick inside edge back onto the stumps"

"short on off, hits the splice of the bat, the ball rolls to mid-on"

"stumping chance sent upstairs. Tossed up and drifts away outside off, drags Nawaz forward and goes past the outside edge. Kamran collects the ball and takes the bails off. Nawaz loses his balance and lifts his back leg. Seems like the foot is on the line by the time the bails come off. Tough one for Raza, the TV umpire. Out is the verdict. Two wickets in two balls, Peshawar are closing in on the title"

It was Hasan who set it up with the new ball and sealed it with the old one. This was full and right on the off stump. Babar looks to slug it away across the line. He only connects with a whole lot of thin air. The off stump is tilted back"
