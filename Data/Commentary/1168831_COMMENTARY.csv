"this one lands full on his toes, and he works to leg for a single"
"<b>caught at long on!</b> Umar Akmal was placed down there, but Fakhar decided to take on the fielder. He hit it alright, but didn't get much elevation and it went straight down the fielder's throat. Early strike!"

"shaping in slightly through the air, but the swing takes the ball towards his pads and Akhtar clips an easy two through square leg"

"Anwar aims for a yorker, Wiese wears it on the foot and can't get it away"
"Anwar bustles in and finds some inward seam movement to beat the bat and hit the back leg. There's an appeal, the umpire says no, and they ask for a <b>review</b>. He's hit in line, but it's high and the ball tracker comes back with umpire's call"

"full, straight, and Wiese turns the strike back over with a flick to midwicket"

"nice placement from Wiese, who drives wide of long on and creates room for a second run. The call was nice and early too, and he was quick off the blocks"

"<b>top edged, but safe!</b> Wiese set himself for a slog sweep, but the ball took the top edge and looped tamely towards short third man. Three fielders converged on it, and Sarfraz was the closest to it, but none could get there"

"worked off a middle stump line, into the leg side"

"yorker on off stump, it's dug out to cover and they sprint through for one. It's a really tight run, and de Villiers needs to dive to make his ground ... <b>oh dear, this doesn't look good. De Villiers is down and has jarred his back</b>. Something went as soon as he put in the dive. He turned over straight away, clutching his back. The physio sprints out, and AB is flat on his back, and in some discomfort. Remember, there's some history with his back. After some attention, he's sitting up again. Well, well, well, he'll continue."
"Mudassar charges in and flings down an excellent wide yorker outside off. AB can't get his bat down on it in time, and this is <b>Mudassar's 10th dot ball today</b>"

"more swing, but it starts too straight and then shapes down the leg side"
"<b>chipped to mid off!</b> Huge wicket in the first over. The ball was pitched right up to the bat, and Watson went for a big drive, aiming to get it over the infield. But he couldn't elevate it, and a simple catch is held at mid off"
"<b>beaten outside off!</b> More movement for Rahat, away from the left hander, who pushes tentatively from the crease"
"misdirected down the leg side, and <b>Rossouw lifts it over square leg</b>. A leg-stump half-volley, and it was there to be hit"

"He's got him first ball! Or has he? Rauf fires in a searing yorker at Sarfraz' toes, the ball tailing in and hitting him on the boot. The appeal is confident, and the finger goes up, but Sarfraz <b>reviews it</b> straight away. And it's a good one to review, as the curve in through the air was taking the ball down the leg side. But hang on, Anderson has also broken the stumps at the striker's end as the batsmen tried to take a single. Ahsan was short of his ground, but it can't be out as a decision had already been given on the lbw at the other end.
