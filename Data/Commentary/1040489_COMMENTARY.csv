"full and on the pads, waits for it to come on before tucking it with the angle through backward square leg. Vacant spaces available there and they come back for the second"

"short of a length, backs away again and makes room before lifting it over point who is inside the circle. No one guarding the third man area"
overcompensates with the length and sends a low full toss to Shahzad who drives but cannot beat cover. Lucky to get away with it

"fuller ball on the stumps, comes forward and knocks it to the bowler"
bowled at a flatter trajectory and Ghani is solid in defence
starts off with a wide delivery outside off. Intent is right as he is trying not to bowl anything in the line of the stumps and give the batsman a chance to go after it but the execution is all wrong
"comes on straighter and nipping in from a fuller length, whipped away with a half-angled bat to deep square leg"
"throws it away, really, comes down the track needlessly and misses the line completely. Length ball and he comes down the track. It comes on straight and he gets into an awkward position before attempting a pull. The ball misses the bat and takes out his stumps"
straight away comes down the track to this short ball and pulls this muscularly but cannot beat deep midwicket. And he has overstepped here. Too much indiscipline from Ireland's bowlers
"yikes, O'Brien is hit hard on his left hand. he clutches it and that must have stung pretty bad. Need some grit to carry on after copping that blow. His forearm already swells. Full ball and Shahzad has flogged that straight back to O'Brien. Cruel to call that a chance for a catch"

pitched up and wide outside off. Goes hard at it as he tries to launch it over the off side and gets it off the splice over point and the ball screams into the boundary on the bounce
"oh, good catch. Bowls it closer to the stumps and it is pitched up. But it is bowled at a flatter trajectory and he cannot get to the pitch of it. Tries to launch it and Thompson at long-on puts in a superbly-timed jump to snaffle it in front of the boundary"
muscled back to the bowler who catches it and runs towards the stumps with the non-striker backing away too far. Bends forward to take out the stumps but does not quite get there quickly enough and the batsman is back

"wide outside off, lazily sticks his bat out without feet and gets an inside edge, lucky for him that it misses the stumps"
"comes down the track and picks out deep midwicket. Flat ball, bowls it on the leg stump line and cramps him for the extra room he was looking for. Launches it and straight into the hands of Dockrell"
waits for it at the crease and opens the bat face late to steer it to point
"has he got the inside edge? Yes, he has. A late slide coming here. Double-strike for Mulder. Zadran does not pick the variation from the legspinner. Stays in the crease and plays for the turn but it spins the other way, takes a mild outside edge and it is held by the wicketkeeper"
eased down to long-on off the front foot
"sliding down the leg side, misses the sweep and called a wide. Dockrell unhappy for some reason, probably because the batsman was inside the line as he got in position to sweep"

"quicker on leg, clipped to long-on for a run"
"that is waaay over midwicket. Dragged the length back, short on leg, sits up for Nabi who dispatches his heave into the crowd at midwicket. Massive."
"goes flat and straight, Nabi wanted one to long-on but the ball skewed off the inside half and trickled just past the 30-yard circle, enabling the pair to come back for two."
"flat on leg, easily nudged towards square leg for a run"
"excellent batting. Shaped to play a sweep, but Dockrell fired his dart outside off. So Nabi opened the face and steered the ball past short third man"
nice bowling. Sees Nabi coming so fires it very wide outside off. Nabi stretched out and dabs one towards point. Would have been a wide and a wicket had he missed the ball
driven towards long-off for a run
"got sufficiently underneath the length and let his muscle do the rest. Full and wide outside off, Nabi stretches out and lofts the ball over cover. Huge"
"quick on leg, a bit of a leading edge back to the bowler"
"a slower ball gone awry, down leg for a wide"
"a high full toss on middle, skewed away towards midwicket"
"well bowled. There was at least one run there. A yorker on leg, hit back to the bowler who parried that towards mid-on. But Nabi says no"
"not good. Loses his length again, line isn't great either. A high full toss on the hips and Nabi swings him over deep backward square leg for six. Can't afford to miss your yorker so often."
"goes length this time. Full outside off, mis-timed towards deep cover for a couple"
another full toss. Punished. Of course. On middle at a lovely hitting height. And Nabi doesn't fail to deliver. Picks a gap at midwicket to accrue four more
"a flat six! Wow. A slower short ball outside off that sits up for Nabi. Flat-batted away past wide long-on. All power. Not a great over, 20 off it"
"swept away for four. This is decent pace, but these are fearless batsmen. A full delivery on off, Shenwari sees square leg and fine leg are up, so he gets low and paddles the ball over square leg"
"<b>lands in between three fielders</b>. Full outside off, chipped over cover. Long-off and deep cover run in but can't get close."
played away towards cover
that's where you need to be when in doubt. A wide yorker is well executed and the ball goes past Nabi
wow. Drilled for four. A 21-ball fifty for Nabi. Goes full does Thompson and Nabi hammers the ball back from where it came. Long-off didn't have a long way to go but couldn't get there
"oh no. That's quite awful bowling. On a length outside off, Nabi would have it nowhere else. Gets easily underneath the length and lofts the ball nonchalantly over long-off. Another massive over"
"a better change in length and O'Brien gets Shenwari. Digs it in short outside off, not the length he was expecting. Shenwari mis-times his slog and picks out deep midwicket, running in to complete an easy catch"
"finds the gap. Not a bad delivery but Nabi still gets enough power because of his bottom-hand power. Full on leg, whipped through midwicket for four."
sliced towards the sweeper cover for a run
"first ball? So what? Sits up on a length and pulls merrily away over midwicket does Janat. The difference between the wicket ball and this one was the line. More in the arc, and fine margins did the rest"
"got lucky there did O'Brien. Not great bowling, but the new man couldn't time it. Full in the arc outside off. Janat slices his lofted drive to long-off. Should have cleared long-off. Hands aloft because O'Brien now has four"
"goes full, goes straight and Nabi hammers his swat through midwicket. Long-on gets around to his right but parries the ball to the boundary while diving. Happens"
good batting. Pushes a length delivery to cover and gets off strike. Onto you Nabi
"six more. This is quite appalling now. Full, in the slot, outside off and Nabi just has to get underneath the length. he has been comfortable through the innings and is here too. His power clears long-off easily"
and again. What are you bowling? A slower ball but on a length outside off. Nabi stays deep in the crease and clatters a powerful lofted drive over long-off
"oh my. Not seen too many worse deliveries. A full toss this time on off. Nabi was waiting on the back foot and swings away with glee, over midwicket for the third of three consecutive sixes"
"a much better comeback, but what can you do? A slow wide yorker. Nabi looks to hit over cover but gets a thick inside edge which beats the keeper and runs away"
"run-out off the final ball. What an innings that has been. Finishes by executing his yorker but Nabi still drills it back to the non-striker's stumps. Goes through with the run, but the ball ricocheted back to the bowler, who ran to the stumps and made contact with the uprooted stump. A fine fine effort from Afghanistan"
"cramps Stirling with a leg side-ish delivery, off the pad towards point for a leg bye"
"on a length around off, quietly played towards midwicket for one"
"swung away. Not great line, on the pads, and Stirling helps it on its way over short fine leg"
sliced away over backward point. Slower ball on the stumps. Stirling gives himself room and carves the ball. Deceived by the pace slightly
"there has been some quite awful bowling this game. It ain't going anywhere. A full slower ball on middle, Stirling picks the variation and sends the ball way over long-on for six."
"well bowled. Good comeback. Thinking, seeing, reacting. Short of a length on leg after seeing Stirling advancing. Dabbed away towards point. 15 off the first"
"slow on leg, pushed to cover respectfully. Won't be much  more of this"
"flatter and straight, played quietly to cover"
"comes down, meets the ball as it pitches and sends the ball sailing over long-on. Fantastic batting. Undid the bowler in the mind"
"thwacked over cover. Again, playing with the bowler's length. Goes right back, backs away, makes room and slaps a length ball over cover. Knew where the ball was going to be because of the field."
hammered away straight to cover this time.
"oh lovely. The Bowler pulls his length back, allows the ball to grip but Stirling just punches a drive nonchalantly in the gap at cover. Easy as ... 14 off that. Ireland are rolling"
"a wild heave. Length on off, Thompson inside-edges the ball into his pad. No worry, off you go again"
"a slower, wide delivery. Thompson checks his stroke towards cover for one. Not the worst result for Ireland"
<b>dropped</b>. No. No. No. Can't drop 'em. Stirling anticipates something straight so gives himself room and drills a drive to cover who gets to his right but drops what should be taken 98% of the time. Shenwari the fielder.
"<b>dropped again!</b> Whaaaat? Should be taken 100% of the time. Firstly, it's a terrible delivery - full down leg. Stirling picks it off his pads and picks out fine leg running to his right. But the ball somehow spills out."
"more tripe. Short and wide outside off, sits up on a slow surface and Thomspon slaps the ball over cover with pretty good timing. Nicely played. Didn't bother keeping it down"
<b>lucky</b>. Slower ball outside off but it's so full that Thompson just needed to make contact for a boundary. Misses his exuberant lofted cover drive
"fired in outside off, Stirling allows the ball onto him before opening the face late to find the gap through backward point."
"flat and straight, worked to midwicket"
"oh gosh. Just four in the circle, so many gaps and Stirling picks the one in front of cover. Short and wide from Nabi."
"better. Full and straight, pushed down to long-on"
"full and straight, inside-edged his wild have into his pad."
"easy! So easy. Nabi drops short on leg, Thomspon goes back and pulls over deep midwicket. Six more. Ireland's fifty is up"
"just lands inside the boundary. It's a no-ball too. Yikes! On a length on middle, Stirling swings over midwicket. Good call by the umpire, seen so many of those not called. Definitely overstepped."
"does it really matter? No, says Stirling. Gets length again and puts it away over mid-on. <b>Stirling on 49 off 19</b>"
"picks out deep square leg this time. Absolutely humongous moment in this game. A low full toss on off, Stirling walks across and sweep-flicks the ball straight to deep square leg, where Nabi gets across and takes a good reverse-cupped catch moving to his left"
"full and straight, right in the slot. Thompson lifts the ball over long-on for six. Shapoor not happy with the fielder but there isn't much he could have done. He has the fielder swapped"
"slower delivery outside off, Thompson misses his cut. Nice change in pace, but the change-down in pace isn't hard to discern"
"lifted over cover for four more. Full outside off, Thompson knew the area he wanted to exploit and executes."
"superb! Saves two does the fielder. Short of a length on off, much better change in length. Pulled over mid-off, but long-on gets across and cuts it in with a dive. This is some fight. Did he have his foot on the boundary cushion? Not sure."
"pushed to mid-on for a run, good batting"
"slow on leg, Thomspon misses a slog and is struck on the pad"
"swung away to midwicket. Nice, flat bowling. But it's still on a length"
this one doesn't even pitch. A full toss on off and Thomspon says thanks with a swat over the bowler's head
six more runs. Full down leg and Thomspon hits this behind square. Got underneath this too
hit past cover for a run to long-off. That means Ireland plunder 91 off the Powerplay.
"flat outside off, powered over cover with a flat-batted show of muscle. Sublime timing this"
"he finally misses one does Thompson. Did the right thing by trying to keep the momentum going. Just plain missed the ball. Flat on leg, Thomspon fails to connect with a slog and loses his wicket. Another fine hand"

gets down and whips the ball to deep midwicket
"flat on off, clattered to cover. Good comeback from Hamza"
"an overpitched half-volley outside off, driven to cover. Hammered to cover"
fantastic length. It's a good length for a reason. O'brien can' connect with an attempted dab from outside off
smashed to long-off. Just one. Ireland falling behind the rate again
"fullish on leg, pushed to long-on"
this has been a superb over. O'Brien sees a full length but it's full with no pace on it. The slower variation and O'Brien just picks out long-on with his lofted drive. This is why chasing 200-plus scores are never easy; one ball can change the way the game progresses
driven to long-off to complete one of the overs of the game
"flat and straight, clipped to deep midwicket"
shimmies down and pushes the ball to long-on
"whipped to deep square leg. Flat and straight, it's on a hitting length but wickets mean Porterfield can't take a risk"
another nudge into the leg side for one. Tarakai was quick on it from deep midwicket to prevent two
the reverse sweep is placed well between point and third man but there isn't enough power to beat the fielders. Almost a collision but Stanikzai half-stops the ball

"full delivery on off, dabbed to point for a quick run."

"flat on the pads, helped away to the deep backward square leg boundary with good-enough timing"
"shortish on leg, pulled to deep midwicket for a couple"
"picks out long-on. Nabi runs in and takes another good catch. Flat on leg, Porterfield backs away but can only chip the ball to the fielder running in. Didn't get enough elevation or distance."
"darted in on leg, nudged for a run to square leg"
runs down but bunts a stroke to cover. Rashid is quick on it and hits the stumps direct at the bowler's end. The batsman plonked his foot inside despite having the bat in his hands. Amateurish batting

mis-timed slog to deep square leg earns McBrine two
McBrine runs down and misses a drive. Vital dots
"quick and fast on leg, pulled to deep square leg with awful timing. Harried for pace"

patted towards long-on. Wants two but Nabi reacts well to prevent the extra run
"picks the gap at square leg. Six more. Shimmies down, gets a slow length delivery and the ball is slogged way over the square leg boundary."
"given out on the stroke! Not a great shot, but that looked like it was hitting off stump. A well-executed yorker on off, McBrine tries a cheeky reverse lap and since the length is so full, hardly has a chance of connecting. Hit on the pad and the umpire gives him"
"full outside off, wants a run to cover but the ball sneaks through bat and pad and almost knocks off stump back"
"end of an excellent spell. Full and straight, played back to the bowler"
"<strong>dropped</strong>! Another one. Beaten in the flight outside off, Wilson top-edges his slog to point. Shapoor dives to his left, getting in Stanikzai's way who gets forward and drops the chance, toughened by Shapoor's movement"

"flat on off, the legbreak, turns and takes the outside edge to short third man"

"flat and wide outside off, swept away towards short fine leg"
flat on middle and leg. Full. But Tucker plays back and works the ball to long-on for one
"given runs. <strong>Big appeal</strong>. The googly on off and middle. Wilson doesn't read it. Goes back to cut but the ball rips back in. Struck him in front of off but was there some bat before pad, or pad before bat?"
"clattered through cover for a couple. Good fielding by Shenwari, diving to his right"
a slower ball down the leg side results in a free run for Ireland
"a low full toss on off, slogged to deep square leg for one"
"great stuff from the fielder But Shapoor has overstepped again. Shovelled away to deep midwicket. The fielder gets to his left, and pulls it in acrobatically. Another great call  by the umpire. So marginal, but definitely over"
flicked away to deep midwicket for one
"a thick inside edge. Full and straight, Wilson mows but gets just enough bat to beat the stumps and the keeper"
"clipped to midwicket, just one."

"flat and straight, a mis-timed pull to midwicket. Wilson scurries back for two"
"slog-swept into the hands of deep midwicket, and that should probably be the game. A full legreak, deserved to go. Wilson got underneath but only skied the ball into the reverse-cupped hands of the fielder"
"runs down, skews the legbreak over cover for a couple. Didn't quite get to the pitch"
"bowled 'im. Another one. Flat on leg, Tucker hurries back and misses his pull. Leg stump is hit and Ireland's impressive fight looks short, in all likelihood"
flicked to deep midwicket for one
"another one. Three in the over. Another ripping googly that isn't read by the batsman. Gets down to sweep and misses, clips the top of leg stump"
"that's not one. A yorker on off, jammed down to long-on, who runs in, picks up cleanly and throws the stumps down at the bowler's end. McCarthy may not have a worse day in cricket. 0 off 0 after the most expensive figures in T20I cricket"
"that's the game. A slow, short delivery outside off. Dockrell slog-sweeps the ball into the hands of deep midwicket. <strong>Afghanistan's impressive run keeps chugging along</strong>. 11 unbeaten now."
