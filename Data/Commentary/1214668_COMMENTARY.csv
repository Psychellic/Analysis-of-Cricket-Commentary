Zimbabwe have bowled well this afternoon, and that's a lucky break for them"

"<strong>that's the opening wicket!</strong> Islam has been angling all the balls in, and that's why Chakabva looks to flick one that slants in with the natural angle, but that just holds its line a touch and then takes the outside edge. Pops up towards cover, and Liton Das takes it comfortably"

"a bit of movement away from the outside edge, and beats an <strong>attempted drive</strong> through covers!"

"length, punched back towards mid-off"
"good shot, but not for runs! Leans into a cover drive, but cannot get it either side of the fielder stationed at cover"
"length, and he plays this just wide of mid-off. They set off for the run, and just about make it. In fact, a <strong>direct hit could have had things interesting</strong> for Taylor, who is not as sprightly as he used to be once!"

"<strong>superb shot from Taylor!</strong> He's now a bit more used to the pace and angle of Islam, and just drops him straight back over his head with a lofted drive. A couple of bounces, and through to the long-on fence"
"drops this at his feet. Wants a quick single, but sent back early"
"length, played towards mid-on, and what a <b>massive bit of fielding</b> this is from Mehidy Hasan! Runs across from short mid-wicket to his left, underarm flicks this towards the non-striker's end and catches Taylor short. He wouldn't have expected this outcome in his wildest dreams, but smart cricket from Mehidy. Knows Taylor isn't the quickest between the wickets going around"
"a bit short, but good pace, and hurries Kamunhukamwe as he looks to defend"
"length, down the pads, and he flicks it away towards deep square leg"
"short, and he rocks back and punches this through covers. What a way to get off the mark!"
"slightly ungainly, he loses his shape as he looks to target the straight boundary and it comes off the toe end, just the one"
"he comes around the stumps, landing this on a length. Williams has a look and lets it go"
"fuller this time, and coming in to him on the angle. Defended from the crease"
"indecision from Williams, who is neither forward nor back and doesn't seem sure whether to play this or not. <b>Beaten</b> on the outside edge"

"Williams steps across into a good looking drive, but can't find the placement he's looking for"
"firmly whipped down to long on, just the single though"
"<b>mix up in the middle!</b> Tapped to cover, Williams wants the single and sets off, then he's sent back, then Kamunhukamwe starts to run. But they both scamper home in time, no harm done"
"<b>pulled over midwicket!</b> Mehidy drops just a little short, and Williams hops back to open up his stance, slamming a pull up and over midwicket"
"flatter through the air, and he's forward to defend"
"nicely accurate once again, and Williams comes forward"
"<b>pad first, and he's given out!</b> Williams spotted the length, which was short, but it was also delivered quicker, and zipped on to him quickly, skidding on with the arm. He's deep in the crease, looking for the cut, but it hits the pad first and then the bat, prompting a big lbw shout. Up goes the finger, and that's another dent in Zimbabwe"
"rising off a length, up towards his midriff, and it's defended to leg"
"nipping in to him off the seam, and Kamunhukamwe jabs at it with his feet going nowhere. He's fortunate to get an inside edge on it"
"<b>short, pulled into the stands!</b> He's already biffed one of these off Mashrafe, and now he repeats the dose against Hossain. Short, and he climbs into it with a flowing pull. Doesn't bother keeping it down, and it goes all the way"
"<b>crunched through point now</b>, his eyes light up on another short one, outside off this time. Kamunhukamwe is up on his toes and flings his hands through a cut"
"that's a better length, fuller and giving him nothing to work with, defence is the response"
"landing on a length, angling in. He gets back and across and nudges into the leg side"
"floated up outside off, tapped back at him"

"arm ball, drifting away slightly, and it's watchfully defended"

"full, just outside off and it's pushed to cover with a checked drive"
"chopped down towards backward point, but the fielder's in in a flash and there's no room for a single"
"<b>beaten</b>, outside off. Did he just roll the fingers on this one? Or did it hit the seam? Either way, it nips away off the track and past the edge"
"<b>this time he does find the edge!</b> But again it goes for four, bouncing down to third man. Where's the slip?"
"<b>and straight away, he drops a chance!</b> Shanto's the man there, and he was perfectly positioned to hold on to this one, a length ball finding the edge of a forward poke and flying just to his left. He gets his hands to it, but it slips straight out again"
"nudged with the spin, into space on the leg side for one"
"arm ball, just a little drift away from him through the air, but he's well forward to keep it out"

"twirled down just outside off, and he's forward to defend"
"skews off the outside edge as he plays for turn and the ball rushes on straight, the ball rolling through point"

"<b>maiden international fifty for Kamunhukamwe!</b> He goes deep in the crease and flicks to leg, calling for a quick single. There's a big smile on his face as he raises his bat to the dugout"
"quicker one, the bat hurries down to jab the ball back at the bowler"
"just short of a length, in the channel, and he stays deep to defend"
"just a touch too straight, and he uses the angle to find a single on the leg side"
"rising outside off at 127.2km/h, he hops into a defensive push"
"angled in from wide of the crease, drawing him forward into a defensive push"
"tapped in front of square, to the right of point, and they nip through for a quick single"
"<b>appeal for lbw!</b> It wasn't the most emotive appeal though, and the umpire was certainly unmoved. It nipped in off the seam, but struck him above the knee roll and most probably going over. No review"

"arm ball, rushing on to hit him on the pad, but sliding down the leg side"
"landing outside off, tapped square"
"<b>bowled him!</b> Kamunhukamwe wanted to get a move on, and he clears his left leg and sets himself for a wild mow. But again the ball dips on him, rushing past the bat and just clipping the off bail. An immediate strike for Taijul!"

"dug in, and offering some width outside off. Raza's not interested"
"fuller, straight, and nipping in a touch off the seam. Solid defence"
"<b>beaten outside off!</b> Raza goes fishing at one that angles in and then nips away, and he's lucky not to get an edge on that. Cracking delivery"
"aimed at his pads, Raza places it just wide of midwicket for a quick single"
"punched, on the up through point, another one to the total. Raza drops his beat as he runs through, but collects it in time to get home"
"<b>direct hit would have got him!</b> Raza chops to point and sets off. He's sent back, turning around midpitch, and as the shy comes in he's not even in the frame, but it goes wide"

"quicker one, rushing straight on. It's spotted and pushed back to the bowler"

"much fuller, outside off, squeezed out through point"
"Madhevere waits deep in his crease, allowing the ball to turn and then using the angle to work a single into the leg side"
"<b>interesting stuff</b>, Madhevere takes one hop towards the leg side before Taijul delivers, and then punches through point. He jumped back with both feet together. Cute"
"<b>up, up and away!</b> Raza uses his feet too, but down the track to get close to the ball and then lets loose with a big hit down the ground, it goes 86 metres and well over the rope"
"more fancy footwork, but this time he drives along the ground through the covers"
"quicker one, hurrying young Wesley's defence"
"well bowled, landing on middle and off, punched back at the bowler"
"good connection on the backfoot punch, but a clean stop at point denies them the run"

"Madhevere's frustration continues, he skips out and can only drive it back at the bowler"
"<b>pulled in the air</b>, but <i>just</i> past a diving midwicket fielder. The ball bounces out to deep midwicket, but some tardy running means they only get one. Raza the guilty party"
"fiercely pulled through square leg, but there's protection in the deep"
"punched to cover, but Mashrafe's there and he can't get it past him"

"flicked off the toes, into the leg side"
"firmly punched off the back foot, but straight to midwicket"
"Raza aims for a sweep, but misses and wears it on the pad. There's an appeal, though I don't know for what. It seemed to have pitched well outside leg. Ah, but what's this? After some discussion, <b>Mashrafe asks for the review!</b> That's a shocker, and the replays only serve to confirm that it pitched way outside leg. Who convinced him to do that?"
"Raza's on one leg as he flaps a wristy flick at the ball, placing it through point"
"some grip and spin, but it goes down the leg side, touching the pad on the way through. Given as runs though, must have got something on it"
"glanced in front of square on the leg side, just the one"
"eased down the ground, one more"
"quicker one, rushing on with the arm. There's some excitement, but it's easily kept out"
"<b>HUGE!</B> Raza skips out and murders the ball over deep midwicket. Absolutely leathered it, wonderful sound off the bat. And it brings up Zimbabwe's 150"
"tapped to point, <b>almost another mix-up</b>, but Madhevere is sent back"
"placed to the right of point this time, and now there is room for a single"

"pushed through a little quicker, tapped back towards Raza, the ball ricochets off him and rolls to long on"

"an angled blade sends the ball bouncing towards point, no run to be had"
"<b>in the air, but safe!</b> Another short one, but it had a little more behind it and was well directed, at the throat. Madhevere pulls and top edges, but Mushfiqur can't quite get to it behind the stumps"
"dug in very short, ballooning way over the batsman. Called wide"
"fuller, pushed to cover, no run there"
"short, Raza hops into a pull, up on one leg he is, and gets a good connection too, but equally good fielding on the boundary keeps them to one"
"looks to run a length ball down to third man. Cannot beat point, though"
"good length, and straightens a bit after pitching. Raza wants to flick it away, but is forced to defend at the last moment"
"glides this to the right of third man. Mahmudullah looks to attack the ball, one-handed, and ends up misfielding. They get the second quite easily"
plays a straighter ball away towards deep backward square leg
"length, down the leg side, and he misses with a swing"
"<strong>dropped</strong> at sweeper cover, but a good effort to get rid of Madhevere. Picks up a length ball, and probably wants to go straight, but ends up skewing it a bit on the off side. The fielder dives forward, but cannot latch on to it"
"<b>fifty for Madhevere</b>, with a gorgeous straight drive. Uppish, but past the bowler. Win or lose today, this young man has been the biggest gain in these two games for Zimbabwe. Ridden his luck a touch, but shown confidence in his strokeplay and judiciously mixed caution with aggression. His handling of the Bangladesh spinners has been exemplary too"
"fullish, driven hard towards long-off"
"fired straight down, and he's caught in the crease off the back foot. Raza asks him not to review, and <strong>there's the breakthrough</strong>! Just misreads the line on this, and makes the error of playing back when he could have gone forward. Good ball from Taijul, though"
"full, driven back towards the bowler. Bowled around leg and middle"
driven past the bowler towards long-off
"cuts one late, and from the stumps almost. Goes through quickly towards short third man, but point gets across to cut this off"

"length, around off, driven off the inside of the bat back towards the bowler"
"length, lifts this towards long-off, and <strong>just clears Tamim</strong>, who was three-quarters of the way towards the boundary at long-off"
"smacks this through covers. Should have been stopped at cover, but that was hit with some velocity. Probably also got a bad bounce just around him, did Liton Das. But that's a good shot. Extended well to meet it on a length outside off"
"looks to run one towards third man, but it goes to point"
"strays down the pads, and he helps it away to the long leg fence. This is <strong>excellent batting</strong> from Mutumbami, as he keeps the pressure on the bowler"

"length, and he plays this away towards mid-wicket and takes the quick single on offer"
"down the wicket, chips it in the air towards mid-wicket. Short of the man in the deep"
"firm drive, moving forward towards wide mid-off, and Afif, the substitute gets across to his left and cuts this off"
defends one straightening into him
"length, pushes this towards deep cover. Easy single"
"full ball, and he looks to flick this away, and it's given leg-before, and he <strong>reviews immediately</strong>! At first glance, it seems to have slid down the leg side, but let's remember the on-field decision is out. It was bowled flat, and fast, and he wasn't able to lay any bat on this. It stays umpire's call, because it was just clipping the top of leg!"
"<strong>superb shot from Raza!</strong> Mortaza is not very quick, and he offers up some width outside off. Raza waits to meet it late, under his eyes, and places it between point and third man"
"length, comes forward a touch and plays it away towards deep mid-wicket. They run hard and complete two"
"moves across, and shuffles this away over short fine leg"
"length, too straight, and he has played this past short fine leg. Delightful bit of timing and placement, as he picks two before deep square leg can scurry around and cut this off"
"slashes this, straight to <strong>third man</strong>! Raza had picked up 12 off the first four balls, and would have been aiming for six more, but he has timed this a bit too well. A bit short and wide from Mortaza, but at his pace, the batsman is always looking to generate his own speed on the ball. Raza plays a good upper cut, but cannot keep it down, and third man pouches that. That should be <B>game, set and match Bangladesh!</b>"
"dug in a bit short, and Tiripano fails to make contact with it"

"lofts this over cover, but there's a fielder in the deep now for that shot. A couple of bounces through to him"
"length, and he goes back to defend back towards the bowler"
"good length, straightens with the angle from around the stumps, and he defends with a forward press"
"goes for the reverse sweep, and just about connects before this can crash into his pads. Taijul goes into a half-appeal, but stops. Fielded at short third man"
"driven back past the bowler. Uppish, but through to long-off"
"length, angles in, and he plays this to short mid-wicket. They take off, and a <strong>direct hit, would have had him out</strong> at the non-striker's end. As it turns out, he misses!"
"skips down the track, and flogs this through extra cover. Hit with power, and lofted into the gap"
"length, down the leg side, and he fails to make contact with an intended glance. Called wide, in any case"
"shortens his length seeing the batsman advance. Into his body as he tries to slog it away. They pinch a single, as it must have come off the inside edge"
flicks a straghter ball towards deep mid-wicket. Just a single for this
"slower ball, around off, and he plays this towards cover-point to pick up a single"
"length, straight towards the pads, and he plays this towards mid-wicket"
"goes for the reverse sweep, and there's a loud appeal for leg before. They choose not to review this, as they run quickly to complete a leg bye"
"down the wicket, and smacked towards long-on"
"skips down the wicket, and makes it a half-volley outside off. Driven hard towards long-off"
"<strong>that's a fine shot!</strong> Uses his feet to chip down the wicket, and makes some room on the off side as well. Drives hard, and gets through the cover region. Gave long-off no chance"
"holds this back a touch, line along leg, and he whips it towards mid-wicket"
"reverse sweep, but gets only a single to short third man"
"comes down the wicket, and heaves this over long-on. A good shot in the end, because he gave it a proper kitchen-sink treatment. <strong>Went quite high, and long enough</strong>!"
"cracked through covers. Moves away a touch to make room, and then hammers this past mid-off, who's inside the circle"
"looks to pull a shorter ball. Miscued a touch, but still gets it away in the direction of deep mid-wicket"
"smacks this ramrod-straight past the bowler. <strong>What a shot!</strong> This is such a true wicket, that if you miss the yorker even by a small margin, the batsman can cash in. That's exactly what Mutombodzi does"
"way down the leg side, in trying to tuck the batsman up"
"shorter, and slower, and he is through with an attempted biff over point too early"
"slower, short ball again, and he fails to make contact with an attempted run down towards third man. Seemed to pick the length and the pace, but not so much the line of it, just around off"
"goes for a full ball, but ends up offering width. Tiripano has flogged this inside out, over extra cover. <strong>Extraordinary!</strong>"
"length, and this is drilled over long-off. <strong>What a shot again from DT</strong>! Slightly predictable from Islam, and if he misses his length, Tiripano is going to take full toll"
"short, and he has skewed an intended pull shot. This goes past short fine leg, and teases him on the way through to the boundary!"
"that's another <strong>delicious shot!</strong> Cracked through extra cover and the sweeper gets around to his right and rifles in a throw, but they scamper through for the second"
"yorker, around off, and he plays this towards point. They settle for the single, though Tirpano wanted a second and took a few steps down for that as well!"
"yorker, driven towards long-on"
"length, and he backs away and tries to knock the leather off this. Only gets it towards deep mid-wicket, but he won't mind getting <strong>Tiripano back on strike</strong>!"
"backs away, but Al-Amin responds with a yorker on middle stump. Can only drive this towards sweeper cover"
"short, and he swats this away, but cannot get it either side of deep mid-wicket. Lucky for Al-Amin"
"fuller, around off, and he looks to drill this towards cover. Gets it off the outer part of the bat towards deep point"
"fuller length, around off, and he tonks this down towards long-on"
"fuller length, and he swats this hard over cover, and long-off runs around to his left, and does well to hold on to this low to his left. <strong>Keeps them down to two</strong>, and crucially Mutombodzi to start with the strike"
"<strong>what a shot!</strong> Shafiul looks for the full ball, but cannot nail that yorker, and he shuffles across to access the off side. Lofts this just wide of long-off!"
"yorker, and he still advances and plays it away with one hand towards mid-wicket. Slows up around the edge of the circle, and they can come back for two"
"full toss, around leg stump, and he tries to flog it away on the onside. But he can only hit it deep towards mid-wicket"
"<strong>perfect yorker</strong>, just around off, and he plays it towards point to pick up the single on offer"
"he's found the gap between mid-wicket and long-on! Shafiul looks to nail the yorker, but it turns out to be a low full toss on leg stump, and he makes room and just smacks it straight through the on side"
"makes room, and smacks this inside out, to the left of long-off"
"length, and he has hit this hard, but not too far from long-on. <strong>They can only pick a single</strong>, as this has travelled quickly"
"short, and this might be a wide. Yes it is! Mutombodzi was looking to use his feet, and Al-Amin may have shortened his length in response, but it goes too short"
"straight shot, but <strong>doesn't carry beyond long-on</strong>! Brave, brave effort from Mutombodzi comes to an end. Was this a slower ball, perhaps? Because he seemed to get a good hold of it, but it just held up a touch, and ended up being a comfortable catch for the man stationed precisely for that shot. A six there, and the match would really have been on with four balls to go!"
"Tiripano <strong>clears long-on</strong>! Skips down the track, and hammers this over long-on. Just short of the sightscreen. This is fabulous from Zimbabwe"
"<strong>he's got a hold of this</strong>! Al-Amin has missed the yorker again, and Tiripano just leans back and gives it everything. Gets it wide, and way high over long-on. <b>Fifty for Tiripano!</b> And an unlikely victory very much in sight now!"
"short, and this is a <strong>good response from Al-Amin</strong>! This is fast, and perhaps goes over the head of DT. He could have had a wide here, but didn't!"
"length ball, around off, and he smacks this down to long-off. <strong>No fairytale ending</strong>, but what a fightback from Zimbabwe!"
