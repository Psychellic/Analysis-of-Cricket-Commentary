"full and cuts away outside off, DK chases it with a late cut and misses"
"big appeal for a catch at backward point. Phenomenal effort from Williamson. He isn't sure, though. <b>The soft signal is out</b>. The finger goes up. DK is gone for a duck. He, perhaps, looks to play towards mid-on and spoons a leading edge towards backward point against a cutter. Williamson throws himself to his left and plucks the ball out with one hand. It snuck under his palm. The TV umpire Ananthapadmanabhan deems it a clean catch. The fielder took it inches from the ground"
