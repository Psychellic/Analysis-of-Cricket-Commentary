"<b>is this run out, or caught behind?</b> Riaz sends down a full one, angled in from around the stumps. The ball zips through to Kamran, who appeals for a catch off the inside edge. The batsmen attempt another stolen bye, and Kamran throws the stumps down. But they'll also <b>review</b> for the caught behind. Replays show it was off the pad, so the run out stands"

"pushed to point, Fletcher wants a single but he's sent back"

"<b>swept up and over fine leg!</b> Kamran walks right across to the off side, lifting the ball over fine leg"
"<b>collision in the field!</b> Kamran backs away and plays much too early into the covers, the ball ballooning up and right between mid off and cover. Walton runs across from cover, Shadab from mid off, and as the ball comes down they run into each other. Somehow, amid all that, Shadab has managed to hold onto the ball and completes the catch.

"<b>edged, and gone!</b> Fletcher dabs a cut at a legbreak but he can only send a thin edge into Ronchi's gloves. It seemed to be a clear edge, off the toe end, but the umpire says no. Shadab immediately sends it upstairs for a <b>review</b>, and replays show that there was, indeed, a thin edge"
Amin's back and across to defend this one back to the bowler
"short and it's pulled hard down to fine leg, where Nasir pulls off an excellent tumbling stop to save runs ... Ooh, and he seems to be in some pain afterwards. His knee might have just stuck in the sandy outfield. <b>This really doesn't look good.</b> He's going to be stretchered off. His knee dug into the turf as he tumbled to stop the ball, jarring rather than sliding, and he's definitely done some damage"

"short and wide, but Pollard's shot goes straight to cover"
"<b>stumped by a mile!</b> Pollard jumps down the track, but this one was held back by Zafar and turned <i>sharply</i> to beat his attempted loft. Ronchi collects cleanly and does the rest. Zafar is pumped! That's the wicket Islamabad really needed"
