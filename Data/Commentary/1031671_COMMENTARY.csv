"silky stuff from Hope! Too full and straight from Willey, although not a bad ball, but it's made to look ordinary by a wristy whip that flies wide of mid-on for another four"
steers this square on the back foot
"slower delivery, picked up by Gayle and hoicked merrily over midwicket, couple of boucnes to the rope"
banged in short and this time Gayle hops back - sending a juddering through the Bristol turf - to ramp the ball over gully and away for four more!
"short again, rising sharply past the top edge as Gayle attempts to pull"
"on the stumps, maybe a slower ball, tapped into the leg side"
"full in the channel, Hope reaches for the drive and gets a thick inside-edges towards mid-on"
"pitched up and driven, Woakes fields in his follow through"
"dug in short, Gayle sways nonchalantly out of the way while dropping his hands"
"another bouncer, Gayle doesn't get out of the way this time... <b>instead he puts it out of the ground!</b> A brutal flay over deep square leg, clearing the stands and bouncing up beyond the wire fence. Fetch!"
"short again from Plunkett, this beats the top edge as Gayle swings wildly"
"length ball, maybe a touch slower, checked into the covers and they take one"
overpitched outside off and Hope just eases it away through the covers for another boundary
"back of a length, 88mph and taking the leading edge as he works across the line"
"round the wicket, angled in flat, Gayle pushes it away into the off side"
"on the stumps, not much turn, patted back down the track"
"pushed through on off, Gayle dabs it away square"
"tossed up and Gayle leans out to loft a drive, slightly sliced and it fades away from Stokes, running across from long-off, before bouncing away to the fence"
"flatter delivery, tapped back to the bowler"
"darted in on the stumps, Gayle pushes it away watchfully"
"short of a length outside off, 87mph and guided down to third man from back in the crease"
"scrambled seam from Plunkett, fullish outside off and Gayle swings and misses"
"back of a length, pulled off the splice - shout of 'catch!' from Plunkett but it lands wide of long-on, just a single for the big man, though"
"full in the channel, Hope reaches for the drive - <b>nicked to the keeper!</b> Hope slopes off, maybe done for pace, it was a cross-seam delivery that skidded on and there was an audible edge as he went hard at the ball"
"touch back of a length, blocked down into the off side, Samuels thinks about a run but his partner isn't interested"
"short outside off, 85mph and Samuels throws his hands in the air out of the way"
"dragged down from Moeen, and <b>dispatched via pigeon carrier into the stands again!</b> That's fifty from 38 balls for Gayle, who raises his bat briefly before narrowing his eyes and getting his focus back"
angled in flat and tapped away
"tossed up and clubbed back past the bowler, Moeen <i>nearly</i> gets a hand on it - but instead it flies for four!"
"gives it some air, Gayle does the same in kind - and <b>Bairstow can't quite get to it in the deep!</b> Not sure he picked it up straight away and then he had to run to his right and was left sprawling as it bounced past him for four"
on the stumps and chipped over the off side for one
"over the wicket, flighted and tapped to leg with the turn"
"full on the stumps, dinked back past the bowler for one"
"good length, pinning him on the knee jumping across, Plunkett appeals... maybe high? They consider reviewing but eventually decide not to"
"dropped into the leg side, Plunkett gives chase, turns and hurls for the non-striker's end - but the throw misses, with Samuels struggling, and then races away to the rope for four more!"
"shortish on the body, tucked behind square"
"banged in, Samuels swivels to pull, good fielding from Bairstow in the deep prevents four - but that is the West Indies 100 up"
"pushed across Gayle, who prods it back down the track"
"slogged down the ground, he's not got hold of it... <b>but the ball lands between long-off and long-on!</b> Frustration for England, I think Gayle had his head down ready to plod off there. Landed perfectly between two men"
"pushed through on off, defended"
length on the stumps and worked behind square with the turn
"tossed up from round the wicket, defended"
"touch short and Gayle gently pumps it over midwicket, into a gap but Bairstow does more good work barreling around the boundary, relaying to Woakes for the return"
"flighted, spinning in to hit the front pad as Samuels pushes forward"
"Gayle hangs back, nearly gets in a tangle as he chips off his legs, the ball lands a few feet in front of Hales at deep square"
"pitched up and sliced high and handsome over gully, Samuels picks up his first boundary"
"length ball, big swing again from Samuels, carving out fresh air... although England are quite keen on the appeal and decide to <b>review</b>. There's a very slight murmur on Ultra Edge but Rod Tucker seems happy to call that 'conclusive' - <b>so Samuels is on his way!</b> Keeper and slip led the process, while Plunkett didn't seem to hear anything. I suppose there's not much else it could have been, although it wasn't much more than a fart on the graph"
pitched up wide of the stumps and left alone
"good length, gets him coming forwards trying to feel bat on ball, beats the outside edge"
"tighter to off stump, 86mph and blocked into the covers"
"pushed through outside leg stump, big heave from Gayle, which flies over Buttler and he's eventually called through by Mohammed... but the throw to the non-striker's end then nearly runs Gayle out!"

"tight line, at off stump, played back to the bowler"
"short of a length outside off, pushed off the back to the left of mid-off"

"back of a length outside off, neatly placed through backward point wide of third man"
"the bottom hand comes off the bat as he drives, in the air over cover to the sweeper"

played square to point
"short outside off, he tries to pull through the leg side but doesn't make contact"

"nearly does him with a slower one here, Mohammed giving himself room again and has to hold his shot for a fraction longer"
"full and straight, pinged back to Moeen"
"a little shorter and flatter, pushed to the covers"
that's pretty simple...a little shuffle around the crease then a strong club down the ground straight of long-on
"that's huge! Over the crowd, rather than into it this time. Gets well underneath and these boundaries are no challenge to Gayle if he wants to clear them"
"make that three in a row, over long-off this time...Gayle has decided it's time to fire up the afterburners again. Into the 90s"

"full outside off, 86mph, skewed off a thick outside edge down to third man"
"back of a length outside off, doesn't get his timing as he plays to mid-off"
"fuller, driven to mid-off"

"pitches outside leg stump, takes the pad behind square"
"back of a length, angled in at off stump, pushed into the covers"

"straighter, can't get it past midwicket"
"touch shorter, played with a straight bat down to long-on"

that's a big drag down but he gets away with it as Mohammed pulls to deep square leg
left alone outside off
a flat-batted drive down the ground long-off
that's a very sweet strike...Rashid gets too full and Powell pumps him straight back over his head
"drags the length back a little, touch wider, defended"
"good length outside off, blocked on the front foot"
"<b>taken at long-on!</b> This is coming down with snow on it, Powell aiming down the ground again, sends it straight up in the air and Woakes settles under the catch"

"lovely bowling, beats the inside edge this time with some turn"

"drives, gets a thick inside edge into the pads"
"full and straight, turns a little, defended"
"gets down and paddle sweeps fine of short fine leg but Willey is able to chase it down, and a direct hit might have found Holder short...well out! Buttler let the ball go to hit the stumps rather than gather it. At least the captain dived"

"that's come out of the middle, swung mightily over deep midwicket...given the chance to get underneath that"
"shorter, worked to long-on"

"a little too short, whipped to deep square leg"
pushed off the front foot to cover
flicked out to deep midwicket
"outside off, defended"
very nice from the skipper...six No. 27 of the day as Holder stays in his crease and launches Moeen straight down the ground. That will feel nice after his problems against the offspin
"good length, prodded into the covers, Holder has to swing his bat back at the non-striker's end as the throw comes in"
"dug in short, Mohammed pulls... <b>straight down the gullet of deep square leg!</b> Bairstow snags it safely and turns to celebrate in front of the crowd, Mohammed never really got going and now he's got to get going. And DLS will adjust upwards accordingly"
"length, shaping away a fraction, started wide and finished wider"
"pitched up and met on the front foot, pushed towards cover"
"shortish outside off, Nurse rides the bounce and defends behind square"
"back of a length, room for Nurse to swing his arms but he fails to connect with a lusty swipe"
pitched up and clipped through square leg to the man in the deep
"flighted, drifting and then straightening to hit the front pad - given! Michael Gough doesn't take long to make up his mind but Nurse, after a chat with his captain, decides to <b>review</b>... which is the dictionary definition of 'in vain', as he was nowhere near hitting it and Hawk-Eye suggests the ball would have hit the off bail"

"quick on off, topspinner, I think, gets into line and blocks"
"does him with the Bosie again, drifting away past the bat... and this time Buttler does break the stumps. They check with the third umpire but his back foot didn't look to have lifted and on we go"
"short outside off, tapped down behind square"
"pitched up and rifled back over long-off, <b>clean strike for six by Holder!</b> That's the 28th six of the match - a record for ODIs in England"

<b>timbaaaaaahhhh!</b> Taylor fails to pick Rashid's googly and is bowled off his pad. Three for Rashid and the end if nigh for West Indies
"flighted, the googly again, spinning away from the left-handed No. 11, into the gloves"
"pushed through, a flatish slider outside off, again past the bat"
