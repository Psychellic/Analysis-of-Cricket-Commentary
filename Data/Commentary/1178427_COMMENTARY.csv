"<b>golden arm Rana puts another one in his book!</b> Oh boy. Short ball, proper log-hop at an off stump line. Gets deep in the crease and looks to pull this over midwicket. But for one, this ground has big square boundaries, and two, he's lost his shape as this comes on a little slower than he expects. Dragged straight to the fielder.

No it's not  direct hit, Narine's got his hands in a mess but he's got enough hand on the ball as it hits the stumps before his follow through takes the rest of it. <b>Agarwal is gone.</b> It was a full ball outside off, flicked between long-on and deep midwicket and the throw was right on top of the stumps.

<b>pulled over the bowler!</b> Stunning shot. Short of a length and cramping him at the body. He gets deep in the crease but there's too much pace for him to go into the leg side with this. So he stays put and hammers it straight over Chawla
"length on off stump, dropped into the covers with soft hands"
short of a length and skidding on too quickly for him to get this pull away. Mistimed bunt into the leg side

"slower ball at leg stump, backs away to whip it. Taps it into the off stump because he's cramped"
"length on leg stump, nudged to short fine's left"

"full on middle stump, driven inside-out, uppishly to long-off's right"
"<b>dropped!</b> Rinku Singh at long-on! He's been their best fielder this second half of the tournament but has put down a complete sitter. Full ball on middle stump, looks for the slog but this time it rips away quick. He slices it. rinku is under it, has time. But it pops out"
"length on leg stump, flicked into the square leg region"
"<b>to Rinku's left</b> at long-on. Curran digs the dagger deeper. Length at middle, clears the front leg and heaves. One bounce and over the line as two fielders look to converge on it"
"yorker at off stump, exposes his stumps and jams it through cover"
"slower short ball at middle stump, pulls into the floor, out to deep square"
"<b>held at extra cover.</b> Gurney with the offcutter. Short of a length in the corridor. Makes room and tries to slap it over mid-off. Decent plan. But a better one from Gurney. No pace on it, gets it off the toe-end. Uthappa pedals backwards and takes it just past the edge of the circle"
"full outside off, slugged down to long-on off the inside half"

"length at leg stump, looks to flick and gets a deflection to third man off the front pad"
<b>oh smart.</b> Expects the slower ball dug into the pitch. Walks into the off side - does it late. Russell can't adjust. His slower ball in the corridor is slapped to the fine leg boundary
"<b>smart again!</b> Curran has figured batting out tonight, for sure. Now he stays deep in the crease, waits for the full one. It arrives and he's in position to club it over the bowler"
"slower short ball outside off, looks to pull, gets it off the toe-end to long-on"
bouncer. Looks to hook but is too slow on it. Sails through to Karthik
"yorker, regular pace, at middle stump. Whips across this and gets it to deep square's right"
"full and wide outside off this time. Steps into the off side and looks to slog this. Off the thick inside edge to deep square's right. Comes back for the second, puts in a slide, and survives the run-out call"
<b>crunched over extra cover!</b> Gurney switches it up from a plan that seemed to be working. And he bowls an overpitched ball with a lot of width outside off. Curran camps in the crease and drills this on the bounce into the advertising boards
<b>91 metres!</b> What. An. Innings. Slower ball from Gurney and overpitched again. Curran is all over him. Waits on it to loop down and spanks it far over the long-on boundary
"<b>fifty!</b> There it is again, Curran's unreal calm and wisdom. He's so young, and so is his career, but he just seems to be in full control of these situations. Gets his weight into the off side, gets behind the line and ramps this full ball fine"
"<b>and finishes with four as well!</b> Gurney has missed the yorker every time this over, but you've got to believe Curran has done that to him. He's basically made him bowl wherever he wants it. This is overpitched and at the stumps. He shuffles into the off side again and drags this to the long leg boundary"

"down the wicket, and whacks this over midwicket. <strong>Well struck!</strong> Seemed to have pre-meditated it a touch, and Arshdeep fed him the short ball he was anticipating. Not fast enough, I'm afraid..."

"length, a bit of width, and he slashes this away towards backward point"

"length ball, and he presses forward to punch this towards midwicket. Plays it gently enough to pick up a single"
"fuller ball, and he punches this hard down the ground. It bounces off the ground over Shami, but R Ashwin does well at mid off to get across to stop it and keep it down to one"
"short, and he slaps this hard back towards mid off, but it travels quickly to the Kings XI captain. No possibility of getting any runs here"
"fuller ball, and he looks to go down the ground. Gets an inside edge on to his leg, and it lands right at his feet"

"full ball, and <strong>drilled down the ground</strong> past mid off"
"short ball, and he gets this away towards fine leg. Not off the middle, but enough to beat Nicholas Pooran behind the wicket, as he desperately dives away to his left"
"slower ball, and he was looking to go hard between midwicket and backward square leg, but missed on contact. A touch off his body takes it towards short third man"

"tosses this up outside off, and he looks to go down the ground. Outside edge again, and it flies off towards short third man, but lands short"
"full toss, on the pads, and he whips this away towards deep midwicket. Will pick up two, as the sweeper has some work to do there"

"short, and he has top-edged this. It goes up, and <strong>Tye picks up the return catch!</strong> Could this be a turning point of sorts? This over had already produced 15, but Lynn wanted to maximise the last ball of the Powerplay, and paid the price in the process"
"length, turns into him after pitching on leg, and he goes back and eases this towards deep midwicket"

"length outside off, chopped to extra cover's left"

full and wide outside off. Chucks his hands at this and is beaten
bouncer at an off stump line. Ducks under it
"<b>dropped!</b> And he might have tipped it into the boundary padding too! Mayank at long-off. Full ball outside off, gets low and drills it flat. He's inside by quite a bit and gets his hands on this, but it floats and lands on the padding. Oh boy"
"length at leg stump, nudged down to fine leg with the angle"
""
