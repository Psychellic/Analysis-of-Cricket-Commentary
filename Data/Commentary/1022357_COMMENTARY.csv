"length ball, shaping in and then straightening a fraction, Royt defends with bat next to pad... Concerted appeal from Southee, asking whether it hit pad first, which it probably did - but outside off, I think"
"lovely line, draws Roy out and suckers him past the outside edge. Southee on the money already"
"angled in on a good length, 136kph/84mph and prodded back towards mid-on"
"jumps wide on the crease, fired in slightly short, Roy misses an attempted whip off his hips"
"pitched up and crunched through cover - class dismissed! Does that mean school's out for Roy? It'll certainly make him feel better, good stride forward and right out of the screws"
"length ball, back on off stump, Roy shows it a straight bat in defence"
"starts on a tight line and a good length, defended shuffling across"
"wifth from Boult and Hales cashes that cheque, uses his reach to hammer a cut away through point for his first runs"
presses forward to defend on off stump
"oof, that's hooped in, thuds into the back pad... inside edge? Yes, looks like it, Hales saved after a flat-footed prod"
"on the stumps, Boult curving the ball in from over the wicket, turned to the leg side"
"sliding across and there's room for Hales to swing the arms and punch into the covers again, although cover prevents it getting away for more than a single"
"Southee arrows the ball in, too straight and helped off the pads away through midwicket for a few more"
pitched up and pushed back to the bowler coming forwards
"nibbly length ball, hits the inside edge as Roy plays away from his body, runs to square leg"
"cross-seam delivery from Southee, outside off and punched on the up, finds cover"
comes across and defends on off stump
"walks across on off, touch short from Southee and Roy practically turns to face square leg as he shovels it away for a couple"
"slightly short of a length, Hales defends"
"length, fired in at off stump, Hales blocks towards cover"
"full outside off, that swing already seems to have disappeared and Hales plugs a couple through point"
"drops short, Hales swivels and bludgeons malevolently away over square leg... all the way, hitting with the wind, England's first six!"
banged in even shorter and Hales doesn't take this one on
"back over the wicket, nippy lifter from Boult, beats the top edge as Hales has another yahoo at him, Ronchi leaps to cling on one-handed and prevent byes"
"touch short of a length, 132kph/82mph, hits Roy on the thigh pad as he walks down and flicks to leg"
"short ball on off, sits up for a controlled pull through the leg side"
"that's a decent yorker from Southee, up in the blockhole, Hales drops his bat on it in time"
"short ball, zips through as Hales attempts to pull and fails to connect"
"slower ball, dipping on middle and turned to the leg side"
"another lbw shout from Southee... but heading down the leg side? It raced on and beat Hales past the inside edge, but looked a tad optimistic"
"full and straight, pushed back towards the bowler, who grabs it in his follow through"
"good length, tapped into the off side"
"short and Roy goes to pull, through the shot early and it comes of the toe of the bat towards point"
"full, outside off but Roy had stepped across early, plays a whippy, bottom-handed drive, powerfully struck but Boult sticks out a hand in his follow through and manages to stop it as he goes to ground"
"angled across, goes on to the back foot now and dabs one to third man"
"overpitched, in the channel outside off and Hales blaps it through point, won't quite go all the way"
"diligent lines from Southee, prodded back to the bowler"
"slower ball, cutting his fingers over it, Hales flubs it into the off side"
"Southee drops short, heading slightly leg side and Hales flinches under it"
"width on offer and that's flayed over point, bounces away to the untended boundary rope"
"off we go again... Line and length, 134kph/83mph and delivered in a mesmeric blur, Hales prods to cover"
"short, wide, gentle paced - but Hales only succeeds in chopping it straight to backward point"
"length ball, rising around off stump, tapped into a gap in the covers"
"good wheels, 140kph/87mph outside off, Hales again plays it softly in front of square for one"
"fuller, outside off and steered along the carpet to backward point"
"steps across outside off stump before the ball is released, Milne goes wider but he's too full and Roy uses the pace on the ball with a judicious crump past mid-off for four"
"fullish, not quite so into the ball this time, plinked to mid-off"
"bowled him behind the legs! Milne strikes, NZ have their first wicket and it's unlucky 13 for Roy... Again he walked across, exposing his stumps, Milne fired the ball in quick and straight in response and Roy was beaten, via a brush of the pad, aiming a flick over the leg side"
"angled in, dabbed into a gap for a single"
"length, Root comes across on off stump and pushes his first ball square"
"back of a length, room for Root to swish those marionette arms, beats the dive of backward point for a couple"
touch short outside off and Root taps this down towards point
"sits on the back foot, poked square on the off side once again"
"touch full, walks across and works through midwicket for one more"
"shortish, poked wide of mid-off for another single"
"short again and this time Hales carves up and over midwicket, doesn't quite outrun Williamson to the deep midwicket boundary"
"width, in the channel and Root throws the hands, thick-edged to third man"
"ooh, nearly catches him in flagrante delicto as Hales fiddles outside off, beats the outside edge"
shuffles across and pats the ball square
"pace from Milne, as the speed gun clocks 148kph/92mph, but Hales response is fast hands and steel nerves, as he creams a bottom-handed mow over midwicket and away for four"
"round the wicket, angled in full, Root punches through mid-on"
"some nibble-dobble off the pitch, gets Hales feeling for it and a thick edge loops through a gap in the covers... not intended but Hales gets one"
"fullish, whipped off the pads in front of midwicket"
"short and slightly leg side, Hales swats at it and gets a bottom edge fine for a couple"
"length ball, 131kph/80mph on off, defended"
"short ball, slightly leg side, pulled down through backward square"
tossed up outside off stump and met cautiously on the front foot
"touch shorter, Hales drops back and pokes in front of square, they have to hustle as the throw comes in front cover but he gets in at the non-striker's end"
"floated up, goes on rather than turning and clips the inside edge"
"flighted, Root gets well forward to the pitch to stroke one through the covers"
"tossed up, slightly wide and Hales cuts vigorously through point, there's cover in the deep"
"angled in on middle and leg, not too much grip on offer, slides on as Root clips down the ground"
"Root drops back in the crease, waits and flicks off his pads through square"
"shorter length, defended on off stump"
"dug in and Hales whirls his arms up through a helicopter swat through backward square leg, just gets one"
"full length, tailing in and poked to mid-on"
"pitched up wide of the stumps, Root swings aggressively through the line, one more to the cover sweeper"
"on the stumps, Hales works it away through midwicket - five more singles for England, flicking through their options on Tinder"
"flighted, dipping as Hales pushes forward, in the air but out of Santner's reach diving to his left"
angled in on the stumps and tapped away defensively
"clean swing, into the crowd! Root launches Santner down the ground for the second six of the innings"
"pushed through flatter outside off, driven for one through cover"
"flat outside off, Hales swats a single off the back foot"
"tossed up wide of the stumps, stabbed square on the drive"
gets forward and punched towards mid-off... where Williamson misfields and they get one
Root dances nimbly across and punches in front of square
"length delivery on off, moves across and tucks towards midwicket"
"pushed down the leg side, flick and a miss but they get the extra"
"short outside off, maybe a slower ball, left alone by Hales"
"Anderson still hitting the middle of the pitch, trying to stop England going straight, Hales pulls a single"
"touch back of a length, Root goes deep in the crease and swishes through backward square"
looped up outside off and Root is down early to paddle a sweep through the leg side
pushed through wide of off and Hales goes back to chop through point
"low full toss, that's not going to bring the close fielders into play, swatted through point for a couple more"
"flighted, dipping on the stumps, bumped into the turf on the leg side"
"flat on the stumps, worked away through midwicket"
"tossed up outside off, Hales swings hard through a sweep but only gets one to deep square leg"
"wicket-to-wicket delivery, Hales hangs back in the crease and punches to the on-side"
solid block on an off-stump line
"this is a tidy over, a very restrictive line and length, allowing no width, and no opportunity to plant the front foot and tonk it. Hales blocks from the crease"
bouncer. Well directed. Smart cricket
"tries to whip it away, but inside-edges onto the pad"
"short, but too leg-sided this time. A maiden ruined!"
"smacked off the eyebrows, in front of square"
"bang! Two steps down the track, walloped high and handsome over long-on. That'll do"
stabbed into the covers with an urgent shuffle at the crease
"tossed up, and driven hard into the midriff of short cover"
"pressed down the ground, not over-committing on the drive"
"paddle-swept, cashing in on an off-line delivery. Shot"
clipped languidly to midwicket. Root is starting to flow now
pushed into the covers
"too short, and good aggressive intent from Hales, swinging his levers through the line of the ball and picking out the midwicket sweeper with a roll of the wrists"
through to the keeper
"full length outside off, met with a solid back-foot drive but Broom at point sweeps up"
"languid once again, drilled out towards the point boundary"
no way through there
"edged, but safe. Run down through third man and there's no cutting that off. Good delivery, but it's a cruel game"
pushed into the covers
"on the back foot, dabbed down into the crease"
"angled bat from deep in the crease, beats Broom at backward point this time"
pushed firmly to short cover
"a bit loose from Hales, aiming something ambitious over the leg side, and misses both the edge of bat and off stump"
"too much width, and slammed through backward point. That's tremendous power, placement and timing"
drilled out to point and squeezes through the fielder for a freebie single
"hoisted off the pads, down to backward square, and that is Hales' fifth fifty in eight matches. He's in the sort of form that Roy would sorely love to rediscover"
another flick to another leg-sided delivery. England ticking over nicely here
"banged in short, too short"
"zoinks! That was a wallop and a half! Cleared the front dog, woofed his bat through the line, and dumped a massive blow over long-off!"
"well, there's a riposte and a half! Hales was sitting back, expecting the short ball, but instead he's done in by a bail-trimmer - squared up on the crease, bat going nowhere. The end of a fine and threatening innings. Good breakthrough from Milne"
outswinger from back of a length. Root has a swish but misses
wandering across the crease to clip a single to leg
nudged into the leg side
"through to the keeper, that's a fine line, angling into the left-hander's off stump. Morgan plays inside the line"
pounded high and hard over the covers and away to the rope. Shot
solid block from deep in the crease. A loud and commanding 'no!' from the skipper
punched on the up into the covers
"on the toes, chipped to square leg"
tapped into the covers
"yorker. Good late inswing, but well watched and dug out"
tight line once again
nudged into the gap
"angled into the left-hander, pushed to the covers"
"good attacking line, probing the off stump and demanding compact defence"
an ambitious pull through the leg-side... Boult rampages in in his followthrough to tidy up as the ball bobbles down into the crease
"too straight this time, and Morgan's reply is even straighter. A sweet punch down the ground that might have made it to the boundary had it not puffed straight through the pile of sawdust at the top of the bowler's mark"
"too short, and hauled through the leg side. Well timed, stayed tall, and away she flies"
"short again, another good connection from Morgan as he leans into the pull"
"full length, probing length. Root removes his bottom hand as he leans forward to defend"
forward and pushed down the ground
"edged and gone! A slightly low-key departure, as Morgan gallops down the track, was forced to reach for his drive as Anderson dangled it out wide, and up went the finger for a feather to the keeper"
"outside off, a circumspect leave to launch Stokes' innings"
"too wide this time. Bruce Oxenford spreads his arms wide, his Millennium Falcon-esque shield glinting in the damp"
tighter line
another leave as Stokes takes his time to calibrate his innings
"round the wicket, defended back down the pitch"
"punched off the back foot past the bowler, and there is another fine fifty from the classy Joe Root"
"round the wicket, tapped down the pitch"
"a couple of strides out of the crease, pushed to short cover"
"a dinky little flick over the shoulder, and that rattles away across the moist turf. A very short straight boundary, and Taylor's valiant slide can't quite haul it in"
"onto the front foot this time, and punched hard into the covers"
another calmly poached single
"hanging it out there, on a sixth-stump line. Stokes still won't be tempted to have a swing"
"a fraction tighter to the body, Stokes connects well with a push to short cover"
"props onto the front foot, pushes into the covers"
"that's the one he's been waiting for! A fraction too short from Anderson, and Stokes flings his arms through the line, striding forward then leaning back to dump a lofted drive over long-on for six!"
a misfield helps Stokes to steal the strike
"banged in short, Stokes ducks"
"back of a length, defended into the off side"
"onto the front foot, pumped through the line. Shot"
back on a solid line and length
"attempted nurdle off the hip, doesn't get full contact"
"leg-sided, an easy deflection down to backward square"
"on the pads, dinked square, and Root rushes back for the second"
"whittled into the leg-side, another excellently paced shot, taking advantage of the deep-set 6-3 field to jog back for two"
"once again, a flip into the leg-side, easy pickings from the calm and calculated Root"
forward and defended
forward and picked up by the toes in Anderson's followthrough
"another firm strike, clipped hard down to the long-on sweeper. England are controlling the pace of these middle overs very effectively at present"
left alone once again. Stokes is playing the long game at present
solidly into line
"a firm straight drive, clatters into the stumps, and did that brush the bowler's fingers? It did, and they are having a look for the run-out ... but Root this time is home. He was done in that manner at the Ageas Bowl against SA last week"
"flogged! Stokes has had enough of being circumspect, and charges out of his ground like an angry farmer chasing Theresa May out of his cornfield. Clean through long-off"
"fuller length, blocked"
attempted glide through third man
"attempted mow through the leg side. Misses out for a change, as the ball skids through, past the off stump"
"same stroke, better connection, but luckily for him, he cloths it out to deep midwicket, where the fielder would have pocketed a fuller-blooded shot"
slapped to long-on
"outside off, angled across the left-hander, misses out with a swish"
"outside off, tries to hit on the up through the covers but doesn't make full contact"
"tight line again, Stokes ignores the basics of footwork, and clips hard into the leg-side"
defended on the back foot
"that's powerfully struck. Too full, floated under the eyeline, but bombastically punched along the ground through the covers, right under the eyes"
"clipped off the toes, out to midwicket"
squeezed out to point
"a pre-meditated stride down the pitch, held back a touch, and fenced round the corner to backward square"
"short and wide, slapped on the up through third man where a valiant tumble cuts off the four"
"slower ball, and a rather muffed one at that. Dribbles down the leg side"
"another slower ball, hauled into the leg side"
"smashed out to point where Broom intercepts superbly with one hand, leaving Root stranded at the non-striker's end. A direct hit would have been curtains, but it was well wide"
pushed into the off side
"crunched down to third man, Stokes freeing his arms at a bit of width"
wide and once again Stokes misses out with a swish. A few too many dot-balls in Stokes' innings so far
"aiming wide, a clever ploy. Stokes toe-ends a single to backward point"
plinked down the ground! Who needs singles when you clear the ropes at will? In the slot and hoisted over the ropes
"back of a length, dabbed past the bowler and a single this time"
"dragged on! That's a big blow, and the product of Root's failure to get enough of the strike in recent overs. A flat-footed carve, aiming through the off-side, and instead taking out his own poles to send the zing-bails into ecstasy"
"woof, nearly a plumb lbw shout first ball, shaping in as Buttler comes down and flicks to leg, gets a bottom edge on it to divert one behind square"
"in the channel, teasing Stokes to come out flaying, no stroke this time"
"good length, top of off stump and diverted into the leg side"
"rising off a length outside off, steered through point from the crease"
"pitched up, in the Stokes crucible but he sends a rasping drive along the slick surface to mid-on"
"length, angled across towards the tramlines again, Stokes chases it and gets a thick top edge over backward point, wide of third man for a couple"
"full, under the eyeline, this time Stokes nails it to the wall, a crisp straight drive giving mid-off no chance"
"on the stumps, flicked through backward square leg, again they hare back for two"
"short ball, sits up and Stokes crashes a punishing pull... straight to the man at midwicket, who had just been moved there"
"round the wicket, floated up and paddled gently down to fine leg"
"stays round the wicket to the lefty, tossed up on leg stump and clipped to backwards square"
"flighted, dipping as Stokes comes froward and drives down the ground to long-on"
"gives this some air, Buttler attempts to cart him downtown but manages to skew it flat towards long-on"
"pushed through on the pads, can't nurdle this one away"
tossed up and clipped through midwicket for another single - no gifts from Santner Claws in that over
"length ball, fired across wide of off stump, Stokes wrinkles his nose and frowns like a cat offered pet food when he wants fresh mackerel"
"Stokes starts to advance, Milne goes very wide again, manages to toe end one to long-off"
"dug in very short, climbing over the ducking Buttler - called on height, to cheers from the crowd"
"moves across on off stump, defended back down the track"
"short ball, pulled flat through square leg and they get back for a second"
stays back in the crease and flicks into the leg side for a couple more
"banged in short, 145kph from Milne but Buttler is into position to swat a single down to fine leg"
"back of a length on the stumps, Buttler attempts to bring out his favoured ramp... but fails to connect"
"angled across, Buttler opens his shoulders and pushes through cover point"
"short ball, Stokes rocks back to uppercut... but he doesn't get it cleanly and the ball loops tamely to third man jogging in! Another wicket goes down when England needed him to go on, NZ keeping a handle on the innings, despite damp conditions and a slippery ball"
"full, tailing in late, nearly does for Moeen but he manages to get his bat down and squeeze it out to the leg side"
"bangs in another short ball, Buttler lets it go"
"another bumper, only shoulder height and swatted to square leg on the pull"
"on the stumps, maybe a slower ball, Buttler waits and paddles behind square"
"angled in from over the wicket, nudged away through backward square leg"
"pitched up on the stumps, Buttler clips the ball fine and they get back for two"
"dug in, rolling his fingers over the cutter, Buttler is on it early and can only pull one down into the leg side"
"cross-seam, deceives Moeen and he thin-edges through to the keeper on the bounce"
pitched up and punched towards mid-off coming forwards
"short ball, drops back and cuts, bobbles into the covers for one"
"Boult hits the middle of the pitch again, Moeen swirls one through backward square leg"
"fuller, wide of the stumps, gets a thick outside edge behind point"
"full outside off, Moeen pushes back down the track"
"pitched up, again he's across to drive but sends it along the turf to mid-off"
"short ball, Moeen swings it into the leg side, in the air but bounces short of Santner coming in off the rope"
"that won't help, wide of the tramlines as Moeen stretches for it"
"smoked! Moeen gets agricultural with a muscular thwack over midwicket, not quite middled but enough to clear the rope"
"opens up and trashes over the covers this time, in front of the man in the deep"
"<i>brilliant</i> catch from Boult! Moeen is gone after a typically ephemeral contribution, though it took a superb bit of fielding to send him on his way as he connected with a pull, it flew towards short fine leg, where Boult threw himself to his left and grabbed it two-handed"
"attempts to go full and straight but it's a touch leg side and deflects off Rashid's pad, past the keeper and away, leg byes rather than off the bat"
on the stumps and worked away for a couple through square leg
Rashid leans into a forward block
pushed through outside off and Buttler slices a couple through backward point
tossed up and pushed back down the track
"wide of the tramlines, Buttler knows it and doesn't make the effort"
comes forward and taps to the bowler
"floated up, full on off stump and Buttler digs it out towards cover, who misfields the greasy pill to give them one"
"length ball, this grips a little, hits the outer half of the bat and runs to backward point"
"pushed through quicker, not turning and defended on off"
short ball to start with and Buttler pulls through midwicket to the sweeper
"in the channel outside off, Rashid goes back and dabs one to third man"
"dug in and Buttler swings across the line, in the air through square leg and it slip and scuttles away for a couple"
"another bumper, Buttler gets it away over the keeper for four... No top edge, that came off the helmet, but it will go down as runs. Buttler's first boundary, even though it shouldn't be"
"back of a length, worked away for"
"pitched up and driven down the ground to long-off, bringing up the England 250"
"nicely struck, tossed up and driven firmly inside out, deep cover has to scramble round but does well to keep them to one"
pushed through outside off and stabbed square on the off side
"now that's well played, rubbery, wristy stuff from Rashid as he drops back on off stump and dabs late and fine and it scoots away off the wet surface, beating the dive of the fielder"
"another sui generis shot from Rashid, breaking the wrists on a square drive that fades behind deep point for three"
tossed up and punched through the covers coming forwards
"revenge for Santner, who skids the ball through Rashid to hit the back leg... he <b>reviews</b> but that looked pretty plumb. Yep, no bat involved and that's hitting middle two inches from the top. So that's the DRS spin used up, with six more overs to bat and 300 looking a distant target"
"short outside off, Buttler whirls the hands up to pull but miscues into the off side"
"and we have another <b>review</b>, as Buttller sends the ball to Ronchi - looked off the arm to me. They take an age to determine what seemed fairly obvious to the naked eye (except the bowler, Southee), Rod Tucker keen to investigate a tiny murmur on Ultra Edge before deciding to stay with the on-field call"
"dug in short, Buttler connects properly with the pull this time, single through midwicket"
"full length, sliding on to the legs, Plunkett squeezes his first run behind square"
"dug in, slower-ball bouncer, high over the ducking batsman - wide on height, much to Southeee's disgust"
"that's a genuine boundary for Buttler, who latches on to another bouncer and swats it Federer style past deep backward square's despairing dive"
"hits the middle of the pitch, swivelled through midwicket for one more to keep the strike"
"goes very full and wide of the stumps, Buttler chops down on it, gets an edge before it bounces through to Ronchi"
comes across on off and spears a couple in front of deep cover sweeper
"excellent bowling, angled across full, right up on the crease and Buttler can only jam it into the ground, Boult swoops in his follow through"
"goes short now, Buttler unfurls the uppercut - but fails to connect"
"astonishing! Buttler has ramped this out of the ground! Moving back and across early, he anticipated another short ball and scooped it with the wind, nearly taking out the cameraman on the gantry at the River Taff End. Stick a flake in that!"
on the stumps and worked across the line into the leg side for a couple more
"short delivery, top-edged on the pull but it lands safely short of fine leg"
"oof, takes this on the body, short and nasty and they have to settle for a leg bye"
"Milne hammers the pitch, 142kph and <i>smashed</i> through midwicket by Plunkett, all blacksmith muscle and it beats the man in the deep"
"short again, swatted away to the leg side"
"Milne bounces away, goes for the ramp again - but misses"
"brutal, hammered with a flat bat over long-off! Buttler's innovative genius to the fore again as he steps away and mows Milne down the ground for another six!"
"on the stumps, swings to leg and deflects it back down the ground"
comes forward and slugs a full toss through mid-off
"aims full and wide of the wicket, Buttler tries a sort of reverse-scoop but fails to connect"
"pitched up and chopped into the ground, they hustle through for one"
another valuable dot ball as Plunkett swings and misses at a full ball in the channel
gets forward and drills one through mid-off - but that's an excellent over from Boult
"walloped over deep backward square, Plunkett gets in on the action! Milne continues to go short and the No. 9 just flails it up and over his shoulder into the boards once more - bringing up England's 300 in style!"
"sprayed wide on the off side, Ronchi has to scramble across and they run another, too"
"short stuff, swung away into the leg side, they hurtle back for a second"
more chin music but Buttler doesn't have a glass jaw and he smears a couple more in front of deep midwicket
"backs away and pulls through square leg, again they get back for two"
"Buttler backs away, Milne follows him, shovelled into the leg side"
"this time Plunkett perishes trying to swing for the hills! Milne hits the middle of the pitch again, top-edged on the pull and although it swirls in the wind, mid-on clings on"
"back of a length, Buttler swats a pull back past the bowler for one"
"gone first ball, sliced to cover! Wood was backing away and miscued a shortish ball off the splice, straight to the fielder and they had no chance of getting Buttler back on strike, either"
"out, superbly taken by Boult! Ball turned away and fended into the leg side, Boult sprinted to his right from square leg and leapt to snag it full length! So Southee finishes it with two in two, England are bolwed out, Buttler won't get back on strike... but it's still a handy total"
"a bit of width outside off, but Morgan sets the standard in the field with a sprawling intercept in the covers"
"tight line, blocked back down the track"
a lively appeal as the ball is inside-edged down into the crease. Roy hurtles in from backward point and slips on the greasy surface as Guptill gets off the mark
nut! Nipping back through the gate with Ronchi's feet stuck in clay! Fizzes through his limp defences to pluck out the top of middle!
"solidly onto the front foot, and blocked"
"well bowled again, nipping away from a middle-and-off line to take a spliced edge to the gully"
tapped into the covers for a quick single
"up on the toes, fenced to cover"
hitting the deck hard outside off stump. Williamson stands tall on the back foot to defend
"cover is back in business again as Wood hits his groove, back of a length outside off stump"
great tight restrictive bowling. Through to the keeper
fenced into the gap to open the skipper's account
good tight line once again
worked into the leg side
attacking the splice on the back foot
a good smooth rhythm
pushed back into the crease to defend to cover
"tapped into the leg side, from deep in the crease"
"the mid-pitch length worked well for New Zealand, and so far it's working for England's quicks"
"up on the toes, that's well timed into the covers"
defended once again
"good lift from an awkward length and edged, but safely through the vacant third slip - he's bowling well, but this ain't no Test match"
pounded onto that trampoline length outside off. Punched to cover
"good movement off the seam, jags back through Williamson's defences, and over the top of the stumps. Well bowled"
"a little bit of movement from an awkward length, and deflects away. No liberties being taken"
"fuller length, driven but not timed"
"driven, not quite to the pitch of the ball, and that hangs in the air for a while before midwicket gathers on the half-volley"
pushed into the covers. Ball looked the spitting image of Phil DeFreitas's scrunched-up run-up face then as he crested the breeze
"well bowled again, keeping it tight and simple"
"just a fraction shorter. Williamson upper-cuts hungrily, trying to force more width onto the ball than actually existed. A slight misfield denies Ball his maiden"
"in the channel outside off, another attempted back-foot punch, but not timed"
crashed into the covers
"tip and run. Plunkett in the covers has two stumps to aim at, and a direct hit would have been close ..."
"outside off, hangs in the breeze and nibbles away as Guptill pushes a touch uncertainty"
"tapped back down the pitch, deflects off the stumps and away to no-man's land to make for a simple single"
"well bowled... fuller length, tempting an indiscretion as Williamson flashes loosely"
"that is a sweet shot. Marginally over-pitched, and Guptill leans into a perfect on-drive. Tough shot to perfect, but that whistled"
nudged to leg
"angled into the stumps, deflected to the cordon"
"width, that would have been a wide had he left it, but instead it's a chopped single down to third man"
"that's better for New Zealand. A slashing cut to a hint of width. And with two fours in the over, the score is looking healthier now"
"wowsers. What did that miss? A whistling inducker, that zipped under the bat and over the bails. Sharp"
"hitting the deck hard, attacking the splice. Not a lot New Zealand can do but ride out this threat"
clipped to midwicket
"props forward, angled defence to third man"
rides the bounce once again to pick off another single to third man
"flicked up and over the leg-side. Wood holds his head, in slight dismay that Hales couldn't intercept at midwicket. But that was well past him"
"back on that off-side, deck-hitting line. Cover cleans up"
that's lovely batting. Starting to pick off the width on offer as Ball bangs out his back-of-a-length line. Powerfully pumped through the covers
played on the up into the leg-side
"attempted steer to third man, mixing it up a bit"
"gives himself room for a wipe across the line. Under-edged, but good intent"
patted back to the bowler
tremendous timing once again. Handing the pace straight back to the bowler with a well-placed pump down the ground
clocked into the covers
worked into the gap
opens the face in an attempt to glide a single through third man. Stokes is on hand to intercept
pushed on the up to mid-on. A touch airborne
"outside off again, no way through England's ring of steel in the covers"
another perfect line-and-length delivery to join the dots. New Zealand are being made to play the waiting game
"outside off, flogged through the covers"
Williamson content to deal in singles while England's seamers are on top
"Plunkett quickly picking up the cues from his new-ball team-mates, hammering that awkward back-of-a-length length"
"a quick single into the covers, and an extra run as the ball ricochets off the stumps"
"awkward length again, fenced to cover"
"rides the bounce, picked up in the covers, and Guptill has to scarper back to his crease as the fielder swoops in"
good line and length to launch his spell

a fraction over-pitched and sweetly driven. But the cover sweeper limits the damage
"outside off, attempted glide to third man, but just goes on with the arm"
opens the face with a firm drive into the covers
"wider on the crease, angled into the top of off stump. Fenced into the off side"
"flips off the pads, out to deep midwicket"
"deflected to third man. New Zealand settling for ones and twos, tough going out there"
"round the wicket, flicked to the leg side"
"flashes outside off, and Root so nearly gets his mitts under the ball at an unorthodox flfth slip. And talking of which, his foot slipped as he went for the ball"
"that is a snorting bouncer! Skidded towards Guptill's lid, skimmed the shoulder, and fizzed over the keeper! If you're going to give away byes, that's the way to do it!"
more awkward lift from a full length
"on the toes, worked to the leg side"
"short, slammed through mid-on. That was loose"
"here comes Golden Arm! Hanging back in the crease, not in position to drive the fuller length, and Root is on hand at fifth slip to snaffle the edge!"
short ball to welcome Taylor to the crease. FIzzes past his flinching torso
"in the slot for the drive, but cover tidies up"
"attacking the off stump, stoutly defended"
thumps that good length outside off
"ducks into a short one! A sickening thud in the side of his helmet, but he's fine. Took his eyes off the ball and he's taking a moment to compose himself, as well he might"
"resumes by hitting a short length, naturally, and Williamson flips it safely away in the air through square leg"
"woof, that has jack-in-the-boxed off a length... Not sure if that hit Taylor on the glove, chest or helmet grille, but it was another snorter, signs that the pitch is becoming more up and down. Taylor was pushing forward and was left whistling through pursed lips, thankful for his protective gear"
shortish and left alone outside off stump
"banged on a length and this leaps up as well, hits the outside edge and runs to gully... but he kept it down"
pitched up and prodded into the covers coming forwards
"length on off, wristily flicked across the line moving on to off stump, one behind square"
"full and Taylor steps smoothly into a drive, Stokes throws himself to the ground to stop it in his follow through"

touch too straight from Stokes and Taylor clips his first run off his pads
"full outside off, Williamson leans into a neatly place cover drive for a couple into the deep"
"dug in short, rising sharply and left alone"
"fullish and shaping in on the stumps, nudged towards mid-on, who's in quickly"

"flighted, Taylor comes forward on off, punches to the left of the bowler, one to long-off"
"ooh, close, Williamson <i>just</i> clearing Rashid as he comes down the pitch and dinks one back over the bowler, not quite what he was aiming to do, I fancy, but gets away with it"
"tossed up on middle and leg, Taylor's down early and paddles fine, in the air for a bit but they get a couple"
"flatter, this is the slider, going on towards off stump, defended"
"tossed up outside off, Taylor drops back and cuts towards backward point"
"short and at the body, shuffles across and works behind square, back for a second"
"dug in, another well-direct bouncer... which Williamson has managed to deflect for four off the back of the bat. Well, that's some sort of genius. Although he was technically trying to leave"
comes across and defends with a straight bat
"short and Williamson attempts to lasso it through the leg side and ends up playing around it, chides himself for the false shot"
back of a length on the stumps and clipped into a leg-side gap for a couple more

"pitched up, 129kph/80mph in the channel outside off, driven to the cover sweeper"
"comes across on off stump, tucked down the ground with an on-drive - that's the Williamson fifty, politely applauded. Can he be the first batsman in this game to properly go on?"
"fullish, bunted back towards mid-off"
"goes full and straight, dug out back past the bowler for a single"
Stokes slings down a bouncy bouncer. Too bouncy for the umpires
"touch short, Stokes bowling within himself here, 125kph and Williamson punches off the back foot to extra cover"
"angled in and nibbling a little, blocked to the on side - just four off the over, NZ happy to build methodically"
tossed up on the stumps and pushed back down the track
drifts a little straighter and Taylor can't quite work it away to the leg side
"skips down and attacks the googly, not quite middled but he clears the leaping mid-on and it races away for four"

"pushed through outside off, dabbed towards backward point for one"
floated up full on the stumps and pushed down the ground for one
"Williamson goes aerial, swatting Stokes away to leg, high and out towards the boundary rope, it <i>just</i> evades deep midwicket running across and then bounces to the fence"

"short of a length outside off, goes back and runs one to third man"
"Stokes attacks the stumps, met with a straight bat in defence"
"short and pulled in the air over square leg, he'd got into position early and placed it masterfully - the KW2000 batting algorithm in excellent working order"
"moves across and this time he's struck on the pads, Stokes is keen once again - but Oxenford thinks it is missing leg stump and he's right"

"short ball, dropped down towards his toes and there's another single there"
"fullish length, 137kph/85mph and glided down to third man with an open face"
"now, another one spits off a length, giving Taylor something awkward to deal with once again, a thick edge, off the shoulder of the bat, loops into the off side... but it's too far to the left of cover and he survives"
tossed up on the stumps and nurdled for one

"got him, huge wicket! Ripping ball from Wood, takes the glove and Buttler snaffles it!

hopping back and across to work another single off the toes to square leg

"nurdled into the leg side, they hustle back for the second"

tossed up
"biffed on the up through the covers, well struck, but can't beat the ring of sweepers"
poked out to point
"big sweep at a regulation legspinner, misses it entirely and up goes the finger. There's a slight chance it did too much and could be missing off, but it's a roll of the dice as Broom <strong>reviews </strong>. Oof ... clipping the top of off, but that's all it takes. Off Broom goes"

"outside off, an attempted late dab through third man, but very tentative"
"round the wicket, attacking the stumps, patted to the off side"
"smashed high and hard, down to long-on, where Moeen gallops in but can't quite reach the catch. Bounced a foot in front of him and he did well to keep his body behind the ball and prevent the second run"
"stumped off a wide! Santner charged out of his crease, Rashid saw him coming, speared his googly out of his reach, and that's a smart gather from Buttler as he whips off the bails!"

"tight to the body, worked to the leg side"
missed pull
taps the single
"short again, pulled firmly, but only as far as deep square leg"
