<b>dropped.</b> Low full toss outside off stump from around the wicket. He lifts this with an angled bat to hit it wide of long-off. He's low on energy and this hasn't gone quickly enough.

"back of a length at off stump, walks across the stumps to try and ramp this past short fine, gets it on his thigh guard and it mighty annoyed"

"full at off stump, leans in and drives it cleanly to long-off's right"
<b>Nabi has the last laugh.</b> It's a similar line and length to the first one he bowled today. But this is slightly quicker and it skids through. Keeps low.

"back of a length outside off, looks to ramp it through third man again, beaten"
superb from Dhawan. But superb from Vohra first. This is a full ball outside off stump. He slices this expertly over point and it's bouncing away towards the square boundary there.

"Vohra keeps going. Low full toss outside off stump, completely focused as he waits for this and slices it past point with an open face. Dhawan can't get across this time"
"<b>dropped!</b> Should we switch to bold text for the rest of the night? This is back of a length outside off stump.

"finally gets one in the slot, but they <b>can't get the second.</b> This is good length at off stump, he backs away and gets bat on this thump on the up. It's to extra cover's right who puts in a hand just in time to parry it to long-off who does really well to keep it down to one"
"<b>this was coming!</b> The only explanation is that Vohra has asked him to play his shots. Bhuvi delivers the perfect yorker at leg stump. Cariappa steps out, plays all around it and loses his stumps."
"<b>Ishant brings sense to the middle, along with a grin.</b> Maintains his balance, gets behind the line of this length ball at off stump, and taps it through the covers to turn over the strike"
"<b>it's a five-for for Bhuvi!</b> And surely that's the match for Sunrisers. It has been truly special from Vohra, one of the <i>the</i> great IPL innings without a doubt. But that has masked what Bhuvi has done at the other end. Low full toss at middle stump, right in front of middle stump as he misses the flick"
"oversteps. Yorker tailing in at off stump, brings the bat down and squeezes it to long-on"
he's through the slog before this slower ball reaches him. He's in the follow through as it climbs over the off stump
"slower ball at off stump, gets behind the line and taps it into the off side"
"good length at off stump, defends off the front foot to extra cover and <b>keeps them alive for one more over</b>"
oh what a shot! These Punjab team-mates will have a lot to talk about after this! He's across the off stump and waiting on one knee. Kaul bowls a length ball and Sandeep has managed to lift it over Sran at short fine. He gives chase and nearly fumbles in his eagerness to hold on
"slower ball, outside off stump. Was that wide? Looked like it has just come back in from the marker, but it's given. He was looking to hit this over the midwicket boundary"
"back of  a length outside off stump, stands tall and punches this classily to sweeper cover"
"no, no, no, no. Not there. He looks nervous. Bowls it full and wide down the leg side"
"oh god. Low full toss at off stump, he's tapped it straight back to the bowler with a high elbow"
"<b>Kaul has shattered the off stump!</b> After all the length balls and the wides, Kaul has found the yorker. Ishant looks to slice this past point but that is too good for him. Kaul has his arms outstretched as he runs wild through the off side. He's tackled by Yuvraj Singh. It's been an all-Punjab star cast for this final phase of the game...just not the IPL franchise."
