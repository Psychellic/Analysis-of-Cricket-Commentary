"seam straight away for Bhuvi. There was a harsh spotlight on him during the limited-overs series against South Africa, with experts saying he has lost his movement. Good signs here as a good length ball darts in and raps Finch on the pads. Would have slid down leg"
"inswing, but early enough for Finch to spot and drive to mid-on"
"keeps to his crease, but tries to get tall as he attempts a backfoot punch down the ground. Mistimed as Bhuvi jags it into him again and refuses the room he would have preferred"
"loves that! The length is considerably fuller and that's what does Finch in. Despite three fifties in the lead-up to this game, the batsman is still new at the crease today and he doesn't quite feel ready to move his feet. Bhuvneshwar's inswing exploits that. Zips through bat and pad as Finch attempts an expansive drive and bowls him neck and crop"
oh shot! He is a superb player off the front foot. Especially against bowlers of Bhuvi's pace. A simple push through extra cover just races away.
"but once the ball is a touch shorter, he loses his timing. More so because of his nerves because I think he has played this flick shot way too early. No square leg is in place to pose a threat to this aerial flick"
terrible start from Sran. Plants a full one on leg stump for Raina to lift to the fine leg boundary. Leans over the ball and flicks it away with fine leg up inside the circle
a lot more finesse in the flick there. Sran got the ball to spear in from outside off. Raina held his balance and nudged the ball to the right of short fine leg
stays back and taps a shortish delivery on middle to midwicket
"a tad shortish on the pads, McCullum works it towards square leg."
"back of a length a shade outside off, Raina is forward with a block"
"nicely done. Short delivery doesn't rise too much, which means Raina can tuck it to deep square leg. Gently played and in full control of it"
"he can pick up the full ball ever so quickly. Bhuvi needs to pitch it up to get the swing, not much on offer here and Raina drills it past the bowler's right"
"back of a length on off stump, safely defused with a straight bat"
a little too straight to Raina at the moment. Strong wrists send the ball scurrying away to the square leg boundary
"on leg stump again, Raina goes for the flick hoping to get it fine but doesn't make any connection in the process"
"shortish and a shade outside off, short-arm pull to midwicket"
there's the Fizz. At short fine leg. McCullum brings him to play when he nudges a short ball off his hips
"there's his specialty. The offcutter that leave McCullum groping. Couldn't pick the variation and is beaten outside his off stump. Didn't move his feet much either, and that left him reaching for the ball, his balance totally shot."
"back of a length and skirting across the right-hander, McCullum is squared up as he tries to guide the ball to point"
"misfield at cover, from Dhawan, allows a simple single. Too full and enough width - especially with Baz clearing his front leg."
"good length ball just outside off, Raina taps the ball to mid-on and scampers. He's not committing to his strokes too early."
"ripper! This time the offcutter does McCullum for the bounce <i>and</i> deviation. He always has a cut of the wrists in his action, so it makes the slower ball so hard to pick. McCullum was stepping away to leg and pushing at the ball. It pitches and leaps past the shoulder of the blade"
seems he prefers to play Mustafizur from beside the line of the ball. McCullum steps away and pats a shortish delivery to cover
"that was a tad premeditated, I think. Perhaps the captain has recognised this is a good pitch and bowlers can be struck through the line. Raina came forward and lofts a good length ball over cover. No timing though because he had to reach too far in front of him to make the connection"
waits on the shortish delivery on middle and tucks it around the corner to fine leg
"smoked away! It's length, its on middle, its juicy for McCullum. Slogs and with his considerable might and that eye which is still sharp enough, it soars away beyond square leg"
"runs at the bowler, he never does anything half-hearted, swings himself nearly off his feet. All that for absolutely nothing"
"short ball down leg, McCullum picked the length up, knew the gap behind square leg and slots it there with his usual brutality"
"he's getting to that dangerous place where every ball - even a good one, swinging into the blockhole - is being met with disdain. Drilled with great bottom-handed strength past midwicket"
"expected that. Even if Hooda was bowling from around the wicket to cut the angle, Raina is too good a player of spin to let a part-timer go without punishment in the powerplay. Big stride forward and a lash over the covers"
gently stroked to long-off to let Baz have some fun
"flighted on leg stump, nudhed to deep midwicket."
stands up tall behind a flatter delivery and whips it through midwicket.
""
"ties McCullum down on leg stump, he looks for a single through midwicket but the bat face closed too early."
"offcutter, ends up a full toss on leg stump, dabbed to midwicket"
"set up for the cut shot, but has to settle for an inside edge because there wasn't the requisite room to free those arms"
delightful shot. Raina got down to the wide yorker and guided it to short third man. McCullum is up for a quick single
attempts to find the blockhole and McCullum turns away into the leg side
"so if it isn't a yorker, he goes for the change of pace. It's back of a length and just outside off, Raina tries to power it away himself but finds cover"
punched to long-off to retain strike
"flighted on leg stump, Raina moves forward, across and jabs it behind square leg"
the large boundaries at Rajkot have made an impact. No mis-hits will fly away tonight. McCullum goes for a slog sweep once he sees the ball tossed up outside off. Made contact rather low on the bat and so ends up as a simple catch for deep midwicket
on the hips and Raina turns it to square leg
"good length ball on off stump, defended"
"stays back, a reaction to the flatter trajectory, picks the gap at midwicket."
"excellent placement. Warner is one of the best outfielders in cricket, but even he had to escort the ball to the wide long-on boundary. Advanced on the left-arm spinner, played with the turn and made sure he was hitting the ball well beyond the fielder's reach"
"crisp strike into the covers, Karthik's already moving his feet well. Leaned forward to a good length ball as if he were batting all day"
closes the bat face and finds a single off a fuller ball on off stump at long-on.
"tight run! Karthik's in trouble. Point takes aim, but Hooda doesn't hit the target. Raina picked the slower delivery and guided it off the open face. An immediate called helped, but despite Karthik's dive, he would have been out"
skirts past his hips as Karthik attempts a flick. Back of a length and seemed to beat him for pace a touch too
"trouble with bounce there. Karthik was forward, but the ball wasn't quite there for him. Leaps up and hits him on the thigh pad. Should have been flicking off the back foot"
"nudged to long leg, and he manages to do so on the back foot as he was supposed to off shorter deliveries"
pushed to long-off to take a single and bring us to the time out
"flighted just outside off, Raina presses forward for a push to cover"
steps back when there is no flight and pats it through the gap past cover's right
"around the wicket to the right-hander, and the left-handed Raina too, Karthik stays beside the ball and cuts it to deep point"
patted to long-on after moving deep in his crease. The ump comes up to have a word with Raina for some reason
"that's a favourite shot of his. The sweep, and if he stays long enough, the scoops would come too. With Hooda bowling from around the stumps, the line is predictable. DK exploits that with a swift and powerful scoop all along the ground"
"he's fallen to a full toss! A juicy one too, on leg stump, Karthik went for the sweep again and picks out the man at deep square leg to relative perfection. The ball thuds into Bhuvneshwar's hard hands and leaps out, but he collects the rebound safely"
"slower through the air, driven into the covers"
"he's done well, Bipul. It's a new batsman, yes, but in his form, spinners often forget the impact of a flighted ball. Bravo is kept to a block because of it here."
"flatter and quicker on middle, Bravo gets off the mark with a whip through midwicket"
"tossed up on leg stump, Raina parks it in the open spaces behind square leg"
""
"stagnant feet from Bravo, but his hands chase a shortish delivery outside off. It had held in the pitch to ruin his shot. Think he may have been looking for a cut, instead ends up spooning it over cover"
steered into the covers for a quick single.
"with all the fielders inside the circle on the circle, Raina makes sure he softens his hands, blocks and picks up a single to cover"
a clip to square leg off the back foot
soothing cricket here. The spinners are happy to bowl flat with long-off and long-on back. And the batsman are happy to go on with singles. Straight bat push to the deep
goes back and clips a quicker delivery off his pads to deep square leg
"well played, Raina. He's looked in control of himself, and the innings, from the first ball. Pushes the spinner gently to long-off to complete the single that takes him to the mark. If he wants a single, he's got it. If he wanted a boundary, he's got it."
"a tad short, Raina makes his own room considering Henriques is bowling around the stumps, great timing on the cut shot, but point dives to his left and gets a good hand on it"
"moves back in his crease, uses that extra time to tuck a shortish ball off his hips to long leg"
supple wrists from Bravo comes into play as he works the back of a length ball behind square leg
"115 kph, a few slower balls are sitting in the deck here. This back of a length ball jams into a bare spot on the pitch and foils Bravo's flick. Jumps off the leading edge towards mid-on"
""
"mild appeal from the bowler, Dharmasena says it wouldn't have hit the stumps. Full and angled in on middle and leg, Bravo falls over as he tries a flick"
"had to put a lot of power on the ball, because Sran offered nothing. Bravo whirls his wrists, doesn't bother keeping the ball down despite the big boundaries and a man stationed at deep square leg. Bhuvneshwar takes it comfortably"
sting pinging off his bat. Raina's got the measure of this wicket. Sweet drive into the covers
he must have learned what a good total on this pitch is too. Looking in no hurry to up the run-rate. Picks out the slower ball on middle and tucks it through square leg
"stays back and hammers a short delivery outside off to long-on. Hit low on the bat, I think."
"hint of width and Raina has placed his front foot just far enough across to set him up for a cover drive, and still not leave him too close to the ball that he would give up on the freedom his arms were given"
punched to long-off
"adjusted well to the offcutter, Jadeja was on the front foot expecting to work the angle of the ball coming into him. But when he realises it has sat in the pitch longer, he delays his shot and softens his hands. Two to deep square leg"
"another cutter, this one outside off, Jadeja was nearly sucked into an expansive drive, but realised how dangerous it would be and pulled out of the shot. Defends it with the bat face pointing down for a single through cover"
that's in the slot and Raina thumps it over the top of Mustafiz's head. Warner runs to his right from long-on and should really have stopped that. Slid at the very last minute and found himself too close to the ball and the momentum takes him away from it before he had a grip
"full on middle, worked behind square leg"
"very full just outside off, pushed into the covers"
"very full on off stump, Jadeja leans over it and finds a single through square leg"
they don't seem to be panicking even if we are into the final five overs. Shortish delivery just outside off meets a late cut to third man
"slow and short and outside off, Raina cuts to deep point. Bit of a mis-hit because the ball held in the pitch a bit more"
"pushed Jadeja back in front of off stump and got the ball to rise up over his stomach. With no room and no leverage possible, the batsman can only block. Well bowled, Bhuvi"
took it a little too far there. Thudded the ball into the middle of the deck and it soared over Jadeja. Did Bhuvi expect the batsman to charge him there?
"length ball, slashed over backward point. Jaddu and Raina are quick between the wickets and that puts the man running in from the deep under pressure. Misfield ensues"
"nicely sliced past point and the two is taken just as easily. Big grounds making the batsman, and fielders, work harder"
"tries to keep it out of Jadeja's reach outside off, went a little too far again"
"a slower short ball outside off, Jadeja waits and dabs it to deep third man to retain strike"
"seems overpitched outside off, Jadeja goes for a square drive but he hasn't placed it past point"
"low full toss on middle and leg, whipped to deep midwicket"
"full, but not quite full enough. Mustafizur's yorkers are usually bang on, perhaps he's not trying. This is an overpitched delivery driven to long-off"
"slogged away across the line to deep midwicket, possibly the first time Raina has looked ugly tonight."
"beautiful, and he knows it. Throws a sly little smirk at the departing batsman. The offcutter is on an inviting length - the length that makes a batsman think he can get under it and slog it away - Jaddu tries it but he is beaten for the lack of pace. The ball then dances past him and topples off stump"
"126 kph, not his usually stops-on-a-batsman slower ball. This just skirts past the right-hander outside off. Nath wasn't sure whether he wanted to play or leave"
"116 kph, they're not allowing the batsman any pace. And without it, Raina can only find a single after lofting the ball over point"
"ooh, that was tight. Sran bowls full and wide outside off to make sure the batsman can't reach it. Nath throws his bat at it and misses. Plan well executed"
"shortish and outside off, cut to deep point"
"87 kph, well done, Raina! He dismissed Parthiv with this very ball - the back of the hand slower ball that seems like a chinaman's googly. The batsman picked it, delayed his bat swing and slogged it away past midwicket's right"
""
"low full toss, Nath wants to smoke this over long-off, gets a thick outside edge to cover"
"127 kph, the offcutter is pitched full on middle stump and darts across the outside edge. Nath swings and misses"
"with little luck standing in his crease, Nath races forward and and swings blind. He was searching for the ball after it leaps off the outside edge and lands safely between sweeper cover, long-off and a backtracking cover"
"ooooh, that's scary. Nath was down for the scoop shot and the Fizz bowls a full toss over his head. That could have caused injury, even Warner watching from the boundary instinctively ducks"
abandons the slower ball and goes for a yorker outside off. it's doubly effective because he preempted the batsman clearing his front leg
"slower ball on off stump, drilled to long-off"
"full toss on off stump, bunted to long-on"
well placed! Good start for the Lions and it comes from Raina again. He's been the only batsman in control on this slow pitch. Opens the face and slices a very full ball outside off past an awkward dive from Mustafiz at point
"that's straight up and comes straight down to sit in long-on's hands. It's back of a length, and its the offcutter. Those just haven't arrived on the batsman tonight. Several of them have been caught playing early and its Raina's turn in the final over when he has no choice but to slog. Top edge off the front foot pull, gone"
"and he's on a hat-trick. Takes all the pace off and plants the ball full on off stump, Nath hopes for a six over long-off but his bat face skews open and ends up behind caught at cover"
"Bhuvi was disappointed there. Flung his hands in disappointment that the long-on fielder did not get under it. Length ball on middle, smashed over the top, Morgan perhaps had too much ground to cover"
pummeled down the ground to long-on again.
"and that's the third to finish off the over. Steyn had to go, and Bhuvi made sure he couldn't go far with a legcutter. Loft down the ground carries only as far as long-on"
"not that much swing, enough to get Warner prodding forward. On a good length, swinging back in to off. A very solid drive finds cover"
"good stuff from Steyn. Good length again, on off and middle. Absolutely no width. Warner still times a punch to extra cover."
"back of a length but starts it too straight, on leg and Warner swivels into a half-blooded pull to square leg. He rushes back for the second"
"a thick outside edge races away for four. A very good delivery - good length, moving away slightly and Warner prods from the crease and gets a thick edge. Past the slip and into the third man fence"
"change in length, Steyn goes full for the first time this over. Outside off and Warner steers a square drive to point"
a bit of width and four. What did you expect with this man's form? Warner throws his hands at the fuller delivery and skews it over point. Scurries to the boundary. 10 off the first.
"good start. A full, outswinging delivery. Dhawan inside-edges towards his pad, past the stumps and Warner calls him through"
"good length on off, from around the wicket. Warner pushes to cover, and another quick single ensues"
"an offcutter on middle, Dhawan stays in his crease and times the pull nicely. Gets the gap st square leg too, Looks set for Dhawan's first four before Tambe rushes across and puts in a boundary-saving dive."
"oops. Oh no, that will not help Gujarat. Warner feigns a shimmy, and Praveen starts his inswinger too straight. Goes well down leg, Karthik dives but that direction of swing takes the ball past the keeper too"
just a flick to square leg off the inswinger. Two more quick runs
another wide. Strays down leg
"pace off the ball, shortish on off. Warner stays in his crease and ensures he doesn't go to the ball thereby making some room, crashes it to extra cover"
"133 kph, back of a length on off. Jammed away to cover"
"'yeah, yeah, yeah,' says Dhawan after nudging a fast, back of a length delivery into the midwicket region"
"followed Warner as he hoped to make room, and yet the batsman is able to chop it away hard enough to make deep third man sweat. Kulkarni saves it after tumbling around"
"mid-on and mid-off were chasing it, their necks craning upward, but this slower ball that Warner has sent soaring lands safely. PK and Bravo were them men after it"
"excellent decision making. It's short, targeted Warner around the chest area, but with that big bat, he's indestructible. Sways his body from the line of fire and brings an angled bat down"
"143 kph, he's putting in a lot of heat. Steyn's running in hard, he seems to want to make a statement. Dhawan is happy to let the ball fly into the gloves"
"shortish and sliding down, Dhawan tries a flick but can't reach that far at this pace"
races off the bat as Dhawan gets forward to a good length ball and slices it to point
was that even that short? I wouldn't think so. But Warner knocked his front leg to the side like it did something bad. Drilled through extra cover
"so full and wide goes Praveen to beat Warner's reach, and does he? That's an emphatic No. Warner is balanced. His weight is leg side of the ball and he threades the gap past cover"
"slower shortish delivery outside off, Warner holds his pose and then goes for the cut"
"very full, and rather slow on middle, Warner dabs it to point and sets off. Jaddu is the man there, and he has no chance. Ends up giving an overthrow - but that's not his fault, the man backing up at midwicket was poor - which brings Warner back on strike"
"in the slot, bashed to the straight boundary! Brutal hit. Makes you wonder why he needs such a large bat if he can summon so much power."
"fuller ball outside off, sliced to deep third man"
"that's the dipping slower ball! Beautiful to watch. Starts off as an offcutter and it sinks just as the batsman seemed to have guessed the variation. Dhawan was looking for a single, instead has to block"
"yes, he was hoping for it to dip and become a yorker, but Bravo hasn't put enough pixie dust on it. Wait, actually pixie dust makes things fly. Bad analogy. Anyway, Dhawan plays a suberb flick shot through square leg"
turned away through square leg again
"goes for a bouncer at 124 kph, sails over middle and off as Warner ducks. Considering the Sunrsiers' dependence on him, and the Lions' dependence on Bravo, this will be the battle that decides the match"
"gets set for a cut shot very early, waits in position for the ball to arrive. It's a touch full in length though and he can only chop it to the keeper"
"107 kph, that's in the blockhole and Warner helps it to cover off the open face"
"oooh, almost had him. It was a simple little slider down leg. Dhawan was overbalancing as he tries to flick the ball away. Karthik does not collect the ball"
"flatter delivery on off stump, driven back to the bowler"
picks a low full toss to deep square leg and Raina has to deal with Warner now
pure power! It almost doesn't seem to matter what length the bowler bowls. Warner is so quick to set himself up on the back foot and those hands and forearms take care of the rest. Puts enough on the ball to burst through the left of cover
"that's a mis-hit. The ball stayed low on middle, Warner was set to pull it and panicked into the shot. And yet the ball is trundling away to the midwicket boundary"
""
"that's more a thick outside edge, dribbling away towards the third man boundary. Mistimed it because he made too much room."
"stays back against a flatter ball on middle and works it through midwicket. Yells 'No, no' soon as he saw Jadeja running in to field that ball"
"looped up on middle, driven along the ground to long-on. Dhawan getting some valuable time at the middle. He's 12 off 12. His partner's 48 off 27"
"picked the googly, waited for the spin on the back foot and cuts from the stumps to deep point"
"think that was another googly, tossed a little too full so Dhawan is able to sweep and not worry about the turn"
"on the pads and Warner clips it through midwicket to bring up his fifty and then asks for a new pair of gloves. Very business-like, Davey"
"oooh, that was very full to cut. But he still prefers the shot. Slices it to short third man to get off strike."
"drifts down leg, Dhawan misses a sweep because he chose a ball too full for the shot"
appeal for leg before as Dhawan comes forward but can't get to the pitch and then tries to close the face too early.
stays back and with the additional time he is able to clip the ball behind square leg
gently done. Warner backs away and guides the shortish delivery to short third man
"flighted outside off, driven past the right of a diving Raina"
"quicker and flatter and wider of off stump, so Warner has chosen his shot well - a late cut towards short third man"
"132 kph, two high quality innings tonight on a pitch that isn't perfectly suited for strokeplay. Low full toss on leg stump, but since Bravo is the biggest threat, Warner holds himself back to a single to long-on"
"straying down leg, glanced to the fine leg boundary. Killing it quietly, these two"
"shortish on leg stump, turned to deep square leg"
"short and slow, Warner plays a dab to third man with extreme nonchalance. Like he's almost bored by the challenge now"
"that's the old dipping slower ball, Dhawan flicks and misses. Bravo goes up in appeal, but pitched outside leg and the impact on Dhawan's pad was outside leg too"
"clears his feet from the line of the ball on leg stump, steered through the covers and they scamper across for a second run as well. Great work"
nicely flighted and it dips on Dhawan before he could unleash the drive. Inside edge back to the bowler
pitches on middle and drifts down leg. Dhawan flicks and misses and collects a wide
"that's the googly on off stump, Dhawan seems to have picked it. Dabs into the off side and gets the single before Karthik can catch up with the ball"
pushed to long-on
"tossed up on leg stump, Dhawan gives it a gentle flick so that the fielder running from the square leg boundary has too much ground to cover"
"tossed up on leg stump, swept to long leg"
"googly, Warner backed away and hacked it to the wide long-on boundary. Could have used a better effort there from the fielder wearing number 17"
"good length ball on off stump, defended into the covers"
"round-armed in to the base of middle, Warner was set up for a lash over cover but decides to block instead"
"pushed to long-on. Flat in trajectory, tight on middle"
stays back and clips to long-on
rapid pace from Jadeja - 103 kph - Warner has barely finished backing away when the ball arrives and makes him hurry into a flick
worked to long leg to bring up the hundred
"shortish slower ball on leg stump, knocked into the vacant midwicket region and Bravo has to race after it himself to prevent them from get a second run"
lands a yorker on leg stump - seemed to move away late in the air towards middle - Dhawan manages to skewer it away to square leg
"shortish and outside off, Warner late cuts and gets a single to deep third man"
"110 kph, there's the old paddle sweep. If he wants to bowl like a spinner, Dhawan will treat him like one. Offcutter strays too far down leg and its tickled away"
ouch! That's a dirty full toss outside off and Dhawan clubs it to the deep midwicket boundary
driven through the covers
"good length ball on off stump, defended"
"some turn for Jaddu, and its quick turn. He could have been a force had there been a better total. Dhawan is surprised by the deviation and his flick shot doesn't cover it"
worked away to short fine leg
"gets low for a late cut, but finds short third man"
comes down the track and blocks a good length ball from outside off stump with a slightly closed face so that it becomes a single to long-on
"98kph, fired in on middle and leg, pushed to long-on"
"back of a length and on leg stump, turned away through midwicket"
"shortish on off stump, blocked to cover and a loud call of 'No' sends Warner back"
"past short fine leg's give, but Tambe at deep square leg is there as extra cover. Simple little flick shot"
"that's excellent placement. Pace on the ball and Dhawan relishes this kind of pace. Medium pace. Especially when there's width. Delays the cut shot just enough to beat point inside the circle, and puts enough power on it to beat deep third man"
picked away to deep square leg
"short and wide, Warner makes it worse by clearing his front leg and lacing the ball to sweeper cover"
"speared in on middle, Warner goes for a big heave and inside edges to deep midwicket"
"chops it past backward point and Bravo has a lot of work to do on the boundary to cut that off. Lovely shot from Dhawan, waited on it nicely"
and now he shows off his strength on the front foot. Dhawan jumps down the track and clips it through to deep midwicket to bring up his half-century. Gets a hug from his partner
"99 kph, stopped just inside the deep square leg boundary. Good flick shot from Dhawan, but Kulkarni bent down and fllicked the ball just before it trickled away."
"no one's stopping that and that gives Sunrisers a 10-wicket victory! Lovely late cut from the captain. Jadeja was darting them in, so Warner simply waits leg side and dabs it past the keeper."
